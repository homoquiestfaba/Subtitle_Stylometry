1
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,237
There's gotta be a million people
in the middle of that store.

2
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,141
Tommy. Tommy, if you ever wanna call me
friend again, you'll help me right now.

3
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,475
Okay, you've been in charge of the tree
for the last 10 years,

4
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,447
and somehow or another
you've always managed to pull it off.

5
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,711
I have faith in you, brother.

6
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,715
Anybody heard from Kelly?

7
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,756
She had to run out real quick
and pick up some last-minute stuff.

8
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,085
Yes, she did, didn't she?

9
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,819
She's getting me
that stainless steel barbecue, isn't she?

10
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,724
-I don't know.
-You know what she's...

11
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,895
And so do you. Don't...

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,564
That's fine. That's all right.
I like surprises. That's all right.

13
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,161
Is that what you got for Aunt Kelly?

14
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,365
Yeah.

15
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,911
-Why, you don't like it?
-It's nice.

16
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,210
Come on now.
Your daddy helped me pick it out.

17
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,303
Yeah.

18
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,406
2 men shouldn't
go shopping for jewelry.

19
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,280
What do you... You know what?

20
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,013
She's gonna love it 'cause it's from Tommy.

21
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,611
And second of all,
it's the thought that counts, anyway.

22
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,316
Okay, yeah. Well, I don't want her to
love it because Tommy got it for her.

23
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,392
-You're the one...
-Just relax, okay?

24
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,324
-Don't listen to her. Just wrap the gift.
-Hey, Dad.

25
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,124
-What?
-Sometimes it's the gift that matters.

26
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:42,930
Really? So, then your gift for me
better be really good.

27
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,530
It is. I maxed out your card.

28
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,808
-Did you hear that?
-I... Yeah, I did.

29
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,037
Between an ex-wife
and a teenage daughter,

30
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,704
you wonder why I'm broke all the time?

31
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,408
Well, I'm starting to figure it out,
I tell you that much.

32
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,109
When are you guys gonna have kids?

33
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,153
Well, you know what?
It might be sooner than you think.

34
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,812
I mean, Kelly's sister
and that husband of theirs...

35
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,322
I mean, they're replicating
like rabbits, you know?

36
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,893
And that's put Kelly in the mood.
It really has.

37
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:11,486
And you know me, I mean,
I've always wanted kids, so...

38
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,361
You never know. We'll see.

39
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,806
I told you I could count on you,
now didn't I?

40
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,742
Okay.

41
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,555
-It's Christmas Eve.
-I know, baby. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,947
If we're gonna be more than 45 minutes,

43
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,358
-tell Kelly I'll give her a call.
-I love you, too. Bye.

44
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,425
Our informant has set
a meeting with The Lion.

45
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,798
We have a time and a place.

46
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,930
Get the team prepped
and ready to move out ASAP.

47
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,008
-What's up?
-Tonight could be a career moment for us.

48
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,839
-We have a location on The Lion.
-Reliable?

49
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,413
Well, the tip comes from a guy
who claims he's his father.

50
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,881
He thinks his son is The Lion
and he can't keep it secret anymore.

51
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,645
This is it, gentlemen.

52
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,916
After 3 years of hard work,
we've got the break we've been waiting for.

53
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,550
We've received a credible tip
concerning the whereabouts of The Lion.

54
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,595
Now watch your step in there.
This guy's a bomb specialist

55
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,960
wanted for assassinations
all over the world.

56
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,556
Tom, you've been living and breathing
this guy for 3 years.

57
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,602
It's your show. You're first in.

58
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,727
Let's do it.

59
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,446
All right, guys. Listen up.
You heard Duvall.

60
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,679
This guy's a loose cannon.
Stay alert. Cover your partner's ass.

61
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,256
We'll all be opening up presents
by tomorrow morning with the families.

62
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,517
-Got it?
-Yeah.

63
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,130
<i>First strike in position.</i>

64
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:49,586
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Move, move, move, move!

65
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,885
-Excellent. Excellent.
-Bedroom clear.

66
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,930
-Going to right.
-Hallway clear!

67
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,298
Left front living room.

68
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,734
-Living room and kitchen secure.
-10 through the air.

69
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,008
-Tommy, get down to the basement now.
-Coming now.

70
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,142
<i>He's on his way now.</i>

71
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,487
Hey, Tommy. This is bad, man.

72
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,764
-Kelly?
-No, no... Stop, stop.

73
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,567
Looks like a perimeter, man.
Looks like 20 pounds of C-4.

74
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,750
-Detective Armstrong.
-Who is this?

75
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,988
Do not speak
until you are asked a specific question,

76
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,588
at which point
you will simply say "yes " or "no."

77
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,189
-I need a trace confirmed immediately.
-Copy.

78
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,101
Do not scream into the phone.
Do not call me "motherfucker,"

79
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,935
and tell me that you'll hunt me down
and kill me.

80
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,305
Honestly, that will do no good.

81
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,370
-Are we clear so far?
-Yes.

82
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,211
Good. Now, Tom, this is important.

83
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,746
If anyone tries to leave the basement
or cross that black line,

84
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,982
everyone in the house will die.
Do you understand?

85
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:39,690
Nobody move! All portals are triggered.
I repeat, all portals are triggered.

86
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,968
Unsub's claiming the place is locked.
Confirm.

87
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,769
Look closely at your wife's bosom.

88
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,570
-You'll see a red heart.
-Yes.

89
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:54,475
The trigger shutoff control
is taped to her chest

90
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,242
directly behind the heart.

91
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,619
Tom, one more thing.
That cop on the right,

92
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,816
what's he carrying? An MP5?
Take it from him now, would you please?

93
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,819
MP, now.

94
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,521
Yes. Okay. Got it.

95
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,456
You have a decision to make.

96
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,533
Shut off the controls by shooting your wife,

97
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,874
or do nothing and you, she,
and your men will all die.

98
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,638
Listen to me. Why are you doing this?

99
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,041
You wrecked
my entire Southwest Network.

100
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,376
Now I came here to do my job,
which was Panama.

101
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:34,351
I'm gonna leave with something else.
Either your life or your sanity.

102
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,888
-Doesn't matter to me which you choose.
-You listen to me.

103
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,924
-We can work something out. You hear me?
-You can't afford me, Tom.

104
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:44,588
I have to lower my standards
just to make you a target.

105
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,566
I'll find you.

106
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,835
You know that.

107
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,970
I suggest you apprise your men
of their situation.

108
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,598
You have 3 minutes and 25 seconds.

109
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,939
Jesus, Tommy, please. Here, talk to me.

110
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,276
This is the first time
I've seen you look scared, man.

111
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,908
C-4 shutoff switch
is a glass tube taped to Kelly's chest.

112
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,144
What the fuck does that mean?

113
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,882
In order to deactivate the explosives,
I have to shoot the switch.

114
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,821
And what if you don't?

115
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,384
Then we all die.

116
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,419
-I wanna negotiate.
-There's no negotiating.

117
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,398
Tom, I told you, it's in motion.
I pushed the button.

118
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,061
My explosives don't have an off switch.

119
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,368
You kill all of your men,
make their wives widows,

120
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,466
leave all their children fatherless,

121
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:36,639
or shut off the switch.
You have 2 and a half minutes.

122
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,079
Fuck this guy, all right?

123
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,016
I say we smash the cameras,
grab Kelly, and run like hell.

124
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,213
He can light this place up
a lot faster than we can run.

125
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:48,225
Now you make it clear to your men,
running is not an option.

126
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,558
Saving your wife is not an option.

127
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,928
You listen to me, you motherfucker.
I swear to fucking God that...

128
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,559
What did I tell you about calling me that?

129
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,865
There's 2 minutes left, Tom.

130
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,176
You listen to me.
I'm begging you now, all right?

131
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,272
You don't do this.

132
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,784
You don't take this out on my wife,
you understand me?

133
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,081
I am not taking it out on her.

134
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,152
In fact, Kelly and I had
a very nice conversation.

135
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,198
And I made sure that when you shut
the switch off, she won't feel a thing.

136
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,429
You're the one that has to
live with what happens tonight.

137
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:30,695
No, no.

138
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,496
You have one of my men
put a gun to my head,

139
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,439
they pull the trigger, you have me.
You understand me?

140
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,369
Tom.

141
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,675
If I wanted it to be that easy,
I'd have done it already.

142
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,715
We have confirmation from OED.
3 encrypted triggers, man.

143
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,445
There's enough C-4 down here
to blow the whole block.

144
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,786
What's the call, Tom?

145
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,851
-Tommy. You gotta make a call, man.
-I don't know, man.

146
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,598
I don't know.

147
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,932
-Tom.
-Yeah?

148
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,767
You're running out of time.
Your choice, one life or 10?

149
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,965
You look at me.

150
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,337
Now please, I'll do anything you want,
but you don't kill her.

151
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,583
I'm not going to kill her. You are.

152
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,744
You've been investigating this case
and me long enough to know

153
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,450
that I mean what I say
and I do what I mean.

154
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,119
Please. She's all I got.

155
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:34,258
If it makes it easier for Kelly,
why don't you shut off the lights.

156
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,628
The cameras have night vision.

157
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,433
So it doesn't make a difference to me.

158
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,567
Come on, Tommy. What's the call, man?

159
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,839
There's gotta be another way, Ryan.
Come on, help me out here, man.

160
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
We're approaching one minute.

161
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,345
Honey, look at me.

162
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,182
Honey, can you look at me?

163
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,691
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

164
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,562
What I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna turn the lights out.

165
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,102
I'm gonna scoop you up in the dark

166
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,263
and I'm gonna carry you
right out of here, okay?

167
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,905
But I need you to do me a favor.

168
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,410
Whenever I turn the lights out,
I want you to be very still.

169
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,778
Okay? Can you do that?

170
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,520
It's almost over, baby.

171
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,726
I love you.

172
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,298
Ryan.

173
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,918
Tom Armstrong? Wait.

174
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,616
Are you Tom Armstrong?

175
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,392
I am. Why?

176
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,524
Haven't spoken English in a while.

177
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,795
That's fine. Kind of miss it, actually.

178
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,097
-What you need?
-Can we talk for a few minutes?

179
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,835
-How about I buy you another drink?
-No, thanks. How about tomorrow?

180
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,342
No, that's not good enough.

181
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,072
It wasn't easy to find you,
and I deserve a few minutes for the effort.

182
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,114
Can we just have a seat?

183
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:20,943
Yeah.

184
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,989
So you're with the FBI?

185
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,254
-How'd you know?
-Christ, lady.

186
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,821
If it was the CIA, they would've
waited till I left the building,

187
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,460
thrown a black bag over my head,
and handed me off to Washington.

188
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,902
You're in a bar, for Christ's sake.
Ain't touched a drink.

189
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,699
Speak with a Southwest accent.

190
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,402
Even I can hear some Quantico
in there somewhere.

191
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,380
Carrying a standard issue 40 caliber Glock.
Nobody else in here would pick up on it,

192
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,144
but any decent cop can spot an agent.

193
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,449
Especially an agent trying
not to look like an agent.

194
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,648
You never told me your name.

195
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:03,083
-Isabel Ordonez, FBI.
-Tom Armstrong. Retiree.

196
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,756
-Pretty perceptive for a retiree.
-Yeah, well, what's your point?

197
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,363
I was hoping that you could
just listen to this tape...

198
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,903
Lady, I never told you anything
about helping you.

199
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,169
All I need is a few seconds
for you to listen to it.

200
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,336
You know what? It's taken me a while here,

201
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,107
but I finally found a way
to make this place work.

202
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,011
I got it, and it'll take all of 2 minutes.

203
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,608
-It won't. It won't take 2 minutes.
-I'm not going to leave. This is important.

204
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,119
Listen, Agent Ordonez,
or whatever your name is...

205
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,519
The Lion is back in Albuquerque.

206
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,090
-How close are you to getting him?
-We're close.

207
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,599
We think we've intercepted
a cell phone call he made to an associate,

208
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,531
and we need for you to give us a voice ID.

209
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:47,230
You are the only person we know
that's ever spoken to him.

210
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,931
Okay?

211
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:50,966
Yeah.

212
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,984
The best opportunity we have
is the Carom Club,

213
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,552
-Saturday, 8:00 sharp.
-Okay.

214
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,180
Make sure we have the truck, car,
storage rental, and explosives.

215
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,453
Now I need to get to Panama,
and I need to get out.

216
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,090
-I know it's short...
-It's him.

217
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,561
You're sure?

218
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,359
Yeah. Yeah.

219
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,562
A voice ID is flimsy,

220
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,695
but the judge just needs a reason
to issue a warrant.

221
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:24,401
Tom, if you're interested, we'd like
to have you come back to Albuquerque,

222
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,478
take a look at our files on The Lion.

223
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,739
No one's ever gotten
as close to him as you.

224
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,883
-Your role would be strictly as a consultant.
-I don't think so.

225
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,049
Never really been much of a consultant.

226
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,320
Thank you for your help.
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

227
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,381
Saving your wife is not an option.

228
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,671
You're the one that has to
live with what happens tonight.

229
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,610
-How are we doing on video capture?
-Nothing yet.

230
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,378
And it's become a real big problem.

231
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,454
We gotta move these people
off the dance floor.

232
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,681
-This is out.
-All right.

233
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,423
Let's see what you got.

234
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,845
-Yeah.
-Look how pretty she is.

235
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,542
Thank you.

236
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,783
-You, my friend, are late.
-My name wasn't on the VIP list.

237
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,955
I had to wait in line
with the rest of the Feds.

238
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,153
You're being paranoid.
There's no Feds here.

239
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,753
They intercepted last week's call.

240
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,127
The question is,
are you an informant or just stupid?

241
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:20,136
Watch your mouth.
I'm not gonna dignify that with an answer.

242
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,035
Dignify it with a "no."

243
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,801
Everyone came with a date,
except me.

244
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,278
That kind of party.

245
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,377
All right, you're ready to go.

246
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,448
Ryan, move it back.

247
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,494
My God, that's Tommy.

248
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,827
You're really starting to piss me off,
you know that?

249
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,567
-I wouldn't wanna do that.
-I don't see any cops.

250
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,675
We're in a club filled with women.

251
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,071
Look for the boys
who aren't checking them out.

252
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:09,984
All right.

253
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,189
So what do you wanna do?

254
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,021
We finish our business,
then I'll create a diversion.

255
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,959
We'll get out of here.

256
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,589
You shouldn't be here, Tom.

257
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:30,706
Check out the table by the window.
Your 5 o'clock.

258
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,807
The man seated has a bodyguard.

259
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,079
Give me video capture,
table against the window.

260
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,741
<i>You got it.</i>

261
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:47,352
Do not interfere with this arrest.
It would ruin us in court.

262
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,963
Get the strike team in place.

263
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,106
-Go on green.
-Copy that.

264
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,332
Where's the key?

265
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,572
Self storage unit.
It's reserved under an untraceable name.

266
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,673
I've also got the vehicles you requested.
One average sedan, one average truck.

267
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,947
-And my associate?
-Yeah, he and his team are out tomorrow.

268
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,217
-He has a C.I. lined up to meet you.
-Is the K.C.I. in the car?

269
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,348
Yes.

270
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,219
Codes, right? Bank account?

271
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,566
Joke? Supposed to be fucking funny?

272
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,603
Not for you.

273
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,917
Get all these people secured!
Get to that sidewalk! Do not move!

274
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,520
Get those people secured.
Get them secured now!

275
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,793
Agent Ordonez, what's going on inside?

276
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,960
There's been an explosion inside the club.

277
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,403
Hold at the entrance
and send a team across the street.

278
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,670
Copy that. Secure that building,
inside, second floor.

279
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,431
Suspect's fled the building,
heading to the back alley.

280
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,177
Tactical, we're on second floor.
No sign of shooter.

281
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,773
Be advised, we've got a weapon,
no shooter.

282
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,905
Get me a medical team in here, now.

283
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,539
-Go to the...
-Got it.

284
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,756
What the fuck are you doing here?

285
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,231
I gave you a chance.
Why did you come back?

286
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,963
Now you've made it personal.
Now I'm gonna kill you, you bastard.

287
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,482
Freeze! Stay where you are!

288
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,858
Don't move! Don't touch that door!

289
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,189
Step away from the van!

290
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,923
-He's...
-Don't speak.

291
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,364
Look at me the entire time.
I said, shut the fuck up.

292
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:05,040
Suspect's leaving on a motorcycle.
Eastbound towards University Boulevard.

293
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:09,512
I have another suspect in custody.
Request assistance. Put the gun down.

294
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,474
Keep your hands in the air.

295
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,979
Now, get on your knees!
Put your hands behind your head.

296
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,065
I'm Special Agent in Charge William Hopter.

297
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,467
I spoke with Isabel Ordonez and Ryan Alba,

298
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,137
so I understand why you're here.

299
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,336
The FBI is under a lot of pressure,
so I need to be frank with you.

300
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,504
The Lion has us scrambling.

301
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,873
Tonight was our best chance in years
to catch him, and we missed.

302
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,416
Listen, I welcome any help
that you can provide to this investigation,

303
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,389
but I need to be clear with you.

304
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,825
This is not an opportunity
for you to be a vigilante.

305
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,361
I'm here as a cop. Nothing more.

306
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,390
Good.

307
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:08,205
Ryan Alba would like to see you.
He's with us, came over a few years ago.

308
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,503
Just tell him I'm not really feeling
up to it tonight, would you, please?

309
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,167
Sure. It's late.

310
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:15,679
Why don't you come in tomorrow

311
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,977
and give Agent Ordonez
a detailed report about the alley?

312
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,846
-Yeah. Will do.
-Okay.

313
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,152
Hey, brother.

314
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,921
I thought we closed Panama.

315
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,029
The case is closed when it's finished.
That's what I taught you.

316
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,295
That's for start-up expenses.

317
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,598
This is gonna generate
a good deal of attention,

318
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,107
so do a Casper once it's over.

319
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:30,754
-What's the matter?
-I'm concerned about Tom Armstrong.

320
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,480
Why are you bringing him back
into the picture?

321
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,856
Tom found his way back
to Albuquerque uninvited.

322
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,896
Stop playing games with him.
Kill Armstrong.

323
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:44,094
-The way he dies has to be fitting.
-I'm not here for that, David.

324
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:48,229
You wanna fuck with Armstrong for sport,
I have to refuse the job.

325
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,945
You're not in a position to refuse.

326
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,546
Never forget who you're dealing with.

327
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,622
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

328
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,564
Step through, please. Arms up.

329
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,094
Here to see Agent Ordonez.

330
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,840
Armstrong, right? Here you go.

331
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,532
Thank you, sir.

332
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,525
Come on in.

333
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,796
Welcome to my home away from home.

334
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,932
Looks like he's been traveling the world,
enjoying himself, doesn't it?

335
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,004
Looks that way.

336
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,300
I remember that case,
but I don't think that was The Lion.

337
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,706
We were actually able to
rule out his presence in India, so...

338
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,802
We ruled it back in.

339
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,074
It's been a while since you've been updated.

340
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,878
Why don't we have a seat, get started?

341
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,043
Yeah.

342
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,250
Okay, so in the initial report you said

343
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,490
you saw the bodyguard enter the alley
and you followed him,

344
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,294
then you found him dead
with his throat slit.

345
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,301
Was there anything else?

346
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,431
I approached the van, I was fired on,
there was a skirmish,

347
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,976
and he fled out of the back of a van
on a motorcycle.

348
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,071
-And did you fire on him?
-I missed.

349
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,326
Sorry, Mr. Hollis.

350
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,129
-Careful.
-Yes, sir.

351
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,397
-What's your name?
-Carl, sir.

352
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,472
How long have you been here?

353
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:05,167
I've been here 2 weeks
because Mel's on vacation.

354
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,934
Yeah, all right.

355
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,536
Well, somebody could get hurt here.
Watch what you're doing.

356
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:13,310
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
It's just soap and water.

357
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,984
-Just get it cleaned up.
-Yes, sir.

358
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,737
Jesus, Carl, what is that smell?

359
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,066
God damn it.

360
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,843
Panama mean anything to you?

361
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,414
Just that he mentioned it
in a taped phone message.

362
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:48,178
We looked into it,
but it didn't connect with anything. Why?

363
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:53,590
He mentioned it to me 8 years ago.
He said it was the reason he targeted me.

364
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,524
I think it might have something to do
with his trip here 8 years ago.

365
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,424
-I think he's leading you on.
-What do you mean?

366
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:02,625
Well, I think the entire Carom Club event
might've been intentional.

367
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:06,726
You're not investigating him.
He's leading you into some kind of a maze.

368
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,602
You'll only find out
what he wants you to find out.

369
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,174
You'll only be as close
as he wants you to get.

370
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,410
Your cleaning solvent ruined
my floor and made my guests sick.

371
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:18,141
Now, Carl, you were supposed to go home.
You don't work here anymore.

372
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,582
-Now, go home and don't come back.
-Sir, let me make it up to you.

373
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:22,778
-My brother, Oliver...
-Carl...

374
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,414
He's got his own company.
He's a good tile man. I broke it, I own it.

375
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,650
-Please, Mr. Hollis...
-Carl...

376
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,192
-He'll do it for free, please.
-All right, Carl.

377
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,229
You got one last shot.
Your brother can do it, fine.

378
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,959
Thank you, sir. He's my half-brother.

379
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,659
-My mom says he's the better half.
-Whatever.

380
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,259
Carl, go home and get some help.
I don't wanna hear it anymore.

381
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,339
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

382
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,578
Senator Cordero has asked
to sit in with us tonight.

383
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,882
I believe most of you know him
from his time at DEA.

384
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,957
Yeah, thank you.

385
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,548
We need to be as proactive
as we possibly can

386
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,423
with a threat of this magnitude,

387
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,656
so I'm here to listen to what you need.

388
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,255
We got a letter from The Lion today.

389
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,693
"To the FBI.

390
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,497
"I have the city of Albuquerque
in my crosshairs.

391
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:17,335
"You can no longer protect the citizens
you are paid to protect.

392
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,877
"I demand $100 million
to be wired to an account,

393
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,947
"and you have until Saturday
to make the arrangements.

394
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:27,779
"The account number information
will be provided at the appropriate time."

395
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,547
We only have a few days to figure this out.

396
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,021
How does The Lion plan
to take control of the city,

397
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,217
and how are we gonna stop him
before he can do it?

398
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,588
There's gotta be something more than that.

399
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,661
Why do you say that?

400
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,196
'Cause with him,
it's never just about money.

401
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,560
Okay. Well, let's be honest.

402
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,896
I mean, The Lion's wanted
all over the world.

403
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,333
What's he doing back in Albuquerque?
That's where we should start.

404
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,133
I agree with 3 of the assassinations,

405
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,676
but 2 of the others just don't
fully match up with his MO.

406
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,746
Here. I made an outline for you
if you wanna pass those around.

407
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,814
The FARC assassination,
I think you're correct on.

408
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,644
Belize, El Salvador.

409
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,151
In all 3 of those examples,
there was 2 goals achieved.

410
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,654
Belize, El Salvador,
was removal of a high-ranking official

411
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,485
that allowed for a corrupt replacement.

412
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,685
Also brought down
a fairly significant roadblock

413
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,659
for smugglers coming into
and out of the region.

414
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,959
FARC assassination, as you know, that,
that shut down resistance,

415
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,762
allowed the drug lords
to continue to dominate the area.

416
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,563
But the other 2,

417
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,963
Mexico and Peru,

418
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,966
in my opinion, that just doesn't match up.

419
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,376
In both of those examples
the subject was hit,

420
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,947
and there was very little
as far as ramification

421
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,811
to the regional political situation,

422
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,680
nor did it significantly impact
the drug trade.

423
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:35,945
His biggest targets

424
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,682
have always been heavily influenced
by Central and South America. I...

425
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,655
I think Ryan's spot-on.

426
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:45,625
I think The Lion's in Albuquerque
for a very specific reason.

427
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,320
Impressive work, Tom.

428
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,262
I want you and Ordonez
to team up on this one.

429
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,460
Are there any questions? No?

430
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,325
Okay, that's it for now.

431
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,233
Listen, Tommy. Tommy! Tommy.

432
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,105
Hey, man.

433
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,973
-It's good to see you again, man.
-Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

434
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,052
So, listen, come by for dinner
sometime this week?

435
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:13,112
-Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.
-Really? Great. How about Thursday?

436
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,458
-Sounds good.
-Great. Great.

437
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,151
-How's Amy?
-She's great.

438
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,752
She finished grad school at UNM,
you know.

439
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,855
Got a good job at a hotel.

440
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,366
Her boyfriend's
not a total loser, so...

441
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,526
-Congratulations, man.
-Thank you.

442
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,537
Tom? Can I see you
in my office for a minute?

443
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,341
Yeah, sure. Excuse me.

444
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,241
Good seeing you again.

445
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,841
Hey, what's up?

446
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,311
Happy birthday.

447
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,015
You didn't have to do that.

448
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,423
-How'd you know?
-I'm in the FBI.

449
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,427
Make a wish.

450
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,758
You know, it's been a while
since I've celebrated a birthday.

451
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,097
That's...

452
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,203
That's a part of my life I really miss.
Thank you.

453
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,443
I have something else for you, Tom.

454
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,112
We had your APD files transferred
when we re-opened the case,

455
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,416
and this was in one of the boxes.

456
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,790
It was at your wife's feet 8 years ago.
We thought it was more C-4.

457
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,193
I thought you might wanna have it.

458
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,054
-How long is this gonna take?
-Well, I don't know.

459
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,993
You want it fast or you want it good?

460
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:10,533
-I'm doing it for free, so you pick.
-Just get it done.

461
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,738
-Hello.
-Isabel, it's me. Wake up.

462
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,103
I just thought of something.

463
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,146
I think you may be looking
at the office tenants the wrong way.

464
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:01,116
Everyone checked out. It's a dead end, Tom.

465
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,079
He's good at stealing identities.

466
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,679
The names may check out,
but I want you to look at the faces.

467
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,190
What employee there would go unnoticed?

468
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,158
Okay. I'll meet you at the office

469
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,425
and we'll start looking
at all the employee files.

470
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,963
-Did you bring that in?
-No. It's...

471
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:27,109
It's from Carl.
He's still a little embarrassed.

472
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,343
We're sorry about him.

473
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,875
We only get him on holidays.

474
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,947
-Nice job.
-Thank you.

475
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,479
-Hey, there. Good news?
-Could be.

476
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,757
Sterling Cleaning Service
rotates a night crew,

477
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,381
and the guy that was supposed
to clean the Carom Club

478
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,119
on Saturday night didn't show.

479
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,752
Hops is checking with APD for a name.

480
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:23,162
-You look really tired.
-I know. I'm fine.

481
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,469
Say, you normally have this many
heavy hitters in the same building?

482
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,903
No. ATF and LEU move in today
as part of The Lion Task Force.

483
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,339
-Sure. I know.
-DEA's coming in as well.

484
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,310
We'll have the entire force
operating under the same roof.

485
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,039
Well, I'm gonna go see Hops
and check out the new C-techs.

486
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,774
-You coming?
-Yeah.

487
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,385
-Hey, Hops.
-Hey.

488
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:43,845
APD just called.

489
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,785
They got an address for the janitor
for the office building.

490
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,585
The guy's name's Carl Mosler.
I want you and Tom to go check it out.

491
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,319
-I'll get on this.
-Great. Thanks.

492
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,122
-New C-techs?
-Yeah.

493
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,158
The Lion wants us
to wire the money to him

494
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:58,223
so our C-tech department is designing
a web page to handle the transfer.

495
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,735
As soon as he logs in,
we'll nail his location.

496
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,601
And what if he refuses the web address?

497
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,367
We'll give him a choice
of 20 different banks.

498
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,444
They all run through this address,
just with different faces.

499
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,436
-Senator.
-Will.

500
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,841
Would you excuse us, please?

501
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,045
Could you run a demo for us?

502
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:21,886
I'm concerned about tomorrow.
Where are you with the investigation?

503
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,220
We're being realistic about it.

504
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,124
We don't have much information right now.

505
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,754
-What's your position?
-$100 million?

506
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,992
You know we can't even get close
to that amount.

507
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,399
Even if we could, you know we can't pay it.

508
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,905
The United States government
does not give in to terrorist threats.

509
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,202
So, how do we get around that?

510
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,240
We're looking at every available option, sir.

511
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,372
We found a link between a missing
cleaning crew member named Carl Mosler

512
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,847
and the Carom Club bombing.

513
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,046
Agents Ordonez and Armstrong
are on their way over there right now.

514
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,753
God. What's that smell?

515
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,555
Call in Forensics.

516
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,393
This is Agent Ordonez.
Get me Forensics.

517
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:45,168
I need a full Forensics team
at location ASAP.

518
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:14,104
He set this up
just like 8 years ago.

519
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,029
He's making this personal.

520
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:32,055
Tom, you throw one hell of a punch.

521
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:35,358
What do you want?

522
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:39,259
Well, I don't have a family,
and sadly I'm not in love.

523
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,257
So, money?

524
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,064
Yeah, money fills that void.

525
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,138
You know the FBI can't come up
with that kind of money.

526
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:51,605
Not in the time frame you gave them.
You're setting them up to fail.

527
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:55,439
I never leave a job unfinished.
Panama is unfinished.

528
00:46:56,513 --> 00:47:00,279
Why aren't you wondering
how long before I blow up the house?

529
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,451
Unless... Wait.
How did we do it before?

530
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,989
You shoot the FBI lady, she dies, you live.

531
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,619
Well, it might be unfair
to make you kill a woman.

532
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,198
But then again, you have experience.

533
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,562
So, come on. Let's do it, Tom.

534
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:21,700
-Shoot her.
-Get out of the house. Get out of the house!

535
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,706
I'll spare you the routine.
Let's just count down from 10.

536
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,936
No, that's not gonna happen. Go, go, go!

537
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:31,446
Come on. She's practically a stranger
compared to your wife.

538
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,209
-Go! Move! Go!
-10, 9, 8,

539
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,841
-7, 6, 5...
-Go!

540
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,819
4, 3, 2. Boom!

541
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,283
I punked you, Tom.

542
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,116
You're so gullible.

543
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,991
That was fun.

544
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,566
Son of a bitch is always one step ahead.

545
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,347
There you go.

546
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,624
-Hello?
-Hello, Amy.

547
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,135
Now we're gonna be spending
some time together today.

548
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,637
-Who is this?
-Don't interrupt me.

549
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:35,033
And before you say another word,
I want you to walk to the corner of the bar.

550
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,238
There's flowers in that vase.

551
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:42,444
I want you to remove the flowers
as gently as possible.

552
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,149
And Amy, I can see you right now.

553
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,887
Don't panic.
The worst thing you can do is panic.

554
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:54,855
I have placed bombs
throughout the entire hotel.

555
00:48:56,266 --> 00:49:00,726
Don't cry.
If you do as I ask, I won't hurt you.

556
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,906
But you must keep your composure, Amy.
You understand?

557
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:10,573
Listen to me. Your customers
will start to worry if you cry.

558
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,280
Now, delicately remove the flowers, please.

559
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,546
Now, that black object
at the bottom of the vase

560
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,143
is a detonator.

561
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,923
The bomb will not explode
unless I choose to detonate.

562
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,822
Then why did I have to be careful
with the flowers?

563
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:28,557
Because they're pretty.
The entire floor is covered in explosives.

564
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,197
I've just activated the locks on the door.

565
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:36,533
If you don't believe me, you can go
and check them yourself.

566
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:45,147
Would you do me a favor
and announce to everyone in the hotel

567
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,614
that we're in a hostage lockdown?

568
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:54,851
Tell them there's a bomb in the building,
and if they try to leave, I'll detonate.

569
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,156
Excuse me, everybody.

570
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,865
The hotel is currently under a bomb threat.

571
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,036
-Nobody's allowed to leave.
-What's going on?

572
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,867
There's a man on the phone.
He said that there's a bomb in the hotel.

573
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,702
-All right...
-I don't know what to do.

574
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:14,800
Just stay calm. Don't let anybody leave.
I'll call the police.

575
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,708
The doors are locked. You can't get out.

576
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,810
-It's locked!
-They're not listening to me.

577
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:26,412
Don't worry, Amy, they can't get out.
Eventually, they'll get tired.

578
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:29,986
I will contact the police soon.

579
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:34,393
But first, I want you to contact
the television lady, Julie Mulligan.

580
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:37,894
-The lady on Channel 15?
-That's right.

581
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:41,166
I like the idea of a pretty woman
giving bad news.

582
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,967
Tell Julie the hotel is under a bomb threat,

583
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:48,204
and that I personally requested her
to cover it.

584
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,747
Yeah, FBI Field Office,
Albuquerque, New Mexico. Thank you.

585
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,685
Hey. We just received an anonymous tip
about a possible car bomb

586
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,621
at the Nativo Hotel.

587
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,057
I was looking over the client list
for Sterling Cleaning Services.

588
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,527
Nativo Hotel is on that list.

589
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,154
Guess who's assigned to
the cleaning team?

590
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,630
-Who?
-Carl Mosler.

591
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,861
Shit. I just sent an officer over there.
Let's go.

592
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,407
Now, Amy, I'm going to need you
to go to the front door.

593
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:21,739
There's a black Beemer on the east
side of the hotel. Do you see it?

594
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,305
Yes, I see it.

595
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,314
Now, it won't be long
before the FBI arrives.

596
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,941
When they do, let me know.

597
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:36,190
I got a really bad feeling
about this.

598
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:40,296
The police just got here.

599
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,734
That fucking rookie!
What the hell is he doing?

600
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,967
Get away from the car!

601
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:56,844
Get in there. Put him out!
Put him out!

602
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,175
Put him out! Beat him out!

603
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,146
Did the car explode?

604
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:04,012
Yes. I think it killed a police officer.

605
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,949
Hello? Anybody home?

606
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,124
Amy, I'm gonna call you back.

607
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,193
Hello?

608
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,160
Buy everyone a drink on me.
It should calm their nerves.

609
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,237
Hello?

610
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,749
Anybody home?

611
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,831
-Are you Skittles?
-Yeah.

612
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,601
Very nice to meet you.

613
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:09,609
In the tub.

614
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,781
Get on your knees.

615
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:17,086
What's going on?
Please don't kill me. Please.

616
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:21,157
Say cheese.

617
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,725
Hi. Is this your informant?

618
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,395
See you soon.

619
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,437
Are you afraid of me?

620
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,065
Yeah.

621
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:38,841
Then nothing will happen to you.
Everything you need is on that cot.

622
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,759
Hi, Amy, I'm back.

623
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,199
Julie Mulligan is here.

624
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,599
You've done everything I've asked.

625
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:04,071
So as soon as you give the phone
to Miss Mulligan,

626
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,233
you get out of there as fast as you can.

627
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:09,210
And if anyone tries to escape,
I'll blow up the building.

628
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,746
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

629
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,374
You still have much to contribute
to the world, so let's finish this.

630
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,545
The information
we have at the moment is sketchy,

631
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:24,457
but it appears that a man has somehow
seized control of the Nativo Hotel.

632
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,197
He only wants to speak to you.

633
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:35,668
I've just been given a cell phone
from a person who works inside the hotel.

634
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,299
It seems that the man in question
is expected to call me.

635
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,575
-Hello.
-Hello, Miss Mulligan.

636
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,783
Please listen to me carefully.

637
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,785
Listen. We can't allow this to be broadcast.

638
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,445
The FBI does not allow a criminal

639
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:55,080
to broadcast public grievances
as part of negotiations.

640
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:58,058
We aren't negotiating,
I'm telling you what to do.

641
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,425
Now, you're familiar with my file.

642
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,964
I have rigged the hotel
with enough explosive

643
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,761
to destroy the city block.

644
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,564
You do as I instruct,

645
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:11,300
or I will detonate this bomb
and I will make sure

646
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:16,710
that the families of the victims know
their loved ones died in vain

647
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,680
because Special Agent in Charge
William Hopter

648
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,013
could not follow simple instructions.

649
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,177
Now, please put Miss Mulligan
back on the line

650
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,881
and don't try to trace this call.

651
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,623
Thank you.

652
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,499
I think the terrorist is about to tell me
what's gonna happen to the hostages.

653
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:42,595
Terrorist? No, no, Miss Mulligan, please,
do not lump me into that crowd.

654
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:44,331
I'm a thief.

655
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:49,871
I'm sorry. The man in question
claims he's not a terrorist. He's a thief.

656
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,907
Julie, do me a favor,
hit the speaker button.

657
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,885
I'd like to get this on TV.
I promise not to say bad words.

658
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,480
Come on, Julie. Put him on.

659
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,559
Tom! So, tell me,

660
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,962
what is it like sitting there

661
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:12,728
knowing that all of those innocent people
are about to die?

662
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:18,697
You better answer my questions,
or I'm gonna put that hotel into orbit.

663
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,174
Have the FBI complied with my demands?

664
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,013
Sir? Detective?

665
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,741
-I heard him.
-Did...

666
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:33,286
Yeah. Yeah, the money's ready to be wired.

667
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,849
We have a web page set up
for you to verify.

668
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,758
You know that that web page is a dummy.

669
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:43,663
And the moment that I log on,
the Feds will trace my location.

670
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,629
Do these guys have any intention
of wiring the money?

671
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,729
I can't speak for the FBI.

672
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,968
Yeah, but you know the answer,
so answer the question.

673
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:59,572
The FBI cannot negotiate the terms
that you are demanding.

674
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,811
We are, however,
open to an alternate discussion.

675
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,148
Tom, I don't do alternate discussions.

676
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,784
The FBI needs to understand
how fucking serious I am.

677
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,524
They leave me no choice but to detonate.

678
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:18,999
I'm sorry, sir, I have to turn off the speaker.
I'll continue to translate for you,

679
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,036
but, at this time, I don't think
it's in the best interests...

680
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,298
Shut up. What are you, stupid?

681
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:26,637
You do as I ask.
This is the biggest break in your career.

682
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:32,147
Now, I'll contact the FBI in 48 hours and
give them a chance to wire the money.

683
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:37,410
Seems that this is the first lesson.
It won't be the last.

684
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:41,880
And because of this inconvenience,
I want $200 million.

685
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:47,857
He wants $200 million. Today is a lesson.

686
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:52,600
If the money's not available in 48 hours,
there will be another lesson.

687
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,968
Say the words,
"The FBI caused this building to explode."

688
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,907
The FBI caused the hotel to explode.

689
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,261
Honey, I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

690
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,459
I'm not going to kill her. You are.

691
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,642
Hey. You've been sleeping
for 19 straight hours.

692
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,220
I was worried.

693
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,516
-How's Amy?
-She's good. We have her in a safe house.

694
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,453
Hopter?

695
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:56,663
He's fine. He's got a few cuts and bruises,

696
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,832
but he'll be all right.

697
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,430
Anyone else make it out of the hotel?

698
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,063
No.

699
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:10,405
Christ.

700
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:15,040
I don't think I can do this anymore.

701
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,551
I hesitate.

702
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,747
I don't trust my instincts.

703
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:25,527
I'm no use like this.

704
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,255
That's not true.

705
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:29,962
I'm not working with you out of pity.

706
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,398
Everybody at the hotel...

707
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,268
My wife...

708
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,632
It's 'cause of what I do.

709
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,904
Don't.

710
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:45,677
You know, she worked 2 jobs
when I was at the Academy,

711
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:47,647
to make ends meet.

712
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,343
I don't know, she was the one
that made all the sacrifices.

713
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,881
Doesn't really matter.
There was nothing I could do.

714
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:04,960
It happened, and there's nothing you can do
to change it,

715
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,127
but you did save 10 lives that night.

716
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,531
Don't forget that.

717
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:14,642
And now you have the opportunity
to make things as right as they can be.

718
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,369
I'm not doing this without you, Tom.

719
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:22,610
You were there at the beginning,
and you should be there at the end.

720
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,920
You come up with anything?

721
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:11,528
Well, if he did use fertilizer,
it had to be underneath the floor.

722
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:14,228
Flower pots aren't big enough
to make the hotel explode like that.

723
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,999
Which makes sense,
since he used a PETN grout mix.

724
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,232
PETNs would've made the kick.

725
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,536
So he used specialized grout
when he laid the floor tile?

726
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:21,667
Yeah.

727
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,746
I asked for all the hardware receipts
from around town.

728
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,747
See if I can pick up any odd pairings
in purchases of tile and grout.

729
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,340
It's gonna take me a few days
to get all the receipts back,

730
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,852
but I do have one receipt

731
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,684
from Rack's Hardware Store
that is interesting.

732
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,190
What they did is they isolated it down

733
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,624
to the amount of tile and grout
it would take to cover the floor.

734
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,252
Then they divided that into 2 categories,

735
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,490
those paid by credit card,
those paid by cash.

736
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:43,587
How many paid with cash?

737
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,692
For that amount of tile and grout
in the last month, 14.

738
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,998
These are shots from
the hardware store's security cam.

739
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:54,137
This man seen here buying tile,
grout, and patio cleaner is the target.

740
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:58,475
Parking lot cam footage shows him
leaving in a black Ford F-150.

741
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,141
These are shots of the Nativo Lodge
taken from across the street.

742
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,342
We believe it's the same man.

743
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,420
His walking manner and gait
have been determined to be the same.

744
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,088
Go back to the hardware store
parking lot, the exterior.

745
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,086
There, stop. Yeah.

746
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,357
A police officer issuing a citation.
See if you can get the dash cam.

747
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,829
May be able to
pick up a plate on that truck.

748
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:19,095
That's great. Get on that, will you?
That's it, people.

749
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,670
Skittles, you didn't pass your polygraph.

750
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:25,138
I don't know how.
I'm telling you the truth. I...

751
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,436
Something's gotta be wrong
with your machine.

752
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,569
It says you're a confidential informant
for APD

753
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:34,073
and that The Lion offered you a job,
but you turned it down.

754
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,447
This statement didn't pass poly.

755
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,452
I told you guys everything I know.

756
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:41,614
I... I met this dude,
a real psycho case by the way,

757
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,885
and he offered me a job.

758
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,194
I went right to APD,
and I ain't even got my C.I. money yet.

759
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:50,356
What kind of job, Skittles?

760
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:55,666
He wanted me to help with the
assassination of Senator Cordero.

761
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,472
Ryan, call the senator's office.

762
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,067
Let him know
we suspect he might be the target

763
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,612
of an assassination attempt.

764
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,848
-Hello.
-Hey, Juan.

765
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,856
-I bet you know who this is.
-What do you want?

766
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:19,461
I want you to do
what you politicians do best.

767
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,890
Let's cut a back door deal.

768
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,626
You know
I can't give you $200 million.

769
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,760
Well, I know that.
Who needs that kind of money?

770
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,566
-So, give me 20.
-That's an insane amount of money.

771
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:35,872
It's your family's fortune,
and 20 million is a drop in the bucket.

772
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:41,678
And in exchange, I leave Albuquerque alone
and you get to save your political future.

773
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,614
Now, I've placed 80 bombs
around Albuquerque.

774
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,916
You pay me, you save the city.

775
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,391
The FBI released a report
that they are interested

776
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:55,726
in speaking with a man
who drives a black Ford F-150...

777
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,225
-Hey.
-...and a blue Ford Escort.

778
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,300
Hey.

779
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:02,865
Let the long trail of false leads begin.

780
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,165
What do you have there?

781
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:07,037
It's Sam Skittles'
polygraph results.

782
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:10,306
Some inconsistencies there.
Just about to go over them.

783
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:13,541
I know there's a clue in there
if I can find one.

784
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,177
I brought a snack, if you wanna join me.

785
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,014
It's from one of my favorite bakeries
in the world.

786
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,587
God, I can't.

787
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,217
Come on. I ain't gonna tell anybody.

788
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,919
Building's practically empty, anyways.

789
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,599
It's just us obsessives
in here at this hour.

790
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:35,962
-I've been on a diet since my divorce.
-I didn't even know you were married.

791
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:38,563
Yeah, in a former life.

792
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,710
Before I gave it all up for this.

793
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,447
I've always liked your wall of death, there.
It's nice.

794
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,451
Well, you know,
it's important in design to have a theme.

795
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,555
So, why'd you get divorced?
I mean, if you don't mind talking about it.

796
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,416
No, not at all. I was just too young.

797
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:02,562
It was hard for me
to be a good agent and a good wife.

798
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:06,958
I guess I just couldn't figure out
a way to balance the 2, you know?

799
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:11,438
And then one day,
I realized that I was a divorced workaholic.

800
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:16,235
-And I'm okay with that.
-You sure you're okay with that?

801
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:21,644
I am. I mean,
I hate to sound like a clich,

802
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:27,486
but the work we do here
makes the country a safer place.

803
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:33,084
And it's a sacrifice
that I'm willing to make.

804
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,834
I told you.

805
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,028
Yeah.

806
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,703
You know, it made me see
that you can give your life to your country

807
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:49,801
without actually dying for it.

808
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:51,277
You know, I guess some day,

809
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,541
I would like to have a husband
and some kids.

810
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:57,813
But, I don't know,
I guess you can't have everything, right?

811
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:03,024
-What?
-No, nothing, I'm just...

812
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:06,893
Just thinking about
what you said, you know?

813
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,128
It's always the people
who sacrifice the most

814
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:12,462
that actually deserve the most.
It's sad but true, you know?

815
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,613
What is it?

816
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,314
Are you hungry?

817
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:38,647
-Yeah.
-Yeah, me, too.

818
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,447
Why don't we go get something to eat?

819
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,924
We have to assume he's listening
to everything we say inside that building.

820
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,020
So this is how he's been a step ahead of us
from the beginning,

821
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,395
-and how he knows everything we do.
-Yeah, looks that way.

822
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,934
All right, well, the video
from the cop's dashboard cam

823
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:57,233
gave us a shot of the plate,
but can only make out 725.

824
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,333
This is for the press release.

825
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:01,802
Okay, so we're gonna do a sweep
of the entire building

826
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,401
for weapons or bombs.
We just have to make sure

827
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,809
The Lion doesn't get wind
of what we're up to.

828
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,181
Hey, baby, how you doing?

829
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:12,879
<i>Hey, Agent Alba.</i>

830
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,512
Who the fuck is this?

831
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:16,887
<i>I've got somebody who wants to say hi.
Hold on.</i>

832
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:18,892
Daddy.

833
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:23,932
Amy?

834
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,457
You fucking touch her, I swear to you...

835
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,936
No, no.
She's in my protective custody now.

836
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,565
I just need you to help close Panama.

837
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,267
<i>What the fuck is Panama?</i>

838
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,972
See, you made her all upset.

839
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:48,054
Hey, Ryan, what's up?

840
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:51,155
Nothing, man. I'm just...
I'm just tired, you know?

841
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,023
It's just tomorrow
is The Lion's deadline, you know?

842
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,756
-We're gonna get him, you know.
-Yeah.

843
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:57,128
Be nice to scoop him up tonight,
but we're gonna get him.

844
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:00,202
He was in the FBI building, so he had to
go through a background check.

845
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:02,862
We know what his name is now.
We know who he is.

846
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,964
Just a matter of time
before we know where he is.

847
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,372
I hope so.

848
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:12,344
The Lion's name is David Kaplow.

849
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:16,946
How do we know?

850
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:19,020
Finally got through the records
of the night cleaning crew.

851
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,988
Turns out that he worked in this office
about 6 months ago as a janitor.

852
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,958
Had to use his real name
to get through the background check.

853
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,049
Downtown's running the books

854
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:29,256
for any additional numbers,
contacts, addresses.

855
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,758
As soon as we get the approval
from home base, run a release.

856
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:35,302
Name and face, guys. We're gaining on him.

857
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:39,235
-Yeah.
-Hello, Tom.

858
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,538
You know, it must kill you to know
you've been this close to me

859
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:45,341
and yet you still have
nothing to show for it.

860
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:46,914
I'm closer to you than you think.

861
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,541
You know, I don't like
your tone of voice right now, Tom.

862
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,177
-You can't catch me.
-I will find you.

863
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:55,917
Fella, you must've sucked down
too many tequilas down there in Mexico.

864
01:09:56,225 --> 01:10:00,025
I made you kill your wife
and blew up that hotel right in front of you.

865
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:02,097
I even pissed in your fishbowl.

866
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:04,865
I'm gonna hurt you, Tom.

867
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:08,494
I know about your new girlfriend.
I guess you're out of mourning.

868
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:13,268
I'm gonna make it long and painful
for your little chiquita.

869
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:16,072
I mean, how much more
do I have to take from you?

870
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:17,941
You're not taking anything from me again.

871
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:21,483
Fuck you, Tom.
You want to escalate things? Fine.

872
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:22,676
Tom, here's the number.

873
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:25,720
You can't catch me. I'm invisible.

874
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:31,086
I know your name, Kaplow.
I got a photograph of your face.

875
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:33,828
When that picture
hits the airways in 20 minutes,

876
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,329
the whole world's gonna know who you are.

877
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,093
Your life is over.

878
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,702
The gap is closing, motherfucker.

879
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,781
A lawyer representing David Kaplow
just called the office.

880
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:01,151
Kaplow has agreed
to turn himself in at 2:00 p.m.,

881
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,622
and he's agreed to give us the location

882
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,455
of half the bombs he claims
he's placed throughout the city.

883
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:09,019
He'll do this if the DA agrees
not to seek the death penalty.

884
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,098
The DA has agreed.

885
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,325
Well, that sounds like a setup.

886
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,367
I know. I don't understand it, either.

887
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:17,769
We have 143 active leads
regarding Kaplow's truck and sedan.

888
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,998
I want all agents back here
by 1:00 p.m., though,

889
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,670
'cause I wouldn't be surprised
if Kaplow decides to walk in here

890
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,145
with C-4 strapped to his chest.

891
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,987
Get strike teams positioned at
every corner surrounding the building.

892
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,524
I want no vehicles within 100 yards.

893
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,254
Tell them we'll brief the press
as soon as Kaplow is safely inside.

894
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:41,590
Let's go.

895
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:50,804
Is that Skittles' polygraph?

896
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:53,773
These results
are just so inconsistent.

897
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,007
Listen to these questions.
"Did you meet with The Lion?"

898
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:57,635
Answer, "Yes." That was true.

899
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,112
"Did The Lion offer you a job?"
"Yes." That was true.

900
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,110
"Did you refuse the job?"
"Yes." That is false.

901
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,913
"Is The Lion planning
to assassinate Senator Cordero?"

902
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,612
"Yes." That's true.

903
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,520
"Are you informing on The Lion?"
Answer, "Yes."

904
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,789
That's false.

905
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,293
The only way
to logically piece this together

906
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,363
is to imagine that he paid Skittles
to come here and tell us

907
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:16,863
that he was gonna kill the senator.

908
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,694
But there'd be no advantage in that.

909
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:22,601
I don't get it. Makes no sense.
We know his name now, though.

910
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:24,195
So, we track his whereabouts,
compare that

911
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:26,331
to the whereabouts
we have in The Lion file,

912
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,842
his airline information.
We know he was in Columbia and Panama

913
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:31,606
4 months ago.
Wait and see what the CIA has.

914
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:34,646
And Panama keeps popping up. It's Hops.

915
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,047
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

916
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:40,685
No. It's not a problem.

917
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,956
I'm going that way anyway.
All right.

918
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,958
A self storage garage manager called,
said he saw the press release.

919
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:51,055
A guy who fits the description
is renting a storage unit from him.

920
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,033
I have to go check it out. Call me
if anything interesting happens, okay?

921
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,194
Will do. Be careful.

922
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:56,498
Will do.

923
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,737
<i>Okay, Senator,
I've got the first half of the money.</i>

924
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,108
<i>We're in business.</i>

925
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,476
Where's the list?

926
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:08,641
<i>I am e-mailing you 40 addresses.</i>

927
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:12,312
<i>Now, after you verify
that they're legitimate,</i>

928
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:16,881
<i>wire the other $10 million
and I'll give you the last 40 addresses.</i>

929
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,062
-Hi. How are you?
-Hi. Can I help you?

930
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,264
Isabel Ordonez, FBI.

931
01:13:58,534 --> 01:13:59,762
Great.

932
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:02,260
Thanks for coming so quickly.

933
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:06,671
I'm Clyde.
It's nice to meet you.

934
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:12,512
I swear, as soon as I saw the picture on TV,
I knew it was the guy. It's this way.

935
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,775
It kind of freaked me out, you know?

936
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:16,316
Yeah, I know.

937
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:20,588
He's been in and out a lot lately.
Strange.

938
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,148
He's a strange fella.

939
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:26,716
And he drives the same kind of truck
I saw on the news.

940
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:30,026
So, I figured I'd call
and let you folks know.

941
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,431
Anyway, I hope I did the right thing,
you know?

942
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,059
You did, and we appreciate
your assistance.

943
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:38,298
Sometimes, I think he even sleeps here,
at night.

944
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:42,638
It's number 26, here.
Would you hold that for a minute?

945
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,505
Tom, get me LEU, Forensics, and backup.

946
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,642
-What's this?
-Hey!

947
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,883
-Put that down!
-I'm sorry.

948
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,046
-Don't touch anything!
-Won't touch it.

949
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:30,283
Tom, this is his storage unit.
No doubt about it.

950
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:33,695
I'm window shopping
at Bomb Depot as we speak.

951
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,056
What do you guys have?

952
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,491
Well, I just got off the phone with the CIA.

953
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,727
We were able to trace
Kaplow's location in South America

954
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,531
by comparing his information

955
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,538
with the information
we compiled on The Lion.

956
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,437
Every time that he took a job
to assassinate somebody,

957
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,705
he named that job after the city
or the country where he was hired.

958
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:52,336
So, "Panama" means
he was hired in Panama.

959
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,176
Well, the CIA seems to think
that he was hired

960
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:57,741
by a Panamanian drug lord named Zambada

961
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:00,583
to assassinate somebody
inside the United States.

962
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,122
I brought up Cordero's name,

963
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,590
and they started looking at
his time spent with the DEA.

964
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:07,253
He definitely had the biggest impact
on the Panama cartel.

965
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,762
I think Cordero was the Panama job.

966
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:12,660
So, he's here for unfinished business.

967
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,469
Tom, let me call you back.

968
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:20,836
Local, this is Agent Ordonez.
Connect me to Galactic Cable management.

969
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:28,210
So, do you think you got him?

970
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,476
I mean, he's an artist.

971
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:35,884
The beards and mustaches.

972
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:40,121
I mean, he probably had
all kinds of different identities.

973
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:03,515
I got the front. Check in
when you cover the side and rear.

974
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:05,877
West side covered.

975
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,849
<i>South side covered.</i>

976
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:12,426
All 3 exits covered.

977
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:14,920
Agent Alba.

978
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,624
The addresses checked out.
They're recovering the bombs now.

979
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:20,361
-However, you're still in danger.
-Why?

980
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:24,303
8 years ago, Kaplow was hired to kill you,
when you were with the DEA.

981
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:27,166
Now he's back to finish the job.

982
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,874
Karen, wire the second half
of the money, please.

983
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,243
-Yes, sir.
-And send in my security detail.

984
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:34,576
Yes, sir.

985
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,742
-Thank you, Agent.
-Yes, sir.

986
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:43,817
Tom, we swept the building.
The guys didn't find anything.

987
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:47,990
You're not gonna detect C-4 with a scan.
You gotta find that stuff visually.

988
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:49,620
I know he has us here for a reason.

989
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:53,189
We did floor-to-ceiling searches.
The desks were the only breach.

990
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:55,997
He always does one thing to hide another.

991
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:59,401
We checked the desks
as soon as we found the bugs.

992
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,740
Kaplow hired Skittles
to pretend to be an informant.

993
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:07,938
He's trying to draw out this investigation,
is what he's trying to do.

994
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,109
What the hell are you getting at?

995
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,686
Say, you normally have this many
heavy hitters in the same building?

996
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:15,814
No. ATF and LEU move in today
as part of The Lion Task Force.

997
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,017
We'll have the entire force
operating under the same roof.

998
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:28,733
My God!

999
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:35,843
He's trying to get rid of all his enemies
in one shot, right here in this building.

1000
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:40,005
If every desk is packed with this much C-4,
it's enough to level this building twice.

1001
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:42,745
Let's get out of here.

1002
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:45,717
Kaplow, your lawyer just arrived.

1003
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:47,617
Hold it!

1004
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:51,090
<i>Good.We have everyone
where we want them.</i>

1005
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:52,751
<i>No one leaves alive.</i>

1006
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,196
Copy that.

1007
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:59,166
Move quickly but carefully.

1008
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:01,599
Grab your files if you can.
We only have 10 minutes to clear.

1009
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,636
Hello. What?

1010
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,503
Kaplow's lawyer showed, but not Kaplow.

1011
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,976
-He's fucking with us.
-No shit.

1012
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,427
Sniper!

1013
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,327
Inside! Inside!

1014
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,710
All right, let's get him down the hall.
Let's try the other door.

1015
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:50,309
Come on, Hops.
Hang in there. Hang in there.

1016
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:54,250
Get a car to this east door, right now!

1017
01:19:57,726 --> 01:20:00,024
Shit. That son of a bitch!

1018
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:01,957
They must have all exits covered.

1019
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:03,496
All right, we got 8 minutes.
What are we gonna do?

1020
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:07,430
All right, get his vest off. Now.
Somebody, lose a T-shirt if you have to,

1021
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:09,060
to keep pressure on this wound.

1022
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,036
Hit the break room, grab me a bag of sugar.

1023
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,073
I'll hit Forensics, grab a bag of saltpeter.
Meet back here.

1024
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,699
We're gonna build some cover
to get out of here.

1025
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:45,564
Yeah?

1026
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:04,992
If you move... Understand, if you move,
I'll blow your brains out.

1027
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,920
We're gonna go in the house, inside.

1028
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:13,091
Get up. You had a little too much to drink,
or I'll break your arm.

1029
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,361
Get up.

1030
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,498
We're gonna walk inside.

1031
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,070
Help me. Let's go.

1032
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:40,055
21 confirmed bombings, 18 murders...

1033
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,152
<i>So, what's the status, Agent Alba?</i>

1034
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:44,129
The senator's secure.
What about over there?

1035
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:47,099
<i>Amy's fine.
When I get word you completed your task,</i>

1036
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,397
<i>as promised, I will let her go.</i>

1037
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,267
Get over here with the sugar.

1038
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:58,845
-This is a bomb?
-50/50, equal parts.

1039
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:01,142
-Wrap it up. Just follow me.
-We only have 5 minutes.

1040
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,409
What are you doing?

1041
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:06,817
This is the fuse. Right here.
Somebody's got to... Give me a bag.

1042
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:10,289
Gonna be a smoke screen.
It's gonna give us plenty of cover.

1043
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:12,924
When these things go off,
don't waste any time looking around.

1044
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:15,357
We only have a few minutes.

1045
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:18,765
-Ryan, listen, I'm...
-Are we close to getting him?

1046
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:22,359
No. The whole place is wired with bombs.
Hops has been shot.

1047
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:26,429
-I'm sorry, Tommy, I don't have a choice.
-What are you talking about, Ryan?

1048
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:29,237
I made a deal with him.
She's my little girl, man.

1049
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,209
Ryan, you get it fucking together.

1050
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,339
I know how you felt that night
in the basement.

1051
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:37,109
He's got me in the same place.

1052
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:40,312
I can't let him take my little girl, Tommy.

1053
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:41,852
I'm sorry.

1054
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,614
Ryan...

1055
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,689
All right, let's go. Who's got the light?

1056
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:54,502
Are you all right, Agent Alba? Agent?

1057
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:58,094
Yeah, it's...

1058
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,230
It's a family issue.

1059
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,699
He doing all right?

1060
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:05,675
Stay with us, Hops.

1061
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,586
All right, guys, 2 more of these.
Let's get ready to go.

1062
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:19,387
Get ready to move him.
Get ready to move him, on my count.

1063
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:22,357
Hops, you hear?

1064
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,795
They're coming out the front.

1065
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:30,737
All right, guys, one more, one more,
one more. Get him ready to go.

1066
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,602
Get him ready to move.

1067
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,004
All right guys, are we ready?

1068
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:42,180
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!
Straight to the truck! To the truck!

1069
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,676
Get in the back! Let's go!

1070
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:07,908
Son of a bitch!

1071
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,901
Armstrong got away. He's on the move.

1072
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:29,459
-Yeah, Isabel, where...
-Hi, Tom. I'm with that nice FBI lady.

1073
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:33,666
We're throwing a party.
You know the place. Bring ice.

1074
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:34,735
Son of a bitch.

1075
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,564
...number here.

1076
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,583
I need help! Senator's down!
Senator's down!

1077
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:58,090
Send me an ambulance!

1078
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:05,863
<i>I just got word Cordero
and Alba are dead.</i>

1079
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,127
<i>Panama's closed.</i>

1080
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:08,862
-Is it confirmed?
-Yes.

1081
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,028
<i>What do you want me to do
with Alba's daughter?</i>

1082
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:11,162
Let her go.

1083
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:40,290
That's right, Tom. You know where to go.

1084
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:42,998
Old habits die hard.

1085
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,805
You know what to do.

1086
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:54,113
You could save yourself
like you did 8 years ago.

1087
01:25:57,318 --> 01:26:00,253
Or you could come down
and try to save your girlfriend.

1088
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:03,890
Come on.

1089
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,960
I can't shoot you if I can't see you.

1090
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:12,461
5 minutes, Tom.

1091
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:14,562
If we wait longer than that,

1092
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:18,105
you'll need a broom and a shovel
to peel this kid up.

1093
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:21,431
I've already called for backup.
You want a way out of here,

1094
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:24,034
we don't have much time
to come to an agreement.

1095
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,940
Well, 4 and a half minutes, to be exact.

1096
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:29,781
You know what? The hell with it.

1097
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:32,409
Come down.
You got 5 seconds or I kill her.

1098
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:41,158
That's it. That's good.
I'm not gonna hurt you, Tom.

1099
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,628
Come out. Nice and easy.

1100
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:47,430
Would you throw that down now?
Nice and easy.

1101
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:50,834
Okay. That's good.

1102
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:55,172
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Now kick that over, please, Tom.

1103
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:56,844
Attaboy.

1104
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:01,940
I lied.

1105
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:11,492
Now that's got to hurt.

1106
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:18,718
I'll cut her.

1107
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:22,292
I don't want to fight anymore.

1108
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,891
Boy, you throw a hell of a punch.

1109
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:29,168
Now, do me a favor.
Put your cuffs on.

1110
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:31,670
Put your cuffs on, or I'll cut her throat.

1111
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,707
Put them on. Attaboy.

1112
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:39,010
Nice and tight, Tommy. That's it.

1113
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:45,078
Good. The other one, please?

1114
01:28:45,186 --> 01:28:47,245
Let me see. Open hands.

1115
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:50,283
Very good. Good.

1116
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:55,128
Don't cry. You're gonna be okay.

1117
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,998
It's over soon. I gotta run.

1118
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:03,194
You know you're gonna get shot
as soon as you walk out that door.

1119
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:07,570
Give me the vest.

1120
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:19,853
Thanks, Tommy.

1121
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:48,839
-Get on the ground, now!
-I'm on the job!

1122
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:50,178
-On the ground!
-Yes, sir.

1123
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:54,084
No, don't shoot. I'm on the job.
I got an officer down. I'm FBI.

1124
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:57,680
There's a woman in critical.
We need to call for backup, 911.

1125
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:00,443
-What?
-Hello, David.

1126
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,852
Tom, I am incredibly impressed.

1127
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,189
How did you beat the clock?

1128
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:16,631
-This ends now.
-And how do you plan on doing that?

1129
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:21,371
I live. You die.

1130
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,671
<i>How's the vest fit?</i>

1131
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:50,161
When did you rig the car?

1132
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:52,103
I didn't.

1133
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,536
I rigged the vest.

1134
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,878
I was gonna take him out with me.

1135
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,752
I'm glad the plan changed.

1136
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:14,558
So am I.
