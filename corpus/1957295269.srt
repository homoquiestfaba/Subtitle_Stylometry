356
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,126
When I grew up in China
I felt like an alien.

357
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,029
People around me and nobody
understand what I do.

358
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:40,133
Nobody appreciative
of what I do.

359
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,036
They don't understand
Grateful Dead.

360
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,040
Nine Inch Nails,
Allman Brothers, b... anyway.

361
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,743
So I feel like,
oh, I come to America.

362
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,077
I got a Green Card.

363
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,478
English named Andy.

364
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,347
But I feel more lonely
than before.

365
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,551
People around me also listen
to soulless, heartless music.

366
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,418
EDM, fuck that.

367
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,822
So I was like, ugh,
I'm going like a man on...

368
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:03,490
I'm like a man on an island.

369

370
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,193

After that I weep, weep, weep.

372
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,497
That's just too much weeping.

373

I stay long, eventually
they put me in Garden Oaks

Hey.

377
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,810
You look like the kind of guy
who could use a best friend.

378
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:25,613

I've been in many times.

382

This time I was just being loud.

383
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,390
I don't have anywhere
to live right now

384
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,593
so I just... I stay
with my sister sometimes

385

she just kicks me out.

386

And a few weeks ago
I had a cut on my foot

387
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:47,835
and the only place I could wash
it was in a drinking fountain.

388
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:50,304
So I was just minding my own
business washing my foot

00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,008
- You should've said it.
- Sh, sh.

712
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,544
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

713
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:59,179
And so later that night
I go home to tell my husband

714
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:02,550
about it and he's like "So what?
You believe in God now?"

715
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:07,387
And I'm like
"Yeah, I believe in God

716
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:08,756
and I believe he spoke to me."

717
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,391
- And you know what he said?
- Drink coke?

718
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:15,429
- No.
- Wait, drink Pepsi.

719
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:16,698
No.

720
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:18,298
He said the opposite.

721
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,300
You know, he blocked
that profane light

722
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:22,737
with God's light to tell me that
the life that I was leading

723
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:27,341
- was shit and I deserve better.
- Yeah, it makes sense.

724
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:29,711
That impetus that moment where
God showed himself to me

725
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:31,646
was real, I wasn't crazy
in that moment.

726
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,380
It's just, you know,
when I told people

727
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:35,683
I... I think I shouted it.

728
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:38,285
Yeah, it's like a passionate
thing to say, right.

729

I shouted a lot of things.

730

most of the time

733
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:50,197
and then I just... I don't know,

734
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,734
I just kind of lost it

Don't let her get up
on her high horse.

1061

1062

a little Martian milk for you.

Thank you.

1070

Let me tell you something.

1071
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:29,651
I got in a huge fight
with Bonnie about you.

1072
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:31,118
What do you mean? How so?

1073
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:33,354
So basically
she gave me a show...

1074
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:34,888
how do you say, showdown?

1075
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:35,956
Showdown.

1076
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:38,158
She gave me a showdown,
she's like,

1077
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:41,495
"Andy, it's you and me
or you with Bill."

1078
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:43,598
And then you just came
right over here?

1079
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:45,032
(Bill laughs)

1080
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:46,033
That's fuckin' awesome, dude.

1081
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:48,536
I'd have given anything
to see her expression.

1082
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,573
Was she just like,
"Oh, Andy, please stay with me?

1083
00:47:51,606 --> 00:47:53,907
I'm so sorry.
I love you, Andy.

1084
00:47:53,941 --> 00:47:55,042
I made a mistake."

1085
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,545
Fuck, Bill, I have to move out.

1086
00:47:57,579 --> 00:47:59,079

No, I decide to move out.

1088

This is your home, man.

- I know you're in love,

1094

from being part of it.

1095

1098

I fought with her, man.

1099
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:21,001
I'm serious, dude,
I can get her some flowers,

1100
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:23,404
bring some roses to her,
I can make things up to her.

1101

We'll drink these drinks,
we'll rest our big brains,

1107
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:37,351

with a new plan, okay?

1108

one who loves you even more

1109

- Seriously, late for Bonnie?

With you, when you're here,
I feel insane.

- I get it, okay, fine, fine,

1115

but she's not making you sane,
dude.

1116

1230
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:54,742
- Oh, no?
- Yeah, we're not.

1231
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:56,309
Okay, so she's already
out here, huh?

1232
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:58,245
She tucked in your cheek,
or has she got a string

1233
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,847
tied around your prick
and she's tugging on that?

1234
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:02,583
- Why'd you even come here?
- I came here because I love you

1235
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:04,919
and we have a really fucking
important bank robbery to do.

1236
00:53:04,952 --> 00:53:06,386
If you love me,
you'll leave me alone.

1237
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,454
That doesn't make sense.

1238
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:09,456
If you love someone,
you want to be around them.

1239
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:11,626
- That's the whole fucking point.
- I'm finally in love.

1240
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:13,460
- (unintelligible)
- You keep saying "love"

1241
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:15,596
so many fucking times,
it's lost all meaning.

1242
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:16,698
You love, love, love.

1243
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:17,832
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah?

1244
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,266
But I'm a part of it, Andy.

1245
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:20,434

a part of this.

1247
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:23,971
Yes, I am, okay?

1248
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:26,908
I don't care what you think
or what you're thinking now

1249
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:28,341
or what you thought.

1250
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,644
Open your heart to me.

1251
00:53:29,677 --> 00:53:32,345
Open your fucking heart to me
like we promised

1252
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:33,815
and talked about, Mommy.

1253
00:53:33,848 --> 00:53:34,982
- Do you remember?
- You're insane.

1254
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:35,950
I called the cops.

1255
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:38,251
Good, me and the boys in blue
go way back.

1256
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:39,721
I can't wait
for a little reunion.

1257
00:53:39,754 --> 00:53:41,689
Bring 'em on, bring 'em on,
let's see what happens.

1258
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:42,824
- Bill, Bill, Bill...
- Bullets!

1259
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:44,491
Bill, just leave,
don't go to jail.

1260
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,426
I'm not going to jail,
I didn't do anything.

1261
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,428
Look at that,
you're breaking and entering!

1262
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,464
- You also assault me.
- Assault?

1263
00:53:50,497 --> 00:53:52,332
You ever think maybe
I'm trying to just open up

1264
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:54,267
a fucking third eye
on your head, huh, huh?

1265
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:56,336
- You think that maybe, huh?
- Hey, stop.

1266
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,539
- She needs to see God again.
- Don't point your finger at me.

1267
00:53:58,573 --> 00:53:59,841
She needs a place
where she can see God.

1268
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:02,342
This is the kind of insane talk
that I don't want to be around.

1269
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,344
That's the kind of talk you need
'cause you need to see God

1270
00:54:04,377 --> 00:54:05,880
and you've been thinking it
since I met you.

1271
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:07,582
I can see it
in your fucking eyes,

1272
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,282
there's no God here.

1273
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:10,618
- What?
- You leave.

1274
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:12,019
- I leave?
- Yeah, you showed who you are

1275
00:54:12,053 --> 00:54:13,755
you made her upset,
I don't want...

1276
00:54:13,788 --> 00:54:16,456
Oh, look at you,
Mr. Fucking Calm, huh?

1277
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:18,325
You remember who used
to pet your head, huh,

1278
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:20,327
when you were all suicidal
and crying?

1279
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,963
- Who did that?
- It's not like that anymore.

1280
00:54:21,996 --> 00:54:23,497
- It's not, no?
- It's not like that anymore.

1281
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:25,499
Yeah, 'cause you get one sip
of the golden cup,

1282
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:27,602

you have everything figured out.

That's rhapsody.

1286
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:35,576
- Stop! Bill, stop.
- Listen,

1287
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,444
you really want me
to fucking leave, huh?

1288
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:38,579
- Yup.
- You want me to leave?

1289
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:39,747
- Yeah, do you?
- Please leave.

1290
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:41,783
Okay, look me in the eyes,
tell me you don't love me.

1291
00:54:41,816 --> 00:54:42,850
- I don't love you.
- Okay, fine.

1292

- I fucking hate you.

No love?

1577
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:37,244
Come.

1578
01:09:38,746 --> 01:09:40,915
(knocking)

1579
01:09:40,948 --> 01:09:42,215
What was that?

1580
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:44,484
(sighs)

1581
01:09:47,454 --> 01:09:49,289
Come here, I think it's Sam.

1582
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:51,926
Sam?

1583
01:09:51,959 --> 01:09:53,460
Fuck, that's him.

1584
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:55,897
It's fucked now.

1585
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,699
All right, here's what we do.

1586
01:09:57,732 --> 01:09:59,266
- What?
- Listen, listen,

1587
01:09:59,299 --> 01:10:01,334
just stay totally quiet,
stay totally quiet.

1588
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:02,070
- Okay.
- Okay?

1589
01:10:02,103 --> 01:10:03,571
I'm just gonna wait out here,

1590
01:10:03,604 --> 01:10:05,907
so whenever you're ready
to talk, let me know.

1591
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,842
- I got cigarettes.
- Cigarettes!

1592
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,510
What do we do?

1593
01:10:09,544 --> 01:10:12,279
- You know what I say, Andy?
- You say shit all the time.

1594
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:15,382
I say if you see a snake
in the woods, gobble it up.

1595
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:17,484
Put that kid in the bathroom.

1596
01:10:18,753 --> 01:10:20,353
Go, go, go, stay inside.

1597
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:23,423
Your uncle Bill and Daddy
need to fight a monster.

1598
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:25,893
You want me to go
in the bathroom?

1599
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:32,332
(exhales)

1600
01:10:34,736 --> 01:10:36,269
- Hey.
- Bill?

1601
01:10:36,303 --> 01:10:38,539
Yeah, Beautiful Bill.
Come on in, come on in, dude.

1602
01:10:38,573 --> 01:10:39,540
(laughing)

1603
01:10:39,574 --> 01:10:40,407
Turn the fuck around.

1604
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,043
Put your hands
behind your back, now.

1605
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:43,376
Put your hands
behind your back.

1606
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,444
Why are you doing this?
I just...

1607
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:46,013
- I'm doing this because...
- There's no tr...

1608
01:10:46,047 --> 01:10:48,583
I don't know who...
hey, buddy, buddy, buddy.

1609
01:10:48,616 --> 01:10:51,586
I don't know who the fuck
you are, all right?

1610
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:52,787
Put your wrists together.

1611
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:53,921
Put them together.

1612
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:55,590
I...

1613
01:10:55,623 --> 01:10:57,424
- There you go.
- I just wanted to talk

1614
01:10:57,457 --> 01:10:58,325
to you guys.

1615
01:10:58,358 --> 01:11:00,061
Never been fucking
tied up before, huh?

1616
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:00,928
No.

1617
01:11:00,962 --> 01:11:02,797
Well, first time
for everything, bud.

1618
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:03,931
Turn the fuck around.

1619
01:11:03,965 --> 01:11:04,932
(grunts)

1620
01:11:04,966 --> 01:11:06,534
Huh, huh, huh?

1621
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:07,602
Look at me.

1622
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:09,070
What are you doing here?

1623
01:11:09,103 --> 01:11:11,005
- I just wanted to talk...
- What the fuck is this?

1624
01:11:11,038 --> 01:11:13,306
It's whiskey 'cause I wanted
to have a drink with you guys.

1625
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:14,407
No, that's poison,
all right?

1626
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:15,543
We're not drinking your poison,

1627
01:11:15,576 --> 01:11:18,012
and I'm not falling
for your fucking tricks, okay?

1628
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:19,847
- What's going on?
- I know that

1629
01:11:19,881 --> 01:11:21,314
you took George, all right?

1630
01:11:21,348 --> 01:11:22,817
Bullshit, that did not happen.

1631
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:23,951
We did not take George.

1632
01:11:23,985 --> 01:11:25,553
I don't even know who that is.

1633
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:26,954
(chuckling)

1634
01:11:26,988 --> 01:11:28,823
I know you took him,
and I understand.

1635
01:11:28,856 --> 01:11:30,423
If I was in your position,

1636
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:32,760
I'd probably do the same thing,
okay?

1637
01:11:32,794 --> 01:11:34,394
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1638
01:11:34,427 --> 01:11:35,863
If you will just listen to me.

1639
01:11:35,897 --> 01:11:38,032
I basically just wanted
to kind of lay things out

1640
01:11:38,065 --> 01:11:40,500
from a different perspective
and have a rational conversation

1641
01:11:40,535 --> 01:11:41,602
without this shit going on.

1642
01:11:41,636 --> 01:11:42,770
What, this shit?

1643
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:44,005
This isn't a boardroom, okay?

1644
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:45,640
We're not a couple
of your investors,

1645
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:46,741
and we're not gonna watch

1646
01:11:46,774 --> 01:11:47,942
a friffin'
PowerPoint presentation

1647
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:50,343
on how you're some kind
of man of the hour, get that?

1648
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:51,579
I'm not trying to talk
like that,

1649
01:11:51,612 --> 01:11:53,480
- I'm not trying to sound...
- You are talking like that,

1650
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:54,916
you're sounding like
a fucking fake.

1651
01:11:54,949 --> 01:11:55,983
- Okay...
- Do you get it?

1652
01:11:56,017 --> 01:11:57,417
I'm not trying to sound phony.

1653
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:58,318
I'm sorry, I'm just nervous.

1654
01:11:58,351 --> 01:12:00,021
What do you expect with
a gun in my face?

1655
01:12:00,054 --> 01:12:01,622
What do I expect?
I expect behavior.

1656
01:12:01,656 --> 01:12:02,757
I expect compliance.

1657
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,058
Andy, you can vouch for me.

1658
01:12:04,091 --> 01:12:05,358
I don't know you.

1659
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:06,727
We know each other a little bit.

1660
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:08,062
Now you think I'm important?

1661
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:09,797
Now you're asking me for help?

1662
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:10,898
You ruined my life.

1663
01:12:10,932 --> 01:12:12,399
You ruined his fucking life.

1664
01:12:12,432 --> 01:12:13,868
Look, you know me...
you know me a little bit...

1665
01:12:13,901 --> 01:12:15,570
- I don't know you.
- It's nothing personal.

1666
01:12:15,603 --> 01:12:17,470
No, no, Andy does,
and you, I know...

1667
01:12:17,505 --> 01:12:18,940
I know about you
from stories.

1668
01:12:18,973 --> 01:12:21,008
Yeah? What kinda stories?
Horror stories?

1669
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:23,443
And now you walked into one,
ding-dong.

1670
01:12:23,476 --> 01:12:25,478
You don't need to do this,
all I wanted to do

1671
01:12:25,513 --> 01:12:27,582
was just come here and show you
I'm a good, honest person.

1672
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:30,017
That's, you know, we're gonna be
the judge of who you are.

1673
01:12:30,051 --> 01:12:31,786
Sam, where'd you get
all your money?

1674
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:33,721
Why you are so rich?
Where's your money from?

1675
01:12:33,754 --> 01:12:34,822
Where's your fucking money from?

1676
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:36,423
From... just from tech.

1677
01:12:36,456 --> 01:12:37,792
Technology, technology.

1678
01:12:37,825 --> 01:12:38,926
That's fucking boring.

1679
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,928
Fine, it's boring,
but you know, it doesn't matter

1680
01:12:40,962 --> 01:12:43,130
'cause there's two things
that can happen now, all right?

1681
01:12:43,164 --> 01:12:45,465
One, the cops can get involved
if you guys keep this up

1682
01:12:45,498 --> 01:12:48,135
and Bonnie flips out and then
you never see George again,

1683
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:50,104
but there's the other option,
if you listen to me,

1684
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:52,173
where you give me George
and I put him back in bed,

1685
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:54,508
I get him home real quick
before Bonnie knows anything,

1686
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:56,177
and we can forget
any of this ever happened.

1687
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:58,546
All right, and then I'll talk to
Bonnie and I'll reason with her

1688
01:12:58,579 --> 01:13:02,016
and I'll make sure you guys
are a part of George's life.

1689
01:13:04,451 --> 01:13:06,854
Or, how about this,
what about this option?

1690
01:13:06,888 --> 01:13:09,523
What do you say to me just
blowing your cock off right now?

1691
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:11,125
What would you say to that?

1692
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:12,693
- Don't.
- Don't?

1693
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:13,961
(Bill laughs)

1694
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:15,563
Sam, I actually like that.

1695
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:17,932
Succinct, smart.

1696
01:13:17,965 --> 01:13:19,667
You know, if you say
enough things I like,

1697
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,801
guess what happens then.

1698
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:22,036
What?

1699
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:24,205
- Could end up liking ya.
- Great, I'd like that.

1700
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:26,473
You would? Why?

1701
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:27,541
Because I like you!

1702
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:29,510
You don't like me,
you don't fucking know me!

1703
01:13:29,543 --> 01:13:31,112
I'd like to know you,
I like your vibe.

1704
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:32,647
Fucking empty compliments.

1705
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,681
Come here.

1706
01:13:33,714 --> 01:13:35,650
You don't need...
you don't need to do this.

1707
01:13:35,683 --> 01:13:36,584
Hey, fuck you.

1708
01:13:36,617 --> 01:13:39,086
Look, you stay right
the fuck here, okay?

1709
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,221
Look, stay right here.

1710
01:13:40,254 --> 01:13:42,489
Look at me!
Stay here, okay?

1711
01:13:42,523 --> 01:13:45,092
You fucking move an inch
while we're gone,

1712
01:13:45,126 --> 01:13:47,128
cock off, life gone,
cock off, life gone.

1713
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:48,529
That fucking order.

1714
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:50,463
You will feel it.

1715
01:13:53,834 --> 01:13:55,069
What do you think?

1716
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:56,170
I hate that motherfucker!

1717
01:13:56,203 --> 01:13:58,072
Yeah, I see why
you feel that way.

1718
01:13:58,105 --> 01:13:59,840
- You don't?
- Well, I mean,

1719
01:13:59,874 --> 01:14:01,474
I know I'm being
all macho in there,

1720
01:14:01,509 --> 01:14:02,610
but I don't think he's lying.

1721
01:14:02,643 --> 01:14:03,978
Dude, he's a fucking liar!

1722
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:05,746
Look at you though,
you're an emotional mess.

1723
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,148
You can't even think straight,
dude.

1724
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:08,082
You can think straight?

1725
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:10,885
Yeah, yeah, straight
as a black arrow, okay?

1726
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:12,987
And I think if we just sit him
down and we have a talk...

1727
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,690
We walk in, we kill him,
we go to Mexico.

1728
01:14:15,723 --> 01:14:17,858
You know I've never
really killed anybody, right?

1729
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:19,260
I've been lying,
I've been telling fibs.

1730
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:21,529
If you're my best friend,
you fucking kill him.

1731
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:24,765
Yeah, I will kill him,
I'll kill anybody you want,

1732
01:14:24,799 --> 01:14:27,168
but you gotta give me three
minutes with him first, okay?

1733
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,501
I gotta check something.

1734
01:14:28,536 --> 01:14:30,237
- Three minutes?
- Three minutes.

1735
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,239
You're asking me
to fucking kill somebody, okay?

1736
01:14:32,273 --> 01:14:34,075
It's the least you can do.

1737
01:14:34,108 --> 01:14:35,242
(door opens)

1738
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:39,714
(door closes)

1739
01:14:41,615 --> 01:14:42,650
(exhales)

1740
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:44,919
A lot of options here, Sam.

1741
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:47,621
You're a businessman,
you know it's hard to, uh,

1742
01:14:47,655 --> 01:14:50,725
pull the trigger sometimes,
so to speak.

1743
01:14:50,758 --> 01:14:52,760
Come here.

1744
01:14:52,793 --> 01:14:56,864
Think you made a few mistakes
with my buddy out there.

1745
01:14:56,897 --> 01:14:58,566
Come a little closer.

1746
01:14:58,599 --> 01:15:00,267
Perch up real good.

1747
01:15:02,603 --> 01:15:06,307
So, we're gonna play a game now.

1748
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,075
I'm not talking Monopoly.

1749
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:11,645
I'm talking Ouija board,
next-level shit.

1750
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,614
You ready for that?

1751
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:14,615
Sure.

1752
01:15:14,648 --> 01:15:17,251
Let me ask you a question first.

1753
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:18,619
Are you a good man?

1754
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:19,687
I'm okay.

1755
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,222
You sure about that?

1756
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:22,890
Yeah.

1757
01:15:22,923 --> 01:15:24,592
(sighs)

1758
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:27,028
You ever go crazy before?

1759
01:15:27,061 --> 01:15:30,598
Like your head was spinning
around in a dryer set on high?

1760
01:15:30,631 --> 01:15:32,967
- Huh, have you?
- Yeah.

1761
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,635
- For real?
- Yeah.

1762
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:35,870
Yeah?

1763
01:15:35,903 --> 01:15:38,706
All right,
then you're invited in.

1764
01:15:38,739 --> 01:15:41,275
Stare into my eyes, okay,
stare deep into my eyes.

1765
01:15:41,308 --> 01:15:42,977
Not this one, this one's dead.

1766
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,079
- Stare here.
- All right.

1767
01:15:45,112 --> 01:15:46,981
Come on in.

1768
01:15:47,948 --> 01:15:49,583
Come in.

1769
01:15:49,617 --> 01:15:50,584
Deeper.

1770
01:15:50,618 --> 01:15:52,286
Come on, deeper.

1771
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:54,755
Deeper, deeper.

1772
01:15:54,789 --> 01:15:56,957
Don't fear the sharks
of my soul.

1773
01:15:56,991 --> 01:15:59,693
I only look scary.

1774
01:15:59,727 --> 01:16:04,765
I need you to think
about dragons, okay?

1775
01:16:04,799 --> 01:16:05,933
Got 'em?

1776
01:16:05,966 --> 01:16:07,802
- Got it.
- Good.

1777
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:09,036
(exhales)

1778
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:12,940
That's very, very, very good.

1779
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:14,942
You're a sensitive man,
aren't you, Sam?

1780
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,610
I'm okay.

1781
01:16:16,644 --> 01:16:18,913
Yeah, I know you're okay.

1782
01:16:18,946 --> 01:16:20,681
Are you sensitive?

1783
01:16:20,714 --> 01:16:21,715
Yes, I am.

1784
01:16:21,749 --> 01:16:24,085
Yeah, I can tell.

1785
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:26,320
I like it.

1786
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:29,390
I like it a lot.

1787
01:16:29,423 --> 01:16:31,926
Do you feel weird
about being rich?

1788
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:33,127
All the time.

1789
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,363
Why don't you give
all your money away?

1790
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:39,266
I'm scared I won't make
any more.

1791
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,169
Why'd you buy
such a big old house?

1792
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:44,171
I don't know, I thought
it would impress the girls.

1793
01:16:44,205 --> 01:16:45,239
Did it?

1794
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:47,274
- Yeah.
- Yeah, bees like honey.

1795
01:16:47,308 --> 01:16:49,243
Big news.

1796
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:51,112
All right.

1797
01:16:51,145 --> 01:16:53,647
I'm gonna forgive the wealth.

1798
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:56,317
Can you forgive my being poor?

1799
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:58,686
- Yes.
- You know how poor I am?

1800
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,988
- No.
- I have $11.

1801
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:01,989
That's it.

1802
01:17:02,022 --> 01:17:03,958
(exhales)

1803
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:06,293
We're gonna go
to the next level now,

1804
01:17:06,327 --> 01:17:08,395
'cause I'm seeing
some good things in you.

1805
01:17:08,429 --> 01:17:10,731
Can you put the gun down?

1806
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:13,400
(gun tapping)

1807
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:17,938
We're going in deeper now.

1808
01:17:17,972 --> 01:17:20,207
We're gonna go somewhere
not a lot of people have been.

1809
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:22,042
- Are you ready for that?
- Okay.

1810
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:27,314
Move away from the live eye.

1811
01:17:27,348 --> 01:17:30,151
Go into the dead eye, okay?

1812
01:17:30,184 --> 01:17:32,219
Stare into the eye
of old Dead-Eye Bill.

1813
01:17:33,254 --> 01:17:36,390
Pass through that darkness.

1814
01:17:36,423 --> 01:17:37,892
In there?

1815
01:17:37,925 --> 01:17:39,760
(deep exhale)

1816
01:17:39,793 --> 01:17:43,430
Oh yeah, you're in there.

1817
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:47,001
We're gonna have to do this
for a long, long time,

1818
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:50,004
and you're gonna show me
just who you are.

1819
01:17:50,037 --> 01:17:52,840
(train rumbling)

1820
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,184
(clacking slows)

1821
01:18:09,524 --> 01:18:12,493
(eerie high-pitched sound)

1822
01:18:12,527 --> 01:18:14,828
(heart beating)

1823
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:16,997
(train whistle blowing)

1824
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:21,969
(gasps)

1825
01:18:25,172 --> 01:18:26,941
Whoa!

1826
01:18:26,974 --> 01:18:28,842
(exhales)

1827
01:18:28,876 --> 01:18:31,245
Okay, Sam.

1828
01:18:31,278 --> 01:18:32,813
Okay.

1829
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:35,349
(door opens)

1830
01:18:37,552 --> 01:18:38,520
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1831
01:18:38,553 --> 01:18:39,453
So?

1832
01:18:39,486 --> 01:18:41,188
So he's a living,
breathing man, dude.

1833
01:18:41,222 --> 01:18:42,890
Living, breathing man?

1834
01:18:42,923 --> 01:18:44,825
Yeah, yeah, he's good, okay?

1835
01:18:44,858 --> 01:18:46,026
I took him into the house
of my soul.

1836
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,262
I spun him around, I looked
at him from every fucking angle,

1837
01:18:48,295 --> 01:18:50,130
and he's good,
and we should give him the kid.

1838
01:18:50,164 --> 01:18:52,132
No! Fuck this, fuck this plan.
Give me the gun.

1839
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:53,535
Put your money
where your mouth is.

1840
01:18:53,568 --> 01:18:55,336
- What do you mean?
- I mean we're always talking

1841
01:18:55,369 --> 01:18:57,438
love, right?
Love, love, love?

1842
01:18:57,471 --> 01:18:59,173
- Try to love him.
- Oh my God,

1843
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:01,175
this is the guy
who ruined my fucking life,

1844
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:03,210
- who stole my fucking family.
- Yeah, yeah, right?

1845
01:19:03,244 --> 01:19:05,980
Now he's inviting you back
into his family, right?

1846
01:19:06,013 --> 01:19:07,815
He invited me back
into his fucking family?

1847
01:19:07,848 --> 01:19:08,882
Give me the gun,
give me the gun.

1848
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:10,251
- Fine, you want the gun?
- Yeah.

1849
01:19:10,284 --> 01:19:11,519
- Fine, here.
- This is my fucking choice,

1850
01:19:11,553 --> 01:19:13,988
- this is my fucking choice.
- Fine, here's the fucking gun,

1851
01:19:14,021 --> 01:19:17,057
but listen, you kill him,
little George hears, right?

1852
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:19,827
Right? And we can tell him
it's big, big popcorn right now,

1853
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,428
but when he turns 13,
old man memory

1854
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:23,964
is gonna start answering
questions and he's gonna know.

1855
01:19:23,998 --> 01:19:26,000
He's gonna know Uncle Bill
and Daddy Andy

1856
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:27,401
are fucking murderers.

1857
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:29,103
You think that's good for a kid?

1858
01:19:29,136 --> 01:19:31,272
You think that's good
for sensitive guys like us?

1859
01:19:31,305 --> 01:19:33,007
It'll fucking make us cry, dude.

1860
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,377
We'll be crying and having
nightmares about him for years,

1861
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:39,380
and so will little George,
and then think about this, dude:

1862
01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:41,482
His ghost is gonna haunt us.

1863
01:19:41,516 --> 01:19:44,018
You want to spend the rest
of your life haunted by a ghost?

1864
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:46,120
Fucking floating over your bed?

1865
01:19:46,153 --> 01:19:48,289
Dripping fucking ectoplasm
all over you,

1866
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:49,923
you're all goopy and shit?

1867
01:19:49,957 --> 01:19:52,826
It's your choice,
you do what you want.

1868
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,428
You think about it though.

1869
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:56,830
Hey.

1870
01:19:56,864 --> 01:19:58,499
What are you gonna do?

1871
01:19:58,533 --> 01:20:00,401
(train whistle blowing)

1872
01:20:05,406 --> 01:20:07,207
(door opens)

1873
01:20:09,443 --> 01:20:10,477
(door closes)

1874
01:20:10,512 --> 01:20:12,880
Treat Bonnie and George right.

1875
01:20:12,913 --> 01:20:14,148
(groaning)

1876
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:15,282
You lucked out, bud.

1877
01:20:15,316 --> 01:20:16,884
You're in the family.

1878
01:20:18,886 --> 01:20:21,221
Kid's in the bathroom.

1879
01:20:21,255 --> 01:20:22,489
You made the right choice.

1880
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:24,892
You just better be as cool
as I think you are,

1881
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:26,960
'cause I'm looking forward
to hanging out with you.

1882
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:32,499
(engine rumbling)

1883
01:20:32,534 --> 01:20:34,034
(brakes squealing)

1884
01:20:35,235 --> 01:20:36,136
(sighs)

1885
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:38,339
Bill, I feel like
I'm shattered apart.

1886
01:20:38,372 --> 01:20:41,041
It's 'cause you are, dude.
You are.

1887
01:20:41,075 --> 01:20:43,578
If I was Bonnie,
I would have left me too.

1888
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:45,112
Dude, if you were Bonnie?

1889
01:20:45,145 --> 01:20:47,014
No, dude, you'd be stoked
that you met

1890
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:49,584
one of the coolest individuals
of all time, all right?

1891
01:20:49,617 --> 01:20:51,352
Andy fucking Chen.

1892
01:20:51,385 --> 01:20:52,554
But Bonnie's Bonnie.

1893
01:20:52,587 --> 01:20:53,555
Bonnie's gone.

1894
01:20:53,588 --> 01:20:55,289
Yeah, well, who's here?

1895
01:20:55,322 --> 01:20:57,559
Your ultimate homie
now and forevermore.

1896
01:20:57,592 --> 01:21:01,028
Beautiful Bill Andrews
at your service.

1897
01:21:01,061 --> 01:21:02,597
Come on, let's get you a taco.

1898
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:03,665
Come on.

1899
01:21:03,698 --> 01:21:05,232
Get you some food.

1900
01:21:05,265 --> 01:21:08,335
I'm talking tacos,
burritos, tostadas.

1901
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:10,170
What kinda drink you want?

1902
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:11,472
What do you want, Coca-Cola?

1903
01:21:11,506 --> 01:21:12,373
Cocktail.

1904
01:21:12,406 --> 01:21:14,576
Whatever kind you want, bud.
