Okay, Theodore?

Okay, Alvin?

Don'tbelate

14
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,048
You wanna be Atticus Finch. Good.

15
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,950
- I like him.
- Why?

16
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,454
- He's honest.
- Yes.

17
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:38,151
- He stands up for the right thing.
- Yes.

18
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:40,285
- And he's a good father.
- He is.

19
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,625
- Did it all by himself.
- Did what all by himself?

20
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:45,359
- Raised his kids.
- He didn't raise them by himself!.

21
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,596
Who was the woman that
came to their house every day?

22
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:51,433
- Calpurnia.
- Calpurnia. He remembered.

23
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:53,667
- And what about Boo?
- What about Boo?

24
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,730
I think that Boo Radley...

25
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:56,970
is one ofthe most interesting
characters in To KillA Mockingbird.

26
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,636
Excuse me.

27
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,770
I'm a teacher.

28
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:03,408
Xmas is not a word
in the English language.

29
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:09,081
It's either ''Merry Christmas''
or ''Happy Holidays.''

30
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,084
Thankyou.

31
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,752
Sure.

32
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,828
Mom, tell me more about Livia.

33
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:24,998
She killed everybody so her son Tiberius
could inherit the throne-- like Nixon.

34
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:26,835
It's awfully common.

35
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:31,470
The same stories, the Shakespeare, like
those plays we saw at the Old Globe.

36
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:34,674
- Anita?
- Hey, Mom.

37
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:38,515
- Want something to eat?
- No, thanks. I already ate.

38
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:42,818
- Areyou sure? I made soy cutlets.
- I'm fine. I already ate.

39
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,415
Wait.
You've been kissing.

40
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,257
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

41
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,093
- I can tell.
- You can't tell.

42
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,999
Not only can I tell,
I know who it is. It's Darryl.

43
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:01,364
Whatyou got
underyour coat?

44
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,740
It's unfair that we can't
listen to our music.

45
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:09,647
It's because it is about drugs
and promiscuous sex.

46
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:11,685
Simon and Garfunkel is poetry.

47
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:14,516
It is the poetry
ofdrugs and promiscuous sex.

48
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:17,285
Honey, they're on pot.

49
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:24,191
First, it was butter.
Then it was sugar and white flour.

50
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:28,497
Bacon, eggs, bologna,
rock 'n' roll, motorcycles.

51
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:32,505
Then, it was celebrating Christmas
on a day in September...

52
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:35,201
when you knew it
wouldn't be commercialized.

53
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:39,303
- What else areyou gonna ban?
- You want to rebel against knowledge.

54
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,076
I'm trying to giveyou the Cliff's Notes
on how to live life in this world.

55
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,640
We're like nobody else I know!

56
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:49,349
I am a college professor.
Why can't I teach my own kids? Use me.

57
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:52,517
Darryl says thatyou
use knowledge to keep me down.

58
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:54,584
He says I'm a ''yes'' person...

59
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:57,187
and you are trying to raise us
in a ''no'' environment.

60
00:05:58,332 --> 00:06:01,096
Well, clearly ''no'' is a word
Darryl doesn't hear much.

61
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:03,432
I can't live here! I hateyou!

62
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:05,938
- Even William hates you.
- I don't hate her.

63
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,237
You do hate her.
You don't even know the truth.

64
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:10,607
- Don't be a drama queen.
- Feckyou!

65
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,771
This is a house oflies!

66
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,642
There it is.

67
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:21,711
- Your sister used the ''f'' word.
- I think she said ''feck.''

68
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:25,418
- What's the difference?
- The letter ''u.''

69
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:02,692
Areyou really
in our grade?

70
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:07,424
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys, check it out.

71
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,401
William doesn't have
any pubes.

72
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,769
- How old areyou, man?
- He's not a man.

73
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,809
- He's a little baby kid.
- Bet he doesn't even get zits yet.

74
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,776
Everyone has hair.
What's wrong with you?

75
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:20,405
- Pipsqueak!
- What's your age, man?

76
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,971
- How old areyou?
- You're pathetic!

77
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:24,779
Where areyour pubes?

78
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:26,881
I had 'em.

79
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,916
I shaved 'em off.

80
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,025
He's a funny guy!

81
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:39,826
Seeyou, Pubes.

82
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,504
- Hey, noodle.
- Hi, guys.

83
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:52,469
Put on your seat belt.

84
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:57,948
We got our annuals today.

85
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,113
- Receivedyour annual.
- Right, received.

86
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:09,323
I look so much younger
than everyone else.

87
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:12,525
Enjoy it whileyou can.

88
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,693
Mom, it's time.

89
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:19,306
- Can this wait till we get home?
- Mom, pull over.

90
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,705
Tell him the truth.
Tell him how old he is.

91
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,207
He knows how old he is.

92
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:34,220
But other kids make fun ofhim
because ofhowyoung he looks.

93
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:38,224
Nobody includes him. They call him
''The Narc'' behind his back.

94
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:40,351
- They do?
- What's a narc?

95
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:44,990
- A narcotics officer.
- Well, what's wrong with that?

96
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,365
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

97
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:51,405
I'm twelve.
She skipped me a grade.

98
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,440
Big deal.
I'm a yearyounger.

99
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:55,702
They're 1 3, I'm 1 2.

100
00:08:58,345 --> 00:08:59,937
Aren't I?

101
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:03,177
I also putyou in first grade when
you were five, and I never told you.

102
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:05,509
So I'm how old?

103
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,453
Don'tyou realize that
this is gonna scar him forever?

104
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:11,821
Don't be Cleopatra. We have to be
both his mother and his dad.

105
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:14,258
- You put too much pressure on him...
- How old...

106
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:16,888
and when he rebels
in some strange and odd way...

107
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:18,864
- don't blame me.
- am I?

108
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,594
I skipped you
an extra grade.

109
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:22,602
You're 1 1 .

110
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,565
- Eleven?
- Soyou skipped fifth grade.

111
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:32,443
There's too much padding in the grades.
I taught elementary school.

112
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:33,241
Eleven?

113
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:36,813
You also skipped
kindergarten...

114
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:39,045
because I taught it
toyou when you were four.

115
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:46,919
This explains... so much.

116
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:49,462
You've robbed him
ofan adolescence.

117
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:52,090
Adolescence is a marketing tool.

118
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,660
Honey, I knowyou were
expecting puberty...

119
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:59,706
butyou'rejust gonna have to
shine it on for a little while.

120
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:02,674
Who needs a crowd?

121
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:06,611
Who put such a high premium
on being typical?

122
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,116
You're unique. You're twoyears
ahead ofeverybody.

123
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:13,119
Take those extra years
and do whatyou want.

124
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:16,179
Go to Europe for a year.
Take a look around.

125
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,885
See whatyou like.

126
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,927
Followyour dream.

127
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,520
You'll still be
theyoungest lawyer in the country.

128
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:27,294
Your dad was so proud ofyou.
He knewyou were an accelerated child.

129
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:31,637
What about me?

130
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:35,869
You are rebellious
and ungrateful ofmy love.

131
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,344
Well, somebody's
gotta be normal around here.

132
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,843
Eleven.

133
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,826
This song explains why I'm leaving home
to become a stewardess.

134
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,556
We can't talk?
We have to listen to rock music?

135
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:58,788
I loveyou.

136
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:17,140

One day... you'll be cool.

143
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:56,449
Look underyour bed.
It'll setyou free.

Bye.

150
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,410
She'll be back.

151
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:26,276
Maybe not soon.

152
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,616

Here'sa theory
foryou to disregard...

161
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,091
completely.

162
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:56,625
Music, you know--
true music--

163
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:59,638
notjust rock 'n' roll--
it chooses you.

164
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:02,641
It lives in your car, or alone,
listening toyour headphones--

165
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:07,305
you know, with the vast, scenic bridges
and angelic choirs in your brain.

166
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:08,814
It's a place apart...

167
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:11,214
from the vast, benign...

168
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,718
lap ofAmerica.

169
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,381
Did you know that ''The Letter''
byThe Box Tops...

170
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:21,087
was a minute, 58 seconds long?
Means nothing. Nil.

171
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:24,153
But it takes them less than two minutes
to accomplish...

172
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:28,395
whatJethro Tull takes hours
to not accomplish!

173
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,064
See this? This is fatuous,
pseudo blubber!

174
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,939
You know--
Which is fine, but...

175
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,271
to foist it offas art--

176
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:40,973
OrThe Doors?Jim Morrison?

177
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:43,243
He's a drunken buffoon
posing as a poet.

178
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,683
- I like the Doors.
- Give me the Guess Who.

179
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:51,418
They got the courage to be drunken
buffoons. Which makes them poetic!

180
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,188
It's quite an honor to have
the world's greatest rock critic...

181
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,195
and editor of Creem magazine...

182
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:58,857
back home in San Diego
for a few days.

183
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:03,062
- Lester Bangs.
- Live ''American Woman''?

184
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,125
Haveyou ever--

185
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:07,605
The most brilliant piece
ofgobbledygook ever.

186
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,533
Give me some
''White Light/White Heat.''

187
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,307
Iggy Pop!

188
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,780
Amen!

189
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,374
Put this on.
This isn't on your playlist either.

190
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:21,853
- Isn't it a bit early for that?
- Not for me.

191
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:26,723
That was Lester Bangs, this is
Alice Wisdom, and here is Iggy Pop.

192
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:38,199
Soyou're thekid who'ssentme those
articles from theschoolnewspaper.

193
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:40,263
Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,673
I've been doing some stuff for
a local underground paper also.

195
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:47,908
- What areyou, the star ofyour school?
- They hate me.

196
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:51,473
You'll meet them all again
on their longjourney to the middle.

197
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,682
Yourwriting is damn good. It'sjust
a shameyou missed out on rock 'n' roll.

198
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:57,189
- It's over.
- Over?

199
00:16:57,257 --> 00:17:01,318
It's over. You got here
just in time for the death rattle.

200
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,523
Last gasp.
Last grope.

201
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:07,431
- At least I'm here for that.
- What doyou type on?

202
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,969
Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

203
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,965
- And you like Lou Reed?
- The early stuff.

204
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,134
In his new stuff,
he's trying to be Bowie.

205
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,335
He shouldjust be himself.

206
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:20,572
Yeah, but if Bowie's
doin' Lou...

207
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:23,878
and if Lou's doin' Bowie,
Lou is still doin' Lou.

208
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:26,351
Ifyou like Lou.

209
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,815
- You take drugs?
- No.

210
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,118
Smart kid.

211
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:34,854
I used to do speed.

212
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,126
You know, and sometimes
a little cough syrup?

213
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:42,430
I'd stay up all night,
just writing and writing.

214
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:45,335
I mean,
like 25 pages ofdribble--

215
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:48,670
You know, about The Faces,
or Coltrane.

216
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:51,734
You know,just to fucking write.

217
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:56,172
All right.
It's been nice to meetya.

218
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:59,184
Keep sending meyour stuff.

219
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:01,948
I can't stand here all day
talking to my many fans.

220
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:04,422
Right, yeah. I understand.

221
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,652
- Okay.
- Good-bye.

222
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,718
Yeah. Bye.

223
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,799
- Bye.
- Bye.

224
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:29,839
You need a ride?

225
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,510
No, man,
I took the bus.

226
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:40,726
You know, because onceyou go to L.A.,
you're gonna have friends like crazy.

227
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:44,457
But they're gonna be fake friends.
They're gonna try to corruptyou.

228
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:47,557
You got an honest face,
and they're gonna tell you everything.

229
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:50,967
Butyou cannot make friends
with the rock stars.

230
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:55,371
- Is it okay ifI--
- Ifyou're gonna be a truejournalist--

231
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:57,672
you know, a rockjournalist--

232
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:01,811
First, you never get paid much.

233
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:05,113
Butyou will get free records
from the record company.

234
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:10,487
Jesus.

235
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,549
Fucking nothing aboutyou
that is controversial, man.

236
00:19:15,095 --> 00:19:18,462
God, it's gonna get ugly, man.
They're gonna buyyou drinks.

237
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,901
You're gonna meet girls, they're gonna
flyyou places for free, offer drugs.

238
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:25,836
I know it sounds great,
but these people are notyour friends.

239
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:28,306
These are people who wantyou
to write sanctimonious stories...

240
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,808
about the genius ofrock stars.

241
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:33,368
And theywill ruin rock 'n' roll,
and strangle...

242
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,813
everything we love
about it, you know?

243
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,873
'Cause they're trying
to buy respectability...

244
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:41,819
for a form that is gloriously
and righteously dumb.

245
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:44,652
You know, you're smart enough
to know that.

246
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,124
And the day it ceases
to be dumb...

247
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:49,185
is the day it
ceases to be real, right?

248
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:52,425
And then itjust becomes
an industry ofcool.

249
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:57,232
I'm telling you, you're coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock 'n' roll.

250
00:19:57,304 --> 00:20:02,071
I mean, the war is over.
Theywon.

251
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:05,270
And 99% ofwhat passes
for rock 'n' roll these days...

252
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:08,337
silence
is more compelling.

253
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,875
That's why I thinkyou should turn,
go back, and be a lawyer or something.

254
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:20,626
But I can tell from your face
thatyou won't.

255
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:23,526
I can giveyou 35 bucks.

256
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,192
- Give me 1 ,000 words on Black Sabbath.
- An assignment?

257
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:44,041
You have to makeyour reputation
on being honest...

258
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,584
and...

259
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,581
you know, unmerciful.

260
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:53,023
Honest.

261
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:54,856
Unmerciful.

262
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:57,488
Ifyou get into ajam,
you can call me.

263
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:59,498
I stay up late.

264
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:04,403
Look at this.

265
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:09,101
An entire generation ofCinderellas,
and there's no slipper coming.

266
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:11,610
Youjust remember, you wanted to be
Abraham Lincoln.

267
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:14,169
You wanted to be Atticus Finch in
To KillA Mockingbird.

268
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,142
You want to get high?
Looking to get high?

269
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:19,811
All I have to do is listen.

270
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:23,982
- That's what Lester Bangs said.
- As long as I know this is a hobby.

271
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:27,390
I'll pickyou up right here
at 1 1 :00 sharp.

272
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,122
Ifyou get lost,
use the familywhistle.

273
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:34,029
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

274
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,643
Don't take drugs!

275
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,717
Yes, Mother!

276
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,696
Hi. I'm William Miller.

277
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,864
I'm here from Creem magazine
to interview Black Sabbath.

278
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:19,211
Not on the list.

279
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:33,022
- Sir, I'm ajournalist. Here's a copy--
- You're not on the list.

280
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:36,153
Go to the top ofthe ramp
with the other girls.

281
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:41,900
We won't bite.

282
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:43,993
What happens after
I go to the top ofthe ramp?

283
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:53,712
Who areyou with?

284
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,578
Me? I'm with myself.

285
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,175
No. Who areyou with?
What band?

286
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:04,246
Oh. I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
I'm ajournalist.

287
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:06,918
I'm not-- Not a--
You know.

288
00:23:06,993 --> 00:23:08,927
You're not a what?

289
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:16,159
You're not a what?

290
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:19,262
I'm not a... groupie.

291
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:24,037
We are not groupies.

292
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,601
This is Penny Lane, man.
Show some respect.

293
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,447
Groupies sleep with rock stars 'cause
theywanna be near someone famous.

294
00:23:31,518 --> 00:23:34,817
We're here because ofthe music.
We are Band Aids.

295
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:37,982
-She used to run a school for Band Aids.
-We don't have intercourse with them.

296
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:40,959
We support the music.
We inspire the music.

297
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:43,825
We're here
because ofthe music.

298
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:47,697
Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.
It's famous.

299
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:50,600
It's a long story.

300
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,128
I'm retired now.
Visiting friends.

301
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:56,175
She was the one
who changed everything.

302
00:23:56,242 --> 00:24:00,178
She was the one who said,
''No more sex.

303
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:02,407
No more exploiting
our bodies and our hearts.''

304
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,916
- Right.
-Just blowjobs, that's it.

305
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,114
- It's all happening!
- It's all happening!

306
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:18,797
Okay, this is
ourjournalist friend.

307
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:21,356
Journalist friend,
meet Polexia Aphrodisia.

308
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:23,664
Estrella Starr.

309
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:25,705
And you are--

310
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:28,138
William Miller.

311
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:31,234
Here comes Sabbath!
Ozzy! Tony, it's us!

312
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,773
It's me, Polexia!

313
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:42,788
I think I saw Sapphire in there.

314
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:47,855
Does anybody remember laughter?

315
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:49,224
Sapphire!

316
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:53,794
- Come on!
- Passes, girls!

317
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,858
Come and get 'em!

318
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,035
- No, not this one.
- Who brought Opie?

319
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:01,869
- He's with us.
- Top ofthe ramp!

320
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:04,501
- Don't go anywhere, Opie.
- I'll take care ofthis.

321
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:06,044
IfI can.

322
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:25,326
Come on, boys.
Pick it up, will ya?

323
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,866
This is outrageous.
We're an hour and a halflate!

324
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:29,868
I'm coming, I'm coming.

325
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,813
Freddy! Open up!
It's Stillwater! We're on the show!

326
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:52,056
I'm ajournalist.
I write for Creem magazine.

327
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:55,526
Oh, the Enemy.
A rockwriter.

328
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,758
Right. I'd like to interviewyou
or somebody from your band.

329
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:02,666
Look. I'm sorry,
but could you please fuck off?

330
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:05,226
We play for the fans,
not the critics.

331
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:12,775
Russell,Jeff...

332
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:14,780
Ed, Larry.

333
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,577
I really loveyour band.

334
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:19,482
I think the song ''Fever Dog''
is a big step forward foryou.

335
00:26:20,353 --> 00:26:23,754
And you guys producing ityourselves
instead ofGlynJohns...

336
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,882
that was the right thing to do.

337
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,053
And Russell, Russell,
the guitar sound...

338
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:31,658
is incendiary.

339
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,326
In-Incendiary.

340
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,297
Way to go.

341
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:47,775
Hey, man.
Don't stop there.

342
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:50,077
- I'm incendiary too, man.
- I didn't mean ''fuck off.''

343
00:26:53,887 --> 00:26:56,788
- How areyou doing?
- He's with us. This way, bro.

344
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:59,825
- He's not on your list!
- Here's a list ofpeople who do belong.

345
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:05,495
Takeastraightandstrongercourse

346
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:07,328
Red Dog!
Hey, Red Dog.

347
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,699
Hey-hey! We're playin' here
tomorrow night, man.

348
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,261
- Yeah?
- Howyou doin', brother?

349
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:15,671
- Good to seeyou, man.
- You too.

350
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:18,643
That's the Allman Brothers
Band's number one roadie.

351
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:22,841
- How are the guys?
- Havin' a ball, man. Havin' a ball.

352
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:26,545
You know, when we party, we have
an Allman Brothers Band party, man.

353
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:30,817
Everybody's boogyin'. Everybody's
gettin' off. Like family, man.

354
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,051
Hey, we got these now.

355
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:34,491
Check that out.

356
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:38,361
Yeah, you can taste the colors
with your mind, brother.

357
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:40,489
Y'all gonna be
in Maryland, right?

358
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,558
- Yeah.
- All right, all right.

359
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:45,570
Hey, Dickey and Gregg
send you love, brother.

360
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:46,627
Cool.

361
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,333
- Take it easy.
- Same toyou, brother.

362
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:50,740
Seeya, man.

363
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:57,471
Somepeoplehaveahard time
explaining rock 'n'roll--

364
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,677
really explain rock 'n' roll.

365
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,380
Maybe Pete Townshend,
but that's okay.

366
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,483
Rock 'n' roll is a lifestyle
and a way ofthinking...

367
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,085
and it's not about money
and popularity.

368
00:28:10,163 --> 00:28:13,064
Although some moneywould be nice.

369
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:17,228
But it's a voice that says,
''Here I am...

370
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:20,329
and fuckyou
ifyou can't understand me.''

371
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:23,500
And one ofthese people
is gonna save the world.

372
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,545
And that means that rock 'n' roll
can save the world...

373
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:28,581
all ofus together.

374
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:33,347
And the chicks are great. But what
it all comes down to is that thing.

375
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,753
The indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music.

376
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:41,419
What I'm talking about is--
Wait, what am I talking about?

377
00:28:41,494 --> 00:28:43,394
- The buzz.
- The buzz.

378
00:28:43,463 --> 00:28:46,057
And the chicks, the whatever...

379
00:28:46,132 --> 00:28:48,532
is an offshoot ofthe buzz.

380
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,569
Likeyou saying
you liked ''Fever Dog.''

381
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:52,730
That is the fucking buzz!

382
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:09,852
Found you a pass.

383
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:14,288
Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.

384
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,056
Oh. Stillwater.

385
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:38,876
Nowyou're mysterious.

386
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:45,185
How old areyou?

387
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:47,726
- Eighteen.
- Me too.

388
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:50,262
How old are we really?

389
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:54,159
- Seventeen.
- Me too.

390
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:56,599
Actually, I'm 1 6.

391
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:01,502
Me too. Isn't it funny?

392
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:04,873
- The truthjust sounds different.
- I'm 1 5.

393
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:11,140
What's your real name?

394
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,154
I'll never tell.

395
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,885
The Enemy!

396
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:23,057
Russell! Hey.

397
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:26,030
This is Penny Lane.

398
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,460
Penny Lane, Russell Hammond.

399
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:34,400
Pleasure.

400
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:37,841
- ''Penny Lane,'' like the song.
- Have we met?

401
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,829
Oh. Come here, man.
I wanna tell you something.

402
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:11,532
It's not whatyou
put into it.

403
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:13,704
It's whatyou leave out.

404
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,044
Listen to Marvin Gaye.

405
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:18,083
A song like
''What's Happening, Brother?''

406
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:21,518
There's a single ''whoo''
at the end ofthe second verse.

407
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:23,953
You know that ''whoo,''
that single ''whoo''?

408
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:26,685
I know that ''whoo.''
Yeah. Whoo.

409
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,784
Yeah! That's what
you remember, man.

410
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:31,056
It's the little things,
the silly things.

411
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,362
The mistakes. There's only one of'em,
and it makes the song.

412
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,527
It's whatyou leave out.

413
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:38,570
- Truly.
- Yeah, that's rock 'n' roll.

414
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:40,401
Whatyou leave out.

415
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:44,173
And you're supposed to be the enemy.
What areyou, 1 8?

416
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:46,177
- Yes.
- Thereyou go.

417
00:31:46,245 --> 00:31:48,213
Still young enough to be honest.

418
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:51,244
All right. Come on.
Bring the lights down.

We'll be at

00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:36,041
- Riot House?
- Yeah.

442
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:40,449
The Continental Hyatt House.
It's on Sunset Strip.

443
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:43,682
Oh, yeah, right.
Sunset Strip.

444
00:34:43,756 --> 00:34:47,522
Well, tell your friend...

445
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:51,825
Miss Penny Lane, to call me.

446
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:54,263
Tell her it ain't
California without her.

447
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,699
We want her around,
like last summer.

448
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,703
Say itjust like that.

449
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:02,740
- Got it.
- I'm under ''Harry Houdini.''

450
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:06,772
I get it.

451
00:35:06,846 --> 00:35:09,747
- Come on, let's blow this burg!

452
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:12,750

455
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:24,887

Hey, Red Dog.

457
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:35,372

''Frosty.''

458
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,375
Ainsworth,
I'll seeyou around, man.

459
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:41,640
- Penny!
- Hey, be cool.

460
00:35:41,714 --> 00:35:43,841
Penny, youjust missed Russell.

461
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,544
He said he's at the Riot House all week,
and foryou to call him.

462
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:50,111
He's under the name
Harry Houdini.

463
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:57,359
- You know about the Riot House, right?
- I think I've heard ofit.

464
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:02,094
He had a message. He said, ''Tell her
it's not California withoutyou.

465
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:04,500
We wantyou around,
like last summer.''

466
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,801
No! He said, ''Tell her it ain't
California withoutyou, we want--''

467
00:36:07,873 --> 00:36:11,434
- I get the gist.
- Right.

468
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,604
So, how well doyou guys
know each other?

469
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,718
Call me ifyou need a rescue.
We live in the same city.

470
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,527
I think I live
in a different world.

471
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,926
Speaking ofthe world...

472
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:37,698
I've made a decision.

473
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:41,866
I'm gonna live in Morocco
for oneyear.

474
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,206
I need a new crowd.

It's all happening.

Yeah, yeah. She and Mom

00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:21,332
I'd say not speaking...

489
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:22,806
but I don't know
that they ever did.

490
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:26,140
The things your sister and I
used to do inside these fourwalls.

491
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:28,737
That's okay. That's okay.
I don't want to know.

492
00:38:28,814 --> 00:38:31,977
- It is my room now.
- We flew the friendly skies.

493
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:34,849
Okay, okay, okay.

494
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:38,116
You seem cooler.

495
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,452
I am-- I am thinking
about going to Morocco.

496
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,964
Let me know ifyou need
a little help with your mom.

497
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:49,762
- Little may not be enough.
- Yeah, she still freaks me out.

498
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:51,302
- Yeah.
- She's famous.

499
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,632
Listen, um, I--

I'm just gonna

502
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:00,235
Okay.

503
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:18,564
I worryabout
drunk drivers.

504
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,327
I worryabout
drunk drivers.

505
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,835
Mom, I'm 1 5.

00:39:35,781 --> 00:39:37,715
No, I thought
that was pretty good.

510
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,148
Keep the small bills on the outside,
and call me ifanyone gets drunk.

511
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,654
I will call you ifanyone,
anywhere, gets drunk.

512
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:46,054
- Good.
- And don't take drugs.

513
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,719
Ha-ha. Very funny.

514
00:39:48,794 --> 00:39:51,092
See? Sense ofhumor.

515
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:54,792
Funnyjoke. Have fun at the dance.
I'm glad you're making friends.

516
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:57,427
- Mom, stay.
- Okay.

517
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:01,265
Loveyou. Bye.

518
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:18,752
I always tell the girls,
never take it seriously.

519
00:40:18,824 --> 00:40:21,657
Ifyou never take it seriously,
you never get hurt.

520
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:24,287
Ifyou never get hurt,
you always have fun.

521
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:26,797
And ifyou ever get lonely...

522
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:29,299
youjust go to the record store...

523
00:40:29,368 --> 00:40:31,302
and visityour friends.

524
00:40:32,504 --> 00:40:34,631
- Soyou and Russell--
- No!

525
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:39,838
Russell has a girlfriend,
and I can't even say her name.

526
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:55,084
It's all happening.
I'm about to useyou as protection.

527
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:58,256
These guys are with Alice Cooper.
I'm gonna pretend I don't know them.

528
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,561
Penny. Hey. Does Alice
knowyou're here?

529
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:06,536
Oh, I'm just showing myvery dear, very
wonderful friend William Miller around.

530
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:09,335
He's a very important writer.
He knows Lester Bangs.

531
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:13,071
And I'm responsible
for his moral conduct while he's abroad.

532
00:41:13,145 --> 00:41:15,978
Penny Lane!
God's gift to rock 'n' roll.

533
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:18,778
I'm retired,
and don't argue with me!

534
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,876
- ''Retired''? Again?
- Penny!

535
00:41:20,953 --> 00:41:24,218
Oh, it's Reg.
That's Humble Pie's road manager.

536
00:41:25,224 --> 00:41:26,851
Penny, come to Portland
with us, love.

537
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,786
- Have we met?
- Have we met?

538
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,796
I've made a decision.

539
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,230
I'm going traveling
to India...

540
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:36,665
and then I'm going
to learn to play the violin.

541
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:40,603
And then I'm going to college...
for oneyear.

542
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:43,698
There's nothing they could teach you
in college, darling.

543
00:41:43,776 --> 00:41:44,834
Right on.

544
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,003
Call Alice. He's staying under
the name Bob Hope.

545
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,913
- I heard you were with Russell Hammond.
- Please. I throw the little ones back.

546
00:41:50,983 --> 00:41:53,417
I lost my head.

547
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:55,680
Martin Bell's
a fucking asshole!

548
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:58,086
And I'm in love with
Jeff Bebe.

549
00:41:58,157 --> 00:42:00,557
- Polexia!
- Opie?

550
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:07,263
- Areyou okay?
- Harry Houdini, please.

551
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:10,028
Houdini--
Harry Houdini!

552
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:11,797
- It was Sable.
- Sable, Sable.

553
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,565
And we had this really great night.

554
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,005
He said it was going to
mean something and--

555
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:20,478
- And I'm in love withJeff!.
-Jeffis a great guy.

556
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,847
I saw them on the 7th floor.

557
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,825
Mr.Jimmy Page, Mr.John PaulJones,
Mr. Robert Plant.

558
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:37,953
Mr. Robert Plant, he signed--

559
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,624
signed myT-shirt five minutes ago.

560
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:44,032
Please don't smear it.
Oh, dear God. Please don't smear it.

561
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,230
But five minutes ago,
he touched this pen.

562
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:48,865
- Vic is a Zeppelin fan.
- I picked that up.

563
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,808
He tours with them,
but not, you know, with them.

564
00:42:51,877 --> 00:42:54,573
Yeah, they're on the twelfth floor now.

565
00:42:54,646 --> 00:42:57,080
There's no bigger
Zeppelin fan than Vic.

566
00:42:57,149 --> 00:43:00,312
Pleasestay

567
00:43:00,385 --> 00:43:02,979
I wannahearyouplay

568
00:43:03,055 --> 00:43:06,286
Very dear, very close
friend of Lester Bangs.

569
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:08,724
William Miller.

570
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,292
Hey, you're that comedian.
Leonard.

571
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:14,389
Blow me!

572
00:43:17,736 --> 00:43:20,762
Okay, time to put on
the lampshade.

573
00:43:23,108 --> 00:43:27,169
Ladies and gentlemen!

574
00:43:27,246 --> 00:43:30,841
At this time, please extinguish
all smoking materials...

575
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:34,943
for the captain has turned on
the ''No Smoking'' sign.

576
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,648
Your seats and tray tables
should be locked...

577
00:43:37,723 --> 00:43:40,590
and in their full,
upright position.

578
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:52,969
The hell with it.

579
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:55,836
- Play on.
- Miss Penny Lane.

580
00:43:55,908 --> 00:43:58,672
Oh, thankyou, thankyou.

581
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:08,345
Act One, in which she pretends
she doesn't care...

582
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,820
about him.

583
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:17,323
Act Two, in which he pretends
he doesn't care about her...

584
00:44:17,396 --> 00:44:20,832
but he goes right for her.

585
00:44:25,637 --> 00:44:28,299
Act Three, in which
it all plays out...

586
00:44:28,373 --> 00:44:30,500
the way she planned it.

587
00:44:30,576 --> 00:44:33,511
She'll eat him alive.

588
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:36,776
- We've got to stop them.
- Stop them?

589
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,418
You were her excuse
for coming here.

590
00:44:46,692 --> 00:44:48,353
I need ice.

591
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,342
I worry about people using her.

592
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,172
'Cause she brings out
the good side in everybody else...

593
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,076
but what do they do for her?

594
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:13,045
Life kills me.
Doyou have any pot?

595
00:45:14,987 --> 00:45:16,852
No. Not on me.

596
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:22,155
- Doyou smoke?
- No.

597
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,591
But, I-I grow it.

598
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:30,157
Yeah. Grow it.

599
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:33,568
Funny-- Funny...

600
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:38,804
ifyou were only taller and English
and rich and a guitar player...

601
00:45:38,877 --> 00:45:40,640
and older.

602
00:45:41,546 --> 00:45:44,208
I'd-- I'd be
somebody else.

603
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,514
Yeah. Good point.

604
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,782
The Enemy.

605
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,752
I'm always around ifyou
wanna talk some more.

606
00:45:56,495 --> 00:45:58,122
- Okay.
- All right.

607
00:45:59,231 --> 00:46:02,223
Bless me, father,
for I may sin tonight.

608
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,527
- How does it end?
- What?

609
00:46:31,596 --> 00:46:36,761
The story about the girl who dumps
the guywho has the ex-ex wife?

610
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,038
Calls her a hundred--
Okay, five times...

611
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:45,440
and doesn't even leave
a pass in San Diego.

612
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,475
I mean, wake up.

613
00:46:49,147 --> 00:46:50,637
I'm retired.

614
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:53,375
I never believed you, anyway.

615
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:56,216
You're too good-looking and
too talented to be trusted.

616
00:46:56,288 --> 00:46:57,380
Everybody knows that.

617
00:46:57,456 --> 00:47:00,721
You're retired
like Frank Sinatra's retired.

618
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,452
Miss Penny Lane, let me tell you
what rock 'n' roll will miss...

619
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:08,524
the day that
you truly retire.

620
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,839
The way thatyou turn
a hotel room into a home.

621
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,968
The way thatyou pick up strays
whereveryou go.

622
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:23,139
The way thatyou--
You know the words to every song.

623
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,343
Every song,
especially the bad ones.

624
00:47:26,418 --> 00:47:28,318
It's mostly
the bad ones.

625
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:32,284
That green coat
in the middle ofsummer.

626
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:37,053
The real name
thatyou won't reveal.

627
00:47:42,868 --> 00:47:45,359
I could keep goin',
but my glass is full.

628
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,667
Damn.

629
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,593
Comin' to Arizona?

630
00:48:11,396 --> 00:48:12,761
Never.

631
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:15,322
Leave Thursday morning, 9 a.m.,
and pack light this time.

632
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,731
Jesus.

633
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:32,812
- William Miller?
- This ishe.

634
00:48:32,884 --> 00:48:36,411
This is Ben Fong-Torres. I'm the
music editor at RollingStone magazine.

635
00:48:36,488 --> 00:48:40,788
Wegota couple copies ofyourstories
from the San Diego Door.

636
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:43,760
- Is this the same William Miller?
- Yes, it is.

637
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:47,856
''Voice ofGod, howling dogs,
the spirit ofrock 'n' roll.''

638
00:48:47,933 --> 00:48:50,128
- This is good stuff, man.
- Thanks.

639
00:48:50,202 --> 00:48:52,762
Uh, thanks. Thanks.

640
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:55,398
I thinkyou should be
writing for us. Any ideas?

641
00:48:58,844 --> 00:49:01,677
- How about Stillwater?
- Stillwater?

642
00:49:01,746 --> 00:49:06,479
''Hard-working band makes good.''
New album out, their third.

643
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:08,746
Starting to do something. Crazy.

644
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,483
Let's do 3,000 words.
We'lljoin thebandon theroad.

645
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:14,491
Don't let the band
pay for anything.

646
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,652
We can onlypay, letmesee...

647
00:49:16,728 --> 00:49:18,696
3,000 words--

648
00:49:19,764 --> 00:49:21,664
Seven hundred dollars.

649
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:25,703
All right, a grand.

650
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:29,763
What'syourbackground?
Areyouajournalism major?

651
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:33,609
- Yeah.
- Whatcollege?

652
00:49:33,678 --> 00:49:36,977
Honey, Ineedyou to do that thing
thatfixes thegarbage disposal.

653
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,958
Well, I certainly know how my lady gets
when you don't snap to it.

654
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,118
- Crazy.
- Crazy.

655
00:49:50,662 --> 00:49:51,959
Stillwater?

656
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,363
Beware, beware of
RollingStone magazine...

657
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:58,231
because theywill
changeyour story...

658
00:49:58,303 --> 00:50:01,534
they'll rewrite it, you know,
turn it into swill--

659
00:50:01,606 --> 00:50:04,302
But besides that,
what would be wrong with it?

660
00:50:05,777 --> 00:50:09,235
You got starry eyes, my friend.

661
00:50:09,314 --> 00:50:11,908
Look. Do the story.

662
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:16,350
Who cares, you know?
It'll be good forya.

663
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:20,824
Remember this: Don't do it
to make friends with people...

664
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:24,191
who are trying to useyou...

665
00:50:24,262 --> 00:50:27,060
to further the big business desire...

666
00:50:27,132 --> 00:50:30,659
toglorify worthless rockstars
likeStillwater!

667
00:50:30,735 --> 00:50:32,828
Don'tlet those
swillmerchants rewriteyou.

668
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:37,608
- ''Swill merchants.'' That's good.
- Yeah, swillmerchants.

669
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:42,178
- What areyou listening to?
- Stillwater.

670
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:45,739
Stillwater?
Fucking kid's doing drugs.

671
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,577
No more than four days...

672
00:50:50,655 --> 00:50:52,850
and I wantyou to give me
a phone numberwhereyou are.

673
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:57,418
I wantyou to call me twice a day,
and you do not miss more than one test!

674
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,765
And no drugs.

675
00:51:03,835 --> 00:51:06,395
Oh, this is a big mistake.

676
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:31,160
Come on, Doris, you darling bus.
You can make it.

677
00:51:42,941 --> 00:51:46,172
- This is what I was talking about.
- Russell, excuse me.

678
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:48,474
I was wondering
ifmaybe we could...

679
00:51:48,546 --> 00:51:50,980
find some time to talk
when we get to Phoenix.

680
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:54,746
I want to interview everyone separately,
and I thought we'd start with...

681
00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:56,878
-justyou and me.
- Absolutely.

682
00:51:57,689 --> 00:52:00,351
Because I got a thing
in a couple ofdays.

683
00:52:00,425 --> 00:52:04,589
- What?
- Oh, it's a thing...

684
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,631
whereyou go there
to graduate.

685
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,561
School.

686
00:52:11,202 --> 00:52:14,103
I never graduated.
Lookwhat happened.

687
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,504
You're here
interviewing me.

688
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:23,808
Don't put that
in RollingStone.

689
00:52:23,882 --> 00:52:27,511
Man, our bio says
that we all graduated.

690
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:28,609
Him with honors.

691
00:52:29,954 --> 00:52:31,945
We'll figure out
something better later, okay?

692
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:35,851
Just enjoy the ride.

693
00:52:35,927 --> 00:52:38,259
- Keep playing that song.
- All right.

694
00:52:57,949 --> 00:52:59,541
I may need to stay
in your room tonight.

695
00:52:59,617 --> 00:53:00,675
Russell's in a bad mood.

696
00:53:00,752 --> 00:53:04,244
He's very Bob Dylan
in Don'tLook Back today.

697
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:08,349
- He's trying to write.
- Yeah. Sure.

698
00:53:09,027 --> 00:53:10,892
- Yeah?
- Sure.

699
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:13,829
- You okay?
- Yeah.

700
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:24,130
Could you put a ''Do not
disturb'' on my phone?

701
00:53:25,276 --> 00:53:26,265
Here's your key.

702
00:53:29,514 --> 00:53:32,210
Larry, Silent,
bag's in 1 0.

703
00:53:32,283 --> 00:53:34,410
Come by in a few minutes.
We'll do that interview.

704
00:53:34,486 --> 00:53:36,454
- All right?
- Sure.

705
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:42,888
- Is this Mr. Miller?
- Yeah.

706
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:45,293
You have a message from Elaine.

707
00:53:45,363 --> 00:53:46,853
Your mother.

708
00:53:46,931 --> 00:53:49,126
She's a handful.

709
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:53,463
- I know.
- She freaked me out.

710
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,741
Tell her to stop.

711
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:06,983
I'm worried, man.

712
00:54:09,587 --> 00:54:11,646
No, you can trust him.
He's a fan.

713
00:54:11,723 --> 00:54:13,657
But it's RollingStone.

714
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:18,287
He looks harmless, but he does represent
the magazine that trashed ''Layla''...

715
00:54:18,363 --> 00:54:21,890
broke up Cream, ripped every album
Led Zeppelin ever made.

716
00:54:21,966 --> 00:54:24,833
Don't forget the rules, man.
This little shit is the Enemy.

717
00:54:24,903 --> 00:54:26,302
He writes what he sees.

718
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:28,999
IfI don't get into a room
and take a Valium--

719
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:33,310
Although it would be cool
to be on the cover.

720
00:54:38,183 --> 00:54:41,016
You are going to get me
in so much trouble!

721
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,643
Oh, my God.

722
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,950
Simon Kirke from Bad Company
is by the pool.

723
00:54:57,969 --> 00:54:59,630
Housekeeping.

724
00:55:03,374 --> 00:55:04,807
Go away!

725
00:55:05,877 --> 00:55:08,038
Should I come by later?

726
00:55:08,112 --> 00:55:11,878
Yes. I'm in too truthful a mood.

727
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:14,441
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- Go away!

728
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:19,981
- You okay?
- Yeah.

729
00:55:22,227 --> 00:55:25,628
Don't worry. Come to
the radio interview tonight. Okay?

730
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,494
Go away!

731
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,624
- Bye.
- You're so rude.

732
00:56:30,695 --> 00:56:33,892
The guitar and songwriting
of Russell Hammond.

733
00:56:34,465 --> 00:56:39,493
The vocal stylings ofJeff''Behbay''--
''Baybay''--Jeff''Baybay''--

734
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:42,266
- ''Behbay.''
- Uh, Bebe.

735
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,740
Bebe.
''Fever Dog.''

736
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:47,300
The band is Stillwater.

737
00:56:47,378 --> 00:56:50,609
Watch with your mind
as they materialize.

738
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:02,084
Look at the dogs wearing the funny hats,
jugglingjust foryou...

739
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,754
freaks and family.

740
00:57:05,263 --> 00:57:09,393
It's Quince with Stillwater,
here, live.

741
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,627
It's The Night Circus.

742
00:57:12,403 --> 00:57:15,566
Every minute
a baby is born somewhere.

743
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,268
Life, death...

744
00:57:18,343 --> 00:57:20,811
hermetically sealed bags
ofhuman emotion--

745
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:23,472
bags oflove.

746
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:25,982
Bags ofkindness?

747
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,246
How'd you all get together?

748
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:41,293
Well, not to get into a ''me'' thing,
but I did start the band...

749
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:42,765
some time, actually, ago...

750
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,065
and I placed an ad in
a magazine called Peaches...

751
00:57:46,137 --> 00:57:48,401
and Russell Hammond answered.

752
00:57:49,407 --> 00:57:50,396
Peaches.

753
00:57:50,475 --> 00:57:52,375
I think it was a gift
from God, actually.

754
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:54,001
Nobody plays
like Russell Hammond.

755
00:57:54,078 --> 00:57:56,842
Aw, shit, man. Thankyou.

756
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:03,409
Oh, right. You might want
to hit that delay button there, Quincy.

757
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,520
Quince?

758
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,433
Now we're talkin', right?

759
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,677
Right? Why the fuck
doyou have to wait...

760
00:58:26,744 --> 00:58:29,872
till an interview in Arizona
to say something nice about me?

761
00:58:29,947 --> 00:58:31,642
Why don'tyou say it
to my fucking face sometimes?

762
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:35,379
'Cause I tell you every time
I thinkyou nail something.

763
00:58:35,453 --> 00:58:37,887
Everybody pays you
compliments.

764
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:41,254
It's not
my fuckingjob...

765
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:43,759
to kiss
your fucking ass.

766
00:58:43,828 --> 00:58:45,887
Seriously, then whose
fuckingjob is it...

767
00:58:45,963 --> 00:58:48,227
because my ass is dying
for a kiss, man...

768
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:50,290
and I know
yours is too.

769
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:53,433
It's my fuckingjob,
and I thinkyou're all geniuses...

770
00:58:53,504 --> 00:58:54,994
and I'd like to say
to the folks out there--

771
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,200
I'd like to leaveyou
with this thought: smegma.

772
00:58:57,275 --> 00:58:58,435
Nice.

773
00:58:58,509 --> 00:59:01,842
- Fellas?
- Feces.

774
00:59:04,048 --> 00:59:05,106
The name ofthe song...

775
00:59:05,183 --> 00:59:06,343
is ''Love Thing.''

776
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,510
Your mind is starting
to take effect.

777
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:12,184
They've all come
to watch you swallow fire.

778
00:59:12,256 --> 00:59:14,019
You scream...

779
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:17,528
soundlessly
on The Night Circus.

780
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,099
I thought that went well.

781
00:59:24,168 --> 00:59:25,897
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

782
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:34,141
- May I speakwith William?
- He'sstillin thebar with theband.

783
00:59:34,212 --> 00:59:38,114
Theyjust got back from the radio
station. Is this Maryann, with the pot?

784
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,009
Hello?

785
00:59:44,589 --> 00:59:47,558
No. This is not
Maryann with the pot.

786
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,889
This is Elaine.
His mother.

787
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,658
Could you give William
a message for me, please?

788
00:59:54,732 --> 00:59:58,498
Tellhim to callhomeimmediately,
andalso tellhim...

789
00:59:58,569 --> 01:00:02,733
I know what's going on.

790
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:06,903
Okay. But I'm just gonna say this,
and I'm gonna stand by it:

791
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,412
You should be
really proud ofhim.

792
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,142
'Cause I know men,
and I'll betyou do too.

793
01:00:12,216 --> 01:00:15,344
He respects women,
andhelikes women.

794
01:00:15,419 --> 01:00:18,650
Andlet'sjustpause
andappreciateamanlike that.

795
01:00:18,723 --> 01:00:22,215
You created him out ofthin air,
you know, you raised him right.

796
01:00:22,293 --> 01:00:24,761
He's having a great time.
He's doing a goodjob.

797
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:29,664
And, don't worry, he'sstilla virgin,
andwe'realllookingoutforhim.

798
01:00:29,734 --> 01:00:33,363
You know? That's more than I've
ever even said to my own parents.

799
01:00:34,605 --> 01:00:36,038
So thereyougo.

800
01:00:38,109 --> 01:00:40,669
This is themaidspeaking,
by the way.

801
01:00:41,712 --> 01:00:45,512
- Can you please hold it down?
- Sorry, ma'am!

802
01:00:50,755 --> 01:00:54,247
Russell! So, what is it
you love about music?

803
01:00:55,326 --> 01:00:58,853
Shut that thing off for a second
and I'll tell you the truth, all right?

804
01:01:01,232 --> 01:01:05,532
Look-- Fuck. I trustyou,
so I'm just gonna lay this right on ya.

805
01:01:08,573 --> 01:01:10,507
Just make us look cool.

806
01:01:13,277 --> 01:01:17,373
I will quoteyou
warmly and accurately.

807
01:01:17,448 --> 01:01:20,508
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

808
01:01:21,852 --> 01:01:23,877
Some ofus...

809
01:01:23,955 --> 01:01:26,287
we got girlfriends
back home, you know?

810
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:29,893
Some ofus have wives.

811
01:01:29,961 --> 01:01:34,159
And some ofthe people
thatyou meet on the road...

812
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,792
are really amazing people.

813
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,765
Likeyou.

814
01:01:47,612 --> 01:01:50,172
But some ofthe stuffthat happens,
it's good for...

815
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,513
a few people to know about,
as opposed to, say...

816
01:01:55,653 --> 01:01:58,144
a million people.

817
01:01:58,222 --> 01:02:01,658
- Understand what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

818
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:04,919
'Cause, see,
you're dangerous.

819
01:02:06,497 --> 01:02:07,930
You see everything.

820
01:02:07,999 --> 01:02:11,457
Most people,
they'rejust waiting to talk.

821
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:13,058
Butyou listen.

822
01:02:15,673 --> 01:02:19,734
See, I grew up with these guys,
but I can't play all that I can play.

823
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:23,007
I'm past 'em,
as musicians, but...

824
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,516
the more popularwe get,
the bigger their houses get...

825
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:29,109
the more responsibilities,
the pressure, you know--

826
01:02:30,054 --> 01:02:32,284
The harder it gets
for me to walk out on them.

827
01:02:33,491 --> 01:02:35,322
Then you forget--

828
01:02:35,393 --> 01:02:39,193
forget what it's like
to be a fan.

829
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,621
You hear it in bands all the time.

830
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:43,564
Doesn't sound
like music anymore, you know?

831
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:44,794
Sounds like--

832
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,329
lifestyle maintenance
or something.

833
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:52,009
''Lifestyle maintenance.''
That's--

834
01:02:55,913 --> 01:02:58,006
I used to be able
to hear...

835
01:03:00,551 --> 01:03:03,179
the sounds ofthe world--
everything.

836
01:03:03,254 --> 01:03:05,882
To me,
it sounded like music.

837
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:11,859
And now I don't hear it,
you know, anymore.

838
01:03:21,205 --> 01:03:23,070
Doyou understand
what I'm trying to say?

839
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:26,238
Yeah. Yeah.

840
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,335
Help me!

841
01:03:30,548 --> 01:03:32,038
What am I doing?

842
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:38,054
I'm telling secrets to the one guy
you don't tell secrets to.

843
01:03:43,527 --> 01:03:45,427
We'll do the interview tomorrow.

844
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:53,734
So tonight, it's--
Well, friends.

845
01:03:53,804 --> 01:03:56,568
- Yeah, right.
- We trustya.

846
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:02,306
Larry Fellows, how would you describe
your role in Stillwater?

847
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,975
What is the chemical
you add to the chemistry?

848
01:04:09,487 --> 01:04:10,954
I'm the bass player.

849
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:13,648
Right.

850
01:04:14,592 --> 01:04:19,393
And when you take that away,
what would be missing?

851
01:04:19,463 --> 01:04:22,296
Stylistically,
what chemical?

852
01:04:26,771 --> 01:04:28,033
The bass?

853
01:04:30,374 --> 01:04:31,363
Okay.

854
01:05:18,355 --> 01:05:21,222
- Hey, what's going on?
- Russell just got electrocuted!

855
01:05:25,429 --> 01:05:27,659
Okay! Everybody, be cool!

856
01:05:27,731 --> 01:05:31,030
Come on! Let's get on the bus!
Let's go!

857
01:05:31,101 --> 01:05:33,865
This is bullshit, man.
Who's taking care ofus?

858
01:05:33,938 --> 01:05:35,929
- Who's responsible for the gear?
- I'm gonna deal with it.

859
01:05:36,006 --> 01:05:38,167
Get on the bus!
Please, everyone!

860
01:05:38,242 --> 01:05:40,506
- Let's go!
- Hey, cowboy.

861
01:05:40,578 --> 01:05:42,637
- You the manager ofthis band?
- That and more!

862
01:05:42,713 --> 01:05:44,647
You didn't finish
your full set, man.

863
01:05:44,715 --> 01:05:48,481
Listen, pal. Your shoddy stage setup
almost killed my guitarist!

864
01:05:48,552 --> 01:05:51,715
You trashed my fucking dressing room,
and you didn't doyour 25 minutes.

865
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:55,054
-Don't fuckwith my band's safety, ever!
-Fuckyou, man!

866
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,593
I'm gonna reportyou
to every promoter in this country!

867
01:05:57,661 --> 01:05:59,094
I'm gonna talk
to Frank Barcelona tonight!

868
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,131
You don't know Frank Barcelona!

869
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:03,098
- You're a bunch ofamateurs!
- Fuck off!.

870
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,795
- You want it?
- Come on!

871
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:07,633
What doyou got?

872
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:14,368
Hey, watch the shirt, fuck!
Now I'm gonna kickyour ass.

873
01:06:14,445 --> 01:06:17,471
Take it easy. Take it easy, man.

874
01:06:17,548 --> 01:06:19,243
I hopeyou got
a good lawyer.

875
01:06:20,117 --> 01:06:23,280
You better make a live album,
'cause this is your last fuckin' tour!

876
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:24,343
What? What?

877
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:26,912
- Fuck off!.
- What is that? What areyou, Bruce Lee?

878
01:06:26,991 --> 01:06:28,822
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on!

879
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,724
- Take it easy!
- Dick, let's go!

880
01:06:33,797 --> 01:06:34,889
Lock the gates!

881
01:06:36,066 --> 01:06:39,229
- Let's go through the fucking gate.
- This is your last fucking tour, man!

882
01:06:39,303 --> 01:06:41,533
Lock the gates
on these fuckheads!

883
01:06:41,605 --> 01:06:44,199
- Where's my goddamn cart?
- William?

884
01:06:48,245 --> 01:06:51,009
I forgot to tell you.
Your mom called.

885
01:06:51,081 --> 01:06:53,515
She says you gotta
call home immediately.

886
01:06:53,584 --> 01:06:57,384
And she says to tell you,
''I know what's going on.''

887
01:06:57,454 --> 01:06:59,513
So, I'll seeyou guys
in Topeka, okay?

888
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:06,488
Amateurs!

889
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,897
You don't know whoyou're
dealing with here! Lock the gates!

890
01:07:16,206 --> 01:07:18,674
- You wanna buy a gate?
- Yeah!

891
01:07:21,979 --> 01:07:23,810
Youjust bought a gate!

892
01:07:46,403 --> 01:07:48,997
Hey, give that
to me, William.

893
01:07:53,377 --> 01:07:55,538
Give me that!

894
01:08:04,655 --> 01:08:05,644
Russell, wake up.

895
01:08:06,857 --> 01:08:09,826
Wake the fuck up, man.
It's a girls' running team.

896
01:08:10,861 --> 01:08:12,419
Goddamn!

897
01:08:12,496 --> 01:08:15,124
Let it go.
Let it go, buddy.

898
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:17,531
When do we get in to Topeka, man?

899
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:20,627
- Larry, you're a sick individual.
- Wake up, man.

900
01:08:20,704 --> 01:08:24,401
Look at all these fucking
tasty-looking high school girls.

901
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:28,002
We can't stop the bus every time
you see a girl in shorts.

902
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:30,638
Hey, when we go to Morocco...

903
01:08:30,714 --> 01:08:33,148
I thinkwe should wear
completely different clothes...

904
01:08:33,217 --> 01:08:35,447
and be completely different people.

905
01:08:35,519 --> 01:08:38,454
What will our names be?

906
01:08:47,531 --> 01:08:49,465
What doyou think of Russell?

907
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,469
I like him.

908
01:08:53,537 --> 01:08:57,132
But that's between us.
Because I am a professional.

909
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:01,808
You should give 'em a break.
There are real problems in the band.

910
01:09:01,879 --> 01:09:05,315
- Offthe record.
- What problems?

911
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:12,179
Okay, I got it. Your name should be
Spencer, and mine will beJane.

912
01:09:14,892 --> 01:09:18,555
- I can't keep up with you.
- Oh, no one can.

913
01:09:22,966 --> 01:09:25,161
You're comin'
to Cleveland, right?

914
01:09:26,236 --> 01:09:29,296
Cleveland, Ohio?
Oh, no.

915
01:09:31,475 --> 01:09:35,377
I have to get my interview
with Russell before Greenville.

916
01:09:35,446 --> 01:09:40,281
- You've got to help me, okay?
- Here's the thing about Russell.

917
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,942
He's my last project.

918
01:09:42,019 --> 01:09:46,956
I only do this for a very few people,
and I thinkwe should do it together.

919
01:09:47,024 --> 01:09:50,357
Because all the guys are good,
but he could be great.

920
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,625
What's your real name?

921
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:03,239
All right, let's go!

922
01:10:07,711 --> 01:10:11,408
Oh, it's okay.
I'm easy to forget.

923
01:10:11,482 --> 01:10:13,279
Just leave me behind!

924
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:16,615
I'm only the fucking lead singer!

925
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:22,051
So, Ed Vallencourt...

926
01:10:22,126 --> 01:10:24,185
what doyou love
about music?

927
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:39,572
Okay. Okay.

928
01:10:39,643 --> 01:10:42,578
You toldmeyou'dtellme

929

You toldmeyou would

930
01:10:46,049 --> 01:10:48,609

931
01:10:48,685 --> 01:10:50,710

932
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,780
Right now, Topeka.
Then Greenville, then home.

933
01:10:53,857 --> 01:10:56,883
Whataboutgraduation?
Wehadanagreement, William.

934
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,258
I'm sorry I didn't
call you yesterday.

935
01:10:59,329 --> 01:11:01,422
I guess I just miss you,
and I don't understand...

936
01:11:01,498 --> 01:11:03,363
why I've driven my two kids
so far away from me.

937
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:06,368
Byallpracticalrules,
don'tIgetyouforanotherthreeyears?

938
01:11:08,005 --> 01:11:10,098
Was I not fun?

939
01:11:10,174 --> 01:11:11,368
Yes.

940
01:11:12,342 --> 01:11:14,310
This is Beth from Denver.

941
01:11:14,378 --> 01:11:17,541
She's one ofthe legendary,
original Band Aids.

942
01:11:17,614 --> 01:11:20,674
- She's clairvoyant!
- I can't read your mind or anything.

943
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:23,777
Imean, Ipick up things
hereandthere.

944
01:11:23,854 --> 01:11:25,685
Estrella says hi.

945
01:11:25,756 --> 01:11:29,385
- She says I can stay in your room.
- Sure.

946
01:11:29,459 --> 01:11:31,859
Great. I'vegotsome...

947
01:11:31,929 --> 01:11:34,363
hydroponic pot!

948
01:11:34,431 --> 01:11:37,889
Wow, your aura
is really fantastic!

949
01:11:37,968 --> 01:11:41,165
- It's this beautiful purple color.
- Iloveyou.

950
01:11:41,238 --> 01:11:43,138
I missed the last thing you said.

951
01:11:43,207 --> 01:11:45,869
- Youraura ispurple!
- I loveyou.

952
01:11:45,943 --> 01:11:48,434
- What?
- Purple!It'spurple!

953
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:51,640
- Mom, what?
- Youraura ispurple.

954
01:11:51,715 --> 01:11:54,149
I miss you and I loveyou!

955
01:11:54,218 --> 01:11:56,186
I loveyou.

956
01:12:26,183 --> 01:12:30,210
All right.
Fire away. I'm ready.

957
01:12:30,287 --> 01:12:32,755
Doyou have to be depressed
to write a sad song?

958
01:12:32,823 --> 01:12:34,723
Doyou have to be in love
to write a love song?

959
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:38,192
Is the song better
ifit really happened toyou?

960
01:12:38,262 --> 01:12:42,961
Like ''Love Thing.'' Where did you
write that? Who is it about?

961
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:46,536
When did you get
so professional?

962
01:12:48,505 --> 01:12:52,532
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

963
01:13:13,363 --> 01:13:17,322
It's the record company's mistake,
and theywill pay.

964
01:13:18,669 --> 01:13:22,105
T-shirts are gone.
Band happy, all right?

965
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:28,605
Can wejust skip the vibe, and go
straight to us laughing about this?

966
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:29,805
Yeah, okay.

967
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,178
Because I can see byyour face
you want to get into it.

968
01:13:32,249 --> 01:13:35,446
How can you tell?
I'm just one ofthe out-of-focus guys.

969
01:13:36,887 --> 01:13:39,515
Here. Take it.

970
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:42,023
Let's take a good look at it,
all right?

971
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:46,094
See, you love this T-shirt.

972
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:48,290
It lets you say
everything you want to say.

973
01:13:48,365 --> 01:13:51,334
Well, it speaks
pretty loudly to me.

974
01:13:51,401 --> 01:13:53,494
It's a T-shirt.

975
01:13:55,372 --> 01:13:57,306
Doyou give a shit
about a T-shirt?

976
01:13:57,374 --> 01:14:01,140
I'm just hungry, man. Let'sjust go out
and find some barbecue or something.

977
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:04,703
- I'm always gonna tell you the truth.
- Areyou doing coke again?

978
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:07,307
Oh, yeah!
All the time!

979
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:10,376
This is big stuff, man.

980
01:14:10,454 --> 01:14:12,979
From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man...

981
01:14:13,056 --> 01:14:15,786
and you're the guitarist
with mystique.

982
01:14:15,859 --> 01:14:17,827
That's the dynamic we agreed on.

983
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:23,560
Page, Plant, Mick, Keith,
Blackmore, Gillan.

984
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:26,295
But somehow it's all turning around.

985
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,895
We have got to control
what's happening!

986
01:14:28,972 --> 01:14:32,305
- There's a responsibility here.
- Excuse me.

987
01:14:32,376 --> 01:14:35,971
Didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?

988
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:37,980
I can't say any more
with the writer here.

989
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:41,414
You can trust him.
Saywhatyou want.

990
01:14:41,485 --> 01:14:43,419
He won't write it.

991
01:14:43,487 --> 01:14:48,083
I work as hard, or harder,
than anybody on that stage.

992
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:51,924
You know what I do?
I connect.

993
01:14:51,995 --> 01:14:53,895
I get people off!.

994
01:14:53,964 --> 01:14:57,024
I look for the one guy
who isn't getting off...

995
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,568
and I make him get off.

996
01:14:59,636 --> 01:15:01,604
Actually, thatyou can print!

997
01:15:02,973 --> 01:15:07,535
And yet, why do I always end up
feeling like I'm ajoke toyou?

998
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:12,345
You want to pretend this isn't
gonna be a very big band? Well, it is!

999
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:14,748
You call yourself
a leader ofthis band...

1000
01:15:14,818 --> 01:15:17,548
butyour direction
allowed this T-shirt...

1001
01:15:17,621 --> 01:15:19,782
when you allowed Dick
to manage us.

1002
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:23,087
'Cause he's your friend!

1003
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,924
Don'tyou see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.

1004
01:15:25,996 --> 01:15:27,486
Is it my turn now?

1005
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:30,692
Because I thinkwe should, for once,
saywhat we really mean.

1006
01:15:30,767 --> 01:15:34,567
- This is the part whereyou quit!
- Right. I'm so predictable.

1007
01:15:34,638 --> 01:15:36,265
Deal with it.

1008
01:15:36,339 --> 01:15:38,330
And let me say
what nobody else wants to say.

1009
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:41,275
- What?
- Your looks have become a problem!

1010
01:15:42,312 --> 01:15:44,712
All right, enough!
Break it up.

1011
01:15:44,781 --> 01:15:46,476
Everyone out ofthe room
for five minutes.

1012
01:15:51,021 --> 01:15:53,785
Hey! Yeah.
William. Sorry.

1013
01:15:56,493 --> 01:15:58,723
Come on, man. Come on.

1014
01:15:58,795 --> 01:16:01,389
Let's go find something real.

1015
01:16:07,904 --> 01:16:11,271
From here on out, I'm only interested
in what is real.

1016
01:16:11,341 --> 01:16:13,434
Real people, real feelings.
That's it.

1017
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:16,343
That's all I'm interested in
from here on out.

1018
01:16:17,981 --> 01:16:19,915
You're real.

1019
01:16:20,984 --> 01:16:23,009
- Thanks.
- You know...

1020
01:16:23,086 --> 01:16:26,522
you know all about us,
and I don't know shit aboutyou.

1021
01:16:28,658 --> 01:16:30,649
Tell me,
what's your family like?

1022
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,694
My dad died ofa heart attack...

1023
01:16:35,765 --> 01:16:38,199
and my sister believes
that my mom is so intense...

1024
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:40,793
that she had to escape our family...

1025
01:16:40,871 --> 01:16:43,465
and they can't seem to find
a way to get through it.

1026
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,474
I mean, they don't even speak
to each other anymore.

1027
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:49,672
Plus, she gave me all her albums,
and now she's a stewardess?

1028
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,350
It's good to talk about.

1029
01:16:56,386 --> 01:17:00,083
Really good.
But here I am telling secrets...

1030
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,250
to the one guyyou're not supposed to
tell your secrets to.

1031
01:17:07,697 --> 01:17:09,358
You're Russell from Stillwater.

1032
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:14,535
Well, yeah, on my better days,
I am Russell from Stillwater.

1033
01:17:14,604 --> 01:17:16,970
Hey, you wanna go to a partywith me
at my friend Aaron's house?

1034
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,701
I mean, I knowyou're
a big rock star and all...

1035
01:17:18,775 --> 01:17:23,007
but doyou wanna hang with some good
people looking to have a good time?

1036
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,709
- We'rejust real Topeka people, man.
- Smoke some righteous weed.

1037
01:17:46,736 --> 01:17:49,466
- Thanks.
- You too.

1038
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:52,633
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

1039
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:55,234
Fuck!
I grew up with that lamp shade.

1040
01:17:55,312 --> 01:17:59,305
I love this kitchen.
I fucking love this kitchen!

1041
01:18:06,856 --> 01:18:09,620
That's William over there.
Hey, William!

1042
01:18:11,928 --> 01:18:16,126
You, Aaron,
are what it's all about.

1043
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,891
You're real.

1044
01:18:18,969 --> 01:18:23,201
Your room is real.
Your friends are real.

1045
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:26,709
Real, man, real.
You know? Real.

1046
01:18:30,647 --> 01:18:32,410
Real. You know?

1047
01:18:35,952 --> 01:18:41,219
You're more important
than all the silly machinery.

1048
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:44,222
Silly machinery.
And you know it!

1049
01:18:45,629 --> 01:18:49,156
In eleven years, it's gonna be 1 984,
man. Think about that!

1050
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:52,601
Wanna see me feed a mouse
to my snake?

1051
01:18:52,669 --> 01:18:54,102
Yes.

1052
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:57,936
- Can I have that bitchin' belt?
- Take it.

1053
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,739
- Thanks, man.
- Thankyou, brother.

1054
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:13,355
Russell, we should probably
get backwith the others.

1055
01:19:13,423 --> 01:19:15,357
- Oh, it's over, daddy.
- Hey...

1056
01:19:15,425 --> 01:19:19,293
there's acid in the beer
that's in the red cups.

1057
01:19:21,831 --> 01:19:23,765
That's mine.

1058
01:19:25,502 --> 01:19:27,436
Topeka. Check it out.

1059
01:19:27,504 --> 01:19:31,964
Please, don't give him any more acid.
Thankyou.

1060
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:43,018
Dick? Dick, I got him.

1061
01:19:43,086 --> 01:19:44,951
He's okay.

1062
01:19:45,021 --> 01:19:47,285
He is on acid, though.

1063
01:19:47,357 --> 01:19:52,317
I can't really tell.
How doyou know when it's kicked in?

1064
01:19:52,395 --> 01:19:54,829
I am a golden god!

1065
01:19:56,766 --> 01:19:58,165
Yes, you are!

1066
01:19:59,069 --> 01:20:03,369
- I am a golden god!
- Hey, Russell!

1067
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,237
Don'tjump.

1068
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:09,335
And you can tell
RollingStone magazine...

1069
01:20:09,412 --> 01:20:12,813
that my last words...

1070
01:20:12,882 --> 01:20:14,349
were...

1071
01:20:19,222 --> 01:20:20,416
I'm on drugs.

1072
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:33,367
I thinkwe should work
on those last words!

1073
01:20:33,436 --> 01:20:35,768
Okay. Oh, I got it, I got it.
I got it.

1074
01:20:35,839 --> 01:20:38,774
I got it. I got it.
This is better.

1075
01:20:38,842 --> 01:20:42,005
Last words.

1076
01:20:43,113 --> 01:20:45,343
I dig music.

1077
01:20:48,017 --> 01:20:49,609
I'm on drugs!

1078
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:55,754
Look,just come on down...

1079
01:20:55,825 --> 01:20:58,851
and we'll go back to the hotel.

1080
01:20:58,928 --> 01:21:00,122
Okay.

1081
01:21:00,196 --> 01:21:01,754
-Jump.
-Jump!

1082
01:21:16,346 --> 01:21:17,813
- He's not coming up.
- Something's wrong.

1083
01:21:17,881 --> 01:21:19,075
Somebody help him.

1084
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:20,616
I'll saveyou, Russell!

1085
01:21:27,557 --> 01:21:31,823
They'vebeen crying foryou
likeabunch ofwhimperingpussies.

1086
01:21:31,895 --> 01:21:33,260
Oh, thisband's over.

1087
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:36,127
- This is my family now.
- That's right.

1088
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:38,258
- Right, man.
- Definitely.

1089
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:41,997
- He's staying with us.
- Let'sjust ride on down to Greenville.

1090
01:21:42,071 --> 01:21:45,268
We'll listen to some great music.
We'll finish the tour...

1091
01:21:45,341 --> 01:21:48,868
and then we'll leave
those ungrateful fools behind.

1092
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:51,209
Then we'll come back here,
whereyou'll live.

1093
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,273
- That sounds good.
- Yeah, and he can stay in our basement.

1094
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:58,309
-I see whatyou're doing, and I like it.
-Okay, good.

1095
01:21:58,388 --> 01:22:00,856
Come on.

1096
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:03,256
- I got it, man, I got it.
- Yeah.

1097
01:22:03,326 --> 01:22:05,760
That felt kinda good, though.

1098
01:22:06,996 --> 01:22:08,657
Excuse me, kids.

1099
01:22:08,731 --> 01:22:12,667
Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.

1100
01:22:12,735 --> 01:22:15,033
How do we know
you're not a cop? Huh?

1101
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:18,437
The Enemy?
Stop fucking looking at me!

1102
01:22:18,508 --> 01:22:20,499
He's your guardian angel,
all right?

1103
01:22:20,577 --> 01:22:23,944
Don't worry. He only means half
ofwhat he says.

1104
01:22:24,013 --> 01:22:25,776
Which half?

1105
01:22:25,849 --> 01:22:27,783
Dick,justhelpmeget
myinterview.

1106
01:22:27,851 --> 01:22:30,376
- I have to go home, Dick.
- Okay, okay.

1107
01:22:30,453 --> 01:22:32,512
- I have to go home.
- Look.

1108
01:22:32,589 --> 01:22:36,650
You saved the tour, and that's
good enough for now, all right?

1109
01:22:36,726 --> 01:22:39,251
- Come on, big fella, let's go.
- I hurt the flower.

1110
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:43,789
Did you, man? You hurt the flower?
That's nice. Come on, on the bus.

1111
01:22:49,906 --> 01:22:53,501
Ladies and gentlemen,
the evening is over!

1112
01:22:53,576 --> 01:22:55,669
We hopeyou all enjoyed yourselves.

1113
01:22:55,745 --> 01:23:00,409
And we'll seeyou all again in 1 974.

Youhadabusy daytoday

1130
01:25:15,385 --> 01:25:17,319
In CarlJung's opinion...

1131
01:25:17,387 --> 01:25:20,845
we all have a sixth sense--
intuition.

1132
01:25:20,923 --> 01:25:23,653
When you meet someone and you suddenly
feel likeyou can't live without them...

1133
01:25:23,726 --> 01:25:28,163
this could be the memory ofa past love
from the collective unconscious.

1134
01:25:29,932 --> 01:25:31,160
Or, it couldjust be hormones.

1135
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,640
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.

1136
01:25:37,707 --> 01:25:41,143
Rock stars have kidnapped my son.

1137
01:25:49,419 --> 01:25:52,650
On the whole, I'dsay
mostofthe fuck-ups in the world...

1138
01:25:52,722 --> 01:25:55,885
come from thebrain
andnot theinstincts.

1139
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:59,189
Mywhole thing is
to try and make my--

1140
01:25:59,262 --> 01:26:02,197
Mywhole thing is to try and make
my brain go away...

1141
01:26:02,265 --> 01:26:04,927
but I can't,
except onstage.

1142
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:06,696
The brain, I think...

1143
01:26:06,769 --> 01:26:09,397
should be a softening influence
on the instincts...

1144
01:26:09,472 --> 01:26:12,407
but the instincts should drive...

1145
01:26:13,443 --> 01:26:15,377
trying to reconcile
the brain with urges...

1146
01:26:15,445 --> 01:26:17,970
that come out
ofmillions ofyears ago.

1147
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:20,208
The way the brain
interprets these instincts...

1148
01:26:20,283 --> 01:26:22,683
is a heavy trip.

1149
01:26:22,752 --> 01:26:26,347
Vallencourt, areyougetting
on the fuckingbus, or what?

1150
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:30,216
Let's get on the bus and go.

1151
01:26:36,599 --> 01:26:38,726
Usually, I'm brain...

1152
01:26:38,801 --> 01:26:40,826
andRussellis instincts.

1153
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,600
Buton the days when
we'reboth instinct...

1154
01:26:46,676 --> 01:26:50,703
that's when we'vemade themusic
peopleknowbest.

1155
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,714
Becauseit's thebest.

1156
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:01,622
Show me any guywho ever said he didn't
want to be popular...

1157
01:27:01,691 --> 01:27:03,420
and I'll showyou
a scared guy.

1158
01:27:03,493 --> 01:27:06,223
I've studied
the entire history ofmusic.

1159
01:27:06,295 --> 01:27:09,924
Most ofthe time,
the best stuffis the popular stuff.

1160
01:27:09,999 --> 01:27:13,958
It's much safer to say
popularity sucks...

1161
01:27:14,036 --> 01:27:17,563
because that allows you
to forgiveyourselfifyou suck.

1162
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,406
And I don't forgive myself.
Doyou?

1163
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:26,642
Lester, Rolling Stone is callingme.

1164
01:27:26,716 --> 01:27:29,446
I don't have my key interview.
I don't know what to say.

1165
01:27:29,519 --> 01:27:31,077
Days arejust going by out here.

1166
01:27:31,154 --> 01:27:35,591
You're flipping out. It's good.
All right.

1167
01:27:35,658 --> 01:27:38,491
This is howyou blow their minds.
He's gonna askyou--

1168
01:27:38,561 --> 01:27:41,325
- This is Ben Fong-Torres, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1169
01:27:41,397 --> 01:27:43,490
He'sgonnaaskyou
howthestory'sgoing...

1170
01:27:43,566 --> 01:27:45,329
and this is whatyou do.

1171
01:27:45,401 --> 01:27:47,835
Tell him...

1172
01:27:47,904 --> 01:27:50,839
you know, it's a--
it's a think-piece...

1173
01:27:51,607 --> 01:27:54,269
Think-piece.

1174
01:27:54,343 --> 01:27:56,607
aboutamid-levelband...

1175
01:27:56,679 --> 01:27:58,977
struggling with
their own limitations...

1176
01:27:59,048 --> 01:28:02,211
in the, you know,
harsh face ofstardom.

1177
01:28:02,285 --> 01:28:04,776
Harsh... face--

1178
01:28:04,854 --> 01:28:07,721
Yeah, he'll wet himself.

1179
01:28:12,495 --> 01:28:15,464
All dressed up and no place to go.

1180
01:28:15,531 --> 01:28:18,728
Greenville--
I'm bored.

1181
01:28:24,874 --> 01:28:27,342
Who hid the quaaludes
from me?

1182
01:28:28,044 --> 01:28:29,511
I have to pee.

1183
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:32,508
Wow. They're cute.

1184
01:28:35,151 --> 01:28:37,142
Let's deflower the kid.

1185
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:49,525
Whoa, hold on, hold on.
Wait.

1186
01:28:49,599 --> 01:28:53,968
I should leave. I think
things are going backwards for me.

1187
01:28:54,036 --> 01:28:56,903
- Backwards?
- Well, I don't know. I just--

1188
01:28:56,973 --> 01:29:01,376
I thought maybe we could hang out,
you know, do some stuffback home...

1189
01:29:01,444 --> 01:29:02,911
like regular stuff...

1190
01:29:02,979 --> 01:29:05,539
get to know each other
a little bit better...

1191
01:29:05,615 --> 01:29:07,606
and then I'd seeyou pee.

1192
01:29:07,683 --> 01:29:11,380
I mean, you know, that'sjust the way
I usually do it.

1193
01:29:11,454 --> 01:29:13,354
You're one ofus.

1194
01:29:13,422 --> 01:29:15,185
Ifyou come to Cleveland...

1195
01:29:15,258 --> 01:29:17,954
Bowie's gonna be at Swingo's,
the greatest hotel in America.

1196
01:29:18,027 --> 01:29:22,157
I'll introduceyou to him
and his security guard, Dennis.

1197
01:29:22,231 --> 01:29:24,199
Don'tyou have any regular friends?

1198
01:29:25,468 --> 01:29:28,062
Famous people
arejust more interesting.

1199
01:29:29,338 --> 01:29:32,136
Well, I would be worried
that theywere using me.

1200
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:36,544
Boy, ifthis was the real world...

1201
01:29:36,612 --> 01:29:38,705
- Not that anybody's using you!
- and some guy talked to me like that--

1202
01:29:38,781 --> 01:29:40,408
No. Hold on.

1203
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:45,747
I'm not famous. But--

1204
01:29:45,821 --> 01:29:49,621
- Your time has come!
- Did Russell call?

1205
01:29:49,692 --> 01:29:51,922
- Deflower.
- Opie must die.

1206
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:55,594
- Pants him, girls.
- Stop. We're talking.

1207
01:29:55,665 --> 01:29:58,463
Opie must die.

1208
01:30:01,037 --> 01:30:03,130
- Okay.
- No, come on!

1209
01:30:05,675 --> 01:30:07,302
No, come on, please.

1210
01:30:08,377 --> 01:30:10,277
Guys, come on, I have to write.

1211
01:30:32,535 --> 01:30:33,866
Baby, yes.

01:32:02,992 --> 01:32:06,291
We need this story in four days.
Now I wanna know how it's shaping up.

1231
01:32:11,133 --> 01:32:13,863
It's a think-piece
about a mid-level band...

1232
01:32:13,936 --> 01:32:17,394
struggling with theirown limitations
in theharsh face ofstardom.

1233
01:32:18,507 --> 01:32:19,701
That's great.

1234
01:32:22,111 --> 01:32:24,602
I like what we're saying.

1235
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:26,614
Let me try and getyou
a thousand more words.

1236
01:32:26,682 --> 01:32:29,515

1237
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:32,679

Me too.
Greenville is so boring.

1242
01:32:45,034 --> 01:32:48,162
You know, any other city
in the world...

1243
01:32:48,237 --> 01:32:49,761
and you'd still be a virgin.

1244
01:32:49,839 --> 01:32:53,935
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- What?

1245
01:32:54,009 --> 01:32:57,410
I've neverwritten anything more
than a few pages in mywhole life.

1246
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,072
Don't worry, baby, you will.

1247
01:32:59,148 --> 01:33:03,107
I gotta find Russell.
I gotta find Russell.

1248
01:33:03,185 --> 01:33:04,652
Oh, will you take the laundry?

1249
01:33:06,055 --> 01:33:07,454
Take the laundry?

1250
01:33:08,657 --> 01:33:11,649

Good morning.

1254
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:47,428
Please go the fuck away!

1255
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:45,352
Hey, man, we'll, uh,
do the interview in Cleveland.

1256
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:49,422
I can't go to Cleveland.

1257
01:34:49,491 --> 01:34:52,016
Come on, man.
We'll have more time there.

1258
01:34:53,729 --> 01:34:54,718
Don't be tense.

1259
01:34:57,666 --> 01:35:00,794
- Come to Cleveland.
- Come to Cleveland.

1260
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:06,063
I can't go to Cleveland.

1261
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:08,871
Hey, can we help it
ifwe like having you around?

1262
01:35:12,514 --> 01:35:14,414
I don't wanna go
to Cleveland!

1263
01:35:14,483 --> 01:35:18,112
Okay? I want to go home.

1264
01:35:20,322 --> 01:35:22,813
That's good, man.
I like it when you yell.

1265
01:35:22,891 --> 01:35:26,793
But I'm not gonna letyou miss out

1266
01:35:26,862 --> 01:35:29,228
- Rock mecca.
- Hey, you're with us.

1267
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:31,597

1268
01:35:32,334 --> 01:35:34,825
- Rock...
- And roll.

1269
01:35:34,903 --> 01:35:37,804
- It's all--
- I know. I know.

1270
01:35:37,873 --> 01:35:40,341
It's all happening.

1271
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:56,657
Hi.

1272
01:35:58,761 --> 01:36:00,695

you know?

1276
01:36:08,404 --> 01:36:11,373
New stuff-- I mean,
Ziggy Stardust is good, but it's--

1277
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:14,534
It's mass media, you know?
It's hamburgers for the apocalypse.

1278
01:36:16,612 --> 01:36:20,446
It's Bowie! Bowie!
Bowie!

1279
01:36:47,843 --> 01:36:49,606

into replacing me.

1345
01:41:42,571 --> 01:41:45,938
His name is Dennis Hope.
I knowyou've all heard ofhim.

1346
01:41:46,008 --> 01:41:48,306
He's got all the big bands,
and he's outside right now...

1347
01:41:48,377 --> 01:41:50,368
and he wants five minutes with you.

1348
01:41:50,445 --> 01:41:53,209
And, well, I think
we've gotta do this.

1349
01:41:55,617 --> 01:41:57,016
- Well, send him in.
- Yeah, bring him in.

1350
01:41:57,085 --> 01:42:00,543
- We'll send him out on a rail!
- All right.

1351
01:42:00,622 --> 01:42:03,853
We'll finish the interview in Maryland.
You can fly home from Maryland, okay?

1352
01:42:08,964 --> 01:42:12,024
Hey, we've already got a manager.
He's been with us from the beginning.

1353
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:14,466
Respectfully.
We all have our roots.

1354
01:42:14,536 --> 01:42:16,731
I believe in bands
holding on to their roots.

1355
01:42:16,805 --> 01:42:18,397
Those roots need to be augmented.

1356
01:42:20,008 --> 01:42:21,942
I'm gonna tell you
the truth.

1357
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:25,502
I may enrage some
and enthrall others.

1358
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:27,514
I don't really give a fuck.

1359
01:42:27,582 --> 01:42:30,676
Your manager here
needs a manager.

1360
01:42:30,752 --> 01:42:34,085
Example-- ifyou hadn't have run out
on your contract in Phoenix...

1361
01:42:34,156 --> 01:42:36,818
we could have sued
over Russell's hand.

1362
01:42:36,892 --> 01:42:40,658
Butyou left, negating the contract,
forfeiting the deposit.

1363
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:44,324
You effectively traveled a long way
to pay that promoter to electrocuteyou.

1364
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,868
Okay, your damages have putyou
way in the hole for this tour.

1365
01:42:47,936 --> 01:42:49,528
Right now, you owe the record company
more than you've got.

1366
01:42:50,839 --> 01:42:52,932
Butyour record's selling.
There's money to be made.

1367
01:42:53,008 --> 01:42:56,444
So I brought a plane in. We could add
more shows to make up the difference.

1368
01:42:56,511 --> 01:43:00,242
- Respectfully.
- We travel by bus.

1369
01:43:00,315 --> 01:43:02,044
Doris is the soul ofthis band.

1370
01:43:02,117 --> 01:43:05,848
That bus has been our home since
we were theJeff Bebe band. No way.

1371
01:43:05,921 --> 01:43:09,254
Hey, man, I'd travel on a pogo stick
ifI thought we could make more money.

1372
01:43:09,324 --> 01:43:10,882
You could play more dates
with a plane.

1373
01:43:10,959 --> 01:43:14,918
Well, it's not about money. It's about
playing music and turning people on.

1374
01:43:14,996 --> 01:43:16,964
Clearly. Respectfully.

1375
01:43:17,032 --> 01:43:19,398
But on the distasteful subject
ofmoney...

1376
01:43:19,468 --> 01:43:22,869
just know thatyou're all
making it right now.

1377
01:43:24,406 --> 01:43:27,239
And it's all out there.

1378
01:43:27,309 --> 01:43:29,971
I'm just talking about
bringing it back here.

1379
01:43:31,847 --> 01:43:33,747
Why should we payyou for something
we can do ourselves?

1380
01:43:33,815 --> 01:43:35,282
Doyou know how to keep
from getting charged...

1381
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:39,081
for the ice below the floorboards
at Chicago Stadium?

1382
01:43:39,154 --> 01:43:40,883
Doyou know how to do
a headlining tour?

1383
01:43:40,956 --> 01:43:43,789
Doyou know Claire Rothman
at the L.A. Forum?

1384
01:43:43,859 --> 01:43:47,488
Doyou know Bobby Cowan,
Danny Marcus, Lisa Robinson?

1385
01:43:48,964 --> 01:43:52,229
Doyou know Frank Barcelona?
This is Cleveland!

1386
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:55,235
Where's Kid Leo?
Where is he?

1387
01:43:55,303 --> 01:43:57,794
Doyou know how to get a record
not pressed, but played?

1388
01:43:57,873 --> 01:44:02,503
I didn't invent the rainy day, man.
I just own the best umbrella.

1389
01:44:02,577 --> 01:44:06,570
And as much as you may believe that
this is gonna last forever, it does not.

1390
01:44:06,648 --> 01:44:10,812
Your biggest fan right now--
your biggest fan--

1391
01:44:10,886 --> 01:44:12,410
soon they're gonna want
to go to college...

1392
01:44:12,487 --> 01:44:14,216
gonna want to buy some clothes...

1393
01:44:14,289 --> 01:44:16,280
spend that money
some otherway.

1394
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:19,359
And you know what?

1395
01:44:19,427 --> 01:44:22,328
They'll tapeyour record
from a friend's copy.

1396
01:44:22,397 --> 01:44:26,424
You gotta take whatyou can,
when you can, whileyou can...

1397
01:44:26,501 --> 01:44:27,798
and you gotta do it now.

1398
01:44:27,869 --> 01:44:30,633
That's what the big boys do.

1399
01:44:30,705 --> 01:44:32,332
Because ifyou think MickJagger'll
still be out there...

1400
01:44:32,407 --> 01:44:37,174
trying to be a rock star at age 50,
you're sadly, sadly mistaken.

1401
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:41,249
Yes, well, uh,
thankyou, Dennis.

1402
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:42,544
We'll, uh, we'll think
about whatyou said.

1403
01:44:42,617 --> 01:44:47,816
Oh, no, you--you don't understand.
I'll think about it.

1404
01:44:47,889 --> 01:44:50,221
I'm not auditioning.

1405
01:44:50,292 --> 01:44:54,285
I came here to decide
whether I want to representyou.

1406
01:44:54,362 --> 01:44:57,331
So I'll stand outside
for a moment and...

1407
01:44:57,399 --> 01:44:59,731
think about
whether I want to stay.

1408
01:45:01,937 --> 01:45:03,336
It was a good show.

1409
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:17,578
I miss him already.

1410
01:45:18,653 --> 01:45:22,680
I'm tellingyou, you're comingalongat
a very dangerous time forrockandroll.

1411
01:45:22,757 --> 01:45:25,191
The waris over.
They won...

1412
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:27,194
andthey willruin rockandroll...

1413
01:45:27,262 --> 01:45:30,698
andstrangle everything
we loveaboutit.

1414
01:46:51,212 --> 01:46:52,577
Put them up.
All right.

1415
01:46:53,348 --> 01:46:56,181
- I don't know what that was.
- It was a donkey dick, man!

1416
01:46:56,785 --> 01:46:58,844
No matterwhereyou come from,
a donkey dick is funny.

1417
01:46:58,920 --> 01:46:59,909
It ain't funny, man.

1418
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:03,852
- Can I helpyou?
- Is Russell Hammond here?

1419
01:47:03,925 --> 01:47:05,688
Hey, the Enemy!
Come on in, son.

1420
01:47:09,731 --> 01:47:12,461
Welcome to the road manager
poker party.

1421
01:47:12,534 --> 01:47:17,062
This game's been going on for twoyears.
Come on, find a spot.

1422
01:47:17,138 --> 01:47:19,129
- This is Mick. He's with The Who.
- Howyou doing?

1423
01:47:19,207 --> 01:47:22,438
This is Raymond. He's with the Eagles.
This is Reg. He's with Humble Pie.

1424
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:23,875
- I thinkyou know Red Dog.
- Hey, brother!

1425
01:47:25,113 --> 01:47:27,843
We've been developing this system
ofpoker over theyears...

1426
01:47:27,916 --> 01:47:30,714
soyou can play it
in any condition, which helps.

1427
01:47:30,785 --> 01:47:33,652
We only let Russell in
because he brought the hash.

1428
01:47:33,722 --> 01:47:35,587
Easy, easy.
The press is here.

1429
01:47:35,657 --> 01:47:37,989
Don't mention me
orThe Eagles.

1430
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:39,816
Well, I'm done.

1431
01:47:39,894 --> 01:47:42,124
- Uh, I'm out.
- Out. I'm out.

1432
01:47:42,197 --> 01:47:44,188
- All right, I'm in.
- All right, all right.

1433
01:47:44,265 --> 01:47:47,564
Side proposition to the winner.

1434
01:47:47,635 --> 01:47:49,728
For 50 bucks and a case of Heineken...

1435
01:47:49,804 --> 01:47:51,738
I'll throw into the pot
three lovely ladies...

1436
01:47:51,806 --> 01:47:54,707
including Miss Penny Lane
and the famous Band Aids...

1437
01:47:54,776 --> 01:47:59,679
who have to leave the tour
before New York.

1438
01:47:59,748 --> 01:48:02,546
- Is that okaywith you?
- Russ is getting soft on us.

1439
01:48:03,785 --> 01:48:07,619
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

1440
01:48:07,689 --> 01:48:10,123
- It's a deal.
- Show 'em.

1441
01:48:11,493 --> 01:48:14,428
Three lovely ladies
in the custody of Humble Pie.

1442
01:48:14,496 --> 01:48:19,126
- Be good to 'em, Reg.
- We oweyou $50 and a case of Heineken.

1443
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,326
All right.

1444
01:48:20,402 --> 01:48:23,701
-Joint?
-You know how I know this is good stuff?

1445
01:48:23,772 --> 01:48:25,467
- How's that?
- This is from Crosby.

1446
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:27,940
- Is that the Crosbyweed?
- Yeah, this is from Crosby.

1447
01:48:28,009 --> 01:48:30,978
- Oh, I'm in.
- I'm in.

1448
01:48:33,181 --> 01:48:35,012
Give me this.
Give me a light. I want fire.

1449
01:48:35,083 --> 01:48:38,780
Look, nobody's feelings
are getting hurt here.

1450
01:48:38,853 --> 01:48:40,787
She already knows that Leslie's coming
to New York tomorrow.

1451
01:48:40,855 --> 01:48:43,050
Everybody understands.

1452
01:48:43,124 --> 01:48:46,218
This is the circus.
Everybody's trying not to go home.

1453
01:48:46,294 --> 01:48:49,422
- Nobody's saying good-bye.
- Would you like some?

1454
01:48:49,497 --> 01:48:51,124
- I may.
- How many?

1455
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,463
Quit looking at me like that.

1456
01:49:17,192 --> 01:49:20,127
Happy, happybirthday
Happy, happybirthday

1457
01:49:20,195 --> 01:49:23,790
Happy, happybirthday
Happy, happybirthday

1458
01:49:23,865 --> 01:49:27,232
Happy, happybirthday
toyou

1459
01:49:31,339 --> 01:49:32,431
I'm making a wish.

1460
01:49:42,283 --> 01:49:47,880
So... Penny, our friend,
has gained anotheryear...

1461
01:49:47,956 --> 01:49:50,925
but long ago
she threw it in gear.

1462
01:49:50,992 --> 01:49:55,429
She rocked the South,
the East, the West.

1463
01:49:55,497 --> 01:49:57,260
Could we get off
this endless tour...

1464
01:49:57,332 --> 01:50:00,665
where we're Black Sabbath's
fucking special guest?

1465
01:50:00,735 --> 01:50:02,202
Yes!

1466
01:50:03,071 --> 01:50:04,663
She says she's retired...

1467
01:50:04,739 --> 01:50:06,866
but we've
heard that before.

1468
01:50:08,009 --> 01:50:11,809
She chose us.
In Penny Lane we trust.

1469
01:50:12,914 --> 01:50:14,973
She is a fan
ofthis band...

1470
01:50:17,185 --> 01:50:19,210
- much more so than us.
- Yeah!

1471
01:50:28,663 --> 01:50:32,121
- Cut the cake
- Let's go!

1472
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:34,468
Who wants it?

1473
01:50:47,749 --> 01:50:50,047
Thankyou, baby.

1474
01:50:55,456 --> 01:50:58,016
Who wants the ''P''
in Penny?

1475
01:50:58,092 --> 01:51:01,425
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thankyou.

1476
01:51:01,496 --> 01:51:03,589
I'm sorry
the plane isn't bigger.

1477
01:51:35,496 --> 01:51:36,929
Who didn't get cake?

1478
01:51:48,009 --> 01:51:51,945
Any extra plates? Anybody?

1479
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:57,150
You thinkyoucan foolme.

1480
01:51:57,218 --> 01:52:01,655
I can read you.
I know whatyou're thinking.

1481
01:52:01,723 --> 01:52:05,819
- What's that?
- You're worried about me and Russell.

1482
01:52:08,963 --> 01:52:11,488
Yeah, I gotta work on that.

1483
01:52:11,566 --> 01:52:14,228
You're so sweet.

1484
01:52:14,302 --> 01:52:18,033
God, ifthere was more ofyou in him.

1485
01:52:18,106 --> 01:52:22,008
Don't tell me this stuff.
I wanna like him.

1486
01:52:24,879 --> 01:52:26,278
Did you miss a test or something?

1487
01:52:28,383 --> 01:52:32,649
- You have no idea.
- Look, I know I'm not on the plane.

1488
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,654
I'm not going
on some other band's bus.

1489
01:52:34,722 --> 01:52:37,418
I could go with the Stillwater road crew
but that would be pathetic...

1490
01:52:37,492 --> 01:52:39,483
and the girls are all going
with Humble Pie.

1491
01:52:40,795 --> 01:52:43,286
So, ifyou could find out
from Russell--

1492
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:46,367
Forget it.
I'm flying to New York myself.

1493
01:52:46,434 --> 01:52:49,267
I've got a bunch ofpartial tickets.
I know his ex-wife...

1494
01:52:49,337 --> 01:52:50,804
current-girlfriend thing
is gonna be there.

1495
01:52:50,872 --> 01:52:52,840
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

1496
01:52:52,907 --> 01:52:57,207
What areyou saying?
Did Russell say something?

1497
01:52:57,278 --> 01:53:01,271
- I don't know anything.
- Well, I know he wants me there.

1498
01:53:01,349 --> 01:53:05,285
Wake up!
Don't go to New York.

1499
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:09,383
- Why areyou yelling at me?
- I thought we were going to Morocco.

1500
01:53:09,457 --> 01:53:12,620
There is no Morocco.
There's never been a Morocco.

1501
01:53:12,694 --> 01:53:15,162
There's not even a Penny Lane.

1502
01:53:15,229 --> 01:53:17,823
I don't even know
your real name.

1503
01:53:17,899 --> 01:53:20,834
IfI ever met a man
in the real world...

1504
01:53:20,902 --> 01:53:22,529
who looked at me
the wayyoujust looked at me--

1505
01:53:22,603 --> 01:53:26,232
When and where
does this ''real world'' occur?

1506
01:53:26,307 --> 01:53:30,471
I mean, I am really confused here.
All these rules...

1507
01:53:30,545 --> 01:53:32,979
and all these sayings and nicknames.

1508
01:53:33,047 --> 01:53:37,507
Honey, you're too sweet
for rock and roll.

1509
01:53:37,585 --> 01:53:41,521
Sweet? Where doyou get off?

1510
01:53:41,589 --> 01:53:43,489
Where doyou get sweet?

1511
01:53:43,558 --> 01:53:46,254
I am dark and mysterious
and pissed off!.

1512
01:53:46,327 --> 01:53:49,160
And I could be very dangerous
to all ofyou.

1513
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:51,357
I am not sweet!

1514
01:53:51,432 --> 01:53:55,698
And you should know that about me.
I am the Enemy!

1515
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:57,965
Look, you should be happy for me.

1516
01:53:58,039 --> 01:54:00,667
You don't know
what he says to me in private.

1517
01:54:00,742 --> 01:54:04,007
Maybe it is love,
as much as it can be for somebody--

1518
01:54:04,078 --> 01:54:07,844
Who sold you to Humble Pie
for 50 bucks and a case ofbeer?

1519
01:54:08,783 --> 01:54:10,614
I was there.

1520
01:54:10,685 --> 01:54:13,518
I was there!

1521
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:21,995
Oh, God.

1522
01:54:26,334 --> 01:54:28,302
I'm sorry.

1523
01:54:41,449 --> 01:54:43,883
What kind ofbeer?

1524
01:55:00,535 --> 01:55:03,003
Welcome to New York!
It's okaytobenervous.

1525
01:55:03,070 --> 01:55:06,506
You should be nervous.
All you can do is beyourself...

1526
01:55:06,574 --> 01:55:08,565
and leave a pint ofblood
on that stage.

1527
01:55:09,844 --> 01:55:13,245
We showed you America.
We did everything but getyou laid.

1528
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:27,860
No. Yeah?

1529
01:55:48,082 --> 01:55:51,017
I'm from the Church of Lenny. We bow
to his will and all it represents.

1530
01:55:51,085 --> 01:55:53,849
He's the king
ofthe king ofkings.

1531
01:55:53,921 --> 01:55:56,856
- Can I get an autograph?
- Who should I make it out to?

1532
01:55:56,924 --> 01:55:58,915
- She's here.
- Make it out to Lenny.

1533
01:56:03,664 --> 01:56:05,689
- Russell, can I haveyour autograph?
- Yeah.

1534
01:56:06,834 --> 01:56:07,823

1535
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:10,904

1537
01:56:14,475 --> 01:56:16,636
- And, by the way, you look stunning.
- Thanks. Seeyou later.

1538
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:18,679
All right, bags in five!

1539
01:56:18,746 --> 01:56:20,805
Cars leave for the party at 6:00.

1540
01:56:27,321 --> 01:56:29,653
There are lighter souvenirs, you know.

1541
01:56:29,724 --> 01:56:33,660
Well, I kept thinking
I was gonna go home the next day.

1542
01:56:33,728 --> 01:56:37,357
Yeah, so did I...
1 5 years ago.

1543
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:40,565
That's the wrong bag,
you idiot!

1544
01:56:40,635 --> 01:56:43,399
- William?
- Vic.

1545
01:56:43,471 --> 01:56:46,668
It's all happening.
They're here.

1546
01:56:46,741 --> 01:56:48,766
Zeppelin are here.
They are here.

1547
01:56:48,843 --> 01:56:50,640
They're at the Plaza.

1548
01:56:50,711 --> 01:56:55,614
Sapphire and Miss Penny Lane
are there too.

1549
01:56:55,683 --> 01:56:59,744
They're all staying under the name
Emily Rugburn.

1550
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:01,253
Wait. Penny Lane is here?

1551
01:57:01,322 --> 01:57:04,758
- Emily Rugburn.

1552
01:57:04,825 --> 01:57:07,225

1561
01:57:34,188 --> 01:57:35,485
A mojo?

1562
01:57:35,556 --> 01:57:40,687
A mojo. It's a very modern machine
that transmits pages over the telephone.

1563
01:57:40,761 --> 01:57:43,252
It only takes 1 8 minutes a page.

1564
01:57:44,765 --> 01:57:47,029

Excuse me. You got an I.D.?

01:57:49,136 --> 01:57:50,728
No, thanks. I'm fine.

01:57:51,405 --> 01:57:54,374
- Hey, man. He's cool, he's cool.
- Hey, Dennis, howya doin'?

1568

01:58:13,995 --> 01:58:16,361

1570
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:19,866
I'm going to England with Deep Purple,

1571
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:24,829
Don't forget me,

1572
01:58:27,141 --> 01:58:30,975
It's all happening,
but I must ''vamoosh.''

1573
01:58:51,065 --> 01:58:53,056
Hey, The Enemy.

01:58:53,134 --> 01:58:56,399
Hey, we got a table. Come on.
They're all looking foryou.

1575
01:59:01,308 --> 01:59:02,400

1576
01:59:04,045 --> 01:59:05,376

01:59:09,016 --> 01:59:11,985
You're gonna be on the cover

1578
01:59:13,888 --> 01:59:15,583
Areyou serious?

1579
01:59:17,058 --> 01:59:18,491
The cover of RollingStone.

1580
01:59:20,594 --> 01:59:22,585
And we made it together.

1581
01:59:24,231 --> 01:59:26,426
- And they don'tjust put somebody...
- Thanks a lot.

1582
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:30,664

1585
01:59:38,879 --> 01:59:41,473
the Beatles were on the cover.

1586
01:59:41,549 --> 01:59:46,179
The Beatles.
Four ofthem, four ofus.

I want Annie Leibovitz
or Neal Preston.

1600
02:00:44,478 --> 02:00:47,174
I love Annie's stuff.
She does great stuff.

1601
02:02:28,515 --> 02:02:31,450
I am no good at good-byes.

1602
02:02:32,853 --> 02:02:34,878

Polexia went to England
with Deep Purple.

1607
02:02:49,303 --> 02:02:51,567
Can you believe that?

1608
02:02:51,639 --> 02:02:54,904
Even Sapphire went someplace else.

1609
02:02:54,975 --> 02:02:57,409
All she left was her Quaaludes.

1610
02:03:00,014 --> 02:03:01,481
Oh, wonderful.

Well, nobodywho didn't legally

1645
02:05:31,999 --> 02:05:33,728
But--

1646
02:05:33,801 --> 02:05:36,235
Oh, God, why am I so nervous?

1647
02:05:36,303 --> 02:05:39,170
You'll never remember this.

1648
02:05:39,239 --> 02:05:41,901
I loveyou...

1649
02:05:41,975 --> 02:05:46,571
and I'm about to boldly go where...

1650
02:05:46,647 --> 02:05:49,775
many men have gone before.

1651
02:05:58,425 --> 02:05:59,449
Okay, what do we got here?

1652
02:05:59,526 --> 02:06:01,187
- What's her name?
- Emily.

1653
02:06:01,261 --> 02:06:03,593
Okay, sweetheart,

Yes, you do.
Tell us whatyou took.

1658
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:15,865
Emily, we're gonna have
to pumpyour stomach, okay?

1659
02:06:15,943 --> 02:06:20,880
- Emily, wake up.
- We got the tubes. Here we go. Water.

1660
02:06:20,948 --> 02:06:23,508
All right, now, you're gonna
have to swallow this tube.

1661
02:06:23,584 --> 02:06:25,916
All right? Open, open, open.

1662
02:06:25,986 --> 02:06:28,921
- All right, come on.

1666
02:06:36,163 --> 02:06:38,427
Swallow. Emily, come on.

All done. There.

1670
02:06:45,539 --> 02:06:46,836
Now we gotta--
Come on.

1671
02:06:46,907 --> 02:06:49,876
Feed some liquid
intoyour stomach.

1672
02:07:20,207 --> 02:07:22,641
You'veneverdonehalf
the thingsyou'vesaidyoudid.

1673
02:07:24,011 --> 02:07:26,571
It was in the middle
of''Midnight Rambler,''

1674
02:07:26,647 --> 02:07:31,050
and Keith Richards
saw me...

1675
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:35,555
came to the front ofthe stage,
and he pulled me out.

1676
02:07:35,622 --> 02:07:38,819
And they
took me backstage...

1677
02:07:38,892 --> 02:07:44,262
and gave me a Coke
with ice and a lemon.

1678
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:48,200
And I neverwent home.

1679
02:07:49,403 --> 02:07:53,066
I've done twice the things
I said I did.

1680
02:07:54,508 --> 02:07:55,941
What aboutyour mom?

1681
02:07:59,112 --> 02:08:01,842
She always said, ''Marry up.

1682
02:08:01,915 --> 02:08:04,941
Marry someone grand.''

1683
02:08:05,018 --> 02:08:07,953
And that's why she named me ''Lady.''

1684
02:08:09,856 --> 02:08:11,790
She named you ''Lady''?

1685
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:16,090
Lady Goodman.

1686
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:20,466
Lady Goodman-- that's great.

1687
02:08:20,534 --> 02:08:24,971
Nowyou know all my secrets.
You've got me.

1688
02:08:27,741 --> 02:08:29,709
Seeyou back in the real world.

1689
02:08:31,078 --> 02:08:34,673
Thankyou, William Miller.

1690
02:09:05,545 --> 02:09:06,534

02:10:40,006 --> 02:10:42,474
He was sitting at our table forwhat had

1701
02:10:42,542 --> 02:10:44,100
- Yeah.
-Just rapping.

1702
02:10:44,177 --> 02:10:47,669
Bob Dylan at our fucking table.
I was looking foryou.

1703
02:10:47,748 --> 02:10:50,444
- I was gonna introduceyou.
- What happened toyou last night?

1704
02:10:50,517 --> 02:10:53,145
It's a long story.

1705
02:10:58,258 --> 02:11:01,250
PeggySue, PeggySue

1706
02:11:01,328 --> 02:11:03,956
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
PeggySue

1707
02:11:04,030 --> 02:11:05,657
Hi, this is Craig, yourpilot.

1708
02:11:05,732 --> 02:11:07,700
Itappears we've caught the edge
ofthatelectricalstorm...

1709
02:11:07,768 --> 02:11:09,133
- we were trying to outrun.
- Oh, my God.

1710
02:11:09,202 --> 02:11:11,500
- Electrical storm?
- Sobuckle up tightnow.

1711
02:11:11,571 --> 02:11:12,663
- We'regonna do ourbesthere.
- Rock and roll.

1712
02:11:12,739 --> 02:11:14,866
We shouldn't be here.

1713
02:11:15,976 --> 02:11:18,570
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa, baby!

1714
02:11:22,315 --> 02:11:23,976
Doris, wemissyou!

1715
02:11:26,753 --> 02:11:29,984
All right, listen.
We're gonna try and land in Tupelo.

1716
02:11:30,056 --> 02:11:32,957
- We found a field to land in.
- A field?

1717
02:11:33,026 --> 02:11:34,459
I can't breathe, man.

1718
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:37,554
It's gonna be kind ofa rough set-down,
but we should be fine.

1719
02:11:37,631 --> 02:11:40,657
Just hang in there,
and we'll getyou out ofthis.

1720
02:11:44,738 --> 02:11:48,765
Everyone says
it's so glamorous out here.

1721
02:11:48,842 --> 02:11:51,310
- Hejust told us we're gonna die.
- We're gonna die?

1722
02:11:51,378 --> 02:11:52,970
...Thywill be done on Earth--

1723
02:11:53,046 --> 02:11:55,071
I'm trying to maintain,
but the fucking thing won't--

1724
02:11:57,017 --> 02:11:58,177
Oh, my God!

1725
02:12:00,654 --> 02:12:05,318
Ifsomething should happen--
Maybe I never said this enough.

1726
02:12:06,393 --> 02:12:08,122
I love all ofyou.

1727
02:12:14,868 --> 02:12:18,804
I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
A hit and run.

1728
02:12:18,872 --> 02:12:23,832
I hit him andjust kept on going.
I don't know ifhe's alive or dead...

1729
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:25,468
but I'm sorry.

1730
02:12:25,545 --> 02:12:27,706
Not a day goes by
I don't see his face.

1731
02:12:27,781 --> 02:12:31,217
Oh, my God!

1732
02:12:31,284 --> 02:12:35,186
Look, I loveyou all too.
You're like family to me.

1733
02:12:35,255 --> 02:12:37,189
Especially since Marna left me.
And listen, fellas...

1734
02:12:37,257 --> 02:12:40,693
I just wantyou to know, ifI took
an extra dollar or two here and there...

1735
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:42,660
it's because I knew I'd earned it.

1736
02:12:42,729 --> 02:12:45,892
- Yeah. I slept with Marna, Dick.
- I did too.

1737
02:12:45,966 --> 02:12:49,697
I waited until you broke up with her,
but me too.

1738
02:12:51,805 --> 02:12:55,206
I also slept with Leslie,
when you were fighting.

1739
02:12:55,275 --> 02:12:58,904
- You slept withJeff?
- Yeah, but it didn't count.

1740
02:12:58,979 --> 02:13:01,709
It was the summerwe decided
to be free ofall rules.

1741
02:13:01,781 --> 02:13:04,045
And you sayyou love me!

1742
02:13:04,117 --> 02:13:06,585
I don't loveyou, man.
I never did.

1743
02:13:06,653 --> 02:13:08,883
None ofus loveyou.

1744
02:13:08,955 --> 02:13:11,515
You act above us.
You always have.

1745
02:13:11,591 --> 02:13:13,354
Finally, the truth.

1746
02:13:13,426 --> 02:13:16,361
Youjust held it over us,
likeyou might leave.

1747
02:13:16,429 --> 02:13:20,331
Like we're lucky to be with you.
And we had to live with it, man.

1748
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:22,425
I had to live with you.

1749
02:13:22,502 --> 02:13:26,268
And now I might die with you,
and it's not fucking fair.

1750
02:13:26,339 --> 02:13:27,636
Please, enough!

1751
02:13:31,011 --> 02:13:33,605
And I'm still in love with you,
Leslie.

1752
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:36,547
Oh, I don't wanna hear any more.
Shut up,Jeffrey!

1753
02:13:37,517 --> 02:13:39,576
- It's all happening.
- What the fuck!

1754
02:13:39,653 --> 02:13:43,282
- Whatever happens, Bebe, you're dead.
- Don't be self-righteous, Russell.

1755
02:13:43,356 --> 02:13:44,846
Not now, man.

1756
02:13:44,925 --> 02:13:48,292
You were sleeping with Penny,
that fucking groupie...

1757
02:13:48,361 --> 02:13:50,124
last summer up until yesterday.

1758
02:13:50,196 --> 02:13:51,788
Why don'tyou tell Leslie that?

1759
02:13:51,865 --> 02:13:53,924
- Shut up!
- I quit!

1760
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,127
- I'm gonna kill you!
- I quit!

1761
02:13:56,202 --> 02:13:57,931
''That groupie''?

1762
02:13:58,004 --> 02:14:02,566
She was a Band Aid.
All she did was loveyour band.

1763
02:14:02,642 --> 02:14:04,610
And you all used her.

1764
02:14:04,678 --> 02:14:08,079
All ofyou.
You used her and threw her away.

1765
02:14:08,148 --> 02:14:12,312
She almost died last night
whileyou were with Bob Dylan.

1766
02:14:12,385 --> 02:14:16,253
You guys, you're always talking
about the fans, the fans, the fans.

1767
02:14:16,323 --> 02:14:18,484
She was your biggest fan.

1768
02:14:18,558 --> 02:14:20,583
And you threw her away.

1769
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:25,188
And ifyou can't see that,
that's your biggest problem.

1770
02:14:25,265 --> 02:14:27,756
And I love her!
I love her!

1771
02:14:37,644 --> 02:14:39,669
Fuck it!

1772
02:14:39,746 --> 02:14:42,772
I'm-- I'm gay!

1773
02:14:56,763 --> 02:15:01,200
Thank God, we're alive!
We're alive! We're gonna make it!

1774
02:15:01,267 --> 02:15:03,201
- We're out in the clear now.
- Sweet relief!.

1775
02:15:03,269 --> 02:15:06,136
Sweet life!
Hallelujah, dear God!

1776
02:15:06,206 --> 02:15:09,369
We made it. We're alive.

1777
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:16,074
Write whatyou want.

1778
02:16:51,144 --> 02:16:54,136
Just leaveyour package
on the desk.

1779
02:16:54,214 --> 02:16:57,274
Oh, I'm not a messenger.
I'm one ofyourwriters.

1780
02:16:57,350 --> 02:16:59,511
William H. Miller.

1781
02:17:06,926 --> 02:17:08,723
It'sjust a kid!

1782
02:17:11,998 --> 02:17:13,989
Go right on in.

1783
02:17:37,991 --> 02:17:39,959
You're William Miller?

1784
02:17:42,028 --> 02:17:44,826
- Yep.
- Oh, baby.

1785
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:50,336
Didn't anything happen? I mean,
after $600 in room-service bills?

1786
02:17:50,403 --> 02:17:52,871
Didn'tyou get anything on tape
with Russell Hammond?

1787
02:17:52,939 --> 02:17:55,237
And where wereyou in this piece?
What did you wanna write?

1788
02:17:55,308 --> 02:17:57,538
Because this reads
like what theywanted you to write.

1789
02:17:57,610 --> 02:17:59,475
You obviously saw more
than you wrote about.

1790
02:17:59,546 --> 02:18:02,174
- Something must have happened.
- Let's push up Flippo's Who cover.

1791
02:18:02,248 --> 02:18:05,149
Good, 'cause it's gonna take me
three days to get through this research.

1792
02:18:05,218 --> 02:18:08,813
It's all handwritten
on little bits ofpaper.

1793
02:18:08,888 --> 02:18:11,686
- It's a puff-piece.
- They refer to the women as ''chicks.''

1794
02:18:11,758 --> 02:18:13,487
-As a woman, I have a problem with that.
-You want 'em to likeyou.

1795
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:14,993
- I know it's a side issue.
- It happens.

1796
02:18:15,061 --> 02:18:19,327
- It's embarrassing.
- Ben! You told me to send what I had.

1797
02:18:19,399 --> 02:18:22,766
It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.

1798
02:18:57,036 --> 02:19:01,405
Oh, man, youmade friends with 'em.

1799
02:19:02,942 --> 02:19:06,105
See, friendship is the booze
they feed you...

1800
02:19:06,179 --> 02:19:09,148
'cause theywantyou to get drunk
and feel likeyou belong.

1801
02:19:09,215 --> 02:19:11,843
Well, it was fun.

1802
02:19:11,918 --> 02:19:15,149
Because they makeyou feel cool.

1803
02:19:15,221 --> 02:19:20,215
- And, hey, I metyou. You are not cool.
- Iknow.

1804
02:19:20,293 --> 02:19:23,660
Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.

1805
02:19:23,730 --> 02:19:27,188
Because we are uncool.

1806
02:19:27,267 --> 02:19:30,862
While women will always be
a problem for guys like us...

1807
02:19:30,937 --> 02:19:35,704
most ofthe great art in the world
is about that very problem.

1808
02:19:35,775 --> 02:19:39,176
Good-looking people--
they got no spine.

1809
02:19:39,245 --> 02:19:42,271
Their art never lasts.

1810
02:19:42,348 --> 02:19:44,475
They get the girls,
but we're smarter.

1811
02:19:46,552 --> 02:19:50,579
- Yeah, I can really see that now.
- Yeah, 'causegreatartisabout...

1812
02:19:50,657 --> 02:19:52,648
you know, guilt and longing...

1813
02:19:52,725 --> 02:19:55,660
and, you know,
love disguised as sex...

1814
02:19:55,728 --> 02:19:57,753
and sex disguised as love.

1815
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:02,290
Hey, let's faceit.
Yougotabigheadstart.

1816
02:20:02,368 --> 02:20:03,630
I'm glad you were home.

1817
02:20:03,703 --> 02:20:06,604
I'm always home.
I'm uncool.

1818
02:20:06,673 --> 02:20:09,938
- Me too.
- You're doinggreat, youknow?

1819
02:20:10,009 --> 02:20:12,705
The only true currency
in this bankrupt world...

1820
02:20:12,779 --> 02:20:16,374
is whatyou share with someone else
when you're uncool.

1821
02:20:16,449 --> 02:20:19,748
Listen, myadvice toyou--

1822
02:20:19,819 --> 02:20:23,152
andIknowyou think
theseguysareyour friends--

1823
02:20:23,222 --> 02:20:25,315
ifyou wanna be a true friend to them...

1824
02:20:25,391 --> 02:20:30,852
be honest and unmerciful.

1825
02:20:30,930 --> 02:20:33,922
''I'm flying high
overTupelo, Mississippi...

1826
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,560
with America's hottest band...

1827
02:20:36,636 --> 02:20:39,628
and we're all about to die.''

1828
02:20:39,706 --> 02:20:43,369
- Dark, lively.
- Yeah, yeah, and it gets better.

1829
02:20:43,443 --> 02:20:46,901
- Did this all really happen?
- I'll call and check the quotes.

1830
02:20:51,150 --> 02:20:54,813
Holy shit! I just got offthe phone
with RollingStone.

1831
02:20:54,887 --> 02:20:57,082
They called me too.
What's he using?

1832
02:20:57,156 --> 02:21:00,557
All-- he's using it all.
This, according to the ''fact-checker.''

1833
02:21:00,626 --> 02:21:02,355
So what?

1834
02:21:02,428 --> 02:21:05,761
''So what''?
We come offlike amateurs...

1835
02:21:05,832 --> 02:21:10,132
some average band trying to come
to grips with success...

1836
02:21:10,203 --> 02:21:12,763
jealous and fighting
and breaking up.

1837
02:21:12,839 --> 02:21:14,932
We're buffoons.

1838
02:21:15,008 --> 02:21:17,568
''Rock and roll can save the world''?

1839
02:21:17,643 --> 02:21:21,409
''The chicks are great''?
I sound like a dick.

1840
02:21:21,481 --> 02:21:24,006
- You are a dick.
- I never said that.

1841
02:21:24,083 --> 02:21:26,381
Maybe wejust don't see ourselves
the waywe really are.

1842
02:21:26,452 --> 02:21:30,684
Is it that hard
to make us look cool?

1843
02:21:30,757 --> 02:21:34,386
This kid has you on acid screaming,
''I'm a golden god'' from a fan's rooftop.

1844
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:38,954
They used him to fuck us. They'll
probablyjust putyou on the cover.

1845
02:21:39,032 --> 02:21:41,330
Wait. I never said,
''I'm a golden god.''

1846
02:21:43,836 --> 02:21:45,326
Or did I?

1847
02:21:45,405 --> 02:21:48,374
We never took him seriously.
Now it's serious.

1848
02:21:48,441 --> 02:21:50,705
I liked him as a person.

1849
02:21:50,777 --> 02:21:53,940
He was never a person.
He was ajournalist!

1850
02:21:54,013 --> 02:21:58,643
You! You had
the right idea all along!

1851
02:21:58,718 --> 02:22:01,812
- How about the plane flight?
- It's all there.

1852
02:22:01,888 --> 02:22:04,379
Don't worry.
It's unspecific who says what.

1853
02:22:04,457 --> 02:22:07,051
No names are mentioned
in the more embarrassing sequences.

1854
02:22:07,126 --> 02:22:11,688
It'sjust completely obvious
who's who, and we're fucked!

1855
02:22:11,764 --> 02:22:13,891
I told him he could write
what he wanted.

1856
02:22:17,870 --> 02:22:20,361
Hey, they haven't talked
to Russell yet.

1857
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:23,204
You can always deny the key stuff
to the fact checker.

1858
02:22:23,276 --> 02:22:25,073
One phone call.
Then they can't print it.

1859
02:22:25,144 --> 02:22:26,839
Is that true?

1860
02:22:26,913 --> 02:22:28,847
This is war, my friend.

1861
02:22:28,915 --> 02:22:31,179
Ifyou'd have met me earlier,
he would have never been around.

1862
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:33,684
He'll live.

1863
02:22:33,753 --> 02:22:35,687
Let's identify
the goals here.

1864
02:22:35,755 --> 02:22:40,749
T-shirts, foreign markets, renegotiating
your contract, merchandising.

1865
02:22:40,827 --> 02:22:45,127
Happiness.
Realizing your dreams.

1866
02:22:45,198 --> 02:22:46,825
Money. Cool.

1867
02:22:46,899 --> 02:22:49,231
Meeting the Beatles.

1868
02:22:49,302 --> 02:22:51,270
Let's put all ofit in the pot.

1869
02:22:51,337 --> 02:22:54,329
It all depends on mystique.

1870
02:22:55,341 --> 02:22:56,501
Not giving too much away.

1871
02:22:58,377 --> 02:23:00,868
I'm going to L.A. tonight.
Call me ifyou need me.

1872
02:23:00,947 --> 02:23:05,077
But before I go, let me
giveyou a lesson in mystique.

1873
02:23:05,151 --> 02:23:07,676
You can only have one.
Which one doyou want?

1874
02:23:09,088 --> 02:23:10,885
Which one
areyou gonna choose?

1875
02:23:13,526 --> 02:23:15,585
As long as you can't see
what's in this hand...

1876
02:23:17,663 --> 02:23:18,960
you'll always want it more.

1877
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:26,234
It's phenomenal, William,
to be quite honest with you.

1878
02:23:26,305 --> 02:23:29,502
It's sophisticated, intelligent. We
only had to cut out a couple of'graphs.

1879
02:23:29,575 --> 02:23:32,601
Jeff Bebe's mother already sent over a
whole shoe box full ofchildhood photos.

1880
02:23:32,678 --> 02:23:35,044
- She did?
- But it's really gonna look fantastic.

1881
02:23:35,114 --> 02:23:40,074
The bandjust denied 90 percent
ofthe story. It's a fabrication.

1882
02:23:40,153 --> 02:23:43,816
You weren't honest.
And worse, you wasted our time.

1883
02:23:45,691 --> 02:23:47,818
Did you talk to Russell Hammond?

1884
02:23:47,894 --> 02:23:50,021
Russell Hammond is the one
who denied it.

1885
02:23:50,096 --> 02:23:52,223
- Now wait a second.
- Denied it.

1886
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:57,126
We're going with The Who.
Manuscript's in my office.

1887
02:23:57,203 --> 02:23:59,467
He'sjust some fan.
What doyou expect?

1888
02:23:59,539 --> 02:24:01,939
So, anyway, put those two pieces--

1889
02:24:02,008 --> 02:24:03,373
Ben. Wait.

1890
02:24:28,034 --> 02:24:30,093
You guys, this is my brother.

1891
02:24:30,169 --> 02:24:33,730
- Nice to finally meetyou.
- You have a good day.

1892
02:24:34,974 --> 02:24:36,908
You guys, I'll deadhead back later.

1893
02:24:36,976 --> 02:24:39,069
I think I'm needed.

1894
02:24:41,047 --> 02:24:43,242
I'll seeyou.

1895
02:24:49,021 --> 02:24:53,754
You look awful, but it's great.

1896
02:24:53,826 --> 02:24:55,953
You're living your life.

1897
02:24:56,028 --> 02:24:59,088
You're free of Mom.

1898
02:25:02,435 --> 02:25:05,962
Hey, I'll take offwork.

1899
02:25:06,038 --> 02:25:10,566
Let's have an adventure together--
you and me-- finally.

1900
02:25:10,643 --> 02:25:15,842
Anywhereyou wanna go,
anywhere in the world.

1901
02:25:17,083 --> 02:25:19,176
This is not my idea ofa good time.

1902
02:25:20,419 --> 02:25:22,785
-Just get me to my bed.
- I'll deal with her.

1903
02:26:07,233 --> 02:26:09,360
I forgiveyou.

1904
02:26:11,437 --> 02:26:13,371
I didn't apologize.

1905
02:26:40,032 --> 02:26:41,966
I am out ofhere.

1906
02:26:46,605 --> 02:26:49,540
- Hey, Sapphire.
- Hey, boy.

1907
02:26:51,410 --> 02:26:53,844
- I hate good-byes.
- Me too.

1908
02:26:55,848 --> 02:26:58,544
All right,
so I didn't likeyou much.

1909
02:26:58,617 --> 02:27:00,949
Do we have to
like each other?

1910
02:27:01,487 --> 02:27:03,717
I sorta thought so.

1911
02:27:04,957 --> 02:27:07,858
I think it would have
worked against us. I really do.

1912
02:27:08,794 --> 02:27:09,783
You know what they say.

1913
02:27:10,663 --> 02:27:13,359
All the great partnerships
hated each other.

1914
02:27:14,233 --> 02:27:16,360
We didn't hate each other
that much, did we?

1915
02:27:16,435 --> 02:27:20,303
No, maybe not.
I could work on it, though.

1916
02:27:27,346 --> 02:27:29,712
I just can't
pictureyou with Leslie.

1917
02:27:31,283 --> 02:27:35,515
I'm theyou they get
when they can't getyou.

1918
02:27:48,601 --> 02:27:51,229
- Sorry.
- I got it. It's cool.

1919
02:27:51,303 --> 02:27:53,294
- I'll seeyou later on.
- All right, seeya.

1920
02:27:53,372 --> 02:27:55,397
All right.

1921
02:28:05,084 --> 02:28:07,382
Is Penny okay?

1922
02:28:08,454 --> 02:28:13,255
The Quaaludes incident?
Well, it wasn't pretty.

1923
02:28:13,325 --> 02:28:16,351
She could've died.

1924
02:28:16,429 --> 02:28:20,798
You know, I always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her.

1925
02:28:20,866 --> 02:28:23,630
I guess I was wrong.
One ofthem ended up saving her life.

1926
02:28:26,539 --> 02:28:30,407
What doyou care? I mean,
we all know whatyou did to him.

1927
02:28:30,476 --> 02:28:33,741
I mean, everybody knows.

1928
02:28:33,813 --> 02:28:37,647
Even Penny Lane.

1929
02:28:43,189 --> 02:28:46,090
Something tells me
that 20 years from now...

1930
02:28:46,158 --> 02:28:51,653
we'll remember her...
and not much else.

1931
02:28:51,730 --> 02:28:53,129
Hey, Russell.

1932
02:28:59,371 --> 02:29:01,566
Can you believe these new girls?

1933
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:05,235
None ofthem use birth control,
and they eat all the steak.

1934
02:29:06,312 --> 02:29:10,715
I mean, they don't even know
what it is to be a fan.

1935
02:29:10,783 --> 02:29:16,688
You know, to truly love some silly
little piece ofmusic, or some band...

1936
02:29:16,755 --> 02:29:20,919
so much that it hurts.

1937
02:29:29,301 --> 02:29:31,667
It's Russell.
Don'thang up.

1938
02:29:31,737 --> 02:29:34,865
Ican'treally talk rightnow.
I'm inaroom fullofpeople.

1939
02:29:43,215 --> 02:29:44,842
Actually, I'm alone.

1940
02:29:47,786 --> 02:29:49,219
I won't call again, I promise.

1941
02:29:50,155 --> 02:29:52,851
ButIneedtoseeyouface to face...

1942
02:29:52,925 --> 02:29:57,191
because I'm neverasgood
as whenyou're there...

1943
02:29:57,263 --> 02:30:02,496
andIcanseemyself
the wayyoulookatme.

1944
02:30:02,568 --> 02:30:07,130
AndI'msorry. Ifwe couldjustget
togetherandfindsome time to talk.

1945
02:30:12,444 --> 02:30:14,605
Let's say all the things
we never said.

1946
02:30:18,817 --> 02:30:20,250
Givemeyouraddress.

1947
02:30:22,755 --> 02:30:25,223
I'm coming toyou...

1948
02:30:25,291 --> 02:30:28,089
this time.

1949
02:30:41,674 --> 02:30:43,107
Gotapen?

1950
02:31:17,710 --> 02:31:19,644
I'm Russell Hammond.

1951
02:31:21,046 --> 02:31:24,914
So this is the famous Russell Hammond.

1952
02:31:30,756 --> 02:31:32,690
Come in.

1953
02:31:37,963 --> 02:31:42,161
- Is she home?
- Who? Anita?

1954
02:31:50,009 --> 02:31:51,567
- Where am I?
- Hello?

1955
02:31:54,079 --> 02:31:57,571
You know, when we spoke,
I felt that we connected.

1956
02:32:20,873 --> 02:32:23,307
Oh, man.

1957
02:32:30,883 --> 02:32:33,545
My son is very important to me too...

1958
02:32:33,619 --> 02:32:36,315
and I do thinkyou owe him
an apology.

1959
02:32:37,222 --> 02:32:40,623
- I appreciateyou showing up.
- No, no, I agree...

1960
02:32:40,693 --> 02:32:42,285
ma'am.

1961
02:32:45,564 --> 02:32:49,591
There's hope foryou yet, Russell.

1962
02:33:03,782 --> 02:33:05,215
Well--

1963
02:33:13,459 --> 02:33:19,125
So this is...
where the Enemy sleeps.

1964
02:33:25,304 --> 02:33:29,001
You know, I thinkwe both wanted to--
to be with her.

1965
02:33:33,879 --> 02:33:36,313
And she wanted us to be together.

1966
02:33:51,597 --> 02:33:54,065
You should give her a call.

1967
02:33:54,133 --> 02:33:56,033
You both live in the same city.

1968
02:34:01,173 --> 02:34:03,664
- You really think I should?
- Yeah.

1969
02:34:06,645 --> 02:34:08,579
That girl really cares aboutyou.

1970
02:34:12,217 --> 02:34:14,242
Man, I never even knew her real name.

1971
02:34:21,293 --> 02:34:24,694
Oh, I called your magazine...

1972
02:34:24,763 --> 02:34:27,391
and told them the truth.

1973
02:34:29,234 --> 02:34:30,496
I don't know
what they're gonna do with it...

1974
02:34:30,569 --> 02:34:34,471
but I told them
everyword you wrote was true.

1975
02:34:40,712 --> 02:34:44,842
We are gonna do this one more time.

1976
02:34:56,762 --> 02:34:58,024
So, Russell...

1977
02:35:01,099 --> 02:35:03,533
what doyou love about music?

1978
02:35:13,779 --> 02:35:15,713
To begin with...

1979
02:35:17,149 --> 02:35:19,083
everything.

1980
02:35:26,625 --> 02:35:29,423
- Tickets!
- How much?

1981
02:35:45,410 --> 02:35:47,571
Morocco.
Seat by the window, please.
