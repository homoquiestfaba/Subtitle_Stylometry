509
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,180
I'm so happy. I hated singing
with Brian.

510
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,015
The best part was watching
Massey freak...

511
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:15,185
and then Mr. Moody kick him out
of chorus! So good!

512
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,121
Since when did my brother
get so many friends?

513
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,923
And who has the non-dairy,
chocolate, caramel latte?

514
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,326
That would be me, the lactose
intolerant one.

515
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,895
Can't drink milk, because
it goes through me...

516
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:28,031
like lava through a Philippine
village, just--

517
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,967
Just really thick. Would you
like to go out sometime?

518
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,871
No, thanks.

519
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:35,405
Is it because of the diarrhea?

520
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,478

right now.

00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:48,952
Brian, just go away.

00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,189
You no longer have the privilege
of speaking to me.

524
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:54,424

Relax, okay?

561
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:22,673
There's nothing wrong with him,
there's not a scratch on him.

562
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:24,274
He's looking good,
he's walking tall.

563
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,644

like that.

and he wins.

distances her...

it's a little annoying,

00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,456
Okay, Lonnie, I have to tell
you something.

651
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,593
But you gotta promise me that
you won't tell anyone. Promise?

00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:12,262
Yeah, not even Mom.
You sure? You talk a lot.

00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,433

and whatever I post on it...
comes true.

00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,608
I'm sorry, what? What?
It's insane.

00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,644

Okay, fine, if that was even
a possibility...

661
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,252
which I'm not saying that it is,
how would that even work?

662
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,488
I'll tell you, okay,
so my phone broke...

663
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,756
so I took it to the mall
to this bearded dude.

00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:40,991
Bearded dude?

665
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,559
He gave me a new phone
with this app...

666
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,827
called YOUniverse on it.

667
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,595
The universe is always

00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,298
There's this unicorn and if the
unicorn posts a tweet...

the tweet, does it make a sound?

Oh, man, you Californians, okay.

671
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,341
I'm not crazy. I'm telling you
the truth.

672
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,278
It does sound crazy, because
it's bullshit, all right?

673
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,879
Lonnie!

00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,648
Look, if anyone understands the
need for fantasy, it's me.

675
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,984
I mean, I spend more of my time
on Azeroth than I do on earth.

676
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,819
But I don't go around trying
to convince people...

677
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,521
that I'm Archmage Khadgar

<i> ¶ Tell me tell me do you
do you feel it too ¶</i>

You want to go to Vegas?

1691
01:42:35,884 --> 01:42:38,751
Uh, I should call my wife.

1692
01:42:38,753 --> 01:42:41,654
Yeah, your phone's broken.
