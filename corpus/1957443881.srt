- Tell me where my notes are.

531
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,021
- Bottom shelf. Basket.

532
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,265
- Ah, here's my little
jet-setter.

533
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,433
- Hi, mom.

534
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,270
- Ooh, are you sure
you're getting enough rest?

535
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,239
You know, we all need
eight hours of sleep,

536
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:29,573
including those
who just journey

537
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,975
across all those
different time zones.

538
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,309
- Yes, mother.

539
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:33,611
- Maybe you should think
about settling down.

540
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:34,545
That would be nice...
- Mother...

541
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,647
- I'm just...I'm glad

542
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,816
to have you home
for the holidays, you know,

543
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,051
especially after mama belle's
unexpected injury.

544
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,953
- I know.
- I am fine.

545
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,755
- Oh, you look fine.

546
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:45,790
- Baby.
- You look good.

547
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:48,125
- Yeah, it's just
a little thing.

548
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:49,627
- Oh, good.
Well, why don't we

549

all sit down,
you know, love, catch up.

550
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:54,398
I have a lot to tell you about.

551
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,666
I just came back
from New Orleans

552
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:58,402
with my very special friend.

553
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,304
- Um, actually,

554
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:03,107
I am about to go run
to a meeting for jamboree.

555
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,009
- The Christmas jamboree?

556
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,011
- Yes, Jazmin was kind enough

557
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,181
to step in while
I'm mildly incapacitated.

558
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,816
- Oh, so...So that means

559
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,484
you're gonna be around
for a little while.

560
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,021
- Yep, a whole week.
Plenty of time to catch up.

561
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,457
- Uh, did you call your dad?
- No, not recently.

562
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,524
Why? Isn't he out of town?

563
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,193
- He's back.

564
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,427
- All right,
when I get a minute.

565
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,795
Love you guys.

566
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,630
- Love you too, honey.
- Bye.

567
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,699
- Bye, bye.

568
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,301

583
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:11,976
- Okay, so let's go over
the schedule of events

584
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,644
for the remaining six days.

585
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,813
First, we have
the basketball snow jam,

586
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,081
then the bake-off,

587
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,183
then we have the art exhibit,

588
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,752
um, poetry slam, fashion bash,

589
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,487
and lastly,
the Christmas Eve dinner.

590
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,323
- Baby, we all know
the schedule.

591
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,925
- Right, we know the schedule.
- It's the same every year.

592
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:30,728
- But I'm here
to streamline the workload.

593
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,830
To implement changes as needed.

594
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,599
To improve and strengthen
for maximum effectiveness.

595
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:38,235
- Implement and strengthen it?
What's that supposed to mean?

596
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,670
- What's this?

597
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,673
- This is an org chart.
- What's that for?

598
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,375
- Well, if you just look at
the chart and find your name,

599
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,376
you'll see where you're needed.

600
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,610
- But I...I don't know

601
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,078
the first thing
about poetry slams.

602
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,280
- But you're in charge
of the fashion bash.

603
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,748
- I am.

604
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:51,949
- Which means you have
an eye for aesthetics.

605
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,384
- I do.

606
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,785
- So why not bring
that Je ne sais quoi

607
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:55,953
to the poetry slam?

608
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,421
- Ooh.
- I will not.

609
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,523
- Hmm.

Alvin, you are an athlete.

So Caleb and I
can use your help

613
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,098
for the snow jam,
and miss Arlene,

614
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:11,635
you are the life of the party,
so why not consider

615
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:14,138
using your efforts
in...In more than one event?

616
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:17,942
- The holiday bake-off
is my thing every year.

617
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,543
I know my way
around the kitchen.

618
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,412
- Yes, she does.
She...She does.

619
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,080
- Okay, then, so...So instead

620
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,815
of just cooking
at the bake-off,

621
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,717
why not provide snacks
and charcuterie

622
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,285
to all of the events?

623
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:31,322
Everybody loves a passed plate.

624
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,490
- Um, Jazmin, as co-chairs,

625
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,826
maybe you and I can have
a meeting in the boardroom.

626
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,762
Come on.

627
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,164
What are you doing?
- I'm team-building.

628
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,332
- The team's built,
and they have

629
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,633
a pretty clear idea
of what they want.

630
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,134
- Okay, but if they just look
at my chart,

631
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,669
they see that my way
is more efficient.

632
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,905
- They've been doing jamboree
for years, Jazmin,

633
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,506
and besides,
this group can get riled

634
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,108
about too much change
too quickly.

635
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,243
- Okay, then what
is my purpose here?

636
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,646
- Be supportive, help with
emergencies that come up,

637
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,015
and lend an extra hand
at each event.

638
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,483
I don't know.

639
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,685
Don't try to fix something
that isn't broken.

640
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:04,588
Hey, just trust me on this.

641
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,157
- Meeting adjourned.

642
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:15,299
- Okay, so I might have
overthought a few things.

643
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,601
So how about
we just table that chart

644
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:20,104
and you guys just keep doing
what you know how to do?

645
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,139
All: Mm-hmm.

646
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:26,944
- Hey, mama belle.

647
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,547
- Oh, jaz.

648
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:33,217
Hey, would you like
to help me with these?

649
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:34,852
- Ooh, yes.

for icing too.

651

Okay.

652
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,525
- All right. Uh-uh.

653
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,527
- Yes.

654
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,996
- So how was jamboree?

655
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:49,233
- Okay...for the most part.

656
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:55,806
Working with Caleb is fine.

657
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,709
I don't know,
there's just a lot

658
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,211
about the way things are
that I don't remember.

659

- Hmm.

Do me a favor.

661
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:09,019
Go over, look under the tree,
and grab the gold bag.

662
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,355
- The gold bag?

663
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,656
- The one and only.

You know...You know, I used
to think you fixed this.

667
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,033
- How do you mean?

668
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,501
- Like, you would give everyone

669
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,537
the person you think
they should have

670
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,405
so that you would think
about them

671
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:33,410
and appreciate them more
right when it mattered most.

672
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,412
Like when I picked mom
and her and I were fighting

673
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,348
about what college
I should go to.

674

really helped us
