0
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,148
I know my dad and I only
lived with them for four years

1
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,108
when I was little, but...

2
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,735
Katherine and Anja were like

3
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,738
the mother and sister
I never had.

4
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,032
Well, here is your copy.

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,242
Thank you for letting me
hold on to it.

6
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,079
I'm sorry I don't have more.
Just this one picture of them.

7
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,458
I guess I wasn't
really expecting anything.

8
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,209
Not with so little to go on.

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,670
Well, even for a...
an experienced genealogist,

10
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,297
it was a challenge.

11
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,924
And Tina, it may be
the only photo you have,

12
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,345
but it's... it's a good one.
A very good one.

13
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,430
And because you were
smart enough to keep it,

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,641
we were able to use it
to track down the woman

15
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,144
whose wedding you attended
when the photo was taken.

16
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,312
It turns out she and Katherine

17
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,773
have kept in touch
all these years.

18
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,778
Wait, are you saying that...

19
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,405
- Are you ready for us, Sophie?
- Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,449
Did you...

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,119
Tina?

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,748
Katherine?
Is that you?

23
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,294
Anja.

24
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,464
Well done, Soph.

25
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,468
<i>Soph! It's me!</i>

26
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,141
You said 9:00, and it's 9:30.

27
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,852
9:30? Come on,.

28
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,980
Oh!

29
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,400
- Hey, um, can we talk?
- Yeah.

30
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,695
Are you sure the
leukemia is back?

31
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,407
I mean, you've been in
remission for so long.

32
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,035
There's always a chance
it was gonna come back.

33
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,788
Soph, I know how
to do this, okay?

34
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,831
There's a few more tests to run,

35
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,291
but I already have
a treatment plan.

36
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,921
Okay, okay. Um, so...

37
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,631
Tell me, what's the first step?

38
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,966
Well, step one is you
put some liquor in that tea

39
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,135
and we marathon
<i>The Golden Girls</i> for five hours.

40
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,346
- Hey, I'm serious!
- So am I.

41
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,641
All right, well, answers first,
then hot toddies after.

42
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:50,896
Okay, so, I will eventually
need a bone marrow transplant.

43
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,981
We just have to find
a matching donor first.

44
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,566
Mom and Dad got tested today,

45
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,070
and Jackson's coming up
tomorrow to get tested too.

46
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,656
Stop eating my food
and give me a hug.

47
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,825
Come on.

48
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,577
- I love you.
- I love you too.

49
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,457
Okay, okay, okay.
One hot toddy, please.

50
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,002
Fine, but...

51
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,629
I am really happy for you
that Jackson's coming back.

52
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,297
It's just, it feels like ever
since he moved to Manhattan,

53
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,550
he just forgot we existed.

54
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,927
Well, he did come back for
your mom's funeral, at least.

55
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,804
I know he did,
but you know what I mean.

56
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,097
Yeah, well, I mean,

57
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,432
Manhattan is, like,
a train ride away.

58
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,475
You could just go
visit him like I do.

59
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,102
I have lots of
family trees to shake

60
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,812
and no one's
gonna shake 'em but me.

61
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,107
- Well, and Esme.
- Right.

62
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,651
- Have you told her yet?
- Not yet.

63
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,779
Okay. What about Alex?

64
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,574
Oh, yeah, I was going
to tell you, I swear,

65
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,784
but we broke up,
like, two weeks ago.

66
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,911
What!? John,
and you didn't tell me?

67
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,204
Well, because it's no big deal!

68
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,873
- I'm your be...
- I'm fine.

69
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,083
I mean, could you really
imagine that conversation?

70
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,252
Hey, Alex, I know we've
been dating for two months,

71
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,629
but surprise, my
leukemia's back.

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,423
I know, but I've told you
this time and time again,

73
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,716
you have to trust people.

74
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,426
Soph, I am here right now

75
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,136
'cause I wanted to
tell you what's going on,

76
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,597
not dissect my love life.

77
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,265
Okay?

78
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,226
- Okay.
- So...

79
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,936
How about that
<i>Golden Girls</i> marathon?

80
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,814
How can I possibly
say no to that?

81
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,318
- Thank you!
- Stop eating my food.

82
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,113
<i>Dr. Forest, dial 118, please.</i>

83
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,867
<i>Dr. Forest, please dial 1-1-8.</i>

84
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,081
Soph?

85
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,209
Jackson? Hey!

86
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,251
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,462
What are you doing here, hm?

88
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,214
Well, I was getting tested

89
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,257
to see if I could be a
bone marrow donor for Jonathan.

90
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,426
I mean, I know the chances
of a non-related match are low,

91
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,969
literally 1 in a million,

92
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,430
but I thought it was
worth a shot.

93
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,265
And I'm just the first.

94
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,767
Jonathan said I was
okay to share the news,

95
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,228
so Esme and a few others
are coming by later.

96
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,355
Actually, you're second.

97
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,274
I just did mine in
the other room there.

98
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,484
Hey, Winston!

99
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,695
Soph, Jackson.

100
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,987
Hey man, it's been a while.

101
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,155
I was about to head
to your office

102
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,657
when I ran into Sophie.

103
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,409
Well, this seems a good trip.

104
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,953
Hi.

105
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,788
I'm up.

106
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,248
I'll see you both later, I hope?

107
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,375
Yeah.

108
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,505
Ah, lot of people
really care about Jonathan.

109
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,842
Yeah. Yeah, he's really loved.

110
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,344
Yeah.

111
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,473
So, I read that siblings have,
like, a 25 percent chance

112
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,100
of being a match?

113
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,811
I mean, not that I'm the expert.
You're the doctor.

114
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,771
ER doctor, not an oncologist.

115
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,441
But yeah, Mom and I
are the most likely.

116
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,360
I have a 1 in 4 chance.
Parental match is a longer shot,

117
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,488
but significantly more likely
than a random donor match.

118
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,824
But between you and me, Mom's
pretty much convinced herself

119
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,451
it's gonna be me.

120
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,994
What about George?

121
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,662
I mean, I know he's
not your bio dad, but...

122
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,539
He thinks he'll be a match,

123
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,250
although it's
extremely unlikely.

124
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,128
You know him, though...
Soft belly, big heart.

125
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,798
- You'll keep me in the loop?
- Of course.

126
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,176
Hey, we didn't, uh, get
much of a chance to talk

127
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,595
at your mom's funeral.

128
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,015
I just, I wanted to say
again how sorry I am.

129
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,893
She was like a second
mother to us growing up.

130
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,728
I still can't
believe she's gone.

131
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,272
- Thanks, Jackson.
- Yeah.

132
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,985
- I should get back to work.
- Yeah, okay.

133
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,946
Um, this is my stop.

134
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,574
- I'll see you around, Sophie.
- Yeah.

135
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,214
Dorothy?

136
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,299
Hey, what are you doing here?
I just came from the hospital.

137
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,386
Hi, Sophie.
Um... can we talk?

138
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,847
Yeah.
Is everything okay?

139
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,600
- Let me buy you a coffee.
- Okay.

140
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,395
<i>Jonathan told
you about the relapse?</i>

141
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,938
<i>I can't even imagine how hard</i>

142
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,608
<i>this must be for you,
but they're gonna find a match.</i>

143
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,653
<i>That's why I
wanted to talk to you.</i>

144
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,948
If Jackson and I
aren't a donor match,

145
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,533
the doctor has suggested that

146
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,619
another member of the
immediate family might be.

147
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,622
And that's where
you can help me.

148
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,124
I'm not following.

149
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,459
I wanna hire your company

150
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,713
to find the boys'
biological father,

151
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,132
- Clark Higgins.
- I...

152
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,176
I thought he died
before the boys were born.

153
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,470
The State of New York
declared him dead

154
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,097
three years after
his disappearance,

155
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,474
but they never found a body.

156
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,020
Just his car after
it went off the bridge.

157
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:46,233
Um... that's us
the day we tied the knot.

158
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,527
Behind us, you can see
Clark's sister, Jessie,

159
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,529
and his best friend, Bill.

160
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,406
Nine years after
the disappearance

161
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:56,160
and a month before
I got this postcard,

162
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:01,457
my friend Anna swore
she saw Clark in Boston.

163
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,917
I hired a private investigator
to try and find him,

164
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,336
but no luck.

165
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,879
Postmarked Bradford, Massachusetts.

166
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,714
I think that's near Boston.

167
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,341
Did Clark have
any ties to the area?

168
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,301
Not to my knowledge.

169
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,928
What about any other family
members besides his sister?

170
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,764
Just Jessie.

171
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,974
I think she got married and
moved away, but I'm not sure.

172
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,143
And the private investigator
that you hired...

173
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,395
Couldn't find a thing, but...

174
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,398
I've seen how good
you are, Sophie.

175
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,359
And you know what
my boys mean to me.

176
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,236
I need your help.

177
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,988
Please.

178
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,199
I'll pay you whatever you ask.

179
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,409
No, Dorothy,
I can't take your money.

180
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,328
Oh Sophie, you have to. I...

181
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,831
Of course I will take the case,
but I can't take your money.

182
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,667
I mean, you guys are...

183
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,461
You guys are family.

184
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,089
Thank you.

185
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,760
Uh, there's just one
other little small thing.

186
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,180
I haven't told the boys
about any of this, so...

187
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,015
you'll need to be discreet.

188
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,102
Dorothy, I can't
lie to my friends.

189
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,812
I'm happy to take the case,

190
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,606
but you have to be straight
with Jonathan and Jackson.

191
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,653
And besides, they
deserve to know.

192
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,612
Okay.

193
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,490
Okay.

194
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,617
I'll call them as
soon as I leave here

195
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,327
and tell them everything.

196
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,413
- Then we're good.
- Thank you, Sophie.

197
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,791
I know if anyone can
find Clark, it's you.

198
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,448
Earth to Sophie!
Hi.

199
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,074
I got your favorite farro
and beat salad from Le Chef.

200
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,243
Ooh, sorry, my mind
was on something else.

201
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,328
We... we have a new case.

202
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,205
Oh, you saw the email
about the love letters client.

203
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,957
I was gonna give her
a call later about the job,

204
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,375
but glad you got
a head start on it.

205
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,336
No, actually,
we have a new case,

206
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,838
one that hits
kind of close to home.

207
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,841
Dorothy just hired us
to find Jonathan and Jackson's

208
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,303
biological father to see
if he is a bone marrow match.

209
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,723
Uh, that's new to me.
How do you match a dead guy?

210
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,225
Well, it turns out
maybe not so dead.

211
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,685
Nine years after
his disappearance,

212
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,522
there was a sighting.
And then there's this.

213
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,734
- Whoa, he sent this?
- Possibly.

214
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,612
It's been handled
too much for fingerprints.

215
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,156
Uh, can you pull
the death certificate for me?

216
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,033
His name is
Clark Edward Higgins.

217
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,827
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

218
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,920
Death by drowning, and they
never recovered the body, right?

219
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,588
Right.

220
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,882
I had Dorothy
walk me through it.

221
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,717
Clark's car went off
the Buffalo Skyway

222
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,302
sometime during the night.

223
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,887
The reason the car went
off the bridge is unknown

224
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,847
and a body was never recovered.

225
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,600
Okay, so... what's our next move?

226
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,851
I'm gonna try to find

227
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,895
Clark's best friend,
Bill Reynolds.

228
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,689
I need to get a DNA
sample from Jonathan

229
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,899
and enter it into
the DNA databases.

230
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,527
Maybe we can lock
into a paternal match.

231
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,947
There's also an aunt,
uh, Clark's sister, Jessie.

232
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,157
Okay, well, we can search
for her the old-fashioned way...

233
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,660
Social media,
ancestry websites, et cetera.

234
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,704
Assuming she's still
using her maiden name.

235
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,039
Right.

236
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,211
So... I'm gonna be
kind of slammed with this.

237
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,629
How do you feel about taking on

238
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,841
the love letter
case by yourself?

239
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,259
- You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.

240
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,927
- I got my own case?
- Yeah, I think it's time.

241
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,721
You've been working
with me for, what?

242
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,681
- Six months.
- I think you're ready.

243
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:50,352
Wow, from art teacher
to genealogical detective.

244
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,187
Oh, I'm ready.

245
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,314
And I'm gonna go talk to the
love letters lady right now.

246
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,317
Great. You'll like it.

247
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,611
Wait, you forgot your lunch!

248
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,408
<i>So, Alicia, why
don't you tell me about</i>

249
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,493
<i>how you found these letters?</i>

250
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:11,081
I wanted a fixer because
I'm all about DIY.

251
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:14,376
You renovated
this place yourself?

252
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,753
I started with the
kitchen first because I knew

253
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,796
it was gonna take the most work.

254
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,174
But when I ripped out
the floorboards here,

255
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,345
I noticed one of
these boards was loose.

256
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,977
This was hidden under it.

257
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,481
There are no last
names or addresses.

258
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,776
No envelopes.
Just the letters.

259
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,362
"My darling Charlie,

260
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,530
"If only I could hold you,

261
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,493
"feel the warmth of
your arms around me.

262
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,579
I know fate has kept us
apart, but one day..."

263
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,123
"we'll find our way
back to each other."

264
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,626
"With love, R."

265
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,878
- So romantic, right?
- Well, just so you know,

266
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,047
these letters may be
older than we realize.

267
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,883
I can't guarantee that the
people involved are still alive.

268
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:06,011
If they are, I promise that we
will do everything in our power

269
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,138
to return them to
their rightful owner.

270
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,057
Thank you, Esme.

00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,824
Hey!

276
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,034
Sorry.

277
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,995
- Sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay.

278
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,039
I could use a break.

279
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,290
Want to come to the
record store with me

280
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,292
for some retail therapy?

281
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,169
Ooh, yes, that sounds great.

282
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,798
But first I just need
a quick DNA sample from you.

283
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,301
Excuse me? Why?

284
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,971
Well, I need the sample
so I can upload it

285
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,599
to some online
genetic databases.

286
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,102
Look, I know those
are words you're saying,

287
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:59,023
but I'm completely
in the dark here.

288
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,941
Your mom didn't
call you, did she?

289
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,943
- She was supposed to tell you...
- Tell me what?

290
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,696
That you're coming over
with a very large Q-Tip.

291
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,573
I have no idea if she called.

292
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,366
I've been listening to
music the whole time.

293
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,285
Um, your mom wanted me
to do a job for her,

294
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,370
but it's not a big deal
and I can just come back

295
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,706
- after you guys talk.
- Sophie.

296
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,499
What job?

297
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,126
Hey, guys.

298
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,422
I got chocolate glazed,
coconut cream, sprinkled,

299
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,632
old fashioned glazed...
Oh, and cinnamon sugar.

300
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,178
I wasn't sure what you'd like,
but I thought a little sugar

301
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,181
might be a little
morale booster.

302
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,351
What's with the gloves?
Did I interrupt something?

303
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,728
No, not that all.

304
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,981
Sophie here was just collecting
a DNA sample for Mom.

305
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,317
But she won't tell me why.

306
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,613
A DNA sample, huh?
Why would you need that?

307
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,156
Mm, your mom
didn't call you either.

308
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,241
No.

309
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,035
Um...

310
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,995
It's not a big deal.

311
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,538
Uh, I'm just gonna
come back later,

312
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,082
after you guys talk to her, so...

313
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,667
- Soph?
- What?

314
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,919
- You're doing the thing.
- I didn't do the thing.

315
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,379
Yeah, you're doing the thing.

316
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,546
Any time you're not
being straight with me,

317
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,549
you do the thing.

318
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,885
I can't.

319
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,553
You can't what, Sophie?

320
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,598
Tell us.

321
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,477
Okay, um...

322
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,439
Your Mom hired me to
find your biological father.

323
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,191
She thinks he might
still be alive

324
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,195
and that he might be a
bone marrow match for Jonathan.

325
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,288
And why are you
just telling us now?

326
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,999
We didn't have any proof.

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,959
That's why I hired a
private investigator

328
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,544
all those years ago.

329
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,421
I didn't wanna say something
to you and be wrong.

330
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,131
Your mother
and I talked about it

331
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,342
after her friend Anna thought
she saw Clark in Boston, but...

332
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,095
But what?

333
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,596
You should've told us.

334
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,183
It was our right to know.
He was our father.

335
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,893
I don't understand how you
can just be standing there

336
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,645
acting like this
isn't a huge deal.

337
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,439
It is a huge deal,
but we need to focus on

338
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,232
what matters right now.

339
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,234
Jonathan, you're right.

340
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,194
We made a mistake.

341
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,865
And I am so sorry for
not sharing this with you.

342
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,617
Mom, we know
this was hard for you,

343
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,578
that you were just doing
what you thought was right.

344
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,163
- We do?
- Look, I'm just trying to

345
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,081
see things from
her point of view.

346
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,375
We were just trying
to protect you both.

347
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,336
- And this is how you protect us?
- Yeah.

348
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,297
By lying to us, and then
hiring Sophie behind our backs

349
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,967
to find the guy who
dumped us and took off?

350
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,094
Your biological dad
could be a bone marrow match.

351
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,930
- We have to at least try.
- Jackson is gonna be the match.

352
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,891
So I don't understand why
we're having this conversation.

353
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,768
Jonathan, please.

354
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,104
Okay, say you find him.
Let's say he's a match.

355
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,357
How do you know
he's gonna go through with it?

356
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,692
He wasn't there
for us growing up.

357
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,027
So why would he be
there for me now?

358
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,612
It's worth a shot.

359
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,863
I wanna do whatever
it takes to keep you alive.

360
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,573
Yeah, we all do.

361
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,742
If you wanna waste
your time looking for a man

362
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:01,456
who abandoned us,
abandoned Mom, go ahead.

363
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,668
Even if he is alive,

364
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,047
he has done a real good job of
hiding himself our entire lives.

365
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,635
Good luck finding him.

366
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,442
Jonathan has a right
to be upset with us.

367
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,403
You know, if my parents
hadn't told me I was adopted

368
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:35,489
when I was seven and instead
sprung it on me as an adult,

369
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,825
I'd be hurt.

370
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,077
How are you doing about it all?

371
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,705
I don't know.

372
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,456
It's kind of weird
to think about

373
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,293
Clark being alive
out there somewhere.

374
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,962
Living a whole other life.

375
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,007
Maybe even having a
whole other family.

376
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,968
I think that's one of the
reasons why I became a doctor.

377
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,262
I get that.
You couldn't help your dad,

378
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,265
but you could help other people.

379
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:05,394
Yep, pop psychology for the win.

380
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,104
You know, for what it's worth,

381
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,106
I've always admired the way
you've followed your heart.

382
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,232
You're doing
what's important to you.

383
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,359
You're helping people.

384
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,944
And all the while
living in one of

385
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,405
the most amazing
cities in the world.

386
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,366
Well, you didn't have to
stay back here in Buffalo.

387
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,203
I-I couldn't leave my mom.

388
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,914
And it was a joy to be there
for here when she needed me.

389
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,208
I wouldn't change
it for the world.

390
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,294
You know, we never talked
about any of this stuff before.

391
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,546
Mm, you never asked.

392
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,383
Yeah, well, that's my bad.
I should've.

393
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,137
Ah,

394
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,014
I didn't have lunch,

395
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,141
and since we're standing
in front of Big Tony's...

396
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,434
I've got first dibs on pinball.

397
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,437
Oh, you...

398
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,652
Did you and Jonathan
ever spend time with

399
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,613
your aunt Jessie?

400
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,656
I don't think we ever met her.

401
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,992
I was just wondering if
maybe Clark reached out to her,

402
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,161
if maybe she knows where he is.

403
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,788
Assuming he did fake
his own death,

404
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,623
he would need some help, right?

405
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,333
I just wanna know why he did it.

406
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,377
Why fake his own death?

407
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,629
No money, no job,
no place to live.

408
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,130
What's he running away from?

409
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,343
Finding out the answer
to that could mean a lot.

410
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,472
We should talk to
Anna ourselves.

411
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,725
- We?
- She knows me.

412
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,019
Maybe I'll be able to get her
to open up, talk more openly.

413
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,437
Oh, I like this.

414
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,773
Jackson Ford is
my Watson extraordinaire.

415
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,818
Ah, ah, ah, it's
Dr. Watson Extraordinaire.

416
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,278
Right.

417
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,201
Hi! Anna Malone?

418
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,662
Yes. Can I help you?

419
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,164
- Hi, Anna.
- Oh, Jackson.

420
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,666
This is my friend,
Sophie McClaren.

421
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,917
She's Harry's daughter.

422
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,210
We were hoping to
ask you about something.

423
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,754
Sure, come in.

424
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,924
<i>So what did you
wanna talk about?</i>

425
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,802
Clark Higgins,
my biological father.

426
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:06,015
My mother said that you
thought you saw him in Boston.

427
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,641
If she already told you...

428
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,560
It's really better to get
the information from the source.

429
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,812
That's a long time ago.
I don't really remember much.

430
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,397
Can you tell us
what you do remember?

431
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,940
I'm not even sure it was him.

432
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,692
Like I said,
it was a long time ago.

433
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,278
And even back then,
I almost didn't tell your mom,

434
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,989
because if I was wrong,
then it would only hurt her.

435
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,324
But something compelled
you to tell her.

436
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,909
What was it?

437
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,413
I just thought if it
were me, I'd wanna know.

438
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,043
I was in Boston for
my niece's wedding,

439
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,837
at the rehearsal dinner.

440
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,548
I just remember looking out
the window of the restaurant,

441
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,301
and there he was, walking by.

442
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,345
So I ran outside,
called his name.

443
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,138
No response.

444
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,182
Watched him hop
into a car and leave.

445
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,975
I know this was
a really long time ago,

446
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,061
but is there anything
else you can remember?

447
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,272
Maybe the car?

448
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,107
Wait a minute,

449
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,609
The car.

450
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,194
Uh, it was one of
those boxy Volvos.

451
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:04,823
It was gray or... blue.

452
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,367
Powder blue.

453
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:09,995
Okay, a powder blue Volvo.
That's something.

454
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,705
Is there anything
else you can remember?

455
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,999
I...

456
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,793
No, no.

457
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:19,129
Anna, if you saw something,
we really need to know.

458
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,548
Please.
Jonathan has had a relapse

459
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,676
and he needs a bone
marrow transplant.

460
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,345
If I'm not a match,
Clark might be.

461
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,889
We need to find
him just in case.

462
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,560
There was a woman
holding on to his arm.

463
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,688
It was very intimate.

464
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:39,274
I didn't see her face,
but she had long red hair.

465
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,653
I felt terrible for Dorothy.

466
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:46,115
If it was Clark,
then he wasn't dead.

467
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,034
He left her for another woman.

468
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,250
I'm so sorry, Jackson.

469
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,294
Yeah, well, it's
better than no truth.

470
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,171
Well, at least now we really
do have reason to believe

471
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,007
that Clark was alive back then,

472
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,176
and that maybe he had
a powder blue Volvo.

473
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,095
Doesn't seem like much to go on.

474
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,431
I mean, I guess we know
he had bad taste in cars.

475
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,224
Hey, believe me,

476
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,601
I have found people
using far less.

477
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,479
Look, I wanna help,
so what can I do?

478
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,356
Actually, there is one thing.

479
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,025
But I promised my dad I'd
have dinner with him tonight,

480
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,609
so if you don't mind...

481
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,861
I'd be happy to swing
by Harry's house.

482
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:24,863
Okay.

483
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,075
All right, that's it!
That wasn't so bad, was it?

484
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,994
Thank you.

485
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,328
I just didn't wanna bother
Jonathan with this, you know?

486
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,456
Mm-hmm.

487
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,499
Now what?

488
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,711
Now I send your genetic profile
into online ancestry databases,

489
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,130
see if we get any matches.

490
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,883
Maybe Clark had other
kids or distant relatives

491
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,052
who may know his whereabouts.

492
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,636
And in the meantime?

493
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,555
In the meantime, I use
other tools at my disposal

494
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:54,808
and focus on the Boston area.

495
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,770
Do you really think
you can find him?

496
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,231
If he's alive,
I think I can find him.

497
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,650
I just hope I can do in time.

498
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:04,902
I'm also on the hunt for

499
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,779
Clark's best friend,
Bill Reynolds.

500
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,322
Your mom said he was
a witness at their wedding.

501
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:10,032
He and Clark taught at
the same school,

502
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,826
but your mom and him lost touch.

503
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,621
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, Dad!

504
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,582
- Look who came to say hi.
- Harry! Good to see you.

505
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,543
Jackson, my favorite Ford kid.

506
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,128
Dad! You know what?

507
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,630
Don't listen to
anything this man says

508
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,298
because he tells
Jonathan the same thing

509
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,841
every time he comes over.

510
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,511
Don't give your
old man's secret away, kiddo.

511
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:33,514
Harry, you? Old? No way.

512
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,057
Hm? You see why
he's my favorite?

513
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,600
Yeah.

514
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,227
Sophie told
me what was going on.

515
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,062
I'm glad you're here.

516
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,397
Jonathan and your parents
need all the support

517
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,815
they can get right now.

518
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:46,443
- I'll do my best, sir.
- I know.

519
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,862
Stay for dinner, hm?
I'm making chicken a la Harry.

520
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,239
There's more than enough
for three.

521
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,657
Oof, as good as that sounds,

522
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,827
I better get back
to my parents' house.

523
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,537
Jonathan's coming by
for dinner tonight,

524
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,664
and I was told to be
home at 7:00 sharp.

525
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,582
- I'll walk you out.
- Well, maybe next time.

526
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,127
Just you and me, kiddo.

527
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,837
Don't be a stranger, huh?

528
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,638
- Good to see you again, Harry.
- Same to you.

529
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,511
Thanks for letting
me tag along today.

530
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,096
- Yeah.
- I need to be doing something

531
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,098
or I'm gonna go stir crazy.

532
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,852
Yeah, same old Jackson,
can't abide boredom.

533
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,603
Don't know too many guys
who were football captain

534
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:24,148
and salutatorian of their class.

535
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,733
And that would've
been valedictorian

536
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,526
if there wasn't
some brainiac girl

537
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,570
who remembered
everything in my class.

538
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:33,115
Oops.

539
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,117
Okay, um, so I'll
call you tomorrow

540
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,161
and we'll make a plan?

541
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:38,287
- Great.
- Okay.

542
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,081
- Good night.
- Night.

543
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,046
- Mmmm!
- Mm-hmm!

544
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,382
- That smells good, Dad.
- Mm-hmm.

545
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,807
What?

546
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,018
Oh, nothin'.

547
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,312
Dad, Jackson's just a friend.

548
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,689
Sometimes friends

549
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,816
can become more than friends, huh?

550
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,444
Your mother and I were
friends once upon a time.

551
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:13,448
Okay, okay, I'm not 15 anymore.
No dating advice.

552
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,409
Hey, I wanted to ask
you something, though, Dad.

553
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,954
Um... you and Mom
were friends with Dorothy

554
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,290
when she was married
to Clark Higgins, right?

555
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,833
Well, your mother
and Dorothy were friends.

556
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,126
I mean, uh, we, uh...

557
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,795
We double dated
a couple of times,

558
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,631
caught a ball game
or two, but that's it.

559
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,300
Why?

560
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:38,472
Well, we have reason to believe
that Clark may still be alive.

561
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:39,640
- Wow.
- Yeah.

562
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,266
- All this time?
- Yeah.

563
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,434
It seems Dorothy knew about it,

564
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,270
but Jackson and
Jonathan didn't know.

565
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,190
Well, now that you mention it...

566
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,025
What?

567
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:53,654
Do you know something
about Clark's disappearance?

568
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,364
George and I took
in a Bills game once.

569
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,075
I think you and the kids
were maybe 9 or 10.

570
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:01,036
And I remember he was
really stressed and nervous.

571
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,496
Not George-like at all.

572
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,164
What was he nervous about?

573
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,833
When I asked him,
he said that there was something

574
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,210
that was gonna make
Dorothy leave him.

575
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:12,881
No, not something. Someone.

576
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:17,344
I offered to help, and he
said he'd taken care of it.

577
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:20,139
I guess he did, because he
never spoke about it again.

578
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,849
- Are you sure about when?
- Definitely.

579
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,976
'96 playoffs. Why?

580
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,022
That was right after
Clark was seen in Boston.

581
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,406
<i>Hi George, it's Sophie.</i>

582
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,199
I've left you a few messages.

583
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,827
Um, if you could call me
back, it's very important.

584
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,080
Thanks.

585
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,167
Just had a great meeting with
the love letters client, Alicia.

586
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,501
- Great.
- So I already started

587
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,503
working on chain of ownership
for the house,

588
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,422
but I learned it
was built in 1954,

589
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,965
and the kitchen where Alicia

590
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:57,301
originally discovered
the letters was an addition,

591
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,303
so it wasn't built until 1981.

592
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,221
Great work!
That should narrow it down some.

593
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,931
I'm excited!

594
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,972
So how goes the hunt for
Jonathan and Jackson's dad?

595
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,731
- Well...
- No.

596
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,566
Whatever this is,
I want no part of it.

597
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,193
Well, you don't even
know what I'm gonna ask you.

598
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,819
I don't need to.
I can see from the look

599
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,071
on your face
I'm not gonna like it.

600
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,781
How about this?

601
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:23,118
Dinner on me at the new
French restaurant downtown

602
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,706
if you'll swing by the
hospital and ask Winston

603
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,541
to put a rush on
the DNA profile?

604
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,086
I knew it.
Sophie, he's so cute,

605
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,629
but he can't even
look me in the eye.

606
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,214
It is beyond awkward.

607
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,935
Like, he takes it to
a whole new level, I...

608
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,635
Can we just do it
through the proper channels?

609
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,554
No, because it will take weeks,
and if you ask Winston,

610
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:46,558
I'm pretty sure we'll get
the raw DNA profile in days.

611
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,477
This is a much bigger
ask than steak frites

612
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,270
and chocolate mousse.

613
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,773
Oh, did I mention a bottle
of their best wine to share?

614
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,192
Huh? Plus, you'd
be doing it for Jonathan.

615
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:56,985
Okay, well, that's not fair
because now I can't say no.

616
00:28:56,986 --> 00:29:00,155
I know.

617
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,449
I might as well get it done now.

618
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,744
But you do know that Winston is
never gonna ask me out, right?

619
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,371
No matter how many times
you try to throw us together,

620
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:10,082
it's just, it's hopeless.

621
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,542
Who, me? Never say never!

622
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:12,711
Mm-hmm.

623
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,368
Hi, I'm trying to
reach Bill Reynolds.

624
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:50,247
He owns aircraft N-N-7-4-1-P.

625
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:54,418
And he just won our drawing
for a year's supply of, uh,

626
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,880
airplane polish.

627
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,214
I know, you never think people

628
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,008
actually win
those things, right?

629
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,720
Yes, yes, a phone number
would be great.

630
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,600
Hi, is this Bill Reynolds?

631
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,226
Yes, my name is Sophie McClaren.

632
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,436
I'm a forensic genealogist,

633
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:16,106
and I'm looking for
Clark Higgins.

634
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:17,649
Uh, I understand that,
but I would actually

635
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,410
still love to talk to you.
It's very import...

636
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,534
Esme.

637
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:31,246
To what do I owe this
unexpected pleasure?

638
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,248
- Well...
- Wait, don't tell me.

639
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,292
Let me guess.

640
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,878
Is that a sample you'd
like me to genotype for you?

641
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:41,215
If you have the time and
it's not too much trouble.

642
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,800
I'll put a rush on it.

643
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,387
That's great.
Thank you, Winston.

644
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,972
Well, I guess
I should get going.

645
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,059
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure
you're very beautiful.

646
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,812
Busy. Busy.

647
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:56,605
Beautifully busy.
You are beautiful.

648
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,273
Yeah.

649
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,025
All right, well,
uh, I just, um...

650
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,027
I guess give the office
a call when it's done.

651
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,072
Yeah, uh...

652
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,240
Thank you.

653
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,118
Uh, no, thank you.

654
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,706
No, thank you.

655
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,418
Bye, Winston.

656
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,548
No, thank you?

657
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,426
Come on, Winston,
use your words.

658
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,059
I know I said I'd call,
but I was in the neighborhood.

659
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,603
Actually, I was gonna call you.

660
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,063
I found Clark's friend,
Bill Reynolds,

661
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,523
and I was gonna head
to the airfield now.

662
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:40,566
Sounds great. I'll drive.

663
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,818
Thanks.

664
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,862
So chivalrous.

665
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,321
If the guys you're dating
aren't opening doors for you,

666
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:47,489
you're dating the wrong guys.

667
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,770
I'll take that under advisement.

668
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:57,916
So, are you dating anyone?

669
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,668
It's been a while
since we've talked.

670
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,420
Ah, you sound like
Esme and my dad.

671
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,838
How so?

672
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,923
Well, Esme says I'm too picky.

673
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:08,177
But I'm sorry, a guy wearing
squared-toed dress shoes?

674
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,929
That is a deal-breaker to me.

675
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,514
Good to know
that women don't like men

676
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:14,475
in square-toed dress shoes.

677
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,894
I'm mentally going through
my closet right now.

678
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,937
I think I'm good.

679
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,023
And my dad,
he just wants me happy,

680
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,400
but that means finding
somebody I actually like.

681
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:26,612
And since dating now consists
of swiping left and right,

682
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,572
finding a good match
seems impossible.

683
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:30,366
How about you?

684
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,409
I guess everyone just swipes
left when they get to me.

685
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,036
Stop.

686
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,412
No, I've had
a few serious relationships.

687
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,206
But no one's ever
lived up to my first love.

688
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,375
She set the bar pretty high.

689
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,876
Okay, well, whoever she is,

690
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,212
I'm sure she's ruing the
day she let you get away.

691
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,215
Yeah, I don't think she is.

692
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,607
Okay, so we're looking
for Bill Reynolds

693
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,443
in a gold-striped Cessna.

694
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:17,706
Hello? Anyone here?

695
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:37,975
N-N-7-2-4-1-P.

696
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,477
Mr. Reynolds?

697
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:43,981
Look, you can't be in here.

698
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,316
There's a lot of
sensitive equipment.

699
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:48,777
- Mr. Reynolds?
- Yeah.

700
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:50,362
Uh, we were just looking for...

701
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,948
Wait, you're the girl on
the phone asking about Clark.

702
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,658
Yeah, did you know him?

703
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:55,744
I told you...

704
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,207
Oh my goodness.
You look just like your father.

705
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,502
- Uh, I wouldn't know.
- Of course not.

706
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:07,796
He died before you were born.

707
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,548
Look, Mr. Reynolds,

708
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,342
I know you said you
didn't wanna talk to me...

709
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:12,926
So you thought
you'd come down here

710
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:14,595
and maybe I'd
just change my mind.

711
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:16,805
Yes, I was hoping.

712
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,349
I just thought if we could
explain the situation...

713
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,767
I already told you on the phone,

714
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:22,227
I'm not interested
in dredging up the past.

715
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:25,439
Now, I have work to do.

716
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,941
Look, my brother's
life is on the line,

717
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:30,022
and I think my father
would've wanted you to help us.

718
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,490
Please?

719
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:37,201
For your best friend?

720
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:40,704
Like I said,
I have work to do, so...

721
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:43,917
if you wanna talk,
you gotta work.

722
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,846
We have reason to believe
that Clark may still be alive.

723
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,307
That he may have possibly
faked his own death.

724
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:02,142
I don't believe
that for a second.

725
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,644
Bill, you knew him best.

726
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:06,522
Maybe you could tell us
a little bit about him?

727
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:10,359
Clark was a good guy.
Always had your back.

728
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,444
A champion dart player.

729
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:16,198
Legendary at the Iron
Hound, our local pub.

730
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,867
He loved your mother, he...

731
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:23,163
He never would've done something
like faking his own death.

732
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,290
Even if he'd gotten involved
with another woman?

733
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:29,253
Didn't happen.
Clark was a responsible type.

734
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:32,715
There's no way he woulda
left her in a lurch like that.

735
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:36,176
No, not unless...

736
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,721
he had a very good reason.

737
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:42,266
Was there a reason?

738
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,851
He was upset that night, sure.

739
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:47,813
But not enough to
do what you're saying.

740
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,357
Why was he upset?

741
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,444
Clark called me that night.

742
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:56,030
Asked me to meet him
at the Iron Hound Pub.

743
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:57,948
It was raining, it was
a real mess out, but...

744
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:00,117
Clark sounded bad, so I went.

745
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:02,536
And he and your mom
had had a fight.

746
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:04,496
It was bad.

747
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:06,540
- Was the marriage in trouble?
- I don't know.

748
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:09,209
They were newlyweds.
They had plans, and

749
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,837
getting unexpectedly
pregnant with twins?

750
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,882
That wasn't one of them, so...
it freaked Clark out.

751
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:18,594
Well, lots of people get
nervous about having kids.

752
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,679
You need to understand.

753
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,098
Your grandparents?
They were alcoholics.

754
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,560
Not nice ones.
After they passed,

755
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,937
Clark was left with
his younger sister, Jessie,

756
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:32,232
to raise by himself, and
she had emotional problems.

757
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,902
She was in and out of school
with trouble all the time.

758
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,613
Clark did his best,
but I think he felt like

759
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,156
he really failed her.

760
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:42,368
And now here he is,
two babies on the way,

761
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:45,204
two kids he was
afraid he might fail.

762
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:48,791
So you think if he ran,
maybe that was why?

763
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:52,504
If he ran?
Yeah, could be.

764
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:05,015
- Thank you very much.
- Hi, George!

765
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:07,768
Sophie, uh, what
are you doing here?

766
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,104
Well, I left you a few messages,
but I know how busy you get,

767
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,480
so I thought
I'd just swing by your office.

768
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:12,773
Yeah, I've been really busy.

769
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:13,941
In fact, I have a
meeting right now.

770
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:17,194
So, sorry.

771
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:20,197
Okay, well, this will
just take a second.

772
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:23,242
How about I do the talking
and you tell me if I'm close?

773
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:26,286
I think that Clark came
back maybe a year or two

774
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,664
after you and
Dorothy got married,

775
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:30,708
and I think that instead of
finding Dorothy and the kids,

776
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,167
he found you.

777
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,460
And I think you know that

778
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:34,753
he's been alive this
entire time.

779
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,714
Sophie!

780
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,632
I have nothing to do with Clark.

781
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:40,260
Do you understand me?

782
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,637
Okay, listen, if he's out there,

783
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,639
I'm sure you will do
your best to find him.

784
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,142
But I can't help you.

785
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:55,983
Esme, what's up?

786
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,443
<i>I may have a
lead on Clark's sister.</i>

787
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:58,736
I found the guy
she was married to.

788
00:37:58,737 --> 00:37:59,612
<i>How?</i>

789
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,530
Marriage records?

790
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:02,573
<i>Divorce records.
I'm sending you his address now.</i>

791
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:03,616
Great.

792
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:12,624
Look at the two of you.
Boy, did I have my hands full.

793
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,044
Yeah.

794
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:18,047
Um, Sophie and I, we, uh...

795
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:20,049
We talked to
Bill Reynolds today.

796
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,925
- You found Bill?
- Mm-hmm.

797
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:24,720
You know, I always felt bad
about losing touch with him.

798
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:26,180
Between you and me,

799
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:27,765
I think he blamed
himself for Clark's death,

800
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,893
sending him out driving
into the middle of a rainstorm,

801
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:33,228
which is absurd.

802
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:36,732
If anyone's to blame...

803
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,360
it's me.

804
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:42,654
Why? Because of
the fight you two had?

805
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,699
- He told you about that?
- He did, yeah.

806
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:52,624
The night that, uh, he died,

807
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,710
I was angry.

808
00:38:57,337 --> 00:39:00,798
We... had a big fight,
and I said some harsh words.

809
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,383
I even threatened to leave him

810
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:03,842
if he didn't get his act together,

811
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:07,513
- but I didn't mean it.
- It's not your fault.

812
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:09,139
I pushed him over the edge.

813
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,851
You didn't do
anything wrong, Mom.

814
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:21,777
Hi! My name is Sophie McClaren,

815
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:23,821
and I'm looking for
your ex-wife, Jessie?

816
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,281
You mean the woman that left me
six months into our marriage

817
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,409
- for some old boyfriend?
- Uh...

818
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,578
I don't know where she is.
I don't wanna know.

819
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:39,962
You feelin' all right?
You're looking a little flushed.

820
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:43,048
And I have never known you
to leave a slice behind before.

821
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:46,260
Is this my doctor
or my brother asking?

822
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:49,346
I'm fine.
I'm just a little tired.

823
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:53,392
And Jackson, never comment
on a gay man's eating habits.

824
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,519
All right, that's fair.

825
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,396
This is nice though, isn't it?

826
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,106
Like I said, I-I feel
like I haven't even since you

827
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,149
since I've come home.

828
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,443
Yeah, this...

829
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:05,070
This whole Clark thing
has been really upsetting.

830
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:07,364
Dad lied to us, and then
you didn't even have my back.

831
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:09,158
That's not fair.

832
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,701
I think if we sit down
with Mom and talk...

833
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:13,412
I'm not interested in
hearing her excuses.

834
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:16,791
- Can we just let it go?
- Yeah, fine.

835
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:22,171
Esme. Hey.

836
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:24,006
Oh, fancy seeing you two here.

837
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,507
We were just starving,

838
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,009
so we thought we'd
grab a bite after work.

839
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,803
- Why don't you join us?
- What happened to just us?

840
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:33,766
You can't refuse a sick man.
Can you, Esme?

841
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:36,101
Sophie, come on, sit.
Help me, please.

842
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:37,269
Yeah, sure.

843
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,146
- Hey!
- Hey.

844
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:42,484
Hi! I ordered us a medium
mushroom and cheese to share.

845
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:48,739
So, how's the search for
our dead dad coming along?

846
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,034
I have some leads I'm working
on, but nothing solid yet.

847
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:56,080
Yeah, exactly.

848
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,666
Esme, please, just tell me
something exciting in your life.

849
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,417
Well, I'm working on
my first solo case.

850
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:01,585
- Really?
- Yeah.

851
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:03,504
- That's great!
- Thank you.

852
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:05,839
And then hopefully she can help
us find Clark after that, right?

853
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,509
Absolutely.

854
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,055
- You're helping too?
- Yeah!

855
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,140
Jonathan, it's... it's
okay to have some help.

856
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:17,142
Stop telling me
how to feel, Sophie.

857
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:18,477
Wow, okay, you need
to break it down.

858
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:20,813
You're not inside
my head, Jackson.

859
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:23,441
So please just stop
acting like it.

860
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:25,984
Sorry...

861
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:28,487
- Jonathan?
- Jonathan?

862
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:30,447
I got you, I got you,
I got you. Take it easy.

863
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:31,740
Are you okay?

864
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:33,909
Whoa, whoa, I need some water!

865
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,536
Hey, hey, hey...

866
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:36,977
Stay with me.
Hey, look at me, buddy.

867
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:43,168
That was so scary.

868
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:46,714
- I'm glad you were there.
- Yeah, me too.

869
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:48,841
And I've had a few is there
a doctor in the house moments,

870
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:50,300
but it's an entirely
different feeling

871
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,802
when the patient
is your own brother.

872
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,220
<i>Dr. Kravitz?</i>

873
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:54,722
<i>You have a visitor
in the main lobby.</i>

874
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,140
I really appreciate
you being here.

875
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:58,726
Hey, of course I'm here.
He's my best friend.

876
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:02,187
I mean, you are too, were.
I don't know.

877
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,732
I mean, we're still
friends, right?

878
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:06,817
I really missed
having you in my life.

879
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:09,862
Yeah, I mean, of
course we are, Soph.

880
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,113
I should've said
this a long time ago,

881
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,406
but I'm sorry.

882
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,033
I shouldn't have
taken off the way I did.

883
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:16,035
What do you mean?

884
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:18,078
You know,
taking the job in Manhattan

885
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,830
when you and Jonathan were
expecting me to stay in Buffalo

886
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:21,582
after my residency?

887
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,125
No, Jackson, it's not that

888
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:25,169
I was upset with you for leaving.

889
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,338
I mean, I was a little, yeah.

890
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,214
But it's more that you took off

891
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:31,300
right when things got bad with
my mom.

892
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:33,886
I mean, you just disappeared.
I needed my friend,

893
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,929
and you were just gone.

894
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,891
Look, there's really
no excuse, okay?

895
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:40,851
If I promise I won't
disappear on you again,

896
00:42:40,852 --> 00:42:43,145
you think you can forgive me?

897
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:46,148
Yeah, of course I forgive you.

898
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:48,776
I just want Jonathan to be okay.

899
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:52,029
- I need him to be okay.
- Yeah, me too.

900
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,365
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hey.

901
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:57,034
Uh... so the, uh,
doctor said that

902
00:42:57,035 --> 00:43:00,245
Jonathan has a mild infection.

903
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:03,332
It's nothing serious, but, uh,
his immune system is weakened

904
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,209
by the leukemia.

905
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,544
But he's responding very well
to the antibiotics, right?

906
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:09,421
Right.

907
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:11,715
And, um, they'll probably
be sending him home soon.

908
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:13,717
- Great.
- So that's it.

909
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:16,845
There's nothing else that
we can do right now, so...

910
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:18,097
I'll be taking your mother home.

911
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:19,432
- I'll see you, Dad.
- All right.

912
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:24,478
- See you later.
- See you, Mom.

913
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,230
Bye, honey.

914
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,482
Okay.

915
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:33,696
Ah, hey, so, um...

916
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:36,115
This is, um...

917
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,533
I need to talk to
you about something,

918
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:39,868
and I don't want to upset you.

919
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:43,080
Okay, you won't.
What is it?

920
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:45,124
I think that Clark
came back to see your mom

921
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,291
after she married George,

922
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,293
and I think... I don't know.

923
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:49,628
I think that George
knows something

924
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:51,005
that can help us find Clark.

925
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:55,342
But he won't talk to me,
so I was hoping...

926
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:57,845
- Maybe he'd talk to me.
- Thank you.

927
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,471
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

928
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,056
And I promise you, I will
be right by Jonathan's side

929
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:03,559
when he wakes up.

930
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,102
- Okay.
- See you soon.

931
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:06,312
Yeah.

932
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:13,068
- Hey.
- Hey.

933
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:15,321
I got your text.

934
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:18,992
Your mother's resting.

935
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,286
You know, this happened

936
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:23,871
so long ago,
I thought I was safe.

937
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:25,122
I should've figured Sophie

938
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:27,042
would be the one
that figured it out.

939
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:30,295
What happened?

940
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,750
I'm not proud of what I did.

941
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:38,218
I mean, Lord knows I always
try to do the right thing

942
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:40,054
and set a good example
for you boys.

943
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:42,639
But when someone
threatens your way of life

944
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,852
and your marriage...

945
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:48,688
you really learn what
you're capable of doing.

946
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,650
- Dad?
- Hm?

947
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:54,903
Just tell me.

948
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,452
You boys and your
mother were at the McClarens.

949
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:05,454
I was home alone, and Clark
comes and knocks on the door

950
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:07,206
like it was nothing.

951
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,247
Like the world hadn't
moved on since he disappeared.

952
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:13,712
Why did he come back here?
Did he say?

953
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:16,548
Yeah, he wanted
to apologize to your mother.

954
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:18,592
Said that he had managed
to escape from the car

955
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:20,719
as it hit the water,
but he had...

956
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,430
suffered a skull facture.

957
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:25,432
And then he wandered
downstream for miles

958
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:27,601
until he got picked up
by a truck driver.

959
00:45:27,602 --> 00:45:31,814
He spent weeks in the hospital
with his head injuries.

960
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:33,775
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

961
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:37,404
And I was terrified.

962
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,073
I was terrified
that once she saw him,

963
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:45,369
saw what he had become,

964
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,414
that she'd break it off
with me and go back to him.

965
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,626
To help him.

966
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:54,920
What do you mean? Why?

967
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:57,257
The night of the accident,
he lost his sight.

968
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,678
And he never got it back.

969
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,597
What?

970
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:23,825
- Hi, cutie.
- Hey.

971
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,244
Did I make it to
the door, at least?

972
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:28,871
Or did I pass out in
the middle of Tony's.

973
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,289
Middle of Tony's.

974
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,915
I am never gonna
live that down, am I?

975
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,251
- No.
- No way.

976
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,005
So? Any news?

977
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:40,549
You're gonna have to wait
for your oncologist for that.

978
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,635
But if the love doctor's in,

979
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:45,846
I might need some
more of your advice.

980
00:46:45,847 --> 00:46:48,307
I already told you...
The love doctor says

981
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:49,725
that it's time to put
on your big boy pants

982
00:46:49,726 --> 00:46:51,602
and ask the lady out.

983
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:54,229
Love doctor, hm?

984
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,647
Is this about Esme?

985
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:58,692
Yes, sadly still pining away.

986
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:00,944
Every time she comes
around, I get tongued tied

987
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:02,863
and I just choke.

988
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:04,656
Winston, you gotta
put yourself out there

989
00:47:04,657 --> 00:47:06,784
and damn the consequences.

990
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,410
Even if it means a broken heart?

991
00:47:08,411 --> 00:47:10,871
Yeah. Even if.

992
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,373
You don't want to
regret not going for it

993
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:13,874
when you had the chance.

994
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:16,752
The love doctor concurs
with the real doctor.

995
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:19,713
Hey!
You feelin' okay, Jonathan?

996
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:21,548
Yeah.

997
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:24,343
I could use a shower.

998
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,887
And maybe a...
an almond milk latte.

999
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:29,056
You know, we can take
care of the latte for you.

1000
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:31,767
Thank you.

1001
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:33,686
I have to get back to my lab.
See you later?

1002
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,063
See you, Winston.

1003
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:38,941
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

1004
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:40,777
All right, love doctor.

1005
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:47,574
My dad was hiding something big.

1006
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:49,451
I don't know how you knew,
but you were right.

1007
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:50,911
What did he say?

1008
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:53,122
Clark came to
the house one night.

1009
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:56,208
He wanted to talk to my mom.
Oh, and get this.

1010
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:58,335
The woman with the red hair,
she was with him.

1011
00:47:58,336 --> 00:47:59,795
My dad saw her
sitting in the car.

1012
00:47:59,796 --> 00:48:01,130
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1013
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:02,339
My mom, she wasn't home,

1014
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,299
and I think my dad
just freaked out,

1015
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,385
'cause he threatened Clark.

1016
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,303
Yeah, he told him
that he would expose him

1017
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:10,973
for faking his own death if
he didn't leave right away.

1018
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,809
I think that could've
landed Clark in big trouble.

1019
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,270
The worst part is, though,
because of the accident,

1020
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,106
- Clark lost his sight.
- Oh, that's awful.

1021
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:21,233
Yeah, I feel like
my entire world

1022
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:23,736
just got flipped
upside down, you know?

1023
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:26,072
Like, everything I ever
believed is just wrong.

1024
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:32,494
It's gonna be okay.
I promise.

1025
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:34,289
I hope so.

1026
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:41,795
Hey, as someone who was adopted,

1027
00:48:41,796 --> 00:48:45,299
I've spent my entire life
wrestling with that question.

1028
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,759
And it's always there,

1029
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,470
but it can be so hard
to pull out that string.

1030
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:52,807
I'm still afraid to
find my birth parents.

1031
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,313
My mom left me a package, and
I haven't even opened it yet.

1032
00:49:01,399 --> 00:49:04,109
It's a... it's a big leap to take.

1033
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,903
- Yeah.
- Are you going to?

1034
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:09,615
I don't know. Maybe.

1035
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,493
I mean, like you said,
everything feels upside down.

1036
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:14,203
Well, you'll know
what to do, Soph.

1037
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:15,788
You always do.

1038
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,332
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

1039
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:23,712
Okay, so the results are in.

1040
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:25,507
Dr. Turner, what is it?

1041
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:29,009
Maybe I shouldn't be here.

1042
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,012
Sophie, stay, please.

1043
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:36,892
So neither Dorothy
nor Jackson are a match.

1044
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:40,062
Obviously this is not
the news we were hoping for.

1045
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:42,189
Now, we're gonna send Jonathan
home with some antibiotics,

1046
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,693
but his infection
has us concerned, so...

1047
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:57,539
We need to find Clark. Now.

1048
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:07,548
Winston came through!

1049
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:09,049
I just got his email,

1050
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,218
and I am uploading
Jackson's DNA profile

1051
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,220
to all the registry sites.

1052
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:15,681
Ah, fingers crossed
something comes through.

1053
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:17,349
- I think it's a good bet.
- I don't know.

1054
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,226
I just feel like every
lead I've taken lately

1055
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:21,061
has led to a dead end.

1056
00:50:21,062 --> 00:50:24,773
Yeah, but you see things
other people don't, Soph.

1057
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:26,359
You got this.

1058
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:40,914
- Hi.
- Hi... Winston.

1059
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:45,253
I came here on the off
chance that you were here.

1060
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:49,423
Yes.

1061
00:50:49,424 --> 00:50:52,301
- Brought you donuts.
- Oh! Thank you!

1062
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:55,054
Sophie says you love donuts.

1063
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,890
Sophie...

1064
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,852
Yes, I do love donuts.

1065
00:51:01,853 --> 00:51:03,312
That's great.

1066
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,899
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

1067
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:12,821
May I have the honor of taking
you out for a cup of coffee,

1068
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:15,075
Esme Sabatier?

1069
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:18,411
Are you asking me out on a date?

1070
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,166
- Yes.
- Uh, then yes, yes,

1071
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:27,961
I would love to have
coffee with you, Winston.

1072
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:29,797
Yes.

1073
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,840
Okay.

1074
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:33,509
Okay, all right, uh...

1075
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:37,639
I'll call you later.

1076
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:42,518
You've made me so happy.

1077
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:43,895
I'm so glad.

1078
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:47,732
Oh.

1079
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:02,913
So that just happened.

1080
00:52:02,914 --> 00:52:04,415
I would hate to say
I told you so, but...

1081
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:05,834
You told me so.

1082
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:15,634
Seriously, Jackson,
you don't need to baby me.

1083
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:17,512
I'm fine.

1084
00:52:18,638 --> 00:52:21,015
You gotta take it easy, okay?

1085
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:23,267
Your body needs rest,
and I know you.

1086
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:24,893
You're gonna try to
get up off this couch

1087
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:27,062
and head back into work.

1088
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:32,609
I just... I don't wanna
think about being sick 24/7.

1089
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,862
I just wanna pretend that
everything's gonna be okay

1090
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:37,281
for, like, five minutes.

1091
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:39,074
I hate to break it to you,
but that's not how this works.

1092
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:40,325
Don't you think I know that?

1093
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:41,827
And when you keep
pushing everyone away,

1094
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:43,954
like me, and Mom,
and even Sophie,

1095
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:45,372
it's hard for me
not to just step in

1096
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:47,666
and deal with everything
for you, okay?

1097
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:49,418
That's the same problem
we've always had,

1098
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,420
you being the older brother.

1099
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:53,088
By two minutes. Settle down.

1100
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:54,757
And you act like I'm incapable
of looking after myself.

1101
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:56,467
Not true.

1102
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:58,302
Well, you went away and I
did just fine without you.

1103
00:52:58,303 --> 00:52:59,887
Yeah, well, I'm here now, okay?

1104
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:01,263
Yeah, and did someone's
life have to be at stake

1105
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:02,891
for you to come back?

1106
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,812
Even you can't fix
this for me, Jackson.

1107
00:53:08,813 --> 00:53:10,648
So please, just... just back off.

1108
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,158
You got it.

1109
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:23,745
Take your meds.

1110
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:37,341
I found her.

1111
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:39,551
I... I found her.
Soph? Soph?

1112
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:42,638
I found the missing link
to my love letters case.

1113
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,140
Okay, so the house was used
not just as a residence,

1114
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:47,059
but also a home-based business,

1115
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,187
mainly a hair salon called
Carlotta's Curls and Cuts,

1116
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:53,273
Carlotta being the woman
that owned the house in 1990.

1117
00:53:53,274 --> 00:53:54,942
Now, I reached out
to the former owner,

1118
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:56,777
and she said that Carlotta
not only ran her business there,

1119
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,946
but also lived there.

1120
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:01,281
- And her nickname was Charlie.
- Yes.

1121
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:03,033
So this whole time I thought
we were looking for a man.

1122
00:54:03,034 --> 00:54:04,576
It was Carlotta.

1123
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:06,912
So Carlotta just
emailed me back.

1124
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:09,206
Turns out she lives right
here in Elmwood Village.

1125
00:54:09,207 --> 00:54:10,541
What do you think about going

1126
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,501
and returning these
letters to her together?

1127
00:54:12,502 --> 00:54:13,628
Let's go.

1128
00:54:15,505 --> 00:54:17,131
So, you're looking for someone?

1129
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:20,051
Yes, and we think
it might be you.

1130
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:24,097
Those are Robert's letters.

1131
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:27,182
They were found
underneath the floorboards

1132
00:54:27,183 --> 00:54:28,475
of your cousin's house.

1133
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:30,102
It's changed hands
a few times since,

1134
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,855
but the current owner, a
young woman name Alicia,

1135
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:35,190
wanted to make sure that they
found their way back to you.

1136
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:37,026
I moved out after a few months,

1137
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:39,988
and when I realized I had left
them behind, it was too late.

1138
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:44,950
You don't know
what this means to me.

1139
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:47,662
Can I ask what happened
with you and Robert?

1140
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:52,459
Robert was my first love.

1141
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:58,006
He wrote these to me on his
first tour of duty in Iraq.

1142
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:02,969
We planned on getting married
when he came home, and we did.

1143
00:55:05,597 --> 00:55:07,765
Just so glad to have these back.

1144
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:11,060
Ah, part of him.

1145
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:14,521
Something I can share with
Eddie and Gregory... his words.

1146
00:55:14,522 --> 00:55:16,483
These memories are
so important to have.

1147
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,027
Your family is so beautiful.

1148
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:22,488
Edgar is a junior at
Baderton University,

1149
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,198
and Gregory is at a
school for the blind

1150
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,492
right here in Buffalo.

1151
00:55:32,707 --> 00:55:34,458
Wait up, Soph,
what's... what's going on?

1152
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:37,878
- Where has my mind been?
- What are you talking about?

1153
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,546
We have to get back
to the office.

1154
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:42,550
I have been totally
missing the obvious.

1155
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:52,267
Hi, my name is Sophie McClaren,

1156
00:55:52,268 --> 00:55:54,311
and I'm looking for
someone who I think...

1157
00:55:54,312 --> 00:55:56,712
<i>Hi, is there a Clark Higgins
that ever taught at your school?</i>

1158
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:02,171
<i>Hi, has a Clark Higgins
ever worked there?</i>

1159
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:04,239
Clark Higgins.

1160
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:08,742
You're sure?
He did. When?

1161
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:11,745
He retired?

1162
00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:15,082
Okay, um, is there
a forwarding address?

1163
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:17,585
No, okay. Thank you.

1164
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:26,761
Hi, Mom.
I wish you were here.

1165
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,765
I feel like I've
hit a brick wall.

1166
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:35,519
I just knew in my gut
that Clark was a teacher

1167
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,813
and he would go back
to teaching if he could,

1168
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:39,607
and that's how I'd find him.

1169
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:44,612
But I didn't.
I was too late.

1170
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:48,700
And I'm running
out of time, Mom.

1171
00:56:50,076 --> 00:56:53,246
And this is the
one case I can't fail.

1172
00:56:54,914 --> 00:56:56,875
And I'm worried that's
exactly what I'm doing.

1173
00:57:04,632 --> 00:57:06,633
<i>♪ So you're trying
to take away ♪</i>

1174
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:10,179
So once I finally found
Charlie, aka Carlotta,

1175
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,891
- she was thrilled.
- That's amazing.

1176
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:17,227
In my job, I don't usually
get to deliver good news.

1177
00:57:17,228 --> 00:57:19,063
I do hope they
find Clark, though,

1178
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:20,522
for Jonathan's sake.

1179
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:22,274
If anyone can do it,
it's Sophie and Jackson.

1180
00:57:22,275 --> 00:57:26,154
Yeah, those two are relentless.

1181
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:30,783
- So Winston...
- Hm?

1182
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:35,246
What was it that finally
made you decide to ask me out?

1183
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:40,168
Uh...

1184
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:45,089
Something Jackson said.

1185
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:50,469
I realized if I didn't put
aside my fear and ask you out,

1186
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:55,307
I was never going to
get to know the real you.

1187
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:58,770
And that would've been the
biggest regret of my life.

1188
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:09,864
Well, I'm really glad
that you finally did.

1189
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:14,285
Waiting... a long time, you know?

1190
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:24,044
<i>♪ I fell into, into ♪</i>

1191
00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:26,338
<i>♪ Your ♪</i>

1192
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:29,174

00:58:29,175 --> 00:58:31,219
The day we met.

1194
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:35,431

1195
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:40,728

1197
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,418
Hey, what can I get ya?

1198
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:06,629
I'll take a lager, please.

1199
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:15,846
Thank you.

1200
00:59:15,847 --> 00:59:18,766
Hey, so what brings you here?

1201
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:21,101
Nostalgia.

1202
00:59:21,102 --> 00:59:23,520
You've been here before?

1203
00:59:23,521 --> 00:59:26,148
No, um, my, um...

1204
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:28,233
My father has.

1205
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:29,693
All right, well, let me know if
you need anything else, buddy.

1206
00:59:29,694 --> 00:59:31,363
Yeah.

1207
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,813
Jessie, the red-haired woman.

1208
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,700
Food's about ready.

1209
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:20,829
Hey.

1210
01:00:21,913 --> 01:00:24,206
Sorry, I'm not
great company tonight.

1211
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:26,292
I just had a rough day.

1212
01:00:28,628 --> 01:00:31,588
Soph, whatever problems
you've faced in your life,

1213
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:33,675
you've always
found a workaround.

1214
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,177
It's not the same this time.

1215
01:00:37,178 --> 01:00:38,721
I...

1216
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:41,306
thought I had it.

1217
01:00:41,307 --> 01:00:43,852
And I don't know.

1218
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:53,193
From the moment you
came into our lives...

1219
01:00:53,194 --> 01:00:56,865
your mother and I knew there
was something special about you.

1220
01:00:58,074 --> 01:01:01,035
And we were right.

1221
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:02,876
You're the best thing
that ever happened to us.

1222
01:01:05,623 --> 01:01:09,336
You're gonna find Clark Higgins.
I have total faith.

1223
01:01:10,545 --> 01:01:11,880
Thanks, Dad.

1224
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:22,181
I... I still haven't opened
the package Mom left me.

1225
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:24,600
I want to.

1226
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:27,311
I just am not ready.

1227
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:28,854
Your mother would want you

1228
01:01:28,855 --> 01:01:31,398
to take as much
time as you need, honey.

1229
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:35,611
Opening the package
she left you is not a race.

1230
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:36,905
Yeah.

1231
01:01:39,991 --> 01:01:43,327
Sorry, Dad, um...

1232
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:46,413
it's Jackson.

1233
01:01:46,414 --> 01:01:48,332
Um, Dad, will you
check on dinner, okay?

1234
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,917
We just got a lead.

1235
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:51,419
Go get 'em, kiddo!

1236
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:56,173
Your mom gave me
a black-and-white photo.

1237
01:01:56,174 --> 01:01:59,093
That's why we couldn't tell that
Jessie was the red-headed woman.

1238
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:01,178
And that was who Anna
saw with Clark in Boston...

1239
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:03,722
Arm and arm because he's blind.

1240
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:05,557
That does make me
feel a little better

1241
01:02:05,558 --> 01:02:08,143
knowing he didn't just leave
my mom for another woman.

1242
01:02:08,144 --> 01:02:10,979
Wait, when I talked to Oscar,
he said that Jessie had left him

1243
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,731
for an old boyfriend.

1244
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:14,566
And the way this guy,
this K. Del Rio

1245
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,360
has his arm around her...

1246
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:18,237
You think that might
be the old boyfriend?

1247
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:19,822
And if she got married
and changed her name,

1248
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:21,950
that would explain
why we haven't found her.

1249
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:25,370
Okay.

1250
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:29,790
Um... I'm running a
search for Jessie Del Rio

1251
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:31,667
in the Massachusetts area,

1252
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:33,752
age range 50 to 60,

1253
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:35,379
with other family members in

1254
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,549
the same household
and the same age range,

1255
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,469
specifically men,
first initial K.

1256
01:02:43,304 --> 01:02:45,848
Look, there, the bottom entry.
Bradford, Mass.

1257
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:47,182
- Should we call?
- Yeah,

1258
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:48,727
it beats a seven-hour drive.

1259
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:57,276
<i>Hello?</i>

1260
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:58,986
Hi, my name is Sophie McClaren,
and I'm a forensic genealogist.

1261
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:01,238
<i>I'm looking for someone
who I think lived there.</i>

1262
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:02,698
<i>Jessie Del Rio?</i>

1263
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:04,616
No, there's no Jessie here.

1264
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:06,160
<i>Maybe you've got
the wrong number.</i>

1265
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,536
Is there anyone else
that I can speak to?

1266
01:03:07,537 --> 01:03:09,205
No, bye.

1267
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:15,127
Bust, huh?

1268
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,129
It was probably
just a wrong number.

1269
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,380
We'll find her.

1270
01:03:18,381 --> 01:03:20,132
It's only a matter of time.

1271
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:23,178
Time is the one thing
we don't have much of.

1272
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:26,764
Maybe we should just
head there tomorrow.

1273
01:03:26,765 --> 01:03:28,474
You know, check out
this address, the town nearby,

1274
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:31,393
see if anyone
remembers seeing her?

1275
01:03:31,394 --> 01:03:33,228
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
We're not giving up.

1276
01:03:33,229 --> 01:03:35,314
Okay, uh, I'll
expand the search,

1277
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:38,817
see if we can get
any more leads.

1278
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:40,944
And in the meantime, maybe
we can order some takeout.

1279
01:03:40,945 --> 01:03:42,154
I think that's
your best idea yet.

1280
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,531
Yes.

1281
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,334
I think it's a good idea,

1282
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:57,378
we just having
a little bit of food.

1283
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:59,880
I think someone was
getting a little hangry.

1284
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:02,467
Excuse me!
Who was the hangry one here?

1285
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:07,971
I think the last time
we had Chinese food together

1286
01:04:07,972 --> 01:04:10,099
was when we were
17 in New York City.

1287
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,558
Oh yeah, that's right.

1288
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:13,602
That little hole in
the wall in the Village.

1289
01:04:13,603 --> 01:04:15,979
That's the same night
that you, me, and Jonathan,

1290
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,773
went to that Springsteen concert
at the Garden, right?

1291
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:19,817
Yes, that was such a night!

1292
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,068
I remember I wanted to drive,

1293
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:22,695
but you wouldn't
let me touch the wheel

1294
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:24,446
because you always
had to be in control.

1295
01:04:24,447 --> 01:04:27,366
Whoa, I just, I like
to keep everyone safe.

1296
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:31,829
- That's why I became a doctor.
- That's true.

1297
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,206
You know, um...

1298
01:04:34,207 --> 01:04:37,292
that was the night
I almost kissed you.

1299
01:04:37,293 --> 01:04:40,295
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

1300
01:04:40,296 --> 01:04:43,173
What do you mean?

1301
01:04:43,174 --> 01:04:45,217
Remember, um, Jonathan
was asleep in the backseat,

1302
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:47,136
and we stopped at
that gas station?

1303
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:49,847
- Yes, 'cause I wanted a soda.
- That's right.

1304
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:51,348
Because Sophie wanted a soda,

1305
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:53,389
and I was trying to give
Sophie whatever she wanted.

1306
01:04:56,896 --> 01:04:59,065
So... what happened?
Why didn't you kiss me?

1307
01:04:59,816 --> 01:05:03,110
Uh... I don't know.

1308
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:05,821
We were... we were outside,
leaning against the car.

1309
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:07,489
Looking at the stars...

1310
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,409
Well, I was looking at you.

1311
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:13,538
And I leaned towards you
like this.

1312
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,959
And I was just about to
ask you if I could kiss you.

1313
01:05:20,795 --> 01:05:22,422
And then?

1314
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:26,467
And then, uh...

1315
01:05:26,468 --> 01:05:27,676
And then, I don't know.

1316
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:30,262
I guess I just chickened out?

1317
01:05:30,263 --> 01:05:34,308
Then Monday morning,
Jeff Wizorski asked you out.

1318
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:37,519
Jeff Wizorski? Wait, that guy
that asked me out to homecoming

1319
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,772
and then spent the entire night
talking to his friends,

1320
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:42,107
ignoring me, and who I never
went out with ever again?

1321
01:05:42,108 --> 01:05:44,943
- That guy?
- Yeah, that guy.

1322
01:05:44,944 --> 01:05:46,695
Mm-hmm.

1323
01:05:46,696 --> 01:05:48,822
So...

1324
01:05:48,823 --> 01:05:52,409
Why didn't you try to
kiss me again after that?

1325
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:54,079
I felt like I missed my chance.

1326
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:59,541
And then, um... I don't know.

1327
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:02,670
I decided that it wasn't
worth ruining our friendship

1328
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:05,047
over one meaningless kiss.

1329
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,466
Yeah.

1330
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:08,801
Yeah, you're right.
I mean, thank god

1331
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:11,512
we preserved our
friendship this long.

1332
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:12,846
Soph, I didn't
mean it like that.

1333
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:16,141
It's okay.
It's... no big deal.

1334
01:06:16,142 --> 01:06:19,144
And we've been on
different paths.

1335
01:06:19,145 --> 01:06:22,648
You know, you in
the city, me here.

1336
01:06:22,649 --> 01:06:25,234
I guess we wouldn't
have worked out anyway.

1337
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:26,860
Yeah.

1338
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:29,321
I guess not.

1339
01:06:29,322 --> 01:06:32,658
But I'm glad you're back.
I missed you.

1340
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:35,661
Yeah. Yeah,
I missed you too, Soph.

1341
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:38,580
You and Jonathan are
my closest friends.

1342
01:06:38,581 --> 01:06:40,916
That's important to me.

1343
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:45,380
Yeah. Friends. Right.

1344
01:07:01,479 --> 01:07:04,481
I have to say
that you called it.

1345
01:07:04,482 --> 01:07:05,733
Of course I did.

1346
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:08,028
Wait, what did I call?

1347
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:14,324
I can be a bit controlling.

1348
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:17,494
I push you to do what I
think is best and I always have.

1349
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:20,164
Wow, um... that was
not what I was expecting.

1350
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:24,501
And, um, I'm sorry.

1351
01:07:24,502 --> 01:07:26,670
But you know I only do it
because I love you, right?

1352
01:07:26,671 --> 01:07:30,132
Yeah, and I love you too.

1353
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:32,176
I mean, I didn't mean
to lay into you like that.

1354
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:33,886
But you know me.
When I think it...

1355
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:35,095
- I say it.
- You say it.

1356
01:07:35,096 --> 01:07:38,058
Yes, I know.

1357
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:42,436
I gotta lay down.

1358
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:43,605
Yeah.

1359
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,525
Look, I-I feel like an idiot
for not being here for you

1360
01:07:48,526 --> 01:07:50,152
like I should have.

1361
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:52,112
And when I moved to New York,

1362
01:07:52,113 --> 01:07:54,114
everything became
about the work for me.

1363
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:55,783
I...

1364
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:57,076
I just kind of
dropped the ball with

1365
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:59,454
everybody I cared
about back here.

1366
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:05,209
Yeah, you kinda did.

1367
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:06,711
Yeah.

1368
01:08:08,004 --> 01:08:10,548
Then I came back acting
like I was gonna fix you.

1369
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:13,445
Acting like I was
gonna fix everything.

1370
01:08:15,303 --> 01:08:20,182
But I wasn't a match, and...
then I couldn't find Clark.

1371
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:21,433
I just, I kind of feel like

1372
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:22,976
I just failed you
all around, you know?

1373
01:08:22,977 --> 01:08:24,896
You didn't fail me.

1374
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:29,274
- You're here with me now.
- Yeah.

1375
01:08:29,275 --> 01:08:31,235
Look, I know you.

1376
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:32,861
I know it's easier for you
to lock down your feelings

1377
01:08:32,862 --> 01:08:36,573
and focus on helping others.

1378
01:08:36,574 --> 01:08:38,951
But all I need...

1379
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:40,662
All I need is for
you to be my brother.

1380
01:08:42,288 --> 01:08:45,834
My older, less
attractive brother.

1381
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:52,841
Well, I can do that.

1382
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,594
Hey, so, uh...

1383
01:08:57,595 --> 01:09:02,599
Winston called
you the love doctor.

1384
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,184
Yeah.

1385
01:09:04,185 --> 01:09:06,061
It turns out that people
will ask for your opinion

1386
01:09:06,062 --> 01:09:08,272
if you just call it advice.

1387
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:09,982
Okay.

1388
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:11,942
Well...

1389
01:09:11,943 --> 01:09:14,695
I could use your advice, Doc.

1390
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:16,740
Let me guess. Sophie?

1391
01:09:19,284 --> 01:09:20,909
Are you finally admitting it?

1392
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,828
You have a thing for Sophie?

1393
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:26,165
I never actually
thought you'd admit it.

1394
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:28,375
- I owe Mom 100 bucks.
- What?

1395
01:09:28,376 --> 01:09:31,920
- Hey, hey, tell me everything.
- Um, okay.

1396
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:34,381
Um...

1397
01:09:34,382 --> 01:09:36,592
I may have already said
some embarrassing stuff.

1398
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:39,678
- Okay.
- Like, uh...

1399
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,263
that I tried to
kiss her that night

1400
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:42,681
that we were coming home
from that Springsteen concert.

1401
01:09:42,682 --> 01:09:45,267
Yeah, at the gas station.

1402
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:48,270
- Yeah, I wasn't really sleeping.
- You weren't?

1403
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:50,148
Dude. Okay, so what happened?

1404
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:54,902
I crashed and burned.

1405
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:57,613
Okay, so what are
you gonna do now?

1406
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:59,198
I don't know.

1407
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,367
My instincts are telling
me that I should just

1408
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:03,494
cut my losses and run,
but I don't wanna do that again.

1409
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:04,912
Jackson, I know you.

1410
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:07,206
And when you think
you're being so obvious,

1411
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:09,833
you so are not.

1412
01:10:09,834 --> 01:10:13,796
Buddy, tell her how you feel.

1413
01:10:13,797 --> 01:10:16,006
Don't beat around the bush.

1414
01:10:16,007 --> 01:10:18,926
Now, what did you tell Winston?

1415
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:21,011
To put yourself out there.

1416
01:10:21,012 --> 01:10:23,682
And damn the consequences.

1417
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:26,517
Yeah.

1418
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:28,436
Right.

1419
01:10:37,028 --> 01:10:38,654
Hey.

1420
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:40,280
George, what are you doing here?

1421
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:41,824
You have
every right to be angry.

1422
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:46,203
What I did was unforgivable
and I know that.

1423
01:10:46,204 --> 01:10:49,039
I was just so scared
of losing you.

1424
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,500
And losing the boys.

1425
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:53,919
And losing my family.

1426
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,464
And it was hard for me,
feeling second best.

1427
01:10:57,465 --> 01:11:00,050
That was never the
way it was between us.

1428
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:02,594
I married you
because I loved you.

1429
01:11:02,595 --> 01:11:04,138
I know that now.

1430
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:07,349
But back then, I was young,
and I was insecure.

1431
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:09,602
And I was stupid in love.

1432
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:13,355
We could lose Jonathan
because of what you did.

1433
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:16,067
Yeah, I know.

1434
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:22,156
And if I could go back in
time and change it, I would.

1435
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:25,534
But I can't.

1436
01:11:25,535 --> 01:11:28,579
George...

1437
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:34,501
I have never regretted our
life together, not for a minute.

1438
01:11:34,502 --> 01:11:38,756
You... you stepped up and
saved me when I was lost.

1439
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:40,591
Made a home for me and the boys.

1440
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:42,302
And you were...

1441
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:49,391
Are. You are
an incredible father.

1442
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:51,436
And I love you.

1443
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:56,274
Come here. Come here.

1444
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,469
<i>Jonathan?
Jackson, hey, open up!</i>

1445
01:12:25,553 --> 01:12:27,055
<i>Open up.</i>

1446
01:12:29,265 --> 01:12:31,767
- I found her.
- What are you talking about?

1447
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:32,851
We got a close family match

1448
01:12:32,852 --> 01:12:34,269
from one of the ancestry websites.

1449
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:36,188
The profile was private,

1450
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:38,816
so I couldn't access the profile
until the match came through.

1451
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:40,442
- Does this mean...
- Jessie Del Rio.

1452
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:41,860
Your DNA matched with hers.

1453
01:12:41,861 --> 01:12:43,904
And when I went to the
profile, I found this.

1454
01:12:43,905 --> 01:12:45,781
It's the same Bradford
address and phone number.

1455
01:12:45,782 --> 01:12:46,907
We had the right address.

1456
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:48,826
We just spoke to
the wrong person.

1457
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:51,829
Hey, what's going on?
Who won the lottery?

1458
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,498
Well, we did.

1459
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,459
That's Jessie, Clark's sister.

1460
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,794
You found him?

1461
01:12:58,795 --> 01:13:00,546
No, we found his sister,

1462
01:13:00,547 --> 01:13:02,923
but maybe she can help
make the connection to Clark.

1463
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:04,925
Or maybe she or
one of her family members

1464
01:13:04,926 --> 01:13:07,053
could be the match
we've been looking for.

1465
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:13,143
Oh!

1466
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:16,521
Isn't it great?

1467
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,446
Hello? Anyone home?

1468
01:13:27,115 --> 01:13:29,658
- Oh, hi!
- Who are you?

1469
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:31,201
Who do you want?

1470
01:13:31,202 --> 01:13:33,662
My name is Sophie McClaren.
This is Jackson.

1471
01:13:33,663 --> 01:13:36,040
I called you the other
day about Jessie Del Rio.

1472
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,666
Is she around?

1473
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,168
Look, we've been
driving all night.

1474
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:41,712
- We need to talk to her.
- My grandma owns this house.

1475
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:45,799
We don't know anyone
named Jessie Del Rio.

1476
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,968
Okay, um...

1477
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:49,489
Well, is there anyone
else that I can...

1478
01:13:56,102 --> 01:13:57,644
Okay.

1479
01:13:57,645 --> 01:13:59,981
- Clearly not a morning person.
- No.

1480
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,827
No, no, no, we can't go yet.

1481
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,704
So, what?

1482
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:17,831
We just wait, then?

1483
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:18,957
For someone who
doesn't even live here?

1484
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:20,626
Mm-hmm.

1485
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:22,169
Isn't that the
definition of insanity?

1486
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:23,587
Doing the same thing
over and over again

1487
01:14:23,588 --> 01:14:25,339
and expecting
a different outcome?

1488
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,676
Well, I guess we're insane
because we are not leaving.

1489
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:32,263
- Wow, Sophie, you are good.
- Yes, I am.

1490
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:46,443
You know that night
after the concert?

1491
01:14:46,444 --> 01:14:50,448
It wouldn't have been
just some meaningless kiss.

1492
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,701
What do you mean?

1493
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:55,327
I think that's
part of the reason

1494
01:14:55,328 --> 01:14:57,246
why I didn't come back
here much after college.

1495
01:14:57,247 --> 01:15:00,958
I was a little, uh, heartbroken.

1496
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:03,252
By your mysterious first love.

1497
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:04,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1498
01:15:07,507 --> 01:15:09,342
I missed my chance that night.

1499
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:12,177
And even though
I blamed Jeff Wizorski...

1500
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:13,846
Wait, wait, wait.

1501
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:17,225
What does Jeff Wizorski
have to do with anything?

1502
01:15:18,977 --> 01:15:20,729
Who do you think
I've been talking about?

1503
01:15:22,313 --> 01:15:26,275
Sophie... I was
talking about you.

1504
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:28,356
You were the girl that
no else could ever live up to.

1505
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:32,781
Uh...

1506
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:33,991
I'm sorry if this is a lot.

1507
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:36,535
Are you kidding me?

1508
01:15:36,536 --> 01:15:40,330
I was hung up on you for years.

1509
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:42,166
Jonathan still hasn't
let me live it down.

1510
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:45,044
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

1511
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:47,589
I mean, why do you think I was
so upset with you when you left?

1512
01:15:52,469 --> 01:15:54,136
- So that night...
- Yeah, I guess things

1513
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:56,431
could've been very different.

1514
01:15:58,016 --> 01:16:00,392
Look, Anna said it was blue.

1515
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:02,603
But it was gray.

1516
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:04,189
Come on, let's go.

1517
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:21,789
Oh hi, excuse me.
Jessie Del Rio?

1518
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,707
Yes?

1519
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:28,545
Hi, my name is Sophie McClaren,
and this is Jackson Ford.

1520
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:31,882
- Ford?
- Mm-hmm.

1521
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:33,842
And what can I do for you?

1522
01:16:33,843 --> 01:16:36,512
We're looking for Clark Higgins.

1523
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:37,763
He's, um...

1524
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:40,265
He's your father.

1525
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:43,019
Oh, come and give
your aunt Jessie a hug.

1526
01:16:45,605 --> 01:16:48,440
I was always wondering if one
of you boys would come looking.

1527
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:50,526
When my granddaughter
called just now and said

1528
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:51,902
she scared away
some lookie-loos.

1529
01:16:51,903 --> 01:16:54,446
I had no idea.

1530
01:16:54,447 --> 01:16:57,574
She listens to too many of
those true crime podcasts.

1531
01:16:57,575 --> 01:17:00,494
She thought you were
casing the joint or something.

1532
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:03,205
No.

1533
01:17:03,206 --> 01:17:05,708
You had a good reason
to come here, didn't you?

1534
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:07,251
Yes, ma'am.

1535
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:10,838
It's my brother, Jonathan.

1536
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:14,050
He's sick, and we
need to find our father.

1537
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:21,099
I think he'd love to meet you.

1538
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,980
This is surreal.

1539
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:30,858
If you'dve asked
me a few weeks ago

1540
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:33,360
I thought that today we'd be
meeting our biological father

1541
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:37,906
that we didn't even know existed...

1542
01:17:37,907 --> 01:17:40,035
I would've thought
you were nuts.

1543
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:59,053
You ready for this?

1544
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:01,639
Ready as I'll ever be.

1545
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:16,404
Jonathan and, uh, Jackson?

1546
01:18:17,113 --> 01:18:19,908
Hi, um, you must be Clark.

1547
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:26,413
I'm Jackson.
And, uh, this is Jonathan.

1548
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:27,999
Hi.

1549
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,793
Where to begin?

1550
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:34,880
Look, we're just happy
that Sophie found you.

1551
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:36,131
Now that you're
here with us now,

1552
01:18:36,132 --> 01:18:39,176
the rest of it
we can figure out.

1553
01:18:39,177 --> 01:18:41,513
- I'm happy too.
- Yeah.

1554
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:46,768
Here's Mom.

1555
01:18:54,025 --> 01:18:57,444
- Clark?
- Dorothy.

1556
01:18:57,445 --> 01:19:00,489
- Dorothy, I'm sorry.
- Why did you...

1557
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:02,074
I was afraid.

1558
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:04,118
And after my accident,
I didn't know what to do.

1559
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:08,038
I...

1560
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:11,250
I didn't know how
I could be father.

1561
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:14,003
It felt easier to be disappear,

1562
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:18,340
to give you and the boys
a fresh start without me.

1563
01:19:18,341 --> 01:19:20,843
I know it was wrong.

1564
01:19:20,844 --> 01:19:22,553
I was all alone.

1565
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:24,805
I tried to come back.

1566
01:19:24,806 --> 01:19:27,141
I know Anna saw me
and Jessie in Boston.

1567
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:29,351
But by then, I was
married to George.

1568
01:19:29,352 --> 01:19:32,563
And... he threatened you.

1569
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:35,274
He was just
trying to protect his family.

1570
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:38,193
He did what I couldn't.

1571
01:19:38,194 --> 01:19:41,155
I knew he loved you all.

1572
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:44,783
That's why I had
Jessie send that postcard.

1573
01:19:44,784 --> 01:19:47,870
The boys had a
father, had a family.

1574
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:51,958
It was too late for me
to come back from the dead.

1575
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:56,254
It's not... too late.

1576
01:20:02,385 --> 01:20:03,845
Never.

1577
01:20:05,221 --> 01:20:06,514
Thank you.

1578
01:20:08,516 --> 01:20:12,895
Look, I-I wanna know you both.
I wanna hear everything.

1579
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:15,689
Um, there's something
you all should know.

1580
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:17,191
Winston just sent me
your test results,

1581
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:20,528
and Clark, you're a match!

1582
01:20:27,869 --> 01:20:30,704
Jonathan, I wanna help.

1583
01:20:30,705 --> 01:20:33,875
I want to do this for you.

1584
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:52,477
Thank you. Thank you.

1585
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:11,246
Well, we're off to
kick cancer's butt!

1586
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:21,339
- I love you, darling.
- I love you too, Mom.

1587
01:21:25,593 --> 01:21:27,053
Here we go.

1588
01:21:39,232 --> 01:21:42,943
Thanks again, Soph.
For everything.

1589
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:45,237
For finding Clark,
and for never giving up.

1590
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:48,991
I don't think
giving up is in my DNA.

1591
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:51,870
- I bet I get that from my mom.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

1592
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:55,122
I've been thinking about

1593
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:56,790
sticking around
here for a while.

1594
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:58,334
I wanna be here for
Jonathan's recovery

1595
01:21:58,335 --> 01:21:59,626
and to get to know Clark.

1596
01:21:59,627 --> 01:22:01,003
Yeah, no, I think that's...

1597
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:02,629
I think that's a good idea.

1598
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:04,214
You don't get second
chances like this.

1599
01:22:04,215 --> 01:22:05,467
No, you don't.

1600
01:22:09,971 --> 01:22:14,892
You know, you Higgins-Fords
have kind of inspired me.

1601
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:19,688
I think it might be time for
me to find my birth parents.

1602
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:22,566
The package my mom left me,

1603
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:27,654
I think opening it is the first
step to finding out who I am.

1604
01:22:27,655 --> 01:22:31,076
And I didn't have the courage
to do that... until now.

1605
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:34,828
- Look, I know it can be scary.
- Yeah.

1606
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:36,914
But the truth
really will set you free.

1607
01:22:36,915 --> 01:22:38,955
I mean, look at me.
I'm living proof of that, right?

1608
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:44,713
Well, how do you feel
about grabbing a slice

1609
01:22:44,714 --> 01:22:46,632
at Big Tony's this weekend?

1610
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:48,300
There's a pinball machine
with your name on it.

1611
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:50,219
I'm still holding
top scorer, so...

1612
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,929
You are so on.

1613
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:53,806
Great.

1614
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:56,725
I'd hate to miss a shot...

1615
01:22:56,726 --> 01:22:58,853
at a second chance.

1616
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:04,943
- I'll see you then.
- Yeah.

1617
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:39,810
<i>My dear Sophie,</i>

1618
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:43,397
<i>If you're reading this letter,
then I'm in a better place.</i>

1619
01:23:43,398 --> 01:23:47,109
<i>Being your mother has been
the blessing of a lifetime.</i>

1620
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:49,278
<i>I know that one day, you'll be
ready to find the truth about</i>

1621
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:51,655
<i>where you came from.</i>

1622
01:23:51,656 --> 01:23:54,199
<i>All I have to give
you is this blanket</i>

1623
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,243
<i>wrapped around you the
night you were placed</i>

1624
01:23:56,244 --> 01:24:00,664
<i>on the firehouse steps... the
night you became my daughter.</i>

1625
01:24:00,665 --> 01:24:03,000
<i>I wish I could give you more.</i>

1626
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:05,210
<i>But I know you, Sophie McClaren.</i>

1627
01:24:05,211 --> 01:24:07,546
<i>You are incredible
at what you do.</i>

1628
01:24:07,547 --> 01:24:10,257
<i>And I know with this
one little clue,</i>

1629
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:13,218
<i>you can find all
the answers you need.</i>

1630
01:24:13,219 --> 01:24:15,179
<i>I love you more
than you can know.</i>

1631
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,349
<i>Forever and always, Mom.</i>
