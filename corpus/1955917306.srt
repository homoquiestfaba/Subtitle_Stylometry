Almost, Hognob. Somewhat further.

7
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.578
Do your best. We can do it.

8
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,147
Another small piece, Hognob.

9
00:04:41.057 --> 00:04:43.094
I can join.

10
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:49,978
Got you.

11
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,728
Still have it.

12
00:05:03.173 --> 00:05:08.795
No, Hognob. Enough.

13
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:15,383
Mum.
Come on, Hognob, we wake up Bobnar.

14
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:17,209
Chief?

15
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,626
Chief?

16
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:28,649
Are you awake, Chief?

17
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:33,697
Chief. Time to go hunting.

18
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:36,306
Quite early, do not you, Dug?
- But, Chief ...

19
00:05:36.484 --> 00:05:38.104
we are always early.

20
00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:43.905
Come on, everybody, wake up.

00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:46,982

Translation: NoBrainer, Mandy & TDK

23
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:03,461
Tomorrow, everybody.
- Tomorrow, Chief.

24
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,471
Frisk this morning.

25
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,917
Wait a minute, Chief.

26
00:06:17,452 --> 00:06:18,773
Chief.

27
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:22,377
I've been thinking.
Are we always hunting rabbits?

28
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:25,362
And they are still tasty too.

29
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:31,153
Yes, but can not we hunt for something bigger?

30
00:06:31.154 --> 00:06:36.583
Like a hare?
- Like a buffalo. Or a mammoth.

31
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:44,178
You want us to go hunting
on a five-ton, bone-breaking mammoth?

32
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,369
Yes, why not?

33
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:49.906
I think we can, Chief.

34
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:53,105
Dug, look at our forefathers.

35
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:59,200
They did not hunt big things either, did they?
They hunted small round creatures.

36
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,474
Or something.

37
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:04,784
What are they?

38
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:08,023
No idea.
They probably could not sign rabbits.

39
00:07:16.863 --> 00:07:19.023
Wait. Chief.

40
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:21,572
About that with that mammoth ...

41
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:26,766
Listen, I'll keep it in mind. good?

42
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:32,677
Come on, Dug.
Okay, collect all.

43
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:34,722
Grab a spear.

44
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,441
It is pointy.

45
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:41,146
Treebor, hurry up.
- Mom.

46
00:07:41.147 --> 00:07:42,984
Tomorrow, Barry.
- Tomorrow, Dug.

47
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:47,306
Will Mr. Rock go hunting today?
- He would not want to miss it for no gold.

48
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:52,663
Tomorrow, Asbo. Underwear changed?
- Yes, Chief, along with Thongo. The champion.

49
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:55,543
Chief?
- Yes, Gravelle?

50
00:07:56,096 --> 00:08:01,345
When I raise my arm, it hurts.
- Do not do that then.

51
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,759
Grubup, do not eat, that's Eemak.

52
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,182
Exactly. Good...

53
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:15,652
Head down, all.
- Thank you, Dug.

54
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:25,071
We thank our valley, our home ...

55
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:30,939
this valuable land that sustains us
and offers protection against the Badlands.

56
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:36,249
That we can live in peace,
in harmonious balance with our forest ...

57
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,207
and all the animals that we share it with.

58
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,871
Okay, let's kill something.

59
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:36,021
A rabbit.

60
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:41,901
Very well.

61
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,102
I got him.

62
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,322
He's coming, Eemak

63
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:59,058
Nice try.
- The surprise attack.

64
00:10:01.316 --> 00:10:02.516
Right, Chief.

65
00:10:03.297 --> 00:10:04,600
I got him.

66
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:08,350
Nope.

67
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10.664
Crazy. Champion.

68
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:18,624
I'll take him, Gravelle.

69
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:27,532
Let me out. I'm stuck.

70
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:36,822
Well done, Mr. Rock.

71
00:10:38.303 --> 00:10:42.613
Well done, everyone.
Rabbit surprise tonight.

72
00:10:56,766 --> 00:11:01,322
See, Dug?
We hunt rabbits and everything is good.

73
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:07,049
The thing with rabbits is, Chief ...
They are rather small.

74
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,629
Dug, look at us.

75
00:11:10.825 --> 00:11:13.985
Do you really think we do
can catch a mammoth?

76
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:15,585
Good footwork, Mr. Rock.

77
00:11:15.836 --> 00:11:17.386
We?

78
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:19,995
You have practiced.

79
00:11:32,603?? --> 00:11:34,194
All quiet.

80
00:12:12.229 --> 00:12:14.784
The rabbits fight back.

81
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,698
These are not rabbits.

82
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,278
Attack.

83
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:54,905
Mr. Rock.

84
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,959
To the Badlands.

85
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,652
The valley out?
- Get out.

86
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,530
Hognob.

87
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,771
Where is Dug? Have you seen Dug?

88
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:27,203
Go ahead.
- Thanks, Chief.

89
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:30,410
Dug.

90
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:12,074
Excellent.

91
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:20,133
Secure the valley and dig it up.

92
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,672
What about, Mr. Nooth?

93
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:31,039
Dumb cup. Dig up the ore.
The metal that is in the ground.

94
00:14:32.241 --> 00:14:35.880
The ore in the ground.

95
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:44,292
And the primitives?
- Let them creep in the Badlands.

96
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:47,214
They have not performed anything
with their tiny flints ...

97
00:14:47.215 --> 00:14:49.521
You have chosen the wrong strain.

98
00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:55.386
I am so afraid of your stones.
The Stone Age is over, dino.

99
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:59,275
Long live the Bronze Age.

100
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:16,760
Okay, we're going.
- Good, Mr. Nooth.

101
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:18,945
I am late for my massage.

102
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.557
Hey, get out.

103
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:56,027
Multifunctional pocket swords.
Also handy for opening bottles.

104
00:16:56,323 --> 00:17:01.475
Sliced ??bread. This is the best since ever.

105
00:17:12.028 --> 00:17:13.704
Stay away from the bronze.

106
00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:18.040
The what?
- The bronze. Do you sometimes come from the Stone Age?

107
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:36,295
CLOSED

108
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:48,599
50 schnookels.

109
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,817
Voluntary contribution, everyone has to pay.

110
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:57,021
It has become more expensive again.
- 50 schnookels. Voluntary contribution.

111
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:59,719
She did not voluntarily contribute.

112
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:01,494
Stop her.

113
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,785
Stop her.

114
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,539
Hey.

115
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,492
<i> I really would not want to be there. </ i>

116
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:07,870
Hόgelgraber, do you sometimes not see well?
The arena is this way.

117
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:14,889
Your sissies are being slaughtered.

118
00:19:17.783 --> 00:19:18.800
Walk.

119
00:19:36,764 --> 00:19:42,690
All up for our powerful leader:
Mr. Nooth.

120
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:48,712
Who challenges the champions?

121
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:53,938
We challenge them.
- We accept the challenge.

122
00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:58.938
The time has arrived.

123
00:20:01.006 --> 00:20:04,616
Let the holy game begin.

124
00:20:14.704 --> 00:20:18.305
<i> See here for you: Real Bronzio ... </ i>

125
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.134
<i> with their leader Jurgend. </ i>

126
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:25,743
<i> The official for today: referee Dino. </ i>

127
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:32,765
In the name of Queen Oofeefa
we thank you for the great game.

128
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,676
Playing football.

129
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.50
While I count my schnokels.

130
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:02,722
Hόgelgraber, what are you doing?
Go on goal.

131
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:06,241
What's with Hόgelgraber? Come on.

132
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,469
Pick up.

133
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,468
To me.

134
00:21:17.689 --> 00:21:20.002
Release.

135
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:23,835
Free kick.

136
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,489
Hόgelgraber, just join.

137
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,457
Just kick.

138
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:19,578
What are you doing, Hόgelgraber?
You make your own goal.

139
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:23,354
He is not me.

140
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:37,597
A caveman?

141
00:22:37.835 --> 00:22:41.184
Who plays the holy game? Bring him here.

142
00:22:43,324 --> 00:22:45,090
How dare you...

143
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:51,613
How dare you go
on our holy ground.

144
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:57,968
You have taken our land. Our home.

145
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,784
Which? Say, Stone Age Animal,
you have no home.

146
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:06,837
It's done with your kind.

147
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:10,549
Take him and kill him, slowly.

148
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:20,929
I mean, take him normally
and then slowly kill him. Idiots.

149
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,912
Continue with the game.

150
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:27,927
<i> We challenge the champions. </ i>

151
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,985
Wait.

152
00:23:42.139 --> 00:23:45.36
We challenge the champions.

153
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,322
What did you say?

154
00:23:49,713 --> 00:23:52,967
He said, "We are ...".
- I heard him.

155
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:59,284
If we win, we will keep our valley.
You leave my tribe alone.

156
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:06,121
You think you can beat us with football?

157
00:24:14,116 --> 00:24:17,947
A match between Bronze and the beasts?

158
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:22,679
What an idea.
- Sacrilege, leader.

159
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,389
Yes indeed.

160
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,963
The mass would be such a vulgar spectacle
love it.

161
00:24:32.589 --> 00:24:34.110
For real?

162
00:24:34.703 --> 00:24:37.727
For the valley, huh?

163
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,661
Dug.
- It's Dug.

164
00:25:10.418 --> 00:25:13.627
What does he have for fruit?

165
00:25:14.874 --> 00:25:17.955
Football? What is that?

166
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:22,964
And how do we get our valley back?
- It's a great game, Chief.

167
00:25:23.509 --> 00:25:27.740
The leader of the Bronze people says,
that if we win this game from them ...

168
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:31,082
Nice and short pants, say.
- Mom.

169
00:25:31.083 --> 00:25:34.191
... we get our valley back.
- We want that.

170
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:36,548
And if we do not beat them?

171
00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:43.062
Then we spend the rest of our lives
working in a mine.

172
00:25:47.297 --> 00:25:48.537
What is a mine?

173
00:25:48.538 --> 00:25:52.452
Dug, we've never played this game before.

174
00:25:52,453 --> 00:25:56,639
That's right. Someday.

175
00:25:57.401 --> 00:26:00.074
Those petroglyphs in our valley ...

176
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:04,363
are from our ancestors playing football.

177
00:26:12.662 --> 00:26:14.935
Champion.
- If they did ...

178
00:26:15,714 --> 00:26:17,558
why do not we?

179
00:26:20,891 --> 00:26:26,954
I always smell of flickering memories.
- This does not change anything, Dug. It is too risky.

180
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:29,257
Come on, Chief. We can do it.

181
00:26:29,258 --> 00:26:33,822
I want to play soccer. Now.

182
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:36,751
Listen, we're not going ... No.

183
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,174
Okay, do not worry about us.

184
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:47,542
It will be fine with us.
We just die painfully in the Badlands.

185
00:26:49.158 --> 00:26:53,996
Now, Chief. Please give us a chance.

186
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:05,329
All right then. We're going to try that football thing.

187
00:27:09,803 --> 00:27:13,783
I promise nothing.
- The match is played at full moon.

188
00:27:15.488 --> 00:27:21.017
And then we can go back to the valley.
- Fat.

189
00:27:38.527 --> 00:27:43.575
All right, draw up. They are yours, Dug.
- Thanks, Chief.

190
00:27:44.006 --> 00:27:45.44
Good.

191
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,873
Are boars allowed to play football?

192
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:54,681
No, I do not think so. Sorry, Hognob.

193
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:01,381
This is a football.

194
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:05,983
One side tries the ball
Kicking this goal ...

195
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:12,137
and the other side tries the ball
to kick in that goal.

196
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:15,526
Football sounds difficult.

197
00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:18.191
What is happening
if you shot the ball in it?

198
00:28:18,1992 --> 00:28:22,276
If you do that,
the other men will hug you and kiss you.

199
00:28:25.154 --> 00:28:27.777
Who wants to try?
- I do.

200
00:28:28.122 --> 00:28:32.202
Mom.
- Good, Magma. Fine.

201
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:38,488
I'm trying to catch a ball
and you have to stop me, okay?

202
00:28:41.295 --> 00:28:42.400
Come on.

203
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,526
Beautiful.

204
00:28:45.988 --> 00:28:48.521
Tight action, Mom.
- Football is great.

205
00:28:48.522 --> 00:28:53,349
That can not be right.
You can not hit other players.

206
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,991
No, you have to attack the ball.

207
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,801
No, no weapons.

208
00:29:00,802 --> 00:29:04,028
With the fist?
- No not at all.

209
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:05,951
What's fun about that?

210
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:21,451
Okay, Thongo.

211
00:29:28,678 --> 00:29:31,928
Nice try. Next one.

212
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35,384
Hognob.

213
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,304
Do your best, Asbo.

214
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:04,579
Sorry, can we return our ball?

215
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:12,453
Trust me, Dino.

216
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:17,556
This football match between
the Stone Age and the Bronze World is perfect.

217
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:21.450
I love it.
- From football.

218
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:25,341
No, from bronze.

219
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:30,772
It is so cold, hard and smooth.

220
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:40,925
With this competition I am going to earn a lot of it.
- What if the queen discovers it?

221
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:46,256
That old pie?
She does not know what is happening here, fortunately.

222
00:30:50,1993 --> 00:30:54.94
Deliver message.
- Your Football, a message bird.

223
00:30:58,914 --> 00:31:01,552
Come, make sure it's ...

224
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:11,553
Hey? How do you use such a message bird?

225
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:13,227
It is the queen.

226
00:31:14.905 --> 00:31:18.827
Speak in his ear, ma'am.
He does everything he hears.

227
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:24,396
But if I do not even know if I can ...
Test, test.

228
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:28,466
Nooth?
- Maybe she heard about the match.

229
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:32,637
Of course not.
- I heard about the match.

230
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:37,518
You organize a football match
wanted a couple?

231
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:42,246
Idiot. Imagine that we lose.
- That does not happen.

232
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,814
I said: imagine. Exactly.

233
00:31:45.3737 --> 00:31:51.005
The mighty Bronze Age brought to its knees
by a bunch of cavemen.

234
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:56,455
I warn you, Nooth.
You better not lose.

235
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,337
End of message.

236
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:11,219
Silly old witch.
How dare she speak to me like that?

237
00:32:11.242 --> 00:32:16.690
Silly old witch.
How dare she speak to me like that?

238
00:32:16.714 --> 00:32:18.385
Deliver message.

239
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:27,321
Guards, get that bird back.
What does the queen know?

240
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:31,661
The cavemen are pummels. My players are ...
- Overpaid?

241
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:35,836
Champions.
- Oh yes, champions.

242
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:39,987
They think, sleep and eat football.

243
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:44,226
I do not think the cavemen do that.

244
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:47,845
Get up, time to start training.

245
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:54,239
To him, to her, to me.
- I'm free.

246
00:33:01.006 --> 00:33:02.566
No, not like that.

247
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:08,288
With 'free kick' I meant the ball.
- Sorry, Dug.

248
00:33:08.502 --> 00:33:10.614
Hognob, no.

249
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:18,530
Barry, where are you going? Do not go away.
- Football is difficult.

250
00:33:18.553 --> 00:33:21,353
Dug, my toe is doing very well.

251
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,298
Quietly, Magma.
- Grubup, let go. I told you...

252
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,970
This is the only one we have.

253
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:36,315
Come on everybody. We must be able to do this.
Do not sit down.

254
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:40,827
Grubup does not like football.
Grubup gets hungry.

255
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,890
Eemak, keep it inside.

256
00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:50.452
Food. Jammie.

257
00:34:14.566 --> 00:34:17,151
A D.

258
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:20,895
No, duck.

259
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:27,600
Look, a big man-eating wild duck.
Flight.

260
00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:10.096
You have not eaten your original soup.
- I have no appetite.

261
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:27,063
Dug, give up football,
for their own good.

262
00:35:27.185 --> 00:35:29.667
They just can not.

263
00:35:29,785 --> 00:35:34,544
Do you miss the valley?
- The valley is gone.

264
00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:38.426
We're better off in the desert,
then dabbling in a mine.

265
00:35:38.545 --> 00:35:43.081
There is a big, strange duck,
but at least we are together.

266
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:48,562
We are still a tribe.
- We know that our ancestors played football.

267
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:52,939
I still think we can do it.
- By which?

268
00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:55.973
You do not even have a ball.

269
00:36:01.573 --> 00:36:03.028
It is over.

270
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:14,780
No, there is still time. Come, Hognob.

271
00:36:33.272 --> 00:36:36.280
Okay, Hognob.

272
00:36:47.793 --> 00:36:51.003
Let's get balls.

273
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,357
What is this for strange magic?

274
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,646
Hognob, stay here.
I do not want to attract attention.

275
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:10,101
<i> What kind of noise? </ i>

276
00:38:12.126 --> 00:38:14.084
<i> Is that you, Stefano? </ i>

277
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:19,594
<i> Stop messing around and come here
with those sturdy hands from you. </ i>

278
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:29,311
Come on, Stefano.
It is time for my massage.

279
00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:31.517
HOLBEWONERSVVECHT
WEDEWOEDE

280
00:38:45.369 --> 00:38:49.201
The new player gets the ball
on the center circle.

281
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:56,379
She passes one, plays the other through the legs
and laps perfectly over the defender.

282
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,299
She goes all the way. She shoots and scores.

283
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:07,939
And the audience is going loose. Goal.

284
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:29,373
I need this, Stefano. I am stressed.

285
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:32,230
A hardworking governor like me ...

286
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:37,653
who is trapped in this terrible desert,
deserves some extras.

287
00:39:37.776 --> 00:39:42.177
Simple pleasures,
such as good food, a massage ...

288
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:47,534
his own football team.
Hurry up. I do not have the whole day.

289
00:39:49.415 --> 00:39:55.265
My tendons feel like rope.
Wash the whole pig.

290
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,779
You're that crazy caveman.
- The angry potter.

291
00:40:03,898 --> 00:40:08,100
What are you doing here, caveman?
This is the holy field. Nobody can come here.

292
00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:11.507
Balls. I need balls.

293
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:16,100
You broke into the stadium,
just to find balls?

294
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:20,228
You are brave, caveman.

295
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:28,108
And stupid. More stupid than brave actually.
- Thank you.

296
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:30,415
By the way, I am Goona.

297
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,813
Dug.

298
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.271
Come on, I can help.

299
00:40:42.423 --> 00:40:44.550
That's nice.

300
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:50.229
I do not know why the queen
is worried.

301
00:40:51.543 --> 00:40:54,881
We know that cavemen are losers.

302
00:40:54.904 --> 00:40:58.064
Those Stone Age chisels
can not even beat their own grandmothers.

303
00:40:58,183 --> 00:41:03,352
Stupid croquettes. Dumb boobs.

304
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:08,744
Stefano, not that hard. That is enough massage.

305
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:11,912
How about soothing music?

306
00:41:19,252 --> 00:41:22,835
I'm jealous of you.
- On me?

307
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:28,538
You can go on that holy field
play for thousands of fans.

308
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:31,507
Maybe you will ever do that too.

309
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:34,917
Do you think girls
to play for Real Bronzio?

310
00:41:35.516 --> 00:41:40.029
You are really crazy.
Why do you think I'm secretly coming here?

311
00:41:40,627 --> 00:41:41,918
Who is that?

312
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:45,478
Scarper.
- Stop, thieves.

313
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:46,957
Here.

314
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:55,840
They went there. No, there.

315
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:03,464
Give me, quickly.

316
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:16,617
You're very good.
- Thanks. I exercise a lot.

317
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:22,792
I have a great idea.

318
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:33,875
Come.

319
00:42:41.875 --> 00:42:44.886
What are you having tonight, Stefano?

320
00:42:45.197 --> 00:42:47.598
Stefano?
- Yes, Sire?

321
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.527
Hognob.

322
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,401
Hognob, this is Goona. Goona, Hognob.
Hi, Hognob.

323
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,161
Is it going, Sire?
- Of course not, idiot.

324
00:43:28.602 --> 00:43:31.565
I just received a massage from a pig.

325
00:43:40.229 --> 00:43:43.794
Wake up, everyone.
I want to introduce you to someone.

326
00:43:44,104 --> 00:43:47,634
This is Goona.
- Hi.

327
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:51,166
She helps us win.
- Why would she do that?

328
00:43:51.193 --> 00:43:55.225
Then she can go on the holy field
play for thousands of fans.

329
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,410
Nice to be there.
In what system do you play?

330
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:06,393
System?
- 4-4-2 or 4-4-3? Who is the central defender?

331
00:44:07.088 --> 00:44:13,179
Do you play on the man or in a zone?
- We kick the ball and run after it.

332
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:19,434
Do you think you beat Real Bronzio?
by running after the ball?

333
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:22,561
You must get to know the opponent.

334
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:31,097
This is Jurgend, the captain.
The best goal scorer in the known world.

335
00:44:32.034 --> 00:44:35.099
And he is also known. Their winger ...

336
00:44:35,122 --> 00:44:38,908
Lightning Hammer.
He never shoots at the same place twice.

337
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:46.45
Midfielder Qwik Wun Tu.
He kicks faster than you can think.

338
00:44:47,468 --> 00:44:49,810
Defender Gonad the Gaul.

339
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:53,301
Nobody escapes his tackle.

340
00:44:56.182 --> 00:44:57.67
Mom.

341
00:44:57,918 --> 00:45:02,795
Make no mistake.
These are the best players that bronze can buy.

342
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:08,317
They are huge, gigantic football giants.

343
00:45:08,436 --> 00:45:11,861
We can never beat such a good team.

344
00:45:12.623 --> 00:45:16.12
They might be good,
but they are not a team.

345
00:45:17.903 --> 00:45:21.213
They are eleven players
who all think they are the star.

346
00:45:21.527 --> 00:45:25,398
That is their weakness
and so you can defeat them.

347
00:45:28.037 --> 00:45:29.566
Goona is right.

348
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:34,343
They might be better players,
but we have something they do not have.

349
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:39,769
Moss?
- No moss, Barry. We have each other.

350
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.366
If we work together, maybe it works.

351
00:45:47.184 --> 00:45:51.439
We have a lot to do
and do not even have a full team.

352
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,640
What is happening here?
- This is Goona and she helps us win.

353
00:45:58,663 --> 00:46:03,291
I thought we were done with football.
- Not now that you are there. You're in the team.

354
00:46:04.576 --> 00:46:09.281
I'm not going to play. I am an old man.
I am almost 32.

355
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,008
That is indeed old. You are the keeper.

356
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,665
That is setteled then.

357
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,561
Where is your training facility?
Real Bronzio has the best.

358
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,451
The only thing we have is ...

359
00:46:23,682 --> 00:46:25,241
the desert.

360
00:46:28.041 --> 00:46:30.372
Three two one.

361
00:46:31.163 --> 00:46:32.780
Here, everyone.

362
00:46:34,074 --> 00:46:37,930
What are you doing?
- There, everyone.

363
00:46:51.362 --> 00:46:53.125
This is dangerous.

364
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:02,292
What do you want that ...

365
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:13,413
Get well ...
- Play over and keep moving. This is important.

366
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:16,051
But whatever happens, stay in formation.

367
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:57,641
If so. All work together.

368
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:11,927
This can also be added.
You found this in the valley of primitives?

369
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:17,169
Their ancestors played soccer much earlier than we did.

370
00:48:17,288 --> 00:48:22,968
The queen may not know this.
- Deliver message.

371
00:48:23,379 --> 00:48:24,804
Oh no.

372
00:48:24,827 --> 00:48:29,001
Why do I hear that the savages ...

373
00:48:29,316 --> 00:48:33,233
have played soccer much earlier than we do?

374
00:48:33,643 --> 00:48:39,531
I did not know.
- According to my spies, they get better.

375
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:41,651
They train every day.

376
00:48:43,874 --> 00:48:48,410
Do not ruin this, Nooth, or else ...

377
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:56,341
I tell you who enters the mine. You.

378
00:48:56,939 --> 00:49:01,931
It's enough like this.
They are Steentijdbruten. They live in caves.

379
00:49:02.054 --> 00:49:06.251
They eat mud. I have to switch them off.

380
00:49:06,374 --> 00:49:12,292
Making their caveman-headies crazy.
- Brilliant. How do we do that?

381
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:16,166
No idea.
The solution does not just come in.

382
00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:24.677
Sire, we have something else
in the mine of the valley.

383
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,565
We have made a copy for you.

384
00:49:38.413 --> 00:49:41.006
That is perfect.

385
00:49:47,815 --> 00:49:49,167
Hognob.

386
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,711
Good rescue.

387
00:49:55,169 --> 00:49:58,658
We might have a chance tomorrow.

388
00:49:58,947 --> 00:50:01,632
A small chance, but a chance.

389
00:50:01,654 --> 00:50:04,808
If our ancestors did, we can do it too.

390
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:07,545
Not bad for 32, right?

391
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:11,055
Never thought I would say this,
but we are good.

392
00:50:11.178 --> 00:50:13.290
Here.
- That's mine.

393
00:50:17.215 --> 00:50:18.380
I'll get it.

394
00:50:32,618 --> 00:50:34,577
Back home soon.

395
00:50:45.98 --> 00:50:49.082
What are you doing? Let me go.

396
00:50:50,164 --> 00:50:55,987
Calm down, caveman.
I just wanted to show our new mine.

397
00:50:57.565 --> 00:51:01.075
You will soon get a lot of bronze out of it.

398
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:04,278
We do not enter any mine, mammoth head.

399
00:51:04.301 --> 00:51:08.172
Because you are great footballers ...

400
00:51:08,634 --> 00:51:11,055
just like your ancestors.

401
00:51:11,677 --> 00:51:12,971
You...

402
00:51:13.005 --> 00:51:14.605
You know them?

403
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,305
We did not only find bronze here.

404
00:51:32,158 --> 00:51:34,117
What?

405
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:38,478
More cave paintings?

406
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:39,940
Yes.

407
00:51:40.159 --> 00:51:44.185
But these tell the whole story.

408
00:51:45.366 --> 00:51:50.528
Your ancestors did not just play football ...

409
00:51:50.561 --> 00:51:52.666
they invented it.

410
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:58,327
You even taught other tribes the rules.

411
00:51:59,922 --> 00:52:02,122
But you had one problem.

412
00:52:02.155 --> 00:52:05.057
No matter how much you tried ...

413
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:08,644
you always lost.

414
00:52:09.266 --> 00:52:11.222
Game after game ...

415
00:52:11,255 --> 00:52:13,276
match after game.

416
00:52:14,624 --> 00:52:17,812
You gave it, after many moons ...

417
00:52:19,024 --> 00:52:22,682
even just on.

418
00:52:22,716 --> 00:52:25,443
It was too painful for you.

419
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:27,583
Your tribe ...

420
00:52:27,617 --> 00:52:30,374
was rock-solid in football.

421
00:52:30,755 --> 00:52:32,856
You are losers, caveman.

422
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,442
Always has been.

423
00:52:34,475 --> 00:52:37,241
And you will stay that way.
- No.

424
00:52:37.745 --> 00:52:39.854
No, that can not be true.

425
00:52:39,888 --> 00:52:43,194
Do you really believe that you can beat us tomorrow?

426
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:45,287
Come face it, caveman ...

427
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:49,213
you and your tribe do not have it in you.

428
00:52:50,226 --> 00:52:53,609
But I want to offer you a deal.

429
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:56,124
A way out.

430
00:52:58,187 --> 00:53:00,834
Sleep time. Great day tomorrow.

431
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:04,329
Come on, Treebor.
- Can I sleep in a football outfit?

432
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:06,126
Goodnight everybody.

433
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,964
Think about it, caveman, because the mine is waiting.

434
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:19,085
On you and your primitive friends.

435
00:53:27,673 --> 00:53:29,189
To work.

436
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:35,401
My arm hurts.

437
00:53:36.165 --> 00:53:39.510
Where are you, Mama?
- Silence.

438
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:43,766
Idiot, what did you do?

439
00:53:45,671 --> 00:53:49,292
In the end, we are only one tribe
that hunts rabbits.

440
00:53:49.325 --> 00:53:51.037
I'm sorry, Chief.

441
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:53.629
I did not want this to happen.

442
00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:55.583
You have to believe me.

443
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:02,978
Hognob.

444
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.996
My dear, dear friend.

445
00:54:14,274 --> 00:54:16,327
What if I'm wrong?

446
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:20,012
What if Chief was always right?

447
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,368
What if we are just a tribe
who hunts rabbits?

448
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:28,046
Forgive me, Hognob ...

449
00:54:29.155 --> 00:54:31.037
but I have to close a deal.

450
00:54:31.071 --> 00:54:33.112
I have to save the tribe.

451
00:54:57,116 --> 00:55:00,637
Buy your cuddly caveman here,
before they die out.

452
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:03,784
100 schnookels.

453
00:55:03,818 --> 00:55:06,783
Free contribution. Everyone has to pay.

454
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:08,037
100 schnookels.

455
00:55:08.156 --> 00:55:10.683
It has doubled.
- Free contribution.

456
00:55:10.717 --> 00:55:12.888
Everyone has to pay.
- This is outrageous.

457
00:55:12.922 --> 00:55:15.572
Can you exchange against a plate?

458
00:55:17,637 --> 00:55:20,252
It goes according to plan, Dino.

459
00:55:20,845 --> 00:55:23,781
I love you, small, bronze coin.

460
00:55:23,814 --> 00:55:25,196
Hey.

461
00:55:25,437 --> 00:55:27,690
I love you, and yours.

462
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:28,952
And also yours.

463
00:55:29,977 --> 00:55:31,920
What are you doing?

464
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,214
Not that stupid old bird again.

465
00:55:34.248 --> 00:55:37.138
Tell cook to cook it.

466
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:40,621
Stupid old bird?

467
00:55:41.517 --> 00:55:43,898
'Cook'?

468
00:55:45,399 --> 00:55:47,057
Your Majesty.

469
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:50.003
This is an unexpected ...

470
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,082
pleasure.

471
00:55:53.118 --> 00:55:55.966
I thought I would come to this contest myself ...

472
00:55:55,999 --> 00:56:00,893
and what to amuse me.
- A great pleasure, Your Majesty.

473
00:56:03.041 --> 00:56:07.439
It must be said, Brian,
that Real Bronzio's manager has a disadvantage.

474
00:56:08.118 --> 00:56:12.651
A terrible start for him. Just awful.

475
00:56:12.685 --> 00:56:15.366
Nerves before the match.

476
00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:16.559
You're right, Brian.

477
00:56:16.682 --> 00:56:20.054
I took my Royal Commentators with me.

478
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:21,762
To sit.

479
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:23,640
Right.

480
00:56:24.271 --> 00:56:26.165
Let's start with the fun.

481
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,210
Bring out the Stone Age challengers.

482
00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:42.886
What? Where are you taking me?

483
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:45,289
What do you want to say?

484
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:56,318
Dug, right.

485
00:57:10.041 --> 00:57:14.120
Who challenges the champions?

486
00:57:16.006 --> 00:57:19.816
You leave my people alone, as agreed?

487
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,377
Yes, just say the words.

488
00:57:23,963 --> 00:57:25,602
Not me.

489
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:31,702
I give up and offer myself voluntarily
for the mines.

490
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:35,097
And?

491
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:37,990
And our valley ...

492
00:57:38,427 --> 00:57:39,654
is yours.

493
00:57:39.688 --> 00:57:43.006
Dear heaven. Are cavemen crawling in their den?

494
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:45,933
Apparently.

495
00:57:45.966 --> 00:57:48.469
How disappointing.

496
00:57:49.034 --> 00:57:51.802
Everyone home.

497
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,316
There is no contest.

498
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:56,740
Sorry for the inconvenience.

499
00:57:57,192 --> 00:57:59,342
Tell the staff: no refunds.

500
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:01,265
Wrong.

501
00:58:01,457 --> 00:58:04,989
Wrong? Nobody plays.

502
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,062
No, this goes wrong.

503
00:58:23,928 --> 00:58:28,267
Bryan, the Stone Age team
seems to have flown in.

504
00:58:29.149 --> 00:58:32.789
Indeed, Brian.
They look absolutely good in the air.

505
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:34,887
Do you understand?

506
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:39,544
Well done. There appears to be a competition.

507
00:59:04,098 --> 00:59:05,999
Did you start without us, Dug?

508
00:59:06,032 --> 00:59:08,490
Chief, we can not play this match.

509
00:59:08.524 --> 00:59:10.667
Because of a few paintings?

510
00:59:11.075 --> 00:59:13.955
So you know about those awful drawings?

511
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:17,369
They are terrible. I can even paint better.

512
00:59:17,402 --> 00:59:19,323
But they are not anymore.

513
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:21,143
Paintings.

514
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,979
They count.

515
00:59:25,013 --> 00:59:26,910
You were right, Dug.

516
00:59:26,944 --> 00:59:29,504
I thought we were just rabbit hunters.

517
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:33,105
Well, no more. You let me see that.

518
00:59:33,658 --> 00:59:35,839
Who is playing with Dug?

519
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:37,292
For the valley?

520
00:59:37,927 --> 00:59:39,778
Champion.

521
00:59:40.853 --> 00:59:43.220
That would have wanted Mr. Rock.

522
00:59:52.054 --> 00:59:55.216
We challenge the champions.

523
00:59:57,615 --> 1:00:00,411
Your funeral, caveman.

524
01:00:04,631 --> 01:00:07,274
This can be an odd match ...

525
01:00:07.393 --> 01:00:09.780
but hopefully it is entertaining.

526
01:00:10.391 --> 01:00:12.407
Let's deal with this.

527
01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.632
What?

528
01:00:20,398 --> 01:00:22,431
We're going for it.

529
01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:24.275
This is interesting.

530
1:00:25,481 --> 1:00:27,567
Hόgelgraber.

531
01:00:27,601 --> 01:00:28,957
Waking.

532
01:00:30.318 --> 01:00:32.563
Very interesting.

533
01:00:42.233 --> 01:00:43.672
THE BRUTEN

534
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:46,459
Unbelievable, Bryan.

535
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:50,872
The Stone Age team
has teased the napping opponents.

536
01:00:53.148 --> 01:00:55.900
Beginner's happiness, Your Majesty.

537
1:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,029
Bad move, caveman.

538
01:01:01.062 --> 01:01:03.174
Now you have made us angry.

539
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,156
And it's right again.

540
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:14.645
Jurgend.

541
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:16,733
Let's take a look again.

542
01:01:19,339 --> 01:01:20,664
Stairs.

543
01:01:20,697 --> 01:01:21,971
Goal.

544
01:01:22.005 --> 01:01:25.731
The dolls are right.
- Kiss Kiss. Hug.

545
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,985
The dolls do not lie, Brian.

546
01:01:31.235 --> 01:01:34.517
And that's a goal. Number two.

547
01:01:34.597 --> 01:01:37.68
Real Bronzio does not intend
to accept it.

548
01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:39.843
Never mind. Come on, everybody.

549
01:01:48.043 --> 01:01:52.064
And so the match seems to be played.

550
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:03.567
It's a break, Bryan,
and Real Bronzio dominates this game.

551
01:02:03,663 --> 01:02:04,718
<i> you go to the mine </ i>

552
01:02:08,013 --> 01:02:11,352
We're just going back to the valley.

553
01:02:11,385 --> 01:02:13,072
Come on, everybody.

554
01:02:13,134 --> 01:02:15,493
Show them what we can do.

555
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,426
Think about your training, Eemak.

556
01:02:40.588 --> 01:02:42.886
Good, Eemak. That's how you do it.

557
01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.671
Gosh, it seems
a counterattack by the cavemen.

558
01:02:45.90 --> 01:02:48.214
Let's see you tackle.

559
01:02:51,273 --> 01:02:52,842
Great, Magma.

560
01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:57.635
What was that?

561
01:02:58.04 --> 01:03:00.786
Unorthodox, Bryan, but effective.

562
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:04,719
This is unheard of.

563
01:03:04,839 --> 01:03:09,498
I can not remember a team
who scored two goals against Real Bronzio.

564
01:03:11.523 --> 01:03:15,319
Idiot. What are you thinking? Dumb ...

565
01:03:15.352 --> 01:03:17.805
Idiot. Do I have to do everything?

566
01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:19.698
A caveman comes along.

567
01:03:20,728 --> 01:03:22,891
Snack, Your Majesty?

568
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:24,570
Get rid of your snacks.

569
01:03:24,689 --> 01:03:28,686
Real Bronzio does not know what happens to them.

570
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:38,433
The Stone Age team
starts to play well together.

571
01:03:38,466 --> 01:03:42,376
You do not miss it, Brian.
It is just Early Man United.

572
01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:44.158
That's a joke, Brian.

573
01:03:44.541 --> 01:03:48.467
Look at that.
The Stone Age attacker evades one ...

574
01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:50.475
plays another by the legs ...

575
01:03:51.825 --> 01:03:53.719
Go for it, Goona.

576
01:03:56.007 --> 01:03:57.265
She's going for it.

577
01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:01.090
She shoots.

578
01:04:01,828 --> 01:04:04,000
She scores.

579
01:04:05,249 --> 01:04:07,718
The audience goes through the roof.

580
01:04:07,752 --> 01:04:09,341
And who can blame them?

581
01:04:11.672 --> 01:04:15.120
Wait a minute.
She should not even stand on the field.

582
01:04:15.153 --> 01:04:16.435
And why not?

583
01:04:16.554 --> 01:04:19.069
She is a girl ...

584
01:04:20,677 --> 01:04:22,356
A great player.

585
01:04:23.316 --> 01:04:26.581
Re-pack your ...

586
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:30,404
unless you are for the rest of the season
want to be suspended.

587
01:04:30,438 --> 01:04:32,283
Continue playing.

588
01:04:37.966 --> 01:04:40.283
Dino.

589
01:04:41.845 --> 01:04:45.74
Do you have your rule book at hand?
- Of course.

590
01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:47.609
Well done.

591
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:49,650
Because I throw it at you.

592
01:04:53.452 --> 01:04:55.284
Come on, everybody.

593
01:04:55,318 --> 01:04:58,316
One more goal and we are going home.

594
01:04:59.176 --> 01:05:01.297
Dino had to lie down for a moment.

595
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,521
I am the new referee.

596
01:05:04.298 --> 01:05:06.097
That's not fair.

597
01:05:06.131 --> 01:05:08.833
No? We ask the new referee.

598
01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:10.553
Scheids, is it fair?

599
01:05:10.783 --> 01:05:12.634
Yes, completely honest.

600
01:05:12.704 --> 01:05:14.690
Good, continue playing.

601
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:17,197
It is stoppage time.

602
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:18,837
Understood?

603
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:28.432
That's not cricket, Bryan.

604
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:32.325
What cricket may be.
- Nothing happened. Continue playing.

605
01:05:34.152 --> 01:05:36.966
No.
- Nothing seen. No mistake.

606
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,543
Continue playing.

607
01:05:40,662 --> 01:05:43,041
No no. Rise. Continue playing.

608
01:05:44,346 --> 01:05:46,922
That is heavy under the belt.

609
01:05:58,645 --> 01:05:59,967
Chief.

610
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:02,153
Caveman down, Bryan.

611
01:06:11.503 --> 01:06:16.076
My leg. My leg is such a pain.

612
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:18,415
Penalty kick.

613
01:06:18.534 --> 01:06:20.901
Jurgend should get an Oscar.

614
01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.916
Chief?

615
01:06:23,944 --> 01:06:27,451
I am recovering quickly.
- Awesome.

616
01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:31,304
So. Good job.

617
01:06:31,501 --> 01:06:35,937
Come on, that was never a penalty.
- View the repetition.

618
01:06:36.033 --> 01:06:37.262
And stairs.

619
01:06:37.513 --> 01:06:38.647
Referee.

620
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,759
My leg.

621
01:06:40.906 --> 01:06:42.780
No, the crocodile.

622
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:46,949
Terrible mistake.

623
01:06:47,068 --> 01:06:48,856
Beat him with sausages.

624
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:51,427
Scandalous. Definitely a penalty kick.

625
01:06:54,391 --> 01:06:58,836
A draw is not good enough
for the primitive part-timers, Bryan.

626
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,171
And now this.

627
01:07:00,205 --> 01:07:05,087
A Real Bronzio penalty kick
in the final minutes of the game.

628
01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.118
And the keeper looks bad too.

629
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:13,424
Dug?

630
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:14,807
Chief?

631
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:19,354
I have hunted rabbits all my life.

632
01:07:20,988 --> 01:07:22,596
I stood in the way of your development.

633
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:27,384
Sorry.

634
01:07:32,932 --> 01:07:34,596
Chief?

635
01:07:49,617 --> 01:07:52,128
Dug, I do not want to worry you ...

636
01:07:52.162 --> 01:07:54.540
but how do we get to a goalkeeper?

637
01:08:06.145 --> 01:08:07.780
Hognob?

638
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:18,382
Is that a pig in the target?

639
01:08:20,422 --> 01:08:24,636
A re-spec tabled decision.
Do you understand? Bacon.

640
01:08:24,755 --> 01:08:27,388
I have never missed a penalty.

641
01:08:27,422 --> 01:08:29,039
At least not against a pig.

642
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,011
And it all seems over
for this brave team, Bryan.

643
01:08:36.044 --> 01:08:37.581
A great attempt ...

644
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,339
but it was not enough in the end.

645
01:08:46,646 --> 01:08:49,648
Say goodbye to your valley, caveman.

646
01:08:50.607 --> 01:08:53.825
Come on, Hognob. You can do it.

647
01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:19.007
A pig's leg against it.

648
01:09:21.185 --> 01:09:23.143
The ball is not finished yet.

649
01:09:24.002 --> 01:09:25,438
My ball.

650
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:29,268
Dug.

651
01:09:29,387 --> 01:09:32,537
You were always a mammoth hunter.

652
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:35,193
Dug, here.

653
01:09:35,312 --> 01:09:37,958
Go hunting for mammoths.

654
01:09:39,434 --> 01:09:42,094
Give me a hand, everyone.

655
01:09:42,128 --> 01:09:44,867
My ball.

656
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:54,478
Do not stand around me.

657
01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.650
That is an excellent goal.

658
01:10:22.175 --> 01:10:23.493
Look at that.

659
01:10:23.615 --> 01:10:28.291
The giant duck is on the field.
He thinks it's over.

660
01:10:33.516 --> 01:10:36.259
Now it is.

661
01:10:41.618 --> 01:10:43.766
Does this feel just as good as you imagined it?

662
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,027
No.

663
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:48.146
It's better.

664
01:10:54,469 --> 01:10:57,359
Well done, old, fat friend.

665
01:10:57,392 --> 01:11:01,231
False player. A shame for the football.

666
01:11:11.516 --> 01:11:13.959
Good game.

667
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,200
Yes.

668
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,442
Well played, caveman.

669
01:11:23.764 --> 01:11:28.571
You reminded us
how the beautiful game should be played.

670
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:32,392
And for Lord Nooth ...

671
01:11:33,049 --> 01:11:34,379
Nooth?

672
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:37,852
Where is it...
- Rat.

673
01:11:37,972 --> 01:11:39,051
Yes quite.

674
01:11:42,493 --> 01:11:44,295
Guards.

675
01:11:44,414 --> 01:11:47,464
Arrest that rodent.

676
01:11:48.013 --> 1:11:49.735
Bye, losers.

677
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,781
That villain flees with the profits.

678
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:58,257
After you.
- Yes, but can he escape?

679
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:01,941
Super shot.
- And again.

680
01:12:03.504 --> 01:12:04.822
Got you.

681
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:07,207
What a decline for Nooth, Brian.

682
01:12:07,687 --> 01:12:09,269
Literally.

683
01:12:14,108 --> 01:12:16,292
Caught by that strange bird.

684
01:12:16,325 --> 01:12:19,694
Bryan, that's bronze for comedy.
Well done, friend.

685
01:12:27,915 --> 1:12:30,435
No, my dear schnookels.

686
01:12:38,206 --> 01:12:40,026
Refund.

687
01:12:40.581 --> 01:12:44,000
That should remind him of the pecking order.

688
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:46,957
And, caveman ...

689
01:12:47.079 --> 1:12:50.513
I think this is yours.

690
01:12:59,226 --> 01:13:03,066
Symbol of a match,
sent from heaven.

691
01:13:03.099 --> 01:13:07.173
Thank you, Your Bronze Chief.

692
01:13:07.578 --> 01:13:11.794
And now it's time that you go home.

693
01:13:14,614 --> 01:13:17,148
To your valley.

694
01:13:22,087 --> 01:13:24,116
We are going home.

695
01:13:35,235 --> 01:13:37,287
We did it.
