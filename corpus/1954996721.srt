"Dear Vicky,

"I've learned more

"surrounding the death
of my brothers

"at the hands of tong po.

"Tong po...

00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:43,504
"The same man that had me framed

00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:48,174
"It started with my brothers
Eric and Kurt.

10
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:50,809
Eric went to Thailand
to fight their champion."

11
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:52,210
Reporter: How do you feel

12
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:55,046
about fighting
our champ tong po?

13
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:56,180
Piece of cake.

14
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:58,315
Reporter: Think so?

15
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:03,452
That's the way they fight here,

16
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:05,287
I told you!

17
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:06,821
Motherfucker wants
a street fight?

18
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:08,088
I'll show him.

19
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,289
Let's cancel.

20
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,290
No.

21
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:11,324
Let's cancel, please!

22
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:12,458
No!

23
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:21,599
David: "He permanently
crippled Eric by cheating."

24
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:27,337
No!

25
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:29,205
"Kurt wouldn't take Eric
back to the U.S.

26
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:31,173
"Until he avenged the defeat.

27
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,275
"To prepare
for his battle with po,

28
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:35,310
Kurt studied with
the legendary Xian."

29
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,712
Xian: You must learn
to be faster

30
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:39,313
than any punch or kick.

31
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:42,782
David:
"After months of training,

32
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:44,650
Kurt was ready
to face tong po."

33
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:51,255
I'm a better fighter
than I ever was before.

34
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,091
I'll win that fight

35
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:56,625
for you and me.

36
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,761
Yeah!

37
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:10,403
"Kurt won his fight."

38
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:13,371
"He avenged our brother
and dishonored po."

39
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,508
"Disgraced by his loss,

40
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,343
"tong po tracked
my brothers down

41
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:21,645
"and shot them to death
in an ambush.

42
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,381
"But killing my brothers
was not enough.

43
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:26,383
"Po traveled to America
to force me to fight him

44
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:28,618
so he might regain
his honor."

45
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,153
The most dangerous weapon
in the universe

46
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:33,155
is a focused mind.

47
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:34,456
"Having quit fighting to teach,"

48
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,291
"I wanted no part of this war."

49
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:40,161
David Sloan will give
tong po the rematch

50
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:41,695
that his brother's
death denied us.

51
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:46,433
"His men set fire to my gym,
killing a young boy."

52
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:49,169
David!

53
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,271
"Now I had no choice
but to face the enemy."

54
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,313
This is my fight.

55
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,883
It's just something
I got to do now.

56
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:12,588
David:
"After winning that fight,

57
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,358
"I thought I'd seen
the last of tong po.

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,160
"Then you and I met,
started our school,

59
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:21,529
"and everything
was wonderful, Vicky...

60
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:23,898
"Until my arrest.

61
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,566
"But even that isn't enough.

62
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,467
"I've heard tong po's men,

63
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:30,169
"the same ones that framed me,
may be after you.

64
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,336
"You must hide and remain safe

65
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:33,538
"until my release.

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,340
I love you, Vicky.
David."

67
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:30,458
Man: Get out of the car.
Come on!

68
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,659
Vicky: I can walk!

69
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:33,861
You'll walk when
I tell you to walk.

70
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:47,506
Come on!
You see this?

71
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:48,740
This is home.
Ha ha!

72
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:50,374
Let's go.
Let's go pronto!

73
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,409
Come on, baby.

74
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:53,576
Asshole!

75
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:54,777
Both of you shut the fuck up.

76
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,381
You think you're tough,
you got a big boyfriend.

77
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,549
Get down!

78
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:03,716
Take the cuffs off.

79
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:04,717
You sure, amigo?

80
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,819
Just do it.

81
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:09,321
Hey, you the boss-man.

82
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:20,964
Come on, baby.
Like that, right?

83
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,433
No boyfriend's gonna
save 'em now, huh?

84
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,435
Aah!

85
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:26,437
Uhh!

86
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:34,809
Let me tell you something!
Listen to me, huh?!

87
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,777
Only men got balls,
you stupid bitch!

88
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,859
Hello, Mrs. Sloan.

89
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:08,637
I hope that you had
a pleasant trip

90
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,704
crossing the border.

91
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:11,005
Vicky: Who are you?

92
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:12,439
Why have you brought me here?

93
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,074
Maybe...

94
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:16,909
You've heard of me.

95
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,477
Tong po.

96
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,378
I've heard of you.

97
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,912
You're the pig
that framed my husband.

98
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,314
I am afraid so.

99
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:25,948
However, I thought
I'd make it up to him

100
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,483
by taking care
of his little wife.

101
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:30,785
Go, po.

102
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,624
No! No!

103
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,961
Aah!

104
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:45,630
Aah!

105
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:02,011
Guard:
Sloan, Jackson,

106
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:04,613
Martinez!
Mail call.

107
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:07,515
Sloan.
Martinez.

108
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:50,613
Step back.

109
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,084
Place your hands
behind your back.

110
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,135
He's all yours.

111
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:22,174
It's been a long time, Sloan.

112
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:23,842
Every time one of you assholes

113
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:25,143
from the DEA shows up,

114
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:27,678
my life takes a bad turn.

115
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,147
I don't blame you
for being bitter.

116
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,248
I get busted trying to bring

117
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,083
a major dealer
to the U.S. for trial...

118
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:35,218
You weren't supposed
to kill him.

119
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,155
Hey, it was him or me.
Tong po saw to that.

120
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:40,556
That's not how the court saw it.

121
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:42,257
He's got my wife, Casey.

122
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,058
It's been 2 years.

123
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,626
She's probably dead.

124
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,794
Maybe you can do
something about it.

125
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,796
In the last 5 years,
tong po has become

126
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,964
the most powerful
drug lord in Mexico.

127
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,266
He's got a damn fortress
in the desert.

128
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:57,102
The DEA has been
trying to take him out

129
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:58,770
the last 3 years,
and has come up empty.

130
00:09:58,772 --> 00:09:59,871
We can't get close,

131
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:00,905
but you might.

132
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,873
Yeah.

133
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,507
Every day of the dead,
tong po invites

134
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,742
all the top fighters
from around the world

135
00:10:06,744 --> 00:10:09,111
to compete at his compound.

136
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:12,614
The winner takes on po
for a million bucks.

137
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:14,015
So the agency needs me again

138
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:15,683
and just like that,
I'm out of here.

139
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,885
It's all been arranged.

140
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:20,087
Po's men in here
will be made to think

141
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:22,122
that you're in solitary again.

142
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:23,923
You'll compete
in the tournament...

143
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:25,925
If you qualify, that is...

144
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:27,293
Under an assumed identity.

145
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,194
Remember...

146
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,629
If po recognizes you,

147
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,098
you're dead.

148
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,032
It's been a lot of hard years

149
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,267
since tong po's seen me.

150
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,269
Casey: Remember,

151
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,938
we know you want
to rescue your wife.

152
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,272
We think that's fine.

153
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,708
The prime mission here
is the elimination of po.

154
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,076
David:
I'll kill him.

155
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:26,847
Casey, reading:
"There's a street fight

156
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:28,915
"at 3rd and Santa fe.

157
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,917
"Brubaker has to invite you
to po's tournament.

158
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,886
P.S. Good luck
saving Vicky."

159
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,340
Biker: Hit him!
Come on!

160
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:32,141
Hit him! Get him!

161
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:47,989
You're the man!

162
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:49,223
Come on!

163
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:21,787
I'm coming for you!

164
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,522
For you! Come on!

165
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,109
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

166
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:47,578
Can't take your girlfriend
anywhere, can you?

167
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,980
Maybe I make you
my girlfriend, huh?

168
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:00,422
You're the man!

169
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,924
Come on!

170
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:06,059
Yeah!

171
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:07,527
Hit him! Go!

172
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,964
All right!
All right!

173
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:48,333
Uhh!

174
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:55,505
Brubaker:
Hell of a fight, Jack.

175
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:58,941
Practically had him
sucking eggs in there.

176
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:01,877
I ain't never seen anybody
fight like that before.

177
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:08,882
5 centuries ain't gonna get you

178
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:10,383
far in this life.

179
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,988
You in the mood for
some serious action?

180
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,656
Depends on
your definition of serious.

181
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:19,957
What are you, some kind

182
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,059
of intellectual or something?

183
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:22,993
I'll tell you what, Jack.

184
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:24,361
Why don't I make a call,

185
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:26,563
see if I can get you
into a heavier grind

186
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:29,332
with some serious client?

187
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,000
Do it.

188
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:32,001
You'll probably have
to go to Mexico

189
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:33,402
for the score.

190
00:15:33,404 --> 00:15:34,903
Is that a problem, Jack?

191
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:36,604
Only for the federales.

192
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,305
Good.

193
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:39,339
You make it down to calixico

194
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:41,641
by tomorrow night?

195
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,042
For what?

196
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:46,145
Big tournament,
but you got to qualify.

197
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:47,613
They like you,
they pay my commission.

198
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,348
So do me a favor, Jack, huh?

199
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,582
Kick some
royal ass, o.K.?

200
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:57,320
Jack. Jack!

201
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:59,989
Don't you want to know
what the payday is?

202
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:02,191
Doesn't matter.

203
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:03,592
A cool million.

204
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:05,961
That sound good to you?

205
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,429
Yeah, it doesn't sound bad.

206
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:11,199
But I'm warning you,
some don't make it back.

207
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:14,569
Ah... That's too bad
for them.

208
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:20,941
Strange motherfucker.

209
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:23,976
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,577
I'm sending you a new guy.

211
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:27,045
Yeah, some bastard

212
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:28,679
who fights like the devil.

213
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:30,614
His name's Jack Jones.

214
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,949
And, listen...

215
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,550
Don't piss him off.

216
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:21,127
What's up, blondie?

217
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:23,295
You're looking
pretty good, baby.

218
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:25,764
Looking real good.

219
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:27,198
Don't piss me off.

220
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,399
Oh, yeah?

221
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:32,136
Uhh!

222
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:33,537
Oh, man.

223
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:35,205
Hey, look.

224
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:37,240
Uhh. Bitch!

225
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:47,549
You got a problem with this?

226
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:50,018
First of all, you see this?

227
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:02,129
Aah!

228
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,800
Aah!

229
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:47,139
Aah!

230
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:20,497
Ah! Aah!

231
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,277
You know, you should
be more careful...

232
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,278
Fuck you.

233
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Keep your opinions to yourself.

234
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:42,817
You know, a simple
thank you would do.

235
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:45,352
Yeah, o.K.
Thank you, asshole.

236
00:20:56,896 --> 00:20:58,730
You're going to Mexico
for that competition,

237
00:20:58,732 --> 00:20:59,732
aren't you?

238
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:04,935
When we meet, let's just assume

239
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:06,436
we never met each other.

240
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:07,637
Jesus.

241
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:09,705
You had to have
the last word, didn't you?

242
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:13,026
Si?

243
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:15,661
Guard: Jack Jones
esta aqui.

244
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:17,329
Bueno.
Gracias, Mateo.

245
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,846
Mr. Jones, we've been
expecting you.

246
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,514
I'm Darcy.

247
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,915
This way.

248
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:44,486
You're one of the last
fighters to arrive.

249
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:45,720
I just found out
about the tournament

250
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:47,722
a few days ago.

251
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:48,923
You almost missed

252
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:50,758
the final qualifying matches.

253
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,061
Oh?
I thought I was in.

254
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,129
A lot of people want
to get into the tournament.

255
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:57,463
We only want the very best.

256
00:23:57,465 --> 00:23:58,664
Yeah.

257
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,899
You're lucky to have
gotten this far.

258
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:02,901
Impress the man up there,

259
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:04,102
or it's a long trip for nothing.

260
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:06,104
I'm in charge of hospitality.

261
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:07,138
So if there's anything you need,

262
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,572
just ask me.

263
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:10,874
Oh, I'm sure I'll be fine.

264
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:12,075
Some of the world's
most dangerous men

265
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,609
are here.

266
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:15,444
Brubaker was
very taken with you.

267
00:24:15,446 --> 00:24:17,979
He said you're a hard man.

268
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:21,082
Just how hard
are you, Mr. Jones?

269
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,918
Um... Hard enough.

270
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:37,663
Go on. Get him
out of here.

271
00:24:37,665 --> 00:24:39,097
Good luck,
Mr. Jones.

272
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:46,470
Looks like you just made it
in time to qualify.

273
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:48,972
Better strip down, pretty boy.

274
00:24:48,974 --> 00:24:50,406
Ok, next!

275
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:51,740
Rodriguez and Thomas.

276
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,908
Let's go, center of the ring.

277
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,043
Any style, everything is legal!

278
00:24:58,479 --> 00:24:59,545
Which means there are no rules,

279
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,812
so let's fight!

280
00:25:47,692 --> 00:25:49,059
Ah!

281
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,560
Hey...

282
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:54,463
Don't you think that's enough?

283
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:10,478
That...

284
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,580
Is enough.

285
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:20,220
Get him out of here.

286
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,622
Excellent, Thomas.

287
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,191
O.K., next.

288
00:26:25,193 --> 00:26:28,627
You...

289
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,028
And you.

290
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:01,891
What, you need q-tips
in your ears, boy?

291
00:27:01,893 --> 00:27:03,926
You gonna fight or what?

292
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:05,060
Ya!

293
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,997
Ahh.

294
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:16,316
Are you in or out of this thing?

295
00:27:20,574 --> 00:27:22,274
Look, don't fight it.
I'll put you out easy.

296
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:23,975
Yeah?

297
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:24,775
What makes you think I'd let you

298
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,977
put me out at all?

299
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,312
You don't want to be
involved in this.

300
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,081
Man: Should I order
some Chinese food

301
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,816
or something?

302
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,717
No!
You're right.

303
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,718
I wouldn't want a chance

304
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,653
at winning $1 million.

305
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,688
Eat me, motherfucker.

306
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,189
How lovely.

307
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Maybe you need to train her,

308
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:47,394
pretty boy.

309
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:51,030
I'm not gonna fight her.

310
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:53,965
I'll destroy her short life.

311
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,235
Hard head, huh?

312
00:27:58,237 --> 00:28:00,904
Look, I'm giving you
a break, ok?

313
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:02,839
You ain't nothing,
shit-for-brains.

314
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:14,115
A pathetic way
for things to end.

315
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:19,119
Your next fight
won't be so easy!

316
00:28:29,296 --> 00:28:31,330
Get this little mouse
out of here.

317
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:59,150
I don't like being followed.

318
00:29:59,152 --> 00:30:01,285
8191 mannix Avenue.

319
00:30:01,287 --> 00:30:02,452
Sound familiar?

320
00:30:02,454 --> 00:30:03,519
Maybe.

321
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,087
Your house...

322
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:06,822
And your dojo.

323
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:08,290
Am I right, sensei Sloan?

324
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,858
I don't remember you.

325
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,092
How about my brother Andrew?

326
00:30:11,094 --> 00:30:12,159
You saved his life.

327
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:14,127
You got him out
of red ball pirus,

328
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:15,795
and you made him an instructor.

329
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:20,432
You're Andrew Smith's
punk kid brother?

330
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:22,567
Yeah.

331
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:25,336
I don't remember there
being much hope for you.

332
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:28,005
Andrew straightened my ass out.

333
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:29,072
Said you got fucked over

334
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:31,874
and ended up doing some time.

335
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:34,810
That's history.

336
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:37,846
Wait'll everybody finds out
that sensei Sloan is here.

337
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:39,080
There'll be the sound
of 100 bricks

338
00:30:39,082 --> 00:30:41,115
shitting at the same time.

339
00:30:41,117 --> 00:30:43,517
You can't tell anyone who I am.

340
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,452
Anything you say.

341
00:30:45,454 --> 00:30:48,855
You need anything,
sensei, just ask.

342
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:50,923
My wife's being held here.

343
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:52,257
Come on!
Let's move it, guys!

344
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:54,058
By tong po?

345
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,325
We'll talk later.

346
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:21,550
That guy's a lowlife
sicko scumbag.

347
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:22,918
You see all kinds here.

348
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,053
Yeah, I bet.

349
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:26,521
So, what do you do here?

350
00:31:26,523 --> 00:31:28,122
A lot of things,

351
00:31:28,124 --> 00:31:29,923
but not what you seem
to be thinking.

352
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:32,992
I'm very particular
about who I sleep with.

353
00:31:32,994 --> 00:31:36,528
Well, they must do something
for sex around here.

354
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,530
Is that where
they keep the women?

355
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:40,298
You don't need
to worry about that.

356
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,332
I'm sure you have no problem

357
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:42,966
getting your own girls.

358
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,901
Hey...

359
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,136
What's gonna happen
to that young girl?

360
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,537
Is tong po gonna send her home?

361
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,171
The punk?
Yeah.

362
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,639
I wouldn't count on it.

363
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:54,375
Tong po has a particular
fetish for young girls.

364
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:56,110
And that's all right with you?

365
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:58,078
I didn't say that.

366
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,580
What happens
when they get older?

367
00:32:00,582 --> 00:32:02,214
They become me.

368
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:06,017
Get cleaned up.
The party starts soon.

369
00:32:25,036 --> 00:32:27,937
The rain in Spain

370
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:31,273
falls mainly on the plain.

371
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:34,409
The rain in Spain

372
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,645
falls mainly on the plain.

373
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:41,347
The fighters are being called in

374
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:43,048
for the celebration.

375
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:33,594
May I have
your attention, please?

376
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:38,231
Shut the fucking music off.

377
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:42,301
Welcome to the sian memorial
tournament of champions,

378
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:45,037
the greatest competition
of its kind in the world.

379
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,039
My name is bill.

380
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,341
If you have any needs
to be taken care of...

381
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:53,244
Food, beverages, sunblock,
extra pillows,

382
00:33:53,246 --> 00:33:54,345
pussy...

383
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,280
That goes for you, too, girls...

384
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:59,415
Don't hesitate to call on me,

385
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:02,050
bill, your humble
fucking servant.

386
00:34:02,052 --> 00:34:04,385
Now let me introduce our host.

387
00:34:04,387 --> 00:34:06,353
A great humanitarian,

388
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:09,389
board-certified
psychotherapist,

389
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:12,392
a visionary record producer,

390
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:15,995
3-time national
thai champion,

391
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:18,230
6-time sian
memorial tournament

392
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:20,065
of champions champion,

393
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:22,233
tong po!

394
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:34,244
I would like to make a toast

395
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:38,381
to all the wonderful men
and women here today.

396
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:43,585
It is an honor to have
such a distinguished group

397
00:34:43,587 --> 00:34:46,387
participating this year.

398
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,555
As you know,

399
00:34:48,557 --> 00:34:52,025
the lucky winner will receive...

400
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:54,027
$1 million!

401
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:58,430
Yeah! All right!

402
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,431
Yeah!

403
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,433
Yeah!
Yeah!

404
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:04,436
All right!
Yeah! Yeah!

405
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:07,605
Enjoy today's festivities,

406
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:10,641
for tomorrow at 7 A.M.,

407
00:35:10,643 --> 00:35:12,809
the competition begins!

408
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:44,604
Hi.

409
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:47,139
How are you gonna compete
in the tournament?

410
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:49,808
Won't tong po recognize you?

411
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,277
I'll find Vicky tonight
and get this thing over with.

412
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:55,813
How long has po had her?

413
00:35:57,215 --> 00:35:59,115
2 years.

414
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:03,185
Last time I saw her was
at that birthday party

415
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:05,420
you had for her
at the dojo, remember?

416
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:08,589
We had a great time, man.

417
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:10,457
Boy, I got wasted.

418
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,193
Yeah, you sure did.

419
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:24,803
So, Mr. Jones,
see anybody you like?

420
00:36:24,805 --> 00:36:27,305
Nobody here's our type.

421
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:30,207
I certainly hope
you don't mean nobody.

422
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:34,110
I've had enough of this.
I'm going up to my room.

423
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,857
Silence, please.

424
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:50,892
A fighter who was eliminated

425
00:36:50,894 --> 00:36:54,862
has requested
a second chance to compete.

426
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:58,131
I have decided to allow her
an opportunity

427
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,266
to prove her worthiness
before us all.

428
00:37:19,483 --> 00:37:21,517
She may look sweet, gentlemen,

429
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,185
but I assure you,

430
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:26,621
inside there is an iron tigress.

431
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:28,556
Who among you will risk

432
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:29,823
his or her place
in the tournament

433
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:32,559
to fight miss Laurence?

434
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:37,530
A $25,000 bonus
to whomever defeats her!

435
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:39,198
Bastard.

436
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,332
She'll be killed.

437
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:43,601
Who would like to take her on?

438
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:44,668
I'll take her on!

439
00:37:50,307 --> 00:37:51,573
Bill: Bitch!

440
00:37:59,648 --> 00:38:01,915
Who was gonna get killed?

441
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:13,392
Maybe we should forget about
the tournament bullshit

442
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:16,762
and go for the million
right now.

443
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:17,929
Bitch.

444
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:30,607
Much too pretty a face
to be punched out.

445
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:31,941
Don't be stupid, boy.

446
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:35,711
Now go back and enjoy yourself

447
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,345
while I take care of this...

448
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:39,913
Little distraction.

449
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:43,316
No.

450
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:56,827
Take them.

451
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:02,665
You heard Mr. po.

452
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,333
Get that little bitch!

453
00:39:27,957 --> 00:39:30,391
Well, well, well...

454
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:32,393
It's exciting to have
such a talent

455
00:39:32,395 --> 00:39:34,561
in our humble tournament.

456
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:35,828
Fight me now.

457
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,363
You win the tournament,
you get me.

458
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:43,000
If you wanted her
all to yourself,

459
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:45,535
why didn't you just say so?

460
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,047
Well...

461
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:01,549
Enjoy the rest of the party.

462
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:09,155
I guess I should thank you.

463
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,858
I just got tired
of listening to his shit.

464
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,760
Come on,
let's get you cleaned up.

465
00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:13,916
What are you gonna do
with a million bucks

466
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:15,183
if you win?

467
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,221
I don't know.

468
00:41:20,223 --> 00:41:23,057
Retire, I guess.

469
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:25,025
From what?

470
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:27,527
From what?

471
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:28,895
Yeah, from what?

472
00:41:28,897 --> 00:41:30,897
You know, like a job?

473
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:32,999
Well...

474
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:35,501
Right now, I'm unemployed.

475
00:41:36,804 --> 00:41:39,070
I thought you just said
you'd retire.

476
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,505
Yeah, well, I'd retire
from unemployment.

477
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:44,641
Ok.

478
00:41:44,643 --> 00:41:47,877
Here...

479
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:49,945
Keep this on your face.

480
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:53,681
It'll keep the swelling down.

481
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,051
You don't intend to go
through with this, do you?

482
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,986
I have to win.

483
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:03,254
You're gonna lose.

484
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,488
It's just another beating.

485
00:42:12,994 --> 00:42:15,061
It's a chance to make
something of myself.

486
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:26,071
Here, keep this on your face.

487
00:42:28,274 --> 00:42:29,874
I got to go.

488
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:28,661
Hello, lando.

489
00:43:28,663 --> 00:43:29,662
I thought you might
be lonely here

490
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:30,863
by yourself.

491
00:43:30,865 --> 00:43:32,331
What gave you that idea?

492
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:35,834
Let's call it woman's intuition.

493
00:43:35,836 --> 00:43:37,135
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

494
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:38,936
Uh, sure.

495
00:43:46,077 --> 00:43:47,944
I'm having a little
trouble with this.

496
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:49,078
Could you help me?

497
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:20,141
Darcy...

498
00:44:23,812 --> 00:44:26,613
Mmm, I knew...

499
00:44:26,615 --> 00:44:30,817
You'd have all I want and more.

500
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:32,752
I can't do this now.

501
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:35,054
What are you talking about?

502
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:36,655
I can't explain.

503
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:38,156
The tournament?

504
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:41,192
That sex-before-the-fight
stuff's just a myth.

505
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:46,296
Look...

506
00:44:46,298 --> 00:44:48,064
I can't do this now.

507
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,371
Just leave...

508
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:56,373
Please?

509
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:01,074
You're a damn pussy tease.

510
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:07,647
Or maybe you really
don't like girls.

511
00:45:07,649 --> 00:45:09,949
Or maybe you just like
underage tramps.

512
00:45:09,951 --> 00:45:11,350
I'm sorry.

513
00:45:11,352 --> 00:45:13,018
Go to hell.

514
00:46:07,907 --> 00:46:09,774
No, I got nothing here.

515
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,112
Nothing, man.

516
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:19,315
So, uh...

517
00:46:46,107 --> 00:46:47,240
Ohh.

518
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:53,412
Woman: Mmm.

519
00:47:16,402 --> 00:47:18,336
Mmm!

520
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,368
Hey, don, o.K.?

521
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,002
All right.

522
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:40,081
Security break-in,
section 4.

523
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:44,285
Security break-in,
section 4.

524
00:48:48,955 --> 00:48:50,188
Guard: Let's go! Let's go!

525
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,559
Sian, because of me,
you are dead.

526
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:03,099
I shall not rest
until you are avenged.

527
00:49:09,272 --> 00:49:11,640
Excuse me, master.

528
00:49:11,642 --> 00:49:13,441
May I speak with you
for a moment?

529
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,477
Why do you interrupt my prayers?

530
00:49:19,446 --> 00:49:21,580
There's a trespasser
in the containment area.

531
00:49:25,317 --> 00:49:26,583
These two failed.

532
00:49:26,585 --> 00:49:28,318
Sound the alarm.

533
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,087
I want the intruder...
Alive.

534
00:49:36,225 --> 00:49:37,458
Uhh! Aah!

535
00:49:46,434 --> 00:49:47,567
Aah!

536
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:04,682
Uhh! Ooh!

537
00:50:39,214 --> 00:50:41,281
Look, I'm sorry
I choked you out.

538
00:50:41,283 --> 00:50:43,416
Yeah, you got lucky.

539
00:50:45,153 --> 00:50:46,418
You didn't belong
in the tournament.

540
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,953
I guess we'll see.

541
00:50:48,955 --> 00:50:50,587
What, they didn't throw you out?

542
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,488
They're giving me
a second chance.

543
00:50:54,558 --> 00:50:56,157
The tournament's wrong for you.

544
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:58,659
At least maybe I can help you.

545
00:50:58,661 --> 00:51:00,127
What's it to you?

546
00:51:00,129 --> 00:51:03,196
Do you want my help or not?

547
00:51:04,965 --> 00:51:08,167
Well, that move you did
on me was pretty good.

548
00:51:08,169 --> 00:51:11,170
Why don't you show me that one?

549
00:51:11,172 --> 00:51:13,572
I got a better one for you.

550
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:15,140
See, you're small,

551
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:17,742
so you got to use
the art of surprise.

552
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,443
When you face your opponent,

553
00:51:19,445 --> 00:51:23,513
make him focus on one
of your weapons... your legs.

554
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:25,014
Get him to start staring
at your feet.

555
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:27,082
Make him look at your feet.

556
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,218
Make him be focused
on your feet.

557
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,720
And then, when he's
looking down...

558
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:34,289
Pop up with a hook.

559
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,390
You try it.

560
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:42,889
Tong po: Last night,

561
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:45,691
someone took advantage
of my hospitality.

562
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:49,795
Please be warned.

563
00:52:52,198 --> 00:52:57,168
This compound
is private property.

564
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,205
You are guests here.

565
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:04,541
All trespassers will be
severely punished.

566
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,383
Now, the first day
of the tournament will begin!

567
00:53:13,385 --> 00:53:14,684
Bill on P.A.:
Vernon and Craig,

568
00:53:14,686 --> 00:53:16,252
enter the ring.

569
00:54:07,603 --> 00:54:10,304
Jackson, Wilson!
Center of the ring!

570
00:54:10,306 --> 00:54:11,672
Let's go!

571
00:54:26,987 --> 00:54:29,588
Vincent, Chang!

572
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,989
Enter the ring!

573
00:55:17,536 --> 00:55:18,636
Aah!

574
00:55:25,877 --> 00:55:29,079
Amin, carnowsky!
Center of the ring!

575
00:55:56,807 --> 00:55:59,575
Bill: Bannen, vargas!

576
00:55:59,577 --> 00:56:01,643
Center of the ring.

577
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:08,449
Ooh!

578
00:56:10,385 --> 00:56:11,918
Grab her!

579
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:18,924
Hold her, man!
Hold her down!

580
00:56:20,593 --> 00:56:23,528
Oh! Bitch! Ow!

581
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:45,582
Aah!

582
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,116
Ah!

583
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:05,692
Uhh!

584
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:06,859
Uhh... Uhh... Uhh!

585
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:13,865
Uhh!

586
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:28,878
Laurence... Black.

587
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:32,113
Center of the ring.

588
00:58:55,136 --> 00:58:56,769
Come on, beautiful.

589
00:59:00,774 --> 00:59:02,007
Man: All right, baby!

590
00:59:11,884 --> 00:59:14,150
Second man:
No way, no way!

591
00:59:14,152 --> 00:59:17,887
I got her, man.

592
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:19,989
Ooh!
You dead meat, baby!

593
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:22,658
Come on!
Come on!

594
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,626
Bring it on to me now!

595
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:26,928
You got rid of him.
I ain't nothin', huh?

596
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:27,929
Well, come on, show me then!

597
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:28,963
Show me what you got!

598
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,898
Come on, shorty!
Come on!

599
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,900
I'll kick your ass!
I'll kick your ass!

600
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,101
You hear what I said?

601
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,203
Come on...
Oh! Uhh!

602
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,604
Damn.

603
00:59:37,606 --> 00:59:38,605
Man: Oh, man.

604
00:59:38,607 --> 00:59:40,239
Second man:
Get up, coffee!

605
00:59:40,241 --> 00:59:41,940
Third man:
Get up, man!

606
00:59:46,845 --> 00:59:50,948
Smith, kid Wheeler.
Center of the ring.

607
01:00:26,183 --> 01:00:27,616
Aah!

608
01:00:32,054 --> 01:00:33,621
Aah! Aah!

609
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:51,637
Jones... Matthews.

610
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:53,038
Center of the ring.

611
01:01:21,767 --> 01:01:25,002
Darcy, you didn't
even smile at me?

612
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:27,903
You're not gonna talk to me?

613
01:01:27,905 --> 01:01:31,740
Darcy: There's
a tournament going on.

614
01:01:31,742 --> 01:01:33,174
Yeah, I know that.

615
01:01:36,011 --> 01:01:38,012
Hey, wait.
Where are you going?

616
01:02:10,944 --> 01:02:12,978
You did pretty good today.

617
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:17,882
Want to go dancing later on?

618
01:02:17,884 --> 01:02:19,783
Fuck you!

619
01:02:31,295 --> 01:02:34,897
I got to find a way in there.

620
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:37,332
I might know a way in.

621
01:02:40,335 --> 01:02:41,335
Hi.

622
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:43,970
Whoa.

623
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:45,771
Get the hell out of my doorway.

624
01:02:45,773 --> 01:02:47,239
Wait a minute, Darcy.

625
01:02:50,409 --> 01:02:52,943
I just came to make
a peace offering.

626
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:55,245
I wouldn't drink
champagne with you

627
01:02:55,247 --> 01:02:57,146
if you were
the last man on earth.

628
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,848
It's a good thing I'm not
the last man on earth.

629
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:01,216
You're wasting your time.

630
01:03:01,218 --> 01:03:03,184
You had your chance,
lando, and you blew it.

631
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:10,723
Fuck the champagne.

632
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:14,218
Darcy, I got to
ask you something.

633
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,287
Yes?

634
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:19,555
I need to know where
tong po keeps a woman

635
01:04:19,557 --> 01:04:22,257
and how to get to her.

636
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:24,859
You can't possibly be serious.

637
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,560
I'm not enough to satisfy you?

638
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,929
That's not it.

639
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,964
I need some help finding her.

640
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:32,465
She's been here 2 years.

641
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:35,968
Oh, my god.

642
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,236
You're here to free that woman.

643
01:04:38,238 --> 01:04:40,938
I need to know how to get
into that building.

644
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,205
It's guarded.

645
01:04:46,876 --> 01:04:48,443
Lando, I can't.
I'm sorry.

646
01:04:48,445 --> 01:04:49,477
She doesn't belong here.

647
01:04:49,479 --> 01:04:52,246
None of us do.

648
01:04:52,248 --> 01:04:54,014
She's my friend.

649
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:56,850
I have to save her.

650
01:04:56,852 --> 01:04:58,418
And who saves me?

651
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:04,456
Tong po will kill me
if he finds out.

652
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,324
What if I tell you

653
01:05:06,326 --> 01:05:07,992
I can get you out of here?

654
01:05:07,994 --> 01:05:12,229
Start you off with some money?

655
01:05:12,231 --> 01:05:15,098
Who are you, lando?

656
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,199
I'm just here to save a friend

657
01:05:16,201 --> 01:05:18,301
that needs me, that's it.

658
01:05:18,303 --> 01:05:22,271
I can offer you the same.

659
01:05:22,273 --> 01:05:25,040
You want to stay here?

660
01:05:25,042 --> 01:05:27,909
I mean, what's gonna happen
when you get older?

661
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:30,344
I don't see anybody
around here that age.

662
01:05:30,346 --> 01:05:32,279
I can leave here
whenever I want.

663
01:05:32,281 --> 01:05:33,980
Can you?

664
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:39,418
How can I trust you?

665
01:05:41,053 --> 01:05:42,920
Who else do you have?

666
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:30,631
Lando, you son of a bitch.

667
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,901
Thanks for the help.

668
01:06:34,903 --> 01:06:35,934
Good luck.

669
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,574
Uhh! Oh!

670
01:06:48,644 --> 01:06:51,245
You're mine.

671
01:07:00,954 --> 01:07:03,121
Lovely.
Just beautiful.

672
01:07:11,263 --> 01:07:13,397
You are surprised
to see I have...

673
01:07:13,399 --> 01:07:15,399
Music talent.

674
01:07:17,402 --> 01:07:18,969
Do you play an instrument,

675
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:20,103
my friend?

676
01:07:20,105 --> 01:07:22,638
I'd like to,

677
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,007
but I'm a little
tied up at the moment.

678
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:38,653
Once more,
Mr. DEA agent?

679
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:41,522
I'm Mr. Smith to you,

680
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:43,156
and I'm nobody's agent.

681
01:07:43,158 --> 01:07:46,759
What are you doing here?

682
01:07:46,761 --> 01:07:48,160
I'm doing an article
on your house

683
01:07:48,162 --> 01:07:50,162
for architectural digest.

684
01:07:50,164 --> 01:07:52,731
"The homes of the evil
and depraved."

685
01:07:52,733 --> 01:07:55,166
Aah! Aah!

686
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:59,268
Answer my questions!

687
01:08:02,605 --> 01:08:04,572
I said go fuck yourself!

688
01:08:11,813 --> 01:08:13,513
Oh, great.

689
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:55,211
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

690
01:09:55,213 --> 01:10:00,215
Darcy...
Is a beautiful woman.

691
01:10:03,485 --> 01:10:04,952
What are you going to do?!

692
01:10:04,954 --> 01:10:07,187
Aah!
Aah!

693
01:10:08,756 --> 01:10:10,456
All right, I'm DEA!

694
01:10:13,193 --> 01:10:14,959
Anything else?

695
01:10:17,495 --> 01:10:18,828
No, damn it!

696
01:10:20,797 --> 01:10:22,597
Please don't cut her anymore.

697
01:10:22,599 --> 01:10:25,333
Lando: No!

698
01:10:25,335 --> 01:10:28,469
You motherfucker! No!

699
01:10:28,471 --> 01:10:31,905
Aah!

700
01:11:09,374 --> 01:11:11,274
Sloan!

701
01:11:12,976 --> 01:11:16,645
I had to, sensei.
I didn't know... oh!

702
01:11:48,476 --> 01:11:50,710
Bill: It's your fault
she's dead, lando.

703
01:11:56,282 --> 01:11:59,284
There's something
I got to tell you.

704
01:11:59,286 --> 01:12:01,486
What?

705
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:05,990
I haven't told you
what I grew up to be...

706
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:07,791
DEA agent.

707
01:12:07,793 --> 01:12:09,993
I'm your backup.

708
01:12:09,995 --> 01:12:11,461
You're DEA?

709
01:12:11,463 --> 01:12:14,363
I guess you were right
when you said

710
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:16,932
there's no hope for me.

711
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:26,707
Every contest today
is a fight to the death.

712
01:12:28,509 --> 01:12:31,043
Some of you are not prepared
to go to this distance,

713
01:12:31,045 --> 01:12:34,713
so now is your opportunity
to leave.

714
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:49,926
Thank you for the hospitality.

715
01:12:52,496 --> 01:12:53,729
Get out!

716
01:13:07,608 --> 01:13:09,074
Anyone else?

717
01:13:43,942 --> 01:13:45,042
Finish it.

718
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,014
All right, right here!

719
01:14:50,036 --> 01:14:52,103
Aah! Aah! Uhh!

720
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:12,247
Finish it.

721
01:16:12,249 --> 01:16:13,748
Hmmph.

722
01:17:27,183 --> 01:17:32,787
This tournament is a memorial
to my wife sian.

723
01:17:32,789 --> 01:17:36,090
5 years ago,
the DEA tear-gasses my home.

724
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,227
Sian was caught
in the fire that followed.

725
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:49,234
David Sloan was responsible
for sian's death.

726
01:17:49,236 --> 01:17:54,038
He will be punished
in the thai style.

727
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,640
For $500,000 bonus,

728
01:17:56,642 --> 01:17:57,841
who will challenge?

729
01:17:57,843 --> 01:18:00,743
Just have my money ready.

730
01:18:00,745 --> 01:18:03,312
This is not gonna take long.

731
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:07,349
It's time you learned
to show a little respect.

732
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:08,717
Tong po: Win...

733
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,652
And you get me!

734
01:18:10,654 --> 01:18:13,688
And perhaps,
Vicky might be saved.

735
01:18:40,381 --> 01:18:41,914
Is that enough?

736
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:44,049
Yeah!
Th-that's enough.

737
01:18:48,387 --> 01:18:49,920
That's enough.

738
01:18:52,323 --> 01:18:53,723
Ok!

739
01:18:53,725 --> 01:18:55,057
Tong po: Who is next?

740
01:20:30,385 --> 01:20:31,752
Tong po: You!

741
01:20:31,754 --> 01:20:34,054
Fight or die!

742
01:20:41,862 --> 01:20:44,129
You don't have the guts
to fight him yourself.

743
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:45,530
Kill Sloan!

744
01:20:45,532 --> 01:20:48,766
Or you all die!

745
01:20:48,768 --> 01:20:52,535
Megan:
It's all been a lie.

746
01:20:54,437 --> 01:20:57,005
There is no money.

747
01:20:57,007 --> 01:20:59,007
You saw what he did
to the others.

748
01:21:05,112 --> 01:21:06,345
He intends to kill us.

749
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:54,825
You're mine!

750
01:22:28,459 --> 01:22:30,259
You're a little bitch.

751
01:22:30,261 --> 01:22:31,260
Uhh!

752
01:22:31,262 --> 01:22:33,929
Aah!

753
01:22:45,073 --> 01:22:46,073
Oh...

754
01:22:48,109 --> 01:22:49,943
Oh... Ah!

755
01:22:53,947 --> 01:22:55,080
Ow!

756
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:17,067
I thought you wanted
to fight me,

757
01:23:17,069 --> 01:23:19,335
defeat me in a match,

758
01:23:19,337 --> 01:23:20,903
regain your honor.

759
01:23:23,106 --> 01:23:26,207
Killing my wife
only shames you forever.

760
01:23:29,578 --> 01:23:32,546
Maybe he's right.

761
01:24:42,983 --> 01:24:45,384
Uhh! Uhh!

762
01:24:59,564 --> 01:25:01,131
Haaa!

763
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:38,267
Hold it, or she's dead!

764
01:25:44,073 --> 01:25:46,674
Move away real slow.

765
01:26:41,024 --> 01:26:46,045
