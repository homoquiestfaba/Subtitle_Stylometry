1
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:29,552
"Take It To The Limit"?

2
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,559
Artist and year?

3
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:41,068
1975. The Eagles, of course.
Very funny.

4
00:02:20,548 --> 00:02:23,608
That's not a song. It's ridiculous.
You made it up.

5
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:28,653
That is definitely a song.
It's a good song, and a winning song.

6
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,591
You give up?

7
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,293
On belay.

8
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:39,693
"MacArthur Park." Richard Harris.
1968.

9
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:44,864
1968? I didn't even think they had
recorded music back then.

10
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:48,099
Excuse me. I have a signed album
by Mr. Harris.

11
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,434
It was cutting-edge stuff back then.

12
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:53,437
Peter, check your sister's belay.

13
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:54,943
Want to tell him we're not 15?

14
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,774
Why bother? We'll always be 15.

15
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:00,677
Dad, she needs a second cam.

16
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:02,489
That won't hold in a fall.

17
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:04,721
Screw you.

18
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:06,086
Listen, Annie.

19
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:08,285
No matter how experienced...

20
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,598
...a smart climber always wears a belt
and suspenders.

21
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,097
Two cams are safe, three's better.

22
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:18,504
I'm not kidding. We're not moving
until you put another cam in the wall.

23
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,400
I have three cams.
He's yanking your chain.

24
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,335
Watch out!

25
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:29,414
Amateurs at twelve o'clock!
Check your safety!

26
00:03:57,845 --> 00:03:59,676
Too much weight!
It's not gonna hold!

27
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,548
Hold it together, you two!

28
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,050
Now get a grip.

29
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:09,114
We're getting out of this.

30
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:13,486
Annie, how close to the wall are we?

31
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:19,057
Keep still, goddamn it!
Stop moving around! Stop!

32
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:22,328
Dad!

33
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,281
Both of you...

34
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:39,446
...keep very still.

35
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,210
Try and stay calm.

36
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,012
Annie.

37
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,124
Is the other cam moving?

38
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:47,687
No.

39
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,692
Try and reach the wall.

40
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:52,793
See if you can anchor us back in.

41
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:55,099
Try it.

42
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,798
It's moving!

43
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:32,068
Peter, get your knife.

44
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,103
What?

45
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:34,806
Just do as I say.

46
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,540
Get it!

47
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,369
You don't have much time here.

48
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:42,848
You have to do something for me.

49
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:44,878
Cut me loose.

50
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,310
One cam can't hold us all.

51
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:50,256
You have to cut me loose...

52
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,586
...or else I'll pull everybody down.
Everybody will die!

53
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:55,260
Shut up, Annie!

54
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:57,657
It's one dead or three, Peter.

55
00:05:57,865 --> 00:05:59,264
Don't make him do this.

56
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:01,332
You're gonna kill your sister.

57
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,461
Annie will die if you don't.

58
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:05,263
-I won't do it!
-Cut the rope!

59
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,972
-I can't!
-Stop it!

60
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:10,610
That cam is gonna come out
and Annie and you will die!

61
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:13,279
-You'll kill your sister!
-Stop it!

62
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,846
Cut the damn rope!

63
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:18,847
It doesn't matter about me. Cut it.

64
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:20,111
We're out of time!

65
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,481
Don't do it!

66
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:24,981
No one will blame you for it!
Just cut it!

67
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:29,758
Annie and you are gonna die!
Just cut it, Peter!

68
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:17,186
We're cleared for the Siachen glacier.
A doctor's on standby.

69
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:20,195
I was heading there anyway.
Mail and supplies.

70
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,766
I can drop you on my way back
to K2 base camp.

71
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,834
Sounds good.

72
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,551
I tried to visit you a few days ago.

73
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,548
But the weather closed in.

74
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:43,051
Annie's at base camp.
Arrived last week.

75
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:33,334
Would you like a tea?

76
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,099
No, I'm fine.

77
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:38,934
You must try the tea. It's very good.
Indian, of course.

78
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,273
We may be at war with them,
but their tea's the best.

79
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:07,273
-Forgive me. Mr. Garrett, isn't it?
-Yes.

80
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:09,635
National Geographic is always welcome.

81
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:13,276
The only Westerners who come to
Pakistan without conquering something.

82
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:17,974
The colonel's angry. Only 25% of his
medical supplies are onboard.

83
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:20,983
And three days late.
Look at this place.

84
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:24,789
In six years, I've lost 800 men.
Not one to the enemy.

85
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,318
But the chopper was full of stuff.

86
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,260
Not for my men.

87
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:33,260
For Americans who can pay $3 million for
climbing permits.

88
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,293
Elliot Vaughn, the entrepreneur.

89
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:40,166
He's got 40 people with him to try K2.
I've been seconded to his team.

90
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:41,671
Seconded or sold?

91
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:49,977
That's a question only a general
in Islamabad can answer.

92
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:53,846
Three o'clock.
Time to wake up the Indians.

93
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:12,495
So Annie's coming in with Vaughn's team?

94
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:15,339
She's leading a WNN documentary crew.

95
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,533
They're going up the mountain
with him.

96
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:20,111
Have you seen her?

97
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:23,316
Not yet. One of the guides told me.

98
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,678
What about Vaughn?
What's he all about?

99
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:32,516
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Sensitive, kind, modest.

100
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,617
Your typical billionaire.

101
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:39,393
Four years ago his team took
on the south face.

102
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,194
Was 800 feet from the top
when weather closed in.

103
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:45,037
Twenty-four hours in the death zone.

104
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:50,239
Next morning, he walked down.
He's a bloody good climber.

105
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:37,222
-Got your update, Annie.
-What's up?

106
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:39,790
That cyclone's tracking fast
from southeast.

107
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,018
Let me know if anything changes.

108
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:12,218
What are you--?

109
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:17,221
I just happened to be in the area.

110
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:25,765
I heard WNN hired you. And you're
hosting it. Congrats.

111
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:29,698
They needed someone who could climb K2
and look presentable.

112
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,036
Not much of a rush.

113
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:34,942
That's not true. They wanted the best.

114
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:40,177
I read about you on the Eiger.
Fastest female ascent.

115
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,349
Dad would be proud.

116
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:02,535
When you leaving?

117
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:07,009
Early tomorrow morning. We want to
be summiting by 2:00 Wednesday.

118
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:10,339
What does the mountain say about that?

119
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,114
I thought you laid siege to it.

120
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,819
I didn't know it could be scheduled.

121
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:19,356
It's a plan, Peter, that's all.

122
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,559
Vaughn's aggressive. He knows what he
wants and goes for it.

123
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,287
I admire him.

124
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:27,725
How long have you known him?

125
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:32,296
Wherever you're going with this,
you're wrong.

126
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:34,531
Nobody ever affects my climbing.

127
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:48,711
Was that two of them, Cyril?

128
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:53,214
Or has this stuff just gotten
better than we thought?

129
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:25,543
-Frank.
-Good to see you.

130
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:29,687
-Tommy McLaren. Colorado Kid.
-You ready to go?

131
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,380
You lead, I'll follow.

132
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:33,750
There's my leading lady. Hi, Annie.

133
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,756
-How was your trip?
-My stomach's still up there.

134
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,095
Luckily I passed on the eggs Benedict.

135
00:17:41,368 --> 00:17:43,359
Excuse me for a minute.

136
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:47,296
Ed Viesturs.
It's an honor to meet you.

137
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:49,099
-Elliot Vaughn.
-Nice to meet you.

138
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,278
This guy has been up Everest five times.

139
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,844
He's climbed 12 of the world's
14 highest peaks.

140
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:57,943
All without oxygen.

141
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,949
Rock on. By comparison, all of us
are merely amateurs.

142
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:05,716
-It's a real honor, Ed.
-Welcome to base camp.

143
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:06,984
Thank you.

144
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:20,199
Outdoors magazine wants
to interview you.

145
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,008
"Bankruptcy at High Altitude."

146
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:25,342
How much can we--

147
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:29,579
Yes?

148
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:36,155
I could go and come back, or....

149
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:43,691
Looking for Skip?

150
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:46,023
Yeah.

151
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,265
Try the command tent.

152
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:51,365
Thanks.

153
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:01,539
Skip?

154
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:03,705
I'm Peter Garrett.

155
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:05,712
-Good to meet you.
-Good to meet you.

156
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:09,045
I got your message.
Bad luck about your porter.

157
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:13,382
I've got four you can meet tomorrow.
Supplies you need are no problem.

158
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:16,594
The Swedish hooker's taking longer
than I thought.

159
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:21,231
There's no shortage of entertainment.
You saw Mr. Vaughn fly in?

160
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:26,267
He's hard to miss. What's this
about his climbing to a deadline?

161
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:29,634
-Friend of yours?
-My sister's climbing with him.

162
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:32,904
Annie Garrett.

163
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:38,748
Vaughn's got this publicity stunt
for his new airline, Majestic Air.

164
00:19:39,086 --> 00:19:43,750
He stands on the top of K2 waving
as the inaugural flight goes overhead.

165
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,156
Are you serious?

166
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,826
I'm deadly serious.

167
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:52,455
Your sister's safe. No one knows
these hills better than Tommy McLaren.

168
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,994
He told Vaughn they'd get up there.
I know I did.

169
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:58,002
I'd have told him anything
for $1 million.

170
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:00,762
Is that what he's spending?

171
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:04,771
That's just for Tom. Bought his
company out for the entire season.

172
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:08,770
Not that I'm pissed off.
Look what I get to drag to the top.

173
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:14,277
56-year-old movie producer
with dysfunctional bowel syndrome.

174
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:17,454
He's got the runs, mate. Permanently.

175
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,852
The Bench brothers bet
he won't make it past 18,000.

176
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:24,097
-What do you think?
-What do I think?

177
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:29,098
It depends. I'm so broke I might have
to shove him in a crevasse myself.

178
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:34,006
This is Monique, our base camp manager
and medic. Monique, Peter.

179
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:37,367
We've met. You should look at these.

180
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:42,304
Don't mind her. She's French-Canadian.

181
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:45,641
Some days she's Canadian
and can be quite pleasant.

182
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:47,977
Today, she's obviously French.

183
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:15,170
How about some Spanish mackerel
for the bow?

184
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:19,216
My name's Cyril. I'm not much,
but I'm all I think about.

185
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,352
Watch out for him, he's like a dog.
If he sees something...

186
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:26,523
...he tries to shag it. If he can't
shag it, he tries to eat it.

187
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,851
If he can't eat it, he pisses on it.

188
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:33,360
It's easy to tell us apart,
because I'm the shy one.

189
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,361
No, no, no, señorita.

190
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,370
Here you go.
Have a drink on Mr. Vaughn.

191
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,440
What time's the laser show?

192
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:51,206
Is this thing on?

193
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:53,082
Howdy!

194
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:57,049
Everyone hear me all right?

195
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,948
No!

196
00:22:01,962 --> 00:22:03,554
You're the lucky ones.

197
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:08,792
Welcome to the highest party
in the world!

198
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,642
Okay, maybe I did overdo it
just a bit.

199
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:22,078
Four years ago, I came here
with a dream to climb K2.

200
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,743
The toughest mountain in the world.

201
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,446
As most of you know,
that attempt ended in tragedy.

202
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,122
On Wednesday,
with the help of Tom McLaren...

203
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,120
...I intend to fulfill that dream.

204
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,661
And while I'm at it, take care
of some business, Texas style.

205
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,498
At 0900 hours, Greenwich Mean Time...

206
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:52,108
...the inaugural flight of Majestic
Air will fly over the summit...

207
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,606
...and we'll be there to wave them on!

208
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,520
To the other teams climbing,
I'd like to say be safe...

209
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:04,850
...and good luck.

210
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,954
Kick up your heels
and enjoy the barbecue!

211
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,640
What about the weather, Mr. Vaughn?

212
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:31,143
We hope for the best.
You know something we don't?

213
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:35,621
The weather closes in
and people die up there.

214
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:38,821
Or don't you have to worry about that?

215
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,489
Anybody who doesn't worry
about that is a fool.

216
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:49,290
Brian Maki did a high-atmosphere
analysis of the last 4 decades.

217
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:55,497
Most years there's a 9-to-12-day lull
before the fall storms.

218
00:23:55,842 --> 00:23:59,835
On August 2nd, we calculate
an 82% chance of fine weather.

219
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:03,180
Give me odds like that
in the oil business, I'd be rich.

220
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,352
Who's the leader, Mr. Vaughn?

221
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:14,316
Who makes decisions that mean
other people live or die?

222
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:16,355
Who plays God, so to speak?

223
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,126
There can be only one leader.
It's always the best climber.

224
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:27,103
I've made it clear to everyone
that Tom McLaren is that man.

225
00:24:31,444 --> 00:24:34,538
Even the Pakistanis agree.
They're giving you a 21-gun salute.

226
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:40,946
Okay, let's party!

227
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:46,715
Thanks for that, Elliot.

228
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,451
You climb as good as you talk,
we'll get you there.

229
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:13,412
You know that old guy
who was asking questions?

230
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:16,539
Montgomery Wick.

231
00:26:18,218 --> 00:26:20,448
Remember Dad used to talk about him?

232
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:26,552
They were in the service together--

233
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:28,555
Of course, I remember.

234
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:37,728
I miss him, Annie.
I miss him just as much as--

235
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:39,504
I can't talk about it.

236
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,397
You never have.

237
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:45,000
There's nothing to say.
He's gone, Peter.

238
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,513
Look, you can blame me all you want...

239
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,011
...but that last cam would've failed.

240
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:55,344
It held the two of us.

241
00:26:56,523 --> 00:27:00,015
You want to do this?
Okay, fine, let's do it.

242
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,351
You didn't give it a chance.

243
00:27:02,695 --> 00:27:05,425
-He knew it wouldn't hold either.
-Of course he didn't.

244
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:07,029
We were his life.

245
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:11,192
He would've died rather than take
a chance anything might happen to us.

246
00:27:11,938 --> 00:27:13,599
I think we owed him the same.

247
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:18,268
But I did what I thought was right.

248
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:23,105
If you're so right, why haven't
you climbed? Or been to his grave?

249
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:29,685
I'm not going up there for a TV show.
I'm going up there for him.

250
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:32,790
I want to be the person
he always wanted me to be.

251
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,091
When I'm up there, I feel close
to him.

252
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:38,628
I touch his soul.

253
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:47,128
Take care up there.

254
00:27:58,985 --> 00:28:00,418
This is it.

255
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:02,945
Wish you were going with me.

256
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:08,092
Not this time. Take care up there.
It'll be a great day for Texas.

257
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:10,089
And Scotland.

258
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,207
What is it?

259
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:33,311
Spindrift coming off the top.

260
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:37,346
That's local. If something was coming
in, it'd show on the other peaks.

261
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:41,353
Your sister's fine, man.
You look after yourself.

262
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:45,522
You too. Thanks for everything.

263
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:05,569
Understood, Tom.
You guys take good care up there.

264
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:08,771
Thanks, base. Out.

265
00:31:10,543 --> 00:31:12,033
Well, you heard it.

266
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,073
Computer model shows it's building.

267
00:31:18,284 --> 00:31:20,445
That's a concern.

268
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,552
We're about an hour from
the bottleneck, right?

269
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,087
Let's kick it and get up there.

270
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:31,320
Gets any worse,
we'll shelter under the ice cliffs.

271
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:35,294
If it comes in fast,
we're totally exposed out here.

272
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:37,865
It's not fast.
He said it's slow-moving.

273
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:41,264
There's a 70% chance
it'll turn east and miss us.

274
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:44,508
I'm not gonna risk a storm.
Not at 26,000.

275
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,202
We're not suggesting anything stupid.
The weather could turn.

276
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,712
The odds are with us.
We're five hours from the summit.

277
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:55,252
We turn back now, that's it.
We've lost our window.

278
00:31:55,555 --> 00:31:59,548
I know. Elliot, I'm aware of that.
It's my responsibility.

279
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,690
I won't let a marketing campaign
compromise our safety.

280
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:06,387
You think this is
about a marketing campaign?

281
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:10,559
Come on, Tom.
This is about getting to the top.

282
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:13,895
I don't give a shit
about the publicity.

283
00:32:15,074 --> 00:32:16,564
This is a life statement for me.

284
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,908
We're only 500 feet from
the bottleneck. Let's keep going.

285
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,079
Okay.

286
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:35,587
Okay.

287
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:41,797
Let's go.

288
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,287
980 hecto-Pascals and falling.

289
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:07,582
Lenticular cloud to the southeast.
Winds at 80 knots, rising.

290
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:10,626
Tom says he's going on.
What's base camp pressure?

291
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,127
Pressure's dropped two points
in four hours.

292
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:15,627
You made your case. We listened.
We decided.

293
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:19,802
It's too high a risk. Why am I here
if you don't listen to me?

294
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:24,974
I'll assess the risk. As to why
you're here, I wonder myself.

295
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:28,644
I'm Annie's brother.
McLaren's pulling them back, right?

296
00:33:28,981 --> 00:33:30,972
We're on target. They're going on.

297
00:33:31,317 --> 00:33:34,650
The wind's hit to the south.
What's your satellite show?

298
00:33:34,987 --> 00:33:36,978
We've assessed the data.
We're going up.

299
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,555
It shows bad air coming in from India.

300
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:43,658
What the hell are you doing?

301
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:50,497
-How high are they?
-26,000.

302
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:54,632
-What are you doing?!
-Warning my sister!

303
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,172
Leave it! That's enough!

304
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:01,176
Tom McLaren, come in.

305
00:34:02,381 --> 00:34:04,872
Tom McLaren, this is base camp.
Do you copy?

306
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:07,208
Tom McLaren, do you read?

307
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,021
Come in, base.

308
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:16,692
You've got a major storm coming in.
You've gotta start down.

309
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:19,592
Who is this?

310
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:21,925
Peter Garrett.
You copy about the storm?

311
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:25,364
Where's Frank Williams?
Put Frank Williams on.

312
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,706
Skip here. We're looking
at the weather screens.

313
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:36,378
If this doesn't turn, you'll be in
big trouble. Turn back immediately.

314
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:38,872
Do you copy?

315
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,110
Yeah, I copy that.
Thanks, Skip. Out.

316
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:43,647
How we doing?

317
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:46,552
I'm pulling the plug.
We're going down.

318
00:34:46,892 --> 00:34:49,383
-Just hold on.
-I'm sorry, Elliot.

319
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:52,390
You pay me to make these decisions.

320
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,259
I'm paying you to get me to the top.

321
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,834
Jesus! Elliot, you told me
I was in charge up here.

322
00:34:59,038 --> 00:35:01,563
You are! Why are you vacillating?

323
00:35:02,074 --> 00:35:04,702
Because some second-rate guide
got on the radio?

324
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,878
Nobody knows this mountain better
than Skip.

325
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,243
Skip Taylor's a hustler. He was
jockeying me to be in your boots.

326
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:14,242
Don't crap out on me now.

327
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,310
Come on, what did you think?

328
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:20,915
She'd just lift up her skirt
and pull her panties down for us?

329
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,989
Is this how you got up Everest twice?

330
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,420
I'm going down.

331
00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:32,768
Fine. Fine.

332
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:36,772
Go down. Go on. Sit it out.

333
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,771
The storm will turn and you'll spend
the rest of your life living it down.

334
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:44,144
That should do wonders
for your business.

335
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,291
I'm sorry, can I? Please.

336
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:48,176
We're going back!

337
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:54,686
We don't have a choice!
We are dead on the ridge! Let's go!

338
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,691
Fuck you!

339
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:18,725
Annie!

340
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:21,564
Annie, can you hear me?

341
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:25,470
I'm all right! I'm safe!

342
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:31,982
Elliot!

343
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:35,253
I'm fine! We're okay!

344
00:38:51,337 --> 00:38:53,168
Avalanche!

345
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:07,504
Annie, are you there?
Can you hear me?

346
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:55,783
Come in, base, this is summit team.
Do you read me?

347
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:07,963
Anybody, do you read me? This is
the Vaughn summit team. Come in.

348
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:12,743
Summit team, this is base camp.
Do you copy?

349
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:19,147
Summit team, this is base camp.

350
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:38,493
If you're gonna do that,
do it outside.

351
00:42:29,388 --> 00:42:32,551
Base, this is summit team.
Are you trying to contact us?

352
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,390
Here. Let me.

353
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:40,387
Oh, my God. That's Morse code.

354
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:45,901
My dad taught us when we were kids.
Said it could save your life.

355
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,900
Smart man, your father.

356
00:42:54,246 --> 00:42:55,736
He sure was.

357
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:04,254
There's three of them.

358
00:43:09,094 --> 00:43:10,356
Vaughn.

359
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:14,925
Tom.

360
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,930
Annie.

361
00:43:35,954 --> 00:43:37,285
I'm sorry, Kareem.

362
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:40,455
You say there are three.

363
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:44,292
Maybe there are others.

364
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:48,630
Maybe.

365
00:43:56,308 --> 00:44:00,404
Tell them we can't keep talking.
We gotta save power.

366
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:03,641
He's right.

367
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,811
What's he saying, Annie?

368
00:44:08,987 --> 00:44:10,818
They're coming to get us.

369
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:16,920
It's not just snow.
It's gonna be ice and rock.

370
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:20,489
We need special tools.
I don't know how much we have here.

371
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:23,323
Then how do you get it
up there, Mr. Garrett?

372
00:44:26,004 --> 00:44:28,336
Then we dig with our bare hands
if we have to.

373
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:32,940
Whatever it takes. We have more than
enough guys here to get this done.

374
00:44:36,682 --> 00:44:40,277
What the hell do you want to do?
Just leave them there?

375
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:48,014
Peter.

376
00:44:50,362 --> 00:44:53,195
You can't ask people to work there.

377
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:55,366
That high, just staying alive is--

378
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:58,363
So we just walk away
and forget about them?

379
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:03,865
They had one fuel can each. They can
melt ice and rehydrate for a day.

380
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:06,336
At 26,000, without it,
their lungs fill with fluid.

381
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:09,708
That's pulmonary edema,
they die within another 12.

382
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:13,211
That gives us a window of 36 hours.

383
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,549
Montgomery Wick.

384
00:45:23,562 --> 00:45:25,393
Wick speed-summited in 24.

385
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:27,221
We're not Montgomery Wick.

386
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:30,899
Even if we were, how long does that
leave to get through the rock and ice?

387
00:45:34,406 --> 00:45:38,240
We don't know their exact location.
How long will that take?

388
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:44,078
I won't let Annie die.

389
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:48,742
So what are we gonna do?

390
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:34,963
Nitroglycerin, Mr. Garrett.

391
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,791
I wouldn't touch it
with an English barge pole.

392
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,130
We use it to blast rock
for gun emplacements.

393
00:46:41,473 --> 00:46:44,306
It's low-freezing
and more powerful than symtex.

394
00:46:46,144 --> 00:46:48,135
My responsibility ends at that door.

395
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,813
I want to make one thing clear.
This is your decision.

396
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,482
It's got nothing
to do with the Pakistani army.

397
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,812
Which is a legal way of saying
I think it's madness.

398
00:46:58,156 --> 00:47:00,317
A magnificent madness, though.

399
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:01,819
Good luck.

400
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,024
Stop!

401
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:09,998
Skip, don't move your feet.

402
00:47:11,169 --> 00:47:12,830
Everybody keep very still.

403
00:47:25,684 --> 00:47:27,015
Okay, Skip.

404
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:34,215
Let me get this straight.
You want to go up that hill...

405
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:37,684
...with nitro on your back
and hope that it doesn't jolt?

406
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,088
That's right.

407
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:44,222
A hundred thousand sperm
and you were the fastest?

408
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,101
Skip here's agreed to go,
so I need four more.

409
00:48:51,436 --> 00:48:54,701
It'll be a speed ascent,
in pairs, one canister per team.

410
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,271
People have to share?
Won't everyone want their own bomb?

411
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:06,105
Ed.

412
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:08,451
You're the best climber here.

413
00:49:09,955 --> 00:49:13,254
I'm not one to walk away,
but I think it's suicide.

414
00:49:13,558 --> 00:49:15,116
If we just leave them,
what do you call that?

415
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,725
It's reality. You're willing
to risk six lives to save three?

416
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:20,562
How do you feel about that?

417
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:22,130
The same way you do.

418
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:27,131
Your best friend died on Everest.
What if it was him up there right now?

419
00:49:31,476 --> 00:49:32,909
I will go.

420
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:36,743
Ali is my cousin. It is my duty.

421
00:49:46,258 --> 00:49:49,659
How about it, Mal? You and Cyril
have been up there before.

422
00:49:51,596 --> 00:49:52,585
No....

423
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:54,558
Why would we want to leave this place?

424
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,125
Luxurious accommodation.
Fine cuisine.

425
00:49:57,335 --> 00:49:59,326
Sultry weather.
Frostbite's off my dick.

426
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:02,596
I reckon we should wait
until they chuck in a ski lift.

427
00:50:02,841 --> 00:50:06,402
Good idea. lmagine coming to the
Himalayas and actually climbing.

428
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:09,808
Especially when you have
to complete your autobiography.

429
00:50:10,115 --> 00:50:14,848
And rustle up those all-important
endorsements. You wankers!

430
00:50:18,957 --> 00:50:21,289
What's bloody wrong with you?!

431
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,450
We're in.

432
00:50:26,197 --> 00:50:27,459
Thank you.

433
00:50:29,668 --> 00:50:30,999
I need one more.

434
00:50:40,145 --> 00:50:43,046
I'll write a check now
for anyone who goes.

435
00:50:43,381 --> 00:50:47,215
Whether Elliot makes it or not,
I'll be waiting when you get back.

436
00:50:47,552 --> 00:50:49,713
Half a million bucks.

437
00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:57,992
Does that include the tip?

438
00:51:21,586 --> 00:51:26,250
My brother's got explosives.
They're gonna blast their way down.

439
00:51:26,925 --> 00:51:28,358
Blast their way down.

440
00:51:30,595 --> 00:51:34,588
How are they gonna find us?
We might as well be on Mars.

441
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:37,925
It's not a question of how,
it's how long.

442
00:51:38,536 --> 00:51:42,267
It's time that's gonna kill us.
We have to lay down a schedule.

443
00:51:42,774 --> 00:51:44,605
A regimen we all adhere to.

444
00:51:45,377 --> 00:51:47,538
Edema sets in
if we don't keep drinking.

445
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:51,340
Now, I figure, three water bottles...

446
00:51:51,616 --> 00:51:53,277
...that's half a cup each,
every 2 hours.

447
00:51:53,618 --> 00:51:57,782
After that, fuel cells to melt ice,
and finally...

448
00:51:58,123 --> 00:51:59,715
...we use the dex syringes.

449
00:52:00,892 --> 00:52:03,622
Chances are we're all gonna get
pretty sick...

450
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:07,292
...but if we keep to the schedule,
keep to it...

451
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:09,130
...maybe we can hold out.

452
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:15,733
Annie, we need to give them the grid
reference for our last known position.

453
00:52:16,074 --> 00:52:20,306
She says they were about 300 feet
above the Anvil, heading down east.

454
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:22,303
The shoulder ice field.

455
00:52:22,647 --> 00:52:24,979
I checked their manifest.
This is what they have.

456
00:52:25,316 --> 00:52:29,480
We leave at dawn.
They got 22 hours if they're lucky.

457
00:52:29,821 --> 00:52:31,152
How high can we chopper in?

458
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:34,322
Rasul says 21,000.
Any higher, the air's too thin.

459
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:36,627
He drops us.
How fast can we get there?

460
00:52:36,828 --> 00:52:41,265
Negrotto Col's the only place we can
land. From there, 27 hours.

461
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:53,101
Five hours short.

462
00:52:56,848 --> 00:53:00,477
We need Montgomery Wick. He's the
only man who's done it faster.

463
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:01,674
Will he do it?

464
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:08,849
Four years ago, a big storm blows
an American team off the hill.

465
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:13,028
There's nine up there, including
his wife. She was a guide.

466
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:17,858
He knows he can't help her, but he
goes anyway. The only one who did.

467
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:22,537
He lost all his toes to frostbite
but dragged 3 guys off the mountain.

468
00:53:22,874 --> 00:53:26,207
They owe their lives to him.
What do you reckon?

469
00:53:27,879 --> 00:53:28,846
Where is he?

470
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,214
On the mountain.
Up the shoulder, where he always goes.

471
00:53:33,551 --> 00:53:36,987
They never found his wife's body,
so he keeps looking.

472
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:38,812
The guy's a lunatic.

473
00:53:40,225 --> 00:53:41,556
That's just what we need.

474
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,992
Yeah. Strap on the nitro.

475
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,014
That's a great idea.
Smoking next to the nitro.

476
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:16,421
Although, bro and I always hoped
that you'd blow us.

477
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,451
Why are you going?

478
00:54:43,788 --> 00:54:45,449
The money, of course.

479
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:49,282
Skip hasn't paid anyone in months.
You know of a better way out?

480
00:54:51,062 --> 00:54:52,393
Can you climb?

481
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:57,627
Peter wants to know if I can climb.

482
00:54:58,636 --> 00:55:01,469
Worst I've seen.
Couldn't climb a ladder.

483
00:55:02,407 --> 00:55:03,897
You're that good, huh?

484
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:09,412
Yeah. But it was a very tall ladder.

485
00:55:25,997 --> 00:55:27,988
What the hell are you doing?

486
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:31,157
I'm trying to kiss my ass goodbye.

487
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,817
It's dawn.

488
00:55:47,018 --> 00:55:49,680
If the weather's cleared,
they'll be on their way.

489
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:51,352
I know.

490
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:53,949
Thank you.

491
00:55:55,693 --> 00:55:57,285
And your brother?

492
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,360
Has he climbed since Utah?

493
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:02,791
No.

494
00:56:03,868 --> 00:56:07,702
People say he lost his nerve.

495
00:56:08,473 --> 00:56:10,373
Have you heard that?

496
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:13,700
Yeah, I've heard that.

497
00:56:37,068 --> 00:56:38,000
Annie!

498
00:56:38,236 --> 00:56:40,397
It's a pack! Quick!

499
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:19,471
I'm not interested.

500
00:57:23,214 --> 00:57:25,512
You went before.
Men owe you their lives.

501
00:57:25,717 --> 00:57:28,345
Four years ago.
Now I just climb for myself.

502
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,916
My father was a climber. Royce
Garrett. He climbed Everest with you.

503
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:37,754
I don't care. I don't live my life
so you can look up to me.

504
00:57:37,962 --> 00:57:39,486
My sister's dying up there.

505
00:57:39,697 --> 00:57:42,222
Before you lecture me,
get your facts straight.

506
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:44,264
It'll be less embarrassing.

507
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:47,996
Up there, you're not dying,
Mr. Garrett. You're dead.

508
00:57:52,176 --> 00:57:53,939
What the hell happened to you?

509
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,783
Vaughn's people are offering $500,000
to anyone that goes.

510
00:57:59,984 --> 00:58:01,884
Maybe that'll make a difference.

511
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:04,588
Why would they do that?

512
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:06,188
He's one of them.

513
00:58:14,565 --> 00:58:16,362
What's their supply situation?

514
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:17,932
Enough for 22 hours.

515
00:58:18,136 --> 00:58:19,535
Twenty-two.

516
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:21,571
Who's coordinating at base?

517
00:58:21,773 --> 00:58:24,071
-Vaughn's people.
-That's a mistake.

518
00:58:24,275 --> 00:58:29,008
I'll need someone there I can trust.
Taylor, you know the mountain best.

519
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:32,205
Skip's one of the best climbers.
We'll need him.

520
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:35,750
Let's agree on one thing:
This is not a climbing democracy.

521
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:38,751
On a rescue, we don't vote,
question or argue.

522
00:58:38,956 --> 00:58:42,448
You listen and do exactly as I say.
Chopper will take you back.

523
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:55,604
Here's how we'll split it up.
Malcolm, you'll climb with Kareem.

524
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:58,298
-Cyril, you'll--
-What? No, I bloody won't.

525
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,809
You've been up the mountain too long
and forgotten the rules.

526
00:59:03,014 --> 00:59:04,914
Never eat at a place called "Ma's"...

527
00:59:05,116 --> 00:59:07,949
...don't play cards
with a fellow named Doc...

528
00:59:08,152 --> 00:59:12,020
...and never climb with a stranger.
I'm going with my brother.

529
00:59:12,824 --> 00:59:15,418
Frankly, I'd rather climb
with the Sheila.

530
00:59:16,327 --> 00:59:19,455
My rules: I put a strong climber
with a weaker one.

531
00:59:19,664 --> 00:59:21,598
You'll climb with Kareem.

532
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,700
Mr. Garrett,
you'll be climbing with me.

533
00:59:25,837 --> 00:59:28,465
Cyril. Guess what?

534
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:32,302
Come on, darling.
Give us a smile, eh!

535
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:35,809
It's the second best thing
you can do with your lips.

536
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,316
We'll take the west ridge.
Cyril, the Mushroom.

537
00:59:45,523 --> 00:59:47,320
Malcolm, Hockey Stick Gully.

538
00:59:47,525 --> 00:59:49,356
Speed up all of them is the same.

539
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:28,926
We're as high as I can take you!

540
01:00:50,555 --> 01:00:52,853
Move it! I can't hold it for long!

541
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:25,377
Next!

542
01:01:50,681 --> 01:01:53,445
I'm having trouble
maintaining altitude.

543
01:02:29,553 --> 01:02:31,544
Get out of here! We're gonna burn!

544
01:02:31,756 --> 01:02:34,190
Go! Move it! Move it!

545
01:03:05,523 --> 01:03:07,718
Grab my hand, damn it! Grab it!

546
01:03:18,903 --> 01:03:20,871
Come on! Come on!

547
01:04:35,646 --> 01:04:37,113
He needs dex. Now.

548
01:04:37,314 --> 01:04:38,440
No.

549
01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:40,714
We stick to the schedule.

550
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:45,786
In nine hours, the water runs out.
We need it. Our lives depend on it.

551
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,455
He'll die if he doesn't get it.

552
01:04:48,893 --> 01:04:50,724
He will anyway.

553
01:04:54,665 --> 01:04:56,292
Come on, Annie.

554
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,162
We both know Tom isn't going anywhere.

555
01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:03,164
You've done your best. You have.

556
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:06,173
We can't waste resources
on a lost cause.

557
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:08,709
Saving somebody's life
is not a lost cause.

558
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:11,414
It is, if you know
they can't be saved.

559
01:05:11,715 --> 01:05:14,115
Why should three people die
if two can live?

560
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,913
Okay. If that's what you think,
why don't you go tell him yourself?

561
01:05:25,496 --> 01:05:27,430
Tom, can you hear me?

562
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:29,997
-Don't listen to--
-He has a right to know!

563
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:36,963
You're a climber, Tom. A pro.

564
01:05:38,442 --> 01:05:40,876
You know the reality.
Even if they get to us...

565
01:05:41,078 --> 01:05:45,174
...they can't carry you down.
Not from this altitude.

566
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:50,717
Now, Annie wants to give you the dex.
I understand that, I do.

567
01:05:50,921 --> 01:05:54,982
But you and I know it's just
delaying what's inevitable.

568
01:05:57,561 --> 01:05:59,586
Just lie here and die, Elliot?

569
01:06:01,098 --> 01:06:02,929
Is that what you're telling me?

570
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:08,495
I'm not telling you anything.
I'm asking you to respect life...

571
01:06:09,273 --> 01:06:10,831
...not to waste it.

572
01:06:11,976 --> 01:06:16,174
-If I was in your position--
-You're not in my position!

573
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,147
That's right, I'm not.

574
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:27,547
Understand something. You're not just
killing me. You're killing her too.

575
01:07:34,325 --> 01:07:39,126
We're on a bit of a deadline, mate.
Can we just leave this till later?

576
01:07:39,363 --> 01:07:41,763
He's all right, isn't he,
this Allah bloke?

577
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:45,231
He won't strike you dead
if you miss one prayer, will he?

578
01:07:53,243 --> 01:07:56,371
All right. One prayer.

579
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,147
Under the circumstances.

580
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,647
What harm can it do?

581
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:07,880
Do Muslims believe in Hell?

582
01:08:09,426 --> 01:08:10,688
Do you?

583
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:15,095
So if that thing there blows...

584
01:08:15,866 --> 01:08:18,664
...and I don't believe in Allah,
I'm going to Hell?

585
01:08:20,104 --> 01:08:21,731
Is that what you reckon?

586
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:27,032
You're all the bloody same,
aren't you?

587
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,812
Born-agains say I don't believe
in Jesus, so I'll go to hell.

588
01:08:32,016 --> 01:08:34,814
Jews say I do believe in Jesus,
I'll go to Hell.

589
01:08:35,019 --> 01:08:38,887
Catholics say I don't believe
in the pope, I'll go to Hell.

590
01:08:40,457 --> 01:08:42,891
So any way you look at it,
I'm in the shit.

591
01:08:44,695 --> 01:08:47,664
Well, go on, then. What did he say?

592
01:08:48,432 --> 01:08:50,400
We gonna die up here or what?

593
01:08:51,101 --> 01:08:53,126
All men die, my friend.

594
01:08:53,437 --> 01:08:57,066
But Allah says it is what we do
before we die that counts.

595
01:08:57,341 --> 01:09:01,072
Jet stream's rising. I'd say
all clear for the next 48 hours.

596
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,006
Wick, do you copy?

597
01:09:04,214 --> 01:09:05,340
Copy.

598
01:09:05,549 --> 01:09:08,848
Pressure's up. You have clear skies
and light winds. Over.

599
01:09:09,053 --> 01:09:10,520
How long will it last?

600
01:09:10,721 --> 01:09:12,655
You're good for the next 48 hours.

601
01:09:12,856 --> 01:09:15,154
What is your exact position? Over.

602
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,886
The rock wall, about 400 feet
above Negrotto Col.

603
01:09:19,096 --> 01:09:21,189
I thought you'd be at the top by now.

604
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:25,994
Yeah, so did I. What's the status
at 26,000? How's the girl?

605
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:30,299
As far as I can tell, okay.
McLaren's serious. Internal injuries.

606
01:09:30,507 --> 01:09:31,838
And Vaughn?

607
01:09:32,242 --> 01:09:33,539
No word.

608
01:09:33,744 --> 01:09:35,268
Keep me informed.

609
01:09:38,148 --> 01:09:40,116
What is this with you and Vaughn?

610
01:09:40,517 --> 01:09:44,044
You're too slow, Mr. Garrett.
You've gotta move faster.

611
01:09:48,492 --> 01:09:50,426
Take your hands off me.

612
01:09:52,362 --> 01:09:53,886
It's not your concern.

613
01:09:54,098 --> 01:09:56,760
If it involves my sister,
it's my concern.

614
01:09:57,267 --> 01:10:00,236
I made it clear.
No arguments, no questions.

615
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,174
Look, if you've got another agenda...

616
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:08,511
...why don't you go back?
I don't need you.

617
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:15,883
Your sister will be dead in 14 hours.

618
01:10:21,658 --> 01:10:22,647
Good luck.

619
01:10:29,466 --> 01:10:31,434
I've got you. I've got you.

620
01:10:35,005 --> 01:10:37,337
You're as crazy as your old man.

621
01:10:47,384 --> 01:10:49,545
You did the right thing
to cut the rope.

622
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,454
Any good climber would have.

623
01:10:55,592 --> 01:10:58,584
If Royce had had the knife,
he'd have done it himself.

624
01:11:38,635 --> 01:11:40,899
I just got some spindrift in my lungs.

625
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:58,515
Summit team, this is alpha team.
Do you read?

626
01:11:58,722 --> 01:12:02,419
This is summit team. Come in, alpha.
This is summit team.

627
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,584
Annie Garrett, is that you?

628
01:12:04,795 --> 01:12:06,820
It's Elliot Vaughn. Who's this?

629
01:12:07,431 --> 01:12:08,830
Montgomery Wick.

630
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:14,732
-How many are you?
-Three teams, different routes.

631
01:12:15,505 --> 01:12:17,336
I'm with Peter Garrett.

632
01:12:17,741 --> 01:12:19,572
I thought you only climbed solo.

633
01:12:21,111 --> 01:12:22,806
Rescue missions are different.

634
01:12:24,248 --> 01:12:25,840
What's your location?

635
01:12:26,483 --> 01:12:29,316
West ridge, 23,000.

636
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,179
You'll have to climb faster.

637
01:12:32,923 --> 01:12:35,756
Tell Garrett Annie has edema.
That'll speed him up.

638
01:12:35,959 --> 01:12:38,052
Wick! Wick, this is Annie Garrett!

639
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:42,687
Wick! Do you read, Wick?

640
01:12:59,283 --> 01:13:00,750
She needs dex.

641
01:13:01,518 --> 01:13:03,679
It's too soon. She'll have to wait.

642
01:13:06,823 --> 01:13:07,812
Annie.

643
01:13:09,493 --> 01:13:10,551
Get it.

644
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:14,287
I told you.

645
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:18,060
I told you not to let her
give it to you.

646
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:22,163
You saddled up that pony,
now she can ride it.

647
01:13:23,874 --> 01:13:25,171
Vaughn, you're not sick!

648
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:26,706
Not yet.

649
01:13:27,177 --> 01:13:28,667
We hold to the schedule.

650
01:13:29,746 --> 01:13:32,943
-It's the only way to stay alive.
-For you, maybe.

651
01:13:34,751 --> 01:13:39,518
You know, Tom, intelligence doesn't
threaten me. Stupidity does.

652
01:13:39,723 --> 01:13:41,850
You arrogant prick!

653
01:13:44,594 --> 01:13:46,960
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

654
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:49,530
You were the leader, Tom.

655
01:13:56,907 --> 01:13:58,238
He's right.

656
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:01,937
None of us are gonna make it.

657
01:14:03,714 --> 01:14:05,341
You want to survive?

658
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:07,482
Go and get it.

659
01:14:15,025 --> 01:14:16,583
That's what I thought.

660
01:15:09,446 --> 01:15:10,845
Use your ax!

661
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,164
Cyril!

662
01:16:04,868 --> 01:16:06,631
-Cyril!
-I'm here!

663
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,832
I'm coming!

664
01:16:18,415 --> 01:16:19,643
It's coming through!

665
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,683
Hang on! It's gonna be okay!

666
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,817
Just hang on.

667
01:16:46,543 --> 01:16:48,272
That's all there is.

668
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:17,962
You see the rocks to your left?

669
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:21,864
Yeah, I can see them!

670
01:18:22,372 --> 01:18:24,636
I'm gonna swing you.

671
01:19:47,123 --> 01:19:48,147
Look out!

672
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:17,616
Cyril! Cyril, are you there?
Peter, are you there?

673
01:20:17,954 --> 01:20:19,683
Malcolm! This is Peter!

674
01:20:19,956 --> 01:20:21,617
I repeat, this is Peter.

675
01:20:22,459 --> 01:20:26,862
-It wasn't us!
-Cyril, you answer me, you bastard!

676
01:20:36,973 --> 01:20:38,531
Cyril!

677
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:40,903
Are you there?

678
01:20:42,912 --> 01:20:43,901
Cyril!

679
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:46,978
Damn it, you answer me!

680
01:20:47,817 --> 01:20:49,341
Nag, nag, nag.

681
01:20:49,552 --> 01:20:51,986
They always bloody nag.

682
01:20:52,655 --> 01:20:53,952
You're sick.

683
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:39,898
They could still be alive.

684
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:41,803
I'm going back.

685
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:47,072
Mr. Garrett.

686
01:21:48,812 --> 01:21:52,339
Your sister has pulmonary edema.
We don't have the time.

687
01:21:52,715 --> 01:21:55,115
Monique and Cyril are question marks.

688
01:21:55,919 --> 01:21:56,977
Your sister is not.

689
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:23,404
Bro, I'm sorry.

690
01:22:25,415 --> 01:22:26,905
We gotta go.

691
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:06,373
You gotta straighten it.

692
01:25:12,248 --> 01:25:13,647
Go ahead.

693
01:25:19,622 --> 01:25:21,283
It'll be fine. Just look me--

694
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:24,085
Don't bullshit me, Peter.
I'm a nurse.

695
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:33,034
Where were you going?

696
01:25:34,737 --> 01:25:38,070
-What are you talking about?
-Where will you go with the money?

697
01:25:38,274 --> 01:25:39,605
Anywhere!

698
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:47,509
Tell me.

699
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:54,987
Paris.

700
01:25:55,191 --> 01:25:57,887
I did two years of premed.
I want to finish it.

701
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:02,722
Any career worth this?

702
01:26:05,802 --> 01:26:09,397
Two years on Everest, three at K2.
I've had enough.

703
01:26:09,806 --> 01:26:14,402
Skip makes the Pakistanis look
well-organized, plus he's sexist.

704
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:20,114
-How long you been sleeping with him?
-Two years, and screw--

705
01:27:04,694 --> 01:27:06,093
My friend...

706
01:27:07,797 --> 01:27:09,788
...I think you should turn back.

707
01:29:13,589 --> 01:29:15,147
Wick, do you copy?

708
01:29:16,592 --> 01:29:19,254
Wick, this is base camp. Do you copy?

709
01:29:20,496 --> 01:29:21,485
Come in, base.

710
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,756
The nitro reacts to the sun.

711
01:29:23,966 --> 01:29:25,490
Get the nitro out of the sun.

712
01:29:26,002 --> 01:29:28,402
Get that goddamn pack out of the sun!

713
01:29:28,838 --> 01:29:29,930
It's gonna blow!

714
01:29:30,339 --> 01:29:31,601
It's gonna blow!

715
01:29:32,008 --> 01:29:33,498
Get the pack in the shade!

716
01:29:33,776 --> 01:29:37,940
The nitro! It's gonna blow!
Get it out of the sun!

717
01:29:40,349 --> 01:29:43,250
In the shade! There it is!

718
01:29:48,691 --> 01:29:50,591
Malcolm! Can you hear me?

719
01:29:50,793 --> 01:29:52,784
It's not their call time!

720
01:29:52,995 --> 01:29:54,292
Malcolm, do you read?!

721
01:29:55,698 --> 01:29:58,531
You take the shoulder.
I'll try the ridge.

722
01:29:59,535 --> 01:30:00,763
Malcolm!

723
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:36,462
Malcolm!

724
01:30:37,406 --> 01:30:39,067
Kareem!

725
01:30:40,076 --> 01:30:42,806
Malcolm! Kareem! Can you hear me?!

726
01:30:43,579 --> 01:30:46,412
You guys! Your radio!

727
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:48,645
Turn on your radio!

728
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,435
Come in, Peter.

729
01:31:09,872 --> 01:31:10,896
Are you listening?

730
01:31:11,107 --> 01:31:13,439
Malcolm, get the nitro into the shade!

731
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:20,615
Please, Peter, repeat.
I don't understand.

732
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:25,116
Get the nitro into the shade right now
orit will blow! Do you understand?

733
01:33:46,729 --> 01:33:48,219
Don't touch her.

734
01:35:00,135 --> 01:35:01,966
Is this what you're looking for?

735
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:09,508
Four years ago, an American team
got blown off the mountain.

736
01:35:09,712 --> 01:35:11,304
She was the guide.

737
01:35:12,414 --> 01:35:14,974
What happened?
She take shelter with Vaughn?

738
01:35:16,151 --> 01:35:20,087
Twenty-four, thirty-six hours.
I figure she died of edema.

739
01:35:20,289 --> 01:35:22,052
If only she'd had dex.

740
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:25,659
-You're wasting time.
-You think he used it for himself?

741
01:35:26,495 --> 01:35:28,827
-Answer me, damn it!
-Of course he did!

742
01:35:32,668 --> 01:35:34,192
How long have you known?

743
01:35:34,837 --> 01:35:37,465
At the interview,
he said the dex got swept away.

744
01:35:37,673 --> 01:35:40,107
That was a lie.
She always carried it on her.

745
01:35:42,778 --> 01:35:43,972
Four years, Wick?

746
01:35:44,179 --> 01:35:46,670
The mountain owns him.
He had to come back.

747
01:35:49,084 --> 01:35:50,551
Now you're gonna kill him.

748
01:35:51,186 --> 01:35:52,619
My wife died of edema.

749
01:35:52,821 --> 01:35:55,847
Skin stripped from her throat,
lungs filled with water.

750
01:35:56,058 --> 01:36:00,518
She drowned in her own bodily fluids.
Yeah, I'm gonna kill him.

751
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:03,393
I can't let you do it.

752
01:36:05,634 --> 01:36:07,602
Do you know where you are?

753
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:11,295
Above 24,000, you're at the
vertical limit, you're already dying.

754
01:36:11,507 --> 01:36:14,533
Look at you. You can hardly stand.

755
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:18,306
If you think you can stop me,
go ahead.

756
01:37:19,775 --> 01:37:22,744
Peter. Are you there?

757
01:37:23,278 --> 01:37:24,609
Peter.

758
01:37:24,913 --> 01:37:26,574
Annie. Annie, is it you?

759
01:37:26,949 --> 01:37:29,281
Annie. Annie, what is it?

760
01:37:32,254 --> 01:37:33,448
Where are you?

761
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:37,888
Five hours away.

762
01:37:40,295 --> 01:37:42,126
I want you to go back.

763
01:37:43,465 --> 01:37:46,127
Don't risk it. There's no reason.

764
01:37:49,438 --> 01:37:51,565
I won't be here and neither will Tom.

765
01:37:56,578 --> 01:37:57,567
How long?

766
01:37:59,982 --> 01:38:02,542
An hour. Two at the most.

767
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:10,584
Peter. Peter!

768
01:38:10,926 --> 01:38:12,257
I'm here, Annie.

769
01:38:19,668 --> 01:38:21,158
I've been thinking.

770
01:38:24,473 --> 01:38:26,532
I've been thinking a lot about Dad.

771
01:38:31,346 --> 01:38:33,507
We shouldn't have gotten him a grave.

772
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:38,843
We should have come up here
together with his ashes.

773
01:38:43,525 --> 01:38:45,857
He said this is where he was happiest.

774
01:38:47,863 --> 01:38:49,091
He was a climber.

775
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:53,200
I think every real climber
would want to stay on the mountain.

776
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:00,505
What do you think?

777
01:39:05,547 --> 01:39:07,708
I think we'll come back some day.

778
01:39:09,551 --> 01:39:11,041
The two of us.

779
01:39:12,287 --> 01:39:13,584
For Dad.

780
01:39:16,558 --> 01:39:18,389
I would've liked that.

781
01:39:20,195 --> 01:39:22,925
-I'm coming to get you, Annie.
-No, don't.

782
01:39:23,131 --> 01:39:25,691
Promise me. I don't want you to die.

783
01:39:25,901 --> 01:39:28,893
-I don't care!
-Don't put me through it, understand?

784
01:39:29,571 --> 01:39:30,765
Please.

785
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:33,065
Just...

786
01:39:34,543 --> 01:39:36,135
...please don't.

787
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:38,506
Please.

788
01:39:41,049 --> 01:39:42,744
Good night, Peter.

789
01:39:44,286 --> 01:39:45,617
I love you.

790
01:41:05,701 --> 01:41:07,965
Are you gonna kill me now?

791
01:41:09,104 --> 01:41:10,332
Yes.

792
01:42:57,079 --> 01:42:58,603
Bastard!

793
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:29,359
Are you ready?

794
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:32,706
I can't get them to melt.
They're frozen.

795
01:44:33,975 --> 01:44:36,239
-Boil the water!
-With what?

796
01:45:14,916 --> 01:45:16,178
Easy.

797
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:19,017
Easy.

798
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:24,084
Wait.

799
01:45:27,329 --> 01:45:29,194
Okay. Keep feeding it.

800
01:45:40,642 --> 01:45:41,870
Keep it coming.

801
01:45:45,614 --> 01:45:47,878
Stop! It's leaking!

802
01:45:49,451 --> 01:45:52,011
We can try and push it through
before it rips.

803
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:53,551
On three.

804
01:45:54,489 --> 01:45:56,218
One, two, three!

805
01:49:03,178 --> 01:49:04,907
Annie!

806
01:49:05,447 --> 01:49:07,312
Annie!

807
01:53:13,428 --> 01:53:14,759
Hold it! Hold it!

808
01:54:00,274 --> 01:54:01,536
No! No!

809
01:54:50,558 --> 01:54:51,820
How is she?

810
01:54:53,828 --> 01:54:55,159
Amazing.

811
01:54:56,931 --> 01:54:58,990
Talk about a will to live.

812
01:55:49,083 --> 01:55:51,711
-That's not a song.
-That's definitely a song.

813
01:55:51,919 --> 01:55:53,409
No way that's a song.

814
01:55:53,654 --> 01:55:55,519
That's a good song.

815
01:55:56,924 --> 01:55:59,085
A winning song, by the sound of it.

816
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,421
I think you're making it up.

817
01:56:07,902 --> 01:56:10,336
That was a hell of a thing
you did up there.

818
01:56:11,172 --> 01:56:13,003
Anybody else would've given up.

819
01:56:15,076 --> 01:56:16,668
Not everybody.

820
01:56:17,912 --> 01:56:19,573
He'd be proud of you.

821
01:56:21,415 --> 01:56:23,508
Angry, but really proud.

822
01:56:42,904 --> 01:56:44,235
Get some sleep.
