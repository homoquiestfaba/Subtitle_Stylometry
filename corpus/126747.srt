1
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,780
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,822
Georgianna went a half hour ago.
You're gonna miss it.

3
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,619
Put that on my tab.

4
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,825
Your bill.

5
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,862
"Tab" sounds like
y'all might pay it someday.

6
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,640
<i>Time was never a friend to Bobby Long.</i>

7
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,303
<i>It would conspire against him...</i>

8
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,781
<i>allow him to believe in a generous nature,</i>
<i>then rob him blind every time.</i>

9
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,452
<i>We had lost Lorraine, all of us...</i>

10
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,749
<i>but long before she died.</i>

11
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,601
You can't park here.
You'll get another ticket.

12
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,303
I don't see no signs, Miss Daisy.

13
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,686
It's all right.
I can walk to the curb from here.

14
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,191
Get me a beer.

15
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,917
You find a job?

16
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,250
You clean the fuck up?

17
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,953
That Bobby guy called again today.

18
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,025
- Again?
- He called a couple of days ago, remember?

19
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,730
No, you didn't tell me. What did he want?

20
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,732
He wanted to tell you about Lorraine.

21
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,026
What about her?

22
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,238
She died.

23
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,406
She what?

24
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,378
She's dead, all right? He called
because he thought you'd wanna know.

25
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,042
Lorraine died and you didn't tell me?

26
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,045
To Lorraine. May she finally find peace.

27
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,587
So, now what?
Lorraine finally kick y'all out?

28
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,358
No.

29
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:40,105
She never would.
Besides, God wouldn't let that happen.

30
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,139
Really? And why not?

31
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,769
'Cause God knows me, and I know God.

32
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,839
Go.

33
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,875
Cecil's pretty torn up. Make sure he eats.

34
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,554
I'll see you later.

35
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,417
She never meant nothing to you...

36
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,363
and you didn't mean a damn thing to her.
I didn't think you would care.

37
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,130
Come on, baby, stop.

38
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,367
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

39
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,671
Why don't you just cook me some dinner
and I'll go rent us a porno?

40
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,679
I have to go to a funeral, Lee...

41
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,046
unless I missed it
because you forgot to tell me...

42
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:28,554
that my mother is dead!
Fucking asshole. I am so out of here.

43
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,384
She was never your mother!

44
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,556
<i>Purslane? This is Bobby Long again.</i>

45
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,062
I don't know if you remember me...

46
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,099
but you missed your mama's funeral.

47
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,869
So long.

48
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,678
You got any smokes?

49
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,640
Sorry, sir.

50
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,980
- Y'all going down to Cecil's?
- In a minute.

51
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,682
- I'll see you guys.
- See you there.

52
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,923
You got a light?

53
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,485
- I thought you didn't have any.
- I don't.

54
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,027
Not for Junior.

55
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,895
He's got to cut down.
He's got fierce emphysema.

56
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,096
That cough sends shivers of mortality
down my spine.

57
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,974
"He'd make a lovely corpse,"
but I'll make no contribution.

58
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,648
Of course not. "Contribute only
to one's own death." That's my motto.

59
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,876
Did you get the girl? She know anything?

60
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,352
- "He'd make a lovely corpse."
- Come on, man. Charles Dickens.

61
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,315
Are you serious? It's <i>Martin Chuzzlewit.</i>

62
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,986
Smart-ass.

63
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,131
<i>New Orleans is a siren of a city.</i>

64
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,999
<i>A place of fables and illusion.</i>

65
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,495
<i>A place Lorraine had to escape from...</i>

66
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,064
<i>and Bobby and I had to escape to.</i>

67
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,970
<i>Away from Alabama...</i>

68
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,236
<i>away from lives</i>
<i>that no longer belonged to us.</i>

69
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:08,578
I thought she was getting better
that last time, I really did.

70
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,550
When was that?

71
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,220
- A few years ago, at least.
- It'll be six years, October.

72
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,727
Was it that long since we seen her?

73
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,263
Since you seen her.

74
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,228
We should have gone
to the hospital with you.

75
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,862
You should have done a lot of things.

76
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,543
Coming.

77
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,816
This Lorraine's house?

78
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,521
And who are you?

79
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,657
No one. I just live here.

80
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,066
Come on in.

81
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,943
Nice place.

82
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,484
Thanks. We try.

83
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,756
- You're not old enough to be Bobby.
- That's because I'm Lawson.

84
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,655
Okay.

85
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,338
I'm sorry about your mother.
You look a lot like her.

86
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,239
Sorry to wake you so early. It's barely noon.

87
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,375
Bobby. We got company, man. Wake up!

88
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,157
Honey, put your bags down. We don't bite.

89
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,058
- Juice?
- No.

90
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,531
- Bobby, get up. She's here.
- Who?

91
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,226
- Pursey.
- Who?

92
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,368
The girl is here. Get up.

93
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,404
So, when's the funeral?

94
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,479
It was yesterday. It was real nice.

95
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,148
You should have been there, young lady.

96
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,708
That's your opinion.

97
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,819
You must be here for some reason.

98
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,589
I guess you already know
the deal on the house.

99
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,221
What deal?

100
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,024
- The house. Your mother owned it...
- The deal!

101
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,697
Let me tell you what the deal is.

102
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,136
The deal is that
Lorraine left the three of us the house.

103
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,573
Lawson and I are two-thirds,
and you are only one-third.

104
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,705
She did what?

105
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,611
Lawson and I have been living here
for some time.

106
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,082
Your mother hasn't lived here for years.

107
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,118
And I don't believe
that she thought you'd be interested.

108
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,521
Lorraine was great at being wrong.

109
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,186
Purslane, honey, we are here to stay.
This is our home.

110
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,292
It's no big deal...

111
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:17,893
Lorraine thinking I'd share this shithole
with two alcoholic strangers.

112
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,472
You are alcoholics, aren't you?

113
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,031
But we are not strangers.
We were her friends.

114
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,737
We took care of her.

115
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,075
And this shithole is just fine for us.

116
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,683
It's not suited for a girl like you.

117
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,554
I'm getting up out of bed now.
You can watch if you want.

118
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,489
It don't matter to me.

119
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,262
It seems hard to believe...

120
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,659
that you haven't seen a man naked before.

121
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,631
Not an old one.

122
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,300
I know that you're no innocent...

123
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,437
because I spoke to that boyfriend of yours...

124
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,209
over on the Redneck Riviera.

125
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,716
You certainly didn't choose him
for his brains.

126
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,810
You don't know nothing about me.

127
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,825
I guess that will change
if we all became roommates, wouldn't it?

128
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,222
I'll see you later. I'm out of cigarettes.

129
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,230
My brand is on sale.

130
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,004
Good to see you again, Purslane.

131
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,670
All growed up.

132
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,892
He's not usually such a jackass.
He's just upset about Lorraine. We all are.

133
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,993
He's right, you know. I can't stay here.

134
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,032
It's pretty funny, actually.
My grandma was always talking about...

135
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,537
the pretty little house
Lorraine was fixing up for me...

136
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,967
and I guess
that was the Ernest & Julio talking.

137
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,409
It's fine.

138
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,713
- There's no real surprises here.
- The hospital sent her stuff.

139
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,884
Lorraine would want you to have these.

140
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,482
They went everywhere she did.

141
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,751
She loved those books.

142
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,592
I guess I could unload them
at a flea market or something.

143
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:37,106
- Here, I'll help you out.
- No, I'm fine.

144
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,049
I really did want to come to the funeral.
I just never got his message.

145
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,090
That girl looks so much like Lorraine.

146
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,863
I remember the first time
you took me to see her sing.

147
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,133
It was my first time in New Orleans.

148
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,774
I was so taken.

149
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,986
You were kind of sheltered.

150
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,280
Choked by that silver spoon.

151
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,482
I thought she was so beautiful.

152
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,756
She was.

153
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,593
What else can I get you boys?

154
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,901
Did anyone ever tell you that you smell
like a Parisian woman in springtime?

155
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,271
Every day, at least once. Y'all gonna eat?

156
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,207
The lawyer could get to her at any time.

157
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,269
So what?
The will says we can stay for a year.

158
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,476
Should I just come back?

159
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,679
Do you know how lethal the smell
of a Parisian woman in springtime is?

160
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,483
Not nearly as lethal as
a Louisiana woman who don't give a shit.

161
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:11,293
- Eggs and bacon, ma'am. Both of us.
- Cheese on our grits, darling. Please.

162
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,325
You are fucking shameless.

163
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,596
Why didn't you use the bed, sweetheart?

164
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,293
- Oh, God.
- I could have come in and cuddled with you.

165
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,728
That would have been fine with me.

166
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,965
- We could have spooned together.
- Save it.

167
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,909
Why'd you give her this?

168
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,281
This is stories of misfits...

169
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,385
invisible people. It's beautiful.

170
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,984
Have you ever read it?

171
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,459
Have you ever read any book?

172
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,826
Lorraine didn't know she was a poet.

173
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,232
I really do enjoy...

174
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,768
fostering inspiration.

175
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,701
Lawson's a writer. A fine one, too.

176
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,972
Really?

177
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,141
He's writing a book about me.

178
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,174
That's fascinating.

179
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,851
"Chapter 1:
I got up, I got drunk, I passed out.

180
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,183
- "Chapter 2: I got up, I got drunk..."
- Lovely and witty.

181
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,685
You're an embarrassment of riches,
little girl.

182
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,902
Which room is mine?

183
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,634
I'll need a place to stay,
and y'all said I had a right.

184
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,471
Just figured I'd stay here
until you get fed up and leave.

185
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,979
We are never leaving. Never!

186
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,847
- And don't even get it in your mind.
- She should have Lorraine's room.

187
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,011
- I'll stay out here. I'll bunk with you.
- Okay, fine.

188
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,782
Are you fucking crazy?

189
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,792
Better than her poking around
and finding out the truth.

190
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,795
She won't last.
You're gonna make sure of that.

191
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,932
Besides, you're always complaining
how your bed is so cold.

192
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,070
You're too skinny for me.

193
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,609
- So, y'all are really into books?
- They're mostly Bobby's.

194
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,340
- That's the plumage of an English professor.
- Him?

195
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,880
- A professor?
- Yeah, he was a good one.

196
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,379
And you, you're really a writer?

197
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,250
Bobby likes to think I am.

198
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,387
These boxes are all Lorraine's, so...

199
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,458
So what?

200
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,899
- I knew your mother pretty well.
- How well?

201
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,865
She was hard to understand,
but she kept the door to her heart open.

202
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,937
The way I heard it,
it was more of a revolving door, wasn't it?

203
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,204
Purslane Hominy Will.

204
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,706
How come you know my name?

205
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,974
I know a lot about you.

206
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,152
Your mama and I were close
since we were young.

207
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,419
I helped name you.

208
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,685
Your mama thought you were golden...

209
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,487
so we named you
after yellow flowers and corn.

210
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,085
This is you here:

211
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,034
Pretty, golden purslane.

212
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,864
Purslane's really a weed, you know.

213
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,067
A neighbor told me when I was 9
and I ran over his tomato plants.

214
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,303
He said all gardeners hate purslane.

215
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,141
Yeah, and dandelions.

216
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,912
It doesn't stop kids
from making wishes on them.

217
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,519
Purslane's an axillary bloom.

218
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,616
It closes up when the sun goes down.

219
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,121
Thanks.

220
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,239
Damn.

221
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,583
Last time I saw you, you were teeny.

222
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:17,428
Is there anyone here who doesn't remember
me with Lorraine, or am I the only one?

223
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:21,432
She used to sing here. I was about your age.
She was something.

224
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,902
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

225
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:30,672
I'll have red beans and rice
and a beer, please.

226
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,140
I hear you'll be staying
at Bobby and Lawson's for a while?

227
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,147
No, I'll be staying at Lorraine's indefinitely.

228
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,477
- Will you be starting school in September?
- No.

229
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,421
I don't go to school. I waitress.
You need one?

230
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,788
No, just me and Uncle Earl.

231
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,297
They know you're not going to school?

232
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,495
They're all torn up about it. Ranks up there
with being out of vodka and cigarettes.

233
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,773
<i>Mother, go make my bed</i>

234
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,804
<i>Make it long and narrow</i>

235
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,305
<i>My true love died for me yesterday</i>

236
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,611
<i>I shall die for him tomorrow</i>

237
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,560
<i>She was buried in the church house yard</i>

238
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,822
<i>And he was buried there beside her</i>

239
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:30,094
<i>And from his grave grew roses red</i>

240
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,429
<i>From hers grew greenbriers</i>

241
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,309
<i>They grew and they grew so very high</i>

242
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,503
<i>Till they could grow no higher</i>

243
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:48,448
<i>And at the top grew a true lover</i>'<i>s knot</i>

244
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:54,456
<i>Twined with greenbriers</i>

245
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:59,859
Y'all, this is Lorraine's daughter, Pursey.
She's gonna stay with us for a while.

246
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,892
Come on in.

247
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,227
- You grew up real pretty.
- Thank you.

248
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,328
Make yourself at home, darling.

249
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,608
I'm Ruthie. My gentleman friend, Ray.

250
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,840
Here 26 years.

251
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,906
Go on and relax, baby. Drink your beer.

252
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,644
Find anything?

253
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,013
I filled out a few applications.

254
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,986
You let that fresh young thing
live with you?

255
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,646
She's fresh, all right.

256
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,557
I remember when there was a new one
every night. Y'all was pussy magnets.

257
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,153
Which one of y'all snores
like a goddamn train?

258
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,029
Bobby. If he's on his back,
you have to turn him over.

259
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:40,834
I saw this program on the Medical Channel
that you can cure people of snoring...

260
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,067
by cutting their throats open.

261
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:53,176
I believe that I do have a story
for you gentlemen.

262
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,112
Quiet. Bobby's gonna tell a story.

263
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:00,486
When I was growing up, I always hung
around boys a couple years older than me.

264
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,124
And this one summer,
I was, I don't know, 10 or 11.

265
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,665
And we were doing all the normal things
that boys in Alabama do.

266
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,033
We were fishing...

267
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,367
and playing ball,
and swimming, and beating off.

268
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:24,114
But in addition to these activities
of an innocent childhood...

269
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,250
mine included a lot of talk...

270
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:32,314
about this wonderfully
elusive something called pussy.

271
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,583
I wasn't sure exactly what it was...

272
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,063
but I knew it was magical and very special
because of the way it was spoken about.

273
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,528
Always in a whisper.

274
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,897
I'd go through the fields
saying it to myself: "Pussy."

275
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,601
One day, we was all...

276
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,874
playing ball out in a broom sage field.

277
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,847
And up rode Leroy Tuberville.

278
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,482
Now, Leroy was
an upstanding delinquent. Twelve.

279
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:11,659
And his shoulders were already broad,
and his fingers were stained with tobacco.

280
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,899
And Leroy, he parked himself casually
by third base, and he went in his pocket...

281
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:21,934
and he pulled out something. He started
throwing it high in the air like that.

282
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,740
And I watched him play it cool...

283
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,643
his mysterious jewel going up and down.

284
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:33,046
I couldn't take it any longer. I had to ask.

285
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,245
"What's that you got there, Leroy?"

286
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,716
And everyone fell silent.

287
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:43,087
And Leroy looked at me
with that nasty sideways grin...

288
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,828
and he said,
"It's a piece of pussy, Long. My very own."

289
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,328
My face got hot, my breath quickened.

290
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:58,807
There he was, with this perfect piece of girl,
tossing her up in the air.

291
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:04,112
And I watched, knowing that I had seen God
for the first time.

292
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,611
And I wanted her for my very own.

293
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,155
But old Leroy popped his treasure
between his teeth...

294
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:16,454
jumped on his bike grinning at me,
and rode off...

295
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,622
leaving us in a cloud of dust and desire.

296
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:24,327
And it was in that tormented haze,
at the age of 10...

297
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,596
when I dedicated the rest of my life...

298
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:32,502
to finding my very own tiny piece
of love and wonder...

299
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,435
that I could carry with me for eternity.

300
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,381
All right, that's it. I'm going home.

301
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,718
To Florida?

302
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,986
Now, look, be careful.

303
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,161
"We cannot tear out
a single page of our lives...

304
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,858
"but we can throw
the whole book in the fire."

305
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,424
George Sand.

306
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,137
I thought that would be a hard one.

307
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,173
I don't feel right about lying to her.

308
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,345
What would a teenage hussy want
with this place, anyway?

309
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,284
Said herself it was a shithole.
She's better off.

310
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,586
Besides, when you sell that book,
everything will change...

311
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,852
Change?

312
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,263
We'll go to Paris, drink '61 Latour...

313
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,767
write bad poetry.
Yes, everything will be just perfect.

314
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:42,236
"We die only once,
and for such a long time."

315
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,712
Molière.

316
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,623
She's here, honey.

317
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,928
I'll take better care of her this time.

318
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,067
See you tomorrow, darling.

319
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,543
Your mama used to come here a lot.

320
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,452
Why do you talk about her so much?

321
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,822
Because I miss her, I guess.

322
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,694
Were you in love with her or something?

323
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,793
We all loved her.

324
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:42,763
- She knew how to reach people, you know?
- No, not really.

325
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,473
The night before my grandma died...

326
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,478
she warned me that
Lorraine would always be selfish.

327
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,313
She finally told me about my father.

328
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,816
She did, did she?

329
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,311
Some sax player in Memphis.

330
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,990
Pretty much a one-night stand.

331
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:06,360
I think Gran wanted me to know that when
she was gone, I'd be totally on my own.

332
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,496
She was right.

333
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,966
After she died,
I hardly ever heard from Lorraine.

334
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,571
Never even got a chance to hear her sing.

335
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:18,608
Your mama loved you, you know?
You meant the world to her.

336
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,254
She used to sit
right where you're sitting now.

337
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,954
Always writing.

338
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,957
Called this granddaddy the Tree of Life.

339
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,317
That's so corny.

340
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,970
- You're in the wrong appliance.
- What?

341
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:57,704
To succeed in killing oneself,
one must be in the oven.

342
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,376
God damn, girl. You woke up productive.

343
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:08,516
- Come see what Pursey did.
- Christ. Stop yelling.

344
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,188
I see what she didn't do: Leave.

345
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,561
She ain't gonna leave.

346
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,603
That's a really good look for you, too.

347
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,248
Good morning to y'all, too.

348
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,710
No school, I hear. What, you skip a grade?

349
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,884
A few. The 10th, 11th, and 12th.
Do you mind?

350
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,056
God, we are living under the same roof
as a goddamn dropout.

351
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,630
It takes one to mock one.
At least I can support myself.

352
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,195
Look, as long as
you're not lazing around here...

353
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,709
making Lawson lose his concentration,
I do not care what you do.

354
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,971
You got work to do.

355
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,116
Do you have to go after her
like that, relentlessly?

356
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,780
Do you want her to stick around?
Is that what you want?

357
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:15,315
Has it ever occurred to you that if we help
her get on her feet, she might move on?

358
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,084
How help her?

359
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:21,025
You want to help her out of
them tight little pants. That's what you want.

360
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,533
- Forget it, man, all right?
- Forgotten.

361
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,738
<i>A New Orleans summer</i>
<i>drowns in thick, dank stillness.</i>

362
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,351
Come on, man, let's play gin.

363
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,389
- Can't you see us doing something here?
- To hell with you.

364
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:50,120
<i>Lorraine</i>'<i>s house shrank with each</i>
<i>passing day, straining uneasy walls closer.</i>

365
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:05,008
Turn that music off, girl!
Can't you see he's working?

366
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,650
Jesus H. Christ.

367
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,718
How long you gonna sit around here
smoking up our cigarette money?

368
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,693
Lawson said he didn't mind.

369
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,095
Lawson's cigarettes are red. Mine are green.

370
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,529
You may not smoke green. Bobby's.

371
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,174
What is that shit you are drinking?
God, it reeks.

372
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,715
This is beer and tomato juice.

373
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,887
Breakfast of champions.

374
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,521
Champion fuckup, maybe.

375
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,891
You know, girl, I have had
just about enough of your bad attitude.

376
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:04,260
Whether you like it or not,
I am the senior male in this house...

377
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,200
and you will respect me!

378
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:12,407
We have been very patient
out of respect for Lorraine...

379
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,638
but you will not continue
to lay around here...

380
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,147
and play parasite to our generosity.

381
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,577
Now, you must work
as if you're gonna live 100 years...

382
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,122
and pray as if you're gonna die tomorrow.

383
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,387
- What did you say?
- Ben Franklin said it.

384
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,724
It probably meant something
coming from him.

385
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,162
You know damn well
I've been looking for a job.

386
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:38,362
God, what do you do? Except shit around
and talk about how smart you used to be.

387
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,667
I am a professor. I am a troubadour. A poet.

388
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,435
And it's none of your damn business
how we live.

389
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,740
- You are responsible for your share.
- My share?

390
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,575
You already live in my house for free.

391
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,047
- God, you should be grateful...
- This is our house!

392
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:54,846
Maybe you'd rather I earn money
bringing friends home.

393
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,320
Didn't Lorraine have to do that for a while?
Most junkies do.

394
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,118
God damn it!

395
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,285
Have you no respect for the dead?

396
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,822
That was your mother, Pursey.

397
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,134
Besides...

398
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,602
we all know
that you ain't no angel of purity...

399
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,501
are you, little Purslane?

400
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,647
Did you ever have two men at once?
Have you?

401
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,447
That would buy a lot of cigarettes
in our house. It would, wouldn't it?

402
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,317
Fuck you!

403
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,587
You're supposed to be the senior male?
The grownup.

404
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,027
I'm just a girl. Don't you get that?

405
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:43,260
I'm so sick of your high and mighty attitude
about poor, dead Lorraine.

406
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,201
You wanna teach me about respect?
Who respects you?

407
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,969
The wife who's smart enough to get rid
of you, or the kids you never fucking see?

408
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,505
What did I tell you about her?

409
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,047
Oh, God!

410
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,430
You know, I know what y'all think of me.

411
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,737
- School just seemed like a waste of time.
- It's not.

412
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,416
I know that.
I'm not some dumb kid, you know.

413
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,981
I wanna be normal. It's just not my life.

414
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,253
What is your life? What do you want?

415
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,560
If I could do anything?

416
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,059
Promise you won't laugh?

417
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,963
I don't know if I can promise.

418
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,836
Well, I thought about maybe working
in a hospital or something...

419
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:32,032
like being an x-ray technician
or something like that.

420
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,033
Okay.

421
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,740
- Can I ask why?
- I don't know.

422
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,511
I like the way bones look on a light box.

423
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,885
They're like portraits, but on the inside.

424
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,386
I know it does sound totally stupid.

425
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,527
No, it's not stupid.

426
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:06,868
Hello?

427
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,104
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

428
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,025
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

429
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,800
I keep forgetting
there's a woman in the house.

430
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:23,953
Any sign of him?

431
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,649
Listen, Pursey, I need to tell you something.

432
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,483
What, you worried about him?

433
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,262
What are you doing today?

434
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,995
I thought I'd go down to the Quarter...

435
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,595
Iook for a job. I haven't tried there yet.

436
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,807
Want someone to show you around?

437
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,692
- Give us a call next week.
- All right, thanks.

438
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,490
Well?

439
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,433
Maybe, but only part-time.

440
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,063
It's not like you have rent.
You don't have to work full-time.

441
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,835
I need to get away
from Bobby full-time. Overtime.

442
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:22,173
Maybe I could help you get started
on those bone portraits.

443
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,337
You can get your GED, you know.

444
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,242
Sure I can. Then maybe I can go to Harvard.

445
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,278
Maybe.

446
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,601
You know, you eat like shit?

447
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,669
You drink too much.

448
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:48,727
Okay.

449
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,366
Would you let me read your book sometime?

450
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,535
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

451
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,636
- Most of it ends up in the trash.
- How long you been writing it?

452
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,209
Too long, and not long enough.

453
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,152
- Did you graduate from college?
- Yes, ma'am, I did.

454
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,884
With the privilege of becoming
Bobby Long's teaching assistant.

455
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,560
Why did y'all leave that school?

456
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:16,328
It's complicated. So many reasons.

457
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,362
Tell me one.

458
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,433
A lot happened real fast...

459
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,373
and New Orleans, all this...

460
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,344
it sort of seemed romantic at the time.

461
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:32,976
Is it?

462
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,776
Is it romantic?

463
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,287
It has its moments.

464
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,160
Would you really help me get my GED?

465
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,558
Yes, I really would.

466
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,532
- Why?
- Why not?

467
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,897
Don't have anything else to do.

468
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,740
Would you quit drinking so much?

469
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,101
Why?

470
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:07,315
Why not?
You don't have anything else to do.

471
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,618
All right.

472
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,790
All right.

473
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,383
So, where is he, the son of a bitch?

474
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:45,587
Probably on some barstool somewhere,
whining about how misunderstood he is.

475
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,520
You've better things to do than waste
another day worrying about Bobby Long.

476
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,653
He didn't. We had a nice day, didn't we?

477
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:55,821
Yeah.

478
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,996
Come on, darling, we better get home.

479
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,600
See you at home.

480
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,909
It must be getting pretty crowded for you,
only two rooms.

481
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,114
What about your work, sugar?
There's no privacy there.

482
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,282
You could stay at my place.

483
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,160
Will you think about it?

484
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,934
I'm back.

485
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,333
Aren't you people glad to see me?

486
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,402
- No.
- You might have called.

487
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,807
Well, then ask me. Say:

488
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,584
"Bobby, what have you brought me?"

489
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:53,883
Biloxi?

490
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,920
Video poker or nickel slots?

491
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,361
- Man, where's my car?
- I sold it.

492
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,731
Now, Pursey, go put some music on.
We're gonna celebrate.

493
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,140
- You what?
- I sold it. We didn't need a car.

494
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:14,202
This is a single malt. When was the last time
you had a single malt?

495
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,303
- For how much?
- $300.

496
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,543
You fucking sold my car for fucking $300?

497
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,447
Have you lost
your goddamn mind completely?

498
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,042
Just hold that punch.

499
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,878
Now, you remember...

500
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,420
I have a broken face.

501
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,293
Now, I didn't have any money.

502
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,398
That's because your check is here.

503
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:39,162
And this, too. From the lawyer.
It's time to tell her.

504
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,900
I waited for you to get the...
What the fuck are you doing?

505
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:46,932
You give me five minutes,
and then you do what you think is right.

506
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,748
Well, look how nice
you changed everything.

507
00:45:55,552 --> 00:46:00,285
I'd have destroyed that TV weeks ago
if I'd known it would drive you to Steinbeck.

508
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,184
All right, now, I have something to tell y'all.

509
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,921
Come on in, sit down.

510
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,154
Come on, man, sit...

511
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:12,192
Will you stop grieving
about that hunk of shit and sit down?

512
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,531
I'll stand.

513
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,201
All right, close your eyes.

514
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,904
- Close your eyes, man.
- I'm not closing my goddamn eyes.

515
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,775
Come on, Lawson. Christ.

516
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,345
All right, now.

517
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,644
You can open them now, darling.

518
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,683
Courtesy of a lovely teacher...

519
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,694
whose heart once found Bobby Long
cause enough to skip a beat or two.

520
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:42,289
"To certify that Purslane Hominy Will...

521
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,299
"has successfully completed
the 11th grade...

522
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,133
"and is recommended to the 12th grade."

523
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,400
"Why stay we on earth except to grow?"

524
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,447
Robert Browning.

525
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,543
He's definitely your run-of-the-mill
senior-year poet.

526
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,648
Is this really your idea of an apology...

527
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:09,658
or are you just trying to one-up
his GED offer?

528
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,694
Great minds.

529
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,696
Come on, man.
Of course she takes a language.

530
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,262
- You want to speak French, don't you?
- Don't be an ass.

531
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,309
You know that
she can't take French 1 as a senior.

532
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,569
All right.

533
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:32,380
So we got English Lit, European History,
Geography, Psychology.

534
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,041
We need one more.

535
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,019
- I think Art Appreciation.
- Music.

536
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,555
- I think she'd like music.
- I'm not going.

537
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,761
Well, God damn, it's already set up.

538
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,992
Do you know how much I had to go through
for you for this?

539
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,627
For me? You expect me to...
Come on. What's in it for you?

540
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,797
Firstly, it'll get you out of the house,
for my sanity.

541
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,570
- That's what I thought.
- No, look.

542
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,607
You said something to me recently.
It got me thinking.

543
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,806
You said, "I'm just a girl."

544
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:09,610
Maybe I've grown too calloused
over the years, but you are just a girl.

545
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,347
Not unlike the students
that flowed through my classes years ago.

546
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,621
And I know that
we must seem horrible to you...

547
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:22,153
but we still got something to offer. We must.

548
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,066
And besides,
I think we owe it to your mother.

549
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,200
And as hard is it is to believe...

550
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:36,079
we, too, once were innocent children.

551
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,113
You are such a shameless ham.

552
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,280
What makes you think I could do this?

553
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,783
Because we know God, and God knows us.

554
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,188
And he and Lorraine brought you here
for a reason.

555
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,020
School starts in a month.

556
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,494
You can give us a chance. It might be fun.

557
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,394
"Fun" is a stretch, don't you think?

558
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:58,832
Listen, sweetheart,
that's one of your mama's songs.

559
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,031
That's beautiful.

560
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,838
She'd be so proud.

561
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,588
What do you think of my face?

562
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,357
See this bone? It's broken.

563
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:07,229
But you can move it.

564
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,169
How'd that happen?

565
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,170
"Never fight fair with a stranger."
Arthur Miller.

566
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,837
That happened in a fight? You lost?

567
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,683
Well, I lost a lot more than the fight.

568
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:28,287
Does it take away from my appearance,
in your opinion, miss?

569
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,453
I think you're still handsome.

570
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,424
Well, aren't y'all sweet?

571
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,367
Are you having sexual intercourse
with one another?

572
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:44,869
- Okay, Dr. Ruth, let's go.
- It's all right if you are.

573
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,541
Sex is nice.

574
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,544
Just remember to be kind to one another.

575
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:53,605
And stay young as long as you can.
Your youth is fleeting. Be kind.

576
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,782
We should start with memorization.

577
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,253
I think we should stick to
the Socratic method.

578
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:02,814
You do? Just exactly who is Plato
and who is Socrates...

579
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,088
in this arrangement?
Because I'll just stay out.

580
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,130
You are Socrates, of course.

581
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,688
- You are the Teacher.
- You're goddamn right I am.

582
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,393
I wish y'all would just shut up...

583
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:14,460
because if it's gonna be like this,
I ain't learning nothing.

584
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,268
Girl, your English is fucking atrocious.

585
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,375
Purslane Hominy, sit up.

586
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,439
Why can't I study in bed?

587
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,878
It's so hot,
and this chair is so uncomfortable.

588
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:28,543
It is not supposed to be comfortable.
It'll put your brain to sleep. Sit up.

589
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,746
- It's just bad habits.
- You're talking to me about bad habits?

590
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:34,484
Don't fuck with the Teacher, okay?

591
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:39,051
Just tell me what is Nebraska's role
in American Literature? Go.

592
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:43,327
- Shouldn't I be learning the state capitals?
- Bullshit. You'll learn what matters.

593
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,028
- Don't procrastinate.
- By whatever do you mean?

594
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,765
I don't have a card for procrastinate.

595
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,137
You are just incorrigible.

596
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,310
"Procrastinate.

597
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,040
"To drag one's ass
in such a pathetic manner...

598
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,054
"as to ensure one's place in life as a loser."

599
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,420
Hey, who are you calling a loser?

600
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,089
- Fuck.
- Go.

601
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,594
All right, Nebraska.

602
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:16,257
Home state of Willa Cather,
one of our first successful female authors.

603
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,029
Or should I move east to Missouri,
where Mark Twain...

604
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,764
alias Samuel Clemens, was born,
or down south to Kansas...

605
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,965
where William Burroughs
spent his last years?

606
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,474
- Stop!
- Hey, man...

607
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,273
I don't think they'll teach Burroughs
at Catholic school.

608
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,836
Well, they ought to.

609
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,886
Why don't you pour your old buddy a drink?

610
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,331
- We're out of juice.
- Well, what's in that glass?

611
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,063
It doesn't have a smell.

612
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:57,197
Well, God damn it,
pour some vodka in it then.

613
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,539
- Go ahead.
- We gotta quit.

614
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:05,941
I promised Pursey if she'd study.
I mean, look at us. We're worthless.

615
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,744
And when was that, that you quit?

616
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,554
Nineteen hours ago, when we were quizzing.

617
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,896
- Did you get some sleep?
- No.

618
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,767
There's no rush for her or for us...

619
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,837
so if you want to quit, take it slow.

620
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,233
Now, trust me on this.

621
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,170
Take away the bottle, take away the genie.

622
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,203
Hey, what are you doing here?

623
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,738
I just thought I'd give Lawson a break.

624
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,502
Let him use the bedroom.
Come on, sit down.

625
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,320
You look very pretty today, Purslane.

626
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,886
No one calls me that
but my dead grandmother, but thanks.

627
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,354
Now, you remember how to get there?

628
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,424
I know where it is all right,
so I guess I should be going.

629
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,262
You nervous?

630
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:08,226
No.

631
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:11,966
Yeah.

632
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,076
Want me to take the streetcar with you?

633
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,373
No, I'll be okay.

634
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,718
Well, I know you'll just do fine.

635
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,951
And we'll be right here
when you get back from school...

636
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,820
to help you with your homework.

637
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,520
Christ, you're really living
in some parallel universe.

638
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,858
Me and "homework" in the same sentence.

639
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:45,773
It's about to become you and "tardy"
in the same sentence, so...

640
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,517
Think she'll come right home?

641
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,255
Where else would a teenage girl go
but straight home...

642
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,695
to her endlessly entertaining
middle-aged roommates?

643
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:12,326
She's no picnic.
Tortures me with that noise.

644
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:17,165
That child should know
anything worth listening to is on vinyl.

645
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,272
My kids knew it.

646
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:23,276
I taught them. I was their father.

647
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:26,476
You still are.

648
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:35,354
One day they'll understand,
when you finish that book.

649
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,193
My kids don't even know me.

650
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,629
Shit, can we do anything besides this?

651
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,635
- Like what?
- Fuck if I know.

652
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,695
- We could go fishing.
- You don't fish.

653
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,934
Maybe I should start...

654
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,175
something.

655
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,044
Maybe you should start working
on your damn book.

656
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,550
I don't know the end of the story yet.

657
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,313
Checkmate. Let's get out of here.
We're depressing me.

658
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,529
You know, I wanna say something...

659
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:17,293
about life, because an unexamined life...

660
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:20,461
- is simply a life...
- Not worth living.

661
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,629
Purslane, our prodigy has returned.

662
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,731
Now, tell us everything.

663
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,675
Honey, why did you leave school early?

664
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,611
I didn't belong there.

665
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:39,621
I appreciate what y'all are doing,
but I'm not going back.

666
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,115
What?

667
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,421
I really need a job.

668
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,621
- You can work here on the weekends, sugar.
- Really?

669
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,366
- Only if you're in school, though.
- Good one, Earl.

670
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,286
<i>Autumn comes slowly in New Orleans.</i>

671
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,484
<i>The grass remains a stubborn green...</i>

672
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,118
<i>but the heat gives way to a gentle warmth.</i>

673
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,758
<i>Pursey did begin to catch on in school.</i>

674
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,495
<i>She was surprised. We weren</i>'<i>t.</i>

675
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:31,905
<i>Winter arrived before we realized</i>
<i>the sunlit hours of summer had waned.</i>

676
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,506
<i>Somehow, the wine began</i>
<i>to outlast the day...</i>

677
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,221
<i>and that was more than</i>
<i>anyone could have asked for.</i>

678
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:01,060
Someone should have told them Creoles we
got something called winter in Louisiana.

679
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,332
We might have improved
on their oversight...

680
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,874
with this cool new invention called heat.

681
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:09,101
- Pursey, where'd you put the vodka?
- You told me to hide it.

682
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,669
I did. But where did you hide it?

683
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,940
I'm not supposed to tell you, remember?

684
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,577
You don't do anything else I tell you to do.
Where is it?

685
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:20,555
Lawson, Bobby's trying to get me
to tell him where the vodka is again.

686
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:25,490
- It is Christmas.
- Whatever. It's under the back stairs.

687
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,927
And I could have sworn
it was your turn to do the laundry.

688
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,490
Don't forget to use the cuddly bear stuff.

689
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:03,457
But you aren't a virgin, are you?

690
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,165
You know, some people would call you
a disgusting old man...

691
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:08,931
for your constant sexual harassment.

692
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:12,463
I believe the term is "dirty old man,"
not "disgusting."

693
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,911
And you are a young, blooming bud.

694
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,876
- Let me live vicariously. You aren't, are you?
- Are you?

695
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,042
Well, I have children.

696
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,750
Why don't you ever see them?

697
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:28,787
Well, that's a good question.
But you haven't answered mine.

698
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:32,220
You know, I'm trying to be serious for once,
Bobby. God.

699
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:40,358
The truth is, I wish I could see them.
I miss them like hell.

700
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:46,708
It seems to me
if someone wanted to see their kids...

701
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:50,177
then they damn well would,
unless they didn't give a shit.
