1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:09,094
"Sengoku Basara"
ll

2
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:11,888
Warriors bent on conquest raised
their battle cries all across the country.

3
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,848
The one closest to conquering the country

4
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,142
"Oda Nobunaga"

5
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:16,851
was the Devil King of the
Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga.

6
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:21,815
Nobunaga ruthlessly destroyed
those who would stand in his way.

7
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:24,025
And he made no exception,

8
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,404
"0-lchi" "Azai Nagamasa"

9
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:28,363
even for his younger sister, O-lchi,
and her husband, Azai Nagamasa.

10
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:32,450
Through the actions of the Oda Army,

11
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:35,704
fear and carnage spread
across the land of the rising sun.

12
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:37,539
"Date Masamune"

13
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,040
Meanwhile, there was the
One-Eyed Dragon of Oshu, Date Masamune,

14
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:42,711
and a young Takeda warrior
of Kai, Sanada Yukimura.

15
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:45,171
These two, who recognized
each other as worthy rivals,

16
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:48,717
set out for Azuchi in order
to bring Nobunaga down.

17
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,929
The Azuchi Castle will
be the Devil King's grave!

18
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,974
We absolutely cannot hand over our
future to a compassionless general!

19
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,059
All we will offer him are prayers for the dead!

20
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:00,729
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

21
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,022
And throwing their support behind these two,

22
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:07,360
warriors from other lands
converged on Azuchi in great numbers.

23
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:12,657
From Oshu, Masamune's most
trusted vassal, Katakura Kojuro.

24
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,579
From Kai, the Tiger of Kai, Takeda Shingen,

25
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:22,208
and Shingen and Yukimura's
trusted ninja, Sarutobi Sasuke.

26
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,421
From Echigo, the War God, Uesugi Kenshin,

27
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,716
and his devoted female ninja, Kasuga.

28
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:31,259
Furthermore,

29
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:34,637
"Maeda Keiji" through the agency of the
Vagabond of the Maeda family, Maeda Keiji,

30
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,849
mobilizing from the west,
came Chosokabe Motochika

31
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:38,141
"Chosokabe Motochika"

32
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,934
and Mori Motonari. With their cooperation,

33
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:40,602
"Mori Motonari"

34
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,604
the encirclement of the Oda was complete.

35
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,608
You finish this.

36
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,860
I shall, though it may cost me my life.

37
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,780
With the aid of the other lands,

38
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:56,075
Masamune and Yukimura
succeeded in slaying Nobunaga.

39
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,464
After the fall of the Oda

40
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,174
came one who advocated for a
strong and prosperous country.

41
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,510
A warlord who plotted to
make incursions out into the world.

42
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,136
"Toyotomi Hideyoshi"

43
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,972
He and his strategist, Takenaka Hanbei,

44
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:18,848
"Takenaka Hanbei"

45
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,683
brought turbulent times
down upon them once again.

46
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,193
Masamune faced the
Toyotomi's overwhelming strength

47
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,111
and though he suffered a defeat,

48
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:35,824
he set out for Osaka in order
to make a triumphant comeback.

49
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:39,035
And under orders from Shingen,
who sensed the threat of the Toyotomi,

50
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,830
Yukimura took a military expedition westward.

51
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:46,459
Though their paths differed, these
two acting to bring down the Toyotomi

52
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:48,878
--Master Oyamada!
--overcame numerous trials and tribulations,

53
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,006
--Master Oyamada!
--and each followed the path that he believed in.

54
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:55,468
And when the Toyotomi were
about to put the finishing touches

55
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:58,263
on bringing the country under their rule,

56
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:02,851
Mori Motonari, who was allied with
the Toyotomi, moved to attempt a coup.

57
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,936
As the situation threatened
to grow even more chaotic,

58
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,689
Yukimura, with the Satsuma Army at his back,

59
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,899
successfully obliterated this menace.

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,610
Meanwhile, in the land of Odawara,

61
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,696
Masamune engaged Hideyoshi in mortal combat

62
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:18,074
--No limit!
--and just barely managed to emerge victorious.

63
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,995
Blast off!

64
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:29,168
With this, the turbulent times
appeared to come to an end,

65
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:33,047
but the Toyotomi's demise summons
the maelstrom of war for a third time.

66
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,051
Two men who served under Hideyoshi.

67
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,386
One, who seeks to rule the country

68
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,973
with his faith in the bond that
people share, is Tokugawa leyasu.

69
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,018
The other, who seeks to avenge
Hideyoshi's death against Masamune,

70
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,936
"lshida Mitsunari"
is lshida Mitsunari.

71
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,399
And amidst the tangle of ambitions

72
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:54,777
of Masamune, Yukimura,
and generals from other lands,

73
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,238
the greatest battle these
warring states had ever seen

74
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,741
was about to begin!

75
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:06,915
"End"

76
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:19,487
With the Oda destroyed and the
end of the Toyotomi era heralded,

77
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,322
the ravages of the many wars

78
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:26,035
brought upon the world of man
sorrows and regrets innumerable.

79
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,960
At times, this turned the
souls of those left behind

80
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,838
into a field of carnage burning with hellfire,

81
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:40,675
cruelly trapping what should
have been humble destinies

82
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,427
and twisting them.

83
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,390
And here, too, was one such soul.

84
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:58,651
Lord Hideyoshi... Lord Hideyoshi...

85
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:02,405
Lord... Hideyoshi!

86
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,749
One to cry out in bitter lament.

87
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:16,002
His name, lshida Mitsunari.

88
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:25,386
<i>Vie! Blazon your colors and let them run riot</i>

89
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,099
<i>The fervor to fight finds its match</i>

90
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:35,980
<i>Such is the way a bond
was forged under the banners</i>

91
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:50,328
<i>The one to carve his brilliance
will have the era to call upon</i>

92
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:54,624
"Sengoku Basara The Movie

93
00:06:55,666 --> 00:07:01,005
<i>Painted with ambition,
savagely wild as a tornado</i>

94
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,716

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,677

00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:12,266
<i>Breath bated, at the mercy of a gaze</i>

97
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,438
<i>A spark that gives no quarter closes in</i>

98
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:22,485
<i>To the heavens</i>

99
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,491
<i>Rally to the soiree of colors
and race that color to the pinnacle</i>

100
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:33,079
<i>Hurtle the storm into tomorrow</i>

101
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,960
<i>Bravo to the souls surging under the banners</i>

102
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:53,516
<i>Sprint along that moment
or your life will never ignite</i>

103
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:14,287
<i>O he who carves his
brilliance! Wake the era!</i>

104
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:30,219
I will permit no one to beg for his life!

105
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,693
L-L-Lord Mogami!

106
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,237
Our foe is not a large army!

107
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,532
What do you mean by that?

108
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,285
I-it is one man!

109
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:00,166
Here, I had thought it was a large
army, but all I get is one spindly man.

110
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:04,045
If anything, you must take
this as a favorable turn of events.

111
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,760
Gentlemen do not resort to violence!

112
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:15,014
I know all about you.

113
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,184
Come now, my dear Ando!

114
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:23,231
I don't know who you are, but let us get along.

115
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:27,568
A sign of friendship! Some brown
rice tea for us to get acquainted!

116
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:31,239
As you can see, there are even
some lucky tea stalks floating upright.

117
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,742
And I hardly think you would do anything rash,

118
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,286
given your overwhelmingly
disadvantageous position.

119
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,710
Be gone.

120
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,879
Refusal will not be tolerated.

121
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:50,508
Any who stands in my way is as guilty as he is.

122
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,635
H"He?

123
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:56,597
Have you not come here in
pursuit of none other than myself,

124
00:09:56,681 --> 00:10:00,726
Mogami Yoshiaki, the amazing
and clever Fox of Ushu?

125
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,980
Your mustache makes you look
fool enough without such drivel!

126
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,110
Yip!

127
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,362
The one I am after...

128
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,406
ls me, right?

129
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,205
Good spirit.

130
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,916
You've got guts, coming
to get revenge on your own,

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,419
Toyotomi survivor.

132
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,671
I came to welcome you.

133
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:35,094
Th-Th-Th... This is what I was waiting for!

134
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,430
I was waiting for you!

135
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:38,973
How do you like that, my dear Yamada?!

136
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,309
He is my dagger up my sleeve!

137
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,227
The One-Eyed Dragon of Oshu...

138
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,980
You haven't changed at all, old man Fox.

139
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:50,109
A teapot would be a better fit
for your sleeve than a dragon.

140
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,236
You...

141
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,156
You can do whatever you
want with that gentleman.

142
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,782
I'll wait for you.

143
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,452
I-I... I am against violence!

144
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:07,001
Lord Hideyoshi...

145
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:10,463
This man, who must be held
responsible for your death...

146
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:13,966
Your permission to annihilate him!

147
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,222
Who the hell're you?

148
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:23,059
I have no name to give you!

149
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:29,857
Marvelous!

150
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,485
Fall to ruin!

151
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,783
You will not get away with it!

152
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,744
I will not let you get away with it!

153
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,507
Not bad, but...

154
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,596
Number One of Oshu, Date Masamune.

155
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,808
Sorry, but honestly, there's only
one man in all the warring states

156
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:08,020
who can get the Dragon all fired up!

157
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,748
Cool off.

158
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,167
You won't defeat me with hatred.

159
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,711
Raise your own banner first.

160
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,505
Then, we'll talk.

161
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,758
Let's fight for the right to
rule the country. You see?

162
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,885
The country can go rot for all I care!

163
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:44,765
My greatest wish is nothing
short of making you cease to live!

164
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,609
If you want to mourn that
wild monkey boss that badly,

165
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,278
go visit his grave or something.

166
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,446
You blackguard!

167
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,322
How dare an evildoer go even further

168
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:03,534
and insult Lord Hideyoshi
by calling him vulgar names?!

169
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,245
Keep it UP-

170
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,749
Why you!

171
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,669
Accept your execution at my hands!

172
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,171
You will not get away with it!

173
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:19,008
I will not let you get away
with the crime you committed!

174
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:23,804
Date Masamune!

175
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:35,024
II Bill

176
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:39,737
You have been all that I
expect of my lifelong archrival.

177
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,532
I admit complete defeat, Tiger of Kai.

178
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,242
Thanks to you,

179
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,703
this half of my life has been
filled with a sense of purpose.

180
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:51,457
You have my heartfelt gratitude, Kenshin.

181
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:59,673
I shall entrust the future
of Echigo to the Tiger of Kai.

182
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:04,303
You are all to put your faith in this
man and make every effort to serve him.

183
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,055
Is that understood?

184
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,316
<i>My lord!</i>

185
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,110
Bear close witness, Yukimura.

186
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:24,865
Someday, such a time will
likely come for you as well.

187
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,534
Yes, Sir!

188
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:36,627
This is goodbye, my beautiful blade.

189
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:41,715
Farewell, Kenshin.

190
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,265
Lord Shingen!

191
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,570
That is...

192
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,698
...Lord Tokugawa leyasu!

193
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,326
You must not sever this bond, Lord Shingen!

194
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,708
Lord Tosho...

195
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,253
Is that you, Takechiyo?

196
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,879
I am sorry I have not kept in touch.

197
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:25,342
You have grown so much.

198
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,303
I had thought so, but...

199
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,681
Even then, you are still a large man.

200
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,726
I am glad to see that you
are looking better than ever.

201
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,688
You look well, Sanada Yukimura.

202
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,983
It has been a long time, Lord leyasu.

203
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,779
Today, I have come to relay my intentions

204
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:50,367
to none other than you, Lord
Shingen, and you, Lord Kenshin.

205
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:55,539
I, Tokugawa leyasu,

206
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:58,626
have hardened my resolve to
unite the land of the rising sun

207
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,253
with the strength of the
bonds that people share!

208
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,717
"This will be the last time."

209
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,970
All have said so and all have believed it.

210
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:13,974
And thus, to this day, we have done
the same thing over and over again.

211
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:17,394
But no matter who comes to rule this country,

212
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,313
someone else is sure to appear

213
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,066
to plunge the world into
the chaos of war once again.

214
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:27,154
This world where those who believe
in the future cannot live the future...

215
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:30,074
I want to end it this time, once and for all!

216
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,950
Therefore, you have led the way yourself,

217
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,828
removing your headpiece
and discarding your spear.

218
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:35,871
Indeed.

219
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,415
Rather than that the time is finally right,

220
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:42,461
what you are saying is that
we can no longer afford to wait...

221
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,797
That is exactly right, Lord Shingen.

222
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,426
Waiting any longer is the same
as wishing for this country's ruin.

223
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,387
Rather than the time being right,

224
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,265
one could say that we
have nearly missed our chance.

225
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,768
Tiger of Kai and War God of Echigo,

226
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,187
the two of you share a deep bond.

227
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,690
If you would work hand-in-hand
and lend me your support,

228
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,025
nothing would be more heartening!

229
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,614
Leyasu,

230
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,908
I understand how you feel,

231
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,869
but I doubt there are
any who would heed you.

232
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,082
It is true.

233
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,167
If it were easy to gain support for this cause,

234
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,212
everyone would have done so
from the start instead of going to war.

235
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,047
The only two who have listened to me

236
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:31,510
are the Maeda Vagabond, who came
to see me after hearing some rumors,

237
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,638
and the Ogre of the Western Sea.

238
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:37,933
But even so, I...

239
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,406
M-My lord!

240
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,496
Then show me that you can make it so.

241
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:07,087
Thank you, Lord Shingen. Lord Kenshin.

242
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,590
Let us meet again, Sanada.

243
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,284
<i>My lord!</i>

244
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,786
What do you want?

245
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:43,207
Takeda's territory is expanding and
I am about to become busier than ever.

246
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,544
There is a matter that
I wish to bring to you, my lord!

247
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:48,921
Speak.

248
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:49,922
Yes, Sir!

249
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:56,303
Since returning from my journey
to Satsuma and my battle with Mori,

250
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,181
I have felt something lurking in my heart.

251
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:04,728
But it was nothing more
than an elusive, vague feeling

252
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,189
and I struggled to put it into words.

253
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:12,277
And yet, Lord leyasu
expressed it through his very actions!

254
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,408
You are soft, Yukimura.

255
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,244
I must beg your forgiveness.

256
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,163
Nonetheless, living in this war-torn world,

257
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,957
everyone has given up on it to begin with...

258
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,709
No, it is something that
no one would even attempt...

259
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:32,506
And Lord leyasu is trying to
achieve it with his fists alone.

260
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:38,136
His incomparable resolve has
set my heart hopelessly ablaze!

261
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,520
For the sake of the future,

262
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:50,691
you have trained and honed
your skills with the spears.

263
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,861
Do you claim to be prepared,
as of this day, to put them down?

264
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,529
Yes, Sir!

265
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,408
Yukimura!

266
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,534
Yes, Sir!

267
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,120
For you, that is how...!

268
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,955
Yes, Sir!

269
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,001
That is how it should be, Yukimura!

270
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,343
My lord...

271
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,721
Now that makes you a real warrior.

272
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,431
After all that you have been through,

273
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,308
that is no longer thoughtless
youthful enthusiasm.

274
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:28,061
That is the way a true
human being ought to be.

275
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,731
It is the duty of one who clears the way

276
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,400
and forges the future on behalf of all of us!

277
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,111
M-My lord!

278
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,739
Only now that you have been plunged
into the depths of agony many times

279
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,575
and persisted in being a diligent student...

280
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,660
Only now that you have acquired

281
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:46,872
the spirit, skills, and strength
of a warrior beyond compare,

282
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,665
are you and leyasu

283
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:52,377
capable of attempting to
undertake this. Know that.

284
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,304
I understand, Sir!

285
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,389
<i>My lord!</i>

286
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,392
Yukimura!

287
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,272
<i>My lord!</i>

288
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,483
Yukimura!

289
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,110
<i>My lord!</i>

290
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,905
Yukimura!

291
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,659
<i>My lord!</i>

292
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,869
Yukimura!

293
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,383
Hold on a second! This is getting dangerous!

294
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,307
My... lord!

295
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,185
Yuki... mura!

296
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,047
<i>My lord!</i>

297
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,633
<i>My lord!</i>

298
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,139
Yukimura...

299
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:35,397
I, Takeda Shingen, have imparted
to you all that I have to impart.

300
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,694
You have surpassed the
man who defeated the War God.

301
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:46,158
I have entrusted you, beyond all
doubt, with the spirit of the Tiger.

302
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:49,327
Yuki... mura...

303
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:54,041
My lord! My lord!

304
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,376
<i>My lord!</i>

305
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,213
I feel like he could've just settled
this by retiring like a normal lord.

306
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,381
Sasuke!

307
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,550
There's trouble brewing all over the place.

308
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:07,137
So, I guess I can make my
report to you, Commander?

309
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,521
"Oshu"

310
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:17,230
Lord Masamune!

311
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:21,068
You ordered us to ready for war
and then left. Where have you been?

312
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:24,071
The unidentified enemy
force that has set foot in Oshu

313
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:27,074
must be intercepted before it
gets through Mogami territory...

314
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:30,410
The enemy was one man, Kojuro.

315
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:31,369
What?!

316
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,579
One man?

317
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,414
It was no big deal.

318
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,125
I politely asked him to take his leave.

319
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:42,422
He was a guy all worked up,
driven by vengeance. A surviving...

320
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:45,550
...member of... the Toyotomi...

321
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,436
Lord Masamune!

322
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,868
N-Number One...

323
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,662
Number One...

324
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:18,667
Number One!

325
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,531
Have you tired of your
meandering stroll, Mitsunari?

326
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,500
Date Masamune...

327
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:03,628
I do not mind being belittled myself.

328
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,172
However,

329
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:09,259
carving up the bastard who
slighted Lord Hideyoshi with impunity

330
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,344
would be meaningless!

331
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,849
Through my presence,

332
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,852
he further profaned the
memory of Lord Hideyoshi!

333
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:23,106
I must vindicate his honor
before I execute that bastard!

334
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:29,404
I doubt many take the words
of strangers to heart as you do.

335
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:33,325
Whatever it is you wish to say,
speak briefly and plainly, Gyobu.

336
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,869
There is no knowing what foul
trick the One-Eyed Dragon used

337
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:39,331
to send the Elder Regent to his grave,

338
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,876
but declaring that he would not
fight a man who has no army at his back

339
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,838
may have been an
expedient excuse. That is all.

340
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:49,132
You may have failed to bring him down,

341
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,927
but you sensed your superiority
and that sense must remain with you.

342
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,846
Are you unable to put stock in that?

343
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,141
If that were true...

344
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:00,352
Then it would be even more unforgiveable!

345
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:06,149
It would mean the brazen weakling
played Lord Hideyoshi for a fool!

346
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:11,279
You need not go to the trouble of
leading an army to face a weak man.

347
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:15,408
Better to prod your opponent to
act and wait for him to come to you.

348
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:18,161
I would make the preparations.

349
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,538
I will leave it all to you.

350
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,041
Do you not wish to hear the stratagem?

351
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,961
I have no reason to question your actions.

352
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,421
Fine, understood.

353
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:32,259
All for the sake of master and justice.

354
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:46,439
"All for One, One for All, for Peace and Harmony"

355
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,256
Lord Masamune, you must
not move so vigorously yet.

356
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,800
Did you find out who that bastard was?

357
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,302
Yes, Sir.

358
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,053
Ishida Mitsunari.

359
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,973
After he attempted to invade Oshu on his own,

360
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:23,685
it appears he is now leading
an army, attacking various lands.

361
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,353
I am told he not only kills soldiers,

362
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:29,149
but mercilessly slays the
people, who are unarmed.

363
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:32,902
After which, he leaves his
banner behind as if to flaunt it.

364
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,904
Wholesale murder, huh?

365
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:38,408
Generals everywhere are
now nervous and terrified.

366
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,494
Reports say they fear
and abhor lshida Mitsunari,

367
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,788
referring to him as
"The Great Malevolent Sansei."

368
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:45,999
Kojuro.

369
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,459
Yes, Sir.

370
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,669
I'm going out there to defeat lshida.

371
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,010
That time, I threw up a
smokescreen with empty talk.

372
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,970
I, the One-Eyed Dragon,

373
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:02,098
tucked my tail between my legs
and fled in the face of the enemy!

374
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,356
It just means that the world is vast.

375
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,273
Eh?

376
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,442
There was the assassin driven
by the need for vengeance

377
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,527
and then there was the way
you assessed and dealt with it,

378
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,571
by retreating instead of fighting needlessly.

379
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,074
As the man carries the
weight of Oshu on his shoulders,

380
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,451
it is entirely consistent with your duties.

381
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:26,289
I did criticize you for acting
rashly and going alone, but...

382
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:29,709
Thanks to that, this land
has escaped devastation

383
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:33,213
and both the soldiers and the people
carry on with their days as always.

384
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,258
Never ever think

385
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:41,262
that only one who has mastered
the sword can rule the country.

386
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,473
There is not the slightest reason

387
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:47,894
that you should feel
responsible for lshida's later deeds.

388
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,688
I'm the one who baited him,

389
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:54,067
telling him to come
again under his own banner.

390
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,569
I have to finish what I started there.

391
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:59,739
In that case, just one thing.

392
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:04,702
Next time, I will not let you go alone.

393
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:16,923
The Great Malevolence, huh?

394
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:21,094
It's true, that bastard was crazy.

395
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,679
But...

396
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,978
What was with that clarity in his eyes?

397
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,318
The force believed to be the lshida Army

398
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,362
had just begun its covert maneuvers,

399
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,282
but in the meantime, in the hopes of
advocating to generals from all lands

400
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,868
and bring about the end of this
era of war as quickly as possible,

401
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:50,290
Tokugawa leyasu, Maeda Keiji,
and Chosokabe Motochika

402
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:54,544
were about to set out on an
all-out cross-country circuit.

403
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,054
Leyasu.

404
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:10,643
Why do you make no move to avenge
Lord Hideyoshi's death with me?!

405
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,354
How could you think no more of the
kindness Lord Hideyoshi showed you

406
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,356
and leave the Toyotomi?

407
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,818
Lord Hideyoshi was too obsessed with strength.

408
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:23,448
If the Toyotomi had gone on to take
the horrors of war out into the world,

409
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:26,034
an even greater number
of people would have died

410
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,328
and been consigned to sorrow.

411
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:32,123
You were by their side
and what did you even see?

412
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,877
Lord Hideyoshi worked to keep
the land of the rising sun from ruin!

413
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,463
To protect this country's pride!

414
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:42,842
That is why he tirelessly
fought and sought to grow strong!

415
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,677
Listen to me, Mitsunari.

416
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:48,765
I have seen examples set by
more great men than anyone else.

417
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,142
And there is something I have learned.

418
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:55,313
Ironic as it is, that
something wasn't valor in arms.

419
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:00,360
One's strength is there to remain unused.

420
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:02,278
Strength for the sake of
protecting the bonds that people share.

421
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:06,866
Strength that you acquire and hone
single-mindedly, never to be used.

422
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,619
That is true military might.

423
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:14,374
Of all people, that is what I should
have relayed to Lord Hideyoshi.

424
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:17,544
And that I did not is my crime.

425
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:20,547
It may have kept Lord Hideyoshi from his death.

426
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,675
Do not be so conceited, leyasu!

427
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:27,178
Your pompous preaching disgusts me!

428
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,514
You are not Lord Hideyoshi!

429
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,975
What can you possibly
accomplish with your bare fists?!

430
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:37,605
Face my sword stained with
bitter tears and show me that!

431
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:42,110
I came to talk to you, Mitsunari!

432
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:45,947
As my friend, I want
your understanding first!

433
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,908
I have nothing to discuss with you.

434
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,077
I have no friends!

435
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,579
Why do you think so?

436
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:56,291
Just as Lord Hideyoshi had
Lord Hanbei, you also have...

437
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:58,918
Do not speak of them so lightly!

438
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,504
The bond between Lord
Hideyoshi and Lord Hanbei

439
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,757
was so deep, no mere
mortal could ever comprehend!

440
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,051
That's right! A bond!

441
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,430
Those two shared a deep bond.

442
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:13,057
So did Lord Hideyoshi and Keiji.

443
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,227
Maeda Keiji...

444
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,563
His was the act of folly to stand in the way

445
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,648
as Lord Hideyoshi set out for Odawara.

446
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,442
He deserves a thousand deaths for that!

447
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:24,235
Such supreme self-righteousness!

448
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,280
I will execute him after Date Masamune!

449
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:29,574
I do not believe so!

450
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:32,827
Keiji's act of placing his faith in the
bond he shared with Lord Hideyoshi

451
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,788
is an example for us all
to live by in the future!

452
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,669
Do not glorify someone
who defied Lord Hideyoshi.

453
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,130
Do not speak of Lord Hideyoshi as the past!

454
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,758
Lord Hideyoshi was the
one who should have lived on,

455
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:51,304
clearing the way to the future with his
strength, and forging what was to come next!

456
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:55,099
Lord Hideyoshi was everything to me!

457
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,851
Mitsunari!

458
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:04,484
I refuse to engage in further dialogue.

459
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,944
That man who stole away Lord Hideyoshi...

460
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,364
I will never let him get away with it.

461
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:11,616
I will hold the whole world responsible

462
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:14,911
for trying to consign
Lord Hideyoshi to oblivion!

463
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:32,720
A beautiful field of flowers...

464
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,269
Once I get lots of flowers to bloom,

465
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:43,981
he said something
really wonderful will happen.

466
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:49,237
So lchi will work hard to get them to bloom.

467
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,948
My brother is smiling, too.

468
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,450
He must be happy-

469
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,887
This is so good.

470
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:16,305
Yes.

471
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,726
Let us gather more and more, Lady O-lchi.

472
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:23,688
I-I'm scared, Venerable Tenkai.

473
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:26,649
You are so easily frightened, Kingo.

474
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,569
You will be fine as long as you
chant some prayers to Amitabha.

475
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,696
If it's prayers, you chant
them, Venerable Tenkai.

476
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,322
You're a priest, aren't you?

477
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,741
Not to worry.

478
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:37,285
I will hold a service for them all later.

479
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:39,328
Is all going to plan?

480
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:42,957
D-Don't scare me like that, Otani!

481
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:47,253
Everything will be ready shortly.

482
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,589
How are things on your end?

483
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:53,092
Mitsunari says he does not question me.

484
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:57,805
You must be ever so friendly
with the Great Malevolence.

485
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:02,226
Trust is not something one comes by easily.

486
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,439
The things I do are bound
to be in his interest as well.

487
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:11,235
It is merely that Mitsunari
does not question this.

488
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,113
Lady O-lchi, the Devil
King of the Fifth Heaven,

489
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:16,866
and lshida Mitsunari, the Great Malevolence...

490
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,952
For the purposes of
the true feast that I crave

491
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,747
and the ruin that you desire,

492
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,625
they are the best instruments one could ask for.

493
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,043
For the finishing touches,

494
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:28,377
we have Kingo here.

495
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,171
What?!

496
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,673
<i>Okay -</i>

497
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,223
Just wait for us, Number One!

498
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:44,727
Number One!

499
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,313
Let's shake it up!

500
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,736
Yoshinao?!

501
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:00,660
Hey...

502
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:01,994
Y-Yoshinao...

503
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,704
Where did you hit yourself?

504
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:06,707
A c-crow?

505
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,301
What?!

506
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,886
Hey, long time no see.

507
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,555
Keiji!

508
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,517
What are you doing here?

509
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,936
I'm here for a quick visit
with the One-Eyed Dragon.

510
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,229
Is he doing good?

511
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:31,566
Number One says he's going to finish
what he started with lshida Mitsunari.

512
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:34,360
We're about to go chase after him.

513
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:37,822
Once we defeat lshida, we're
going to go take down Tokugawa, too!

514
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:38,865
What?

515
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:42,368
Number One feels responsible.

516
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,246
The lshida Army's rampaging all over the place

517
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,748
and now, even the
Tokugawa are getting in on it...

518
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:50,501
I've heard the rumors, too,

519
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:54,380
but there's no way leyasu
would do something like...

520
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,050
Hey, what's that you
got stuck in your head?

521
00:36:58,134 --> 00:36:59,719
Huh?

522
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,723
Wh-What's that doing there?!

523
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:05,224
This is...

524
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:08,060
...a letter addressed to Number One.

525
00:37:08,144 --> 00:37:09,562
It's from Tokugawa leyasu!

526
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,230
What?!

527
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:13,941
I'm going to take a quick look.

528
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,192
Oh, wait!

529
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,111
But uh, that's...

530
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,487
It's addressed to Number One...

531
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,281
That's a bad idea!

532
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,700
This is...!

533
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:27,413
"I am Tokugawa leyasu.

534
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:30,041
I am someone who sincerely
wishes to rule this country

535
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,126
with the strength of the bonds we share.

536
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,380
I have traveled the length
and breadth of the entire country

537
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:39,383
and advocated to all the
value of the bonds people share.

538
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:45,848
But unfortunately, not one
would take me up on my proposal.

539
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:50,853
No matter how much the
frequent wars have sapped our strength

540
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:55,066
and how many times we experience
the grief of losing loved ones,

541
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:57,944
in this land of the rising sun

542
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:01,405
there are none who will put
their faith in the strength of bonds.

543
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:05,034
The reality of that fact has
become painfully clear to me now.

544
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:08,287
Therefore, I have no choice
but to change my methods.

545
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,122
Though it pains me,

546
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,249
it is precisely because
I refuse to compromise my ideals

547
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,461
that I have decided to resort to force.

548
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:19,382
Ishida Mitsunari is currently
on an unfettered rampage

549
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:23,928
and I believe you now see that the
Tokugawa are capable of the same.

550
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:26,639
Perhaps this land of the rising sun,

551
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,266
filled with people too
small-minded to work hand-in-hand,

552
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:34,146
would be better off being destroyed
along with the brutal lshida Army.

553
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,649
Such are the thoughts
that I have begun to entertain.

554
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:42,863
However, I also know
that this is too rash of me.

555
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:46,826
So, I would like to speak with
all of you just one more time.

556
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:52,081
To that end, I want you to all
gather at dawn on September 15th

557
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:55,918
at Sekigahara in Mino.

558
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:58,504
To every warrior who fears for the
future of the land of the rising sun,

559
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:00,798
where we were born and raised.

560
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:04,135
Tokugawa leyasu."

561
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:11,350
I still find it impossible that Lord
leyasu would commit such violence!

562
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:14,812
After he toured the various
lands trying to reconcile the country

563
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,647
and got completely ignored,

564
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,899
maybe he decided on brute force, after all.

565
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:20,943
That's the rumor going around.

566
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:23,738
Well, you'd normally find it fishy, right?

567
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:27,158
Suddenly bringing up shared
bonds and stuff in this day and age.

568
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:29,452
That is not true!

569
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,746
No...

570
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,374
Regrettably...

571
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:39,378
I can imagine that thoughts along
those lines must be all too common.

572
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:42,715
But that does not mean that
Lord leyasu would do such a...

573
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:47,261
The brushstrokes on this
letter are a dead ringer, but...

574
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,889
There's something about this that smells...

575
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,557
It is definitely suspicious.

576
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,850
That is why...

577
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:56,645
No, it's kind of a tasty smell, actually...

578
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:59,398
Like the smell of hot pot or...

579
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,860
H-Hot pot?

580
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,531
What bothers me is that

581
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:11,077
the ninja squads I dispatched to
various areas haven't spotted a thing

582
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,705
and yet, the sneak attacks
keep happening over and over.

583
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:17,708
No one has seen a likely force on the move,

584
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:22,963
but some place is attacked and
overrun practically every night.

585
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:27,093
Do they have some unprecedented weapon?

586
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:31,639
Either way, I cannot believe it is
something Lord leyasu would do.

587
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:37,478
Lord Masamune!

588
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,150
Long time no see.

589
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:46,320
Where are you going looking
all worked up, Sanada Yukimura?

590
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,780
It has been a long time.

591
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:52,284
I am currently on my way
to see Lord Tokugawa leyasu.

592
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,329
It's so like you to be
driven by moral indignation.

593
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,623
I hear he's grown pretty formidable.

594
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,792
You just watch yourself over there.

595
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,752
Oh, no, that is not it...

596
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:04,964
I'm off to break things up for lshida Mitsunari.

597
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,133
I was going to turn
right back around after that,

598
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:10,136
but if that's the case,
I'll leave leyasu to you.

599
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:11,554
Lord Masamune...

600
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:16,517
I heard you've taken over for old man Tiger.

601
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,977
Indeed.

602
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,478
Excellent.

603
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:20,980
Once we've each taken care of business,

604
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:24,150
let's throw a party to settle
things while we're celebrating.

605
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:27,027
I would like nothing more than
to settle the matter between us.

606
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:31,657
However, on this occasion, it is
not my mission to destroy leyasu.

607
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,784
Eh?

608
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,453
I am going in order to make certain.

609
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:39,999
That the one devastating other
lands, as if to imitate the lshida Army,

610
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:44,712
and making veiled threats to bring
us generals together at Sekigahara

611
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,506
is not Lord leyasu.

612
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,092
Sekigahara, you say?

613
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:54,138
There's something I want
to check on with lshida, too.

614
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:58,142
Though, either way, it won't
change the fact that we'll be fighting.

615
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:12,531
Let's meet again,

616
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:14,700
Sanada Yukimura.

617
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:30,007
Come to think of it,

618
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:34,220
this is where you and
I fought for the first time, isn't it?

619
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,889
You are right.

620
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:41,769
How about it? What do you
say to settling things right now?

621
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,437
What are you say...

622
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:46,941
Lord Masamune!

623
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:51,320
If we hadn't met in this place,
I could've resisted the urge, but...

624
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:56,492
In my beef with that bastard,
there's no cool or hot.

625
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,204
One of us will win and one of us will die!

626
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,581
It's a death match dripping with animosity!

627
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,458
Had no choice!

628
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:07,670
That's why I want to
have this fight with you now!

629
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:10,256
Sanada Yukimura!

630
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:13,926
Lord Masamune...

631
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,097
Commander!

632
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:21,558
If I do not accept, it will
surely become a lifelong regret!

633
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,811
That is what my instincts tell me!

634
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:20,409
Death Bite!

635
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,703
Great Wheel!

636
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:27,041
Who are you?!

637
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:29,335
What's the big idea, Vagabond?!

638
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:32,171
What are you two doing out here?!

639
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:35,174
The country's fate hangs in the balance!

640
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:37,343
Sorry, but this is none of your business!

641
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:38,093
Move aside!

642
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:42,014
I know full well I'm butting in.
But I'm not backing down.

643
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:48,896
Please do not interfere!

644
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:52,941
Whoa-oh!

645
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:57,696
Shit!

646
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,365
Heads UP!

647
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:09,958
I understand how you feel,

648
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:13,128
but this is as far as it
goes for you two right now.

649
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:18,384
You are...

650
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,803
I'm Maeda Keiji.

651
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,554
This guy here's Yumekichi.

652
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:25,432
You're the one who always gets the
One-Eyed Dragon looking all keen.

653
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:27,518
Sanada Yukimura of Kai.

654
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:28,936
Isn't that right?

655
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:31,146
How about it?

656
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,525
Until the murkiness hanging over
this country gets all cleared up,

657
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:38,904
what do you say to letting me
declare this match postponed?

658
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:43,575
Oh, that's right.

659
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:46,829
To me, you're always the goal at the end.

660
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:50,332
And I'd almost forgotten about that.

661
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,793
You've got my thanks, softie.

662
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:56,755
What a refreshingly plainspoken gentleman!

663
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:59,174
I shall wait, Master Maeda.

664
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:01,552
Lord Masamune.

665
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:05,597
"Lord Date Masamune"

666
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:11,854
"Lord Date Masamune"

667
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:12,521
Looks like I don't need to read it.

668
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:13,981
I just have to go to Sekigahara

669
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:18,444
to find out what's going on
right now, who's behind it, and why.

670
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:20,571
Sounds like the plan
that'll get me everything.

671
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:22,239
Yeah, probably.

672
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:26,201
Chosokabe Motochika, who should
be traveling around out west about now,

673
00:46:26,285 --> 00:46:28,454
and leyasu should both
be rushing over there, too.

674
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:32,958
Sounds like it's going
to be one hell of a party.

675
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,294
If that lshida bastard's the ringleader,

676
00:46:35,377 --> 00:46:38,130
I'll get to straighten things
out smack in the middle of it all.

677
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:39,798
Number One.

678
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:42,509
Here...

679
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,305
What's this?

680
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:50,809
All of us in the Date Army
discussed it and we want you to use it.

681
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:55,898
You may get angry,

682
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:59,485
but we got permission from
Master Katakura and made it in a hurry.

683
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:03,989
The old blacksmith was real stern
about giving us his stamp of approval,

684
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:06,241
so it took us longer than we wanted, but...

685
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:08,994
This is for your fight with lshida...

686
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:15,209
The Great Malevolence, lshida Mitsunari...

687
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:17,377
Is he that powerful?

688
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:20,214
--Number One!
--Number One!

689
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:21,798
Please accept it!

690
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,968
Lord Masamune.

691
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:27,346
Lord Masamune, your life...

692
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:30,140
...is the life of everyone of Oshu!

693
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,121
Not bad.

694
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:58,627
It's a cool accessory. I'll be wearing it.

695
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:07,261

P Open your gates, land and shrine of roots. <i>P</i>

702
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,285
Kingo.

703
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:36,582
I have unfortunate news.

704
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:38,875
Huh? What? What is it?

705
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:41,670
Everyone has found out

706
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:45,674
that you forged those letters
in Tokugawa leyasu's name.

707
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:47,301
What?!

708
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:49,928
The generals are quite angry

709
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:52,097
and once they reach Sekigahara,

710
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,892
it seems they have decided to
kill Kobayakawa Hideo first thing.

711
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:58,812
I-Is that true?! It's not, right?!

712
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:03,650
I did like you said, Venerable Tenkai,
so everyone would get along...

713
00:49:03,734 --> 00:49:09,031
I know your desire for peace better than anyone.

714
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:14,119
But warriors driven by anger are
beyond the control of a mere priest.

715
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:17,122
G-Get it in your control!

716
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,583
I feel sorry for you that
they will gang up on you

717
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,251
and torture you to death,

718
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:22,878
but I doubt that you can avoid it.

719
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,672
D-Don't say that!

720
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,969
Well, let me think...

721
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:33,764
Why not treat them to some hot pot?

722
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:44,983
This endless darkness...

723
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:47,986
Though I may carve death into his flesh,

724
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,781
it will never be banished.

725
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:55,452
What awaits me there is
unvarnished nothingness.

726
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:59,039
My second death!

727
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,419
Mitsunari.

728
00:50:07,089 --> 00:50:10,717
Wield your strength to your heart's content.

729
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:15,806
Let us pry open the world together!

730
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:32,489
Are you ready, guys?!

731
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,199
Yeah!

732
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,118
Don't slack off!

733
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:37,369
Step on it!

734
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:39,121
Yeah!

735
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:41,832
All right, let's ride on!

736
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:44,918
Yeah!

737
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:46,753
Ishida Mitsunari,

738
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:51,216
if you really are the one
waiting in the middle of all this,

739
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:54,886
this time, I'll be the one
to hold you responsible!

740
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:23,331
Uh, um...

741
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:25,000
Well...

742
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:35,969
Th-They're all mad!

743
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:43,018
I-I'm scared! What should
I do, Venerable Tenkai?!

744
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,612
Leyasu...

745
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:57,240
Kingo, so it was you.

746
00:51:57,324 --> 00:52:00,327
I'm sorry, leyasu. I...

747
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:04,539
I see. It's okay, Kingo.

748
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:07,709
I know you didn't mean any harm.

749
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:10,212
So don't be scared anymore.

750
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:12,923
You watch the pot for me.
Let's serve it to everyone.

751
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:15,050
O-Okay!

752
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:27,479
I am Tokugawa leyasu!

753
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,523
I am grateful to you for
responding to my appeal

754
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:32,192
and for gathering here today!

755
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:33,860
Thank you!

756
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:37,113
Everyone gathered here

757
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:40,951
have personally witnessed two
great powers, the Oda and the Toyotomi,

758
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:43,829
and how frightful they were.

759
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:48,124
And I believe it is now carved
deep in our bones that military might

760
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,502
is something that severs
the bonds that we share.

761
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:52,045
Leyasu...

762
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:53,839
I see!

763
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:57,342
Only those who demonstrate their
strength rise to power and survive.

764
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,135
That is our war-torn era.

765
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:03,014
But at that rate, the fighting will never end.

766
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:09,563
We have seen the downfall of those
who rely only on their strength, twice!

767
00:53:09,646 --> 00:53:12,190
There shouldn't be anyone
here who wields their strength

768
00:53:12,274 --> 00:53:14,568
in the hopes of engineering their downfall!

769
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:18,029
I'm Maeda Keiji of Kaga!

770
00:53:18,113 --> 00:53:22,158
Do you know why you all are so strong?

771
00:53:22,242 --> 00:53:24,035
It's to protect your sweethearts.

772
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:25,704
Having the homeland you grew up in

773
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:28,415
and the priceless things
you value taken from you...

774
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:31,626
How about we put a stop to all that?

775
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:37,048
I am Sanada Genjiro Yukimura
of the Takeda of the land of Kai.

776
00:53:37,132 --> 00:53:39,175
I have been on numerous battlefields

777
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:43,847
and I have fiercely crossed
swords with countless warriors.

778
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,558
The end to which warlords
bring to bear their valor in arms...

779
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,561
The thing they have their sights
set on after the country is theirs...

780
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,605
That, for everyone alike, is peace.

781
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:56,026
With the hearts of true warriors,
devoid of private ambitions or greed,

782
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,570
let us join together with
Lord leyasu and Master Maeda

783
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:02,282
and seize this moment to
speak in earnest of the future!

784
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:03,825
Sanada“.

785
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:09,122
Let us protect the bonds we already share

786
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:10,540
and forge new bonds

787
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:13,335
with our former foes and
those who were unknown to us,

788
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:15,045
and grow from there.

789
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:18,006
Come, let us all share Kingo's hot pot

790
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,425
and speak of a world at peace.

791
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:23,094
--Sanada Yukimura...
--Maeda Keiji of Kaga, huh?

792
00:54:23,178 --> 00:54:25,055
It's the Tiger of Kai...

793
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,292
Wait!

794
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:55,961
Hold up for one second!

795
00:54:56,044 --> 00:54:57,462
Before we do this,

796
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:03,134
let's get to the bottom of who was
leading all those raids everywhere!

797
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:21,528
Ishida Mitsunari...

798
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:22,821
It's the Great Malevolence!

799
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:25,115
It's the Great Malevolent Sansei!

800
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:28,493
Mitsunari, I've been waiting for you!

801
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:31,621
Come over here and you
talk to everyone for me, too!

802
00:55:31,705 --> 00:55:35,083
Do as you please. Do not draw me into it.

803
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,836
A true shared bond is a miracle.

804
00:55:37,919 --> 00:55:40,964
The resentment and hatred of
one who has been robbed of that joy

805
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:44,926
will never be erased by the kind of
sugarcoated words that you spew!

806
00:55:54,102 --> 00:55:55,478
"All for One, One for All, for Peace and Harmony"

807
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:05,864
Mitsunari!

808
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:08,700
So you <i>were</i> in collusion after all!

809
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:11,619
We've been deceived by Tokugawa and lshida!

810
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:14,914
Why you! We almost fell for it!

811
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:17,792
Hold on! That's not how it is!

812
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:39,731
What foolishness.

813
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:44,110
Bonds are nothing more than invisible threads.

814
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:47,030
Man cannot help but quarrel with one another.

815
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:50,492
To fight this natural
order is the act of a fool.

816
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:54,245
To all of you pawns who have
gathered here at Sekigahara,

817
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:58,583
cut down every last unfamiliar face you see!

818
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:01,377
Anyone with a different banner is your enemy!

819
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:03,755
Be the last one standing
and the country will be yours!

820
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,259
This is the battle that shall
determine the fate of the country!

821
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:12,347
That is Mori Motonari!

822
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,725
I am not one to be slain
by a mere sacrificial pawn.

823
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:18,478
I see! If I survive to the end...

824
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:20,438
...the country will be mine!

825
00:57:20,522 --> 00:57:22,524
Mine...

826
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:48,133
That Mori. He is an unexpected agitator.

827
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:51,344
Thanks to him, the
battlefield will churn even more.

828
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:56,474
I have made the preparations, so
feel free to kill as you please now.

829
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:59,269
You have my gratitude.

830
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:10,155
Go. Onward.

831
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:13,491
Commander, we can't keep
fighting defensively anymore!

832
00:58:13,575 --> 00:58:15,660
Sanada Yukimura!

833
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:18,413
I guess it was a momentous decision
for you to take part in this gathering,

834
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,415
but it's time to accept reality!

835
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:24,127
What will you do as the
general of your own army?!

836
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:42,312
To eradicate the root of all evil,
here and now in Sekigahara...

837
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:44,522
To every man in the Takeda Army!

838
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:47,525
I order you to fight back!

839
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:53,865
Understood!

840
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,200
Good!

841
00:58:55,283 --> 00:58:58,036
This isn't giving up.

842
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:02,040
Even if you get hacked apart
once or twice, if you're serious...

843
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,710
Live through it and take up the struggle again!

844
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:08,004
That is exactly right, One-Eyed Dragon.

845
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:11,299
And when that time comes, join us.

846
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:14,219
Too bad for you, I don't like making nice.

847
00:59:14,302 --> 00:59:17,096
I'll probably end up
fighting with you, too, someday.

848
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,808
When that time comes,
I will face you with these fists!

849
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:24,896
I, Tokugawa leyasu,

850
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:28,441
will not let the land of the rising
sun become a deserted country!

851
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:33,529
It's to protect our bonds and ties of love.

852
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:39,077
I guess I'll treat myself to
a little contest of strength!

853
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,953
Kojuro.

854
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:40,995
Yes, Sir.

855
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,664
Men!

856
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,381
Date Masamune.

857
00:59:51,464 --> 00:59:55,677
What ignoble means did you
employ to murder Lord Hideyoshi?

858
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,637
Ishida Mitsunari.

859
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,471
What about you?

860
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:02,642
How many innocents did you
drag into your vendetta against me?

861
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:05,770
What's the big idea
with this crazy free-for-all?

862
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,897
Such things do not matter!

863
01:00:07,981 --> 01:00:11,276
I will hold responsible any who
think no more of Toyotomi's influence!

864
01:00:11,276 --> 01:00:13,027
"All for One, One for All, for Peace and Harmony"

865
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:13,486
And especially any who dishonor it!

866
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,573
So the only successor he's got
is this one miserable bastard.

867
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:20,326
That boss monkey's totally
got to be rolling in his grave!

868
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:23,705
Recant every last bit of abuse
you heaped upon Lord Hideyoshi!

869
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:26,582
I will hear no other words from you!

870
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:34,465
Repent and die!

871
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,677
Hell or Heaven!

872
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:41,472
X-Bolt!

873
01:00:43,558 --> 01:00:46,185
Be carved to pieces!

874
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:52,608
With this, they will all
die at each other's hands.

875
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:55,987
Mori's entry into the battle was a
most unexpected stroke of good luck.

876
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:59,741
His intent was a surprise attack,
when in fact, he is helping us.

877
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:02,910
Even the exceptionally clever general
does not seem to have noticed this.

878
01:01:04,162 --> 01:01:09,417
The Great Malevolence's bitter hatred
for those who have forgotten Toyotomi

879
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,961
and Tokugawa leyasu's honorable idealism,

880
01:01:12,045 --> 01:01:15,965
wishing for peace for the
whole of the land of the rising sun.

881
01:01:16,049 --> 01:01:18,718
These choicest, unadulterated ingredients

882
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:21,471
look like they will make a tasty hot pot.

883
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:25,558
The one who whisked it
all together is my puppet,

884
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:29,020
Lady O-lchi, the Devil's younger sister.

885
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:34,317
Wh-Who's this woman?

886
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,873
Mitsunari, you must be happy as well.

887
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:52,919
You declare that you will hold
this entire world responsible

888
01:01:53,002 --> 01:01:56,756
and to your eye, this must
truly be a transcendent sight.

889
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:00,843
A-Are we really going to get peace this way?

890
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:03,930
Mori!

891
01:02:05,014 --> 01:02:08,810
You bastard! Long time no see!

892
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:12,397
Inciting an uproar and aiming
to profit from the sidelines, eh?

893
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,902
Your methods are dirty as ever! Eh, Mori?!

894
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:23,533
Hurling insults at your adversary,
while beaming joyfully like that...

895
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:25,034
Chosokabe,

896
01:02:25,118 --> 01:02:28,246
have you become a different person
in the time that I have not seen you?

897
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:31,249
I'll temporarily return the land of Aki to you!

898
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:36,546
I'll beat you into the ground
here and take it back all over again!

899
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:40,341
Return it and all will be fine.

900
01:02:40,425 --> 01:02:42,093
After your demise,

901
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,595
Shikoku will surely become
Aki's distant little island.

902
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:47,181
Keep yapping, you bastard!

903
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:03,823
You tarnished Lord Hideyoshi's rule!

904
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:08,327
You stole from me the
one and only light in my life!

905
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,456
Hang your head before Lord Hideyoshi!

906
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:13,916
Beg and plead for forgiveness!

907
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,127
And then,

908
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,297
be beheaded!

909
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,678
Once you're done with this revenge,

910
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:28,097
what will you raise your voice for then?

911
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,975
Come at me with everything you've got!

912
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:34,437
This is your climax!

913
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:03,174
What?!

914
01:04:24,362 --> 01:04:26,531
What is the matter, Gyobu?

915
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:28,407
Pay me no mind.

916
01:04:28,491 --> 01:04:32,161
I realized that even those
who have died once can die again

917
01:04:32,245 --> 01:04:35,706
and I was merely struck by that impermanence.

918
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:41,087
Why... you...!

919
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:52,056
If you've died once, then all the more reason!

920
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:54,850
Bring that strength to bear to live your life!

921
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:58,145
I'll bring that death wish of yours to an end!

922
01:05:00,773 --> 01:05:04,402
Jumping Jack Breaker!

923
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:38,352
What do you think you are doing, leyasu?

924
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:41,105
Both hatred and anger...

925
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:44,734
The cure to both things is bonds, Mitsunari.

926
01:05:46,027 --> 01:05:47,778
I believe... you...

927
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:51,073
I told you not to be conceited.

928
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:53,909
I did not ask you to help me.

929
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:58,164
Go die... in some ditch... somewhere...

930
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:05,921
Don't say things like that...
so lightly, Mitsunari...

931
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:15,181
Look at that, Gyobu.

932
01:06:15,264 --> 01:06:19,560
The Great Malevolence has finally
been dragged into leyasu's farce!

933
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:29,612
As an appetizer to the feast,
I could not have asked for anything better.

934
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:02,687
Let's all make them bloom.

935
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:06,691
Look. Not much longer now...

936
01:07:21,122 --> 01:07:24,417
You guys, watch out for those black hands!

937
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,836
Don't touch them!

938
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:34,885
Curse that Kingo. Blathering on needlessly.

939
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:38,931
The venerable Tenkai said that it
was to unite everyone's hearts as one!

940
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:41,851
He said sacrifices had
to be made for that and...

941
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:47,314
He's a priest, so I thought
what he said was right, but...

942
01:07:47,398 --> 01:07:51,068
In the end, I think it's wrong!

943
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:03,914
It looks like you were too late, Kingo.

944
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:08,043
These black hands look familiar!

945
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:13,215
Lady O-lchi...

946
01:08:56,509 --> 01:08:58,636
What the hell is that?

947
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:06,185
Moans of the dying, so like flowers.

948
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:11,941
--Open your gates, land and shrine of roots.
--Open your gates, land and shrine of roots!

949
01:09:55,276 --> 01:10:00,072
I have awakened and returned!

950
01:10:00,155 --> 01:10:05,953
Offer up all that you have and bow your heads!

951
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:08,956
Rejoice!

952
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:13,127
Followers of...

953
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:18,132
...foolish greed!

954
01:10:40,029 --> 01:10:42,239
The Devil King of the Sixth Heaven...

955
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:45,200
Is that... Oda Nobunaga?!

956
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:48,203
We haven't seen him in a while.

957
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:50,414
I don't know who cooked this up,

958
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:55,044
but it looks like someone used you
guys to get this surprise party going.

959
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:59,214
So... it was all for this?

960
01:10:59,882 --> 01:11:06,931
To all, I say, regale me and do your duty!

961
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:24,156
He's got unbelievable power...

962
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,951
It is incomparable to before...

963
01:11:32,498 --> 01:11:37,044
Putrescence drawn up by the
black hands of the Fifth Heaven

964
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:40,255
will form the Devil King's
new flesh and blood

965
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:44,593
and blanket this world
in death and destruction.

966
01:11:44,677 --> 01:11:45,928
With this,

967
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:51,684
all people will be equally reduced
to worms writhing in the dark abyss.

968
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:01,652
Stop this...

969
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:05,364
I absolutely refuse to permit your savagery.

970
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:06,490
At this rate,

971
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:11,036
the world that Lord Hideyoshi
aspired to rule will be destroyed!

972
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:18,502
Lord Hideyoshi's dream...
Lord Hanbei's hope...

973
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:22,673
I will not let the likes of you erase them!

974
01:12:25,634 --> 01:12:29,596
A grasping monkey and
his tail without a cause.

975
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:36,145
Such frail souls, not
worthy of eternal scrutiny.

976
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:45,738
Revering a feral monkey
obsessed with strength is supreme folly.

977
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:53,537
Hup!

978
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:04,339
Useless fools!

979
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,824
You will never... get away with this!

980
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:35,746
The rightfully abhorred Devil King...

981
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:38,082
I will not let the likes of you...

982
01:13:38,165 --> 01:13:40,918
...take Lord Hideyoshi's...

983
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:45,547
May you be reduced to ashes!

984
01:14:00,521 --> 01:14:02,981
Impertinence!

985
01:14:09,113 --> 01:14:11,949
Gyobu! What are you doing?!

986
01:14:12,032 --> 01:14:13,992
Why are You here?!

987
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:15,744
Get back!

988
01:14:15,828 --> 01:14:17,496
Get back, Gyobu!

989
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:21,083
You need not suffer any more!

990
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:30,843
Know it to be futile!

991
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:39,601
Gyobu!

992
01:14:42,563 --> 01:14:46,400
I had not realized until this very moment...

993
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,610
So, the way you saw me

994
01:14:48,694 --> 01:14:55,450
was the same as the way I saw you...

995
01:14:58,162 --> 01:15:02,916
That no one in this world
could be more unfortunate.

996
01:15:05,878 --> 01:15:09,715
A hilarious circumstance...

997
01:15:11,216 --> 01:15:13,302
Gyobu!

998
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:15,137
Gyobu!

999
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,390
I will not permit you to die!

1000
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:24,438
Gyobu!

1001
01:15:24,855 --> 01:15:28,150
What a clichéd way to make amends.

1002
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:32,529
In the end, it turns out that you
were a mere mortal as well, Gyobu.

1003
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:39,119
Mitsunari, take a good look at Nobunaga!

1004
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:40,537
During Toyotomi's era...

1005
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:43,165
In the eyes of the people, how Lord Hideyoshi...

1006
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:46,001
How <i>we</i> appeared to them!

1007
01:15:54,509 --> 01:15:57,221
It cannot be...

1008
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:19,993
Those are...

1009
01:16:20,077 --> 01:16:22,037
Are they the Devil King's roots?

1010
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:26,541
So those countless black hands
serve as the Devil King's roots?

1011
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:29,294
The Devil King has not
been fully resurrected yet!

1012
01:16:29,378 --> 01:16:31,713
If we cut him off while we still have time...

1013
01:16:31,797 --> 01:16:33,215
Kojuro.

1014
01:16:33,298 --> 01:16:35,425
Understood.

1015
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:38,095
Good hunting.

1016
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:41,974
Sasuke, I place you in
charge of the Takeda Army.

1017
01:16:42,057 --> 01:16:43,433
Roger that, but...

1018
01:16:43,517 --> 01:16:46,520
Do I get paid for being second in command?

1019
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:02,661
Now's our only chance.

1020
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:04,955
I'll leave the rest to you, Kojuro.

1021
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:07,708
My lord, please forgive me.

1022
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:11,545
I, Yukimura, am going to
sacrifice myself for this country.

1023
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:16,133
Toshi, Matsu, I wish you happiness forever.

1024
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:21,555
With faith that everyone will forge
their own bonds after I am gone...

1025
01:17:34,943 --> 01:17:38,530
Wind, Forest, Fire, Shadow,
Mountain, Lightning, Water!

1026
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:41,825
Smile, pale dawn of the east!

1027
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:45,912
Snatch and cherish tousled hair!

1028
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:59,176
It's the One-Eyed Dragon!

1029
01:18:30,123 --> 01:18:33,710
Oh, I can finally fight to the death with you,

1030
01:18:33,794 --> 01:18:35,629
Lord Nobunaga.

1031
01:18:45,806 --> 01:18:50,060
I cannot be destroyed...

1032
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:54,981
For I am already destroyed.

1033
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:03,031
Ichi.

1034
01:19:03,115 --> 01:19:05,450
Do not run away, lchi.

1035
01:19:05,534 --> 01:19:08,620
Now is the time to pay close attention.

1036
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:13,583
My lord... Nagamasa?

1037
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:18,422
Why, Lady O-lchi, you were still here?

1038
01:19:18,505 --> 01:19:21,466
You played your role well.

1039
01:19:22,134 --> 01:19:27,097
I, Tenkai, shall deliver
you to the depths of Hell.

1040
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:33,395
Huh?

1041
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:40,444
Oh?

1042
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:43,363
Um, am I...

1043
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:45,240
...shifted to one side?

1044
01:19:45,323 --> 01:19:46,283
Yes.

1045
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:49,536
P-Please wait one moment...

1046
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:56,710
Don't...

1047
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:57,919
Don't eat me!

1048
01:19:58,003 --> 01:19:59,838
I am not tasty!

1049
01:19:59,921 --> 01:20:02,466
Oh, but not there...

1050
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:07,345
Eat that... last!

1051
01:20:10,599 --> 01:20:15,937
A Devil has fifty years!

1052
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:24,070
Lord Hideyoshi...

1053
01:20:24,154 --> 01:20:28,158
For the unsightly death I am about to die...

1054
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:32,204
I beg for your permission!

1055
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:42,380
The crime in the blade,
the atonement in the sheath!

1056
01:20:49,638 --> 01:20:51,723
Mitsu... nari...

1057
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:58,855
I felt not the slightest irritation!

1058
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:19,876
Now is the time for atonement, lchi.

1059
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,505
You are the only one who can do this.

1060
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:31,513
My lord Nagamasa...

1061
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:43,858
Brother...

1062
01:21:43,942 --> 01:21:45,735
Lady O-lchi!

1063
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:52,284
The Devil King's... younger sister?

1064
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:55,745
Come to sleep with lchi.

1065
01:21:57,998 --> 01:22:00,292
Keraku...

1066
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:03,420
You simpleton...

1067
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:07,507
lchi will stay by your side forever.

1068
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:30,739
Wh-What comfort I feel in these arms...

1069
01:22:31,698 --> 01:22:35,744
This was inevi--

1070
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:58,767
You guys!

1071
01:22:59,434 --> 01:23:01,144
Tadakatsu!

1072
01:23:01,227 --> 01:23:04,522
Hey!

1073
01:23:40,225 --> 01:23:44,020
Do not forget your crime of
robbing Lord Hideyoshi of his future.

1074
01:23:44,104 --> 01:23:46,815
If you ever expose yourself
to be the unsightly little snake,

1075
01:23:46,898 --> 01:23:49,359
I will execute you whenever that may be.

1076
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,236
Refusal will not be tolerated.

1077
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:53,029
Excellent.

1078
01:23:53,113 --> 01:23:55,657
It'll give me more things to look forward to.

1079
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:59,452
So you are Maeda Keiji.

1080
01:23:59,536 --> 01:24:01,705
Yeah.

1081
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:03,623
I have a request.

1082
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:08,837
What is it? If it's anything
I can do, just name it.

1083
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,382
Someday, I want you to tell me the story

1084
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:15,468
of the Lord Hideyoshi I never knew.

1085
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:25,186
Sure. Any time. No problem.

1086
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,232
Lord leyasu.

1087
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:31,151
What is it, Sanada?

1088
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:34,904
If I were unable to carry out
my resolve upon this occasion,

1089
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:38,742
it had been my intention
to relinquish the title of Tiger.

1090
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:42,912
Thinking that perhaps the one who
was truly worthy in the next generation

1091
01:24:42,996 --> 01:24:44,998
to succeed the spirit of the Tiger was you...

1092
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:49,419
I have always looked up to
Lord Shingen as my teacher in spirit.

1093
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:51,504
And I will continue to do so.

1094
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:53,298
But you are different.

1095
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:55,467
The bond you share with Lord Shingen

1096
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:58,762
is probably thicker than
blood, something deeper.

1097
01:24:58,845 --> 01:25:01,264
I want you to put your heart and
soul into carrying out your duties

1098
01:25:01,347 --> 01:25:04,350
and pass it on to the next Tiger after you.

1099
01:25:04,434 --> 01:25:07,353
Very well.

1100
01:25:09,522 --> 01:25:11,608
Mitsunari.

1101
01:25:11,691 --> 01:25:14,068
I will wish for you and I

1102
01:25:14,152 --> 01:25:18,823
to someday unite the country with
the strength of the bonds we share.

1103
01:25:18,907 --> 01:25:22,660
Carrying on the ideals of someone
for whom you feel undying respect

1104
01:25:22,744 --> 01:25:25,997
is also a precious bond.

1105
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,167
I will take no part in collusion.

1106
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,960
That is so like you.

1107
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:38,009
Then how about we settle this with brute force?

1108
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:42,472
Fine.

1109
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:46,309
Let's treat ourselves to the
party we've been waiting for, too,

1110
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:48,186
Sanada Yukimura.

1111
01:25:49,896 --> 01:25:52,273
There is nothing I would like better.

1112
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:59,197
Good luck.

1113
01:26:02,534 --> 01:26:03,868
Farewell.

1114
01:26:06,538 --> 01:26:11,417
All right, everyone, this is the
honest-to-goodness last big fight!

1115
01:26:11,501 --> 01:26:15,421
No hard feelings now! Let's settle this!

1116
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:23,555
You're tougher than I thought, Mori.

1117
01:26:23,638 --> 01:26:25,056
Foolishness.

1118
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:26,766
Strategy and valor in arms.

1119
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:30,311
There is no way I am lesser
than you in any of those areas.

1120
01:26:30,395 --> 01:26:31,813
Putting up a front, eh?

1121
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:34,816
You can't wait to be put out of your
misery. It's written all over your face.

1122
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:37,360
I'll settle this for you with my next move!

1123
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:40,864
I imagine a pirate would be
happy to go to a watery grave.

1124
01:26:40,947 --> 01:26:44,367
Turn that anchor of yours into a
grave marker at the bottom of the sea.

1125
01:26:54,794 --> 01:26:59,215
The battle between the
warlords continued without end.

1126
01:27:07,599 --> 01:27:10,560
Lord Hideyoshi. Lord Hanbei.

1127
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:13,730
For the brash act I am about to commit,

1128
01:27:13,813 --> 01:27:15,773
I beg for your permission!

1129
01:27:16,983 --> 01:27:21,321
I will carry your teachings in
my heart for the rest of my life!

1130
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,909
Will the one to emerge
victorious on this battlefield

1131
01:27:25,992 --> 01:27:28,119
become the supreme ruler of the warring states?

1132
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:31,664
Or will these turbulent times still not end,

1133
01:27:31,748 --> 01:27:34,250
even after this battle
upon the field of Sekigahara?

1134
01:27:34,334 --> 01:27:36,461
Let us forge bonds, Mitsunari!

1135
01:27:36,544 --> 01:27:39,672
I know that you will be able to
forge stronger bonds than anyone!

1136
01:27:39,756 --> 01:27:42,425
Because you are capable of loving
someone with your entire heart

1137
01:27:42,508 --> 01:27:45,094
and risking your life for them.
So I'm certain of it!

1138
01:27:45,887 --> 01:27:49,557
Only the bonds shared by these warriors

1139
01:27:49,641 --> 01:27:52,477
and their fiery souls know the answer!

1140
01:27:54,729 --> 01:27:57,106
One-Eyed Dragon, Date Masamune!

1141
01:27:57,190 --> 01:28:00,318
I will now fulfill the oath
we swore on the summit!

1142
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:02,528
Be satisfied!

1143
01:28:02,612 --> 01:28:07,033
Don't let me reach the goal
too easily, Sanada Yukimura.

1144
01:28:48,199 --> 01:28:53,287
Unrivaled Spear of World Domination!
Sanada Yukimura is here!

1145
01:28:54,914 --> 01:28:59,585
Number One of Oshu,
Date Masamune, pressing on!

1146
01:29:30,658 --> 01:29:35,872
<i>Cool and wild suit a
bewitching night under a hazy moon</i>

1147
01:29:35,955 --> 01:29:40,460
<i>In devouring grace,
I'm as good as any out there</i>

1148
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:43,921
<i>For the trigger, snap your fingers</i>

1149
01:29:44,005 --> 01:29:46,591
<i>Send up a flare or nothing gets started</i>

1150
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:51,137
<i>Chasing down, getting in too deep, I'm done for</i>

1151
01:29:51,888 --> 01:29:56,976
<i>My way of life, drawing blades</i>

1152
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:02,482
<i>Even casts the shadow behind me in darkness</i>

1153
01:30:02,565 --> 01:30:12,366
<i>Pitched forward, sober, I invited,
“Don't be cheap, show me the future"</i>

1154
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:18,915
<i>Party On! Burning Soul!! It's priceless</i>

1155
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:24,087
<i>There's no end to the festival burning up</i>

1156
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:29,550
<i>Let's Dance! Warriors!!
Straight up, the world's going to hell</i>

1157
01:30:29,634 --> 01:30:34,931
<i>Super flashy means
business, right? On the rise</i>

1158
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:40,269
<i>The one to master the decisive battle wins</i>

1159
01:30:40,353 --> 01:30:44,273
<i>Keep the party going</i>

1160
01:30:53,157 --> 01:30:55,827
<i>I'm prepared for what's to come, but...</i>

1161
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:58,621
<i>Every last one of them's way too desperate</i>

1162
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:03,167
<i>Looks likely my destiny'll get tied up,
too, so I brace for a different fate</i>

1163
01:31:03,835 --> 01:31:14,637
<i>I see myself in the rich colors
and briefness of the burning sunset</i>

1164
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:19,475
<i>From the back of an unruly horse</i>

1165
01:31:19,559 --> 01:31:24,438
<i>The tail's to the east, which way is tomorrow?</i>

1166
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:30,903
<i>Party On! Burning Blood!!
I dream a lasting dream</i>

1167
01:31:30,987 --> 01:31:36,200
<i>Drunk on awakening, I can't stop</i>

1168
01:31:36,284 --> 01:31:41,622
<i>Let's Dance! Warriors!!
Let them get</i> away <i>with it this time</i>

1169
01:31:41,706 --> 01:31:46,669
<i>Sitting back and watching, I make a mistake</i>

1170
01:31:46,752 --> 01:31:52,341
<i>At the decisive battle, I grab on to a burning hot</i>

1171
01:31:52,425 --> 01:31:56,470
<i>Shooting star</i>

1172
01:32:16,073 --> 01:32:20,828
<i>With my way of life, drawing blades</i>

1173
01:32:20,912 --> 01:32:25,625
<i>Show me the passing time!</i>

1174
01:32:26,959 --> 01:32:32,215
<i>Party On! Burning Soul!! It's priceless</i>

1175
01:32:32,298 --> 01:32:37,386
<i>There's no end to the festival burning up</i>

1176
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:42,808
<i>Let's Dance! Warriors!!
Straight up, the world's going to hell</i>

1177
01:32:42,892 --> 01:32:48,231
<i>Super flashy means
business, right? On the rise</i>

1178
01:32:48,314 --> 01:32:53,402
<i>Party On! Burning Blood!!
I dream a lasting dream</i>

1179
01:32:53,486 --> 01:32:58,741
<i>Drunk on awakening, I can't stop</i>

1180
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:04,080
<i>Last number one!! Don't hold back this time</i>

1181
01:33:04,163 --> 01:33:09,585
<i>Radiant enough to embrace the era</i>

1182
01:33:09,669 --> 01:33:14,799
<i>The one to master the decisive battle wins</i>

1183
01:33:14,882 --> 01:33:21,681
<i>Keep the party going</i>
