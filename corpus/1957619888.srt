1
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:21,465
(light music)

2
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,433
(electronic rock music)

3
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,973
- Hello there.

4
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:34,806
- Hi.

5
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,910
James Caulfield.

6
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,050
Hey, you'll be rooming with Mark Brown.

7
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,883
Good luck.

8
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,960
- I'm James Caulfield, your roommate.

9
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,660
- You a freshman?

10
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,954
- Yeah.

11
00:02:57,954 --> 00:02:59,380
- Great.

12
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,100
- You a number cruncher?

13
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,997
- [Mark] A what?

14
00:03:01,997 --> 00:03:04,390
- An accounting major.

15
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,700
- Look, Caulfield, I'm not
interested in giving you

16
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,300
my life history.

17
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,290
I am interested in graduating.

18
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,870
So why don't you just
shut up so I can study?

19
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,710
- Well excuse me, your holiness.

20
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,470
- Don't mess with me, Caulfield.

21
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,820
I'll kick your ass in five seconds flat.

22
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,140
- Oh really?

23
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,740
And just how are you gonna do that?

24
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,433
Taekwondo.

25
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:45,210
Tangsudo.

26
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,573
Kenpo.

27
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:51,310
Hapkido.

28
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:53,540
Jujitsu.

29
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:57,566
- Do you jog?

30
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:03,813
(alarm ringing)

31
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:22,554
- Caulfield!

32
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:25,380
What the hell do you think
you're doing setting that alarm?

33
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,230
Damn near took my head off.

34
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,070
- Well you said early, didn't you?

35
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,020
- Oh man.

36
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,055
- Jeez, I guess I'm just
not used to college life.

37
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35,160
- That's it, you think
you're some kind of hotshot

38
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,140
kung fu artist, great.

39
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,903
Now's your time to prove it.

40
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,298
Let's go, see what you've got.

41
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:43,215
- Let's go.

42
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,633
- Ugh!

43
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,470
You wanna get serious?

44
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:07,180
Hey man, I'm sorry about that.

45
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,670
I didn't mean to hit you that hard.

46
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,773
- Way to go.

47
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,800
Whip that nigger's ass.

48
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,650
- What'd you say?

49
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:19,990
- I said whip the nigger's ass.

50
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,740
That's what their asses are for.

51
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,840
Right?

52
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,110
- Look jerk, I don't
know what your problem is

53
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,431
so just stay out of my face

54
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,770
or I'll show you whose ass needs whipping.

55
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,520
- Ooh, I'm scared.

56
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,390
- You better be.

57
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,880
- You're new on campus here aren't you?

58
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,380
Well I'll let it go this time.

59
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,434
But I suggest you be very careful

60
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:47,740
about who your friends are.

61
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,540
This is a dangerous place.

62
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,640
Sometimes people get hurt real bad.

63
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,740
- That's Craig Tanner.

64
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,380
He's the leader of a gang
called the White Tigers.

65
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,180
He's been a local badass for a long time.

66
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,290
They say his parents used to
send him off for treatment

67
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,561
but I think it just made him crazier.

68
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:22,035
Anyways, if I were you I
wouldn't mess with them.

69
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,660
- Yeah.

70
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,160
This guy needs his ass kicked.

71
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:37,107
Well excuse me.

72
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,904
- Well I'm late for class.

73
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:43,030
- Oh, yeah, me too.

74
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,399
Ecosystems?

75
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,860
- It's ecosystems.

76
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,903
- Look, I'm new in town.

77
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:04,660
Would you like to get together after class

78
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,590
and show me around?

79
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,949
- I'm chairperson for the
Students for Cleaner Environment

80
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,530
and we have a meeting after class.

81
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,753
- Excuse me, young man.

82
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:13,930
Would you be good enough to find a seat?

83
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,130
Thank you.

84
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,667
Class, I'm hoping that
by the end of this course

85
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:26,044
you will all come to
realize that the earth

86
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,957
does not belong to man but rather man

87
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,490
belongs to the earth.

88
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:34,707
(cars zooming)

89
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,589
- Well this is the place.

90
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,405
- So how long have you been teaching here?

91
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:58,150
- Well, for a few years.

92
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,480
Most of the kids have a
really bad background.

93
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,160
But they're doing okay now.

94
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,740
Only thing is, the owner
sold out last month.

95
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,870
They're tearing it all down to build

96
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,360
some kind of minimall
condo complex or something.

97
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,340
- That's too bad.

98
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,029
- Yeah, just when things
were getting good.

99
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,470
Let's go.

100
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,340
Share a bow.

101
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,173
And up!

102
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,853
Face your bow.

103
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:41,060
Yes.

104
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,440
Okay, today class I have
a couple announcements.

105
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,900
First, there's a
tournament coming to town.

106
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,800
It's open to all competitors.

107
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,310
Grand champion will
receive 25,000 dollars.

108
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,610
So of course I'll be entering myself.

109
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,840
- Do you think Craig
Tanner's gonna be in it?

110
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,116
- Probably.

111
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:59,480
Anyway I've saved the best for last.

112
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,450
I'd like to introduce
to you a friend of mine.

113
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,380
His name is James Caulfield.

114
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,320
He's an excellent
fighter and his technique

115
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,915
is very, very good.

116
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:09,060
Almost as good as mine.

117
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,210
So I want you to pay very close attention,

118
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,640
watch and learn.

119
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,473
James?

120
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,810
- Okay, everybody take a seat.

121
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,130
Okay today we're gonna be
working on kicking combinations.

122
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,370
First we're gonna work
on is low round kick

123
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,220
going to the leg or to the knee.

124
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,030
Recoiling, round kick to the head.

125
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,060
Spin heel kick again to the head.

126
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,823
Place sets!

127
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,040
Again first one comes
in taking out the knee.

128
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,659
Recoiling, coming through,
knocking the hand down,

129
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,253
heel kicking to the head

130
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,730
and coming through ready to
follow up with the hands.

131
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,323
Okay.

132
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,910
Everybody stand up, get a partner.

133
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,200
Ready, begin!

134
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:10,580
(energetic music)

135
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,910
Well they're a pretty good group.

136
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,270
- Yeah you should have seen
some of them a year ago.

137
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,820
Busted for dope, barely
getting out of gangs alive.

138
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,250
- Well, you've done a good job with them.

139
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,770
- That's why I need that prize money

140
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,787
so I can open up my own
school for kids like these.

141
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:52,140
You gonna enter?

142
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,420
- Me, I don't know.

143
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,980
I need the money now,
not six months from now.

144
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,280
- Well brother, I may
be able to help you out.

145
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:03,739
(register clicking)

146
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,299
- Don't forget to leave a tip.

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,833
I love this job.

148
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,270
Hi, Kimberly.

149
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,160
Out a little late tonight, aren't we?

150
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,200
- Oh, hi, James.

151
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,640
I didn't know you worked here.

152
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,894
- Yeah, well I just started tonight.

153
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:31,670
- Teresa, this is James.

154
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,775
James, Teresa.

155
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,170
- Hi.
- Hi.

156
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,110
- We're recruiting people
for our environmental group.

157
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,730
You wanna join?

158
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,750
- Uh, yeah well I'm pretty busy.

159
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,660
I mean I got this job now
and karate after classes.

160
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,040
- Oh I guess it doesn't matter to you

161
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,900
if we pollute our planet to the point

162
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,867
where we obliterate all forms of life

163
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,850
including our own.

164
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,880
- Well, no I mean of course I'm interested

165
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,050
in cleaning up the environment.

166
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,480
I just don't know if I have time to join

167
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,790
your group right now.

168
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,326
- Well probably by the time you do,

169
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:03,710
we will have completely
destroyed the ozone.

170
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,380
- Don't you think you're
being a little bit, ow!

171
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,830
- New man, no talking, do dish, now.

172
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,770
- Would you excuse me?

173
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,070
Just what in hell do you think
you were doing out there?

174
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,310
I was trying to score.

175
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,010
- You think your life football game?

176
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,220
Wrong, macho man.

177
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,020
- Butt out, buddy, my personal life

178
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,418
is none of your business.

179
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:41,770
- (laughing) You talk big,
but your mouth stinks.

180
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,447
(buzzing)

181
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,430
- Go James.

182
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,970
They need to order go fast.

183
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,803
- Yes sir.

184
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:10,004
(crunching)

185
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,095
- Well I'll be, if it isn't the wonderboy.

186
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,790
Our friend, the freshman.

187
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,760
Hey.

188
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,850
Are you still friends
with that jungle monkey?

189
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,570
- What is your problem anyway, Tanner?

190
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,820
- I don't have a problem.

191
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,700
Hey, you guys got a problem?

192
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,240
I didn't think so.

193
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,980
Looks like you're the one
with the problem, pretty boy.

194
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,610
You know you shouldn't get close to--

195
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,840
- I'm warning you, Tanner.

196
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,810
Don't insult my friends.

197
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,790
- And I warned you not to make friends

198
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,230
with porch monkeys.

199
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,523
- [Cook] James?

200
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,380
- All right, tough guy, outside.

201
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:00,504
- Yeah.

202
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:02,505
Outside.

203
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:07,714
(tense music)

204
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,677
(speaking in foreign language)

205
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,690
- You want it, Tanner, let's go.

206
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,236
(bashing)

207
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,020
- Ah, you're good, pretty boy.

208
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,570
But I'm better.

209
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,850
We could use a guy in
the Tigers just like you.

210
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,020
- I wouldn't join your slime

211
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,350
if you were the last people on earth.

212
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,470
- Well as far as you're concerned, I am.

213
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,310
- Why don't you just go
back into whatever hole

214
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,029
you climbed out of?

215
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:48,060
- I will Jamie, I will.

216
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,190
But think about this.

217
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,303
I'm better.

218
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:12,576
- I'm down there (mumbling) with a friend,

219
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:14,138
and he starts a fight with me.

220
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:15,255
- Really?

221
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:16,150
- I can't believe it.

222
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,260
First day in the job and
I'm already in a fight.

223
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,520
- I know it was a matter of time

224
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,630
before that guy got it coming.

225
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,630
- You gotta love it.

226
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,430
- See, I have 100 signatures
that I have to get by tomorrow.

227
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,040
- Gotta go, chief.

228
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,620
- They're burning hundreds of acres

229
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,750
of Amazon rainforests every day.

230
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,860
- That must make one big bonfire.

231
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,140
- Do you want to sign the petition

232
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,680
or haven't you got the time?

233
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,310
- Ooh, do I detect a little
hostility in that voice?

234
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:53,790
Okay, okay, I'll sign.

235
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,610
So where'd you disappear to last night?

236
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,710
- I don't like fights.

237
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,450
- I don't like bigots.

238
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,750
- Well we finally have
something in common.

239
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,200
- Good.

240
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,720
Then maybe we can discuss
it over dinner tonight.

241
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,160
- I don't date jocks.

242
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,370
- Do I look like a jock?

243
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,720
- No.

244
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,350
There's a test coming up in ecosystems.

245
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,040
I could use a study
partner if you're serious.

246
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,090
- Your place or mine?

247
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,430
- Okay.

248
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,820
Here's one.

249
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,960
What plant species dominated
the paleocene period?

250
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,380
- Huh?

251
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,580
- You're not paying attention to me.

252
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,140
- I am paying total attention to you.

253
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,830
- We've been studying for over an hour

254
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,210
and you haven't answered one question.

255
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,920
- Well I'm distracted.

256
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,910
- That's it.

257
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,450
I knew I shouldn't have done this

258
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,540
but I did anyway, that's my fault.

259
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,230
But I don't have to sit here and be ogled.

260
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,039
- I am not ogling.

261
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,180
I'm admiring.

262
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,250
- That's a typical jock remark.

263
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,870
- And what's that supposed to mean?

264
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,940
- That means that you've only
got one thing on your mind

265
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,770
and one organ in your head
and it's not your brain.

266
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,812
- Well maybe if we discuss
something interesting

267
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:16,290
I would use my brain.

268
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,320
- Like what?

269
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,130
- Like martial arts.

270
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,150
- Huh, right.

271
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,310
A real significant discovery
to the history of mankind.

272
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,880
More ways to annihilate
one another, great.

273
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,010
- Why don't you just go save a whale?

274
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:34,829
Good night Mr.Chan.

275
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,456
- That's our boy.

276
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,490
This is how we treat
coon lovers in this town.

277
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,910
- Don't move, pretty boy.

278
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,930
- Break the son of a bitch.

279
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,881
Drop him, boys.

280
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,868
(bashing)

281
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:19,664
(laughing)

282
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,081
Crawl to me, boy.

283
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,220
Crawl to me, pretty boy.

284
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,260
- Go to hell, Tanner.

285
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,280
- Crawl to me.

286
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:35,390
You know what it feels
like, pretty boy, to crawl

287
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,223
without a hand?

288
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,540
- Hold his hand down, boys.

289
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,263
And never mind.

290
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:41,990
I'll do it myself.

291
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:46,317
- Hey!

292
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:47,150
What do you want, what do you want?!

293
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,540
- Ah shut up.

294
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,040
- Stay out of this, China man.

295
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,860
We just want to see if the
pretty boy here can crawl.

296
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,920
- Oh you want crawl, I crawl.

297
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,753
Go away.

298
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,750
- You crawl or I'll
cut you too, China man.

299
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,250
- Don't, don't do it, Wing.

300
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,830
- Oh, I crawl I crawl, I crawl.

301
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,720
- Crawl man, crawl!

302
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,940
You crawl!

303
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,710
- That's it, China man.

304
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,550
Crawl.

305
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,510
Left, right, left,
right, crawl! (laughing)

306
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:28,069
(laughing)

307
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,800
- Come on, over here, China man.

308
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,140
Right here, buddy.

309
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,973
- Okay.

310
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:42,723
I come over there, okay. (laughing)

311
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,223
(men jeering)

312
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:52,421
(bashing)

313
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:57,258
(screaming)

314
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:01,754
(bashing)

315
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,933
- You want to take it?

316
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,972
- Let's get out here!

317
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:48,805
Come on!

318
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:56,930
Come on!

319
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:03,810
- How did you do that?

320
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,933
- Lucky.

321
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:06,760
Hey, where heal that?

322
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,682
- You better take me to a hospital.

323
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:10,555
- You not hurt bad.

324
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:12,663
- The hell I'm not.

325
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:15,080
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

326
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:19,408
(grunting)

327
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,500
- Now, you try walk.

328
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,830
- Where did you learn that?

329
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,390
- Ancient Chinese art.

330
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,730
Learn from comic book.

331
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,580
- Don't give me that comic book crap.

332
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,160
Hey, wait a minute.

333
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,840
I thought you were gonna drive me home.

334
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,330
- Drive yourself.

335
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,460
You're big macho man.

336
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,970
- What the hell happened to you?

337
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,280
- Tanner.

338
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,790
- Tanner?

339
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,940
Tanner did this to you?

340
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,560
He's better than I thought.

341
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,860
- Not just Tanner, he
had other guys with him.

342
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,640
Pipes and chains.

343
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,010
One of them even had a gun.

344
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,330
- And you fought them
all off single handed?

345
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,200
- Wing saved me.

346
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,260
- Wing?

347
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,120
That pudgy Chinese chef?

348
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,190
- He's a master's master, Mark.

349
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,150
- [Mark] In what, Kung fu?

350
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,730
- Kung Fu, Karate, I don't know.

351
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,440
I've never seen anybody move so fast.

352
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:45,810
I gotta get him to train me.

353
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,910
- You mean us.

354
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,330
- Wait a minute, Mark.

355
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,451
You don't know this guy, he's bizarre.

356
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't know if he'll
teach me, let alone you.

357
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,222
- Come on, James.

358
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:54,950
You're my man.

359
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,170
You've gotta get him to train me.

360
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,300
It's not just for the tournament.

361
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,390
Think of how many kids I
can keep off the streets

362
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,223
with that money.

363
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,540
Come on man, let's get you fixed up.

364
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,507
(door creaking)

365
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,063
- [Mark And James] Master!

366
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,520
- Hey, why you call me that?

367
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,600
I'm not your master.

368
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,110
- But we want you to be, Wing.

369
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,660
- No teach you, macho man.

370
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,950
- Please, we just want to learn.

371
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,783
- No.

372
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:34,880
- Well if you don't teach
me, at least teach Mark.

373
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,310
He needs to win the tournament money

374
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,970
so he can start a karate school
for underprivileged kids.

375
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,216
- Tournament?

376
00:23:40,216 --> 00:23:41,800
What tournament?

377
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,860
- It's the Melbrook
Martial Arts Tournament.

378
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,790
The winner gets 25,000 dollars.

379
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,818
25 grand.

380
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,440
- No.

381
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,140
Kung Fu for money no good.

382
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,880
- But it's for a good cause.

383
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,930
It's for the kids.

384
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,860
- Doesn't matter.

385
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,350
Money make people crazy, no way.

386
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,659
- Then I won't enter the tournament.

387
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:00,990
Just teach me.

388
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:04,870
- Okay.

389
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,870
I teach you both.

390
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,050
- All right, all right.

391
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:07,883
- Come on.

392
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,900
You pass test first.

393
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,170
You fail, then I no teach you.

394
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,170
- What kind of test?

395
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,060
- You, you, together.

396
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,843
Last one minute, I teach you.

397
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:27,450
- Here, now?

398
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,223
- You afraid?

399
00:24:33,778 --> 00:24:35,945
(bashing)

400
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:46,842
(bashing)

401
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,100
So sorry, you lose.

402
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,210
See you tomorrow.

403
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,660
Hey, don't forget to
clean the toilet, huh?

404
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,493
Bye bye.

405
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,826
(car starting)

406
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,170
- There goes the karate school.

407
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,460
- Don't be so sure.

408
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,530
- Your parking not so good.

409
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,080
- No, but I'm damn good
at learning martial arts.

410
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,460
I'm not gonna give up, Wing.

411
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,640
- Kung Fu not game.

412
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,900
Not for money.

413
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,250
Kung Fu is life.

414
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,000
- That's right, it is my life.

415
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,150
It's all I've ever wanted to do.

416
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,350
- You don't understand.

417
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,150
- I do understand.

418
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,580
It's the only thing
that keeps me together.

419
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,660
You were right about me, Wing.

420
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,200
I've been a macho man with my martial arts

421
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,710
trying to impress people.

422
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,660
I guess I'm just trying to
make up for other things.

423
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,640
But there's something different about you.

424
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,690
How can I learn that unless you teach me?

425
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,320
- You wait here for me.

426
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,360
I think tonight.

427
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,193
- Really?

428
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,700
- No promise, just think.

429
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,533
- Great, great.

430
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:42,358
(speaking in foreign language)

431
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:47,161
Yes!

432
00:26:49,684 --> 00:26:52,184
(light music)

433
00:27:20,258 --> 00:27:21,230
Did you think about it?

434
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,063
- It?

435
00:27:22,063 --> 00:27:23,595
- What we talked about last night.

436
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:25,480
- Oh, it.

437
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,070
No, so sorry I forgot.

438
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,903
- What do you mean you forgot?

439
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:29,280
I waited here all last night

440
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,480
and that's all you're gonna say?

441
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,510
- I say I'm sorry.

442
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,130
- You're a real pain in
the butt, you know that?

443
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,170
- Oh, I understand.

444
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,091
Like fire in wok.

445
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:38,924
Bye bye.

446
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:41,295
Bye bye.

447
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,200
- Hey James, what's going on, man?

448
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,033
- Not too much.

449
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,546
Man I am getting nowhere with Wing.

450
00:27:57,546 --> 00:28:00,120
- Man, you may as well give it up.

451
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,270
He's not gonna give in.

452
00:28:02,198 --> 00:28:03,110
- No way.

453
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,720
I'm just as stubborn as he is.

454
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,733
- Ah!

455
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,860
- Couldn't resist, could you?

456
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,250
- Well you are the most
conceited pig I ever met.

457
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,100
You really think the whole world

458
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,814
just revolves around you, don't you?

459
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:19,830
See what that attitude got you?

460
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,240
- It wasn't my fault, I got jumped.

461
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,073
- Yeah, right.

462
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,450
- What's up with you two anyway?

463
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,120
I thought you guys were happening.

464
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,730
- No way.

465
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,220
She has gotta be the biggest
pain I have ever met.

466
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,360
All she talks about is
how she's gonna save

467
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,770
the world from pollution.

468
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,320
And she's got the nerve
to call me a dumb jock.

469
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,900
- Man, have you got a lot to learn.

470
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,460
Patience, my friend.

471
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,634
Especially when it comes to women.

472
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:49,270
Be patient and the world will come to you.

473
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,383
- Master!

474
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,990
- No.

475
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,570
No decide yet.

476
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,740
- You will.

477
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,200
Take all the time you need.

478
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,270
I have plenty of patience.

479
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:23,178
(light music)

480
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,908
(car starting)

481
00:30:01,324 --> 00:30:02,330
Master!

482
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,473
- Get in.

483
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,500
- Master, I knew you would say yes.

484
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,720
Yes!

485
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,989
Was it my patience?

486
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:18,050
- [Wing] Junk.

487
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,430
- [James] Junk?

488
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,320
- Last night you eat two sandwich,

489
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,150
two cokes, three candy bars, three donuts.

490
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,180
They're junk.

491
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,830
Made me sick.

492
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,160
And don't call me master again.

493
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,740
Call me Sifu.

494
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,630
Sifu Wing.

495
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:53,930
Okay.

496
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,080
Show me your best kick.

497
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:02,240
(laughing) Like in movies.

498
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,549
Not practical.

499
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:05,670
- So what am I doing wrong?

500
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,520
- Give me your fearsome kick.

501
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,000
Kick at me, full force.

502
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,551
- Okay, but remember, you asked for it.

503
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:16,718
(bashing)

504
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,190
- Your waist is weak.

505
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,100
Therefore, your kick has no power.

506
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,992
- So what am I supposed to do?

507
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:24,825
- Up.

508
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,650
What do you feel?

509
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,150
- I definitely feel the power.

510
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,460
- Your waist is your foundation.

511
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,007
If the foundation is firm,
your kick will be faster

512
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:44,570
and more powerful.

513
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,920
Now I teach you how to build more power

514
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,753
in your waist.

515
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,603
One.

516
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,583
Two.

517
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,340
One, two.

518
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,363
Yes.

519
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:11,420
One.

520
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:14,935
Two.

521
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:20,520
One, two, one, two, you go.

522
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,970
Good.

523
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:26,803
You start today.

524
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,750
Meet me here tomorrow, six a.m.

525
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,063
- Pay attention, bookworm.

526
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:36,896
- What?

527
00:32:36,896 --> 00:32:37,890
- He's doing it.

528
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,723
- Who?

529
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,556
- Wing, he's teaching me.

530
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:40,550
I just had my first lesson today.

531
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,570
- No way.

532
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,430
- Nelson, I promised him I
wouldn't fight for money.

533
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,690
But it didn't say anything
about teaching you.

534
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,523
- Yeah!

535
00:32:47,523 --> 00:32:49,180
- [Both] Yes, yes, yes!

536
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,520
- Hi.

537
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,400
- Hi, Wing, nice to see you again.

538
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,940
- This place closed?

539
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,359
- Yes.

540
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,709
- How'd you get us in here?

541
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,190
- He's married to Chan's sister.

542
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,110
- So what did you tell Mr.
Chan to get him to do this?

543
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,630
- Tell him, no limping.

544
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,533
- I like that.

545
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,610
Where's the skates?

546
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,260
- No, no this.

547
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,730
- No socks?

548
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,730
My feet will freeze.

549
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,980
- Come on.

550
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,813
- Okay, god.

551
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:05,313
(grunting)

552
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,703
Agh!

553
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,013
- Attack me.

554
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,100
Look like Bambi.

555
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,810
- It's not funny.

556
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:30,130
I can't do this, Wing.

557
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,080
- You want it easy?

558
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,030
Movies easy.

559
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,030
This is life.

560
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,280
Slippery, cruel, hard.

561
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,773
Again.

562
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,520
Concentration is very important in life.

563
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Always remember to keep your
balance anytime, anywhere.

564
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,930
Training on ice can
teach you good balance.

565
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,713
Balance good.

566
00:35:15,701 --> 00:35:17,868
You can defend and attack.

567
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:22,396
Now, let me show you.

568
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:48,371
(tense music)

569
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:43,263
- [James] Ayaa!

570
00:36:43,263 --> 00:36:44,096
- Hey, bad man.

571
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:53,151
- You ready to do it?

572
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:54,150
First lesson.

573
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,740
What you're gonna do is give me a punch

574
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,640
then a front kick.

575
00:37:01,878 --> 00:37:04,412
- Hey, that was a smooth move, man.

576
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:05,245
- Get over there, partner.

577
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:06,078
Okay, okay.

578
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,724
Heel kick, front kick.

579
00:37:09,724 --> 00:37:13,400
Give me two.

580
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,630
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

581
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:34,307
- Hi, Sifu!

582
00:37:34,307 --> 00:37:35,390
- Hi James.

583
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,200
All right, jump in and jump out.

584
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,000
- That's easy.

585
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,163
- Hole too big.

586
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,200
Now, you try again.

587
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,273
- Whoah!

588
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:12,740
I can't even bend my knees in here.

589
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,798
- Take part in hard to do.

590
00:38:14,798 --> 00:38:17,020
Use here, not this.

591
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:23,411
(grunting)

592
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:24,995
Good, good.

593
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:25,828
You try hard.

594
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:26,661
I come back later.

595
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,140
- Hey, wait a minute.

596
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,680
This is impossible.

597
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,280
Who do you think I am, superman?

598
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,633
- How you do?

599
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,370
- Horrible, I haven't gotten out once.

600
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,203
I can't do this.

601
00:39:14,203 --> 00:39:16,670
I don't understand what
you mean about heart.

602
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:19,590
It just seems impossible.

603
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,480
- Impossible?

604
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,770
Come up, let me show you.

605
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:37,862
(tense music)

606
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,383
- Ya!

607
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,520
In Kung Fu, nothing is impossible.

608
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,780
Try again, and again.

609
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,510
- Class, now we come
to the neanderthal man

610
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,860
who is one of our ancient predecessors.

611
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,610
While the neanderthal may not have been

612
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,070
the brightest of fellows,

613
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,270
at least he lived in
harmony with the earth.

614
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,680
(groaning)

615
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,310
- Oh, terribly sorry.

616
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,143
You all right?

617
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:06,976
- Yeah.

618
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:07,809
- It's okay.

619
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:09,670
- He knew the basics of survival

620
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,340
and didn't litter up his landscape

621
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,020
with a lot of toxic waste
or non-biodegradable trash.

622
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,670
Take a good look at this fellow.

623
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,220
We may all end up like him again.

624
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,740
Especially if we don't
clean up the ozone layer.

625
00:40:25,735 --> 00:40:27,985
(laughing)

626
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:33,675
(fly buzzing)

627
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:45,842
(spray hissing)

628
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,192
- That's real kung fu.

629
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,617
- I can't believe this.

630
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,550
- Hey, we practice now.

631
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,383
- Here?

632
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:58,490
- Yeah, come on.

633
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,323
- There's no room.

634
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,156
- Come on.

635
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,150
Kung Fu like life is everywhere.

636
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,320
- I know, you said that before.

637
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,680
Kung Fu is like life.

638
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
- Yes.

639
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,050
- Okay, but no kicking.

640
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,239
My legs are still sore from the sand pit.

641
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,930
- Do kick later.

642
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,763
Now we do hands.

643
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,463
Try hit.

644
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,840
- Ouch, that hurts!

645
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,679
- Yeah, good is put pain teacher.

646
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:33,210
Teach you to be faster.

647
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,043
Do again.

648
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,043
- Ow!

649
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,090
- Where you look?

650
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,940
- I'm looking at your hands.

651
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,050
Where else would I look?

652
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,390
- No, no, no, not hands.

653
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,859
Primitive.

654
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:50,660
- Look, you are using your hands.

655
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,880
I have to watch your hands.

656
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,960
If you're using your feet,
I would watch your feet.

657
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,560
How else can I know what
you're gonna do next?

658
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,670
- Look shoulder, better than hands.

659
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,770
- All right, I see what you mean.

660
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,730
- Good, locked arm.

661
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,203
Faster!

662
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,203
Faster!

663
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,260
Now, look at my eyes.

664
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,470
Better than shoulders.

665
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,650
See more in eyes than anywhere.

666
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,580
- All right!

667
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,990
- Table need cleaning.

668
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,140
- I'll do it right now.

669
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,470
- You need detergents.

670
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,640
His hand very soft.

671
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:52,840
(laughing)

672
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,990
- Oh now what happened?

673
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,200
- Oh it seems your boy
here is a bit of a clutz.

674
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,660
- Be more careful James.

675
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,530
Dishes break, I lose money.

676
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,430
- Yes, Mr.Chan, it won't happen again.

677
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,690
Didn't think you had the
nerve to show up here again.

678
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,240
- And miss dining at one of the city's

679
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,940
most elegant restaurants?

680
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,200
I was just discussing with my friend here

681
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,350
how excellent the food is.

682
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,170
Congratulations, bus boy.

683
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,210
Obviously he's not too good at walking.

684
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,810
Maybe he can't shake hands either.

685
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,550
Come on man, let's get out of here.

686
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,940
- Is that the guy?

687
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:53,854
- Yeah.

688
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,880
We'll be seeing you Caulfield.

689
00:44:00,374 --> 00:44:02,330
When you don't have the Chinaman's apron

690
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,890
to hide behind.

691
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,390
- Oh, chop too harsh.

692
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:35,440
Get new pan tomorrow.

693
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,130
- Better, huh?

694
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,132
- Better.

695
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:04,250
Practice hands.

696
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,303
- Wait a minute.

697
00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:14,470
- (laughing) Good, clever boy.

698
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,780
- Part of Kung Fu, heartless.

699
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,100
- Great, I ran as fast
as you today, didn't I?

700
00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:29,560
Oh man.

701
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,383
- You try it.

702
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,950
- Ankle weights, great.

703
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,380
- [Wing] You run now.

704
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,500
- Run?

705
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,360
I can hardly walk in these.

706
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,070
- Keep running, no more talk.

707
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,790
Do this for next two weeks.

708
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,010
Then we run again.

709
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,097
(tense music)

710
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:18,026
- He's coming.

711
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:38,650
- Humor's good.

712
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,660
It is a part of martial arts, thank you.

713
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,860
Today's lesson is gonna be on legs.

714
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:52,224
(energetic music)

715
00:47:56,976 --> 00:47:57,810
- That was a great lesson, sir.

716
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:58,930
- All right, take care.

717
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,570
- I will.

718
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,403
- [Girl] Thank you sir.

719
00:48:01,403 --> 00:48:03,440
- Yeah, okay we'll see you guys tomorrow.

720
00:48:07,225 --> 00:48:08,200
And you know the guys really appreciate

721
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,820
what you've been doing for them now.

722
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:13,020
You know you really should
enter the tournament.

723
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:13,990
You'll do great.

724
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,110
- I can't, I gotta keep
my promise to Wing.

725
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,431
No fights for money.

726
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:19,240
- Yeah, I understand.

727
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,200
By the way, Kimberly called again.

728
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,300
- I know, I got the message.

729
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,630
- You want me to tell her to stop calling?

730
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:25,850
- No.

731
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:30,090
I mean, I'm just busy working
out with Wing right now.

732
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:38,334
(tense music)

733
00:50:27,075 --> 00:50:30,075
(crickets chirping)

734
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:50,728
(men screaming and bashing)

735
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:15,033
(growling)

736
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:40,709
(calm music)

737
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,504
- Sifu!

738
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:40,930
Come here.

739
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,830
Sifu, Sifu, please.

740
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:44,840
I overslept last night.

741
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,760
- You broke promise.

742
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,153
I no train.

743
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:48,410
- Please.

744
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:49,890
It will never happen again.

745
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,990
- Make promise, keep promise.

746
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,370
No excuse.

747
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,560
- I am truly sorry.

748
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:02,663
- Take it off.

749
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,400
How many days?

750
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,566
- 14 days.

751
00:54:11,566 --> 00:54:12,720
Can we run now?

752
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,250
So what's this for?

753
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,210
- I test you now.

754
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,450
Use kick, break it.

755
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,270
- Focused energy here.

756
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,840
Total concentration.

757
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,773
One more.

758
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,083
- I did it!

759
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,820
I did it, I did it.

760
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,000
- Not finished.

761
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,750
- What do you mean, I thought this was it.

762
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,970
- This is nothing.

763
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,170
Now come the hard part.

764
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,003
Come tomorrow.

765
00:55:33,683 --> 00:55:35,933
(knocking)

766
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:38,625
Good, here come.

767
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,453
Sit down.

768
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,910
So far, you learn very
well, but there's more.

769
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,020
- More?

770
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,980
- Now I teach you something special.

771
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:15,803
Remember this.

772
00:56:16,651 --> 00:56:18,300
But you tell no one.

773
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,270
No one!

774
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:21,330
- Okay.

775
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:22,163
- Swear.

776
00:56:22,163 --> 00:56:22,996
- I swear.

777
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,280
Okay, I swear, I promise.

778
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,113
- Wait here.

779
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,293
Don't touch!

780
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,620
- I'm sorry Sifu, I was just wondering.

781
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,830
- This from my Sifu.

782
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,750
I teach you something about life.

783
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,914
- Are you serious or is this a joke?

784
00:57:20,914 --> 00:57:22,719
- This is Eric.

785
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:23,690
- Eric?

786
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,410
And what does Eric do?

787
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:26,560
- You know acupuncture?

788
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,240
- Acupuncuture, the stuff you used on me

789
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,550
in the alley after the fight?

790
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,659
- Yes.

791
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:34,030
- What does Eric have to do with that?

792
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:36,443
- See this?

793
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:42,160
- That's where you touched
me after the fight.

794
00:57:50,237 --> 00:57:51,190
- See this?

795
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:57,355
(laughing)

796
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:08,030
Too much laugh.

797
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,690
- What is all this?

798
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,480
- Too much make love.

799
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,850
- Oh no, you don't.

800
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,970
- Now, attack me.

801
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,320
- I can't attack you, Sifu.

802
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,670
- It's okay, attack.

803
00:58:23,863 --> 00:58:28,830
- All right.

804
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:43,181
(coughing)

805
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:46,140
- What do you learn about this?

806
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,810
- Um, I've learned that different parts

807
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:55,400
of your body control other parts.

808
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,700
And depending on what parts you touch,

809
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:02,820
acupuncture can be used
to heal you or to kill.

810
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,620
- Yes.

811
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,930
- This is what you used on those guys

812
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,320
in the alley, isn't it?

813
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,500
- Yes.

814
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,350
- But you could have killed them.

815
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,183
- Yes.

816
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:16,043
Can heal.

817
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:21,928
Can kill.

818
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,920
- How do I know which one to use?

819
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,460
- When you are hungry,
you will know when to eat.

820
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,030
- So I can use this if
someone's trying to kill me?

821
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:36,460
- But only when life is
in danger, you swear.

822
00:59:37,772 --> 00:59:38,820
- I swear.

823
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,250
- Promise!

824
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,083
- I promise.

825
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:16,317
Hi.

826
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:17,150
- Hi.

827
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,820
You're not working tonight?

828
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:26,700
I thought you weren't ever
gonna speak to me again.

829
01:00:28,028 --> 01:00:30,078
- Yeah, well I'm really sorry about that.

830
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:33,041
I was really rude and I can see that now.

831
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:36,933
- What happened?

832
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,183
- Well I'm doing some
different kind of training

833
01:00:40,183 --> 01:00:42,380
and it really opened my eyes.

834
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,433
- Acupuncture?

835
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,711
Is that part of it?

836
01:00:46,711 --> 01:00:47,544
- Yeah.

837
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,741
That's part of it.

838
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:55,332
- I didn't know you were
into that kind of thing.

839
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:59,415
- That's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

840
01:01:00,344 --> 01:01:01,761
- I can see that.

841
01:01:04,989 --> 01:01:07,489
(light music)

842
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,341
- Come get it.

843
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:23,341
Come get it.

844
01:03:24,937 --> 01:03:27,187
(laughing)

845
01:03:32,406 --> 01:03:34,489
- Turn off these bubbles.

846
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:37,800
James, you've really changed
in the past few months.

847
01:03:40,112 --> 01:03:41,250
I like you better this way.

848
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:45,866
I never would have
thought you could get this

849
01:03:45,866 --> 01:03:47,000
from martial arts.

850
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,270
- Yeah well I kind of owe that to Wing.

851
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:51,360
He's taught me a lot.

852
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:55,290
- What do you mean?

853
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,250
- Um, well for instance, acupuncture,

854
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,400
you see you have these passive energy

855
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,064
that run through your body.

856
01:04:01,064 --> 01:04:01,897
They're called meridians.

857
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:06,580
And you have one runs up along here

858
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,733
to here,

859
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:15,610
up to here.

860
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:16,960
- And what if I get a pain?

861
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:24,171
- Let's say you get a pain right here.

862
01:04:24,171 --> 01:04:26,010
That would mean the energy is stuck.

863
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,220
- And what would I have to
do to get the energy unstuck?

864
01:04:36,447 --> 01:04:37,697
- Stimulate it.

865
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,190
Hey, Joey, looking pretty good out there.

866
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,023
How are you doing?

867
01:05:15,023 --> 01:05:17,180
- Sir, I decided to enter the tournament.

868
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,300
I don't care if Tanner's gonna be in it.

869
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,220
- That's great Joey, I'm proud of you.

870
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,920
Actually that's part of the
reason why I'm here today.

871
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:27,490
I used to think that my
martial arts was a way

872
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,520
to defend myself.

873
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:33,040
Then I thought it was a
way to prove to everybody

874
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,790
just how tough I was.

875
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,500
I got pretty cocky about it.

876
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,330
Thought I was a real macho man.

877
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,100
And I would deliberately provoke fights

878
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,160
just to prove what a man I was.

879
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,010
Well I was wrong.

880
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:52,510
Martial arts isn't about
being tough or a wiseass.

881
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,550
It's about being true to your inner self.

882
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,190
So when you go into the
tournament on Saturday,

883
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,270
don't go in there thinking
you're gonna prove

884
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:02,300
how tough you are.

885
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,500
Go in there to learn
about who you really are.

886
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,680
And no matter what happens,
you'll all be winners.

887
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:17,454
(clapping)

888
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,860
- Nice speech, James.

889
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,480
Tough words from such a sweet boy.

890
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,860
- What do you want, Tanner?

891
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,480
- I was just checking the fight listings

892
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,288
and your name isn't on it.

893
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:38,121
- That's right.

894
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,260
- What's the matter, don't they have

895
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,590
a pretty boy division?

896
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:46,950
Scared your face might get hurt, Jamie?

897
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:47,783
- I'm in the tournament.

898
01:06:47,783 --> 01:06:50,410
You can be damn sure I'm
gonna kick your ass, Tanner.

899
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,243
- You?

900
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:55,660
You won't even make it past
the first round, shoeshine.

901
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,493
Ding!

902
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,230
It's too bad old James won't be there.

903
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:01,830
It's his ass that needs kicking.

904
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,490
- Sorry I can't help you out, Tanner.

905
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,160
I'm gonna sit this one out.

906
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,000
- Oh Caulfield, I get
extremely mad sometimes.

907
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:16,600
Fortunately, my friends help me out.

908
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,110
Wouldn't want anything to
happen to your baby face.

909
01:07:36,882 --> 01:07:37,920
I sure wish you'd sign up.

910
01:07:41,745 --> 01:07:45,480
Come on, let's get out of here.

911
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,353
- Let him go.

912
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,777
Sifu, you'll never guess
what happened tonight.

913
01:07:59,777 --> 01:08:01,070
- Hey, hey, here.

914
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:02,220
Beat this egg, come on.

915
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,760
- Tonight, I finally learned
the meaning of patience.

916
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,470
- Hurry up, order's waiting!

917
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:15,481
- Willy McCoy spit in my face tonight

918
01:08:15,481 --> 01:08:16,790
and I didn't fight him.

919
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,056
- Ooh, so, you spit in my egg

920
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,820
and I don't fight you too, hmm?

921
01:08:29,367 --> 01:08:31,030
- So what do you guys want for lunch?

922
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,370
- Oh, here we go again.

923
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,340
- What, I'm hungry.

924
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,920
- You are always hungry.

925
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:35,862
- How's pizza?

926
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:36,940
- That's great.

927
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:37,773
- That sound good?

928
01:08:37,773 --> 01:08:39,010
Pizza, huh, yes.

929
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:40,140
- You watch.

930
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,960
Two months down the road,
she's gonna get huge.

931
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,039
I'm gonna dump you 'cause you're so fat.

932
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:45,520
(laughing)

933
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,980
- Hey, why don't you get
the shoes you wanted?

934
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,060
- I can do that.

935
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:49,980
Okay, I'll go get the shoes

936
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:51,268
and I'll meet you guys back at the car.

937
01:08:51,268 --> 01:08:52,281
- All right, man.

938
01:08:52,281 --> 01:08:57,281
- Well I'm gonna go get some candy.

939
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:07,993
- My god.

940
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,690
How can this be happening?

941
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:15,880
You're a disgrace to the race, woman.

942
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,143
- Back off, Tanner.

943
01:09:17,143 --> 01:09:19,070
- Shut up, boy.

944
01:09:19,923 --> 01:09:21,884
Don't you get it?

945
01:09:21,884 --> 01:09:24,893
You're not supposed to be with his kind.

946
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:27,060
(bashing)

947
01:09:38,793 --> 01:09:41,043
(crashing)

948
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,530
- Joey, are you hurt?

949
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:44,450
- Oh, I'm okay.

950
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,270
- We've got to get him to a doctor, Mark.

951
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:55,891
- Back up.

952
01:10:04,092 --> 01:10:06,259
(bashing)

953
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:15,509
- What happened?

954
01:10:15,509 --> 01:10:17,060
- My arm.

955
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,760
- Hey, get the cops.

956
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,340
- Come on, get up, it's the cops, come on!

957
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,690
Get up, come on you guys!

958
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:26,210
Get up, get up, come on!

959
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,390
- What happened?

960
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,200
- It was Tanner and McCoy.

961
01:10:34,668 --> 01:10:36,170
- That's it.

962
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:37,950
They are not getting away with this, Mark.

963
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:40,210
Tanner and McCoy are history.

964
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:41,043
God!

965
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:43,123
Come on.

966
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:03,650
You going to the tournament tomorrow?

967
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,390
- I can't believe it but I am.

968
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,772
- Maybe I'll stop by.

969
01:11:08,772 --> 01:11:09,605
I guess Joey might be fighting

970
01:11:09,605 --> 01:11:11,000
and I'd like to watch him fight.

971
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:19,160
- Good night, Mark.

972
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,660
- [Mark] Good night, Kimberly.

973
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:32,457
(sighing)

974
01:11:32,457 --> 01:11:33,290
- You know I was thinking, Mark.

975
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:36,000
Maybe I should enter
the tournament tomorrow.

976
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,650
I mean you took out Tanner.

977
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,150
Somebody's gotta handle McCoy.

978
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,040
If I don't do it, those
guys are gonna think

979
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,540
they can get away with anything.

980
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:47,700
- Wait a minute, James.

981
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,020
You sure about this?

982
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:53,270
What about your promise to Wing?

983
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:56,478
- I know.

984
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,960
- Look man, don't worry about the school.

985
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,740
I'll get a job after graduation,

986
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,590
save up some money for a downpayment.

987
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:06,460
It won't be so bad.

988
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,210
- That'll take years.

989
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,640
Look, I know I promised
not to fight for money

990
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,719
or to use the acupuncture points.

991
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,130
But this is different, Wing.

992
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,650
Now it's for Mark and the kids.

993
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:38,520
- No, you must remember your promise.

994
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,690
- But this is different.

995
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:41,000
- Not different.

996
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,750
You must be true to your principle.

997
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:47,270
You decide yourself.

998
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:04,770
- So remember, it's not
about beating the other guy.

999
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:06,920
It's about listening
to what's inside here.

1000
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:12,090
I don't know, he was gone
when I got up this morning.

1001
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,040
- I hope they get their heads bashed in.

1002
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:32,400
- That's pretty tough talk from a girl

1003
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,570
who claims she's a pacifist.

1004
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:36,500
- Well, there's a time for everything.

1005
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,750
- Then this must be the place.

1006
01:13:42,594 --> 01:13:47,370
Where do we go?

1007
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:49,890
- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen.

1008
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:53,880
Welcome to Millbrook first
martial arts tournament.

1009
01:13:55,036 --> 01:13:57,730
We got a great crowd turnout tonight.

1010
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:00,700
And here come the judges.

1011
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,450
We're about to begin the event.

1012
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:07,870
But first we'd like to
inform you of some changes

1013
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:08,740
in the program.

1014
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,350
An original entrant, Mr. Mark Brown

1015
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:15,320
representing the Red Dragon Kung Fu club

1016
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,840
has withdrawn due to a personal injury.

1017
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,610
He is being replaced
by Mr. James Caulfield.

1018
01:14:48,547 --> 01:14:50,797
(laughing)

1019
01:14:52,926 --> 01:14:56,030
- James, I told you, you
don't have to do this.

1020
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,420
- Yes I do.

1021
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,320
- What about Wing?

1022
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:01,783
- Don't worry.

1023
01:15:02,786 --> 01:15:03,780
I think he'll understand.

1024
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:10,350
- Hey, hey, hey.

1025
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,460
There's plenty of time for that later.

1026
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,490
Come on man, you're up.

1027
01:15:19,435 --> 01:15:21,602
(bashing)

1028
01:15:28,387 --> 01:15:31,304
(energetic music)

1029
01:16:03,278 --> 01:16:05,861
(crowd booing)

1030
01:16:07,302 --> 01:16:09,469
(bashing)

1031
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:44,753
(crowd booing)

1032
01:16:46,526 --> 01:16:48,693
(bashing)

1033
01:17:21,494 --> 01:17:24,244
(crowd cheering)

1034
01:17:25,429 --> 01:17:28,346
(crowd applauding)

1035
01:17:34,011 --> 01:17:36,178
(bashing)

1036
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:58,158
- That guy in the white
top, he looks dangerous.

1037
01:17:58,158 --> 01:17:59,416
- I know.

1038
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:01,107
- Do you know who he is?

1039
01:18:01,107 --> 01:18:02,080
- I've never seen him before.

1040
01:18:03,476 --> 01:18:04,726
He's damn good.

1041
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,370
(groaning)

1042
01:18:52,164 --> 01:18:54,414
(laughing)

1043
01:18:59,559 --> 01:19:01,265
(cheering)

1044
01:19:01,265 --> 01:19:02,098
- You were great!

1045
01:19:02,098 --> 01:19:03,630
- Thanks.

1046
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:05,430
Guess that just about makes us even.

1047
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,968
- This is it, man, one more to go.

1048
01:19:15,968 --> 01:19:16,801
You ready?

1049
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,633
- You can do it!

1050
01:19:32,656 --> 01:19:33,489
- Brother.

1051
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:45,150
- [Announcer] And now,
finalists James Caulfield

1052
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:48,660
and White Tiger Gary
Carlisle will face off

1053
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:51,380
for the Milbrook Karate Championship.

1054
01:19:54,061 --> 01:19:55,237
- I hope he doesn't get hurt.

1055
01:19:55,237 --> 01:19:57,904
- Don't worry, he can handle it.

1056
01:20:10,919 --> 01:20:13,086
(bashing)

1057
01:20:58,765 --> 01:21:00,932
(bashing)

1058
01:21:21,261 --> 01:21:23,511
(grunting)

1059
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,423
(percussive intense music)

1060
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:34,754
(bashing)

1061
01:21:52,919 --> 01:21:53,836
- Yes, yes!

1062
01:21:54,846 --> 01:21:57,096
(cheering)

1063
01:22:01,587 --> 01:22:04,088
- James, he has a knife!

1064
01:22:04,088 --> 01:22:06,838
(knife clanging)

1065
01:22:11,318 --> 01:22:13,485
(bashing)

1066
01:22:21,081 --> 01:22:22,664
- Oh, are you okay?

1067
01:22:26,163 --> 01:22:29,080
(crowd applauding)

1068
01:22:34,105 --> 01:22:36,438
(screaming)

1069
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,070
- [Wing] This is airway.

1070
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:57,090
- [James] So I can use this if
someone's trying to kill me?

1071
01:22:57,090 --> 01:23:00,329
- [Wing] Only when life's
in danger, it's rabid.

1072
01:23:00,329 --> 01:23:02,496
(bashing)

1073
01:23:09,503 --> 01:23:10,836
- What the hell.

1074
01:23:15,394 --> 01:23:18,311
(crowd applauding)

1075
01:23:25,135 --> 01:23:28,052
(tires screeching)

1076
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,135
Sifu!

1077
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:35,530
Where are you going?

1078
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:36,980
- I'm leaving.

1079
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,138
- Are you angry with me?

1080
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:39,650
- Did you break promise?

1081
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,440
- You nodded.

1082
01:23:44,793 --> 01:23:45,900
- Did I nod?

1083
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:48,980
- Come on, let's go.

1084
01:24:04,756 --> 01:24:07,339
(car starting)

1085
01:24:10,585 --> 01:24:11,435
- Here they come.

1086
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:26,883
- Well, come on!

1087
01:24:41,214 --> 01:24:43,464
(clapping)

1088
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,230
- [Man] Hut!

1089
01:24:58,230 --> 01:24:59,890
Face Sifu Wing, bow.

1090
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,230
- Would you do the honors?

1091
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:38,030
(students clapping)

1092
01:25:46,084 --> 01:25:47,420
I finally learned your lesson.

1093
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,420
Strength without judgment means nothing.

1094
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,953
(somber music)

1095
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:40,660
- If I were you, I would
have done the same.

1096
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:44,913
Catch.

1097
01:26:58,476 --> 01:27:00,893
(rock music)

1098
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,320
- [Narrator] For James
Caulfield, getting an education

1099
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,130
was getting him into trouble.

1100
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:05,017
- You're new on campus here, aren't you?

1101
01:30:05,017 --> 01:30:07,394
(bashing)

1102
01:30:07,394 --> 01:30:09,070
This is a dangerous place.

1103
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:14,070
Sometimes people get hurt real bad.

1104
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,470
- [Narrator] He's found the right girl.

1105
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:18,392
- There's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

1106
01:30:18,392 --> 01:30:20,096
- I can see that.

1107
01:30:20,096 --> 01:30:22,079
- [Narrator] He's made the wrong enemy.

1108
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:23,295
- Drop him, boys.

1109
01:30:23,295 --> 01:30:26,450
(bashing and groaning)

1110
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:27,669
- [Narrator] Then one man,

1111
01:30:27,669 --> 01:30:28,580
- Hey!

1112
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:31,243
- Stay out of this, China man.

1113
01:30:31,243 --> 01:30:33,410
(bashing)

1114
01:30:35,056 --> 01:30:37,042
- [Narrator] He found
a teacher and a friend.

1115
01:30:37,042 --> 01:30:40,375
(screaming and bashing)

1116
01:30:42,008 --> 01:30:43,908
- How can I learn unless you teach me?

1117
01:30:45,316 --> 01:30:48,040
- You want it easy?

1118
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:52,050
Movies easy.

1119
01:30:53,914 --> 01:30:55,771
This life,

1120
01:30:55,771 --> 01:30:58,104
(screaming)

1121
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:02,758
Train on ice will teach you good balance.

1122
01:31:02,758 --> 01:31:04,479
Balance good.

1123
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:05,729
You can defend.

1124
01:31:09,371 --> 01:31:10,288
And attack.

1125
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:12,851
(crashing)

1126
01:31:12,851 --> 01:31:15,018
(bashing)

1127
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,842
(crashing)

1128
01:31:18,842 --> 01:31:20,822
- [Narrator] Now, for honor,

1129
01:31:20,822 --> 01:31:23,350
for love, for friendship.

1130
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,840
- Make promise, keep promise.

1131
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:30,090
- [Narrator] James Caulfield
either fights for his life

1132
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:31,830
or he'll lose it.

1133
01:31:41,823 --> 01:31:42,656
(bashing)

1134
01:31:42,656 --> 01:31:44,906
(cheering)

1135
01:32:00,132 --> 01:32:01,350
College Kickboxers.

1136
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,761
- What the hell.

1137
01:32:03,761 --> 01:32:05,928
(bashing)
