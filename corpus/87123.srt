# I have a lover,

3
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,000
# A lover like no other.

4
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,900
# She got soul, soul, soul, sweet soul,

5
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,900
# And she teach me how to sing.

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,700
# Shows me colours
when there's none to see,

7
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,700
# Gives me hope when I can't believe

8
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,900
# That for the first time

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,700
# I feel love.

10
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,900
# I have a brother,

11
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
# Well, I'm a brother in need.

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,800
# I spend my whole time running,

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,400
# He spends his runnin' after me.

14
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,800
# I feel myself goin' down,

15
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,100
# I just call and he comes around,

16
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,700
# But for the first time

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
# I feel love.

18
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,700
# My father is a rich man,

19
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,300
# He wears a rich man's cloak,

20
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,300
# Gave me the keys to his kingdom comin',

21
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,700
# Gave me a cup of gold.

22
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,100
# He said, "I have many mansions

23
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,100
# "And there are many rooms to see."

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,800
# But I left by the back door

25
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,000
# And I threw away the key.

26
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,100
# And I threw away the key.

27
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,400
# Yeah, I threw away the key.

28
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,500
# Yeah, threw away the key.

29
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,400
# For the first time,

30
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,900
# For the first time,

31
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,800
# For the first time. #

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Wow... After Ijumped, it occurred to me:

33
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,700
life is perfect, life is the best.

34
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,700
It's full of magic and beauty...

35
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,900
opportunity and television.

36
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,500
And surprises. Lots of surprises, yeah.

37
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,400
And then there's that stuff
that everybody longs for...

38
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,500
but they only really feel when it's gone.

39
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,900
All thatjust kind of hit me. I guess you don't
really see it all that clearly when you're...

40
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,400
you know...alive.

41
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:56,000
I guess you could say my life only
really started about two weeks ago.

42
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,900
That's when I lost my best friend Izzy...

43
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,100
and found Eloise.

44
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,000
Eloise...she was something to live for.

45
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,100
And I guess that means
something to die for.

46
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Some people said that she wasjust
a dumb slut, but I knew she wasn't dumb.

47
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,500
Whatever Eloise was or wasn't
didn't matter to me.

48
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,600
She was the love of my life,
even though I hadn't actually met her...

49
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,600
..yet.

50
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,100
OK, Dan, wait, wait, wait...and surprise!

51
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,900
OK, this is one of the nicest spots
at the Million Dollar Hotel: "The Lobby".

52
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,800
People come from all over the building
and sit and talk about the good old days...

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,100
..when they still had insurance.

54
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,900
And, of course, to enjoy the television.

55
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,400
- It's 10 a.m. Switch it.
- Yeah, Tom Tom, switch it.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,700
I should tell you, at the time
I was a bit slow in the head...

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,500
..and that's why I did all
the dumb stuff for everybody.

58
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,500
Izzy called me "The Beggar's Butler"...

59
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,200
..and I liked the sound of that.

60
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,300
Dumb stuff is what I was doing
the day he arrived...

61
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,900
..all the way from Washington.

62
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,000
I had never seen anybody
from Washington before.

63
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,700
Wow!

64
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,100
I remember seeing his shoes first...

65
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,800
..and then his suit...

66
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,000
..which was like an evening gown
or something, only for a man.

67
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,400
You could see right away he was special,
even before he told you.

68
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,900
My name is Special Agent Detective J.D. Skinner
of the FBI.

69
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,300
Now, if any of you have any questions...
Don't touch me.

70
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,300
- You'll do. Take me to his room.
- Who...whom...who?

71
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,700
What are you, an owl?
The dead man, Israel Goldkiss.

72
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,800
Izzy.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,800
- Is he what?
- Izzy...was he...?

74
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,700
Izzy. Right.

75
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
- Geronimo.
- Whatever.

76
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Yeah, let's go to Geronimo.

77
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,600
- Geronimo, hi ho, let's go.
- Hi ho!

78
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,400
What is he, an idiot?

79
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,400
I remember he picked up on that real fast.

80
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,800
Skinner, man, I don't think you're gonna solve
shit around here. This place is a freak show.

81
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,500
Excuse me, coming through!

82
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Watch it, man!

83
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,500
I smell press.
Why don't you keep them at bay?

84
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,300
Sorry, sir, but my job was to chaperone you
and to make sure you observe LAPD protocol.

85
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,300
So, why don't you stay here and observe
protocol? You got a freight elevator here?

86
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,900
Tom Tom, why don't you take him up?

87
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,800
You know, a man's home is a man's castle.

88
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,100
- You know, a man's home...
- I heard you!

89
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,200
It's certainly a man's castle.

90
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Why did you say I was an idiot?

91
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,600
Wild guess.

92
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,400
Good guess.

93
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,200
We went too high. It's going down.

94
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,300
- Skinner.
- Hi, baby. Straight to the hotel?

95
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,100
Yeah, I'm there now... No, fine.

96
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,100
- You read the file?
- Strange one... I'll get it narrowed.

97
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,100
- A few days, maybe.
- We're gonna lose our reservation.

98
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,600
- Why don't you fly ahead, warm it up.
- I miss your lips.

99
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,300
- I miss yours, too, baby.
- Hurry up, or you'll miss all of me.

100
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,800
- Is someone there?
- No, just an echo.

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
- You better be careful.
- Maya, Code Blue. Bye, baby.

102
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
It's room 440, just down the hall.

103
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,000
It was exciting to become
a Special Agent's apprentice.

104
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,800
I figured I could learn a lot from him.

105
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
Certainly more than he would learn from me.

106
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,700
Detective Skinner, FBI.

107
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,900
This is my room.
What is happening here?

108
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,900
This is Izzy's room,
and you're not Izzy.

109
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Izzy went aerial, man. Wait!

110
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,700
- Is this some story about Izzy?
- We call this real life.

111
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,800
So what's with
the fancy Frankenstein brace?

112
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,500
Who is this guy?

113
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,300
- Yo, Tom Tom.
- Yo, Geronimo?

114
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,300
- Hi ho, hi ho...
- And it's off to work we go.

115
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,700
Now stand still and pay attention.

116
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,100
"Fancy Frankenstein"
sounds good to me.

117
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,500
I guess special agents
don't like to be called names.

118
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,400
They sure know how to get 'em, though.

119
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,700
John Dixie, Jessica Orville,
Eloise Ashe.

120
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,900
If they're here, I need to see them.
If they're not, I need to find them.

121
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh, that's tricky. See, our guests
don't have regular schedules...

122
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,000
..and since we've had this problem
with the plumbing...

123
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,200
Well, there's been a lot
of running around.

124
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm in a little bit of a rush, but I could take
the time to hit you with 10 or 12 violations

125
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,700
that would ensure you'd be out in the street,
laying a pipe in your hat

126
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,300
and using puddles for plumbing.
You follow?

127
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,300
OK, yeah. Why don't you try Dixie?

128
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,900
He never really leaves his room. 406.
He likes to be called "The Walrus". Could help.

129
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,700
Geronimo said that Skinner scared him and
that he might be crazier than all of us together.

130
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,600
We'd better warn everybody
he was coming to find Izzy's killer.

131
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,300
Someone's movin' the door. I was...

132
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,900
Ijust wondered if Skinner
could really be crazier than Dixie.

133
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Dixie was in a music band
called The Beatles.

134
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,100
Only they didn't know.

135
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,000
Special Agent Skinner.
I'm a detective.

136
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You got some Oragel?
This fucking cavity's going into my brain.

137
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,900
Morphine, Motrin, Tylenol, anything?
Come on, you call yourself a dentist?

138
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,400
Detective. Teeth, gums, gingivitis
are out of my line.

139
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,300
Where the hell have you been? I've been calling
you pretty little policemen for months now.

140
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,200
- We're here.
- It's about time. Somebody's trying to kill me.

141
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,300
If they succeed,
I'll come and see you again.

142
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,700
# I've heard it before...

143
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
# Someone came through the door... #

144
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,200
Oh, hello! Jump in.

145
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,900
Don't forget your shot again.

146
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,600
What is it with her?

147
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,500
She's a little fucked up, poor dear.
But her mother was really fucked up.

148
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,900
What the hell, we're all fucked up.
They never really got the hang of it.

149
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,900
Jessica, there's a cop coming.

150
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, God! I knew it! They're putting her
into my custody, after three years in hospital.

151
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,900
- How am I gonna handle it?
- No, it's not about that.

152
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,200
- He's trying to find out who killed Izzy.
- I thought he jumped.

153
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,800
Well, maybe he didn't.

154
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,800
I keep it inside the big brown bag,
inside the loo.

155
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,300
I've been calling your name.
I called Liverpool, Interpol, even Paul.

156
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,400
Since I wasn't officially in the band,
you know how it goes, it ain't easy.

157
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,500
Yeah, sure.
That's not exactly why I'm here.

158
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,900
Israel Goldkiss was pushed from the roof.
That makes you a suspect.

159
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,500
Jesus bleeding Christ! Are you paying attention?
I'm talking The Beatles, here. The Fab Four.

160
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,000
John understood.
That's why they had him killed, you know?

161
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,600
Now they're trying to kill me, because they
finally realised who's behind all those songs.

162
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,300
- But I ain't seen no royalties.
- Yeah, that's tough.

163
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,000
But either you cooperate, or I book you.

164
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,500
I've been doing nothing but cooperate
my whole fucking life.

165
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,300
That's what it's all about
to be in a band.

166
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,700
I'm not saying
they weren't creatively involved...

167
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,900
but most of the time,
they were off with that Maharishi.

168
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,200
You know, India, whatever, you know.

169
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,400
There I was, all alone in the studio
with my brilliant ideas...

170
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,700
Thank God I had George Martin.

171
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,600
George... Oh, that album in particular,
we grew together like this, me and George.

172
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,900
That's what worries me.
You're worried about some flying junkie.

173
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,900
You big mystery solver.
"Roll up, roll up!"

174
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,200
You better solve this: how the fuck could they
release that album without me on the cover?

175
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,100
If you want to make a name for yourself,
Sergeant, you go and figure that one out.

176
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
I only do one case at a time.

177
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,700
Tell you what, you give me a confession,
I'll look into those royalties for you.

178
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,600
I don't know, maybe it was
the excitement of everything...

179
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,900
..murder and mystery
and special agents.

180
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,600
Suddenly I just knew:
this was my chance to speak to Eloise.

181
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,200
I wanted her to know my name.

182
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,800
It took me a while.
You can be slow but confident.

183
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,900
I guess that's the way I am...was.

184
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,300
You shouldn't be smoking.

185
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,900
Sometimes when people smoke, they...

186
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,300
..they die, and sometimes
they even get cancer.

187
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Cancer.

188
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,900
And sometimes people die when they smoke,
and sometimes they even get cancer.

189
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,100
I can't die.

190
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,100
Oh, you can't?

191
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
- You can't?
- I don't exist.

192
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
So, how come?

193
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,800
I'm fictional.

194
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,100
Sergeant, I don't know
what medication you're on, but...

195
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,800
Izzy was a dreamer.
We were all dreamers, you know.

196
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Haven't you ever read the interviews?
Haven't you ever seen the tapes?

197
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,600
"I was driving to John's in my Aston Martin,
and I was stuck in that intersection, you know.

198
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,500
"All of a sudden it came to me,
as I went into a dream.

199
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,100
"Somebody spoke to me.
'All right, all right,' I said."

200
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,300
So people think God spoke to him.
You think God spoke to him?

201
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,800
You think God sits around writing songs?

202
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,600
I am The Walrus.
God's just the middleman.

203
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,900
Is fictional good for you?

204
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,300
I'm sorry, because I'm just trying to make...

205
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
..an impression, and maybe
even a good impression.

206
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,200
And I didn't know that...
Maybe you didn't remember me.

207
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,600
I remember everything.

208
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Everything?

209
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,300
Everything.

210
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,900
That's a lot.

211
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,700
I wouldn't recommend it.

212
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,300
- OK, OK, come.
- Huh? Do you believe this guy?

213
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,200
Doesn't seem to be anyone around,
does there?

214
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Nothing that my unlimited
credit card won't fix.

215
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Come on, come on.

216
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,700
You're from the future, aren't you?

217
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,500
- Yes.
- Yes!

218
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,300
What's that like? And how, how is it?

219
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
- The future?
- Yes.

220
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,200
- It's better.
- Oh, good. Good. Good. Good.

221
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,300
That's all Izzy's poems.

222
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,300
You know, familiarity breeds contempt.

223
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,300
- Oh?
- That makes you a suspect.

224
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,900
Me, a what?
That's the tar. The tar.

225
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,400
What, what is...
That's Geronimo's. It goes there.

226
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
- What is a...
- Suspect?

227
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,500
Well, that's somebody
who kills somebody,

228
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,700
until, of course,
he can prove that he didn't.

229
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,700
Suspect.

230
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,700
- Thank you!
- No, a simple "thanks" is ample.

231
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Wait. Say it one, one more time,
when you...

232
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,600
- Suspect.
- Suspect.

233
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
- One more time!
- Suspect.

234
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,600
I don't know if my son
was killed to get at me,

235
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,500
but I know that his death has
great entertainment potential.

236
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,900
He came from money and power,

237
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,400
lived with bums and Indians,
died mysteriously.

238
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Easy headlines:
"Far from the golden gates of Bel Air".

239
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,900
It'll be a circus

240
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,100
unless we find his murderer fast,
which is why Senator Cole brought you in.

241
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,500
He called you
"the heat-seeking missile".

242
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,600
- Mr Goldkiss, if your son was murdered...
- "If"? Of course he was murdered.

243
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,600
- How's that?
- Suicide is the lowest crime to a Jew.

244
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,700
We don't have suicide.

245
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,300
We never needed it.

246
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,900
Hardly ever.

247
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,900
Sir, you may have heard that I work suspects
as if they were all guilty.

248
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
In some way they all are.
That's just my style.

249
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,700
You want a frame-up?
Get the CIA.

250
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,500
You wanna stick with me,
you're gonna get the truth.

251
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,800
My people decide the truth in 60 countries
every morning. And in every one it's different.

252
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,500
The truth is the explanation
that most people want to buy.

253
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,800
And what my rivals want to buy

254
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,700
is any piece of shit they can get
to flush me down the toilet.

255
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,000
They won't find it before I do.
Information, that's my game.

256
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,000
This is Hollywood, my boy.
They invented the game.

257
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,100
They don't need much here.
One ounce of shit, they make a shit soufflé.

258
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,200
Well, thanks for the advice.
I better get cracking.

259
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,300
- Work fast.
- I need to. I wanna see my fiancée this weekend.

260
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,700
You have a fiancée?

261
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,100
Eloise moved like a shadow.

262
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,300
You could almost
see right through her.

263
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,000
It was like, in the day,
she lived in her body, but...

264
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,400
..at night she left it...

265
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
..for others.

266
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,500
I always wanted to protect her,
but Izzy said:

267
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,600
"Don't worry, no one can hurt her.
She's not even there."

268
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,700
I'll have it all figured out before I leave.
Facts, evidence, whatever you need.

269
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,300
Prosecution, persecution, soufflés...
out of my line.

270
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,300
OK. All right. I like your style.

271
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,600
Just tread carefully.
I don't want more trouble.

272
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Television!

273
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Oh, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby. Oh, baby!

274
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
So what usually happens
with a murder down here?

275
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,000
Use the toilet on the second floor.
Usually, they remove the body.

276
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,300
- Joey, where's the fuckin' hot water?
- It will be on in two hours.

277
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,000
- OK, you ready?
- Ready.

278
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
- So, Geronimo. That's your name, right?
- TV, Tom Tom!

279
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,300
I have a few questions about Israel Goldkiss.

280
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,100
- You must've known him for a long time.
- Jean Swift.

281
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,600
- The world is dying to know.
- Take a look. Look at this.

282
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,700
As far as you know, he's had
no contact with his father at all?

283
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
No.

284
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,900
Are you sure that his father
was this big, rich...?

285
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Izzy talked like he was educated
or something, but he lived like a bum!

286
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,200
It magnifies everything.
He shouldn't be making big gestures.

287
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,200
You know, it looks like
he's got ants in his pants.

288
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,700
- Excuse me.
- What's behind all this black, this dark...?

289
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
What is this stuff, anyway?

290
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,000
- That's tar - tar paintings.
- Tar?

291
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,000
Did you hear what she said before?
Izzy's father is a billionaire media king.

292
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,400
This is the way it is.

293
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,200
It's about all of the lives, the cultures,
the moments, that are buried in the pavement.

294
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Lost forever, without a trace...like Izzy.

295
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,500
Geronimo spoke of the Californian golden boy
who rejected his father's privileged life

296
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,100
to capture the lost souls
of the ghetto on canvas.

297
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,800
- They're mine!
- Look, Geronimo, your paintings's on TV.

298
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,300
No!

299
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
God is white!

300
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,300
- God is white!
- He's gotta be white.

301
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,400
- Do you think he cares about the Indians?
- No!

302
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
First the cavalries, then the reservations,
now the paintings.

303
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,300
My paintings! I painted them! Come here.

304
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,600
Why are you mad? Because Izzy's just...

305
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,500
Izzy's just dead,
but you are on television.

306
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,300
Television?

307
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Don't you even worry that it was me who killed
that little prick and that I'm gonna do you next?

308
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,900
Not really.

309
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:11,400
I worry that Very Special Agent Detective
Skinner will go ahead and take Eloise 'cause...

310
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,900
..Eloise was with Izzy
just before he died, but...

311
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,500
Yeoww!

312
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,300
Do you want me to get you a sandwich?

313
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,700
Suffering hair loss.

314
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,500
He won't say shit, eats dog food.
Unbelievable.

315
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,400
This place is a nuthouse.

316
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,400
(Spanish punk song plays)

317
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,000
Skinner. Oh, yeah. Hi, baby.

318
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,100
(Spanish punk song continues)

319
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,300
Me? I'm doing fine, just fine.

320
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,700
I can't talk right now, Maya.
Yeah, well, you go right on ahead.

321
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,100
Maya, Maya, Maya, I'll call you later.
Bye, baby.

322
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,700
- All right?
- Yeah.

323
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,500
OK. A few petty crimes here,
but mostly they're mental hospital files.

324
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,100
People that fell through the cracks
of the welfare system, got dropped.

325
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
Your psych-out routines won't work.

326
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,900
They're more afraid
of their toilets right now than of you.

327
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,600
Good thinking, Best. Real good thinking.

328
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,300
Skinner!

329
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,300
This is not proper procedure, this... It's not.

330
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,700
(Bells ring)

331
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,900
Good evening.

332
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,800
For those of you who haven't met me,
my name is Special Agent J.D. Skinner of the FBI.

333
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,500
They say nobody solves
anything down here.

334
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,300
Well, I'm here to change all that.
I know there's a killer. I know it's one of you.

335
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,900
And whoever it is, I promise you
I'm gonna get you.

336
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,500
Catch us if you can!

337
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,300
Power to the people!

338
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,300
Quiet! Order!

339
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,700
As you know,
your bathrooms aren't working.

340
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,800
But before I'm finished,
there'll be no bathrooms, no rooms, no hotel.

341
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,400
There'll be a big hole
for all of you to fall into.

342
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,700
I'll be digging that hole
every minute I'm here.

343
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,500
- The deeper I dig, the deeper you will fall.
- He's a dick!

344
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,500
No amount of insane
or pathetic behaviour will protect you.

345
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,700
No matter how despicable you act, I can do
one better, because I work for the government.

346
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,600
- I thought you were my dentist.
- See, I only want one thing, just one.

347
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,100
And if you can enlighten me...

348
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,500
..everything will be just dandy.

349
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,800
And I will spare what is left
of your miserable lives.

350
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,300
Are you with me so far?

351
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,300
Go back to Washington, Franken-dick!

352
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,200
Good. We're in accord. I'm glad.

353
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,100
Eloise Ashe? Stop there, Miss, please.
I need to talk to you, Miss.

354
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,000
Tom Tom!

355
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,600
I have a couple of questions.

356
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,600
It may sound strange, but...

357
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,500
other than the time my mother
came down to visit me and...

358
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,700
said she thought
I turned out all right...

359
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,300
..lying next to Eloise...

360
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,300
..in the same situation together...

361
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,600
..that was the best moment of my life.

362
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:43,500
And if you think about it, it was all
thanks to Special Agent Skinner.

363
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,900
Miss Brooks, Miss Brooks.
Hey, now, hold it right there.

364
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,500
But not everyone was as thankful as I was.
Skinner had finally scared everybody.

365
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,000
So the next morning we all
got together to make a plan.

366
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,800
And what a day.

367
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,800
All our lives were about to be connected
by a crumpled little piece ofpaper.

368
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,900
It was an I.O.U. from Izzy to Geronimo.

369
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,100
It said Geronimo could have
everything Izzy owned

370
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
to pay him back
for always paying the rent.

371
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,400
It was worthless
before Izzy died and became famous.

372
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,400
Now Geronimo realised...

373
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,300
he could sell his damn tar paintings
for a fortune and split the loot with us...

374
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,300
if only everyone would
just keep believing...

375
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,900
that Izzy really painted them.

376
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:40,000
And all he needed was a little help
from his friends and from television.

377
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,400
- Television.
- So let's get our story straight.

378
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,300
All right, first off.
Over to you, Stix.

379
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,600
I just lent Izzy my room sometimes.

380
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,900
Nice room, bachelor pad.

381
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,600
Izzy brought a girl sometimes.

382
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,300
- He never brought me to your room.
- No, he brought the ones from the clubs.

383
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Are you saying that I wasn't good enough
for your "bachelor pad", shit box?

384
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,300
Hey, no shit in my box, babe!
Ain't no shit in my veins.

385
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
- I'm gonna break your black balls!
- Hey! Chill! Chill!

386
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh, God!

387
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,300
- Anybody laughs, I'll crack their heads.
- Nobody laugh.

388
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,300
Don't you...!
Come on, Jessica.

389
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,600
You want some of this?
Come on, bitch!

390
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,300
- Oh, you wish you could!
- Sit down!

391
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,400
Izzy and me were engaged.
Yeah, we were gonna have a big church wedding!

392
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,100
In Beverly Hills with his whole family
and all his friends.

393
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,600
- And no one from down here.
- Vivien, Izzy was Jewish, dear.

394
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,600
I know that.
You think I don't know that? Fuck you!

395
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
- Well, fuck you!
- Fuck you!

396
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,300
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

397
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,200
Oh, well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.

398
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,800
She did it, she messed him up.

399
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,300
- He was gonna marry me. That slut!
- No, no, no, Vivien!

400
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,300
He didn't rape her.

401
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
She wanted it!

402
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,700
Jesus Christ!
You guys are all fucking nuts.

403
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,200
I may be a drunk,
but my brain is still functioning.

404
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,400
I ain't no freaky-deaky
yankee noodles, like you are.

405
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
No, sit down, you are drunk.

406
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,900
All right, all right. We're all fucking
noodle soups in our heads here.

407
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,300
But we have to figure this one out now.
Now take the ballots, pass them around.

408
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,700
We have to vote. Either we go
for this fucking plan or not.

409
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,900
We gotta decide.

410
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,400
We're living in this beautiful country
of the United States of America,

411
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,100
so everybody gets to vote.

412
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,500
You have two letters
on all these pieces of paper, right?

413
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,200
There's a "Y" and an "N". The "Y" stands
for why, and the "N" stands for why not.

414
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,300
But talk about exciting.

415
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,900
It was like those old men in the wigs
that Izzy told me about

416
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,800
who got together,
signed a letter and made America.

417
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,100
That was a long shot, too.
And look what happened.

418
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
The world was spinning fast that night.

419
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,100
Ijust hoped I could
hold on and be part of it.

420
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,100
# I've got no home in this world,

421
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,800
# Just gravity.

422
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,100
# Look in time... #

423
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,100
(Couple arguing)

424
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:40,200
# I've got no home in this world

425
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,000
# Just you

426
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,000
# And you are not mine

427
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,700
# Ohh, stateless

428
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,900
# Mmm...faithless

429
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,500
# Stateless...#

430
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,500
I tell you to tread lightly,
and you flood the place.

431
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,900
I warned you about the media.
It's already a carnival.

432
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,700
Now it turns out these bums
even own my son's paintings.

433
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
It's gonna turn into a cover story.

434
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,600
I got a long way to fall, Skinner.

435
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,800
If I fall, I'll land on you.

436
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,800
Well, I had the feeling
you weren't going to like me forever, sir.

437
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,100
So the plan was put into action.

438
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,400
We made a decision, and now we were
actually making it happen.

439
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,900
I've never seen that before.

440
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,700
My contribution was
to stay out of the way.

441
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,500
You still not gonna ask any good
old-fashioned detective questions?

442
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,700
Questions tell them what we're thinking.

443
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,400
And free answers are worthless.

444
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,700
But they're fucking with us.
It's a scam, I can smell it.

445
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,100
Well, if they wanna fuck, they gotta pay,
just like everybody else.

446
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,800
OK, how do you plan on doing that?

447
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,400
Are you looking for clues in the socks?

448
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,400
No, Best. I'm laying clues.

449
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,700
Our plan is in action, huh?

450
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,500
This is certainly dishonest, maybe...

451
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,900
You want us to sell the paintings,
don't you?

452
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,500
And make money
for all the poor people? Us?

453
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Is that dishonest?

454
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,600
That's nice. Very, very nice.

455
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,800
Izzy always said,
he said you're a shark.

456
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
- You're a shark in Indian's clothing.
- He was an asshole!

457
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,600
What else did he say?

458
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,100
He said that he thought
that you wanted to kill him.

459
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,900
Kill him?

460
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,900
Now, Izzy always hated even the smell
of Geronimo's tar paintings,

461
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
but he loved the little ironies in life.

462
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,700
So I'm sure he'd he happy to know
that his death was bringing us all together,

463
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,100
and all brought to you by Channel 6,

464
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,500
his father's enemy station.

465
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,200
Finally, things were
really starting to click.

466
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,900
(TV) Izzy was a painter...

467
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,900
God damn it, what are you doing, man?

468
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,000
Your trouble is that you grew up normal.
That pervades your view of the world.

469
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,900
That's not gonna do you much good
in a freak fair like we've got here.

470
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,000
Ask yourself how a poor junkie
can afford paints, canvas, tar,

471
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,100
and support a smack habit?

472
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,500
I don't know. Maybe his father
was still sending him money.

473
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,800
He couldn't even pay the rent.
No, no, Best. There's something else.

474
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,500
Something they all know
and that we don't know.

475
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,700
Something that changes everything.

476
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,400
- You figure it out.
- I will.

477
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,000
Something that changes everything.

478
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,400
Everything.

479
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,500
He wasn't very good, was he?

480
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,700
Skinner never liked to bother people
with questions,

481
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,000
but he did like to bug them.

482
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,800
What he was meant to be
was a movie star.

483
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,400
Izzy had that certain indefinable thing.
You could smell it.

484
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,300
- You got it?
- Uh-huh.

485
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,500
Izzy had that quality -

486
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,500
giving himself completely
to everyone he loved.

487
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,000
That's why I gave him my needles,
for his habit. What the hell?

488
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,500
OK?

489
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,800
Izzy really wasn't a painter.

490
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I mean, what he did...

491
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,400
..they weren't really paintings.

492
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,900
They were love songs to me.

493
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,900
I was very proud of everybody.

494
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,800
They were all saying
just the right things about Izzy.

495
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,800
Even I was believing it.

496
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And I knew Izzy best.

497
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,300
And then came Eloise.

498
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,300
And you know, Vivien was right.

499
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,500
She was a little like the Virgin Mary.

500
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,500
She was the one who really nailed it.

501
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,500
(TV PRESENTER) Is there something
you'd like to say about why you feel this way?

502
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,700
When something is sacred,
it shouldn't be talked about.

503
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,600
The legacy of Izzy Goldkiss,

504
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,000
the man now known as The Painter Saint,

505
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,400
by those who have inherited not only
his soul, but his life's work as well.

506
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,100
What a moment.

507
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,200
I felt really weird.

508
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,300
I wondered if that's
what success might feel like.

509
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,000
What you gonna do now?
It looks like they got you in check.

510
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,800
It gave me hopes of my own.
I guess that showed.

511
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,300
Bingo, Best. We're gonna play
a different game.

512
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,100
Talk about dumb, sure,
my name will come up.

513
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,700
Like, thirsty? Think of Coke.

514
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,900
Izzy always said:
"It's good to specialise.

515
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,900
"So they'll think ofyou first."

516
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,500
I know how you feel about her, partner.

517
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,800
And I'm gonna make sure
that you get a chance to show her.

518
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,800
Special Agent's honour.

519
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm gonna get her to come to your room.
Would you like that?

520
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,500
All I ask from you is you help me
solve this terrible crime.

521
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,200
It wouldn't be like snitching.
You'd be helping your friends.

522
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,300
Saving them from danger.

523
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,200
You wanna help, don't you?
I mean, you understand that.

524
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,900
- A bear shits in the wood, doesn't he?
- Of course he does.

525
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,100
- OK, partner.
- That's where you get out.

526
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,300
See ya, ace.

527
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,500
It was fun making a deal
with the big boys,

528
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,500
knowing the whole time
that it was pretty risky.

529
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,700
But I played dumb.

530
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,600
I suppose Skinner was playing dumb, too,
but he was out of his league.

531
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,100
No one ever knew where Eloise went
or what she was doing.

532
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,300
But I guess figuring things out was
what Special Agents were good at.

533
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Me, I was better at creating confusion.

534
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,500
Have a look around, Best,
I'll see you at five.

535
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,500
I tried, sir, but Agent Skinner has
a rather aggressive approach.

536
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,900
The third assailant was escaping,
so I pursued.

537
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,600
Agent Skinner shot the other two squarely,
just inches above the knee.

538
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,800
- I'll have a report early in the morning.
- First thing, Best.

539
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,300
(SKINNER) ..You haven't even dreamed of
in all those years at St. Timothy's.

540
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,700
So you seem to know
a lot about my situation.

541
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,700
Not really, but enough to know
that getting raped and killed by some punks

542
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,700
isn't exactly the best thing for you.

543
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,000
Well, at least
they're not doctors or cops.

544
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,000
I'm gonna give...you a real chance here.

545
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,000
Maybe like join the FBI?

546
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,300
No, to use your brain.

547
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Or at least you can use your ass
to save your neck.

548
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,300
That's really funny. Too bad you're a cop.
You'd make a great pimp.

549
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,600
Here's the deal.
You'll be treated fairly,

550
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,100
because as bad as things get around here,
they're only gonna get worse.

551
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,100
And you need somebody on your side.

552
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,700
I don't need anyone.
I'm crazy, and I got my certificate.

553
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,900
Anyway, whatever you do, they're just
gonna run me back to St. Timothy's.

554
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,300
But I'm not insured, so, you know...

555
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,800
No one gets their pit
and poison for free.

556
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,300
They're just gonna dump me back here.
I got no place else to go.

557
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,900
You know, you can only go
that road so many times.

558
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,300
I'm hoping.

559
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,700
- We gotta take both of you to the hospital.
- No, no hospital, thank you.

560
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:41,100
I can take care of myself.
Anyway, I'm just gonna go back to the hotel.

561
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,700
What hotel? I'm gonna burn it down
unless I get what I need.

562
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,100
I hate to play hardball.

563
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,000
You know.

564
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,300
I'm too scared to play hardball.

565
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,100
You know, just watching her.

566
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,700
But I didn't know that they stacked
baloney that high.

567
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:17,100
What makes you think Tom Tom knows?
Or do you think that he did it?

568
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Not likely, no.

569
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,300
So, which of us on the list
is more likely?

570
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,300
Everybody.

571
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:37,900
Do you know what just one night
with you would mean to him?

572
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,300
I guess that's 'cause he's stupid.

573
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,700
Is he?

574
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,900
So I'm supposed to believe
that after this, you'll leave us alone?

575
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,100
Yes, everyone but the killer.

576
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,500
Medical Services won't be able to deliver
your unit until tomorrow evening, sir.

577
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,000
- Fine, fine...
- Or would you rather...?

578
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:34,700
Yes, I'd rather be making love to my fiancée
on the Riviera right now. Just send it.

579
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:40,500
If you can't install the regulator into your back
harness, please call the emergency number.

580
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,500
Good luck, sir.

581
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,300
We cured it out.

582
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,500
Like never trust politicians
or parking meters.

583
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,300
Like on the first day, you know,
me and Izzy, when we got along.

584
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Seeing our plan actually
working was amazing.

585
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,600
I was just worried my friends
would be even more disappointed

586
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,100
if it all fell apart.

587
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,900
Like things usually did for them,

588
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,600
'cause they'd always been
what you call total losers.

589
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,700
It's a little early in the day, thank you.

590
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,100
I'd like to go to your room.

591
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,900
Look over here, Tom Tom.

592
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,600
Are you ready? One, two, three.

593
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,600
Venice is for lovers.

594
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,200
So you're a pretty smooth operator?

595
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,600
Making deals with the cops and everything.

596
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,900
I was just playing dumb.

597
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:34,400
Uh-huh. So, you don't know anything
about the murder?

598
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
Uh-uh.

599
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,200
You ever been in a hospital?

600
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,400
Not much.

601
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,700
Are you really retarded?

602
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,800
OK.

603
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,500
OK.

604
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,300
Can you do something special? Can you...?

605
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:18,300
I don't know, can you count
all the toothpicks in one box in one glance

606
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,900
or can you
talk to animals or something?

607
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,200
No.

608
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
No.

609
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,600
That's too bad.

610
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,600
- Why don't you do something?
- (TOY DOG) Bye-bye.

611
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,700
Come on, the look.

612
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,800
You know the look, no?
No, no.

613
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,200
The look. Do the look.

614
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,000
No. Not funny.

615
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,700
It's funny.

616
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,200
- No.
- Please.

617
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,000
Please.

618
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,900
Please.

619
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,300
- Uh-uh.
- For me.

620
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,800
If you're not gonna play retard,
I'm not gonna play whore.

621
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,700
Don't go for a doughnut.

622
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,500
So...

623
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,600
So why do you like me so much, anyway?

624
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,600
I don't know.

625
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,600
Tom, you know...

626
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,500
You can't always just say
yes or no or...

627
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,800
I don't know. You know?

628
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,100
I mean, there must be a reason.

629
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,100
You know, it'd be nice to know what it is.

630
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:23,300
So why don't you think about it,
and I'll wait.

631
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:51,200
Love can never be portrayed
the same way as a tree...

632
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,100
..or the sea, or any other mystery.

633
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,700
It's the eyes, with which we see.

634
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,900
It's the sinner in the saint.

635
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,400
It's the light inside the paint.

636
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,300
I always knew those lines
would come in handy one day.

637
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,700
I had to thank Izzy for that.

638
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,900
You understand that celebrities
depend entirely on my judgement,

639
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:45,500
because the line between art and garbage
can be thin.

640
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,600
Sometimes even artists cannot see it.

641
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:54,300
And sometimes it is my decision
that makes it what it is.

642
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:59,700
Therefore, the artist is often
merely the painter,

643
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,800
and the dealer is actually the artist.

644
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:09,100
- Right, the bullshit artist.
- Luckily the painter is dead, I can speak freely.

645
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,000
- Oh, don't hesitate, please.
- It is, of course, garbage.

646
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,700
I knew it!

647
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
Important garbage.

648
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,900
-Oh, important garbage.
- Social...

649
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,300
Psychotic...

650
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,300
- Erotic?
- Yes.

651
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,500
Yes?

652
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,300
Elegant?

653
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,600
No.

654
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,500
- Dark? Very dark.
- Very dark.

655
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,200
Yet optimistic.

656
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,300
Large.

657
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,800
Large...dark...garbage.

658
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,700
- Right on, Reverend.
- As art...I like it.

659
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,700
He's so right. That's great.

660
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,500
- I can sell it.
- Let's go!

661
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:12,000
He can sell it, oh, yeah.

662
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,400
They found this girl's body
in the garbage.

663
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,200
One of those bins
they have outside houses.

664
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,200
And it was full of concrete

665
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,700
so you couldn't even see her.

666
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,700
And they had to chip away
at the block very carefully

667
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,800
so they wouldn't mess up
any of the evidence.

668
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,300
And they said that they didn't know...

669
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,100
..if she had been molested.

670
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,600
Well, I bet she was.

671
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:57,200
I bet she probably was molested
in every possible way.

672
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,200
Ways that you can't even imagine.

673
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,600
Ways that don't even make sense.

674
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,400
Not even to the people who did them.

675
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And you know, you know,
the concrete was probably like...

676
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,000
..a relief, it was probably the most...

677
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,200
wonderful thing that had
ever happened to her.

678
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,500
Like some warm bath that you can just...

679
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,400
just sleep and sleep forever.

680
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,300
They chip, chip, chip.

681
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:35,500
They don't know any of the details or...

682
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,300
Somebody...

683
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,900
should cry.

684
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,900
Somebody should cry.

685
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:50,300
I had this fantasy, suddenly,
that we'd have a normal life.

686
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,200
She'd come one day
with her suitcase and stay.

687
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,600
We'd watch TV, maybe even go to the diner.

688
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:03,100
She'd look at me, and I'd feel like...

689
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,700
..I reached her.

690
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,000
You can cry! You!

691
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:16,500
Do you know who killed him?
Do you think I killed him?

692
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,600
You know...

693
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,300
..he's gonna try and...

694
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,900
..trick you, and scare you.

695
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,100
He's gonna hurt you.

696
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,100
Fuck Skinner.

697
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,600
Fuck Skinner.

698
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,300
Fuck you, Skinner!

699
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,600
# Every chip from every cup,

700
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,500
# Every promise given up,

701
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,100
# Every reason that's not enough

702
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,100
# Is falling...

703
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,900
# Falling at your feet.

704
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,800
# Every band elastic limit,

705
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,900
# Every race when there's nothing in it,

706
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,500
# Every winner that's lost their ticket

707
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,000
# Is falling,

708
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,100
# Falling at your feet.

709
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,800
# I've come crawling,

710
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,900
# Crawling at your feet.

711
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,600
# Everyone needs a friend,

712
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,700
# Every life has no end,

713
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,500
# Every knee ready to bend

714
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,300
# Is falling,

715
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,100
# Falling at your feet.

716
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,700
# I've come crawling,
