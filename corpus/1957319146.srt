1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,320
Shit!

2
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:03,367
Jeez!

3
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,065
God, darn foxes.

4
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:17,425
Muffin.

5
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,601
What are you doing out here?
Come inside, come on.

6
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,872
Jeez!

7
00:01:29,914 --> 00:01:32,048
Brynn, you scared
the crap out of me!

8
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,396
What are you doing out here?

9
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,139
You guys let Muffin out,
and he went away.

10
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:39,229
I... You're supposed to be
asleep in the guest room.

11
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:42,145
Your mom would freak
if she knew you were
running around out here.

12
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,973
- What's this?
- It's a tie.

13
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:48,804
A tie? Your dad wouldn't
like you running around
with his nice tie.

14
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:51,372
- It wasn't Daddy's.
- Uh-huh.

15
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:52,938
Come on, let's get you in bed.

16
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,341
Charlotte.

17
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,431
Charlotte!

18
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:10,826
Charlotte!

19
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:15,787
Charlotte Margaret Moon,
wake up!

20
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:17,876
You're gonna be late
for tennis with Birdie.

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,141
You promised Ms. Kelly you'd
help Birdie with her swing.

22
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,360
Now don't keep them waiting.

23
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,665
- Where are we supposed
to take it?

24
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,581
Aubrey? Aubrey,
I can hear you in there.

25
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,409
Why is the door locked?
Come on, let me in.

26
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,237
Go away, Charlotte!

27
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,500
Aubrey, I gotta get my bike,
unlock the door.

28
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:19,329
Go away!

29
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:42,091
Very funny, Aubrey,
but I've got a lot to carry
and I need my bike.

30
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,922
Open this door
or I'm telling Mom

31
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:49,577
that you wore her Chanel dress
to that party last weekend!

32
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,144
You wouldn't dare!

33
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:54,321
Oh, yes, I would.

34
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:57,106
Now, open this door
before I'm late for tennis!

35
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:04,113
Stop sucking Dalton's face
and open the door!

36
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,694
- Holy sh...
- Shhh. Shhh!

37
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,392
What happened
to Dad's golf cart?

38
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,655
I know, what have I done?

39
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,093
Oh, my gosh!

40
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,792
Dad is gonna be so pissed.

41
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:33,664
Nope. Panic. I'm feeling
panic right now, Dalton.

42
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,754
I'm... I'm gonna be grounded
forever after this, okay?

43
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:39,975
He's gonna take away my phone,
he's gonna take away my car.

44
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,630
My horse, you, my life!

45
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,632
Alright, Aubrey. Aubrey.

46
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:45,676
What happened?

47
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,637
Dalton and I went joyriding
in the golf course last night,

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,074
and I kind of lost control.

49
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:54,816
Ouch. There it is,
ripped off like a Band-Aid.

50
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:59,473
It is so jacked.

51
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,823
What exactly did you hit?

52
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:06,915
I think it was, like, a fairway
sign or maybe it was a fence.

53
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,004
It just happened so fast.

54
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:12,007
Aubrey. You are so dead.

55
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,271
She's so right too.
I mean, we can't take it
to the club for maintenance.

56
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,795
They're...
They're just gonna recognize it.

57
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,842
But don't worry, I'm sure
we can figure something out.

58
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,409
Right now I gotta go to work.

59
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:26,500
I gotta start loading
the beer cart. I'm sorry.

60
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,066
Wait, you're
just gonna leave me?

61
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,982
- Yeah, um, sorry. I gotta go.
- Dalton!

62
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,943
Charlotte.
Do not leave me like he did.

63
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:36,423
You have to help me with this!

64
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,556
Okay. Alright.
I'll give you some advice.

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,298
Pack your Gucci bags
and book a flight.

66
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,344
Dad's gonna freak
when he gets back from D.C.

67
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,868
Charlotte. I am serious, okay?

68
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:49,784
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do with this.
Please, help me!

69
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:53,831
Alright, alright.
We'll figure it out.
But after tennis.

70
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,747
You know, you are really pushing
the bounds of sisterhood here.

71
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,576
Alright, I got it.

72
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,013
Meet me at the gazebo at 1:00.

73
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,580
We don't want Mom
to hear our noise.

74
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,452
- Now, help me cover this.
- Okay.

75
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,240
Aubrey.

76
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,938
- Aubrey!
- Fix my makeup.

77
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:20,075
Good! Good.

78
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:20,989
Okay.

79
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,207
Alright. See you!

80
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,968
No, thanks.

81
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:45,230
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

82
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,407
I've got so much to lose here.

83
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,105
Okay, so, I've been
thinking about it
and I have two plans in mind.

84
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:52,455
Do you want to hear
plan A or plan B?

85
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,414
Plan A, I guess.

86
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,522
Right. So you're going to tell
your friends to come over here

87
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:57,982
with all the money they've got.

88
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:59,767
Uh, cash, credit cards,

89
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,856
Starbucks gift cards,
kidneys to sell, anything.

90
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:05,250
Okay, I think I have
about $60 in here.

91
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:08,210
Good. That's good, because
you're gonna need to sweet-talk

92
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:10,168
that creep Tucker up the street.

93
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,170
His dad owns Teed Up Golf Carts,

94
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:15,043
they'll probably be able
to get it picked up and fixed.

95
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:17,543
But you're gonna have to
pay him a little extra
to keep it a secret.

96
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:22,180
Wait, what?
You expect me to seduce
Tucker Gates into helping me?

97
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:25,096
- He'll never fall for it.
- Oh, yeah, he will.

98
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,534
He's had a crush on you
since, like, ever.

99
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:30,145
Now go on, put your big girl
panties on and run over there.

100
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,408
And be like, what? "Hi, Tucker.

101
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,671
I know I've always treated you
like you've had herpes,

102
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,847
but will you please
help me now?"

103
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,503
Uh, yeah. Do you want to live
to see your junior prom?

104
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:43,375
Listen, I'm telling you,
you have to go over there.

105
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,769
Be his damsel in distress,
you know?

106
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:49,077
"Tucker, sweet sweet Tucker.

107
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,601
Please, hold me.
You just have to be my hero."

108
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:54,822
No. No,
I won't be able to do it.

109
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,345
What's plan B?

110
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,611
Uh, plan B is kind
of like the truth,
but a little bit twisted.

111
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:04,092
-You know, like
how the devil does it.
-Ah!

112
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:07,574
Mom will be so proud
you're putting your Sunday
school lessons to good use.

113
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:11,055
But I'm desperate,
so let's hear it.

114
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,536
We're going to have to
get rid of the golf cart,

115
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,277
and pretend it was stolen.

116
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:21,501
Wow. That's actually
a really good idea
if we can pull it off that is.

117
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,242
Yeah. Yeah, it'll be simple.
We'll just have to
go when it's dark,

118
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:27,985
and push the golf cart
across the golf course
and sink it into the lake.

119
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:31,032
And tell Mom that you parked
in the driveway or something.

120
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,381
Alright. That sounds doable.

121
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:36,472
You're gonna have to
get Dalton to come to
the utility doors at midnight,

122
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,039
-and be dressed
for stealth mode.
-Okay.

123
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:41,695
Wait, but Brynn is
still staying with us.

124
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:44,306
-What are we gonna
do with her?
-She'll be fine. You know her.

125
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,787
She'll be completely tuned out
with a movie on.

126
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,006
Ah, thank you so much, sis.

127
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,368
Finn, you came.

128
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:06,850
Well, you sounded
pretty desperate. So here I am.

129
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:09,984
What's up with the Goth look?
You said to wear camouflage.

130
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:12,943
-Are we going to
a rave or something?
-Yeah, I wish.

131
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,382
That's who you sent out
to help us?

132
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:19,602
I'm pretty sure
I'm stronger than he is!

133
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,865
Aubrey, be nice.

134
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,737
I don't see Dalton here helping.

135
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,087
Yeah, you're right.

136
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,219
I should be glad that
you found a replacement.

137
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,308
Finn, thank you
so much for coming out.

138
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,025
I'm pretty sure you're
stronger than you look.

139
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,617
You know, one day
I'm going to fill out

140
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,228
and you will be drooling
at the sight of me.

141
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:41,276
Right. Okay, now. Come back here
and help me push this.

142
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:47,282
Alright. You think
Dalton could do this?

143
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:50,677
Probably, if he didn't ditch me.

144
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:52,722
Whatever.

145
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,073
It's fine. Alright.

146
00:09:58,075 --> 00:09:59,294
Keep pushing.

147
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,601
Stop!

00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,261
Scarlet?

150
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,937
- What are you doing here?
- I know you said not to come,

151
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,659
but we figured you'd need
all the help you can get.

152
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,922
We can't just sit by
in your hour of need.

We will be your lookout.

154
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,623
Scarlet made me come.

155
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,626
- You told them too?
- I had to!

156
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,410
You know I can't keep
secrets from them.

157
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:32,283
Be happy I brought some muscle.

158
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,720
You mean me or him?

00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,505
Brynn, I told you last night,
you can't be running around
out here.

173
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,642
- Muffin ran away.
- Yup.

174
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,558
Alright, come on, I'll
take you back and tuck you in.

175
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,430
Alright, come on, you guys.

176
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:45,139
Oh, crap, dude.

177
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:48,838
-This thing keeps getting
heavier and heavier.
-Yeah, man. I'm spent.

178
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:51,841
- Babe, I'm here.
- Dalton, you made it!

179
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,498
Yeah, I'm sorry. I got a flight
from work, but I'm here now.

180
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,805
Charlotte, thank God
you brought in reinforcements.

181
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:02,722
- Yeah, I think your sister's been eating too much again.
- -Oh!

182
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:07,378
Rude, okay? I am
a beautiful curvy woman.

183
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,902
Too much for you, I'm sure.

184
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:12,470
And thanks
for defending my pride, babe!

185
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:15,125
Aubrey, where's
Scarlet and Roxi?

186
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,823
Oh, they're up by the tree.

187
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,347
Roxi said she'll whistle
in Russian when someone comes.

188
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:23,177
Whistle in Russian?

189
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,134
Really, Aubrey?

190
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,875
Oh, right. Duh!

191
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,184
Alright. Here's the plan.

192
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:32,403
We're gonna move it closer
to the water and...

193
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:35,755
Aubrey, you steer it straight
and jump off once it gets going.

194
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,931
I'll take this side.
Finn, you take the other,

195
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:40,150
-and we'll have
the two beefcakes in the back.
-Alright.

196
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,804
- Thank you.
- Got it?

197
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,284
- Got it. Got it.
- Yeah, got it.

198
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:49,855
Come on.

199
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,017
- Aubrey.
- Aubrey, are you okay?

200
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:24,368
Just breathe, breathe.

201
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,762
Holy crap! What was that?

202
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,546
It was a dead body, for sure.

203
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,853
I know what I saw, it wasn't
a guy floating for fun,

204
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:33,247
looking at the stars,
wearing a dress suit.

205
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,250
Dude, I can't believe it.
That's my first dead body. It...

206
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:38,339
He looked like a bloated fish,

207
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:40,167
it's way scarier
than in the video games.

208
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,082
-We have to call
the police.
-No!

209
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,477
- Yes.
- No.
I can't be a part of this.

210
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,305
- My dad would kill me.
- But we got to.

211
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:52,570
No, it's true. We don't know
how or why he got in there.

212
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:55,138
Please, I just want to forget
all about it.

213
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:57,290
Babe, I really don't think
that's a good idea right now.

214
00:13:57,314 --> 00:14:00,361
-I agree with Dalton.
-Please, Dalton,
just take me home.

215
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:01,971
I'm with Aubrey
on this one, guys.

216
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,625
Aubrey, you're wet and shaking.

217
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,192
No, please, just take me home.

218
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:07,237
- I'm done.
- She's right.

219
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,283
We should all just go home.

220
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,000
There's not really much
we can do for that guy.

221
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,677
If we just leave it here,

222
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,220
tomorrow morning
one of the morning walkers,

223
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:15,898
they'll find him,
and they'll report him.

224
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,073
- Okay.
- Okay.

225
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:18,379
Sure.

226
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:19,422
Okay, we can do that.

227
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:23,601
You guys okay? You took off
so fast in the dark.

228
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:26,169
We couldn't see you.
What happened?

229
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:29,694
It's, uh, hard to believe,
but we're fine.

230
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,262
- We're all fine.
- Speak for yourself, Charlotte.

231
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,047
Take me home. I'm in shock.

232
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,790
It's crazy
what I'll do for a girl.

233
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,968
We got to get you home. Come on.

234
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:45,101
Please, just let her
ride with you.

235
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,929
Me, Finn and Charlotte,
we can run back.

236
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:54,502
Listen, I... I'll talk to
you two tomorrow morning
at the... at the park.

237
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:55,851
Okay, sounds good.

238
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:15,044
Oh, good morning, sunshine!

239
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,307
Hey, Mom. Hey, Brynn.

240
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:20,223
- What? No church today?
- No, we've got Brynn visiting.

241
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,312
I thought we'd just
take it easy this morning.

242
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,228
But, uh, don't we have
to take the food donations in?

243
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:27,056
Oh, we can take it tomorrow.

244
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,580
Besides, I think
Aubrey was up late last night.

245
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:32,690
She's probably gonna sleep
till noon, so, come on up,
I've got breakfast, though.

246
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,585
And ride my bikes?

247
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:37,023
- Not today, Brynn.
- Why not?

248
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:38,676
Yeah, why not?

249
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,765
Please, ride bikes with Brynn.

250
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,463
I don't think I'll have time.

251
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:45,727
Then make the time. You know
how much she adores you.

252
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,383
Alright. But I got to see
Scarlet and Roxi at the park
this morning at ten.

253
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,341
- Is lunchtime okay?
- Yeah. Great.

254
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,257
Oh, you know what? You should
ask Grant to join you.

255
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,956
I haven't seen him
around here in so long.

256
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,697
Mom, I don't even hang out
with Grant anymore.

257
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:02,874
Oh. Well, that's a shame,
you two were such good friends.

258
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,966
Mom? Uh... Mom.

259
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,009
Yeah, honey.

260
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:13,320
Dad's cart. I, uh,
I think it was stolen.

261
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:15,844
Oh, honey,
why would you say that?

262
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:19,630
-Have you checked
the utility room?
-Of course, it's not there.

263
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:21,719
Well, it's probably
up on the driveway.

264
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:23,983
You know, Aubrey's always
leaving it out up there.

265
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,159
Yeah, I... I checked there too.

266
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,812
I'm telling you, it's gone.

267
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:29,727
Oh, no.

268
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,559
Let's go, buddy.
Let's go, buddy. Let's go.

269
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:37,213
Oh. Hey.

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,394
I can't believe it.
That's so terrible.

271
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:47,745
I know our neighborhood
is filled with drama,
but that's just so unreal.

272
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,921
Oh, my poor Cal.

273
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:53,012
I mean, he was really,
really shaken up last night.

274
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,449
He didn't say anything to me
on his way home.

275
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:57,146
Were his parents
waiting up for him?

276
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,062
His mom was,
but his dad's out of town.

277
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,543
I'm sure he doesn't want them
to know anything.

278
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:06,460
I heard the siren this morning
and saw Chief Bud racing
into the neighborhood.

279
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:09,202
I just figured some old person
had a heart attack.

280
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:11,030
Poor Aubrey.

281
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,944
Yeah, she was... She was
pretty shaken up about it.

282
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:17,471
Wow. Your plan just got
a lot more complicated.

283
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:19,951
Yeah. This is serious.

284
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:22,824
Now your cart's
linked to a dead guy.

285
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:26,348
You're right!
I didn't even think about that.

286
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,395
Oh, what have we done?

287
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:31,093
So, your mom reported
the cart as stolen?

288
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:34,401
I assume she will.
After she talks to Aubrey.

289
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,011
Well, that's good.

290
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:39,928
We got to find out what Chief
Bud thinks about the scene.

291
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:42,626
Cal's dad says
Chief Bud is ROAD.

292
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,671
- ROAD?
- ROAD?

293
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:48,197
Retired on active duty.
It's military slang.

294
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,765
But my cousin Tanner
still respects him a lot.

295
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:54,247
He says
he really knows his stuff
after 30 years of policing.

296
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,119
Yeah, I remember Tanner.

297
00:17:57,163 --> 00:18:00,427
Damn. I bet
he looks good in uniform.

298
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,343
Y'all have got to calm down.

299
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,953
He's like a brother to me.

300
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:07,260
Alright. There's what?

301
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:11,699
Like, five people staffed there?
I bet it's like a fish bowl.

302
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:14,745
Scarlet, do you think you could
talk to Tanner this afternoon

303
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,486
and see what you can find out?

304
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,750
Yeah, um, I can make him
some of my lemon pound cake.

305
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:21,404
That'll get him talking.

306
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:23,363
Oh, also,

307
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:26,148
he told me the medical examiner
is a little sweet on him.

308
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:29,369
So that might help us
get some answers.

309
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,719
Great. I'll see you guys later.

310
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:32,762
- Bye.
- Bye.

311
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:36,158
I'm totally coming
with you to see Tanner.

312
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,650
- Morning, Helen.
- Oh, Chief Bud!

313
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,478
You're not at church with Bunny?

314
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,306
No, it's been a busy morning.

315
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,177
Choir is gonna have
to do without me today.

316
00:18:56,178 --> 00:19:00,095
Dixie radioed me and tells me
your golf cart's gone missing.

317
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,097
Yes. And I can't
believe it. I mean,

318
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,795
I've never heard of anything
like that happening around here.

319
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,799
Well, it's rare,
but sometimes things do have
a way of wandering off.

320
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,149
When's the last time you saw it?

321
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:14,544
Oh, well, Jack's out of town.
Of course, I don't use it.

322
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,546
Um, the girls like
to use it though, actually,

323
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,809
Aubrey was the last one
to use it a couple days ago.

324
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,985
She said she left it
parked in the driveway.

325
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,509
Is that right? You were driving?

326
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:23,640
Yes.

327
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:27,862
And when you parked it,
you left the key in it?

328
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:29,951
Yeah. I mean,
we always leave the key in it.

329
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,910
I was gonna move it down to
the utility room in the morning.

330
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:36,044
And you didn't think about it
at all yesterday?

331
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:40,788
Um, no, actually
I forgot all about it.

332
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,574
-So you figure it's
been missing over 24 hours?
-Yeah.

333
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:47,838
- Charlotte noticed it was gone this morning.
- -Mm-hmm.

334
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:51,233
- What does it look like?
- Uh, well, it's white.

335
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,888
It has Carolina Panthers
stickers on it.

336
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:56,847
You know, Jackie
just loves his football.

337
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:59,154
Well, I think I already
found it this morning.

338
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,505
Oh, that's wonderful.
You know, I just figured
some kids took a joyriding.

339
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:05,682
- Probably hadn't gone far.
- No, no, it didn't.

340
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:09,338
But it looks like
it might have been involved
in a bit of an incident.

341
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:12,602
So, I have to hold on to it
for a few days.

342
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,649
Oh, it's nothing serious,
I hope.

343
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,826
Chief Bud, you there?
- Yes, Dixie. I'm here.

344
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:24,397
Bunny called. She said you left
your cell phone at home again.

345
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,616
She wants you to pick up
some vanilla wafers

346
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,315
with a banana pudding
on your way home.

347
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:30,968
Alrighty, darling. Will do.

348
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:37,061
I'm not sure what to make of
what happened to your cart
right now.

349
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:40,804
But when Jack gets back,
just have him give me a call.

350
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,764
That's all for now.
You all have a nice day.

351
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:46,201
Alright, Chief Bud. Thank you!

352
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:50,292
Mom? You okay?

353
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:51,728
Oh, yeah.

354
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,777
I guess we'll just have to start
locking things up around here.

355
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:12,532
- Hey, Tanner.
- Hey, baby girl, how are you?

356
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,360
I'm good. How's your mama?

357
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:18,538
Oh, you know her. Stirring
the pot around town as usual.

358
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,322
Do you remember my friend Roxi?

359
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:23,369
Yes, ma'am.
How are you doing, Miss Roxie?

360
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:25,806
Hotter than ever. Ooh!

361
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:30,941
Well, if you mean
the weather, it is, um, humid.

362
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:33,379
So what'd you bring me?

363
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:35,468
You know I'm a slave
to your baking talent.

364
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,513
Your favorite, lemon pound cake.

365
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,210
Oh, yes.

366
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,781
Hello, Officer Hart.

367
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,653
Looks like you have
some good company today.

368
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:48,481
Good afternoon, ma'am.

369
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,787
- You're working on a Sunday?
- Oh, no, not really.

370
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:54,574
I just remembered something
that I needed to talk
to Chief Bud about.

371
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:57,359
Well, I'm sorry,
he's not here right now. Uh...

372
00:21:57,403 --> 00:22:01,668
- Can I help you?
- Oh, gosh, no. No, thank you.

373
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:06,368
I'm Scarlet, Tanner's cousin.
This is my friend Roxi.

374
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:09,415
Oh! Hello! Dr. Sarah Owens.

375
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,547
The county's
new medical examiner.

376
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:13,375
So nice to meet both of you.

377
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,397
Would you like to have some
lemonade and cake with us?

378
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,510
Oh, gosh, I couldn't.

379
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:20,251
But, uh... but thank you so much.

380
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,560
You just got some, uh...

381
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:28,085
some feather. Right here.

382
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:31,872
Oh! Oh my. How embarrassing.

383
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:37,181
Thank you. Um...
I'll be back... tomorrow.

384
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:39,488
- Have a good day, Doctor Owens.
- Bye.

385
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:50,934
So... you mentioned
I had to earn your cake.

386
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,198
What is it you want exactly?

387
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,026
Nothing big.

388
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,941
Just a little information

389
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,944
-on a recent death
in my neighborhood.
-Uh-huh.

390
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:03,686
You mean
the demise of Harley Trudeau.

391
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,733
Well, it is the talk
of the town in the station.

392
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:09,126
Well then, I'm sure
it's not hard to hear

393
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,086
a few tidbits in that
tiny office you all share?

394
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,653
True.

395
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:15,132
So, what's on your mind?

396
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:18,788
Well, we're wondering
what killed him.

397
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:22,270
Is it natural or otherwise?

398
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:25,404
Yeah, so weird him dying out
on the golf course

399
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,579
in the middle of the night.

400
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:33,194
What morbidly curious minds
you do have, little ladies.

401
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:37,241
I like it,
but it's gonna cost you.

402
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:42,072
This pound cake, a...

403
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:46,860
peach cobbler next week and
a pecan pie the week after that.

404
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:50,080
And I want a free
cup of coffee every day.

405
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:53,606
Miss Roxie is working
from that Java joint
until the end of that period.

406
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,697
Mm. Agreed?

407
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:03,224
Drive a hard bargain,
Officer Hart.

408
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,967
Agreed.

409
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,493
Yay! Call me later
with the details.

410
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:15,715
You've been saying that medical
examiner lady is sweet on you,
it shouldn't be hard.

411
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:17,456
Alright now. Never you mind.

412
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,720
Oh, I got my ways.

413
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:24,463
Y'all stay out of trouble now.
Alright?

414
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:25,855
Oh, we will.

415
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,204
- Bye.
- Bye.

416
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:28,248
Bye.

417
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,645
Hey, what you got?

418
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,517
Oh, no. Hands off. Hands off.

419
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:38,302
You're like a vacuum, Em.
Don't you dare, don't you dare.

420
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,740
Come on, share.

421
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:43,394
Why do you always get
the goodies and the girls?

422
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:47,181
- Poor Em gets nothing!
Don't you feel sad for me?

423
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:50,663
Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I do feel sorry for you

424
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:55,102
all the time, because you're
nothing but a pathetic beggar.

425
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:57,104
And don't you be eyeballing
those girls, alright?

426
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:59,759
-That's my cousin
and her friend.
-Oh, I know that.

427
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:01,282
Well, they're just kids.

428
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,545
Jeez, what kind of person
do you think I am?

429
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,547
I'm not talking
about them either.

430
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:08,681
I'm talking about
proper young ladies
that come around here.

431
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:11,161
You're always catching
their eyes, and I'm just like

432
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:13,424
grandma's wallpaper,
just kind of hanging there.

433
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:15,339
Alright. Alright.

434
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,428
You can have a piece of cake.

435
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:19,735
Just quit whining.
You're ruining my appetite.

436
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:20,867
Would you open the door?

437
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,958
Where's Cal?

438
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:27,003
He doesn't want
to join our roundtable?

439
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,353
No. He's sticking
close to home these days.

440
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,573
His mom was pretty upset
he was out so late.

441
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,967
I think he's grounded.
He couldn't talk when I called.

442
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,579
Oh, no boyf' for a few days?
How will you survive?

443
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,842
Don't tease me, Roxi.

444
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:42,758
He had a traumatic experience
and I wasn't there
to hug him through it.

445
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:45,805
You can give me a hug
if you want. I'm short of hugs.

446
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:48,242
Actually, I'm pretty sure
my hug jar is empty.

447
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:51,201
Finn, you desire
actual human contact?

448
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:53,682
Ouch!

449
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,075
Hilarious, Roxi.

450
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:57,947
Oh, get this.

451
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:02,125
Dish is, the victim,
is Harley Trudeau.

452
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,867
The notorious lawyer
on fourth floor?

453
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,521
It didn't look like him
in the pond.

454
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,045
That's because his face
is all frozen like...

455
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:11,787
Oh, come on.
His face wasn't that bad.

456
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,223
Okay. That is not funny.

457
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,592
That was the most
horrific experience

458
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,531
I've ever had in my life, okay?

459
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,403
And I saw the Sawmovies.
It's different when it's real.

460
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:23,494
Come on. Can we please just
remember that Aubrey, you...

461
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:27,542
correction, "we" are
in big, big trouble here.

462
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:31,894
-What else did you find out?
-Tanner said the victim is
in his early sixties,

463
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:35,550
obese and known to be
a heavy smoker and drinker.

464
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:40,424
Also, his body is believed
to have wounds from both
strangulation and hit and run.

465
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:42,426
Yeah.

466
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,081
So, the golf cart,

467
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:49,303
your golf cart is what Chief Bud
thinks he was hit with.

468
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:52,654
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.
This is what I get for lying!

469
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:56,571
Chief Bud is probably wondering
if the driver was Aubrey
or a thief, right?

470
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,574
He doesn't know for sure,
or else Aubrey would
already be arrested.

471
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,881
Oh, gracious.
I'm going to the big house.

472
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:04,187
No, no, no, no, no, come on.

473
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:06,015
I'm sure that's not the case.

474
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,452
I mean, Chief Bud knows
our family from church,

475
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,585
so that probably helps.

476
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,327
And it'll take him a few days
to come to his final decision.

477
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,811
So... all we need to do is

478
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:21,335
figure out who killed
Harley Trudeau

479
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:23,598
before Chief Bud can
jump to the wrong conclusion.

480
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,644
No, we have to tell the truth.

481
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,994
Giving my college money
to your dad to fix the cart

482
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:32,302
is better than going
to prison for murder
and then getting f'ed there.

483
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:35,131
You know what? I know
when it's time to get out,

484
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:37,438
and that time is now.

485
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:42,573
But I'm sorry, Char, but fight
or flight, I gotta fly. Later.

486
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:46,752
Finn, come on,
we can do this. Guys?

487
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:49,711
It's not over
till the fat lady sings.

488
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:52,671
Or until one of us
gets arrested, but...

489
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,324
three days is all I'm asking.

490
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:59,329
Chief Bud is gonna need
some time to conduct
his investigation, right?

491
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:00,373
Who's with me?

492
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:03,464
- I am.
- I am.

493
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:06,641
- We are.
- Okay. We're in.

494
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,774
So, where do we start?

495
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:16,956
-You sure this is
the Trudeau House.
-Yep.

496
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,741
I don't see any other cars,
except for Harley's Jag,

497
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:21,917
I don't see their cart either.

498
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,702
Maybe she's just out to dinner.

499
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:27,183
Yeah. We should just probably
wait it out for a bit.

500
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,532
I agree.

501
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,591
Do I hear someone coming?

502
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,071
No, that's probably fine.

503
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:52,861
Well, that... I guess
that could be...

504
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:55,429
Oh, well, they're
coming this way, get down.

505
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,131
You think he saw us?

506
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,829
No, I don't think so. That's...

507
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,569
That's Larson, her son,
but I mean,

508
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:07,136
he doesn't live at home anymore.

509
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,137
What is he doing here?

510
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:09,530
I don't know.

511
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,359
- Let's go check it out.
- Okay.

512
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:54,575
- Can you see him?
- Oh, my gosh. There he is.

513
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,840
I don't think he saw us yet.

514
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:00,755
Okay. He's right there.
He's right there.

515
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:07,032
Shoot! Someone's coming.
Come on, come on,
let's go. Come on.

516
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:24,561
Get down, get down.
Shh. I don't want my son to see.

517
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:28,957
I'll be right back, sweetheart.

518
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,001
Be right back.

519
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:38,967
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

520
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,055
Where's Dad's will?

521
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,230
I know you know where it is.

522
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,759
Who is that guy?

523
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,284
That's Foster, he's one
of the bartenders at the club.

524
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,635
- What is he doing here?
- I don't know.

525
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:59,292
- You know what, you're
worthless. Just forget it!
- Sweetheart.

526
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:03,513
Oh, yeah. Just go to
your little, happy place, your...

527
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:05,254
Whatever it is
you do these days.

528
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,784
Dad's always been
an asshole to me.

529
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:16,048
The least you can do
is go find that will.

530
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:20,835
When I get home...

531
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,446
they'll be on my side.

532
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:36,242
Come here, sugar.
It's time to play.

533
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,722
Oh, my goodness.

534
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,507
Did I see what
I thought I just saw?

535
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,770
I think so.

536
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:45,033
Mrs. Trudeau
doesn't seem too bereaved.

537
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:51,953
Alright. Let's go.

538
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,915
Alright. Let me see
what's going on here.

539
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,268
- Can you see them?
- Not yet.

540
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:03,747
Oh, there's Foster.

541
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,881
Alright. What is he up to?

542
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,539
- What's he doing?
- Oh.

543
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:15,107
It looks like, um,
he's making them some drinks.

544
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,369
Alright.

545
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:19,459
Where's Mrs. Trudeau?

546
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,375
Oh, there she is!

547
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:25,900
Looks like she's
in some sort of robe.

548
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,945
Okay.

549
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,469
Alright.

550
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:36,606
Oh, looks like some
swaying and canoodling.

551
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,566
- Canoodling?
- You know, like fun cuddling.

552
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:40,828
Just let me see.

553
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:46,355
Oh.

554
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:52,144
"Hello, bartender.
It's ever so hot.

555
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:54,537
I'm burning up
just looking at you."

556
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:56,975
"Oh, why yes, Mrs. Trudeau?

557
00:32:57,018 --> 00:33:00,152
I've got exactly
what you're thirsty for."

558
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:03,851
"Oh, perfect.
But please call me Winona."

559
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:05,853
Stop!

560
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,376
Alright.

561
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,336
Oh. Oh, jeez.

562
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:11,815
She's really going for it.

563
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:14,818
Oh, I don't think
I can watch this.

564
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,778
I feel like
an unfortunate fly on the wall.

565
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,606
- Let me see.
- No. No!

566
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,521
-Dalton!
-I just don't want you
to see that.

567
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:22,696
Just let me see.

568
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:25,915
Oh.

569
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,658
Yeah. Okay.

570
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:30,617
Um, let's just get out of here,

571
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,576
and you can check up on her
in the morning. Alright.

572
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,346
Hey. Did I wake you?

573
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,609
No. What are you
doing here, Grant?

574
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:09,197
I don't think you've thrown
rocks at my window
since we were, like, ten.

575
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,918
I just want to talk.

576
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,746
Cal said you are in trouble
but he won't say what.

577
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,228
We're fine.
We're fixing it.

578
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:18,186
You tell Cal to shut up!

579
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:20,971
Come on. Why don't you trust me?

580
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:23,277
I mean, we've been friends
since the fourth grade,

581
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:25,498
and ever since we hit, like,

582
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,587
puberty, you just
stopped talking to me.

583
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,154
Come on, Charlotte.
What's going on?

584
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:33,592
No, Grant. I don't need you.
Now go home!

585
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:36,161
Charlotte! Charlotte!

586
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:39,947
Charlotte Margaret Moon!

587
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:43,123
Grant, only my mother
calls me by my full name.

588
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,516
Now go home.

589
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,693
- But...
- Go home.

590
00:34:55,614 --> 00:34:57,269
- Did you take your medicine?
- Yes.

591
00:34:57,312 --> 00:35:00,141
Alright, good. Uh, bathroom.
Did you use the bathroom?

592
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:02,012
- Yeah.
- Alright.

593
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:03,884
Do you need some help?

594
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:06,278
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

595
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:44,925
Alright. That's good.

596
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,494
Oh, oh.

597
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,462
- Alright. Let's, uh,
let's sit here for a second.

598
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:03,421
Brynn.

599
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,555
- Do you have your drink?
- Yes.

600
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,383
Alright, good.

601
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:10,231
I'm, uh, I'm gonna go
look at something real quick.

602
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:13,780
- You... find some bugs.
- Okay.

603
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:06,354
Charlotte, what are you doing?

604
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:08,226
I'm, uh, looking for bugs.

605
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:10,663
Looks like there's none here.

606
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:13,883
Come on, Brynn. Let's, uh,

607
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:16,016
let's go look someplace else.

608
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:19,889
Here, you can use
your binoculars
and look for some birds.

609
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,717
- Okay.
- Alright.

610
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:24,590
Just, uh, stay here
and I'll be right back.

611
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:18,818
You are so silly.

612
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:20,515
Brynn, stay hidden.

613
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:23,301
-You don't want
to scare the bugs.
-What?

614
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,215
Brynn, uh, hand me your spade.

615
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:27,870
The... the tiny shovel
in your hand.

616
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:29,176
Give it to me.

617
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,219
Come on.

618
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:34,964
Careful, careful.

619
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Okay.

620
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:31,543
Alright, Brynn. It's time to go.

621
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,268
Mm.

622
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,999
Well, hello there.

623
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:23,089
Usually it's older men
on the golf course
staring in my windows.

624
00:41:23,132 --> 00:41:25,700
But this is a nice surprise.

625
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:27,833
Have you come here
to comfort me?

626
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,097
I'm flattered.

627
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,362
Usually I like a younger man's
attention, but, uh...

628
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:39,932
I think you might be
a little bit too young for me.

629
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:42,064
Now, shoot before
I call your parents

630
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:44,668
and tell them
what their precious little,
baby boy has been up to.

631
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:50,899
Don't tell me
there's such a thing.

632
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:55,382
You mean the kind of like...

633
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:04,434
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Carver.

634
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,003
Good morning,
Judge Talbott, Mrs. Talbott.

635
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:09,614
Ms. Wyatt, I love your hat.

636
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:14,836
Is there anyone here
you don't know?

637
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,883
Very few. But if your family
lived here as long as mine,

638
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:21,234
you'd know everyone too,
or at least their business.

639
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:22,888
Alright, well,
I'll be right back.

640
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,672
I'm going to go
to the bathroom. Okay?

641
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:29,459
- Hey, Sullivan. Hey, Birdie.
- Hi, Scarlet.

642
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,047
I saw your boyfriend
running across the golf course
the other night.

643
00:42:32,071 --> 00:42:34,813
Shh! Don't tell on Cal.

644
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:35,856
Morning, Mrs. Kelly.

645
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,252
- Hello, Scarlet. How are you?
- I'm good.

646
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:40,775
Not sure I'm too hungry though.

647
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:42,995
Especially after
hearing about Mr. Trudeau.

648
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:45,737
Oh, I know.
Isn't that just so awful?

649
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,347
Yes. It's hard to believe.

650
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,610
I just feel bad
for Mrs. Trudeau and Larson.

651
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:54,354
Sullivan, how about you take
Birdie to get some more waffles?

652
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:56,182
Okay, Mom. Come on, Birdie.

653
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:58,576
Help me get lots of
whipped cream this time.

654
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:05,539
-Sadly, I don't think
they'll be missing him much.
-Really?

655
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,846
I'm not saying
Winona did him in.

656
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:10,544
I think Harley is worth
more to her alive than dead.

657
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,851
But they did
get into it pretty good

658
00:43:12,894 --> 00:43:15,941
at the club's cocktail party
the other evening.

659
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:18,987
Oh, that party.
It was such a pretty sight.

660
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:23,296
There were flowers
and candles and garden lights
around the tables.

661
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:25,777
I took lots of pictures
and I had a...

662
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,823
You were... you were
saying about the Trudeaus?

663
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:33,480
Oh, yes. So... so, toward the end
of the night, um, about ten,

664
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:37,702
they took off on their golf
cart, just ranting and raving.

665
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:39,442
From what I hear,

666
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:43,446
their son Larson is a bit
of a spender and a gambler.

667
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,101
He and his daddy used
to argue quite a bit about it.

668
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:51,150
Wouldn't surprise me
if Larson did him in.

669
00:43:51,193 --> 00:43:53,326
He's got a temper on him.

670
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:54,632
Kind of like his daddy.

671
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:08,341
Hey. I'm back.

672
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,452
I just heard Mrs. Kelly say
she took lots of pictures
of the club cocktail party.

673
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:14,608
Really?

674
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:16,696
Mm.

675
00:44:19,874 --> 00:44:20,874
Be right back.

676
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:30,972
Can you check on...
Can you check on my jacket?

677
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:17,192
Well, I for one,
won't be missing that man's
big mouth around the club.

678
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:18,977
Ranger, my ass.

679
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,892
I don't know, Colonel.

680
00:45:20,935 --> 00:45:22,850
Mr. Trudeau had some
pretty good war stories.

681
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:27,507
I'm telling you,
there's no way he served.

682
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:31,511
I served for 30 years. 30 years!

683
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:34,035
Trust me, he's an impostor.

684
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:37,038
His tales' as tall as my boat.

685
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:41,260
I expect you're right, Colonel.

686
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:43,653
Now, Carlos,
one of the groundskeepers,

687
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:46,569
says the same thing.
You know he served?

688
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:49,442
Yes, I do.
Now that's a good soldier.

689
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:53,446
There's nothing burns me up more

690
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:55,709
than a prideful bastard

691
00:45:55,753 --> 00:46:00,235
who steals somebody's respect
and glory who rightfully served.

692
00:46:01,236 --> 00:46:04,326
Carlos said he often had
run ins with Mr. Trudeau,

693
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,720
especially at night
on the golf course.

694
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,809
You catch him out there
drinking, pissing,

695
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:10,811
tosses empties on the greens.

696
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:13,814
- You believe that?
- Yeah, I believe it.

697
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:20,734
Why Winona ever hooked up
with a guy like that?

698
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:23,389
I'd never know.

699
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,784
She deserves better.

700
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,614
I agree, Colonel. I agree.

701
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,228
Let me check
on that breakfast for you.

702
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:44,192
You are not gonna believe
what I just heard.

703
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:46,542
Well, you're not gonna
believe what I just did.

704
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:51,156
I AirDropped her pictures
from the club cocktail party
to my phone.

705
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:52,940
You are so awesome.

706
00:46:52,984 --> 00:46:55,638
I know. Let's get out of here.

707
00:46:55,682 --> 00:46:57,945
We gotta go visit
my mom at the bank.

708
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:15,528
Hey, Gina. Going for me?

709
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:18,183
- No.
- Ouch.

710
00:47:22,578 --> 00:47:23,578
Hey, Char.

711
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,201
Well, hello, lovely lady.

712
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:39,073
- You come here often?
- Hello, Cal.

713
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:41,510
Hi, Finn, I see you
both recovered.

714
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:45,166
Oh, no. The emotional
scars still there.

715
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,690
Well, I'm glad
to hear you're a survivor.

716
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:50,084
Yeah. And Mom's got me
on a short leash now.

717
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:52,130
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

718
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:54,872
But I really do
appreciate the sacrifice.

719
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:57,439
You should, because now he's
grounded from his girlfriend

720
00:47:57,483 --> 00:48:02,009
- and other unsuitable influences...
- Charlotte.

721
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:05,883
Uh-huh. Cal,
you have a big mouth.

722
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:08,537
Yeah, I know.
Anyways, enough chatter.

723
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:12,454
You want to play some
touch football with us?

724
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:15,849
No, thanks. I don't want
to touch you at all, you freak.

725
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,503
Anchors aweigh!

726
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:20,071
Cannonball!

727
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:26,642
Hey! You know what?
Cal, you're a real gentleman.

728
00:48:26,686 --> 00:48:28,925
Scarlet will be so pleased you
treat her best friend like this.

729
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:30,690
I don't know why she dates you!

730
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:06,465
Hey, kid,
you're in my personal space.

731
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:08,509
Yeah.

732
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:12,297
- Hey.
- Oh. I don't like.

733
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,778
Hey, don't mind her.
Getting your space is
her way of being friendly.

734
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:16,954
She's autistic.

735
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:19,521
Uh-huh.

736
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:23,047
Hey, Larson.

737
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,874
So, can I get you anything?

738
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:27,616
- I got soda, beer...
- No, thanks.

739
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:38,410
Oh, you can get me something.

740
00:49:39,324 --> 00:49:41,804
Or am I too poor?

741
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:55,165
Hello.

742
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,431
I said not to call.

743
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,130
I will get it.

744
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:05,611
Dude, I will get it.

745
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,267
Stop calling me!

746
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:22,454
Come on, Jill, let's go.

747
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:24,412
Babe, we just got here.

748
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:27,111
- Jill, now, come on, let's go.
- Okay. Just give me one second.

749
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:30,810
I hate when you're so grouchy.

750
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,094
She's fine.

751
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:55,661
She's tough.

752
00:50:55,704 --> 00:50:58,359
I just took my eyes off her
for a second.

753
00:50:58,403 --> 00:51:00,100
Come on, Brynn.

754
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:03,669
-Ow!
-It can happen fast.
That's why I'm here.

755
00:51:03,712 --> 00:51:05,105
- Okay.
- Hey. Hey, Brynn.

756
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:07,281
Uh, you swallowed any water?

757
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:10,415
- What?
- You swallowed any water?

758
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:12,808
- No.
- Um...

759
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:15,028
- What's your name?
- Brynn.

760
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,769
How many fingers
am I holding up, Brynn?

761
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:18,771
- Three.
- High five.

762
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,777
Come on, Brynn. I think that's
enough swimming for today.

763
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,476
Hey. When you see Dalton
with your sister,
tell him to call me.

764
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,652
I want to go later for pizza.

765
00:51:30,696 --> 00:51:33,307
That is if you can pull him
somewhere away from
his girlfriend.

766
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:34,569
Yeah. Okay.

767
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,227
Later, loser!

768
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:43,056
- Come on, Brynn.
- Okay.

769
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:49,018
Wow. Brynn and you were
busy little detectives, huh?

770
00:51:49,062 --> 00:51:51,456
I admit it was pretty cool.

771
00:51:51,499 --> 00:51:54,502
Uh, this is everyone we have
in our suspect list so far.

772
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:56,243
Hey, guys.

773
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,158
Did you guys
solve the murder yet?

774
00:51:58,202 --> 00:51:59,725
Glad you could join us, Cal.

775
00:51:59,768 --> 00:52:01,944
I'm on parole.
So, it's good to be here.

776
00:52:01,988 --> 00:52:04,164
Alright. So based on what
I found in the golf course,

777
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,993
it seems that Harley
was killed in the sand trap

778
00:52:07,036 --> 00:52:09,256
and had his body dragged
into the cove.

779
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,346
Yeah, I think you're right.
But who on your list
could have done that?

780
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,088
- Not Winona.
- But Winona has a motive.

781
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:19,092
We saw her come home
all liquored up and happy
with a bartender from the club.

782
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,876
Yeah, Foster Davis.

783
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,618
- Foster is a friend of Tanner's.
- Mm.

784
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:26,926
So, they're having an affair?

785
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:30,669
Foster is known to be a favorite
with the club cougars.

786
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:33,889
I think I might be a favorite
with the club cougars.

787
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:37,154
- Winona caught me outside her house this morning.
- -What?

788
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:39,417
Yeah, I thought she was
gonna pull Mrs. Robinson on me.

789
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,550
- Ew!
- Yeah, but she saw me packing
this. It was alright.

790
00:52:42,594 --> 00:52:45,553
That earring that Charlotte
found in the sand trap
could be hers.

791
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:48,556
Mrs. Kelly doesn't think
Winona would kill Harley.

792
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,558
He was worth more
to her alive than dead.

793
00:52:50,602 --> 00:52:52,081
And it definitely wasn't Foster.

794
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,668
I mean, he might
entertain wealthy women,

795
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:56,129
but he definitely
would not kill for them.

796
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,480
Well, unless they have alibis,
they're staying on the list.

797
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:02,527
Ms. Kelly does see
their son Larson doing it.

798
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:05,704
He's known for his temper
and blowing off his money.

799
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:08,141
-That earring could
be his fiancée's.
-Yeah.

800
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,926
And the other day at the pool,
I heard him take a phone call.

801
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,712
He seemed really mad about it.
Something about money.

802
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:16,105
-The Colonel was
mad at brunch today.
-Yeah.

803
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:20,632
I guess Harley boasted
at the club that he was
a part of the Army Rangers.

804
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:22,938
The Colonel didn't believe it,
called Harley a liar.

805
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:25,027
Veterans could take
a serious offense to fakes.

806
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:28,596
It's called "stolen valor."
It can even get violent.

807
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,383
Well, it sounds like
the Colonel is going to
be added to our list too.

808
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:34,950
Wait. Well, what about
the fights between Harley

809
00:53:34,994 --> 00:53:37,170
- and the greenskeeper?
- Carlos?

810
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,520
Yeah, he lives in a trailer
behind the ninth hole.

811
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:43,002
He would have been
on the greens that night
because he patrols it.

812
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:44,414
I don't see him
killing some rich asshole

813
00:53:44,438 --> 00:53:45,763
just because
he let him get to him.

814
00:53:45,787 --> 00:53:47,789
No. Put him on the list.

815
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:50,028
There are times
where I'm sneaking across
the golf course at night

816
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:52,403
to Scarlet's house
and he chases me.

817
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:54,753
You know, Ms. Kelly said

818
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:57,930
the Trudeaus were
at the club cocktail party
the night Harley died.

819
00:53:57,973 --> 00:54:01,760
She said they got in a fight
and left together on their
golf cart about ten.

820
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:04,110
- Oh, I got their party pics.
- Awesome.

821
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:09,028
Yeah. It looks like
all our suspects were there.

822
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:13,206
Yeah. And all of them drive
their own carts to the parties.

823
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,818
Yeah, or in Foster's case,
have access to carts.

824
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:19,691
Scarlet and I went
to my mom's office at the bank.

825
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:23,260
I'd say Harley doesn't look
like he's hurting for money.

826
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:27,481
My dad said Harley
and his business partner
had a pretty good relationship.

827
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:29,875
Alright, we'll take
them off the list for now.

828
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:35,576
So that leaves us
with Winona, Larson and Jill,

829
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,970
Foster, The Colonel and Carlos.

830
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:41,408
Well, we do know what time
Harley and Winona
left the party.

831
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:43,715
Yeah. So, Scarlet,
go back to Ms. Kelly's

832
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:46,457
and ask her what time all
the other guests left the party.

833
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,676
- Maybe she'll know.
- Oh, she'll know.

834
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,984
When she gets a babysitter, she
stays out as late as she can.

835
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:55,030
So, we just have to find out
what each suspect was doing

836
00:54:55,074 --> 00:54:57,468
from the time that the Trudeaus
left the party at ten,

837
00:54:57,511 --> 00:55:00,209
and when we found
Harley's body at 12:30.

838
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:04,475
-Uh, Roxi, do you want
to stake out Carlos with me?
-Sure.

839
00:55:04,518 --> 00:55:07,565
Don't you have a friend
in a lab or something?

840
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:10,350
Oh, my cousin, Stacy.
She works at a gene lab.

841
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:12,352
Cool. Do you think
she can run a test on this

842
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:14,398
and see if it's
a match to Harley?

843
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:16,400
Sure. She's cool.

844
00:55:17,836 --> 00:55:20,099
And, uh, can you two
follow up on Winona?

845
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:21,753
Oh, I can't.

846
00:55:21,796 --> 00:55:23,755
I gotta go to the barn
tomorrow and then to work.

847
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:27,019
Well, I guess
it's just you, Dalton.

848
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:29,369
- You take Winona.
- Take her where?

849
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:32,372
Cinderella's ball.
Hello? Are you listening?

850
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,200
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I'm... I'm just hungry.

851
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:35,743
I'm actually gonna
go meet Vonne for pizza,

852
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,595
- so I'll see y'all later.
- Wait, Dalton.

853
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:39,268
I thought we were gonna
get dinner together.

854
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:40,772
Oh, no, it's bro time,

855
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:42,455
and I gotta talk to him
about the Jet Ski.

856
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:48,040
Can we have snacks at our next
meeting of the minds please?

857
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,955
Hello? Focus!

858
00:55:49,998 --> 00:55:52,784
Alright, I'm... I'll
take Larson and the fiancée.

859
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:55,613
Jill works at the wine store
next to the coffee shop.

860
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:58,093
They come in
after she's done, around two.

861
00:55:58,137 --> 00:56:00,835
Great. Um, I can go over there
and see if they drop any clues.

862
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:03,708
Scarlet, um, you talk to Tanner,
see if he can, I don't know,

863
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:06,885
"bro talk" Foster into
telling him what's up
with him and Winona.

864
00:56:06,928 --> 00:56:09,104
Okay, I can talk
to the Colonel too.

865
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:11,063
- He's friends with my dad.
- Great.

866
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,021
Excellent, we're done.

867
00:56:13,065 --> 00:56:16,242
Okay. Dance off time,
us two versus you two. You in?

868
00:56:16,285 --> 00:56:18,462
You two are on. Come on, Char.

869
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,298
Ew. Could you pick
a cleaner hiding spot?

870
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:31,083
No. We have to hide!

871
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:33,999
- And, you know,
blend with nature.

872
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:36,828
Well, I don't want
to be one with nature.

873
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:38,960
You know nature and I
don't mix very well.

874
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:41,572
I know, but you're also
one of my very best friends

875
00:56:41,615 --> 00:56:43,878
who'll do anything
to support me.

876
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:45,053
This is true.

877
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:51,320
Oh. This maintenance cart
doesn't seem to have
any damage to it.

878
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:56,021
It is so romantic to see a guy
speaking softly in Spanish.

879
00:56:59,677 --> 00:57:00,808
Here comes Carlos.

880
00:57:02,593 --> 00:57:05,857
I can't tell
what he's saying
but he seems really upset.

881
00:57:10,644 --> 00:57:14,735
"I'm telling you, man,
stuff keeps going
missing around here."

882
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,653
"I get up the next morning,
and more parts are gone."

883
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:24,571
"I'll never get this Chevy
running again at this rate."

884
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:27,966
"You got to see my golf cart."

885
00:57:29,881 --> 00:57:32,274
Bro...

886
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:35,669
- "Bro, I'm totally
messed it up."

887
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,544
"I hit him so hard.

888
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:42,763
There was blood everywhere."

889
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:44,504
Holy sugar, Roxi!

890
00:57:49,988 --> 00:57:51,293
- Roxi.
- Shh!

891
00:57:52,425 --> 00:57:54,471
Roxi!

892
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:56,995
- Hey!
- We gotta go.

893
00:57:57,038 --> 00:57:58,083
Hey, who's there?

894
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:10,138
- Hey, Gigi.
- Later, Grant.

895
00:58:10,182 --> 00:58:12,271
I know what
you're up to, Charlotte.

896
00:58:12,314 --> 00:58:14,839
If you think
Cal didn't tell me,
you're crazier than you look.

897
00:58:19,757 --> 00:58:21,367
Carlos made it passed the dog.

898
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,673
- Thank God.
- Good.

899
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:29,680
- Oh! It's your crush.
- Shh!

900
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:33,118
Hey, Char.
What are you two doing?

901
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:34,380
Running from the boogeyman?

902
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:36,338
Good one!

903
00:58:36,382 --> 00:58:37,577
What are you doing around here?

904
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:38,993
I was just over at Dalton's.

905
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:41,561
He and I are going in
on a Jet Ski.

906
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,345
Cool. Those are fun.

907
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:45,652
You want a ride?
Drop you off at Char's house.

908
00:58:45,696 --> 00:58:46,958
Always.

909
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:07,456
Girls. Girls!

910
00:59:12,897 --> 00:59:15,073
- Yeah, Mom?
- Oh, it's almost ten.

911
00:59:15,116 --> 00:59:17,945
I've got to go
show a couple homes,
but I'll be back by lunch.

912
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:20,034
- Okay, Mom.
- Oh, Charlotte.

913
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:21,470
While I was at the ship's store,

914
00:59:21,514 --> 00:59:22,709
I signed you up
for sailing lessons.

915
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:24,169
I mean, they were pretty full,

916
00:59:24,212 --> 00:59:25,755
but they had this
last minute cancellation,

917
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:27,912
- so I was able to get you in.
- Mom.

918
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:30,044
What did I tell you
about signing me up for things?

919
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:31,916
Oh. Come on, Charlotte.

920
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:33,831
You know
how much I love sailing,

921
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,963
and just like Jane Aubrey,
I want you to learn.

922
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:38,139
Alright, but am I going
to be in a group lesson

923
00:59:38,183 --> 00:59:39,793
with a bunch of little kids?

924
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:42,448
Mm. No worries. I signed
you up for private lessons.

925
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:45,494
Okay. Is, uh, is Jay coming
home for the weekend?

926
00:59:45,538 --> 00:59:46,646
I haven't seen him all summer.

927
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,628
Oh, no, honey,

928
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,761
he's gonna be taking
classes all summer long.

929
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:52,632
I know you miss him.

930
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,634
Uh, look, I gotta go, okay?

931
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:57,289
- I love you!
- Bye. I love you too.

932
00:59:59,857 --> 01:00:01,815
So glad Mama is gone.

933
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:04,731
I don't want to face her until
after this craziness is over.

934
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:08,909
Well, that'll be hard.
Mom wants us to go to
the country club's next party.

935
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:11,738
Oh, yeah. Dalton promised
we'd go together.

936
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:14,915
Lately I think he's been
ditching me a lot,
but hope it will be fun.

937
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:16,656
No... it won't.

938
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,919
Ah, cheer up, sis!

939
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:22,531
Oh, um, Carlos chased me
and Roxi last night.

940
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:25,360
- He's looking very suspicious.
- He chased you?

941
01:00:29,582 --> 01:00:32,585
Scarlet texted the list
of the times our suspects
left the party.

942
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,240
According to Ms. Kelly,
the Trudeaus left about ten.

943
01:00:35,283 --> 01:00:40,375
The Colonel at 10:30, and Larson
and his fiancée around 10:45.

944
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:42,900
Mrs. Kelly stayed
till the party ended at 11.

945
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:44,815
And as she was walking home,
she saw Foster

946
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:47,295
driving out of the neighborhood
about 11:15.

947
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:50,472
So, does that mean
Foster is off the suspect list?

948
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:53,258
No, because
he just could come back.

949
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,043
Hopefully Tanner has
something to tell us today.

950
01:00:56,087 --> 01:00:58,263
Well, tell me about Carlos.

951
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:01,527
But you have to hurry it up,
I got to get to the barn soon.

952
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,879
Well, it was both terrifying
and fun all at the same time.

953
01:01:05,923 --> 01:01:09,274
-But I'll tell you everything
once everyone's here tonight.
-Okay.

954
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:13,626
Hey. Get a load of this.

955
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,584
"Chief Graham still
investigating the death

956
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:18,413
of prominent local lawyer
Harley Trudeau.

957
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:20,633
Mr. Trudeau's body
was found in a cove

958
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,854
along The Queen's Crown Golf
Course early Sunday morning.

959
01:01:23,897 --> 01:01:26,857
Mr. Trudeau is believed
to have passed sometime between

960
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,555
11 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. Saturday.

961
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:33,080
Few details have been released
regarding the suspicious death,

962
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:35,343
but Mr. Trudeau appears
to have been the victim

963
01:01:35,387 --> 01:01:37,737
of a hit and run
by a small vehicle.

964
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:41,349
Sources also report
a resident of the exclusive
neighborhood came forward

965
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:43,177
saying he was out late
walking the court

966
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:45,702
sometime around midnight
on the night in question

967
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:49,793
when he saw a unicorn
chasing a white fox."

968
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:51,751
- Brynn and Muffin.
- Brynn and Muffin.

969
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,274
"This is a curious case indeed.

970
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:55,233
The investigation is ongoing."

971
01:01:55,276 --> 01:01:58,149
Well... no news is good news.

972
01:01:58,192 --> 01:02:00,629
They haven't said
anything about you... yet.

973
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:11,292
- Hey there.
- Hey. This cart's kinda flat.

974
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:13,425
I keep filling it up
but it just gets slow again.

975
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:14,905
Maybe you should
go get cart two.

976
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:16,776
It's fine.
I'll fill it when I come back.

977
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,387
No, um, you should
probably go get cart two.

978
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:21,912
Are you alright?

979
01:02:21,955 --> 01:02:22,869
I'm not sure.

980
01:02:22,913 --> 01:02:24,653
It's just really hot.

981
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:26,394
Are you gonna be okay to work?

982
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:29,833
So kind of you to worry.

983
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,748
Well, now I'm afraid
to let you go.

984
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,575
Then don't.

985
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:35,926
Admit it, you want me.

986
01:02:37,971 --> 01:02:41,148
Dalton, make no mistake.

987
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:45,631
I'm a woman
and I'm nothing like that little
teenybopper girlfriend of yours.

988
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:48,373
So the question is...

989
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,810
is the man in you
ready for me?

990
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:52,943
I think I'd like to find out.

991
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:56,598
And the little princess,
you'd dump her for me, right?

992
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:57,642
Maybe.

993
01:03:00,646 --> 01:03:04,432
So, why did you do this job
when I hear you're rich?

994
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:07,087
My parents have money, not me.

995
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:09,220
And I'd say we're well-off.

996
01:03:09,263 --> 01:03:11,048
Plus, rich is relative.

997
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:14,834
Well, relative to me,
you're rich.

998
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,618
Well, I'm not a trust fund kid.

999
01:03:16,662 --> 01:03:18,403
I have to make my own way
like my dad did.

1000
01:03:18,446 --> 01:03:21,319
Oh. How boring.

1001
01:03:21,362 --> 01:03:23,930
And here I was
briefly interested in you.

1002
01:03:30,328 --> 01:03:31,808
Hey, buddy.

1003
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,853
Oh. Uh, hey, what's the word?

1004
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:38,031
The word... spider.

1005
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:39,685
Just don't get caught up
in her web.

1006
01:03:46,953 --> 01:03:50,522
Hey, Foster. Nice to see you.

1007
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:53,264
Hey, long time, man.

1008
01:03:53,307 --> 01:03:54,874
What you been up to?

1009
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:56,702
I hope you ain't been
working all the time.

1010
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:59,923
I've been squeezing in
time for fun, you know me.

1011
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:02,055
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1012
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:04,362
Ever since you dated
my sister in high school.

1013
01:04:04,405 --> 01:04:06,930
Yeah.
Ouch. Don't remind me.

1014
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:10,803
You know, high school is
further back for me than you.

1015
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:15,112
Well, uh, speaking matters
of the heart and, uh...

1016
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:16,504
other body parts...

1017
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:21,031
heard you and Ms. Trudeau
are an item.

1018
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:23,468
Uh, where'd you hear that?

1019
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:27,211
The winds of gossip.

1020
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:28,473
Isn't that true?

1021
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:31,911
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

1022
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:34,827
Been going on for, uh,
a few months now.

1023
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,874
I mean, it's nothing
serious, but, uh,

1024
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:39,571
don't tell anyone. Alright?

1025
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:41,921
Dude.

1026
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:43,314
What's up with that?

1027
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:45,577
She's got, like, what,
25 years on you.

1028
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,970
What can I say?

1029
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:49,624
I mean,
she was offering and really,

1030
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:51,713
you know, she's a blast.

1031
01:04:51,757 --> 01:04:52,845
Okay.

1032
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:59,025
And what about her, uh,
husband's suspicious death?

1033
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:00,418
That don't worry you now?

1034
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:04,030
Nah, she's a genuine sweetie.

1035
01:05:04,074 --> 01:05:06,119
I've known some sly women.

1036
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,468
She's not one of them.

1037
01:05:09,253 --> 01:05:11,995
It's weird though... her husband
winding up in the lake

1038
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:13,735
while she's waiting
for me in my place.

1039
01:05:15,259 --> 01:05:16,651
You sure about that?

1040
01:05:16,695 --> 01:05:18,740
Yeah, man. I mean...

1041
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:20,873
Winona and Harley
left the club cocktail party,

1042
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,440
uh, about ten or so.

1043
01:05:22,483 --> 01:05:24,790
You know,
same time I sent Gina home.

1044
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:27,924
By 10:25, she was sending me
pics from my condo.

1045
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:30,752
Check these out.

1046
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:35,322
You see the time stamp?

1047
01:05:36,976 --> 01:05:39,416
You know, they estimate Harley's
time of death after 11. So...

1048
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,287
Besides, Chief Bud
found Harley's golf cart
back at the club.

1049
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,332
Not a scratch on it.

1050
01:05:45,376 --> 01:05:46,420
True.

1051
01:05:48,466 --> 01:05:50,076
So you just went
right home after work?

1052
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:52,731
Yeah, briefly.

1053
01:05:54,646 --> 01:05:58,041
You're
asking all this officially
or unofficially?

1054
01:05:58,084 --> 01:06:00,565
Unofficially. Of course.

1055
01:06:00,608 --> 01:06:01,914
Of course.

1056
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:06,963
Well, I'll tell you the same
thing I told Chief Bud. Yeah.

1057
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:10,444
Got home 11:20,
changed, then, uh...

1058
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:12,533
Winona and I went out
to the Chill Martini.

1059
01:06:12,577 --> 01:06:14,971
Got there about 20 to midnight.

1060
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:16,755
When did you leave?

1061
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:18,278
Stayed till closing at two.

1062
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:23,022
You know, you ask a lot of these
unofficial questions, man.

1063
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,372
No worries, man.

1064
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,940
I... just out of curiosity.

1065
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,422
-Yeah.
-Chief Bud's working
the case, not me.

1066
01:06:31,465 --> 01:06:34,512
Ah. Yeah. Alright.
I doubt that, Tanner.

1067
01:06:34,555 --> 01:06:36,993
I mean, you're trying to
beat Chief Bud to the punch
on this?

1068
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,954
I admit I'd like him to trust me
a little more, but, uh...

1069
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,217
No, that's not it.

1070
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:47,742
This is so unusual.

1071
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:50,223
Harley dying out there
on the golf course like that.

1072
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:53,531
Yeah. Well,
I'm not surprised. I mean...

1073
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:57,187
Don't let these luxury homes
and manicured lawns fool you.

1074
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:58,666
I see and hear plenty.

1075
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,630
Sure you do, my friend.

1076
01:07:06,674 --> 01:07:07,936
Sure you do.

1077
01:07:14,421 --> 01:07:16,945
Why do I keep letting you
talk me into this stuff?

1078
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:20,253
Because I didn't want to go
alone, and you're my friend.

1079
01:07:20,297 --> 01:07:22,995
You torture me, Charlotte.
I felt a lot braver last night

1080
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,146
when we were playing
Call of Duty,

1081
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,042
but I'm just tired.

1082
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,045
Here. Have my latte.

1083
01:07:32,439 --> 01:07:34,746
This is my payment
for being your bodyguard?

1084
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:37,575
- Half a latte?
- Do you want my cookie?

1085
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:40,533
Yes.

1086
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,189
So, what are we supposed to do?

1087
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:45,844
Just talk and act like
we don't notice them.

1088
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:50,153
- But what do we talk about?
- Same thing we always do.

1089
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:52,546
You know, like video games,
skateboarding,

1090
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,418
anime stuff... Here they come.

1091
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:57,595
You sure you'll be ready?
I mean...

1092
01:07:57,638 --> 01:07:59,945
- Maybe we just need to postpone.
- I'm fine, Jill.

1093
01:07:59,988 --> 01:08:01,425
We're not postponing.

1094
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:08,171
My dad and I...
weren't close anymore.

1095
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:11,391
Okay, if you say so.

1096
01:08:14,046 --> 01:08:17,484
Oh, shoot. I think they messed
up my drink order again.

1097
01:08:17,528 --> 01:08:21,444
You did order me
a skinny soy ginger latte
with organic whip, right?

1098
01:08:21,487 --> 01:08:23,228
- Of course.
- Mm.

1099
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:26,841
It tastes funny for some reason.
Oh, my gosh.

1100
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:29,496
I just remembered, I had
the best idea for our wedding.

1101
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,237
- Okay...
- Let's decorate your go-kart

1102
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:34,762
to be the escape vehicle
for our reception!

1103
01:08:36,242 --> 01:08:38,288
Sorry, hun, I got rid of it.

1104
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:41,769
-What? Why? We had
so much fun on that car.
-I'm sorry, babe.

1105
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:43,206
I had to sell it.

1106
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:44,816
I don't understand, why?

1107
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:47,166
Just trust me, Jill.
I had to get rid of it.

1108
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:51,344
Okay. Jeez, it's like one of
those little trust exercises.

1109
01:08:51,388 --> 01:08:55,086
But after our marriage,
no more secrets, okay, babe?

1110
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:58,656
- Just kiss me, beautiful.
- Ah. Sorry, babe, can't yet.

1111
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:02,442
- I'm serious about us taking
a break until after our big day.

1112
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:05,184
Jill, we lived together
for two years now. Come on.

1113
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:08,969
I know, but if we take
a little break it will be
just that much more special.

1114
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:11,886
- You know, our first time
as husband and wife.

1115
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,280
Come on now, babe. No pouting.

1116
01:09:15,237 --> 01:09:17,718
Hey. Good news.

1117
01:09:17,762 --> 01:09:21,200
I've got enough money to pay for
both trips to Paris and Venice.

1118
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:25,422
- Mm.
- And in every country we'll be
doing it along the way.

1119
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:27,859
Please, Larson.
Okay, your cart was awesome,

1120
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:31,122
-but it's not enough
to fund our honeymoon, babe.
-No, of course not.

1121
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:34,692
Don't worry.
I've taken care of it.

1122
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:36,433
We're gonna have
plenty of money soon.

1123
01:09:37,956 --> 01:09:42,916
I have... It's another
trust exercise. Okay?

1124
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,960
Okay.

1125
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:47,747
- Happy?
- Super!

1126
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:49,663
Let's take a walk down
to the bridal shop,

1127
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:52,578
and you show me what outrageous
dresses you picked out

1128
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:54,712
- to torture
those bridesmaids with.
- Yes!

1129
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:56,844
Oh, now.
What are we going to wear

1130
01:09:56,888 --> 01:09:59,325
to the club's
cocktail party tomorrow night?

1131
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:02,154
Oh, wait, I know. I'll wear
floral, you wear gingham.

1132
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,809
-We'll look as fresh
as a summer picnic!
-Come on, Jill!

1133
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:27,309
Bill!

1134
01:10:27,353 --> 01:10:29,746
This looks ridiculous!

1135
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:35,448
Now you know you can afford
to have the name properly
painted on there.

1136
01:10:35,492 --> 01:10:38,016
I will. I will.

1137
01:10:40,844 --> 01:10:42,585
Your knee still aching?

1138
01:10:43,848 --> 01:10:48,068
Bill, I have told you a hundred
times ago, get that looked at.

1139
01:10:48,112 --> 01:10:50,071
Now, why haven't you gone yet?

1140
01:10:50,115 --> 01:10:53,249
Marilyn. I've been busy.

1141
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:57,688
I forget it hurts
until it hurts. You know me.

1142
01:10:57,731 --> 01:11:00,255
Yes, I do know you.

1143
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:02,648
So if you need me to call
and make an appointment for you,

1144
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:05,391
I will.
You just got to tell me when.

1145
01:11:05,434 --> 01:11:10,178
Marilyn, thanks,
but I don't need you
to make no appointment for me.

1146
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:12,702
I do it when I do it.

1147
01:11:12,746 --> 01:11:15,793
You just fussing
because you want me
to finish your to-do list.

1148
01:11:15,835 --> 01:11:18,404
- My to-do list?
- Yes.

1149
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,058
Our to-do list.

1150
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,931
Now, we may be divorced, Bill,
but you promised me

1151
01:11:23,975 --> 01:11:26,064
you'd help me take care
of our family home.

1152
01:11:26,107 --> 01:11:28,066
So I'm gonna hold you to that.

1153
01:11:28,109 --> 01:11:31,243
And besides, Jill's wedding
will be here before you know it.

1154
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:35,334
And I know you don't want
to let your baby girl down.
I know that.

1155
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:37,205
So, get that knee looked at,

1156
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:39,338
because you don't do
anybody any good

1157
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:41,427
sitting around
on your bum all day.

1158
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:42,559
Yes, ma'am.

1159
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:47,955
- Hi, Ms. Connor.
- Hi, Scarlet.

1160
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:49,261
Have a good day.

1161
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,263
Hello, Colonel.

1162
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,874
Hey, Miss Lady, what you up to?

1163
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:56,398
Looking for someone to share
my coconut cupcakes with.

1164
01:11:56,442 --> 01:11:58,966
I made them for Daddy, but
he had to fly off to New York.

1165
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,404
If that's an offer,
I'd love one.

1166
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:03,231
Think your mom would want one?

1167
01:12:03,275 --> 01:12:05,146
Oh, you know her,
she's on a diet.

1168
01:12:06,147 --> 01:12:08,280
I should be on
one myself, but...

1169
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:12,371
you only live once and I
don't want to have any regrets.

1170
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,288
Mm.

1171
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,422
-Miss, you are
one of the best bakers I know.
-Thank you.

1172
01:12:19,465 --> 01:12:21,206
It's like it's your super power.

1173
01:12:23,164 --> 01:12:26,603
So, Colonel, I noticed
your golf cart isn't
in its usual parking space.

1174
01:12:27,517 --> 01:12:31,259
Well, uh, I had...
I had an incident and, uh...

1175
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:33,349
- sent her off for repairs.
- Oh, my!

1176
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,655
Um, what happened?

1177
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:38,309
Uh, well, it was late

1178
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:41,094
and dark and I was coming
back from the club,

1179
01:12:41,139 --> 01:12:43,663
and, you know, I...
I hit something.

1180
01:12:43,707 --> 01:12:46,449
Oh, my. I sure hope
it wasn't a person.

1181
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:49,407
Oh, God. No, it was,
gracious, no, it was...

1182
01:12:49,452 --> 01:12:51,671
It was like, uh, it was like a,

1183
01:12:51,715 --> 01:12:54,370
you know, it was like a post,
you know, in the parking lot.

1184
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,111
- You know?
- Oh.

1185
01:12:57,155 --> 01:13:00,724
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. And anyhow,
take this out, I got to...

1186
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:03,422
I gotta go get dressed
for dinner and, uh...

1187
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:05,903
- No, no, no.
I understand that, but hey.

1188
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:08,166
Yeah, it's time for you to go,
young lady, and, uh...

1189
01:13:08,209 --> 01:13:11,343
Yeah. Yeah. And I... I'll be
seeing you and your parents

1190
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,520
tomorrow night at the club.
Hey, you have... Yeah.

1191
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:16,542
- Yeah. You have a good night.
- Okay. Bye. Thank you.

1192
01:13:16,566 --> 01:13:19,786
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

1193
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,621
Okay.

1194
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,887
Oh, hey, Char. You've finally
come to learn from the master.

1195
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:36,499
Uh, you're
my sailing instructor?

1196
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:38,239
I know, right? Lucky.

1197
01:13:38,282 --> 01:13:41,373
Um, alright. So I am
going to take us for a sail.

1198
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:43,612
Uh, I'll just teach you parts
of the boat, sailing terms

1199
01:13:43,636 --> 01:13:45,638
while we're out on the water.
Is that cool?

1200
01:13:45,682 --> 01:13:47,814
- Okay.
- Alright.

1201
01:13:47,858 --> 01:13:49,425
First things first.
Life jacket on.

1202
01:13:49,468 --> 01:13:52,297
Safety rule numero uno. Got it?

1203
01:13:54,255 --> 01:13:55,822
Alright.

1204
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:58,608
There is not much wind
in here right now.

1205
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:01,219
So, I hope you like the paddle.

1206
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:02,481
You need... you need help?

1207
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:05,832
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

1208
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:07,225
They just crossed...

1209
01:14:08,618 --> 01:14:10,532
No, like this one...
This one goes here.

1210
01:14:11,925 --> 01:14:14,580
One there. Two...

1211
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:17,452
Sweet. Alright. How much
strength you got in these arms?

1212
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:20,673
-Uh...
-It'll do. Alright.
You want to help me pushing it?

1213
01:14:20,717 --> 01:14:22,370
Alright, let's go.

1214
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:23,937
Okay then, we're straight.

1215
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:27,874
Alright. So, the front
is called the bow,
back is called the stern.

1216
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:30,943
Left side is port,
right side is starboard. Got it?

1217
01:14:30,987 --> 01:14:32,642
- I guess.
- Don't worry.

1218
01:14:32,684 --> 01:14:34,469
The more you sail,
easier it's going to get.

1219
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:37,559
-Hey, you know why
this is called the boom?
-No.

1220
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:40,998
-Why?
-So, when we cross wind,
if you don't duck,

1221
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,566
that's the sound is gonna make
when it hits you in the face.

1222
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,798
Hey, Scarlet, I want you
to invite another person

1223
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:43,253
to Charlotte's dinner party
tomorrow night.

1224
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:45,584
- Okay. Who?
- Grant.

1225
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,891
- Why?
- Well...

1226
01:15:47,934 --> 01:15:49,654
I think it'd be
really nice if she sees him.

1227
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:54,245
Hey, Dalton, where are you?

1228
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:58,858
Um, I'm helping my dad
rebuild the deck.

1229
01:15:58,902 --> 01:16:01,034
He's probably not
going to let me go right now.

1230
01:16:01,077 --> 01:16:02,645
Oh, that sucks.

1231
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,083
And I've just been
working a lot.

1232
01:16:06,126 --> 01:16:07,911
- We've got to get this done.
- Oh, yeah.

1233
01:16:07,954 --> 01:16:10,566
Okay, I understand.

1234
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:13,612
Scarlet and I were just
talking about Char's
dinner party tomorrow night.

1235
01:16:13,656 --> 01:16:15,222
You are coming, right?

1236
01:16:15,266 --> 01:16:17,398
I'll be there. I promise.

1237
01:16:17,442 --> 01:16:18,748
Okay. Bye.

1238
01:16:20,793 --> 01:16:23,535
Okay. So, Roxi
can't come tonight.

1239
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,624
But we have Finn here with us.

1240
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:28,627
- New cut and all.
- Please, hold your applause.

1241
01:16:28,671 --> 01:16:30,020
Dalton can't make it tonight.

1242
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:31,674
We already know
who killed Harley.

1243
01:16:31,717 --> 01:16:33,284
It was totally Carlos.

1244
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:34,957
Char even said that the cart
was all banged up

1245
01:16:34,981 --> 01:16:36,504
and had blood all over it.

1246
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:38,332
Case closed.

1247
01:16:38,376 --> 01:16:40,508
Maybe. But speaking of blood,

1248
01:16:40,552 --> 01:16:43,424
Roxi's cousin
was able to test
the blood from the sand trap.

1249
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:45,383
Turns out it was
a match to Harley.

1250
01:16:45,425 --> 01:16:48,473
- So we do know where he died.
- Then we're done.

1251
01:16:48,516 --> 01:16:51,084
We know who and we know where.
We got to call Chief Bud.

1252
01:16:51,128 --> 01:16:54,522
I don't know just yet.
Carlos seems like
a pretty smart guy.

1253
01:16:54,566 --> 01:16:57,656
If he were to kill Harley,
he wouldn't leave the cart
next to his camper.

1254
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,745
He would have dumped it.

1255
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:03,401
Yeah, but you know who did
get rid of his cart really fast?

1256
01:17:03,443 --> 01:17:06,273
-Larsen.
-That's right. We overheard him
say that he sold it.

1257
01:17:06,317 --> 01:17:09,799
He told his fiancée,
Jill that he's going to have
some big money coming in.

1258
01:17:09,842 --> 01:17:13,411
I knew it.
Larson killed his father
so he could take his money.

1259
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:17,241
That earring
could belong to Jill,
if they were working together.

1260
01:17:17,284 --> 01:17:20,070
I think we need
to do a little bit more
investigating on Larson

1261
01:17:20,112 --> 01:17:21,853
before we go call Chief Bud.

1262
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:23,594
I don't think
Jill's involved though.

1263
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,858
She plays a pretty
clueless bride-to-be.

1264
01:17:26,859 --> 01:17:29,209
Maybe the earring
isn't related at all.

1265
01:17:29,253 --> 01:17:32,952
The cart manager did tell Dalton
that one of the beer carts
was off for repairs.

1266
01:17:32,996 --> 01:17:35,346
He said it was weird because
they usually do it in-house.

1267
01:17:35,389 --> 01:17:37,565
What about Foster and Winona?

1268
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:39,698
Are we sure
that they are both clear?

1269
01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:43,702
Based on what Tanner said,
Foster and Winona
sound pretty innocent.

1270
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:45,941
You know, Roxi knows the
managers at the Chill Martini's.

1271
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:47,924
Some of her art
is displayed there.

1272
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:51,014
We can have her go and
find out what time they left.

1273
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:54,887
What about the Colonel?
He sounded pretty guilty.

1274
01:17:54,931 --> 01:17:58,848
Aubrey, you should tell Dalton
to track down the Colonel's cart
at the local repair shops.

1275
01:17:58,891 --> 01:18:01,241
-See if he can find out
what happened to it.
-Okay.

1276
01:18:01,285 --> 01:18:02,982
And it has to be
done by tomorrow

1277
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:06,029
because our three days
ends tomorrow night.

1278
01:18:06,072 --> 01:18:08,901
If any of you
find anything, text me.

1279
01:18:08,945 --> 01:18:11,034
Maybe we'll see some
of the suspects at the club.

1280
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:14,472
Yeah, it's true.
We could probably spy on them
at Char's dinner.

1281
01:18:14,514 --> 01:18:16,255
I don't know
why my mother insists

1282
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,563
on giving me a birthday party
at the Country Club.

1283
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:20,347
Not exactly my scene.

1284
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:22,045
Because the food is awesome,

1285
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:23,762
and you know she likes
a reason to get dressed up.

1286
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:26,484
Alright,
I want to play some COD.

1287
01:18:26,527 --> 01:18:27,615
- Yes.
- Yes.

1288
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:28,704
I'll go get snacks.

1289
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:35,666
I'm so happy we finally
get to spend some time together.

1290
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:36,755
Mm-hmm.

1291
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:43,240
Dalton. Do you think this is
going to turn out okay?

1292
01:18:43,282 --> 01:18:46,373
I hope so. It's your little
joyride is gonna cost us all.

1293
01:18:46,416 --> 01:18:48,985
Hey! I wasn't out there alone.

1294
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:50,769
-I thought we were
in this together.
-Yeah.

1295
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:53,032
Rapping to the point
where we both go to prison.

1296
01:18:53,076 --> 01:18:55,731
- Hey, love birds.
- What are you doing here?

1297
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:58,144
It's called chasing
you down for your half
of the Jet Ski money.

1298
01:18:58,168 --> 01:19:00,474
We've only got, like, two
hours till I lose my deposit.

1299
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:02,346
Yeah. Um...

1300
01:19:02,389 --> 01:19:05,175
So, this is where you're
always running off to.

1301
01:19:05,218 --> 01:19:07,830
Yeah. Come meet
my secret love, Chanel.

1302
01:19:11,224 --> 01:19:13,835
Be scared?
It's just a horse, man.

1303
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:15,184
Just a horse?

1304
01:19:15,228 --> 01:19:17,361
She's my baby and we're a team.

1305
01:19:17,404 --> 01:19:20,843
I trust her that she will
take care of me over the jumps.

1306
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:22,670
She's pretty cool.

1307
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:25,456
But I admit, I've never, um...

1308
01:19:25,499 --> 01:19:28,154
I've never been
around a horse before.

1309
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:30,809
Oh. So you do have
holes in your armor.

1310
01:19:30,853 --> 01:19:32,768
Don't be afraid.
She's the sweetest.

1311
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,645
It's okay. Here.
Just right there. Yeah.

1312
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:41,994
Oh, she's actually soft.

1313
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:44,954
Yeah. Here.
You can give her a treat.

1314
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:48,784
Here.

1315
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:51,395
So, just right there.

1316
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:54,920
- There you go.
- I just like that one.

1317
01:19:54,964 --> 01:19:57,096
Okay. I think that's
enough fun on the farm time.

1318
01:19:57,139 --> 01:19:59,882
-Let's go.
-That's right.
We got business to do.

1319
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:02,188
You keep dodging me,
I'm gonna be out $1,000.

1320
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:04,538
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

1321
01:20:04,582 --> 01:20:07,150
- See you tonight, babe.
- Oh!

1322
01:20:07,193 --> 01:20:08,193
Okay.

1323
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,722
- Almost forgot these.
- Oh, thank you.

1324
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,856
Thanks for showing me
your secret love.

1325
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:19,075
She's beautiful.

1326
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:40,139
Well. Hello, Aubrey.
Can I help you?

1327
01:20:40,183 --> 01:20:41,619
Hello, Mrs. Graham.

1328
01:20:41,662 --> 01:20:43,075
I've got groceries
for the food pantry.

1329
01:20:43,099 --> 01:20:44,883
Oh, great!

1330
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:47,668
We can set them on back there
by the other boxes.

1331
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:55,067
I'll make sure it gets
with the rest of the donations.

1332
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:03,815
We were going to bring
them on Sunday, but then...

1333
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,948
Well, that's okay.

1334
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:07,862
It's not too late.

1335
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:10,387
The food bank
hasn't even picked up yet.

1336
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:12,389
I've got more
in the front of my truck.

1337
01:21:12,432 --> 01:21:14,130
Great. I'll help you.

1338
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:18,656
So, how are you, dear?

1339
01:21:18,699 --> 01:21:21,005
I hear you had some trouble
with your golf cart.

1340
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:22,660
Oh. Yeah.

1341
01:21:28,273 --> 01:21:30,102
You know...

1342
01:21:30,146 --> 01:21:33,932
when I have things
on my heart weighing me down,

1343
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:36,239
I bring my words to God.

1344
01:21:36,282 --> 01:21:39,503
There's nothing your
Heavenly Father can't handle.

1345
01:21:39,546 --> 01:21:40,896
Just talk to Him.

1346
01:21:42,985 --> 01:21:48,338
How about if you take
a quiet moment and go inside

1347
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,121
and sit down in the sanctuary?

1348
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,255
If you can't find the words...

1349
01:21:53,299 --> 01:21:55,344
Well, that's okay.

1350
01:21:55,388 --> 01:21:57,564
You don't need to speak.

1351
01:21:57,608 --> 01:21:59,044
He hears your heart.

1352
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:03,135
Okay.

1353
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:05,267
Thank you.

1354
01:22:35,994 --> 01:22:37,300
Hey, did you see the text?

1355
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:40,999
We're close now. Yay!

1356
01:22:41,043 --> 01:22:43,784
Hey, are Dalton and you okay?

1357
01:22:43,827 --> 01:22:46,222
Actually, I'm not sure.

1358
01:22:46,264 --> 01:22:49,268
Sometimes he's great and
the next thing I know he's gone.

1359
01:22:49,312 --> 01:22:51,575
Yeah, I can see
why you feel that way.

1360
01:22:51,618 --> 01:22:54,230
I tried to be patient
and he's always focused
on trying to pay

1361
01:22:54,273 --> 01:22:56,580
for half of his college tuition
like his dad wants.

1362
01:22:56,623 --> 01:23:00,148
But honestly, I think he's
over me and hasn't told me yet.

1363
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:02,151
But are you
really that into him?

1364
01:23:02,193 --> 01:23:03,848
I'm starting to wonder.

1365
01:23:03,891 --> 01:23:06,023
But I am looking forward
to seeing him tonight.

1366
01:23:06,068 --> 01:23:08,157
Are you looking forward
to see anyone tonight?

1367
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,986
-No.
-Maybe you should
open your eyes more.

1368
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:13,989
You got some sweet friends
that would make some
good boyfriend material.

1369
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:18,036
- No, Aubrey.
- Okay, if you say so.

1370
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,777
Hey, will help me with my hair?

1371
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:20,820
Sure.

1372
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,874
Ah, Mom texted.
She's running a bit late.

1373
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:31,285
Dad's flight
was diverted to Raleigh.

1374
01:23:31,309 --> 01:23:32,964
She's going there
to pick him up.

1375
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:36,054
Okay. Uh,
shouldn't Dalton be here by now?

1376
01:23:36,098 --> 01:23:38,143
Yeah, he's coming, he promised.

1377
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:46,891
Oh. I guess
he's not coming after all.

1378
01:23:46,934 --> 01:23:47,934
Excuse me.

1379
01:23:48,849 --> 01:23:50,112
Aubrey, it will be okay.

1380
01:23:51,764 --> 01:23:55,204
- Hey, Brynn, I like your onesie.
- Brynn, don't run off.

1381
01:23:55,246 --> 01:23:56,814
Oh, excuse me!

1382
01:23:56,857 --> 01:23:59,034
- Hey, Betsy.
- Hey, sweetie.

1383
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:02,514
I could not get her
to put on her dress,
so I just finally gave up.

1384
01:24:02,559 --> 01:24:06,519
You know, with autism, you have
to pick your battles carefully,
because there's so many.

1385
01:24:06,563 --> 01:24:09,434
Right. Well, I like it.
She looks party ready.

1386
01:24:09,478 --> 01:24:12,090
I know I am. I need a drink.

1387
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:14,484
I'll be right back.
I need to find Brynn.

1388
01:24:17,878 --> 01:24:19,489
Why is Grant here?

1389
01:24:19,532 --> 01:24:20,968
Oh, Scarlet invited him.

1390
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:24,189
Roxi! I love your dress.

1391
01:24:24,233 --> 01:24:27,279
Thanks. Hey, Finn,
Charlotte pulled you out again.

1392
01:24:27,323 --> 01:24:30,108
Well, I've been
in high demand lately.

1393
01:24:30,152 --> 01:24:32,371
Lucky Finn,
isn't he the popular one?

1394
01:24:32,415 --> 01:24:34,895
Grant. You clean up nicely.

1395
01:24:34,939 --> 01:24:37,811
Thanks. I'm, uh, trying to get
noticed by someone special.

1396
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:42,728
Come on, Grant,
let's go grab drinks
for everyone while we wait.

1397
01:24:42,773 --> 01:24:44,383
Sure.

1398
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:46,646
Is, uh, is this a thing?

1399
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:49,300
No, this is not a thing.

1400
01:24:49,344 --> 01:24:50,563
Are you jealous?

1401
01:24:51,521 --> 01:24:53,653
Are you flirting with me?

1402
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:57,179
That's what it takes
to get your attention?

1403
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:58,397
Then yeah.

1404
01:25:02,445 --> 01:25:05,012
Oh. This is interesting.

1405
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:09,147
Uh, come on, Roxi, let's...
Let's go get those sodas.

1406
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:12,107
Oh, right. Yeah, I love
a good root beer.

1407
01:25:14,761 --> 01:25:16,894
Actually, I can't stay.

1408
01:25:16,937 --> 01:25:19,592
My uncle's visiting, so I have
to have dinner with my family.

1409
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:22,029
But I just want to say

1410
01:25:22,073 --> 01:25:24,554
happy birthday...
Charlotte Margaret Moon.

1411
01:25:27,644 --> 01:25:28,644
Hi, Grant!

1412
01:25:29,385 --> 01:25:30,864
Bye, Grant.

1413
01:25:30,907 --> 01:25:33,302
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, Charlotte.

1414
01:25:34,781 --> 01:25:37,523
Okay, Cal.

Wow. Cal, I...

1421
01:25:53,757 --> 01:25:55,802
I have no words. That...

1422
01:25:55,846 --> 01:25:57,369
Did Scarlet put you up to this?

1423
01:25:57,413 --> 01:26:00,023
Yes. Now can we go inside?
I'm starving.

1424
01:26:00,067 --> 01:26:01,721
Cal, behave.

1425
01:26:01,764 --> 01:26:03,157
Sorry, Cal.

1426
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:05,594
Tables are not ready yet.

1427
01:26:15,344 --> 01:26:16,432
Hey, what can I get you?

1428
01:26:16,475 --> 01:26:18,085
Uh, three cherry sodas,

1429
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:20,349
- and root beer, right?
- Yeah.

1430
01:26:20,392 --> 01:26:21,871
I really do like root beer.

1431
01:26:21,915 --> 01:26:22,960
Alright. You got it.

1432
01:26:30,837 --> 01:26:33,231
- Uh, hey.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

1433
01:26:33,275 --> 01:26:34,928
I've got a date.

1434
01:26:34,972 --> 01:26:36,800
Oh, another
country club princess

1435
01:26:36,843 --> 01:26:38,062
running up Daddy's tab?

1436
01:26:38,105 --> 01:26:39,411
Of course.

1437
01:26:39,455 --> 01:26:41,630
That's my favorite type.
Why are you here?

1438
01:26:41,674 --> 01:26:43,981
Uh, we're celebrating
Char's birthday.

1439
01:26:44,023 --> 01:26:46,201
Uh, where's Dalton?
Is he not your date?

1440
01:26:46,244 --> 01:26:50,727
Um, he bailed on me again.

1441
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:52,684
I'm pretty sure we're over.

1442
01:26:52,728 --> 01:26:54,928
You know, if that's true,
he should man up and tell you.

1443
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:58,014
Look, you're not
the only one getting dumped.

1444
01:26:58,038 --> 01:27:00,215
He completely left me hanging
on the Jet Ski deal.

1445
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:02,652
Oh, I'm sorry.
You lost your deposit?

1446
01:27:02,695 --> 01:27:04,044
Yeah. Well...

1447
01:27:06,046 --> 01:27:09,441
Aubrey, you look
really pretty tonight.

1448
01:27:09,485 --> 01:27:12,270
Oh. Thanks.

1449
01:27:12,314 --> 01:27:14,359
I'm sorry,
he made you come alone.

1450
01:27:15,447 --> 01:27:16,840
Whatever his reasons,

1451
01:27:16,883 --> 01:27:18,710
I hope it was
pretty damn important,

1452
01:27:18,755 --> 01:27:20,931
because he is a fool.

1453
01:27:21,844 --> 01:27:23,237
Excuse me.

1454
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:29,287
- One, two.
- There it is.

1455
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:32,072
There you go, three.

1456
01:27:32,116 --> 01:27:35,424
-Three cherries and I want to
check the back for root beer.
-Okay. Thank you.

1457
01:27:35,467 --> 01:27:37,295
- I'll see you out there.
- Okay.

1458
01:27:48,523 --> 01:27:50,003
Figured I'd find you here.

1459
01:27:52,615 --> 01:27:54,660
Mom, I did what you asked.

1460
01:27:54,704 --> 01:27:58,273
Really? You wouldn't
lie to me now, would you?

1461
01:27:58,316 --> 01:28:00,100
Your daddy used
to lie to me and I...

1462
01:28:00,144 --> 01:28:02,668
- I know you wouldn't lie to me.
- I'm not!

1463
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:04,931
You paid off
all your gambling debts,

1464
01:28:04,975 --> 01:28:06,889
all of it, like we agreed?

1465
01:28:06,933 --> 01:28:11,198
Yes. I sold my boat, Jet Skis
and the golf cart to do it.

1466
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:13,070
That's my good boy.

1467
01:28:13,112 --> 01:28:15,638
Now, would you
pay for my honeymoon?

1468
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:17,204
Of course, baby.

1469
01:28:17,248 --> 01:28:20,120
I'll always make sure
we're taken care of.

1470
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:22,384
Thanks, Mom.

1471
01:28:25,169 --> 01:28:26,170
Good boy.

1472
01:28:26,213 --> 01:28:28,041
And here's that root beer.

1473
01:28:30,043 --> 01:28:31,523
Thank you.

1474
01:28:46,059 --> 01:28:47,409
Hey, sugar.

1475
01:28:47,452 --> 01:28:48,758
Ms. Trudeau.

1476
01:28:49,628 --> 01:28:50,889
What can I do for you?

1477
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:53,415
I think you know.

1478
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:56,592
Alright, Winona, simmer down.

1479
01:28:56,635 --> 01:28:59,116
I'm gonna go home
and pack an overnight bag,

1480
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:02,206
and then I'm gonna
head on over to your house,

1481
01:29:02,249 --> 01:29:03,903
if that's alright with you.

1482
01:29:04,948 --> 01:29:06,210
Oh, yes, ma'am.

1483
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,082
Toodles.

1484
01:29:29,494 --> 01:29:30,494
Found her!

1485
01:29:31,844 --> 01:29:34,325
Oh. Oh, there's Gina.
I want to get a drink.

1486
01:29:35,978 --> 01:29:37,371
Brynn!

1487
01:29:37,415 --> 01:29:39,591
Oh, my goodness.
I am losing my mind.

1488
01:29:39,635 --> 01:29:42,178
-Don't worry. I'll get her.
-The host has said
our tables are ready.

1489
01:29:42,202 --> 01:29:43,202
Awesome.

1490
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:52,430
"Oh, thanks
for the drink, Finn."
"Oh, no problem, Charlotte."

1491
01:29:57,478 --> 01:29:58,478
Brynn?

1492
01:29:59,742 --> 01:30:00,742
Brynn?

1493
01:30:03,267 --> 01:30:04,660
Where did you get that?

1494
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:16,759
You. You're the unicorn witness?

1495
01:30:16,802 --> 01:30:20,415
Aubrey, Carlos
isn't the killer, Gina is.

1496
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:22,852
Yes. And I have proof.
Gina killed Harley.

1497
01:30:22,895 --> 01:30:24,505
I'm in the bathroom now, hurry.

1498
01:30:35,299 --> 01:30:37,693
Gina is the killer. Her and
Harley were having an affair.

1499
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:39,825
- What? Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1500
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:41,610
And I think
Brynn witnessed the murder.

1501
01:30:41,653 --> 01:30:44,047
She was on the golf course
the night Harley died.

1502
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:45,962
Gina's after her,
and we have to find her.

1503
01:30:46,005 --> 01:30:47,572
Come on,
let's try the parking lot.

1504
01:31:01,368 --> 01:31:02,761
We got to tell Chief Bud!

1505
01:31:23,129 --> 01:31:24,740
Get off me, asshole!

1506
01:31:24,782 --> 01:31:26,175
What's wrong with you?

1507
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:27,656
That's enough out of you.

1508
01:31:27,699 --> 01:31:29,396
- Let's get her up.
- I didn't do anything.

1509
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,225
Come on now, you get her cuffed,

1510
01:31:32,269 --> 01:31:34,619
and we'll sort this out.
Take her in.

1511
01:31:42,235 --> 01:31:44,455
Mom and Dad are on their way
back from the airport.

1512
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,022
Did you send your friends home?

1513
01:31:46,065 --> 01:31:48,198
Yeah. Their parents
are picking them up now.

1514
01:31:58,034 --> 01:32:00,384
Brynn. Oh, I was so worried.

1515
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:03,300
Alright, Charlotte.

1516
01:32:04,954 --> 01:32:09,393
We did find Miss Young pursuing
your cousin rather aggressively.

1517
01:32:09,436 --> 01:32:11,874
I had Sergeant Hart
take her back to the station.

1518
01:32:12,831 --> 01:32:17,749
Now. How about you telling me
what's got you so worried?

1519
01:32:17,793 --> 01:32:20,360
I know that Gina
killed Harley Trudeau.

1520
01:32:20,404 --> 01:32:21,623
And you know this how?

1521
01:32:23,014 --> 01:32:25,017
I've got pics of Harley
and her together.

1522
01:32:25,061 --> 01:32:26,584
I got them off of her phone.

1523
01:32:26,628 --> 01:32:28,308
I'm pretty sure
they were having an affair.

1524
01:32:29,718 --> 01:32:32,329
Okay. Anything else?

1525
01:32:32,371 --> 01:32:34,112
See those expensive earrings?

1526
01:32:34,157 --> 01:32:36,376
Pretty sure
Harley gave them to her.

1527
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:39,728
-Go on.
-She had them on
at the club cocktail party

1528
01:32:39,771 --> 01:32:41,599
the night that he was killed.

1529
01:32:41,643 --> 01:32:43,403
Brynn was outside
playing around the golf course,

1530
01:32:43,427 --> 01:32:44,559
and she found the earring

1531
01:32:44,602 --> 01:32:46,002
in a sand trap
near the crime scene.

1532
01:32:51,522 --> 01:32:53,611
And that's where I also found...

1533
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:55,960
its match.

1534
01:32:59,878 --> 01:33:01,401
You're gonna want
this sandbag too.

1535
01:33:03,228 --> 01:33:05,536
Harley's body
was hit by a small car,

1536
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,973
a cart in this case.
Look at this.

1537
01:33:08,017 --> 01:33:11,237
I took pics of the tracks
around the sand trap,
just after the murder.

1538
01:33:11,281 --> 01:33:14,632
Two cart tracks lead into
the trap, three tracks lead out.

1539
01:33:14,675 --> 01:33:17,287
And you'll find
Harley's blood soaked
into the sand, if you dig.

1540
01:33:20,638 --> 01:33:23,335
See the tracks here? And here?

1541
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:26,469
In this pic, Gina and Harley,
look at his tie.

1542
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:32,650
This is the tie Harley
was wearing the night he died.

1543
01:33:32,693 --> 01:33:34,696
You can see it
in the party pics.

1544
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:38,351
I'm sure that Brynn saw Gina
run over Harley with the cart.

1545
01:33:38,395 --> 01:33:40,025
That's why Brynn's been
running away from her.

1546
01:33:40,049 --> 01:33:42,617
And that's why
Gina chased after her.

1547
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:44,923
Harley's body
was found in the cove.

1548
01:33:44,967 --> 01:33:47,621
That's why there are three track
marks leading out of the trap,

1549
01:33:47,665 --> 01:33:50,059
and why he had
strangle marks on his neck.

1550
01:33:50,102 --> 01:33:52,670
Gina tied his necktie
to the cart hitch,

1551
01:33:52,714 --> 01:33:55,499
and dragged him to the pond.

1552
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:59,590
Oh, good Lord!
It's no wonder his head
didn't pop off like a grape.

1553
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:03,159
We've heard enough, Brynn and I
are gonna wait for you outside.

1554
01:34:03,202 --> 01:34:04,726
Come on, Brynn,
let's go outside.

1555
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:10,557
Charlotte, you were saying?

1556
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:14,648
So, after Gina
put his body into the lake,

1557
01:34:14,692 --> 01:34:16,781
she lost the tie
and lost the earrings.

1558
01:34:16,825 --> 01:34:19,001
And that's when
Brynn came and found them.

1559
01:34:19,044 --> 01:34:23,701
Your evidence does
suggest that she's guilty.
But what's her motive?

1560
01:34:23,745 --> 01:34:27,923
Easy. Everyone at the club
has seen how Gina chases
after the wealthy man.

1561
01:34:27,966 --> 01:34:30,925
She finally caught one,
or so she thought.

1562
01:34:30,969 --> 01:34:35,103
Harley must have betrayed her,
and she turned to a jilted
lover, green with envy.

1563
01:34:35,147 --> 01:34:37,584
She wanted to be
the new Mrs. Trudeau.

1564
01:34:37,628 --> 01:34:40,500
You form a convincing theory,
Charlotte.

1565
01:34:40,544 --> 01:34:44,374
So good in fact,
I'd say it matches nicely
with our own findings.

1566
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:47,464
Well, what about Carlos Harris?
Did he help Gina? I mean,

1567
01:34:47,507 --> 01:34:50,335
Charlotte saw his cart all
beat-up with blood all over it.

1568
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:54,166
Carlos reported that he hit
a deer with his cart a week ago.

1569
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,473
His story checks out.

1570
01:34:57,909 --> 01:35:01,521
So, I sent Sergeant Hart
to take a visit to the dump.

1571
01:35:03,175 --> 01:35:06,657
Beer cart number two was found
behind the trash heap.

1572
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:10,487
And it had the damage you would
expect from hitting Harley.

1573
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:13,359
- Well, what now?
- First off,

1574
01:35:13,403 --> 01:35:17,059
while I appreciate your sharp
and inquisitive minds,

1575
01:35:17,102 --> 01:35:20,540
and your courage and trying
to keep Aubrey from getting
in trouble...

1576
01:35:21,803 --> 01:35:23,805
you need
to let me handle this.

1577
01:35:25,327 --> 01:35:28,374
Second off, you and your friends

1578
01:35:28,418 --> 01:35:30,898
need to come down
to the station tomorrow

1579
01:35:30,942 --> 01:35:33,335
and give me a full statement.

1580
01:35:33,379 --> 01:35:34,859
Chief Bud, you there?

1581
01:35:37,906 --> 01:35:39,385
Yes, Dixie, I'm here.

1582
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,563
Tanner says Miss Young
is singing like a bird.

1583
01:35:43,607 --> 01:35:44,913
You better get back here.

1584
01:35:45,914 --> 01:35:47,437
Alright, Dixie, I'm coming.

1585
01:35:49,091 --> 01:35:53,008
Alright. So you two,
get home safe and sound,

1586
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:56,054
and please try
to stay out of trouble.

1587
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:58,753
You have a good night.

1588
01:36:40,882 --> 01:36:42,579
So now you know, my love...

1589
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:45,582
why I did what I had to do.

1590
01:36:47,062 --> 01:36:48,454
And why I couldn't tell you.

1591
01:36:53,633 --> 01:36:55,635
I will miss you terribly.

1592
01:36:56,898 --> 01:36:58,943
You made me feel alive again.

1593
01:36:59,987 --> 01:37:03,687
I've never felt
so beautiful and happy...

1594
01:37:04,906 --> 01:37:05,950
and for that...

1595
01:37:07,038 --> 01:37:08,605
I'll be forever grateful.

1596
01:37:23,489 --> 01:37:25,273
I couldn't have
had a better alibi.

1597
01:37:26,492 --> 01:37:27,537
A lover.

1598
01:37:33,804 --> 01:37:34,804
Winona.

1599
01:37:35,632 --> 01:37:36,675
Winona!

1600
01:38:49,793 --> 01:38:51,142
- Hey.
- Hey.

1601
01:39:31,878 --> 01:39:34,142
- Oh, guys!
- Going somewhere, Foster?

1602
01:39:34,184 --> 01:39:35,404
Hold on. Whoa.

1603
01:39:36,927 --> 01:39:39,321
- Stop.
- -Why don't you take a seat?

1604
01:39:42,063 --> 01:39:44,674
Looks like you've had
quite a night, Mr. Davis?

1605
01:39:46,241 --> 01:39:48,591
Where's Winona Trudeau?

1606
01:39:48,634 --> 01:39:49,940
I don't know!

1607
01:39:50,941 --> 01:39:52,898
Like, she left
about 20 minutes ago.

1608
01:39:52,943 --> 01:39:55,076
She's getting away.
She's the one you want.

1609
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,034
Better put an APB out on her.

1610
01:39:59,123 --> 01:40:02,474
You know, we've been talking to
Gina Young down at the station.

1611
01:40:02,518 --> 01:40:05,260
I swear, I had nothing
to do with Harley's death.

1612
01:40:05,303 --> 01:40:06,782
Winona fooled me too.

1613
01:40:06,826 --> 01:40:08,741
Is that right?

1614
01:40:08,785 --> 01:40:10,960
It looks like she left you
a nice little parting gift,

1615
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:12,353
all wrapped in ribbon.

1616
01:40:12,397 --> 01:40:14,878
Take it.
I want nothing to do with this.

1617
01:40:14,921 --> 01:40:16,227
Alright, Mr. Davis.

1618
01:40:18,099 --> 01:40:20,642
How about you give us
a short version of
what went on here tonight?

1619
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:22,451
Winona tricked me.

1620
01:40:22,494 --> 01:40:24,322
I thought
we were playing a game.

1621
01:40:24,366 --> 01:40:26,237
Next thing I know,
I'm tied to a chair

1622
01:40:26,281 --> 01:40:28,065
and she's pointing a gun at me.

1623
01:40:29,893 --> 01:40:32,068
What, you didn't see
that one coming?

1624
01:40:32,112 --> 01:40:33,114
Continue.

1625
01:40:34,289 --> 01:40:36,682
Winona has said that
about a month ago,

1626
01:40:36,726 --> 01:40:39,946
Harley told her
he was going divorce her
and marry his secretary.

1627
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:41,687
Winona signed a prenup.

1628
01:40:41,731 --> 01:40:44,342
And over the years, Larson
lost favor with his daddy.

1629
01:40:44,386 --> 01:40:46,692
So she was determined
to do whatever it took

1630
01:40:46,736 --> 01:40:48,433
to maintain their lifestyle.

1631
01:40:48,477 --> 01:40:50,478
How'd Gina Young get involved?

1632
01:40:50,522 --> 01:40:52,959
Winona said that her revenge
will be even sweeter

1633
01:40:53,003 --> 01:40:55,309
if she had one of Harley's
flings do the dirty work.

1634
01:40:55,353 --> 01:40:57,964
She said, she was killing
two birds with one stone.

1635
01:40:58,008 --> 01:40:59,531
So, she approached Gina.

1636
01:40:59,575 --> 01:41:01,577
And you had no part in this?

1637
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,231
No, I didn't!

1638
01:41:04,362 --> 01:41:07,757
Winona told Gina that Harley
has been cheating on her.

1639
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,344
And how he's planning
to run off with his latest
flavor of the month.

1640
01:41:10,368 --> 01:41:12,240
That was enough
to fuel the fire.

1641
01:41:12,282 --> 01:41:14,329
I mean, Gina went nuts!

1642
01:41:14,371 --> 01:41:16,418
Then all Winona had to do

1643
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:18,159
was offer to pay Gina
to kill him.

1644
01:41:18,202 --> 01:41:20,117
And that was enough
to seal his fate.

1645
01:41:20,161 --> 01:41:22,684
Did she tell you the plan?

1646
01:41:22,728 --> 01:41:26,384
Just said, Winona made sure
the drinks kept flowing
to Harley's direction

1647
01:41:26,428 --> 01:41:28,647
last Friday
at the club cocktail.

1648
01:41:28,691 --> 01:41:31,563
She knew he'd get drunk
and that they'd get fighting,

1649
01:41:31,607 --> 01:41:34,871
and then he'd go looking
for Gina after he dropped
her off at home.

1650
01:41:34,914 --> 01:41:37,568
And sure enough,
he found Gina leaving the club.

1651
01:41:38,788 --> 01:41:41,746
Then... Gina took him
for a ride on the beer cart.

1652
01:41:41,791 --> 01:41:44,663
She pushed him out of the cart,
and he's stumbling around,

1653
01:41:44,707 --> 01:41:48,189
so she chases him down into
the sand pit and runs him over.

1654
01:41:48,232 --> 01:41:51,931
According to Winona,
one groan and he's gone.

1655
01:41:51,975 --> 01:41:53,889
That sounds about right.

1656
01:41:53,933 --> 01:41:55,370
Don't you think so, Tanner?

1657
01:41:55,413 --> 01:41:57,763
I'd say so.

1658
01:41:57,807 --> 01:42:00,070
Same story Gina
told us at the station.

1659
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,334
You're a lucky man, Foster.

1660
01:42:03,378 --> 01:42:08,644
You got an alibi.
Gina claims Winona didn't
want you mixed up in all this.

1661
01:42:08,687 --> 01:42:10,514
Thank God.

1662
01:42:11,777 --> 01:42:13,910
That's all for tonight,
Mr. Davis.

1663
01:42:14,954 --> 01:42:17,653
But I'm gonna need you
to come down to the station
