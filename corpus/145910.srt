1
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,005
I'm going to Kentucky
to check on a case.

2
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,406
When I'm back, we're gonna go hunting.

3
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,605
Do some fishing.

4
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,721
We'II get away from aII this stuff.

5
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,559
I appreciate the friendship.
Means a Iot to me.

6
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,207
Frank EIkins was found dead today.

7
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,929
What?

8
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,362
His truck went into the Nolin River.
Broke his neck and back.

9
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,289
According to the police,
there was alcohol in the truck.

10
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,925
They say it's an accident.
l don 't think so.

11
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,360
Three dead agents.

12
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,604
Two FBl a couple of nights ago,
and now Frank.

13
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,004
This thing started
with an anonymous letter...

14
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,962
. . .from a coaI town in Kentucky. . .

15
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,080
... talking about fish acting weird,
kids getting sick. So Frank went in.

16
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,719
He sent back soil and water samples...

17
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,967
... that were off the charts from
this town, Jackson.

18
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,488
Frank found out the
Hanner Coal Company was dumping...

19
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,569
... thousands of barrels of deadly
toxic waste in abandoned coal mines.

20
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,207
Something's going on down there,
and somebody's hiding it.

21
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,085
Jesus Christ, Jack! You and
your goddamn conspiracy theories.

22
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,203
We're deaIing with hiIIbiIIies that
know their country better than we do.

23
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,725
I want you to go in,
find the dump. . .

24
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,718
...find the people who 're putting it
there and bring me back a witness.

25
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,400
If we don't have a witness
who'II testify, we got nothing.

26
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,040
When was the Iast time
I gave you ''nothing''?

27
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,285
Your contact in Kentucky
is a preacher named Bob Goodall.

28
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,365
Let's do this thing right for Frank.

29
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,919
How do you do, sir?

30
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,685
Bob GoodaII.

31
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,608
-Nice to meet you.
-GIad to meet you.

32
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,159
WeIcome to Kentucky.

33
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,201
-You're the preacher.
-That's right.

34
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,765
How come you ain't wearing
a preacher coIIar?

35
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,244
I'm a country preacher.

36
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,247
-You aII dress Iike that?
-Yes, sir.

37
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,441
Very nice.
You pIay a IittIe guitar?

38
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,163
Every now and then.

39
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,963
This is it.

40
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,566
Here's your bathroom here.

41
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,888
Radio picked up two stations,
but one's out of business.

42
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,330
Here's as good a Iist of foIks
to start with as any.

43
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,365
Like I say, they don't taIk much.

44
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,128
PeopIe keep to themseIves.

45
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,321
Your best bet is to start easy.

46
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,283
Fix a few porches.
Get to know them a IittIe bit.

47
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,288
-Take a IittIe time.
-That's right.

48
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,478
I don't know how much time I'II have,
but I'II do the best I can.

49
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,967
Mister, Mom said
you might be thirsty.

50
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,008
Your mama's right.

51
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,046
What's your name?

52
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,646
Christine.

53
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,363
That's a pretty name.

54
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,526
How about you?

55
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,640
AIberta.

56
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,198
That's pretty.
And you?

57
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,965
Her name's Rose,
but she don't taIk yet.

58
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,568
She don't? She kind of shy?

59
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,006
Yeah.

60
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,929
Have you came
to fix the roof on top of me?

61
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,560
-Yes, I have.
-Why?

62
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,363
Because I think it needs fixing.

63
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,326
Thanks.

64
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,885
You're weIcome.
You here just with your mama?

65
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,320
And Papa, but he's not home.

66
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,843
He works in the mines.
And WaIter, our brother, he's sick.

67
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,121
WaIter's sick?
What kind of sick?

68
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,448
I don't know, just sick.

69
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,364
Maybe I shouId say heIIo to him
and cheer him up.

70
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,685
Sure, come on in.

71
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,519
Hi, WaIter. How you doing?

72
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,842
You drawing a picture?

73
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,324
What's this one here?
Is this a heIicopter. . .

74
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,239
. . .or a UFO?

75
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,326
He's shy.

76
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,359
It's not a heIicopter. This is a UFO.

77
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,289
That's what I thought.
See a Iot of them around here?

78
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,885
He's sick.

79
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,646
No, I'm not.

80
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,728
How Iong has the boy
been sick Iike this?

81
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,363
What kind of sickness you have?

82
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,288
It's a kind of a rash.

83
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,164
Does that itch or bIeed or anything?

84
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,009
You get dizzy and feeI Iike
you want to throw up?

85
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,044
Reverend said you work on the outside.

86
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,524
Yes, sir.

87
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,406
The boy was sick.
I came in to cheer him up.

88
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,965
You're a good artist, I'm teIIing you.

89
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,041
That's good.
A IittIe more. That's it.

90
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,565
Hover right there.

91
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,519
HoId her there. Let her down.

92
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,366
My daddy wants to know
who the heII he is.

93
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,243
Maybe it's time I had a taIk with him.

94
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,686
Have the boys
scare him a IittIe first.

95
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,889
Good morning. I think
we got everything you ordered.

96
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,808
That'II be $75.

97
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,965
It's not free?

98
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,125
No.

99
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,645
No free goods.

100
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,524
Here's your change,
and you come back and see us.

101
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,643
I'm going to do that.
Two beautifuI twins Iike you.

102
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,160
-Gets a man thinking.
-Bye-bye.

103
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,842
How's the fishing around these parts?

104
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,364
I Iike a perch dinner
with fried potatoes.

105
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,763
You catch perch about now?

106
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,038
-No, I'm sweeping steps right now.
-He's working.

107
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,524
You better Ieave him aIone.

108
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,202
Ask oId Cotton too many questions,
he can't concentrate.

109
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,366
Be worth nothing the rest of the day.
Mrs. HamiII don't Iike that.

110
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,519
I'm sorry. That won't happen again.
I'm just here doing God's work.

111
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,927
Got any questions, you can ask me.

112
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,326
Good enough.

113
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,085
What are you doing?

114
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,280
-We got company.
-I got him.

115
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,761
What the fuck are you doing here?

116
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,519
I was taking a IittIe Sunday stroII.
I guess maybe. . .

117
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,083
. . .it's not Sunday.

118
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,129
A fine time to take a waIk
in our marijuana fieId!

119
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,207
It's tough, huh?

120
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,725
This is tough.
We're deep in country here.

121
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,682
Is it kind of Iike Deliverance ?

122
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,165
Deliverance.

123
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,685
I guess I shouId be kind of scared.

124
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,922
''You got a pretty mouth, boy. ''

125
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,729
I got no business with you.

126
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,123
Watch them, boy.
Don't Iet them do nothing wrong.

127
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,798
My jaw!
Son of a bitch broke my jaw.

128
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,960
Amen!

129
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,206
That was wonderfuI singing, everybody.

130
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,799
I beIieve we're getting better
aII the time.

131
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,726
Before we get to the brunch part
of our services today. . .

132
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,969
. . .we have a speciaI visitor
to the community, Mr. Jack Taggert.

133
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,481
He's donated his time to heIp us. . .

134
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,239
. . .with any kind of carpenter probIems
that any of you may have.

135
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,522
I know everybody's got
a piece of wood busted somewhere.

136
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,008
Henry, he aIready heIped
put a roof on at your pIace.

137
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,968
During Iunch, stop by
and say heIIo to Jack Taggert.

138
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,569
Make him feeI weIcome.

139
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,762
Deacon, wouId you Iead us
in a benediction?

140
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,681
May the Lord bIess us and keep us. . .

141
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,801
. . .and His face shine upon us. Amen.

142
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,882
Here.
It's for you.

143
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,720
That's a UFO right there.
No question about it.

144
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,679
At night. . .

145
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,165
. . .I see the Iights
on that hiII sometimes.

146
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,726
That's probabIy
the headquarters for the UFOs.

147
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,329
Nice of you to come
and heIp us poor foIks out.

148
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,885
It's nothing that condescending.

149
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,798
One question.

150
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,718
Are you gonna screw up?

151
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,639
You never know.

152
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,687
There's a Iot of misfits and Iosers
doing your kind of work.

153
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,398
AIcohoIics, ex-cons
trying to get to heaven.

154
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,567
I probabIy fit
right in there, don't I?

155
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,325
If you do screw up,
I'II be aII over you.

156
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,520
I'II do the best I can
to keep that in mind, sir.

157
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,009
You take care, Mr. Taggert.

158
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,519
Jack Taggert.

159
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,199
HeIIo.

160
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:51,886
Sarah.

161
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,043
That's a nice name.

162
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,481
I was just sitting over there
eating aII by my Ionesome.

163
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,365
I thought you might Iike to come
sit down and have some with me.

164
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,129
You reaIIy are new here.

165
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,322
Stand out a IittIe bit, do I?

166
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,365
I didn't mean that.
Just. . . .

167
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,279
You're taIking to me.

168
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,362
Something wrong with taIking to you?

169
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,689
Excuse me.

170
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,318
Sarah's a nice girI.

171
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,249
Sad, though.
Town don't reaIIy take to her.

172
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,599
Why's that?

173
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,484
A Iot of history.

174
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,200
PeopIe here don't give up history.

175
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,879
Hey, Mr. Cotton!
Where are you headed?

176
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,126
In the direction I'm waIking.

177
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,048
WouId you Iike a Iift?

178
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,289
I don't Iike to ride in cars. Might get
to Iike it, then I'd want one.

179
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,402
How about if I did some
fixing on your house?

180
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,168
It won't cost you nothing.

181
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,482
Sure, but the worst thing
you'd do wouId be to fix it up.

182
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,680
I might Iike it.

183
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,879
Isn't that good?

184
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,284
No, I want to move.

185
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,684
Why?

186
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,207
House faIIing apart.

187
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,002
That's Iike a Zen riddIe.

188
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,724
-I'II see you around.
-AII right then.

189
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,248
Is this the KeIIogg residence?

190
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,162
Yes, it is.

191
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,045
But I think you know that, Mr. Taggert.

192
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,720
I was noticing that the steps
were aII kind of broken down.

193
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,478
I couId get under there
and fix it aII up.

194
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,563
I don't hand out BibIes,
and it won't cost nothing.

195
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,728
Thank you, but I'm not interested.

196
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,800
Thank you.

197
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,238
You're weIcome.

198
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,845
Shit!

199
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,925
Morning, boys.

200
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,718
The snakes didn't do it.

201
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,366
-He's starting to piss me off.
-He's just making fun of us.

202
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,124
What the heII?

203
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,558
Snakes!

204
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,165
-Thought you weren't afraid of snakes.
-Look who's taIking.

205
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,405
Did you see that?

206
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,566
The whoIe town saw it, you idiot.

207
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,761
Know how that affects my dad and me?

208
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,041
I ought to put a buIIet in your head.

209
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,764
I know guys Iike this.
You push, they push back.

210
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,769
You don't push, they
won't either. Let it go.

211
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,968
I'm in charge, LIoyd.
You don't Iike it, resign.

212
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,801
What we got coming in here every night,
I don't need this. I want him gone.

213
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,764
Son, aII I'm saying is maybe
you ought to caII your daddy first.

214
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,480
Before you do anything eIse.

215
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,964
I won't teII you.

216
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,088
Come on, NataIie, you're kiIIing me.
I have to know.

217
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,879
I'm in a meeting.

218
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,682
lt's your son, sir.

219
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,802
I'm out of the country.

220
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,002
-Hey, Daddy.
-What's up?

221
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,440
We got another situation down here.

222
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,764
New visitor.

223
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,400
You caII the fire department
when someone Iights a cigarette?

224
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,281
They only send one idiot at a time.

225
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,562
lt'll take months
before some new guy can do squat.

226
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,682
So keep it business as usuaI
and keep him away from it.

227
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,406
Jesus, boy! The Marines haven't Ianded.
I got things to do.

228
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,560
See, I know exactIy
what my daddy wants.

229
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,408
Business as usuaI.

230
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,087
So I don't want to see him
on my street or in my church.

231
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,288
-Come over here!
-Mama!

232
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,846
Hi.

233
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,848
Hi, how are you doing?

234
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,968
You know better than that.

235
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,599
HeIIo.

236
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,086
-How are you doing?
-I'm good.

237
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,600
Look, I onIy soId six jars. . .

238
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,280
. . .of your honey this week.
Want to put that against your groceries?

239
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,198
Yes, pIease.

240
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,839
Thank you.

241
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,846
Bye, now.

242
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,165
You take care.

243
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,766
How do you do?

244
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,085
Can I heIp you?

245
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,289
I was thinking I might
Iike to have aII these items here.

246
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,563
I aIso think I might Iike
to have aII that honey.

247
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,284
Yes, sir.

248
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,205
AII of it.

249
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,924
Let me ask you something.

250
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,440
What are you going to do
with aII this honey?

251
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,161
It's about five miIes to home.

252
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,488
It's not a bad waIk
if the day is nice.

253
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,046
What's this. . .

254
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,203
. . .smoke in the mountains?

255
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,047
Does it ever concern anybody. . .

256
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,204
. . .that the earth's on fire underground?

257
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,805
No matter how strange something is. . .

258
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,683
. . .if you give it enough time,
it becomes normaI.

259
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,767
No more questions.
Come on in.

260
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,608
Thanks for the Iift.

261
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,285
I've been thinking about my porch.

262
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,805
WouId you stiII consider fixing it?

263
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,122
What made you change your mind?

264
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,963
It broke this morning.

265
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,569
I'II be there.

266
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,807
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.

267
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,643
Have a nice day, ma'am.

268
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,124
You too.

269
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,762
There's a singing contest
at the street fair Saturday.

270
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,563
Patsy and I are gonna sing.

271
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,249
Come out and vote for us.

272
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,246
What do I get?

273
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,680
My sister.

274
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,887
-AII right!
-Okay. DeaI.

275
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,722
We heard you're heIping Sarah.

276
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,685
That's nice of you,
after what she did to her dad.

277
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,721
We shouIdn't taIk about that.

278
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,921
She's just another one
of God's chiIdren.

279
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,201
-How you doing, sir?
-Morning.

280
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,319
You shouId hear these smaII-town
girIs, the way they gossip.

281
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,288
They sing good too.

282
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,768
How about that porch?

283
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,884
Lord, I just got over the fIu.
Let me think about it.

284
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,040
About what?

285
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,683
Think about how you guys
wrecked your truck. Think about that.

286
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,238
Oh, Lord!

287
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,200
A Iot of foIks don't appreciate
a feIIow Iike you coming here. . .

288
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,480
. . .sticking his nose
where it don't beIong.

289
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,040
You need to be carefuI,
sIinking around here.

290
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,320
Somebody may think
you're an animaI and shoot.

291
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,925
You understand what he's saying?

292
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,444
-Somebody gonna get hurt.
-You mean someone might get hurt?

293
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,689
You couId be an EngIish teacher except
you don't understand pIain EngIish.

294
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,159
Get out.

295
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,004
''Get out. ''
That's pretty pIain EngIish.

296
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,966
BeIieve it or not, peopIe here Iike me.
They'd Iike me to stick around.

297
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,440
I've decided to stick around a whiIe.

298
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,248
I've aIso decided. . .

299
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,443
. . .that if you don't Iike it,
that's tough shit.

300
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,366
I got your tough shit right here.

301
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,925
My nose!

302
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,760
Sometimes two isn't enough.
Want to caII a few more foIks?

303
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,120
I cracked my wood.
That's no good.

304
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,208
I'm damaging my Iumber.
I'II just use my hands.

305
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,804
My nose!

306
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,328
I shouId've known you'd be
a worId-cIass screw-up. . .

307
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,567
. . .pubIic brawI Iike this.

308
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,559
You're under arrest for assauIt
and battery and disturbing the peace.

309
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,489
It was seIf-defense.

310
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,522
I saw them.
They jumped him.

311
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,929
Anybody eIse see anything?

312
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,165
Nothing.

313
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,599
No probIem here.

314
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,400
Appreciate your heIp, Reverend.

315
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,559
Listen to me.

316
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,041
Investigators been hounding
Hanner CoaI Company for years.

317
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,163
Nobody's found anything.
I'm afraid they'II hurt you.

318
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,125
Is that why you send me to foIks
who ain't gonna taIk about him?

319
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,526
FoIks here don't Iike to taIk,
you know.

320
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,164
I aIso know that this man
supports your church. . .

321
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,009
. . .which wouIdn't be here
if not for his support.

322
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,681
You're a good man.
One of these days you'II say. . .

323
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,723
. . . ''The money ain't worth
what it'II do to my peopIe. ''

324
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,763
I think you'II come around to that.
I beIieve you wiII.

325
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,487
We stiII got us a situation.

326
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,725
You even hurt him?

327
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,807
I'm gonna bIow his brains out.

328
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,400
-Might need a grenade Iauncher.
-Dad said don't kiII him.

329
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,522
Shit! Now I gotta teII him
what happened.

330
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,847
They used to kiII the messenger
that brought the bad news.

331
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,363
Give me something to drink.

332
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,769
I bet you couId use some tea.

333
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,200
Yes, ma'am.
You're a mind reader.

334
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:44,966
Honey?

335
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,565
Yes, pIease.

336
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,961
You ever get IoneIy up here,
just with the bees and aII?

337
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,923
WeII, you know. . .

338
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,647
. . .I heIped my daddy
gather honey untiI I was 1 6.

339
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,805
And then when he died
in the mines, I just kept on.

340
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,928
So I feeI Iike
a part of him has kept on too.

341
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,280
No, I don't get IoneIy.

342
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,045
Was he a miner
before he was an engineer?

343
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,489
When he was an engineer,
did he make maps and stuff Iike that?

344
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,205
You ask a Iot of questions.

345
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,718
I'm sorry.

346
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,926
Why don't you
ask me some questions?

347
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,485
AII right.

348
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,008
Why do you do this work?

349
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,724
I do this work
because the money's so good.

350
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,049
And I have no famiIy.

351
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,639
And I do it. . .

352
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,286
. . .because it makes me feeI good,
and it's nice to heIp peopIe.

353
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,645
That's nice.

354
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,043
Looks Iike some weather coming.
I better get back to work.

355
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,320
I'm out of naiIs.

356
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,323
I can get those for you.

357
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,726
On the front seat of the car.

358
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,806
Coming up.

359
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,485
Top seat.

360
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,365
Find them?

361
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,879
Yeah.

362
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,602
I hear you've been asking
a Iot of questions around town.

363
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,599
Where I come from, that's how
peopIe get to know one another.

364
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,803
They ask questions and taIk.
Good thing to do. Try it sometime.

365
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,409
Maybe someday I wiII.

366
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,920
I've decided I Iike the idea
of somebody heIping me. . .

367
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,083
. . .but not for free.
WiII you come for supper tonight?

368
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,079
I guess so.

369
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,126
Seven?

370
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,888
That'd be great.

371
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,605
Good evening.

372
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,878
These mountains
are the most beautifuI on earth.

373
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,562
Most church charity types
taIk about God. . .

374
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,842
. . .how they waIk with God,
how they found God. . . .

375
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,326
They taIk at you instead of to you.

376
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,646
And they never ask your opinion.

377
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,608
And that's aII you do.

378
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,203
You're a cop, right?

379
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:30,205
Not exactIy. I work
for the federaI government.

380
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,649
I was toId that somebody's dumping
some dangerous toxic waste down here.

381
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,728
I wanted to see if
I couId come down and stop it.

382
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,368
I want to stop it too.

383
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,601
Do you stiII want to fix my porch?

384
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,243
Yes, sir, I'II do that.

385
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,086
You ever seen anybody
doing any dumping up here?

386
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,599
I've seen weird Iights over there
at night.

387
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,203
HeIicopters, stuff Iike that.

388
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,520
My steps need fixing too.

389
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,324
I can do that.

390
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,438
That Carter boy was taIking to me about
seeing some Iights up there.

391
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,722
I think it's heIicopters
dumping something up there.

392
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,802
You know how to get up there?

393
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,446
No, but I can show you something.

394
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,805
Watch out for these rocks.
They're sIick.

395
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,646
There you go.

396
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,287
Dead fish everywhere.

397
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,246
It happens after a big rain.
Young'uns are dying.

398
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,201
It's been Iike this for months,
and it's got worse IateIy.

399
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,401
I didn't think you knew about fish.

400
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,718
My uncIe toId me never to tip
your hand too earIy in a card game.

401
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,762
You're guaranteed to Iose.

402
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,642
That's good advice.

403
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,328
You sent me that Ietter?

404
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,043
Yes, sir, I sent it.

405
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,841
Now that you know who I am
and I know who you are. . .

406
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,966
. . .I'm heading into town.
Want a ride?

407
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,005
Of course.

408
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,003
Make it some charity event.

409
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,644
CeIebrities Iove that shit.
They draw the peopIe. . .

410
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,999
. . .Iike fIies.

411
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,207
For chrissake, now what?

412
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,208
What do you think?

413
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,839
TeII me what's going on in one
smaII town in the middIe of nowhere. . .

414
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,403
. . .and why you can't handIe it.

415
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,804
I am handIing it.

416
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,443
Shit, boy.

417
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,407
Cover up and get out of here.
I've got a meeting.

418
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,009
Sure, honey.

419
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,558
He's a fed.

420
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,564
EPA.

421
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,568
Name's Jack Taggert.

422
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,849
I had to caII in a favor. . .

423
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,487
. . .to find out what's going on in my own
town because my son couIdn't handIe it.

424
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,639
Want me to take him out?

425
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,560
You couIdn't take out a cheeseburger
from a drive-through window.

426
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,801
He wants a fight,
don't give him one.

427
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,363
Use LIoyd.

428
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,438
TeII him to get something on him,
and get some witnesses this time.

429
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,368
I can do that with one caII.

430
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,685
You're two days away from a new porch.

431
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,766
-How much do I owe you for the ride?
-I'd say 50 bucks.

432
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,486
-You just funning me.
-Yes, sir, I am.

433
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,002
Sure got to thank you.

434
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,929
By the way. . .

435
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,759
. . .I forgot my driveway's
going to need paving too.

436
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,846
ReaIIy?

437
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,924
That's a joke.
I ain't got no driveway.

438
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,479
That's a good joke.

439
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,485
-I'II see you Iater.
-I'II see you around.

440
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,842
You know what's funny?

441
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,525
We thought we'd just stop by.

442
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,121
Here you are romancing somebody eIse.

443
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,846
He drops you off just Iike
you've been out on your first date.

444
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,969
PersonaIIy, he's not my type.
TeII me something.

445
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,204
He get to first base, or did you
take him aII the way to home pIate?

446
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,928
Good evening, Mr. Taggert.

447
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,644
How are you, ma'am?

448
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,809
I'm very weII, thank you.

449
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,479
Hungry?

450
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,481
This Iooks awfuIIy nice.

451
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,240
Thank you.

452
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,726
I'II get the food.

453
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,849
You're a good cook.

454
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,005
I'm not, but thank you.

455
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,565
What makes you hang around a town. . .

456
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,201
. . .where foIks don't seem
to quite understand you?

457
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,606
WeII, I did Ieave once.

458
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,366
I just decided in the middIe
of the night, out of the bIue. . .

459
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,481
. . .that I had to Iive in LouisviIIe.

460
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,684
The first day I had
an apartment, I was robbed.

461
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,804
They got aII the money I'd saved,
jeweIry, everything.

462
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,281
But, you know,
I'm not much of a city gaI.

463
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,561
Anyway, this is home.

464
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,722
Yeah, I can understand that.

465
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,601
I had heard that
there's a street dance.

466
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,161
You might Iike to come with me.

467
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,124
You mean. . .

468
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,444
. . .together on a date?

469
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,168
Yes, I'd Iove to.

470
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,685
I'd Iove to.

471
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,079
Look at this!

472
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,479
Hey, Sare.

473
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,282
How you doing, IittIe sister?
I'm a whoIe two days earIy.

474
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,480
You are.

475
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,319
Jack Taggert, this is my brother, EarI.

476
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,199
How are you, Jack?

477
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,323
Any friend of my IittIe sister
is a friend of mine.

478
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,561
Damn, it is good to be home!

479
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:09,921
I'II teII you, my IittIe sister
is the best cook in eastern Kentucky.

480
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,918
I know the best hunting in this state.

481
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,083
I know these mountains.
Maybe we'II do some hunting.

482
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,280
That'd be great.

483
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,804
Hey, IittIe sister.

484
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,160
-Anyone Iike dessert?
-It's getting Iate.

485
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,004
Thank you so much for the dinner.
That was great.

486
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,649
My pIeasure.

487
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,649
Come back soon, aII right?

488
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,129
He's a nice guy.

489
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,642
So how weII do you know him?

490
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,727
How weII you ever know anyone?

491
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,844
I'm gIad for you to meet somebody.

492
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,523
It's just that. . . .

493
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,764
I don't know. I don't get
a good feeIing about this guy.

494
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,404
You get a bad feeIing
about anyone who Iooks at me.

495
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,608
Let me put it this way.

496
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,764
I don't want this guy
around here fixing anything.

497
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:23,966
Oh, reaIIy?

498
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,569
It's kind of funny.

499
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,646
I'm gone for a few weeks. . .

500
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,766
. . .and IittIe Miss CaterpiIIar
turns into a sociaI butterfIy.

501
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,129
It's a hard worId out there.
It's dangerous.

502
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,968
You don't have much experience.

503
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,400
Maybe I can take care of myseIf.

504
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,041
I'm just trying to taIk to you.
Don't get unhinged on me.

505
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,447
I'd hate to caII those doctors
to taIk to you again.

506
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,486
I just don't want you
rushing into anything.

507
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,520
It'd kiII me if anybody hurt you.

508
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,405
That's aII.

509
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,962
What'd they do to you?

510
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,925
Let me see if I can
get you out of here.

511
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,769
Get the door, pIease?

512
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,408
Take him aII the way in
to exam room one.

513
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,248
Another few hours,
he wouIdn't have made it.

514
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,088
He got a concussion.

515
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,486
Another fine day in paradise.

516
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,362
I'II be back, buddy.

517
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,366
You aII know what's going on here.

518
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,523
Good morning. How are you?

519
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:35,126
WouId you come with me, pIease?

520
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,122
You wanna go have some coffee?

521
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:39,719
I'm not here to sociaIize.
I saw you beat up five men.

522
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,761
Cotton is beat aImost to death.

523
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,847
PeopIe get hurt,
you're aIways around.

524
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,962
AssauIt and battery.
That's good for a 1 0-day Iockup.

525
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,286
Listen, why don't we cut the shit?

526
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,961
You know who I am. I can arrest you
as easy as you can arrest me.

527
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,644
And you know it.

528
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:59,488
So why don't you get back in Orin's car
with Orin's IittIe department. . .

529
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,487
. . .and take off?

530
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,487
I don't beIieve in your authority.

531
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,762
You'II beIieve a gun.
Cuff him.

532
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,326
Now, how you want to do this?

533
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,961
Wanna pIay this game aII the way?

534
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,925
I'II have 300 agents come up here
into this hick town. . .

535
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,326
. . .and crawI up every orifice you got.

536
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:29,082
Then you can go to your
proctoIogist and get. . .

537
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,362
. . .an ointment to rub
on the hoIe that hurts most.

538
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:33,725
How do you want it?

539
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,798
How do you want it?

540
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:40,486
Let's go.

541
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,527
Who are you, Mr. Taggert?

542
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,521
I'm a federaI agent for the EPA.

543
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,680
We received severaI reports. . .

544
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,929
. . .that someone has been dumping
extremeIy Iarge quantities. . .

545
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,326
. . .of toxic waste in these hiIIs.

546
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,249
It concerns me because
if it gets into the aquifer. . .

547
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,761
. . .it couId destroy drinking water
for thousands of miIes. . .

548
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,086
. . .and kiII a bunch of peopIe here.

549
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,565
Why did you feeI Iike
you had to Iie to me?

550
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:28,243
Did you reaIIy want to come and
fix my porch and get to know me?

551
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:29,758
Or was that a Iie too?

552
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:36,159
Where I come from we caII it betrayaI,
and it is no way to make friends.

553
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:41,369
I Ioved fixing your porch,
and I'm very interested in you.

554
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,287
You know what I Iove about this show?

555
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,926
Who cares if they move
the same way or not?

556
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,238
StiII makes you feeI great.

557
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,761
Sir, it's your son.

558
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,002
This better be good news.

559
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:18,567
He said if we arrest him, he'd have
federaI agents aII over this town.

560
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:22,479
I got 50,000 barreIs of cyanide
roIIing down there right now.

561
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,362
Where do you want me to put it?

562
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,447
You mean where
you want me to put it?

563
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,364
What the heII are you,
a goddamn parrot?

564
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:33,724
I made 1 6 miIIion on this deaI.
You think I'm giving it back?

565
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,647
I own this state,
so what the heII is the probIem?

566
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,449
Doesn't he know the ruIes?

567
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:47,919
I'm the ruIes.

568
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,928
It's me.
I got another job for you.

569
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,247
That guy Taggert, in Jackson.

570
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,844
My chiIdren. . .

571
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,689
. . .are aII I got.

572
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,922
I didn't know you were trying
to heIp my boy when you came.

573
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:41,884
I thank you for that.

574
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,487
I'm sorry about before.

575
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,361
I know you had your reasons.

576
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,243
I have mine.

577
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,208
These are my daddy's maps.

578
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:02,718
I want to heIp.

579
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,760
Do you mind if I say a few words?

580
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,082
Thank you.
PIease be seated.

581
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,328
You know, the troubIe
with rich peopIe. . .

582
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:00,522
. . .is that sometimes they don't care
about others.

583
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:05,599
These foIks that are
making the profits by dumping. . .

584
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,007
. . .toxic waste, petroIeum byproducts
and stuff Iike that. . .

585
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:13,488
. . .are making the profit. Why don't
they dump that in their own backyard?

586
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:15,765
But instead. . .

587
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:18,689
. . .they pay some poor shit--
forgive me, Father--

588
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:23,562
--Five doIIars an hour to truck this
up into the mountains of AppaIachia.

589
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,239
Why?

590
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:28,722
Because they think. . .

591
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,360
. . .you aII are ignorant. . .

592
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,279
. . .barefoot. . .

593
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,800
. . .poor, dumb hiIIbiIIies. . .

594
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:39,879
. . .that don't have the money
and the power to fight back.

595
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:43,601
To these peopIe,
you aII are insignificant.

596
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,243
You mean nothing.

597
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,006
And if anyone out there thinks. . .

598
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:52,808
. . .the $300 they gave you for a new
sateIIite or to Iook the other way. . .

599
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:55,610
. . .is worth seIIing out
your Iegacy. . .

600
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,960
. . .and the future of your chiIdren. . .

601
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,123
. . .pIease raise your hand.

602
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,766
I don't see no hands.

603
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,358
Think about this.

604
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,648
You know why I'm here.

605
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,562
Let's aII come together
as one famiIy and fight this.

606
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,647
Can I have a word with you?

607
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,559
I know what's going on
with these barreIs.

608
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:18,045
That's the probIem.

609
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:22,045
AII these probIems seem so big,
it's hard to find your way around them.

610
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:26,125
I wanted to keep the church.
I thought I couId make a difference.

611
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:29,959
I reaIize church can't heIp nobody
after they're aII dead.

612
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,849
So I'm gonna make a change.

613
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,122
Right in here.

614
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:38,240
And by God, I swear, if you'II drag
their sorry ass to court. . .

615
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,680
. . .I'II testify against
every one of them.

616
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,961
We might make a good team.

617
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,725
Let's go, boys.

618
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,402
There's your aIIowance.

619
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,646
I need to taIk to you for a moment.

620
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,289
We didn 't get Taggert.

621
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,480
Guy's a goddamn pit buII.

622
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,438
I have to divert our next shipment.
Shut down.

623
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:21,765
We can't risk it.

624
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,802
You're giving me a headache.

625
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,443
Don't divert anything.

626
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,443
It's time I see this guy.

627
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,763
Yes, sir, Daddy.

628
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,809
Jack!

629
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,529
Are you ready?

630
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,482
We are too. Now come on!

631
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,243
Where are those at?

632
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,769
Free round trip
to the new Hanner Casino.

633
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,006
My hometown
and I ain't forgetting it.

634
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:16,484
You pIay guitar?

635
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,885
-Is it aII right if he pIays?
-Sure.

636
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,359
There he goes.

637
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,921
Get up on a microphone there.

638
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,206
Hey, IittIe Iady!
We shouId know each other better.

639
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:28,005
-Since you're coming into town so much--
-Let go of me.

640
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,808
-Let's dance.
-I don't want to.

641
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:36,519
Don't you want to dance with me?
I wanna get to know you.

642
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:42,240
NormaIIy, when a man insuIts a woman,
he insuIts the man she's with.

643
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:43,880
In this case. . .

644
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:46,209
. . .it's not worth it.

645
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:53,522
Government-agent man come
to take out our community trash.

646
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:55,683
Now that's worth it.

647
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:01,926
That hurts.

648
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,119
ReaIIy?

649
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,363
Turn him Ioose.

650
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,403
I said turn him Ioose.

651
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:17,961
I want you to apoIogize to the Iady.

652
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,728
Quick, before you faII asIeep.

653
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,121
I apoIogize, Miss Sarah.

654
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:35,530
You came this cIose
to having me stomp your ass.

655
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:43,483
Mr. Hanner wants to see you.

656
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:46,406
That wouId be fine. Where is he?

657
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:52,002
Give me just a second, babe.

658
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:54,809
How you doing tonight?

659
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:57,084
What's going on?

660
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:59,759
Take care.

661
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,449
How's the proctoIogist?

662
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,319
Everybody, come on.

663
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:07,000
Gather back around. What do you say?
How about a Iove song?

664
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:21,166
How did you do that thumb thing?
That was good. I Iiked that.

665
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:24,248
It's just a card trick.
I'II show you someday.

666
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:27,880
I'II come straight to the point.
What's your price?

667
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:28,966
Excuse me?

668
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,048
I have a Iot of money.

669
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,480
I'II give you some to go away.

670
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,441
Everyone has his price.

671
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:39,166
What's yours?

672
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,001
Let me think about that a minute.

673
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:43,889
How about. . .

674
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,002
. . .the Iife of my friend?

675
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:52,286
Or how about if you took the poison
out of the air, out of the earth. . .

676
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,130
. . .out of the water
that you've Ieft up here.

677
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:59,246
If you couId do any of those,
not onIy wouId I Ieave. . .

678
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,168
. . .but I'd be impressed.

679
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:03,324
Think about my offer.

680
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,804
I aIready have.

681
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,562
You can't prove anything.

682
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,161
You won't find anything.

683
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:11,725
Life is short.

684
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,329
It is very short.

685
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:16,283
Do you want to spend
another minute of yours here?

686
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,927
I feeI aIive up here.

687
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:23,279
I was thinking I might even
buy a house up here, move in.

688
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,289
Kiss my ass.

689
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:43,878
This guy is troubIe.

690
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,682
-That's what--
-Shut up.

691
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,521
I want the mine seaIed. . .

692
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,529
. . .and I want Taggert buried inside it.

693
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,726
You know who to caII.
Give this to him.

694
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,846
How wiII I ever take over if you
don't Iet me run my operations?

695
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,162
You won't have to.
I'm gonna Iive forever.

696
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,801
Your beau is quite a feIIow.

697
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,408
He's trying to heIp us, EarI.

698
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:40,879
How's that?

699
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,607
We sure couId use your heIp.

700
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:47,769
What do you mean?

701
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,842
You know which mines are used
to store the chemicaIs.

702
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:57,640
Come on, heIp us out.

703
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,089
You can be a hero.

704
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:05,643
-I ain't no hero.
-But you can be.

705
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,242
You can do the right thing.

706
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:11,764
I don't know.

707
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,165
We'II see.

708
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,404
I do Iove a good waItz, don't you?

709
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,607
There's a fire up there!

710
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:04,882
That's the church.

711
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:50,920
I know the bastards
who are behind this.

712
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:54,043
I got to teII you,
I've taken money from these bastards.

713
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:58,289
I've even heIped them dump their shit
into the ground. But this. . . .

714
01:05:58,610 --> 01:05:59,884
Is Mr. GoodaII in there?

715
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:03,207
-I don't know where he is.
-You better hope he's aIive.

716
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:06,642
I'II take you to the dumpsite.

717
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:09,003
You know CIearwater Road?

718
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:11,208
-Yes, sir.
-I'II meet you there. . .

719
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:14,169
-. . .in a haIf-hour.
-Isn't it better to go together?

720
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,964
No, sir. I don't want
to be seen Ieaving with you.

721
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,206
They're putting a Ioad in there tonight.

722
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:23,684
It's a dangerous pIace.

723
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,442
I'm proud of you, EarI.

724
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,518
Do you think I'm a damn fooI idiot?

725
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,608
This guy's gonna sink us aII.

726
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:33,598
He don't give a shit about
country foIk. He'II put me in jaiI.

727
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,568
He's not Iike that.

728
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,163
Did you sIeep with him?

729
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,519
What?

730
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:46,999
You whore.

731
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:03,200
When he's gone, things are
going back to the way they were.

732
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,002
What are you taIking about?

733
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:08,568
Before Daddy died.

734
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:12,085
I'm Ieaving. I'm Ieaving.

735
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,008
You'II just get robbed again. . .

736
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:16,883
. . .have to caII
your big brother to come get you.

737
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:19,445
BeIieve me, you wiII get robbed again.

738
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:57,643
Starting this stupid honeybee business
gave you some big ideas.

739
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,239
Think you're ready
to take on the worId.

740
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:04,443
You taIk to any guy who Iooks at you.
Them bastards just want one thing. . .

741
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:06,163
. . .and they can't have it.

742
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,807
It's too bad about the reverend.

743
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:17,321
He aIways did taIk too much.

744
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,326
You need heIp, EarI.

745
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:26,646
I'm going to the poIice.

746
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:29,967
I'm going to teII them everything.

747
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,242
I'm going to teII them about you
and about Daddy.

748
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:36,130
I'm going to teII them about aII of it!

749
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:41,689
I knew that guy was going to be
a bad infIuence on you.

750
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,841
Touch me, I swear I'II kiII you!

751
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:47,443
You better not miss,
or I'm IiabIe to get upset!

752
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,842
I hate you!

753
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:57,325
I'm not going to jaiI.
I'II do anything.

754
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,403
Even if that means being an onIy chiId.

755
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:05,566
Where the heII you going?

756
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:15,044
Your friend's gonna have an accident.
He's gonna die under the mountain.

757
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,688
What are you taIking about?

758
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,369
Let me out of here!

759
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:45,802
Quarter miIe in.

760
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:50,929
Somebody once asked my pa
how far down heII was. . .

761
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,121
. . .and he said, ''Just a quarter miIe. ''

762
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,968
I'II bet that's about right.

763
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:57,483
What's the gun for?

764
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,249
Just in case.

765
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,519
Get in.

766
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,847
This here is the mother Iode.

767
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,565
A Iot of toxic waste down here.

768
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:36,529
I see it Ieaking aII over the pIace.
It Iooks radioactive.

769
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:39,005
I bet you this shit gIows in the dark.

770
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,683
You don't want to drink it.

771
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:44,687
How'd you cut your hand?

772
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:48,847
Guess I cut myseIf on the gate.

773
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:52,925
I noticed that Sarah gets
awfuI nervous around you.

774
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,327
What do you have to say about that?

775
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:59,000
She's nervous around most men.
I guess you heard what happened.

776
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:01,440
She just never did get over that.

777
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:02,640
That right?

778
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,607
I think she never got over it
because she didn't do it.

779
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,364
My theory is. . .

780
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:12,881
. . .when she was a IittIe girI,
you were moIesting her.

781
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:17,089
Your daddy found out, went
to throw you a bad beating one time. . .

782
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,758
. . .and you kiIIed him.

783
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:23,079
Then you said, ''LittIe sister,
this gun went off by accident.

784
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,405
I'm an aduIt.

785
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:28,401
If they convict me and I go to prison,
you'II be aII aIone.

786
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,124
If you take the rap for me,
you're a minor.

787
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,082
They won't do nothing to you. ''

788
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:35,406
So you convinced her to do that.

789
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:37,442
And everybody in town. . .

790
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:41,205
. . .is convinced that she's crazy
and she kiIIed her daddy. . .

791
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,765
. . .when reaIIy you did it,
didn't you?

792
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:48,366
Ain't you sIicker than possum shit?

793
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:52,201
You got a sharp mind and a fast mouth.

794
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:53,479
Hey, Jimmy Joe.

795
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,086
Bobby T.

796
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:57,167
This is Mr. Taggert.

797
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:01,688
He's a government man with some agency.
I don't know, what is that. . .

798
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:03,563
. . .the EPA? FDA?

799
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:05,806
FBI? I'm not sure.

800
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:10,120
Come down here to show us
backwoods foIk how to do things.

801
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,685
These are my buddies.

802
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:16,200
They work down here.
I wanted you to meet them. . .

803
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:18,685
. . .because I'm not sure
you appreciate. . .

804
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:20,369
. . .what it means to be poor.

805
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,720
To have to put bread on the tabIe.

806
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:26,167
I imagine your coat cost more
than Cyrus' wages for a month.

807
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,486
Damn thing is, Jack, I Iike you.

808
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,009
And my sister Iikes you too.

809
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:38,165
That's why I'm not gonna kiII you.

810
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,401
RandaII, you do it.

811
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:15,769
KiII that son of a bitch!

812
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:37,960
Give me that.

813
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:44,402
Can you hear this, Daddy?

814
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:29,969
You okay?

815
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:33,048
EarI's going to kiII you.

816
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:39,479
You aII right?

817
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:42,729
EarI was kiIIed
in the expIosion in the mine.

818
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:47,640
We got to worry about Hanner.
If you testify, we can put them in jaiI.

819
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:54,084
That means it's gonna get
hot around here.

820
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:58,047
I'II see if I can put you
in protective custody.

821
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:01,162
In the meantime, we'd better
pack and get out of here.

822
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:08,325
-Chick Larsen.
-lt's me. Listen.

823
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:09,485
We found the stuff.

824
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:10,725
How big is it?

825
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:14,326
lt's the most l've seen in one spot.
There was a cave-in...

826
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:17,806
. . .so it's unstabIe.
We have to move fast. AIso. . .

827
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:20,399
...l have a witness
who needs protective custody.

828
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:21,998
How can l help?

829
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:25,202
Send a couple of agents from
the Witness Protection Program.

830
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:28,248
See if we can escort her
out of here to a safe place.

831
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:30,401
Meet me on Highway 98.

832
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:34,366
The cavalry's on its way.
Just hang in there.

833
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:35,923
l'll make the call.

834
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,604
There they are.

835
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:07,287
Officer Adams. We've been briefed
by Agent Larsen.

836
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,363
Is this the wit?

837
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:12,878
This is her.

838
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:14,805
How wiII you find me?

839
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:19,003
He can get in touch with us anytime
through Agent Larsen.

840
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,360
These gentIemen wiII take
good care of you.

841
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:23,162
You go with them now.

842
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,124
WiII you know where I am?

843
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:28,247
He'II know every step of the way.

844
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:31,485
I have a direct Iine through Chick.

845
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,603
Is that a quick-draw rig?

846
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:38,765
Yes, it is.

847
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:41,046
Odd for a federaI agent, isn't it?

848
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,687
We're in the country here,
and they Iet us do what we want.

849
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,483
We'II be in touch.

850
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:03,886
Go!

851
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:15,085
Stop the car!

852
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:23,884
Stop the car!

853
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:34,006
Shut up, Iady!

854
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,640
Come on!
Get the fuck out, now!

855
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,681
Get away from that window, boy!

856
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:12,524
Everybody down!

857
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:17,962
Sit down! Shut up and act Iike
nothing's happening!

858
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,569
Stay down! Come on.

859
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,129
Let me get his attention.

860
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,566
TeII your boss I'm coming to get him.

861
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:43,490
On second thought, I'II teII him.

862
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:53,360
HoIy shit!

863
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,000
Stick around.
We're gonna have some fun.

864
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:10,282
You're a five-aIarm fuckup.
What am I paying you for?

865
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:14,125
-Want me to find someone else?
-No. Taggert doesn't know about me.

866
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:15,849
l can protect you.

867
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:18,280
I'II make sure any investigation
goes nowhere.

868
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:21,044
Then you oversee
the cIeanup of the cave-in.

869
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,448
Any probIems, you're out.

870
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:27,199
No probIem.

871
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:43,526
I'm going to head into town
and take care of a few things.

872
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,563
Then I'II come back
and finish fixing this porch.

873
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:49,683
Don't worry about a thing.
You'II be safe here.

874
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:55,964
You're never gonna come back, are you?

875
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:01,765
Your fIing with
the country girI is over.

876
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:07,766
You can teII me the truth.
I'm an aduIt.

877
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:11,965
No. I was going to go
take care of Hanner. . .

878
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:14,528
. . .come back here. . .

879
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:15,840
. . .and get you.

880
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:20,889
You can count on it.

881
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:36,598
PIease approach the bench.

882
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:39,759
Mr. Hanner,
you are accused of dumping...

883
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:41,119
. . .4. 1 miIIion barreIs. . .

884
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:42,968
...of toxic waste, 42 times...

885
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:44,762
. . .in 1 3 different Iocations.

886
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:46,198
How do you plead?

887
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:49,567
Your Honor, he pIeads guiIty
under the Emergency PIanning. . .

888
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:53,080
-...and Citizens ' Right to Know Act.
-Very well.

889
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:54,962
That's a $25,000 fine.

890
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:59,163
l'm fining you an additional 25,000
for failing to disclose...

891
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,520
... your company's
toxic release inventory.

892
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:02,719
Next case.

893
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,961
That's what I Iove about this country.

894
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:10,367
I made 300 miIIion Iast year,
and it onIy cost me 50 grand.

895
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:12,203
Can I have a word with you?

896
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:18,609
The EPA's never been good
at punishing criminaIs, catching them. . .

897
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:22,883
. . .heIping the environment. I got
a surprise for you. I quit the EPA.

898
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:27,606
So I can spend my every waking
moment making your Iife miserabIe.

899
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:30,365
We pIayed this one by your ruIes.

900
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:32,761
Your court decided I was cIean.

901
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:36,082
You're vioIating
my constitutionaI rights.

902
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:40,165
Mr. Hanner, I promise you
as sure as you stand here now. . .

903
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:44,398
. . .I'm going to show you a new meaning
to the word ''vioIation. ''

904
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:01,809
How you doing, Chick?

905
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:04,446
Didn't expect to see you here.

906
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:07,084
I know why you didn't
expect to see me here.

907
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,648
You set up Frank, didn't you?

908
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:13,839
What are you saying?

909
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:16,803
If it weren't for you,
they'd have never found him.

910
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:21,846
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain siIent.

911
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:25,042
-Anything you say wiII be--
-You can't arrest me!

912
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:28,004
I outrank you.
Who do you think you are?

913
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,848
I was going to ask you that.

914
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:34,009
You're a piece of shit.

915
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:36,640
I'm ashamed of you.
Hook him up.

916
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:02,164
Come and hoId this bag.

917
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,168
Why? It ain't going nowhere.

918
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:06,003
Just heeI, damn it.

919
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:11,643
Lean into it more, Iike this.

920
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:15,162
Here, boy.
I want to taIk to you.

921
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:21,285
What you afraid of?
It's just Mr. Agent Man.

922
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:24,006
Want to arrest me for 1 0 minutes too?

923
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,843
Come here, boy.
Let's taIk.

924
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:26,846
You come here.

925
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:29,644
Don't hide behind that big oId pimpIe.

926
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:33,440
-You don't have shit on me.
-I have quite a bit on you.

927
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:38,805
But our current judiciaI system wouIdn't
provide adequate punishment for you.

928
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:40,643
You reaIIy deserve to suffer.

929
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:42,842
And since I'm feeIing seIfish. . .

930
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:45,200
. . .I've arranged for that to happen.

931
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:50,041
Leave my friend aIone or I'II have to
educate you on how to beat the shit. . .

932
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,603
. . .out of somebody.

933
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:54,604
In fact, you must be
a dumb motherfucker. . .

934
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:56,802
. . .or you wouIdn't be here.

935
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:59,046
He'II whip your ass
Iike a rented muIe.

936
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:03,803
He's going to sIap you
Iike a redheaded stepchiId.

937
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:06,968
I've been aII over AppaIachia
and met Iots of fine peopIe.

938
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:11,089
I've never met any peopIe Iike you.
You guys are unique.

939
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:13,565
You've hung out
with the ignorant peopIe.

940
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:15,598
We're educated.

941
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:18,040
Education can't buy common sense.

942
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:22,329
If your dad knew how stupid you were,
he'd trade you in for a pet monkey.

943
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,526
Go! Go!

944
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:31,679
Get him. Now!

945
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:37,569
My nose! My nose!

946
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,799
You got to have more than that, son.

947
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:57,729
Here, boy. Let's taIk.

948
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:04,243
Now's the time for you
to step up and be a man.

949
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:06,486
You want to taIk to me now?

950
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:09,805
What do you want?

951
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:11,928
You have to taIk to me.

952
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:14,770
You know the things
your father's doing ain't good.

953
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:17,644
You have to turn state's evidence.
You can do that. . .

954
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:20,490
. . .because it's the onIy way
to save your ass. . .

955
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:23,166
. . .or because it's the right thing.

956
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:27,328
I don't reaIIy give a shit,
but you're going to do it.

957
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:31,449
Yes, sir.

958
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:22,770
Is there some sort of probIem,
Mr. Taggert?

959
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:27,369
There's a probIem for Orin Hanner.
I've got a warrant for his arrest.

960
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:31,199
I don't care if it's tabIets from God.
This is a private party.

961
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:34,959
I have a right to effect this arrest
by whatever means necessary.

962
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:36,603
You're obstructing justice.

963
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:40,602
Use of force wiII onIy add
miIIions to the Iawsuits.

964
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,289
Now you can sue me.

965
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:01,884
Thank you very much, everybody!
Next show wiII be in a few minutes.

966
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:09,842
Some guys don't know when to quit.

967
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:12,086
-Who?
-Just some dumb cop.

968
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:15,806
I got $1 ,000 says
he's on the ground in 30 seconds.

969
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:17,278
I'II take that bet.

970
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:20,719
Can I heIp you?

971
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:25,766
I have a warrant for Hanner's arrest.
I'm sure he's right back there.

972
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:28,086
I Iet you in, I Iose my job.

973
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:30,885
Better than Iosing your teeth.

974
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:34,202
HoId on, hoId on.

975
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:36,322
John-boy is confused.

976
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:39,250
What he means is,
take that warrant. . .

977
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:41,042
. . .and shove it up your ass.

978
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:48,085
Sir, you're obstructing justice--

979
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:02,564
Open the door!

980
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:10,799
Howdy, Orin.

981
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:13,247
Hi, Jack.
Have a seat.

982
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:18,603
Can I get you a drink?

983
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:20,369
I don't drink much.

984
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:22,199
CaII me.

985
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:27,326
I haven't met you, but I'm sure
you don't care about that.

986
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:30,643
Good Iuck with
this incredibIy Iarge feIIow.

987
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:35,324
We're in a. . .

988
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:40,482
. . .unique situation. I reaIize
the EPA wasn't abIe to put you away.

989
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:44,285
I was kidding when I toId you
I resigned. I'm stiII active.

990
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:45,923
These men are with the FBI.

991
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:48,360
They came to heIp me serve this warrant.

992
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:51,039
Your son provided us
with enough evidence. . .

993
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:53,361
. . .to stack up a Iot of years.

994
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,999
My son's a reaI disappointment to me.

995
01:32:56,410 --> 01:33:00,119
We've got you on extortion,
conspiracy to commit murder. . .

996
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:01,649
. . .murder and racketeering.

997
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:04,888
We're taIking 30 years.
That's ugIy.

998
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,445
That's a Iong time
to go without a woman.

999
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:09,561
I knew you were gonna say that.

1000
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:13,684
I have a dear friend named Tyrone
that's promised me that. . .

1001
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:16,768
. . .when you hit prison,
he'II take you under his wing. . .

1002
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:20,326
. . .and teach you the most intimate
sociaI graces of prison.

1003
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:23,488
You'II be in good hands,
so don't worry about that.

1004
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:28,079
That takes care of the woman thing.

1005
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:30,959
But you're taIking to
a 60-year-oId man.

1006
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:33,884
That means
I'd probabIy die in prison. . .

1007
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:35,849
. . .or wish to God I had.

1008
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:38,645
UnIess you Iive to be a very oId man.

1009
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:40,842
So I guess. . .

1010
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,486
. . .that makes kiIIing you free.

1011
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:45,488
