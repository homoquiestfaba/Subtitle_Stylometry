We've got to get you to the hospital.

50
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,671

51
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,862
I've got to get the car started.

52
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:41,971
- What's wrong with her?

53
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:42,804

54
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,077
and tell 'em we're on our way.

55
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:45,821

(suspenseful music)

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,655

and vomiting begin?

00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:54,707
- This evening.

59
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:56,149
- She eat anything she
normally doesn't eat?

60
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,367
- No, I don't know, I don't think so.

61
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,068
- Right, start an IV with
three times the normal saline.

62
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:01,744
Get an arterial blood gas.

63
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:03,154
Stay here, we'll be right back.

64
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:04,758
Begin a chemistry profile.

65
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:05,591
Go, go!

(sirens whirling)

67
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,526

(phone ringing)

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,321
- Nurse, we're here to see Nancy Lyons.

70
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:28,440
- [Man] Dad.

71
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,273
Daddy.

72
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:31,220
- [Richard] , what the hell is going on?

73
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,053
Where's the doctor?

74
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:33,150
- They're running some tests.

75
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,300
- What kind of tests?

76
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,507
- [Bill Junior] They
took Nancy to the ICU.

77
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:36,440
- ICU?

78
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,273
- [Mother] How bad is she?

79
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:38,895
- [Richard] Pretty bad, I don't know.

80
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,080
- Mr. Lyon may I speak with you?

81
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,913
- Of course.

82
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:42,820
- Doctor.

83
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,830
- Doctor I'm Bill Dillard, Nancy's father.

84
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,170
What's wrong with her?

85
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,506
- She's having severe nausea and vomiting.

86
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:49,377
We haven't isolated the problem yet.

87
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:51,480
Right now we're just
trying to keep her stable.

88
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,250
- [Bill] You mean you don't
know what's wrong with her.

89
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,800
- We suspect food poisoning,

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,406
maybe even Toxic Shock Syndrome.

91
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:58,240
but her symptoms are atypical

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,860
and we're doing everything we can.

93
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,160
- [Bill] There's go to be something more--

94
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,660
- We may be able to get an answer

95
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,002
when we get her blood tests back.

96
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:05,135
- Is there anything I can do?

97
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:08,150
- Yes, you can call her
friends, her associates at work,

98
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,702
find out if she's eaten anything
that's out of the ordinary.

99
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:12,490
And I need you to fill out those forms

100
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,096
up at the front, I'm sorry.

101
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:15,120
- Okay.

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,271
- Look I know this is a tough time.

103
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,194
- [Son] Daddy.

104
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:18,915
- [Bill] What?

105
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:20,881
- I'll be up in ICU if you need me.

106
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:24,233
- No wait, I think you
should hear this too doctor.

107
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,707
(machines beeping)

108
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:43,750
(Nancy moaning)
(machines beeping)

109
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,950
- I'm gonna take this
mask off for a minute.

110
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:48,701
They're never very comfortable.

111
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:50,270
(machine beeping)

112
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,110
What's this I hear about
you getting some bad wine?

113
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,916
- What, who said that?

114
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,483
- Your family.

115
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,027
- Oh, somebody left some
on the porch, a gift.

116
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,843
- They also said you've been
taking some kind of pills.

117
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,339
- Pills, oh those.

118
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,580
No, they were vitamins.

119
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,008
I thought they made me
sick, I stopped taking them.

120
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,800
- Your vitamins, where'd they come from?

121
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,352
- Come from?

122
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,800
I don't know.

123
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,160
(machine beeping)

124
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,400
Richard.

125
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,160
- Do you still have the
vitamins and the wine?

126
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,497
- Yes.

127
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:50,206
(Nancy gasping)

128
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:54,260
- All right nurse, nurse!

129
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,093
Breathe.

130
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:55,926
- [Nurse] Yeah doctor.

131
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:58,432
- Breathe, breathe Nancy, stay with me.

132
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:01,099
(Nancy gasping)

133
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:05,764
(dramatic music)

134
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:30,599
- [Nanny] I can never
find anything in here.

135
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,349
(dramatic music)

136
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:57,110
This is all stuff from her therapy.

137
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,710
I don't know where else to look.

138
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,560
- She did say something about a truck.

139
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,443
Now is there a truck around here?

140
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,000
(dramatic music)

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,606
- Wait, wait, I know.

142
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:10,636
(dramatic music)

143
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:11,578
I completely forgot.

144
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:14,777
(dramatic music)

145
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:18,167
We had a garage sale, Nancy
asked me to keep this for her.

146
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,917
(dramatic music)

147
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:38,696
(lock clicking)

148
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:41,446
(dramatic music)

149
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:45,373
- What's going on?

150
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,440
- The doctor wants everything
that Nancy might have eaten.

151
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,203
How is she?

152
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:54,482
- About the same.

153
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,963
- You should get some rest.

154
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,083
- I just a shower and change my clothes.

155
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,420
I'll take the girls to
school in the morning,

156
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,583
you can help him.

157
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:18,508
(dramatic music)

158
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,968
(phone beeping)

159
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:36,555
(phone ringing)

160
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,888
- Hello.

161
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:53,223
- Bridgette, hi, I'm
sorry to call so late.

162
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,210
- Honey what's wrong?

163
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,250
- I've been at the hospital all night.

164
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,960
- [Bridgette] What?

165
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,403
- Nancy's in intensive care.

166
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:11,130
- Oh, what is it, that blood problem?

167
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,040
- Oh they don't know, they're running

168
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,190
every test they've got.

169
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,829
The whole family's down
there, you ought to see 'em,

170
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:22,483
it's still the blame Richard club.

171
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:25,633
- Oh they're still just
bitter about the separation.

172
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,944
- I don't know.

173
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,083
- [Bridgette] Is there anything I can do?

174
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,350
- No, I just needed someone to talk to.

175
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:41,233
- You know I'm always here for you.

176
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,203
- Thanks.

177
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:46,897
Bridgette, I--

178
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,243
- [Child] Daddy.

179
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,060
- I gotta go, I'll call you later.

180
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,453
Sweetheart, what are you
doing out of bed sleepy girl?

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,927
Come on, what's the matter?

182
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,877
Did your bunny rabbit have a bad dream?

183
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:32,267
(birds chirping)
(sirens whirling)

184
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:38,691
(machines beeping)

185
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,853
- Nurse get me a stethoscope.

186
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,895
(machines beeping)

187
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:46,112
- [Nurse] Here you go doctor.

188
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:49,029
(machines beeping)

189
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:55,816
(machine beeping)
(heavy breathing)

190
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,650
(dramatic music)

191
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:54,585
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

192
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,379
- Nancy.

193
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:23,944
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

194
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:24,989
Nancy.

195
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:28,339
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

196
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:29,347
it's Mommy.

197
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:32,596
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

198
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:33,718
Can you hear me honey?

199
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:38,718
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

200
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:40,597
I'll always remember
the day you were born.

201
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:43,996
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

202
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:46,058
You were the most beautiful baby.

203
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,351
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

204
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,980
Such a beautiful baby.

205
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,980
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

206
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,063
You remember when Alison was born?

207
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:02,969
Do you, do you?

208
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,955
Do you remember when your
baby daughter was born?

209
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:10,693
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

210
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,584
(Nancy gasping)

211
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:17,584
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

212
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,161
No Nancy.

213
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:20,249
(Machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

214
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:21,082
No Nancy.

215
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:25,421
(machine beeping)
(dramatic music)

216
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:26,504
Nancy, Nancy.

217
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,410
(machine beeping)
(solemn music)

218
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:36,475
(solemn music)

219
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:52,754
(people chattering)
(dramatic music)

220
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,913
- Hey Bill.

221
00:14:56,913 --> 00:15:00,244
- [Lady] Right there on the corner.

222
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:02,464
(phone ringing)

223
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:04,149
(loud knocking)

224
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:08,097
- Well, well, well, darling, get in here.

225
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:08,930
Sit down.

226
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,550
So what do I owe the honor?

227
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,200
- Nancy Lyon.

228
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,052
- Wait, I just got this here report.

229
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:18,560
And it's a little early
for the DA's office,

230
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,393
so now what's up?

231
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:21,732
- I hear we may be
looking at a murder case.

232
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:23,399
- Now that could be.

233
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:25,680
This what we've got for now.

234
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,855
- What did the autopsy show?

235
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:28,893
- [Ortega] Arsenic.

236
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,880
- [DA] Nasty business.

237
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,070
- [Ortega] Mm-hmm(affirmative).

238
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,933
- Anything else?

239
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,919
- Well her brother pulled
some stuff from the house,

240
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,470
some vitamin pills laced
with barium carbonate.

241
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,955
And that's a poison but it's
not the poison that killed her.

242
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,780
(phone ringing)

243
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,580
- Did I hear they had tested some wine.

244
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,015
- Yeah, that was clean.

245
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:55,321
It's a Cabernet, good one I'm told.

246
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,370
(phone ringing)

247
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,620
- So where's the arsenic?

248
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:01,243
- I don't know, yet.

249
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,660
But I'm going over to the Dillard's,

250
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,000
would you care to tag along?

251
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,444
- [DA] I would.

252
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:12,450
- Now, now you're gonna
keep up aren't you?

253
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,283
- [DA] I Promise.

254
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:14,116
- [Detective] Good.

255
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:14,949
- [DA] I'm right behind you.

256
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:15,961
- [Detective] All right.

257
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:18,260
(birds chirping)

258
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,110
- [DA] Thank you.

259
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,983
- Thank you very much.

260
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,363
- Hello, Detective Ortega.

261
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:34,840
How do you do, I'm Nancy's mother.

262
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,750
Thank you so very much for coming.

263
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,832
- [Ortega] This is assistant
district attorney Jerri Sims.

264
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,610
- How do you do?

265
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,610
My husband's waiting for us,

266
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,410
would you just come this way please?

267
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,840
Bill, this is Ms. Sims from
the district attorney's office.

268
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,324
- [Bill] Ms. Sims.

269
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:53,250
- [Sue] And of course Detective Ortega.

270
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,083
- [Bill] Detective.

271
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,672
- [Ortega] Mr. Dillard.

272
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:56,505
- [Bill] Please, sit down.

273
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,393
This is my son Bill Junior
and his wife Mary Helen.

274
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,450
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

275
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,404
I promise you, we'll do everything we can

276
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,534
to get to the bottom of this.

277
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,640
- Now I have seen the toxicology report

278
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,713
from the autopsy, and it
was definitely arsenic.

279
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,730
- I just don't understand who

280
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,049
would want to poison our
Nancy, I really don't.

281
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,050
Who would do such a thing?

282
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,440
- Oh Mama, I'll tell you who,

283
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,373
Richard, her husband, that's who.

284
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:35,051
- Yes I understand that you
have reason to suspect Mr. Lyon.

285
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:38,819
- He gave her poisoned
pills, poisoned wine,

286
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:40,580
she dies of poison.

287
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,072
- Well the wine checked out clean,

288
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:47,120
the pills contained the
poison barium carbonate,

289
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,170
that is not that effective
on humans, it's for rats.

290
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,710
- I can understand your anger.

291
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,940
But if Mr. Lyon did poison his wife,

292
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,750
we still have to make a case.

293
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,646
- And why would Mr. Lyon
want to poison Mrs. Lyon?

294
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,990
- For the money, why else.?

295
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,474
- Oh perhaps.

296
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:09,321
Richard left our Nancy for
another woman not long ago.

297
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:13,293
It didn't work out I suppose,
she was younger than him.

298
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,370
- Who was this other woman?

299
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,130
- Bridgette Tyler.

300
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,323
- What happened, happened.

301
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,210
Richard and Nancy reconciled,

302
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,677
they were trying to put
their marriage back together,

303
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:27,560
at least we'd hoped so.

304
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,810
- Soon after that her health
goes south, now she's dead.

305
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,840
He's there in the hose
with the girls, who's next?

306
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,695
- Oh honey calm down, let
the detective do his job.

307
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:39,764
- Now do you have any
ideas about the arsenic,

308
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:42,796
where it might have come from,

309
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:46,521
did Nancy use arsenic for anything?

310
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:49,400
- No, not that I know of.

311
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,300
- I can't imagine what for.

312
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,020
- But you know shortly
after she and Richard

313
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,950
got separated, when things got really bad,

314
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,680
you remember Nancy told us that she found

315
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,860
a check, I mean a carbon of a check,

316
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
you know that Richard had
written to some company.

317
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,020
She suspected that he was
buying all these drugs.

318
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,743
She was afraid he was trying
to poison her back then.

319
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,253
- Well did she tell you
the name of the company?

320
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,520
- Oh I don't remember but
I think it was in Houston.

321
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,723
But you know another time,
Richard had given her a soda

322
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:17,290
that tasted strange to her, and she saw

323
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,300
some kind of powder floating
on it, so she dumped it.

324
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,322
- When was this?

325
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:24,670
Nobody did anything?

326
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,650
- Nancy was embarrassed,
she thought people

327
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,980
would only think she was crazy.

328
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,936
That it would sound like
the typical divorce story.

329
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:36,123
It did seem a bit far fetched.

330
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:37,214
- Can you think of anyone else

331
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:39,973
who might have wanted to harm Nancy?

332
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,453
- Everyone loved Nancy.

333
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,400
- Well, if there's anything
else that you can think of,

334
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,753
please, give us a call.

335
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,953
- You mean you're not
gonna arrest Richard?

336
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,750
- No, not 'til I have more evidence.

337
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,802
Mr. Dillard.

338
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:07,657
- Let me show you out.

339
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:18,863
- I don't get it, she
suspects she's being poisoned

340
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:21,980
but she doesn't do anything
about it, until it's too late.

341
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,973
- Well nobody likes to
believe those things.

342
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,888
(dog barking)

343
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:30,638
(dramatic music)

344
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,395
- Can Mommy see what I'm wearing?

345
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:50,700
(dramatic music)

346
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,174
- I think your mommy can see everything.

347
00:20:52,174 --> 00:20:55,900
- Anna says Mommy was in
the statue in the garden.

348
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,712
- I saw the pretty flowers Anna.

349
00:20:57,712 --> 00:21:00,462
(dramatic music)

350
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,563
It's gonna be okay sweetie.

351
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,500
(dramatic music)

352
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,358
It's all gonna be all right.

353
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:11,108
(dramatic music)

354
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,615
- Tell me not, the lower numbers,

355
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:19,963
life is but an empty dream.

356
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:24,188
For the soul is dead, it slumbers,

357
00:21:24,188 --> 00:21:27,453
things are not what they seem.

358
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:33,513
Life is real, life is earnest,

359
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,220
and the grave is not its goal.

360
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:40,810
Dust thy are to dust returneth
is not spoken of the soul.

361
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,460
Not enjoyment and not sorrow
is our destined end or way.

362
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,800
But to act that each tomorrow
finds us farther than today.

363
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,613
(solemn music)

364
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,231
- Mrs. Chandler, do you
know anything about these

365
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:12,970
vitamin pills that Mrs. Lyon
was supposed to be taking?

366
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,410
- [Mrs. Chandler] Not really.

367
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,200
- Did Mrs. Lyon mention her suspicions

368
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,130
that Richard was trying to drug her?

369
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,560
- Excuse me?

370
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,110
- [Jerri] Anything about drugs.

371
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:27,490
- Well I know that Nancy and
Richard were having problems,

372
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,433
but I can't imagine Richard
giving drugs to anyone.

373
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,990
- You knew that marriage
better than anybody,

374
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,930
can you tell us about it?

375
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,930
What was Nancy like?

376
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,370
- Well, she was one of
those unprofessional mothers

377
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,313
that you read about, always working hard.

378
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:50,340
I mean she was very good at her job,

379
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,968
I just look at all of her buildings.

380
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:55,450
(phone ringing)

381
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,029
I mean I was glad that she was busy,

382
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:01,424
I loved those little girls.

383
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:05,283
- And Richard, what about him?

384
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:12,334
- Well Richard was, he
used to love to go into

385
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,900
the garden with the
girls and plant flowers

386
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,283
or some other project.

387
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,613
And even when Nancy was there,

388
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,374
lots of times she had work to do.

389
00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:29,124
(dramatic music)

390
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:31,982
- [Richard] That's it.

391
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:33,237
- [Allison] There.

392
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,070
- [Richard] There we go.

393
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,903
Okay sweetheart thank you.

394
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:35,736
I'm gonna work in the fertilizer

395
00:23:35,736 --> 00:23:36,569
and you go over there and get the hose.

396
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:38,735
- Fertilizer, that's
all he ever thinks of.

397
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:40,167
- [Richard] I heard that.

398
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:44,147
- Good, time to clean up.

399
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:46,897
(dramatic music)

400
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,002
Come on, party's in a few hours.

401
00:23:50,002 --> 00:23:51,535
(dramatic music)

402
00:23:51,535 --> 00:23:52,930
(water spraying)

403
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,257
Allison, Allison.

404
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:55,921
(Richard screaming)
(Allison laughing)

405
00:23:55,921 --> 00:23:58,216
- [Nancy] No, no, don't get that.

406
00:23:58,216 --> 00:23:59,540
- Oh you didn't.

407
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,817
(Richard laughing)
(Allison screaming)

408
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:02,270
(everyone laughing)

409
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,474
You've got your own defense.

410
00:24:04,474 --> 00:24:05,602
- [Nancy] Oh yeah.

411
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:06,988
(everyone laughing)

412
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,910
- [Richard] Come on, come
on, I give up, I give up!

413
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,493
Aha, I got you now.

414
00:24:12,435 --> 00:24:15,314
(everyone laughing)
(Nancy screaming)

415
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:17,932
- Oh stop it, oh look at
what you did, look at this.

416
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:18,888
Oh look what you did!

417
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:20,816
- [Richard] Oh I'm sorry.

418
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:21,649
- Look what you did.
- I'm sorry Nancy, really.

419
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:22,902
- Look at this, it's all my work.

420
00:24:22,902 --> 00:24:24,462
You just ruined it.

421
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,731
- I'm sorry.

422
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:28,481
(dramatic music)

423
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
- [Mrs. Chandler] I could see the pressure

424
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,240
that Richard was under.

425
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,464
Nancy was just more successful,

426
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:39,513
and I think that made it hard for him.

427
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:43,693
And then there were the family affairs.

428
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,650
Richard, he always seemed so uncomfortable

429
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,268
and I think he really tried.

430
00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:53,963
But he was an outsider.

431
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,011
He just didn't fit in.

432
00:24:57,011 --> 00:25:02,011
(soft piano music)
(party goers chattering)

433
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:13,760
(Bill and kids laughing)

434
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,260
- They went that-a-way.

435
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,881
Make sure they don't break anything.

436
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,910
- They should be in the nursery,

437
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,720
I never allowed you all to
run rampant through a party.

438
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,428
- Mother, they're fine.

439
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:27,345
(soft piano music)

440
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:36,295
(party goers laughing)
(soft piano music)

441
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:42,131
(Bill laughing)
(soft piano music)

442
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:55,290
- To my daughter Nancy,
may her success continues.

443
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,100
- [Everyone] To Nancy!

444
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,840
- To my lovely, lovely sister Nancy.

445
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,050
The finest architect the
Armadillo State has ever produced.

446
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,883
- [Everyone] Here, here.

447
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,226
- Too bad she had to run
off and marry a damn Yankee.

448
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:11,796
(Bill laughing)

449
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:15,213
(party goers chattering)

450
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,840
- [Richard] Why'd you have
to go off and marry a Yankee?

451
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,870
- Oh, he's just kidding.

452
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,030
Don't make such a big deal
our of every little thing.

453
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,349
He had too much to drink.

454
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:33,050
- He had more then too much
to drink and you know it.

455
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,660
Or was that another Dillard family taboo

456
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,830
we're not supposed to talk about.

457
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,999
Everybody is perfect,
everybody is from Texas.

458
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:41,343
- Richard, stop it.

459
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:42,860
- I don't know how you deal with it,

460
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,180
but I'll tell you something right now,

461
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,027
I can't deal with it.

462
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:50,953
- I guess that was part of the problem.

463
00:26:53,188 --> 00:26:55,123
I don't think Richard felt as successful

464
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:57,163
as other people around him.

465
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,603
He wasn't a Dillard, he never would be.

466
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:03,977
- Is there anything else?

467
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:07,350
- Well they did take a vacation

468
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,146
or a trip of some kind, everybody.

469
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,810
They went to Arizona
and when they came back,

470
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,820
it's almost like they
were different people.

471
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,211
- What do you mean?

472
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:20,830
- Well Richard seemed
to be away all the time,

473
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,193
even around Christmas.

474
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,633
Nancy started seeing a psychiatrist.

475
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,040
I remember it just seemed to be

476
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,470
a very hard time for everybody,
Anna and Allison too.

477
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,317
- Isn't Daddy coming?

478
00:27:38,314 --> 00:27:40,603
- I'm not sure sweetheart.

479
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:44,541
- [Allison] I want him to come home.

480
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,736
(Christmas music)

481
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:49,320
- Well, you remember when Mommy
used to work all the time?

482
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,190
Well now Daddy has to work.

483
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,930
We're taking turns.

484
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,432
- Why did you stop working?

485
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:57,160
(Christmas music)

486
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,144
- Well, 'cause I wanted to spend more time

487
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:03,231
with my two little girls, that's why.

488
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:06,810
(Christmas music)

489
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,231
And how 'bout

490
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:10,701
♪ Jingle bells, Batman smells ♪

491
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:13,432
♪ Robin laid an egg ♪

492
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:16,325
♪ Batman lost a tire ♪

493
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:19,477
♪ And Joker got away, hey ♪

494
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:20,480
- [Nancy] Oh, that's not nice.

495
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,980
- [Child] Daddy taught us that one.

496
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,420
- [Nancy] Oh he did, well.

497
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,253
- [Girls] Daddy!

498
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,653
- [Richard] Merry Christmas.

499
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,160
- [Child] Are those presents for now?

500
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,323
- [Richard] Don't you want to
wait 'til Christmas morning?

501
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:36,338
- [Child] No way!

502
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:37,673
- [Richard] Okay, but
just one a piece now.

503
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:45,835
- Home for Christmas?

504
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,450
- Well I can't miss that.

505
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:56,158
- [Nancy] Well yeah, but you just come

506
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:59,410
and drop off gifts and then take off.

507
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,020
- [Richard] What am I supposed to do,

508
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,620
pretend like nothing's wrong?

509
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,910
The way your whole family has been

510
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,887
pretending for the last 30 years.

511
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:07,630
- [Nancy] Why do you keep harping on it,

512
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,930
I'm dealing with it.

513
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,170
- Dealing with it, how?

514
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,160
By quitting your job, by
seeing a shrink all the time?

515
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,517
Look at you, you're unraveling.

516
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:17,380
- Of course I'm unraveling,
I mean you walk out,

517
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,712
you take up with another woman.

518
00:29:18,712 --> 00:29:20,550
Don't tell me that's a handful.

519
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,800
- I didn't want it to turn out like this.

520
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,590
- I even get bills for her jewelry.

521
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,153
- You think I wanted it
to turn out like this?

522
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:28,116
- It just all makes me sick.

523
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:29,273
I mean if you're so all new and Christian,

524
00:29:29,273 --> 00:29:30,510
just tell me what to do.

525
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,900
- I can't tell you what to do,

526
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,599
I don't know what you
should do, I really don't.

527
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,050
And you want to know the truth,

528
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,922
I don't even know if I care anymore.

529
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:39,310
- [Nancy] Well what about the girls?

530
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,296
- I love the girls, don't
throw that in my face!

531
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:43,030
- [Nancy] Oh that's really good.

532
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,435
Just run back to your
little girlfriend huh.

533
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:45,931
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

534
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:48,598
(ominous music)

535
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:53,977
(Nancy sobbing)

536
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:56,644
(ominous music)

537
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:06,688
- Shh, it'll be all right.

538
00:30:06,688 --> 00:30:10,374
(ominous music)
(Nancy sobbing)

539
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:12,133
- I'm not gonna let him do this.

540
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:14,304
(ominous music)

541
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:15,432
I'm not gonna let him go.

542
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:17,650
(solemn music)

543
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,460
- So what do you suppose
she meant by that?

544
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,023
- Well she couldn't let him go.

545
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,150
She was willing to do almost anything

546
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,775
to change herself, the way she dressed.

547
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:31,507
He was almost like an addiction to her.

548
00:30:31,507 --> 00:30:34,400
- And this was after they
came back from Arizona?

549
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,233
- [Mrs. Chandler] Yes.

550
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,618
- Was Richard living with
his girlfriend at the time?

551
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,470
- Well he had his own apartment,

552
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,700
but you know how those things go,

553
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,470
they were practically glued together.

554
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,480
That's why Nancy drove such a
hard bargain at the divorce.

555
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,616
- Oh, how hard a bargain was that?

556
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:52,370
- Well Richard wanted to
share everything equally.

557
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,273
Nancy said that over my dead body.

558
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:01,317
What I mean is that,
she wasn't going to let

559
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,750
him two-step out of her
life just like that.

560
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,849
She demanded full custody, child support,

561
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:09,573
she even changed her
life insurance policy.

562
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,140
- Life insurance?

563
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,330
- Yes, she gave the money to the girls.

564
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,900
- How do you know this?

565
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,750
- I witnessed it.

566
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:21,673
- Did Richard know about this?

567
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,190
- Not sure.

568
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,783
- So she pulls out all
the stops, what did he do?

569
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,670
- Well he tried to patch things up.

570
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:33,827
- A few months later, she's dead.

571
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,430
Did she seem like the kind of woman

572
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,206
who would sit quietly by and
allow herself to be poisoned?

573
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:43,840
- What do you mean?

574
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,385
- Mrs. Lyon died from
poisoning, didn't you know that?

575
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:50,370
- Yes, but ...

576
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,550
- Ms. Chandler, don't
say anything to Richard

577
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,320
about our conversation here,

578
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,150
especially the part about
what Nancy died from.

579
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,120
- Sure, but doesn't he know that?

580
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,110
- As far as I know he doesn't.

581
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,793
I mean he never called the hospital

582
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:06,790
to find out what happened.

583
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,040
- Unless he already knew.

584
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:16,442
(phone ringing)
(office workers chattering)

585
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,050
(horn honking)

586
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,820
- Phone records, bank records the records

587
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,305
from the supply house in Houston,

588
00:32:22,305 --> 00:32:25,908
we've even served all of
the delivery services.

589
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:29,760
- Unfortunately we still can't
link Richard to the arsenic.

590
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,720
- Oh why can't you just bust the guy?

591
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,140
I mean you've got poison
pills, a mistress,

592
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,660
you've got motives all over the place.

593
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,130
- Yeah.
- We need solid evidence.

594
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,010
- Or we might lose the case in court.

595
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,537
- Unless we can prove conclusively

596
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:42,977
that Richard had arsenic
in his possession.

597
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:44,867
- [Jerri] And that dog don't hunt.

598
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:48,600
- Well you're gonna have to do something.

599
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,540
I think he's on to us.

600
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,530
- This came this morning,
it's some kind of a,

601
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,973
I don't know what.

602
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:59,679
(suspenseful music)

603
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,183
- Nobody's friend.

604
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,330
My name is Gossip, I have
no respect for justice,

605
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,721
I maim without killing, I
break hearts and ruin lives.

606
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:13,510
I am cunning and malicious,
but my victims are helpless.

607
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,770
They cannot protect themselves
because I have no name,

608
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,573
no face, I am Gossip.

609
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,200
- Now may I remind you
that while you're searching

610
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,143
for solid evidence, that man
is watching Nancy's children.

611
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:36,952
(dog barking)

612
00:33:44,183 --> 00:33:46,422
- Oh can I help you with those?

613
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:48,005
- I'm okay, thanks.

614
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:54,208
- [Bridget] Richard.

615
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,470
- Yeah, oh hi Ellen.

616
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,360
You haven't met Bridgette yet, have you?

617
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,450
- [Bridgette] I've
heard so much about you,

618
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,757
it's nice to finally meet you.

619
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:05,310
(phone ringing)

620
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,143
- Thanks.

621
00:34:07,327 --> 00:34:09,100
(phone ringing)

622
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,275
- That's probably for me, excuse me.

623
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:13,792
(phone ringing)

624
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:14,904
- [Allison] Nanny!

625
00:34:14,904 --> 00:34:17,245
Look, look, we're having a party.

626
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:19,854
- Look what you girls have been up to.

627
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:21,670
It looks so beautiful.

628
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,090
Anna did you help?

629
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,923
- We both did.

630
00:34:23,923 --> 00:34:26,911
And look, this one's
Daddy's, this one's mine,

631
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:29,556
this one's Anna's, and this one's yours.

632
00:34:29,556 --> 00:34:31,135
- Hmm.

633
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,440
- And this one's Mommy's.

634
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,663
If we make it really fun, Mommy will come.

635
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,735
- Allie, I'm sure that your
mommy would really like to come,

636
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:48,183
but when people die they just,
you know they just can't.

637
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:59,383
(dramatic music)

638
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:50,997
(soft knocking)

639
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:53,300
(dramatic music)

640
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,133
Richard?

641
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,863
- Hi Ellen.

642
00:35:57,863 --> 00:36:02,764
I'm just wading through
some of Nancy's stuff here.

643
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:05,440
You have no idea the amount of paperwork

644
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,062
you have to go through when somebody dies.

645
00:36:08,062 --> 00:36:08,979
- I'm sure.

646
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:13,095
Is there anything I can
help you with before I go?

647
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:15,730
- No, no I'm just trying to make sense

648
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,233
out of this insurance policy.

649
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,965
- Oh, is that the most recent one?

650
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:23,660
- Recent, what do you meant?

651
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,853
- Well Nancy changed
the policy not long ago,

652
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,313
she left it to the girls.

653
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,300
I thought you knew.

654
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:34,250
(dramatic music)

655
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,247
- I don't know what you're talking about.

656
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:38,660
(solemn music)

657
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,837
No, no she would never do something

658
00:36:40,837 --> 00:36:42,480
like that without telling me.

659
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,941
There must be some mistake.

660
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:46,691
(dramatic music)

661
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,800
- Well maybe I'm just confused.

662
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,520
(dramatic music)

663
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,297
Well, good night.

664
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:56,153
- Good night.

665
00:36:56,153 --> 00:36:58,903
(dramatic music)

666
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,839
I've checked on the girls, they're fine.

667
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,589
(dramatic music)

668
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,335
- [Ellen] Goodnight.

669
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:21,416
- Goodnight.

670
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:24,166
(dramatic music)

671
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:43,388
(papers crashing)

672
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,380
- [Ortega] So what you're
saying is, the only other prints

673
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,943
that you found are those
of Mr. And Mrs. Dillard?

674
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,200
- Nobody else's, not even any partials.

675
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,250
- None, we tried everything.

676
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,164
No oil lightened prints at all.

677
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:06,263
If someone else wrote this,
they were wearing a glove.

678
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:07,973
- What about the stamp.

679
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:10,930
- It's a 25 cent. (laughs)

680
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,090
- Ha, ha.

681
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,288
- Your ran a saliva test?

682
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:14,996
- Came up negative.

683
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:18,863
Whoever applied the stamp,
used good 'ol Dallas tap water.

684
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,218
- That's what I said didn't I?

685
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:31,300
How are you holding up Mr. Lyon?

686
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,595
- [Richard] Okay, I guess.

687
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:34,330
- [Ortega] You're probably wondering

688
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,550
why you're here aren't you?

689
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,217
- [Richard] Something like that.

690
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,309
- [Ortega] Do you know
what your wife died of?

691
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:43,265
- [Richard] No.

692
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:45,433
- [Ortega] She died from poisoning.

693
00:38:47,462 --> 00:38:48,633
- Poison?

694
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:50,731
- Mm-hmm(affirmative).

695
00:38:52,518 --> 00:38:53,863
- Oh my god.

696
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,200
- Did you keep any
poisons around the house?

697
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:03,337
- No, just weed killer and
ant killer, stuff like that.

698
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:09,693
- Did you ever purchase
any stronger chemicals?

699
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,643
- No.

700
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,970
- Did you ever order any chemicals

701
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,970
from a company near Houston,
called Cam Ventures?

702
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:29,543
- Yes, that's the place
where I got the ant killer.

703
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:33,873
- Now what do you use to kill ants?

704
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:37,360
- I don't know the exact scientific name.

705
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,230
- [Ortega] Barium carbonate?

706
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,014
- Yes, I think that's it.

707
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:42,855
- Anything else, I mean you'd really

708
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:46,803
be helping us along here
if you could remember.

709
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,440
- Well the ants was pretty bad,

710
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,450
I didn't know what was going to work,

711
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,650
so I ordered a few
things to experiment with

712
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,000
to try and get rid of them.

713
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,290
- Well, like what?

714
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:07,603
- Sodium nitroferricyanide.

715
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,030
- Are you sure there wasn't anything else

716
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,390
that you ordered from Cam Ventures?

717
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,563
I mean anything stronger.

718
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:27,263
- Well at one point I might
have bought some arsenic acid.

719
00:40:27,263 --> 00:40:28,330
- [Ortega] Arsenic?

720
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,317
- Mm-hmm(affirmative).

721
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,763
- You mean arsenic?

722
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,629
- Yeah, that's right.

723
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:37,563
- Did that get rid of the ants?

724
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,500
- I never used it, I got rid of it

725
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,200
before the kids could get into it.

726
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,380
- What about your wife?

727
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,213
What about her?

728
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,783
- Well she died of arsenic poisoning.

729
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,643
And we believe it was not accidental.

730
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,390
- Are you saying she was murdered?

731
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,530
- Did you kill your wife Mr. Lyon?

732
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,120
- What?

733
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,766
- Did you poison Nancy Dillard Lyon?

734
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:06,000
- Certainly not!

735
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,730
- Did Bridgette Tyler
poison Nancy Dillard Lyon?

736
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,623
- What are you talking about?

737
00:41:09,623 --> 00:41:11,476
- How do you feel about taking
a lie detector test Mr. Lyon?

738
00:41:11,476 --> 00:41:13,380
- Fine, and I'm gonna call my lawyer.

739
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,775
- You do that.

740
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:17,775
(suspenseful music)

741
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,732
- Mr. Guthrie, we understand that Mr. Lyon

742
00:41:20,732 --> 00:41:22,678
has lost custody of his two children

743
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:25,720
to the victim's brother,
Bill Dillard Junior.

744
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,280
Has been Lyon been formally
charged with murder?

745
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,454
- No, the action of
the police and publicly

746
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,690
defaming Richard Lyon without any sort

747
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,696
of criminal charges is just outrageous.

748
00:41:34,696 --> 00:41:37,736
He's lost his wife, his
business is hurting,

749
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:39,921
and now they've taken his
children away from him.

750
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:40,924
And all of this before the police

751
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:43,210
have even finished their investigation.

752
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,680
- [Reporter] So you feel
the police have acted

753
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,275
prematurely in this situation?

754
00:41:46,275 --> 00:41:48,040
- [Guthrie] Yes I do, I feel it's

755
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,760
unacceptable action on their part.

756
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,034
And I intend--

757
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:52,419
- They're not gonna get away with this.

758
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:53,830
- [Guthrie] Exonerated of
all these false innuendos.

759
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,265
- [Reporter] Does Mr.
Lyon feel confident--

760
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:56,900
- And he pointed out that Dillard

761
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,950
has only gained temporary custody

762
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,927
and he intends to get his daughters back.

763
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:03,396
Mr. Lyon also stated that he was the one

764
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,020
who feared for his daughter's safety

765
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,432
while under Dillard's custody.

766
00:42:06,432 --> 00:42:07,920
He would not elaborate on those

767
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,640
allegations to this reporter.

768
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,710
The court will reconvene
on this matter March 15th.

769
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,654
- [Reporter] Thank you
Gordon, and now Roger.

770
00:42:14,654 --> 00:42:16,830
(phone ringing)

771
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,840
- Actually it was Mr. Dillard

772
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,130
who asked me to hire Richard.

773
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,863
And right after Richard dumped Nancy too.

774
00:42:23,532 --> 00:42:26,220
Well what the heck, that's the
kind of guy Bill Dillard is.

775
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,393
And Richard's a nice guy too.

776
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,950
I'll do whatever I can to help Detective.

777
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,600
This whole business is awful.

778
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,420
- [Ortega] You recognize this?

779
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,840
- [Man] What is it?

780
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,880
- It's an order for arsenic
under your company's name.

781
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,060
- Oh that's weird, we don't
use poisons in my nursery.

782
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,431
We're organic.

783
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:47,770
- Organic?

784
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:48,820
- [Man] That's right.

785
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,408
- So you have no idea
why that was ordered?

786
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:53,803
- Nope.

787
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,880
Wait, come to think of it, Richard had

788
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,470
a hell of a problem with fire ants.

789
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,092
At one point he was
complaining about it a lot.

790
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:06,218
They were biting his little girls.

791
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:08,913
Maybe he ordered it to kill the ants.

792
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,010
- [Jerri] Another letter,
this one is typed.

793
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,932
It says Bill Junior did it.

794
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:17,490
(ominous music)

795
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,785
- About Nancy Dillard Lyon, your suspect

796
00:43:20,785 --> 00:43:24,910
ought to be the man who
did it, Bill Dillard.

797
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:29,327
He's an evil person who paid
me to get rid of his sister,

798
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:31,839
but he only paid me partly.

799
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,236
Watch him close or I will get him soon.

800
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,170
(dramatic music)

801
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,780
DNA?

802
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,598
- Sealed with water too.

803
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:44,053
- We ought to get better
tasting stamps is what.

804
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:46,660
- You know I don't get it.

805
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,516
It's too obvious to be Richard.

806
00:43:48,516 --> 00:43:50,840
- Maybe.

807
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,696
- [Bill] Your Honor, no one loves

808
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,471
those little girls more
than my wife and I do.

809
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:57,420
- [Judge] No one's
doubting that Mr. Dillard.

810
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,670
But your allegations
against the children's

811
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,380
natural father are unproven.

812
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,990
- But the police have an
ongoing investigation.

813
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:09,060
They suspect that he killed
the children's mother.

814
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,760
- I'm well aware of that.

815
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,580
However at this time, the court finds

816
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,570
no sound basis for the restraining
order against Mr. Lyon,

817
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,111
who is still afforded the
presumption of innocence.

818
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:22,110
The court therefore dissolves the order

819
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,906
and returns custody of
the children to Mr. Lyon.

820
00:44:24,906 --> 00:44:26,090
- Yes.

821
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,400
- [Judge] The court is now in recess.

822
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,070
- Oh for God's sake, he killed my sister

823
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,276
and they're giving him her children.

824
00:44:32,276 --> 00:44:33,279
(lady speaking faintly)

825
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:34,112
Ah!

826
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:54,808
- [Bridget] Hey there you are.

827
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:55,960
- [Richard] Hey look girls,
Bridget's here for a visit.

828
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,050
- [Child] Is Nanny gonna take care of us?

829
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,360
- [Richard] We'll be okay
without Nanny sweetheart.

830
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,443
- [Bridget] Wow, your
hands are cold as ice.

831
00:45:17,154 --> 00:45:18,683
- [Child] Daddy, are we moving?

832
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:21,056
- No honey, we're just taking care

833
00:45:21,056 --> 00:45:23,927
of some of Mommy's things.

834
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:26,420
- [Bridget] Come on girl's,
let's get your things.

835
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,720
- I think I've gotten all
the boxes of Nancy's papers

836
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,040
that you wanted me to look at.

837
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,080
I'll get into them at the office tomorrow.

838
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,676
Hey, there's someone out
here I want you to meet.

839
00:45:34,676 --> 00:45:38,176
(camera shutter clicking)

840
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,840
We're just getting some photos.

841
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,976
Stoner, Stoner this is Richard.

842
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:49,510
Stoner's our private
investigator and secret weapon.

843
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:50,360
- How you doing?

844
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,704
- Richard, Stoner and I were talking,

845
00:45:52,704 --> 00:45:56,370
what do you think about
Bill Junior in all these?

846
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:57,558
- [Richard] What do you mean?

847
00:45:57,558 --> 00:45:59,008
- Well as a possible suspect.

848
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:04,551
- [Richard] Well, you think so?

849
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:08,330
- Well, I was wondering, does his family

850
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:11,080
inheritance increase
because of Nancy's death?

851
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,610
I mean I want to know if
he's hurting for money

852
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,550
or any problems or anything.

853
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,140
- [Richard] Bill Junior's
always had problems,

854
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,750
but I hate to say this, but I think maybe

855
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,220
we ought to start looking at Nancy.

856
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,891
- You mean suicide?

857
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:26,433
- It's freezing out here, come on inside.

858
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:31,890
I've been thinking about it.

859
00:46:33,131 --> 00:46:35,463
It's like there were two of her.

860
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,403
Two Nancy's I mean.

861
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:43,355
The one that she became,

862
00:46:43,355 --> 00:46:45,503
I don't know the one in the newspapers.

863
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:51,482
But before that, when we
first met at Harvard ...

864
00:46:51,763 --> 00:46:54,582
(upbeat music)

865
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:55,664
- [Nancy] Hey!

866
00:46:55,664 --> 00:46:56,854
- [Richard] She was a ball of fire,

867
00:46:56,854 --> 00:46:58,905
and there was no one like her.

868
00:46:58,905 --> 00:46:59,975

at the School Of Design, and we

00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,610
were assigned to the same project.

I couldn't believe my luck.

874
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:16,066
She called my ideas pla-beum,
I was deeply wounded.

875
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,840
And nothing mattered, except I was

876
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,290
actually getting to know her.

it's boring, put a little
lead in this pencil.

You've got a counter lever canopy here.

00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:08,282
- Obviously you've never
lived in an apartment before.

889
00:48:08,282 --> 00:48:11,230
(Richard laughing)

890
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,410
- Well if you want to get a
new partner I won't be crying.

891
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,410
- Oh no, I didn't mean that.

892
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:19,356
- I mean, it's not like
we're really gonna build

893
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:22,479
this building, we might as
well have some fun with it.

894
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:25,480
Right, okay.

895
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,520
- Okay, what did you have in mind?

896
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,020
- Okay, the sunroom.

897
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,450
- [Richard] Anyway, we
worked on that project

898
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,760
for about six weeks, killing ourselves.

899
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,800
- Yeah I know, but ...

900
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,690
- [Richard] Nancy was killing herself.

901
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,977
She had a compulsive drive to be the best.

902
00:48:38,977 --> 00:48:43,977
When push came to shove,
I was crazy about her.

903
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:49,270
But after we were married in Dallas

904
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:52,888
and later on after Allison was born,

905
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:57,172
we sort of got drawn back
into the Dillard family orbit

906
00:48:57,172 --> 00:49:00,700
and everything started to change.

907
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,333
Nancy started to change.

908
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:11,184
(Bill's mouth popping)

909
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:14,290
(dramatic music)

910
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,330
- Billy will you stop
that atrocious racket.

911
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,788
Nancy it's way past time
to put the child down.

912
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:22,697
- It was as though,
watching our kids grow up,

913
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:27,373
she was remembering her
own unhappy childhood.

914
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,810
And then of course there was Bill Junior.

915
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:33,633
- Hmm, alcohol?

916
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:36,643
- Oh alcohol, drugs, you name it.

917
00:49:38,097 --> 00:49:41,053
Bill had been a pretty
troubled guy all his life.

918
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,070
The thing about it was that after years

919
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,620
of trying to put it behind him,

920
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,640
the whole family got dragged
back through it again

921
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,610
when we all went down to that
thing in Arizona for a week.

922
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,746
- The treatment center.

923
00:49:55,746 --> 00:49:58,230
- [Richard] Bill had checked himself in.

924
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:00,890
He'd been there three or four months,

925
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:05,870
this was the final stage of
it, family week they called it.

926
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,840
It was pretty typical I guess,

927
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,492
group sessions, private sessions.

928
00:50:10,492 --> 00:50:12,721
The whole point of it was that

929
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:15,110
we should understand the
roots of Bill's problems.

930
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,360
But everything that happened there

931
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,374
was very painful for Nancy.

932
00:50:20,374 --> 00:50:23,124
(dramatic music)

933
00:50:25,034 --> 00:50:27,851
(Nancy sobbing)

934
00:50:27,851 --> 00:50:30,601
(dramatic music)

935
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:32,843
Nance.

936
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:35,527
(dramatic music)
(Nancy sobbing)

937
00:50:35,527 --> 00:50:37,495
Nancy, what's the matter?

938
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,418
Bad dream?

939
00:50:39,418 --> 00:50:40,870
- No. (sobbing)

940
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,329
- What is it?

941
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:44,098
(Nancy sobbing)

942
00:50:44,098 --> 00:50:45,208
- I don't know.

943
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,958
(dramatic music)

944
00:50:48,987 --> 00:50:49,987
I feel like,

945
00:50:51,003 --> 00:50:53,810
I don't know what I feel.

946
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:56,560
(dramatic music)

947
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:01,297
- [Guthrie] And did she ever
discuss it further with you?

948
00:51:01,297 --> 00:51:03,577
- Mm-hmm(negative).

949
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,713
But then nothing was
really the same between us.

950
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,600
She started seeing a
therapist all the time.

951
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,140
She quit her job, she just withdrew,

952
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,990
spent all her time up in her
office doing God knows what.

953
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,813
- So then you met Bridget Tyler?

954
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:28,850
- Hmm?

955
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,123
- You met Bridget Tyler?

956
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:34,310
- Yeah, but there wasn't that much

957
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:35,640
left between me and Nancy.

958
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,010
We just kept going back and forth,

959
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,494
you know how that is.

960
00:51:38,494 --> 00:51:40,930
- And then you filed for divorce.

961
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:45,283
- Yeah, then it got pretty
ugly and I don't know,

962
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,063
so I went back to her.

963
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:55,373
She's a sick woman, I just
couldn't leave her just like that

964
00:51:55,897 --> 00:51:58,297
and I didn't want to do
that to the kids anyway.

965
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,040
I told Bridget she had some
sort of a blood disease,

966
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,690
I didn't want to hurt her either.

967
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,840
- So Richard, what about these vitamins?

968
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,800
I mean it's the best
evidence the police have.

969
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,830
- She was constantly getting sick.

970
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,440
So maybe she was taking vitamins.

971
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,506
We had done it together before,

972
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:20,240
but if she was doing that, I don't know

973
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,620
how that poison got in the capsules.

974
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,707
I do know that I didn't put it there.

975
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:24,815
- So do you think that Nancy

976
00:52:24,815 --> 00:52:28,074
might have done this to herself?

977
00:52:28,074 --> 00:52:30,110
- I don't know.

978
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,583
It was like clockwork.

979
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,530
Bridget said one time, Nancy
always used to get sick

980
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:41,840
on Friday or Saturday night,

981
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,030
just when we were getting ready to go out.

982
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,628
- And you'd come running.

983
00:52:45,628 --> 00:52:47,393
- Yeah.

984
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:51,348
Richard, the girls want to say goodnight.

985
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:53,333
- I'll be right there.

986
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,243
So what happens now?

987
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,123
- Well, we'll see what
the grand jury has to say.

988
00:53:18,344 --> 00:53:20,648
- I don't want to lose my family.

989
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:21,890
- I know Richard.

990
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,760
Don't worry, I'll talk
to you tomorrow okay?

991
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,750
- Something's funny here,
I wanna know what it is.

992
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,834
- [Stoner] Yeah.

993
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:38,667
- Check out that clinic in Arizona.

994
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:40,247
- Right.

995
00:53:40,247 --> 00:53:41,261
- Oh and see if you can get your hands

996
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:42,770
on any of Nancy's therapy records.

997
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,670
If there's any skeletons
in the Dillard's closet,

998
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,385
I want to lay it at the jury's feet.

999
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:47,485
- [Stoner] You got it.

1000
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:54,950
(upbeat music)

1001
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,390
- [Reporter] The grand jury convened today

1002
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,100
to determine if Richard Lyon
will be indicted for murder

1003
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,890
in the death of his wife Nancy Lyon,

1004
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:02,120
the local well known architect.

1005
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,614
Ms. Lyon died mysteriously
from poison four months ago.

1006
00:54:04,614 --> 00:54:05,857
(dramatic music)

1007
00:54:05,857 --> 00:54:06,690
The grand jury ...

1008
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,440
(dramatic music)

1009
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,999
- Oh hello Richard, tell
me this is the last of it.

1010
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:21,090
- It is, I never knew
Nancy had so much stuff.

1011
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,110
I cleaned out the office,

1012
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,250
she even had things stashed in the attic.

1013
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,000
Have you heard anything from Bridget?

1014
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,433
- No, she's probably
on the stand right now.

1015
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,710
Look Richard I know
this is nerve wracking,

1016
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,420
why don't you go home, relax.

1017
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,480
- Yeah I think I'm gonna do that.

1018
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,790
Call me if you hear anything.

1019
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,419
- [Lawyer] Okay.

1020
00:54:37,419 --> 00:54:40,002
(horn honking)

1021
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,460
- [Clerk] Do you solemnly
swear that you will not

1022
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,228
divulge either by word or sign,

1023
00:54:47,228 --> 00:54:49,795
any matter about which
you may be interrogated

1024
00:54:49,795 --> 00:54:53,627
and will keep secret all
proceedings of this grand jury.?

1025
00:54:53,627 --> 00:54:56,100
And that you will make truthful
answers to all questions

1026
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,244
asked of you by this grand
jury, so help you God?

1027
00:54:59,244 --> 00:55:00,660
- I do.

1028
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,153
- [Clerk] Please be seated.

1029
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,140
- [Jerri] Ms. Tyler, did you know

1030
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:18,203
the value of this ring,
which Mr. Lyon gave you?

1031
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,521
- I think it was appraised
at around $5,000.

1032
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:23,348
- And at the time he gave you the ring,

1033
00:55:23,348 --> 00:55:26,394
you and Richard Lyon were just friends?

1034
00:55:26,394 --> 00:55:29,820
- Yes, I'd say that we
were friends always.

1035
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,808
- And it evolved into an
intimate relationship.

1036
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:34,370
- Yes.

1037
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:35,732
- So he files for divorce.

1038
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,833
- Well yes.

1039
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:40,651
- [Jerri] Then he want to go
home to his wife and children.

1040
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:42,561
- Yes.

1041
00:55:42,561 --> 00:55:47,305
- Did you ever give Richard
Lyon any type of ultimatum?

1042
00:55:47,305 --> 00:55:49,580
- No, I didn't.

1043
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:53,497
- Did you say you were tired
or fed up with the situation?

1044
00:55:53,497 --> 00:55:58,497
- Yes I did, I said,
"Either get divorced or not.

1045
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,904
"I don't want to just date you,

1046
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:03,067
"I want a real relationship."

1047
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,530
- This is a letter of intent

1048
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,059
to vacate the apartment
signed by Richard Lyon?

1049
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:14,223
- Yes ma'am.

1050
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,081
- What is your job Mr. Carter?

1051
00:56:18,081 --> 00:56:22,760
- We do make readys, clean up, paint.

1052
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,300
- Now what sir do you remember,

1053
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,419
had been left at that apartment?

1054
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:31,208
- Well I find a plastic
bag full of empty capsules.

1055
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:36,208
Large clear capsules that come
apart you know, two pieces.

1056
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:42,419
- Now do these look familiar to you?

1057
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:45,575
- Yes ma'am, that's like what
we found at the apartment.

1058
00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:47,909
Except empty.

1059
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:52,191
- We have Mr. Lyon's
mistress pressuring him,

1060
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:55,950
we have him ordering poisons, we have him

1061
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:59,759
with empty gelatin capsules,
and when that doesn't work,

1062
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:04,759
Richard Lyon ordered something
far more lethal, arsenic.

1063
00:57:05,372 --> 00:57:08,039
(ominous music)

1064
00:57:16,221 --> 00:57:18,470
(machine beeping)
(Nancy gasping)

1065
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,916
(dramatic music)

1066
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:24,583
(reporters yelling at once)

1067
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:29,800
- We understand your client has been

1068
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,733
arrested for the murder of
his wife, can you comment?

1069
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:32,770
- Well I'll tell you this,

1070
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:34,966
there's a lot of deep
dark secrets in this case.

1071
00:57:34,966 --> 00:57:37,570
My investigators and I
feel that there's at least

1072
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,190
two other people with better motives

1073
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,493
for murdering Nancy Lyon.

1074
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,080
For the police to overlook this,

1075
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,490
well it makes you wonder.

1076
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,075
That's all I'm gonna say.

1077
00:57:46,075 --> 00:57:48,166
- [Reporter] And that
was an earlier interview

1078
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:50,192
with Richard's Lyon's attorney.

1079
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:51,025
(phone beeping)

1080
00:57:51,025 --> 00:57:51,858
- [Reporter] Another roadside crash leaves

1081
00:57:51,858 --> 00:57:52,990
three police officers wounded

1082
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:56,080
when squad cars were ambushed
along Riverview Road.

1083
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,131
- [Detective] Homicide, Norton.

1084
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:58,790
- Yes is Detective Ortega there please?

1085
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,863
- [Detective] May I say who's calling?

1086
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:03,766
- Just say it's about
the Nancy Lyons case.

1087
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:05,740
- [Detective] Hang on.

1088
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,453
Ortega.

1089
00:58:10,894 --> 00:58:12,179
- Ortega.

1090
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:15,280
- [Dr. Harper] Detective
this is Dr. Ruth Harper,

1091
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,866
I'm Nancy Lyon's therapist.

1092
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:18,721
- Yes ma'am.

1093
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:22,740
- I want to protect my client

1094
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,873
and her confidentiality, but ...

1095
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,993
- Yes.

1096
00:58:26,993 --> 00:58:28,350
- [ Dr. Harper] Well I've
been watching the news

1097
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:30,670
and I'm afraid there's some things

1098
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,143
that are gonna come out now.

1099
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:37,346
- [Inmate] Yeah, get out of here.

1100
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:40,596
(prisoners chattering)

1101
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,460
- This is a nightmare, when
can you get me out of here.

1102
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,690
- There's a bond hearing scheduled

1103
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,040
first thing Monday morning.

1104
00:58:55,883 --> 00:58:56,840
- Thank God.

1105
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,135
- - [Richard], Stoner's done some digging.

1106
00:59:00,135 --> 00:59:03,424
I think I'm beginning
to get a picture here.

1107
00:59:03,424 --> 00:59:05,243
- What do you mean?

1108
00:59:05,243 --> 00:59:08,224
- I found some pretty
incriminating documents

1109
00:59:08,224 --> 00:59:11,350
in Nancy's therapy sessions.

1110
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:15,491
Richard, Richard listen to me.

1111
00:59:15,491 --> 00:59:17,663
You knew about this didn't you?

1112
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,367
If Bill and Nancy were in
an incestuous relationship

1113
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:24,433
then you got to talk to me about it.

1114
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,370
- [Jerri] Mr. Dillard, the state of Texas

1115
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,720
doesn't have reciprocal discovery.

1116
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,420
Now that means I don't know what Guthrie's

1117
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,420
gonna throw at me at the trial.

1118
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,796
Now I hate coming around
here with my hat in my hands,

1119
00:59:39,796 --> 00:59:41,750
but y'all put me in a bind.

1120
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,783
- It's about a couple
of kids playing doctor.

1121
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:48,418
- [Teri] How old were
you when it occurred?

1122
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,069
- I don't know.

1123
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:55,430
13, I guess.

1124
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:57,132
- Was there intercourse?

1125
00:59:57,132 --> 01:00:02,132
- No, we were just starved for affection.

1126
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,210
- [Jerri] Did Richard know?

1127
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,730
- We all talked about it in Arizona

1128
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,537
to help Bill out of a tough time.

1129
01:00:09,537 --> 01:00:12,720
Well Richard is just bringing
this up to fan the flames.

1130
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,396
This has nothing to do with the trial.

1131
01:00:14,396 --> 01:00:17,343
- Well sir, I wouldn't be so sure.

1132
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,590
- Well, what can we do?

1133
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,463
- Well how do you feel about
taking a lie detector test?

1134
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,570
(horn honking)

1135
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:32,960
- The courts will reduce the two million

1136
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,061
dollar bond to $50,000
when Mr. Lyon surrenders

1137
01:00:35,061 --> 01:00:39,140
his passport and is fitted
with an electronic monitor.

1138
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,790
- Mr. Lyon has his passport
right here Your Honor.

1139
01:00:46,368 --> 01:00:47,461
- [Bill] Do you think these things work.

1140
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:51,610
- [Ortega] I've seen liars
pass 'em and honest men fail.

1141
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,643
- [Bill] Well is there a way to beat 'em?

1142
01:00:53,643 --> 01:00:54,804
- [Ortega] Can't tell you that.

1143
01:00:54,804 --> 01:00:57,030
- Did Richard take one?

1144
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,361
- I can't discuss that.

1145
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:01,111
(dramatic music)

1146
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,140
- [Tech] Do you intend to answer

1147
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,803
all of these questions truthfully?

1148
01:01:16,803 --> 01:01:17,871
- [Bill] Yes.

1149
01:01:17,871 --> 01:01:19,010
(dramatic music)

1150
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,677
- [Tech] Do you now live
in the state of Texas?

1151
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,876
- Yes.

1152
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:23,138
(dramatic music)

1153
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,656
- [Tech] Are you William Dillard, Jr?

1154
01:01:25,656 --> 01:01:27,041
- Yes.

1155
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,428
(dramatic music)

1156
01:01:28,428 --> 01:01:29,585
(officers chattering)

1157
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:30,474
- Detective Hernandez said
that you ordered this?

1158
01:01:30,474 --> 01:01:31,375
- [Lady] No.

1159
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:34,125
(dramatic music)

1160
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:39,953
- [Ortega] Ms. Dillard.

1161
01:01:39,953 --> 01:01:41,480
- Mr. Ortega.

1162
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,040
I'd like to tell you
how very pleased we are

1163
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,308
with the way you've
handled this investigation.

1164
01:01:46,308 --> 01:01:48,589
- Well thank you very much Mrs. Dillard.

1165
01:01:48,589 --> 01:01:50,971
What's on your mind ma'am?

1166
01:01:50,971 --> 01:01:55,971
- I wanted to talk to
you about our son Bill.

1167
01:01:56,743 --> 01:02:00,640
He's had an especially
hard time of it lately

1168
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,732
and now with this lie detector test.

1169
01:02:03,732 --> 01:02:05,593
- Well I understand, it's just something

1170
01:02:05,593 --> 01:02:07,840
we have to do to prepare for the trial.

1171
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,313
- I know, I understand and so does Bill.

1172
01:02:10,313 --> 01:02:12,788
I just want to remind you of something

1173
01:02:12,788 --> 01:02:16,203
that may have gotten lost in all of this.

1174
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:22,823
Mr. Ortega, our son has
turned his whole life around.

1175
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:27,440
He just tore himself apart in Arizona

1176
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,410
and he also made all of us

1177
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,783
take a good hard look at ourselves.

1178
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:37,770
So when Nancy went into a
tailspin after Richard left her,

1179
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,390
it was to Bill she turned.

1180
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:44,057
He was the best friend
she had in the world.

1181
01:02:44,057 --> 01:02:46,785
Nancy did not go into therapy

1182
01:02:46,785 --> 01:02:50,870
because of some deep dark family secret.

1183
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:52,610
She went there because Richard

1184
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,528
left the children and
her for another woman.

1185
01:02:54,528 --> 01:02:56,278
- I understand, I do.

1186
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:01,293
- I know you do, I only
wanted you to remember it.

1187
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:07,930
You see, Bill would never say
any of these things himself.

1188
01:03:08,473 --> 01:03:13,423
That's, that's the kind of man he is now.

1189
01:03:13,423 --> 01:03:16,890
(phone ringing)

1190
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,743
That's really all I wanted to say.

1191
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,893
Forgive me Mr. Ortega.

1192
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:27,025
- There's nothing to
forgive you for ma'am.

1193
01:03:27,025 --> 01:03:28,025
- Thank you.

1194
01:03:28,988 --> 01:03:31,655
(phone ringing)

1195
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,590
- Richard, Richard look at this.

1196
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:37,000
This look familiar?

1197
01:03:39,156 --> 01:03:41,244
- [Richard] The garden
sprayer, for killing ants.

1198
01:03:41,244 --> 01:03:44,588
- Is this where you
thought to use the arsenic?

1199
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,463
- [Richard] One of my many
attempts at invention.

1200
01:03:46,463 --> 01:03:48,822
- Yeah, that's right.

1201
01:03:48,822 --> 01:03:51,810
One of yours and Nancy's inventions.

1202
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,899
This is her handwriting right here.

1203
01:03:53,899 --> 01:03:56,580
- Yeah.

1204
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,980
- That puts the arsenic right
back into Nancy's hands.

1205
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,995
Oh, and listen to this.

1206
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:04,663
This is what we found in one of her notes.

1207
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:08,336
"Bill violated me for several years.

1208
01:04:08,336 --> 01:04:11,717
"Dad said nothing when he discovered this.

1209
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:15,747
"Bill was sent away, I was
repaired and almost forgotten.

1210
01:04:15,747 --> 01:04:18,637
"Richard tried to help
me, tried to save me

1211
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:22,137
"with his sincere heart
and unending patience."

1212
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,534
(ominous music)

1213
01:04:32,165 --> 01:04:35,550
(phone ringing)

1214
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,580
- Ortega.

1215
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,878
- I've got Bill Dillard Junior's results.

1216
01:04:38,878 --> 01:04:41,459
- Well did he get a passing grade.

1217
01:04:41,459 --> 01:04:43,275
- Well professionally speaking,

1218
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:45,105
the results are inconclusive.

1219
01:04:45,105 --> 01:04:48,340
- Well, that's par for
the course on this one.

1220
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,076
Thanks much.

1221
01:04:50,076 --> 01:04:53,311
- Do not be fooled ladies and gentlemen,

1222
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:56,840
don't be misled by the smoke screens

1223
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,653
and the side issues of this case.

1224
01:04:58,653 --> 01:05:02,343
If you look a the facts of this case,

1225
01:05:02,343 --> 01:05:05,271
about the life insurance
money Richard Lyon

1226
01:05:05,271 --> 01:05:08,010
thought he was going to get,

1227
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:10,330
about the first poison he ordered,

1228
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:14,060
and the arsenic that
finally killed Nancy Lyon.

1229
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,311
If you add it all up,
you will find that leads

1230
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:19,619
a clear trail of damning
evidence from Nancy Lyon's

1231
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:24,619
calculated murder to her
discontented husband Richard.

1232
01:05:26,168 --> 01:05:28,353
Everything else is irrelevant.

1233
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,834
- First of all ladies and gentlemen,

1234
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,610
we all know that more often than not,

1235
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:45,090
life is not so simple as a
clear, well-marked trail.

1236
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:47,220
Now as the prosecution points out,

1237
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:51,831
this all began with a few
classic elements of murder,

1238
01:05:51,831 --> 01:05:55,160
a poisoned wife, an estranged husband

1239
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,550
who appeared to have motive.

1240
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,376
Now the prosecution will contend.

1241
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:03,952
That presumed motive is
enough to convict my client.

1242
01:06:03,952 --> 01:06:08,952
Motive is not enough,
this is not a clear trail.

1243
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,480
This trail is deeply rutted and cluttered

1244
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,333
with all kinds of facts.

1245
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,020
- [Bailiff] Do you
swear to tell the truth,

1246
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,120
the whole, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

1247
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,390
- [Ms. Chandler] Yes I do.

1248
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,783
- [Bailiff] Please be seated.

1249
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:33,330
- You have pent a lot of
time in the Lyon's household

1250
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:35,340
didn't you Ms. Chandler?

1251
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:39,030
- [Ms. Chandler] Yes, taking
care of Allison and Anna.

1252
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,342
- You cared for them a lot didn't you?

1253
01:06:41,342 --> 01:06:44,386
I mean you even had a picture
of them in your own home?

1254
01:06:44,386 --> 01:06:47,270
- Yes, in my guest room.

1255
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,419
- Now did Richard seem
to be a good father?

1256
01:06:49,419 --> 01:06:51,770
Did he take good care of them?

1257
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:54,103
- [Ms. Chandler] Absolutely.

1258
01:06:55,164 --> 01:06:58,140
- Ms. Chandler, after Richard left,

1259
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,874
you had occasion to be
concerned about Nancy?

1260
01:07:00,874 --> 01:07:04,380
- Well, I found her crying all the time.

1261
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:07,200
I couldn't help but be concerned.

1262
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,080
You go in in the morning
and someone's crying

1263
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,230
and you leave at night.

1264
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,220
- And wasn't there a
time when you discussed

1265
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:16,007
with your husband whether
Nancy might be suicidal?

1266
01:07:16,007 --> 01:07:20,940
- Yes, and I asked Nancy and she said

1267
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,490
she was not thinking of suicide.

1268
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:24,720
- [Lawyer] But you were concerned enough

1269
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,640
to talk to your husband about it, correct?

1270
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,833
- I was concerned about her crying.

1271
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:32,053
I just knew she was in tears all the time.

1272
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:36,770
- Nothing further at this time.

1273
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:39,640
- Ms. Chandler, Nancy
Lyon asked you to witness

1274
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,781
her signature on a document, did she not?

1275
01:07:41,781 --> 01:07:43,119
- Yes.

1276
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,897
- [Jerri] And what was she signing?

1277
01:07:44,897 --> 01:07:47,966
- Well she changed her
life insurance beneficiary

1278
01:07:47,966 --> 01:07:50,310
from Richard to the kids.

1279
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:51,510
- Did Richard Lyon know?

1280
01:07:56,530 --> 01:08:00,717
- Well after Nancy died I
mentioned it, and he said,

1281
01:08:00,717 --> 01:08:04,027
"If Nancy was going to do
that, she would have told me."

1282
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:05,703
- Thank you.

1283
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,050
- [Guthrie] And Bill Junior was sent away

1284
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:15,500
to school in Dublin, New Hampshire.

1285
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,450
Why was he sent there?

1286
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:19,357
- Bill had a few problem.

1287
01:08:19,357 --> 01:08:22,343
One of them was Dyslexia,
you know a reading problem.

1288
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:25,130
- And that's why he was sent away.

1289
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:26,430
- [Bill] Yes.

1290
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:28,331
- What other problems
did he have Mr. Dillard?

1291
01:08:28,331 --> 01:08:29,940
- I.

1292
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:33,200
- Objection, what is the
relevance of these questions?

1293
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,140
- I'll establish relevance Your Honor.

1294
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,251
- Objection overruled.

1295
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:40,166
- Mr. Dillard, when did you first discover

1296
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:43,500
the incestuous relationship
between your son and daughter?

1297
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,370
- I wouldn't exactly call it that.

1298
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:46,280
- What would you call it?

1299
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,010
- They were playing doctor.

1300
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:52,230
- Doctor, and how old
were they at the time?

1301
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:55,210
- Well I don't recall, I suppose 12, 13.

1302
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,920
One was 13, 15, something.

1303
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,770
- Mr. Dillard, isn't it a fact the way

1304
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,050
you discovered this
relationship is when Nancy

1305
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:05,810
experienced some bleeding
and came to her mother?

1306
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,760
- That was not my understanding at all.

1307
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,440
- I take to the defense,
exhibit number three

1308
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,515
from Nancy's personal notes,

1309
01:09:13,515 --> 01:09:18,515
where she says, "Dad said
nothing when he discovered this.

1310
01:09:18,887 --> 01:09:23,465
"Bill was sent away, I was
repaired and all was forgotten."

1311
01:09:23,465 --> 01:09:25,633
Is this what Nancy says in her note?

1312
01:09:26,578 --> 01:09:28,180
- That's what it says here.

1313
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:30,284
- [Guthrie] Is this Nancy's handwriting?

1314
01:09:30,284 --> 01:09:32,040
- I think so.

1315
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,800
- Thank you Mr. Dillard.

1316
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,750
Let's jump forward for a minute
and explore something else.

1317
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:40,570
Bill developed a cocaine
problem didn't here?

1318
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:43,368
- Alcohol and drugs, but
not cocaine specifically.

1319
01:09:43,368 --> 01:09:46,577
Bill was an alcoholic, that's what he is.

1320
01:09:46,577 --> 01:09:49,600
- Mr. Dillard, isn't it a fact that Bill

1321
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,590
went into the hospital with an alcohol

1322
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:53,440
and cocaine abuse problem?

1323
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,654
- He was admitted to a clinic,
who treated him very well.

1324
01:09:56,654 --> 01:09:58,790
Look, I'm proud of my son.

1325
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:59,842
He's been through a tough time.

1326
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:01,824
- And during the time that he was there,

1327
01:10:01,824 --> 01:10:04,415
the whole family went to the clinic.

1328
01:10:04,415 --> 01:10:07,200
- [Bill] Yes, there were family meetings.

1329
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,680
- [Guthrie] And during
some of these sessions,

1330
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,133
isn't it true that Nancy brought up

1331
01:10:10,133 --> 01:10:12,586
the incestuous relationship?

1332
01:10:12,586 --> 01:10:14,760
- [Bill] I don't remember
who brought it up,

1333
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:15,873
it was a long time ago.

1334
01:10:15,873 --> 01:10:17,830
It's no big deal.

1335
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:20,980
- No big deal, no big deal.

1336
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,240
Do you recall just putting
your hands behind your head,

1337
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,250
laying back in a chair,
and saying, "No big deal?"

1338
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,440
- No I don't recall that.

1339
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,898
- No big deal.

1340
01:10:27,898 --> 01:10:29,390
That pretty much summarizes

1341
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:31,046
your whole view of the thing
doesn't it Mr. Dillard?

1342
01:10:31,046 --> 01:10:33,262
- Asked and answered.

1343
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,960
- Sustained.

1344
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,780
- Are you aware of the fact that Nancy,

1345
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,788
after those meetings sought
counseling for incest?

1346
01:10:38,788 --> 01:10:40,860
- I was not aware of that.

1347
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,593
- [Guthrie] Well then let me
show you exhibit number four.

1348
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,313
Is this Nancy's handwriting?

1349
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:49,990
- I think so.

1350
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,089
- Would you please read it
for the members of the court.

1351
01:10:52,089 --> 01:10:54,913
Please, what Nancy wrote.

1352
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,400
- [Judge] You need time to read it over?

1353
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,253
Take your time.

1354
01:11:05,897 --> 01:11:08,023
- "Fear of Bill and what his desires are.

1355
01:11:09,535 --> 01:11:14,037
"Sex, sick sex, incestuous issues with me,

1356
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:16,987
"my girls, my fear of reprisal."

1357
01:11:21,496 --> 01:11:23,885
- [Guthrie] Thank you Mr. Dillard.

1358
01:11:23,885 --> 01:11:27,100
No further questions.

1359
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:31,699
- Mr. Dillard, we have a letter
submitted as evidence here,

1360
01:11:31,699 --> 01:11:36,306
do you recognize the
signature on this exhibit?

1361
01:11:36,306 --> 01:11:39,040
- Yes, it's Nancy's.

1362
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,253
- And this is a letter of authorization

1363
01:11:43,253 --> 01:11:48,253
from Nancy for you or Mrs. Dillard or Bill

1364
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,950
or Mary Helen to take the
children for emergency treatment.

1365
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,420
- Yes.

1366
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:54,680
- Any of the four of you?

1367
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,477
- Yes, any of the four of us.

1368
01:11:56,477 --> 01:11:57,477
- Thank you.

1369
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:04,650
- Mr. Ortega, at this time,

1370
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,430
did the Dillard's
discuss with you the fact

1371
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:09,520
that Bill Junior had a severe
alcohol and cocaine problem?

1372
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,353
- No sir.

1373
01:12:10,353 --> 01:12:11,430
- Did they discuss with you the fact

1374
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,078
that Bill Junior has an incestuous
relationship with Nancy?

1375
01:12:14,078 --> 01:12:15,260
- No sir.

1376
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,270
- Did you ever see any of Nancy's writings

1377
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:19,010
where she discusses her relationship

1378
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:21,483
with Bill Junior and other
members of the family?

1379
01:12:21,483 --> 01:12:25,420
- No sir, I never saw anything like that.

1380
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,400
- [Guthrie] Were you aware of the fact

1381
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,590
that Bill Junior was desperate for money?

1382
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:29,423
- [Ortega] No sir.

1383
01:12:29,423 --> 01:12:31,686
- Did you ever subpoena
any of his bank records,

1384
01:12:31,686 --> 01:12:34,070
see if there were any
judgements against him?

1385
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:35,100
- No sir.

1386
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,020
- You did no investigation

1387
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,090
into Bill Dillard Juniors background.

1388
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:39,985
- [Ortega] No sir.

1389
01:12:39,985 --> 01:12:42,495
- [Guthrie] Did you ever
treat anyone except my client

1390
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:47,040
as a serious suspect in your
investigation of this case?

1391
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,370
- No sir.

1392
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:52,504
- Mr. Ortega, the wine
bottle that you recovered

1393
01:12:52,504 --> 01:12:54,810
from the trunk of a nanny's car,

1394
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:56,900
did you check it for fingerprints?

1395
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,360
- I never checked it for fingerprints.

1396
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,470
- Did you testify to the grand jury

1397
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:02,310
that the preliminary results indicated

1398
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,540
that Nancy Lyon had been receiving arsenic

1399
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:07,106
over a month or two period
just before her death?

1400
01:13:07,106 --> 01:13:08,910
- That is correct sir.

1401
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:11,720
- And during this period,
none of the purchases made

1402
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,593
by Richard Lyon contained
any arsenic whatsoever.

1403
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:17,460
- That is correct sir.

1404
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:22,110
- Detective, have you ever investigated

1405
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,765
any arsenic cases prior to this one?

1406
01:13:24,765 --> 01:13:27,410
- No sir.

1407
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:31,230
- I see detective, we
have no further questions

1408
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:32,630
for this witness Your Honor.

1409
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,223
(bell ringing)

1410
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:45,782
(horn honking)

1411
01:13:45,782 --> 01:13:48,782
(people chattering)

1412
01:13:50,647 --> 01:13:54,314
(reporters yelling at once)

1413
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:07,580
- [Bailiff] Do you
swear to tell the truth,

1414
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,934
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth,

1415
01:14:08,934 --> 01:14:10,881
so help you God?

1416
01:14:10,881 --> 01:14:12,140
- [Mr. Mathers] Yes.

1417
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,990
- [Bailiff] Please be seated.

1418
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:17,020
- Mr. Mathers you are a
handwriting expert, are you not?

1419
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,242
- Yes I am a document examiner.

1420
01:14:19,242 --> 01:14:22,280
- [Guthrie] And how many
examinations do you do a year?

1421
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,227
- [Mr. Mathers] Approximately 6,000.

1422
01:14:24,227 --> 01:14:26,940
- [Guthrie] And for whom do
you do these examinations?

1423
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,820
- I do them for the police department

1424
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,554
and the district attorney's office.

1425
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:32,740
- At my request, do you examine

1426
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,400
certain exhibits for the defense?

1427
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,450
- Yes.

1428
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:37,117
- Now Mr. Mathers, in your opinion,

1429
01:14:37,117 --> 01:14:41,700
who wrote exhibits three
and four on incest?

1430
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,228
- It is my conclusion that Nancy Lyon

1431
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,225
wrote all these documents.

1432
01:14:45,225 --> 01:14:48,220
- [Guthrie] Also, I've asked you

1433
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,203
to look at this document here.

1434
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:56,710
Do you identify this as
Nancy Lyon's signature?

1435
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:57,881
- Yes.

1436
01:14:57,881 --> 01:14:59,190
- [Guthrie] Your Honor, I'd like

1437
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:00,950
to enter this into evidence.

1438
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:03,350
An invoice from AMM Chemical.

1439
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:05,270
- May we see that document Your Honor?

1440
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,173
- [Guthrie] I'd be happy to
share this with the state.

1441
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,980
- We may have just lost our case.

1442
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,530
- Ms. Simms, do you have
questions of this witness?

1443
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,293
- Yes Your Honor.

1444
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:35,308
Mr. Mathers, the samples
you compared of Mrs. Lyon's

1445
01:15:35,308 --> 01:15:38,559
handwriting to the so-called incest notes,

1446
01:15:38,559 --> 01:15:41,480
did you get these from family and friends

1447
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:45,210
or did Mr. Guthrie provide
them all through his client?

1448
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:46,900
- Mr. Guthrie provided them.

1449
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,220
- Did you compare these
writings to any other writings?

1450
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,990
Say for example, did you examine

1451
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:54,190
any of Richard Lyon's known handwriting?

1452
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:56,594
- No.

1453
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:59,733
- No further questions Your Honor.

1454
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,980
- [Mr. Guthrie] In any of your many years

1455
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,733
as a psychiatrist, have you
specialized in cases of incest.

1456
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:07,500
- Yes.

1457
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,390
- [Mr. Guthrie] How many cases

1458
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:09,930
would you say that you've treated?

1459
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,710
- Oh, several hundred.

1460
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:13,190
- And in your opinion doctor,

1461
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:15,380
after reading Nancy Lyon's notes,

1462
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:16,760
the ones entered into evidence,

1463
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,991
would you describe her
as a victim of incest.

1464
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,560
- [Doctor] Absolutely, what we call

1465
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,020
an adult incest survivor.

1466
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:26,740
- Now, do you recall in the notes,

1467
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,205
this references to control.

1468
01:16:28,205 --> 01:16:31,397
When I'm not in control I get angry.

1469
01:16:31,397 --> 01:16:34,690
Now why does she keep
referring to control?

1470
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:36,547
- She has to be in control.

1471
01:16:36,547 --> 01:16:38,999
She didn't have power
and control as a child

1472
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:41,018
during the incestuous relationship,

1473
01:16:41,018 --> 01:16:43,345
so as an adult if she felt out of control,

1474
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:46,669
then it was frustrating,
it was irritating.

1475
01:16:46,669 --> 01:16:50,005
- Now would you say that
Nancy would call Richard

1476
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:52,563
if they were separated
and say she was sick?

1477
01:16:52,563 --> 01:16:54,153
- Certainly, I think this could

1478
01:16:54,153 --> 01:16:56,280
have been typical of the situation.

1479
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,995
It was her way of control,
was getting him home.

1480
01:16:58,995 --> 01:17:03,090
- So Doctor, in your
opinion do you think that

1481
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:06,391
Nancy Lyon would ingest arsenic herself?

1482
01:17:06,391 --> 01:17:08,044
- It's my opinion that Richard had given

1483
01:17:08,044 --> 01:17:10,313
her something she'd never had before.

1484
01:17:10,313 --> 01:17:12,730
She did feel love, and she'd go to

1485
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,549
any length not to lose it.

1486
01:17:14,549 --> 01:17:17,045
So I think she could have
deliberately ingested the arsenic

1487
01:17:17,045 --> 01:17:19,522
in small amounts in an attempt

1488
01:17:19,522 --> 01:17:23,399
to regain her husband's attention.

1489
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:26,462
- Thank you, no further questions.

1490
01:17:26,462 --> 01:17:30,129
(people in court murmuring)

1491
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,850
Your Honor may we pause for a moment

1492
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,690
to swear in five new witness.

1493
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:37,603
- [Judge] If the state has no objections.

1494
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:40,243
- No objection.

1495
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,933
Find out who the hell these guys are.

1496
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:52,730
What have you got for me?

1497
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:56,038
- Well I found out these
guys work at AMM Chemicals.

1498
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:59,359
Guthrie's men showed up and
slapped them all with subpoenas.

1499
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:01,220
- What do you think?

1500
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,666
- They found something, that's for sure.

1501
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:04,576
We might have an ace though.

1502
01:18:04,576 --> 01:18:05,640
- What?

1503
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,101
- One subpoena went unserved.

1504
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:09,564
A boss, a Mr. Leonard Potter.

1505
01:18:09,564 --> 01:18:11,633
- Okay you call out the Texas Rangers

1506
01:18:11,633 --> 01:18:13,475
if you have to, find the guy.

1507
01:18:13,475 --> 01:18:15,880
And about that receipt for arsenic,

1508
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,875
I think we need our
own handwriting expert.

1509
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,388
- You got it boss.

1510
01:18:19,388 --> 01:18:22,221
(engines running)

1511
01:18:40,228 --> 01:18:41,228
- Thank you.

1512
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:46,533
- Mr. Potter, Mr. Leonard Potter?

1513
01:18:46,533 --> 01:18:47,366
- [Leonard] Yeah.

1514
01:18:47,366 --> 01:18:49,300
- My name is Jerri Sims,
I'm with the DA's office.

1515
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,820
Can we chat?

1516
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,840
- Are you the one that
practically shut my plane down

1517
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,970
looking for a typewriter?

1518
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,630
- No, a typewriter?

1519
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,130
- Yeah, but you won't find it though,

1520
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:58,150
I do everything by hand.

1521
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,203
- Have you heard of Nancy Lyon?

1522
01:18:59,203 --> 01:19:00,510
- It's in all the papers.

1523
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:02,010
- Then why would Richard Lyon's attorney

1524
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:03,249
want to talk to your men?

1525
01:19:03,249 --> 01:19:05,170
- Last fall a woman
called me about a poison,

1526
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:07,370
she wanted a formula that
would kill fire ants.

1527
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:09,863
I recommended arsenic.

1528
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,893
- The defense calls Leonard
Potter to the stand.

1529
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:24,730
Mr. Potter how are you employed?

1530
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:27,090
- I'm president of AMM Chemicals.

1531
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:30,030
- Let me direct your attention
sir, back to last year.

1532
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:32,240
And I'll ask if you recall
receiving a phone call

1533
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,220
from a female about fire ant poison.

1534
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,312
- Yes, she said she had a bad infestation

1535
01:19:36,312 --> 01:19:38,413
of ants and needed a poison.

1536
01:19:38,413 --> 01:19:40,960
- And this woman said
that she and her husband

1537
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,560
were working on an idea where they would

1538
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,526
directly inject the poison into
the ground, is that correct?

1539
01:19:45,526 --> 01:19:47,020
- That's correct.

1540
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,160
- What did you suggest?

1541
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,841
- Arsenic trioxide.

1542
01:19:49,841 --> 01:19:53,220
But I told her you have
to watch what you use it,

1543
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,465
because you could be creating
a hazard for yourself.

1544
01:19:55,465 --> 01:19:59,178
- And in this conversation with the woman,

1545
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:02,050
did she identify herself as Nancy Lyon?

1546
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:05,667
- She may have mentioned a
name, but I've forgotten that.

1547
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,350
But I do remember she said she lived

1548
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:09,220
over by the SMU area.

1549
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:12,092
- Would you please read the
signature on the bottom here?

1550
01:20:12,092 --> 01:20:14,210
- Nancy Lyon.

1551
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:16,252
- [Guthrie] And this is
your company, AMM Chemical.

1552
01:20:16,252 --> 01:20:20,852
- It's typed, he said he
didn't have a typewriter.

1553
01:20:20,852 --> 01:20:23,195
- [Leonard] Yeah I
offered to mail it to her.

1554
01:20:23,195 --> 01:20:24,990
- Why would Guthrie bring him in?

1555
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,183
- I don't know.

1556
01:20:26,183 --> 01:20:28,040
- [Guthrie] And when she
picked up the formulation.

1557
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,810
- He doesn't know.

1558
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:32,050
- I keep my desk out of the line of sight.

1559
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:33,592
Everybody wants to talk to the boss.

1560
01:20:33,592 --> 01:20:35,950
I was busy when she came in,

1561
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,963
so I gave the formulation to an employee,

1562
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:39,890
he took it up front to her.

1563
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:41,580
- Thank you Mr. Potter.

1564
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:42,895
We pass the witness.

1565
01:20:42,895 --> 01:20:45,194
- Mr. Potter, on this exhibit

1566
01:20:45,194 --> 01:20:48,256
that you were referring to, this is a copy

1567
01:20:48,256 --> 01:20:50,935
of one of your business
forms, is that correct?

1568
01:20:50,935 --> 01:20:52,190
- [Leonard] That's correct.

1569
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:55,150
- Now this order is typed,
when you sell something

1570
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,700
will the form look like this?

1571
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,280
- Oh no ma'am, I do everything by hand,

1572
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,571
the old fashioned way.

1573
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:03,272
They taught me to print real
pretty in engineering school.

1574
01:21:03,272 --> 01:21:05,200
I don't type.

1575
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,490
- So your orders are handwritten?

1576
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:08,323
- [Leonard] Yes.

1577
01:21:08,323 --> 01:21:09,860
- Jerri] What is this, is this

1578
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,730
something you sold to anybody?

1579
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:14,393
- No, this is just a
formulation of a recipe.

1580
01:21:14,393 --> 01:21:17,440
- Let me get this straight.

1581
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,700
The lady you spoke with,
you didn't sell anything to,

1582
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,820
you gave out a recipe?

1583
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,614
- I just gave her the formulation,

1584
01:21:23,614 --> 01:21:25,790
I don't sell arsenic trioxide.

1585
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:27,815
You got to have a special
license to do that.

1586
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:29,190
- Let me ask you again.

1587
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,030
Since your invoices are handwritten,

1588
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:34,203
this isn't one of your
invoices is it Mr. Potter.

1589
01:21:34,203 --> 01:21:37,250
- This looks like a forged document here.

1590
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:39,530
I don't know anything about it.

1591
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:42,104
- This is a copy of one
of your business forms,

1592
01:21:42,104 --> 01:21:44,391
but in your opinion, this particular

1593
01:21:44,391 --> 01:21:47,220
order itself is a forgery.

1594
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,012
- Yes.

1595
01:21:49,012 --> 01:21:50,523
- Thank you sir.

1596
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:56,185
- [Bailiff] Do you swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth,

1597
01:21:56,185 --> 01:21:57,707
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

1598
01:21:57,707 --> 01:21:58,894
- [Richard] I do.

1599
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:00,244
[Bailiff] Please be seated.

1600
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:08,439
- Richard let me ask you straight out,

1601
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:10,529
did you kill your wife?

1602
01:22:10,529 --> 01:22:12,912
- No I did not.

1603
01:22:12,912 --> 01:22:15,116
- How long were you married?

1604
01:22:15,116 --> 01:22:16,570
- Eight and a half years.

1605
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:17,803
- [Guthrie] Any children?

1606
01:22:17,803 --> 01:22:20,653
- Two little girls, Anna and Allison.

1607
01:22:20,653 --> 01:22:23,249
- We've introduced
Nancy's medical records,

1608
01:22:23,249 --> 01:22:25,591
now from the time you first met Nancy,

1609
01:22:25,591 --> 01:22:30,591
were there incidents where
she experienced nausea

1610
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:33,048
and other health related problems?

1611
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:34,530
- Yes.

1612
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:37,086
- And when you and Nancy were separated,

1613
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:40,225
would Nancy call saying that she was sick?

1614
01:22:40,225 --> 01:22:45,225
- 10 to 12 times, I would
go over to help her.

1615
01:22:45,268 --> 01:22:49,143
- Would you tell the court what this is?

1616
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:57,110
- Sure, that's an idea that Nancy and I

1617
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:58,683
had for an ant sprayer.

1618
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,866
We had a big infestation of fire ants

1619
01:23:01,866 --> 01:23:04,080
and we couldn't get rid of them.

1620
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,570
The children were getting bit a lot

1621
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:06,970
and they were terrified of bugs,

1622
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:08,790
so Nancy and I tried to figure out

1623
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:11,070
a way to distribute
the poison underground.

1624
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:12,970
- And would you tell me who's handwriting

1625
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:14,330
this is along the side here?

1626
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:15,686
- Nancy's.

1627
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:17,443
- [Guthrie] So what kind of poison

1628
01:23:17,443 --> 01:23:19,515
were you going to use in the sprayer?

1629
01:23:19,515 --> 01:23:21,860
- Nancy suggested that we use arsenic.

1630
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:24,174
- [Guthrie] So you ordered some arsenic.

1631
01:23:24,174 --> 01:23:25,359
- [Richard] Yes.

1632
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:27,570
- [Guthrie] Through the
nursery where you work?

1633
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:28,478
- [Richard] Yes.

1634
01:23:28,478 --> 01:23:30,841
- Now why order through the office?

1635
01:23:30,841 --> 01:23:33,880
- Well I thought if it worked for us,

1636
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,610
then I might can possibly introduce it

1637
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:38,100
at the nursery for similar problems.

1638
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,250
- Richard when did you
learn that the arsenic

1639
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,792
that you ordered had been delivered?

1640
01:23:42,792 --> 01:23:47,100
- Right here, in this courtroom.

1641
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:50,432
- So no arsenic was ever possessed by you?

1642
01:23:50,432 --> 01:23:52,708
- Never.

1643
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:57,380
- So this invoice from AMM Chemicals

1644
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,947
found in Nancy's papers.

1645
01:23:58,947 --> 01:24:00,200
- [Richard] Yes?

1646
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,329
- Can you explain
anything further about it?

1647
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:03,203
- No.

1648
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:06,210
- So you had no idea that Nancy

1649
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:09,170
placed an order for
arsenic from Mr. Potter?

1650
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,823
- No, I did not.

1651
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,704
- So you didn't know
anything about this invoice

1652
01:24:14,704 --> 01:24:17,536
until our investigations?

1653
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,065
- That's correct.

1654
01:24:19,065 --> 01:24:22,840
- Did Mr. Ortega asked if you would

1655
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,850
consent to have your home searched?

1656
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:26,735
- Yes, and I consented.

1657
01:24:26,735 --> 01:24:28,573
- Thank you Richard.

1658
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,800
- Mr. Lyon, when Detective Ortega told you

1659
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,835
that your wife had been
poisoned, what did you think?

1660
01:24:37,835 --> 01:24:41,029
- He said, would I be
surprised if I learned

1661
01:24:41,029 --> 01:24:43,970
that she'd been poisoned and I said yes.

1662
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:46,135
- You hadn't gone to the
doctors and asked for an autopsy

1663
01:24:46,135 --> 01:24:49,605
to be done on your wife's body
to determine how she died?

1664
01:24:49,605 --> 01:24:51,710
- I was distraught.

1665
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:54,240
I don't remember speaking
to anyone specifically.

1666
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,330
I remember Mr. Dillard handed me a request

1667
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,440
for an autopsy, which I signed.

1668
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,590
- And who did you call to
determine these findings?

1669
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:01,800
- [Richard] The funeral home.

1670
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,450
They said it was completed and I never

1671
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:06,560
contacted anyone after that.

1672
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,670
- So when Detective Ortega told you

1673
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,250
that your wife had been poisoned,

1674
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,410
did you tell him of anyone that you knew

1675
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:14,400
that might want to do your wife harm?

1676
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,610
- Not at the moment, no.

1677
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:18,240
- Did you say I have these drawings,

1678
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,640
I can show you where Nancy and I

1679
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,020
worked on this invention together?

1680
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,624
Did you volunteer that?

1681
01:25:22,624 --> 01:25:24,363
- You've obviously never had anybody

1682
01:25:24,363 --> 01:25:25,850
close to you die before.

1683
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,225
- Just answer the question.

1684
01:25:27,225 --> 01:25:31,260
- No, I did not tell him that.

1685
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,480
- Did you tell us that Nancy had arsenic,

1686
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,740
that she had ordered the stuff,

1687
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,440
that you had the documents to prove it.

1688
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,820
- I was under arrest, there was no

1689
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,505
conversation with your office.

1690
01:25:40,505 --> 01:25:42,310
- Could it be that these documents

1691
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:44,470
and papers didn't exist at the time?

1692
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:46,091
That you needed time to forge them?

1693
01:25:46,091 --> 01:25:47,180
- That's not true!

1694
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,557
- No further questions.
- Nancy made those documents.

1695
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,320
- You're a toxicologist as
well, aren't you Doctor.

1696
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,720
- [Doctor] Yes I am.

1697
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,700
- What do you think about
these theory floating around

1698
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,610
that Nancy Lyon poisoned
herself with arsenic

1699
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:06,860
to gain the attention of her husband?

1700
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:08,467
- It's a little preposterous.

1701
01:26:08,467 --> 01:26:10,211
- What do you mean?

1702
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:13,040
- Anyone who's done any kind of reading,

1703
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,010
even on an amateur basis learns

1704
01:26:15,010 --> 01:26:17,350
that it's a terrible way to die.

1705
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:19,886
It's agonizing, painful, and prolonged.

1706
01:26:19,886 --> 01:26:22,444
- Thank you Doctor.

1707
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:25,460
No further questions.

1708
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:28,510
- Dr. Frawley, are you
saying that it's impossible

1709
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:31,554
that anyone might take arsenic
to make themselves sick?

1710
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:36,554
- It's a possibility, among
hundreds of other possibilities.

1711
01:26:37,796 --> 01:26:39,183
- Thank you.

1712
01:26:40,656 --> 01:26:43,740
- Mr. Webster, you are an expert

1713
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,477
at handwriting analysis, are you not?

1714
01:26:45,477 --> 01:26:46,750
- Yes I am.

1715
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:48,740
- Upon request, you studied samples

1716
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,850
that had been put forth
as evidence in this court.

1717
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:51,940
- [Webster] Yes I did.

1718
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,920
- Could you explain
the handwriting samples

1719
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,362
you used in your analysis?

1720
01:26:55,362 --> 01:26:58,640
- I compared all of these
reported Nancy Lyon notes,

1721
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,470
not only to Mrs. Lyon's other writings

1722
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,267
but to Mr. Lyon as well.

1723
01:27:02,267 --> 01:27:03,797
- Did you find them to be similar?

1724
01:27:03,797 --> 01:27:06,090
- They have a number of handwriting

1725
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:07,610
characteristics that are very similar.

1726
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:09,576
- Did you see an invoice from AMM Chemical

1727
01:27:09,576 --> 01:27:12,600
with two words, Nancy Lyon on it?

1728
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,760
- Yes and I was unable to reach

1729
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,350
conclusion concerning this item.

1730
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:19,393
- You can't say that it's
Richard Lyon's or that it's not?

1731
01:27:19,393 --> 01:27:20,720
- That's correct.

1732
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,599
- Let me draw your attention
sir to two exhibits.

1733
01:27:22,599 --> 01:27:25,775
The first one that
says, "I feel inadequate

1734
01:27:25,775 --> 01:27:28,170
"when I have no power."

1735
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:31,812
And then goes on to say, "Fear
of Bill and his desires."

1736
01:27:31,812 --> 01:27:33,797
Who wrote that document?

1737
01:27:33,797 --> 01:27:36,138
- Some of this was written by Nancy Lyon,

1738
01:27:36,138 --> 01:27:38,320
some was written by Richard Lyon.

1739
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,330
- Would you please read the writings

1740
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:43,501
you found conclusively
to be Richard Lyon's

1741
01:27:43,501 --> 01:27:47,435
- Yes, the phrase, fear of reprisal.

1742
01:27:47,435 --> 01:27:50,967
And then at the extreme
bottom, the passage,

1743
01:27:50,967 --> 01:27:53,850
"I'm in fear of Bill and incest issues."

1744
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:55,750
- [Jerri] And the second document sir,

1745
01:27:56,676 --> 01:27:59,690
starting with, "Bill violated
me for several years.

1746
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:02,874
The issue of incest never
came up for Bill at ST.

1747
01:28:02,874 --> 01:28:06,102
"Bill was sent away,
Richard tried to save me

1748
01:28:06,102 --> 01:28:08,450
"with his sincere heart."

1749
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,280
Did you examine those?

1750
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,321
- I did, my conclusion is that

1751
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:15,153
the writer of this entire
document was Richard Lyon.

1752
01:28:15,153 --> 01:28:17,190
(courtroom murmuring)

1753
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:19,341
- Mr. Webster, will you tell us again,

1754
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:24,341
what is your specific experience
as an expert in your field?

1755
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,570
- 18 years with the FBI.

1756
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:27,675
- [Jerri] Thank you.

1757
01:28:27,675 --> 01:28:30,342
(ominous music)

1758
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:59,703
- [Richard] Some people think
that Daddy made Mommy sick.

1759
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,243
I didn't, you know that.

1760
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:10,087
But some people say I did and
if enough people believe that,

1761
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:14,720
then they'll send Daddy away.

1762
01:29:15,777 --> 01:29:17,178
- [Child] Forever?

1763
01:29:17,178 --> 01:29:20,011
- [Richard] Well, for a long time.

1764
01:29:23,012 --> 01:29:25,293
- [Child] No Daddy!

1765
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:27,290
- [Richard] But I want my girls to know,

1766
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:30,003
that I would never hurt Mommy.

1767
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:36,249
I loved her, I want you to remember that.

1768
01:29:36,249 --> 01:29:38,916
(ominous music)

1769
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,949
(gavel knocking)

1770
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:48,367
- [Judge] This court
will now come to order.

1771
01:29:48,367 --> 01:29:50,357
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1772
01:29:50,357 --> 01:29:52,379
have you reached a verdict?

1773
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:54,683
- [Jury Foreman] We have Your Honor.

1774
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:07,060
- Will the defendant please rise?

1775
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:12,060
Please state your verdict.

1776
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,500
- We find the defendant, Richard Lyon,

1777
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,495
guilty of murder in the first degree.

1778
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:19,662
(courtroom murmuring)

1779
01:30:29,194 --> 01:30:31,944
(dramatic music)

1780
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:11,588
(dramatic music)

1781
01:32:05,216 --> 01:32:08,049
