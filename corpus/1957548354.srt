in limos all day long.

You know, to hentai.

You know, it's fucking evil.

380
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,914
I just remember he kept saying,

381
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:29,255
I love you, I love you, I
just remember him saying that.

382
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:32,626
And I thought to myself, Jesus,
this man really loves me.

383
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:37,930
My head was bleeding

384
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,266
and there was blood all over.

385
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:42,902
He broke my arm.

386
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:50,243
To be perfectly honest with all of you,

387
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:51,444
I felt,

388
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,721
I believed him.

389
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:03,624
I thought, if this is love,

390
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:06,225
then I'm gonna take it.

391
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:11,431
I promised myself I
wouldn't do it again.

392
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:20,541
I'd been alone for years
and I was happy, 'cause

393
00:32:23,644 --> 00:32:25,344
I couldn't be hurt that way.

394
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:28,582

Everyone in there was bearing their soul

429
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,085
Why wouldn't you?

430
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,721
Those are my friends inside.

431
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:51,457
They're the ones recovering,
and you're gonna act like that?

432
00:34:51,558 --> 00:34:54,027
Hey, I just want you to
be with me in the moment.

433
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,461
Well you got it.

Come on.

435
00:34:58,665 --> 00:34:59,933
I kissed a furry.

You were so jealous
and you were so cute.

We're still short.

444
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:33,332
So what are we gonna do?

Fuck, I can't believe I got to do this

Who the hell put up these lights?

447
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:10,436
Your mom has that much cash.

448
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:13,607
Yeah, she's a bit of a prepper.

449
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:16,275
You know she got all
brainwashed from my dad.

450
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:23,517
Fuck, I don't know if I want to do this.

451
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,252
What are you gonna tell her?

452
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,453
I don't know.

453
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,730
I'm really sorry if I
woke you up tonight, mom.

454
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,731
No problem.

455
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:39,833
I can use the company.

456
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,536
So what is it?

457
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,171
What do you need the money for?

458
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,138
I can double up my money

459
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,606
by investing in something tonight.

460
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:47,941
No you can't.

461
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,576
Are you talking about drugs?

462
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:52,746
Yes.

No.

464
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,881
Had you finished your studies

465
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:57,117
you'd be in a big
pharmaceutical company by now.

466
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,384
That's spilled milk talk, mom,

467
00:36:58,484 --> 00:36:59,986
you know I hate spilled milk talk.

468
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:02,956
If I give you the money,
will you go back to school?

Mom?

470
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:06,126
I put in a lot for this house.

Yeah, with drug money.

472
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:10,396
So what? I earned it.

473

Yeah.

475
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:20,841
I can tell when a person is lying.

476
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:23,242
So I just stopped lying.

477
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:27,848
We want to get married.

478
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:32,018
Go on.

00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:41,628
I've been traveling the
world the past year.

You know I don't like
seeing you like this.

502
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:06,345
It's God's will.

It's not God's will mom.

want to be able to see GG?

Did you ever look to God
for help with your ordeal?

00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:35,188
And?

558
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:39,959
This guy wants to believe in God,

559
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:43,029
or he stopped believing.

560
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:46,699
Now he thinks he might go to hell.

561
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,501
If he didn't believe in God,

562
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:50,770
he wouldn't believe in hell at either.

563
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:55,308
But he had guilt.

564
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:56,943
That's all his guilt.

565
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:03,249
Just because you have
like different opinions,

566
00:43:04,951 --> 00:43:06,786
people will persecute you,

567
00:43:08,688 --> 00:43:10,590
just like in the old days.

568
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,158
Just like the crusades.

569
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:15,161
It's still like that.

570
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,031
Yeah.

571
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:20,366
Oh it's Dali.

572
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:23,903
He's my favorite.

573
00:43:24,003 --> 00:43:26,673
He has a piece called,
Woman at the Window,

574
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:29,976
and it's, the colors, it's blue,

575
00:43:30,076 --> 00:43:34,347
it's green, and it feels alive,
and it just takes you there.

576
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:35,682
I stood in front of it for an hour,

577
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:37,283
and then I came back for it again.

578
00:43:37,383 --> 00:43:39,719
I was completely obsessed,

579
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:42,922
and I would stand there and just

580
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:46,594
daydream and imagine that she'd be waiti

581
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:48,695
for lover's ship to come.

582
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:52,265
And then I thought no, that's too obviou

583
00:43:52,365 --> 00:43:53,233
What if

584
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,069
he was watching her

585
00:43:56,703 --> 00:43:59,005
the same way you're looking at a paintin

586
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:00,039
and she knew it,

587
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,576
and she would pretend
like she didn't know,

588
00:44:02,675 --> 00:44:04,978
and that's how she would hook her man.

589
00:44:05,078 --> 00:44:07,515
And then she would turn around,

590
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:09,916
and I would see her beautiful face,

591
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:15,388
and her eyes would be calm
and filled with contentment

592
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:19,192
and acceptance and bliss.

593
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,965
What do you think happens when we die?

594
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:35,208
I think when we die, that's it.

595
00:44:36,776 --> 00:44:38,945
The time that we have is what we have.

596
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:42,749
I think I'm gonna make the best of it.

597
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:46,986
Yo!

598
00:44:47,787 --> 00:44:50,190
You guys ready to do some drugs or what?

599
00:44:52,091 --> 00:44:52,792
Yeah.

600
00:44:52,892 --> 00:44:53,993
Yeah, I got it.

601
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,664
Let's go talk over there.

602
00:44:56,763 --> 00:44:57,531
Okay.

603
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:58,731
Come on.

604
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:02,001
How long know that guy for?

605
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:07,140
Not too long, actually
we just met like, tonight.

606
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,241
- Wow.
- Yeah.

607
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:09,242
Okay.

608
00:45:10,176 --> 00:45:10,843
All right.

609
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:12,212
You guys ready to do this?

610
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:13,213
Yeah.

611
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:15,616
No bullshit.

612
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:16,916
[GG] Okay.

613
00:45:17,016 --> 00:45:18,718
Here's the address, burn
it when you get there.

614
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:19,687
Listen to me.

615
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:21,487
You gotta be on this guy's level.

616
00:45:22,422 --> 00:45:23,323
What does that mean?

617
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:25,258
What does that mean, this guy?

618
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:27,727
What it means is, if he doesn't like you

619
00:45:27,827 --> 00:45:29,362
he's not gonna sell to you.

620
00:45:31,264 --> 00:45:33,833
And brother, if he doesn't trust you,

621
00:45:33,933 --> 00:45:35,368
he will fucking kill you.

622
00:45:36,936 --> 00:45:38,771
Honey, I'm sorry, earlier,

623
00:45:38,871 --> 00:45:40,940
I didn't realize who you were.

624
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:42,509
Would you mind?

625
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,443
No, it's okay.

626
00:45:43,544 --> 00:45:44,377
Just a quick?

627
00:45:44,477 --> 00:45:46,045
You're so sweet, thank you.

628
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,520
It's an honor.

629
00:45:54,387 --> 00:45:55,321
Thanks.

630
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:57,190
Wow, all right.

631
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,191
Be cool.

632
00:46:00,393 --> 00:46:01,294
What?

633
00:46:02,295 --> 00:46:03,196
What?

634
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,905
He was draped all over you.

635
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:15,308
Oh he was not.

636
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,011
Why?

637
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:20,947
Are you jealous?

638
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:29,822
Yeah.

639
00:46:43,336 --> 00:46:44,237
Give it up.

640
00:46:46,707 --> 00:46:48,174
You can have whatever you want, man.

641
00:46:48,274 --> 00:46:49,175
We're cool.

642
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:51,978
Give me your fucking suggestives.

643
00:46:52,078 --> 00:46:54,013
We don't have suggestives.

644
00:47:02,556 --> 00:47:03,456
GG.

645
00:47:04,857 --> 00:47:05,958
GG.

646
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:09,929
Crazy bitch.

647
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:25,311
What the fuck is wrong with you?

648
00:47:44,263 --> 00:47:45,632
Okay.

649
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:46,899
Now just stay in the car please?

650
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:48,769
Don't open the doors for anybody, okay?

651
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:50,169
Nobody.

652
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:51,605
Okay.

653
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:52,639
What are you doing?

654
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,707
I'm coming with you.

655
00:47:53,807 --> 00:47:55,108
No!

656
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:58,478
You don't trust me after everything.

657
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:00,880
No, yes, no, no.

658
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,651
Listen, I appreciate you, but you're so-

659
00:48:04,752 --> 00:48:06,352
- So, so what?

660
00:48:06,452 --> 00:48:07,453
I have to pee.

661
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:08,655
Oh, okay.

662
00:48:08,756 --> 00:48:11,157
Go in the bushes, I'll look out for you.

663
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:13,794
What kind of a girl do you think I am?

664
00:48:13,893 --> 00:48:15,962
GG, now isn't the time to be difficult

665
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:17,263
I have to pee!

666
00:48:17,363 --> 00:48:18,565
Okay, fine!

667
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:28,675
Hello?

668
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:35,516
Greetings.

669
00:48:35,616 --> 00:48:36,517
Hi.

670
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:39,553
Want to party?

671
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:42,321
My girlfriend has to pee.

672
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:44,758
Do you mind if she uses the bathroom?

673
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:45,826
But of course.

674
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:48,796
Hey, I'm GG.

675
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:50,296
Hi GG, I'm Leif.

676
00:48:51,632 --> 00:48:52,566
Welcome.

677
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,001
Come on up.

678
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:57,403
The bathroom's on your right.

679
00:49:06,979 --> 00:49:09,683
Would you like a cocktail?

680
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:11,250
[GG] 302?

681
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,118
Yes.

682
00:49:12,218 --> 00:49:14,987
That's my kind of girl, get up here.

683
00:49:15,988 --> 00:49:18,491
[laughing]

684
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:30,136
Leif Strong.

685
00:49:31,505 --> 00:49:34,373
Citizens of the Universe, Leif Strong.

686
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:39,979
I didn't even recognize
you without your beard.

687
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:41,849
You're awesome.

688
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:43,015
Thank you.

689
00:49:43,115 --> 00:49:45,084
I love conspiracy theories.

690
00:49:45,184 --> 00:49:47,019
Do you love the word theory?

691
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:54,460
[panting]

692
00:50:08,074 --> 00:50:10,443
[gasping]

693
00:50:32,064 --> 00:50:35,368
[phone notification]

694
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:02,629
See that?

695
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:08,702
The signature line on every
bank issued personal check

696
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:14,240
has writing so small, it's
not visible to the human eye.

697
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:15,976
What?

698
00:51:16,075 --> 00:51:17,443
That's what they mean when they say,

699
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:21,247
read the fine print
before signing anything.

700
00:51:26,252 --> 00:51:28,855
You've seen the owl on the dollar bill?

701
00:51:29,856 --> 00:51:31,758
Yeah, it's in the corner, right?

702
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:35,494
There's pyramids in China.

703
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:38,765
Yeah, much bigger than the ones in Giza.

704
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:42,234
And you know what they found inside?

705
00:51:42,335 --> 00:51:46,105
10-foot-tall mummies with red hair.

706
00:51:46,205 --> 00:51:48,875
Hello Norscot's calling.

707
00:51:48,976 --> 00:51:50,343
The government freaked out.

708
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:51,979
They covered it with dirt.

709
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,047
Now it's just a giant mountain.

710
00:51:54,146 --> 00:51:56,182
Discovery of the century, right?

711
00:51:56,282 --> 00:51:58,819
Oh no, they found another one.

712
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,190
At the bottom of the ocean
in Puerto Rico, oh shit!

713
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,158
It gets better.

714
00:52:07,894 --> 00:52:08,795
Mars.

715
00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:11,965
Damn.

716
00:52:12,065 --> 00:52:13,567
Did we go to the moon.

717
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:14,568
Yeah,

718
00:52:15,736 --> 00:52:17,403
but not by Apollo.

719
00:52:18,337 --> 00:52:19,806
They're masking the truth

720
00:52:19,906 --> 00:52:22,609
with yet another lie, those idiots.

721
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:25,344
Can you believe there are still people

722
00:52:25,444 --> 00:52:28,515
that think the Earth is flat?

723
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:30,817
But why would governments
go to such lengths

724
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:32,284
to cover this up?

725
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,388
All done?

726
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:37,423
Shut up Scully.

727
00:52:38,424 --> 00:52:40,359
The truth is in plain sight.

728
00:52:40,459 --> 00:52:43,964
You just need to learn
how to read the symbols.

729
00:52:44,064 --> 00:52:45,632
The Gods never left.

730
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:47,567
We are all of stock.

731
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:51,938
You know, people see aliens and UFOs

732
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:53,974
all over the US all the time,

733
00:52:54,074 --> 00:52:56,143
and they act like they don't exist.

734
00:52:56,242 --> 00:52:57,376
Right.

735
00:52:57,476 --> 00:52:59,813
The fact that we exist,
why can't others exist?

736
00:53:00,446 --> 00:53:02,214
But do we really exist?

737
00:53:02,314 --> 00:53:04,250
Are we not holograms?

738
00:53:04,918 --> 00:53:06,053
Every portion of the universe

739
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:08,220
carries a semblance of the whole,

740
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,856
like William Blake said,

741
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:13,593
you can find the universe
in a grain of sand.

742
00:53:16,328 --> 00:53:21,568
Bravo, bravo, GG, a
