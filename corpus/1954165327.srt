546
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,984
- [Growling]

547
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,792
[Bird cawing]

548
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:58,262
- Assault, battery,
property damage.

549
00:29:58,264 --> 00:29:59,897
Ghost bear!

550
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:01,632
What the heck is going on?

551
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:05,669
And what are you kids doing
in wwe city anyway?

552
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,806
- We won a contest.
- We won a contest.

553
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:14,111
- Don't look at me, Richards.
You sent out that memo.

554
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:17,047
The victory dance contest.

555
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,615
- Oh, that's right.

556
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:19,883
That wasn't my idea.

557
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:22,920
Boys over in marketing
or game development.

558
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,221
One of those.

559
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:25,389
Who can keep things straight

560
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,658
with all these bear attacks
going on?

561
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,326
- There have been others?

562
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,395
- Indeed. Several.

563
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,363
All of them inside
our buildings.

564
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:34,832
The creature trashed
the kitchen

565
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,434
and totally obliterated
our video game studio.

566
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,736
And as quickly
as it appears,

567
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,371
it disappears.

568
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,107
- I'm telling you,
it's the ghost.

569
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,510
An evil from beyond
the grave.

570
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,845
- [Teeth chattering]

571
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:50,280
[Creaking]

572
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,916
- Let's try
to remain calm here.

573
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,552
We don't want to jump
to any crazy conclusions.

574
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,921
- Mr. McMahon.
- Mr. McMahon.

575
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,089
- Like, in the flesh.

576
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:00,958
I can't believe I'm
actually face to face

577
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,092
with Vinnie Mac.

578
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:04,394
- The boss.
- The higher power.

579
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:06,430
- The Mac attack.
- The Mac daddy.

580
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:07,965
- Daddy Mac.

581
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:12,102
- Yes. Ahem. Thanks
for that trip down memory Lane.

582
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,604
Let me cut to the chase.

583
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:15,606
I've been doing a little
research on you kids.

584
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:17,641
You're some kind of
mystery solvers.

585
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:21,712
We could really use
your help here.

586
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,414
- Gee, Mr. McMahon,
we'd be glad to.

587
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,317
- My main concern is
the championship belt.

588
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,052
Not only is it worth
a fortune,

589
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,389
but wrestlemania wouldn't
be the same without it.

590
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,824
- Excuse me, sir,

591
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:36,126
but we don't need
these kids meddling

592
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,427
in security matters.

593
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,329
I promise the championship belt

594
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,031
is well guarded 24/7

595
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:44,501
with a state-of-the-art
electronic laser trip wire
alarm system.

596
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,036
There's no way the bear
could get to it

597
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,938
without tripping a beam
and setting off an alarm

598
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,208
that would bring in half
my security men within seconds.

599
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,676
- I understand, Richards,

600
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:55,178
but it couldn't hurt to have
these kids lend a hand.

601
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,947
- It's what we do.

602
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,351
- You mind if I help?

603
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,087
- Um--
- great idea, John.

604
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:08,125
- Awesome. Because
I think there's someone
you should talk to.

605
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,541
- Sin Cara?

606
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:27,611
- He knows the legend
of the bear better than anyone.

607
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,213
- Like, why is he hanging out
on the roof?

608
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,883
- Sin Cara has a flair
for drama.

609
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,157
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

610
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,758
[Applause]

611
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,360
- But does he even talk?

612
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:44,528
- He doesn't have to.

613
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,165
Luckily, I speak
masked luchador.

614
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,567
I'll translate as best I can.

615
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,769
[Spanish music playing]

616
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,472
[Thunder]

617
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,275
The legend of the ghost bear
begins 100 years ago

618
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:01,345
when a monstrous bear was
part of a traveling show.

619
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:02,679
They named him vicious.

620
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,081
And for good reason.

621
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,216
The creature had a mean streak
a mile wide

622
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,451
and twice as ugly.

623
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,453
It'd never been beaten, ever.

624
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:12,189
Till it met...

625
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:14,992
Sin Cara Grande,

626
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:18,395
sin Cara's great great
great grandfather.

627
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:21,465
He challenged the bear
on this very spot

628
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,234
long before there was
ever a wwe city.

629
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,836
[Bear growling]

630
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:29,272
The battle between
man and bear was epic.

631
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,878
The bear was a horrible,
unstoppable beast.

632
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,451
But when the match was over,

633
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:44,121
it was the man
standing victorious.

634
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,792
[Bear growls]

635
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:49,793

636
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,595
The bear could not
contain its anger.

00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:53,130
[People screaming]

638
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,170
He unleashed his rage
on the town.

639
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,173
Many lives would have been
lost that day

640
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:07,477
had it not been for
the brave luchador
sin Cara Grande.

641
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,279

[Bear groans]

While saving those
innocent townfolk,

644
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,219
he was injured.

645
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,459
Sin Cara Grande would
never wrestle again.

646
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:23,894
And the bear?

647
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,095
It escaped into the woods,

648
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,197
disappearing into a cave
north of town,

649
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,899
never to be seen again.

650
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,767
Until now.

651
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,904
Sin Cara believes
the spirit of the beast

652
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,173
has been stirred by
wrestlemania itself,

653
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,742
which is why the monster
has risen from the grave

654
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,710
to have its revenge.

655
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,579

It is now sin Cara's
honor and duty

658
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:48,819
to continue his great great
great grandfather's legacy

659
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:52,322
and protect wwe city
at any cost.

660
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,392

727
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:13,817
Is there something strange
about Scooby?

728

to answer that?

championship belt all right.

I'd know it anywhere.

And we'll be taking
the thief with us as well.

733

take me, raggy.

No!

We've asked you all here

victory dance

from the memory card
of shaggy's video game.

- Yeah, that's
a funkadactal move.

753

- Is there a point
to any of this?

754
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,669
- Watch as we slow down
the victory dance.

755
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,178
- It's the same movement.

756
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,714
- Scooby was programmed
with a post-hypnotic suggestion

757
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,417
to steal the championship belt.

758
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:57,687

sleep walking since he got here.

759

- Ohh. Yeah.

760
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:06,196
- And just how did
the dog get this
post-hypnotic programming?

761
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:08,698
- My guess is from
the video game itself.

in Scooby's brain.

a plant in my brain.

as this theory might be,

I'm still a guy that likes
to look at the facts.

775
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:58,982
- And the fact is,
he stole it.

776
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,618
And he's going to jail
for it.

777

Jail?

778
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,489

so you're going with him--
as his accomplice.

- Whatever it is...
- We'll do it.

786

[All gasping and yelling]

902
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:49,225

- Huh?!

- [Grunting]

904
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:10,046
- Like, that was amazing!

905
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:12,248
- Cen-amazing!

906
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,483
- How'd you know where we were?

907
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,819
- Daphne texted me.
- Mmm.

908
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,587
- Naturally.

909
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:20,022
- What's going on?

910
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:23,025
- Hillbilly hospitality.
We should keep moving.

911
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:26,462
- Come on,
I'll explain on the way.

912
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,343
- This is it, guys.

913
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:43,245
Bear cave.

914
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,083
- Come on, follow me.

915
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,652
- Now, that's rich.

916
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,655
Those dummies
just walked into a trap

917
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:57,259
that's better
than any I could make.

- Bet you that was
the original bear.

923
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,490
- He doesn't look
so vicious now.

924
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:29,992
- How long do you think
he's been there?

925
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:33,029
- Who cares, as long
as he stays there.

926
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:35,197

- Like, man,
what is this crazy place?

931
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:03,859
- My guess? The lair
of the ghost bear.

932
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:09,265
- Like, he has a lot of junk
for a ghost--or a bear.

933
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:10,900
- Not junk.

934
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,468
Clues!

935
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,669
- What are those?

936
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:15,271
- Books on hypnotism.

937
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:18,474
Hypnotic techniques
and subliminal hypnosis.

938
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:21,677
- Jackpot!
- Ohh!

939
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,979
- I think we just found
our first piece of evidence

940

to get you guys
off the hook with Kane.

941

- Hey, gang.

Schematics for emp.

946
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:44,366
- What's an emp?

947
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,735
- What's a schematic?

948
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:50,106
- An emp
is an electromagnetic pulse.

949
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:53,109
It's a device that can
destroy electronics
within its range.

Can't have an investigation
without evidence photos.

they're going to knock
the lights out on wrestlemania?

- Hey! What do you know?

1024
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:45,334
- The caves are connected
directly to the storm drains

1025
00:56:45,336 --> 00:56:47,236
under wwe city.

1026
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:51,206
- Giving that ghost bear
full access at any time.

1027
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,086
- So you see, Richards,
that's how the ghost bear

1028
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,221
gets in and out of so many
places so quickly.

1029
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:09,591
- And we have reason
to believe that whoever's
behind these bear attacks,

1030
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:13,462
has planted an emp device
right here in the stadium.

1031
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:14,963
- He could shut down
the whole place

1032
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,799
right in the middle
of wrestlemania.

1033
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:20,836
- We shouldn't take any risks.
We'll have to cancel the show.

1034
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:23,038
- We can't cancel wrestlemania!

1035
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,807
That's like canceling Christmas.

1036
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:26,575
Not to mention my career.

1037
00:57:26,577 --> 00:57:30,045
Besides, what could anyone gain
but shutting off the lights?

1038
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:33,248
- Not only the lights,
but the TV cameras, too.

1039
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,950
There'd be no show.

1040
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,819
- People would panic
in the pitch black.

1041
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,021
They'd get hurt!

- You're right, sin Cara.

1044
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:46,895
It would tarnish
the entire legacy of wwe.

1045
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:48,464
- Listen. I'll have my men

1046
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:51,033
guard the stadium's
generators 24/7.

1047
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:52,267
They'll check every square inch

1048
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:53,902
of the building
right before the show.

1049
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:56,572
No one's going to get away
with anything under my watch.

One way or another,
wrestlemania goes on.

- If the object of the emp
is to create chaos,

1052

you can bet that ghost bear
is not going to be far away
when it happens.

1053
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:11,487
- I think we all know
what we need to do.

1054
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:13,121
- Run away?

1055
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:16,725
- Nope. We've got to turn
wrestlemania into a trap.

1056
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:18,527
- A big bear trap.

1057
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:21,430
Whatever you plan, Fred,
count me in.

1058
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:26,702

maybe the gang has
solved the mystery yet?

Because there's no mysteries
to where we're going.

You have to get up there

01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:54,249
- Like, zoinks!

1255
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:56,751
- Is that ruben?

1256
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,354
- [Grunts]

1257
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,260
- Ruben, no!

1258
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,863
[All gasping]

1259
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:11,733
- Whoa-oh-oh!

1260
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:13,401
Ohhh!

1261
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,640
- I don't believe it, folks.

1262
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:22,977
Kane has been flattened,
and a new competitor
has entered the ring.

1263
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:27,382
But wait! Someone
has activated the cage.

1264
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:30,485
Sin Cara and John cena
are leaping into the ring.

1265
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:33,554
It's a cage match!

1266
01:11:33,556 --> 01:11:35,390
[Crowd cheering]

1267
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:38,126
- [Growling]

1268
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,230
- Like, we're all doomed!

1269
01:11:42,232 --> 01:11:45,900
- Don't worry, shaggy.
I'll protect you.

1270
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:49,537
- [Growling]
- The mysterious new competitor

1271
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:52,440
attacks the bear from behind,
creating a distraction

1272
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:55,109
for cena to make a move.

1273
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:58,079
But this powerful creature
turns the tables on them both.

1274
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:02,517
Now sin Cara stands alone.
- [Growls]

1275
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:07,322
- The fearless luchador attacks.

1276
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:10,291
He glides around the bear
like lightning.

1277
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,633
The bear
can't even touch sin Cara.

1278
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:22,603
Ladies and gentlemen,
I haven't seen moves
like this in the ring before.

1279
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:27,709
Sin Cara delivers
a stunning blow to the bear

1280
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:30,578
while John cena
recovers on the mat.

1281
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:34,449
He's going after the bear.
Cena is lifting the bear

1282
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:36,451
over his head.

1283
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,890
And the bear is down.

1284
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:45,326
[All cheering]

1285
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:46,861
- Yeah!
- Yay!

1286
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,030
- Yes!

1287
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,567
- What's that,
bear, what's that?

1288
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:55,203
You can't see me!

1289
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,375
- Ladies and gentlemen,
here it is.

1290
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:04,479
Cena's vintage
five knuckle shuffle.

1291
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,318
- [Growls]
[Crowd cheering]

1292
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,921
- It's lights out
for this big, bad bear.

1293
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:15,923
This match is over.

1294
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:18,259
- Yay! Yay!

1295
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:20,595
[All cheering]

1296
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:27,535
Cena and sin Cara
going for a tandem pin.

1297
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:29,370
- [Growling]

1298
01:13:29,372 --> 01:13:30,605
[Crowd cheering]

1299
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:32,473
- Impossible!

1300
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:34,675
- Huh? [Whimpers]

1301
01:13:34,677 --> 01:13:37,211
- [Growling]

1302
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,521
- Ooh-hoo-hoo!

1303
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:50,024
Scooby-doo, where are you?!

1304
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:52,393
- This looks bad for skinny man.

1305
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:55,463
But wait,
what is dead meat up to?

1306
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,269
- [Chattering]

1307
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:03,905
- [Growling]
- Dead meat has revived Kane.

1308
01:14:03,907 --> 01:14:07,975
The big, red monster has risen.

1309
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:20,855
Never before have we seen
a stand-off like this.

1310
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:24,392
It's monster vs. Monster
inside the cage at wrestlemania.

1311
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:26,627
Who will survive
this supernatural match-up?

1312
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:31,365
Who will be victorious
in this paranormal pandemonium?

1313
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:39,707
Kane drives the bear back
with a stunning blow.

1314
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:42,276
The bear hits the mat.
Kane pins down its leg.

1315
01:14:42,278 --> 01:14:45,246
A new competitor,
John cena and sin Cara

1316
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:47,081
pile onto the powerful creature,

1317
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,350
but they can
barely hold it down.

1318
01:14:49,352 --> 01:14:50,685
- [Grunting]

1319
01:14:50,687 --> 01:14:53,554
Scooby-doo, it's up to you!

1320
01:14:53,556 --> 01:14:56,357
- Only dead meat can tip
the balance now.

1321
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:58,025
- [Growling]

1322
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:00,695
- [Gulps]
- Can he do it?

1323
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:02,864
Can dead meat save the day?

1324
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:14,075
- Scooby doobie doo!

1325
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:21,249
- Dead meat just delivered
a gut-wrenching belly bomb

1326
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:24,252
and flattened the ring
and exploded the cage!

1327
01:15:24,254 --> 01:15:26,654
The dust is clearing now.

1328
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,526
The bear is out cold.

1329
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:33,728
Dead meat wins it!

1330
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:36,898
[Cheers and applause]

1331
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,366
- Whoo!

1332
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:39,834
- Dead meat!

1333
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:42,036
- That bear is toast!

1334
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:45,106
[Cheering and laughing]

1335
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,543
- [Growling]

1336
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:54,482
- [Gasping]

1337
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:56,784
- You ok, velm?

1338
01:15:56,786 --> 01:16:00,454
- This...Is...Awesome!

1339
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:04,358
Whoo-hoo!

1340
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,061
[Laughing]

1341
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,331
[Indistinct chatter]

1342
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:22,109
- Now let's see
who this ghost bear really is.

1343
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,712
[All gasping]

1344
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:28,416
- Cookie?!
- Cookie?!

1345
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:31,552
- Cookie?!
- Uncle cookie!

1346
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:33,020
Why?

1347
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:35,222
Wwe is your life.

1348
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:37,291
- Wwe was his life,

1349
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:39,760
but sadly, your Uncle cookie
never got the glory...

1350
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:41,996
- And his injury
put him out of the spotlight.

1351
01:16:41,998 --> 01:16:43,531
- Permanently.

1352
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:45,766
- He started to truly resent wwe

1353
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:48,035
because he knew he could
never be the champion

1354
01:16:48,037 --> 01:16:49,804
he always dreamed of being.

1355
01:16:49,806 --> 01:16:52,607
- That resentment grew into
hatred over the years,

1356
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:55,309
as he trained others to be
what he could not.

1357
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:59,180
- That's when he developed
his plan for revenge.

1358
01:16:59,182 --> 01:17:00,881
- But that wouldn't be enough.

1359
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:04,151
He needed a pawn to steal
the championship belt.

1360
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:08,389
That's when he devised the idea
of hacking into a video game

1361
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:11,559
and placing post-hypnotic
suggestions into it.

1362
01:17:11,561 --> 01:17:13,494
That game would become
part of a contest,

1363
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:17,798
which cookie set up
with fake emails
he sent throughout wwe.

1364
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,736
That's why he used
the bear to attack
your video game studio.

1365
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:23,638
To cover his tracks.

1366
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,240
- The contest assured
that only the most skilled pawn

1367
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:29,176
would arrive at wwe city
to aid in the theft.

1368
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:34,215
Cookie then used flashing
lights to activate Scooby's
post-hypnotic programming.

1369
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:38,252
- When cookie identified
the belt in Scooby's bed
as the championship belt,

1370
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:41,088
he was lying.
He'd already switched them.

1371
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:44,125
With Scooby taking the blame,
cookie was free to carry out

1372
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:46,227
his ultimate plan.

1373
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:48,696
- Which was to turn out
the lights, and with
the help of the bear,

1374
01:17:48,698 --> 01:17:51,766
create so much
panic and injury...

1375
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:53,300
[Bear growls]

1376
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:55,803
That wrestlemania
would be completely ruined

1377
01:17:55,805 --> 01:17:58,005
and wwe would never recover.

1378
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,108
- But thanks to Fred
here, we got the lights
back on pretty quick.

1379
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,643
Good work!
- [Grunts]

1380
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:05,312
Ah, um, thanks.

1381
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:11,552
- And the real championship
belt, where is it now?

1382
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:14,188
- Elementary,
my dear Mr. McMahon.

1383
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,890
Cookie's wearing it.

1384
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,831
- Sorry, cookie.

1385
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:27,368
But the championship belt
isn't for cheaters,
it's for champions.

1386
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:32,940
[Cheers and applause]

1387
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,412
- Good call,
hiring these kids, sir.

1388
01:18:38,414 --> 01:18:40,147
I thought they might
come in handy.

1389
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:41,649
- Just get cookie out of here!

1390
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:44,952
- Yes, sir, will do,
sir, you bet.

1391
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:55,629
- A championship belt
was the icing on
the cake, Mr. McMahon.

1392
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:58,933
Cookie could live off its golden
jewels for the rest of his life.

1393
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:00,201
- Boo!

1394
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:02,636
- And I would have
gotten away with it, too,

1395
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:05,206
if it weren't
for you meddling kids

1396
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:07,742
and your giant, crazy dog!

1397
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:09,643
[Audience booing]

1398
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:14,515
- I guess after what
my Uncle's done,

1399
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:16,817
you won't be wanting me
around anymore.

1400
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:19,820
- Not so, Ruby.
- You're one of us now.

1401
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:21,522
- You got the funk, son!

1402
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:25,092
- That's right, ruben.
You've shown a superstar
spirit in the ring,

1403
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,128
and at the computer.

1404
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:30,131
You've earned a place with us
in whatever you want to do.

1405
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:32,800
The choice is yours.

1406
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:35,803
- Thanks, Mr. McMahon.

1407
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,811
- Now that we have
the real championship belt,

1408
01:19:43,813 --> 01:19:46,847
it needs to be awarded
to true champions.

1409
01:19:46,849 --> 01:19:50,117
And after what I've seen
tonight, they're right here.

1410
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:53,287
Skinny man and dead meat!

1411
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:56,490
[Cheers and applause]

1412
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:08,035
- [Grunts]
- [Both gasp]

1413

[Audience gasping]

1414

[Both whimpering]

1415
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,178
- Really?
- Huh?

1416
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:20,514
- Well done.

1417
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,989
[Cheers and applause]
