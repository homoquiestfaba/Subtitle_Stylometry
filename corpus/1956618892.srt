What do you mean, sweetie?

You threw away my stockings.

was brutally attacked

this kind of thing

at the breakfast table?

14
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,251
You can't
make bad things go away

15

by pretending
they don't exist.

16

We don't have to bring them
into the house.

Yeah, she claims
that you injured
her precious Kyle yesterday.

34
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,041
He was trying
to climb the aquarium.

35
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,876
I had to pull him down
so he wouldn't hurt himself.

36
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,412
Well, she's a drama queen.
You know this.

37

Yes.

38

Speaking of drama,
how was last night?

Did you learn any new...

41
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,957
Well, we did learn this thing
called the butterfly

42
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,792
that was kind of interesting.

43
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,494
I told you
that you would have fun.

doing something like this.

Why didn't you tell us that
to begin with.

a surprise for my husband.

Um, I didn't want people
to see my car. I'm a mom.

in the garage next door.

we sure hate to put you out,

144
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,869
but you think
we can continue this
back at the station?

145
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,871
We don't want to have to
come back to the neighborhood.

146
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,708
We'll be...
We'll be back in no time.

147

Yeah, this gentleman's
gonna give you a lift.

148
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,147

down at the station.

Thank you so much.

I wish I knew
what this was about.

152
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,322
Did the detectives
read you your rights?

153
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,924
No.

154
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,892
Then you should
probably remain silent.

155
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:09,970
Right in here.

156
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,875

00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,010

It's the end of a long day.

160
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,986
I'm looking forward
to getting out of here, myself.

161
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,921
I can imagine
you feel the same way.

162
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,790
Can I get you anything?
Coffee?

163
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:30,824

some help to, uh,

if I can.

Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

169
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:45,072
Now, what time do you think
you left your...

170
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,108
Hmm, your stripper class
Monday night.

171
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,277
It's a pole-dancing class.

172
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,281
Um, class gets out at 9:00,
so I guess I left around 9:00.

173
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,149
It was 9:07.

174
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,152
According to the security camera
outside the dance studio door.

175
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,055
But a camera in the garage
where you parked

176
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,492
shows you leaving
the garage at 9:40.

177
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,061
So what were you doing
in the garage for 30 minutes?

178
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:11,331
Nothing. Are you sure
those times are right?

179
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,101
Times a correct.

180
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,937
Oh, I remember.

181
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,305
I...

182
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,107
Monday night we had
a really intense class,

183
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,441
and when I left
I was all sweaty.

184
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,443
I didn't want to get
in the car like that.

185
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,513
So I took a walk
around the block
just to kind of cool off.

186
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,882
I took the long way,
near those nice shops on elm.

187
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,218
So... I guess I did
a little window shopping

188
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,086
before I got back
to the garage.

189
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,822
A little window shopping.

190
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,524
Yeah. Why?

191
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,828
A woman named Faye Walker
was attacked in that garage

192
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,395
between 9:00pm and 10:00pm.

193
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,064
Now, according
to security cameras,

194
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,867
the only car leaving
or entering that garage

195
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,869
during that time period
was yours.

196
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,804
So just tell us
what happened.

197
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:54,842
Well, did you see anything
in the garage during that time?

198
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,945
No! I certainly didn't see
a woman being attacked!

199
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,880
I would have reported
something like that.

200
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,018
My god.

201
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:09,189
You can't possibly think
I had something to do with this.

202
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,892
[Chuckles]
I don't even kill insects.

203
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:16,029
Well, no one was killed,
miss plainview. Thank god.

204
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,866
But we have a victim,
Faye Walker,

205
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,034
in I.C.U., county hospital,

206
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,036
we just need to know
what the hell happened to her.

207
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,105
Maybe you caught this woman
breaking into your car.

208
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,207
Maybe she turned around
and attacked you.

209
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,909
Maybe you grabbed
the nearest object you could

210
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,410
and defended yourself.

211
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,913
Maybe this whole thing
was just in self defense.

212
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,148
Perfectly understandable.
It could happen to anyone.

213
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:39,219
Now, if it was--
if it was,

214
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:42,489
just tell us,
and we can wrap
this whole thing up right now.

215
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:46,393
But that's not what happened.

216
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:50,263
I'd like to call my husband.

217
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:53,100
Thanks. Empty your pockets
into the tray.

218
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,902
This is crazy.
I haven't done anything.

219
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,904
Do you have any weapons,
needles, anything sharp on you?

220
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,138
No!

221
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,240
Hands on the table.
Feet back.

222
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,118
Okay, over here.

223
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,920
Left hand.

224
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,333
Right hand.

225
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,449
This is Mike,
please leave a message.
[Beep]

226
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,086
Hi, honey, it's me.
It's the craziest thing.
I got arrested.

227
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,222
A woman got attacked,
and for some reason they think
I had something to do with it.

228
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,490
I don't know
what it's all about.

229
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,692
I'm at the west-side precinct.

230
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,995
Will you come to the station
as soon as you can?

231
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,164
Please hurry.

232
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:02,135
Okay, bail's been set
for 500,000.

233
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,603
$500,000?

234
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,438
The bond is based
on the criminal code.

235
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,140
We're not authorized
to make any adjustments,

236
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,576
but you can take it up
with the judge when you see one.

237
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,411
So what happens now?

238
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,580
I'm going to put you
in a holding cell
until you make bail.

239
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,416
If you don't make bail by 6:00,
you'll be released into the g.P.

240
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,351
General population.

241
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,958
Where's detective sanford?

242
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,259
He said I'd be going home.

243
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,660
He said this was just
a matter of routine.

244
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,662
Yeah, this is a routine,
sweetheart.

245
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,132
Come on in. Come on in.

246
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,701
You want a blanket?
No! I'm not spending the night.

247
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,463
[Gasping]

248
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,002
[Sobbing]

249
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:12,005
You think you scared now?

250
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,375
Wait 'til it gets dark.

251
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,344
[Sobbing]

252
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,087
Tied up.

253
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,292
Up. You're getting a room
with a view.

254
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,593
Did my husband call?

255
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,096
Nope, nobody called.
Turn around, hands back.

256
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,766
Okay, let's go.

257
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,334
Jewelry goes in the tray.

258
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:55,715
In the tray.

259
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,352
This is ridiculous.
I'm not a criminal.

260
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,054
I work in a dentist's office.

261
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,322
Clothes go in the bag.

262
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,091
Why won't anyone listen to me?

263
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,525
I haven't done anything.

264
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,194
Can I please make
one more phone call?

265
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,496
Change into these.

266
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,803
Turn around.

267
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,413
Say hi to your new roommate,
Ramona.

268
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,224
Do you mind if I take
this one?

269
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,247
Want to come cuddle up
with Ramona?

270
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,418
[Sobbing]

271
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,487
Shut the hell up!

272
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,700
Plainview.

273
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,435
Got a visitor.

274
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,540
Turn around.

275
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,829
Mike, sweetie,
where have you been?
I was scared to death.

276
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,731
Ellen, what the hell
is going on?

277
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,666
There were a bunch of cops
searching the house today.

278
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,336
They took your car.
Julie's freaking out.

279
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,837
What is this all about?

280
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,439
It's all so horrible.

281
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,941
Why are they saying
that you beat someone?

282
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,609
I don't know.

283
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,678
A woman got attacked
where I park on Monday nights.

284
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,913
What woman?
Do you know her?

285
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,615
Of course not.

286
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,917
They saw my car on a security
camera where it happened,

287
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,254
so they think that I had
something to do with it.

288
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,721
You have your book club
Monday nights.

289
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,390
Didn't you park at Alice's?

290
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,891
No, I was taking
pole dancing lessons.

291
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,393
What?

292
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,562
It was supposed to be
a surprise.

293
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,765
Pole dancing?

294
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,500
Alice said it would help me
get in touch

295
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,601
with my sexy side.

296
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,270
By becoming a stripper?

297
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:06,373
No, it was just for you.
It was for us.

298
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,741
Can you get me out of here?

299
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,977
Look, the bail's
half a million dollars.

300
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,580
I need 10% for a bondsman.

301
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,548
Where am I going to get
50 grand?

302
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:18,318
I have to stay here?

303
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,354
Look, I put a call in
to a lawyer friend of mine.

304
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,391
He's expensive,
but he might be willing
to help us out as a favor.

305
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,559
I'm still waiting
to hear back.

306
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,628
Everything's going to be okay,
right?

307
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,533
If you're innocent,
you don't have anything
to worry about.

308
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,968
What do you mean,
if I'm innocent?

309
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,471
I didn't mean it like that.

310
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:41,341
I'm sure this is all
going to work out.

311
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,375
It'll be fine.

312
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,610
[Whistle]

313
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,445
Tell Julie not to w--

314
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:50,049
[no audible dialogue]

315
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,451
[Guard]
Time's up.

316
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,826
[Woman]
All rise.

317
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,863
The honorable judge
Noah Wallace presiding.

318
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,512
If there's
anything else you need.
Just let me know. Okay?

319
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:58,084
Hey, you.
What are you doing here?

320
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,520
They're charging me
with assault.

321
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,888
Assault on who?

322
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,356
I don't know.

323
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,691
Some woman was attacked
in a parking garage,

324
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,393
and they think
that I was involved.

325
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,528
I'm sure it's some sort
of mistake, right?

326
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,862
It is.
It's a horrible mistake.

327
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,564
I didn't do anything.

328
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,566
Well, I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

329
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,835
Look. No one's interested in
prosecuting an innocent person,

330
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,104
so just cooperate,
and you'll be fine.
Right?

331
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,347
Detainee plainview,
please step forward.

332
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,888
Ellen plainview, case 335,

333
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:40,026
you are charged
with penal code 118.18,

334
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,529
assault with intent
to commit murder.

335
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,631
Do you have counsel?

336
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,433
Not yet, your honor.

337
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,401
Are you ready to enter a plea?

338
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:50,737
Not guilty.

339
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,605
[Judge]
Court sets a preliminary hearing

340
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:53,873
for Monday the 19th.

341
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,008
Defendant is dismissed.

342
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,445
Why is everyone treating me
like I'm guilty?

343
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,137
Ellen plainview,
how you doing?

344
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,640
Ed Flynn. I'm here as a favor
to your husband.

345
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:28,841
I appreciate it, Mr. Flynn.

346
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,577
Oh, well, Mike's a good guy.

347
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,779
He pulled me over one night
after a poker game,

348
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:35,047
and, well,
I was pretty toasted

349
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,816
on some single malt.

350
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,952
Anyway, I told him that I just
live a few blocks away,

351
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,921
and anyway he cut me a break.

352
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,024
So I've agreed to look
at your case pro bono,

353
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,927
which means
that I will do it for free.

354
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,796
Thank you.

355
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:52,231
Sure. Hey, you're going to get
a kick out of this.

356
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,666
[Laughs]

357
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,235
What?

358
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,205
Oh, wha-- forget about that.
No one reads the paper anyway.

359
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,573
So I assume
that you're innocent.

360
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,074
Of course.

361
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,110
Okay, then you've got nothing
to worry about.

362
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,012
I'll take care of everything.

363
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,947
The legal system,
it's a big game.

364
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,817
You've just got to know
how to play it, which I do.

365
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,652
I'll contact the d.A.
This afternoon.

366
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,054
I can probably have
all the charges dropped

367
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,856
just by asking.

368
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,858
Really?

369
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,660
Sure. Yeah,
they have no case here.

370
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,662
No motive. They don't want
this to go to trial.

371
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,996
Believe me.

372
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,199
So you just leave
everything to me,

373
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,035
and I will have you home
by dinnertime.

374
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,838
Thank you so much.

375
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:34,040
Let me know if anybody
gives you trouble in there.

376
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,875
I know everybody in the joint.

377
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,777
[Laughs]

378
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,605
[Ellen]
But, Mr. Flynn, you said

379
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,640
you were going to get them
to drop the case.

380
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,546
I see. Well, how long?

381
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,915
I haven't seen my family
in three days.

382
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:19,151
How long will I be here?

383
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,987
Mr. Flynn?

384
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,171
Mike, my hearing is tomorrow.

385
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,674
So I was just wondering if you
could bring me a dress to wear.

386
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,745
The blue one
with the white trim.

387
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,780
Please bring Julie.

388
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:50,983
I need to see her.

389
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,552
Mike, I love you.

390
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:58,257
Will you please say it back?

391
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,760
Hey. Hey, baby.

392
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,595
Why don't you say
you love me, too,

393
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:03,896
because if you was here
right now,

394
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,699
I would show you
a good time.

395
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,134
Please.

396
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,804
Better watch yourself, girl.

397
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:14,173
I'm in here for punching
a cop for talking back to me.

398
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,008
What are you in here for,
shoplifting?

399
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,279
Attempted murder.

400
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,264
Hey, there you are.

401
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,032
Okay.

402
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,271
Hm, Kay Sullivan.

403

[Clears throat]
Hello, Kay.

405
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,810
Looking nice today.

406
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:56,282
[Bailiff]
All rise.

407
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,157
Good morning, Ms. Sullivan.

408
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,358
What do we have?

409
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,294
The people
vs. Ellen plainview--

410
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,062
assault with intent
to commit murder.

411
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,198
The victim in this case,
a miss Faye Walker,

412
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,200
has been unconscious
since the assault

413
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:18,805
and is therefore unable to I.D.
Her attacker at this time.

414
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,239
However, the people
will provide evidence

415
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,308
in the form of security
camera footage

416
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:25,244
which clearly the defendant
in the parking garage

417
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,179
at the time of the assault.

418
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,248
Additionally,
the people will show

419
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,818
that the victim was beaten
with a tire iron,

420
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,452
consistent with the kind

421
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,287
provided as standard equipment

422
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,356
with the defendant's
make of car.

423
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,126
Brown hair,
which lab tests confirm

424
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,828
as coming from the defendant,

425
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:44,130
was found
on the victim's clothing,

426
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,132
and the people will provide
an eye witness

427
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,235
who will testify having seen
Ellen plainview

428
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,469
depositing a tire iron

429
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,404
in a dumpster not far
from the assault

430
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,440
just moments after the crime.

431
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:58,010
I'll check.
I'm sure it's just
a bunch of rubbish.

432
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:01,180
Your honor, the defense moves
to have this case dismissed

433
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:04,116
based on a complete lack
of motive.

434
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,918
The people will provide

435
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:08,354
ample and compelling motive,
your honor.

436
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:11,824
I'm setting a trial date
for two months hence,

437
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,160
Monday, June 7th.

438
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,962
Is that enough time
for you, Ms. Sullivan?

439
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,230
We'll have our case prepared,
your honor.

440
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:21,167
I'll be ready, too,
your honor.

441
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,802
We're going to trial?

442
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,939
Um, Mr. Flynn, shouldn't you--

443
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:29,141
counselor, aren't you
forgetting something?

444
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:30,910
Your honor?

445
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:33,880
Your client has the right
to ask for bail adjustment.

446
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,081
What I was just getting to.

447
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:36,482
Your honor, we request

448
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,151
the defendant be released
on her own recognizance.

449
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:41,353
She is a wife and mother
with a job,

450
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,523
who has never been charged
with a crime.

451
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,192
Ms. Sullivan?

452
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,461
Due to the severity
of the potential penalties

453
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:50,830
of this case,

454
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,431
we feel that she's
a flight risk.

455
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,467
The people ask that bail
remains set at $500,000.

456
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,870
Oh, come on, Kay.

457
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,471
The defendant
is to be released

458
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,507
on her own recognizance.

459
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,042
You're free.
Let's get out of here.

a ticket last week.

00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,052
Could use a hand
with that one.

467
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,890

and find out

470
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:59,465
that this whole thing
was one big nightmare.

471
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,033
How often does this happen,

472
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,135
where they arrest
the wrong person for a crime?

473
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,504
Not often.

474
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,840
Is there anything
that you can do about this,

475
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:09,308
you know, in the department?

476
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,077
Ellen, if I was caught
tampering with

477
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,214
or interfering in this case
in any way, I mean...

478

This lawyer, Mr. Flynn,
is he good?

00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,921
He should be.
He charges a fortune.

I don't know what I'm going
to tell Julie about all this.

481
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,893

of something.

this is putting you out,

some kindness.

I never met that woman.

an eye witness.

I helped him down
so he wouldn't hurt himself,
and she got really angry.

529
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:20,066
Do you think she's making up
this story to get back at me?

530
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,269
Who knows.
People are crazy.

531
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:26,172
Who is this woman Faye Walker?

532
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:28,407
[Sighs]
Well...

533
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,109
She's nobody really.

534
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,244
She works as an escort
around the airport hotels.

535
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:35,514
She's the kind of woman
who makes men happy

536
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,716
except when she doesn't.

537
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,619
Apparently she still
hasn't regained consciousness.

538
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:43,489
When she does, she can tell
everyone I didn't do this.

539
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,057
[Cell phone beeps]

540
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:47,593
Ooh, I told you I represent
celebrities.

541
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,796
[Chuckles]
She wants to have lunch.

542
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,664
Okay, I have got to go.

543
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,300
Listen, thank you
for that coffee.

544
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:57,103
It was delicious.

545
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,570
So listen to me.

546
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:01,440
I do not want you
to discuss this case
with anybody.

547
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:04,076
Okay? You just go about
your daily routine.

548
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,213
I want you to go to work
as if this never happened.

549
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:11,150
And I will make sure
that this all goes away.

550
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,185
Okay?

551
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:19,525
Ellen, we weren't expecting
you to come in today.

552
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,628
I'm just anxious to get
everything back to normal.

553
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:31,570
Look, Ellen.

554
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:34,340
Dr. Pierce doesn't think
you should work here

555
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,508
given the circumstances.

556
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,310
You know, people are talking,

557
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:41,580
and he thinks maybe
after the trial.

558
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:43,682
What?

559
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,585
I'm so sorry, honey.

560
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,655
He doesn't think I'm guilty,
does he?

561
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,857
Of course not.
I'm sure he doesn't.

562
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,263
Listen, sweetie.

563
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,331
I'm here for you,

564
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:00,899
and I firmly believe

565
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,569
everything happens for a reason,

566
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,305
and somehow, some way

567
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,607
some good is going to come
out of this.

568
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,176
Thank you, Alice.

569
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:35,634
Honey. Shh, it's okay.

570
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:39,371
It's okay. Shh.

571
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,739
It's okay.
It's okay.

572
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,441
Shh. It's okay.

573
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,334
Hey.

574
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:44,970
How you doing?

575
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,376
You work things out
down at the station?

576
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:53,712
No, they're charging me
with attempted murder.

577
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,514
Who, that woman that got beat
in that garage

578
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,515
over on oak street?

579
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,816
Yes.

580
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,418
Who are the investigating
officers?

581
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,253
Um, detective sanford
and hamer.

582
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,422
Yeah, they're usually
pretty good.

583
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:04,823
Guess everybody makes mistakes.

584
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,258
You got a good lawyer?

585
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:08,694
I hope so.

586
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,930
What about your husband?
Is he helping?

587
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,300
He's been really busy.
He's taking his classes.

588
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,802
They're promoting him
to the fraud division.

589
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,704
The things we sacrifice
for our men, huh?

590
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,773
Listen. I'm sure
it'll all work out,

591
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,709
but if there's
anything you need,

592
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,544
just let me know.

593
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,545
Thank you.

594
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,713
Welcome.

595
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,283
Take care.

596
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,768
Your troubles are over.

597
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,304
Faye Walker
just regained consciousness.

598
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:53,739
The d.A. Wants you down
at the hospital

599
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,374
to see if she can identify you.

600
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:56,742
Great.

601
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:41,520
Nurse, may we have a moment,
please?

602
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:43,021
Thanks.

603
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,427
What is it?

604
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,095
No cards, no flowers.

605
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:56,334
Well, maybe she's not
the type of woman that
gets cards and flowers.

606
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:00,806
Miss Walker?

607
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,108
Miss Walker?

608
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,550
I'm detective sanford.
This is detective hamer.

609
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,619
We're here to help you.
Okay?

610
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,561
Do you recognize this woman?

611
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,931
Is this the woman
who attacked you?

612
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,039
How did I get here?

613
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:35,707
Well, you've been hurt,

614
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,576
and you're in a hospital now.

615
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,945
Do you know anybody
that would do this to you?

616
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:42,514
Do you recognize this woman
at all?

617
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,050
Aah!

618
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,827
[Sanford]
Well, that didn't work out
too well.

619
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,529
Looked like
a positive I.D. To me.

620
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,965
Don't be ridiculous, gene.

621
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,166
Frankly, Ms. Plainview,

622
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,901
we were hoping for your sake

623
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,603
we could wrap all this up
for you today.

624
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,071
It looked like an I.D.

625
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,606
[Cell phone vibrating]
All right, that's it.

626
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,907
Hello.

627
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,977
We're so sorry we wasted
your time today.

628
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,912
Come on, gene.

629
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,017
Well, let me get
to my client,

630
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,220
and I will get back to you.
Okay.

631
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,723
Good news.
That was the d.A.'S office.

632
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,558
They have an opening
in the court calendar.

633
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,827
We can go to trial immediately
instead of waiting until June.

634
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,895
Immediately?

635
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:30,929
Or we wait two months.

636
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:31,963
Should we accept?

637
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:33,499
Well, that's up to you.

638
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,200
You want to spend
the next two months worrying,

639
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,102
or do you want to get this
over with?

640
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,971
[Chuckles]
I say let's go for it.

641
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:00,692
Honey, what are you doing?

642
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:03,094
I can't do this anymore,
Ellen.

643
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,930
I'm sorry.

644
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,132
I don't know my place
here anymore.

645
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:10,969
I think it's better if I just
stay away for a while.

646
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,904
What? Why?

647
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:15,106
I still feel like there are
things you're not telling me

648
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,908
about that woman
who was attacked.

649
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:19,177
The guys at the station,
they're asking me questions

650
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,612
I don't have the answers for.

651
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,247
Mike, what are you talking
about?

652
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,915
You've lied to me

653
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:27,085
about where you were
that night.

654
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,754
What else are you lying
to me about?

655
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:31,523
Nothing.

656
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:34,626
Look, I don't want to end up
resenting you,

657
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,827
so I think it's better

658
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,563
if I just stay away
for a while.

659
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:41,867
Okay? Julie's at Jasmine's.

660
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,870
I can't believe
you're not standing by my side.

661
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:48,106
You don't think I'm guilty,
do you?

662
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:51,943
Honestly, I don't know
what to think anymore.

663
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,947
Mike, what's happened to you?

664
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:57,816
You're not the man I married.

665
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,714
[Sobbing]

666
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:48,133
All rise.
The honorable judge
Noah Wallace presiding.

667
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,143
[Judge Wallace]
Bailiff, you can bring
the jury in, please.

668
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,253
Here we go.

669
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,698
Ms. Sullivan?

670
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,142
Ladies and gentlemen,

671
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:34,379
the people will prove
that this woman,

672
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:36,682
despite her attempts
to appear to you

673
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:40,085
as a sweet
and innocent housewife,

674
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,287
is in all actuality
a predator.

675
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,155
A predator

676
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:46,792
who leads a secret,
dark life as

677
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:48,927
a stripper in training.

678
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,697
Who has meetings
with prostitutes.

679
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,199
One of which turned violent.

680
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,434
We will conclusively
place Ellen plainview

681
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,303
at the scene of the crime
during the time

682
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:01,006
the assault occurred.

683
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:03,108
We'll provide
physical evidence

684
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,410
linking her to the victim.

685
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,746
And we will provide
eye-witness testimony

686
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,247
that she disposed
of the weapon

687
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,217
just moments
after the crime.

688
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,754
Ladies and gentlemen,
help us seek justice.

689
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,123
And assure that this woman

690
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,192
is never allowed to hurt
anyone ever again.

691
00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:27,098
Counselor.

692
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,436
Ladies and gentlemen.

693
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,404
I am not here today to prove

694
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:35,373
that my client is innocent.

695
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,108
I don't have to do that.

696
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:38,744
The law says
that you're supposed

697
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:41,880
to presume her innocence.

698
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:45,050
Now, the prosecution has
a crime that it cannot solve.

699
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:48,386
So they decided
to pin it on my client.

700
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,155
Now, they offer no motive.

701
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,858
No reason in the world
why she would savagely beat

702
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:55,761
a woman whom
she's never met.

703
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:57,495
Ladies and gentlemen,

704
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:01,432
there is simply no case.

705
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,772
All right, Ms. Sullivan,

706
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:08,774
you may call
your first witness.

707
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:12,410
There's Faye Walker, the victim,
right there in the black dress.

708
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,512
There were no cars
in the parking structure

709
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,247
when we entered.

710
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:18,817
We found the body here,
laying next to a pillar

711
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,886
in a large pool of blood.

712
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:24,189
Now, Ms. Plainview told us,

713
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,024
under questioning,

714
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,894
that she'd typically parked
along the northwest wall.

715
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,229
Which is right here.

716
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,364
Which, as you can see,
is adjacent to where

717
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,366
the victim was beaten.

718
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,202
You describe this

719
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,270
as a vicious beating.

720
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,807
Oh, very much so.
Very vicious.

721
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,441
In my professional opinion,

722
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,244
it was a clear intent
to cause death.

723
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:49,114
And detective,
in your opinion,

724
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:50,849
could such a beating
be administered

725
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:53,251
by a woman of, say,

726
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:55,921
5' 4", 110 pounds?

727
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:57,255
Oh, easily.

728
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,857
Let me tell you something.

729
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,559
You get beat
with a tire iron.

730
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,262
Doesn't make any difference
how big or strong you are.

731
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,299
Yeah-yeah,
no, got it, got it.

732
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:13,571
Ah, there's no question that
Ms. Plainview was on the scene

733
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,540
at the approximate time
of the crime.

734
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:17,408
I mean, the video
speaks for itself.

735
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,310
Listen, we looked at
all the evidence,

736
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:22,180
and I mean all of it.
It all points to one person.

737
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:23,849
Which person is that?

738
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:25,250
I'm sorry?
Which person is that?

739
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,517
Well, right there.

740
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:27,853
Ellen plainview.

741
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,458
Detective sanford,
may I ask how old you are?

742
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,927
Objection.
Sustained.

743
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:39,330
Mm, you're approaching
retirement age, correct?

744
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:42,200
So I imagine
that you're anxious

745
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:43,334
to go out on a good note?

746
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:45,403
So isn't it possible

747
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:48,406
that in your excitement
to wrap up this case quickly,

748
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:51,442
that, uh, it might've
affected your judgment?

749
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,311
No, not at all.

750
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:56,214
You see, we brought this case to
the district attorney's office

751
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:58,016
based solely on the evidence,

752
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,252
and your client's behavior
under questioning.

753
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:03,521
The truth of the matter
is, Mr. Flynn,

754
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,323
your client lied to us
about how long

755
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:07,125
she'd been in that
parking structure.

756
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,894
That's not true.

757
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:11,863
You may not speak without
permission from the bench.

758
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:13,531
Your honor, I didn't
lie about anything.

759
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,533
I'm warning you,
Mrs. Plainview.

760
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,402
Sit down.

761
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:24,009
Detective hamer,

762
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:26,144
during your initial

763
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,946
questioning of the defendant,

764
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,448
did you ask her for her
whereabouts during the crime?

765
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:31,983
Of course.

766
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,384
It was the first thing
we asked her.

767
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:35,153
And what was her response?

768
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:39,057
Well, she had a couple
different answers.

769
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,459
The first time we asked,
she said she was at a book club.

770
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:44,029
The second time we asked,
she said she was at this

771
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,064
stripper class.

772
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:47,532
You know, one of those
classes where they teach you

773
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,500
to dance on a pole.

774
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:51,502
I guess she was
considering a new career.

775
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:52,670
That's insane!

776
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,172
Mrs. Plainview,
if you interrupt

777
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,440
these proceedings once more,

778
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:58,343
I'll hold you in contempt.

779
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,445
Mrs. Bracketss,
on the night of the crime,

780
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:02,247
you were driving
westbound on oak street

781
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,516
at approximately
9:45 pm, correct?

782
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,486
Correct.

783
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,422
You told police officers that
you saw a woman in an alley,

784
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:13,324
at the corner
of oak and 7th.

785
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:14,559
It was her,

786
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:17,362
Ellen plainview.

787
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,430
You're sure this
is the woman you saw.

788
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:21,532
Yes.

789
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,601
She works at
my dentist's office.

790
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:27,005
Mrs. Bracketss,
would you please tell the court

791
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:29,574
what you saw
the defendant doing

792
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,077
in the alley
at 9:45 that night?

793
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,546
She was wiping off
a metal object

794
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,515
which I observed
to be approximately

795
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:40,051
the shape and size
of a tire iron.

796
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,321
And did you observe her

797
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:45,690
doing anything else
with this object?

798
00:48:45,723 --> 00:48:49,027
She discarded it
in a dumpster.

799
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:55,566
No further questions.

800
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,169
Mrs. Bracketss,
you take your son

801
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:01,406
to Dr. Steward Pierce,
correct?

802
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,374
Correct.

803
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:07,178
Yeah, and you actually knew
the defendant before this case

804
00:49:07,212 --> 00:49:08,579
through your visits
to the office, correct?

805
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:11,983
I thought I did.

806
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:14,619
Well, you were
acquainted with her.

807
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,988
Yes.
So, on April 7th,

808
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:19,290
your five-year-old son
was climbing the aquarium

809
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,292
in the waiting room
of this dentist's office.

810
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:23,561
Now, the defendant moved
your son away from the aquarium

811
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:26,731
to save him from
a possible serious accident.

812
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:29,067
She yanked his arm.

813
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,768
Well, if that's the case,

814
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,271
I guess that could
make you upset

815
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,406
when you heard this news,
in which case that could

816
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,743
make you angry
with Ms. Plainview.

817
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:40,678
But isn't it also true

818
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:42,447
that, well,

819
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,749
you've made up
this whole story

820
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:47,052
about my client
and a tire iron

821
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,454
after hearing this case
on the news?

822
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,656
Hoping to punish her
for injuring your child?

823
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:53,691
No! No way.

824
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,327
The fact is,
you have no business

825
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:57,728
being on this witness stand,

826
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:59,597
do you, Ms. Bracketss?

827
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,232
My client
disciplined your child,

828
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:03,501
so you decided
to use this courtroom

829
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,703
to exact your vengeance?

830
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,106
Objection!
Sustained.

831
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:10,775
Oh, you oughta be
ashamed of yourself.

832
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:12,677
How dare you judge me!

833
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,712
I know a criminal
when I see one.

834
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:18,383
You can tell she's guilty
just by looking at her.

835
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:21,519
Ugh, I am through
with this witness.

836
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:33,364
That was beautiful.

837
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:34,765
Oh man, Marla bracketss.

838
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:37,202
She totally
self-destructed in there.

839
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:39,104
I will bet
Sullivan is drafting

840
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:42,207
a motion to dismiss
as we speak.

841
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,609
You think so?

842
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,378
I killed it, yeah.
Oh no, this is all over.

843
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:49,080
We're gonna go
to the d.A.'S office

844
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:51,449
first thing in the morning
and demand a dismissal.

845
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:55,453
Hey, buddy.

846
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,488
Something I can
help you with?

847
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:59,390
No.

848
00:51:01,326 --> 00:51:04,795
I told you that I would
take care of everything.

849
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:07,165
Wow, look at this.
I can still get to the gym.

850
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:08,499
Find a date for tonight.

851
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,502
You good grabbing a cab?

852
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,238
You're a trooper.

853
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,294
Well, good morning, Kay.

854
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:11,662
Oh, now that
is a lovely dress.

855
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:14,432
I'm surprised to hear
from you this morning, ed.

856
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,267
I was just about
to call you myself.

857
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,369
Oh, are you ready
to drop the charges

858
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:20,571
against my client?

859
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:23,241
Why would I do that?
You don't have a case.

860
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:26,544
I mean, you saw me destroy
your star witness yesterday.

861
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:29,547
I thought you were coming here
to change your plea to guilty.

862
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,616
Oh, really,

863
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,584
and why the hell
would we do that?

864
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:36,254
You have no motive.
You have no case.

865
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,556
We just learned that
Faye Walker was involved

866
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:42,293
in a sexual relationship
with Mike plainview.

867
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:46,897
Your client's husband was having
an affair with the victim.

868
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:48,366
What?

869
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:50,501
We have our motive,
counselor.

870
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:52,303
Okay, did you
know about this?

871
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:54,439
Of course not!

872
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:55,706
Okay, you know what?

873
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,308
Let's hold on here, Kay.

874
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:58,743
Faye Walker is in a coma.

875
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,411
So how would you
have any idea--

876
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:03,448
we found a cell phone number
among her personal effects.

877
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:05,783
We questioned
Mr. Plainview last night.

878
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:08,953
He admitted the whole affair.
Signed an affidavit.

879
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:10,555
When plainview was in uniform,

880
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:13,858
he arrested Walker
for solicitation.

881
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,493
After serving three months,

882
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:19,264
she reconnected with him.

883
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:22,633
They became involved.

884
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:25,403
Okay, well then,
you have your perp, Kay.

885
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:26,904
Mike plainview was
with his daughter Julie

886
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,439
the night of the crime.

887
00:53:28,473 --> 00:53:30,007
TV footage
places him at the...

888
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,942
Metro sports arena
that night.

889
00:53:31,976 --> 00:53:35,346
Look, we'll reduce the charge
to aggravated assault.

890
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,284
Plead off and you'll do
two years at the most.

891
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:41,018
Otherwise,

892
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,389
you're looking at
eight to ten, easy.

893
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,428
No. No-no-no-no!

894
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:51,729
You need to calm d--

895
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,806
Ellen.

896
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,809
Ellen!

897
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:06,777
What the hell?

898
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,746
You made me look
like a fool in there.

899
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,582
You're telling me you knew
nothing about this affair.

900
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,351
No.

901
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,520
Okay, well,
it changes everything.

902
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:18,789
I don't even know if I can
continue with your defense.

903
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:21,559
Damn it, I didn't want to take
this case in the first place.

904
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,294
You know, Mike,
he's a friend of mine.

905
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:25,029
So that makes this
whole thing in conflict.

906
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:27,865
Mr. Flynn!
And I will be honest.

907
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:29,567
I'm looking at
all the evidence now,

908
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,836
and it looks to me
like maybe you did

909
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:35,706
have something to do
with this after all.

910
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,842
Leave everything to me,
you said!

911
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,345
You've done nothing
but make things worse
from the beginning!

912
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:42,046
Oh, really? Well,
if that's how you feel,

913
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,582
I will send you a bill, and you
can find other representation.

914
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,351
A bill? For what?

915
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:48,353
I could've
handled this better myself.

916
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:50,455
I'm gonna tell Ms. Sullivan
you should be disbarred.

917
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,590
Okay, you are not
gonna tell her anything.

918
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,459
Get your hand off me!
Ellen, it's time

919
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:55,860
to calm down now.

920
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:57,528
Let her go.
Hey.

921
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:59,664
It's between her and me,
pal, okay? Screw off.

922
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:01,466
I said let her go.

923
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:08,506
You son of a bitch.

924
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:11,842
I will sue you and you.

925
00:55:11,876 --> 00:55:14,412
I hope you get
everything you deserve.

926
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,551
You're right.

927
00:55:20,585 --> 00:55:23,954
He should be disbarred.

928
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,656
You've been following me.

929
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:28,726
Actually, I've been
following your case.

930
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:32,029
I'm Ben saverin, from
the public defender's office.

931
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,898
You okay?

932
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,433
Yeah.

933
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,768
It looks like
you could use a friend.

934
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,104
It also looks like
you could use some lunch.

935
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:42,573
What do you say?

936
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:45,342
Okay.

937
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:54,985
At the courthouse is--

938
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,655
best hot dogs in town.

939
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,924
Extra mustard, right?

940
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,435
I just joined
the department.

941
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:13,904
I've been observing trials
until I get my own assignment.

942
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:16,073
The thing about
your case is...

943
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,875
None of it seems to add up.

944
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:20,077
I mean, the evidence
is circumstantial.

945
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,680
The police haven't even
looked for any other suspects,

946
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,015
and...

947
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,084
Well, I know this is
really unprofessional,

948
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,587
but...

949
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,856
I just have
a feeling about you.

950
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,892
Nothing suggests you're
capable of a crime like this.

951
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,764
What is it?

952
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:43,501
You're the first person
to say that to me.

953
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:44,969
I don't know what i'm
gonna do now, I...

954
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,704
Don't even have a lawyer.

955
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,173
Well, they'll postpone it
until you can get one.

956
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,808
I have no money.
Well,

957
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:53,611
they'll assign you
a public defender.

958
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:54,945
Like you?

959
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:57,147
Me? No, I'm not a lawyer.

960
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,650
Um, I joined the department
as an investigator.

961
00:56:59,684 --> 00:57:03,120
More of a research clerk,
actually.

962
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,889
Uh-huh.

963
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,524
My dad insisted
that I go to law school

964
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:08,092
to have something
to fall back on.

965
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,595
But after three good tries,
I finally gave up

966
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:12,062
on passing the bar.

967
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,231
I only wanted to be
a writer anyway.

968
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,166
But the least I can do
is make some phone calls.

969
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,703
Make sure you get
a good lawyer.

970
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:28,679
No.

971
00:57:28,713 --> 00:57:30,881
No?

972
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:33,851
I don't wanna leave my life up
to another stranger.

973
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:37,021
I can't.

974
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:38,956
I'm gonna ask to handle
my own defense.

975
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,892
Oh, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

976
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:43,861
No, I mean, I've been
taking notes the whole time.

977
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,896
I know what Flynn did wrong.
All along, I've wished

978
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:49,066
I could stand up in court
and ask my own questions.

979
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:52,169
I'm gonna represent myself.

980
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,240
Well...

981
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:58,809
The judge'll
have to approve.

982
00:57:58,843 --> 00:58:00,778
See if you're capable.

983
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,280
I studied law in school,
I'll tell him that.

984
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,982
You really think
this is a good idea?

985
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:07,217
Whatever happens to me
from this point forward,

986
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:09,520
I wanna be
responsible for it.

987
00:58:09,554 --> 00:58:12,557
No, I get it, I do.

988
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,724
Fine.

989
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:15,626
Then just do me one favor.

990
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,828
What?

991
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:19,597
Let me help.

992
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,599
Mrs. Plainview,
I've reviewed

993
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:23,233
your petition to act
as your own counsel

994
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:24,869
for the remainder
of this trial,

995
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:26,136
and while I must say,
you've written

996
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,773
a very impressive
presentation,

997
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:31,308
I have to give you
my standard response,

998
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,979
which is that I strongly
advise you against this.

999
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,847
I appreciate that,
your honor.

1000
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:38,883
But I feel confident
that I can handle it.

1001
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:42,319
I certainly feel I can do better
than my previous counsel.

1002
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,289
Very well. Petition granted.

1003
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:47,992
You've asked for
ten days to prepare,

1004
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:51,061
and the court grants you
the full ten days.

1005
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:54,164
Thank you, your honor.

1006
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:15,152
The camera was here,
right?
Yeah.

1007
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:27,197
Hey, it looks...

1008
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:38,776
Somewhere around here.

1009
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:14,779
Hi, sweetie. I miss you.

1010
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:16,847
I'm sorry I've been so busy.

1011
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:18,916
Everything's taking
longer than I thought.

1012
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:22,152
How you doing?

1013
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:23,688
Listen, um,

1014
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,355
it would mean
a lot to me if you

1015
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,091
could come to the trial.

1016
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:30,194
We're back in court
on Wednesday.

1017
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:38,035
Honey, I know you're upset.

1018
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:40,004
And I know this
is really hard for you.

1019
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:41,906
But I just want you
to know that you are

1020
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:43,841
the most precious thing to me

1021
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:45,242
in the entire world,

1022
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:47,244
and you always will be.

1023
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,780
Okay?

1024
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:51,849
I love you.

[Door lock scrapes]

1026
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,947
Hey.

1027
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,449
I... couldn't get
the door open.

1028
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:29,319
I changed the locks.

1029
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:33,223
Why didn't you tell me
you were seeing Faye Walker?

1030
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:36,994
I didn't want you
to get hurt.

1031
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,797
I was ashamed.

1032
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,733
Afraid, you know, I...

1033
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:45,302
I didn't know what
would happen if it came out.

1034
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:50,107
I've already been suspended
by the department.

1035
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,508
You need to tell me
if you know anything

1036
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,010
about what happened to her.

1037
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,245
No, Ellen,
I don't know anything.

1038
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:57,782
All right? I swear.

1039
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,485
I am so sorry

01:02:01,518 --> 01:02:03,487
about everything,

okay?

1042
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,225
You've ripped
our daughter's life apart.

1043
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:11,228
And I don't think I can
ever forgive you for that.

Hi.

1055

You said your daughter
plays tennis, right?

Uh-huh?
My parents got me this.

but I suck on the courts.

1059
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,436
I never use the thing.

1060
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:54,371
I thought maybe
Julie would want it?

1061
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:58,342
Thank you,
that's very sweet.

1062
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:03,413
All right, we are back

1063
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:06,183
in the matter of the people
vs. Ellen plainview.

1064
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:08,886
Assault with attempt
to commit murder.

1065
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:10,254
Court has granted a motion

1066
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:13,157
by the defendant
to represent herself.

1067
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:14,959
Mrs. Plainview,

1068
01:03:14,992 --> 01:03:16,393
you've carefully considered

1069
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:18,228
the recommendations

1070
01:03:18,262 --> 01:03:21,265
and caveats of this court
in response to your motion?

1071
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,466
Yes, your honor.

1072
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:24,034
Very well.
Would you please

1073
01:03:24,068 --> 01:03:26,436
identify the gentleman
sitting next to you?

1074
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,306
Ben saverin, with
the public defender's office.

1075
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,607
He's serving
as an investigator

1076
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,409
for the defense.

1077
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:36,180
And Ms. Sullivan,
is this acceptable to you?

1078
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:39,283
Why not?

1079
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:40,617
Shall we proceed?

1080
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,619
Ms. Sullivan, call
your first witness.

1081
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,222
The people would like
to call Ms. Frances dowd.

1082
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:46,556
Who?

1083
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,192
Um...

1084
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:50,094
Uh...

1085
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:53,163
Your honor, this is the first
we've heard of this witness.

1086
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:55,132
The people notified
the defense's counsel,

1087
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,566
Edward Flynn,
of Ms. Dowd's testimony

1088
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,102
two weeks ago, your honor.

1089
01:03:58,135 --> 01:03:59,369
She wasn't included

1090
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:01,438
in Mr. Flynn's notes,
your honor.

1091
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:05,409
I'm not surprised.

1092
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:07,411
Who is Frances dowd?

1093
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:10,047
Someone from my past.

1094
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,482
So?

1095
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:14,351
Years ago,
she told the police

1096
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:17,554
that I attacked her
with a metal rod.

1097
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:21,191
Is it true?

1098
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:22,893
Sort of.

1099
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,232
I was so scared.
I grabbed my music stand

1100
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:29,533
to try to protect myself,

1101
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:31,902
but I didn't hit anyone
with it, I swear.

1102
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:34,138
Then a policeman showed up,
asked what was going on.

1103
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:35,605
It was their word
against mine.

1104
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,407
He took down the report
and just asked us

1105
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:39,209
to stay away from
each other. That's it.

1106
01:04:39,243 --> 01:04:41,211
That's all that happened.

1107
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:42,612
But she came
all the way down here

1108
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:45,482
to testify against you. Why?

1109
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:49,253
I don't know.

1110
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:52,189
Probably the first time
she's ever been in an airplane.

1111
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:55,392
She lived in
the worst part of town.

1112
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:57,494
In a terrible little house.

1113
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:59,696
I think you should
ask for a continuance.

1114
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,165
Give me time
to find something

1115
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:04,001
to impeach this woman's
testimony with.

1116
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,902
I'm just gonna talk to her.

1117
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:12,242
Do you know what may have
provoked such a savage attack?

1118
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:14,144
I have no idea.

1119
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:17,014
It was like something
just come over her.

1120
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:19,483
I seriously thought
she was gonna kill me.

1121
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,185
That must have been
very terrifying.

1122
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:24,221
It was.

1123
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,390
Your witness.

1124
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:33,563
First of all, Ms. Dowd,
thank you for taking

1125
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:37,401
time out of your busy schedule
to be with us here today.

1126
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,503
Gotta respect the law.

1127
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:41,371
That's true.

1128
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:44,508
But the law is a construct.

1129
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:48,278
Something created
in the minds of men.

1130
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:51,581
Justice, on the other hand,

1131
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,151
is something
we feel in our hearts.

1132
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:57,754
Don't you agree?

1133
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,157
We're here for justice.

1134
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,758
You might say
it's the sole purpose

1135
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,427
of these proceedings.

1136
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,763
Do you have children,
Ms. Dowd?

1137
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,365
Three.

1138
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:10,467
You're very blessed.

1139
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,369
I have one myself.

1140
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:14,504
Julie is twelve.

1141
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:19,209
She'll have to live
with whatever happens

1142
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:21,445
in this courtroom.

1143
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,283
Many years ago,
a couple of teenage girls

1144
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,418
got into an argument
in a parking lot.

1145
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:31,188
Words were exchanged,
emotions got a little heated.

1146
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:32,622
Silly threats were made.

1147
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:35,125
And then suddenly
a policeman showed up.

1148
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,361
Nobody wanted
to get in trouble.

1149
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:39,496
Now, according to his report,

1150
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,331
you stated
that I attacked you

1151
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:43,367
with a music stand.

1152
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,634
That's right.

1153
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,703
But the report makes

1154
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,273
no mention of injuries.

1155
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:51,241
Did you sustain injuries?

1156
01:06:51,275 --> 01:06:54,444
Sustain?

1157
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:56,080
The officer's report states

1158
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,414
that he simply
asked you and I

1159
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,116
to apologize to each other

1160
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:00,817
and to go our separate ways.

1161
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,652
He doesn't seem
to have considered this

1162
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:06,123
a very serious incident.

1163
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:11,261
When you said
you were attacked,

1164
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:13,263
is it possible
that you meant

1165
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:15,532
you just felt attacked,

1166
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:17,234
and you weren't
actually struck

1167
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,203
with a music stand
or anything else?

1168
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:21,305
I know the prosecutor
flew you out here

1169
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:23,340
and put you in a nice hotel
so you could testify.

1170
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:26,076
But all you're obligated
to do here today, Ms. Dowd,

1171
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,412
is tell the truth.

1172
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,180
Tell the truth.

1173
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:33,650
And let justice be served.

1174
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,652
Were you actually struck

1175
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:38,688
with a music stand
that day or not?

1176
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:52,702
Okay, I don't remember
exactly what happened.

1177
01:07:58,475 --> 01:08:00,777
Thank you.

1178
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,585
Good morning,
detective sanford.

1179
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,187
Howdy.

1180
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,755
In the interest
of expediency,

1181
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:13,890
I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.

1182
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,526
If you could contain your
answers to a simple yes or no,

1183
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,895
I think we'd
all be appreciative.

1184
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,765
Well, we'll see
what we can do.

1185
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:24,168
The people submitted
security camera footage

1186
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:26,303
from the garage
where the crime occurred.

1187
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:30,240
Now, the video showed
my car exiting at 9:40 pm.

1188
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:32,642
However, there is no camera

1189
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:34,544
at the garage's entrance.

1190
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:37,281
So it's possible
that another car

1191
01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:38,682
could've entered the garage

1192
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:40,517
and then exited
through the entrance

1193
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,452
without being
captured on video.

1194
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:44,454
Isn't that correct?

1195
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:46,623
Is it possible? I suppose.

1196
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:47,924
Yes or no?

1197
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,859
It's possible.

1198
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:52,796
So we can't know for sure

1199
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:55,799
who else was in that garage
besides the victim?

1200
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:57,501
Correct?

1201
01:08:57,534 --> 01:08:58,868
Well, we can't,
but we got

1202
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:01,638
a pretty good idea.

1203
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:05,342
And since I walked to my car
after my exercise class,

1204
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,810
there's no way of knowing

1205
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:10,714
exactly when
I entered the garage.

1206
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:12,349
Detective sanford,
I told you

1207
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:13,717
during my
initial questioning

1208
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,319
that I took a walk
to cool off

1209
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:17,354
before returning to my car.

1210
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:18,588
Based on the evidence,

1211
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:19,923
it's entirely possible

1212
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:21,858
that I was
only in that garage

1213
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,528
for a few moments.
Isn't that right?

1214
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:27,631
It's possible.

1215
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,267
Good. According
to the prosecution,

1216
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,436
strands of hair found
on the victim's person

1217
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:34,638
were found to match
my own hair, correct?

1218
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,740
That's right,
all the DNA tests

1219
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:37,941
were positive.

1220
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:40,410
But we know that my husband,

1221
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:42,912
police officer
Michael plainview,

1222
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:45,282
admitted to having
a sexual relationship

1223
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:47,717
with Faye Walker.

1224
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,653
Is it possible,
in your opinion,

1225
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,988
that Mr. Plainview
might've inadvertently

1226
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,558
transferred hair from
my person or my clothing

1227
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:56,626
to this woman
with whom he was having

1228
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,762
an intimate
physical relationship?

1229
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:03,833
Yes or no?

1230
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:07,771
Your honor?

1231
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:10,407
Detective,
answer the question.

1232
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,812
Yes.

1233
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:22,319
People's exhibit 22
is a tire iron

1234
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:24,388
of the type provided
as standard equipment

1235
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:25,922
in the year and model
of car that I owned

1236
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,425
and was driving
on the night of the crime.

1237
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,460
Now, this distinctive Ridge
matches wounds

1238
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:31,761
found on the victim,
correct?

1239
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:34,598
You bet it does.

1240
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:37,000
But were you aware,
detective sanford,

1241
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:39,536
that this car company,
in the last four years,

1242
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,706
sold over 260,000 cars

1243
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,642
with this identical
tire iron?

1244
01:10:48,512 --> 01:10:50,480
Detective hamer,
Faye Walker

1245
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:52,316
is or was an escort,
correct?

1246
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:54,518
A prostitute.

1247
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:55,819
Did you or anyone
in your department

1248
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:57,721
attempt to contact
any of Ms. Walker's

1249
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,356
recent clients?

1250
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:01,591
We had no cause.

1251
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:02,859
No cause?

1252
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:04,828
The woman was nearly
beaten to death.

1253
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:07,497
It didn't occur to you that one
of her clients might've done it?

1254
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:10,934
All of the evidence
suggested one suspect.

1255
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:14,604
And I'm satisfied
we arrested the right person.

1256
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:16,840
Well, as long as
you're satisfied,

1257
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:18,775
detective.

1258
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:30,920
Mrs. Bracketss,
you testified that

1259
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:32,656
you were driving down
oak street at approximately

1260
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:35,592
9:45 on the night
of April 7th.

1261
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,827
And that you observed me
wiping off something

1262
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:39,963
and tossing it
into a dumpster.

1263
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:41,498
That's right.

1264
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:43,700
What speed would you say
you were driving?

1265
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:45,935
I always drive
the speed limit.

1266
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,338
I'm gonna show you
defense exhibit 16.

1267
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:50,774
Video taken from a car
passing that same alleyway

1268
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,543
traveling at less than
half the speed limit.

1269
01:11:53,577 --> 01:11:55,311
Watch carefully,
Mrs. Bracketss.

1270
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:06,089
Can you tell us what
you saw in the video?

1271
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:08,425
Someone by the dumpster.

1272
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:11,895
Can you identify the person?

1273
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:13,497
No.

1274
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:16,633
Say whether it was
a man or a woman?

1275
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:20,036
Can you at least tell us
what the person was holding?

1276
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:23,006
No.
No idea?

1277
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,708
Maybe if I saw it again.

1278
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,110
But your testimony is that,
on the night of April 7th,

1279
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:29,713
you were able
to positively identify me,

1280
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:32,048
standing in that same alley,
at the same time of night.

1281
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:34,584
And you were able to determine
exactly what I was doing

1282
01:12:34,618 --> 01:12:36,553
in the span of
approximately two seconds.

1283
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:38,422
While traveling at
more than twice the speed

1284
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:40,590
of the car in that video.

1285
01:12:40,624 --> 01:12:42,058
Why don't I play
the video again,

1286
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,694
pause it, and zoom in
so we can get a better look?

1287
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,906
[Audience laughs]

1288
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,844
No further questions.

1289
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:10,954
You might wanna
take a look at this.

1290
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,459
Oh, that's great.
Mm-hmm.

1291
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:16,860
Your honor,

1292
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,428
the people have
obtained an additional

1293
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:20,864
piece of evidence
that we wish to enter.

1294
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:24,534
We'd better handle this
in sidebar, counsel.

1295
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:33,610
Your honor,
a secondary search

1296
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:34,878
of the defendant's
car turned up

1297
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,947
a previously undiscovered
piece of evidence.

1298
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,683
Investigators
found a photograph

1299
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:42,486
hidden under the liner
of the trunk.

1300
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:44,521
It was apparently
taken with a cell phone

1301
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:45,889
and then printed out.

1302
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,558
Let me see this.

1303
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,506
May I have a moment with
my investigator, your honor?

1304
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:04,007
Certainly.

1305
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,175
Thank you.

1306
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:13,517
I've never seen that
photograph before, Ben.

1307
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,251
It's obvious
someone's framing me.

1308
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,787
But who? Your husband?

1309
01:14:17,821 --> 01:14:19,556
Mike may be despicable,
but something like this

1310
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:21,791
is beyond even him,
I'm sure of it.

1311
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:23,960
You need to ask
for a continuance.

1312
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:26,095
No. One way or another,

1313
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,131
this thing has to end now.

1314
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:35,872
You testified thathamer,

1315
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:37,173
your investigation
into this crime

1316
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,608
was thorough and complete.

1317
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:39,909
Yes.

1318
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:42,712
So why did you
search the car again?

1319
01:14:42,746 --> 01:14:44,147
Well, we received a tip.

1320
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,750
Well, not exactly a tip.

1321
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:49,886
We got a call from
an anonymous citizen.

1322
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:52,188
Who watches a lot
of those crime shows on TV.

1323
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,691
They suggested that
we look under the carpeting

1324
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:57,894
and under the trunk lining
of the car, so we did.

1325
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,629
An anonymous tip?

1326
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:02,599
Happens all the time.
Citizens like to help.

1327
01:15:02,632 --> 01:15:05,101
Did you find anything to connect
this photograph to me?

1328
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:07,270
Finger prints, for example,
or a match to my cell phone

1329
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:09,573
or home computer?
It was in your car.

1330
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:11,107
How do we know the photograph
wasn't placed in the car

1331
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,709
subsequent to the crime?

1332
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:15,111
Well, that's impossible.
Impossible.

1333
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:18,582
The car has been
in police impound ever since.

1334
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:25,154
The defense rests.

1335
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,857
Thank you, Mrs. Plainview.

1336
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:30,660
We'll give you time to prepare
your closing arguments

1337
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,862
and will reconvene
after lunch.

1338
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:36,600
Court is adjourned.

1339
01:15:38,835 --> 01:15:40,704
What is it?

1340
01:15:40,737 --> 01:15:42,939
Maybe I did do it!

1341
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:45,208
It's the only
logical explanation!

1342
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:48,144
Who else could it have been?
It had to be me!

1343
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:50,213
Maybe I found out
about the affair,

1344
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:52,215
and I followed Mike,
and I took that picture,

1345
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:53,950
and I attacked Faye Walker!

1346
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,885
And then I blocked it
all out of my head.

1347
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:58,588
Maybe I went
temporarily insane!

1348
01:15:58,622 --> 01:16:00,757
Maybe I am insane!

1349
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,659
Ellen, stop it.

1350
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:05,895
What you've been through
would've made anyone crazy.

1351
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:09,733
You-- you are the most
level-headed person I know.

1352
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:11,968
And whatever happens,
I know you're gonna have

1353
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,638
the strength to get
through it, I promise.

1354
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,109
Mom?

1355
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:23,212
Julie!

1356
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:24,748
What are you doing here?

1357
01:16:24,781 --> 01:16:26,082
Jasmine's mom
dropped me off.

1358
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:27,350
I wanna come home.

1359
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:30,253
I'm so sorry.
What for?

1360
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:32,188
For not being here for you.

1361
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:34,157
I was too scared.

1362
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:37,260
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.

1363
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:40,396
And I found out
Jasmine stole my fishnets.

1364
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,865
I guess she's not
that great of a friend

1365
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:43,132
after all.

1366
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,968
But I let her
keep them anyway.

1367
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:48,271
'Cause she looks
so stupid in them.

1368
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:50,173
Thanks for the tennis racket,
Mr. Saverin.

1369
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:51,975
Sure.

1370
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:56,846
All right, guys.
It's time to get back inside.

1371
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,315
I'm coming with you.

1372
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:02,786
Honey, I don't know what's
gonna happen in there.

1373
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:04,954
It might be better--
I'm coming with you.

1374
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:17,701
Let's do this.

1375
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:33,116
Mrs. Plainview, summation?

1376
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,372
My daughter once told me,

1377
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,141
"you can't make
bad things go away

1378
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,409
by pretending
they don't exist."

1379
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,949
Something bad happened here.

1380
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:08,351
And we all
want it to go away.

1381
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:11,821
When we can't make sense
of a senseless thing like this,

1382
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:15,358
we place blame and move on,
hoping to convince ourselves

1383
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:16,993
it wasn't a random
act of violence

1384
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,461
which is somehow
the scariest thing,

1385
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:21,497
because that means
it could've been any of us.

1386
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,299
Now, we crave

1387
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:25,802
some explanation.

1388
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:29,205
But in our hurry, we can
Rob ourselves of understanding.

1389
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:32,108
When we are too quick
to end our search for the truth,

1390
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:34,710
we are weakened,
we are hurt.

1391
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:39,515
I don't know
who attacked Faye Walker,

1392
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:42,919
and I don't know why.

1393
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:46,255
I don't know that I've
been able to convince you
that I wasn't involved.

1394
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:53,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
I will accept whatever
happens to me here today,

1395
01:18:53,863 --> 01:18:56,399
because I have to.

1396
01:18:56,432 --> 01:19:00,069
But what would be much,
much more difficult to accept

1397
01:19:00,103 --> 01:19:03,439
is that the person
actually responsible
might escape justice

1398
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:07,376
in our rush to be done
with this terrible event.

1399
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:12,281
That's something I believe
any reasonable person

1400
01:19:12,315 --> 01:19:15,551
would find hard
to live with.

1402
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,489

1403
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:22,525
Well...

1404
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:28,231
Thank you.

[Sighs]

1412
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:17,613
Of the crime of assault
with intent to murder
Faye Jo Walker.

1413
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:18,948
[Chuckles]

1414
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:21,050
Case dismissed.

1415
01:20:21,084 --> 01:20:23,920
[Murmuring]

1416
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:43,306
Thanks for everything, Ben.

1417
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,041
Will I see you again?

1418
01:20:46,943 --> 01:20:50,313
Sure. I'd like that.

1419
01:20:59,155 --> 01:21:01,457
Bye.

1420
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:03,392
[Sighs]

1421
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:13,436
[Door closes, engine starts]

1422
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:21,277
[Sighs]

1423
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:24,680
Mom, I know what daddy did,

1424
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,382
and I know why
he's not here anymore.

1425
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:29,185
But it's okay.
I understand.

1426
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,354
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1427
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:34,390
You don't have to apologize
for anything.

1428
01:21:34,423 --> 01:21:37,360
But promise me one thing.
Anything.

1429
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,428
Can we spend
more time together?

1430
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:42,398
Of course.

1431
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:51,140
There's something
I need to do first.

1432
01:22:10,994 --> 01:22:12,996
Faye?
[Phone beeping]

1433
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:24,974
Hey, it's Mike.
I looked into that
traffic ticket.

1434
01:22:25,008 --> 01:22:27,743
I can't believe it was Paula
who wrote you up.

1435
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,745
Six months sharing
a patrol car together,

1436
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,614
you'd think she'd show me
a little courtesy, huh?

1437
01:22:33,349 --> 01:22:36,419
Anyway, I never
mentioned her to you,

1438
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:40,723
because I didn't think
you'd like that I had
a female partner.

1439
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:43,692
But, uh, I paid
that traffic ticket for you,

1440
01:22:43,726 --> 01:22:46,562
so...

1441
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:50,533
Well, uh, good luck.

1442
01:22:52,735 --> 01:22:56,105
Wow. My husband
usually takes care of that.
He must've forgotten.

1443
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:58,407
He works for the department.
Mike plainview.
Do you know him?

1444
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:01,510
No, I don't believe I do.
Just one minute, okay?

1445
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:05,981
Bates.

1446
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:11,220
Faye?

1447
01:23:11,254 --> 01:23:13,722
You were supposed
to be in prison.

1448
01:23:15,424 --> 01:23:17,626
You know, I really wasn't
expecting to find you here,

1449
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:21,030
but... this actually works out.

1450
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:25,134
Like it was meant to be,
you know?

1451
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:26,769
It's perfect.

1452
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:30,439
You see, the perp-- you--

1453
01:23:30,473 --> 01:23:33,176
returns to the hospital
to make sure the victim

1454
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:35,444
doesn't wake up
and identify her.

1455
01:23:35,478 --> 01:23:39,282
[Moans]

1456
01:23:39,315 --> 01:23:41,617
You were even kind enough
to leave me fingerprints.

1457
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:44,353
Thank you.
Let's go.

1458
01:23:57,233 --> 01:23:59,268
Where are we going?

1459
01:23:59,302 --> 01:24:01,437
Get in.

1460
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:02,771
[Button clicks]
Come here.

1461
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:05,108
[Bell dings]
Come here, now!

1462
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:08,711
You know,
when we were partners,

1463
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:12,248
I fell for Mike
really hard.

1464
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:15,418
I didn't plan it,
but it happens.

1465
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:17,420
And he felt the same.

1466
01:24:17,453 --> 01:24:19,488
I know he did.

1467
01:24:19,522 --> 01:24:22,791
But he told me
he couldn't cheat on his wife.

1468
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:26,729
Then I found out
he was seeing that whore,
Faye Walker.

1469
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:30,799
So I followed them
and took pictures, you know?

1470
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,801
I figured I could force him
to stop seeing her,

1471
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:36,539
but that left a wife
to take care of.

1472
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,707
So I had a better idea.
[Bell dings]

1473
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,477
You bitch.
Go! Go!

1474
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:45,414
Keep moving.

1475
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:49,605
All right, I can do this.

1476
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:51,740
Really? That's great.

1477
01:26:52,841 --> 01:26:54,410
Okay, I got it.

1478
01:26:54,443 --> 01:26:57,313
Mom, try to stay off your
back foot when you swing,

1479
01:26:57,346 --> 01:27:00,516
and make sure the head
of the racket is lower
than the handle.

1480
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:01,950
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

1481
01:27:01,984 --> 01:27:03,719
Thanks for calling.

1482
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:05,421
Hey, I got good news.

1483
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:09,892
The hospital just called.

1484
01:27:09,925 --> 01:27:11,994
Faye Walker
is in physical therapy.

1485
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:13,562
They said it'll take a while,

1486
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:14,863
but she'll make
a full recovery.

1487
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:16,332
That's great.

1488
01:27:16,365 --> 01:27:17,866
Mom has good news, too.

1489
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:18,967
Yeah?

1490
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:20,836
I have decided
to go to law school.

1491
01:27:22,305 --> 01:27:24,273
I've got an idea
for my first book.

1492
01:27:24,307 --> 01:27:25,641
My story?

1493
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,812
Nobody'd ever believe it.

1494
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:33,048
Mind if I take your mom
to lunch?

1495
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,318
Only if I can come, too.

1496
01:27:35,351 --> 01:27:37,853
Gee, I don't know.
What do you think?

1497
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:40,389
All right, fine.
Come on, let's go.

1498
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:41,690
Ha ha! Let's go.

1499
01:27:41,724 --> 01:27:43,859
Come on. Good job.
Let's go.
