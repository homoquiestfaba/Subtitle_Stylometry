1
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:16,849
Want to come in?

2
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:18,117
I got to go.

3
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:21,353
Oh, five more minutes?
All right.

4
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:23,455
(electronic gunshots)

5
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:24,156
Turn it off.

6
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:25,057
I'm not going
to say it again.

7
00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:27,926
Dad, just five more minutes
and I'll be on level nine.

8
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:28,861
Now!

9
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:29,995
Dad!

10
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:31,864
You said I can watch
Nickelodeon.

11
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:33,665
You've watched enough TV
for tonight.

12
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:34,700
It's time to go to bed.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,535
How come he doesn't have to?

14
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,662
Both of you, bed now!

15
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:43,475
Dad!

16
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:44,977
You got to save it first.

17
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:46,968
This game saves it
automatically.

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,884
Oh, no, no, you know

19
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,613
how much sugar's
in that thing?

20
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,054
Get down!

21
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,488
(gunshots)

22
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:03,095
Son, are you all right?

23
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:04,687
(car tires squealing)

24
00:01:05,697 --> 00:01:06,598
Aimee?

25
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:08,400
Aimee! Aimee!

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,958
Aimee?

27
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:23,582
Hey.

28
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:25,717
Didn't you grow up
in this neighborhood?

29
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:26,518
Yeah, not too far away.

30
00:01:26,518 --> 00:01:28,587
My grandmother still
lives down the block.

31
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:29,254
Lot of familiar faces.

32
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:31,957
Hey, Brown, you going to
find the guy who did this?

33
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:33,515
We're going to do our jobs.

34
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,961
Jason Gilbert.
Shot through and through.

35
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:38,230
He's going to be
all right, though.

36
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,431
What was he doing here?

37
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:41,733
Visiting his girlfriend
next door. He hit the deck

38
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:44,736
when the shooting started.
Didn't see a car.

39
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:45,504
Drive-by.

40
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:47,539
His girlfriend
see anything?

41
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,741
Nobody saw a thing.

42
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:52,511
Little girl inside
wasn't so lucky.

43
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:55,614
Aimee Phelps,
age nine.

44
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:56,048
Phelps?

45
00:01:56,048 --> 00:02:00,451
Father operates a rec center
down the block.

46
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,288
What happened, man?

47
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,530
They killed my baby.

48
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,164
(sobs)

49
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:15,258
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:18,728
I got here as quick
as I could.

51
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:20,038
What happened?

52
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:23,475
Oops said they were aiming
at some white kid.

53
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:26,812
I thought I was making
a difference.

54
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:27,546
(sobs)

55
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,781
You are making
a difference.

56
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:31,049
I'm living proof.

57
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,142
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,982
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,611
You going to be able
to handle this?

60
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:49,592
I want this case.

70
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:25,163
Matt told me his house was
broken into about a week ago.

71
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:27,833
They took all of his awards,
his medals.

72
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,893
Everything in his case.

73
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:32,437
I hope whoever took it,

74
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,407
it meant as much
to them as it did to him.

75
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,309
(sighs)

76
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:39,811
Well, we're obviously
looking for an automatic.

77
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:43,144
No doubt.
All this damage.

78
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:45,651
The bullets went
through the glass,

79
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,718
shed their jackets

80
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:49,915
or disintegrated completely
on impact with the wall.

81
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:55,422
All we have left are
lead cores, which are
of no comparison value.

82
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:00,666
The only bullet
that may help us

83
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,725
is inside that little girl.

84
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,404
HyperTrix?

85
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,239
Sounds like
a breakfast cereal.

86
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,740
Some Internet
service thing.

87
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,441
I stopped thinking

88
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:11,476
about that stuff when
I found out my NASDAQ fund

89
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:14,313
was worth less than my son's
comic book collection.

90
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,180
Dot com, dot bomb.

91
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,449
The office floor
where the DB's located

92
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,152
is restricted...
authorized employees only.

93
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,286
I'll need the access log.

94
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:24,723
I already spoke
to building security.

95
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:26,918
Cool.

96
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:34,466
Night shift started
at 6:00 p.m.

97
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,267
And since then,

98
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,402
four people have entered
the building,

99
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:38,503
and nobody left.

100
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,199
Three of them are
still breathing.

101
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,866
(beeping)

102
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:47,846
Ooh.

103
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:49,214
Hey, David.
Nick.

104
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:51,316
Cool enough
in here for you?

105
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:51,850
I'll manage.

106
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,819
Most computers dissipate over
two thirds

107
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,687
of the energy
they consume as heat.

108
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:56,688
AO's here for them,

109
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,824
not the worker bees.

110
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:00,192
Victim's name's Garret Kwan.

111
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:00,992
Job title, OTO.

112
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:02,728
Chief Technology Officer.

113
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,355
T.O.D.?

114
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,866
Ambient here's
about 65 degrees,

115
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:12,204
which makes core temp drop
roughly two degrees per hour.

116
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:15,340
Figure he's been dead
five to seven hours.

117
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,875
Apparent blunt
force trauma.

118
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,378
Minimal seepage
around the wound.

119
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,279
No blood on the floor.

120
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,281
The paramedics roll him?

121
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:23,749
Uh, yeah.

122
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,718
Said they found him face down,
head towards the rack.

123
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,453
Any sign of a weapon?

124
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:29,721
Nothing obvious.

125
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:30,555
No windows.

126
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:31,556
Only one way in or out.

127
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:34,559
Yeah, but there's plenty
of places to hide.

128
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,895
(groans)

129
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,530
Okay.
One dead boss.

130
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,725
Three live employees.

131
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,892
I like the odds.

132
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,740
So, Jason Gilbert,

133
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,408
the kid who was shot,

134
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,742
not too popular
in the neighborhood.

135
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:53,445
Just in a fight last week,
down the street.

136
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:54,446
Yeah?

137
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:55,313
Uh-huh.

138
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:56,581
You saw his girl.

139
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:57,549
She was hot.

140
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,574
They're probably
macking on her.

141
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:02,788
Matt said he heard
tires screech.

142
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:03,255
Mm-hmm.

143
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:05,557
And the bullets went
from right to left.

144
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,787
Uh-huh.

145
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:11,257
There?

146
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,003
You know, it's
a federal offense

147
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,438
to mess with
the postal service.

148
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:22,574
Took that corner
pretty hard, huh?

149
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,269
Yeah.

150
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:40,625
Doesn't that dent look
a little high to you?

151
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,456
Like a truck or an SUV?

152
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:46,331
Yeah.

153
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:49,334
I'm not just another
pretty face, you know.

154
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:53,839
There's a silver paint transfer,
though, right here.

155
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,873
Captain.
Yeah?

156
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:55,640
Just got a call.

157
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,808
PJ's tavern, a few block away.

158
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,376
Guy was brandishing
an automatic weapon.

159
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,606
They're holding him
at the site.

160
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:04,616
This guy's a punk.

161
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,518
Hey, tell me
what you're telling him.

162
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:07,319
This guy's no good.

163
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,321
He's been in here before,
and every time it's trouble.

164
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,990
So this time I exercised
my right not to serve him.

165
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,625
You know what
the little freak does?

166
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,628
Lifts up his jacket,
and shows me a piece.

167
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:17,996
I tell him
to take a hike.

168
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:18,864
Yeah?

169
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:20,165
Then he proceeds
to tell me

170
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,467
how I better watch my back,
'cause it wouldn't be

171
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,402
the first time tonight
he killed somebody.

172
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:26,104
No kidding. All right.

173
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,340
Jay...

174
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,074
Jaycobs?

175
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,642
No, it's Gene Jaycobs.

176
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,344
Gene Jaycobs.

177
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,045
I knew that kid.

178
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:35,413
I went to school
with him.

179
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,014
He got kicked out.

180
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:39,050
Okay, let's see what the lad
has to say for himself.

181
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,381
Thanks a lot.

182
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:44,647
Hey, Gene, what's happening?
Uncuff him.

183
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:47,025
Do I know you?

184
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,060
Put your hands out
in front of you.

185
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,858
Oh, it's like that, huh?

186
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,540
I can process this now.

187
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,908
It would tell me
if you fired a gun

188
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:03,875
within the last
couple of hours.

189
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,746
But I'm going to take this
back to the lab,

190
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:08,880
make you sweat it out.

191
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,181
Okay, Officer,

192
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:13,878
I think someone needs
their cuffs put back on.

193
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:17,522
I know what that is.

194
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:19,658
You're checking me
for blood spatter.

195
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:21,426
I watch the Discovery Channel.

196
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,695
Look, I found the body,
I called the police.

197
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:27,465
Not too smart, if I'm the one
who killed the guy.

198
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:29,899
(quietly)
That's good.

199
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:32,571
Not too...

200
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,472
Not too smart,
if I'm the one who...

201
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:38,932
Mr. Benton, could you stand up
for me, please?

202
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,577
I know what that... is.

203
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,522
I know what that is.

204
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,223
You're checking me
for blood spatter.

205
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:56,061
I watch the
Discovery Channel.

206
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:58,096
Look, I... I found the body,
I called the police.

207
00:09:58,096 --> 00:10:01,266
Not too smart, if I'm the
one who killed the guy.

208
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,601
Thanks for pointing that out.

209
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,270
When was the last time
you saw Garret Kwan?

210
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,505
I didn't; not tonight.

211
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:08,073
I was working.

212
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:11,276
Working halfway to
carpal tunnel syndrome.

213
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,445
So-called ergonomic chairs.

214
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:17,575
Should be a crime,
if you ask me.

215
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,452
The chairs are...
okay, you know,

216
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:21,987
it's, it's not like my office

217
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,254
has a good view of the door.

218
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,256
You should be
talking to Charlie.

219
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:27,592
Charlie has the good view.

220
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:28,752
Charlie?

221
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:34,499
Yeah, okay, yeah,
um, Charlie...

222
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,167
Charlie doesn't
work here anymore,

223
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,502
so that doesn't
really help you.

224
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:40,960
Could you hold your hands
out for me, please?

225
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:45,644
Pretty easy to see the door

226
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:48,213
to the server farm
from here.

227
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:49,614
That is a fact.

228
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,049
And here's another.

229
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,284
I didn't see anything.

230
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:54,185
I was coding.

231
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:56,287
Link. Compile. Debug.

232
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:58,023
All night.

233
00:10:58,023 --> 00:10:59,758
The work absorbs me.

234
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,692
What kind of work?

235
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,661
My code monitors Internet
traffic and server load.

236
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:04,829
So you make

237
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,765
your computer
watch other computers

238
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,266
that other people
are watching?

239
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:11,569
Just because you can't see
the beauty in data flow

240
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:13,238
doesn't mean it
doesn't exist.

241
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:15,540
What was your relationship
to Garret Kwan?

242
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,609
I'm employee number seven.

243
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,611
Kwan was employee number six.

244
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:23,214
Big brain by reputation,

245
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,114
my boss by random chance.

246
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:31,723
You know, they, um,
they confiscated

247
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,025
all my murder weapons
when I left Microsoft,

248
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,360
so I don't know
if you'll find anything.

249
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,763
Yeah, you don't exactly
fit the corporate image.

250
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:40,065
Well, it's my image,

251
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,199
the company doesn't
get a say in it.

252
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,636
Looks like you get special
treatment around here.

253
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,538
Yeah, well, I earn it.

254
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,106
I optimize 'Net infrastructure.

255
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,842
I saved this company
$8.3 mill last year.

256
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:52,577
Got a five-figure bonus.

257
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:55,547
And, uh, yes,
I did see Garret

258
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,716
go into the server farm
around 6:00, 6:30.

259
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,684
So your boss is
laying there dead

260
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:01,619
for five and a
half hours plus,

261
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,849
and you never even
noticed he's gone.

262
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:07,224
Oh... well, I mean,
nobody else did, either.

263
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,562
Look, I was, you know...

264
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:11,596
Working.

265
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:14,099
That is what we do here.

266
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,100
Right.

267
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,102
Bullet entered
through the throat,

268
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:18,670
severing the spinal column.

269
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,072
O2's adjacent
to the brain stem.

270
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:23,842
Sever that, respiration
shuts down,

271
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:27,278
resulting in almost
immediate death.

272
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:31,816
Wood splinters embedded
in the jacket.

273
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:34,842
Well, it went
through a bookcase.

274
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:37,616
Nine millimeter.

275
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,121
Thanks.

276
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:46,789
(muffled automatic gunfire)

277
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,632
(water splashes in tank)

278
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,696
Hey.

279
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,276
(sharp clank)

280
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,122
All right.

281
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:13,124
Bingo.

282
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,859
Your bullet came from that gun.

283
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:16,261
You're sure.

284
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,662
Yeah, I'm sure.

285
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:18,396
We got him.

286
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:20,665
So, Jason Gilbert...
what did he

287
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,834
ever do to you?
Drawing a blank.

288
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:26,171
The kid you shot!
I didn't shoot nobody, man.

289
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:26,871
Jason's girlfriend told us

290
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:28,139
that you were practically
stalking her.

291
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,374
She must have turned you down
a hundred times.

292
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:31,810
You didn't like that, did you?
Is that what she told you?

293
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,811
Yeah.
Lying bitch!

294
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,802
I found that gun!

295
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,649
Damn.

296
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:38,850
Gun was jammed,

297
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,751
I cleared it.

298
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:40,685
You cleared it,
all right...

299
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:43,188
into Mr. Phelps's home,
killing his daughter!

300
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,656
No, it was the last bullet.

301
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,323
What are you talking about?

302
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:46,825
You threatened a bartender
with an empty gun?

303
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,393
He didn't know that.

304
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:50,328
I can show you where I found it:

305
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:51,963
Alleyway behind
Washington Avenue,

306
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,666
(over speaker)
Next to a big
yellow dumpster.

307
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,834
Oh, come on.

308
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,901
That's it?

309
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:59,170
That's his genius story?

310
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,208
We only found a small amount
of GSR on his hands.

311
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,409
It could have been transfer

312
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:07,345
from just picking up
the murder weapon.

313
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,677
He's lying.

314
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,188
(indistinct
radio transmissions)

315
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:20,358
Our shooter isn't only a liar,
he's a thief.

316
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:21,192
Found tons of electronic

317
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,994
equipment in there,
still in the boxes.

318
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:26,865
Well, either he's buying in
bulk, or that stuff's hot.

319
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:27,899
No guns or ammo.

320
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,493
But I do have his car keys.

321
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,753
(car alarm chirps)

322
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:10,008
I'm afraid the only bullets
in here are silver bullets.

323
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:11,743
I may have something here.

324
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:13,311
The shooter's vehicle

325
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:13,945
took out a mailbox.

326
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,814
The dent's in
the right spot,
and the car

327
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:18,049
is the right silver color.

328
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,251
You got any paint transfer?

329
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,853
Nothing visible.

330
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:25,390
Call auto detail.
We'll tow it back to the lab.

331
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,791
Blow came from an object

332
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,527
roughly rectangular
in shape, resulting in

333
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:30,995
a depressed fracture
of the parietal bone,

334
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:33,464
with radiating linear
fractures extending outward

335
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:34,432
from the point of impact.

336
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:35,934
Based on the
fracture pattern,

337
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,436
I'd say it was a single
strike to the head.

338
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:40,939
Explains the lack of spatter
at the scene.

339
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,273
First hit's free.

340
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,108
Killer knew what
he was doing.

341
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:47,078
And, uh, take a look at this.

342
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:47,979
Black plastic.

343
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:48,846
Found it in the wound.

344
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:53,408
Possible transfer
from a murder weapon?

345
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:57,455
(kids talking, whistle blows)

346
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:59,082
Hustle.

347
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:03,020
Come on, let's go!

348
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:05,430
Hey.

349
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,092
I heard you
got the shooter.

350
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:10,835
It's not that simple.

351
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,403
You think it's him?

352
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:16,074
We got all our guys on
this, Matt, all right?

353
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:17,632
Yeah.

354
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,647
You still using them
same old uniforms?

355
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,515
That stuff's expensive, man.

356
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:25,350
Yeah.

357
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,388
But we managed to get the
basketball court tarmacked,

358
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:32,824
thanks to contributions
from folk like you.

359
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,926
Hey, I ain't stupid.

360
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,127
I know where I came from.

361
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,629
I wouldn't be anywhere,
if it weren't for this place.

362
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,098
Well, you was
always going places.

363
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:42,600
You just lacked discipline.

364
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,135
Still do.

365
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:47,638
I don't recognize
this ugly-ass gang symbol.

366
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:51,876
You know, it's, it's hard
to keep up with it all.

367
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:53,111
I just don't know anymore.

368
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:55,046
What with all
the break-ins...

369
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:55,646
Break-ins?!

370
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:58,349
Rec Center's van was
stolen a couple days ago.

371
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,184
How am I going to
tell these kids

372
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,353
that they can't play
in the semifinals

373
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:05,550
'cause I got no way
of getting them there?

374
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:09,093
I'll look into it
for you, all right?

375
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:10,993
We'll get them there.

376
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,065
Yeah.

377
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:16,863
When's Aimee's service?

378
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:20,538
Wednesday.

379
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:24,201
Matt, if there's
anything I can do...

380
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:28,546
Just get me five minutes
alone with the shooter.

381
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:29,914
Just five minutes.

382
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,149
Look, I know

383
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,418
it's not going
to bring Aimee back...

384
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:34,919
but I can't sleep at night,

385
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,878
knowing that he's still
breathing out there.

386
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:42,393
Can you?

387
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:45,885
(cell phone ringing)

388
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:48,433
Brown.

389
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:49,934
Jaycobs has an alibi.

390
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,235
What?

391
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,037
Meet me at P.D.

392
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,172
How you holding up, man?

393
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:57,642
I haven't slept in days;
not in days.

394
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:58,509
Mr. Phelps,

395
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:00,411
it's good to see you again, sir.

396
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:02,480
Would you excuse us a moment?

397
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,607
Warrick.

398
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,085
What's he doing here?

399
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,087
If Jaycobs is going to
slip through our fingers,

400
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:12,123
I need someone else
to explain to him
what went wrong.

401
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,648
This was not a good idea.

402
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,092
That's supposed to be
his alibi?

403
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:19,964
David Artiss.

404
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:21,265
Says he was
with our suspect

405
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:22,266
the night of the drive-by.

406
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,235
Says he dropped him off
at PJ's Tavern

407
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,670
right before we
picked him up.

408
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,238
Says he also saw
him find the Mac.

409
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:31,476
Clothes he slept in,
bloodshot eyes.

410
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:32,243
The guy's a junkie, Grissom.

411
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:35,480
You can see it, I can see it,
and the jury will see it.

412
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,682
DA listened to
the alibi's statement.

413
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,984
He knows it's questionable,
but, uh...

414
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:41,786
But what?
Well, half an hour

415
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:42,620
before the house
was shot up,

416
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,989
Jaycobs and his alibi
were at the Sports Chalet.

417
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,124
Come on.

418
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:47,758
Salesperson remembered
seeing both of them.

419
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:50,261
They bought a baseball bat.
Artiss even has the receipt.

420
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:52,130
Sports Chalet is
ten minutes away.

421
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,131
That's no alibi.

422
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,466
I don't know.
After what the DA heard, he said

423
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:56,634
he's not going to file charges.

424
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,136
Doesn't want the clock to tick.

425
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,270
So that's it?

426
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,305
As easy as that,
he walks.

427
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:02,273
Look at it this way...

428
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:04,308
you have more time
to build your case.

429
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:05,798
Is that him?

430
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,977
Why are they letting him go?
Why are they letting him go?

431
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,518
No!

432
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,686
No!

433
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,088
He can't leave!

434
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,749
Not here. Come on.

435
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:21,993
What are you doing?!

436
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,794
He killed my daughter!

437
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:26,597
Come on, come on.
We'll cool off.

438
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,499
Come on, let's go.

439
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,801
They're going to put Jaycobs
in protective custody

440
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,503
to avoid repercussions
in the community.

441
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,994
Where are we going
to put Warrick?

442
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:37,742
It was a cool-looking office.

443
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:39,744
It was kind of fun
being out in the field.

444
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:43,548
Pulling drives,
collecting evidence...

445
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,016
flashing I.D.

446
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:47,151
I think
I got a flair for it.

447
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:49,153
You bucking
for a promotion?

448
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:51,589
Not bucking...

449
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:52,657
Nudging.

450
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:55,293
You know people put their lives
on these hard drives?

451
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:59,229
Yeah, yeah, that's
what I'm counting on.

452
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:14,744
Hey, Arch.

453
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:18,649
Wow!

454
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:19,717
Serena.

455
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:23,312
Can defrag my hard
drive anytime.

456
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:28,593
Are these, uh,
business e-mails?

457
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,151
I'm a little confused.

458
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,197
No, um...

459
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:35,600
this is actually
harmless fun, so...

460
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,068
Court documents

461
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:39,203
Garret Kwan was suing you
for sexual harassment.

462
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:42,240
Are you, um, familiar
with the term "spurious"?

463
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,835
Are you familiar with the term
"murder suspect"?

464
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:48,346
Look, I was just
trying to let
him know

465
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,915
that I was available, okay?
Low pressure.

466
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:53,117
The guy freaked out,
he thought I was

467
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:54,852
trying to get him into
some bogus lawsuit,

468
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:57,622
so he preempted me
with one of his own.

469
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:59,390
It's called a scare tactic.

470
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,593
Scared to lose your job?

471
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:03,694
Your five-figure bonus?

472
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:04,762
Scared enough to kill him?

473
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:06,697
Okay, look, I was
flirting with the guy.

474
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:10,098
I will e-mail you with
the number from my lawyer.

475
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,607
(cup clatters)

476
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:18,234
(door slams)

477
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:30,621
(hollow clanking)

478
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:33,283
(clanking continues)

479
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,186
This guy's been
in Matt's house.

480
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,221
What is this?

481
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:06,257
Matt's team won this
three years ago.

482
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:09,860
This trophy was given to
the rec center last year.

483
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,863
I found all this stuff
in Jaycobs' car.

484
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,165
Well, if this is evidence,

485
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:15,800
it needs to be tagged
and catalogued.

486
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,336
This is the same guy who shot
Matt's daughter in the head

487
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,838
and he's walking
around laughing at us.

488
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:22,673
Can you prove that?

489
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:23,874
What is this?

490
00:22:23,874 --> 00:22:25,843
I've been putting guys
away like this for years.

491
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:28,512
And now that it matters,
it's like you're

492
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:29,680
holding me back here.

493
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,015
The job, Warrick,

494
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:31,849
is to process evidence...

495
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,284
objectively,
and without prejudice.

496
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:34,452
I'm so tired
of hearing that.

497
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:35,486
I've heard it
a million times.

498
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,488
I can't be like you.
I'm not a robot, okay?

499
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:41,390
I actually care
about these people.

500
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:45,229
You know what?

501
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:46,831
You're not working
on this case anymore.

502
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:48,899
I'll have another assignment
for you tomorrow.

503
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:51,993
Keep it.

504
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:04,515
Where were we?

505
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:06,016
At a dead end.

506
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:08,348
Go back to work.

507
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,256
Hey, Stokes?
Yeah?

508
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:12,890
We got to talk.

509
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,458
Hey, did you I.D.
That scraping

510
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,227
from my vic's
head wound yet?

511
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:18,062
Yeah, yeah,
it's a common plastic,

512
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:19,764
polyethylterephthalate - P.E.T.

513
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:21,899
Used in everything
from garbage bags

514
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:24,402
to magnetic tape
to floppy disks.

515
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:24,935
Okay, thanks.

516
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:27,772
Yeah, but that's not what
I wanted to talk about.

517
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:28,966
What, then?

518
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,578
Look, I thought that
we had a relationship.

519
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:37,281
What are you doing taking
Archie out into the field,

520
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:37,882
instead of me?

521
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:40,951
It's the right tool
for the right job, man.

522
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:42,319
You have to understand

523
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,755
the world you're
investigating.

524
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:46,424
Hey, Archie.

525
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,291
Yeah?

526
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,459
Hey, what's that
Star Trek
episode

527
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:51,061
where the guy's got
the forehead thingy,
and the time portal...?

528
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:56,400
In Classic,
TNG, DS9,
Voyager
or
Enterprise?

529
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,800
Point taken.

530
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:00,838
Or were you thinking
about
Farscape?

531
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:03,007
I have no idea what
you are talking about.

532
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:03,607
It doesn't matter.

533
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:05,309
Look, I got something
to show you here.

534
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,811
I found this
on Anders' computer.

535
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,078
What is this,
a video game?

536
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:10,381
No, it's actually an FRPG:

537
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:11,449
"Fantasy Role-Playing Game."

538
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,351
You see, players use avatars
to represent themselves

539
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:15,085
in a fantasy world.

540
00:24:15,085 --> 00:24:20,591
There's Serena, Todd, and Kwan
in this alternate universe

541
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,426
conjuring up a gateway,

542
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:25,362
which summons a
beast-like Anders...

543
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:27,598
(beast laughing)

544
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:28,933
Who decapitates Kwan.

545
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,836
You know a lot about
this stuff, don't you?

546
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:34,605
Mm-hmm.

547
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:37,130
You got to get a girlfriend.

548
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:39,510
You first.

549
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,578
It was merely a game.

550
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:41,512
An entertainment.

551
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:44,515
Nah, it's more like a place
where you can play God, right?

552
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:46,851
Maybe treat people
the way you wish

553
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:48,452
you could treat them
in real life?

554
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:49,620
Virtual murder
is not quite

555
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,021
as satisfying as
the real thing, is it?

556
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:54,859
You look a little
uncomfortable,
Mr. Molyneaux.

557
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:57,528
Well, this office
is always uncomfortable.

558
00:24:57,528 --> 00:25:00,361
Ventilation sucks.

559
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:04,335
I put Kwan in my game
because I was upset.

560
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:05,169
Upset about what?

561
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,839
I was designing characters
for a new multi-player sim...

562
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,007
on company time.

563
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:13,477
Kwan found out...
somehow.

564
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:15,346
Man always seems
to be one step

565
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:17,014
ahead of his underlings.

566
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:17,481
How?

567
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:19,950
If I'd known, he would've
been working for me.

568
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,388
In this instance,
he informed the board.

569
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:26,390
Unauthorized use
of bandwidth.

570
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,358
Nearly got me fired.

571
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,593
But you didn't
kill him.

572
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:30,561
No.

573
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:33,197
Am I sorry he's gone?

574
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:34,425
No.

575
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,532
(loud clanking)

576
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:45,671
(sighing)

577
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,230
(indistinct radio talk)

578
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,432
What's going on, fellas?

579
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:09,466
Possible burglary.

580
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:10,568
Homeowner's on vacation.

581
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,236
Neighbor called it
in last night.

582
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,671
Just getting around to it.

583
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:16,435
You may have to climb over.

584
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:25,004
What do you think?
Want to give it a try?

585
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:28,516
(gate clanks)

586
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:52,940
(glass tinkling)

587
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:23,132
(dog barking)

588
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:38,153
What have you got?

589
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:40,658
Stovepipe.

590
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,159
Possibly jammed
in our murder weapon.

591
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,595
Never fired, never
exposed to the heat.

592
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:47,164
And you're thinking there
might be a recoverable print.

593
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:48,791
Yeah.
Dare to dream.

594
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:14,224
Well, you were right.

595
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:15,025
Kwanspy.

596
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:17,261
On every employee's computer.

597
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:19,329
Program runs in the
background, invisible.

598
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,832
Copies documents, e-mails,

599
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:23,567
every keystroke.

600
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,736
Then transfers the data
to Kwan's machine.

601
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:26,570
Big Brother.

602
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,340
Company owns a network,
company owns what's on it.

603
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,309
Sick, but legal.

604
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:33,711
Well, knowledge is power.

605
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:37,781
Kwan had his computer set up
to auto-burn a new disk

606
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:39,817
every night.

607
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:40,551
Here.

608
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,086
This was made
the night of the murder.

609
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:44,354
If we found out
who was away from their desk

610
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:45,656
at the time of death...

611
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,123
We've got our killer.

612
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:53,664
Nick, based on
these time stamps,

613
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:55,399
everybody in that office
was working

614
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,201
when Garret Kwan was killed.

615
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:57,901
Great.

616
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:01,359
We just eliminated
all of our suspects.

617
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:05,642
Assistant District Attorney
Kelly's Office, please.

618
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:08,245
This is Warrick Brown.

619
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:10,080
Oh, he's not in?

620
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,748
Okay.

621
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:12,149
Well, maybe you can help me out.

622
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:16,854
I, uh, I have Gene Jaycobs'
personal belongings,

623
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:19,857
and I need to get them
returned to him.

624
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:23,884
I need his relocated address.

625
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,898
Yeah, I know it's not
standard procedure but, uh,

626
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:31,602
I missed him at lockup,
and I'm going to be in hot water

627
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:35,129
if I don't get this stuff
back to him, so...

628
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,266
Good.

629
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,611
(baby crying)

630
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,814
It's just me.

631
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,282
Nobody here.

632
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:19,416
Got no heater.

633
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:22,686
What, what, what can
I do for you, Mr. Brown?

634
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:24,288
I just thought I'd
come by and let you know

635
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,757
we're going to get you
for robbery, if not murder.

636
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,826
By the time
you get to lockup,

637
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,660
every roughneck in the joint

638
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,696
is going to know you offed
a nine-year-old little girl.

639
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:35,465
(snickering)

640
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:37,835
You know, in school,

641
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,837
you were a nerd, Brown.

642
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,738
You were, remember?

643
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:43,207
Every kid there used to

644
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:45,242
beat your ass.

645
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:46,810
Thick glasses,

646
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,212
hand-me-down clothes,

647
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:50,180
always with a book in your hand,

648
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:55,219
like you was better
than everybody else.

649
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:57,881
Nigga, I ain't scared of you.

650
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,954
Want to step outside, then?

651
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:08,699
Fractured nasal bone,

652
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:10,400
fracture of the right
zygomatic arch

653
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,435
extending
into the maxilla.

654
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:13,337
Fracture of the
right anterior ribs...

655
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:14,838
Assistant D.A.'s
office, please.

656
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:15,505
Who found him?

657
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:16,773
Motel manager called it in.

658
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:18,242
No weapon
was found at the scene.

659
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:20,744
Thank God his assailant
only used his fists.

660
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:22,846
Given the severity
of force,

661
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,748
anything else
would have killed him

662
00:31:24,748 --> 00:31:25,816
Thank you, Doctor.

663
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,050
Yeah, this is Jim Brass.

664
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,518
I'm at Desert Palm Hospital.

665
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:30,888
I'm looking at
a half dead Gene Jaycobs.

666
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,789
Now, only two people
knew where he was.

667
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:33,423
That was you and me.

668
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:36,517
You want to tell me how
the hell this could happen?

669
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:49,239
What, you think I did this?

670
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,408
I don't jump to conclusions.

671
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:53,310
Well, I didn't.

672
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,279
I'd like to shake
the hand

673
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,781
of the guy that did, though.

674
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,549
Well, you may get a chance.

675
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:02,347
Your new assignment.

676
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:05,489
Check out the pattern
in the center

677
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:07,057
of this contusion.

678
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:08,957
It's probative.

679
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,402
No suspect.

680
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,037
No motive.

681
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:20,570
No weapon.

682
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:24,608
You don't just spontaneously
develop a fatal head wound.

683
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:25,809
Somebody had to kill him.

684
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:30,814
A guy goes into a room with
no windows and no doors.

685
00:32:30,814 --> 00:32:32,616
How does he get out?

686
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:35,118
I don't know.

687
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:37,450
Same way he got in.

688
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,958
You know, there is one thing

689
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:46,328
that comes in and goes
out of here all the time.

690
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:52,996
Cold air.

691
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,845
Anything?

692
00:33:01,845 --> 00:33:05,804
Just black P.E.T.,
as far as the eye can see.

693
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:10,047
And possible transfer.

694
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,423
Where were you last night?

695
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:14,992
Right here, man.

696
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:19,122
I'm going to need
to see your hands.

697
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:22,966
Dad?

698
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:25,491
Trav, go to your room.

699
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:32,839
Other side.

700
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,884
Look, you went there too.

701
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:43,353
That's how I knew where to go.

702
00:33:43,353 --> 00:33:45,155
But I never touched the guy.

703
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:47,024
He didn't kill your daughter!

704
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:49,893
If he's guilty, we're
going to put him away.

705
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:51,028
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,662
And then what?

707
00:33:52,662 --> 00:33:53,597
Lawyers? Trial?

708
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:57,901
You wait ten years for somebody
else's definition of justice.

709
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,669
And they always put
the criminal's rights

710
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:00,404
before the victim's.

711
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:02,406
You know, the first
good night's sleep I had

712
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:03,407
was last night.

713
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:04,041
Eye for an eye

714
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,376
and the whole world
goes blind?

715
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:07,711
You taught me that.

716
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:09,913
Well, my perspective
has changed.

717
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:11,972
Aimee's dead.

718
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:15,919
I've got no choice here.

719
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:17,087
My hands are tied.

720
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:21,649
I got to let them
bring you in.

721
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:41,144
It's going to be okay, Trav.

722
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:43,213
I love you, son.

723
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:44,514
Look, uh...

724
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:46,983
make sure they take care
of him, all right?

725
00:34:46,983 --> 00:34:48,418
Of course.

726
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,079
Thank you.

727
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,581
(car starts)

728
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:01,164
Sir.

729
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:05,435
You, um, asked us to check
on a stolen minivan?

730
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:05,969
Yeah.

731
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,270
You know,
from the rec center?

732
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,005
We located it.

733
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:10,740
Oh, great.
All right.

734
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,002
Thanks.

735
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:15,112
(distant thunder roaring)

736
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:18,949
(garbled radio transmissions)

737
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:20,109
Hey.

738
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:41,705
Blue paint transfer.

739
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:44,975
Possibly from
your mailbox?

740
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:46,710
I found a jammed
nine millimeter cartridge

741
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,578
in the backyard of a house
a few doors down

742
00:35:48,578 --> 00:35:50,247
from where Jaycobs said
he found the gun.

743
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:52,983
Backyard of a house
that had been broken into.

744
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:55,819
You said he was a thief, right?

745
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:56,219
Yeah.

746
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:57,787
See, I think he
lied about where
he found the gun

747
00:35:57,787 --> 00:35:59,990
so we wouldn't know he was
breaking into houses.

748
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,759
Apart from that, I think
he was telling the truth.

749
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:04,283
(glass breaking)

750
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:16,165
Shall we?

751
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:45,529
Grissom.

752
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,237
Matt used to have

753
00:36:47,237 --> 00:36:48,738
this really harsh rule

754
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:51,298
about no eating in the van.

755
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:56,713
(knocking)

756
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:58,048
Yeah?

757
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,050
Hugo Karlin?

758
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:00,684
Yeah, uh, you know what?

759
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:02,652
You guys aren't
supposed to be back here.

760
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:03,653
This is a restricted...

761
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:05,355
Detective Vega.
LVPD.

762
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:07,591
This is Nick Stokes
from the crime lab.

763
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:11,228
Uh, hey.

764
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:13,096
What's up?

765
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:14,831
Interesting
choice of words.

766
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:17,867
Facility management
says you've been

767
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,402
working on the
air conditioning

768
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:20,370
above HyperTrix.

769
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,106
Yeah, well, I work
this whole building.

770
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:24,741
That's a lot
of companies.

771
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:26,576
I don't really keep
track of the names,

772
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:27,244
I just fix the air.

773
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,278
Well, you'd remember
this company.

774
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:31,615
It's where you
killed a guy...

775
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:33,105
with that.

776
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,328
One in a million shot.

777
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:47,660
It happens.

778
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:50,133
It was an accident.
You got to believe me.

779
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:52,235
I, I always keep
my hammer right here.

780
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:53,870
I don't even know
how it came loose.

781
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,272
Oh, it just
came loose, huh?

782
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,439
Yes.
Okay.

783
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,236
Well, then how'd
you pick it up?

784
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:04,608
Um, the same way
I close the duct cover.

785
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:12,653
I call this my grabby tool.

786
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:27,203
I made it myself.

787
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:29,205
You know, people never
notice me

788
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:30,340
when I'm around here,

789
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,410
and I just figured that if

790
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,345
I covered my tracks,
this time

791
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:38,314
wouldn't be any different.

792
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:43,853
Why don't you, uh,
show him our grabby tool?

793
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:44,688
You're under arrest.

794
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:47,680
You have the right
to remain silent...

795
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,406
(laughing)

796
00:39:03,406 --> 00:39:04,474
Greg.

797
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:05,809
How many licks
does it take

798
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:08,011
to get to the center
of a Tootsie Pop?

799
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:09,746
The world
may never know.

800
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:10,480
(giggling)

801
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,848
Just see if you
can get some DNA

802
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:12,916
off of this stick,
would you?

803
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,885
All work and no play
make Greg a dull boy.

804
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:18,688
All play and no work
make Greg an unemployed boy.

805
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:19,756
Hey, Grissom.

806
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:21,781
Your stovepipe.

807
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:27,297
Pulled a good thumbprint.

808
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:28,231
Happens sometimes

809
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,722
when they load
the magazine.

810
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:34,504
Tyrel Constantine.

811
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:37,407
Arrested last June
for joyriding.

812
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:39,743
Date of birth '87?

813
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:42,871
This guy's a juvie.
He's only 15.

814
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:49,786
So, Tyrel, let me
get this straight.

815
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:51,554
You didn't know
Jason Gilbert?

816
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:53,256
I never heard of him.

817
00:39:53,256 --> 00:39:55,892
So you shot someone
you didn't know?

818
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:57,761
Who says I shot anyone?

819
00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:59,319
That would be me.

820
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,533
Tyrel Constantine.

821
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:05,402
Oh, yeah, I knew him.

822
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,905
He used to hang out
at the rec center.

823
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:09,839
He used to?

824
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,008
Until he lost
his privileges.

825
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:14,444
So you threw him out?

826
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:17,514
He was smoking weed
on the field.

827
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:22,051
Showing up late to practice,
starting fights.

828
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,020
When did this happen?

829
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,889
A couple weeks ago.

830
00:40:25,889 --> 00:40:28,458
We found your saliva
on this lollipop stick

831
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,861
in Mr. Phelps's van, and
we found your thumbprint

832
00:40:31,861 --> 00:40:32,829
on this bullet.

833
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:35,965
You stole a van
from the rec center,

834
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:36,966
didn't you?

835
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:40,437
The van wasn't hot-wired,
so I think you knew

836
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:42,038
where Mr. Phelps
kept his keys.

837
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:44,841
Why, why, why you asking me
about Tyrel?

838
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:49,412
The vehicle that was used
in that drive-by

839
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:52,939
was the van that was stolen
from your rec center.

840
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,431
Oh, God.

841
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:10,633
Look, we know you didn't
mean to shoot anyone.

842
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:13,864
It was a stray bullet
that hit Aimee Phelps.

843
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:18,608
I just wanted to scare him.

844
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:20,076
Scare who?

845
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:21,578
Jason Gilbert?

846
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:23,580
No. Mr. Phelps.

847
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,848
No. That's it, we're done here.

848
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:26,483
Tyrel, talk to me.

849
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:28,451
They need to know
it was an accident.

850
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,119
He shouldn't have
thrown me out.

851
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,157
Pushed me around like that
in front of my friends.

852
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:37,024
I just wanted to shake him up.

853
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:45,668
So Jason Gilbert
was just collateral damage.

854
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:50,867
I was driving pretty fast,
didn't look where I shot.

855
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:57,503
What about Aimee?

856
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:10,860
I gave up on him.

857
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,662
If I hadn't...

858
00:42:12,662 --> 00:42:15,995
He gave up on himself.

859
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:34,417
I blew it.

860
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:36,386
Yeah.

861
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:41,050
But you're not the one
who's paying for it.
