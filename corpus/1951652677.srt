1
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:59,225
Dario!

2
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,226
A message from Peligro.

3
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,265
Ho!

4
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:35,385
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

5
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,263
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

6
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,324
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

7
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,325
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

8
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:48,298
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

9
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:59,311
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

10
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:06,342
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

11
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,324
Mambo

12
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,461
Ladies and gentlemen,

13
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,301
a very good evening to you all.

14
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,397
El Tropico,

15
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,241
the most fabulous nightclub in
the world, presents

16
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:35,247
its latest,
but not late show,

17
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,306
where we are taking you all
to the magical productions

18
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:40,318
of our Rodney the Great.

19
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,412
Ladies and gentlemen,

20
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,425
we are honored tonight
to have in our presence

21
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,228
the world's greatest
living race car driver,

22
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,522
here in Cuba for the first
Havana Grand Prix.

23
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,354
Ladies and gentlemen,

24
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,493
the one and only Fangio
for once, stationary.

25
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,403
Fangio! Fangio!
Fangio! Fangio!

26
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,340
Fangio!

27
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,343
And now, a special treat

28
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,479
for a very special couple.

29
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,343
Forever newlyweds,

30
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:12,443
Dona Cecilia, Don Federico,

31
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,378
The Anniversary waltz
by Strauss.

32
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,447
Happy Anniversary.

33
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:26,526
A toast.

34
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,290
To the most
elegant couple in Havana.

35
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,266
Happy Anniversary.

36
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,358
And to this,

37
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,372
the happiest of families.

38
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,374
May it be that way forever.

39
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,343
Hear, hear. Salud.

40
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,502
Salud.
Salud.

41
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,507
Dance with me,
as you once did?

42
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,279
You make me
sound like a relic.

43
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,377
My relic.

44
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,483
Donoso, would you
dance with me?

45
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,281
Watch yourself.

46
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,290
Uncle has two left feet now.

47
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,454
His elbow,
it works fine.

48
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,422
I would give an arm
and a leg and an elbow

49
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,300
for just one single waltz.

50
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:09,297
My kingdom for a cha-cha-cha!

51
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,309
Hear, hear.

52
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,435
Let's go dance.

53
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:16,482
I'll be right back. Wait here.

54
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,446
What's wrong?

55
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:30,326
So which one
of those dancers

56
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,387
is your girlfriend
this week?

57
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,324
Who are you
saving yourself for?

58
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,300
No one.

59
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,396
All the good ones
are already spoken for.

60
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,375
Fangio, I want to present to you

61
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,377
my wife Mercedes Fellove.

62
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:55,413
Come on, let's go.

63
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:04,291
This meeting was my idea...

64
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:08,495
because these are very
difficult times, as you know.

65
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,435
Cuba has always
lived in difficult times,

66
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,439
but through them all,
we have been able to survive

67
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:18,307
because we have
always been united.

68
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,302
But our country
isn't safe anymore,

69
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,476
and it threatens us.

70
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:30,285
Your uncle and I are all
that remains of our generation.

71
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:37,524
So, my sons,
you are the future.

72
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,293
The future of our family.

73
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,297
The future of this island.

74
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:46,338
Yes, and
look at me.

75
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,305
Look at me, because
this is for you, too.

76
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,307
If we want to
change the status quo,

77
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,370
we must go about it
in a democratic way.

78
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,507
You hear?

79
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:58,483
We must be patriots.

80
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,451
Patriots.

81
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,413
Patriotism is a refuge for scoundrels.

82
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,252
Do you

83
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,348
It is politics
that has become

84
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,358
the practical refuge of

85
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:08,519
Papi, do not make the mistake

86
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,358
of confusing me for
one of your students.

87
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,329
I'm not. I graduated.

88
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:12,331
Hey.

89
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,300
Show a little respect.

90
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,427
No, no, no, no.
Let him talk.

91
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,303
Let him talk.
This is a democracy.

92
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:23,274
Oh, this country,
a democracy? Right.

93
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,403
Our family is a democracy.

94
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,413
This country is my family,

95
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,382
and the only way
to truly unite that family

96
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:31,473
is revolution.

97
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:32,483
Revolution?

98
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,286
Revolution, yes.

99
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,411
I just can't believe it.

100
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,357
A son of mine
that would support

101
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,519
the random violence
of revolution?

102
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,427
You better start believing it.

103
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:46,362
What you need is
a little evolution,

104
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,331
not revolution.

105
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:48,458
Correct.

106
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,401
The poet.

107
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,233
Club owner, poet.

108
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,372
You're lucky you're on
the other side of the room.

109
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,339
I feel lucky,

110
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,309
because it probably
stinks on that side of the room.

111
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:58,273
Please.

112
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,274
Happy Anniversary.

113
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:00,411
You are too much.

114
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,276
Did I forget to say that?
Happy Anniversary?

115
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,406
Just watch your mouth.

116
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,507
What? You've been watching it
the whole time.

117
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,485
If I hear one more
word of disrespect

118
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,317
coming out of your mouth,

119
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,514
I'm gonna
deal with it personally.

120
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,321
Do you understand me?

121
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:14,290
What?

122
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,257
You understand
what I just said to you?

123
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,262
I understand

124
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,329
You listen to your father
when he's speaking to you,

125
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,490
and you show respect!

126
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,432
Calm down, Fico.

127
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,401
No, you calm down!

128
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,427
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

129
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,427
You want me
to come over there?

130
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,406
Okay.

131
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,271
Huh? You want me
to come over there?

132
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,232
Stop it!

133
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,471
Come on.
Come on.

134
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,280
Stop it!
Stop it.

135
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,443
Four against one, huh?
Stop it.

136
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:41,419
Sit down.
Sit down.

137
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:42,421
Is this a democracy?

138
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,422
Sit down.

139
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,423
You got your little show.
Sit down.

140
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:48,427
Sit down, right? How is it?
Sit down!

141
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,428
Is this a random act
of violence, Papi?

142
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,423
Huh?

143
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,504
They shot Lieutenant Dario.

144
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,307
Did they get
good descriptions this time?

145
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,278
Did he mention Peligro again?

146
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,370
Mm-hmm.

147
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,246
What happened?

148
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,378
I'm not gonna
have this conversation

149
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,250
with you, you, you,
or any of you.

150
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:17,380
You know what?

151
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,254
You have no idea
what's going on in this country.

152
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,225
It's sad that you're a professor
and you have zero

153
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,363
zero idea of what is going on
in your own classroom.

154
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,331
Then can you enlighten me?

155
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,332
Can you tell me what's going on?

156
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,429
Discontent, anger...
desperation.

157
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,472
That's what's going
on in this country,

158
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:36,297
everywhere in this country,

159
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,275
and especially
at your university.

160
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,370
Revolution, okay? It happened in France,
it happened in Russia,

161
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,244
and it's happening here,
and it's happening now.

162
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,315
Nobody wants a revolution.

163
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,475
You don't want a revolution.

164
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,275
But like it or not,
it's coming.

165
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,413
The people, they want it.

166
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,388
How do you know?

167
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,357
Has the people of Cuba spoken to you
in your chosen ears?

168
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,429
No. Batista must be eliminated.

169
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,226
And then what?

170
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,528
Freedom. Democracy.

171
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:03,501
Right, yeah.

172
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:04,503
Power to the people.

173
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,504
That's easier said than done.

174
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,470
It can be done,

175
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,465
but the first thing
you have to do

176
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,434
is kill that son of a bitch.

177
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,532
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

178
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,279
Have you ever thought
to live for your country?

179
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,250
Yes. Live. I am living!

180
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,219
I live, and I let die.

181
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,447
Let the tyrant die.

182
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:24,517
A fish is caught by its mouth.

183
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:30,226
You need the earth
on your hands, not blood.

184
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,264
Take sanctuary at the farm.

185
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,299
My son doesn't need sanctuary.

186
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,301
He just needs
to reform his character,

187
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:43,274
for a man's character
is his destiny.

188
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,342
What book did you get that from?

189
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,509
Maybe you should read a couple.

190
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,277
Where do you stand, Fico?

191
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,506
Where do you stand?

192
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,350
Right here with my family.

193
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,476
I see that.
You're just a spectator.

194
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,317
You just watch the parade go by.

195
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,288
Let me tell you something, Fico.

196
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:59,416
Your days of hiding in this cork-lined
palace are numbered.

197
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:02,255
Pretty soon,
you and you and you

198
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:04,363
and you are gonna
have to make a decision.

199
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,364
Are you in the parade,
or are you not?

200
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,466
I have made my decision.

201
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:12,269
That means good night!

202
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,272
Good night in Cuban!

203
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,273
Buenas noches!

204
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:20,244
Buenas nochesto you all!

205
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:02,446
Good evening.

206
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,447
That depends.

207
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,293
It usually does, doesn't it?

208
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,432
It was a great show tonight.

209
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,461
Great show.

210
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,312
Do you know a guy named Peligro?

211
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,313
Who?

212
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,443
Peligro.

213
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,447
Is he a percussionist?

214
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,264
Would you know a guy
named Alberto Mora?

215
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,232
Is he a friend of yours?

216
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,390
Someone here to see you.

217
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,408
I had nowhere else to go.

218
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,346
Have you seen him?

219
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:04,482
All the time.

220
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:16,291
Next time you see him,
say good-bye.

221
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,528
When I get to the pearly gates,

222
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,404
you know what
I'm gonna ask for, don't you?

223
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,408
A bottle of Bacardi?
No, a case.

224
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:32,274
Don't forget the Victrola.

225
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,403
You're not going anywhere
without your dance partner.

226
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,412
Okay, I'll stay.

227
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,509
Viejo.
What is he saying?

228
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,447
Uh-oh, the ticking clock.

229
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:44,414
Fico.

230
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:55,389
Well, I wanted to say
that in our house,

231
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,369
Sunday dinner is not...

232
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,370
A moveable feast.

233
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,307
Uh-huh. All my sons
are welcome, but not...

234
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,274
Not after6.

235
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,405
And it is 6 and 3 minutes, Fico.

236
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,381
I know, but I thought
he said after6.

237
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:16,446
Okay. Okay. Now, um...

238
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,221
I want to make a wish.

239
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,389
If change is going
to come to our country,

240
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:29,264
I wish that our home
remains an island,

241
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,306
and that despite
all of our differences,

242
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,342
we always put family first.

243
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,280
And food second.

244
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:44,403
Salud.
Salud.

245
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,384
It's a joke, my brother.
I'm just kidding.

246
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:59,226
So it's all in the family.

247
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,331
It's all in the family.

248
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,299
I tell you,
I swear to God it is.

249
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:05,403
Hello, Senator. How are you?

250
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,461
I've been better.

251
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:09,441
I come to see your father.

252
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,307
No one knows more
about constitutional law.

253
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,312
Am I interrupting?

254
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,472
I mean, he's picking
for compliments, Senator.

255
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,316
Okay, I'm gonna give you one.

256
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,451
Do you think the light
interrupts the day?

257
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:21,452
Sometimes.

258
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:24,320
We intend to pass
a resolution

259
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:25,414
that will remove Batista

260
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,452
through the constitutional
process.

261
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,292
Senator Cossio has asked me

262
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,230
to prepare a speech for him.

263
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,493
This is the opening statement.

264
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,327
Uh, I've made reference to Seneca.

265
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,306
Read it aloud, Senator,

266
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,467
so we can hear how it sounds.

267
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:47,445
Okay.
Please.

268
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:53,282
Mr. Speaker,
I must protest...

269
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:56,345
as Seneca did in ancient Rome,

270
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,515
of the violence of office.

271
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,489
Today, we, the citizens of Cuba,

272
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,462
are being persecuted by a tyrant

273
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,490
and his reign of terror,

274
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,332
meted out to our population
by his police,

275
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,337
and especially by a certain
colonel in the force

276
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:20,301
whose name has become
synonymous with sudden death.

277
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,304
Seneca was persecuted
by two tyrants,

278
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,318
Caligula and Nero.

279
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,283
In spite of that,

280
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,448
Seneca advocated the return
to the Republic...

281
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,452
unafraid.

282
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:40,421
Mr. Speaker, Seneca,
not the Neros of this world,

283
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,530
should be an example to us.

284
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,442
Fangio, I am your biggest fan.

285
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,283
Get in the car.
Just get in the car.

286
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,413
Get in the car.
Get in.

287
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,288
What do you want? Money?

288
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,258
Publicity.

289
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,429
Fangio freed,
Grand Prix cancelled,

290
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,431
26th of July Movement responsible.

291
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,424
And listen to what Fangio said.

292
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,365
All they wanted from me

293
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,494
is that I help them
further their cause.

294
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:22,337
But I don't know anything
about causes, only cars.

295
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,338
And when they ask him
how he was treated,

296
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,443
They were quintessential
gentlemen.

297
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,405
Do you think I'm a quintessential
gentleman, Mercedes?

298
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,449
Huh?

299
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,277
What was so funny?
What were you laughing about?

300
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,221
The funnies.

301
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,516
The funnies?
That newspaper has no funnies.

302
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,259
Why don't you try the one
about the kidnappers

303
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,282
who only wanted publicity?

304
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,261
Stop it!

305
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:46,396
That's funny. That's funny.

306
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,487
Leave him alone! Stop!

307
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,358
Yeah. Come on.

308
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,496
Stop! Let him go!

309
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,432
Please stop!

310
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,344
Stop it! Stop it!

311
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,346
Stop it!

312
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,359
Huh?

313
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,519
You want to be tough? Huh?

314
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,361
Wanna play in my city?

315
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,490
Spoiled rich bastard!

316
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:25,358
You do not want
to disappoint me.

317
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:28,338
Believe me.

318
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,307
I'm gonna go for a walk.

319
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,310
When I get back,

320
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,471
I want you to tell
me who Peligro is.

321
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,448
I'm back.

322
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:49,461
Who's Peligro? Huh?

323
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,394
You're not a good listener.

324
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:03,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

325
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,446
Ooh. No, I'm okay, I'm okay.

326
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:24,326
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?

327
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,297
So you better be thinking about
who Peligro is,

328
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,296
'cause you're next.

329
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,269
Let's go for some coffee.

330
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,296
You're here about your brother.

331
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,240
Your little brother's a criminal

332
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,403
a dangerous criminal.

333
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,241
No doubt about that.

334
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,248
I've got his file
if you wanna read it.

335
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,250
No, thank you.

336
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,249
I know my brother,

337
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:51,483
and no file will ever change that.

338
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:56,256
Fico, we've known each other
since we were in prep school.

339
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,386
I've always
been straight with you.

340
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,363
That's true.

341
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,327
Have you ever known me
to change my signals?

342
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:02,296
Not when you were my catcher.

343
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,359
Fico, you're pitching
for your brother now.

344
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,336
You're pitching wild.

345
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,497
He's guilty.
There's no doubt about that.

346
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,434
I know it and you know it.

347
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,278
He's my brother, Braulio.

348
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,281
I need your help.

349
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,257
Okay.

350
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:28,451
I think you should
get out of Havana,

351
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,250
go to New York or Miami,

352
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,262
and I'm gonna take
care of the tickets.

353
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,265
Fico, Fidel's gonna
take care of me.

354
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,269
I'm leaving for
the Sierra Maestra.

355
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,429
Hey.

356
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,275
Fico, I have no choice.

357
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:49,277
What about your family?

358
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,282
Everything I do
is for my family.

359
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,448
I love you.

360
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,499
Uh, come in.

361
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,363
Can I help you?

362
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,343
Al sent me.

363
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:19,502
Who?

364
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,276
Al.

365
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,508
He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

366
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:26,346
Are you auditioning?

367
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,319
Yes, I am.

368
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,480
What's your line?

369
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:31,489
I'm a comedian.

370
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,325
I'm a stand-up comedian

371
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,296
who prefers to remain seated.

372
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,423
That's it?
That's your line?

373
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,229
Yeah.

374
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,460
Some jokes for your emcee.

375
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:46,259
He writes his own jokes.

376
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,397
They're lousy. So are yours.

377
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:50,375
Touch?

378
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,433
You want some help writing
some of your other material?

379
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:55,208
Nobody writes anybody's
material around here.

380
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,338
You just improvise?

381
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,280
You can call it that.
Try New York.

382
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:01,251
Too cold. Too rich.

383
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,309
Too close to home.

384
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,318
Well, I'm afraid
you're going to have to

385
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,381
find another line of work, then.

386
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,316
I can't.

387
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:10,294
The laughter
you just become addicted to it.

388
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,262
What'd you say your name was?

389
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:16,461
I didn't.
I said Al sent me.

390
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,460
If you know Al, you know me.

391
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,307
Oh, Al's friend.

392
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,474
Where've you been?

393
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,339
Where haven't I been?

394
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,313
Federico, remember your
appointment.

395
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,344
And don't forget your dancing
shoes.

396
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:31,449
You're going to need them.

397
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,308
Oh, Rodney?

398
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,480
Maestro?

399
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,325
Oh, never mind.

400
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:46,327
I think I have
a job for you after all.

401
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,491
Finally, after all these years

402
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,491
of sacrifice and dedication,

403
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:54,336
a break.

404
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,346
Why can't you tell
me who we're meeting?

405
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:03,314
It's better that way.

406
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:04,372
I love surprises.

407
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:05,440
Just don't say a word

408
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,240
no matter what.

409
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,445
Sit there,
pretend you're my security. That's it.

410
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,422
How's this?
Cozy enough?

411
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,416
Look a little bit more dangerous.

412
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:15,393
How about this?

413
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,291
More dangerous.

414
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:21,432
This is my meanest.

415
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,267
Save that.

416
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,271
Can I make a wish?

417
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,397
Be my guest.

418
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:34,444
I wish for a tall, athletic,
caramel-colored beauty.

419
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,445
Okay.

420
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,478
An open-door policy
is the sign of a great host.

421
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,288
Mr. Lansky, come in.
Welcome.

422
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,321
Should I call you Federico,

423
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,294
Mr. Fellove, or Fico?

424
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:56,298
Depends on whether
you shake my hand or not.

425
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,460
Call me Fico.

426
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,436
You can call my Meyer.
All my friends do.

427
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:02,306
Have a seat.

428
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:04,442
Who is this guy?

429
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,444
Don't mind him,
he's just a comedian.

430
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,445
A blind one?

431
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,446
Mute.

432
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,278
That's funny.

433
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:12,340
Would you like a drink?

434
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:16,477
A little seltzer,
unless you happen to, uh...

435
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,454
have an egg cream.

436
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,278
I have eggs and I have cream.

437
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:20,413
And you have a blind comedian.

438
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,355
Mute.

439
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:26,394
An egg cream
is neither egg nor cream.

440
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,398
Would you like
to know how to make one?

441
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:29,500
Well, that would've
been my next question.

442
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,428
Well, let? S see
how this goes first.

443
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,261
A little seltzer for now.
Cuts the humidity.

444
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:40,501
You hear that, comedian?

445
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:42,439
You said something on the
phone about a business opportunity.

446
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,240
Well played. Le Chaim.

447
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:51,286
I propose
a partnership between us.

448
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:54,258
20% goes to the house,

449
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,317
the rest to me, my associates.

450
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,383
It doesn't have
to be anything big.

451
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,422
I mean, this is very cozy here.

452
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,261
You could have a couple of tables,

453
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:04,426
craps, you know, blackjack,
a wheel or two.

454
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:06,267
This is nice.

455
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,271
Mr. Lansky

456
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,435
Call him Meyer.

457
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,436
Or Mr. Lansky.

458
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,440
You want him here?

459
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,442
Meyer, I appreciate the offer,

460
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,351
but, regretfully, I have to pass.

461
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:24,319
Now, I know this is
a tremendous opportunity for me.

462
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:27,450
However, El Tropico
is a place of music,

463
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,426
and that's how
I would like it to stay.

464
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,423
Let me rephrase.

465
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:36,297
We have the beginning

466
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,291
of a mutually
beneficial relationship.

467
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,430
It would be a pity to see it end
before it even began.

468
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:41,439
Yes, it would.

469
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:43,441
All right.

470
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,346
I was informed
you were a reasonable man.

471
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,314
I hope I wasn't misinformed.

472
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,285
You weren't.

473
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,442
What I can offer you in return

474
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,455
is what I offer all my friends

475
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,458
an open-door policy.

476
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,351
Consider my club
your home any time.

477
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,461
What, free seltzer?

478
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:08,227
As much as you want.

479
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,233
You know, in my business,
Mr. Fellove,

480
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:12,403
we have friends
and we have enemies,

481
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,397
but we don't
have acquaintances.

482
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:20,369
I hope to hear
some good news very soon.

483
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:34,384
Is that Meyer Lansky...
Meyer Lansky?

484
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,359
The head of the mob.

485
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,224
I resign.

486
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,253
Are you wearing false eyelashes,
or are you truly bashful?

487
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,413
I never wear false eyelashes.

488
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,354
That's my girl.

489
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:07,490
Am I?

490
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:31,440
Whose idea was that?

491
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,473
Rodney's.

492
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,480
Are you gonna be watching?

493
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,321
Always.

494
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:14,325
What's the matter?

495
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,330
What's wrong?

496
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,458
Luis has another woman.

497
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,297
Another woman?

498
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:32,241
He hasn't come home in two days,

499
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:36,373
and before that, we haven't

500
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,507
His mind is elsewhere.

501
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:42,281
Has he called?

502
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:44,354
Just to say that he's okay,

503
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,516
and that's all he says.

504
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:51,259
Fico, help me.

505
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:54,387
You're the only one
I can turn to.

506
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,365
I'm gonna take care of it.

507
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,421
She's worried about you.

508
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:29,424
She came to you?

509
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,431
She's always had a...

510
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:39,340
very special place
in her heart for you.

511
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,470
And you for her.

512
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,448
What's the matter? Talk to me.

513
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:47,315
I'm not gonna get you involved.

514
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm your brother. I'm involved.
What's up?

515
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,318
Is it another woman?

516
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,289
Yes.

517
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,258
Liberty.

518
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,319
You involved with Fidel?
No.

519
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,321
26th of July Movement,
like Ricardo?

520
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,289
No.

521
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,422
Directorio Revolucionario.

522
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,396
We're no longer associated.

523
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,400
We have our own ideas for Cuba.

524
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,394
Pluralism,

525
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,372
the restoration of
the 1940 Constitution.

526
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:43,240
You know, democracy.

527
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:44,400
That's what Fidel says he wants.

528
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,377
Sure, that's what he says,
but he can't be trusted.

529
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,381
You think he's a Communist?

530
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:51,507
A Fidelista.

531
00:30:58,388 --> 00:31:00,481
You have to promise me something.

532
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,491
What?

533
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:06,326
Anything happens to me...

534
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,526
you'll look after Aurora.

535
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,295
She'll need you.

536
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,432
Here, promise me.

537
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,244
Promise me, Fico.

538
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,382
I need this from you.

539
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,442
I promise you.

540
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,252
But you're gonna promise me

541
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,346
that nothing's gonna
happen to you, right?

542
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,423
Right?

543
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:38,259
There's no happiness
outside the revolution.

544
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,506
Okay.

545
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:57,279
Don't do something stupid.

546
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,272
Okay?

547
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,511
Ricardo Fellove,
26th of July Movement.

548
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,354
Fellove.
Are you the dancer?

549
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:43,451
Because we don't need any dancers.

550
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:49,455
Okay, get off the horse.
We're hungry.

551
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,344
It's not another woman.

552
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,387
Then why won't he come back?

553
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,480
He doesn't want us involved.

554
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,384
What is it?
The revolution?

555
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,486
He doesn't want us involved.

556
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,329
That's it?

557
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,455
That's it.

558
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:34,267
Am I supposed to
take that home and be happy?

559
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,246
I'm his wife.

560
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:38,472
I have the right to be involved.

561
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:42,249
If something happens to him,
it happens to me.

562
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,412
To all of us.

563
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:45,512
And then what?

564
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:37,237
I think it was the Mafia, Meyer Lansky,

565
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,335
but I can't be certain.

566
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:44,346
Havana is no longer a capital city,

567
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:48,250
but a capital sin.

568
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,351
This is
not new, of course,

569
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:56,481
but even Jesus had
to whip the moneylenders

570
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,324
out of the temple.

571
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:03,231
We're badly in need of a

572
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,393
of a Christ with a whip.

573
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,304
I don't know what to do.

574
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:22,250
Satyagraha.

575
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,344
Do you know what that is?

576
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,288
No.

577
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,382
It is the Hindu word

578
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:32,362
For passive resistance.

579
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:37,266
Gandhi resisted passively,

580
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,268
and he won.

581
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,498
My son, in the sea,

582
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,510
even a shark can drown.

583
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:21,311
Okay, we all know how to make it

584
00:36:21,344 --> 00:36:23,313
into the Presidential Palace
by heart now?

585
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,280
So let's review one last time.

586
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,510
I will take over the CNQ radio station
and read our statement.

587
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:29,353
Carbo?

588
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,284
Machado and I will attack with
Peligro through the main gates,

589
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,423
along with Menoyo and his group.

590
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,425
Ignacio, you will
provide sniper protection

591
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,226
and reinforcements.

592
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,454
Any questions?

593
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:45,326
What do you think, Peligro?

594
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,242
It's time.

595
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,231
Mockingbird Pet Shop.
Can I help you?

596
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,434
The bird is in the cage.

597
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,449
He's in.

598
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,311
Long live a free Cuba.

599
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:13,389
Long live a free Cuba.

600
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:20,523
Mr. President?

601
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,335
Mr. President?

602
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,371
What is it, Pizzi?

603
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:34,275
There are urgent matters
for you to attend to.

604
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,219
I've been signing
edicts all week,

605
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:45,355
and you know what
I've been thinking, Pizzi?

606
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,356
I'm a fortunate man

607
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:51,224
for having had to sign
one single death warrant.

608
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:54,364
Mr. President,
if I might say so myself,

609
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:58,356
you are a fortunate man,
but also a noble man.

610
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,369
Thank you, Pizzi.
That's very kind of you.

611
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:03,206
No, no, no, no, no.
It is not kindness.

612
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,333
It is historical justice.

613
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,389
Have I ever told you
how much I appreciate you?

614
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,416
No, sir.

615
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,485
Oh.

616
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:36,306
Sorry I'm late.

617
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,465
I got stuck in Pinelarillo

618
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:40,242
what do you want?

619
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,471
I got 450 napkins and tablecloths.

620
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,309
I'm gonna need help
getting it out of here.

621
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,373
I don't have any deliveries
on my list today.

622
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,351
This is the front gate, right?

623
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,284
Yeah, it's the front gate.

624
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,378
They told me 3:00 at the front gate.

625
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,389
Can you check?
Can you

626
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:55,255
All right.
Stay there.

627
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:58,384
Is any deliveries on the list today?

628
00:39:59,262 --> 00:40:00,251
No.

629
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,246
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

630
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:20,282
Go ahead, go in!

631
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,340
Here!

632
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,422
What's that noise?

633
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:43,472
Come with me! Now!

634
00:41:50,273 --> 00:41:51,240
Let's go!

635
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,355
Fico! The palace is being attacked.

636
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:16,456
Listen. Manzanita's taken over
the radio station.

637
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,431
People of Cuba, the dictator
Fulgencio Batista

638
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,271
has just met revolutionary justice.

639
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:28,244
The gunfire that extinguished

640
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:29,405
the bloody life of the dictator

641
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,248
can still be heard around
the Presidential Palace.

642
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,251
It is we,
The Directorio Revolucionario,

643
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,378
the iron hand of
the Cuban Revolution

644
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:38,476
who have accomplished the final
blow

645
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:39,489
against this shameful regime

646
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,353
still twisting in its own agony.

647
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,291
Cubans who can hear me,
he has just been eliminated.

648
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,326
Long live a free Cuba!

649
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:48,398
Que vive una Cuba libre!

650
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,414
Carbo! Carbo!

651
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:17,393
Luis! Luis!

652
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:18,394
Luis!

653
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,286
Luis!

654
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:26,429
Luis!

655
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,541
Pizzi, leave us alone.

656
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:45,282
With friends or without friends?

657
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,382
As you like.

658
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,201
Pizzi.

659
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,369
Yes, sir?

660
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,311
People of Cuba,

661
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:14,407
today alien forces
made an attempt on my life.

662
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,253
As you can see,

663
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:24,487
the news of my demise
is vastly exaggerated.

664
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:29,329
The President now declares
business as usual in Havana.

665
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,431
I lend a helping hand to
those law-abiding citizens

666
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,400
and our loyal oppositions.

667
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:45,204
The future of Cuba is safe.

668
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,442
Abuelo!

669
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:54,347
Our children are safe.

670
00:44:58,394 --> 00:45:00,362
That is all.

671
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,465
Salud.

672
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,373
Life is becoming
a dress rehearsal

673
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,503
for a show nobody'll see.

674
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,318
What's the word on Luis?

675
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:23,478
He's nowhere to be found.

676
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,454
Are you sure he's alive?

677
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,280
Positive.

678
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,385
He might be abroad.

679
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,351
I'm leaving.

680
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,362
I'm leaving.

681
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,371
I'm sorry.
There's no news.

682
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:48,344
Was he part of the attack?

683
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:49,375
Yes.

684
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,447
Why won't you tell me where he is?

685
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,280
Because I don't know where he is.

686
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,514
Fico, if something happens,

687
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,489
I want to be there...

688
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,489
for him.

689
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:01,490
So do I.

690
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:22,349
May I offer a serious thought

691
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:24,326
from someone who's never serious?

692
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:26,452
No.

693
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,498
Well, that was it.

694
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,418
Mmm.

695
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,449
It's good.

696
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:05,264
A man with a purpose.

697
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,492
A man with less of a purpose.

698
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,331
Fellove, come on.
Please join me.

699
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:38,492
Mmm. Mmm!

700
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,309
In our house,

701
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,311
Sunday dinner is not
a moveable feast.

702
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,318
It is at 6, as usual.

703
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,351
Sorry.

704
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,452
All my sons are welcome, but...

705
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:05,289
not a minute after6.

706
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,367
You must always chew.
It's good for your health.

707
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,233
You chew and you chew.

708
00:51:15,271 --> 00:51:16,398
Mmm.

709
00:51:16,405 --> 00:51:18,373
And then you chew some more.

710
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:26,338
See, I'm a man of...
good digestion.

711
00:51:26,382 --> 00:51:31,445
In fact, if I wasn't
such a modest man,

712
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:33,422
I'd say I'm a man
of great digestion.

713
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,322
That's why I'm still alive.

714
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:40,259
About our little business...

715
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,391
our business?

716
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:47,469
Yeah, our business.

717
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,371
My business is El Tropico.

718
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:52,398
And I would love to continue
going to El Tropico.

719
00:51:56,445 --> 00:52:01,280
So unless that's a prop
for one of your new shows...

720
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:07,353
I'm asking myself,

721
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:09,324
what is a song and dance man

722
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:10,326
because that's what you do, huh?

723
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,494
Just a little song and dance,

724
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:13,496
and you put on a little show

725
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:15,465
doing with a.32 caliber
Smith & Wesson?

726
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,494
What? Hey!

727
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,367
What?

728
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:23,369
What, are you planning
to shoot your piano player?

729
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:26,509
Do you have a new
cowboy routine

730
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,373
in El Tropico now,
or something?

731
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,485
Any word from Ricardo?

732
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:39,422
No.

733
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,360
Why were you late
for dinner tonight?

734
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,396
Hmm?

735
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,494
I have enemies.

736
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:56,271
Cono.

737
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,304
And I have the right
to protect myself.

738
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,333
Cono.

739
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:05,313
Fellove, am I your enemy?

740
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:08,382
You weren't my enemy until
you killed my brother.

741
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:13,422
Luis Fellove, alias Peligro.

742
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,260
Not angel,

743
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:19,420
not the Virgin Mary

744
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,422
Peligro!

745
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:24,262
I swear,
I did not kill your brother.

746
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,326
Your brother attacked
the Presidential Palace

747
00:53:27,503 --> 00:53:29,472
with the intent to kill
my President.

748
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,338
He committed suicide.

749
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:41,315
Believe me, you do not want
to disappoint me.

750
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:42,248
Trust me on this.

751
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:49,288
I can see
all you have is thirst for revenge.

752
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,391
Ah, I see.

753
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:04,498
You know what a zugzwang is?

754
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,338
It's a chess move.

755
00:54:06,342 --> 00:54:07,434
Mm-hmm.

756
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:12,311
It is a chess move
that is no move at all.

757
00:54:14,483 --> 00:54:17,452
It is actually a position

758
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,255
the position in which each player

759
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,317
will obtain a worse result

760
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:29,387
if it were his time to move

761
00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:32,333
than if it were not.

762
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,338
Do you follow?

763
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,405
A double-bind.

764
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,503
A reciprocal situation.

765
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:47,476
All you have to do
is act accordingly.

766
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:49,384
Which means...

767
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:58,460
Do not act at all.

768
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:00,489
Go.

769
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,244
Ho ho ho!

770
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:17,405
Hey, hey!

771
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,382
Bravissimo, Fellove!
Bravissimo!

772
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:23,215
A showman to the end!

773
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,452
One more audition.

774
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,530
So just about any
clothes fit you, huh?

775
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:49,503
She's very lonely.

776
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,378
Ever since she moved in,
she won't go out at all.

777
00:55:53,248 --> 00:55:54,510
Not even with her friends.

778
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:59,385
The memory of your brother,

779
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,356
and the fact that she
has not been able

780
00:56:01,523 --> 00:56:05,324
to have a family of her own...

781
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,329
I hate to see her so sad.

782
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:09,264
It breaks my heart.

783
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,467
Why don't you ask her out?

784
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:14,429
She would like that.

785
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,268
It would do her good.

786
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:23,233
She needs you, and you need her.

787
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,248
Fico, talk to me.

788
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,340
Please.

789
00:57:07,389 --> 00:57:10,382
You know the last thing
Luis said to me before he died?

790
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:15,456
What?

791
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:17,458
He made me promise...

792
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:21,461
that if anything ever happened to
him,

793
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:23,335
I would take care of you.

794
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,420
You've grown up in Havana all your
life,

795
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,454
and I bet there's parts of the
city you don't know at all.

796
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:48,422
I'm sure you know them well.

797
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:49,523
You know...

798
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,297
Havana's very much like a rose.

799
00:57:53,335 --> 00:57:57,295
It has petals, and it has thorns.

800
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:58,432
So it depends on how you grab it.

801
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,240
But in the end,
it always grabs you.

802
00:58:07,382 --> 00:58:09,476
Why don't you come out
with me tomorrow?

803
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:11,349
It'll do you good.

804
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,523
You ever see Beny Mor? Live?

805
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,362
Mmm.

806
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,364
Ah!

807
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,275
Have you been to
the Tropical Beer Gardens?

808
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,411
Ah!

809
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,518
It's good to see you smile.

810
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:23,449
Thank you.

811
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,289
Why are their handkerchiefs?

812
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:29,425
The handkerchiefs
are so there's no evidence.

813
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,398
Of what?

814
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:35,371
Of the intimacy they're sharing.

815
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:52,514
Beny! Beny!

816
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:58,391
Beny! Beny! Beny!

817
00:59:58,393 --> 00:59:59,519
Beny! Beny!

818
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,364
Where is he?

819
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:03,523
He's always late.

820
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:09,369
Beny! Beny! Beny!

821
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,268
Beny! Beny!

822
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,271
He likes to make an entrance.

823
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,402
There he is.

824
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,318
How many more are in the barracks?

825
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:14,487
Come on. Come on.

826
01:02:14,496 --> 01:02:16,327
How many more are in the barracks?

827
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,492
Fellove!

828
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:24,496
Let's move. Don't waste
any time with that.

829
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:25,507
Let's move.

830
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,309
You seem troubled, Fellove.

831
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,384
Is it about the captain we shot?

832
01:02:36,251 --> 01:02:38,516
Listen to me very carefully.

833
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,318
In an insurrection,

834
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,324
the end justifies the means.

835
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:45,418
What is an insurrection?

836
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,394
Huh?

837
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:48,396
Armed struggle.

838
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,358
What is the end?

839
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:52,425
Revolution.

840
01:02:52,467 --> 01:02:56,403
Which entails social, economic,
and political transformations.

841
01:02:58,273 --> 01:02:59,240
Like I said?

842
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:03,434
The end justifies the means.

843
01:03:03,445 --> 01:03:05,277
Hmm?

844
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:52,420
This is Havana.

845
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,458
Who said a woman
is like a flower?

846
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,295
A poet with a sense of smell.

847
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:09,460
May I join you?

848
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,302
Yes.

849
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,340
What was your name again?

850
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:24,318
My name again is no name.

851
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,445
What do you mean?

852
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,456
I don't mean nothing!

853
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,460
Names don't mean, people do.

854
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,429
But you are people, aren't you?

855
01:05:36,264 --> 01:05:41,293
That... nobody can deny.

856
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,271
So what's your name, then?

857
01:05:44,472 --> 01:05:46,304
I have no name.

858
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,402
I already told you that.

859
01:05:48,443 --> 01:05:50,275
Everybody has a name.

860
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:53,407
Mm-hmm.
Everybody but me.

861
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,416
Why not?

862
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:02,253
I don't know.

863
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,259
Ask him.

864
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,260
Leave me out of your puns.

865
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:10,228
You're the strangest man
I ever met.

866
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:19,507
Thank you.

867
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,344
Thank you.

868
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,344
Okay, Emilio.

869
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:28,507
Your moneys no good here.

870
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:31,320
Thank you, Emilio.

871
01:06:31,353 --> 01:06:32,320
I'll see you at the club.

872
01:06:34,356 --> 01:06:35,324
When I grow up,

873
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,288
I wanna be just like him.

874
01:06:38,393 --> 01:06:40,362
Why?

875
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,492
Because...

876
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:44,327
he never pays.

877
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:55,443
we interrupt
this program with a special news report.

878
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,280
The University of Havana was
closed by the government today,

879
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,309
as a direct result
of the ongoing riots.

880
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,447
President Fulgencio Batista,

881
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,456
who is under intense pressure
to resign,

882
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:10,458
declared publicly today
that the government

883
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:13,518
will not tolerate the disgracing
of the sacred grounds

884
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:15,496
of the university's Plaza Cadena,

885
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,500
which he claims the professional
agitators were using

886
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,367
for their selfish acts of anarchy.

887
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:03,512
She wants to talk to you.

888
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:05,514
It's okay.

889
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,451
El tiempo no estacon ustedes.

890
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:15,347
What did she say?

891
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:17,492
Time is not on our side.
