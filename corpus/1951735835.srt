ABOUT CHANGING HIS NAME
TO SOMETHING
AS NICE AS HOLIDAY.

I HAD VERY LITTLE MONE

210

I BOUGHT A PACK OF GUM
FROM THE SHIP'S STORE.

211
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:57,663
I HAD SEEN AN AMERICAN MOVIE
AND IN IT RICHARD WIDMARK
CHEWED A LOT OF GUM.

212
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,665
I BELIEVED THAT IF
I CHEWED ENOUGH GUM,

213
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:04,170
I WOULD STEP OFF THE SHIP,
TRANSFORMED INTO AN AMERICAN
LIKE RICHARD WIDMARK.

I WENT INSIDE.

THE CASHIER TOOK MY MONEY,
AND SHE COUNTED IT TWICE.

00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,206
MY NEW MONEY,

227
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:44,210
ONE $20 BILL.

228
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,214
I TOOK THAT BILL,
AND I SAT DOWN ON A BENCH
THAT WAS THERE IN THE BANK.

229
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,716
I SAT AND I STARED

230
