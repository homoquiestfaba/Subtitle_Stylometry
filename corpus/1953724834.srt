You still singing?

Hey. Sorry, I was just helping Victoria
with her dance costume.

You wanna come on in

you changed her?

No, sweetie,
Aunt Faith is not getting a divorce.

00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,808
- Nice.
- She didn't hear it from me.

00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,803

- Hey, buddy.

Sweetie, those are pure sugar.

585

when it seemed like everyone else
we knew was cutting back?

664
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:52,790
And all he could say was, "We're just
looking in the right places."

665
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,827
Or "We're smarter."

666

about a Ponzi scheme.

00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,833

right in the eye and denied it.

to him about for better or for worse.

to take it every morning.

for me, and that he loves me,
