00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,594
I'm sorry, Krager.

3
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,729
It just split on me.

4
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,334
Mr. Simmons?

5
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,570
You may want to take a look at this.

6
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,678
Damn.
That's a special order.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,280
That'll set us back 6 weeks.

8
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,682
Just replace it with a standard frame.

9
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:00,352
It's got to be exactly like the original.

10
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,788
It's in the bid.

11
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,190
I can match it.

12
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,328
Who's that?

13
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,395
Noah dearborn.

14
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,532
He's a carpenter god.

15
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,635
When?

16
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,504
Now.

17
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,574
It's almost 3:00,
Mr. Dearborn.

18
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,577
Gimme a couple of hours.

19
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,546
2 hours?

20
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,315
Maybe a little more.
Not much.

21
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,183
No way.

22
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:34,453
No offense, pal.

23
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,757
I can do it.

24
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,333
Got 20 bucks says he can do it.

25
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,669
You're on.

26
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,333
Want to bet?

27
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,702
Come on.
He can do it.

28
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,379
Yep.
Here we go.

29
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,715
$20. You in?

30
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,549
Cash in?

31
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,352
Boy, let's see it.

32
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,588
No way.

33
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,011
When you work with wood...

34
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,248
You gotta have the right set of knives.

35
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,483
If you don't have the right knives,

36
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:15,487
then you got to cut your own.

37
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,793
Noah, I need you to go help your father.

38
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,529
Noah.

39
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,332
Noah.

40
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,537
Mind your mother, boy.

41
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:43,282
Silas, I know he's kin to you,
but he's your brother's boy.

42
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:47,686
He doesn't want to do anything
but watch you work.

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,456
Well, the boy's got this special...

44
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,292
Single-mindedness.

45
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,594
He sets his head to something

46
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:58,997
and shuts out everything else.

47
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,467
I ain't never seen nothin' like it.

48
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,544
Where'd you find this guy?

49
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,614
Noah's the first one on
the jobsite in the morning,

50
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,549
the last one to leave in the evening.

51
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,952
Nothing seems to interest him
but his work.

52
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:25,590
In my mind, that makes him a noble man.

53
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,376
5 minutes left, Noah.

54
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,745
No, he's still gotta paint it.

55
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,447
The hell he does.

56
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,850
Rico, Duncan, mix up those paints.

57
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,518
Noah!

58
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,554
Noah! Noah!

59
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,929
Hoo!

60
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,430
Gonna make it!

61
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,668
There it is!

62
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,621
I put in a little extra
for saving my behind.

63
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,023
You're welcome.
Listen, Noah...

64
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,992
I'll come out to the farm
and let you know

65
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:38,597
when we have something that's
worthy of your special skills.

66
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,065
Mighty kind.

67
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,902
Hey, we're heading down to
the red and gray pub for a few.

68
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,739
Friend asked me to stop by
and look at some repairs.

69
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,575
It'd be unmannerly of me
to leave her waiting,

70
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,811
but thanks just the same.

71
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,880
See you.

72
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,585
You didn't tell him you were the one

73
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,687
who built it in the first place?

74
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,423
Nope.

75
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,023
Why not?

76
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,626
They didn't ask.

77
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,729
How'd you say it broke?

78
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:14,065
I guess it was my niece or my nephew.

79
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:19,571
Table's been in our family
for more than 3 generations.

80
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,744
You ready for your pie?

81
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,114
Yes.

82
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:43,528
There's no hurry.
I'm just glad you can fix it.

83
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,529
My good fortune.

84
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,498
What?

85
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,601
Every time I come here to mend something,

86
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:53,638
there's a hot pie coming out of the oven.

87
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,276
How you doing?

88
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,148
I'm looking for a Noah dearborn.

89
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,683
That's me.

90
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,286
Noah dearborn sr.

91
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:45,257
A gentlemen of about 90 or so?

92
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,093
The... proprietor?

93
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:52,831
Mister, your fancy word
don't change the fact

94
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,933
I'm Noah dearborn.

95
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,169
Well, I see your point there.

96
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:04,142
Well, Noah, when's the last time
you had a really good day?

97
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,844
Today.

98
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:11,783
Ok. When was the last time
you had a really great day?

99
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,120
Can't say I know what you're getting at.

100
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,888
I'm sorry. Let me cut
to the chase here.

101
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,660
And I represent a private
real estate concern,

102
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:26,298
and we are prepared to offer you $300,000

103
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,034
for your land today.

104
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,736
In cash.

105
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,107
350. And that's
a hundred thousand

106
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,744
over the most generous
appraisal of this place, too.

107
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,582
Don't mean to be disrespectful, but...

108
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,651
This land's not for sale.

109
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,889
You drive a hard bargain, sir.

110
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,125
All right. 400,000
in cash today.

111
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,061
What do you think?

112
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,230
No, thank you.

113
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,033
Mr. Dearborn, think about
all the time you'd have

114
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,102
to relax and enjoy your life.

115
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,805
My work's my life.

116
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,240
If you want to stay busy
with all that money,

117
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:12,911
I can get you 2 years work
on this project here.

118
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:23,121
The things you say don't seem
to follow what you're meaning.

119
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,856
You want to buy my land.

120
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:29,127
I told you...
It's not for sale.

121
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,772
I know what he's thinking.

122
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,108
I know what they're all thinking.

123
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,244
Did he give you anything specific?

124
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,781
You mean did I allow him
to insult me further?

125
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,984
Hell, no.
I'm not a glutton.

126
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:57,222
You allow someone to forge
ahead on you like that,

127
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,724
it's a sign of weakness.

128
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,697
Earl, I want to tell you
what I'm hearing you say.

129
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,066
You don't trust the people you work with.

130
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,870
You don't feel appreciated by your boss.

131
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,940
You can't wait to leave
the office every day.

132
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:20,011
Now, if you were to envision
yourself in a different job,

133
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,380
surrounded by new people,

134
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,150
would you like what you do?

135
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,753
I don't know. I never
thought about that.

136
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:32,090
I want you to think about it.

137
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,028
All right.

138
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,265
But we're out of time now.

139
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,968
Same time next week?

140
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,403
Yes, that's right.

141
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,404
Good-bye, doctor.

142
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,408
Take care now.

143
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,483
This is Dr. Crane.

144
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,152
My love, how are you?

145
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,454
Missing you.

146
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,888
Me, too.

147
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,824
Where are you, in the city?

148
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:09,427
Still stuck down here
in mayberry, r.F.D.

149
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,996
Christian...

150
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,031
Yeah?

151
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,466
Are you forgetting anything?

152
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:19,204
The John Portman exhibit, right?

153
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,073
I'm really up against it
down here, honey.

154
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,409
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

155
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,745
I'm still 2 hours out of the city.

156
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,114
I just can't make it back in time.

157
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,984
Call me later.
Maybe I'll pick up.

158
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,920
Ouch. That hurt.

159
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,356
Bye.

160
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,097
On this dearborn property,

161
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,432
if we secure this loan in 29 days,

162
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,968
it's a $50 million project, people.

163
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,069
Let's get on it, ok?

164
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,406
Well, give him some time to mull it over.

165
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,808
He'll come around.

166
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,176
I'm not so sure.

167
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:36,414
I'm not so sure this is the
Noah dearborn we're after.

168
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,450
The deed says the man's pushing 100,

169
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,986
but the guy I talked to
didn't look a day over 55.

170
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:46,491
Maybe he killed the old man
and assumed his identity.

171
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,896
Maybe the guy is just deluded.

172
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:55,533
Then you'd have a case
for mental incompetency,

173
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,935
and we could push for him

174
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,269
becoming a ward of the state.

175
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,939
Well, we know he's incompetent.

176
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:04,142
Who else would turn down
that amount of money?

177
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:08,880
Well... I'd like to meet
the man myself.

178
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,249
My daddy always said...

179
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,552
"The eyes never lie."

180
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,624
If he's deranged...

181
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,560
I'll get him out of there.

182
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,562
Gentlemen.

183
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,468
This mental incompetency thing,

184
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,338
how do you prove something like that?

185
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,174
Well, there was this case last year

186
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,408
up in Lincoln county.

187
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,412
They got a letter from
an accredited psychologist.

188
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,314
There was a comprehension hearing

189
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,884
and the old lady was
declared mentally unstable.

190
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:50,321
The estate was awarded to the county.

191
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,928
So when are you two ever
going to get hitched?

192
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,330
We're not thinking about that right now.

193
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,065
What? If you ask me, val,

194
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,534
guys like Christian don't
fall off turnip trucks.

195
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:06,137
You're really pushy, you know that?

196
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,973
I don't know.
I don't listen to you.

197
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,377
Hi, Sterling.

198
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,112
Hello, ladies.

199
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:16,247
Hi.

200
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,517
So, how's the criminal records division?

201
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,186
Lots of criminals, lots of records.

202
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,689
You're changing the subject again.

203
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,959
Nothing.
It's just my pager.

204
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,995
Speak of the devil.

205
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:34,232
You're an educated 21st century woman.

206
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,934
Val, don't be so accommodating.

207
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,569
I'll be right back.

208
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:43,942
Listen, sweetie,
could you do me a big favor?

209
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,544
I need you to meet me down
there in that little town,

210
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,513
just for a couple of days.

211
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,415
It's kind of important.

212
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,216
What's so urgent?

213
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,452
It's not urgent.

214
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,388
Just need you there for moral support.

215
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,360
Plus, there's this thing
I need to discuss with you.

216
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,329
What thing?

217
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,431
I'll tell you when you get down there.

218
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:10,268
I'm gonna have to reschedule
a lot of appointments.

219
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:15,206
Please, honey, I wouldn't ask
you if it wasn't important.

220
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:19,377
Well, I'll definitely
make it worth your while.

221
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,479
Ok?

222
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,247
I gotta go.

223
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,716
So go already.

224
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,418
Ok. Bye-bye.

225
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,407
Noah dearborn.

226
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,244
Yes, sir?

227
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,347
Robert Murphy.

228
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,718
I was told to look for an older,
good-looking gentleman,

229
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,454
but, you look like you're fit enough

230
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,755
to still be throwing a javelin.

231
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,758
I don't mean to be
disrespectful, but I...

232
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,395
Got the same answer
I gave the other fella.

233
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:49,801
This is a beautiful piece
of property you have here.

234
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:53,771
Do you split and stack
all this wood by yourself?

235
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,139
Yes, sir.

236
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,507
Got a spell to go, though.

237
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,543
Well, I'll help you.

238
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,145
There's no sense in me
taking up all your time

239
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:05,616
that's ok.
I can manage by myself.

240
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,594
Ok.

241
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:33,945
Stuck.

242
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,199
Water?

243
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,804
Can't remember the last time a stranger

244
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,540
offered to help me with my chores.

245
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,610
I'm just glad to get out of that suit

246
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:06,911
and do some manual labor.

247
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,413
I feel younger already.

248
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,292
Thank you.

249
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,199
You make wine, too?

250
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,536
No. Apple Brandy.

251
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,639
Do you mind if I have a taste?

252
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:38,643
I guess you earned it.

253
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,243
What... what did you say you came here for?

254
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:17,515
We're gonna get right back
on schedule as soon as...

255
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,417
Right.

256
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,452
Well... well, how high an offer

257
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,822
am I authorized to make, sir?

258
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,225
Ok.

259
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,793
Well, twin pines mall

260
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,628
is going to be a tremendous success, sir.

261
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,600
And, have a good time on your cruise.

262
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,674
And you are?

263
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,410
Come here.

264
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,380
Good to see you.

265
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,616
For me?

266
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:52,950
Maybe.
Open it.

267
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,621
Open it now.
Hurry. Come on.

268
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,557
Just a little something I picked up.

269
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,392
Ahem.

270
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,395
They're beautiful.

271
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,563
You like 'em?

272
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,498
Try it on.

273
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,466
Yeah.

274
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,034
Yeah, come on.

275
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,003
You put it on.

276
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,271
You like that?

277
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:13,938
You like it?

278
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,506
You look beautiful.

279
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,441
What was so urgent?

280
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,711
What was so urgent?
I'll show ya.

281
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:26,484
This Scott woman had
this beautiful estate

282
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,785
reduced to squalor.

283
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,487
She'd fired all of her staff,

284
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,521
the grounds were ruined,

285
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:34,625
so you think this dearborn man
is like that?

286
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,494
I hope not.

287
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,828
I am concerned, though.

288
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,499
He seems a little... a little off.

289
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,368
So, if you can prove
he's mentally unstable,

290
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,704
then you can have him
removed from his home.

291
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:50,041
I don't want anybody
removed from their home,

292
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:52,510
but he's out there all alone,

293
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,577
and if he's not well,

294
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,546
it might be that he's better off

295
00:21:55,548 --> 00:22:00,518
plus, we're willing to pay him
very well for his land.

296
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,787
How much?

297
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,655
650.

298
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,758
It must be a great piece of land.

299
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,994
Go.

300
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,366
What? What'd I say?

301
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,568
No, I just feel a little
weird about this.

302
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,073
Look, I know this is
really sudden, but...

303
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,508
I just want your take on this guy.

304
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,609
Ok.

305
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,778
See what I can do.

306
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,749
I win.

307
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:00,544
Is she a Jersey, the... the white one?

308
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,746
Holstein.

309
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:04,515
My parents have a place north of here.

310
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,517
I used to spend summers there, and th...

311
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:11,021
This place makes me wish
they weren't selling it.

312
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,426
Neighbor had a big Jersey, and I...

313
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,695
Used to help milk her.

314
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,699
Come a long way from...

315
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:25,736
Milking your neighbor's cow.

316
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,408
I'm Valerie crane.

317
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,680
All this attention here lately...

318
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,518
Making me feel a little important.

319
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,052
Lots of visitors?

320
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,821
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,823
Are you Noah dearborn?

322
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:51,629
I mean, is there another Noah dearborn?

323
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,631
No.

324
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,499
I know this will sound forward,

325
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:58,869
especially coming from a stranger.

326
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,507
How old are you?

327
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,010
I'm not selling my land.

328
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,578
I... I'm not here to buy.

329
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,448
A friend asked me to come and meet you.

330
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,717
Your friend made you come all this way

331
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,586
to find out how old I am?

332
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:18,189
No. Actually,
I heard you own

333
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:21,125
one of the last unblemished
pieces of property.

334
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,727
I wanted to come and meet the owner,

335
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,830
maybe talk a little.

336
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,867
Mile past the first stop sign in town,

337
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,469
you see a sign for mccellan's.

338
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,604
Nice place. Nice lady
name of Sarah.

339
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:36,607
She likes to talk
about as much as you do.

340
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,908
Makes nice pie.

341
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,876
Excuse me...

342
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,945
I don't mean to be disrespectful,

343
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:41,979
but all you people

344
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,114
come out here dressed as lambs,

345
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,817
but you smell like foxes.

346
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,620
Have a nice day.

347
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,571
This is Evelyn.

348
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:08,672
Hi, it's val.

349
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,542
Listen, how would I find out
the age of a person

350
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,277
who doesn't want to give it?

351
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,945
Ask one of his relatives, val.

352
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,114
Please, Evelyn, this is important.

353
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:20,251
Well, there's the social security office,

354
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:21,819
the dmv,

355
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:22,887
or if you had a friend

356
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,089
in the criminal records division...

357
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:31,562
I need some information
on a man named Noah dearborn.

358
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,665
Twin pines...
Have you got that?

359
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,835
See if you can get a photograph, too.

360
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,103
I'm on it.

361
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:40,271
You're a Saint.

362
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:43,674
So, how are things going on down there?

363
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,175
Stop being so nosy.

364
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,011
Heh. I'll stop
being so nosy

365
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,913
when you stop being so secretive.

366
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,648
Ok, got to go. Bye.

367
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,182
Val...

368
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,256
Hi, sue.

369
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,658
How you doing, Marge?

370
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,326
It's good to see you both.

371
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:03,561
Enjoying the Turkey?

372
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:07,665
The best.
Just the best.

373
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,669
Hey.

374
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:13,571
Hey.

375
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,339
What happened?

376
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:20,244
I lied through my teeth,
and he saw right through it.

377
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,279
He's crazy, right?

378
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,815
How could I possibly make that assumption

379
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,151
after a brief conversation?

380
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:30,854
No, honey, I'd have to
sit down with the man,

381
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,256
give him a standardized test,

382
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,626
and then I'd have to discuss my findings

383
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:38,996
wait, wait, wait.
A team of specialists?

384
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:41,599
Psychiatric evaluation team.

385
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,335
Howdy. How you doin'?

386
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:47,137
Is everything going all right here?

387
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,639
Great.
Good.

388
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,274
- Hi.
- Hi.

389
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,611
You must be Sarah.

390
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,647
I hear your pie is very good.

391
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,248
Well, most people think so,

392
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,651
unless they're telling me a big lie.

393
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:01,785
Would you like some?

394
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,921
What is it?
It's peach.

395
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:04,888
Sure.

396
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,791
Comin' right up.

397
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,260
You know, Murphy hadn't
come back to the office

398
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,795
since he went down there.

399
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:16,667
Well, then, I guess
I'm lucky to be alive.

400
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,669
Honey...

401
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:21,038
I promise you when this project is over,

402
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,409
we'll go to Hawaii or something.

403
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:28,679
I want it in writing, please.

404
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,951
I, Christian Nelson, do hereby swear

405
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:34,985
to take...

406
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,427
I hate these.

407
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:48,065
I will be right back.

408
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,401
Sorry.

409
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,918
Would you guys stop paging me
every 23 seconds?

410
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,320
What's the deal?

411
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,722
Really?

412
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,257
That's actually ok, 'cause we're...

413
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,360
Had a sort of a slight
change of plans here.

414
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:20,698
A whole bunch of experts on this thing.

415
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,133
Now, that's the day
they finished the building.

416
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,202
That's my father there on the right.

417
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,438
I was no more than 10 years old.

418
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,240
What a beautiful photograph.

419
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,475
Thank you.

420
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,977
I wish I had more of them.

421
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,780
Who's this man?

422
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:40,050
Well, that's Noah dearborn.

423
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,319
He's, he's kind of a local hero.

424
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,188
He built most of the town.

425
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,791
Is this date right,
though? 1956?

426
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,928
He doesn't seem to have
aged more than a day.

427
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,865
From that big land development,
now, would you?

428
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:58,268
No.
No, I'm, I'm not.

429
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,739
My boyfriend is.
I'm just a bystander.

430
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:06,043
Yeah, I'll have somebody
bring you the bill.

431
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:09,780
Did I say something to offend you?

432
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,517
I'm... I'm sorry.

433
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,520
What was that all about?

434
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,022
I wish I knew.

435
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,795
Why don't you finish this first?

436
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,234
Yes, ma'am.

437
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,433
Well, you best speak your mind.

438
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:06,170
No sense in keeping
all them words inside you

439
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:09,206
when you're fit enough to speak.

440
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,575
Mama says you never get sick.

441
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:15,045
She said the lord
never wants to take you.

442
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:18,315
She said you're
the oldest man in the world.

443
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,221
Well...

444
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:26,857
I'll tell you a secret.

445
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,992
When a man loves his work,

446
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,496
truly loves it...

447
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:38,268
Sickness and death
will get tired of chasing you.

448
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:43,207
And just finally give up
and leave you alone.

449
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:48,045
Clear your mind of all that concerns you

450
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,480
and do the right thing

451
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:54,084
with those hands that god gave you.

452
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,221
You hear me talking to you?

453
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,592
Here we go.
Noah dearborn.

454
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:03,627
No criminal record.

455
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:07,397
Born 1908.
Twin pines, Georgia.

456
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,533
My god.

457
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,135
Nothing.
That helps.

458
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:15,005
That helps a lot.
Thank you.

459
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,559
Hello.

460
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,529
Good afternoon.

461
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,499
Hi.

462
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:52,636
I hope I'm not interrupting.

463
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,306
I was just leavin'.

464
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:19,029
I assure you I won't take up
much of your time.

465
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:22,399
Good. I don't have much
for you to take up.

466
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:26,470
Sarah just about gabbed my ears on fire.

467
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,689
My.

468
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,666
You manage all this without electricity?

469
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,668
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,407
How do you work at night?

471
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,376
I work during the day
when it's light out.

472
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:11,148
If, I have to finish and it's late,

473
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,085
I'll burn a few oil lamps.

474
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:22,559
Have you ever been out
of twin pines before?

475
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,728
Once or twice.

476
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,129
I don't seem to remember.

477
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,532
Would you pass me that rag, please?

478
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,834
So... so you've
never traveled

479
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:34,237
or taken a plane or a train?

480
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,542
It seems to me I took
a train once with my daddy.

481
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:42,546
Can't say I remember when it was.

482
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,849
You ever heard of a musical group

483
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,818
called the Beatles?

484
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,753
No.

485
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,789
Golden gate bridge?

486
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,492
No.

487
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:58,428
Elvis Presley?

488
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,564
Yeah.

489
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,399
Elvis?

490
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,769
Sure.

491
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,311
Mr. Dearborn,
I'm a clinical psychologist,

492
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,314
and I'd just like to talk to you

493
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:18,582
about the way you live,

494
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,417
and maybe I could...

495
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:24,454
Take what I learn and use it somehow...

496
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,858
That's all that's in it for me, honest.

497
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,593
I'm...

498
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:30,794
No fox.

499
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,630
I can't draw a long bow with you.

500
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,599
There's work to be done.

501
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,135
Some folks are longwinded

502
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:41,738
when a small breeze will do just fine.

503
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,577
Mr. Dearborn,
I'm only trying to figure out

504
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,379
how you've stayed the way you are.

505
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:53,150
I mean, how you've managed
to stay so young.

506
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:57,521
Obviously, there's a lot that you know.

507
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,590
Where are we going?

508
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,947
Who's buried here?

509
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,483
My folks.

510
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,252
And Silas.

511
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:38,428
Who's Silas?

512
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,466
My uncle and best friend.

513
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,773
Did you ever get...

514
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,875
Young lady, most of the time,

515
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,978
I like to be alone to do my work.

516
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,215
Now, if that'll help those folks

517
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:00,217
back there in the city feel better

518
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,285
like you want, well...

519
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:03,486
Take that with you.

520
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,789
I understand.

521
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,258
This is a little intrusive.

522
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,427
I'm sorry.

523
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,399
Do you ever get sick?

524
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,835
Ain't got no time to be sick.

525
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,238
So you've never been to a hospital?

526
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
I've got lots of things to do.

527
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,308
Too many questions for one day.

528
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,778
You sure you're not kin
to Sarah mccellan?

529
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,814
He's... he's a miracle.

530
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,883
He's totally uncontaminated
by modern life.

531
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,286
It's as though the world
orbits around him,

532
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:39,289
and he's managed not to engage.

533
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,624
It's his discipline

534
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,525
and his passion for his work, I think,

535
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:45,595
that's... that's kept him so young and...

536
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,564
So he's not gonna sell?

537
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:50,500
Christian, can we leave
that alone for a moment

538
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,770
and appreciate
what's been discovered here?

539
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,339
Am I interrupting something?

540
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,607
Where the hell have you been?

541
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,442
I can come back later.

542
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,610
What happened to you, man?

543
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,412
You left us high and dry.

544
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:05,515
I apologize, Christian, but...

545
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,485
I'm not practicing law anymore.

546
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:11,454
Well, that's... that's a good one.

547
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,824
Yeah. Yeah, I'm selling
my shares in the firm.

548
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:18,995
We're buying into
this vineyard in sonoma.

549
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:24,467
And...
I'm gonna be a winemaker.

550
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,470
What?

551
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:32,008
No, please, no.
I'm not staying.

552
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,611
Christian, I just...

553
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:40,517
I just reevaluated everything
in my life and...

554
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,552
And what's important to me.

555
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:43,920
I'm sorry.

556
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,489
I mean, you and I
have made a lot of money

557
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,459
over the years, but...

558
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,461
I just...

559
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:54,564
I just missed out on so much.

560
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,800
What, you mean this?

561
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:57,901
Yeah.

562
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:00,603
I do.

563
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,472
I'll send you a postcard

564
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:06,676
and hopefully a damn good bottle of wine.

565
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,346
Take care.

566
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,430
What's... what's going on?

567
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,835
Tsk. Well, it's a...

568
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:33,770
Good thing you went down there.

569
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,138
Otherwise, you never would have met

570
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,375
that Mr. Hidden treasure
of a man, now, would you?

571
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,642
Look at Murphy.

572
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:43,113
And he just changes
his whole life entirely.

573
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:45,548
Gotta shut that guy down

574
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,686
before he starts his own damn religion.

575
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,425
What?

576
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,161
What?

577
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,665
Valerie?

578
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,770
Valerie?

579
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,786
I'll beat you to the ice cream store.

580
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,421
I'm gonna get chocolate chip.

581
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:27,157
I'm gonna get vanilla.

582
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,494
Noah?

583
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:35,198
Mr. Dearborn!

584
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,137
Hey.

585
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,672
Hello.

586
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,576
Goin' to market?

587
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,044
No. No, young lady.

588
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:52,816
Mind if I ride along?
I've never been in one of these.

589
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:54,083
More questions.

590
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,487
Please? I'd like
to talk to you.

591
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,557
Maybe I can help.

592
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,527
You handy with a hammer and a saw?

593
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,996
I'm afraid not.

594
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,599
Then...

595
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:11,868
What kind of help you talking about?

596
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:15,171
Some people would argue
that by giving up your land

597
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:19,175
you'd make a considerable
amount of money to retire on.

598
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,744
Where would I go?

599
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,080
When they had the idea
round to begin with.

600
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:27,617
I could have saved them
a lot of time and worry.

601
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:30,954
You understand you're
going to have to fight this?

602
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,155
A man has to fight for something

603
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,857
that belongs to him in the first place

604
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:35,892
don't seem right.

605
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,762
Don't you get lonely?

606
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:41,631
No.

607
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:44,667
You ever been married?

608
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,935
No.

609
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,872
Handsome man like you?

610
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:50,240
Hard to marry when you're...

611
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:53,510
Always tripping over your own tongue.

612
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:57,247
Sarah mccellan doesn't
seem to feel that way.

613
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,117
Being alone don't seem to me

614
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,119
like such a bad thing.

615
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:06,556
What about your family?
Your uncle Silas?

616
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,057
You said he was your best friend.

617
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:12,161
You sure ask a lot of questions.

618
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,296
After a while, answering them

619
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:16,599
is like tossin' 55-pound bags of cement.

620
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:19,135
It just wears you out.

621
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:48,131
Mr. Dearborn.
Mr. Dearborn.

622
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:49,732
Hi, Mr. Dearborn.

623
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,000
Hi.

624
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:52,902
Hi.

625
00:42:57,676 --> 00:43:00,343
Hello!

626
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:03,079
Hello!

627
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,581
Afternoon.

628
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,249
Afternoon.

629
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,251
Brought you some things.

630
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,086
Came to fix the door.

631
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,854
That's very kind of you.

632
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,324
I wasn't expecting company.

633
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:16,693
Ain't no company.

634
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:19,729
Won't take but a minute.

635
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,600
Look at them ears.

636
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,368
Big as a cat.

637
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,170
Big as a cat.

638
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,071
Good year this year.

639
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,839
Do you want some lemonade?

640
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,040
That'll be nice.

641
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,308
And for your friend?

642
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,345
This is miss Valerie.

643
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:40,183
She be askin' a lot of questions.

644
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:42,251
That's her job.

645
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,037
Does he come here often?

646
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:03,673
The kids think he's Santa claus,

647
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:06,209
only Mr. Dearborn comes
more than once a year.

648
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,644
We weren't expecting

649
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:11,214
a new screen door, though.

650
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:16,319
You need to treat your home
with a little more care.

651
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:21,224
All right,
Mr. Dearborn.

652
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,408
Well, best be off.

653
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,043
Ma'am.

654
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,678
Thanks again.

655
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,712
Be back soon enough.

656
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:43,946
Thank you for the drink.

657
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:45,682
Any time.

658
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,951
She didn't ask too many questions.

659
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:51,988
She's quiet as a baby barn owl.

660
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,691
She likes to talk to me.

661
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:57,894
Of course, she thinks I don't know much.

662
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:01,831
That way she can help other folks.

663
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,874
Bye.

664
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,185
Lemonade go down wrong?

665
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,120
No, no.

666
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,423
How long you been doing this?

667
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:32,261
As long as I've grown
more than I could eat.

668
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,377
Take care.

669
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:56,486
There is a man that came to see you,

670
00:45:56,488 --> 00:46:02,759
and something that you said
must have changed his life.

671
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,295
Can't say I know what
you're going on about.

672
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,297
A man called Murphy.

673
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,332
The lawyer fella.

674
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:11,801
Yeah.
What did you say to him?

675
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:13,002
Didn't say much.

676
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:15,972
He had a bit of apple Brandy.

677
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,507
He seemed to do most of the talking,

678
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:21,844
said something about
wanting to make wine.

679
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:32,421
That was it? You didn't
tell him anything or...

680
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:35,258
I was just asking what good
is wanting to do something

681
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,093
without going on and doing it.

682
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:39,796
He's a nice man.

683
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:41,464
Very smart.

684
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,132
Like you.

685
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,968
He wasn't much on chopping wood, though.

686
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,522
Mr. Dearborn,
we have a court order.

687
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,929
Right this way, sir.

688
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:05,248
So, let's call the utility company...

689
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,251
What in heaven's name have you done?

690
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:10,953
Let's take a quick break, shall we?

691
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:13,222
My god, that's a little
extreme, don't you think?

692
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,358
Extreme?
You pay someone to lie,

693
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,093
you have a man removed from his home

694
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:18,060
so you can make some money?

695
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:21,264
Besides, you had nothing
to do with that part of it.

696
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:22,899
You're the one who dragged me down there

697
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:26,469
Valerie, I'm sorry you think
that I misled you,

698
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:28,671
but I happen to care
about my life and career.

699
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:30,206
And I want you to be part of it,

700
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,041
but you're not letting me.

701
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:33,109
Where is he?

702
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:37,146
He's being properly evaluated.

703
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,683
Honey, you know, Valerie...

704
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:43,986
Valerie, I think you just got a little

705
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:45,321
too involved, honey.

706
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:47,556
Ok? Honey?

707
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,716
I'm... I'm sorry to bother you.

708
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:17,420
You should have left him alone.

709
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,056
Where's he gone?

710
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:21,157
Some men took him.

711
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:24,327
All of you should be ashamed.

712
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:30,299
I know I'm a stranger, but I'm a doctor.

713
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,102
I'm the only person
who can help him right now,

714
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,004
and you can't.

715
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,707
You people treat him
like he's some kind of god.

716
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:38,741
He's just a lonely old...

717
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,576
Let me tell you something.

718
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:42,144
You know, several years ago,

719
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:46,615
Noah's best friend
in the world passed on.

720
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:47,984
Silas.

721
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:48,985
And after he was gone,

722
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:50,486
Noah just seemed to shut down.

723
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,389
It was years before
anyone heard him speak.

724
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:57,226
All he'd do from sunup
to sundown is work.

725
00:49:57,228 --> 00:50:00,363
Finally, one day, all of us felt so bad,

726
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:03,299
we got together, we got Noah a dog.

727
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:05,501
He took care of him, he fed him,

728
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,237
he even let him sleep inside the barn,

729
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,373
but you know something?

730
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:14,477
He never once touched that dog.

731
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:16,712
He never pet him.

732
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:21,650
I don't understand.

733
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:26,055
Noah can't touch things he cares about.

734
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,591
Somehow, by god's will,

735
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:30,493
the further away he stays

736
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,294
from everything but his work,

737
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:35,097
the more he's protected.

738
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:38,367
You come here from I don't know where.

739
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,203
To you it may seem a little unfit,

740
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,339
but that's what makes
the man the way he is.

741
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:47,376
What's unfit to me is that
he's locked up somewhere,

742
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,780
and I can't help him
unless you tell me where he is.

743
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:53,215
Well...

744
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,451
They got him in the mental hospital.

745
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,054
It's 2 counties north.

746
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:32,721
You should go look in on your father.

747
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,391
I can't.

748
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,360
What do you mean you can't?

749
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:40,596
Your daddy is sick.

750
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,432
Go look in on him.

751
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,835
All right.

752
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,213
Noah, c-come here, son.

753
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,756
Come here, son.

754
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:44,326
Don't be disrespectful.

755
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:56,338
They're going to take me to the hospital.

756
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,775
You the man of the house now.

757
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:05,915
These 35 acres here gonna be yours.

758
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,863
You...

759
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:24,600
You take care of your mama, you hear?

760
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:25,214
You t-t...

761
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:38,347
Mr. Dearborn, do you
know why you're here?

762
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,917
No.

763
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,654
Mr. Dearborn, a board
certified physician

764
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:48,791
sent us a letter stating
you were displaying

765
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:53,395
strange and peculiar behavior.

766
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,231
Yes, in this letter,

767
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,933
he stated that you may be a danger

768
00:53:57,935 --> 00:54:00,569
to yourself and others.

769
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,272
So, we've been ordered by the court

770
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:04,840
to keep you under observation

771
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:08,711
for a minimum required amount of time.

772
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,649
Do you understand,
Mr. Dearborn?

773
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:17,853
I can't say that I do.

774
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,890
I don't mean to be disrespectful

775
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:23,826
to you all,

776
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:27,463
but I got a lot of work to do.

777
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,699
Have a good day.

778
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:41,377
Would any of you happen to have the key?

779
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:44,980
Mr. Dearborn.

780
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,550
We have a lot of questions to ask you.

781
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,886
That's going to be kind of hard.

782
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:55,791
You see, I don't have much to say.

783
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,306
I don't like it here.

784
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,444
Where's the psychiatric ward?

785
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:18,447
Elevator's down the hall
and on the right.

786
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:19,481
Thank you.

787
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:25,054
Have you lost interest
in social activities?

788
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,326
You mean like playing the fiddle

789
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:32,961
or going to the barn dance?

790
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,863
Yes.

791
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:40,336
There's never enough time during the day.

792
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:42,404
I sleep at night.

793
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,907
Mr. Dearborn,

794
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:48,877
have you ever had any long relationships?

795
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,717
I had a dog.

796
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,588
With another human.

797
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,927
I have friends.

798
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:06,462
Friends?

799
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:08,697
Don't you know what they are?

800
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:13,535
What are we trying to
establish here, Mr. Dearborn,

801
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:20,042
is whether you have
physical contact with anyone.

802
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:26,582
Do you ever have suicidal thoughts?

803
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,589
That's...

804
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,424
Not a very kind thing

805
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:39,495
to ask a fella you don't even know.

806
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,865
Hello,
I'm Dr. Valerie crane,

807
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:45,634
and I believe you have
a man under 72-hour hold.

808
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:48,003
He was brought in today.
His name is dearborn.

809
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:49,872
Yes, the doctors are with him now.

810
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:51,774
Where is he?
I need to see him.

811
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:53,075
He's being evaluated.

812
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,411
I'll need clearance
to take you back there.

813
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:57,179
I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

814
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,615
If there's been one tiny infraction

815
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:03,118
I'll have the board of
medical quality assurance

816
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,487
you won't be able to get another job

817
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:07,423
for the rest of your life.

818
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:08,857
Is that enough clearance for you?

819
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:11,427
Down the hall on
the left. Room 315.

820
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,462
Wait. I have to
notify the doctors

821
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:14,430
that you're coming.

822
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:15,864
Then notify them.
Wait!

823
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:18,066
Do you ever recall having trouble

824
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:21,103
suppressing disturbing thoughts?

825
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,704
What do you mean?

826
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:25,607
Well, do you ever have bad thoughts

827
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,545
that you cannot hold inside?

828
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,980
Well...

829
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:33,215
I'm starting to feel

830
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:35,651
that you people ought to be ashamed

831
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:37,553
of asking all these questions

832
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:39,822
that don't mean nothing.

833
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:43,859
Gentlemen,
I'm Dr. Crane.

834
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:49,465
Noah, would you go with
this young lady for a moment?

835
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,033
I have some information for the doctors

836
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:54,036
that they'll be
more than interested to hear.

837
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:12,588
Never taught you one bit of manners.

838
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,728
Are you all right?

839
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:23,031
I don't like hospitals.

840
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:25,133
Too many sick people.

841
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,203
I feel like you deserve
a very big apology

842
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,739
for what's happened.

843
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:36,178
I'm not the only one who owes it to you.

844
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,747
You ever been in a car like this?

845
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:42,117
Yes. Fella gave me
a ride to work

846
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:46,154
in one lots like this one.

847
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,157
Can't understand much.

848
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:52,194
You mean why they took you
from your property?

849
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:56,765
So many buttons and gadgets.

850
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,133
What?

851
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,168
Can't understand why

852
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:04,206
folks need to know more
than how fast they're travelin'

853
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:07,609
and how much gas is in the tank.

854
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:11,079
No, I know you're not gonna
like what I'm gonna say,

855
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:15,217
but we have a term for what
you're doing right now.

856
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,619
It's called avoidance.
You see...

857
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:21,123
You're making your mind
think about something else

858
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:26,862
in order to not deal with
what you're really feeling.

859
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,598
Noah?

860
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,166
Truck.

861
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,569
My god!

862
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,908
Maybe there should be a button

863
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,278
for keeping you to go straight.

864
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,822
She did what?

865
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,891
You... you didn't...

866
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,327
No. Don't... don't
get hysterical.

867
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:01,363
No, you... you're not
gonna lose your licenses.

868
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:02,831
Just sit tight.

869
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,933
Yeah. Ok.

870
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:12,040
This machine's out of money.

871
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,609
I'll just write a check.

872
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:16,044
I'll be right back.

873
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,189
Honey, I have the receipt.

874
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:28,890
All right.

875
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:36,031
Hmmph! Darn thing
is always out of money

876
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:39,034
when you need it most.

877
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:45,407
I don't want to go.

878
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,266
Hope I didn't take too long.

879
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:13,001
No.

880
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,342
Shall we go?

881
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:32,954
Thank you for spending the day with me.

882
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:38,293
I guess it was kind of
selfish of me to keep you.

883
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:53,041
I bought you some books.

884
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:58,780
I didn't even think to ask you.

885
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:01,483
"Book of five rings"?

886
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,151
If you wanted to know if I read,

887
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:06,054
you might've just asked.

888
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,491
"Wuthering heights."

889
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,827
It's a classic.

890
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:14,863
It's about doomed and unrequited love.

891
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:19,835
It's one of my favorites,
and I thought you...

892
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:27,776
Noah, I know Silas was a great man,

893
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:31,113
and he taught you really well...

894
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:33,815
But he didn't teach you everything.

895
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:38,320
We need other people to survive.

896
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,325
Sun's going down.

897
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,995
I got things to do.

898
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,899
More questions tomorrow?

899
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:51,933
No.

900
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,468
I'm going to be leaving.

901
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,938
I think I'll go visit my parents' farm.

902
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,974
Then I should thank you now

903
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:03,011
for looking after me when you did.

904
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:04,813
Thank you.

905
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,552
Noah.

906
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:12,387
Yeah?

907
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,124
You don't have to give up your land.

908
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,426
I don't aim to.

909
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:22,430
I'm sorry, what I said before in the car

910
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,032
about denial.

911
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:27,969
I guess it's just my nature to...

912
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,139
Try to help.

913
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,541
Don't get your dander up, young lady.

914
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:37,112
I wasn't paying much
attention to it anyhow.

915
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:43,018
I'd really like to spend...

916
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,222
Never mind.

917
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:49,925
Bye.

918
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:51,860
That word you used...

919
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:54,362
Avoid something or other?

920
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:58,266
I thought you weren't paying attention.

921
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:11,346
I'm going to miss you.

922
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:21,089
Young lady...

923
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,892
If you find yourself back this way,

924
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:26,461
and you need some money,

925
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:32,133
you don't have to fret with a machine.

926
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:36,972
I got plenty under the mattress.

927
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:42,344
Thank you.

928
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,678
Down creek.

929
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,146
You set it down there yet?

930
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,716
Yeah, see, the property line...

931
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,318
Good morning.

932
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,420
Did you sleep well?

933
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:35,590
Well enough.
Thank you.

934
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:38,093
Are you leaving us so soon?

935
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:38,760
Yes, I am.

936
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:42,364
I'm sorry to see you go.

937
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:48,636
Well, I'll get your bill.

938
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,708
Be just a moment, dear.

939
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,616
You have a lovely family.

940
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,552
Yes, I have.

941
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,721
Do you have children?

942
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:07,655
No.

943
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:10,258
A fine young lady like you

944
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,395
will have a prince real soon.

945
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:17,532
Unfortunately, he's old enough
to be my grandfather.

946
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,034
Are... are you those people

947
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:22,237
who come to build the shopping center?

948
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,039
No, I'm happy to say.

949
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:27,175
No. No, I'm not.

950
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,478
It's a shame about Noah.

951
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,580
You know Mr. Dearborn?

952
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:34,416
My.

953
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:36,684
Some say when god comes down

954
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,386
to vacation on earth,

955
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,189
he stays at Noah's.

956
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:44,526
That's why people keep him such a secret.

957
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:52,367
He's the prince you're referring to.

958
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:56,171
I saw you riding with him in town.

959
01:07:56,173 --> 01:08:00,742
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about, my dear.

960
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,544
My, you won't be the first

961
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:05,080
to fall under his spell.

962
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:09,517
It's been happening longer
than you can imagine.

963
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:11,786
I'm sure you're right.

964
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:16,157
I feel sorry for those city people.

965
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:17,725
Why is that?

966
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:19,727
If they uproot Noah,

967
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:22,864
they're flirting with Providence.

968
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:24,666
Most people are at odds

969
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:25,767
about this new shopping center.

970
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,837
Some families are even split up over it.

971
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:32,674
They say it will bring more jobs,

972
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:33,842
more...

973
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:35,643
How you say it...

974
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:36,778
Revenue?

975
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:40,882
Well, they can go piss off.

976
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,752
This town is just fine

977
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:46,354
the way it is.

978
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,361
Get a blanket, Noah.

979
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,197
All right.

980
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:09,938
Here.

981
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,684
Mother.

982
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,719
Mom.

983
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,561
Mom.

984
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,332
You'll be all right.

985
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,365
Silas.

986
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:21,669
Just pass your plate right over here.

987
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:07,875
Can I speak to Christian Nelson, please?

988
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,179
Well, where is he?

989
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:17,151
What do you mean,
he's breaking ground today?

990
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:24,025
That's good.
Hold it right there.

991
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:27,495
Good, good, good.
Now down.

992
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:41,609
My god.

993
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,203
You all right?

994
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:13,841
You have to talk.

995
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:16,711
It's ok to be angry.

996
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:26,854
Don't let this get to you.

997
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,723
Christian is trying to force your hand.

998
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,858
He's trying to upset you.

999
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,126
The important thing is to remember

1000
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:35,663
that you didn't do anything.

1001
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,834
I'm not selling my land.

1002
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:40,968
I know.

1003
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:43,170
Believe me, I know.

1004
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:45,973
This is my home.

1005
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,545
Used to be nice.

1006
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:51,879
Now...

1007
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,082
It's terrible.

1008
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:57,318
It's noisy.

1009
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:01,088
I got work to do,

1010
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:04,559
but I can't seem to do it.

1011
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:12,033
I can't think with all this.

1012
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,676
You have to trust me.

1013
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:25,079
I'll be right back.

1014
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,035
That's it. Good.

1015
01:16:48,037 --> 01:16:50,304
Tony, I want you to bring the rig on in.

1016
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:05,853
Hey, Valerie.

1017
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:07,254
What are you doing?

1018
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:09,924
What's it look like we're doing?

1019
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:12,326
You can't force him off his property.

1020
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:14,862
I... i do feel terrible about this.

1021
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,831
It's just that we have to break ground

1022
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:20,401
or else all my investors
are going to back out on me.

1023
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:22,103
Investors?

1024
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,904
Yeah.

1025
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:28,009
He doesn't want your money.

1026
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,748
You're a real son of a bitch,

1027
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,950
you know that?

1028
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:37,985
You have no character.

1029
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:40,388
You have no idea what's real.

1030
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:42,356
You never have.

1031
01:17:46,129 --> 01:17:48,929
Because I was doing this for us, ok?

1032
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:51,332
I was doing this for our relationship.

1033
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:54,402
I make my living consoling people

1034
01:17:54,404 --> 01:17:57,138
I promise you, I'll have no trouble

1035
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,707
finding my way out of this one.

1036
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:02,276
I think you're making a...

1037
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:08,115
I think you're making a big mistake!

1038
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,787
Hey, what's she doing?

1039
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:29,403
Is anybody hurt?

1040
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,040
I didn't see anybody behind me.

1041
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:36,010
Get her out!
Get her out!

1042
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,317
Come on, pull.
Pull! Come on!

1043
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:44,385
It's stuck.

1044
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:46,153
Open the other side.

1045
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:47,955
Come on, help me... on 3.

1046
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:48,923
1, 2...

1047
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:51,959
It's no use.

1048
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:04,438
Quick, get out of the way.

1049
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:07,041
It's me.

1050
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,213
Ok.

1051
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:14,115
Ok.

1052
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:18,452
There we go. Easy.
You got her neck there?

1053
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:20,054
You're going to be ok.

1054
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,993
Thanks, Mr. Dearborn.

1055
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:27,962
You didn't come a minute too soon.

1056
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,474
It's ok to be angry.

1057
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:44,445
It's ok...

1058
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,148
To be angry.

1059
01:19:59,529 --> 01:20:03,998
I'm not going to be able to set this

1060
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,032
if you don't hold still.

1061
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:07,468
It's making it worse..

1062
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:11,338
Stop that.

1063
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:18,579
Hi.

1064
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,082
Well, hello.

1065
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:27,454
Noah said you got hurt
trying to help him.

1066
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:28,956
I did.

1067
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,825
I'm sorry.

1068
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,994
I'm sorry, too...

1069
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,364
No, no. It takes
more than a few days

1070
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:41,035
to understand Noah, you know.

1071
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:42,970
I've been breaking furniture for 20 years

1072
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:45,506
just to get him to come and visit me.

1073
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:49,043
Here.

1074
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:54,215
Thank you.

1075
01:20:54,217 --> 01:20:56,150
You're welcome.
Thanks.

1076
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:57,218
What you making?

1077
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,919
A sweater.

1078
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:00,487
It... it's for my mom.

1079
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:01,889
It's pretty.

1080
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:03,891
Thank you.
Do you knit?

1081
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:05,326
Yeah, I do.

1082
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,011
So, how much longer

1083
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:26,113
did they say you had to stay here?

1084
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:28,482
Well, tomorrow, I get my walking cast,

1085
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:29,550
and then I can go.

1086
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:32,119
That's good.

1087
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:36,657
These are incredible.

1088
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:37,958
Thank you.

1089
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,526
I'm glad you like them.

1090
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:43,330
Excuse me, but there's
a gentleman here to see you.

1091
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:56,043
I didn't come to draw a long bow.

1092
01:22:57,739 --> 01:23:01,075
I hope you get better...

1093
01:23:01,077 --> 01:23:03,143
Real soon.

1094
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,679
Thank you.

1095
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:17,157
I read those books.

1096
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:19,026
I like one.

1097
01:23:19,028 --> 01:23:21,695
Didn't care much for heathcliff, though.

1098
01:23:28,771 --> 01:23:33,007
Having a hunger for some of your pies.

1099
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:35,476
Well, I got some ready for the oven,

1100
01:23:35,478 --> 01:23:39,213
but nothing's broken.

1101
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,584
That's fine.

1102
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:47,321
As long as you could use the visit.

1103
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:50,691
Of course I could.

1104
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:56,330
I'll wait outside for you.

1105
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:00,234
I still don't like hospitals.

1106
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:03,604
Noah...

1107
01:24:03,606 --> 01:24:07,408
I never liked hospitals, either.

1108
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:20,421
Ok.

1109
01:24:20,423 --> 01:24:21,555
Take care of yourself.

1110
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,257
You need anything, you call me.

1111
01:24:23,259 --> 01:24:25,259
I'll see you when you get out, now.

1112
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:27,661
Ok. Thank you.
Bye.

1113
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,851
I hope you heal well.

1114
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:35,796
Good morning.

1115
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:37,698
Good morning.

1116
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:41,768
Good morning, young lady.

1117
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:44,638
Good news.

1118
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,741
Christian and his company

1119
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:51,778
they've decided to move on
to a new location.

1120
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,480
They're not coming back.

1121
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:56,884
That's mighty nice to hear.

1122
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:00,354
I hope you don't mind.

1123
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:02,523
I brought you something.

1124
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,492
It's a surprise.

1125
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,311
Come on.

1126
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:40,794
It doesn't have a name.

1127
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:43,797
He will before sundown.

1128
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:53,774
My goodness sake.

1129
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,911
That's a little fella.
