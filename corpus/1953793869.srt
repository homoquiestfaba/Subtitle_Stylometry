1
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:53,908
# I...

2
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,743
# Watch the clock for you

3
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:05,914
# When you

4
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:14,089
# Bid your servant
once adieu #

5
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,525
# So true

6
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:20,628
# A fool is love

7
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,707
# What to do

8
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:26,065
# What to do

9
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:37,610
# For this sin

10
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:41,981
# There's no remedy

11
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:49,622
# We begin

12
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:55,327
# To see what we need

13
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:01,032
# Ooh-ee-hoo

14
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,838
# Ooh-ee-hoo

15
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:28,925
Excuse me.

16
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:32,796
You wouldn't happen to have
an aspirin, would you?

17
00:02:32,798 --> 00:02:35,398
Do I look like a pharmacy?

18
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,135
No, but you look like somebody

19
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,870
who wouldn't let a guy
suffer needlessly.

20
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,744
Tylenol do?

21
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:50,245
Thanks.

22
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:56,852
You don't look like you're in pain.

23
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:59,120
Oh, just got off a flight from London

24
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:01,789
with a music student who was
drumming her way

25
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,225
through Tchaikovsky's sixth
the entire flight.

26
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,861
The sixth doesn't
have a drum part.

27
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:09,263
That's what I told her.

28
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,000
Ahem.

29
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:18,905
Thank you.

30
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,145
I'm flying out tomorrow.

31
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:27,848
And here I just flew in.

32
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,549
Well, they say timing
is everything.

33
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,284
I thought that was location.

34
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:35,988
I have my certification
boards tomorrow.

35
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,223
In what?

36
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:40,726
Embalming.

37
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:43,162
Ow.

38
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:53,471
I need my sleep.

39
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,879
"And sleep nowhere is peaceful

40
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:04,047
but here among the dead. "

41
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,885
# For this sin

42
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:12,022
# There's no remedy

43
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:19,862
# We begin

44
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:25,134
# To see what we need

45
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,840
# Ooh-ee-hoo

46
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,058
How you doin'?

47
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,895
No, no, no, remember
the complete quote

48
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,396
follows the chapter heading?

49
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,798
I thought you were seeing
my mother this morning.

50
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,100
We decided this in the
meeting last week.

51
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,768
She insisted
on running with us.

52
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,370
Jesus, you think
she'd lighten up.

53
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,671
I mean, it's her vacation,
for Christ's sake.

54
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,739
You know, when I was a kid,

55
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,907
she used to pick me up at school

56
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,108
in these white go-go boots

57
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,043
like some aging disco diva.

58
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,211
Very embarrassing.

59
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,046
Where is my manuscript?

60
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,247
The sex book?

61
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,249
Autobiography.

62
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,985
- Uh-huh.
- Hello.

63
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,151
Yes, bring the galleys over here.

64
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:56,252
Thank you.

65
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,420
She's a very interesting woman.

66
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:58,688
I have invited her
out running with us.

67
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,023
Did you remember
the champagne?

68
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:02,325
Champagne.

69
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,928
I thought you were champagne.

70
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,896
No, I'm flowers, catering,
and guest list.

71
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:07,998
You were champagne.

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,332
Jesus, what's he doing?

73
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:14,870
Happy anniversary.

74
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:17,039
- Hey!
- What?

75
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,340
Embalming?

76
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:21,010
I thought you'd like that.

77
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:22,311
It was good.

78
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:23,979
Thank you.

79
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:25,014
Bye, guys.

80
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,317
Busy girl.

81
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,955
James' father?
Do I miss him?

82
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:36,991
Honey, I missed him
more when he was alive.

83
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,761
James always said he wasn't
much of a father.

84
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:41,763
He wasn't much of anything,

85
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:43,230
but that could just be the rage,

86
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:45,132
hurt, and boredom talking.

87
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:47,300
Good morning, everyone.

88
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:48,735
Ah, morning.

89
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,070
Martha, this is my
mother-in-law, Abbie.

90
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:51,371
Hi.

91
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:52,973
And that's Lynn,
who I'm working with.

92
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:54,341
- Hello, Abbie.
- That's Martha.

93
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:56,143
Hi, Lynn. I'm Martha.

94
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:57,377
So why'd you marry him anyway?

95
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,445
Because he was there.

96
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:01,347
You get married because
you think you need

97
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,082
another person to
validate your existence.

98
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:07,253
Oh, my gosh.
You don't really mean that.

99
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,121
Well.

100
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,356
Trouble again?

101
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,124
Just the usual.

102
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:13,325
Some days,
I just want to stay in bed

103
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,261
with the covers over my head.

104
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:17,996
That's why God invented shopping.

105
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:19,364
Which reminds me,

106
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:22,200
I've got to buy something fabulous
to wear tonight,

107
00:07:22,202 --> 00:07:23,368
so I'm gonna go now.

108
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,436
- What?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:26,004
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:27,338
Okay.
Well, everybody

111
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,339
is going to start arriving around 9:30.

112
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,874
I'll be there.

113
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:32,409
Nine years.
Who would believe it?

114
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,445
None of mine lasted
more than four.

115
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,113
Bye-bye!

116
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:39,016
They must have had
an expiration date.

117
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:46,457
Is she always so, uh...

118
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,324
What's the word
I'm looking for?

119
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:49,392
Yes.

120
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:51,227
Well, at least she's human.

121
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,096
I'm convinced my mother-in-law

122
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,331
is an early experiment
in recombinant DNA.

123
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,866
No!

124
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,201
I have yet to discover
the singular charm

125
00:07:58,203 --> 00:07:59,735
of the mother-in-law.

126
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:13,014
Oh, my God, no!

127
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:14,149
Give me a break!

128
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:15,283
Come on!

129
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:25,259
Ohh!

130
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:30,998
I really should get going.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,233
Why? I thought we were
gonna go to lunch?

132
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:34,802
Oh, I'm sorry,
something came up.

133
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:36,269
Oh, the kids, yeah.

134
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:37,337
No, an old friend.

135
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,873
Oh. Well, she can join us.

136
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,076
Well, no, I promised
to meet her in the city.

137
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:44,955
- Okay.
- Okay.

138
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,581
I'll see you at the party.

139
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,216
Nice meeting you.

140
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:52,484
Bye.

141
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:54,520
So I finished the new draft.

142
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:56,088
Well, are you going to tell me,

143
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,024
or do you enjoy
watching me sweat?

144
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:00,626
I think we're ready
to go to galleys.

145
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:01,960
Really?

146
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:04,429
No, I don't think so, not yet.

147
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:05,664
Oh.

148
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,501
It's a great story, Lynn.

149
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,403
Isn't that your friend?

150
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:17,441
That is weird.

151
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:18,543
What?

152
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:19,977
That's just not the way
to the city.

153
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:22,680
Maybe she's gone home
to change...

154
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:25,415
Into a werewolf.

155
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,516
The undead?

156
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,219
I mean, have you no curiosity?

157
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:38,428
This is so Charlie's angels.

158
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,329
Oh, Martha hates the city.

159
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:44,567
Maybe she heads
for a dim, smoky bar,

160
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:47,536
dons sunglasses
and a gypsy bandana.

161
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:49,205
She signals to a man

162
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:51,140
with darkly arab features
and scuffed shoes,

163
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:52,675
and he takes her
to a room in the back

164
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:53,976
where men and boys are doing

165
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:56,111
unmentionable things
to each other,

166
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:59,314
clouded by opium
and broken dreams.

167
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:06,788
Aw.

168
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,657
Well, so much for that theory.

169
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:10,925
What?

170
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:13,527
That is one of his and
James' projects.

171
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,429
She must be meeting Pieter.

172
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:17,497
Her husband.

173
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:19,132
How dull.

174
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:49,261
Wow.

175
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:04,675
What is it?

176
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:09,280
Nina, where are you going?

177
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,851
Are you going to tell me?

178
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,519
Son of a bitch,

179
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:29,621
I gave him that bike
on his last his birthday.

180
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,622
Who?

181
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,425
My husband. Get in.

182
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:36,128
Jesus.

183
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,568
Are you okay?

184
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,969
Uh-huh.

185
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:46,738
You're scaring me.

186
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,439
You should be, you know,

187
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:49,907
yelling, crying,
throwing something.

188
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,243
No, yelling was the first time.

189
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,977
Second time, was crying,

190
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:57,748
and I think throwing things was
around number four.

191
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,450
You just have to deal
with it, you know.

192
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:01,852
You're not going to be

193
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:04,588
some pre-liberation
model wife, circa 1954,

194
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,824
you know, throwing a tizzy
just because ward

195
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:10,826
is screwing around with one
of June's closest friends,

196
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:12,661
not to mention the wife of
one of his closest friends.

197
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:14,530
But that's just not the way
I deal with things.

198
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:17,199
You know, I'm about putting
things into perspective

199
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:19,635
and intellectualizing,
rationalizing.

200
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,470
I mean, I know how to deal
with these trivialities.

201
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:23,939
Nina, I think that maybe you
should let me drive or pull over.

202
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:25,207
I don't know who I am,

203
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:26,374
because this sure as hell
isn't the person

204
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:28,176
that I started out to be.

205
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:29,922
I'm just going to deal with it.

206
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:31,780
I'm going to go on
with my fucking day,

207
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:33,047
and I'm going to have
my fucking party,

208
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,716
and I'm going to deal with things

209
00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:35,950
In my own fucking
repressed way until...

210
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:37,385
Nina!

211
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,753
<i>- Goedemorgen.
- Hey.</i>

212
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,255
Finally.
Any word from Wendell?

213
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,723
Why would he call me?

214
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:19,791
Relax.
It's a long flight.

215
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,293
He probably wants to settle in.

216
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:22,494
This is the copy for Terry.

217
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,196
Yeah, right.
Once it's out there,

218
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,630
it's not like we can turn around

219
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,299
and sell it to the Japanese, you know.

220
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:28,567
That's a good idea,

221
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:30,434
turn around and sell it
to the Japanese.

222
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,435
I like that.

223
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,604
Let me know if he calls!

224
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,672
I will!

225
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,957
<i>Gulliver's travels,
goedemorgen.</i>

226
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,325
Hi, Victoria.
This is James Ferguson.

227
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,726
I'd like to make a reservation.

228
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,962
Hi, James.
When would you like to fly?

229
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,563
Um...

230
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:04,333
How about the, uh, 24th?

231
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:06,301
I'll be traveling
with Mrs. Ferguson.

232
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:08,403
Let me pull up your file.

233
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:09,972
Any particular destination,

234
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:12,174
or do you want me
just to pick one?

235
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:13,175
I'm sorry?

236
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:14,476
Any particular destination,

237
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:17,379
or do you want me
just to pick one?

238
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:19,413
Uh...

239
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:20,848
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,450
I should have thought of that
before I called you.

241
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:24,385
Uhh...

242
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:26,921
Madrid is beautiful
this time of year.

243
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:29,524
Really?

244
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:31,025
- Yeah.
- Sounds great.

245
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:32,326
Are you serious?

246
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:33,761
- Yeah, book it.
- Okay.

247
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:35,095
- Thanks, Victoria.
- Bye.

248
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:36,162
Bye.

249
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:53,646
# Betty came by on her way #

250
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:59,418
# Said she had a word to say #

251
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,390
# 'bout things today

252
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:07,559
# And fallen leaves

253
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:15,199
# Said she hadn't
heard the news #

254
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:19,938
# Hadn't had the
time to choose #

255
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,875
# A way to lose

256
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:27,945
# But she believes

257
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:35,953
# Gonna see the river man

258
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:41,490
# Gonna tell him
all I can #

259
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:45,995
# 'bout the plan

260
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:51,867
# For lilac time

261
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:57,906
# If he tells me
all he knows #

262
00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:00,642
# 'bout the way his river flows #

263
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,849
# And all-night shows

264
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:10,285
No, don't let's
just stay this way.

265
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:11,452
They'll be lining up,
sweetheart

266
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:13,554
no, let them.

267
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:16,090
I just want one kiss.

268
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:20,094
Always.

269
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:50,956
...So I realized I couldn't
make a bit of noise

270
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,724
or the gestapo would hear.

271
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:54,559
But with a knife, you know,

272
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:58,130
you have to hit a major artery
to make it quick,

273
00:17:58,132 --> 00:17:59,630
which isn't always so easy.

274
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:02,500
Oh, how awful.

275
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,835
I have to say good-bye to someone.

276
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:09,740
Thanks for coming.

277
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:12,243
Oh, it was so good seeing you.

278
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:18,314
- Nina.
- Hi.

279
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,085
Wow!

280
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:25,088
Yeah, Pieter's latest
trinket of appeasement,

281
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,190
and I didn't even
have to threaten

282
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,292
to cut my wrists this time.

283
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:31,594
Mart!

284
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:37,199
I thought we were
coming over together.

285
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,701
It just made more sense

286
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,669
to come straight from the office.

287
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:42,204
Last minute preparations
for the Aussie.

288
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,606
Good you could make it at all.

289
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,710
I, uh...
I need to freshen up.

290
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:48,609
Oh.

291
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:51,646
Your elevator's out again.

292
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:53,481
What's that they say?

293
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:55,216
Life's a bitch,
and then you marry one.

294
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,467
Oh, Jesus.
Next time I fly,

295
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:15,368
they're going to ask me
to check these bags.

296
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:23,008
Men always think
it's funny, you know,

297
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,846
how women come to the
bathroom in pairs, but...

298
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:30,182
I guess it's just a bonding thing.

299
00:19:32,686 --> 00:19:34,920
Men like to compete.

300
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:44,929
Exactly.

301
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:52,103
Hey.

302
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:56,940
I'm really glad that you're here.

303
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:59,943
Did you think I wouldn't come?

304
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:02,312
No.

305
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:05,215
It's just good to be
surrounded by friends.

306
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:07,050
Yeah.

307
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:12,255
# The joy that you'll find here #

308
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:15,158
# You've borrowed

309
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,162
# You cannot keep it long,
it seems #

310
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:23,766
Hi, James.
How are you?

311
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:25,133
Let me introduce you to a friend.

312
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:26,134
Sorry, what's your name?

313
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:27,335
Hi, Mirije.

314
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:29,104
Mirije, James.
Nice to meet you.

315
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:30,272
Nice to meet you, too.

316
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:31,339
- Enjoying the party?
- Very much.

317
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:32,507
- Good.
- See you later.

318
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:33,508
See you.

319
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,876
Hello. By the way,

320
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:36,178
can you tell me,
who's that woman?

321
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,446
It's my mom, Hendrik.

322
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:39,915
Your mom?

323
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,515
Abbie.

324
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:43,250
Thank you.

325
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:50,224
May I have this dance?

326
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:52,426
# The joy that you'll find here #

327
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:55,696
# You've borrowed

328
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:58,531
# You cannot keep it long,
it seems #

329
00:20:58,533 --> 00:20:59,933
I'd like to tell

330
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:01,868
a nice story about the gestapo.

331
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,269
# And gigolo and gigolette #

332
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:06,039
# Still sing a song
and dance along #

333
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:10,324
# The boulevard of...

334
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:17,256
# broken dreams

335
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:21,053
I'm not falling yet.

336
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,721
Don't save me before.

337
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:24,923
Parents are just too
willing to believe

338
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:26,124
that every little thing they do

339
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:28,160
has great significance.

340
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,928
You know, like the guy
who's a serial...

341
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,031
Oh! Serial killer.

342
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:36,300
Don't you hate it
when that happens?

343
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:38,069
Just because he didn't get

344
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:41,038
that toy he wanted
for Christmas.

345
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,006
Well...

346
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:43,207
What?
Is she making a speech?

347
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:46,009
I think so, yes.

348
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:47,310
Well, no, it's getting late,

349
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:48,745
and I better say this now

350
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:49,946
while I still have the strength.

351
00:21:49,948 --> 00:21:51,348
I'll just sit down.

352
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,782
I think that friendships

353
00:21:52,784 --> 00:21:54,084
are the touchstones of our lives.

354
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:55,719
They define who we are,

355
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:59,322
along with, of course,
those whom we've loved.

356
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:01,223
Love and friendship,

357
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:04,026
and how nice when you
can combine them,

358
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:05,427
right, James?

359
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:08,831
Well, of course,
we have had our little,

360
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:12,434
what would you say,
storms from time to time.

361
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:15,537
Oh, but what marriage hasn't?

362
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,872
I've always thought
the key to our success

363
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:20,508
has been the space that
we give each other.

364
00:22:22,978 --> 00:22:28,416
Actually, the space
that I give to James.

365
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:32,120
Um...

366
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:35,989
Me, I've always found
the space in this apartment

367
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:37,324
more than adequate,

368
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:42,062
but, um, James,
on the other hand...

369
00:22:43,398 --> 00:22:46,133
James likes his freedom.

370
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:48,135
And without it, to be honest,

371
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:50,136
this marriage wouldn't
have made it this far.

372
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:52,004
So, um...

373
00:22:53,194 --> 00:22:58,010
This will be our last
anniversary party.

374
00:22:58,012 --> 00:23:00,980
I just have one final request,
and that is...

375
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:04,150
A final toast to us.

376
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,451
Nina, why don't
we go upstairs?

377
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:09,154
No, James, I think
you owe me this much.

378
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:12,390
There's no anger in my heart,
not anymore.

379
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,260
After all, you can't
blame the scorpion

380
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:16,528
for stinging you, can you?

381
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,602
To all the women from
New York to Amsterdam

382
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,038
who have selflessly
lent their bodies

383
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,574
to the maintenance
of this marriage.

384
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,334
It didn't mean anything, Nina.

385
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:01,036
You know that.

386
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:03,372
Well, maybe they didn't
mean anything to you,

387
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,273
but they meant something to me.

388
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,256
I'm sorry.

389
00:24:57,258 --> 00:24:58,289
That was easy.

390
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:04,295
Would you stop
for a second? Stop.

391
00:25:06,365 --> 00:25:07,899
I'd jump off the balcony,

392
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:09,400
but you know heights and me.

393
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:11,069
Get out of my way.

394
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:15,338
Get out of your way?

395
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,944
I'm not in your way, Nina.

396
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:22,446
I... I, you know...

397
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:24,247
On the contrary,
I just want to help.

398
00:25:25,384 --> 00:25:27,884
Lets see, what are
you going to need, huh?

399
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:30,020
Food! Food, right?

400
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:31,921
You can't go on a long trip
without anything to eat, huh?

401
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:35,157
You never know, huh?

402
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,293
A party!
What do you think, babe?

403
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:39,295
Margaritas, huh?

404
00:25:39,297 --> 00:25:42,398
We all know how much
Nina loves a party.

405
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,566
That stuff in there.

406
00:25:43,568 --> 00:25:45,267
Check the bathroom, sweetheart?

407
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:46,468
Let me see.
Oh, right!

408
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,336
Don't want you getting a hangover.

409
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,938
No. Here we go.

410
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,273
A little aspirin in there.

411
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,977
Sorry, babe.

412
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:58,113
I couldn't find your toothbrush,
but I did find...

413
00:25:58,115 --> 00:26:00,215
This, look at that, just sitting
there on the sink.

414
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:03,117
Never know,
it might come in handy.

415
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:14,128
You feel better now?

416
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:17,865
No.

417
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,695
No.

418
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:53,864
No, that would be too easy.

419
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,101
No.

420
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:59,670
I'll forget who I am
and what I need to do.

421
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:08,611
He stays.

422
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:10,747
He goes with me.

423
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:11,781
Stays.

424
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:13,049
You hate walking him.

425
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:14,417
Yeah, but I do it, don't I?

426
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,488
Come here, Lar.
Good boy.

427
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:28,564
Where are you going to stay?

428
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:29,765
With a friend.

429
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,367
Friend?
Is that a euphemism?

430
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:37,039
I have no use for
euphemisms, James.

431
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,207
I never had.

432
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,713
I love you,

433
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:47,715
and it's never been about that.

434
00:27:58,626 --> 00:27:59,559
Well, it's one big space,

435
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:02,596
but you have a choice...
couch or tub.

436
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,698
I can stay in a hotel.

437
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,633
Oh, it'll be fun,

438
00:28:06,635 --> 00:28:09,135
like campfire girls.

439
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:15,774
That only happens
about 80 times a day.

440
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:17,810
I hate to put you out.

441
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:18,844
Are you kidding?

442
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,246
How many first-time authors

443
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:21,513
get to bunk with their editor?

444
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:23,616
More than you think.

445
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,018
Besides, it'll give us a chance
to work on the book.

446
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:28,786
Damn.

447
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:30,121
What?

448
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:32,257
I left my laptop
back at the apartment.

449
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:35,226
You have to go back sometime.

450
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:37,629
I'll just go when he's not around.

451
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:42,367
Ohh!

452
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:44,234
Hey, there's still a world out there

453
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:46,203
for a couple of single gals.

454
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:48,105
Remember casual sex?

455
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:50,173
Remember romance?

456
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,342
Remember the possibility
of being surprised?

457
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:54,978
- Campfire girl?
- Hmm?

458
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,448
You expect me to believe that
you were a campfire girl?

459
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,649
What?

460
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:01,517
A girl can dream.

461
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,852
Shut up.

462
00:29:05,722 --> 00:29:07,623
I'm so depressed.

463
00:29:14,498 --> 00:29:19,234
# Some little thing
within me #

464
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:21,736
# Protects me for a while

465
00:29:22,872 --> 00:29:26,941
# Till someone comes to win me #

466
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:30,912
# With only a smile

467
00:29:30,914 --> 00:29:36,116
# Falling in love again

468
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:40,154
# Never wanted to

469
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:44,158
# What am I to do?

470
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,960
# Can't help it

471
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:53,199
# Love's always been
my game #

472
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:57,236
# Play it how I may

473
00:29:57,238 --> 00:30:00,907
# I was made that way

474
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:05,977
# Can't help it

475
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:16,555
It was amazing.

476
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:19,257
You were fantastic, thank you.

477
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:39,709
Urinals.

478
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:40,977
Oh, God!

479
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:42,512
Come on.

480
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,650
There's a whole
'nother world out there.

481
00:30:47,652 --> 00:30:49,819
Yeah, it's like a whole
other galaxy.

482
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:51,621
Whoa!

483
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:55,791
We're thinkin' Tequila.

484
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:57,092
It's just one of those nights.

485
00:30:57,094 --> 00:30:58,127
Lemon and salt?

486
00:30:58,129 --> 00:30:59,561
Straight up.

487
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:25,886
See you guys later?

488
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:34,461
I think you fucked my mom?

489
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:38,465
Laura Winter?

490
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,400
Maggie's daughter?

491
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:44,503
Maggie Winter.

492
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:45,838
Oh.

493
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,607
Cool out. It's water
under the bridge.

494
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:52,044
Wow.

495
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:55,681
So what are you doing
here in Amsterdam?

496
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:57,816
Oh, I'm on my summer vacation,

497
00:31:57,818 --> 00:32:00,652
and I thought I'd come and see
how the hippies lived.

498
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:03,154
Well, you picked the right place.

499
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:05,590
How are your, uh...

500
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,193
Parents? Is that the word
you're looking for?

501
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:09,594
Yeah.

502
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,930
They're divorced.

503
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,866
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

504
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:18,435
No, don't worry.
It wasn't you.

505
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,537
Turns out he was
screwing the help...

506
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,006
my nanny.
Would you believe it?

507
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:39,822
Whoa! Whoa!

508
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,291
If it ain't the lone fuckin' ranger.

509
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,727
You better come up with
one hell of a line, son,

510
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,561
'cause these two cowgirls
have heard them all.

511
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:47,996
Actually, I wanted to ask

512
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:50,866
if we might buy you
two ladies a drink.

513
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:51,900
Hmm...

514
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:53,635
I don't think that cuts it,

515
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:58,240
but let me ask my associate.

516
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:01,842
Sorry, partner,

517
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:04,078
but you and Tonto
have a nice night.

518
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:11,652
Wooster.
I graduate this year.

519
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:13,521
College?

520
00:33:13,523 --> 00:33:14,855
High school.

521
00:33:19,894 --> 00:33:21,461
I'm fucking with you.

522
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:23,363
Of course, college.

523
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:25,198
Do the math.

524
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,699
Makes me legal.

525
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:28,101
Oh.

526
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,475
How about a second chance?

527
00:33:36,477 --> 00:33:38,343
Why not?
I'm feeling generous.

528
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:40,913
Okay, I heard this
in a movie once:

529
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:42,948
"You come here very often?"

530
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,384
Well, I'll give you this.
You got a sense of humor.

531
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:50,087
I'm Lynn, this is Nina.

532
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,856
Well, I hope we're
not bothering you.

533
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:53,891
Mister, you don't know me
well enough to bother me.

534
00:33:53,893 --> 00:33:55,226
But the night is young.

535
00:33:55,228 --> 00:33:57,295
That's the kind of talk I like.

536
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:58,963
You don't say much, do you?

537
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:01,232
Uh...

538
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:03,301
- I like your hat.
- You think so?

539
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:04,569
Well, you're the first
woman in my life

540
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:05,702
who loves my hat.

541
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:07,370
I like the village people.

542
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:10,740
You know, men who wear
their hats indoors

543
00:34:10,742 --> 00:34:12,275
- are always bald.
- Bald.

544
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:14,611
I love to surprise people.

545
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:17,280
Kind of made a career
of that myself.

546
00:34:17,282 --> 00:34:18,281
Here, take it.

547
00:34:18,283 --> 00:34:19,749
- No.
- Keep it!

548
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:21,451
Yeah, it suits you.
Keep it

549
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:24,019
want to dance?

550
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,556
What the hell.

551
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:36,365
Well, we better get going.

552
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:37,932
Past his bedtime.

553
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:40,268
Yeah, I should try
and find my friends.

554
00:34:41,738 --> 00:34:43,037
It was nice running into you.

555
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,406
Actually, I ran into you,

556
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:47,075
but I'll let it slide.

557
00:34:47,077 --> 00:34:48,443
Okay.

558
00:34:48,445 --> 00:34:50,011
Shall I say hi to my mom for you?

559
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:54,848
Yeah! Tell her I think
she did a fine job.

560
00:34:57,118 --> 00:34:58,452
Are you still married?

561
00:34:58,454 --> 00:34:59,686
Hmm?

562
00:34:59,688 --> 00:35:01,688
Are you still married?

563
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,090
Yeah.

564
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:04,591
Sort of.

565
00:35:04,593 --> 00:35:05,792
Yeah, I met a guy
in prison once.

566
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:08,195
He, uh, "sort of"
killed somebody.

567
00:35:10,264 --> 00:35:12,264
We're separated.

568
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,133
Oh, cool.

569
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:17,003
This is where I'm staying,

570
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:20,306
if you want to get
together, you know...

571
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:22,108
"Sort of" call me?

572
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,009
Hmm?

573
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:25,344
- Okay.
- Hmm?

574
00:35:25,346 --> 00:35:26,344
See ya.

575
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:39,691
She is really something,
your friend.

576
00:35:39,693 --> 00:35:41,893
Yeah, she is.

577
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:44,461
Hey, cowboy, I gotta
tell you something.

578
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:47,464
Joop: So what is
the book about?

579
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:49,166
It's about her life.

580
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:51,802
She's pretty young for a biography,
isn't she?

581
00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:53,937
Uh, not really.

582
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:57,074
- Fuck off to America!
- Lynn!

583
00:35:57,076 --> 00:35:58,175
Rotten whore!

584
00:35:58,177 --> 00:35:59,709
Hey, I was being honest with you.

585
00:35:59,711 --> 00:36:01,978
Fuck off to America!

586
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,479
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

587
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:04,847
I can deal with this.

588
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:07,050
No, I don't want to watch
you deal with this.

589
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:09,419
They are queers!

590
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:11,727
Homos!

591
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,056
Cocksuckers!

592
00:36:13,058 --> 00:36:15,357
Hey!

593
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:54,728
Men... they are always
looking for perfection.

594
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,064
Uch, and what's
perfection, right?

595
00:36:58,066 --> 00:36:59,666
I don't know.

596
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:02,001
I guess I just thought
he could handle it.

597
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:04,203
What is it with guys anyway?

598
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:05,904
They are so insecure.

599
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:07,039
Moroccan red?

600
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,373
Oh, let me.

601
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:10,709
No, no, no, I got it.
It's on me.

602
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:12,978
Oh, my God. I have not
done this since college.

603
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,613
One hit.

604
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:23,321
Isn't it our past what
makes us most interesting?

605
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:30,928
You are one hell of an editor,
you know that?

606
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:39,236
As only a first-time author
could know.

607
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:41,438
No, I'm serious.

608
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,273
I am, too.

609
00:37:43,275 --> 00:37:45,876
What the hell are you
doing here anyway?

610
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:49,079
What? What do you...
what, uh, hmm?

611
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:51,080
I mean...

612
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:54,016
For me, Amsterdam was a haven.

613
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:55,718
Mm-hmm.

614
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,419
Let's just say that thomasville,
Georgia, isn't exactly

615
00:37:57,421 --> 00:38:01,557
- the open-mindedness
capital of the South. - Hey!

616
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,092
Are you okay?

617
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:04,960
The world just turned sideways.

618
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:06,428
What?

619
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,329
Why are you here?

620
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:09,998
Gosh, uh...

621
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,267
I mean, we were
in New York, and...

622
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:13,935
It was near perfect,

623
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:18,907
and then he got offered a position
in Pieter's firm, and...

624
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:21,976
You gave up your dream
to follow your man.

625
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:24,611
I know.

626
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:25,612
Oi.

627
00:38:25,614 --> 00:38:27,080
Ay yi yi.

628
00:38:27,082 --> 00:38:29,249
I'm living a cliche.
Oh, my God, no.

629
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,952
No, it was not that.
We needed a fresh start,

630
00:38:31,954 --> 00:38:34,221
and we were...
We were going to have babies,

631
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:37,257
and it was
just going to be idyllic,

632
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:38,992
and it just turned out...

633
00:38:38,994 --> 00:38:40,193
Ugh, I'm sorry.

634
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,829
My problems just seem
so ordinary.

635
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:45,865
Hey, those can
be the hardest sometimes.

636
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,935
I have known what
I wanted since I was 6.

637
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:01,513
Yeah, turn the pharaohs
on their heads.

638
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:04,950
Flip Egypt upside down.
I like that.

639
00:39:04,952 --> 00:39:08,253
Ah, bloody terrible flight, too.

640
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:10,956
Got a redback spider
in my luggage.

641
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,256
Don't want to get bit
by one of those.

642
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:13,557
They'll kill you straight away.

643
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,259
Well, that's really quite
an amazing story.

644
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:17,428
You heard of the redback, James?

645
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,098
No, no, I don't.

646
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,802
Redback spider... one of 14 deadly
species we have in Australia,

647
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,237
home to more deadly species
than any other continent.

648
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,737
Did you know that?

649
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:29,472
Yeah, I think I saw
that on discovery.

650
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:31,007
Not only spiders,
snakes as well.

651
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:32,742
Got one little beauty
called the death adder.

652
00:39:32,744 --> 00:39:34,744
Lives under the sand.

653
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,079
Take one step
in the wrong place,

654
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:37,347
dead in two seconds.

655
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:40,183
Getting back to the structure,
um, we thought...

656
00:39:40,185 --> 00:39:41,517
I like it.

657
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,419
I'm looking for something
bold, exciting,

658
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:45,220
capture the imagination.

659
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:48,490
Yeah, Melbourne, it's boring.

660
00:39:48,492 --> 00:39:50,225
It's like having sex
with your wife.

661
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:53,462
Well, not yours.

662
00:39:53,464 --> 00:39:55,364
"The wife," "our wives. "

663
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:56,865
We, um, appreciate

664
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:59,101
that you like the concept, and...

665
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:02,503
Yeah, the inverted pyramid, I do.

666
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:08,009
Do you have a cup of sugar?

667
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:09,143
Sugar?

668
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:12,914
You know, it's white,
powder, kind of sweet?

669
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:15,916
Yeah, yeah,
I'll get you some.

670
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:18,251
I'm sorry to hear about Nina.

671
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:24,357
Jesus, the whole building
know already?

672
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:25,258
There you go.

673
00:40:26,295 --> 00:40:28,061
I only need a cup.

674
00:40:28,063 --> 00:40:29,229
Oh, it's all right.

675
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:32,097
I'm, uh, taking my coffee
black these days.

676
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,502
I heard you walk by my door.

677
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:37,603
Yeah.

678
00:40:38,972 --> 00:40:42,141
So how do you feel about
chocolate chip cookies?

679
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:45,377
How do I feel about
chocolate chip cookies?

680
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:48,379
Uh, I...
I think they're great.

681
00:40:48,381 --> 00:40:51,215
Maybe you come by later
for a taste.

682
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:21,444
Hello?

683
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,379
Mr. Ferguson?
This is Victoria.

684
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,148
Hi, Victoria.
Thanks for getting back to me.

685
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,283
How can I help you?

686
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:31,287
Uh, I need to cancel
those reservations I made.

687
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,621
Hmm, is everything okay?

688
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,458
Yeah, just that, uh,
Mrs. Ferguson

689
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,292
isn't gonna be able to make it.

690
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,294
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

691
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:43,431
Well, it's just one of those situations
that can't be helped.

692
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:48,370
You know, Victoria,
there's a lot about me

693
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:51,373
you might find surprising.

694
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:55,542
I guess that depends on
who's doing the surprising.

695
00:41:57,346 --> 00:41:59,380
Yes, yes, it is.

696
00:41:59,382 --> 00:42:01,348
Would you like me to change it
to another date?

697
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,450
No, I don't think
Mrs. Ferguson and I

698
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:05,452
are gonna be going anywhere
in the near future.

699
00:42:05,454 --> 00:42:07,721
Oh, seems such
a waste to cancel.

700
00:42:07,723 --> 00:42:09,389
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

701
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:11,157
Well, I'd love to go.

702
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,328
Oh, you want to go
with me instead?

703
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,363
Actually, I just went last year.

704
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:20,633
Pick somewhere else.

705
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:22,268
I love Rome.

706
00:42:24,204 --> 00:42:26,138
Thanks, Victoria.

707
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,243
I don't know, just for being
a friendly voice.

708
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:35,213
You know, we ought to
get together

709
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:37,215
and actually meet in person
one of these days.

710
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:42,253
Oh, Larry!

711
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:43,154
Oh, boy.

712
00:42:43,156 --> 00:42:45,523
Thank you. Bye.

713
00:42:49,728 --> 00:42:51,495
No, Larry, please stay.

714
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:52,797
Stay, stay.

715
00:42:54,734 --> 00:42:57,667
Hey, what are you
yelling about?

716
00:42:57,669 --> 00:42:59,302
Come here.

717
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:05,642
What's going on, huh?

718
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:07,877
What's bugging you?

719
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:11,714
Yeah, I miss her, too.

720
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:13,849
I know.

721
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:19,288
She was just a voice
on the phone, my God.

722
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,255
Don't you get it?

723
00:43:20,257 --> 00:43:21,557
That's what makes it exciting.

724
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:24,693
He can project his best
fantasy onto a voice

725
00:43:24,695 --> 00:43:26,662
and never be disappointed.

726
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:29,430
And he can be himself.

727
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:31,165
God, what happened?

728
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:32,266
You want to know
the biggest trick

729
00:43:32,268 --> 00:43:34,635
feminism ever played
on women?

730
00:43:34,637 --> 00:43:38,773
Making them think they were
as detached from sex as men.

731
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:41,142
But you want to attach a face,

732
00:43:41,144 --> 00:43:43,311
a pair of hands, a personality.

733
00:43:43,313 --> 00:43:46,513
To a man, all that specificity just
diminishes the experience.

734
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:50,817
Why do you think you play
those silly games with him,

735
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:53,386
picking each other up at bars?

736
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:56,723
You're trying to trick yourselves

737
00:43:56,725 --> 00:43:58,692
into seeing the familiar
as the new.

738
00:44:01,262 --> 00:44:04,497
I wish I had a window
into his head.

739
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:31,489
Hello?

740
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:34,858
<i>Met janneke Van De Kamp.
Is Laurence thuis?</i>

741
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,527
You got the wrong number.

742
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:37,794
But...

743
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:49,239
Hello?

744
00:44:49,241 --> 00:44:51,607
Oh, sorry to bother you again.

745
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:55,411
Is this 912-6673?

746
00:44:55,413 --> 00:44:57,346
Yeah, you got
the right number,

747
00:44:57,348 --> 00:45:00,349
but the only Laurence here
is my dog, Larry.

748
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:02,785
- That fucker.
- Actually, he's neutered.

749
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:03,819
Neutral?

750
00:45:03,821 --> 00:45:05,887
No, neutered.

751
00:45:05,889 --> 00:45:07,189
- That, uh...
- Oh.

752
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:08,857
Means when they cut off the...

753
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:10,725
it's not important.

754
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:14,663
<i>No. Well, um, this guy I met
at the melkweg the other night</i>

755
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:15,697
gave me this number.

756
00:45:15,699 --> 00:45:16,698
Oh.

757
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,766
You have a nice voice.

758
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:19,935
No, I didn't...

759
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:21,336
no, no, that's okay.
Thank you.

760
00:45:21,338 --> 00:45:22,770
- No.
- Very nice of you.

761
00:45:22,772 --> 00:45:24,872
Yes, again, uh, I'm sorry.

762
00:45:24,874 --> 00:45:27,040
- Okay.
- Bye.

763
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:28,972
Bye.

764
00:45:33,415 --> 00:45:36,450
Hello, Dutch girl.

765
00:45:36,452 --> 00:45:39,519
Well, you have
a dog named Larry?

766
00:45:39,521 --> 00:45:42,589
Yeah, my wife named him.

767
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:44,023
Oh.

768
00:45:44,025 --> 00:45:46,726
Uh, actually, we're separated.

769
00:45:46,728 --> 00:45:48,228
Oh, sorry to hear that.

770
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,963
She named him after csonka.

771
00:45:49,965 --> 00:45:51,331
What is csonka?

772
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:52,832
Oh, he's a football player,

773
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,967
a very famous
American running back.

774
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:55,968
You know American football?

775
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,636
Yeah, all right,
you use your hands.

776
00:45:57,638 --> 00:45:59,738
No, that's right.
You use your hands.

777
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,274
Um...

778
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:04,743
So, do you have a name?

779
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:05,811
Mmm, janneke.

780
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:08,480
Janneke. It's nice
to meet you, janneke.

781
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:09,514
I'm James.

782
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,549
Sorry about Larry, your Larry.

783
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:13,985
I mean, Lau...
Laurence.

784
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:15,286
- Laurence?
- No.

785
00:46:15,288 --> 00:46:17,521
Laurence.
Uh, well, James,

786
00:46:17,523 --> 00:46:20,324
it probably wouldn't have
worked out anyway.

787
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:22,560
He never took his hat off
the whole evening.

788
00:46:22,562 --> 00:46:23,461
His hat?

789
00:46:23,463 --> 00:46:25,997
Oh, bald guy, huh?

790
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:28,431
Yeah, like it's such a big thing.

791
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:30,900
Why do men think
that's all we care about,

792
00:46:30,902 --> 00:46:32,369
you know, the physical?

793
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:34,571
Well, maybe 'cause
it's so important to us.

794
00:46:34,573 --> 00:46:35,739
Oh...

795
00:46:35,741 --> 00:46:37,307
You couldn't love a bald woman?

796
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:39,876
Uh, actually, no.

797
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:43,712
Well, at last, an honest man.

798
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:46,348
Look, janneke, I got to run.

799
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,017
It was nice talking
to you, though, huh?

800
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:49,084
You, too.

801
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:50,853
Okay, bye.

802
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:53,255
<i>Tot ziens.</i>

803
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:55,658
Where'd you get
that big cheeseball?

804
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:57,593
Go!

805
00:47:01,164 --> 00:47:02,430
Yeah!

806
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:08,770
Hi.

807
00:47:10,005 --> 00:47:11,005
Hello.

808
00:47:11,007 --> 00:47:13,241
- Hi.
- Hi.

809
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:15,375
- Hello.
- Hi.

810
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:18,211
Hi.
Where's Larry?

811
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:19,579
In there making my bed.

812
00:47:19,581 --> 00:47:20,647
Yes!

813
00:47:20,649 --> 00:47:21,815
Go play.

814
00:47:21,817 --> 00:47:24,217
We were, uh, just
in the neighborhood.

815
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:26,853
You're a lousy liar, Pieter.

816
00:47:26,855 --> 00:47:28,889
He insisted on stopping by
to see how you were doing.

817
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:31,257
Of course, I knew
you were just fine.

818
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:32,858
Of course, I'm fine.

819
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,094
I was just going to have a
little bit of Ctes du Rhne.

820
00:47:35,096 --> 00:47:36,929
You want to join me?

821
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:37,930
Pieter?

822
00:47:37,932 --> 00:47:39,098
- Huh? No, no.
- No?

823
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,333
Yeah, sure.

824
00:47:40,335 --> 00:47:41,534
You look like hell, by the way.

825
00:47:41,536 --> 00:47:42,735
Oh, thank you.

826
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:45,471
That would be the,
uh, glow of freedom.

827
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:49,741
You, on the other hand,
look absolutely stunning.

828
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:54,846
How about a nice stroll
in the vondelpark?

829
00:47:54,848 --> 00:47:56,014
Vondelpark?

830
00:47:56,016 --> 00:47:57,148
Yeah, vondelpark.

831
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,417
Sunlight, tourists, sounds good.

832
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:01,019
Yeah, okay?

833
00:48:01,021 --> 00:48:02,387
Good. Yeah, fine.

834
00:48:02,389 --> 00:48:03,587
Go get the kids, will you?

835
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,089
Uh, yeah, yeah.

836
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,058
It's a little stifling
in this apartment.

837
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,829
Yeah, might
be the coat, Martha.

838
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:27,076
James, come on.

839
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:36,051
What's that smell?

840
00:48:38,054 --> 00:48:40,188
Uh, cheeseballs.

841
00:48:44,627 --> 00:48:47,429
I just couldn't get away
from him today.

842
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:48,764
Get away?

843
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:51,166
Yeah, Nina is gone,
so I thought, we...

844
00:48:51,168 --> 00:48:53,434
Want to go?

845
00:48:53,436 --> 00:48:55,503
Yeah! Let's go.

846
00:48:56,973 --> 00:48:58,506
Martha, you ready?

847
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:02,143
Think you can get
rid of the bottle?

848
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,781
It's legal to drink
in public, Pieter.

849
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:09,315
It's one of the reasons
I moved to Amsterdam.

850
00:49:09,317 --> 00:49:12,919
I know, but we might run
into a client, come on.

851
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:16,689
You know, I never quite trust
a guy who hasn't spent

852
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:18,491
at least a night in jail.

853
00:49:18,493 --> 00:49:20,427
How do you know I haven't?

854
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:22,028
He knows, Pieter.

855
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,562
Yeah? Think you know me so well?

856
00:49:23,564 --> 00:49:24,997
Well, that's the problem. I do.

857
00:49:24,999 --> 00:49:26,765
I've had my wild days.

858
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:29,234
What did you do, pee in public?

859
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:36,375
Little warm for the leather,
isn't it?

860
00:49:36,377 --> 00:49:37,709
Come on, James.

861
00:49:37,711 --> 00:49:39,478
You know quite well
it's a symbol of love.

862
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,511
All right.

863
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:41,612
Right, Pieter?

864
00:49:41,614 --> 00:49:43,114
Why are you defending him?

865
00:49:43,116 --> 00:49:44,749
I'm not defending him.
I, you know...

866
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:46,484
Thought you might be
a little warm, that's all.

867
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:48,519
You have an erratic
sense of loyalty.

868
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:49,554
I'll say.

869
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:52,623
Why didn't you call me?

870
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:56,259
Wasn't a good time.

871
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:58,261
I'm leaving him.

872
00:49:58,263 --> 00:50:01,064
Course, he doesn't know it yet,
but that's Pieter.

873
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:02,532
Right there?

874
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:04,601
It just... it doesn't work
for me anymore.

875
00:50:04,603 --> 00:50:06,269
It will be rough on the kids,

876
00:50:06,271 --> 00:50:07,537
but now that you're free,
I thought...

877
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:09,873
No, no, Martha.

878
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:12,842
I'm... I'm feeling a lot
of things right now,

879
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:15,911
but freedom is very
low on the list.

880
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:31,025
Nina?

881
00:50:32,261 --> 00:50:33,995
Nina?

882
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,168
I couldn't bring myself
to sit down

883
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,971
in an apartment so filthy.

884
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,771
Yeah, well, opening the windows

885
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:46,707
isn't gonna make it
any cleaner, Ma.

886
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:48,308
"Hello, mother. "

887
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:51,211
"Thanks for stopping by, mother. "

888
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:53,447
"Thanks for caring about me

889
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:54,882
in my hour of need, mother. "

890
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:56,583
Do you have to be so
dramatic all the time?

891
00:50:56,585 --> 00:50:59,219
I thought drama would be
in the spirit of things,

892
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:01,487
considering what happened
here the other night.

893
00:51:01,489 --> 00:51:03,389
Yeah, well, maybe, uh...

894
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:06,192
Maybe I'm tired of
considering the other night.

895
00:51:06,194 --> 00:51:09,428
I don't think you've started yet.

896
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:11,163
Oh!

897
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:13,065
What are you doing, James?

898
00:51:13,067 --> 00:51:14,934
I don't know, Ma.
Why don't you tell me, huh?

899
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:16,635
Do you think
you're the only man

900
00:51:16,637 --> 00:51:19,538
to discover his wife doesn't look
as good over morning coffee

901
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,940
as she did over champagne
and candlelight?

902
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:26,144
Thank you. I had no idea
it was so simple.

903
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:29,848
You just solved the riddle
of male sexuality.

904
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,917
So what is your excuse?

905
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:35,319
Men are dogs, right?

906
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:38,355
They just hump
the nearest bitch,

907
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:40,791
and it doesn't mean anything.

908
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:42,826
Dogs don't make choices!

909
00:51:42,828 --> 00:51:47,131
Okay, I made
the wrong choice.

910
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:48,398
Is that what you want to hear?

911
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,033
I fucked up.

912
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:52,902
People fuck up.

913
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:55,805
Don't you want to see the face
of the one you love

914
00:51:55,807 --> 00:51:56,973
when you wake up
in the morning?

915
00:51:56,975 --> 00:51:58,641
Oh, my God.

916
00:51:58,643 --> 00:52:01,377
Don't blame her
for growing up first.

917
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:03,646
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, no.

918
00:52:03,648 --> 00:52:07,616
Who the fuck are you to tell me
anything about relationships?

919
00:52:07,618 --> 00:52:11,086
You think I don't remember
what it was like, huh?

920
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,387
If you're such a...

921
00:52:12,389 --> 00:52:13,755
Such a fucking expert, mom,

922
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:15,857
tell me, how come you
could never stay married?

923
00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:19,027
I'm better in theory
than in practice.

924
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,198
Consider it a family trait.

925
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,068
Oh, God.

926
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:32,106
Mmm.

927
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:24,889
<i>Met Wim.</i>

928
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:27,124
Hi, Wim, this is James Ferguson.

929
00:53:27,126 --> 00:53:29,092
Hello, James.
Uh, nice party.

930
00:53:29,094 --> 00:53:30,894
Yes, it was.

931
00:53:30,896 --> 00:53:34,931
Listen, I was wondering if you've,
uh, heard anything from Nina.

932
00:53:34,933 --> 00:53:37,501
I mean, I'm trying to find out
where she's staying.

933
00:53:37,503 --> 00:53:39,503
Nina? No.

934
00:53:39,505 --> 00:53:40,904
No?

935
00:53:40,906 --> 00:53:42,038
No, I'm sorry.

936
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,272
Okay.

937
00:53:49,347 --> 00:53:50,980
Hi, Fran, it's James.

938
00:53:50,982 --> 00:53:52,548
Hello, James.
Are you okay?

939
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,216
Yeah.

940
00:53:54,218 --> 00:53:56,218
Listen, I wanted to know

941
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,019
if you'd heard anything from Nina.

942
00:53:58,021 --> 00:53:59,988
No, I haven't seen Nina.

943
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,489
No?

944
00:54:53,107 --> 00:54:55,407
Bingo.

945
00:54:59,112 --> 00:55:00,545
<i>Met Janneke Van De Kamp.</i>

946
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,114
Hello, Janneke.

947
00:55:03,116 --> 00:55:04,949
Yeah?

948
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:07,251
Hi, this is James.

949
00:55:07,253 --> 00:55:08,753
We spoke earlier.

950
00:55:08,755 --> 00:55:11,122
James.

951
00:55:11,124 --> 00:55:14,191
Oh, yes, the dog.

952
00:55:14,193 --> 00:55:15,192
Yeah.

953
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:19,429
I hope I'm not disturbing
you or anything.

954
00:55:19,431 --> 00:55:21,030
Not at all.

955
00:55:21,032 --> 00:55:25,034
I was just watching
a nature documentary.

956
00:55:25,036 --> 00:55:27,537
Oh, I see.

957
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:30,473
Well, I was just
calling because, uh...

958
00:55:34,812 --> 00:55:37,946
I'm sorry. I really don't know
why I'm calling.

959
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:43,152
I just... I've been looking
for my wife and, uh...

960
00:55:43,154 --> 00:55:46,155
<i>And you found me.</i>

961
00:55:46,157 --> 00:55:47,589
Any port in a storm?

962
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:50,258
No, no, it's not... it's not that.

963
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,359
It's just that I, uh...

964
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:53,060
Ahem.

965
00:55:53,062 --> 00:55:56,464
Well, I enjoyed our conversation,
and I thought...

966
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:58,466
Cheaper than psychotherapy.

967
00:55:58,468 --> 00:56:01,035
Yes. Yes, it is.

968
00:56:02,204 --> 00:56:03,504
Um...

969
00:56:04,873 --> 00:56:06,807
Have you ever been married?

970
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:10,710
Uh...
Yes.

971
00:56:10,712 --> 00:56:12,379
Once.

972
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:14,047
What happened?

973
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:18,151
Uh-uh-uh.

974
00:56:18,153 --> 00:56:20,253
You called me, remember?

975
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:22,454
I understand if you don't
feel like talking about it.

976
00:56:22,456 --> 00:56:24,390
You're just a voice
on the phone.

977
00:56:24,392 --> 00:56:27,092
Well, don't you think that
makes it a little easier?

978
00:56:27,094 --> 00:56:30,262
So you can imagine me
any way you want?

979
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:33,232
Right now, I think it's better
if I imagine you

980
00:56:33,234 --> 00:56:35,067
as a 300-pound paraplegic.

981
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:40,905
Well, maybe it's best if we keep
a few secrets from each other.

982
00:56:40,907 --> 00:56:43,041
I'll tell you what,
I'll make you a deal.

983
00:56:43,043 --> 00:56:46,277
What kind of deal?

984
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:48,012
We'll play a little game.

985
00:56:48,014 --> 00:56:50,148
You can ask me whatever
you want about men.

986
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,517
I will answer you as
honestly as I possibly can,

987
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:54,384
but then I get to ask you.

988
00:56:54,386 --> 00:56:57,354
Okay, but I have conditions.

989
00:56:57,356 --> 00:56:58,388
What?

990
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,257
No personal information.

991
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:01,191
Sounds fair.

992
00:57:01,193 --> 00:57:02,459
And you agree
we'll never meet.

993
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,294
Why?

994
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,930
Well, rules are what
separate us from the apes.

995
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:10,200
That way, we know
we'll always be honest.

996
00:57:10,202 --> 00:57:12,535
As long as we're just
anonymous voices on the phone,

997
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:14,370
there'll be no reason to lie.

998
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:18,507
Do you think lying is an inevitable
part of any relationship?

999
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:21,944
I think it becomes more likely,

1000
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:23,446
but we always have choice.

1001
00:57:23,448 --> 00:57:25,181
That's funny.

1002
00:57:25,183 --> 00:57:26,382
What?

1003
00:57:26,384 --> 00:57:30,051
That's exactly what
my mother said.

1004
00:57:30,053 --> 00:57:32,354
A boy should always
listen to his mother.

1005
00:57:32,356 --> 00:57:34,589
Yeah, so I've been told.

1006
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:36,124
Do we have a deal?

1007
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:37,425
We have a deal.

1008
00:57:37,427 --> 00:57:39,160
You go first.

1009
00:57:39,162 --> 00:57:43,163
Okay. Why are women
always so late?

1010
00:57:43,165 --> 00:57:46,467
Easy one.
We're fixing our hair.

1011
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:49,136
Why won't men ask directions?

1012
00:57:49,138 --> 00:57:50,237
Too proud.

1013
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:51,472
I knew it.

1014
00:57:51,474 --> 00:57:53,507
Your turn.

1015
00:57:53,509 --> 00:57:54,708
Does money really matter?

1016
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,343
Of course.

1017
00:57:56,345 --> 00:57:59,445
Will a man say anything
to get in a woman's pants?

1018
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:00,513
Absolutely.

1019
00:58:00,515 --> 00:58:03,549
Why do women
like older men?

1020
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:07,587
Security, power.

1021
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:10,123
Why do men like younger women?

1022
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:12,292
Firm tits.
Trust me on that one.

1023
00:58:12,294 --> 00:58:16,528
Biggest misconception
men have about women.

1024
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,730
That we prefer assholes.

1025
00:58:18,732 --> 00:58:21,366
Biggest misconception
women have about men?

1026
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:22,701
That we prefer bimbos,

1027
00:58:22,703 --> 00:58:25,370
unless, of course,
they have firm tits.

1028
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:29,708
I think I'm beginning
to detect a pattern here.

1029
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,710
I was wondering
when you'd pick that up.

1030
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:35,713
Oh?

1031
00:58:37,516 --> 00:58:40,217
What do they want?

1032
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:41,652
What do men want?

1033
00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:43,220
That's not fair.

1034
00:58:43,222 --> 00:58:44,822
You can't answer a question
with a question.

1035
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:49,759
Why did you let your
wife walk out on you?

1036
00:58:53,064 --> 00:58:56,366
Who told you I let
my wife walk out?

1037
00:58:56,368 --> 00:58:58,668
You said you were
trying to find her.

1038
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,570
I just figured.

1039
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:03,372
I, uh...

1040
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:05,574
I thought we said no
personal information.

1041
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:07,443
I made the rules.
I can change them.

1042
00:59:07,445 --> 00:59:09,345
A woman's prerogative.

1043
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,484
Look, I have to go.

1044
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:16,685
<i>Tot ziens.</i>

1045
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:17,786
Bye.

1046
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,257
<i>Tot ziens?</i>

1047
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,426
Did you just do what
I think you did?

1048
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,427
What?

1049
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,462
And you used my phone.

1050
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:30,698
Well, I couldn't very well use
my own phone number.

1051
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,834
What exactly do you hope
to find out

1052
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:35,435
that you don't know after
nine years of living together?

1053
00:59:37,271 --> 00:59:40,807
Well, we haven't talked like
that since we first met.

1054
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:43,944
Too bad he wasn't
talking to you.

1055
01:00:33,158 --> 01:00:35,826
An architect with acrophobia.

1056
01:00:35,828 --> 01:00:37,361
It's ironic.

1057
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:46,869
Look, uh, Pieter,
if this is your idea of a...

1058
01:00:46,871 --> 01:00:48,604
I know, James.

1059
01:01:10,393 --> 01:01:13,861
She thinks she's in love with you.

1060
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:19,300
And, somehow,
she's got it in her head

1061
01:01:19,302 --> 01:01:20,668
that you're in love with her.

1062
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,838
Do you have any idea
what gave her that notion?

1063
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,706
No.

1064
01:01:31,712 --> 01:01:34,247
Let's go back down,
Pieter, okay?

1065
01:01:34,249 --> 01:01:36,683
You're not actually thinking
I might jump, are you?

1066
01:01:39,019 --> 01:01:40,487
Don't worry.

1067
01:01:42,223 --> 01:01:44,790
In the end, no one is
really in a hurry to die.

1068
01:01:44,792 --> 01:01:47,292
You see, James,

1069
01:01:47,294 --> 01:01:50,462
you don't like the heights, but I do.

1070
01:01:50,464 --> 01:01:51,430
Up here,

1071
01:01:51,432 --> 01:01:52,798
you see the distance
between people,

1072
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,368
and for a few minutes,
we convince ourselves

1073
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:59,338
that we're in love,
that we matter,

1074
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,572
that we leave something behind...

1075
01:02:01,574 --> 01:02:02,940
a building

1076
01:02:02,942 --> 01:02:04,542
or a son.

1077
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:16,887
No, James.

1078
01:02:20,024 --> 01:02:21,358
If we ever allowed ourselves

1079
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,059
to see who we've become,

1080
01:02:23,061 --> 01:02:25,762
we couldn't live with ourselves.

1081
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,772
I'm sorry.

1082
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:42,011
I believe you are.

1083
01:02:48,817 --> 01:02:50,718
James?

1084
01:02:51,887 --> 01:02:54,022
Change before the lunch
with Wendell.

1085
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,087
This mobile phone is
currently unavailable.

1086
01:03:28,089 --> 01:03:29,355
Please try again.

1087
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:42,067
# Don't you have a word

1088
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:44,903
# To show what may be done? #

1089
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,341
# Have you never heard

1090
01:03:49,343 --> 01:03:53,644
# The way to find the sun?

1091
01:03:53,646 --> 01:03:58,148
# Tell me all that you know #

1092
01:04:40,623 --> 01:04:41,889
Oh, shit.

1093
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:45,860
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit.

1094
01:04:58,205 --> 01:04:59,406
James.

1095
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:00,473
Hi, James.
There you are.

1096
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:01,474
- Pull up a chair.
- Wendell, hi.

1097
01:05:01,476 --> 01:05:02,642
I was running a little late,

1098
01:05:02,644 --> 01:05:03,610
and he hasn't had
a walk all day.

1099
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:04,844
I hope you don't mind.

1100
01:05:04,846 --> 01:05:06,946
No, no, not at all.
I like dogs,

1101
01:05:06,948 --> 01:05:08,114
except dingoes.

1102
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:09,516
Those are another kettle
of fish entirely.

1103
01:05:09,518 --> 01:05:11,117
You know the dingo?

1104
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,485
No.

1105
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:13,886
- Australian dog?
- No.

1106
01:05:13,888 --> 01:05:15,654
Now, there's a bad dog, huh?

1107
01:05:15,656 --> 01:05:17,523
Strip the skin off a
carcass straight away,

1108
01:05:17,525 --> 01:05:19,158
unrecognizable.

1109
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,626
Like bloody piranha, they are.

1110
01:05:20,628 --> 01:05:22,961
Well, did your man
get a chance...

1111
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:24,063
Course, we don't get
piranha in Australia.

1112
01:05:24,065 --> 01:05:25,531
- Don't get piranha.
- Oh.

1113
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:28,200
Could we get something
a bit larger?

1114
01:05:28,202 --> 01:05:30,168
Beer's not meant to
be sipped, you know.

1115
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:31,636
James, Wendell and I were...

1116
01:05:31,638 --> 01:05:33,237
No deadly fish at all, really,

1117
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:35,640
except for the great white.
Now, there's a fish.

1118
01:05:35,642 --> 01:05:37,375
You don't want your feet
dangling in the water

1119
01:05:37,377 --> 01:05:38,543
when that bugger's around.

1120
01:05:38,545 --> 01:05:40,278
You're dead in two seconds.

1121
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,514
The shark has a mouth
on it the size of a manhole.

1122
01:05:43,516 --> 01:05:45,116
Man could fall right in it,

1123
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:47,250
even a man James's size,
right down the hole, gobbled...

1124
01:05:47,252 --> 01:05:48,318
- James?
- I'm sorry.

1125
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,786
- I'm sorry.
- James.

1126
01:05:49,788 --> 01:05:51,555
We've got animals over there
that cover that.

1127
01:05:51,557 --> 01:05:52,656
The crocodile, he's in the water.

1128
01:05:54,526 --> 01:05:56,093
Ahh!

1129
01:06:24,687 --> 01:06:26,888
Stay, Larry!

1130
01:06:28,758 --> 01:06:30,125
Nina!

1131
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,508
Nina!

1132
01:06:58,318 --> 01:06:59,952
Come on! Go!

1133
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,192
Now we have a full-blown
squatter situation.

1134
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,962
You have to deal with this.

1135
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:22,997
I'm not ready to deal with this!

1136
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,000
You're gonna have to talk to him

1137
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:27,534
face to face sooner or later.

1138
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:28,969
Leave me alone!

1139
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,971
Fine, I will.

1140
01:08:39,313 --> 01:08:40,647
What are you doing?

1141
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,749
Trying to bring down
property values?

1142
01:08:46,052 --> 01:08:48,521
You look like you could
use a cup of coffee.

1143
01:08:48,523 --> 01:08:49,989
Come on.

1144
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:53,993
Come on, lar.

1145
01:09:01,834 --> 01:09:04,068
There you go.

1146
01:09:07,806 --> 01:09:10,008
Well.

1147
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,409
Hmm?

1148
01:09:11,411 --> 01:09:13,912
So you can't keep your mitts
off the babes, huh?

1149
01:09:13,914 --> 01:09:15,979
Is that what she said?

1150
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:17,848
Certainly seemed
to be the case.

1151
01:09:18,917 --> 01:09:20,050
What do you think?

1152
01:09:20,052 --> 01:09:21,051
I don't know.

1153
01:09:21,053 --> 01:09:22,219
I've been working

1154
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:23,820
on the whole man/woman
thing for years,

1155
01:09:23,822 --> 01:09:26,857
and I've, uh, come to the
conclusion that men are dogs.

1156
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:29,059
And the only problem is,
I like dogs.

1157
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:30,761
Hmm?

1158
01:09:34,097 --> 01:09:36,265
Do you love her?

1159
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:40,870
Of course, I do.
That was never the question.

1160
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:44,206
What is?

1161
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:50,245
I don't know.

1162
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,747
I suppose if I knew that,

1163
01:09:52,749 --> 01:09:54,849
we wouldn't be sitting
here right now.

1164
01:09:54,851 --> 01:10:00,021
Look, if anyone can identify
with confusion, it's me.

1165
01:10:00,023 --> 01:10:02,757
My God, I've wasted
so much time

1166
01:10:02,759 --> 01:10:04,925
trying to be what other
people wanted.

1167
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:08,629
But I wasn't,

1168
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:11,031
and I couldn't.

1169
01:10:11,033 --> 01:10:13,033
When I finally accepted that,

1170
01:10:13,035 --> 01:10:14,969
things just seemed
to find their place.

1171
01:10:17,772 --> 01:10:20,907
Are you saying I should
get a sex change?

1172
01:10:21,976 --> 01:10:23,910
She told you.

1173
01:10:23,912 --> 01:10:25,411
Well, she didn't have to.

1174
01:10:25,413 --> 01:10:28,514
I mean, mannerisms,
vocal patterns.

1175
01:10:30,884 --> 01:10:34,220
No offense, but I think
you'd make a lousy woman.

1176
01:10:56,209 --> 01:11:00,044
I remember the first minute
I saw the pyramids,

1177
01:11:00,046 --> 01:11:02,880
I knew that's what I wanted to do.

1178
01:11:02,882 --> 01:11:08,051
I imagined some, uh,
10-year-old Egyptian boy

1179
01:11:08,053 --> 01:11:10,186
5,000 years before me,

1180
01:11:10,188 --> 01:11:12,188
standing in the exact same spot,

1181
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:14,658
looking at the exact
same structure.

1182
01:11:16,093 --> 01:11:19,429
Can you imagine building
something that lasts that long?

1183
01:11:19,431 --> 01:11:23,500
5,000 years of history,
and what do we do?

1184
01:11:25,535 --> 01:11:27,503
Turn it on its head.

1185
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:33,242
We do this deal,

1186
01:11:33,244 --> 01:11:36,011
then I think it's best that if
the partnership is dissolved.

1187
01:11:36,013 --> 01:11:37,379
Hey, boys!

1188
01:11:39,115 --> 01:11:40,114
Hi, Wendell.

1189
01:11:40,116 --> 01:11:42,417
Pieter.

1190
01:11:42,419 --> 01:11:44,485
Hi, how are you?

1191
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:46,054
That's my man,
Winston Friedmann.

1192
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:47,255
You've heard of Friedmann
and Friedmann.

1193
01:11:47,257 --> 01:11:48,322
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

1194
01:11:48,324 --> 01:11:49,490
Nice meeting you.

1195
01:11:49,492 --> 01:11:50,892
He's been going
over your specs

1196
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:52,260
like a rat in a chunk of cheddar.

1197
01:11:52,262 --> 01:11:53,194
Yeah?

1198
01:11:53,196 --> 01:11:55,329
Problems.
Deal's off.

1199
01:11:55,331 --> 01:11:57,464
You're kidding me.

1200
01:11:57,466 --> 01:11:58,532
Bloody thing can't be built.

1201
01:11:58,534 --> 01:12:00,233
Course, it can be built.

1202
01:12:00,235 --> 01:12:02,569
We've run every possible
stress analysis.

1203
01:12:02,571 --> 01:12:04,271
The structure is sound.
Look at it.

1204
01:12:04,273 --> 01:12:06,073
Sound, all right,
till the wind blows.

1205
01:12:06,075 --> 01:12:09,142
This building will stand up
to 160-mile-an-hour winds.

1206
01:12:09,144 --> 01:12:10,243
Come on!

1207
01:12:10,245 --> 01:12:11,411
It'll do that all right, mate.

1208
01:12:11,413 --> 01:12:13,379
33-mile-an-hour breeze
is your problem.

1209
01:12:13,381 --> 01:12:14,847
What?

1210
01:12:18,351 --> 01:12:20,419
Harmonics.
Winston?

1211
01:12:20,421 --> 01:12:23,022
Tacoma narrows bridge, 1940.

1212
01:12:23,024 --> 01:12:26,125
Knocked down
by a 42-mile-per-hour wind.

1213
01:12:26,127 --> 01:12:27,693
Engineers hadn't
taken into account...

1214
01:12:27,695 --> 01:12:29,360
We've looked at the range
of wind velocity

1215
01:12:29,362 --> 01:12:31,563
for every possible
resonant frequency.

1216
01:12:31,565 --> 01:12:33,264
You've looked,
but you didn't listen.

1217
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,499
This represents a wind

1218
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:38,570
of 33 Miles per hour
on your scale.

1219
01:12:39,672 --> 01:12:41,139
On the full-scale version,

1220
01:12:41,141 --> 01:12:44,275
this translates into a
resonance feedback loop

1221
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,177
peaking at about 150 decibels.

1222
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:50,147
Little tornadoes would be
generating within minutes.

1223
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:52,149
The windows would just implode,

1224
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:55,185
and you don't want to be inside
there when this happens.

1225
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:01,524
Dead in two seconds.

1226
01:13:14,305 --> 01:13:15,538
Sorry.

1227
01:13:39,662 --> 01:13:41,028
<i>Met Janneke Van De Kamp.</i>

1228
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:43,164
- Hi, I need to talk.
- What about?

1229
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:47,034
Uh, well, I think I'm about
to do something pretty stupid.

1230
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:49,335
You ever feel like your, uh...

1231
01:13:49,337 --> 01:13:51,371
Entire life has been a bad dream

1232
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:54,507
that you just can't wake up from?

1233
01:13:54,509 --> 01:13:56,543
I just lost my job.

1234
01:13:56,545 --> 01:13:57,977
James.

1235
01:13:57,979 --> 01:14:00,647
Uh, James, I'm sorry.

1236
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:02,448
No! No, no, no, no.

1237
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:03,516
It's good, it's good.

1238
01:14:03,518 --> 01:14:06,018
I mean...

1239
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,786
Look, I really need
your help, Janneke.

1240
01:14:07,788 --> 01:14:10,289
Well, I thought we agreed
nothing personal.

1241
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:12,124
Forget the rules, okay?

1242
01:14:12,126 --> 01:14:14,459
Well, rules are important, James.

1243
01:14:14,461 --> 01:14:16,595
Yeah, I know, they're what
separate us from the apes.

1244
01:14:16,597 --> 01:14:18,497
Janneke, I'm at her house.

1245
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:20,332
- Who?
- Nina, my wife,

1246
01:14:20,334 --> 01:14:23,534
I'm at her house.

1247
01:14:23,536 --> 01:14:24,569
I got to talk to her.

1248
01:14:24,571 --> 01:14:26,571
I... I'm wasting time.

1249
01:14:26,573 --> 01:14:28,573
I got to tell her I screwed up.

1250
01:14:28,575 --> 01:14:29,707
I know that now.

1251
01:14:29,709 --> 01:14:31,976
It's like I used to think
that we were defined

1252
01:14:31,978 --> 01:14:33,144
by who we slept with,

1253
01:14:33,146 --> 01:14:34,445
and I know that's not true now.

1254
01:14:34,447 --> 01:14:35,680
I know it's who you love,

1255
01:14:35,682 --> 01:14:37,647
and she's the only person
that I've ever...

1256
01:14:37,649 --> 01:14:39,216
Janneke, you got to help me.

1257
01:14:39,218 --> 01:14:40,717
I mean, what do I say to her?

1258
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,152
For Christ sakes,
how do you apologize

1259
01:14:42,154 --> 01:14:43,353
to someone who's
never gonna believe

1260
01:14:43,355 --> 01:14:44,688
another word you say
for the rest of your life?

1261
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,022
I think you should reconsider.

1262
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:47,424
Nina!
Nina!

1263
01:14:48,492 --> 01:14:49,492
Nina!

1264
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:53,229
Nina!
Nina!

1265
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:54,496
James...

1266
01:15:12,615 --> 01:15:14,282
What are you doing, James?

1267
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:56,389
That'd be me.

1268
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:57,822
With over two decades'
experience

1269
01:15:57,824 --> 01:15:58,857
in couples counseling.

1270
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:00,425
Hard to believe.

1271
01:16:00,427 --> 01:16:01,459
Dr. bouvier became well-known

1272
01:16:01,461 --> 01:16:03,228
for developing the bouvier system

1273
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:04,562
for relationship enhancement.

1274
01:16:04,564 --> 01:16:07,332
Doctor, what can you tell us
about your latest...

1275
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:11,836
You think you're
going to, you know,

1276
01:16:11,838 --> 01:16:13,371
get on with your life
at some point?

1277
01:16:13,373 --> 01:16:15,706
You know, the thing
about games,

1278
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:18,042
unless it's solitaire,
you both have to play.

1279
01:16:21,546 --> 01:16:24,281
Until you deal with this,
you won't be able to move on.

1280
01:16:24,283 --> 01:16:28,485
We have too much history.

1281
01:16:28,487 --> 01:16:29,986
Then invent a new one.

1282
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:43,800
Hey, how do I look?

1283
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,571
Hmm, she's really pretty.

1284
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,280
Oh, poor baby.

1285
01:16:58,282 --> 01:16:59,881
Why don't you let him in?

1286
01:16:59,883 --> 01:17:01,216
He's okay.

1287
01:17:01,218 --> 01:17:03,484
No witness, no crime?

1288
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:19,799
Oh.

1289
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,569
What?

1290
01:17:23,604 --> 01:17:24,838
Nothing.

1291
01:17:35,716 --> 01:17:37,683
Oh, James.

1292
01:17:37,685 --> 01:17:40,119
You think we could do this
without the talking?

1293
01:17:41,688 --> 01:17:44,123
Yes, I do.

1294
01:17:46,493 --> 01:17:47,760
Ooh.

1295
01:18:04,878 --> 01:18:06,743
Mmm!

1296
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:20,624
Oh!

1297
01:18:23,894 --> 01:18:25,961
Don't tell me you're
feeling guilty.

1298
01:18:31,902 --> 01:18:35,671
I'm sorry, but I think
you should probably go.

1299
01:18:40,242 --> 01:18:41,576
Ahem.

1300
01:18:43,579 --> 01:18:47,982
Huh! My mom said
you were such a stud.

1301
01:19:08,304 --> 01:19:12,138
Hey! Larry, cut that out.

1302
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,547
What are you doing?
Hey!

1303
01:19:15,214 --> 01:19:16,707
Hey!

1304
01:19:34,327 --> 01:19:37,195
James? Hi.

1305
01:19:37,197 --> 01:19:39,498
I just wanted to see you
before I left.

1306
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,199
You want to come upstairs?

1307
01:19:41,201 --> 01:19:42,400
No, no, I'm in a hurry,

1308
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:44,135
and I wanted to answer
that question.

1309
01:19:44,137 --> 01:19:45,669
What question?

1310
01:19:45,671 --> 01:19:49,106
You know, you asked me
why I never stayed married.

1311
01:19:49,108 --> 01:19:52,643
Oh, I wanted to...
Once.

1312
01:19:52,645 --> 01:19:55,179
The one time I was
prepared to stick it out,

1313
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:57,148
he wasn't,

1314
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:01,651
and I had someone else
to think about, too.

1315
01:20:01,653 --> 01:20:03,653
Look...

1316
01:20:03,655 --> 01:20:05,555
About the other day...

1317
01:20:07,258 --> 01:20:09,159
I'm sorry.

1318
01:20:09,161 --> 01:20:10,960
Aw.

1319
01:20:10,962 --> 01:20:12,061
I love you.

1320
01:20:13,497 --> 01:20:14,931
When's your flight?

1321
01:20:14,933 --> 01:20:16,165
I cancelled it.

1322
01:20:16,167 --> 01:20:17,199
What?

1323
01:20:20,603 --> 01:20:22,604
We're going on a bicycle tour

1324
01:20:22,606 --> 01:20:25,140
of World War II battle sites.

1325
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:28,677
Ma, Hendrik?

1326
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:30,612
He was a hero during the war.

1327
01:20:30,614 --> 01:20:32,280
You know that?

1328
01:20:32,282 --> 01:20:35,349
He saved Jews, lots of them.

1329
01:20:37,086 --> 01:20:39,420
Bye.

1330
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:43,057
Okay, I'm ready.

1331
01:20:43,059 --> 01:20:44,625
You go first.

1332
01:20:44,627 --> 01:20:46,427
- I'm first? Okay.
- Okay.

1333
01:20:46,429 --> 01:20:47,694
Are you ready for the trip?

1334
01:20:47,696 --> 01:20:49,963
- Yeah.
- Okay, fine.

1335
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,991
It hasn't stopped ringing.

1336
01:21:37,408 --> 01:21:39,243
<i>Met Janneke Van De Kamp.</i>

1337
01:21:39,245 --> 01:21:40,464
Hi.

1338
01:21:41,323 --> 01:21:42,531
Hi.

1339
01:21:45,049 --> 01:21:46,850
I need to talk to you.

1340
01:21:46,852 --> 01:21:50,554
Because you don't
really know me?

1341
01:21:50,556 --> 01:21:52,722
Because...

1342
01:21:52,724 --> 01:21:55,091
Because we've
never really met?

1343
01:21:56,893 --> 01:21:58,761
No, because the person

1344
01:21:58,763 --> 01:22:00,663
that I really want to talk to

1345
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,064
won't talk to me.

1346
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:06,068
I, uh...

1347
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:07,936
I brought someone
over here tonight.

1348
01:22:09,705 --> 01:22:11,606
She was, uh...

1349
01:22:11,608 --> 01:22:15,310
Just someone,
you know, anyone.

1350
01:22:17,413 --> 01:22:19,180
But I couldn't.

1351
01:22:19,182 --> 01:22:21,683
Couldn't what?

1352
01:22:21,685 --> 01:22:23,485
She was a...

1353
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:25,686
A fantasy, you know...

1354
01:22:25,688 --> 01:22:29,290
young, beautiful, willing,

1355
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:31,225
but I couldn't.

1356
01:22:31,227 --> 01:22:32,993
I started to hate
everything about her.

1357
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:36,597
The way she moved,
the way she talked,

1358
01:22:36,599 --> 01:22:38,732
the way she touched
our things like they...

1359
01:22:42,603 --> 01:22:44,704
I don't know, I...

1360
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:50,209
Maybe at first, I, uh...

1361
01:22:50,211 --> 01:22:51,644
I thought that somehow

1362
01:22:51,646 --> 01:22:54,714
I had forgotten who I married,
you know?

1363
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:59,418
But I realize now that's
it's so much worse,

1364
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,553
because without her,

1365
01:23:01,555 --> 01:23:06,792
I can't even begin to imagine
who I'm supposed to be.

1366
01:23:08,294 --> 01:23:09,961
If only I could tell her
that, you know?

1367
01:23:09,963 --> 01:23:11,830
If there was just some
way I could, uh...

1368
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,300
What?

1369
01:23:16,302 --> 01:23:20,104
James, what would you tell her?

1370
01:23:21,206 --> 01:23:23,741
I would tell her that I love her,

1371
01:23:23,743 --> 01:23:25,343
and that I always have...

1372
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,114
And that, in the end,
we become who we pretend to be,

1373
01:23:31,116 --> 01:23:33,516
and I don't want to be
that person anymore.

1374
01:23:33,518 --> 01:23:35,819
Choices, you know?

1375
01:23:35,821 --> 01:23:37,287
We can make choices.

1376
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:40,323
I used to think I wanted
some sort of lifestyle...

1377
01:23:40,325 --> 01:23:46,128
a good job, fabulous friends,
all the creature comforts.

1378
01:23:47,497 --> 01:23:49,932
But it's gone, all of it,

1379
01:23:49,934 --> 01:23:51,433
and it doesn't matter
to me at all,

1380
01:23:51,435 --> 01:23:55,270
because I realize now
that it doesn't mean anything

1381
01:23:55,272 --> 01:23:57,239
without some sort of context.

1382
01:24:01,677 --> 01:24:03,478
And that's what she was...

1383
01:24:05,381 --> 01:24:07,915
My context.

1384
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:10,084
What if it's too late?

1385
01:24:19,527 --> 01:24:22,462
Then it's too late.

1386
01:24:25,066 --> 01:24:26,700
Look, I have to go.

1387
01:24:35,777 --> 01:24:37,209
Good-bye, Nina.

1388
01:25:14,879 --> 01:25:15,946
Hello?

1389
01:25:15,948 --> 01:25:17,181
I've changed my mind.

1390
01:25:17,183 --> 01:25:18,182
What do you mean?

1391
01:25:18,184 --> 01:25:19,416
I think we should meet.

1392
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:20,984
Right now.
You pick the place.

1393
01:25:20,986 --> 01:25:22,618
Look, there's something
I got to tell you.

1394
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:23,653
No, we need to meet.

1395
01:25:23,655 --> 01:25:25,087
What about the rules?

1396
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:27,256
The apes?

1397
01:25:27,258 --> 01:25:29,659
Fuck the apes.

1398
01:26:24,912 --> 01:26:27,679
You wouldn't happen to have
an aspirin, would you?

1399
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:30,015
No.

1400
01:26:30,017 --> 01:26:35,254
No. No more games, okay?

1401
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:38,390
Yeah. It's just that, uh...
Ahem.

1402
01:26:38,392 --> 01:26:40,392
I could really use an aspirin.

1403
01:26:48,567 --> 01:26:50,067
I knew.

1404
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:52,570
Oh, I knew you knew.

1405
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,510
Yeah.

1406
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:07,217
You never looked better.

1407
01:27:07,219 --> 01:27:08,585
No.

1408
01:27:10,421 --> 01:27:13,256
I'm moving back to New York.

1409
01:27:23,099 --> 01:27:24,433
Why did you ask me
to meet you here?

1410
01:27:24,435 --> 01:27:25,834
I didn't want to tell
you over the phone.

1411
01:27:25,836 --> 01:27:29,171
Tell me what?
That you're leaving?

1412
01:27:29,173 --> 01:27:31,139
Thank you very, very much.

1413
01:27:31,141 --> 01:27:33,207
Have a nice trip, huh?

1414
01:27:33,209 --> 01:27:34,509
<i>Tot ziens.</i>

1415
01:27:34,511 --> 01:27:37,245
What did you want?
Why did you call me?

1416
01:27:37,247 --> 01:27:38,246
Why?

1417
01:27:38,248 --> 01:27:39,347
I had to know.

1418
01:27:39,349 --> 01:27:41,449
Had to know what?

1419
01:27:41,451 --> 01:27:44,919
Well, Janneke was
my way of finding out

1420
01:27:44,921 --> 01:27:47,287
why this person that I
thought I knew so well

1421
01:27:47,289 --> 01:27:49,456
did what he did.

1422
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,563
I tried so hard to be
who you wanted me to be.

1423
01:27:58,032 --> 01:28:00,734
Somehow, along the way,
I just, um...

1424
01:28:05,172 --> 01:28:07,473
I forgot who I was.

1425
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:12,211
I can live without you, James.

1426
01:28:12,213 --> 01:28:15,181
I cannot live without myself.

1427
01:28:26,292 --> 01:28:28,426
I'm sorry.

1428
01:28:33,065 --> 01:28:34,498
I know.

1429
01:28:49,381 --> 01:28:52,115
I'm gonna miss Amsterdam.

1430
01:28:58,555 --> 01:29:01,791
I wish I could say the same.

1431
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:12,868
Hey.

1432
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:17,539
It's not as if anything's
keeping you here.
