1
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:27,965
Soldiers!
The soldiers are coming!

2
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:43,874
The soldiers are coming!

3
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,932
In position!
Keep up the posts!

4
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,005
In position!

5
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:49,835
Mercy of God
hear our prayer.

6
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:12,162
Get back! Get Back !
Get back!

7
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:22,808
Mom? Mom?
Mom?

8
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:34,220
- Jason !
- Already Are!

9
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:02,579
We must   gather the archers
Western Wall...

10
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,589
Lord, the Western Wall has fallen.

11
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:07,748
- Send them back to the ledge!
- The archers are all dead!

12
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:11,257
- Majesty!
- Jason ! Thank the gods!

13
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:14,825
- It is safe!
- No, the enemy surrounded over the palace.

14
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,521
So let's gather
guard and remove them from the palace.

15
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,246
Majesty, we were overwhelmed!

16
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,912
Majesty, Save yourself,
Save your son!

17
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:07,251
Hera, look for us.

18
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:09,268
Please hear our prayer.

19
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:12,289
Gracious lady, mother of the gods,
protect us from the enemy.

20
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,039
Take the boy!
Take it now!

21
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:56,057
Brother.

22
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:59,214
I should have known
it would come to this.

23
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:02,437
I am only here to claim what is mine.

24
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,058
Your claim is false.

25
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,781
I would rather die than see
my kingdom in your hands.

26
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,030
Kill me.

27
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:24,204
But in the name of your honor,
spare my wife and my child.

28
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,591
Brother, brother, brother.

29
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,207
What do you think I am?
A Savage !

30
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:35,429
Let me show you...

31
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,065
how  gracious I am in victory.

32
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:43,058
Only I seek my destiny.

33
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:50,071
No !

34
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,657
And my destiny is to rule.

35
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,840
The son and heir.

36
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:18,012
Well, well.

37
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:20,969
No, please.

38
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:23,182
Nephew.

39
00:07:27,342 --> 00:07:30,178
Please, he is a child.
Please.

40
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:36,317
I beg you.

41
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:41,782
Take it!

42
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:45,859
Kill him!

43
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,412
Very Impressive.

44
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,172
- Don't say anything.
- There's nothing to say.

45
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,503
your weight should be more
on the front foot.

46
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:32,260
Yes , I know.

47
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,849
So try again? Or in comings
games, let embarrassment.

48
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:41,375
No, I have great things more than
games.

49
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,781
Interesting as the Lamb
revolves around the Ursa...

50
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:03,824
with theta and gamma
leading the way.

51
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:06,910
Teta and epsilon.

52
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:09,206
Ofcourse.

53
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:11,464
I had that dream again.

54
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,154
The gods torment me ,
and I do not know why ?

55
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:24,630
It's not only a dream, Jason.

56
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:26,571
It is a memory.

57
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:31,512
What is this?

58
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:35,575
It is the emblem of Hera,
It offers Her protection.

59
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,224
It belonged to your mother.

60
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,058
Queen Polymela...

61
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,015
wife of Aeson , King of lolcus .

62
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:44,822
My father was king?

63
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:50,177
He was killed by Pelias,
his own brother.

64
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:54,343
- And my mother?
- She lives.

65
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,541
Why she never sent news?
She did not know where I am?

66
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,806
When Pelias stole the crown,
he took her as his wife and queen.

67
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:08,015
But you are the
rightful heir of the throne...

68
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,592
and that makes you
mortal enemy of Pelias .

69
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:14,459
And my mother?
Is she my enemy too ?

70
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:18,281
Are you alright?

71
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,321
I would like to cross this river...

72
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,567
but it flows so deep and vast.

73
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,380
I will help you,if you like .

74
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,761
Very kind of you, young man.

75
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:36,129
Where are you bound for , young man?
Lolcus?

76
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:37,176
- You know it ?
- Yes.

77
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:41,554
And what do you seek in lolcus?
Not riches, I hope.

78
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:43,353
No.

79
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:47,737
Great as it is a very poor country.
Was sucked by their king.

80
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,829
- Pelias?
- Pelias, the tax creator.

81
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:57,267
Ofcourse searching for the Golden Fleece
it is an expensive endeavor.

82
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:00,818
The Golden Fleece?

83
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,585
The greatest gift of the gods
to humans.

84
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:06,771
craved by Pelias ........

85
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,153
He believes that the Fleece
grants his wish.

86
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:16,493
Your charity will not be forgotten.

87
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:37,599
Let me
lead the next voyage, my father.

88
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:41,297
If I see you  ..trust your own son...
- It will make no difference .

89
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,335
Unfortunately, populace have
yet to learn the great benefits

90
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,936
the Fleece will stow upon them.

91
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,533
- What is it ?
- An omen , sir.

92
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:55,341
of the great importance.

93
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,562
I see a young man.

94
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,023
There is vengeance in his heart.

95
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,862
- He threatens your throne.
- What?

96
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:05,110
- Another rebel?
- No

97
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,454
- Who, then?
- I do not know .

98
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,369
What is he looks like?

99
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:13,252
I only know he wears
only one sandal.

100
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,188
I believe, he has protection of the gods.

101
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:19,578
Find him!

102
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:52,555
- What do you see?
- He's here, Your Majesty.

103
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:54,252
In lolcus.

104
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:07,992
Is it?

105
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:11,081
I believe so, sir.

106
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,974
What brings you to come to the lolcus, boy?

107
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:16,882
I came to find my mother.

108
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:20,512
- Who is your mother?
- Polymela.

109
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:23,437
Bring her.

110
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:26,887
How do we know that you are not an impostor?

111
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,848
I have this amulet,
given by my mother .

112
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,860
You know what we do with frauds?

113
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:46,506
I am not a fraud .

114
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,377
- Called?
- Ah, my dear...

115
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:59,914
we have a young man here
claims to be your son.

116
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:02,340
Take a good look at him .

117
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:05,825
What then?

118
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,195
You know him or not, my dear?

119
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:11,534
I do not know

120
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,482
And the amulet...

121
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,565
with the emblem of his so beloved Hera?

122
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,076
I've never seen.

123
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,184
Very well .

124
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,183
Take him down.

125
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,897
- We will execute him tomorrow.
- No!

126
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,636
Is something job, remembering,
my dear?

127
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,870
So, how do you find your mother, boy?

128
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:48,314
It's how you remember?

129
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:52,049
Or even more beautiful?

130
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:58,816
Did not know you  have come
back to certain death?

131
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,833
Take him!

132
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,834
My lord,
I beg you to spare him.

133
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,245
Give me one good reason.

134
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,739
Because I find the Golden Fleece.

135
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:12,406
What?

136
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:15,002
Leave us.

137
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,124
- My lord.
- Get out! out!

138
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:32,087
What do you know about the Fleece?

139
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:33,602
I can find it.

140
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:38,004
Because I have the protection of the gods.

141
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:49,785
Tell me

142
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:52,822
if you bring the Fleece to me ...

143
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:57,764
... what you expect in return?
- Only my birthright.

144
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,920
Now, dear nephew.
Here is my generous offer:

145
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,725
if you should bring the Fleece back ...

146
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:12,433
again be Prince and shall be entitled..
in succeession after ny death.

147
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:14,247
My dad, I protest!

148
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:19,118
I'm going to give you a boat.
You have to find  a crew.....

149
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:23,883
It's not easy, but its incentive
will be sensational.

150
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,172
Because, you are not come back in six months...

151
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:31,183
your mother's life will be forfieted

152
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,289
Very simple,
and is not open to negotiation.

153
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:41,738
your mother
in exchange for Fleece.

154
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:56,151
I brought you  something .

155
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,821
- Thank you.
- Jason...

156
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,962
I wish you to say...
do not return.

157
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:15,976
Promise me you will not return.

158
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:20,083
I have no choice.

159
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:23,517
Even though return with the Fleece,
Pelias will kill you.

160
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,003
The Fleece is his obsession.

161
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,590
He believes
perform his greatest desire.

162
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,619
What is it?

163
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:34,764
Immortality.

164
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,648
Eternal Freedom of death
so you can reign forever.

165
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,676
He will not let you to live.

166
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:56,003
You know your husband well

167
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:01,713
I had to learn his vice.

168
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,883
For my sake and for you.
Who has not been in vain.

169
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:26,602
The finest and fastest ship ever built

170
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,876
And the most expensive.

171
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:34,965
- Is she not? Master Argos?
- and she is ,Majesty, but she is the best
we've ever designed.

172
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:37,694
Each joint is perfect,
each nail well placed.

173
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,258
We need now the crew of worthy...

174
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,725
What is it called?

175
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:47,146
Pelias.
It seemed natural. although...

176
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,465
I am not sure now
it provides sufficient inspiration.

177
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:52,438
Your Majesty...

178
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,040
I suggest "The Great Wave"
in honor of its speed?

179
00:19:56,588 --> 00:20:00,138
Or may be "Argo" in honor
the man who built it?

180
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:02,282
Oh, I like that.

181
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,969
I do not know what to say.

182
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:07,497
It's the least we can do,
I mean considering...

183
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:10,083
you will be sailing  .....

184
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:13,080
- I, sir?
- You sir.

185
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:16,672
Of course, sir.

186
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:24,120
Goddess Hera, hear my prayer.

187
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:27,726
Protect my darling son, Jason.

188
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:32,540
East it safely.
Protect him from his youth.

189
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:48,459
Zeus, my lord.
What is ..from my bed?

190
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:51,861
Affairs of mortals, Queen Hera.

191
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:55,468
Affairs with mortals,
I believe.

192
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:06,334
- And what is the nature of your complaint today?
- I know you have been chasing mortal women .

193
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:09,549
You will hear me!

194
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:11,844
Do you think I'm blind?

195
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:19,533
Humiliate ..a goddess  when ..
with the mortals.

196
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:21,930
Don't you think, your duty

197
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:24,268
is to obey.

198
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:32,732
Otherwise, descend on Earth
and stick her with his spite.

199
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:33,861
Do not tempt me.

200
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:02,556
Seeking men who know the sea.

201
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,238
But only the best...

202
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:09,245
those willing to face dangers...

203
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,242
and prepared to risk all in search...

204
00:22:14,055 --> 00:22:15,271
the Golden Fleece.

205
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:23,282
In choosing the ..
I promise you honor and glory.

206
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:28,853
I'll take him outside and ...

207
00:22:39,194 --> 00:22:42,607
Who are you?
Why did you hit me?

208
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:45,213
The guy behind you
carrying a knife, and would have used.

209
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:46,252
Why?

210
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,090
You mentioned the Fleece. Nothing
wise sailors in company.

211
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:52,406
But I have to find the crew.

212
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:58,402
I will come
I can pull alone .

213
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:00,383
I'm no sailor, but...

214
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,293
That's it.

215
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:17,041
These are farmers, campesinos., ..
Do not serve.

216
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,683
- Who is this man?
- Laertes, a shepherd.

217
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:14,066
What do you think?

218
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,098
Sir, I understand the need of a crew, but...

219
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:20,062
So, you like dangers ?

220
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:30,738
- I said  to keep into the side, not here.
- You said "in the middle".

221
00:24:31,244 --> 00:24:32,902
-No, I said it , Here!
- Where?

222
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:35,004
- Here!
- It seems to be hard work.

223
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:39,568
Have you ever been in the sea?

224
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,276
No , you ?
- Where?

225
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:47,424
- The sea.
- When?

226
00:24:48,063 --> 00:24:49,305
- Does not matter.
- How?

227
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,527
Boat!

228
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:54,824
No, never.

229
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:57,845
A drunk, a shepherd,
two cavouqueiros...

230
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:00,773
who never rode a saddle,
they gave a node or held an oar.

231
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:02,297
They have heart.

232
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:05,979
- they must be more like them.
- I hope not.

233
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,511
The sea is merciless ...

234
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:11,463
and can only get by
skill and experience .

235
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,258
Without that, you invite death.

236
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:16,516
Not sail with this crew.

237
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:19,390
It was the order of Pelias,
on pain of death.

238
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:21,972
So my death will be quick.

239
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:28,145
alright , rest!

240
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:42,818
Hello, young man.

241
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,345
How are these strong legs?

242
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:50,884
Do not you remember me?
You helped me cross the river.

243
00:25:52,132 --> 00:25:52,688
Ofcourse.

244
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,503
I told your charity
would be rewarded.

245
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:58,147
Go to  Archas, the map-maker.

246
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,292
He will show you the way to the
Golden Fleece.

247
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,188
Thank you.

248
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:16,333
What is this young man to you?

249
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,930
A toy?

250
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:24,156
to Play with him  just to spite
Pelias?

251
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:27,145
Why?

252
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:31,813
because , you are jealous.

253
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:36,340
Because heworships Poseidon
not you?

254
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:39,254
It's what you think, great Zeus?

255
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:43,147
That my affection is caused by jealousy...

256
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:48,673
rather than by their youthful beauty?

257
00:26:48,988 --> 00:26:52,532
rather than  her thighs as soft
and strong as an olive branch?

258
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:55,334
- Enough!
- Or his lips...

259
00:26:56,123 --> 00:26:57,483
as sweet as...

260
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:02,800
Listen here.

261
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,660
That his smooth face ..  insolent "baby"

262
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:13,897
Whatever try ..relay on it .

263
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,266
I will make them...

264
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:24,785
10,000 times more difficult!

265
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:57,110
Oh ! Don't stop.

266
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:59,900
- play on, please.
- There's a price.

267
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,830
A place in a ship.

268
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:07,368
- What do you know of the sea?
- Nothing.

269
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:12,227
Facing the sea without knowledge
or ability,  brings only death.

270
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:14,793
Death .... ble

271
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:19,673
Danger,I do not fear  and can
entertain you with music.

272
00:28:20,052 --> 00:28:22,339
Music to tame the beasts...

273
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:27,538
raises the hearts of men to heaven
and makes the lark singing.

274
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:30,940
- What's your name?
- Orpheus.

275
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:37,323
- What can I do you for?
- I am looking for a map.

276
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:38,542
I have many maps.

277
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:41,796
I am looking for a map that
only  leads me to  Golden Fleece.

278
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,674
If such a map exists,
it would have great price.

279
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:56,855
This is all I have.

280
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:10,929
Keep it.
It will be more useful to you than to me. Come in.

281
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:28,015
What do you know about the stars?

282
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:32,422
I learned a little about them.

283
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:46,182
- I've never seen a map like this.
- There is no map like this.

284
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:50,879
Read it well,
and it will take you to the end of the world.

285
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:53,231
Sagittarius...

286
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:58,295
Signess and Delfino....
and this a chart.

287
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:00,772
A chart .. stars.

288
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:06,494
No map takes you to the Fleece.
It lies in unknown sea.

289
00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:09,838
But follow this chart
and it will take you to the Tabletop Island.

290
00:30:11,112 --> 00:30:12,882
There you will find the
prophet Fineas .

291
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:15,728
It is said that he knows the secret of
Fleece.

292
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:19,306
How to pass thro' water such a map?

293
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:21,542
With the help of my son
and apprentice , Zetes.

294
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:26,123
The gods given him  eyes
10 times sharper than the eagle.

295
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:29,292
and you can see other way
the end of the world?

296
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:34,003
Only the heavens . the great
formation of the constellations.

297
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:37,176
I need someone such as
... my crew

298
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,791
will be...

299
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:40,985
but Zetes has a job to do here...

300
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,083
which he should be doing now.

301
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,556
May the Gods
Speed your way!

302
00:30:55,762 --> 00:30:56,868
Thanks for this.

303
00:31:12,677 --> 00:31:14,964
Stop!
Somebody stop him !

304
00:31:23,264 --> 00:31:23,688
Stop!

305
00:31:32,314 --> 00:31:34,487
Is this is what we're looking for?

306
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:44,321
I thank the gods.

307
00:31:45,577 --> 00:31:47,900
- And you so.
- My pleasure .

308
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,833
- What is that?
- A map.

309
00:31:52,508 --> 00:31:53,785
Where this lead you ?

310
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:56,800
To Fineas Island and from there,
Golden Fleece.

311
00:31:57,886 --> 00:32:01,406
So you're the young captain?
Men say you are a fool.

312
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:04,877
Just to hide fear and cowardice.
Do you share their opinion?

313
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:10,610
Do you know with whom you speak?
Follow me.

314
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:13,425
Get more men.
Dig aroud.

315
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,677
Who are you?

316
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,219
I am Hercules.

317
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,784
This boat will find the Golden Fleece.

318
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,239
And I am going  with it!

319
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,524
Are you heroes or
are you cowards?

320
00:33:58,214 --> 00:33:59,173
I will go

321
00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:02,200
- and I.
- and I.

322
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,802
-and I !
- and I .

323
00:34:04,858 --> 00:34:05,849
Remember me, sir?

324
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,699
- you are looking as thief !
- Reformed thief , sir.

325
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,674
- Since when?
- Since this morning, sir.

326
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:14,879
Nicelooking .... sir.

327
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:16,846
My amulet?

328
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,034
Yes  , a good will
on my part.

329
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,545
- I'd like to come with you.
- Why?

330
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,241
To improve myself ,sir
....... .

331
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,075
- Give me a chance, sir.
- For what?

332
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,442
you can steal  as .. thief ?

333
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,473
Well, better to take
the Fleece than a thief?

334
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:51,383
So ... Mopsus?
A drink to our journey?

335
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,934
No, sir.
I vowed never to drink again.

336
00:34:58,331 --> 00:34:59,939
What do you think of this Jason?

337
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:03,037
He talks well.
Let's see how sails.

338
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:05,844
My last job was the most difficult.

339
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:10,688
I had to spoon the Hespéride golden apples.

340
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:13,233
Atlas, my friend...

341
00:35:13,621 --> 00:35:15,716
was the only Titan high enough
to reach them.

342
00:35:17,471 --> 00:35:21,253
I held the weight of the heavens
in his den.

343
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:29,832
- to the end of the world?
- What did your father say?

344
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,794
I haven't told him.

345
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:39,471
- A Musician?
- Yes.

346
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:45,390
Here you are, sir musician.

347
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:54,886
In the water!
In the water!

348
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:56,768
Jason!

349
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:02,318
What are you doing here?

350
00:36:04,835 --> 00:36:06,746
- I am coming with you.
- You can not.

351
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:08,868
Really?

352
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:13,474
not a Woman

353
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,648
Slag!
Look at them.

354
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:57,183
It was 10 days.

355
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,055
Keep in time !
Zetes!

356
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:03,654
Accompany barrel.
Look at the man before him.

357
00:37:04,108 --> 00:37:04,496
Come on!

358
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,371
- Come back here! Come here!
- Kill him.

359
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:14,796
What does this asshole
is doing on board?

360
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:17,357
- Let's throw it overboard.
- Why?

361
00:37:17,962 --> 00:37:20,068
Because he is the king's son.
We hate you!

362
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:22,085
- Really?
- You!

363
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:25,061
We can nail it to the mast and let
seagulls pluck out his eyes.

364
00:37:25,254 --> 00:37:26,928
Silence!
Equion, save it!

365
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:29,008
What are you doing now !

366
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:33,668
Do as he says!

367
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,151
There will be no blood shed on board.

368
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:52,566
Watch out for him.
Is as elusive as a snake.

369
00:37:52,777 --> 00:37:54,020
He's my brother.

370
00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:56,655
We want  back to the oars!

371
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:04,498
Do not blame them for hating me.

372
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:07,146
It is my father's reputation .

373
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:11,608
It is a curse to me.
A curse I wish to undo.

374
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:14,586
First sail with you,
'll get rid of that reputation.

375
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,675
How is that ?

376
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:19,368
If we have the Fleece...

377
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:23,196
we may get rid of a tyrant, a monster.

378
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:27,658
if you have with the Fleece,
you can destroy him.

379
00:38:28,162 --> 00:38:32,335
If I have the Fleece , bound to give to your  father.
Tmy mother's life is at stake or not

380
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,963
's Why I'm here,
to help our mother.

381
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:39,301
Jason, because of this bargain,
I will learn what my father really is.

382
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,704
A ship.

383
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:49,722
A lone ship

384
00:38:55,588 --> 00:38:56,871
Why?

385
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:00,175
What does this mean?

386
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,067
Where is this ship?

387
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:06,308
Far yet.

388
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:09,547
In a sea beyond our knowledge...

389
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,273
beyond our reach.

390
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,026
Why are you smiling?

391
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,545
It's a good omen?

392
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:25,864
It's a bad omen?

393
00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:29,631
This young man...

394
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:33,498
He has a  pleasant face.

395
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:39,323
What are you doing?

396
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:44,762
Salt, fine.
Place salt.

397
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:47,744
Do not put too much pepper.
Pepper too...

398
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,159
See yourself in the air
and keep this picture in mind.

399
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:28,818
Yours legs are like springs.
Your arms are like wings.

400
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,044
The bull's eye is upon us.

401
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:54,949
Soon we'll leave the map of the waters.

402
00:40:57,553 --> 00:40:59,290
This not filled with admiration?

403
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:05,848
Yes.

404
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:46,371
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

405
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,649
It's as if the gods ..
blind before our eyes.

406
00:41:50,412 --> 00:41:51,948
Argos, Are we ..
straight course ?

407
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:53,576
I'm doing to the best of my ability.

408
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:56,514
but without a landmark,
nor sun to guide us...

409
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:04,013
Rocks ! still left!
still left!

410
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,417
- Earth!
- Earth!

411
00:42:22,878 --> 00:42:27,623
Hercules, Equion, Orpheus, come
with me. The rest stay here.

412
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:40,067
There should be no island here.

413
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,222
Jason !

414
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:27,002
Go back to the oars!

415
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:29,635
Is Poseidon!
The god of the sea!

416
00:43:34,502 --> 00:43:35,294
Where is Jason?

417
00:43:57,797 --> 00:43:58,857
Jason!

418
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,578
Jason!

419
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,060
Jason !

420
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,764
Hold on , Equion !

421
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:47,908
Equion, hold on !

422
00:44:52,665 --> 00:44:54,241
Jason!

423
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:00,510
Where is Jason?

424
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:08,614
Stop!
We must search for Jason!

425
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,139
Get out of here!

426
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:23,760
Enough!

427
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:28,041
Enough!

428
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:32,204
Brother Poseidon...

429
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,408
our apologies.

430
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:57,221
Jason?

431
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:35,383
- The other...
Equion was lost

432
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:37,623
So ,Hercules .

433
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,001
Hercules!

434
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,377
- What have I done?
Demote yourself..

435
00:47:56,592 --> 00:47:58,464
This boy would  sleep with a prostitute...

436
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:03,404
... to honor you .
- Judge him not, by your own principles.

437
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:05,575
Watch!

438
00:48:08,374 --> 00:48:09,730
The mast is bent.

439
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:14,244
Front boards touch the line
which means water line.. ,
which means the fund is rising .

440
00:48:15,512 --> 00:48:18,826
And that's not all.
They are also splintering .

441
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,144
And, sir...

442
00:48:22,455 --> 00:48:23,822
We have lost the map.

443
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:54,772
To the oars!

444
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,871
Let's lower the sail!

445
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:12,169
Tie! Tie!

446
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,305
Hold tight!

447
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:16,994
Put down the candle!

448
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:23,163
Remem full force!

449
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:48,993
Is bad.
It is Very  bad.

450
00:49:50,967 --> 00:49:52,283
The boat is destroyed, Jason.

451
00:49:53,762 --> 00:49:55,597
Let's find wood.
We will make the repairs.

452
00:49:56,463 --> 00:49:57,686
We haven't got the tools.

453
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:02,537
What about our hunting party?

454
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:06,143
Nothing like fresh roast venison
to cherish ....

455
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,977
Soldiers.
Soldiers!

456
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:25,845
Form a phalanx!

457
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:28,023
Come on!

458
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:44,688
Wait!

459
00:50:57,217 --> 00:50:58,133
Zetes?

460
00:51:00,514 --> 00:51:01,674
Are all women?

461
00:51:07,824 --> 00:51:09,098
All women.

462
00:51:09,386 --> 00:51:11,320
Welcome to Lemnos.

463
00:51:17,635 --> 00:51:19,817
Majesty, Prince Jason.

464
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,399
Our Queen, Hipsípile.

465
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,850
Welcome.

466
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,982
I understand that you
require some our materials?

467
00:51:31,419 --> 00:51:34,499
Only a few things.
A little wood...

468
00:51:35,286 --> 00:51:37,614
... and cloth for sailing.
- Of course.

469
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:39,560
You are welcome .

470
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,325
My gratitude Majesty.

471
00:51:48,278 --> 00:51:50,549
This is how a garden
is more beautiful, is not it?

472
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,070
A garden...

473
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:57,085
should be the wild...

474
00:51:59,257 --> 00:52:00,350
should be fertile.

475
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:05,988
We feel the force
creating it.

476
00:52:10,671 --> 00:52:11,754
We will drink wine...

477
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:15,026
made from my own vines.

478
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,241
Young and strong.

479
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,902
You can feel the earth it...

480
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:28,373
Taste of their wealth.

481
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:39,066
In my room working, I
to hunt the boar Eurimanto.

482
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:43,816
Imagine a boar.
It's huge, hairy...

483
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:45,863
hateful.

484
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,128
- It is Pollux.
- It is Castor.

485
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:52,897
We are simple people.

486
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,802
He's foreman,
I am stone sculptor.

487
00:52:56,094 --> 00:52:57,339
Stones Carver?

488
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,577
- Where are all the men?
- Fighting.

489
00:53:06,362 --> 00:53:10,389
- Really? Against whom?
- Been so long that I have forgotten.

490
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:15,927
Please.

491
00:53:17,515 --> 00:53:18,626
Where is Jason?

492
00:53:23,956 --> 00:53:25,300
Why are not you with the others?

493
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:31,602
The other men
seem to havetheir senses.

494
00:53:33,715 --> 00:53:36,733
- But you...
- I have an advantage.

495
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:40,233
- My senses are numb.
- Why?

496
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:47,221
I had a love.

497
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,224
Eurydice...

498
00:53:51,954 --> 00:53:55,170
whose laughter was as soft as the rain...

499
00:53:55,322 --> 00:53:58,999
and eyes as bright as the sky

500
00:54:01,063 --> 00:54:02,573
I lost her ...

501
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:05,415
to death.

502
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:12,029
To lose her was like losing a
universe.

503
00:54:13,997 --> 00:54:19,688
If the Fleece can grant a man's desire,
It will make it  me  another chance.

504
00:54:21,683 --> 00:54:25,829
Perhaps to love what
can not be yours is a wound...

505
00:54:25,936 --> 00:54:28,734
that only death can heal.

506
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:54,468
I'm done, Argos.

507
00:54:59,478 --> 00:55:00,586
Excellent.

508
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:03,810
Excellent.

509
00:55:53,093 --> 00:55:55,362
Let's see what the future holds.

510
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:03,686
What do you say?

511
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,725
I suggest you be the king.

512
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:18,965
What is this?

513
00:56:22,357 --> 00:56:23,371
Nothing.

514
00:56:31,002 --> 00:56:31,917
Nothing?

515
00:56:35,164 --> 00:56:36,405
He said "nothing"?

516
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,765
It seems that you have been...
forgotten.

517
00:57:02,581 --> 00:57:05,436
Oh most beloved goddess ...

518
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:11,600
Here are and accept the coming sacrifice.

519
00:57:14,577 --> 00:57:17,798
A sacrifice of men!

520
00:57:45,801 --> 00:57:47,641
Tonight, we  feast.

521
00:57:48,671 --> 00:57:50,366
Tonight , we  enjoy !

522
00:57:50,648 --> 00:57:51,851
For it is my wish ...

523
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,774
that every man of the Argo...

524
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,252
take a wife  from my people.

525
00:58:01,207 --> 00:58:03,214
I would make you princess of this island...

526
00:58:05,252 --> 00:58:06,396
And your leader...

527
00:58:07,165 --> 00:58:08,301
king!

528
00:58:12,548 --> 00:58:14,470
Let us go to the temple tonight...

529
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,597
and celebrate the promise...

530
00:58:18,481 --> 00:58:20,009
of eternal happiness.

531
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:23,211
Jason!

532
00:58:24,662 --> 00:58:27,888
Jason! It's a trap.
They are going to kill you .

533
00:58:29,137 --> 00:58:31,635
I had been to the temple .
I know what they are planning.

534
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,651
A sacrifice of men!

535
00:58:40,323 --> 00:58:43,035
fools!
Don't you see here ?

536
00:58:43,756 --> 00:58:46,685
Men also not there .
're Dead!

537
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:50,775
Look!
This is their armor!

538
00:58:59,017 --> 00:59:02,460
- Absurd .
- Why she is saying such ridiculous things?

539
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:05,872
She loves you.

540
00:59:07,273 --> 00:59:09,427
She loves you and wants
you to make her own .

541
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:16,888
Do not let the envy of it
erode our love.

542
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,253
Remove her !

543
00:59:24,345 --> 00:59:25,421
Jason!

544
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:28,824
No, wait!
Wait.

545
00:59:31,994 --> 00:59:33,561
This is not the purpose of our voyage

546
00:59:34,163 --> 00:59:36,795
What you'll find in your voyage
that you can not find here ?

547
00:59:37,535 --> 00:59:39,678
I promise you infinite happiness.

548
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:47,301
Perhaps we should go back to the boat.

549
01:00:09,698 --> 01:00:10,956
Run!

550
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:23,447
What are your orders, sir?

551
01:01:24,787 --> 01:01:25,681
You decide.

552
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,922
I am not the captain.

553
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:33,716
The boat is almost sinking.

554
01:01:35,768 --> 01:01:36,999
We are lost.

555
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,210
We have no food...

556
01:01:41,092 --> 01:01:42,227
water.

557
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:47,270
I do not know what to do.

558
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:51,602
There are two dozen men here
who trusted you...

559
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:54,962
and Ever Trust
to show leadership.

560
01:01:55,897 --> 01:01:57,662
Forget you own troubles...

561
01:01:58,736 --> 01:02:00,751
Remember ,
you are the son of a king...

562
01:02:01,257 --> 01:02:03,163
Dam well !
Do your duty.

563
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:14,589
Hera...

564
01:02:19,008 --> 01:02:20,091
I ask you...

565
01:02:22,085 --> 01:02:25,212
please show me a sign.

566
01:02:26,093 --> 01:02:27,633
Any thing .

567
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:45,801
It comes with a purpose
in his heart.

568
01:02:57,249 --> 01:02:59,148
Is the Fleece that attracts.

569
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:02,494
The Fleece.

570
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:06,405
The Fleece?

571
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:39,287
Fight like a woman general.

572
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:45,224
Where is your thirst for battle?

573
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:47,554
Pehaps you'd relieve him from his command?

574
01:03:51,122 --> 01:03:55,021
Father, I must speak with you urgently.

575
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:58,664
- It is concerned with our security.
- After.

576
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,618
It concerns the Fleece.

577
01:04:12,914 --> 01:04:15,968
Where is this young man
with pleasant face?

578
01:04:16,663 --> 01:04:18,794
Closer than you have been told .

579
01:04:22,357 --> 01:04:24,825
search your course
toward the unknown sea.

580
01:04:29,214 --> 01:04:31,181
I'll find him for you , Father.

581
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,064
And I will destroy him.

582
01:05:00,412 --> 01:05:01,445
Boar with honey sauce.

583
01:05:02,182 --> 01:05:03,075
With onions.

584
01:05:03,888 --> 01:05:05,240
A little salt, tarragon.

585
01:05:06,642 --> 01:05:08,946
-  perhaps be fried onions.
- My God!

586
01:05:11,162 --> 01:05:11,890
- Castor.
- What?

587
01:05:12,921 --> 01:05:16,154
- I'm hungry.
- Me too. Its you too ...

588
01:05:16,758 --> 01:05:18,519
onions!

589
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,423
And, everybody row!

590
01:05:49,731 --> 01:05:51,252
If we don't row , we  die!

591
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:54,722
Would not mind rowing
we actually knew where we're going.

592
01:05:54,822 --> 01:05:57,792
It is what we choose.
We none of us  prisoners.

593
01:06:00,383 --> 01:06:02,032
Even prisoners are fed!

594
01:06:05,618 --> 01:06:06,897
With your pardon, sir...

595
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,463
but where are we now ?

596
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:12,842
- We are in the East of Lemnos.
- Yes, but where is it?

597
01:06:14,245 --> 01:06:16,785
We seek Fineas in Mesa Island.

598
01:06:17,254 --> 01:06:19,285
Forgive me for asking sir,

599
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:21,204
but how do we find this island...

600
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,266
since we have no map?

601
01:06:23,466 --> 01:06:25,009
Its function is to paddle,
not ask questions!

602
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:26,549
I do not mind rowing...

603
01:06:26,845 --> 01:06:29,341
If it is to go somewhere.

604
01:06:32,383 --> 01:06:34,964
- Do we know where we're going, sir?
- This is mad.

605
01:06:35,392 --> 01:06:36,558
We should turn back.

606
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:38,720
Before we starve to die !

607
01:06:52,647 --> 01:06:53,848
Zetes!

608
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,870
- Sir !
- I need to see the stars!

609
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:02,347
I remember from the map...

610
01:07:04,284 --> 01:07:06,668
the island lies just
under the place in the heavens ...

611
01:07:07,048 --> 01:07:08,879
with the dog
we will search of the archer.

612
01:07:09,884 --> 01:07:11,905
Show me where it is,
get there by night before.

613
01:07:14,985 --> 01:07:17,155
if not, we shall turn back .

614
01:07:20,592 --> 01:07:24,892
But, sir, It is  day light.
How should I see the Heavens?

615
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:28,944
Have faith in your strength.

616
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:44,104
Yes!

617
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:47,151
Yes, I see them!
I do!

618
01:07:47,346 --> 01:07:49,179
Draw for me!
Draw what you see!

619
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:09,494
This way!

620
01:08:11,496 --> 01:08:13,289
Argonauts, get your oars!

621
01:08:13,952 --> 01:08:16,314
We will see this way to land !
I'm sure of it !

622
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:19,698
To the oars!
To the oars!

623
01:08:32,259 --> 01:08:34,567
Land!
I see the land !

624
01:08:37,931 --> 01:08:40,071
It is an island!
Chata, made a tabletop.

625
01:08:42,345 --> 01:08:44,467
Well done , young master.

626
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:54,087
Split and look for
Fineas in different directions.

627
01:09:01,497 --> 01:09:03,599
We need food,
not prophets.

628
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:03,086
Help!

629
01:10:06,204 --> 01:10:07,351
Help!

630
01:10:08,426 --> 01:10:09,096
Help!

631
01:10:34,233 --> 01:10:35,900
Lord! Lord!

632
01:10:36,114 --> 01:10:38,646
Demons! Demons!
Demons type...

633
01:10:39,733 --> 01:10:41,409
We saw food, sir.
In the temple.

634
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,531
- Easy, one at a time. Fano?
- Sir, there is a temple up there.

635
01:10:46,593 --> 01:10:47,735
There's food in it.

636
01:10:48,446 --> 01:10:51,845
There are also creatures that devoured
Butes and Tífis!

637
01:10:52,462 --> 01:10:53,890
We must leave this place !

638
01:10:55,443 --> 01:10:57,428
We can not leave
We must find Fineas.

639
01:10:57,923 --> 01:11:01,207
Indeed !
You have to find him .

640
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,906
Here is ..Jason's lolcus...

641
01:11:05,383 --> 01:11:08,743
... I am Fineas.
- How do you know who I am?

642
01:11:09,443 --> 01:11:12,504
I am a seer
My gift is great.

643
01:11:13,597 --> 01:11:15,971
I know what you are seeking , young man.

644
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,638
So you can help us?

645
01:11:19,281 --> 01:11:24,065
I have been 40 years on this island,
exiled by the gods.

646
01:11:25,126 --> 01:11:28,664
In their jealousy of my gifts,
they tore my eyes.

647
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,975
And, for good measure, they placed me here...

648
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,767
to be tormented by hunger and Harpies.

649
01:11:36,061 --> 01:11:36,897
Harpies?

650
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:41,277
Monsters.
They are part of my torment.

651
01:11:41,806 --> 01:11:44,741
The other part is hunger.
Perpetual hunger.

652
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:49,868
A full table of food every day...

653
01:11:50,589 --> 01:11:53,753
but to touch it, it is death.

654
01:11:54,862 --> 01:11:56,825
Can you show the way for the Golden Fleece?

655
01:11:59,473 --> 01:12:03,950
I can put you in the right direction...

656
01:12:05,536 --> 01:12:08,404
for the price of a small favor.

657
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:02,768
The Fleece is in Colchis...

658
01:15:04,859 --> 01:15:06,506
kingdom of Aertes.

659
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:09,346
What do you know of him?

660
01:15:10,827 --> 01:15:14,092
It is a merciless tyrant...

661
01:15:15,332 --> 01:15:19,526
His daughter, Medea, is a sorceress
has powers to protect him.

662
01:15:20,043 --> 01:15:21,809
She is the guardian of the Fleece.

663
01:15:24,226 --> 01:15:25,758
How do we find Colchis?

664
01:15:27,807 --> 01:15:28,989
My young man ...

665
01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:32,604
You must enter the Eastern Ocean.

666
01:15:33,374 --> 01:15:35,267
And there's but one way...

667
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,147
through the dark rocks.

668
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,962
Doomed, all
who have gone before you.

669
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,735
Man overboard!

670
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,817
The boat is sunk.

671
01:17:02,505 --> 01:17:04,797
The crew drowned.

672
01:17:06,574 --> 01:17:09,933
I see bodies.
crushed...

673
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:13,104
and sucked down.

674
01:17:13,403 --> 01:17:14,689
Is your brother  dead?

675
01:17:18,923 --> 01:17:19,774
No !

676
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:23,784
He is .
He is saved.

677
01:17:26,182 --> 01:17:29,409
He is saved by one of
which are loved by the gods.

678
01:17:33,046 --> 01:17:37,302
It is he,who desires
the Golden Fleece.

679
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:56,414
Rocks...

680
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,052
sank my ship.

681
01:18:05,344 --> 01:18:08,969
We spent among them.
They came together...

682
01:18:10,502 --> 01:18:12,045
and crushed my ship .

683
01:18:13,025 --> 01:18:17,271
crushed my ship with me
the bow without any warning.

684
01:18:19,584 --> 01:18:23,295
No one warned me.
How would I know?

685
01:18:24,726 --> 01:18:27,386
I'm Jason, Prince of lolcus.

686
01:18:28,688 --> 01:18:30,987
Apsirto of Colchis.

687
01:18:31,414 --> 01:18:32,256
Colchis?

688
01:18:33,224 --> 01:18:34,379
That's where we're going.

689
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,171
You are !

690
01:18:39,922 --> 01:18:41,352
Then I may be able to help you.

691
01:18:41,767 --> 01:18:43,380
My father is the ruler of Colchis.

692
01:18:44,537 --> 01:18:46,712
I believe,he will receive you well.

693
01:18:49,421 --> 01:18:50,852
First, however...

694
01:18:51,362 --> 01:18:54,999
we must find a route that takes us  safely there.

695
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,046
Do You know any?

696
01:18:56,859 --> 01:18:57,586
No

697
01:18:59,663 --> 01:19:02,777
But I do know to go through
these rocks is certain death.

698
01:19:19,995 --> 01:19:20,678
Orpheus...

699
01:19:22,121 --> 01:19:24,549
... we need your dove.
- Why?

700
01:19:29,822 --> 01:19:33,161
Fly through , little friend.
May the Gods guide you .

701
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:22,833
Row !

702
01:20:28,976 --> 01:20:30,752
rowing sound !

703
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:33,018
rowing sound !

704
01:20:33,867 --> 01:20:35,295
rowing sound !

705
01:20:35,986 --> 01:20:37,616
rowing sound !

706
01:20:38,358 --> 01:20:39,934
rowing sound !

707
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:00,979
This is  death!
death!

708
01:21:18,501 --> 01:21:21,141
A great darkness.
I see nothing.

709
01:21:24,456 --> 01:21:25,758
And the ship?

710
01:21:28,076 --> 01:21:29,810
There is no ship.
It is gone.

711
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:33,358
I see only reckage ...

712
01:21:34,244 --> 01:21:35,348
darkness.

713
01:21:39,426 --> 01:21:40,953
The ship is lost.

714
01:22:37,668 --> 01:22:39,773
Lost?
Indeed.

715
01:22:49,223 --> 01:22:49,603
Killer!

716
01:22:51,562 --> 01:22:52,811
You are the Killer!

717
01:25:04,932 --> 01:25:09,775
Eros, god of love,
I give you a task.

718
01:25:09,793 --> 01:25:13,638
Find the princess Medea.
Shoot your arrow...

719
01:25:14,344 --> 01:25:17,051
so she delivered
the heart to Jason...

720
01:25:17,977 --> 01:25:19,151
Prince of lolcus.

721
01:25:19,707 --> 01:25:22,036
Jason?
But, lady...

722
01:25:22,904 --> 01:25:25,565
- It's my wish.
- But why?

723
01:25:44,966 --> 01:25:46,131
What was he doing here?

724
01:25:54,848 --> 01:25:56,274
Hold them up !

725
01:25:58,583 --> 01:25:59,290
Hold them up !

726
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:11,953
These men are armed
and prepared for war.

727
01:26:12,311 --> 01:26:16,397
It is an honor guard,
to honor the guests .

728
01:26:17,353 --> 01:26:18,073
Earth!

729
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:24,840
Sir, with this gentleman
be aware.

730
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:27,032
- Why?
- His tongue seems very sharp.

731
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,725
I am going to the shore.
I have to take two men.

732
01:26:30,412 --> 01:26:32,517
- I am going with you.
- No, Hercules.

733
01:26:34,686 --> 01:26:37,377
- You'll be watching the boat.
- My place is at you side.

734
01:26:39,478 --> 01:26:40,739
You may stay better  here.

735
01:26:41,093 --> 01:26:43,276
If things are in mess,
you're my only saver.

736
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:46,403
I would go with you, to protect you  , sir.

737
01:26:47,052 --> 01:26:47,949
And I will come with you.

738
01:26:48,264 --> 01:26:50,185
I will go down with our host,
Prince Apsirto.

739
01:26:50,823 --> 01:26:52,017
Hercules will be my lieutenant.

740
01:26:52,356 --> 01:26:54,016
Follow his orders
as if are mine.

741
01:26:59,012 --> 01:27:00,578
Come on! Come on!

742
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,064
Apparently, I am indebted
with you, young prince.

743
01:27:37,629 --> 01:27:40,600
It is our custom to pay our debts
in kind...

744
01:27:41,184 --> 01:27:43,907
no gifts..but there is this
that equals the firstborn.

745
01:27:46,988 --> 01:27:50,328
Sir, you do have in your domain
a treasure that would be dearer to me.

746
01:27:50,537 --> 01:27:53,538
What a treasure would be so dear!
Son!

747
01:27:53,738 --> 01:27:54,712
The Golden Fleece.

748
01:28:00,222 --> 01:28:02,470
sir, we have come in peace.

749
01:28:03,065 --> 01:28:05,627
No,
they came to rob me and you should pay.

750
01:28:07,058 --> 01:28:10,682
Father, remember that
you are indebted to him.

751
01:28:10,971 --> 01:28:13,234
Killing him now
may anger  the gods.

752
01:28:15,856 --> 01:28:18,263
Let the gods decide his fate.

753
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:22,940
Give him a task that
no mortal can complete.

754
01:28:23,905 --> 01:28:27,595
Yes, my daughter. It should
face Minnean bull.

755
01:28:29,573 --> 01:28:31,423
You will harness the reins
Minnean bull...

756
01:28:33,345 --> 01:28:36,295
Plow the field Ares
and sow the dragon's teeth.

757
01:28:36,704 --> 01:28:40,540
If you live, I'll know that the god's
faith in you, and you will have...

758
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:42,678
The Golden Fleece.

759
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:58,127
- Can not sleep?
- No

760
01:28:59,979 --> 01:29:00,658
Neither I am..

761
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:03,250
I'm concerned.

762
01:29:04,777 --> 01:29:05,877
Really?

763
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:08,576
.. knows about a robber.

764
01:29:08,848 --> 01:29:10,288
I  myself  a robber you see!

765
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,297
- Only walk the thieves company.
- You never stop talking?

766
01:29:18,717 --> 01:29:19,466
Look here ...

767
01:29:22,241 --> 01:29:23,281
I have something for you.

768
01:29:24,864 --> 01:29:26,753
- Feathers.
- To his arrows.

769
01:29:27,868 --> 01:29:28,978
I thought would be useful.

770
01:29:34,218 --> 01:29:35,699
But he could not see them?

771
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,174
There were not "revealed" to you?

772
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:46,050
How could you not see the rocks ?

773
01:29:47,442 --> 01:29:51,290
Do you think,had I been aware
and would not have told you

774
01:29:52,915 --> 01:29:53,698
I do not know.

775
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:56,552
Far as I know...

776
01:30:02,419 --> 01:30:03,927
As far as I know, you did see them.

777
01:30:07,421 --> 01:30:08,984
You did see them , did not you?

778
01:30:10,544 --> 01:30:11,495
Did not you see?

779
01:30:13,842 --> 01:30:16,366
And father stopped you
in telling me, right?

780
01:30:16,921 --> 01:30:17,657
No

781
01:30:19,938 --> 01:30:22,278
- It was not that.
- I should not be surprised.

782
01:30:23,897 --> 01:30:26,413
I should br suprised if it is told a trick...

783
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:29,940
some plan...

784
01:30:31,995 --> 01:30:34,350
some excuse to get rid of me.

785
01:30:36,169 --> 01:30:39,102
Here, chew it.
Will calm him down.

786
01:31:12,936 --> 01:31:13,716
Give me another one .

787
01:31:14,819 --> 01:31:16,209
Do not overdo it.

788
01:31:25,103 --> 01:31:26,419
This herb has a good effect.

789
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:28,626
Should be used wisely.

790
01:31:40,045 --> 01:31:44,046
I brought this oil.
It will protect you against the bull.

791
01:31:46,514 --> 01:31:47,879
Its breath is fire.

792
01:31:51,204 --> 01:31:52,278
Why do you want to save me?

793
01:31:54,419 --> 01:31:55,883
Please take your tunic.

794
01:31:56,503 --> 01:31:58,881
The oil should cover
every inch of your body.

795
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:02,808
Quick.

796
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:18,236
It smells sweet.

797
01:32:22,723 --> 01:32:24,718
It Comes from  Caucasian croco...

798
01:32:27,491 --> 01:32:28,854
a plant  of saffron colour.

799
01:32:31,954 --> 01:32:34,188
The first plant was born
Blood Prometheus tortured.

800
01:33:42,177 --> 01:33:43,143
Open up!

801
01:34:08,229 --> 01:34:09,628
Pull the chains!

802
01:35:22,105 --> 01:35:23,398
No!

803
01:35:35,649 --> 01:35:36,481
This!

804
01:36:03,042 --> 01:36:06,070
My legs are springs.
My arms are wings.

805
01:38:10,295 --> 01:38:11,971
- I am going to the show.
- I get along.

806
01:38:12,144 --> 01:38:17,261
No. our orders are clear.
We stand ...

807
01:39:21,918 --> 01:39:26,662
Aertes, I showed myself worthy .
Will you keep your word?

808
01:39:27,925 --> 01:39:33,256
Jason,  what you sow
you must reap

809
01:41:00,224 --> 01:41:02,821
Jason!
Yes!

810
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,213
Jason! Jason!

811
01:41:11,872 --> 01:41:14,846
Jason! Jason!

812
01:41:15,155 --> 01:41:18,395
Jason! Jason!

813
01:41:19,227 --> 01:41:21,794
Jason! Jason!

814
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:25,279
Jason! Jason!

815
01:41:25,904 --> 01:41:28,497
Jason! Jason!

816
01:41:29,104 --> 01:41:31,965
Jason! Jason!

817
01:41:54,089 --> 01:41:57,923
Jason, you have done
what no man before you could.

818
01:41:58,727 --> 01:42:00,122
I salute you .

819
01:42:01,003 --> 01:42:05,214
We shall have a feast.
You're a hero.

820
01:42:05,565 --> 01:42:10,367
Favored by the gods,
with courage beyond imagination.

821
01:42:10,734 --> 01:42:13,898
Welcome, great prince.

822
01:42:13,998 --> 01:42:17,008
You shall have what you most
desire

823
01:42:26,321 --> 01:42:27,285
This chicken has a little salt.

824
01:42:27,854 --> 01:42:30,244
Also onion!
Fried onion.

825
01:42:30,834 --> 01:42:31,774
And tarragon.

826
01:42:33,303 --> 01:42:35,481
Does anyone have honey sauce?

827
01:42:41,524 --> 01:42:43,121
Lovely ,isn't it?

828
01:42:44,107 --> 01:42:45,311
I do Majesty.

829
01:42:45,595 --> 01:42:48,049
A trophy from Liciana campaign.

830
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,238
But there is no prize
greater than the Fleece.

831
01:42:53,809 --> 01:42:56,779
I was younger than you when
I led my army to win it.

832
01:42:57,457 --> 01:43:00,143
Once held,
I recognize its power.

833
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:03,742
The Fleece keeps
State and loyalty

834
01:43:04,151 --> 01:43:08,804
When I asked my Mother to give
their sons' life, they granted ..
of the Fleece.

835
01:43:09,379 --> 01:43:12,818
When I ask my generals
to fight to the last...

836
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:15,515
they do, because
own the Fleece.

837
01:43:15,628 --> 01:43:19,090
My enemies scrarcely raise the sword to me.

838
01:43:19,985 --> 01:43:22,335
It has granted my heart's desire.

839
01:43:33,183 --> 01:43:36,075
My daughter is very beautiful,

840
01:43:36,994 --> 01:43:38,520

842
01:43:46,957 --> 01:43:48,462

01:44:01,785 --> 01:44:03,350
I would say "yes."

847
01:44:05,564 --> 01:44:07,896
Good , let us set up .

848
01:44:11,765 --> 01:44:13,222
Noble men of Colchis !

849
01:44:13,398 --> 01:44:17,725
There use to be a union between
the home lolcus and Colchis house

850
01:44:18,017 --> 01:44:19,714
Jason, Prince hero...

851
01:44:20,526 --> 01:44:24,065
will marry Medea,
our princess.

852
01:44:28,701 --> 01:44:30,863
- But, Your Majesty...
- There is no need to thank me.

853
01:44:31,243 --> 01:44:35,455
Ofcourse,You inderstand that neither you nor
the Fleece can leave Colchis.

854
01:44:36,628 --> 01:44:38,470
I am sure you will be very happy here.

855
01:44:49,786 --> 01:44:50,615
Satisfied?

856
01:44:55,347 --> 01:44:56,416
With what?

857
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,526
- Her new husband.
- Apsirto.

858
01:45:04,724 --> 01:45:06,686
So, I was right .

859
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:09,856
You are in league with our father.

860
01:45:15,693 --> 01:45:16,804
No

861
01:45:18,644 --> 01:45:20,444
I love Jason.

862
01:45:25,271 --> 01:45:27,737
It's all very clear now.

863
01:45:28,985 --> 01:45:30,322
So clear.

864
01:45:35,072 --> 01:45:36,376
How can you love him ?

865
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:40,407
You do not know.

866
01:45:44,744 --> 01:45:46,006
I know you.

867
01:45:51,091 --> 01:45:53,993
I do not mean to hurt you.

868
01:45:57,749 --> 01:45:58,964
But it hurts.

869
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:15,712
He wants to marry her,
with the princess Medea.

870
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:19,190
He wants to marry her,
with the princess Medea.

871
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:24,546
No
Jason never stay here.

872
01:46:25,484 --> 01:46:27,758
It does not send us away
saying nothing.

873
01:46:27,837 --> 01:46:29,234
He will never abandon us.

874
01:46:29,405 --> 01:46:33,288
May be our quest is finished
and it is here that we must part.

875
01:46:34,512 --> 01:46:36,132
Can you believe it?

876
01:46:37,345 --> 01:46:40,197
Jason surrendered himself to Colchis...

877
01:46:41,627 --> 01:46:44,733
... and this princess?
- She is very beautiful.

878
01:46:44,991 --> 01:46:47,896
Actually, she is very beautiful.

879
01:46:49,376 --> 01:46:52,980
You fools! They lost faith?

880
01:46:53,231 --> 01:46:55,491
I do not think Jason
abandon us...

881
01:46:57,255 --> 01:46:58,900
he would forfiet his quest...

882
01:46:59,867 --> 01:47:03,396
What does she means to him ?
What does she means to us ? ...

883
01:47:05,207 --> 01:47:07,662
And without Atalanta!
We must .... rescue  him.

884
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:12,229
From what?
Of great wealth? Power?

885
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:15,194
- The woman he loves?
- He does not love her!

886
01:47:16,271 --> 01:47:17,344
How do you know?

887
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:23,536
Look, I'm just saying,
if that's his wish ...

888
01:47:23,867 --> 01:47:27,708
... we should respect it and go.
- I agree.

889
01:47:31,943 --> 01:47:33,516
Simply go back?

890
01:47:33,984 --> 01:47:37,257
We have travelled far,
to the ends of the earth.

891
01:47:37,943 --> 01:47:39,271
What more can we achieve?

892
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:42,408
We were asked
to get the Fleece.

893
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:45,614
Our mission is incomplete.

894
01:47:46,185 --> 01:47:50,822
But our mission was to follow Jason,
and he wants us to go.

895
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:57,346
- I think we should go.
- No, Hercules!

896
01:47:58,028 --> 01:48:00,296
- Have them stay!
- I can not.

897
01:48:01,043 --> 01:48:02,982
It is between each man
and his consciousness.

898
01:48:03,162 --> 01:48:04,034
Consciousness?

899
01:48:05,752 --> 01:48:07,640
This word has meaning
to any of you?

900
01:48:17,616 --> 01:48:18,964
We will put  it to the vote.

901
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,005
Jason,this will soothe your wounds.

902
01:48:39,031 --> 01:48:43,525
Why doyou wish to help ?
You, the guardian of the Fleece.

903
01:48:45,978 --> 01:48:49,779
The Fleece will  only give its true
powers who really deserve.

904
01:48:51,416 --> 01:48:54,096
It is for them to guard its secrets.

905
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,604
Worthy or not,
I find it.

906
01:48:59,009 --> 01:49:00,942
My mother's life depends on it.

907
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:08,334
So you should know
I can not be a party from it.

908
01:49:19,532 --> 01:49:21,819
Treason! Treason!

909
01:49:23,809 --> 01:49:26,911
Treason ! Your beloved ..

910
01:49:28,658 --> 01:49:30,999
your trustee ...

911
01:49:32,766 --> 01:49:36,377
of the future ruler

912
01:49:36,707 --> 01:49:41,009
- What is your reason for coming here, Apsirto?
- The Fleece.

913
01:49:42,132 --> 01:49:43,560
The Fleece.

914
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:48,511
They want to take it away from us.
Tonight.

915
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:50,652
Tell me everything you know.

916
01:49:58,469 --> 01:50:00,447
My lady Medea...

917
01:50:02,114 --> 01:50:03,353
and Jason.

918
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,657
Mancomunados.

919
01:50:09,986 --> 01:50:11,951
She will take him to the Fleece...

920
01:50:12,467 --> 01:50:15,893
and he will steal it and take it to his boat.

921
01:50:16,533 --> 01:50:17,981
I heard his move.

922
01:50:18,897 --> 01:50:23,243
I heard from the back door while they were making love
and matched his betrayal.

923
01:50:23,436 --> 01:50:24,867
you were Drunk, my son.

924
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:31,215
Do not act like a fool.

925
01:50:33,743 --> 01:50:35,190
Tonight father...

926
01:50:37,212 --> 01:50:39,334
It is you who are the fool !

927
01:50:41,029 --> 01:50:44,070
Jason can walk on water? Look.

928
01:50:47,435 --> 01:50:50,088
He stays
His crew abandoned.

929
01:50:50,574 --> 01:50:55,272
You should leave such matters to
who is with the coolest head.

930
01:51:06,201 --> 01:51:08,878
Attention!
Lift camp!

931
01:51:15,561 --> 01:51:17,343
Let's return to the palace!

932
01:51:17,898 --> 01:51:19,838
Come on! Come on!

933
01:51:23,187 --> 01:51:24,247
Stay together!

934
01:52:10,126 --> 01:52:11,066
Jason!

935
01:52:44,564 --> 01:52:49,037
sir, bidding farewell to your countrymen, Prince

936
01:52:49,433 --> 01:52:51,709
... will make the best of the things.

937
01:52:52,609 --> 01:52:55,249
Ruling in my state,  perhaps ,
you are thinking ?

938
01:52:55,431 --> 01:52:57,960
That was never my desire
not my intention.

939
01:52:58,348 --> 01:53:02,138
May be not yours, but certainly
my father's. Kill him.

940
01:53:30,879 --> 01:53:32,149
Attack!

941
01:53:37,352 --> 01:53:38,398
Attack!

942
01:54:06,198 --> 01:54:07,834
Argo is north of here, sir.

943
01:54:09,451 --> 01:54:11,575
Quick, sir.
Soon we will be discovered.

944
01:54:28,788 --> 01:54:34,205
My task was to free the man,
eating birds of the marshes.

945
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,544
These birds,
sent by Aries...

946
01:54:36,858 --> 01:54:41,997
ahowere over men
their feathers and their lethal droppings.

947
01:54:42,882 --> 01:54:47,443
Predictably,
I once again, saved the day.

948
01:54:59,212 --> 01:55:01,306
- Let's go down.
- It will take a lot.

949
01:55:01,482 --> 01:55:03,472
Their archers will hit us like flies.

950
01:55:03,764 --> 01:55:06,206
Cavalry, a mile away!

951
01:55:07,903 --> 01:55:11,277
Let's fight them.
We will fight them to the last...!

952
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:12,753
No need for that .

953
01:55:13,984 --> 01:55:15,481
- Hercules.
- Jason.

954
01:55:15,952 --> 01:55:18,051
I'm going to hold the enemy
while you escape.

955
01:55:20,528 --> 01:55:23,313
Head to the Argo.
It is at the mouth of the river.

956
01:55:24,536 --> 01:55:27,155
- I see it .
- you Can climb down.

957
01:55:29,218 --> 01:55:30,269
Where is Fleece?

958
01:55:30,415 --> 01:55:33,983
- Crossing the throat, on a plateau.
- There is no time.

959
01:55:34,147 --> 01:55:36,452
's Work for a full day
cross and climb the throat.

960
01:55:36,819 --> 01:55:38,927
You! Start climbing!

961
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:41,286
Wait.
I think there is another way.

962
01:56:07,363 --> 01:56:09,115
... you know disc throw .., Hercules?

963
01:56:35,337 --> 01:56:37,374
Laertes, show them what to do.

964
01:56:58,189 --> 01:56:59,223
Come on!

965
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:52,410
Mom!

966
01:58:57,821 --> 01:58:59,463
- Hercules!
- Go now!

967
01:58:59,612 --> 01:59:01,815
- Not without you.
- I will follow.

968
01:59:04,897 --> 01:59:05,520
Come, I'll help you.

969
01:59:06,132 --> 01:59:07,705
This is not my destiny.

970
01:59:07,943 --> 01:59:09,633
Not you face an entire army!

971
01:59:11,967 --> 01:59:15,960
Jason, my journey is dark.
That's what my mother demands.

972
01:59:16,119 --> 01:59:17,883
- Mother?
- I am Hercules...

973
01:59:18,153 --> 01:59:20,338
Servant of Hera !
commanded by  her...

974
01:59:20,896 --> 01:59:22,257
to protect you.

975
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:27,741
Go, Jason, my dear friend,
find your destiny.

976
02:00:21,970 --> 02:00:24,324
Lord, Acastus is wounded.

977
02:00:26,464 --> 02:00:28,936
I think, you go on .
I just need some rest.

978
02:00:29,106 --> 02:00:32,267
No, Take it to the side
boat. Take him to the boat.

979
02:00:32,296 --> 02:00:33,185
I'm fine.

980
02:01:30,728 --> 02:01:31,776
Get down!

981
02:02:44,999 --> 02:02:46,138
Mopsus, the rope!

982
02:02:49,579 --> 02:02:52,295
- What will you do, sir?
- A knot around his neck.

983
02:02:52,398 --> 02:02:55,964
Orpheus, you need to play.
As never played before!

984
02:02:57,253 --> 02:02:58,577
Be careful , Jason!

985
02:04:40,928 --> 02:04:42,454
Jason!

986
02:04:49,593 --> 02:04:50,741
Jason!

987
02:05:23,990 --> 02:05:25,196
No !

988
02:05:41,452 --> 02:05:42,618
Jason!

989
02:05:43,065 --> 02:05:43,991
Jason!

990
02:07:36,628 --> 02:07:40,139
Someone needs to pull the arrow.
I need someone with good hands.

991
02:07:41,472 --> 02:07:42,354
I do.

992
02:07:51,175 --> 02:07:54,341
Take out the arrow gently
and pull firmly.

993
02:07:54,874 --> 02:07:56,326
It is close to the heart.

994
02:08:14,711 --> 02:08:16,267
you have fine hands.

995
02:08:16,592 --> 02:08:18,779
perhaps you found a use for them.

996
02:08:27,747 --> 02:08:30,436
No longer lead you
a hundred victories?

997
02:08:30,917 --> 02:08:32,419
When we had the Fleece.

998
02:08:33,972 --> 02:08:36,476
Have faith in your king.

999
02:10:21,349 --> 02:10:22,685
Your Music is changed.

1000
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:27,126
You have a good ear.

1001
02:10:31,743 --> 02:10:33,844
What will the
gods are wanting?

1002
02:10:36,310 --> 02:10:38,950
Saves with a miracle
one who wants his own end...

1003
02:10:39,088 --> 02:10:41,684
die but leave those who love life.

1004
02:11:03,467 --> 02:11:05,364
- Jason...
- Yes?

1005
02:11:06,029 --> 02:11:08,143
We've been friends a long time,
are not we?

1006
02:11:08,976 --> 02:11:10,369
Best Friends.

1007
02:11:12,457 --> 02:11:15,694
- I have to ask you something.
- Anything.

1008
02:11:21,047 --> 02:11:24,375
Jason, I know you ...

1009
02:11:26,088 --> 02:11:29,166
I love you better than anyone
on this Earth.

1010
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:32,196
- And I you .
-true?

1011
02:11:32,263 --> 02:11:33,136
Of course!

1012
02:11:34,485 --> 02:11:37,903
Thank the gods!
I did not think it was the same way!

1013
02:11:38,055 --> 02:11:41,182
- How could you think such a thing?
- I thought you and Medea...

1014
02:11:42,957 --> 02:11:44,897
Medea and I will get married.

1015
02:11:45,537 --> 02:11:47,874
But you will always be so dear
to me as a sister.

1016
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:55,777
Yes
Yes, of course..

1017
02:12:07,756 --> 02:12:09,117
You love real?

1018
02:12:11,405 --> 02:12:12,785
It is written.

1019
02:12:13,556 --> 02:12:14,396
Argos?

1020
02:12:36,028 --> 02:12:37,022
What?

1021
02:12:39,846 --> 02:12:41,944
My father was murdered.

1022
02:12:43,846 --> 02:12:45,314
How can you be sure?

1023
02:12:50,135 --> 02:12:51,297
I'm sorry.

1024
02:12:55,229 --> 02:12:57,065
I too saw my father's death.

1025
02:12:58,701 --> 02:13:05,551
It is the most distant memory,
but the most vivid I have.

1026
02:13:06,051 --> 02:13:08,221
Still burning in my soul.

1027
02:13:12,294 --> 02:13:14,643
I shall Never let you feel alone.

1028
02:13:25,995 --> 02:13:27,266
Mortal love.

1029
02:13:28,985 --> 02:13:30,044
Pure...

1030
02:13:32,125 --> 02:13:33,562
incorruptible.

1031
02:13:36,437 --> 02:13:37,773
As it should be.

1032
02:13:39,772 --> 02:13:44,530
You don't fool me.
Is suffering inside, cursing his nobility.

1033
02:13:46,509 --> 02:13:48,712
And what you know about nobility?

1034
02:13:53,553 --> 02:13:54,967
I'll show you.

1035
02:14:31,614 --> 02:14:33,679
I will be kind to you.

1036
02:14:33,803 --> 02:14:34,899
Who are you?

1037
02:14:36,769 --> 02:14:38,821
I know your face, but...

1038
02:14:40,609 --> 02:14:41,924
His slave.

1039
02:14:43,897 --> 02:14:48,011
Someone who admires the distance...

1040
02:14:50,069 --> 02:14:53,277
and can not find,
even in heaven...

1041
02:14:54,535 --> 02:14:56,930
greater majesty that it
see before me.

1042
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:59,476
- You are a god?
- Certainly.

1043
02:15:00,208 --> 02:15:04,088
I am the king of the gods.
Still, I'm your slave.

1044
02:15:05,358 --> 02:15:08,729
Medea Medea Medea...

1045
02:15:09,101 --> 02:15:13,577
Medea Medea Medea...

1046
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:16,238
Medea.

1047
02:15:16,854 --> 02:15:17,881
Love Me.

1048
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:22,327
Great Zeus.
I love another man.

1049
02:15:25,672 --> 02:15:26,728
Jason.

1050
02:15:46,658 --> 02:15:48,102
A boy!

1051
02:15:48,783 --> 02:15:52,638
I am Zeus.

1052
02:15:52,816 --> 02:15:55,328
It is the inevitable.
I am...

1053
02:15:57,228 --> 02:15:59,217
irresistible.

1054
02:16:02,497 --> 02:16:07,049
I am the king never dies.

1055
02:16:07,549 --> 02:16:11,643
And you should be my queen.

1056
02:16:15,358 --> 02:16:17,484
What you want from me?

1057
02:16:19,355 --> 02:16:22,248
Lie with me.

1058
02:16:23,139 --> 02:16:25,784
No, I can not.

1059
02:16:27,066 --> 02:16:31,529
Not only my body but my soul
immortal belongs to the man I love.

1060
02:16:32,466 --> 02:16:34,673
There is no greater power.

1061
02:16:39,958 --> 02:16:42,506
You disown me?

1062
02:16:43,835 --> 02:16:45,602
For the boy?

1063
02:16:49,582 --> 02:16:54,873
I give you time to reconsider hey,
before your beauty feneça.

1064
02:17:10,491 --> 02:17:11,592
You are alright ?

1065
02:17:14,597 --> 02:17:16,172
I do not know.

1066
02:17:22,037 --> 02:17:23,766
Why are you smiling?

1067
02:17:26,432 --> 02:17:27,875
From what I'm feeling.

1068
02:17:45,304 --> 02:17:50,004
Whatever happens,
have faith in our love.

1069
02:18:28,694 --> 02:18:30,454
They embarrassed us.

1070
02:18:41,858 --> 02:18:44,094
- We arrived!
- Earth!

1071
02:19:15,427 --> 02:19:16,856
Can not be!

1072
02:19:28,105 --> 02:19:30,468
Welcome to lolcus.

1073
02:19:37,772 --> 02:19:39,469
- My son!
- Father!

1074
02:19:44,082 --> 02:19:46,421
Ai..s, it is good to see you.

1075
02:19:46,605 --> 02:19:50,096
It's a... It's a miracle!
We thought we were lost...

1076
02:19:50,471 --> 02:19:53,128
... all dead!
- Ai...s, I must ask you not to spread...

1077
02:19:53,499 --> 02:19:56,127
the news of our return.
The safety of my mother is still...

1078
02:19:56,275 --> 02:19:58,220
... my biggest concern.
- Your mother?

1079
02:19:59,657 --> 02:20:03,925
- Oh my God ! you do not know ,
- What?

1080
02:20:05,850 --> 02:20:10,505
Sir, I must tell you.
Your mother, the Queen is no more.

1081
02:20:12,951 --> 02:20:13,913
What?

1082
02:20:15,843 --> 02:20:18,369
She's dead, sir.

1083
02:20:19,805 --> 02:20:22,212
- How?
He took her life...

1084
02:20:23,038 --> 02:20:27,055
in the house of.....
that of your father.

1085
02:20:29,727 --> 02:20:30,822
I see.

1086
02:20:45,813 --> 02:20:49,987
If we fear the betrayal of Pelias,
can use the darkness against him.

1087
02:20:52,449 --> 02:20:55,866
and Wastie more lives in this endeavor

1088
02:20:58,962 --> 02:21:00,952
Then ,What is your intention?

1089
02:21:04,058 --> 02:21:07,323
My intention, brother...

1090
02:21:09,193 --> 02:21:10,555
is to drink.

1091
02:21:14,118 --> 02:21:16,888
Drink all of those should be
drinking us.

1092
02:21:19,539 --> 02:21:20,626
The Équio.

1093
02:21:24,083 --> 02:21:26,606
The Laertes, the brave athlete.

1094
02:21:28,442 --> 02:21:29,716
The Tífis...

1095
02:21:30,417 --> 02:21:31,573
the Butes...

1096
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:33,947
Fano.

1097
02:21:40,776 --> 02:21:42,588
And Hercules...

1098
02:21:44,077 --> 02:21:47,067
the mighty and magnificent.

1099
02:21:54,521 --> 02:21:57,195
Lord, they would not have died in vain
to meet your destiny.

1100
02:21:58,356 --> 02:22:01,395
You are..sir,
still the rightful king of lolcus .

1101
02:22:02,612 --> 02:22:05,405
We may still rescue  from tyranny...

1102
02:22:06,044 --> 02:22:08,483
and avenge your father's and mother's lives.

1103
02:22:08,892 --> 02:22:14,267
For what purpose?
In the first sunbeam, depart.

1104
02:22:17,591 --> 02:22:19,122
- Sir, I beg you.
- Enough!

1105
02:22:26,273 --> 02:22:27,333
Jason...

1106
02:22:30,253 --> 02:22:32,463
Not honor the dead
turning her back to life.

1107
02:22:32,868 --> 02:22:36,711
So we disappointed.

1108
02:22:48,748 --> 02:22:51,801
Come, Zetes.
It's time to go home.

1109
02:23:01,783 --> 02:23:02,852
Son?

1110
02:23:11,536 --> 02:23:12,973
Father, I can not.

1111
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:17,320
- But son...
- I can not leave my friends.

1112
02:23:40,465 --> 02:23:45,560
Look at the stars.
They will be your guide.

1113
02:23:52,652 --> 02:23:54,439
What is showing me...

1114
02:23:54,921 --> 02:23:57,668
Hercules, old friend?

1115
02:24:04,348 --> 02:24:07,298
A drink for my friend Mopsus?

1116
02:24:07,584 --> 02:24:08,381
No

1117
02:24:10,067 --> 02:24:11,731
Know I do not drink.

1118
02:24:16,741 --> 02:24:18,799
I am greatly in grief about your mother.

1119
02:24:23,469 --> 02:24:26,903
I knew her, you know?
Very well.

1120
02:24:31,247 --> 02:24:32,128
Really?

1121
02:24:35,341 --> 02:24:38,862
I admired her beauty...

1122
02:24:39,869 --> 02:24:42,101
and humiliated by its gentleness.

1123
02:24:57,339 --> 02:24:58,373
May be...

1124
02:25:03,330 --> 02:25:04,825
just one little ...

1125
02:25:08,323 --> 02:25:11,551
If not now, when ?

1126
02:25:29,531 --> 02:25:32,482
Let's drink another.
We are in need.

1127
02:26:16,982 --> 02:26:18,043
Hera...

1128
02:26:21,084 --> 02:26:23,054
Why you did not protect her?

1129
02:26:31,438 --> 02:26:32,548
Jason...

1130
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:36,933
Jason, my dear son.

1131
02:26:39,042 --> 02:26:44,452
That, for mercy of the gods,
can tell you the underworld.

1132
02:26:48,505 --> 02:26:52,724
Jason, you are not at the end of your journey,
but the beginning.

1133
02:26:54,578 --> 02:26:57,205
The path is you who chooses.

1134
02:26:58,997 --> 02:27:01,183
Go in peace, my dear.

1135
02:27:02,390 --> 02:27:04,567
Go with your mother's love ...

1136
02:27:05,647 --> 02:27:07,698
And fulfill your destiny.

1137
02:27:27,704 --> 02:27:31,480
Gone!
Gone!

1138
02:27:55,606 --> 02:27:57,311
Sir, Your son is back!

1139
02:28:45,961 --> 02:28:47,337
Let me pass.

1140
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:08,101
Welcome, my son.
I was not expecting.

1141
02:29:09,346 --> 02:29:12,520
I sailed with Jason and gained the Fleece.

1142
02:29:12,694 --> 02:29:14,086
So, I see.

1143
02:29:14,402 --> 02:29:15,941
Its power is mine.

1144
02:29:17,459 --> 02:29:19,866
I am now king.

1145
02:29:21,218 --> 02:29:22,511
Ofcourse.

1146
02:29:26,265 --> 02:29:31,419
How can I resist the power of Fleece?

1147
02:29:37,339 --> 02:29:38,664
Acastus...

1148
02:29:40,321 --> 02:29:41,261
I am...

1149
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:45,424
old and tired.

1150
02:29:46,884 --> 02:29:49,305
More tired than you can imagine.

1151
02:29:51,349 --> 02:29:52,402
But you...

1152
02:29:53,666 --> 02:29:55,795
you proved a man.

1153
02:29:57,613 --> 02:30:01,599
A better man than perhaps I thought.

1154
02:30:02,904 --> 02:30:06,876
Please
want to give you my blessing.

1155
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:10,593
Come here, son.

1156
02:30:14,397 --> 02:30:15,612
My dear son.

1157
02:30:18,375 --> 02:30:19,551
My son.

1158
02:30:21,309 --> 02:30:22,573
My son.

1159
02:30:29,053 --> 02:30:30,988
Go out to the gods,
my son.

1160
02:30:34,584 --> 02:30:37,085
Dear...

1161
02:30:38,696 --> 02:30:40,319
dear son.

1162
02:30:41,598 --> 02:30:44,192
Quick, sir.
The crowd is restless.

1163
02:30:56,561 --> 02:30:57,941
Find my nephew, Jason...

1164
02:30:58,727 --> 02:31:02,014
and all who sailed with him.
Destroy them!

1165
02:31:02,189 --> 02:31:03,365
Yes, my lord.

1166
02:31:13,172 --> 02:31:14,104
Jason!

1167
02:31:19,271 --> 02:31:21,931
Where have you been?
The Fleece is gone.

1168
02:31:22,121 --> 02:31:24,073
Acastus and Medea as well.

1169
02:31:30,962 --> 02:31:34,017
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry, it was my fault.

1170
02:31:34,117 --> 02:31:36,739
- Where is Medea?
- With Acastus , Probably.

1171
02:31:36,998 --> 02:31:38,454
Maybe that was their plan.

1172
02:31:39,116 --> 02:31:41,933
The boy betrayed us, for sure.

1173
02:31:42,236 --> 02:31:44,763
- Are you sure that Medea was with him?
- As far as we know.

1174
02:31:45,905 --> 02:31:49,064
- See how she cured him with witchcraft.
- It was not witchcraft!

1175
02:31:49,998 --> 02:31:51,366
It was mercy.

1176
02:31:53,523 --> 02:31:55,984
What is certain, sir, that is
Pelias is with the Fleece...

1177
02:31:56,733 --> 02:31:58,431
and he knows
our arrival.

1178
02:31:58,678 --> 02:31:59,971
What are the orders, sir?

1179
02:32:01,936 --> 02:32:06,122
- The Argo is ready to sail.
- Great! The faster, the better.

1180
02:32:06,317 --> 02:32:08,370
Soldiers are approaching!

1181
02:32:17,846 --> 02:32:20,874
I shall not blame men
if you stay not with me.

1182
02:32:21,670 --> 02:32:23,206
Much has demanded of you...

1183
02:32:24,446 --> 02:32:25,825
too much perhaps .

1184
02:32:27,918 --> 02:32:31,498
But I can not escape.
I must make my stay here.

1185
02:32:33,554 --> 02:32:34,705
I'm staying, sir.

1186
02:32:36,378 --> 02:32:37,279
Me too.

1187
02:32:40,166 --> 02:32:41,193
Me too.

1188
02:32:43,473 --> 02:32:44,665
Me, too too .

1189
02:32:49,252 --> 02:32:50,776
Need you ask?

1190
02:32:55,997 --> 02:32:59,762
Argos, I can not ask
you to stand against his master Pelias .

1191
02:33:03,338 --> 02:33:07,307
Jason, you are my master now .

1192
02:33:08,930 --> 02:33:13,355
Cavalry , a mile away ,
about 200 men!

1193
02:33:16,068 --> 02:33:17,315
We must hurry!

1194
02:33:17,573 --> 02:33:18,224
Sir, I must tell you ...

1195
02:33:20,511 --> 02:33:21,697
I know a way to get into the palace itself ...

1196
02:33:23,049 --> 02:33:25,153
... That would give us the effect of surprise.
- Tell me .

1197
02:33:25,573 --> 02:33:28,558
There is a tunnel, a passage
into the temple.

1198
02:33:28,760 --> 02:33:32,918
The entrance is deep in the forest,
but I believe I can locate it .

1199
02:33:33,610 --> 02:33:35,186
It is kind to us  once before ...

1200
02:33:35,866 --> 02:33:37,826
when I was captain
of the Palace Guard...

1201
02:33:38,655 --> 02:33:40,561
captain of your father, Jason.

1202
02:33:41,485 --> 02:33:44,862
I was I who took the temple
and handed Chiron.

1203
02:33:46,580 --> 02:33:49,566
Of course! The soldier!

1204
02:33:52,281 --> 02:33:53,692
I owe my life to you!

1205
02:33:54,197 --> 02:33:56,605
No, sir, do not owe me anything.

1206
02:33:57,530 --> 02:34:01,886
Just I could not save your father from danger
so, I told you  today.

1207
02:34:03,339 --> 02:34:04,493
Tell me about the tunnel.

1208
02:34:04,785 --> 02:34:09,067
The entrance is outside of the city.
Its opened by a key...

1209
02:34:09,652 --> 02:34:11,978
a key that is on the amulet
that your mother gave you.

1210
02:34:14,370 --> 02:34:17,741
I lost the amulet.
I lost in Lemnos.

1211
02:34:19,339 --> 02:34:23,181
- Without the key, it would be impossible.
- Is there no other way?

1212
02:34:23,377 --> 02:34:24,122
No

1213
02:34:29,393 --> 02:34:30,338
So, I ...

1214
02:34:36,188 --> 02:34:37,031
We can use the key.

1215
02:34:41,969 --> 02:34:45,054
I thought.
In Lemnos.

1216
02:34:50,594 --> 02:34:52,048
I was told that its a good piece .

1217
02:34:53,061 --> 02:34:56,823
- In some value.
- Worth a kingdom, I should say.

1218
02:34:59,961 --> 02:35:04,682
Swear by the gods that was
the last thing stolen in my life!

1219
02:35:07,274 --> 02:35:08,101
Lead us, Mopsus.

1220
02:35:26,445 --> 02:35:29,466
Is the kingdom for you , or for her?

1221
02:35:31,125 --> 02:35:32,410
They are same to me .

1222
02:35:56,563 --> 02:35:57,852
I am Medea...

1223
02:35:59,460 --> 02:36:01,247
daughter Edia...

1224
02:36:02,132 --> 02:36:03,814
daughter of Frixo.

1225
02:36:05,965 --> 02:36:08,711
I am of the blood of the Fleece.

1226
02:36:10,074 --> 02:36:13,397
I'm your guardian on earth,
and only through me...

1227
02:36:13,572 --> 02:36:15,856
may receive his power.

1228
02:36:16,917 --> 02:36:19,179
Why should I believe you?

1229
02:36:20,959 --> 02:36:24,792
Majesty, it is true that Edia
was a great sorceress...

1230
02:36:25,666 --> 02:36:28,742
and possessed the  powers of Healing .

1231
02:37:00,901 --> 02:37:02,494
Impressive.

1232
02:37:03,794 --> 02:37:06,216
I draw  my powers from Fleece.

1233
02:37:07,676 --> 02:37:10,036
Where is the Fleece, I will.

1234
02:37:10,461 --> 02:37:11,567
Really?

1235
02:37:13,553 --> 02:37:16,634
Why
powers are not working for me?

1236
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,491
Because I give to the Fleece my blessing .

1237
02:37:20,795 --> 02:37:25,589
Only through me and blood
of Frixo you will receive its power.

1238
02:37:26,222 --> 02:37:28,633
And what you want in return?

1239
02:37:29,229 --> 02:37:34,110
Be your wife and guardian
of the Fleece forever.

1240
02:37:34,974 --> 02:37:36,691
That is my destiny.

1241
02:38:18,268 --> 02:38:20,204
Pelias soldiers.

1242
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:28,478
Jason!

1243
02:39:39,342 --> 02:39:40,221
Argos!

1244
02:39:41,482 --> 02:39:42,392
Argos!

1245
02:39:52,587 --> 02:39:54,281
Jason, leave it !
Come on!

1246
02:41:34,293 --> 02:41:36,470
You must bathe in these waters.

1247
02:41:38,030 --> 02:41:41,139
They will release the powers of the Fleece.

1248
02:41:41,904 --> 02:41:44,639
Then you will be once more young...

1249
02:41:45,192 --> 02:41:47,332
and you would rule forever.

1250
02:41:51,385 --> 02:41:53,435
Majesty, we have no guarantee.

1251
02:41:54,263 --> 02:41:59,356
- How do we  know if the water is safe?
- You will come first.

1252
02:42:01,798 --> 02:42:02,794
Go.

1253
02:43:36,072 --> 02:43:38,059

1255
02:43:43,842 --> 02:43:46,282
Has its power revived you ?

1256
02:43:49,392 --> 02:43:51,449
Will I look like a immortal ?

1257
02:43:54,059 --> 02:43:56,034
The Fleece has no power...

1258
02:43:57,325 --> 02:44:00,921
except that
imagined by those who seek it.

1259
02:44:03,369 --> 02:44:05,081
We make our own destiny...

1260
02:44:06,050 --> 02:44:09,030
... by our own actions .
- This is trickious !

1261
02:44:14,229 --> 02:44:17,345
The only trickory lies in your imagination.

1262
02:44:17,890 --> 02:44:21,282
How many have died ,so
you may gain the Fleece?

1263
02:44:22,488 --> 02:44:24,419
and what has it brought you?

1264
02:44:25,805 --> 02:44:27,832
My sword is  in your throat...

1265
02:44:28,737 --> 02:44:31,238
and your people begging for your blood.

1266
02:44:32,684 --> 02:44:34,249
You'll kill me?

1267
02:44:46,085 --> 02:44:47,752
I am disgusted with this slaughter...

1268
02:44:49,233 --> 02:44:50,959
and touched by mercy.

1269
02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:06,193
May you never know
the disappointment of old age .

1270
02:45:07,710 --> 02:45:13,595
How my mind is mad with this Fleece.
My son is dead, my  kingdom is lost.

1271
02:45:15,349 --> 02:45:19,007
Take the Fleece and do what you want.

1272
02:45:22,889 --> 02:45:27,990
Take it with my blessing,
but have mercy on me...

1273
02:45:30,010 --> 02:45:32,055
before you meet
your destination.
