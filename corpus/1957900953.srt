0
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:05,222
Are you ready to get
your Reindeer Games on?!

1
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:16,799
Keep it together, man.

2
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,049
I don't think I can do this.

3
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,323
- Five!
- You have to do this.

4
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:20,890
- Four.
- Do I though?

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,153
- Three!
- It's now or never, Chase.

6
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:25,373
- What's it gonna be?
- Two!

7
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:26,915
Alright, is there
a trick to this madness?

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,245
One!

9
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:31,205
Just turn your brain off
and jump.

10
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:54,750
Hey!

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,149
Ready for the games, Mac?

12
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,933
Oh, I was born ready!

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,519
Hey, make sure you have
the EMTs standing by, Kyle.

14
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:07,086
We don't want to
relive the mishap of '07.

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,131
You ever gonna
let me live that down?

16
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:09,330
Oh, not a chance.

17
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:15,901
I absolutely
told you I was going home

18
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:17,816
for Christmas this year, remember?

19
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:20,143
You said you were flying
your family to you in Lake Como.

20
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,820
Different client, Teri.

21
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,494
It's me Chase,
the one with the pregnant sister

22
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:24,693
who needs help this year.

23
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:26,695
Oh. My bad. That's cray cray.

24
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,479
You totally sounded like George.

25
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:31,613
You still haven't
answered my question.

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,940
What do we need to do to
push the needle on this project?

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,445
You gotta give me
a chance, Teri.

28
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:38,968
I'm perfect for this movie.

29
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:40,622
You know it and I know it.

30
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,059
All we gotta do is
convince the director

31
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,669
and the studio as well.

32
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:46,802
Come to think of it,

33
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:48,867
I'm not sure that the writer
had you in mind either.

34
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:50,782
Well, let's just try to
make them see the light, okay?

35
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,895
You got it, killer.

36
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,157
I'll call you when I land.

37
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:55,724
Please, don't.

38
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,041
Hey, guys!

39
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,434
- Hey!
- Hey, Mac!

40
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:11,645
Make us proud this weekend!

41
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:12,741
Always!

42
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:53,999
Miss you, Pop.

43
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,140
Take the plunge.

44
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,842
Dive.

45
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:13,541
I own you Wednesday crossword.

46
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,064
Yes, I do.

47
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,852
So... Oh, yup.

48
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,725
24 across is "serendipitous."

49
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:25,727
- Ow!
- No helping!

50
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:27,903
That is a nonsense rule
that you just made up.

51
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,818
Crosswords are
supposed to be fun.

52
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:32,057
I find it very fun to finish
my crosswords by myself, Simon.

53
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,431
You're such a 32 across.

54
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:36,303
Square. Mm.

55
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,392
Well, at least
I'm not a 17 down.

56
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:39,741
Oh, I don't have that one yet.

57
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:43,484
No? Hm.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

58
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:46,095
So, how are you doing?

59
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,836
I'm good. I'm fine.

60
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,726
I'm gonna do my thing
with the Boys tomorrow.

61
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,927
So, speaking of the Boys.

62
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,016
Mm-hm.

63
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,584
Should we be focusing more
on our brains or our brawn?

64
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,063
Do not pump me for information.

65
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,456
What? Me?

66
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:01,589
I take my Emcee
position very seriously,

67
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,131
- thank you very much.
- I know, I know.

68
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:05,288
You will learn about
the events a the theme

69
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,247
for the Reindeer Games
this weekend at

70
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,572
the opening ceremonies
like everybody else.

71
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:09,814
Mm-hm.

72
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:11,686
Not that you need my help.

73
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,098
You ever gonna let someone
else take the Kris Kringle Cup?

74
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:15,298
Never!

75
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,952
I knew that.

76
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:23,698
Hey!

77
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,273
Okay.

78
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,188
Nothing yet?

79
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,800
It's been five hours.

80
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:40,018
Take a breath, brother.

81
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,716
Sorry, I'm just...

82
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,544
I will call you
when I hear something.

83
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:45,589
Focus on the good stuff.

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,915
You've gotta great thing going
with your current franchise.

85
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,159
Convention crowd
is eating you up.

86
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,856
You gotta get me
that movie, Teri.

87
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:53,747
I just cannot be
the Deathly Panic guy forever.

88
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,556
Oh yes, baby!

89
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:58,341
Wait! Wh-What happened?
Did the email come in.

90
00:04:58,428 --> 00:04:59,995
Did I get it?

91
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:00,648
No, that was something el...
That was, um...

92
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:01,842
That was for another client.

93
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:02,737
Don't you say it.

94
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:03,912
It was for Brad.

95
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:07,176
Look. Patience, brother.

96
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:10,353
Freaking Brad.

97
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:25,977
Is that Chase Weston?

98
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,327
Did he see you?

99
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,659
Glad that's in there.

100
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,339
One round left to go.

101
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,821
Who will be the Science of
Christmas Trivia champions?

102
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:30,128
Will it be
the Genome Gyroscopes?

103
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,522
Or the Mitochondrial Mesmers?

104
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,829
Can I get a drumroll please?

105
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,007
Genome Gyroscopes, you're up.

106
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,313
Okay.

107
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:43,968
We're going to take
Marine Life for 1500.

108
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,493
Bold move, Jeremy.

109
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:50,671
And the answer is the reason
aquatic animals don't freeze

110
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:51,933
solid during the winter.

111
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:00,985
What is blubber?

112
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:02,702
Blubber helps to
insulate aquatic mammals

113
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:05,207
like seals and whales
in freezing conditions,

114
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,457
but what about the animals
that only live under water?

115
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:12,127
They would freeze solid if
it weren't for this fact...

116
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:13,389
Because ice floats!

117
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,522
Nice one, Kit!

118
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:16,934
And the Mesmers have
just tied the game!

119
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,394
You know what this means.

120
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,744
Students:

121
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:23,704
Lightning round!

122
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:26,489
That's right!
It is lightning round time!

123
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:28,883
Know the answer,
yell it out! Okay, and go!

124
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:29,710
The Arctic Tundra!

125
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,668
Sucrose!

126
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:32,819
The tilt of the earth's axis
in relation to the sun!

127
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,236
Because... The speed of light!

128
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,150
Hexagonal rings!

129
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,412
Tryptophan!

130
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,109
Coal!

131
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:41,373
And the Genome Gyroscopes
are the champions!

132
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,375
Yes!

133
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,377
Alright, guys.
Have a great Christmas break!

134
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,597
I hope to see all of you
at the Reindeer Games.

135
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:48,835
I know I'm going
to see you guys.

136
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,339
See ya.

137
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,470
Bye, Ms. G.

138
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,516
Oh, GGs for the W!

139
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:54,996
Uncle Chase!

140
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,826
What's up, Jeremy?

141
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,437
Hey, buddy.

142
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,047
Oh, you guys.

143
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:10,011
Uh, hold on a second.

144
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:14,842
Pre-med? Is that you?

145
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:17,018
It's me, Chase.

146
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:20,500
Ah, yes, yes. I am aware.

147
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,634
So, the legend is true.

148
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,680
Harrison High's golden boy
has returned home

149
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,682
for the holidays.

150
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,076
Yeah, well, I, you know,
missed too many Christmases

151
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,035
with these guys
and I came to help my sister

152
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,210
while my mom's away.

153
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,559
Cool.

154
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,735
God, how long has it been?

155
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,346
It's been a minute.

156
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,614
I'm gonna go get

157
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,398
something from my locker.

158
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,791
Yeah, okay.

159
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,227
I'll see you outside.

160
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,576
See ya, Jer.

161
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,012
Bye, Ms. G.

162
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,366
You just look so great.

163
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,151
Oh.

164
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:06,154
The last time I saw you,
you were...

165
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:07,372
I mean you had, like, the...

166
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,896
Yeah, the braces,
and the glasses,

167
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,090
and a love-hate
relationship with Proactive?

168
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,029
That's not what I meant.

169
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,337
Relax. I'm over it. Mostly.

170
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:18,122
It's not like there's a constant
reminder of my unfortunate youth

171
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,404
displayed in a public
shrine that I walk by

172
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:20,516
every day of my life.

173
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:24,085
Oh, wait. Thank you for that.

174
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,348
It's really good to see you.

175
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:27,828
Yeah, you too.

176
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:34,530
If it isn't
the Pirate King himself!

177
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,664
Simon Augustus Cook!

178
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,275
I mean, it's so good to see you.

179
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,843
Oh, wow. Wow.

180
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,236
Wow, hi.

181
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,717
Wait, what are
you two doing here?

182
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:51,721
Oh, well, I teach English
and Drama, you know, obvi.

183
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,505
Someone had to
carry on the legacy of

184
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,856
the Huskies Theater program
after you left us

185
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,771
- for fame and fortune.
- Fair.

186
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:02,166
My husband and I loved
Deathly Panic by the way.

187
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:06,518
Chad actually camped out
for tickets to number six.

188
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,130
- He's a little obsessed.
- A little bit. Yeah.

189
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,308
Uh, wow.
That's awesome. Thank you.

190
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,571
What about you?
Are you here inspiring

191
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:18,182
the youth of today to
follow you in the medical field?

192
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:21,490
Actually, I work here too.

193
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,754
Oh, what about the...

194
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,322
I teach AP Bio and Chemistry,

195
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,585
and my students
are so inspiring.

196
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,631
Your nephew is
actually one of my best.

197
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:37,288
Yeah. Speaking of which,
I should probably get him home.

198
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:43,947
I would love to catch up
properly in the next few days.

199
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,384
Are you guys going to
the Reindeer Games this weekend?

200
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:47,579
Are we going to
the Reindeer Games?

201
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,561
Um, yes. What?

202
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,868
- Five time champion!
- He's the Emcee, so.

203
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,130
- Right there.
- Yeah.

204
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,654
Okay. I got it.

205
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:55,872
We'll be there.

206
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,352
- Okay.
- Yeah.

207
00:10:57,482 --> 00:11:00,616
Uh, so I guess
I'll see you there.

208
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:01,878
Simon.

209
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,011
Pre-med.

210
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,624
Oh, my god. Oh, my God.

211
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,671
Oh, my God. Mac. Mac!

212
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,064
Chase Weston
remembered my middle name.

213
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,850
He is still so nice,

214
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,026
and he called you
by your old nickname.

215
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:20,592
"See you later, Pre-med."

216
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,116
Yeah, I hate that nickname.

217
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,683
You used to like it.

218
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,816
And you used to love him.

219
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,210
He doesn't do it for me anymore.

220
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:31,603
Super mega
action star Chase Weston

221
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,823
does it for everybody.

222
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,671
Plus you actually have
history with that Adonis,

223
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,015
so I do not accept
that statement.

224
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,003
I'm sorry, history?
He kissed me one time

225
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,677
in a convention center
at the science fair

226
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,113
in Poughkeepsie
and then proceeded to

227
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,879
totally Danny Zuko me, so...

228
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,446
He dressed you in leather
and permed you hair?

229
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,333
Can we please stop
talking about Chase Weston?

230
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:51,754
Are you kidding me?

231
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,887
All I wanna do is
talk about Chase Weston.

232
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,778
This is the most exciting thing
that's happened to me in years.

233
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:56,933
To you?

234
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:58,979
Yes! To me.

235
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,938
I am old and I am married
and I have been asking to

236
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:04,245
live vicariously through
your love life forever

237
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,726
and you have never delivered.

238
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,292
This might be my only chance.

239
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,598
Oh, my God.

240
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:12,732
Oh.

241
00:12:58,995 --> 00:12:59,822
Alright, a couple of minutes.

242
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:00,823
Watch it.

243
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:01,824
Oh, yeah.

244
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,565
Yeah? Okay.

245
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,312
Man: One more? Yeah.

246
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,155
Straight Poker, one draw.

247
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:30,461
You're going to
hate me forever for this.

248
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,028
Hey, boys.

249
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,117
Sweetheart!

250
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,336
Hiya, Mac!

251
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:36,685
Ricky. Hi.

252
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,689
How ya doin', kiddo?

253
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:44,475
Ah, you know,

254
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:45,781
it feels different every year,

255
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,914
but it's never any lighter.

256
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,350
I know what you mean.

257
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,571
Come on, let's do this thing.

258
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:54,834
Yeah, let's do it.

259
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:02,624
Everybody ready?

260
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,321
Mm-hm.

261
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,933
We miss ya like crazy, Charlie.

262
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:10,588
You were tough as nails,
and funnier than most.

263
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,503
And one good lookin'
son-of-a-gun.

264
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,767
We dedicate this year's
Reindeer Games to your memory.

265
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,292
Merry Christmas, Pop.

266
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,207
Merry Christmas.

267
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,955
Gotta be honest.

268
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,933
I think he'd be mad
we keep wasting good scotch.

269
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,567
It's tradition.

270
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:35,004
I'm just saying.
It's good scotch. Mm.

271
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,286
I know, what're ya
gonna do with this guy?

272
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,051
Come on, let's play some cards.

273
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,593
I'm not sure
I trust you to deal, Ricky.

274
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,793
You calling me a cheater?

275
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,752
I mean, if the boot fits.

276
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:46,624
Get outta here.

277
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,191
- Come on.
- Alright.

278
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:49,976
Let's go.

279
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:53,327
I'm so happy that

280
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:56,373
Santa's on his way

281
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:57,897
Been waiting all year long

282
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,507
For Christmas Day

283
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:05,774
I feel alive when
I look up to the sky

284
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,516
We're gonna go find Jasper.

285
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,518
Okay.

286
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,780
Hey. Good luck, buddy.

287
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,042
Chase.

288
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,043
Yeah?

289
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,349
Chase?

290
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,785
Yeah, Serena. What's up?

291
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,613
What's going on?

292
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,938
You've been buried in
that thing since you got here.

293
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,703
I'm on the short list
for a movie,

294
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,750
so I'm just checking emails
and texts and other stuff.

295
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:28,014
Hoping that this project
will put me back on the map.

296
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,277
It's just been a few years
since I've done a big movie,

297
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:34,237
and freaking Brad
keeps booking my gigs.

298
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,065
"So jazzed to be
working with this

299
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:38,111
Academy Award-winning genius."
That's a stretch.

300
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,592
"Hashtag blessed,
Hashtag grateful.

301
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,377
Prayer emoji, prayer emoji."

302
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,292
God, I hate that guy.

303
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,468
Okay, so when you said
that you were checking emails

304
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:50,819
and texts and stuff,
what you were really doing

305
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,864
was stalking your rival
on social media.

306
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,519
Now, does that make you
feel good or not so good?

307
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,522
I'm gonna take that as
a "not so good." Hey, Mac!

308
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:02,439
Morning, Serena. Hey!

309
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:03,764
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this belly!

310
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,007
Any day now.

311
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,704
Oh, Lord, I'm ready,

312
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:09,272
but my due date's not
'til after Christmas.

313
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,230
Well, must be nice to have your
brother in town to help out.

314
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,014
Chase is a god-send.

315
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,221
With Michael deployed
and my mom needing to help Nanna

316
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:15,602
in Florida, I don't know
what I'd do without him.

317
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:18,194
Yeah, happy to help.

318
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,109
You getting deja-vu?

319
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,285
Wanna try your luck
and join a team?

320
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,157
Ha! No. Thank you very much.

321
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,527
But I will enjoy watching
you all freeze to death though.

322
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,728
When did the Reindeer Games
become such a production?

323
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,208
When Simon took over.

324
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,297
Right. Say no more.

325
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:35,298
Ho-ho-ho!

326
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:36,385
And there he is.

327
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,174
Ah!
Merry Christmas to everybody!

328
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:44,699
Hey!

329
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:47,528
Hey, boys!
How's our competition look?

330
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:49,027
- Like nothing we can't destroy.
- Yeah.

331
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,183
Wait, this is your team?

332
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,318
Hey!

333
00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:59,931
Welcome to the 37th Annual

334
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,064
Harrison Falls Reindeer Games!

335
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,027
Hoo-whee.

336
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:10,594
So, this year we are
playing to benefit

337
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:14,207
the Harrison Falls Hospital
children's ward. And now...

338
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,733
Are you ready to get
your Reindeer Games on?

339
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:24,304
Now, as is our custom,
we will open the games with

340
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,958
The Polar Bear Plunge!

341
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,527
Six brave teams have
registered for the Games.

342
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:33,487
How many will be
left after the Plunge?

343
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,489
Only one way to find out.

344
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,666
Jingle Jangles and Donner Dads,
you're up first.

345
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,320
Come on up. Let the games begin!

346
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,366
Yeah, let's see what you got!

347
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,284
And three.

348
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,156
Two.

349
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:51,940
One.

350
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,333
Plunge!

351
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,640
Ooh.

352
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,947
I'm feeling physical pain
just watching them.

353
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:01,732
Don't tell me Hollywood's
made you soft, Chase Weston.

354
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,908
- Jasper's out.
- What?

355
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,495
He ate way too much
caramel corn last night.

356
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,955
He's puking everywhere.

357
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,349
We need three to compete.
What do we do?

358
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:12,613
Up next, Santa's Sisters
and the Mistletoe Misfits.

359
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,789
Come on down!

360
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:18,968
If you can find a replacement,
you can still play.

361
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,838
Who's gonna join
our team last minute?

362
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:24,190
One. Plunge!

363
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,627
Three, two, one...

364
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:28,977
Uncle Chase?

365
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,414
Hilarious. No.

366
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,697
Come on. It'll just be like that
thing you did, The Arctic Fox.

367
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,723
Come on, man. You know
that was a stunt double.

368
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,854
You know I hate the cold.

369
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,987
Come on, Chase.

370
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:41,642
I know for a fact you did this
exact plunge your senior year.

371
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:44,601
Yeah, and then I got pneumonia
and I couldn't finish my final

372
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:45,907
performance of Oklahoma.

373
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,430
Randy McLeod had to step in,

374
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:48,973
and that kid can't
even hit a high G.

375
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,652
Blitzen Boys,
Kringle Kids. Let's go!

376
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,175
Oh, hang on one sec!

377
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:54,587
We might have a teammate
replacement maybe.

378
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,483
- Jerry: Come on!
- I'm sorry, Jer.

379
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:57,764
I might have
a big movie coming up.

380
00:18:57,788 --> 00:18:58,833
I can't risk getting sick.

381
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,011
I'm so sorry, honey.

382
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,231
I know how much
this means to you.

383
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,382
And if your father were here,

384
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,277
he'd be in there
with you in a heartbeat.

385
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:11,106
It appears we have
our first forfeit of the game.

386
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:15,284
The Kringle Kids have failed
to produce their third teammate.

387
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,766
No, they haven't!

388
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,246
I'll do it!

389
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,030
Yes!

390
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:25,251
Oh, wow, and, well,
just like that they are...

391
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,011
I can't believe you
talked me into this, sis.

392
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,037
Thanks to a last minute
save by Harrison Paul's

393
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,128
very own super star,
Chase Weston.

394
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,652
Is he taking... Oh, wow.

395
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,437
Okay, Hollywood. Let's go.

396
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,658
Yeah!

397
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:42,853
Come on, Uncle Chase. Let's go!

398
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,400
Here, hold that.

399
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:48,361
Come on, we got this! Woo!

400
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,407
Yeah!

401
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:52,713
Hey, buddy.

402
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:56,978
Keep it together, man.

403
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:58,240
I don't think I can do this.

404
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:00,068
- Five.
- You have to do this.

405
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:01,635
- Four!
- Do I though?

406
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,376
Three.

407
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:04,831
It's now or never, Chase.
What's it going to be?

408
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:06,161
Two.

409
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,597
Is there a trick
to this madness?

410
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:09,033
One.

411
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,819
Just turn your brain off
and jump.

412
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:13,081
Right.

413
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,997
Plunge!

414
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,406
Where you going, Hollywood?

415
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:34,668
Yeah! Let's go!

416
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:35,886
I hate you!

417
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,117
Come on, who's next?

418
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:52,251
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

419
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:57,505
Here you go, you're welcome.

420
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,909
Hi!

421
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:06,830
Okay. Okay.

422
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,488
Here, take a swig of this.

423
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,663
It's 10:00am.

424
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,012
I'm good.

425
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,536
No, you're not.

426
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:17,817
You're two shakes
from hypothermic.

427
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,103
You're clearly freezing.

428
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:23,412
I am toasty. I'm warm. I'm fine.

429
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,022
That's your toasty look?

430
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:28,025
No, it's good.
You should go into acting.

431
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,332
That's hilarious.

432
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,682
Just take a swig.
It'll warm you right up.

433
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:33,988
Doctor's orders.

434
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,381
Wait, so you are a doctor?

435
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,165
Technically yes,
but paramedic now.

436
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:38,688
Volunteer paramedic.

437
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,516
Whatever,
just drink the booze, man.

438
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,823
Fine. Geez. So pushy.

439
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,392
No fraternizing with the enemy.

440
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,958
Or sharing our booze with them.

441
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:51,179
Oh, he needed it way
more than we do, Saul.

442
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,573
Come on,
an action star like yourself?

443
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,540
You'd think you'd be
used to extreme situations.

444
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:57,968
Well...

445
00:21:58,055 --> 00:21:59,206
You know who's
a great action star?

446
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,319
Oh, please don't say Brad.

447
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,059
Clint Eastwood.

448
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,670
- Yeah.
- Do you know Clint Eastwood?

449
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,369
I mean, I don't...

450
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,850
I mean, I know who he is,
but I haven't...

451
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:11,697
He doesn't want to
talk about Clint Eastwood.

452
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,656
Well, why wouldn't he wanna
talk about Clint Eastwood?

453
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,291
Everybody loves Clint Eastwood.

454
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,858
I love Clint Eastwood.

455
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:23,733
I am holding in
my hand six envelopes.

456
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,519
Each contains a list
of the three games

457
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,303
that will be played
this coming week,

458
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,174
culminating in our
Annual Christmas Eve Dance

459
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:32,916
right here at the Fire Station,

460
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:35,484
where the Kris Kringle Cup
will be awarded

461
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:37,486
to the last team standing.

462
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,710
Your judges to my left
will award points for

463
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,409
creativity, skill,
wit, and will.

464
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:50,194
And now for the theme.

465
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:54,373
The 37th Annual Harrison Falls

466
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,592
Reindeer Games theme is...

467
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,771
The beloved novel,
A Christmas Carol.

468
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:07,840
You will be given points
for incorporating this theme

469
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:09,213
into each of the events.

470
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,520
So, use these next few days

471
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:15,524
of prep very wisely.

472
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:16,960
Alright, teams. Begin!

473
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,180
Alright. Oh, my gosh.

474
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,487
Okay.

475
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:23,706
Uncle Chase!
Let's go brainstorm!

476
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:26,100
Come on! Let's go!
Come on! Let's go!

477
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,667
Uh, okay. Okay.
I'm keeping this.

478
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:28,885
Let's go.

479
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:30,757
Okay. Look...

480
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,594
Uh, guys, are we
allowed to be in here?

481
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:44,510
Perks of being
the wood shop manager.

482
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,555
Oh, okay, Jeremy and I,
we'll head to the shop,

483
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:50,037
and Chase, you hit the drama
department for wardrobe.

484
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:51,473
On it.

485
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,909
Cool.

486
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:56,435
Yes.

487
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,611
Mm...

488
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:09,186
Oh, yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

489
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:23,026
Hey, Teri. It's, uh...

490
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:24,245
It's me again.

491
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:27,291
Just checking in.

492
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:31,252
You don't have to call me back,

493
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,341
but if you want to, you know.

494
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,954
I'm just... I'm just...

495
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:43,220
I'm really hoping
for some good news

496
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:44,587
after a long,
frustrating season.

497
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,706
Anyway, I'm rambling.

498
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:53,361
Ah, take care.

499
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,844
And Merry Christmas.

500
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,419
Oh!

501
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:13,381
I'm still here.

502
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,904
Yup.

503
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:17,428
You good?

504
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,387
Yeah, I'm great. What's up?

505
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:25,436
I'm sorry.
Your face is really good.

506
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,569
Mm-hm.

507
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:33,880
Well, I mean, you kinda
just manifested out of nowhere.

508
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,664
I'm very scary.

509
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:38,275
I mean, you're terrifying.
We done now?

510
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:40,234
I don't know.
I'm still thinking.

511
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:42,517
Well, it looks like you and I
had the same idea so let's, uh,

512
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,585
back it up there, shorty.

513
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,282
Okay.

514
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,937
Um... Did you leave
some for the rest of us?

515
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:49,896
Oh, Simon is obsessed
with Victorian England,

516
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,854
I promise there's
plenty to go around.

517
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:55,031
Well, this is
an interesting choice.

518
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:56,574
I thought the theme
was A Christmas Carol,

519
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,513
not Mars Attacks.

520
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:00,341
Am I missing something?

521
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:02,648
You'll just have
to wait and see.

522
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:03,910
Hm. Hm.

523
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,260
Can I?

524
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,261
- You what?
- I just have to...

525
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:08,349
- What?
- I'm gonna go.

526
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,220
'Cause, uh... 'Cause, uh...

527
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,198
- Oh, my bad. It's my bad.
- Yeah. 'Cause you're... Sorry.

528
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:13,572
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Yup. Yup.

529
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,052
Bye!

530
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,358
Hold on a second, um...

531
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:20,796
Could you just help me?

532
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,798
For old time's sake.

533
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,584
'Cause you clearly
are an expert at this,

534
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,586
and I have zero idea
what I'm doing.

535
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:31,851
Mm-hm.

536
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:33,592
What?

537
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,855
No, it's just,
this feels very familiar.

538
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,857
Oh, come on.

539
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:40,009
You charming me into doing
all the work on our lab reports

540
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,905
and then high-fiving
when we got an A.

541
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:45,144
That's just... All I heard
was you think I'm charming.

542
00:26:45,168 --> 00:26:46,735
Oh, my gosh.

543
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:48,102
I don't want to let Jeremy down.

544
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:52,804
Okay, you know, fine.
I will give you this one thing,

545
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:55,570
and then that's it.
No more help from me.

546
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,287
So, just think about
the themes weaved through

547
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:58,462
the story of A Christmas Carol.

548
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:00,836
Generosity, community,

549
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:03,056
redemption,
transformational growth.

550
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,448
Just pick a theme
and go with it.

551
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:05,687
Doesn't matter
what you wear as long as

552
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,147
it's connected to the theme.

553
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,193
- Hey, stop!
- Ow!

554
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:11,499
Do your own work.

555
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,327
Yes, ma'am. Copy that.

556
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,636
Transformational growth?

557
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,290
Uh, one more thing.

558
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:27,602
Don't be afraid to,
you know, think outside the box,

559
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,778
make a fool of yourself.

560
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,519
What's the point
if it isn't fun, right?

561
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,698
Huh.

562
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:39,396
Um...

563
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:40,659
Ooh, what's this?

564
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:54,324
2015 Weston blockbuster.

565
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,805
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

566
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:18,566
Chase Weston.

567
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:32,536
Holy...

568
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:41,676
Ladies and gentlemen,

569
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:45,811
welcome to
The Human Dog Sled Derby!

570
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:53,775
Maybe the chains
were a bad idea.

571
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:56,082
Yes.

572
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:58,258
Now, our judges are
currently awarding points

573
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:00,477
for creativity and wit,

574
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:03,480
but points are meaningless
if you don't get across

575
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:04,743
the finish line quickly,

576
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:07,789
because the bottom two
teams will be...

577
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,399
Eliminated.

578
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:11,401
Christmas Future?

579
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:12,489
Yup.

580
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,143
I see what you did there.

581
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:16,711
Thought I told you to
think outside the box.

582
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:19,583
Well, I got the making
a fool of myself part down, so.

583
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,848
Alright, teams, mount up!

584
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:26,112
Oh, and God bless you,
every one.

585
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:31,639
Ready. Set.

586
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:35,251
Go!

587
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,085
Go!

588
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,048
Pick up the pace!
They're gaining on us!

589
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,485
Faster!

590
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:54,662
They're gaining on us!

591
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,056
Oh! Go! Go! Go! Go!

592
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,145
Let's go, let's go! We got this!

593
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,755
Go!

594
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:04,890
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

595
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,675
Go, go, go! Yeah!

596
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:13,942
Yes! Yeah!

597
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,818
Yes!

598
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:22,603
Yes!

599
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,876
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

600
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,225
Trouble in paradise?

601
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:37,748
Thank you. No.

602
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,708
It's annoying, I'm stuck.

603
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:45,713
We talking life or career?

604
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,644
Well, I was talking
about Tuesday's crossword,

605
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:48,866
but now that you mention it.

606
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,153
You do crosswords now?

607
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:54,113
Yeah, thanks to you, I've been
addicted since high school.

608
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,766
I'm still terrible, though.

609
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,943
I can barely get through
Monday's without help.

610
00:30:58,073 --> 00:30:59,814
Well, I can help you.

611
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:04,427
I'm sorry, don't you have
a rule against that?

612
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,536
I don't accept help from others,
but I'm happy to give it,

613
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,754
you know, I mean,
if you need it.

614
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:09,041
I'm sure you are.

615
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:11,304
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt,

616
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:12,871
but can I get a pic with you?

617
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,830
Hi. Yeah, sure.

618
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,876
Awesome.

619
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:20,443
Can you?

620
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,097
Oh? Oh, sorry. Yeah.

621
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:24,230
Thanks.

622
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,753
There we go.

623
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:29,539
Good.

624
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,801
- Thanks, bro.
- Thanks, man.

625
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,326
I am so sorry about that.

626
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:34,493
It's totally, totally fine.

627
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:35,850
Not weird at all.

628
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,330
What were we talking about?

629
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,114
Hi, I saw you taking pictures

630
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:41,092
and my daughter would kill me
if I didn't get one, so.

631
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,075
- Oh, Yeah.
- You don't mind, Mac, do you?

632
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:45,468
Oh, no. I don't.
I don't mind at all.

633
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,253
Ready? Here we go.

634
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,100
Oh, you wanna look
in this direction, though?

635
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:51,387
Oh, oh.

636
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:55,174
There we go. This is super fun.

637
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:56,697
Nice.

638
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,351
Thank you. Thank you, Chase.

639
00:31:58,481 --> 00:31:59,787
Ah, you're very welcome.

640
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:04,444
Uh, there's a bunch of
people behind me right now.

641
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:06,576
Mm-hm.

642
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:08,839
Uh, Chase.

643
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,841
Don't you have that meeting?

644
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,341
- The... With the director?
- You know what? I do.

645
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:13,820
- I do have that call.
- Sorry, you guys.

646
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:15,083
- He has a meeting.
- Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

647
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:16,630
I gotta go.

648
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,026
I think we'll be safe up here.

649
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:22,462
Oh.

650
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,133
I do not see
that couple happening.

651
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,472
He is not good for her.

652
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:36,737
What?

653
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:38,987
You just pulled me into
the high school make-out spot.

654
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,221
What? No. Oh!

655
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:43,807
No. That was...
That was not my intention.

656
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,702
I... It...

657
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,836
It's dark and quiet
and away from people.

658
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:51,404
Yeah. Exactly.

659
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:54,407
Are you trying to take
advantage of me, Pre-med?

660
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,626
You... You know what? Shut up!

661
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:58,628
You're welcome, by the way.

662
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,283
I'm sorry.
Thank you for rescuing me.

663
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,285
Yeah, I didn't exactly
frequent this spot,

664
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:04,721
or spots like this
in high school.

665
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:07,898
So, you know, honest mistake.

666
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:11,728
Well, I did frequent
this particular spot,

667
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,947
quite a few times.

668
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,080
Yeah, with which cheerleaders?

669
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,996
By myself actually,
thank you very much.

670
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,440
Came up here to get
away from the noise.

671
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:30,399
Sort stuff out
when I felt stuck.

672
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,881
I put a lot of pressure
on myself back then.

673
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,885
Still do.

674
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,547
It can't be easy living
in a fishbowl like you do.

675
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:53,248
Is it always like that,
with the fans, I mean?

676
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:54,945
Yeah, sometimes.

677
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,166
But, you know,
I don't mind that part so much.

678
00:33:58,297 --> 00:34:02,823
It's more the pressure to
be more, do more, stay relevant.

679
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,793
Whether I'm actually
enjoying any of it or not.

680
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,177
That sounds exhausting.

681
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:14,008
I mean, do you enjoy it?

682
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:17,316
Do you love it
when you're doing it?

683
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,927
Well, yeah. Of course.

684
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,416
I mean,
I'm living the dream, right?

685
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,935
Right.

686
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,461
I'm sorry, I...

687
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,550
No. Don't be sorry.
I asked 'cause I'm interested.

688
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:41,470
I remember this about you.

689
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,385
What?

690
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:46,214
How easy it is to talk to you.

691
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:57,095
You know what you need?

692
00:34:57,182 --> 00:35:00,533
What do I need?

693
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:02,076
In my experience, the best way
to get out of your head

694
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,381
is to go do something
for someone else.

695
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:05,233
So, you're coming with me.

696
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:06,974
Where are we going?

697
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:14,590
Alright, there you go.
I got one for you, Saul.

698
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:17,985
Macaroni and Chase.

699
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:19,900
Classic combo.

700
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:22,032
No? Okay.
So, you got the treats?

701
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:23,469
Mm-hm.

702
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,924
Great, and Meera
is meeting us here?

703
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:26,820
- Yeah. Just texted her.
- Okay.

704
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,971
Hollywood,
glad you could join us!

705
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,257
Hope you warmed up your pipes.

706
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:30,476
Haven't caroled in a while,

707
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:32,434
but I promise
I will do my best, Sir.

708
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,958
Well we need all the help
we can get to drown out Ricky.

709
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:39,049
What I don't have in talent
I make up for in volume.

710
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:42,203
- Wow.
- It's a motto to live by.

711
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,489
- Mac!
- Hey, Meera!

712
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,901
- You guys ready for us?
- Absolutely.

713
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,250
We've been waiting
for this all week!

714
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:47,928
I can't tell you
how much it means to us

715
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:50,138
that the Games are benefiting
the hospital this year.

716
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,355
Well, you were an easy sell.

717
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,368
Alright.

718
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:54,587
- Alright.
- Let's go.

719
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:55,849
I'll take that.

720
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,123
Saul: Start here,
and then Ricky, you're up here.

721
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,075
I'll catch up.

722
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:07,208
You go up here.

723
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:08,992
We should switch,
so I would be here.

724
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,405
You want me to
hit the high notes?

725
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,126
Um, no, I think we'll be...

726
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:20,977
Sorry to interrupt.
Are you okay?

727
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:23,632
Yeah, I was just
lighting a candle for my dad.

728
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,853
I'm so sorry, Mac.

729
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:29,377
It's not your fault.

730
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,444
That looks like
it's seen better days.

731
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:36,428
Oh, yeah. It's from Pop.

732
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:38,256
Is it one of your
Christmas Eve letters?

733
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:42,477
Yeah. How did you know?

734
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:44,528
Well, you guys would
write a letter to each other

735
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,830
every year and exchange it
on Christmas Eve, right?

736
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:51,356
Yeah, I just can't
believe you remember that.

737
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:55,273
Well, I remember a lot of
stuff from back then.

738
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:00,930
He wrote this one to me
a couple days before he died.

739
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:05,587
Looks like it's still sealed.

740
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:08,286
Yeah, I haven't read it yet.

741
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:10,853
I keep trying to.

742
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:12,464
I carry it around
with me everywhere,

743
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:14,944
just waiting for
the right moment or something.

744
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,646
Well, he was such
an amazing person.

745
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,779
You must really miss him.

746
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,654
There you guys are.

747
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:30,090
Everybody is waiting. Come on!

748
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:33,006
Alright.

749
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,008
Okay.

750
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:38,838
Christmas Eve,
the lights are glowing

751
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:42,581
In the hallway and in my dreams

752
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:45,888
Somewhere in my heart
it's snowing

753
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:50,328
In the place that still believes

754
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:57,813
Silent night,
the stars are shining

755
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:01,904
Ice is forming in the dark

756
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:05,995
We stay warm beneath the covers

757
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:08,781
Winter wonder in our hearts

758
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:19,835
Frozen whisper, I still hear you

759
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:24,057
Singing sweetly of our love

760
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:27,843
Tender songs will
keep me near you

761
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:30,672
Underneath the moon above

762
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:42,162
Hey, Ruthie, guess who's
coming by the warehouse today.

763
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:45,905
Your friend Mary from school,
and her mommy.

764
00:39:45,992 --> 00:39:48,429
Murphy: Wow!
Mary's such a good elf, Dad.

765
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,171
She made two PB

766
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,955
Can I have grape jelly, please?

767
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:56,829
I love this movie.
This is great.

768
00:39:56,916 --> 00:40:00,310
You know, I've always wanted
to work with this director?

769
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,401
What's going on with you?

770
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,620
Did you get
the part or something?

771
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:07,970
What? No. I haven't heard.

772
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:10,320
I actually haven't
checked my phone in hours.

773
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,279
Then something's
definitely going on with you.

774
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,325
I'm great actually.

775
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:16,979
I just went caroling.

776
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:20,069
With Mac?
You did Mac's caroling thing?

777
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,769
Yeah. It was... It was nice.

778
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:25,335
Say more.

779
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,989
There's not much more to say.

780
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,730
Ooh, hey! Nachos!

781
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:29,992
Hey, make your own!

782
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,908
Ow! But these are amazing,

783
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,146
and they're right
here in front of me.

784
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,389
Really? I can't have a nacho?

785
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,825
Stop deflecting and talk to me.

786
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:38,871
I wanna know
what's going on with you.

787
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,612
Nothing!

788
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:49,751
I feel better today than
I have in a very long time,

789
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:51,599
and I think it has
something to do with this place

790
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:53,015
and the people here.

791
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:55,453
Any specific people?

792
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,802
Mm.

793
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,894
Fine. Mac is...

794
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:06,812
You know, she's... She's Mac.

795
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:08,335
She's a breath of fresh air

796
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,989
and it was nice
to see her again.

797
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:11,532
Have I shared enough?
Are you happy now?

798
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:12,905
Can I please just have a nacho?

799
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:15,428
Thank you.

800
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,996
Mm-hm.

801
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:28,660
Here you go. Enjoy.

802
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:30,662
Would you like some
butter on this one?

803
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:34,796
Don't do that.

804
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,886
We only have one cube,
so we have to do this properly.

805
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,453
- Okay.
- Okay?

806
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,802
What?

807
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:43,370
Oh, hey. You on fuel duty too?

808
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,806
Oh, yeah.

809
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:46,373
I don't need a pick.

810
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,003
Just give me a smaller
chisel right here.

811
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:50,682
Okay, okay. Don't get
your panties in a bunch.

812
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,161
Ricky's blood sugar
is low again.

813
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:53,989
Tell him to take a break.

814
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,924
We don't have to present
the sculptures till tomorrow.

815
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:58,341
I dunno, they want this
win as bad as I do.

816
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:00,082
I don't think
that's humanly possible.

817
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:04,565
Hey, um, take a break with me.

818
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:05,784
With you?

819
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:07,350
Yeah.

820
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:11,006
I just need help
with one little thing.

821
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:15,402
I thought we talked about this.

822
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:18,710
No, no, no. This is different.

823
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,495
I don't need your direct help.

824
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:23,279
I just need your
access to the atrium.

825
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:26,456
What does an atrium have
to do with ice sculpting?

826
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:28,676
Well, if I told you that,
it'd be cheating.

827
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:30,460
Okay. Whatever. Be my guest.

828
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:31,984
- Mm.
- Go.

829
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:35,988
Turn around.

830
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:37,511
- What?
- No spying.

831
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,731
It's my... It's my classroom!

832
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:49,784
I'm done.

833
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:52,352
Geez!

834
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,963
Hey, do you know there's this
new thing called the internet,

835
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:56,878
where you can, like,
look up any pictures of

836
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:58,314
any atrium in the entire world?

837
00:42:58,445 --> 00:42:59,489
- What?
- Yes!

838
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,535
Oh, that's so amazing,

839
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,276
except none of those
would be our atrium.

840
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,210
You know, it still
smells like AP Bio in here.

841
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,242
Formaldehyde
and overachievement?

842
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:19,031
Oh. Look, Pre-med.
We used to sit right over here.

843
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:22,904
It was actually over here,
and I don't like that nickname.

844
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:24,316
Well, you used to
call me Fancy Pants.

845
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,734
The fanciest of all the pants.

846
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,101
At least yours was a compliment.

847
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,737
You were younger and smarter

848
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:30,932
and at least a foot shorter
than everyone in class.

849
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:32,610
Late bloomer, but...

850
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:33,785
Kind of like Doogie Howser.

851
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:36,483
Except way cuter.

852
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,444
So...

853
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:49,148
What did happen with
you becoming a doctor?

854
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:51,803
It was literally all
you could talk about back then.

855
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:56,329
I, um...

856
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:58,636
I was actually
finishing up my residency

857
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:01,073
when my dad died,

858
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:02,727
and when he did, I...

859
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:05,904
I just fell apart.

860
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:08,210
I could barely function,

861
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:09,821
let alone take care
of anyone else.

862
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:13,259
He left me the house,

863
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:16,392
so I left
my residency in Boston,

864
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:18,830
and moved home
and then just eventually

865
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,832
started teaching
and volunteering.

866
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:27,403
Wait, you're gonna
go back, right?

867
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,058
Yeah, I want to, I plan to,

868
00:44:30,189 --> 00:44:32,974
it just hasn't really felt
like the right time yet.

869
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:35,934
Plus, I... you know, I've got
responsibilities here now,

870
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:39,589
and I still get
to do what I love

871
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,852
with the people that I love.

872
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:42,549
It's a good life.

873
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:45,204
And it's enough.

874
00:44:49,382 --> 00:44:50,644
How do you do it?

875
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,385
Do what?

876
00:44:55,344 --> 00:45:00,045
Know that you could
have so much more,

877
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:01,699
but you're content
with what you've got.

878
00:45:04,397 --> 00:45:06,399
I wish I could do that.

879
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:12,274
Yeah, I think...

880
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:15,190
I think big grief puts
a lot of things in perspective.

881
00:45:17,932 --> 00:45:20,674
I know I'd be totally
lost without my community,

882
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,893
that's for sure.

883
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:29,161
And look, I mean, I'm not
totally content with my work.

884
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:33,339
I miss my residency every day.

885
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:36,211
But my life is really full
because I know that I matter

886
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:39,388
to a few good people who know me

887
00:45:39,475 --> 00:45:41,521
and love me well.

888
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:43,566
And that's the good stuff.

889
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,221
I mean, it's the best stuff.

890
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:49,246
And that's all you really need.

891
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:55,578
Look, I know
I've said this before,

892
00:45:55,665 --> 00:45:59,278
but you're just really...

893
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,244
Smart.

894
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:17,339
Oh. Oh, it's Jeremy.

895
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:19,689
Oh?

896
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,082
Hey, Jer. What's up?

897
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:23,171
Oh, hi. Mom's water just broke.

898
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:24,477
Oh!

899
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:27,697
Okay, I'm on my way,

900
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,916
and I am bringing help.

901
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:30,309
Yeah, come on.

902
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:34,419
Come on, Mom. You got this.

903
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:36,402
Okay.

904
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:40,275
Oh, my god! This hurts.
I forgot how much this hurts.

905
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:41,886
I can't believe
Michael's not here.

906
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,975
How am I supposed
to do this without him?

907
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:46,847
I got you, sis. I'm here.

908
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:48,588
Look at me.

909
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:49,850
Okay, Chase, I got this.

910
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:50,808
- You got it?
- Uh-huh.

911
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:51,895
No! Stay with me!

912
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:53,332
Oh, my God!

913
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,073
Uh, Jeremy.

914
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,160
Yeah?

915
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:57,118
How are your driving skills?

916
00:46:57,249 --> 00:46:58,467
I have my learner's permit.

917
00:47:03,603 --> 00:47:05,344
Everybody okay back there?

918
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:08,173
Eyes on the road, Jer.
Hands on the wheel, ten and two!

919
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,739
How far apart
are your contractions?

920
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,002
They keep coming faster.

921
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:12,172
Like, every minute or two.

922
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,656
Oh, boy. Yeah, you are close.

923
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:15,025
I'm just gonna take
your pulse now, okay?

924
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:16,461
Are we gonna
make it to the hospital?

925
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:18,183
We better make it
to the hospital.

926
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,881
I refuse to birth my daughter
in a lame rental car!

927
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:22,491
Hey, hey, hey.
Serena, grab my hand.

928
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:25,277
Just like that. You got it.

929
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:29,411
Oh, my...

930
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:32,284
Yup! That was a big one.

931
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:34,982
Well done. Well done.

932
00:47:35,113 --> 00:47:36,525
Um, okay, Jeremy, we're gonna
need to pick up the pace.

933
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:37,874
Baby's heart rate's
a little elevated, so.

934
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,421
What? What about her heart rate?

935
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:41,597
It's gonna be okay.
You are doing great, Serena.

936
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,643
Baby just wants out and
we need to keep her snug

937
00:47:43,773 --> 00:47:46,211
a little while longer,
so I need you to breathe, okay?

938
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:48,387
- Breathe.
- Big breaths in.

939
00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:55,742
In. That's it. Yes.

940
00:47:57,352 --> 00:47:59,050
Outta the way!

941
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:00,747
Baby coming through!

942
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:03,837
Did you just run
a red light, Jer?

943
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:05,404
Yeah, but I did it safely, Mom.

944
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:06,971
I looked both ways.

945
00:48:07,058 --> 00:48:09,582
Oh, buddy,
you're doing such a good job.

946
00:48:09,669 --> 00:48:11,497
No, he's not!

947
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:13,194
Serena...

948
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:15,283
I want to push!

949
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,285
All: Don't push!

950
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:19,331
Dude! Dude, come on!

951
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:23,988
Hey, uh, we need some help here!

952
00:48:24,118 --> 00:48:25,337
- Mac?
- Meera! Thank God!

953
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:27,208
We're having a baby right now!

954
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:28,895
Call I and D.
Tell them we're on our way.

955
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:30,472
Okay, gently, gently.
There we go.

956
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:35,564
Okay, I'm still here.

957
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:37,827
Contractions are
one minute apart.

958
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,612
Baby's BP's slightly elevated.

959
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:41,179
She is crowning
and ready to push.

960
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:43,268
Okay, got it. Thanks.

961
00:48:43,355 --> 00:48:45,400
Serena. Dr. Gupta here
is the best of the best,

962
00:48:45,531 --> 00:48:47,185
she's gonna take
great care of you. Okay?

963
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:49,013
Okay.

964
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:50,773
I'm just gonna need
my hand back now, though.

965
00:48:50,797 --> 00:48:52,016
Okay.

966
00:49:03,288 --> 00:49:04,985
She did it!

967
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:07,640
Healthy baby girl.
Happy mama. Proud brother.

968
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:14,690
You wanna meet her?

969
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:16,605
Yeah, yeah! Um, yeah.

970
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:19,217
Okay.

971
00:49:23,656 --> 00:49:25,701
Oh, my goodness.

972
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:26,920
I'm naming her Holly.

973
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,487
It's perfect.

974
00:49:29,575 --> 00:49:31,490
She's perfect.

975
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,642
The most beautiful
Christmas gift in the world.

976
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,973
Do you want to hold her?

977
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:44,068
Oh, hey, baby. Hello.

978
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,767
Oh, my goodness.

979
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:49,943
I don't know what
we would have done without you.

980
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:52,119
Thank you so much
for everything, Mac.

981
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:53,947
Yeah, that was crazy.

982
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:56,210
You're like a real
life superhero, Ms. G.

983
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:59,213
No, your mom's
the real superhero here,

984
00:49:59,344 --> 00:50:01,184
and you weren't so bad
behind the wheel either.

985
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:07,700
It's Dad!

986
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,484
Here you go.

987
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:10,790
Thank you.

988
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,359
I don't want to
impose on family time.

989
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:16,622
I'm just gonna head home.

990
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:18,885
Well, hang on, I'll drive you.

991
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,843
Okay.

992
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,038
Just give me one second. Chase.

993
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:24,282
Yeah?

994
00:50:24,412 --> 00:50:27,111
Mac is amazing.

995
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:29,330
Just don't be an idiot.

996
00:50:29,461 --> 00:50:31,941
Not again.

997
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:51,918
You were incredible back there.

998
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,355
So were you.

999
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:57,619
No, but you, you were calm
and focused and in control.

1000
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,578
I am telling you, Mac,

1001
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:02,624
you have to go
back to your residency.

1002
00:51:02,711 --> 00:51:05,801
You cannot deprive the world
of these gifts any longer.

1003
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:10,241
Yeah, I remember this about you.

1004
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:15,681
What?

1005
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:23,341
Just the way you make me feel.

1006
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:28,172
Like I can
literally do anything.

1007
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:30,261
You literally can do anything.

1008
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,119
Look, I only speak the truth.

1009
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,922
When you are in
the presence greatness

1010
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:42,273
you have to acknowledge it.

1011
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,235
And I'm standing here...

1012
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:54,241
in the presence of greatness.

1013
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:01,466
What are you doing to me, Chase?

1014
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:24,402
I have wanted to do that
again for a very long time.

1015
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:28,536
I'm glad you did.

1016
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:31,713
- I missed you, Mac.
- I really missed you.

1017
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,816
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1018
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,515
I'm coming.

1019
00:52:50,602 --> 00:52:52,081
It's a Christmas Miracle!

1020
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,735
Tell me everything. Go.

1021
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:55,998
How could you possibly...

1022
00:52:56,085 --> 00:52:58,566
We have been neighbors
since we were five.

1023
00:52:58,653 --> 00:53:02,918
I have watched every awkward
doorstep scene you've ever had.

1024
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:05,660
You think I was gonna miss
2012's MTV movie award winner

1025
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:08,272
for best screen kiss when
he rolled up here? Please.

1026
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:10,187
Now spill the tea!

1027
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:12,537
I... I...
I don't know what happened.

1028
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:14,016
I'm just... I'm still waking up.

1029
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:18,717
Well, maybe this
will jog your memory.

1030
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:20,936
Now, give me the deets.

1031
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:23,330
And honestly, can I just say,

1032
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:26,203
I'm kind of offended
that you didn't text me,

1033
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,292
like, right away.

1034
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:31,164
Oh, my God. You're glowing.

1035
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:34,211
Oh, my God.
You're actually glowing.

1036
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,867
This is nuts.

1037
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:40,260
This is nuts.
What am I thinking?

1038
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:41,827
Mac, don't you dare.

1039
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:43,785
No, he's, like,
he's on another planet.

1040
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,716
This is fantasy land.
What is the future here?

1041
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:48,007
Stop, stop, stop.
You always do this!

1042
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:50,314
You always come up with
some excuse for why it won't

1043
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:52,379
work out for you, right when
it is working out for you.

1044
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:54,100
No, I don't.

1045
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:58,583
There was Johnny the finance guy
who was "too distant."

1046
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:00,498
Yeah, well...

1047
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:02,302
There was Rhett the realtor
who was "too clingy."

1048
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,284
Oh, and let's not forget Marco,

1049
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:07,113
who had literally
nothing wrong with him.

1050
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,854
I did not respond
to his love language.

1051
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:11,335
Who doesn't respond to gifts?!

1052
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:14,947
Mac, what if this is it?

1053
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:16,601
What if everything
that has happened

1054
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:18,385
has brought you
and Chase back together?

1055
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:25,697
You're glowing again.

1056
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:34,532
Good gentlepeople!

1057
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:36,882
Our judges have
reached their decision.

1058
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:40,842
After a a tremendous
showing of frozen frivolity,

1059
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:42,844
icy insight,

1060
00:54:42,975 --> 00:54:44,803
- and cold hard creativity...
- I got this.

1061
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:47,022
Don't worry.

1062
00:54:47,153 --> 00:54:50,374
The Kringle Kids have
jumped from 4th position

1063
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:52,376
to second position

1064
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:53,812
to advance to the final round.

1065
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:59,078
That's what I'm talking about!
Yeah!

1066
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,751
That's right the Kringle Kids
and the Blitzen Boys will

1067
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:04,692
face-off tomorrow at
the Harrison Falls Hockey Bowl

1068
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:07,608
for some good old fashioned
holiday ball hockey!

1069
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:14,180
Looks like you're still
in the game, fancy pants.

1070
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:17,226
Well, I don't wanna brag,
but it was my idea.

1071
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,099
Hey, we wouldn't have
won if it wasn't for Kit.

1072
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:23,232
Very true. Ice Pick Picasso
over here totally crushed it.

1073
00:55:23,363 --> 00:55:25,626
Thank you. Oh, I'm going
to go grab my bit box.

1074
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:26,975
I'll come.

1075
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:27,933
Your idea, huh?

1076
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,239
What?

1077
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,503
The "transformational growth"

1078
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:34,113
of Ebenezer Scrooge
as represented

1079
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:35,680
by a transforming butterfly?

1080
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,367
It's so weird.
Where'd you get that idea?

1081
00:55:37,464 --> 00:55:39,466
Yeah. It's just great, right?

1082
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:42,730
You know what? I'm gonna treat
you to a consolation cocoa.

1083
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:44,602
Mm-hm.

1084
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:47,344
Yeah, I'm feeling more
like a you got lucky latte.

1085
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:49,433
Hm.

1086
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:02,141
Everything is better here.

1087
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:05,362
Christmas. The town. The people.

1088
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:06,972
Even this hot chocolate
tastes better.

1089
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:08,669
What's in this stuff?

1090
00:56:08,756 --> 00:56:11,455
I don't know what
they put in yours.

1091
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:13,152
Ooh!

1092
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,025
Oh!

1093
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:35,957
I may never go back to LA.

1094
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:38,743
Okay, right.

1095
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:41,876
I mean, I don't really
need to be there anymore.

1096
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:43,661
Everything works
remotely nowadays...

1097
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,619
Wait, you're not serious.

1098
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:50,363
Well, I don't know.
I'm just so happy, Mac.

1099
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:54,672
I mean, I feel like I can
actually breathe again.

1100
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:57,718
You are. You are serious.

1101
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:00,001
I mean, there's this movie
I've been waiting to hear about

1102
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:01,350
that would take me to
Prague for a few months.

1103
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:03,332
Oh, wow. Okay.

1104
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:07,511
I've been obsessed with it,
actually, about getting it,

1105
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:09,402
but now I'm not even sure
I want the gig anymore,

1106
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,949
which sounds insane to say.

1107
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:13,081
So, you don't
want the movie now?

1108
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:16,128
I just kinda wanna be with you.

1109
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:20,959
I'm crazy about you, Mac.

1110
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:26,573
Whoa.

1111
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,792
Whoa?

1112
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:32,903
Those are some pretty
big declarations, Chase.

1113
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,975
Well, I have some
big feelings, Mac.

1114
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:40,108
Last night was perfect.
Wasn't it?

1115
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:43,851
Um, of course it was. I...

1116
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:47,855
Just so we're clear though,
are we talking, like,

1117
00:57:47,986 --> 00:57:49,683
"Science fair in Poughkeepsie"
perfect?

1118
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:53,208
'Cause I'm just trying to
manage expectations here.

1119
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:54,471
What's going on, Mac?

1120
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:03,697
You just have this history of
getting swept up in the moment

1121
00:58:03,828 --> 00:58:06,744
and shining your very
bright light on people

1122
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:09,398
and then, you know,
moving on when the moment ends

1123
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:11,488
and leaving bodies in your wake.

1124
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:16,493
I don't think that that's fair.

1125
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,016
Really?

1126
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:22,716
Come on.

1127
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:26,981
I was everything to you
on that science fair trip

1128
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:30,942
and then we got home
and I wasn't anymore.

1129
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:34,815
I was back to Pre-med,

1130
00:58:34,946 --> 00:58:36,208
your quirky little lab partner.

1131
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:41,082
Look, it's fine.

1132
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:43,476
It's fine, I promise.

1133
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:45,173
We were young,
we didn't know any better,

1134
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,306
but I'm...

1135
00:58:47,436 --> 00:58:50,614
I'm just telling you right now
that I cannot do that again.

1136
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:53,530
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1137
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:01,538
The truth is...

1138
00:59:04,149 --> 00:59:05,389
I liked you a lot back then.

1139
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:09,067
I was scared.

1140
00:59:09,197 --> 00:59:10,566
I didn't know what to
do with those feelings.

1141
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:14,681
So, I was dumb and I ran, and...

1142
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:21,166
I've always regretted that.

1143
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:29,653
You sure it had nothing to do
with the fact that I was me

1144
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:32,481
and you were you
and when we got back to school

1145
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,527
we didn't really fit?

1146
00:59:34,614 --> 00:59:37,922
'Cause I'm still me...

1147
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:44,276
and this amazing little

1148
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:46,539
holiday bubble
we're in right now

1149
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:48,106
will eventually burst.

1150
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,287
This isn't your real life, Chase.

1151
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:03,034
Maybe I want it to be.

1152
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,082
All I know is I just
want to be around you.

1153
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:14,741
So... please...

1154
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:18,440
give me a chance
to redeem myself.

1155
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:22,053
Please.

1156
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:25,709
Please? Please? Please?

1157
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,449
Please? Please? Come on.

1158
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,341
Cins of Harrison Falls,

1159
01:00:49,471 --> 01:00:51,343
Citizens of Harrison Falls,

1160
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:54,389
it is time

1161
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,391
for holiday ball hockey!

1162
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:01,745
One, two, three!

1163
01:01:06,924 --> 01:01:08,360
- Pre-med.
- Fancy Pants.

1164
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:11,232
- It's on.
- You're mine.

1165
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:12,581
Ah, come on!

1166
01:01:12,712 --> 01:01:13,800
There you go!

1167
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:15,193
Yes!

1168
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:20,415
Go, go, go, go!

1169
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:23,680
Whoo!

1170
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:27,553
Yeah!

1171
01:01:34,038 --> 01:01:35,213
Get it! Get it!

1172
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:39,521
Dancing the night away

1173
01:01:39,608 --> 01:01:40,740
Let's go!

1174
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:42,568
Whoo!

1175
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:48,226
Oh, yeah!

1176
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:49,880
Simon:
Can you believe it, folks?

1177
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:53,144
A tie game after
the third period!

1178
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:54,928
You know what that means,

1179
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:57,975
sudden death overtime!

1180
01:01:58,105 --> 01:02:00,064
That's right!

1181
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:03,415
Whoever scores first brings
home the Kris Kringle Cup!

1182
01:02:11,858 --> 01:02:13,904
All right, guys, change of plan.

1183
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:16,907
It is sorry to say that
I am not in ball hockey shape.

1184
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:18,691
So, I'm gonna take the net.

1185
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,582
That's a good idea.
Me and Kit will tire them out

1186
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:22,406
and I'll look for a weakness
in their defense.

1187
01:02:22,477 --> 01:02:24,797
I don't know how much longer I
can keep up with these kids.

1188
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:27,656
You're just sitting in the net.
We're the ones chasing them!

1189
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,895
Okay, they got
youth on their side,

1190
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:30,311
but we got experience, right?

1191
01:02:30,398 --> 01:02:31,718
So, no need
to get too aggressive.

1192
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,923
We just play our game...

1193
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,446
Tough D, we fill the lanes,

1194
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,230
wait for them to make
a mistake. Yeah?

1195
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:37,797
You got it, kiddo.

1196
01:02:37,928 --> 01:02:39,538
- Kringle on three?
- Chief on three?

1197
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:41,061
All: One, two, three...

1198
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:42,454
- Chief!
- Kringle!

1199
01:02:46,893 --> 01:02:49,461
Ooh! Good job, guys. What?

1200
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:52,812
This is amazing.

1201
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:55,510
It's like The Mighty Ducks
meets Grumpy Old Men.

1202
01:02:55,597 --> 01:02:57,358
This is so inspirational.
We gotta develop this.

1203
01:02:57,382 --> 01:03:01,255
Teri... what is happening?

1204
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:02,474
I'm just spitballing.

1205
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:04,781
What are you doing here?

1206
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:06,086
That's a very good question.

1207
01:03:06,173 --> 01:03:07,696
What in the world

1208
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:08,848
would make me leave
my beautiful family

1209
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:11,222
on the day before Christmas Eve

1210
01:03:11,352 --> 01:03:14,225
and fly all the way to
God-knows-wheresville, Indiana

1211
01:03:14,312 --> 01:03:15,574
or where ever this place is?

1212
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:16,769
Wait. Wait.
Did I get the part?

1213
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,142
Heck yeah, you did!

1214
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:20,231
Bring it in, brother! Hoo-hoo!

1215
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:22,276
That... that's...

1216
01:03:22,363 --> 01:03:24,496
Wow, that's... that's...
That's great.

1217
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:27,455
You don't seem excited.
Why aren't you excited?

1218
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:29,806
No, no. I am, I am. I just...

1219
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:31,198
- you know...
- Okay, okay.

1220
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:32,852
Wait till you
hear the deal. Okay?

1221
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,593
- Okay.
- Three picture deal,

1222
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,377
back-end participaish,

1223
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:38,597
and an up front fee

1224
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:40,120
that puts you in
the big leagues.

1225
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:41,948
Yeah, I told Brad,

1226
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,708
and he was pumped...
and he was a little bit jealous.

1227
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:47,780
Oh. Uh...

1228
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:49,956
I-I just can't
believe you're here.

1229
01:03:50,087 --> 01:03:51,871
Genius move by the way.

1230
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:54,352
Playing that
small-town hero stuff?

1231
01:03:54,439 --> 01:03:56,049
The Gram is, like, going off

1232
01:03:56,136 --> 01:03:58,138
with videos of you
connecting with the normals.

1233
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:00,140
I mean,

1234
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:01,533
caroling at the hospital?

1235
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:03,274
Who are you?

1236
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:05,102
George Bailey?

1237
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:08,018
Keep it up, though;
it's totally working for you.

1238
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:09,691
All that heat, that's probably
what tipped the scales

1239
01:04:09,715 --> 01:04:11,978
with the studio.

1240
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:15,416
Oh. Terri, thank you so much.

1241
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:18,245
Um, but I gotta go.

1242
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:20,812
Okay. Just don't go falling for
the local librarian, all right?

1243
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,511
Hah!

1244
01:04:23,642 --> 01:04:25,078
- Later!
- Later.

1245
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,124
- Big League!
- Thank you.

1246
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,777
See ya.

1247
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:30,214
Peanuts!

1248
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:34,609
We're
officially into overtime, folks.

1249
01:04:34,696 --> 01:04:37,830
Mac Graves clearly
done playing games.

1250
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:41,399
She is ready to end this
thing once and for all.

1251
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:47,405
Very aggressive move
by the five-time champion.

1252
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:49,276
Mac!

1253
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,800
Right away,
Mac Graves is on the attack!

1254
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,541
I'm open!

1255
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:04,291
Oh!

1256
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:07,338
Goal!

1257
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:08,905
It's all over, folks!

1258
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:12,299
Mac Graves with
the game-winning Goal!

1259
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:14,649
And the Blitzen Boys
bring home the cup...

1260
01:05:14,736 --> 01:05:15,955
once again.

1261
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:17,435
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1262
01:05:17,565 --> 01:05:19,741
Are you okay?
Hey, your head.

1263
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:21,613
I'm, uh... I'm...

1264
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:23,136
Okay.

1265
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:24,659
All right, look at me.
Look at me.

1266
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,445
- It's just my wrist.
- I'm fine.

1267
01:05:27,532 --> 01:05:29,664
I'm fine. I just feel
a little lightheaded.

1268
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:32,493
Follow my finger.
Follow my finger. You got it?

1269
01:05:32,624 --> 01:05:34,800
Oh, that's not so bad.

1270
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:36,454
No! Chase!

1271
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:41,043
Saul? Saul? Saul?
What's going on?

1272
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:43,504
- No, I'm okay. I'm okay.
- You're okay?

1273
01:05:43,591 --> 01:05:44,505
All right, well, let me check,
let me check. This one?

1274
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:46,116
Saul: Yeah.

1275
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:47,528
- All right, hang on.
- Okay. Okay.

1276
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:49,162
Oh! Ow.

1277
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:51,010
Okay. Yeah, We need to
get them both checked out.

1278
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:52,794
- Help me get them to my car.
- Yeah. Come on, old-timer.

1279
01:05:52,818 --> 01:05:53,938
- Chase?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1280
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:56,213
Slowly, slowly. You good?

1281
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,910
- I'm fine. Okay?
- Yeah?

1282
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,738
Mac...

1283
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:00,957
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

1284
01:06:02,784 --> 01:06:04,482
Oh!

1285
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:07,180
Possible hairline
wrist fracture on Saul here.

1286
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:08,636
Don't make a fuss.
My legs still work.

1287
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,009
And this one has a head lac.

1288
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:11,378
Guys, I really don't
need a wheelchair.

1289
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:13,099
- I'm fine.
- Any nausea or emesis?

1290
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:15,295
No, but he did loose
consciousness for a few seconds.

1291
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:16,818
That's only because
I stood up too fast.

1292
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:18,191
Pupils are equal and reactive,

1293
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:19,647
but he'll most
likely need some stitches.

1294
01:06:19,671 --> 01:06:20,889
Let's get them checked out.

1295
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:21,997
Thanks, Mac,
we'll take it from here.

1296
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:26,417
Yeah.

1297
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,724
Oh. Oh. I come in peace.

1298
01:07:12,854 --> 01:07:14,378
Don't throw a candle at me.

1299
01:07:14,508 --> 01:07:15,814
I'm unarmed.

1300
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:17,729
Are you okay?

1301
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:19,861
I'm fine.
My head's been through worse.

1302
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:22,821
CI... I can't even begin

1303
01:07:22,908 --> 01:07:25,041
to express how sorry
and mortified I am.

1304
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:31,612
Come on, it was an accident.

1305
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:33,397
I mean,
I hope it was an accident.

1306
01:07:33,484 --> 01:07:35,051
It was an accident, right?

1307
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:36,617
Yeah, obviously.
I'm not a monster.

1308
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:38,750
I just was mad. I...

1309
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,232
Yeah. Yeah, I got that. At me?

1310
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:46,149
No. No. I... yes.

1311
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:48,151
Not...

1312
01:07:48,281 --> 01:07:52,720
And... I think I'm more
just mad at myself.

1313
01:07:52,807 --> 01:07:55,854
You and I were both supposed
to have these epic lives,

1314
01:07:55,984 --> 01:07:58,161
and you've had the guts
to go out and do it,

1315
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:00,511
and I'm just... I don't even...

1316
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:02,165
I don't even know.

1317
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:09,824
Well, at least you won the
Reindeer Games again.

1318
01:08:09,955 --> 01:08:11,696
Congrats, champ.

1319
01:08:11,783 --> 01:08:13,567
I don't care about the games.

1320
01:08:13,698 --> 01:08:15,893
You sure? 'Cause the four
stitches on the side of my head

1321
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:17,441
tell a very different story.

1322
01:08:20,574 --> 01:08:24,056
I do this. I do this every year,

1323
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:26,067
thinking that, somehow,
if I just win the games,

1324
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:28,800
I'll... I'll...

1325
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:30,889
feel closer to Pop or something,

1326
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:33,457
and then, I'll have Christmas
with my family again,

1327
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:35,763
and then I'll finally be
ready to move on,

1328
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,156
to get back to my life.

1329
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:39,506
And every year I win,
and it never...

1330
01:08:39,637 --> 01:08:42,988
It just... It just leaves me
feeling more stuck.

1331
01:08:47,035 --> 01:08:49,342
I'm stuck, Chase,

1332
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:52,737
living in his house,
playing this game he loved,

1333
01:08:52,824 --> 01:08:54,391
with his friends,

1334
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:56,118
just desperately trying
to keep him alive,

1335
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:57,916
when he isn't.

1336
01:08:58,003 --> 01:08:59,918
He isn't alive.

1337
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:12,670
You still can't open it?

1338
01:09:15,673 --> 01:09:19,111
If I do...

1339
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:22,636
If I do, that's it,

1340
01:09:22,767 --> 01:09:24,856
I'll never hear from him again.

1341
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:27,989
I'll have to let him go,

1342
01:09:28,076 --> 01:09:30,253
and I don't want to let him go.

1343
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,168
I miss him so much.

1344
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,963
Look...

1345
01:09:45,093 --> 01:09:48,488
I don't know what
your dad said in that letter,

1346
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:52,144
but whatever it was,

1347
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:54,407
he's waited a really
long time for you to hear it.

1348
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:02,154
Maybe it's time
for you to listen.

1349
01:10:10,423 --> 01:10:11,990
I...

1350
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,079
I-I can't open it.

1351
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:54,728
Chief Graves:
"My dearest Mac,

1352
01:10:54,815 --> 01:10:57,035
"I'm so proud
of you, I could burst.

1353
01:10:57,122 --> 01:10:59,472
"Ask the boys;

1354
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:02,127
"they can't get me to shut up
about my daughter, the doctor!"

1355
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:07,001
"You've got a big brain.
Everyone knows that about you.

1356
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:10,396
"But what's gonna make you truly great

1357
01:11:10,527 --> 01:11:13,486
"is your heart, and my girl,

1358
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:16,228
"you've got one of
the biggest ones out there.

1359
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:19,275
"I'm so lucky that
I got to be your Pop."

1360
01:11:22,669 --> 01:11:25,281
"Don't forget...

1361
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:28,153
"the reason you heal people
is to help them live,

1362
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,722
"not to just
keep them breathing.

1363
01:11:31,809 --> 01:11:35,291
"So, don't forget to
keep living yourself.

1364
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:37,641
"Work hard and play harder.

1365
01:11:37,728 --> 01:11:40,818
"Take chances and
make a mistake or two.

1366
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:42,776
"You've got one wild
and precious life,

1367
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:45,910
"so laugh hard,

1368
01:11:45,997 --> 01:11:48,086
"and love big,

1369
01:11:48,173 --> 01:11:51,307
"and dive in.

1370
01:11:51,437 --> 01:11:54,658
"I love ya to the
moon and back, kiddo,

1371
01:11:54,745 --> 01:11:57,835
"always have, always will.

1372
01:11:57,922 --> 01:12:00,664
"Merry Christmas. Pop."

1373
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:12,110
So?

1374
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:16,723
I know what I need to do.

1375
01:12:16,854 --> 01:12:18,595
Oh, yeah?

1376
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:24,601
Thank you, Chase.

1377
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:29,954
You're... welcome.

1378
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:33,871
I... I want you to have
the best time on your movie.

1379
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:36,874
It was so good to see you.

1380
01:12:37,962 --> 01:12:40,356
Wait. Wait.

1381
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:42,401
What just happened?
This isn't...

1382
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:44,272
goodbye.

1383
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:46,449
I'm the...

1384
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:47,817
local librarian
you're not supposed to fall for.

1385
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:52,455
Mac, no that was
Terri just... being Teri.

1386
01:12:52,585 --> 01:12:54,413
- I don't feel that way.
- No. You don't now.

1387
01:12:54,544 --> 01:12:56,372
But come on, Chase,
she's not wrong.

1388
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:57,808
No, Mac. Don't do this.

1389
01:12:57,895 --> 01:12:59,351
Don't shut this down
before we even try.

1390
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,507
I loved our little
holiday bubble.

1391
01:13:01,594 --> 01:13:04,423
It was magic.

1392
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:07,818
But now,
I gotta return to reality.

1393
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:10,516
Plus, you got your
thing in Prague, and...

1394
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:13,824
and I'm about to go after mine.

1395
01:13:13,911 --> 01:13:17,088
So, I think its best
if we just leave it.

1396
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:24,574
We'll always have Poughkeepsie.

1397
01:13:29,883 --> 01:13:31,755
Okay.

1398
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:46,204
How's your head?

1399
01:13:46,334 --> 01:13:49,294
Jeremy just filled me in.

1400
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:51,122
And so did the internet.

1401
01:13:55,213 --> 01:13:56,562
She looks mad.

1402
01:13:56,649 --> 01:13:58,259
What did you do
to make her so mad?

1403
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:01,654
It's a long,

1404
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:03,439
sad story, but it's...

1405
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:06,746
Over.

1406
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,008
No, it's not.

1407
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:09,793
Oh, I assure you, it is.

1408
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,968
Come here.

1409
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:21,326
Ow!

1410
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,720
Serena! I'm injured!

1411
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:25,007
I told you not to be an idiot!

1412
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:26,374
Seriously?

1413
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:27,811
Okay, little brother,

1414
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:29,943
I gave birth,
like, two minutes ago,

1415
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:33,077
and I need a nap, so I'm gonna
make this real quick.

1416
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:35,166
Over the past few days,

1417
01:14:35,253 --> 01:14:38,386
I've watched you light up
from the inside out.

1418
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:42,260
I've watched you put your phone
down and truly connect again.

1419
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:45,263
And I'm pretty sure we both know
who's responsible for that.

1420
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:48,440
I have made my feelings
for Mac very clear,

1421
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:50,703
but she does not want me.

1422
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,357
Oh, yes, she does.

1423
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,404
She absolutely does.

1424
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,773
She just doesn't think you would
ever actually choose her,

1425
01:14:58,798 --> 01:15:02,410
which is stupid because she's
amazing and you should so lucky.

1426
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,543
And if you hurt her,

1427
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:07,590
you will have to reckon
with me, Chase Weston.

1428
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:08,982
And that is not a thing

1429
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:10,854
you're gonna wanna have to do.

1430
01:15:10,941 --> 01:15:12,856
And congratulations
on the baby, Serena.

1431
01:15:12,943 --> 01:15:16,860
I have been meaning to come by.
She is so cute.

1432
01:15:18,862 --> 01:15:20,448
Does anyone else want to
weigh in on the situation?

1433
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:23,519
He's right...

1434
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:26,217
about her wanting you, and about
the other part, also,

1435
01:15:26,304 --> 01:15:28,611
except that you're gonna
have me to deal with, as well.

1436
01:15:28,698 --> 01:15:30,351
I may be old, but I can still

1437
01:15:30,438 --> 01:15:32,005
throw my weight
around in a scrap.

1438
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:35,487
He's my ride.

1439
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:40,492
And I was eavesdropping.

1440
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:41,972
Great.

1441
01:15:42,102 --> 01:15:43,451
Is that everyone?

1442
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,547
I'm with them, Uncle Chase.

1443
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:53,940
Phenomenal.

1444
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:55,638
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

1445
01:15:57,770 --> 01:16:00,251
Well, I think
I'm gonna need some help.

1446
01:16:16,049 --> 01:16:19,052
The holly and the ivy

1447
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:23,317
When they are both full grown

1448
01:16:23,448 --> 01:16:27,234
Of all the trees
there in the wood

1449
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:30,455
The holly bears the crown.

1450
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,894
The rising of the sun

1451
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:39,464
And the running of the deer,

1452
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:44,382
The playing of the merry organ

1453
01:16:44,469 --> 01:16:47,080
Sweet singing of the choir

1454
01:16:48,952 --> 01:16:52,433
Sweet singing of the choir

1455
01:17:00,267 --> 01:17:01,268
Hey.

1456
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:03,270
Why aren't you getting dressed?

1457
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:04,508
What do you mean? The award
ceremony isn't till later.

1458
01:17:04,532 --> 01:17:06,012
Okay, let's go.

1459
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:08,493
What? Simon! What?

1460
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,974
Uh, Simon, what are you...
What are you doing?

1461
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:14,934
Okay.

1462
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:17,110
Mm-hmm. Uh...

1463
01:17:17,197 --> 01:17:19,635
Ugh. Why don't you
have anything cute?

1464
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:21,767
Excuse me?

1465
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:25,336
I swear to god, this is my one
failure as your best friend.

1466
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:27,860
Ugh. So much flannel.

1467
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:29,142
Okay, what is happening
right now?

1468
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:31,255
Oh! This could work.

1469
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:33,561
Oh, these heels are nice.

1470
01:17:33,692 --> 01:17:35,738
Simon, stop being weird.

1471
01:17:35,825 --> 01:17:38,262
I need you to do something for
me and it's not negotiable.

1472
01:17:38,349 --> 01:17:39,742
Okay?

1473
01:17:39,829 --> 01:17:41,744
I need you to put on this dress,

1474
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:43,833
and these heels,

1475
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,506
and put on a little makeup,
and do your hair,

1476
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:47,160
and be ready for the boys
to pick you up at 6:30.

1477
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:48,378
Why does it matter what I wear?

1478
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:49,562
Do not question me right now!

1479
01:17:49,621 --> 01:17:51,492
It's Christmas Eve,

1480
01:17:51,579 --> 01:17:53,843
and you are
the Kringle Cup Champion,

1481
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,758
and I want you to look cute!

1482
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:56,846
Is that too much to ask?

1483
01:17:56,976 --> 01:17:59,152
No?

1484
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:00,980
Good. Well then,
my work here is done.

1485
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:03,983
This dress, those heels,
hair, makeup.

1486
01:18:06,246 --> 01:18:07,987
6:30 sharp!

1487
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,782
What?

1488
01:18:31,141 --> 01:18:32,466
"Reindeer Games

Oh my gosh.

"I'm sorry I didn't fight

Well, you got that
done in record time.

I'm pretty good at games.

at a lot of stuff.

you would give me
a chance to redeem my...

01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,913
I'm sorry. Um...
Were you...

1557
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,741
Were you saying something?

1558
01:24:13,265 --> 01:24:15,876
Yeah. I had
a whole speech prepared,

1559
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:20,185
and now my brain's a little
foggy for some reason.

1560
01:24:20,316 --> 01:24:24,494
I'm sorry. There was a
scavenger hunt and a speech?

1561
01:24:24,624 --> 01:24:26,670
I'm pretty good at stuff, too.

1562
01:24:28,672 --> 01:24:30,326
I love you.

1563
01:24:30,413 --> 01:24:32,328
Yeah?

1564
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:34,112
Mm-hmm.

1565
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:37,724
Well, I'm glad we're
finally on the same page.

1566
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:50,041
Okay. How do we gonna do this?

1567
01:24:50,128 --> 01:24:52,043
You in Prague,
me in Boston, maybe?

1568
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:55,612
Whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa Time-out. Your residency?

1569
01:24:55,742 --> 01:24:57,831
Well, I reached out.
We'll see.

1570
01:24:57,918 --> 01:25:00,138
Yeah, you did! That's the
Pre-med I know and love!

1571
01:25:00,269 --> 01:25:01,966
Yes!

1572
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:05,230
I don't know.

1573
01:25:05,317 --> 01:25:07,058
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

1574
01:25:07,145 --> 01:25:08,407
- Yeah?
- Whatever it takes

1575
01:25:08,538 --> 01:25:09,843
'cause I love you,

1576
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:13,282

1577
01:25:13,369 --> 01:25:15,022
all the way in,

1578
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,112
if you are.

1579
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:23,205
I can physically
see your wheels turning.

1580
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:24,380
What are you doing?

1581
01:25:24,467 --> 01:25:27,470
It's just...

1582
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,603
Oh, my heart is screaming yes,
but my brain is freaking out.

1583
01:25:34,912 --> 01:25:38,307
So, just turn your
brain off and jump.

1584
01:25:50,014 --> 01:25:52,886
They're kissing!
I think it worked!

1585
01:25:53,017 --> 01:25:55,498
Yeah!

1586
01:25:58,675 --> 01:26:00,894
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1587
01:26:01,025 --> 01:26:03,854
Come on, you two, get in here.

1588
01:26:03,941 --> 01:26:05,856
Come and claim
this Kris Kringle Cup!

1589
01:26:08,554 --> 01:26:12,167
Merry Christmas, Fancy Pants.

1590
01:26:12,254 --> 01:26:16,083
Merry Christmas, Pre-med.

1591
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,912
Technically, I actually finished
med school a while ago,

1592
01:26:18,999 --> 01:26:22,525
so you're gonna have to
think up a new nickname.

1593
01:26:22,655 --> 01:26:25,092
Oh, well,
I will get right on that,

1594
01:26:25,223 --> 01:26:27,399
- Smarty-pants.
- Oh!

1595
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:29,271
We share this
special time of year

1596
01:26:31,969 --> 01:26:35,886
The songs we sing,
the bells that ring

1597
01:26:35,973 --> 01:26:37,627
The cookies, cakes, and caroling

1598
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:41,805
Oh, I'm so happy
the season's back again
