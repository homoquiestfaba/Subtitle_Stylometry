1
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:59,535
My best friend Lily
thought she was drowning.

2
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:01,876
Drowning in the Salton Sea.

3
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:10,086
Even though the water was
too polluted to step foot in

4
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:15,114
and left everything in our
town either dying or dead.

5
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,333
Lily?

6
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,730
Are you okay?

7
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:31,898
Hello?

8
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:37,945
Lily was determined
to never let it get her.

9
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,134
I'll see you later, okay?

10
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,712
Hey, Aunt Bonnie!
Good morning.

11
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:33,275
You're like a fucking tornado, kid.
You know that?

12
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:36,117
There's my poor little cousin.
You're late.

13
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,248
Did you get my cigs?
Yeah.

14
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:43,061
These come open now?

15
00:03:45,798 --> 00:03:49,825
Hey, handsome.
Shh. Shh.

16
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,605
You trying to burp him
or break his neck?

17
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,641
God, I really can't
do anything right today.

18
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,076
Well, I don't want him ending up
with shaken kid syndrome.

19
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:02,738
I might be
doing him a favor.

20
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,977
What does that mean?

21
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:08,178
Huh?

22
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:22,992
You want this?
Hmm?

23
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:26,229
Yeah, yum.

24
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:29,965
Look at the cartoons.
What's happening?

25
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,269
Look, he's thinking
about a bird.

26
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:35,037
He's flying like a bird.
Can you do that?

27
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:41,748
Lily.
What?

28
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:45,776
Get off your ass and grab
your uncle 's Epsom salts.

29
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:48,823
I got to go help out
your mama, little one.

30
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,172
Lily!

31
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:25,018
You wanna hand me the salt?

32
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:41,129
Sorry.

33
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:26,010
Hogan says the fish
don't die from pollution,

34
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:32,314
because when the algae blooms,
it sucks up all the oxygen.

35
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,286
and then the fish suffocate.

36
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:38,515
That's boring.

37
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:43,522
I don't think so.

38
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:54,771
You're such a baby.

39
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,670
I'm two months
older than you.

40
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,976
The train's coming.

41
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,152
Come on.

42
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,096
What are you doing?

43
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:24,999
Is baby scared?

44
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,626
Do you want mommy
to sing you your song?

45
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:28,671
Cut it out.

46
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:31,297
# Hush little baby,
don't say-- #

47
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,465
Stop it!

48
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,669
Come here.
No.

49
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:43,782
# Mommy's gonna buy you a mockingbird #
Cut it out.

50
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:48,686
# And if that
mockingbird don't sing #

51
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:51,418
# mommy's gonna
buy you a... #

52
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:32,889
Lily, is that you?

53
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:34,363
Yeah.

54
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,834
Oh, hey, Ali, how are you?
Good.

55
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,461
It's Alison, Mom. We're not, like,
five years old anymore.

56
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:43,563
I didn't realize you guys were so grown up now.
She's staying for dinner too.

57
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,473
Oh, actually, I was gonna
go cook my dad dinner.

58
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,534
Oh, how is your dad?
Oh, he's good.

59
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,978
He found some copper wire--
Have you seen my black pumps?

60
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,811
Are they up your ass?

61
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:57,319
No, Lily, I don't believe
they are up my ass.

62
00:08:57,386 --> 00:09:00,253
You're such a spazz.
You interrupted Alison.

63
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:01,756
I'm sorry, Ali.

64
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,313
That's fine.
It's Alison, Mom.

65
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:07,327
Alison. Your dad
found some wires?

66
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:12,059
I was just trying to say he's good.
Same as always.

67
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:15,500
That's good. Well, tell him I say hi.
Yeah.

68
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,332
Was that so hard?

69
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:19,201
Since when did you
become Miss Manners?

70
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:21,207
For once someone's gotta
be civilized in this house.

71
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,334
Why don't you
help me find my shoes?

72
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:16,416
So I'm going to go meet
some friends at the bar.

73
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:20,156
And don't forget, we have
your appointment tomorrow. Fuck.

74
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,062
And we can't cancel
because I lose money

75
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:26,067
every time we don't
cancel 24 hours in advance.

76
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:28,160
It's such a waste
of time, Mom.

77
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:30,228
Don't say that.

78
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:54,919
You need to talk to someone, kiddo.
You need to.

79
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:57,088
And you're surely
not talking to me.

80
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:59,496
I talk to you every day.

81
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:07,669
I just want to understand
why you did it.

82
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,641
Did what, Mother?
You know what.

83
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:15,203
I'm sorry, Mother,
but I surely don't.

84
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:17,077
Why did you
cut your Ieg?

85
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,686
I was shaving.

86
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:33,923
I guess I'm just
not that good at it yet.

87
00:11:40,304 --> 00:11:42,897
Okay, your appointment
is tomorrow at 10.

88
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,267
I got you somethin'.

89
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:17,461
Yeah?

90
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,074
It's in your room.

91
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,135
Thanks.

92
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,360
Hey! Does this look okay?
I have to get ready.

93
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:54,563
Can you give me some space to fucking
pee by myself, please?

94
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,766
You know, stop saying the word "fuck"
so much. You sound--

95
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:58,900
Well, then will you
give me some privacy, Mom?

96
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,910
I'm just asking,
does this look cute?

97
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:04,105
I don't know. I don't know.
Does this dress look cute?

98
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,204
You look old!

99
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:28,960
You should
take down your hair.

100
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:30,339
You seem bored.

101
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:37,722
I don't understand
why I'm being punished.

102
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,453
What makes you think
you're being punished?

103
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:44,017
I'm here, aren't I?

104
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,586
Well, what would
you rather be doing

105
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:51,226
instead of sitting
here with me?

106
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:55,398
I don't know. Shooting myself
in the face?

107
00:15:55,473 --> 00:15:58,873
Dousing myself with gasoline
and lighting a match.

108
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,968
It's funny how you often
mention hurting yourself.

109
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:05,615
Thanks. I thought
I was funny, too.

110
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,479
No, I guess I meant ironic.

111
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:14,589
But with your father and all,
it's interesting.

112
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:16,921
Your mom's interesting too.

113
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:20,655
I'm curious about
the structure she provides.

114
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,755
Have you seen any drug use?

115
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,390
Does she have a boyfriend?

116
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:34,334
I'm trying to help, Lily.

117
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:43,281
Why do you think
you cut your legs?

118
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,749
Why don't you
just cut it off?

119
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:47,252
Cut what out?
Cut it off.

120
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:51,984
Off? Yeah, the hair
on your face.

121
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:54,083
Are you talking
about my mole?

122
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,721
That fucking gross
thing on your chin.

123
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:03,162
We're here to talk
about you, Lily.

124
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:06,432
How am I supposed to talk when I feel
like I'm gonna barf?

125
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:25,955
How'd it go? Yeah, it was great.
I think it's really starting to help.

126
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:37,257
Do ever feel like
you're going to die?

127
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:43,635
Like in a car crash?

128
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,305
Yeah.

129
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:48,536
Like...

130
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:52,912
I don't know.

131
00:17:56,818 --> 00:18:00,515
Like the seaweed Hogan
was talking about.

132
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:02,078
Algae.

133
00:18:06,594 --> 00:18:09,460
I feel like something's
stealing all my air.

134
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:14,060
That's messed up.

135
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:21,405
Hey! Cut the shit!
It ain't yours.

136
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,941
So, it ain't yours neither, and I hope it
bites your face off.

137
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,500
I hope he bites
your tits off.

138
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:29,241
Stupid fucker!

139
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,283
You touch that dog again
and I'll burn down

140
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,341
your fucking
welfare ass trailer.

141
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,355
They took the baby
for the day.

142
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:42,757
They took Mark
for the day.

143
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:45,728
Probably going to parade him
around the neighborhood.

144
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,924
Our son, the war hero.

145
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:51,230
He is a war hero.

146
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:53,132
Great.

147
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:55,137
Give me his medal in one hand
and shit in the other.

148
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:57,696
See what I got.
Fuck.

149
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:01,141
That whole table there is 40 percent
off for just today.

150
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:03,144
Thanks.

151
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,043
Till death
do you part, right?

152
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:12,482
Mark died the day some sand nigger buried
an IED in a garbage can.

153
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:15,422
What they sent home...

154
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:17,720
I don't know what that is,
but it's not my husband.

155
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:31,463
Did you get
lipstick all over me?

156
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,563
Look, it's the Bobbsey Twins.

157
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,939
Aw, they're like
a little cartoon duo.

158
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,001
Lily and Ali and the case
of the haunted mansion.

159
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:40,342
She doesn't want
to be called Ali anymore.

160
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,506
What does
she wanna be called?

161
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:42,810
Alison.

162
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,077
Oh, excuse me.

163
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,449
Lily and Alison in the case
of the haunted mansion.

164
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,819
Jesus Christ. Come sit next
to your old mom.

165
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,687
I've got
a mystery for you.

166
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,727
Who's shit-faced at two o'clock
in the afternoon?

167
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,728
Guilty as charged, Scooby Doo.
That's right. Yeah!

168
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,993
You Iook cute. Maybe you should do
something with this hair, though.

169
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,162
Like put a deep conditioner
on it or something.

170
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,298
Wow. You know what? You should do
something with your face, okay?

171
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,170
That's not nice.
Can we dress up?

172
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:13,301
No, I have to
sell this stuff. Why?

173
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:15,368
You can use
the things over there.

174
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:17,311
No, I wanna
use this stuff.

175
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:18,973
Don't use
the feather thing.

176
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,144
Why? It's the best one.

177
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:25,153
Can I wear the skirt at least?
Yeah.

178
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:27,348
At least that one
picked something normal.

179
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:30,120
Look, I want to look
like a fuzzy alien.

180
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,924
At your service,
my fearless queen.

181
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,069
Lily! Lily!

182
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:25,133
My fearless queen,
don't you dare!

183
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:28,943
I'm going to push you
in the water.

184
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:30,743
Yes! Yes!

185
00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:35,775
No! No! No!
I'm melting.

186
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:38,789
Oh no! Don't die.

187
00:21:38,857 --> 00:21:40,324
It's too late.

188
00:21:43,794 --> 00:21:45,955
Here. Don't you
ever forget me.

189
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,692
Then, I'll put one on.

190
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:06,411
What's that sound?

191
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:07,380
I don't know.

192
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:11,680
Let's investigate.

193
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,501
My queen, you are alive!
Shh!

194
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,369
You look stupid.

195
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:36,429
You guys want some beers?

196
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:41,231
Sure.

197
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:43,133
Climb over then.

198
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:45,905
Lily.

199
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:26,902
What, are you, like
a raver or something?

200
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,277
What's that?

201
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:37,453
Somebody who
dresses all crazy.

202
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:40,012
No, it was just
this stupid thing.

203
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:45,857
I like your boots.
Yeah?

204
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:52,596
Yeah, I think they're cool.
Thanks.

205
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:11,714
You know, you can't find empty pools
like this in L.A. no more.

206
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:15,154
We heard about this spot
and drove all the way out.

207
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:19,091
But your town
smells like shit.

208
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,223
It's the salt influx from the sewage
and irrigation runoff.

209
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,464
Are you a scientist?

210
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,870
No.

211
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:44,115
See all this white stuff?
The sand?

212
00:25:44,183 --> 00:25:49,052
It's not really sand. It's dead fish
and bird bones.

213
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:52,952
Cool.

214
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:54,754
Yeah.

215
00:25:58,029 --> 00:25:59,724
So, you have
a boyfriend?

216
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:05,732
Jesse, let's
fucking go!

217
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,534
You cold?

218
00:26:21,518 --> 00:26:23,917
What the fuck?
Let's go.

219
00:26:27,056 --> 00:26:28,683
Thanks.

220
00:26:32,628 --> 00:26:33,754
Sorry.

221
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:48,967
If you're ever in L.A.

222
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:17,900
Sorry.

223
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,703
Bye, Lily.

224
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,642
Bye.

225
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:36,184
Woo!

226
00:27:57,706 --> 00:28:00,937
Where'd you go?

227
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:03,273
Didn't think
you'd notice I'd Ieft.

228
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:07,475
What's up your ass?

229
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:08,516
Nothing.

230
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,818
I kissed that boy.

231
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,790
Yeah?
Yeah.

232
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:22,723
I bet he's kissed
lots of other girls.

233
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:28,030
Maybe.

234
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,099
We're gonna
hang out in L.A.

235
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:37,472
How are you
getting there?

236
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:38,908
I don't know.

237
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:51,049
You can come along
if you want.

238
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:55,359
Maybe.

239
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,271
Hey, Tiger Lily.

240
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:28,114
I know you're awake.

241
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:34,118
Why do you always
have to touch me?

242
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:35,788
Because I didn't
get to hold you

243
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:40,460
for that whole
first month you were born.

244
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:46,564
You were stuck
in the incubator.

245
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,835
Your dad said that
you looked like

246
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:53,209
a little chicken who came
out of the oven too early.

247
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:02,310
Mom.

248
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:06,490
PIease, Mom.

249
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,964
Lily, what are
you doing here?

250
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:52,194
I figured it out. We're gonna take
Hogan's truck to L.A.

251
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:56,637
No way. He's never gonna notice.
It just, like, sits here all the time.

252
00:30:56,705 --> 00:30:59,435
Shh.
Hey, Lily.

253
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:02,534
You here
to unload some hay?

254
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,805
No.

255
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:07,109
Well, I hear work's
good for the soul.

256
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:08,876
My soul's beyond repair.

257
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,384
Think about it.

258
00:31:14,822 --> 00:31:17,016
I see that charm school
is really paying off.

259
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:19,791
She don't mean it.

260
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,626
She just doesn't
like living here.

261
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:27,599
Well, one day she'll realize
it's just geography.

262
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,192
Where's the furthest
you've ever been?

263
00:31:32,805 --> 00:31:35,467
Bora Bora.
No way.

264
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:38,738
I found work
on a freighter.

265
00:31:38,811 --> 00:31:42,474
We docked there
and I decided to stay.

266
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:44,674
Was it amazing?

267
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:48,276
I got a job at a resort
where this mangy dog

268
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:52,585
and her pup would hang around
begging for food.

269
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:54,488
The guest complained,
so the manager sent me

270
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,426
and this other guy, just a local,
out to get 'em.

271
00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:01,464
The mother, she trusted humans,
so she was easy.

272
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:06,469
But her pup, she was
a slippery little sucker.

273
00:32:06,537 --> 00:32:09,631
We couldn't get her
no matter how hard we tried.

274
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:14,302
We were supposed to take her out
to the bigger island,

275
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:17,813
about a 20-minute boat ride.

276
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,474
My co-worker wanted
to get home for dinner, though.

277
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,815
His wife was making
a Poisson Cru.

278
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:27,719
So he threw the dog off the boat
about halfway there.

279
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:29,780
Oh, my God!

280
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:31,951
That night
the whole island

281
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:34,018
could hear
that pup howling

282
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:37,531
and crying
for its mother.

283
00:32:37,598 --> 00:32:39,566
I traveled halfway
across the world

284
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:42,068
to find out
that people are

285
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:46,163
dumb and cruel everywhere.

286
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,935
I could've just stayed home.

287
00:33:12,331 --> 00:33:15,767
I went
to Aunt Bonnie's.

288
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:20,770
You weren't there.

289
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:22,669
Did you change your mind?

290
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:31,273
I can't, Lily.

291
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:34,310
I can't do that
to Hogan.

292
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,291
Fine.

293
00:33:52,935 --> 00:33:54,926
What's so great
about L.A. anyway?

294
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:01,767
It's not here.

295
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,374
Where are you going?

296
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:11,782
I don't know.

297
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,820
Can I come?

298
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,013
No.

299
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:13,203
You're ugly.
So?

300
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:16,711
So don't go walking around here acting
like you better than everybody else.

301
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:20,681
I don't. You told my brother you
was going to burn down my house?

302
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:23,547
No.
Liar.

303
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:25,780
I'm gonna ask your ass again.

304
00:35:25,854 --> 00:35:29,346
Did you tell my brother you was gonna
burn down my house?

305
00:35:31,392 --> 00:35:34,384
Don't look at that cunt.
Look at me! Look at me.

306
00:35:34,462 --> 00:35:36,362
No, I didn't say that.

307
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,496
Next time I see you

308
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:44,435
I'm gonna stab you in
your little frizzled head.

309
00:36:00,986 --> 00:36:01,975
Thanks a lot.

310
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:05,214
What was I
supposed to do?

311
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:12,922
I'm leaving tonight.

312
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:15,192
How?

313
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:18,827
I'll wait by the bar and get some
trucker or methhead to drive me.

314
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:22,669
Are you stupid? That'll get you dead
in a ditch somewhere.

315
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,833
Yeah, well, if I stay here,
Shawna's just gonna kill me anyway,

316
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:27,843
so, what's
the fucking difference?

317
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,434
I knew you'd
come through.

318
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:52,407
You're my best friend, stupid.

319
00:38:57,616 --> 00:39:00,210
Fuck you!

320
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:01,480
Woo!

321
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,557
What the fuck?
It's fine.

322
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:20,364
Did you just fall asleep?

323
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:25,101
It's three in the morning.
You're such a baby.

324
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:26,574
Fine, Lily,
why don't you drive?

325
00:39:26,643 --> 00:39:29,612
Oh wait,
nobody taught you how.

326
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,011
You don't have
to be a bitch about it.

327
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:35,414
I'm sorry. Let's just pull over
and sleep for a while.

328
00:39:41,657 --> 00:39:43,284
Do you remember
when we thought

329
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,384
that your mom
was gonna marry my dad

330
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:50,090
and we were gonna
be sisters for real?

331
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:52,030
Yeah. Then we realized
that your dad's, like,

332
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,762
100 years old
and super ugly.

333
00:39:57,004 --> 00:40:00,303
You're just upset because we saw
Darryl Baker's father

334
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:04,276
coming out of your
mom's room in his underwear.

335
00:40:04,345 --> 00:40:06,108
Oh, you cried.

336
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,738
You cried so hard
thinking that Darryl

337
00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:09,942
was gonna be
your brother instead.

338
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:25,819
Yeah, my mom was
gonna marry your dad.

339
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:29,390
And we were gonna
move to the beach.

340
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:33,336
A real beach
with a real ocean.

341
00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:35,305
And every morning
we would wake up

342
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:39,070
and roll out of bed and dive straight
into the water.

343
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:45,647
Yeah.

344
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:46,969
Hey.
Hey.

345
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,132
So Jesse said
we're not far out.

346
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:51,039
Woo-hoo.

347
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:55,046
He gave me an address
for where we got to meet them.

348
00:41:55,114 --> 00:41:57,047
Hey, where'd you
get those chips?

349
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,673
I bought them.

350
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,811
But I thought you
didn't have any money.

351
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:05,982
Fine. Whatever.
I stole them. Sue me.

352
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:09,390
Lily.
What?

353
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:11,928
Who cares, huh?

354
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,725
Something for you anyway.

355
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,227
Hypocrite.

356
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:31,607
Hey, I'm just kidding. Where are you going?
To pay for these.

357
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:35,082
No, if you pay for them,
they're gonna know I took them.

358
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:38,017
For the first time in your life, could
you just not be a baby?

359
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:46,356
No fucking way. No.

360
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:47,861
God damn it.

361
00:43:06,513 --> 00:43:09,949
Your friend send you back for more?
No, I was just putting it back.

362
00:43:10,016 --> 00:43:12,382
Do I look that fucking stupid?
No! I'm sorry, okay?

363
00:43:12,452 --> 00:43:14,283
We're gonna wait right here
for the police.

364
00:43:14,354 --> 00:43:16,254
No, please let me go.
You and your little girlfriend

365
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,119
come in here thinking the sun
shines out your asses.

366
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,919
Well, I got a rude
awakening for you, all right?

367
00:43:19,992 --> 00:43:21,118
This is
a citizen's arrest.

368
00:43:21,193 --> 00:43:23,058
Stand back!
Ow!

369
00:43:23,128 --> 00:43:24,117
Run!
Lily!

370
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:28,666
What the hell
are you doing?

371
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:29,325
Don't!

372
00:43:33,538 --> 00:43:36,006
Fucking, drive!
Come back here!

373
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:38,474
Go, go, go!
Come on!

374
00:43:38,543 --> 00:43:40,477
Shit.

375
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:42,308
Fucking bitches!

376
00:43:48,518 --> 00:43:50,986
That's not funny!

377
00:43:51,054 --> 00:43:53,579
"This is
a citizen's arrest."

378
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:59,087
It's a little funny.

379
00:44:57,816 --> 00:45:00,216
Hey, there they are!
Look! Pull over.

380
00:45:01,887 --> 00:45:04,116
Pull over. Come on.
I'm going. I'm going.

381
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:08,792
Pull over.
I'm going.

382
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:11,894
Where am I
supposed to park?

383
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:14,590
Lily, where am I
supposed to park?

384
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:15,859
Lily!

385
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,764
Hey.

386
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:26,836
Where's Jesse?

387
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:30,642
It's Lily.
From the pool.

388
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:35,074
He said he don't
want to see you.

389
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,779
What? He said to go back
to wherever the hell you came from.

390
00:45:38,854 --> 00:45:41,823
Why? What did I do?

391
00:45:45,293 --> 00:45:48,421
Yo, we're just playin'. He's there with
the homeless dude gettin' booze.

392
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:52,227
Yeah, I'll keep you safe till he gets back,
what do you think?

393
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,531
Yeah?
No.

394
00:45:55,603 --> 00:45:57,866
Where's your ugly friend?
She's not ugly.

395
00:45:57,938 --> 00:45:59,098
She ain't pretty.

396
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:02,134
Lily?

397
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:06,203
Hi.

398
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:08,647
Hi.

399
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:11,911
Dickhead,
you trying to get busted?

400
00:46:11,984 --> 00:46:14,452
Let's not stand in the middle
of the fucking street with beer.

401
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,648
Huh? Use your fucking head.

402
00:46:17,723 --> 00:46:18,781
What do you think?

403
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,720
Jesus.

404
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:33,230
What's going on?

405
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:34,498
Just drive.

406
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:39,169
Let's go.
Take a Ieft.

407
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:11,865
Yo, so there are, like,
a bunch of wildcats up here

408
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,805
like fucking cougars
and shit like that.

409
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:15,866
They fucking are eating people,
like, all the time.

410
00:47:15,944 --> 00:47:18,309
No way. I don't believe you.
That's bullshit.

411
00:47:18,379 --> 00:47:21,109
I swear. I swear. David.

412
00:47:21,182 --> 00:47:23,548
What?

413
00:47:23,617 --> 00:47:25,551
No, man.

414
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,519
They all died in the wildfires.
You know that.

415
00:47:27,588 --> 00:47:28,987
You're fucking
full of shit.

416
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:30,716
He's just trying
to spit game--

417
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:35,557
That's really awful.
Like, a wildfire? Like--

418
00:47:35,628 --> 00:47:38,062
Yeah, you know,
it's crazy.

419
00:47:38,131 --> 00:47:43,125
Me and David, after the last fire,
we snuck up here.

420
00:47:43,203 --> 00:47:45,170
But you gotta be really careful
because there's

421
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,228
firemen and police
and you gotta sneak in.

422
00:47:47,306 --> 00:47:49,240
And then when
you get up here,

423
00:47:49,308 --> 00:47:55,679
there's nothing but charred rabbits
and fucking coyotes.

424
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,839
Then there was
the fucking deer tree.

425
00:47:57,915 --> 00:47:59,576
There was
this tree somewhere.

426
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,641
I don't remember
where we were,

427
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:04,517
but there's this deer just strung up--
It was in the tree?

428
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:06,887
I don't know, he must've had
his antlers stuck in a branch

429
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:09,153
when he was trying to outrun the
flames or something.

430
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:13,094
But when we found him
there was nothing left.

431
00:48:13,163 --> 00:48:15,688
He was, like, just
charred meat and skeleton--

432
00:48:15,765 --> 00:48:19,257
Okay, we get the picture.
Okay, we get it. It was awful.

433
00:48:19,336 --> 00:48:22,396
No, it's awesome.

434
00:48:22,472 --> 00:48:25,770
That's reality.
Living's hard.

435
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:28,503
Especially around here.

436
00:48:28,577 --> 00:48:31,512
Living's hard
everywhere.

437
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,778
Oh, wise one, do you have any
other pearls of wisdom for us today?

438
00:48:35,851 --> 00:48:40,878
Screw you.
No thanks. I like girls.

439
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:42,616
Okay. Okay.

440
00:48:43,825 --> 00:48:45,622
I'm serious.
Okay.

441
00:48:45,693 --> 00:48:50,289
Be nice to Lily's friend.
Okay. Let's be friends.

442
00:48:50,365 --> 00:48:52,924
Shut the fuck up
and do what you're told.

443
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,433
Wait. Where are you going?

444
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:56,833
To piss.
You want to hold my dick?

445
00:49:05,044 --> 00:49:06,511
I like him.

446
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:10,281
I know you do.

447
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,103
Are you drunk?
I don't know.

448
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:38,937
I'm, like, totally
fucked up right now.

449
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,068
Be careful.
Of what?

450
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:45,407
I fucking
Iove it here.

451
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:47,176
My bad.
Excuse me.

452
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,445
Hey, watch where
the fuck you're going. Lily.

453
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,851
Wow, there's no reason
to be a bitch.

454
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:53,752
Fuck you.
Lily.

455
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:56,018
Okay, tough guy,
have a nice life.

456
00:49:57,426 --> 00:50:00,759
What's up?
Hi. What happened?

457
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:02,763
Nothing.
Nothing happened.

458
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:04,662
This guy called me a bitch.

459
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,031
Did you call
my friend a bitch?

460
00:50:07,102 --> 00:50:09,502
Listen, I don't got
a problem with you.

461
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:11,504
Well, maybe I got
a problem with you.

462
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:16,009
If I offended anyone,
it was my mistake. And I'm sorry.

463
00:50:16,077 --> 00:50:18,602
Okay, but you don't
need to apologize to us.

464
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:23,207
You need to apologize
to the girls.

465
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:24,409
I'm sorry.

466
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:27,050
Oh shit!

467
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:30,881
Gimme this bag,
mother fucker.

468
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,188
Run!

469
00:50:40,766 --> 00:50:41,755
You okay?

470
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:45,561
Run!

471
00:50:48,207 --> 00:50:48,901
Yo.

472
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:52,872
Come on. Come on.

473
00:50:52,944 --> 00:50:55,003
Hurry up.

474
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:56,774
Jesus.

475
00:51:03,488 --> 00:51:05,148
What is this place?

476
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:10,085
This is where we live.
This is cool.

477
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,061
Yeah, it's sick. David even tapped
into the power.

478
00:51:37,185 --> 00:51:39,779
You guys don't get in trouble
for staying here?

479
00:51:39,854 --> 00:51:42,186
No, every once in a while
you gotta come through

480
00:51:42,257 --> 00:51:45,089
and kick some fucking
homeless people out, but...

481
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:49,687
Yeah, they poop in the hallways.
That's gross.

482
00:51:49,763 --> 00:51:55,292
Okay, so we got a laptop, a calculator,
and a bunch of books.

483
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:58,462
Probably get, like, a grand on Craigslist
for the computer?

484
00:51:58,538 --> 00:52:00,130
Yeah, but that guy
probably needs it

485
00:52:00,206 --> 00:52:02,902
for school
or something, right?

486
00:52:02,975 --> 00:52:04,943
Golly gee willakers,
she's right.

487
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:07,309
We should probably turn it into
the lost and found.

488
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,280
Actually, the next time
we wanna hear from

489
00:52:09,348 --> 00:52:14,808
the itty bitty titty committee,
we'll be sure to ask.

490
00:52:14,886 --> 00:52:17,047
Itty bitty
titty committee.

491
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:25,995
Are you gonna
make out with Louis?

492
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:29,157
What? No.

493
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,723
I think you should
hook up with him.

494
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,128
Why?

495
00:52:34,205 --> 00:52:36,469
I don't wanna
be the only one.

496
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:41,243
Then why
don't you either?

497
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:46,543
Can you just
try to have fun?

498
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:51,743
For once?

499
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,151
For me?

500
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:27,953
I think you're pretty.

501
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:29,113
Really?

502
00:53:31,857 --> 00:53:33,256
Kinda.

503
00:53:43,636 --> 00:53:46,160
I have to go
to the bathroom.

504
00:53:46,237 --> 00:53:48,705
I have to go
to the bathroom.

505
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:21,993
Hey, I hope you
didn't drop a deuce.

506
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:23,629
The plumbing
don't work.

507
00:55:19,056 --> 00:55:20,990
Where are we going?

508
00:55:21,058 --> 00:55:22,719
I wanna
show you something.

509
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,980
Hey, where did you go?

510
00:55:47,049 --> 00:55:49,847
Jesse?

511
00:55:49,919 --> 00:55:51,250
Home sweet home.

512
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:07,891
This is your house?

513
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,567
It used to be.

514
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:16,302
Where's your family?

515
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:18,708
Moved to Arizona
about six months ago.

516
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,816
Are you rich?

517
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:29,878
If we were rich, we would still
live here.

518
00:56:29,956 --> 00:56:33,790
So then out of the blue
my dad says

519
00:56:33,859 --> 00:56:36,191
we're moving
to Scottsdale.

520
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:38,126
And we're staying
with my grandparents.

521
00:56:38,196 --> 00:56:41,097
And they told me that I wasn't
allowed to take King.

522
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:44,801
Who's King?

523
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:47,861
King was...

524
00:56:47,939 --> 00:56:50,407
this big dumb...

525
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:52,738
fat, and he's
completely retarded,

526
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,801
he was this big,
fat, ginger cat

527
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:58,041
that I had, you know, since I was, like,
five years old.

528
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:03,082
He was cool.

529
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:07,646
But he got kinda sick, so he needed, like,
a lot of medication and stuff.

530
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:12,684
So one day my dad drove him
to the animal shelter

531
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,959
while my mom and my sister
packed up the house.

532
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:23,029
And then it was
just like that.

533
00:57:23,105 --> 00:57:26,336
We were,
we were up and gone.

534
00:57:28,944 --> 00:57:32,106
I bet he ended up going home
with a really great family.

535
00:57:34,682 --> 00:57:37,583
Or he's dead,
put to sleep.

536
00:57:40,955 --> 00:57:45,721
You know, I stayed, like, in Scottsdale
for about a month.

537
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:48,420
CIose to a month,
and I couldn't take it.

538
00:57:48,495 --> 00:57:51,794
So I snuck out one night
and hopped on a bus

539
00:57:51,865 --> 00:57:53,856
and I came back here.

540
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:56,766
Aren't they, like, freaking out
looking for you?

541
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,365
Yeah, probably.

542
00:58:06,879 --> 00:58:11,440
Fuck it, you know?

543
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:17,250
Now they got
one less mouth to feed.

544
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:20,449
I'm-can you do me a favor
and please don't

545
00:58:20,525 --> 00:58:23,892
tell the other guys about this place, okay?
Why?

546
00:58:23,961 --> 00:58:26,485
You should all live here
instead of that nasty motel.

547
00:58:26,563 --> 00:58:28,554
No, they'd just
come and trash it.

548
00:58:31,401 --> 00:58:34,802
I mean this is
still my home.

549
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:36,031
Okay.

550
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:05,327
Here. Get it.

551
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:13,304
Hello?

552
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:15,500
Is that them?

553
00:59:15,576 --> 00:59:17,100
Hello?

554
00:59:32,257 --> 00:59:33,315
What'd they say?

555
00:59:33,391 --> 00:59:36,292
Nobody there.

556
00:59:36,361 --> 00:59:38,124
They hung up.

557
00:59:55,579 --> 00:59:56,603
Hello?

558
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:03,442
I'm sorry, Hogan.

559
01:00:07,323 --> 01:00:09,188
Look, I swear I'm gonna
bring your truck back

560
01:00:09,259 --> 01:00:11,192
without a scratch
on it, I promise.

561
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,854
Oh hell, I don't care
about that truck.

562
01:00:13,929 --> 01:00:17,763
I care a little
about that truck.

563
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:22,099
I care a whole lot more about you
getting home without a scratch.

564
01:00:22,171 --> 01:00:23,365
How's Lily?

565
01:00:23,438 --> 01:00:25,928
She 's okay.

566
01:00:26,007 --> 01:00:28,202
We 're both okay.

567
01:00:28,276 --> 01:00:33,179
I don't know. I don't know
anything anymore.

568
01:00:33,247 --> 01:00:34,737
Well, they say
if you're not confused

569
01:00:34,815 --> 01:00:36,783
that means
you're not thinking enough.

570
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:38,875
I'm sorry, Hogan.

571
01:00:38,952 --> 01:00:40,647
Now, now, hey, hey, hey.

572
01:00:43,023 --> 01:00:45,958
So what kind of trail of murder and
mayhem have you two left?

573
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:49,219
Not too bad.

574
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:52,093
Really?
No harm, no foul, right?

575
01:00:52,164 --> 01:00:55,133
You just come home.

576
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:58,796
You got people here
worried about you.

577
01:00:58,871 --> 01:01:00,736
Okay.

578
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:02,171
It's time to come home.

579
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,336
Bye, Hogan.

580
01:01:33,669 --> 01:01:35,159
Hey, come on.

581
01:01:53,722 --> 01:01:55,383
You sure you
wanna do this?

582
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:01,926
'Cause we don't have to.

583
01:02:04,765 --> 01:02:06,596
I know. I want to.

584
01:03:01,284 --> 01:03:03,081
What is that?

585
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:04,279
It's nothing.

586
01:03:06,488 --> 01:03:09,582
Are they scars?
Uh-huh.

587
01:03:11,327 --> 01:03:13,420
What happened?

588
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:15,122
I don't know.
I got bored.

589
01:03:23,171 --> 01:03:24,160
Did it hurt?

590
01:03:26,174 --> 01:03:27,402
No.

591
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,509
I'm sorry.

592
01:03:47,626 --> 01:03:53,690
Maybe we should
just wait anyway, you know?

593
01:03:53,766 --> 01:03:55,825
Whatever.

594
01:04:59,927 --> 01:05:02,828
--foreclosures now.
Oh, shit!

595
01:05:02,897 --> 01:05:05,922
They're ripping up
the carpet and faucets.

596
01:05:09,602 --> 01:05:11,160
I don't know.
That's disgusting.

597
01:05:11,237 --> 01:05:12,864
Seriously, that's gross.
Really.

598
01:05:12,939 --> 01:05:15,339
I'm not sure how
I feel about...

599
01:05:15,408 --> 01:05:19,309
and we'll probably have to blast out these
walls to make room for the nursery.

600
01:05:19,378 --> 01:05:22,814
The kids could always live in the backyard.
What do you think you're doing?

601
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,746
Maybe make a shed
for them or something.

602
01:05:30,556 --> 01:05:31,613
Excuse me.

603
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:41,825
Yo, you gotta
check this out.

604
01:05:41,899 --> 01:05:44,731
Thick uncut cock
ready to unload.

605
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:47,201
What are you talking about?

606
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:51,070
Young sexy couple
Iooking for a kinky girl.

607
01:05:51,141 --> 01:05:54,633
I really don't wanna look at porn
with you guys. It's not porn.

608
01:05:54,711 --> 01:05:58,407
It's this website where people put these
personal ads and they meet up and fuck.

609
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:03,578
Any ladies in need of some big black
dick this morning? Yes, please.

610
01:06:03,652 --> 01:06:08,385
Who the fuck is Tina? Everybody's looking for her.
It's crystal meth, idiot.

611
01:06:08,457 --> 01:06:11,516
All this shit is drugs, like party favors,
snow, powder.

612
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,686
We're gonna write one.
Why?

613
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:16,753
We're gonna lure some pervert
back here and rob him.

614
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:20,597
How exactly do you
plan on doing that?

615
01:06:25,506 --> 01:06:27,098
No.
Come on.

616
01:06:27,174 --> 01:06:28,937
We'll be right
in the bathroom hiding.

617
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:30,943
She says the code word, fucking--
We jump out.

618
01:06:31,011 --> 01:06:32,569
Yeah, and then what happens
when she gets hurt?

619
01:06:32,646 --> 01:06:34,443
How? We're right there.

620
01:06:34,515 --> 01:06:36,574
Okay, then, what happens
when they call the police?

621
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,708
Oh, you think he's gonna
call the fucking police?

622
01:06:38,784 --> 01:06:41,252
"Yes, Officer, I was about to have sex
with this underage girl

623
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,379
and then some hooligans
jumped out and robbed me."

624
01:06:43,456 --> 01:06:45,219
Fuck that.
Yeah, fuck that.

625
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:47,657
Shut the fuck up, Louis.
Shut the fuck up, Louis.

626
01:06:52,531 --> 01:06:53,691
Come on.

627
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:55,562
I don't know, man.

628
01:06:55,634 --> 01:06:57,465
See, everybody
always wants to be down

629
01:06:57,536 --> 01:06:59,868
and when shit gets real--
No, look, I'm just sayin'--

630
01:06:59,938 --> 01:07:03,430
Yeah, you're just saying
you're a fucking pussy.

631
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:06,942
What about you?

632
01:07:09,713 --> 01:07:11,374
What do you say?

633
01:07:18,788 --> 01:07:20,255
Okay.

634
01:07:20,323 --> 01:07:23,952
Thank you. Fuck.
Some nuts, finally.

635
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,242
Young, white girl

636
01:07:48,316 --> 01:07:55,381
looking for my big daddy.

637
01:07:56,424 --> 01:07:59,119
That's gross.

638
01:07:59,192 --> 01:08:05,756
Must be white

639
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,164
and very generous.

640
01:08:31,623 --> 01:08:33,784
Hi.

641
01:08:33,858 --> 01:08:36,122
Hi.

642
01:08:36,194 --> 01:08:37,990
Come find Alison
with me.

643
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:40,359
Shit. I keep
losing the connection.

644
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:44,662
Please? Come on.

645
01:08:44,735 --> 01:08:47,636
Yeah, we're gonna
go look for Alison.

646
01:08:47,704 --> 01:08:49,535
Holy shit!
What?

647
01:08:51,874 --> 01:08:54,365
Look, dude, look at
all of these responses.

648
01:08:54,443 --> 01:08:55,637
Come on, come on.
Get up, get up.

649
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:00,715
I'll be your daddy.
Sugar daddy here.

650
01:09:00,783 --> 01:09:03,980
What can Daddy for you?

651
01:09:04,053 --> 01:09:05,542
Oh!
Oh!

652
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:08,180
Dude just sent
a picture of his dick.

653
01:09:08,256 --> 01:09:10,417
Oh my God,
I'm going to throw up.

654
01:09:10,492 --> 01:09:12,221
What about this guy?

655
01:09:15,764 --> 01:09:20,359
I don't know,
he looks nice.

656
01:09:20,434 --> 01:09:22,197
Yeah, no, he does.

657
01:09:22,269 --> 01:09:25,830
You guys are pathetic.
This guy's a piece of shit.

658
01:09:25,906 --> 01:09:29,239
He looks nice? What the hell's
the matter with you people? What?

659
01:09:29,309 --> 01:09:31,333
We're going to rob
a perv. Come see.

660
01:10:02,139 --> 01:10:03,504
Lily?

661
01:10:20,223 --> 01:10:23,989
This is so stupid.
She could be abducted.

662
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,357
She'll be fine.

663
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:33,563
This feels like
a surprise party.

664
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:39,671
Where are we going?
My car is back there.

665
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:42,266
I just gotta
grab my stuff.

666
01:10:42,343 --> 01:10:44,607
You live back here?

667
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:46,510
Yeah, just for now.

668
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:49,576
Are you a runaway?

669
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:52,682
I guess.

670
01:10:52,753 --> 01:10:54,983
Well, does anyone
know where you are?

671
01:10:58,225 --> 01:11:00,022
You do.

672
01:11:03,396 --> 01:11:04,828
This is taking too Iong.

673
01:11:06,899 --> 01:11:10,164
Shut up.
Sorry.

674
01:11:16,242 --> 01:11:17,573
Nice little
set up you got.

675
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,238
I like it.

676
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:28,578
Looks like the
bed's seen some use.

677
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:35,819
Did you bring money?

678
01:11:35,893 --> 01:11:38,953
Maybe.

679
01:11:39,029 --> 01:11:41,293
How generous would you
like me to be?

680
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:50,872
I like your eyes.

681
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,965
Surprise!
Whoa.

682
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,304
Very generous motherfucker.

683
01:11:54,377 --> 01:11:56,402
We were just talking.

684
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,173
I don't give a fuck. Give me your money,
you fucking pervert.

685
01:11:58,246 --> 01:12:03,149
Okay. Okay. Let's all relax.
No.

686
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:05,243
How about I Ieave and we pretend
this never happened?

687
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,754
Yeah, go and get
the fuck out of here!

688
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,154
Get the fuck back!

689
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,885
Whoa, hey!
Look, relax, man.

690
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:13,586
We got his money.
Just let him go.

691
01:12:13,661 --> 01:12:15,219
I know you got a phone.
Give me your phone.

692
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:16,888
No, it's a Blackberry.

693
01:12:16,964 --> 01:12:20,161
I don't give a fuck,
motherfucker. Here.

694
01:12:20,234 --> 01:12:21,861
I'm gonna assume that
somewhere in that phone

695
01:12:21,936 --> 01:12:23,335
there's a number
that says "home"

696
01:12:23,404 --> 01:12:25,268
and at said home
there's a woman

697
01:12:25,338 --> 01:12:27,363
who would be less than pleased
to find out her husband

698
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,340
was trying to fuck
a 15-year-old girl.

699
01:12:29,409 --> 01:12:31,604
I'm sorry.
Shut the fuck up!

700
01:12:31,678 --> 01:12:34,670
So when I ask you for the PIN number
I assume you're telling the truth.

701
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:39,183
Otherwise, I'll have to call
your wife and ask her for it.

702
01:12:39,251 --> 01:12:41,947
Seven, four--
Speak!

703
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,853
Seven, four, nine, four.

704
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:48,689
Is that your final answer?
Yes. Yes.

705
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,921
Michael Kenneth White.

706
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:54,294
1460 EI Dorado Street,
GIendale, California.

707
01:12:54,365 --> 01:12:55,127
Yes.

708
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:02,635
Get the fuck
out of here.

709
01:13:02,707 --> 01:13:05,402
Go. Go.

710
01:13:05,475 --> 01:13:07,033
Holy shit!

711
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:11,577
That was such...

712
01:13:11,648 --> 01:13:13,172
a fucking rush.

713
01:13:15,118 --> 01:13:17,086
Is that your final answer?

714
01:13:17,153 --> 01:13:17,676
Fuck!

715
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:21,713
What the hell?

716
01:13:25,227 --> 01:13:27,058
You never said
anything about a gun.

717
01:13:27,129 --> 01:13:29,461
I didn't realize
I had to clear it with you.

718
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:31,623
Can I hold it?

719
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,223
Lily, be careful.

720
01:13:33,301 --> 01:13:35,064
You're such a baby.

721
01:13:35,136 --> 01:13:37,104
Yeah, well, I know a Iot
more about guns than you.

722
01:13:37,171 --> 01:13:39,002
I shoot with Hogan
all the time.

723
01:13:39,073 --> 01:13:42,509
What the fuck's a Hogan?

724
01:13:42,577 --> 01:13:44,340
It's Alison's Big Daddy.

725
01:13:45,913 --> 01:13:46,880
Screw you, Lily.

726
01:13:48,815 --> 01:13:52,876
Careful.
It's not a toy.

727
01:13:55,422 --> 01:13:58,254
Let's go get some fucking shit.
Fuck yeah.

728
01:14:09,769 --> 01:14:11,430
What if he had
hurt that guy?

729
01:14:11,503 --> 01:14:12,834
He didn't.

730
01:14:12,904 --> 01:14:14,599
No, I know,
but what if he had?

731
01:14:14,673 --> 01:14:15,765
It's not a big deal.

732
01:14:17,242 --> 01:14:18,504
We have to go back.

733
01:14:18,576 --> 01:14:20,840
What? No. Not yet.

734
01:14:20,912 --> 01:14:22,174
Okay, when?

735
01:14:24,182 --> 01:14:28,550
I just want to spend
some more time with Jesse.

736
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:31,554
We'll go back tonight, okay?
Promise?

737
01:14:31,622 --> 01:14:34,887
Sure. No, you have to promise me, Lily.
Okay. Don't spazz out.

738
01:14:34,959 --> 01:14:37,325
Oh, shit. The only time
they put the jump man

739
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:41,489
on anything other than Jordan was the P-Rod
collaboration. How do you know?

740
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:43,361
Well, because I'm not
some stupid fucking spic

741
01:14:43,433 --> 01:14:45,526
who doesn't know jack shit
about sneakers like you.

742
01:14:45,601 --> 01:14:46,898
I got you something.

743
01:14:55,744 --> 01:14:58,872
What now? We are gonna go
buy more sneakers.

744
01:14:58,947 --> 01:15:04,044
If we don't do our part, the terrorists
will have won. Come on, Alison.

745
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:29,059
Louis, I can physically
hear you developing diabetes.

746
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:37,067
I'd rather have diabetes than drink diet
soda and get rectal cancer.

747
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:40,504
Alison's mom
died of cancer.

748
01:16:40,574 --> 01:16:42,804
Lily!
What? It's true.

749
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:44,468
Yeah, but it's none
of their business.

750
01:16:44,545 --> 01:16:46,740
I don't go around
talking about your dad.

751
01:16:46,814 --> 01:16:50,181
What? That he killed himself?
Wow.

752
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:54,151
Everybody knows now.
I guess I should totally freak out.

753
01:16:56,522 --> 01:16:58,080
How'd he do it?

754
01:17:03,262 --> 01:17:06,628
A gun.

755
01:17:06,698 --> 01:17:10,464
That's so fucking cool.

756
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:15,268
Shit, if I was gonna kill myself
I'd use a gun, too.

757
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:18,002
Or jump off
a big ass bridge.

758
01:17:18,076 --> 01:17:20,839
Yeah, I hear when you
jump off a bridge

759
01:17:20,911 --> 01:17:24,938
you fall and you die on impact
when you hit the water.

760
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:31,545
The bridge
gotta be high, though.

761
01:17:31,621 --> 01:17:33,816
Thank you, Louis.

762
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:35,380
That's very
enlightening.

763
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:37,153
Of course it's gotta
be fucking high,

764
01:17:37,227 --> 01:17:41,561
otherwise you'd just
hit the water and drown.

765
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:43,826
I hear drowning's
a really beautiful way to die.

766
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,992
It's really peaceful.

767
01:17:46,068 --> 01:17:48,195
Who told you that?

768
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:52,297
I don't know.
I read it.

769
01:17:52,374 --> 01:17:54,205
How the fuck
would they know?

770
01:17:54,276 --> 01:17:58,076
They obviously didn't drown
if they wrote it in a book.

771
01:17:58,147 --> 01:18:02,048
Well, maybe they, like,
maybe, like, almost drowned.

772
01:18:02,116 --> 01:18:04,050
No. No. No.
Yeah.

773
01:18:04,118 --> 01:18:07,417
Why? Maybe someone
came and saved them.

774
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:09,149
No, but that ain't drowning.

775
01:18:10,658 --> 01:18:11,646
Like...

776
01:18:14,327 --> 01:18:19,993
what if almost drowning
was all peaceful and shit

777
01:18:20,066 --> 01:18:26,903
like those last few minutes of actually
drowning is fucking horrible.

778
01:18:30,476 --> 01:18:33,934
I mean, how fucking
pissed would you be?

779
01:18:34,013 --> 01:18:36,072
You're fucking, like,
expecting rainbows

780
01:18:36,148 --> 01:18:38,638
and fucking
angels and shit...

781
01:18:43,154 --> 01:18:45,486
and it's just this
total fucking horror.

782
01:18:47,425 --> 01:18:48,483
Sweet. Okay.

783
01:18:50,428 --> 01:18:52,190
You're meetin' your next guy
in 20 minutes.

784
01:18:52,262 --> 01:18:54,127
What do you mean?

785
01:18:54,198 --> 01:18:58,066
What do you mean
what do I mean? Did I stutter?

786
01:18:58,135 --> 01:19:00,433
Well, you already
got a bunch of stuff today.

787
01:19:00,504 --> 01:19:02,699
Yeah, and now we're gonna
get a bunch more stuff.

788
01:19:02,773 --> 01:19:05,468
So you can either shut the fuck up
or get the fuck out.

789
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:08,635
'cause you've been a stupid fucking
cunt since you got here.

790
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:14,678
Good.

791
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,009
Come on, Lily, let's go.

792
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:22,389
Let's go. Come on.
We're gonna go.

793
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:42,639
Good riddance, bitch.

794
01:19:52,218 --> 01:19:54,152
Hey!
What are you doing?

795
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,848
I'm going home, Lily.
Sorry.

796
01:19:56,923 --> 01:19:59,083
Why do you have
to ruin everything?

797
01:19:59,157 --> 01:20:02,524
I'm not ruining anything.
I just don't even recognize you anymore.

798
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:07,361
That's because for the first
time in my entire life, I'm really happy.

799
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:09,662
Good for you.

800
01:20:09,735 --> 01:20:11,134
Let's go.
Let's go home.

801
01:20:11,203 --> 01:20:13,067
I'm not fucking
leaving Jesse.

802
01:20:15,406 --> 01:20:18,341
He doesn't care
about you, Lily!

803
01:20:18,409 --> 01:20:20,809
You're just some
stupid girl to him.

804
01:20:20,878 --> 01:20:22,436
We're moving in together.

805
01:20:22,513 --> 01:20:23,445
What?

806
01:20:25,882 --> 01:20:28,043
Into his parents' place.

807
01:20:28,118 --> 01:20:29,517
What?

808
01:20:29,586 --> 01:20:32,783
They're gonna
let us live there.

809
01:20:32,856 --> 01:20:34,790
It's huge.

810
01:20:34,858 --> 01:20:36,155
It's got a pool
and everything.

811
01:20:36,226 --> 01:20:38,455
Right.
Mm-hmm.

812
01:20:42,364 --> 01:20:44,127
What about
your mom, Lily?

813
01:20:52,573 --> 01:20:54,734
Now she'll have
one less mouth to feed.

814
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,572
What are you
talking about?

815
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:59,010
You know what, Alison?

816
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,071
You should go back
to the Salton Sea.

817
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,707
You belong there.

818
01:21:02,784 --> 01:21:04,718
Don't say that.
Things are different now.

819
01:21:04,786 --> 01:21:06,309
No, they're not!

820
01:21:06,386 --> 01:21:10,015
Lily, nothing has changed!
Nothing!

821
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:13,150
Maybe not for you,
but they have for me.

822
01:21:18,564 --> 01:21:21,692
You're supposed
to be my best friend.

823
01:21:21,767 --> 01:21:25,396
Who the fuck else was I supposed
to hang out with, huh?

824
01:21:27,673 --> 01:21:29,834
You were it.

825
01:21:38,116 --> 01:21:39,879
Fuck you.

826
01:22:19,654 --> 01:22:22,623
Are you Lily?
Yeah.

827
01:22:22,691 --> 01:22:25,659
I wasn't sure I was gonna find the place.
I came out from Whittier.

828
01:22:25,726 --> 01:22:28,718
Passed by a couple times to make
sure there weren't any cops.

829
01:22:28,796 --> 01:22:31,560
You're not a cop,
are you? No.

830
01:22:31,632 --> 01:22:35,398
Yeah. No, you look too young.
You're like a kid, huh?

831
01:22:35,469 --> 01:22:37,903
No, I'm 18.

832
01:22:37,972 --> 01:22:39,461
Okay.

833
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:41,234
Want something
to eat or anything?

834
01:22:41,307 --> 01:22:44,674
I'm not really hungry.
Do you just want to go?

835
01:22:44,744 --> 01:22:48,009
I'm not hungry either.

836
01:22:48,081 --> 01:22:50,072
Go?

837
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:53,277
Yeah, let's do it.
Cool.

838
01:23:21,578 --> 01:23:24,843
Where are we going?
I'm staying in a motel just up here.

839
01:23:24,915 --> 01:23:27,110
Oh, good.

840
01:23:27,184 --> 01:23:29,652
Hey, do you have
a cigarette? No.

841
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:35,987
Oh, sorry. I'm a little wired.
Do you party?

842
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:38,185
It's right up here.
Oh, cool.

843
01:23:42,698 --> 01:23:46,292
You staying in here?
Yeah.

844
01:23:50,438 --> 01:23:52,406
I don't know,
I smell a trap.

845
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:53,736
What are you
talking about?

846
01:23:53,808 --> 01:23:56,743
I don't know.
I don't know.

847
01:23:56,811 --> 01:23:58,607
What's wrong?

848
01:24:00,547 --> 01:24:02,708
I'm going to go in there
and your big black boyfriend

849
01:24:02,783 --> 01:24:05,411
is going to bash me
in the head with a pipe.

850
01:24:05,486 --> 01:24:07,044
No.

851
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,712
Yeah?

852
01:24:11,492 --> 01:24:12,480
Come on.

853
01:24:19,098 --> 01:24:20,497
Ow!

854
01:24:20,566 --> 01:24:23,399
You gotta promise me.
What?

855
01:24:23,469 --> 01:24:25,436
Promise me that I'm not gonna get
my head bashed in

856
01:24:25,504 --> 01:24:27,870
by some nigger
if I go in there. Okay.

857
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:30,567
'Cause I couldn't
handle that.

858
01:24:30,642 --> 01:24:33,611
I couldn't fucking handle that.
Okay. I promise.

859
01:24:33,678 --> 01:24:36,647
Okay? All right,
I promise.

860
01:25:07,676 --> 01:25:11,043
My room's right over here.

861
01:25:11,113 --> 01:25:12,137
Okay.

862
01:25:27,528 --> 01:25:29,996
You sure you're
all alone in here?

863
01:25:30,064 --> 01:25:31,326
Yeah.

864
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,338
I'm sorry, you know,
it's just that...

865
01:25:47,246 --> 01:25:48,873
something seems
too good to be true...

866
01:25:54,587 --> 01:25:57,852
What's in there? It's nothing.
It's just the bathroom.

867
01:26:12,769 --> 01:26:15,203
You don't get scared
here all by yourself?

868
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,413
Take your clothes off.

869
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:35,049
I want to see
what I'm getting into.

870
01:26:35,124 --> 01:26:38,059
What the fuck? I like your eyes.
Mother fucker!

871
01:26:38,127 --> 01:26:40,617
Give me your fucking money!
Give me your fucking money!

872
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,560
Oh, I knew it. Give me your money!
You're a liar!

873
01:26:42,631 --> 01:26:44,155
Shut the fuck up
and empty your pockets.

874
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:45,790
You gonna shoot me?
You gonna shoot me?

875
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,858
Shut the fuck up
and empty your pockets.

876
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:50,200
Oh, you're gonna shoot me.
Shut up and give me your money.

877
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,602
Shut the fuck up!
Give me the money!

878
01:26:54,942 --> 01:26:56,534
What the fuck
are you doing?

879
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:03,074
Do it. Do it.

880
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:05,879
What the fuck is wrong with you?
He's a fucking psycho.

881
01:27:05,952 --> 01:27:08,716
Hey. Look man, we don't wanna
fucking hurt you, okay?

882
01:27:08,788 --> 01:27:10,255
So just get
the fuck outta here.

883
01:27:10,323 --> 01:27:12,848
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

884
01:27:12,925 --> 01:27:14,916
Well, get the fuck
outta here, man!

885
01:27:14,994 --> 01:27:16,154
Come on.

886
01:27:24,803 --> 01:27:28,432
Hey, Stop! Stop!
Get off him! Stop!

887
01:27:31,843 --> 01:27:32,831
No! No!

888
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:39,014
We're sorry. Please.

889
01:27:41,252 --> 01:27:43,277
We're sorry.

890
01:27:43,354 --> 01:27:46,379
You're just a bunch of fucking kids
screwing around.

891
01:27:46,456 --> 01:27:48,117
You're just a bunch
of fucking kids, huh?

892
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:51,183
Cut it out, please.

893
01:27:51,261 --> 01:27:56,221
You're just a bunch
of fucking kids, huh? Oh!

894
01:27:56,299 --> 01:28:04,763
Oh, why didn't you do it when you had
the chance, and it was right in me?

895
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,000
Jesse!

896
01:28:07,609 --> 01:28:09,372
Is that what you wanted?

897
01:28:09,445 --> 01:28:12,675
A little party? Huh?

898
01:31:19,453 --> 01:31:23,116
You only get a little
time between a cut

899
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:25,021
and knowing
how deep it is.

900
01:31:27,461 --> 01:31:31,397
If it's gonna
leave you nicked

901
01:31:31,465 --> 01:31:33,455
or disfigured forever.

902
01:31:38,905 --> 01:31:42,671
All you can do is try
to stretch out that moment

903
01:31:42,742 --> 01:31:44,733
for as long
as you possibly can.

904
01:31:48,747 --> 01:31:52,012
'Cause once you know...

905
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:55,746
there ain't no coming back.
