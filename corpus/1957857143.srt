1
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:40,692
Look, it'’s time we get serious.

2
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:42,346
I need to know
how committed you are.

3
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,785
You have to decide if this is
something you want to pursue.

4
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,920
And I deserve to know
where you stand.

5
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:53,053
It'’s trading at forty, Marty.

6
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:56,317
You know and I both know
it'’s worth at least twice that.

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,015
Next week we could be talking
double digits.

8
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:02,497
You gotta go all in on this one.

9
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,760
There is nothing to worry about.

10
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:08,677
We'’re talking minimal risk,
high reward.

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,984
I promise you,
if you want to diversify,

12
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:14,639
Hong Kong is where
you should be looking.

13
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,603
You made the right decision.

14
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:22,908
And, if you stick it out,

15
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:26,216
a couple
hundred thousand dollars.

16
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,609
Absolutely.

17
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,699
I'’ll call you first thing
in the morning. Bye.

18
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,142
Hi, Jen.

19
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:44,278
Emotionally unavailable.

20
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,801
How could he say that?

21
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:48,586
Look, maybe you just need
a change of pace, you know?

22
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,328
Why don'’t you go back home
for the holidays?

23
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:53,983
No, no, no.
I have way too much on my plate.

24
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:55,466
Clients are coming in
from Hong Kong,

25
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,180
and I haven'’t even started
the pitch book yet.

26
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,833
You'’re just throwing yourself
into your work

27
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,270
so you don'’t have to face
the real problem.

28
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:03,297
Some girls eat ice cream.
I dissect companies.

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,691
Just as long as I don'’t need
to stage an intervention.

30
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,172
Money never sleeps.
Neither do I.

31
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:14,873
Promise me, you will
at least try to smile.

32
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,093
Better.

33
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,578
Jennifer Moore.

34
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,536
You'’re a hard woman to reach.

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,364
Oh, hi, Abby.

36
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:30,498
Look, it'’s just...
It'’s been a rough morning.

37
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,890
What'’s up?

38
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:35,329
Actually, it'’s your dad.

39
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,287
He'’s fallen.

40
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:47,792
License and regi...

41
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:50,404
Shut the front door!

42
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,753
Jenny Moore.

43
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,885
It'’s me, Bennett. Fisk.

44
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,496
We were in church choir
together.

45
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,933
- Oh. Bennett.
- Yeah.

46
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,109
You still look good.

47
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:04,374
I was 275 pounds with head gear.

48
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:07,159
Nah, I was just
messin'’ with you.

49
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,987
- Yeah, right!
- Wow.

50
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,922
Jenny Moore. I never thought
I would see the day.

51
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,295
What brings you back?

52
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,427
My dad.

53
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,212
I, uh, have to
make sure he'’s okay.

54
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,563
Okay, well, any chance you
may be coming by the church?

55
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,043
Sure.

56
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:23,959
I'’m sure Pastor Avery
would love to see you.

57
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,309
He maybe even let you sing.

58
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,703
No, no, no. I haven'’t done that
in fifteen years.

59
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:32,402
Okay, well, promise me
you'’ll at least think about it?

60
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,534
Sure.

61
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:36,450
And do me a favor.
Try to slow down.

62
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:38,756
I mean, I'’d hate to have to
write you up one of these.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,062
We would not want that.

64
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:42,543
All right.
Hope to see you again.

65
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,588
- Bye.
- Bye.

66
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,574
Dad?

67
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,012
Dad?

68
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,014
Dad!

69
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,277
Dad!

70
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,542
Dad!

71
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,112
Dad! Dad.

72
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,245
Dad!

73
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:41,558
Daddy!

74
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,344
Daddy!

75
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,520
Dad!

76
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,610
Oh, hey, Buddy.

77
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,046
Where'’s Dad?

78
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:54,266
Oh, Dad.

79
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,453
I thought you were a burglar!

80
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:10,152
Dad! I have been calling
and calling you!

81
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,893
I was cooking.

82
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:15,244
And I don'’t have
an answering machine.

83
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:17,899
Why are you here?

84
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,597
Because Abby told me
what happened.

85
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:23,600
Well, you tell her that
the old man is not an invalid.

86
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:24,949
It was just a sprain.

87
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:27,561
What were you doing
on a ladder anyway?

88
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:30,651
I always decorate for Christmas.
Your mother loved it.

89
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:34,350
Well, she is not here anymore.
I think you can let it go.

90
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,893
Don'’t talk like that
about your mother.

91
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,484
It was important to her.

92
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:40,443
She would like it if you didn'’t
fall and break your neck!

93
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:44,578
Just one accident, and you think
you can just drive up here

94
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:45,753
and tell me what to do.

95
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,102
Yes, I can,

96
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,886
if you can'’t take care
of yourself!

97
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,670
Knock, knock.

98
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:50,845
- What?
- What?

99
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,760
Whoa. Bad time?

100
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,414
No, Brad.
Come on in.

101
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,763
Hi, Jen.

102
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,113
What are you doing here?
What is he doing here?

103
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,854
He'’s my doctor.

104
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:03,292
Wow, um...
You look great.

105
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,600
Uh, you better leave soon

106
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:09,298
or you'’ll be stuck in traffic
all the way.

107
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:13,563
I drove 300 miles
to keep an eye on you.

108
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,783
I'’m not leaving.

109
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,654
Buddy?

110
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:20,614
Come on and help me get
the rest of my things.

111
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:23,617
Well, it was good
to see you again, Jen.

112
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,316
Okay.

113
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:30,493
Let'’s check on that leg,
Mr. M.

114
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,242
Wow.

115
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,410
Out of all the doctors
in the world,

116
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:21,239
you had to pick the high school
boyfriend who cheated on me.

117
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:24,112
He may have been
a lousy boyfriend,

118
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,722
but he'’s a good doctor.

119
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,899
Did he tell you
to stay off that leg?

120
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,510
It'’s my leg.

121
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,729
I think I know it better
than he does.

122
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:36,907
I can'’t believe it's still empty
after three years.

123
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,692
They tried to sell it,

124
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:42,086
but they couldn'’t let it go
after Jack'’s accident.

125
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,740
That was the year that, uh,

126
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:46,874
you were gonna visit
for New Year'’s, remember?

127
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:49,920
But, uh, some big deal
or something came along,

128
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:52,053
and you just had to work.

129
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,707
Dad...

130
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,581
Look, I can understand being
too busy for your old man,

131
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,237
but you shouldn'’t have
missed Jack'’s funeral.

132
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,108
He was your best friend.

133
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,328
Jack and I hadn'’t
talked in years.

134
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,982
So that makes it okay?

135
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:12,421
Guess I'’ll get myself ready
to retire.

136
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:22,953
Night, Dad.

137
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,651
Good night.

138
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,676
Do you remember
when we were growing up,

139
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:53,723
and we used to talk about
what kind of jobs we would have,

140
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,812
what kind of guys
we would marry?

141
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:59,337
I was gonna be an astronaut
and marry Lance Bass.

142
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:02,166
There'’s still time, you know.

143
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,518
You think the reason why you
dated guys like Brad or Porter...

144
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,650
Preston.

145
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:11,262
Whatever. Is because
you'’re actually

146
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,787
afraid of being attached
to someone?

147
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,268
I'’m not afraid of being
attached to anyone.

148
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,835
How'’s he doing anyway?

149
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,970
I don'’t know. He's probably
living it up in L.A.

150
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:24,624
I mean your father.

151
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:29,019
Aside from almost
burning the house down?

152
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,586
- What?
- When I got home,

153
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,023
the house was full of smoke.

154
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,635
I'’m surprised the fire
department didn'’t show up.

155
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,942
Wow.

156
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,466
It'’s strange.

157
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,643
He used to be so strong.

158
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,515
I'’m worried about him.

159
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,343
Alone in that big house.

160
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:52,303
I mean, what if I wasn'’t there?
What if something had happened?

161
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:54,915
What are you gonna do?

162
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,919
He needs to be
someplace comfortable,

163
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,964
where someone can
keep an eye on him.

164
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,792
He is not gonna like that.

165
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,620
No, probably not,

166
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,970
but I have to make sure
he'’s safe.

167
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,494
I can talk to David,
have him file some paperwork

168
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:12,628
and have you declared
his legal guardian.

169
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,542
Thanks.

170
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,109
What about the house?

171
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:19,417
I could quit my job
and run a bed and breakfast.

172
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,984
Oh, okay, well,

173
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:23,508
how about I have this couple
moving up from San Diego.

174
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,423
They'’re looking for a place
just like it.

175
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,687
They might even
pay above market.

176
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:30,907
Why do we have to get old?

177
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:34,171
Don'’t worry.
You'’ll find someone.

178
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:35,738
And one way or another,

179
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,654
things will work out
with your dad. You'’ll see.

180
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,374
I can'’t believe it's still
empty after three years.

181
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,115
They tried to sell it,

182
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,554
but they couldn'’t let it go
after Jack'’s accident.

183
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:21,131
You know, if you throw in
a coin and make a wish,

184
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:22,567
it'’ll come true.

185
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,961
- Mom...
- It'’s true.

186
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:26,658
Look, it'’s been here
a long time,

187
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:30,097
and it has granted
a lot of wishes.

188
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,794
Is it older than the house?

189
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:35,798
It'’s very old and very magical.

190
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,453
I remember the first wish
I ever made in it.

191
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:40,368
Did it come true?

192
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,719
Indeed, it did.

193
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,419
Go ahead, make a wish...

194
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:51,031
and your dreams will come true.

195
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,010
Hey, Buddy.

196
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:20,800
What should I wish for?

197
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,454
I know.

198
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:29,025
I will wish for...

199
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:31,593
true love for Christmas.

200
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,434
I guess I should'’ve been
more specific.

201
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,873
Come on, let'’s go inside.

202
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:01,579
Don'’t forget
to mail my letters!

203
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,581
Yes, Dad!

204
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,122
Hmm? What'’s this?

205
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,108
Sorry.

206
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,245
"Dearest Jennifer, I heard you
were coming home,

207
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:01,291
so I thought I'’d send you
a card welcoming you.

208
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,772
Do you ever find yourself
listening to a song

209
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,861
that takes you back in time?

210
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,603
This one made me think of you.

211
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,561
I hope you like it.

212
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,780
Fondly..."

213
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,173
"your Secret Santa?"

214
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,567
Seriously?

215
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:21,921
Jenny Moore?

216
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,141
Chris?

217
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:28,449
You still work here?

218
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,669
Uh, actually
Mr. Arsenault retired,

219
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:34,672
and I bought the place.

220
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:37,197
Wow! Look at you.

221
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,633
Mr. Entrepreneur.

222
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:41,853
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:45,770
Oh, my God.
You'’ve got to check this out.

224
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:48,817
Our employee Hall of Fame.

225
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:53,517
Ooh! Those were the days, hmm?

226
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,345
That'’s unfortunate.

227
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:59,262
So, your dad said
that you'’re down in L.A.?

228
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:00,742
I am.

229
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,832
Wow. I just can'’t...

230
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,400
get over how stunning you look.

231
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:07,879
- Hey, Chris?
- Yeah?

232
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,838
- It'’s not taking the gift card.
- Oh, okay.

233
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,927
Uh, so duty calls.

234
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,191
Promise me that you will
stop back in before you leave.

235
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,714
You bet.

236
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,629
Good seeing you.

237
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,649
There she is.

238
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,216
Is that...

239
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:45,178
You are too big to be Parker.

240
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,483
I know. Time is flying.

241
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,138
- Hey, Jen.
- Hi, David.

242
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,053
Okay, Mommy'’s gonna
talk to her friend,

243
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:53,577
so why don'’t you and Daddy
go to the cereal aisle, okay?

244
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,449
Okay.

245
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:56,885
Nothing sugary.

246
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,062
How'’s everything today?

247
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,238
No fires yet, knock on wood.

248
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:04,675
That'’s good, I guess.

249
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,068
Yeah, did you talk to David?

250
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,157
Yeah, um, he'’s doing
the paperwork.

251
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,092
And if you'’re interested,
I have some booklets in the car

252
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:12,640
from when I had to find
a place for my grandma.

253
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,208
That would be great.
Thank you.

254
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:17,688
What'’s this?

255
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,082
Oh...

256
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:23,390
"To Jennifer."
Ooh, a love note?

257
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,782
Abby.

258
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:32,442
"Fondly, your Secret Santa."

259
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,096
Hmm, how mysterious.

260
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,969
I found it in my mailbox.
What do you think?

261
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:41,495
It'’s a cute card,
catchy song, nice handwriting.

262
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,845
Looks like you'’ve got yourself
a classy stalker.

263
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:45,107
You'’re not funny.

264
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,109
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'’m sorry.

265
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:50,112
Let'’s go find something your dad
can'’t set on fire, okay?

266
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:52,723
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

267
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:10,132
Dad, whose car
is parked outside?

268
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:11,612
Jenny!

269
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,875
Pastor Avery.

270
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,312
I just stopped by to see
how your dad was doing.

271
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:17,922
I heard you were in town.

272
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:21,361
Any chance we might see you
at church while you'’re here?

273
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,494
Well, I told Bennett
that I'’d think about it.

274
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:25,713
Ha ha!

275
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,107
You have a better chance
of seeing Elvis.

276
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,022
Well, I'’m glad to see
you'’re feeling better.

277
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,677
We'’ll continue to mention you
in our prayers.

278
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,026
Thank you, Pastor.

279
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,811
It'’s very nice of you
to help him out.

280
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:39,292
Hope to see you soon.

281
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:47,648
I am pretty sure you'’re supposed
to stay off that leg.

282
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:50,346
Skim milk? Egg whites?

283
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,392
Am I supposed to eat this stuff?

284
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:55,308
Somebody'’s gotta
take care of you.

285
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:56,700
Where'’s my chips?

286
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,746
- What chips?
- My chips.

287
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,531
You can'’t watch a game
without chips.

288
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,142
These chips?

289
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,971
Do you know what they
put in these things?

290
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:10,366
Artificial preservatives,
hormones, GMO'’s.

291
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,498
"Gamoes?"

292
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,893
G-M-O.
Genetically modified organisms.

293
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,939
What is this, Star Trek?

294
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,941
Here, have an apple.

295
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:25,251
I'’m gonna get myself some real
food with all the GMC'’s I want.

296
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:27,209
G-M-O!

297
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:29,342
And the only place you'’re going
is the living room

298
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,605
because I'’m gonna make you
something to eat.

299
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:34,347
This is elder abuse.

300
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:41,267
Keep your leg elevated!

301
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,741
"Dearest Jennifer,
I hope you'’re getting my cards.

302
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:23,222
To be honest, I wasn'’t sure
if you were ever coming back,

303
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,833
and I was excited
to hear that you were.

304
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,704
As for why I'’m writing, well...

305
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,489
I guess there'’s something
about Christmas

306
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:32,056
that makes me think about
the loneliness I feel.

307
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,058
Too often I think
we get so wound up

308
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:36,365
in our own lives
and our own work,

309
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,933
it becomes hard
to let anyone else in.

310
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:40,326
I know you work hard.

311
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,980
I'’ve always admired that
about you.

312
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,332
But don'’t you ever feel like
you missed out on anything?

313
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,160
Lately I'’ve been feeling
that I have.

314
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:52,033
Fondly, your Secret Santa."

315
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,559
Who are you?

316
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,387
The mailman.

317
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,046
Hey!

318
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,328
Excuse me.
My name is Jennifer.

319
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:27,895
I live at 14730 Winslow Street.

320
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,462
Look, if you'’re
missing any mail,

321
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:32,203
go down to the post office
and fill out a claim form.

322
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,075
Oh, no, no.
See, the last couple of days

323
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,835
I'’ve been getting these cards,
Christmas cards.

324
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:40,777
Oh, you don'’t say!
And this time of year, too.

325
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:44,215
No, no.
I-I... Excuse me.

326
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,392
I want to know
where they come from.

327
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:51,571
No stamp, no postmark.
Sorry. Didn'’t come from me.

328
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:54,791
Well, I was wondering maybe
you saw somebody put it in.

329
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,358
Never seen it before.

330
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:59,405
Look, I just got this, okay?

331
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:01,929
It must'’ve been there when you
delivered the mail today.

332
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:07,064
Ma'’am, are you aware of
Article 313 of the postal code?

333
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:08,718
No part of a mail receptacle
may be used

334
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,808
to deliver any matter
not bearing postage.

335
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,810
Now, if you'’ll excuse me,

336
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:17,901
I have about 722 Christmas cards
to deliver before 5:00,

337
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:21,557
and then I'’d like to enjoy
my glass of eggnog.

338
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,298
Do you mind?

339
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:31,350
Where did this come from?

340
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:35,092
Another one?

341
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:37,094
Did this guy
ever hear of e-mail?

342
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:39,880
Do I have a stalker?
Should I call the police?

343
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,272
And say what?

344
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,057
Someone'’s been sending you
Christmas cards?

345
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,493
But who is it?

346
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,408
Well, who knows you'’re here?

347
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,671
There'’s Chris, my ex co-worker
from the coffee shop.

348
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,891
He kept saying
how pretty he thought I was.

349
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:53,763
What about Brad?

350
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,548
Oh, don'’t even say his name.

351
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,767
He'’s been spending time
with your dad.

352
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,116
Maybe they talked about you.

353
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,163
He does not have a romantic bone
in his body.

354
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:04,208
Can'’t deny love, Jen.

355
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,123
You can if it cheated on you

356
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,864
with a cheerleader
from Holy Name.

357
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:10,432
Is there anyone else?

358
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,565
- It'’s the cop.
- What cop?

359
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,090
The one who pulled me over.

360
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,092
The one that was
in choir practice with us.

361
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:20,399
You mean Bennett?

362
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,575
I'’m gonna follow him.

363
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:25,665
I gotta go.

364
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:29,190
Wait, Jen.
No, don'’t. I...

365
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:34,064
This should be good.

366
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,154
It'’s gotta be him.

367
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:32,209
Oh, Jenny!

368
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:37,345
- Hi.
- Uh, Jenny, you okay?

369
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,129
No, Bennett, I'’m fine.
I'’m fine.

370
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:40,391
I just... I just tripped.

371
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:43,133
Okay. You should
be more careful.

372
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,092
I know...

373
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:46,833
Cleanup on aisle one.

374
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:50,576
So are you sending out a lot
of cards for the holidays?

375
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:53,970
Nah, but there is
someone special

376
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,885
I need to find a card for.

377
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:56,886
Oh.

378
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,279
Yeah, you know how it is.

379
00:24:58,322 --> 00:24:59,846
You don'’t want it
to sound too corny,

380
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:03,502
but you don'’t want to come off
as a stalker, you know?

381
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:07,375
It must be
a really important person.

382
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:11,118
Yeah, very important.

383
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,424
Hey, Jennifer!

384
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,079
Hey, guys.

385
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:17,994
Did you guys see that some idiot

386
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,735
knocked over
the display over there?

387
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:24,044
No, no, I didn'’t.
Did you?

388
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:26,568
No, I didn'’t see anything.

389
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,178
Oh, okay.

390
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:30,006
So how do you guys
know each other?

391
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,052
Oh, we were in choir
back in the day.

392
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:34,315
She had the most
beautiful voice.

393
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:36,796
So, uh, how do you know
my boyfriend?

394
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:40,451
Your boy...

395
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:44,978
Your boyfriend?
Your boyfriend. Oh.

396
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:48,285
Yeah, we worked together
at the coffee shop years ago.

397
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,810
Oh, right. Okay.

398
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,290
Right.

399
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:56,859
You two...
You'’re a couple.

400
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:00,297
You'’re a couple!

401
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:02,865
Oh, is-is that a card?

402
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,974
I thought that we weren'’t
exchanging gifts this year.

403
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:08,001
First of all, yes, it'’s a card,
but who says it'’s for you?

404
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:09,306
Well, who else would it be for?

405
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,701
Oh, you guys,
you'’re so cute together.

406
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,183
I know, right?

407
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:17,967
Yes!

408
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:19,578
I better be going.

409
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:23,538
It was really good to see you.

410
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,671
- All right, you, too.
- Likewise.

411
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:27,542
Okay.

412
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,892
See ya.

413
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:33,243
- She hasn'’t changed a bit.
- Not at all.

414
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:47,823
Did you hear that?

415
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,876
I think somebody
went for the mailbox.

416
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,359
Gotcha!

417
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:14,502
Okay, okay! I get it.

418
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,941
Okay. Whatever.

419
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,817
You can skip that house, too.

420
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,470
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

421
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:31,867
Oh, no.

422
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,696
No, no, no.

423
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:37,959
Dad!

424
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,006
Dad!

425
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,322
Dad.

426
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,238
Daddy, please.

427
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:56,631
Buddy.

428
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,993
Not again.

429
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,799
Bah humbug.

430
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,764
So you fell off the porch.

431
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,596
I got locked out of the house.
I was trying to get in.

432
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,340
Where exactly does it hurt?

433
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:54,863
My back.

434
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:02,218
That'’s, uh, quite a collection
of Christmas cards

435
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:04,568
you'’ve got there.

436
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:06,614
Well, you treat someone
long enough,

437
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,834
and you start to feel
like a member of the family.

438
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:13,621
Do you ever send them yourself?

439
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:16,972
No. My secretary
handles that.

440
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:20,802
- Is it tender here?
- A little.

441
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:26,111
That song...

442
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,418
You know this one?

443
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:34,816
Uh, do you ever...

444
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,210
find yourself
listening to a song

445
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:39,603
that takes you back in time?

446
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:47,611
Look, Jen, I don'’t blame you.

447
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,571
You have every reason
in the world to hate me.

448
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:54,009
You'’re a beautiful,
smart woman.

449
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,054
I blew it.

450
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,363
Wait. W-W-Wait.

451
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,539
Wait, wait, wait, is that it?

452
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,019
Well, I'’d like an X-ray,

453
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,780
but it looks like
you sprained your lower back.

454
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,719
Is there anything I should do
to take care of it?

455
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:11,679
You can try not
breaking into your house.

456
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:13,028
That always helps.

457
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:14,769
Right.

458
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:20,949
After you'’re finished
getting dressed,

459
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:23,299
you can schedule an appointment
out front with Marilyn.

460
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:26,433
Okay.

461
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:27,913
And...

462
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,310
If you could ever find it
in your heart to forgive me,

463
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:35,746
give me a call.

464
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:40,621
You always were
one-in-a-million.

465
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:14,481
Come on, babe.

466
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,570
You know you'’re
more than that to me.

467
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,964
You'’re one-in-a-million.

468
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,619
Same old Brad.

469
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,148
Ooh!

470
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:57,698
Anything you want to say
to Aunt Millie?

471
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,658
Um...

472
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:03,138
You okay?

473
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:06,315
No, I-I must'’ve just
slept on it wrong.

474
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,883
I meant in general.
You looked a little distracted.

475
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,103
What'’s on your mind?

476
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:15,672
Uh...

477
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:19,894
When you first met Mom,

478
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,071
how did you know
that she was the one?

479
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:24,290
I didn'’t.

480
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,031
Really?

481
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:31,036
All that lightning bolt,
love at first sight crap,

482
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,168
that'’s just meant
to sell cards.

483
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:35,518
The trick is
getting to know them.

484
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:39,261
Trust me, when the right one
comes along, you'’ll know.

485
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,831
You know this, uh...

486
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:47,791
This, uh, organic stuff'’s
not too bad.

487
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,883
Thanks for the chat.

488
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:55,103
Oh, the mail came.

489
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:58,802
And, uh, the mailman
left a note in the box.

490
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:03,329
It said to stop stalking him,
whatever that means.

491
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:06,723
Anything else?

492
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:09,770
You mean, uh, this?

493
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:13,948
Get to know him.

494
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:17,256
I intend to.

495
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:30,965
"Dearest Jennifer, a funny
thing happened the other day

496
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,272
when I brought home
our Christmas tree.

497
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:34,882
Suddenly I remembered
what it was like

498
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:37,102
watching you decorate
your house.

499
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:39,104
I still look forward
to seeing it every year.

500
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:42,281
I realize I should'’ve done this
earlier. Years ago, even.

501
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:45,110
I wish I had the strength
to just pick up the phone

502
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:47,088
or march over to the house and
tell you how I feel personally.

503
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:49,549
But I don'’t know
what you would think."

504
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:51,725
Excuse me,
are you done with this?

505
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:53,683
- Uh, sure, thanks.
- Okay.

506
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,512
"I know you'’re busy.

507
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:59,211
You have your own life
in the city and a great job.

508
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:02,040
Truth is, I felt you
slipping away for some time.

509
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,042
I guess I didn'’t want
to lose my chance

510
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:07,088
before you finally stop
coming back here for good.

511
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:09,873
Fondly, your Secret Santa."

512
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:18,578
Do you have any
extra Christmas cards?

513
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,449
Sure. Why?

514
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,499
"Dear...

515
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:29,110
Secret Santa."

516
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:35,682
"Dear Secret Santa,

517
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:40,774
I don'’t think it's necessary for
us to hide behind our words."

518
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:46,867
No.

519
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:51,741
"I think the time has come...

520
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:54,353
for us to reveal ourselves."

521
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:55,441
That'’s corny.

522
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:10,238
"Who are you really,
Secret Santa?"

523
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:13,328
You write million-dollar
proposals for business deals

524
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:14,982
for a living,

525
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:18,116
and you can'’t handle
a simple Christmas card?

526
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,340
Just do it.

527
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:28,256
Just pick up the pen and do it.

528
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:34,871
"Dear Secret Santa.

529
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:36,482
First of all,
I wanted you to know

530
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,223
that I'’ve been getting
your cards.

531
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:39,920
You seem to know a lot about me,

532
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:42,531
and I have to admit,
you have a good point.

533
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,794
I think we do get so wrapped up
in our own lives

534
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:48,537
that it'’s easy to forget
the people who care about us.

535
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:50,278
I'’m not sure if you know this,

536
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:52,585
but the reason I came back
was to help out my dad.

537
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:54,693
He had a nasty fall while
he was putting up the lights,

538
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:57,459
and I'’ll be honest,
I'’m worried about him.

539
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,461
I'’ve come to realize
that this house

540
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:01,768
isn'’t the best thing
for him right now,

541
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:03,422
and as hard as it may be,

542
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,598
I understand what I have
to do to help him.

543
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,469
I don'’t mean to go on.

544
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:11,212
It'’s just that I guess I'm glad
to have someone to talk to.

545
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:13,127
Someone who understands me.

546
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,043
I know it'’s scary to open up
to someone personally.

547
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:17,958
What if they don'’t feel
the same way?

548
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,786
What if you'’re
wasting your time?

549
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:22,528
But whoever you are, I don'’t
want to lose the opportunity

550
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:25,139
to find the person
behind the words

551
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,489
and get to know you better.

552
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,491
Tell me who you are."

553
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:37,195
"XOXO, Jennifer."

554
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:49,381
Hello?

555
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:53,298
Hi, it'’s Jenny.
Listen, um,

556
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,517
I was wondering if you could
help me with something.

557
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:10,576
So some guy has been writing you
three letters at this point?

558
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,883
How romantic. I wish someone
would do that for me.

559
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:16,408
Okay, so now you want
a Christmas card.

560
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:18,584
It would be nice
to be appreciated

561
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:20,063
every once in a while.

562
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:23,502
Guys, guys, guys,
leave the drama for me.

563
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,243
Okay. It'’s all set.

564
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:29,203
So now if Cyrano decides
to write you another letter,

565
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,467
you'’ll be able to see
who he is.

566
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,210
Look, it'’s gonna be okay.

567
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,213
Don'’t worry about it,
don'’t stress.

568
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,432
Okay.

569
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:54,184
What are you kids
doing out here?

570
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:57,144
Oh, hey! We'’re just
talking about you, Mr. M.

571
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:59,929
How about some homemade eggnog?

572
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:01,931
Ah! I'’ll be right in there.

573
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:03,106
All right, all right.

574
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:14,161
Uh, look, those are nice guys,

575
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,139
but if you'’re looking for
something more romantic,

576
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:19,732
you might be running your flag
up the wrong pole,

577
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:23,039
if you know what I mean.

578
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,563
Come on, let'’s go inside.

579
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:27,130
So you do know.

580
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:28,654
Yeah, yeah, I know.

581
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:30,656
All right, sorry.

582
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:13,655
Nobody'’s going to the box.

583
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:17,137
That'’s impossible.

584
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,358
How did it get there?

585
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:29,671
"Dearest Jennifer.

586
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:32,979
Wow! I just got
your Christmas card.

587
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:35,634
I must admit, it'’s exciting
and even a little scary to know

588
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:38,637
that this is finally
a two-way street.

589
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,291
I'’m sorry to hear your dad
isn'’t doing so well.

590
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:42,902
I realize how busy you must be,

591
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:46,471
but I think sometimes
he feels left out of your life,

592
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,430
especially since you were
always so close to your mom.

593
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:51,693
I can tell he doesn'’t
want anyone to know

594
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:54,827
he takes it personally,
but he really does.

595
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,352
He doesn'’t always show it,
but he loves you very much.

596
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:02,095
I know we'’ve known each other
for a long time,

597
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:04,532
but I feel closer to you
than ever.

598
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:06,665
Being able to get my feelings
for you off of my chest

599
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,970
means a lot to me.

600
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:10,190
And whether you feel
the same way or not,

601
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:13,976
seeing you again at Christmas
would be the best present ever.

602
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,848
As my mother often said,

603
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:18,851
it'’s never too late
to get it right.

604
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:21,593
Fondly, Jack."

605
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:23,464
No way.

606
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:33,256
Dad, do you know where
my high school yearbooks are?

607
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,564
In the garage, I think.
Why? What is it?

608
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:07,595
Oh, my gosh.

609
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,911
I know it'’s a bit chilly now,
but come summer

610
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:21,783
I promise the pool will be
a huge hit with the kids.

611
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:23,761
- It'’s absolutely incredible...
- I need to talk to you.

612
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:26,048
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Ellis,
this is Jennifer.

613
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:28,921
She likes to barge in sometimes
without an appointment.

614
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:30,749
I'’ll call you later.

615
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,490
I know who sent the cards.

616
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,274
I'’m closing a sale.

617
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:42,151
It'’s Jack.
The cards came from Jack.

618
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,070
And these cards are, what,
coming from beyond the grave,

619
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:49,768
traveling through time, what?

620
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,117
I don'’t know.

621
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,728
Jack was killed
in a car accident

622
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:57,166
on Christmas Day,
three years ago.

623
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,255
Yeah, I know.

624
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:02,345
I went... I went to his funeral.

625
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,523
Do you think
I'’m taking this lightly?

626
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:07,307
You want my honest opinion?

627
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,527
Someone is messing with you.

628
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,834
They got his handwriting,
and they'’re manipulating you.

629
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:15,924
Yeah, but even if they did,

630
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:19,145
I had the camera
on that mailbox all night,

631
00:42:19,188 --> 00:42:20,842
and no one ever came near it.

632
00:42:20,886 --> 00:42:25,020
It'’s like these cards...
just appeared.

633
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:28,328
I saw David Copperfield walk
through the Great Wall of China,

634
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,373
and I can'’t explain that either.

635
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:37,859
Look, there'’s a very simple way
to get to the bottom of this.

636
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:40,209
Okay, what?

637
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:42,647
We'’re gonna need another card.

638
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:49,436
Okay, now what?

639
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:52,395
How do you usually
start one of these?

640
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:56,486
- Um...
- You have to sound delighted.

641
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,837
Tell him that
you'’re absolutely...

642
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,189
"Absolutely excited to hear
that you are my Secret Santa.

643
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:06,235
However, just to make sure
that it'’s really you,

644
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:09,412
I was hoping you might be able
to tell me something secret.

645
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:12,328
Something no one else
would know.

646
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:15,331
XOXO, Jennifer."

647
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:22,643
"Dearest Jennifer.

648
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:24,558
Sure! As a matter of fact,

649
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,734
I'’ll tell you something
you don'’t know.

650
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:28,736
Do you remember
your goldfish Louie?

651
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,564
The one we called Super Fish

652
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,958
because he lived
for nine years?"

653
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,960
"Do you remember the time
he lost weight,

654
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:37,179
and your dad said
he went on a diet?

655
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:39,573
Well, the truth is
your mom and dad

656
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,054
found Louie floating in the tank
while you were at school

657
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:44,404
and replaced him with
a similar-looking one

658
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:45,405
from the store."

659
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:46,580
Oh, Louie!

660
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,714
"Ask your dad.
He'’ll tell you.

661
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,454
Fondly, Jack."

662
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:53,848
You think
he'’s telling the truth?

663
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:55,937
Well, there'’s only one way
to find out.

664
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:58,113
Goldfish?

665
00:43:58,157 --> 00:44:01,116
Are you serious?

666
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,424
It'’s important, Mr. M.
Do you remember anything?

667
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,948
Of course I remember it.

668
00:44:06,992 --> 00:44:08,776
The thing wouldn'’t die.

669
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,257
You know how hard it was
to get somebody to come over

670
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,608
and feed that thing every time
we went on vacation?

671
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:17,524
Did you ever replace him...

672
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:19,352
with another fish?

673
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:23,617
Do you really think I would do
something like that to you?

674
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,792
Did you?

675
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:31,059
Fine. One day
when you were about eight,

676
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,887
you were at school,

677
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:37,457
and I found Louie floating
upside-down in the tank.

678
00:44:39,981 --> 00:44:41,243
Oh, my gosh.

679
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:43,332
I knew how much
you loved that thing,

680
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:45,117
so your mother and I
went to the store

681
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,380
and bought another one
looked just like it.

682
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:51,427
Did you and mom
ever tell anybody about it?

683
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:55,040
No, just the guys at the store,
I guess.

684
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,781
Oh, wait a minute. Uh...

685
00:44:56,824 --> 00:45:00,349
Your mom did mention it
to Jack once.

686
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:03,396
He thought it was hilarious.

687
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:05,703
Why?

688
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,086
1901.

689
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:46,656
Two teachers from
Saint Hugh College in Oxford

690
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,009
got lost while visiting
the palace of Versailles.

691
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:54,708
During this time, the women
reported encountering men

692
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,929
with three cornered hats

693
00:45:57,972 --> 00:45:59,800
and a fair-haired woman

694
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:05,545
wearing a light summer dress
and a shady white hat.

695
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:09,027
Now the odd thing is

696
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,944
that the details
of the woman'’s experience

697
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:18,950
were found to be
completely inconsistent

698
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:23,084
with the palace'’s appearance
in 1901.

699
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:26,696
Rather, the world
that the women described

700
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,919
was remarkably accurate
for 1789.

701
00:46:31,963 --> 00:46:34,966
And the description of the woman

702
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:40,667
might very well have been
Marie Antoinette herself.

703
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,975
Now, how did this happen,
you ask.

704
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:46,455
Well, I believe
that at some point,

705
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:51,156
the two women had unknowingly
passed through a time slip

706
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:54,463
or worm hole.

707
00:46:54,507 --> 00:47:00,339
They traveled 112 years

708
00:47:00,382 --> 00:47:02,341
into the past,

709
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:04,734
and upon retracing their steps,

710
00:47:04,778 --> 00:47:08,651
found their way back
to the present.

711
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,572
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

712
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:21,186
Who should I make it out to?

713
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:25,538
No. Actually, I was wondering
if I could have a moment.

714
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:27,670
What can I do for you?

715
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:31,544
I wanted to know
if it'’s possible

716
00:47:31,587 --> 00:47:33,502
to communicate through time.

717
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:35,200
Why do you ask that?

718
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:39,857
Because the person
who'’s been sending me these

719
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,294
has been dead for three years.

720
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:45,471
Well, I'’d send a letter of
complaint to the post office

721
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:48,039
if I were you.

722
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:49,779
I would.

723
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:52,478
You see, these have just been
appearing in my mailbox,

724
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:57,004
and, um, well, we'’ve been
writing back and forth.

725
00:47:57,048 --> 00:48:02,531
You'’ve been corresponding
to and from this individual?

726
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:05,360
Is that possible?

727
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:11,236
There is something called
non-local quantum communication.

728
00:48:11,279 --> 00:48:14,282
In layman'’s terms,
it'’s a way to send a message

729
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:16,719
faster than the speed of light.

730
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:19,374
Right.

731
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:22,421
This is something else entirely.

732
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:27,339
Well, what about the time slips?

733
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:29,384
Like what happened
to those other women.

734
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:33,345
Look, now, nobody really knows
for sure what happened to them.

735
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:35,782
It could'’ve been a time slip.

736
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:38,611
It could'’ve also have been
a shared delusion.

737
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:41,744
Some suggest
they merely stumbled upon

738
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:43,877
a historical reenactment.

739
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,792
But when you were
speaking earlier...

740
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:49,100
Theoretically,
I suppose it'’s possible.

741
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,192
If what you'’re saying is right,

742
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:56,194
if that'’s happening,

743
00:48:56,237 --> 00:49:01,764
isn'’t it possible to use this
to change the past?

744
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:06,073
You mean prevent his death?

745
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:09,076
I don'’t know...

746
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,601
what year he'’s writing from.

747
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:16,475
He could have two years left
or three.

748
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:21,654
We'’re talking about forces
we cannot begin to explain.

749
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:26,006
The tiniest alteration or ripple
could spiral out of control

750
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,227
in ways that we couldn'’t
begin to comprehend.

751
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,664
You want my advice?

752
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:33,796
If this is real,

753
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,496
if this is actually happening,

754
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:39,541
enjoy it,

755
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:43,067
but do not tamper with it.

756
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:51,075
Um, thank you for your time.

757
00:49:51,118 --> 00:49:53,686
Wait. Just a minute,
just a minute.

758
00:49:59,779 --> 00:50:04,044
Here. On the house.
On the house.

759
00:50:22,715 --> 00:50:24,847
This is nuts.

760
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,030
Time slip.

761
00:50:37,512 --> 00:50:39,036
Whoa!

762
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:41,734
Whoa!

763
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:50,090
It'’s real.

764
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:52,310
This is really happening.

765
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:08,108
"Dear Jack, you have no idea
how surprised I was

766
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:11,329
to find out
you are my Secret Santa.

767
00:51:11,372 --> 00:51:13,853
But there'’s something about
these cards

768
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:16,116
that you need to know.

769
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,510
The night before I got
your first card,

770
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:21,295
I made a wish
at the old wishing well.

771
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,863
You and I spent a lot of time
playing near that well,

772
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:26,518
and we know that
it'’s a lot of nonsense,

773
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:30,565
but this time,
I believe my wish came true.

774
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:32,959
You see, these cards
that you'’ve been sending

775
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:35,527
are actually arriving
in the future.

776
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,791
I'’m sitting in my room
right now,

777
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:40,793
looking out the window
and your room.

778
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:43,448
Your whole house is empty."

779
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:45,754
What?

780
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:51,282
"You don'’t live there anymore.

781
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:57,070
And yet every day I get cards
hand-delivered from you.

782
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,246
The ironic thing
about all this is...

783
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:03,555
that just when we'’ve connected
or reconnected,

784
00:52:03,598 --> 00:52:05,339
we'’re still separated.

785
00:52:05,383 --> 00:52:08,908
I don'’t know how long
this is going to last,

786
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:11,345
but I'’m enjoying the ride.

787
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:13,347
XOXO, Jennifer."

788
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:19,223
"P.S. I'’m curious.

789
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:21,964
How long have you been
interested in me?"

790
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:02,222
All right,
what am I lookin'’ for?

791
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:03,397
Okay.

792
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,189
Read this.

793
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:15,931
"Dearest Jennifer..."

794
00:53:15,975 --> 00:53:18,586
Do I really have to read this?

795
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,848
Mm-hmm.

796
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:23,243
Fine.

797
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:24,723
"Getting your card this morning

798
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:27,769
has made this the strangest
Wednesday I'’ve had

799
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:29,336
since I can remember.

800
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,818
After I read it, I went over
to talk to your father..."

801
00:53:32,861 --> 00:53:35,255
"and he said you hadn'’t
even come home yet.

802
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,389
He said you'’re still
300 miles away in L.A.

803
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:39,999
I can'’t believe
this is happening,

804
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,610
but it seems that you'’re right.

805
00:53:42,654 --> 00:53:44,308
You said I'’ve moved.

806
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:46,179
Please, wherever I'’ve gone,
find me.

807
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,007
I know I'’ve got
a couple of years to wait,

808
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:52,011
but I'’ve waited this long,
what'’s another year or two?

809
00:53:52,054 --> 00:53:54,405
If we can'’t be together
on my Christmas,

810
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:56,058
then we can be together
on yours.

811
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:57,538
It'’s been too long,

812
00:53:57,582 --> 00:54:00,367
and we don'’t need
to be alone anymore.

813
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:03,196
By the way,
to answer your question,

814
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,460
how long have I been
interested in you?"

815
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:09,594
"All my life.

816
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:13,293
Love, Jack."

817
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:16,775
What do you mean, Jack?

818
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:18,516
Jack.

819
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,127
You mean... Jack?

820
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:24,086
But he'’s...

821
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,698
I know.
Apparently it'’s, um,

822
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:30,049
it'’s a time slip
or a worm hole or something.

823
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:34,706
I don'’t know, but it'’s Jack.

824
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:39,624
Look, I made a wish in the well
the first night I got home,

825
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:44,498
and I asked for true love.

826
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:46,587
I got Jack.

827
00:54:51,984 --> 00:54:54,334
Told you it was wild.

828
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:09,001
I can'’t believe I'm breaking
into Jack'’s house.

829
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:27,705
Go ahead, make a wish.

830
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:31,709
No. I think I'’ll save it
for something special.

831
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:33,624
Hey, why don'’t you make one?

832
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,321
You okay?

833
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:43,503
I never told you...

834
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:46,158
why I didn'’t make it back
for Jack'’s funeral.

835
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:47,812
Oh, sure.

836
00:57:49,378 --> 00:57:51,511
I know how hard you work.

837
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:56,168
It wasn'’t fair of me
to go off on you like that.

838
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,345
No. You were right.

839
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:03,218
I should'’ve been here.

840
00:58:03,262 --> 00:58:06,134
Everybody thinks
that I'’m this...

841
00:58:06,178 --> 00:58:08,615
strong businesswoman.

842
00:58:11,009 --> 00:58:12,924
The truth is I'’m a coward.

843
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:16,710
I couldn'’t handle it.

844
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:20,801
I lost Mom,

845
00:58:20,845 --> 00:58:24,718
and you and I have never
really been that close.

846
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:26,938
And now Jack.

847
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:33,510
You know what my ex called me?

848
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:36,774
Emotionally unavailable.

849
00:58:36,817 --> 00:58:37,905
Jen...

850
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,559
No, he'’s right.

851
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:43,607
I don'’t know how
to express my feelings.

852
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:44,999
So I ran.

853
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:48,220
I chickened out.
I stayed in L.A.

854
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:49,787
And now it'’s too late.

855
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:53,399
You know,
I'’m just a simple guy.

856
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:58,578
So I can'’t pretend
to understand,

857
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:01,799
but I do know somehow,

858
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:03,583
some way...

859
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:06,847
you and Jack have been
given a second chance.

860
00:59:08,066 --> 00:59:11,765
And that chance
has allowed you to realize

861
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:16,857
that you'’ve had feelings for
one another for all these years.

862
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:21,383
And that is a Christmas miracle.

863
00:59:21,427 --> 00:59:24,561
If I could ever write a letter
to your mother,

864
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:27,433
speak to her for just a minute,

865
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:31,089
that'’d be a gift from God.

866
00:59:31,132 --> 00:59:33,395
Huh?

867
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:37,095
Come on, come on,
you got a letter to write.

868
00:59:37,138 --> 00:59:38,618
Right.

869
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:41,447
"Dear Jack,
a couple of days ago,

870
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,841
Abby said I was afraid
of being attached.

871
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:46,452
At the time I thought
it was ridiculous.

872
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:49,716
But the more I'’ve thought
about it, the more true it is.

873
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,937
If only you knew how much
these cards have meant to me

874
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,591
these past few days

875
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:56,157
or how close I'’ve come to feel

876
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:59,204
to the mysterious Secret Santa
behind the message,

877
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:01,641
the man who knew me
better than I knew myself,

878
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,643
the man who, little did I know,

879
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:06,907
I'’ve been searching for
my whole life,

880
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:12,043
and to think this whole time
he was right next door.

881
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:13,697
As your mother would say,

882
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,569
it'’s never too late
to get it right.

883
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,354
Love, Jennifer."

884
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,893
"P.S. I went over
to your house today,

885
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:39,723
and I found your sketchbook
under the floorboard.

886
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:42,595
I hope you don'’t mind,
but I took it.

887
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,989
I'’ll take good care of it
for you."

888
01:01:13,321 --> 01:01:15,672
Hi, Mom.

889
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:22,200
I feel so strange
not having you around.

890
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:23,723
When things are going good,

891
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:26,508
I wish I could just
pick up the phone and tell you.

892
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:29,294
When things are bad,

893
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:33,037
I wish you were there to tell me
everything'’s going to be okay.

894
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:40,827
I feel so alone without you.

895
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:43,090
I love you, Mom.

896
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,449
You remind me a lot of her.

897
01:01:57,148 --> 01:01:58,976
You'’re not the quiet girl
I remember

898
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:01,195
from the choir anymore.

899
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:04,546
I know your mother would be
very proud of you.

900
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:09,203
It doesn'’t always feel like it.

901
01:02:09,247 --> 01:02:11,379
She used to talk about you
all the time, you know.

902
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:15,035
When she was sick,
I'’d visit her in the hospital.

903
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:17,646
She'’d be braggin'
about her little girl

904
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,737
livin'’ her dream
down in L.A.,

905
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,696
how she'’d never
let anything knock her down.

906
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,699
Oh, yeah, she'’s proud of you.

907
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,789
The only thing about
you being so far away

908
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:33,401
was that she said
she missed hearing you sing.

909
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:35,055
She said that?

910
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:39,581
She always loved
listening to you in church

911
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:41,192
on Sunday morning.

912
01:02:41,235 --> 01:02:44,238
Like an angel, she said.

913
01:02:44,282 --> 01:02:47,894
Whether you realize it or not,

914
01:02:47,938 --> 01:02:51,898
you came back
exactly when you were needed.

915
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:53,726
God knows it,

916
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,860
your father knows it,

917
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:58,949
and your mother knows it.

918
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,213
Do you believe in miracles?

919
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:04,128
Why?

920
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,522
These things
have been happening.

921
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:09,176
Heck, I would think I'’m crazy,

922
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,569
but I don'’t know.

923
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:16,662
I think I'’m starting
to believe.

924
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,669
I believe miracles
happen every day.

925
01:03:23,712 --> 01:03:26,933
People just have
to stop and notice.

926
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,941
You think Mom would like it?

927
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:04,074
She would'’ve loved it.

928
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:34,104
Hey, this is Abby. Can'’t get
to the phone right now.

929
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:36,454
Please leave a message. Bye!

930
01:05:36,497 --> 01:05:39,196
Abby, listen, it'’s me.

931
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:41,981
Look, I'’ve changed my mind.
I don'’t think...

932
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:45,028
Mailbox full.

933
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:58,780
You know, not long ago I went
to visit a man in his house.

934
01:05:58,824 --> 01:06:00,652
The man had hurt himself,

935
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:05,744
and the doctor said he wasn'’t
supposed to move too much.

936
01:06:05,787 --> 01:06:09,661
I said to him,
"Christmas is coming.

937
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:13,143
Have you given any thought
as to what you might want?"

938
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:16,320
The man thought about it
for a minute,

939
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:20,193
and he told me that
his wife had passed away,

940
01:06:20,237 --> 01:06:23,327
and their only child
had moved out.

941
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:30,073
He said, "There is nothing left
to celebrate."

942
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:37,384
Well, I told him that as long
as there was life on this earth,

943
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:42,911
that there is always
plenty to celebrate.

944
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:45,088
Not long after we spoke,

945
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:47,003
the man'’s daughter
returned home

946
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:48,526
to help take care of him.

947
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:52,312
You see, God had not only
given him what he wanted,

948
01:06:52,356 --> 01:06:55,707
but God had given him
what he needed!

949
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,536
And today she'’s here with us.

950
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:00,277
Praise God.

951
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,497
Jennifer Moore,

952
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,759
welcome home.

953
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:10,678
You know, I was hoping we might
be able to persuade her

954
01:07:10,722 --> 01:07:12,985
to sing us a little song.

955
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,031
Yeah.

956
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:22,342
For your mother.

957
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:26,390
Fine, fine.

958
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:28,174
Jennifer, please.

959
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:43,239
I love you, Mom.

960
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:50,942
Got it?

961
01:10:56,426 --> 01:10:59,124
You know, I'’ve been alone
so long, I, uh...

962
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:02,606
never realized how much
I enjoy spending time with you.

963
01:11:04,085 --> 01:11:07,828
Dad, I know that all this time

964
01:11:07,872 --> 01:11:11,876
you think I'’ve been
avoiding you or too busy.

965
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:14,618
The truth is, after Mom died,

966
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:19,666
I should'’ve been here for you,
and I wasn'’t.

967
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:21,102
I'’m sorry.

968
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:22,974
You'’re home now.

969
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:26,499
Just the way
your mother wanted you.

970
01:11:26,543 --> 01:11:28,458
What do you mean?

971
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:30,068
The house.

972
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:32,810
She wanted you to take it.

973
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:34,290
What?

974
01:11:35,943 --> 01:11:39,599
For your family.
She wanted it for you.

975
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,951
That'’s why
I could never sell it,

976
01:11:43,995 --> 01:11:46,519
no matter how old
and decrepit I get.

977
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:49,174
It'’s yours.

978
01:11:49,217 --> 01:11:52,656
Just the way she wanted it.

979
01:11:52,699 --> 01:11:55,354
I had no idea.

980
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:58,618
Come on. Let'’s go home.

981
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:00,446
Yeah.

982
01:12:02,143 --> 01:12:04,320
Watch your leg.

983
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:12,415
Right this way.
You'’re gonna love it.

984
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:13,720
Oh, no.

985
01:12:13,764 --> 01:12:15,505
What'’s Abby doing?

986
01:12:15,548 --> 01:12:19,160
So as you can see, the curb
appeal is quite tremendous.

987
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:21,075
What about the house next door?

988
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:22,816
It'’s kind of an eyesore.

989
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,732
I heard that the owner is
thinking about tearing it down.

990
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:27,343
You know, starting over.

991
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:29,388
Abby! I need to talk to you.

992
01:12:29,432 --> 01:12:31,564
Hey! I didn'’t know you were
doing a Christmas thing.

993
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:32,652
It looks great.

994
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:33,740
You gotta go.

995
01:12:33,784 --> 01:12:36,874
Abby, what'’s going on?

996
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,223
Hi, Mr. M.

997
01:12:38,266 --> 01:12:39,529
You must be the owner.

998
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:43,097
Yes, this is my house.
Why? Who are you?

999
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:46,231
- You never told him?
- Told me what?

1000
01:12:46,274 --> 01:12:48,842
- Dad...
- What am I missing?

1001
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,322
I sort of...

1002
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,542
I asked Abby
if she would sell the house.

1003
01:12:52,585 --> 01:12:54,500
What do you mean,
sell the house?

1004
01:12:54,544 --> 01:12:56,372
Okay, you weren'’t
doing that well,

1005
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:59,244
and, you know, eventually
I knew I'’d have to leave.

1006
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:01,420
I told you your mother
wanted you to have it!

1007
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:02,900
But I didn'’t know that.

1008
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,051
You should have said something.

1009
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:05,206
You should'’ve talked to me.

1010
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,208
I know I should have!
I know!

1011
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:09,515
I think you should go.

1012
01:13:09,559 --> 01:13:11,778
Mr. M., Jennifer is
just trying to help you.

1013
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:13,911
I don'’t want anyone
trying to help me,

1014
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:17,654
and I'’d appreciate it if you
all would get off my lawn!

1015
01:13:17,697 --> 01:13:19,786
Sir, you don'’t have
to be mean about it.

1016
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:22,006
Fine! Merry Christmas!

1017
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:24,225
Now go!

1018
01:13:24,269 --> 01:13:25,551
If you could just
give me a second to...

1019
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:28,186
- We'’re not interested.
- Goodbye.

1020
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:30,275
It'’s just a misunderstanding.

1021
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:33,887
I'’m... I'm sorry.

1022
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:35,585
Look...

1023
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:40,111
Dad. Dad.

1024
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:46,247
Is that why you came back?

1025
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:47,901
To sell my house
out from under me?

1026
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:50,904
No. I wanted to make sure
you were okay,

1027
01:13:50,948 --> 01:13:52,515
that you were someplace safe.

1028
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:54,734
You mean in a nursing home.

1029
01:13:54,778 --> 01:13:56,040
They'’re called...

1030
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:58,608
They'’re called
assisted-care facilities.

1031
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:01,611
They'’re called nursing homes.

1032
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:05,266
Do you have any idea
how happy I'’ve been

1033
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:08,618
these last couple days?

1034
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:12,099
That we'’ve been able to put
everything behind us?

1035
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:15,189
That we'’ve had
this second chance?

1036
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:21,195
Look, I was gonna
call the whole thing off.

1037
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:23,197
I just didn'’t get a chance.

1038
01:14:23,241 --> 01:14:25,548
You know what?

1039
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:27,811
I think you should leave.

1040
01:14:29,987 --> 01:14:34,600
Dad, I know I should'’ve
talked to you about it.

1041
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:35,993
I just...

1042
01:14:36,036 --> 01:14:38,386
Just go.

1043
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:49,876
Please, Dad!

1044
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:22,561
"Dear Jack, this might be

1045
01:15:22,605 --> 01:15:24,998
the last letter you get from me
for a while.

1046
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:27,261
I thought I was going
to stick around,

1047
01:15:27,305 --> 01:15:29,829
but the truth is
I made a mistake,

1048
01:15:29,873 --> 01:15:33,920
and I'’ve hurt someone's
feelings very badly.

1049
01:15:33,964 --> 01:15:37,271
I think the best thing for me
is to go away for a while

1050
01:15:37,315 --> 01:15:39,535
until things calm down.

1051
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:42,059
I hope to come back soon,

1052
01:15:42,102 --> 01:15:44,670
and I'’ll hope that you'll
still be getting my letters

1053
01:15:44,714 --> 01:15:46,542
when I do.

1054
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:49,283
Until then, I'’ll miss you.

1055
01:15:50,284 --> 01:15:52,373
Love, Jennifer."

1056
01:16:41,248 --> 01:16:43,381
And this is Jennifer Moore.

1057
01:16:43,424 --> 01:16:46,427
Jennifer, these are some of
the executives from Hong Kong.

1058
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:48,734
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1059
01:16:48,778 --> 01:16:51,694
Uh, Jennifer just got back
late last night.

1060
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:54,740
Unfortunately her father
wasn'’t doing too well.

1061
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:56,394
I'’m so sorry to hear that.

1062
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:58,309
Is he feeling better now?

1063
01:16:58,352 --> 01:17:00,050
Yes, he is.
Thank you.

1064
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:01,312
I'’m glad.

1065
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:03,314
Will he be joining you
for Christmas?

1066
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:06,752
I don'’t think so.
Not this year.

1067
01:17:06,796 --> 01:17:10,451
Um, she was just finishing up
a wonderful presentation,

1068
01:17:10,495 --> 01:17:12,932
which will pitch your company
to our investors.

1069
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:17,023
- Great. I look forward to it.
- Wonderful.

1070
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:19,765
Okay, well, I think
we'’re gonna be moving on.

1071
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:22,638
We'’re gonna grab lunch at Avenue
if you'’d like to join us.

1072
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:25,292
Oh, you know, I have
so much to catch up on,

1073
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:26,903
but you gentlemen have fun.

1074
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:30,080
Always working hard.
Okay, right this way, gentlemen.

1075
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:36,477
If you need to be
with your father,

1076
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:38,871
why don'’t you go?

1077
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:42,005
It'’s not that easy.

1078
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:47,053
There is an old Chinese proverb:

1079
01:17:47,097 --> 01:17:49,969
"When the winds of change blow,

1080
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:51,667
some build walls...

1081
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:54,713
while others
build windmills."

1082
01:17:54,757 --> 01:18:00,719
In life, it is better to be
flexible than stubborn.

1083
01:18:04,027 --> 01:18:05,115
Thank you.

1084
01:18:11,382 --> 01:18:12,731
Merry Christmas.

1085
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:15,734
Merry Christmas.

1086
01:18:27,267 --> 01:18:28,921
The strangest Wednesday.

1087
01:18:34,013 --> 01:18:36,146
For him, December 22nd
was a Wednesday.

1088
01:18:46,547 --> 01:18:48,898
That was three years ago.

1089
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:51,596
Oh, no.

1090
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:54,140
Hey, you change your mind
about lunch?

1091
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:56,209
Can you take over
the pitch book for me?

1092
01:18:56,253 --> 01:18:57,776
- Um...
- Please.

1093
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:58,995
Sure.

1094
01:18:59,038 --> 01:19:01,867
"Dear Jack,
what I'’m about to say

1095
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:03,913
I was told
that I shouldn'’t tell you,

1096
01:19:03,956 --> 01:19:05,915
that there could be
consequences.

1097
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:08,874
But I'’m tired of playing
everything safe.

1098
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:11,050
There'’s something
you need to know.

1099
01:19:11,094 --> 01:19:13,226
The reason you'’re no longer
living in your house,

1100
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:16,055
the reason
your parents moved away,

1101
01:19:16,099 --> 01:19:17,665
and the reason I can'’t see you

1102
01:19:17,709 --> 01:19:20,059
for this
or any other Christmas...

1103
01:19:20,103 --> 01:19:22,061
is that you were killed
Christmas Day

1104
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:24,847
in a car accident
three years ago.

1105
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:26,718
That'’s tomorrow.

1106
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:30,200
Please do not go anywhere
on Christmas Day.

1107
01:19:30,243 --> 01:19:33,725
Stay home.
Work on your paintings.

1108
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,509
I love you, Jack,

1109
01:19:35,553 --> 01:19:38,774
and I'’m sorry it's taken me
so long to realize that.

1110
01:19:38,817 --> 01:19:42,952
But please,
I cannot lose you again.

1111
01:19:42,995 --> 01:19:44,431
Wait for me.

1112
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:46,477
We can be together soon.

1113
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,174
Love, Jennifer."

1114
01:20:03,146 --> 01:20:04,800
Come on!

1115
01:20:14,984 --> 01:20:15,985
Wait.

1116
01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:20,554
Okay.

1117
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:22,034
You can do this.

1118
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:26,996
I wish...

1119
01:20:30,521 --> 01:20:33,132
I wish I could save him.

1120
01:20:54,023 --> 01:20:55,633
Jack!

1121
01:21:00,768 --> 01:21:02,945
Jack, I'’m so sorry.

1122
01:21:50,296 --> 01:21:51,732
Jennifer?

1123
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:53,952
I'’ve been trying to call you.
Are you okay?

1124
01:21:53,996 --> 01:21:56,912
- Did you go back to L.A.?
- He'’s gone.

1125
01:21:56,955 --> 01:21:59,610
I tried to write another card.

1126
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:01,481
I tried to warn him,
but he'’s gone.

1127
01:22:01,525 --> 01:22:03,570
Wh-What are you talking about?

1128
01:22:03,614 --> 01:22:05,398
Jack!

1129
01:22:05,442 --> 01:22:09,446
He was writing those cards
from three years ago, Abby,

1130
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:10,926
the year he died.

1131
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:13,145
I tried to write him
before Christmas,

1132
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:14,755
but it was too late.

1133
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:16,757
And now my dad
won'’t talk to me, Abby.

1134
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:18,411
I lost everything.

1135
01:22:18,455 --> 01:22:19,978
Where are you now?

1136
01:22:20,022 --> 01:22:22,894
I'’m here.
I'’m in Berkeley.

1137
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,288
Why don'’t you come over?
You can spend the night.

1138
01:22:25,331 --> 01:22:27,029
Are you sure it'’s okay?

1139
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:29,640
Come on over. I'’m sure we'll
figure something out, okay?

1140
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:32,295
Okay, okay, I-I'’ll be there.

1141
01:22:49,747 --> 01:22:51,183
Hey.

1142
01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:52,706
Rise and shine.

1143
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:56,536
Abby. What day is it?

1144
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,582
It'’s Christmas, silly.

1145
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:02,020
- I didn'’t miss it?
- No, you didn'’t.

1146
01:23:06,285 --> 01:23:08,157
Are you here for my last rites?

1147
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,682
No. Just making sure
you'’re okay.

1148
01:23:11,725 --> 01:23:13,292
How'’s she lookin', Doc?

1149
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:16,817
Uh, surprisingly, not bad.

1150
01:23:16,861 --> 01:23:19,516
Your vitals look good,
and the X-ray came back.

1151
01:23:19,559 --> 01:23:23,389
It doesn'’t look like
anything major was broken.

1152
01:23:23,433 --> 01:23:24,608
Thanks, Brad.

1153
01:23:24,651 --> 01:23:27,045
Yeah. You take care.

1154
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:31,049
Uh, I'’ll be right back.

1155
01:23:41,233 --> 01:23:43,583
Hey, kiddo.

1156
01:23:43,627 --> 01:23:44,802
Dad.

1157
01:23:45,672 --> 01:23:46,891
How you doin'’?

1158
01:23:46,934 --> 01:23:49,111
I'’m fine.
I'’m... I'm fine.

1159
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:52,853
Look, I just...
I want to say I'’m sorry.

1160
01:23:52,897 --> 01:23:53,898
I'’m so sorry.

1161
01:23:53,941 --> 01:23:56,335
Sorry about what?

1162
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:00,209
Abby, look, I changed my mind.

1163
01:24:00,252 --> 01:24:03,038
I don'’t want to sell the house.

1164
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:04,822
What are you talking about?

1165
01:24:04,865 --> 01:24:07,085
I'’m gonna stay here.

1166
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:08,913
I'’m gonna take care of you.

1167
01:24:08,956 --> 01:24:10,784
But what about you-know-who?

1168
01:24:10,828 --> 01:24:13,222
- Who?
- You know.

1169
01:24:14,701 --> 01:24:16,051
She'’s awake.

1170
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,406
But you'’re...

1171
01:24:23,449 --> 01:24:24,929
They said you may have
hit your head.

1172
01:24:24,972 --> 01:24:26,452
- You'’re here.
- You know what?

1173
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,237
I brought a friend, too.

1174
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,587
Look, I'’m sorry I wasn't here
when you awoke,

1175
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:32,980
but your dad needed a ride,

1176
01:24:33,024 --> 01:24:35,679
and parking around here
was a real bear.

1177
01:24:35,722 --> 01:24:37,289
You got the card?

1178
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:40,118
I'’m just glad you're okay.

1179
01:24:46,559 --> 01:24:49,127
Hey, is everything all right?
Your heart rate is...

1180
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:50,433
Thank you. She'’s fine.

1181
01:24:50,476 --> 01:24:53,262
They'’re having a moment.
Merry Christmas.

1182
01:24:54,872 --> 01:24:56,352
I'’m so happy you're here.

1183
01:24:56,395 --> 01:24:59,137
You know what?
It'’s like my mom always said:

1184
01:24:59,181 --> 01:25:00,878
It'’s never too late
to get it right.

1185
01:25:00,921 --> 01:25:02,575
I love you.

1186
01:25:02,619 --> 01:25:06,275
Oh, my God. I can'’t believe
how good it feels to say that.

1187
01:25:06,318 --> 01:25:08,842
I love you, too.

1188
01:25:29,211 --> 01:25:32,083
- Is that for me?
- It'’s for you.

1189
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:41,266
This is amazing.

1190
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:45,183
Well, I spent quite a few years
working on it,

1191
01:25:45,227 --> 01:25:48,752
waiting until I could finally
have the real thing.

1192
01:25:48,795 --> 01:25:50,623
Merry Christmas.

1193
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:52,451
Merry Christmas.
