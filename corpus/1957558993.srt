00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,600

00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,079
the star of "Chelsea",

00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,760
and "Hello, Privilege.
It's Me, Chelsea."

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,960
Please put your hands together
for Chelsea Handler.

6
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,799
CHELSEA HANDLER EVOLUTION

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,119
Yeah! What's up, New Jersey?

8
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,119
I'm so happy
you came out tonight with me.

9
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,759
Look at this beautiful train station.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,479
Built in 1889 for immigrants.
Remember when that was cool?

11
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:00,159
I decided to wear white tonight,
'cause I'm expecting my period.

12
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,280
Before we get started... Hi, ladies.
Hi, everybody. So nice to be out!

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,799
I wanna make
a serious announcement...

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,519
to my husband, if he happens
to be sitting in this audience tonight.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,280
My future husband, sorry.
I wanna dedicate this show to him.

16
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,599
But there seems to be a misconception,
and I get this a lot from white men.

17
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,599
Here's a Black man
and a white man together.

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,319
Perfect!
Let's talk to you together.

19
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,000
There seems to be a misconception
that I only date Black men.

20
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,400
So I wanna use
this opportunity to make a PSA

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,640
for white men who are scared
of women who have dated Black guys.

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Beavers retract.

23
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,799
They don't just stay open.

24
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,640
They go back to simpler times.

25
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,719
I went through a difficult time
about three or four years ago,

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,199
whenever the last election was.

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,800
I couldn't believe
that we elected that fucking baboon!

28
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,599
And when you live in Los Angeles,
as I do,

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
when you're going
through a difficult time

30
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,159
and you have high levels
of rage or outrage or anger,

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,400
however you want to frame it,
people wanna talk to you.

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,039
And they wanna use words
like "manifest"...

33
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,159
and "gratitude"...

34
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,479
and "kale".

35
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,479
And I'm not into shit like that.

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,599
I'm all for spiritual people,
or spirituality, I should say.

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,599
Spirituality is fine with me
as a component of your lifestyle.

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Sure, go for it.

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,039
My problem with spiritual people
is that spiritual people

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,719
can sometimes be
giant fucking assholes.

41
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,439
I feel spiritual
when I'm on mushrooms.

42
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,680
I'm not into rocks
and stones and chakras

43
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,319
or walking into Whole Foods,

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,919
hearing phrases
like "artisanal deodorant"...

45
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,879
or "micro panic attack".

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,040
It's like, fuck you!
That's a micro panic attack.

47
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,919
Los Angeles is a tricky place if you're
going through a vulnerable time.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,120
And if you're not careful,

49
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,199
you could end up
at one of those silent retreats

50
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,240
in the woods
of Topanga Canyon,

51
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,240
finger blasting yourself
all weekend long.

52
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,319
That's what happened to me.

53
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,479
I had a girlfriend who came
to visit me from high school,

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,599
from Nueva Jersey.

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,879
That's Spanish for "New Jersey".

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
De nada.

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,360
Any other questions
about Spanish?

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,680
And she was hanging
out with me for a couple of days,

59
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,319
and after hanging out with her,

60
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,120
I said, yeah, I would be willing
to go to a silent retreat.

61
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,839
And we went.

62
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,439
And it was exactly what I had imagined.
It was in the woods of Topanga Canyon.

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,279
And we get there
and there's just girls everywhere

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,120
and Lululemon everywhere.

65
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,120
Leggings and deep stretching
for no reason.

66
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,160
A lot of room-temperature water.
That annoys me.

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,759
As if water could get any more boring,
let's heat that shit up and hand it out.

68
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,879
And there were three veterinarians
alone in a circle.

69
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,759
I'm like,
that's suspicious to me.

70
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,360
I don't like to see vets out of office.
And not running in packs, either.

71
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,680
I have a problem with vets.
I respect what they're trying to do.

72
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,639
The intention's nice.
You wanna work with animals, great.

73
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,199
They're just too vague.
All of their answers are too vague.

74
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,079
I've had too many rescue dogs,
I've had seven or eight,

75
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,879
and I've brought them in every single
time to find out how old they are.

76
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,319
And no matter what vet I'm seeing,
the answer is the same.

77
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,279
"They're somewhere
between the ages of 4 and 12".

78
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,759
What kind of answear is that?

79
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,480
What kind of margin of error...
Are you a doctor or not?

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,759
We know that kangaroos
were alive on the island of Australia

81
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,680
25 million years ago
because of a half of a tooth.

82
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,399
And you can't tell me how
old this fuckin' chow chow is?

83
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,639
Honestly, go fuck yourselves.

84
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,319
So anyway, we're at this retreat,
and I was already have the attitude

85
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,079
that I'm not into this stuff,

86
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,921
but I was trying to be open minded
because of the level of my outrage.

87
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,519
So then, I heard
that there's gonna be a sound bath.

88
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,319
I didn't know... In the woods.
I didn't know what a sound bath was.

89
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,160
I thought,
"DJ's will shower with us."

90
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,879
And we go up to the woods
and there's more stretching,

91
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,720
camel toe everywhere.

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,639
So annoying. Kale chips.
I'm like, it's 85 degrees.

93
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,439
Who wants to suck
on a kale chip?

94
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,120
Then I saw a ukulele.
I'm like, no, you don't.

95
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:59,759
I know that is gonna end up somewhere
that I'm not gonna like, okay.

96
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,839
This is classic,
classic finger blasting setting.

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,720
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on my Pikachu.

98
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,519
So I walked out,
and I found some other girl.

99
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,240
I left the woods and I'm like,
"What's up? Who's got drugs?"

100
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,680
She's like, "We're having
a ceremony tomorrow night"

101
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,879
"with toad venom,
and it's called 5-DME-OT."

102
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,839
And I was like,
"Okay, I'll take mine now."

103
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,759
Let's party. And she said,
"It's not really that kind of drug."

104
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,359
I'm like, "Listen bitch,
I'll decide what kind of drug this is."

105
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,839
I understand some people
are not built for drugs and alcohol,

106
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,079
and I respect that.

107
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,839
I don't ever want
to get anybody involved

108
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,759
with drugs and alcohol
that can't handle it,

109
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,079
but I believe that I am.

110
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,639
I believe that I'm built
for the apocalypse...

111
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,040
which, by the way, we're in.

112
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,040
I've done every drug.
I've experimented with everything.

113
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,639
Unless there's a new drug that came
out this morning, I've tried it.

114
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,600
I did a special on Netflix.
I went down to Peru

115
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,279
and did ayahuasca
on camera with a shaman,

116
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,639
and they said,
"No, you can't do that."

117
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,000
"People vomit
and shit their pants."

118
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,240
I was like, "I won't do that.
I'm too advanced."

119
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm like, "You think I'm gonna ruin
a buzz by defecating on myself?"

120
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,440
"Never is that going to happen."

121
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,000
I took my SATs tripping on acid.

122
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,960
I didn't get into college, but I had
a great time taking that test.

123
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,600
And I've never had a bad time.

124
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,200
Like everybody always
has a bad time with drugs.

125
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,639
There's always a girl
in the corner for eight hours, like...

126
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,399
That's never me.
I've had never a bad experience.

127
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,639
Nothing that I would frame
as negative, anyway.

128
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,399
The one time,
I had a questionable experience.

129
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,720
This was 15 years ago,
before cannabis was the way it was,

130
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,320
before there were labels.

131
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,879
And a man had given me a cookie.
And I ate that cookie.

132
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,559
And I thought
I was at a movie theater.

133
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,480
And when the movie ended,
I got up to leave the movie theater,

134
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,480
only to find out
I was on an airplane.

135
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,960
That was shocking.

136
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,159
'Cause I didn't just get up;
I got my shit together.

137
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,720
I got my coat, and it had a belt.
It must have been winter.

138
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,679
And then I got my bag
out of the overhead bin

139
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,480
and pulled it down as if that's
how you leave a movie theater.

140
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,639
It never occurred to me

141
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,001
this isn't what you've ever done
leaving a theater before.

142
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,039
It was rote. I was like,
"I better get my bag."

143
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,840
"I better get my things."
And then I was like, yeah.

144
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,440
Up the aisle,
straight to the little window

145
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,639
that you look out
if you're trying to escape.

146
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,439
And I'm looking
at the other passengers

147
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,840
like, what are these idiots
waiting for, the credits?

148
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,080
I was staring
out that little bagel window,

149
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,040
and then I feel tap, tap, tap.

150
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,639
And I turn around,
and the flight attendant's like,

151
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,080
"Sweetie, there are three more hours
left on this flight."

152
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,320
And I was like, "I know".

153
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,840
I was like,
"I'm going to the bathroom to change."

154
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,240
Just layered on my lies. I was like,
"You're not gonna shame me."

155
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,960
And then I walked up to the bathroom
and shoved my suitcase inside.

156
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,360
Apparently not only
was I not at a movie theatre

157
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,559
I had never flown
on an airplane before,

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,879
and knowing that you can't bring
your suitcase

159
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,720
into that little urine-soaked wet box
and change your outfit, but I did.

160
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,919
I put on a tube top
to prove a point.

161
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,080
And I walked back out
with my head held high.

162
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,480
I was like, do not make eye contact!
You are a queen!

163
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,840
I sat back down in my seat,
and I was like, "What's next?"

164
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,080
It's like, this is like an adventure.
I wonder where I'm going.

165
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,200
And who's gonna pick me up
when I get there?

166
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,240
And then I put in another
movie, and I watched that.

167
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,799
And when that ended, I was like,
"Do not get up, bitch."

168
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,199
And then I wrote on a piece of paper,
"You are on a plane."

169
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,039
It's not like you can look over
at your neighbor and be like,

170
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,399
"Speaking of nothing,
where are we headed?"

171
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,320
Anyway, so, that was the worst
experience I've ever had,

172
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,840
and I would frame
that as a B-plus.

173
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,320
I'm back at the retreat and this woman,
I don't remember her name,

174
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,000
who had the toad venom,
we'll call her Sierra Mist.

175
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,320
So she and I are walking down
to this cottage to do it,

176
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,360
and then this other dipsy doodle
comes running out of the bushes

177
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,920
and she's like, "Are you guys getting
high?" I'm like, "Back the fuck up."

178
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,840
First of all, I don't like interlopers,
you know what I mean?

179
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,375
I don't wanna do drugs with somebody
if it's their first time.

180
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,679
I don't have time for that shit.

181
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,000
And a lot of people depend on me
because I'm a pharmacological intuit.

182
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,200
I could look at you and say,
"You're gonna thrive on this drug,"

183
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,919
"you're gonna do better on Xanax,
you might prefer a Vicodin,"

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,679
"you might like an Adderall."

185
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,159
I can tell by looking at your body
and talking to you for five minutes

186
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,559
what drug you are going
to respond to.

187
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,080
Don't talk to me
about melatonin either, people.

188
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,879
Melatonin is for beginners.

189
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,879
Talk to me
after you've taken an Ambien

190
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,000
and woken up
at a Harrah's blackjack table,

191
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,000
$500 up,
with your eyeshades on.

192
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,960
Then you can talk to me
about fuckin' melatonin.

193
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,639
So a lot of people know this about me.
My sister she had trouble

194
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,039
making speeches at work,
'cause she would get dry mouth.

195
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,360
So I prescribed her Propranolol.

196
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,399
A beta blocker. I said, "Take one
30 minutes before you speak publicly."

197
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,960
She's been promoted twice.

198
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,081
She called me. She's like, "Thank God
we have a doctor in the family."

199
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,039
Magnesium 07
by Aerobic Life

200
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,056
for women who have trouble
going to the bathroom.

201
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,519
A lot of women have trouble
going to the bathroom every day.

202
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,279
If you take three of those every night
for three nights,

203
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,840
you would have solid shidoobees
for the rest of your life.

204
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,720
If you take 4, you will get diarrhea.
Some girls like that.

205
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,480
If you do, take four.
You'll get it.

206
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,799
Doxycycline will kill anything
in your system.

207
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,759
Acne and malaria.

208
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,759
2 doxycycline twice a day for 10 days.
Never on an empty stomach.

209
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,519
You'll vomit, okay? It will knock
anything out of your system.

210
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,200
I take one every morning
just not to fuck around.

211
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,960
I looked at this girl, this other 7UP
Light girl that came out of the woods,

212
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,360
and I could tell by her body type that
I didn't want her to rain on my party.

213
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,000
And a lot of people think,

214
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,240
heavier or taller people can handle
more drugs and alcohol.

215
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,720
That is not true either.

216
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,200
It's those skinny little bitches
you have to watch out for,

217
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,440
the ones who can do coke all night

218
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,039
and then take one of those Lime
scooters to work in the morning.

219
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,559
I said, "Listen, I'm gonna do this,
sweetie, and I'll get back to you."

220
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,080
So I go down with Sierra,
we go to this cottage, and she's like,

221
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:01,039
"Okay, you know, this is gonna be
about 10 or 12 minutes."

222
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,480
And I'm like, "What?"
Like, That's not fun, 10 or 12 minutes.

223
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,440
I go, "Just give me a double dose."

224
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,600
And she said,
"No, why don't you try it first?"

225
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,320
"It's transcendental,"
is the word that she used.

226
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,320
So I was already bored.

227
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,119
And then she said,
"You need to set an intention."

228
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,720
I was like, "I don't care."
"Why don't you set one for me."

229
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,360
And she said,
"You need to set it."

230
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm like,
To be less of a cunt, okay?

231
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,240
Is that an intention?
'Cause I would like to do that."

232
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,759
So I take a hit, and it's in,
a little crack pipe, or whatever.

233
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,799
I take a hit,
and it's immediately terrible.

234
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,559
Like, the most terrible thi-dark,
swirly greens and purples.

235
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,480
It was like
I was on a roller coaster

236
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,559
and my head was in a vice
and I couldn't move.

237
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,239
And then I open my eye;
I'm like, "Fuck. She's still here."

238
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,960
I was like, "I don't like this,
I don't like this,"

239
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,360
and I was like,
"You're gonna pass away today."

240
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,279
That's what's happening." And then
I'm like, "No, don't be so dramatic."

241
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,296
"You're not gonna pass away.
You've received brain damage,"

242
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,200
"but you're already a little bit on
the spectrum, so don't even worry"...

243
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,176
not that people on the spectrum
have brain damage,

244
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,399
but I definitely have it,
and I'm on some spectrum.

245
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm sitting there, and I am sweating,
just drenched in my own sweat.

246
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,279
I'm ripping my clothes off
and I'm hyperventilating

247
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,240
and I'm like, "Don't say anything."

248
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
And when I couldn't wait anymore,
I was like,

249
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,199
"You have to make this stop.
I'm in a matrix."

250
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,840
And she puts her hand on my chest
in between my naked boobs

251
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,799
and she's like, "It's okay.

252
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,240
You're in a parallel universe."

253
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
I was like, "Bitch, I don't have
any Bitcoin. Get me out of there."

254
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,320
And finally,
I started to come out of it,

255
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,120
and I was so, first of all,
embarrassed, 'cause I was nude.

256
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,519
That I had lost complete control.
I was like, "My God."

257
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,000
And I open my eyes and I look at her
and I look down at my body

258
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,080
and I was completely nude.

259
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,440
I had forgotten that, that morning,
I had put on nude underwear.

260
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,160
So when I looked down,
I just saw a bald bump.

261
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,359
And I was like,
"You shaved my beaver.

262
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,360
I knew something like that was
gonna happen this weekend."

263
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,400
I had to get my stuff together, like
with the walk of shame in the morning.

264
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,640
Turning away from her
when she's already seen my nude body.

265
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,319
I'm covering myself,
picking up my clothes.

266
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,039
And then I'm like, "Thank you."

267
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,680
'Cause that's what girls do.

268
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,240
We say thank you even
when we've had a terrible time.

269
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,840
I did it two more times, and I'm like,
"I definitely don't like this."

270
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,640
And then my curiosity
had reached its conclusion.

271
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,680
And I figured it was time
to go to a real therapist.

272
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,759
I needed to talk to somebody,

273
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,480
but I was embarrassed
that I needed to talk to somebody.

274
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:05,119
I had seen doctors
and therapists before,

275
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,880
but never with the intention of fixing
anything that really ran deep.

276
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,960
I didn't have the mental equipment
to let anyone see me

277
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,320
for anything other than what
I'd become, which was strong.

278
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,799
And because of that strength,

279
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,039
I wasn't about to sit
in a doctor's office and cry.

280
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,640
Crying for other people, my friends,
about their problems, sure.

281
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,720
But crying for myself about myself
was absolutely out of the question.

282
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,160
So I sat down, this guy's name
is Dan, he's a psychiatrist,

283
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,319
and I said, "I have a lot of anger
and outrage about Donald Trump,"

284
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,600
"and people are running
when they see me coming."

285
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,039
"I'm losing friends.
I'm losing family members."

286
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,480
He said, "Let's talk about that."
I said, "I travel a lot."

287
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,519
"I'm in airports a lot. And I check in
to the first-class lounge,"

288
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,519
"and then I immediately
go over to the Fox News section"

289
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,759
"and start going off on people."

290
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,880
I'm like, "You fuckin' racist!"
And then I run out.

291
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,880
And then I come back
and I'm like,

292
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,840
"Do you have a daughter that doesn't
have any rights? 'Cause she won't."

293
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,360
And then I run back in; I'm like,
"Are you still a racist?"

294
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,839
Dan is really understanding, he's like,
"It's a really tricky time right now."

295
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,839
"Emotions are high.
A lot of people are enervated."

296
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,200
I said, "Dan, I went to the airport
today, and I didn't have a flight."

297
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,799
I told him that,
before the election,

298
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,119
my biggest privileged decision
was whether or not

299
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,599
to install a waterslide
off of my bedroom balcony

300
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,880
into my pool for the next time
my friends and I did molly.

301
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,120
And then I told him,
the day after the election,

302
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,720
I'm driving around the streets
of Bel Air, where I live,

303
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,319
passing out water bottles
and blankets

304
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
to the Mexican workers
in my neighborhood,

305
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,000
going, "You belong here!"

306
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,680
And them looking at me like, "We're
not all illegal, you racist bitch."

307
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,440
Cheers!

308
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,160
I told him I had read
this book by Viktor Frankl

309
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,600
called "Man's Search for Meaning,"

310
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,319
and in the book there was a line
that made me put the book down.

311
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,000
And the line said, "Stop thinking
about what you expect out of life,

312
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,799
and start thinking about
what life expects out of you."

313
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,200
I was like, "What?" I'd never thought
about what life was expecting from me.

314
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,919
I was thinking
about what I was gonna get,

315
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,079
always about me
and my family and my friends

316
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,960
and my homes, my vacations.

317
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,920
I was taking,
without thinking about my contribution.

318
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,599
And I told Dan, I said, "I have
to do better. I wanna do better;

319
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,319
I need somebody
to help me do better."

320
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,559
I said,
"But I feel so hopeless,"

321
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,519
"I had read an article that men
were masturbating into plants."

322
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
That's happening.

323
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,279
When did that start? Please stand up
if you've done that and explain it.

324
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,000
Please, get up. If somebody's done
that here, you need to come forward.

325
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,279
Why did that start?

326
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,480
I mean, honestly, guys,
only a man would do such a thing.

327
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Poor plants.

328
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,400
They've been sitting around
for how many millions of millennia,

329
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,359
minding their own...
giving us air to breathe.

330
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,440
And then cavemen come running along
with their dicks waving,

331
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,160
and plants are like, "My God.
What is gonna happen now?"

332
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,119
"Are we gonna get ejaculated on?"

333
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,279
Talk about picking a victim
that can't get away.

334
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,799
Sickos. Only a man would see
a plant and be like...

335
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,079
Only a man would do that.
No woman has ever done it.

336
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,559
In the history of the world,
no woman is like, "Where's a cactus?"

337
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,359
Never! Never ever, ever.

338
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,480
Not one time. I'm willing to vouch
for all women everywhere.

339
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:20,000
Not in the history of the world
or in the future history of the world

340
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,319
will a woman ever have said

341
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,680
that she has done that
or will we catch one doing it.

342
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,200
That was a disappointing revelation.

343
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,279
It's not like women don't get turned on
at inappropriate times.

344
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:38,359
We do. I get a manicure
and a pedicure every week.

345
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,680
And she does that forearm massage
this spot right here is my sweet spot.

346
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,559
When somebody touches that,
I'm like...

347
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,480
I flutter my eyes,
start to twitch, and I'm like...

348
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,921
And then I'm like, open your eyes.
You're at a nail salon.

349
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,000
You can't do that right now.
You're in public, you sick bitch.

350
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,319
You can't audibly moan
while you're getting a massage.

351
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,799
That's not okay.

352
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,519
And in that moment,
when she does that, I'm vulnerable.

353
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,079
I would like it to continue
in different ways, maybe.

354
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,120
When she does the little dipsy doo,
if she... even if in that moment,

355
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,400
if she tried to just go a little bit
too far, like, up the leg,

356
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,519
and a little dipsy doodle,
like, a little...

357
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:27,519
Itsy-bitsy spider climbed
up the water spout.

358
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,039
Down came the rain...

359
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,519
If in that moment she did do that,
I might be like, "Yeah, quick."

360
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,559
"Do it, get in, quick,
before anybody else walks in."

361
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,279
I might even return the favor.
I doubt it, but I might.

362
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,160
I'm talking to my new psychiatrist
about this.

363
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,480
And I was like,
"Dan, I'm thinking I'm lit."

364
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,440
"You know, I know I'm, like,
woke, and I know my shit."

365
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,519
I'd started filming a documentary
for Netflix about white privilege.

366
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,920
And on the very first day
of shooting,

367
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,720
Netflix called me and said I had to go
to sexual harassment training.

368
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:10,200
I was like... again?

369
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,279
And I had been on set and this
Black woman sang this song

370
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,279
and I went to go hug her and after
I hugged her, I smacked her on the ass.

371
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,759
I said, "Way to go, sister."
She did not like that.

372
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,839
But I didn't understand why I had
to go to sexual har... I was like,

373
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,696
"Why is this sexual harassment?
I'm not hitting on her. I'm straight."

374
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,255
And they're like,
"No, it's not about that.

375
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,519
You have to call this woman
and apologize to her,

376
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,295
and you have to get her
to accept your apology."

377
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,240
And I was like...
and I was defensive.

378
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,200
And so I called her, and I was like,
"I was just trying to say,"

379
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,279
"'Hey, go girl.'
Like, sisterhood."

380
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:48,200
And she said, "It doesn't matter
what your intention was.

381
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,920
"It's how I received it, and you...

382
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,319
Black women have been defined
by their hair and their asses

383
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,279
since the beginning of time.

384
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,440
You have no right
to touch my body."

385
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,519
And she was right.

386
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,880
I have no right to touch her body
or anybody else's.

387
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,896
So I was sitting there talking
to Dan, and I was like,

388
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,559
"But can I still touch
white people?"

389
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,000
And he said, "No, no, you can't
touch anyone, Chelsea.

390
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
It's unwelcome."
And I was like,

391
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,160
"But that's how my family
and I communicate."

392
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,920
I see my sister, I grab her by the
Pikachu. I'm like, "Beep, beep!"

393
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,799
He's like, "You definitely shouldn't
be doing that with family."

394
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,599
And that was a wake-up call, 'cause
she was right and I was wrong.

395
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,000
It's not about your intention;
It's about the reception.

396
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,480
And any time you're defensive,
especially about racism,

397
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,839
you're fuckin' wrong.

398
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,799
If you're a person who doesn't think
that "white privilege" is a real thing,

399
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,440
then you're a person who's choosing
to be part of the problem

400
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,039
rather than being part
of the solution.

401
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,920
Because the world is only
getting browner and gayer,

402
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,640
so you better hop on board.

403
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,039
So that was lesson number one,
but not from Dan,

404
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,416
but I talked it through with him.

405
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,839
And then he wanted to know
about my family history.

406
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,400
I was like, that's not what this
is about. Nothin to see there.

407
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,095
I was like, my brother died
when I was a little girl;

408
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,359
My mom died,
like, 8 or 10 years ago;

409
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,640
My dad's a huge pain in the ass,
so hopefully he'll wrap things up.

410
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,080
And I said, "And quite frankly,
like, I'm ready to wrap it up, too."

411
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,616
I said, "Dan, I'm not suicidal.
You don't have to worry about it.

412
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,359
But people say life is too short.
I think it's too long."

413
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,839
There's so many annoying people
out here and I just can't deal with it.

414
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
I said, "I'm losing my patience,

415
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,000
and I need you to help me
with my lack of patience."

416
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,119
And he said, "Okay. Give me some
examples of your lack of patience."

417
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,160
I was at a table like this,
probably a little bigger,

418
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,656
with three of my girlfriends
before my session that day with Dan.

419
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,000
My girlfriend orders a turkey burger,
no onion, no bun, no cheese.

420
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,200
That's fine. We live in LA.

421
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,960
So the server comes over
with his hands full, with four plates,

422
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,560
and comes over
and we're all sitting at a table.

423
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,759
We're not even talking.
And he says, "Turkey burger?

424
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,519
Who ordered the turkey burger,
no onion, no bun, no cheese?"

425
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,519
And my friend is just sitting there
like Stevie Wonder playing the piano.

426
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,119
And he says it again, louder,
"Turkey burger.

427
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,920
No onion, no bun, no cheese."
And this is her.

428
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,240
I go, "Hey, you fucking cunt!

429
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,319
Wake up!
Is that your turkey burger?

430
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,159
You can't order that and then
forget that you ordered that."

431
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,519
I said, "So that's one example.
Would you like to hear another?"

432
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:57,640
He said, "Yes, please go on."
I said, "Airports, airports.

433
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,055
I can't deal with the people
that work at Hudson Booksellers.

434
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,359
What's wrong with those people?

435
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,559
What's up with the slowness
of the transaction?

436
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,440
I can't deal with the slowness of the
transaction "when I wanna buy a book.

437
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:11,240
Are those people...
Are they koala bears?"

438
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,239
He said, "How do you handle that?"
I go, "I have to shoplift.

439
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:20,839
I have to."

440
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,680
"I get the book, and I wave it
to the security camera..."

441
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,599
Always, I always say,
'Hey, it's me, Chelsea Handler,

442
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,039
I'm taking this 'cause your koala bear
is on a branch somewhere in the back."

443
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,095
I'm like,
"I'm gonna leave 40 bucks here,

444
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,319
and hopefully they'll find it
when she comes out from her nap,

445
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,160
if she'll find it before a stranger
does, but it's on this bookshelf.

446
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
I didn't steal. I'm leaving,"
and then I skedaddle.

447
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,880
And Dan was looking at me
when I said that.

448
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,759
I was like, "What?
Is that white privilege too?"

449
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,840
He's like, "No, Chelsea.
White people aren't even doing that."

450
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I told him, anything hotel related,
"I spend tons of times in hotels,"

451
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,136
and I get home at, like,
1:00 or 2:00 in the morning,

452
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,119
"I want my snack. I call down,"
I order what I want from room service,

453
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,440
and that's too slow."

454
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,959
At 1:30 in the morning, there should
be, like, a double speed,

455
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,720
where people are quicker
and more alert, or just quicker.

456
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,359
Then they wanna repeat
the order back to me.

457
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,599
It's like, please, whatever you think
you heard, just bring double.

458
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,680
And don't say "chicken fingers" out
loud again. I'm 45 years old.

459
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,279
I don't wanna have this conversation.
Do you know how humiliating it is

460
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,120
to call you in the first place
and order this at 1:30 in the morning?

461
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,559
And now you wanna go over it
and shame me again? Just bring them.

462
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,559
And then they bring them and that's
a whole episode in and of itself.

463
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,680
It's like, with the cart and the fork

464
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:52,279
and the knife and they set me up like
I'm fine dining at 2:00 in the morning

465
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,000
with some chicken fingers.

466
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,240
As if I'm going to use a fork and
a knife to cut up my chicken fingers.

467
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,519
You could throw them across the room
and I will catch them in my mouth.

468
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,680
Then I have to pretend I have a fake
daughter that's, you know, in the bath.

469
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,279
"My daughter's
getting out of the bath.

470
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,799
Can you wrap this up, please?
Get the fuck out of here."

471
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,680
I said, "I could get annoyed
during a hotel massage, Dan.

472
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,200
That's the kind of bitch I am."

473
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,759
The way they talk to you after a 45
minute Swedish massage is ridiculous,

474
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,480
"You're gonna wanna be careful...
getting up."

475
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Why?

476
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,599
Did you amputate my legs? Why do
I need to be careful getting up?

477
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,240
This is supposed to be more relaxing,
not stressful.

478
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,200
And then they hand you a gross Dixie
cup of room-temperature water.

479
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,400
It's like, "I don't want that."

480
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,440
"You're gonna wanna drink
a lot of water."

481
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,079
No, I won't.
Fuckin' hate water.

482
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,880
The only thing more offensive to me
than room-temperature water

483
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
is room-temperature
sparkling water.

484
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,240
That is like,
"Fuck you and your family."

485
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,759
So I said, "So what do you
think I have after all of this?"

486
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,640
I said, "What do you think it is, Dan?
What? ADD? What?"

487
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,799
He said...

488
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,279
"I don't know if you have ADD."

489
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,839
He's like,
"I have no idea if you have that.

490
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,480
You could take a test for that."
It's like, great.

491
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,799
He said, "It's eight hours long."

492
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,999
I was like, "Let's just operate under
the assumption that I have it."

493
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,920
He said, "I think you lack empathy."

494
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,559
I was like, "Like a Republican?"

495
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,759
And I had him draw the distinction
for me between sympathy and empathy

496
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,359
because I couldn't remember.
I said, "Wait, sympathy is what?"

497
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,440
"Sympathy is when you feel sorry
for somebody, or you feel badly.

498
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,335
Somebody's going through
a bad time and you help them."

499
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,200
I said, "I've got that." I would do that
for any of you sitting here.

500
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,759
I would do that for strangers.
Yeah, I've got sympathy.

501
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,359
He said, "Empathy is actually thinking
about what it's like to be that person

502
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,319
that's going
through a difficult time...

503
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,760
Actually thinking about
what it's like to be in their shoes.

504
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,279
Have you ever done that?"
I was like, "Oh, no."

505
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,080
I was like,
"That's depressing. No."

506
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,535
He said, "You need to think
about the woman

507
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,136
that's working
at the Hudson Booksellers store.

508
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,039
You need to think about the fact
that she may have more than one job,

509
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,440
or that she has to deal
with people like you all day long.

510
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,656
You have to think about the fact
that she's got a family at home."

511
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,160
And I'm like... "I have to think
about all those koala bears?"

512
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,440
But it made sense,
and I was clicking.

513
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,359
Paying somebody to tell you what is
wrong with you is a great transaction.

514
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,440
I was like,
no friends are gonna tell you,

515
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,440
I was like, "Okay, great."
I'm like, "How do I get empathy?

516
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,000
Is there an app I can download?"

517
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,400
And he said,
"Can you think of any experiences

518
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,240
that you've had recently
where you lacked empathy?"

519
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:02,519
I was like, "Yeah." And all these
light bulbs went on in my head,

520
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,480
and I remembered going to this movie
with one of my gay friends.

521
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,200
It was called "Call Me By Your Name."
It came out three years ago.

522
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:12,200
And I didn't know what the movie
was when we went in,

523
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,640
but five minutes in, I did.

524
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,839
And I was like, "What is this?"

525
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,039
I go, "A gay love story?"

526
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,839
He goes, "Yeah. Shut up."
I go, "You're so selfish."

527
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,559
And Dan looked at me:
"Do you know why that's wrong?"

528
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,799
I go, "I think so.

529
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,896
'Cause gay people have had to sit
through "straight people's love stories

530
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,640
since the beginning
of fucking time."

531
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,039
And he goes, "Yeah."

532
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:41,759
So now at my house, all I have
on a loop, all day long is gay porn.

533
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,519
Out of respect.

534
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,440
Finding out I lacked empathy
was, like, a huge light bulb,

535
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,799
and I was so excited.

536
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,960
I was on board with therapy,
and he got me from that.

537
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,376
I'm like, "You're right.
I don't have empathy."

538
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,480
"Okay, let's go, what else?
He said "What about relationships?"

539
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,199
I'm like,
"No good. I'm not good at that."

540
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,616
"Do you want to be in a relationship?"
I'm like, "Whatever you say, I'll do.

541
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,840
If you think I should be in one,
I'll go find somebody."

542
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,599
"It's tricky 'cause everybody
annoys me, and men annoy me.

543
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
Their belts annoy me, their shoes,
everything about them."

544
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,055
"But if we're gonna do something,
we should lock something down quick."

545
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,960
I'm in a denim onesie right now.

546
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,480
I have orthotics
in every pair of my shoes.

547
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,199
One of my eyes is going bald.

548
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:30,960
I have to shave my face
in the shower in the morning

549
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:33,256
to get rid of this facial hair
that I'm starting to grow.

550
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,639
I used aftershave
the other day for the first time.

551
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,880
Either I'm transitioning
and I don't know it...

552
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
or I'm in decline.

553
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,519
I saw my elbow in the mirror.
I was like, is that an iguana?

554
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,239
What happened?
And why does it look like a butt?

555
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,280
The other day I coughed,
and liquid came out of my vagina.

556
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,719
That, I blame on 50 Cent.

557
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,079
And I went to my doctor,
and she was, like,

558
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,880
doing my hormone testing,
and she's like,

559
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,760
"Okay, sweetie,
you're low on testosterone."

560
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,575
I'm like, "I don't think
I'm low on testosterone."

561
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,495
I'm like, "I could give
a man some testosterone."

562
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:19,360
I'm like, "I'm very aggressive."
She's like, "That's not testosterone."

563
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,159
So she said "You have none."
And she said,

564
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,015
"It's just better that you replace your
hormones when you start to lose them."

565
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,239
And I'm like...

566
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,559
So I started taking testosterone,

567
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,079
which is some cream you have to rub
on your leg like an older woman.

568
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,239
I was like, okay, well, here we go.
I'm just heading into elderly territory.

569
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,159
Then I go back to the same doctor,
two months later

570
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,840
and I was like,
"My hair is really thin on top.

571
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,296
Do you know
what that could be from?"

572
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
And she's like,
"Well, are you on testosterone?"

573
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,400
I'm like "Yeah, bitch,
you prescribed it to me.

574
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,679
Don't you remember?
What are you? A vet?"

575
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,440
"What are the side effects of... What
is testosterone even doing for me?"

576
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:07,519
I don't want to lose my hair.

577
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,800
And one of my eyelashes...
One of my eyes is almost bald.

578
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,199
I have two eyelashes that have
come in over the past two years.

579
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,599
Like, none will sprout.

580
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,120
And she says,
"It helps with your sex drive."

581
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,199
I'm like, "So you want me
to be bald and horny?"

582
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,519
And then what?
What's the game plan after that?

583
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,559
Just play solitaire
all by myself every night?

584
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,760
The thing is, I like older men.

585
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,695
When I was 20, that was fine,
'cause they were 40.

586
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,039
When I was 30,
I dated a 50-year-old.

587
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,440
When I was 35,
I dated a 55-year-old.

588
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,800
I'm 45. I'm not down
to fuck a 65-year-old.

589
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,400
Okay, that margin needs to close.
I'm all for 65-year-olds,

590
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,015
and I'll fuck you
when I get to be your age.

591
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,679
But not now. It's too much.

592
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,239
There is an age where men
either start to look like women,

593
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,159
or they get the slippery lips,

594
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,320
where their mouths
turn into Jacuzzis.

595
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,039
And that's when I skedaddled.

596
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,920
Which brings me to the strong
and deep sexual feelings

597
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,159
that I have developed
for Andrew Cuomo.

598
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,440
I know we all feel it.
A lot of women are feeling it.

599
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,159
When he came on the scene, he looked
like the Incredible Hulk also.

600
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,320
That big Italian gorilla.

601
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,400
It's like, "Put on your mask,"
I'm like, "I'll put my mask on."

602
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,480
He's the kind of asshole
that I will do shit for.

603
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,776
And you know he's an asshole,
and that's what I like about him.

604
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,920
An old-fashioned asshole who's gonna
tell me to sit down and shut up.

605
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,840
I want him to flatten my curve
and then I wanna flatten his curve.

606
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,639
And then I want us to apex together.

607
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,960
And he can mansplain to me all night
long about fishing or motorcycles

608
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:00,800
or whatever dumb shit he's into
that I will pretend that I am into,

609
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:03,239
because that's how down
I am with him.

610
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,280
Guess who's not jerking off
into plants? Andrew Cuomo.

611
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,599
I want him to govern me...
multiple times.

612
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:19,280
I imagine us spending long weekends
together in the Adirondacks,

613
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,880
playing games of "Clue," a game
I thought I had already mastered

614
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,119
that he's teaching me
entirely new strategies to.

615
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,360
I imagine him getting very sick

616
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,760
and me having the only medication
that can make him better.

617
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,480
Two doxycycline...
twice a day for ten days.

618
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,960
Never on an empty stomach.

619
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,920
I would keep him slightly dehydrated
so wouldn't get the slippery lips.

620
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,559
Because he's got them.

621
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:48,239
He's on the cusp of exactly
what I'm talking about.

622
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,039
That big mouth, and it's wet,
and in two more years,

623
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,280
he's gonna be able to swallow me
like a meatball sub.

624
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,776
But I need to get in there quick.

625
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,679
Once the curve flattens for good,
so will my crush.

626
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,400
I told Dan that I mostly hook up on
vacation when I travel internationally,

627
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,239
'cause there's a language barrier,
and that works to my advantage

628
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,159
when people can't really understand
what I'm saying.

629
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,119
We went on a scuba diving trip with
my girlfriend for her 40th birthday.

630
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,039
We all had to get certified and I'm not
really good in a classroom setting.

631
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,639
So I wasn't paying attention, and they
were like, everyone needs a buddy.

632
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,135
I'm like, "I don't want
to be anybody's buddy,

633
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,440
I'm not gonna help anybody
with their oxygen tank.

634
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,719
Like, everyone's...
I can't, I'm not the girl for that."

635
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,695
And my counsin is,
like, "I'll be your buddy."

636
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,519
I'm like, "But I'm not gonna save you,
so, like, we should split up,

637
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,159
and I should go
with one of the guides."

638
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,719
They had two divemasters.

639
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,960
And we're in French Polynesia,
and we're shark diving.

640
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,280
I don't know what I'm doing. I'm like,
I can't get my mask on normal.

641
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,800
I'm already underwater and shit
is, like, messed up all of a sudden.

642
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,376
I'm, like, trying to tie
my sneaker underwater.

643
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,159
That's the kind of situation I was in.
And she pulls on my leg.

644
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:59,280
And I freak out, and I look down, and
there's this huge blacktip reef shark,

645
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:02,920
and underwater, you can't tell
if it's five feet away or 20 feet away.

646
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,360
So I go to kick it immediately.

647
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,960
And I go back,
'cause I have my scuba tank on,

648
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,119
and my goggles
fill up with all this water,

649
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,440
and I can't see anything.

650
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,039
I'm sitting there, waiting to be
eaten by a shark, and I can't see.

651
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,360
You can't ascend when you scuba dive
'cause you could hurt yourself

652
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,160
and your equilibrium,
you can screw that up.

653
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,159
I'm panicking and having, I think,
my very first panic attack.

654
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,135
I don't know what else
you could describe it as.

655
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,400
I'm like... And all of a sudden,
my divemaster comes down,

656
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,840
smashes my mask against my face,
looks me in the eye, and he's like...

657
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,079
Breathe.

658
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:37,399
And then he holds my hand.
I'm like, "I'm gonna fuck you.

659
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,239
As soon as we get to land,
I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you.

660
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,159
This the hottest rescue
I've ever had.

661
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:48,800
My God,
I love a man in charge of me."

662
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,920
We did the rest of our dive holding
hands like an underwater couple.

663
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,079
I've never been so happy.

664
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,199
My friends were all looking at me,
giving me the finger underwater.

665
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,679
Then we got to the top after our dive,
and we got in the little boat,

666
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,400
and he took his mask off and
I was like, "Whoopsie doodle.

667
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,119
You're gonna wanna
put that back on."

668
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,840
I was skiing in Switzerland once

669
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,000
and I wiped out really badly
and I ended up tearing my ACL.

670
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,816
And so I'm, like,
tumbling down this mountain.

671
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,400
I was skiing out of control,
and I paid the price for it.

672
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,760
As I'm crashing, I hear...

673
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,360
And I'm like, my God,
my legs are gone.

674
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,719
I'll just be a floating neck
when I stop.

675
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,800
And I stopped, finally,
and I look up at my Austrian ski guide,

676
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,599
and he's smoking a cigarette.

677
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,280
He's like... "You just tore your ACL.
Helicopter is coming."

678
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,559
I was like, "Helicopter?
This is exciting."

679
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,039
And a helicopter came in,
we're in the Swiss Alps,

680
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,599
and my three girlfriends are
just staring at me like, "Again?"

681
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:53,480
And they come down, and these two
medics run out and they run over to me

682
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,119
and I'm lying on the ground.

683
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,256
And they're like, "Are you okay?"
And I'm trying to be tough.

684
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,920
I'm like, "Yes, I'm okay."
They're like, "Are you in pain?"

685
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,159
I'm like, "Nope."
And they're like, "No morphine?"

686
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,599
I'm like, "I'm in pain!"

687
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,119
And then they whisk me away on
the stretcher back to the helicopter,

688
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,440
and I get in the helicopter.

689
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,719
The wind is blowing; The propellers
are blowing; There's snow everywhere.

690
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,000
It was so romantic.

691
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,920
And I get in, and there's two pilots
and two medics.

692
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,880
I'm like, I'm gonna fuck
all four of these guys.

693
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,135
I'm like, this is gonna be
like a reverse gangbang.

694
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,159
Look at me!

695
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,039
So turned on,
so turned on by that rescue.

696
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:38,159
But it was a 45-minute ride
to the hospital

697
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,960
and they had these thick
German accents and I'm a Jew,

698
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,159
so I was like,
I'm not fuckin' these guys.

699
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:46,559
Not giving these Nazis
another victory.

700
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,440
I'll take one of you,
but not all four, not today.

701
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,360
When I finished telling Dan that,
he was looking at me funny

702
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,400
and he said, "I really think
you need to settle down.

703
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,880
"You need to stop.
You're moving very, very fast."

704
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,360
And it seems to me that you could
benefit a lot from meditation."

705
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,679
And I was like... Meditation, to me,
sounded like room-temperature water.

706
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,400
And he said, "I want you to commit
to meditation for three months."

707
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,360
And I was like, "Three months?
That's like a pregnancy."

708
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,760
And he was like,
"That's nine months, Chelsea.

709
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,600
Pregnancy is nine months,
and you know that."

710
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:29,039
I go, "Dan, some are nine,
some are three, some are one.

711
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,599
Don't even get me started."

712
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,960
And then cannabis became legal
in the state of California.

713
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,920
There was all of this education

714
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,719
that has been missing
for all of these years with cannabis.

715
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,095
You no longer had to take a cookie

716
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,039
and find out you were on a
transcontinental flight 7 hours later.

717
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,199
Cannabis became my gateway drug
into meditating.

718
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,000
It allowed me to, like, slow down.
It was cannabis, meditation, therapy.

719
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,960
And it was working.
I was slowing down.

720
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:00,960
And I was thinking before I spoke,
which, before I met Dan,

721
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:02,880
was something
that never even occurred to me.

722
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,039
And with microdosing,
you know, you could take,

723
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,599
like, 2 1/2 milligrams,
1 milligram, 5 milligrams,

724
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,039
you take a blueberry,
you're never gonna be off your rocker.

725
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:14,880
It sanded down the edges, and I stopped
watching the news 24 hours a day

726
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,480
and I stopped being so angry
at Donald Trump and Ivanka.

727
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,079
I was able to focus on other things,

728
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,800
I was able to be happier and lighter
and I started drinking less,

729
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,800
which was a sentence that I thought
would never ever come out of my mouth.

730
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:32,199
I was so excited because now cannabis
can be a drug that you control,

731
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,920
not a drug that controls you.

732
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,159
So I was excited about the prospects
of cannabis, not only in my life,

733
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,440
but all my friends' and family's lives.

734
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:42,599
All the people
I've been prescribing medication to

735
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:44,440
were now getting cannabis instead.

736
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,679
Anybody who had trouble sleeping,
I'm like, try this gummy.

737
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:50,119
Anybody who had anxiety,
I'm like, try this edible,

738
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,800
try this mint, try this chocolate,
covered blueberry.

739
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,719
It was helping all sorts of people,

740
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,520
and I was doing research
and collecting data

741
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:58,359
and I was keeping notes
in my medical journal.

742
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:03,480
The best part, I think, about edibles
is that you take a little edible,

743
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:05,399
and then sometimes
you forget you've taken one,

744
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:08,039
and then, like, 45 minutes later,
you're like...

745
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,280
Everything's a little bit
more sparkly.

746
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,000
Everybody's a little bit
less fuckin' annoying,

747
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,439
and you're like, yeah, I could talk
to you for another hour.

748
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,960
So my family came out to visit me
in LA for Thanksgiving,

749
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,519
and my sister's
a recovering Mormon,

750
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,880
and I said, "I want you to try this.
I know you don't like fun,

751
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:29,439
but do you wanna try
this chocolate-covered blueberry?"

752
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,495
I said, "I think you're gonna like it."
And she's like, "Yeah, I'll try it."

753
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:35,039
And she loved it. She came back
into the kitchen an hour later.

754
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,639
She goes,
"Sissy, I feel so warm and fuzzy."

755
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,199
I go, "Isn't it great?"
And she goes, "My God, yes.

756
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,199
This is better than drinking.
This is just-I love everybody."

757
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,055
And I'm like, "I know.
Do you want another one?"

758
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,239
She said, "Can I?"
I go, "Oh, yeah."

759
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,360
And I put in my medical journal,
"She's taking two."

760
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,519
An hour later, she walked
into the living room from the kitchen

761
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,320
with a frozen ham
underneath her arm.

762
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,880
And I'm like, "What's that about?
You wanna cook a ham right now?"

763
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,159
She's like, "No, I opened the freezer
and this reminded me of Mom."

764
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,679
I was like,
"Sissy, let's go to bed."

765
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,199
So we went upstairs,
and we got into bed.

766
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,240
I took the frozen ham
and I threw it in the sauna.

767
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,080
I was like,
this will be ready at some point.

768
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,279
And we got into bed,
and we were just, like,

769
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,079
snuggling and cuddling
like sisters do,

770
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:31,719
and we were laughing
and it was so fun.

771
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,575
And it was like we were
like little girls.

772
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,840
And she was like,
"My God. This the best feeling."

773
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,000
"I can't believe we're in our 40s
and we still get to act like this.

774
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:42,000
How long are we gonna be
able to act like this?"

775
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,399
I'm like, "Sissy, we will always
be able to act like this."

776
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,559
Then I stuck my finger in her butt,
and she passed right out.

777
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:55,655
So I walked into Dan's office
after my family left, and I was like,

778
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,880
"Hey, Dan."
I go, "Cannabis has changed my life.

779
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,639
I'm meditating". I was meditating
every morning for 20 minutes.

780
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,519
I was going to the airport. I wasn't
even going to the Fox News lounge.

781
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,519
I wasn't yelling at people
who disagreed with me politically.

782
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,599
I was trying to have compassion
and empathy.

783
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,760
And I was being more patient,
and I was holding my tongue more.

784
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,000
And I said, "Cannabis is the way
to keep families together.

785
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,559
Like, this is the best family vacation
we've ever had.

786
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:20,800
Like, everyone got along.
It was fun."

787
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,679
And he said,
"Great. I'm in support of that."

788
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,880
And he handed me an orange,
very casually.

789
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,960
He said, "I picked this
off my tree this morning.

790
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:29,760
I thought you might like
an orange."

791
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,599
And I was revolted.
I was like, "Orange?"

792
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:38,400
First of all, he knows how I feel
about this color since the election.

793
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:48,239
And then I burst into tears,
and I was so embarrassed,

794
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,615
'cause he had not seen me cry
and I didn't want him to see me cry.

795
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,880
And I immediately put up the orange
in front of my eyes.

796
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,559
I was holding it, and then
I was stabbing it with my thumb,

797
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,960
so the citrus
was squirting into my eyes.

798
00:47:58,679 --> 00:47:59,800
I was like, "Shit."

799
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,679
And then I was really crying,
I was, like, convulsively crying.

800
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,239
And there was snot coming
out of everywhere.

801
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,599
And then at one point, somehow,
snot had alley-ooped up to my forehead

802
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:10,199
and then dropped back down
to my chin.

803
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,000
I looked like Brett Kavanaugh
during his senate confirmation hearing.

804
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,119
Like a big white male baby!

805
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,280
And finally, I dropped it.

806
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:29,519
And I looked at him,
and I knew I had no way out.

807
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,015
And I said, "I need to tell you
about the day my brother died

808
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:35,760
and what happened to my family."

809
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,800
And I told him about my brother,
that there were six of us,

810
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,000
and I was the youngest.

811
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:43,239
I was the baby,
and my brother Chet was the oldest.

812
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:46,360
He was the only family member
who understood that I was born

813
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,280
going through menopause,
that I was a sweaty baby,

814
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,800
and that I would have to retire
somewhere probably in the Arctic.

815
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,840
He was the only person in my family
who knew that when I ate soup,

816
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,400
I had to be topless, 'cause
I would immediately start sweating.

817
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,160
And when I was a little girl,
that was fine.

818
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,639
But when I was eight,

819
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:10,856
I remember we had this summer house
in Martha's Vineyard,

820
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,840
and my buds had come in.

821
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,360
They weren't really boobs yet,
but they were flappy titties,

822
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:19,079
where your nipple just goes
down before it's gonna burst.

823
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,360
And I remember hearing
my father say to my brother,

824
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,559
"You gotta cover her up
if you go into town now.

825
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,079
She can't be topless anymore."

826
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:29,159
'Cause I walked around topless
my entire childhood.

827
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:32,799
And I remember hearing that.
I'm like, "What's he talking about?"

828
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,800
My brother took me into town to go
to this place called the Quarterdeck,

829
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,360
where we would always
get fast food.

830
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,239
It wasn't fast food, but it was,
like, you know, a Vineyard place.

831
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,280
You get takeout fried clams,
a lobster roll or steamers...

832
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,679
And I remember that day.

833
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,456
I was sitting there,
and I was holding my brother's hand

834
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,135
at the takeout counter, and I was like,
"I'll have the clam chowder."

835
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,400
He's like, "Whoa..."

836
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,039
He goes;
"No let's not do soup today."

837
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,256
And I said, "What do you mean?
I want clam chowder."

838
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,840
He's like, "We can't have that today.
Like, we can take it to go,

839
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,280
but we can't sit out
and eat clam chowder.

840
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,480
We'll explain it
to you when we get home."

841
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,840
I was like, "But I really want it."
And he said, "Okay.

842
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,840
If you really want it, we can go in my
car and you can eat it in the car."

843
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,639
And I was like, "All right, whatever."
And I'll never forget that day.

844
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,880
I sat in my brother's car

845
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,639
eating my clam chowder
with my top off,

846
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,800
just sweating.

847
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,480
And my brother had his back
against the passenger's side window

848
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,880
to cover up the little eight-year-old
girl that was nude in his car.

849
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:41,280
Just like R. Kelly.

850
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,800
And we used to have
this game where we'd be,

851
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,615
he'd come home from work, and he'd
come running up to my parents' room,

852
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:55,679
and I was always hiding
under the covers in my mom's bed.

853
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,840
And he'd come up and go,
"Where is she?"

854
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:00,519
It'd be at 11:00 at night.
And I'd hide under the covers

855
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,960
and my mom would be like,
"She's not here."

856
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,721
I'd be like, "Shut up, Mom.
You're not even in this game."

857
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,719
And then he'd grab me
by the ankles under the covers,

858
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,920
throw me over his shoulders
and we'd run downstairs

859
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,840
and we'd go into the kitchen and
I'd make him a big bowl of Raisin Bran.

860
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,400
I knew the right ratio of Raisin Bran
to bananas to milk that he liked.

861
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,720
And I would make him his dinner

862
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,160
and then we'd sit there
like a couple and talk about our day.

863
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,936
And I remember him telling me he wasn't
coming to Martha's Vineyard that year

864
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,880
because he was going on a hiking trip
in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

865
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,120
And I was mad because
I would always drive up with him,

866
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:32,816
and he would leave the window
down the whole way

867
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,800
so I could have fresh air blowing
in my face and be topless.

868
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,639
He said, "Don't worry. I'll meet you
in two weeks on the Vineyard.

869
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:44,239
I will never,
ever leave you with these people."

870
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,079
And then he went
to Jackson Hole, Wyoming,

871
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,320
and fell off a cliff
and died three days later.

872
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,000
And Dan said,
"What... then what happened?"

873
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,679
And I said, "I just remember
going into the kitchen

874
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,000
and throwing away all the cereal.
Like, cereal was over.

875
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,280
It was a wrap on it.
Childhood was over.

876
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,159
Our family was over.
I haven't had cereal since that day."

877
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:21,999
And he said,
"What happened with your family?"

878
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,639
And I said, "It was awful."

879
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:27,679
My father was this big, strong man
who was in charge of everything

880
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,080
and didn't fuck around.
I'd never seen my father cry.

881
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,320
And I remember sitting shiva...
What Jews do when people die

882
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,599
with all these relatives and neighbors
and strangers coming to our house,

883
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:41,480
and my dad, who was so strong
and so in charge,

884
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:44,239
sitting on the couch
like a baby, crying.

885
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:46,880
And I was looking at him,
and I was so embarrassed.

886
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:49,800
I was like, "What are you doing?
What is happening,

887
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,599
he's dead, and you're gonna...
what are you doing?

888
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:56,800
Where the fuck are the adults?
I'm nine, what is happening?"

889
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,440
And I remember, I thought,
I gotta grow up.

890
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:06,320
This is it. It's over.

891
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:10,079
And at some point, we went back
to Martha's Vineyard,

892
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,800
to our summer house,
and my dad was sitting on the deck,

893
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,480
and we had a house
in front of the water.

894
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,639
And he was sitting on the deck,

895
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:19,280
and my parents' faces had changed
after my brother died.

896
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,719
They were just old,
all of the sudden.

897
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,440
And they were gray, and gray
in the face, and I wanted joy back.

898
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:27,280
I didn't know
what was happening.

899
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,960
I wanted to bring joy to them again.
I wanted them to laugh again.

900
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,400
I wanted... anything to happen.

901
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And I remember I walked outside
and I saw my father sitting there,

902
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,280
just holding his head.

903
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:40,599
And it was a beautiful
sunny day, and I said,

904
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,920
"Dad, can we please
just go in the water?"

905
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:46,920
I was like, "Please?" And he said,
"No one's going in the water.

906
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,480
My boy is dead."

907
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:54,480
And I walked off the deck,
and I thought, I'm gonna go in alone.

908
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,719
And the only rule
in my family growing up

909
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,639
was you could not swim
by yourself.

910
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,400
You could shoot heroin or hide a body,
but you could not swim alone.

911
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:06,760
"Jaws" was filmed
on Martha's Vineyard.

912
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,039
We were scared
of the mechanical shark.

913
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,639
But I didn't care, 'cause...
and I was so scared to defy my father.

914
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:16,000
My father would...
he would smack me.

915
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,880
I was scared of him,
especially in that state.

916
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:24,000
But I didn't care because my need
for joy was paramount to my fear.

917
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,159
And I walked off the deck, and I
remember walking down to the water,

918
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:29,920
and I just said, keep going.

919
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,760
I got in the water, and I swam out,
like, 20 yards and I turned around.

920
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,079
And he had gone inside.

921
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,119
And... Dan said,
"Sit with that feeling."

922
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,400
And I said,
"I can't. It's too painful."

923
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,760
He said, "Sit with it.
What do you feel right now?"

924
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,079
I'm like, "I'm so angry."

925
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,199
And he said, "Yes, but what's
underneath the anger?"

926
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,119
And I'm like,
"Hurt. I'm fucking hurt.

927
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,719
I'm hurt that my brother
went off and ditched me

928
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,256
when he told me
he was gonna come back.

929
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,679
And then my father ditched me."

930
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,360
And he said,
"Yes, what's underneath the hurt?"

931
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,400
I'm like, "I'm paying you to tell me
what's underneath the hurt."

932
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:12,679
He said, "Rejection.

933
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,840
You took that as rejection, because
that's what a nine-year-old girl thinks.

934
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,615
It doesn't matter that your brother
had a hiking accident.

935
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,256
It matters that he told you he was
coming back and he didn't come back,

936
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,719
so for a nine-year-old little girl,
he rejected you.

937
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,280
And then your father rejected you,
so you were broken up with twice.

938
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:33,679
This is why, when I handed you
an orange, you were revolted,

939
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:38,280
because it requires you to be vulnerable
with a man, and you don't trust men,

940
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,119
because the two men
you trusted the most lied."

941
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:48,679
He said, "This is where your lack
of empathy comes in."

942
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:51,360
How are you meant to have empathy
for anyone

943
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,320
when you've never
even grieved yourself?

944
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,400
You've never allowed yourself
to because you had to be strong."

945
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,280
And I'm looking at him,
hearing these things, and I'm like..."

946
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,800
My God, I wanna fuck you, too."

947
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:14,360
He's like, "You don't wanna fuck me."
I'm like, "I do in this moment."

948
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:18,679
He's like, "No, you want
someone to take care of you.

949
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,159
That's why you hire guides
and why you hook up with guides,

950
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:24,480
'cause you're paying them
to take care of you."

951
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,135
"And you're also paying them,
technically, to have sex with you."

952
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:31,439
I'm like, "Dan, that's too far."

953
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:36,280
I didn't know that my brother's
death was defining me.

954
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,400
I didn't know that I had the ability
to say no to being defined by death.

955
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:46,719
Now I was with a person who could
help me process what happened

956
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,800
and turn the parts of me that still
acted like a nine-year-old little girl

957
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,800
into a self-actualized adult

958
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,400
who had come
to a better understanding

959
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,000
of what it means to dig deep
and admit that you're in pain,

960
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,840
thereby relinquishing that pain
or beginning to relinquish that pain.

961
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,719
My brother dying no longer
had to define my existence.

962
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,719
It's part of who I am, perhaps the
biggest part, but it's not all of me.

963
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:17,039
I define me. I decide who I am.
No event or person does this.

964
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,039
I decide how I'm going to behave
and I know now

965
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,440
that vulnerability is not weakness,
that vulnerability is strength.

966
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:35,480
So I was excited. I went home.
I was packing my bags.

967
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:38,960
I was leaving for Clearwater, Florida,
to visit the Scientologists...

968
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:43,000
to try and knock some sense
into them.

969
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,320
And I got on my plane,
and I was feeling so good.

970
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:49,559
I had the information that I needed
to understand why I reacted...

971
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:52,400
I wasn't mad at Donald Trump.
Of course I hate Donald Trump,

972
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,239
but that was representative of the
other time my life became unhinged.

973
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,400
It was a trigger,
a word I never thought I would use.

974
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,960
But it made sense. And I was
putting all these pieces together,

975
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:03,199
and I was so grateful.

976
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,400
I was sitting on the plane, and I saw
this large man walking towards me.

977
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,400
And I was like,
I hope he doesn't sit next to me.

978
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,480
I could tell by his body type
that he was a Trump supporter.

979
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:18,719
He looked like a swollen tick.

980
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,119
And he had these denim pants.

981
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:26,519
They weren't pants,
they weren't denim.

982
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:28,440
They looked denim,
but they were cloth.

983
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:34,000
And I was like... that is tricky.
I don't like that, and then I was, no.

984
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,320
You don't judge people based
on their denim-looking pants.

985
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,559
This person is a man
with a family.

986
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:44,800
Stop looking at the exterior and start
thinking about the interior of people.

987
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,400
That's what Dan taught me. I was
like, this is a man with a family.

988
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,079
I immediately closed my eyes.
Like, this is an opportunity.

989
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:53,695
This is an opportunity to talk to
somebody who voted for Donald Trump

990
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:57,519
and actually be kind and generous
and understand or try to understand

991
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,639
why they would do
something like that.

992
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:02,559
So I closed my eyes,
and I'm doing my breathing,

993
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,159
I'm like, okay, opportunity...

994
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:06,199
I'm like, think about his family;
He's got a wife.

995
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:08,456
I'm like, well, she probably hates
him too. I'm like, no.

996
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,880
I'm like, no, Chelsea.
Wives love husbands usually.

997
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,641
I mean, just... no, he has children.
He's someone's father.

998
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,320
And I'm like,
they fuckin' hate him too.

999
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,039
If they saw him in these shorts,
they'd fuckin' be pissed too.

1000
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,119
And I was like, no, no, no.
Then I was like, okay, I can do this.

1001
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:25,960
I ordered a bowl of cereal
for my first time in 30 years.

1002
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:29,159
I'm gonna have a bowl of cereal
with a side of Republican.

1003
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,920
And I took my first bite of cereal,
that's when I smelled my first fart.

1004
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,159
There were eight.

1005
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,760
I know this because I counted,
because they were like tsunamis.

1006
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,360
You thought one was over, and then
it was done, a tsunami happens,

1007
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,000
and the water recedes,
and people come down from the trees,

1008
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,336
and they're like,
"Okay, it's gone."

1009
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,960
And then, fuck, another wave is coming.
That's what that was like.

1010
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,000
So the first one, I was like, whoa...
Is that me? Did I fart?

1011
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,599
And then there was the second one,
I'm like, he's farting on me.

1012
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,199
This Trump supporter
is really checking me right now.

1013
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,280
This is really testing me.

1014
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:09,159
And then I'm thinking, like,
my God, he needs a panty shield.

1015
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,519
Like, he needs something.
He definitely needs a doxycycline.

1016
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:14,480
So I went in my bag,
and I got some out.

1017
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,920
I took one, I put one on his plate,
but I closed my eyes.

1018
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,199
And I was like, just breathe.
You can deal with this too.

1019
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,520
This is just another challenge.

1020
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,880
And then I realized I was sucking
the air from his asshole into my nose.

1021
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,159
And I was like, no...

1022
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,880
Remembered the Lamaze
from my fake daughter, and I was like...

1023
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,880
and I kept my eyes shut.
I obviously lost my appetite.

1024
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,199
I didn't eat anything else.

1025
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:41,879
And when the flight attendant
came over to clear my tray,

1026
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,559
I didn't even look up. I just sat there
trying to get myself together.

1027
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,920
And then finally,
he got up to go to the bathroom.

1028
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,055
And when he did, she came back over,
and she said, "Are you okay?"

1029
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:52,400
And I'm like, "Are you?"

1030
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,600
And then I turned around
to look at the other hostages...

1031
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,400
I was like, "People are going
to pass away on this flight."

1032
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,199
She said, "Hopefully he's just in the
bathroom now getting rid of it."

1033
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,400
I said, "What? You can't say that."
I was like, "Getting rid of it?

1034
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,599
You need to call ahead
to the airport...

1035
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:20,800
Do you have a hospital there?
He's gonna need a colonoscopy.

1036
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,000
You need to see if there's a doctor
or a vet on board, okay?

1037
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,920
He went to Chipotle,
and things took a hard left turn."

1038
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,880
And he comes out of the bathroom,
and she scuttles away,

1039
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,639
and I'm like, God,
I'm like, okay...

1040
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:43,480
You have to think of the most loving
way to tell someone to stop farting.

1041
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,199
So he comes walking over,
and he sits down and it's loud and...

1042
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,039
I said, "Sir, will you please
stop what you're doing?"

1043
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,281
And he said, "Excuse me?"
I go, "Stop it with your butt."

1044
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,456
Then I covered my eyes and I sat
like this for the rest of the flight,

1045
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,159
rocking myself like a baby.

1046
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,000
"Don't say anything else, don't
be a cunt, don't start a confrontation."

1047
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:15,320
You've farted too.
You've farted too, okay.

1048
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,840
You've had bad situations.
Remember Panda Express?

1049
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,000
Don't judge him...

1050
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:24,400
And I was so excited.
We were descending.

1051
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,440
I was like, you did it,
you didn't do anything.

1052
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:28,760
If that had just been
six months ago-six months

1053
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,079
before I had gone to therapy,
just six months...

1054
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,920
He would have gone to the bathroom.
I would've formed a gang.

1055
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:43,280
I would be the leader of the gang.
I would've lurched at him like this,

1056
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,440
grabbed him by the neck,
pinned him down on the floor,

1057
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:47,776
'cause I have strength like that,

1058
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,559
and flipped him over like a baby
and stapled his asshole shut.

1059
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:57,760
But I didn't do that
because I'm growing.

1060
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,000
And they're called baby steps.

1061
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,679
So as we were leaving the plane,
the plane had landed,

1062
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,920
he gathered his stuff,
I didn't make eye contact.

1063
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,239
We never had the relationship
I thought we could have

1064
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,440
because he ruined it
with his asshole.

1065
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:15,599
And the flight attendant
came over as I was leaving,

1066
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:17,495
and she's like, "It was a pleasure
having you on board."

1067
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:19,280
I was like, "Yeah, thank you."

1068
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:21,239
I was like,
"The pleasure was all yours."

1069
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,495
And she said,
"Can I ask you something?"

1070
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:26,000
And I was like,
"Yeah, of course."

1071
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,039
And she said, "I heard
a funny story about you once."

1072
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,519
I was like, "Really?"

1073
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,400
I go, "Which one?"

1074
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:37,679
"I heard you were so high once you
tried to get off a plane mid-flight."

1075
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,800
I said, "I've heard that story too."
I said, "That was Elizabeth Banks."

1076
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:55,239
Thank you, guys! Does anybody
want some complementary oranges?

1077
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,800
There you go.

1078
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,119
Thank you, New Jersey.
It's good to be home.

1079
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:08,159
Yeah! Thank you, guys!
I love you guys. Thank you.

1080
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,880
