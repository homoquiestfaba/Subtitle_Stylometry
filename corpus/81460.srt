00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,998
<i>Okay, this is a good Cosmo quiz.</i>

2
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,699
''You're walking
to your lover's house.

3
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,971
Do you take the long road
full of scenic views...

4
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,070
or the short one
that gets you there fast?''

5
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,741
lt totally depends
on what l'm wearing.

6
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,214
- The short road.
- Okay.

7
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,585
''You come upon a bed of white
and red roses, and you pick 20.

8
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,423
How many white and how many red?''

9
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,120
All red.

10
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,973
Sissy, you have to talk to Manny.

11
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,270
He's not gonna kick you out.
He's just pulling that landlord trip.

12
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,368
Besides, you're gonna pay him
half the money tonight anyway.

13
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,680
Don't worry about it.
You can always stay at my place.

14
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,752
Okay. l'll see you later.

15
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,689
You can keep the change.

16
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,628
l've got a couple of things to do,
but l'll be home later tonight, okay?

17
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,534
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

Fingers and hands inside.

The seventh floor, please?

22
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,749
Fifty-two years,
and I have yet...

23
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,085
to guess the desired floor.

24
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,498
Fifty-two years--

25
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,668
You gettin'...

26
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,504

27
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,110
No, not today.

28
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,006
You here to see...

29
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,742
Jesus?

30
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,726
This is close as we get
to this floor.

31
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,632
Dearly beloved, we have come together
in the presence of God to witness...

32
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,609
and bless the joining together
of this man and woman in holy matrimony.

33
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,612
What's that smell?

34
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,080
- lnto this holy union...
- Pee.

35
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,983

hallelujah.

37
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,024
Which one's 7-B?

38
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,619
See those brown ones
on the left?

39
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,132
Yeah.

40
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,169
lt's one of those.

41

This one?

42
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,246
What's it look like?

43
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,222
What?

44
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,622
Describe the door.

45
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,463
Look, it's a brown door.
They all look alike.

46
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,566
It's the next one down.

47
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,017
Hello?

48
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,038

Fine. Just a minute.

54
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,421
You know, this hotel
is full of freaks.

55
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:42,667
You look pretty normal
for a place like this though.

56
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,225
Hello.

57
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,226
This is my brother, Blake.

58

Hello.

59
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,126
Would you like a cup of water?

60
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,469
Sure.

61
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,953
Make your wish.

62
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,962

<i>- Hello?

l went to Sissy's.
She's not there.

71
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,545
Fuck.

72
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,145
Then l'm homeless.

73
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:40,091
You're a lawyer. Can't you send
a letter or something?

74
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,360
Okay, good, good.
Call me back.

00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,193
Thanks.

79
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,661
Would you like
another piece of cake?

80
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,710
Do you mind if l wait
for my call?

81
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,939
We don't mind.

82
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,128
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?

83
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,515

There you go.

How are you feeling?

88
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,653
l brought a friend
to check you both out.

89
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,122
Don't worry.
Miles is a friend.

90
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,126
He's a doctor.
He's outside in the hall.

91
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,696
Look, l won't bring him in
if you don't want me to.

92
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,463
The doctor can examine you both,
find out what's wrong.

93
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,301
Maybe get you guys
some medicine.

94
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,600
Look, he won't tell anyone
about you both.

95
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:50,546
Trust me. His wife would not want
a call from a patient like me.

96
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,585
Okay?

97
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,423
Come on.
What do you say?

98
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,560
Yeah? Okay. Good.

99
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,294
Can you get both of you
over to the bed?

100
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,533
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

101
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,663
l'm gonna go get him, all right?
Okay.

102
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,379
What are you doing
in a place like this?

103
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,754
l thought you had given up
on this...

104
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,461
get-rich-quick profession.

105
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,464
- Well, it's funny. l ain't rich yet.
- Well...

106
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:45,094
as long as you don't start
to smoke the pipe.

107
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,264
Yeah. Me, the crack whore.

108
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:52,242
A penny for your thoughts.
You all right?

109
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,937
l'm fine.

110
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,751
lf you ever want to find out
how he's doing...

111
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,112
or some information--

112
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,488
l don't need a reminder, Miles.

113
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,758
Come on.

114
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,575
Hello, boys.
l'm Miles...

115
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:32,508
Penny's doctor,
when she feels like it.

116
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,216
Relax.

117
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,224
l'm no surgeon.

118
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,160
You're both visiting from Siam?

119
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,600
No, sir.

120
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,675
l didn't think so.

121
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:03,511
Penny calls me saying she wants me
to examine some sick Siamese.

122
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,458
ln Siam...

123
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,461
all they would do is...

124
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,964
examine your hands...

125
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,000
to determine your...

126
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,535
illness.

127
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,241
But since we're in America...

128
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,414
l have to question your heart.

129
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:48,124
l need your help
to lift up your shirt.

130
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:24,293
l want you to take a deep breath,
using your mouth.

131
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,058
Hold it.

132
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,318
Have you been eating anything
apart from the birthday cake?

133
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,062
Some cotton candy, yesterday.

134
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,765
Penny's quite the gift, huh?

135
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:16,379
Hey, Captain,
who's steering the ship?

136
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,548
lf you can...

137
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,114
l want you to hold your breath...

138
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,419
and exhale slowly.

139
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,107
Well...

140
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,319
Penny knows my phone number...

141
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,587
if both of you
want to see me again.

142
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,266
We thank you, Doctor.

143
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,378
Wow!

144
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,180
Conjoined twins.

145
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,622
Aren't you getting
a bit fancy these days?

146
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,091
You examined them, right?

147
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,129
You want to know how many--

148
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,960
Come on, Miles.
Are they gonna be okay?

149
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,965
The one on the left, Francis...

150
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,234
has a case of the flu,
which is causing...

151
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,104
nausea and vomiting.

152
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,109
lt's a little unusual--

153
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,078
one having the flu...

154
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,082
and the other exhibits no symptoms.

155
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,618
l'm positive they share
the same blood.

156
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,451
lf his condition deteriorates...

157
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,529
bring them to the clinic,
will you?

158
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:21,195
This should ease the nausea
and migraine for a couple of days.

159
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,708
Get it as soon as you can.

160
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,515
You all right?

161
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,618
<i>Yeah, l'm all right.</i>

162
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,315
Ah, Miss lndependence.

163
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,984
You see two people depend
on each other for survival...

164
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,995
it makes you feel
kind of queasy, huh?

165
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,000
Quite a marriage.

166
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,332
What, are you my shrink now? Can't you
just send the prescription over here?

167
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,973
Why not?

168
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,302
Why didn't you calI
an ambulance?

169
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,346
Get them some proper food.

170
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,218
What do they eat?

171
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,391
Food, l assume.

172
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,330
Thanks, Miles.

173
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,012
<i>My wallet's in my jacket.</i>

174
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,080
l wasn't stealing.

175
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,457
l was just looking for money
for your medicine.

176
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,723
My jacket's on the chair.

177
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,070
l took 20, okay?

178
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:42,096
Look, l got the medicine
for Francis.

179
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,607
Here. Drink some water.

180
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,986
Thank you.

181
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,495
Are you hungry?

182
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,569
l bought you some food.

183
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,470
l bought you
some barbecue chips...

184
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:38,280
and some soda which is supposed to
be really good for an upset stomach.

185
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,948
l didn't really know
what you guys ate.

186
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,595
ls he gonna be okay?

187
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,371
Francis doesn't take
to traveling much anymore.

188
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,238
Why are you two here?

189
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,746
We came here to visit a relative.

190
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,192
But how come you
don't get sick?

191
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,636
Who'd take care of Francis?

192
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,169
Here.

193
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,213
Let me.

194
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,417
There you go.

195
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,526
Here.

196
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,663
Thank you.

197
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,738
Here.

198
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:12,012
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, still there?</i>

199
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,115
<i>- Jay?
- l have a job for you.</i>

200
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,193
<i>- Now?
- Yes, now. Right now.</i>

201
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,194
<i>- But who?
- Same price, people and circumstances.</i>

202
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,457
You know, Jay, l'm getting tired
of this cheap companion.

203
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,556
<i>What are you talking about?
Hold on a second.</i>

204
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,300
Okay, okay, okay.

205
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:38,466
We really need to sit down
and reorganize my life.

206
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,511
This alternative route to stardom
is such a dead end.

207
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,547
<i>How about breakfast
tomorrow morning?</i>

208
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,549
<i>- Okay.
- All right?</i>

209
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,719
l got my calling.

210
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,604
Thank you for watching over us.

211
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,475
lt's the least l could do.

212
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,140
l need something
to level my karma...

213
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,649
which right now
is completely unbalanced.

214
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,616
l'm sorry about how l reacted
last night.

215
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,762
That's okay.

216
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,965
lf you didn't buy a ticket,
we usually send you screaming.

217
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,339
Maybe l'll see you two around.

218
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:55,480
Maybe l'll call you...

219
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,987
when l'm single.

220
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,251
<i>Hello?</i>

221
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,634
<i>And three legs. Three.</i>

222
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,104
<i>lt was weird.</i>

223
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,265
<i>And one of them was sick.</i>

224
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,741
<i>But Miles didn't tell me
anything about it.</i>

225
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,150
<i>Blake. Blake talked to me.</i>

226
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:40,087
<i>It seems he takes care
of the other one, Francis.</i>

227
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,689
<i>So how many arms do they have?</i>

228
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:49,495
<i>They have two.
They had a right and a left.</i>

229
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,693
<i>l mean, they had one each.</i>

230
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:57,297
<i>And then Blake, he took
the medicine for Francis...</i>

231
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,706
<i>'cause Francis
didn't want to take it.</i>

232
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,703
<i>lt seems that Blake has no choice
but to take care of him.</i>

233
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,078
<i>So did they have two--</i>

234
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:13,089
<i>l don't know.
l didn't see anything.</i>

235
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,459
<i>Well, then, how many feet?</i>

236
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:22,659
<i>Two. No. No, no, no.
They had three.</i>

237
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,600
<i>And they shared the middle one.</i>

238
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,763
But it looked okay.

239
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,372
lt looked okay?

240
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:35,037
Need anything else, dear?
Another slice of pumpkin pie?

241
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,046
No, thanks, Dottie.

242
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,444
So, yeah...

243
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:44,419
they weren't ugly though.

244
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,457
l mean, they didn't look ugly.

245
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,083
l don't know.

246
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,392
lt was like they were
just any two...

247
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,090
brothers.

248
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,261
Could you imagine
being their mother?

249
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,168
Trick or treat.

250
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,069
Trick or treat.

251
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:26,430
Just a moment. l need to get
some candy for you boys.

252
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,077
Well--

253
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,343
let's see what we have here.

254
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:53,249
You two boys have made
a really great costume.

255
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,518
lt kind of frightened me.

256
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:59,960
l thought you two were real.

257
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,999
Well, you look real too.

258
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,532
Real?

259
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:13,141
Like our mother.

260
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,745
l'm sorry.

261
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,729
- How much did you get?
- l don't know. How about you?

262
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,330
l got some warheads.
Hey, wait up.

263
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,295
<i>They're in my section.</i>

264
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,966
They're two twins, and they're
the best costume l've ever seen.

265
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,408
l've worked here for 20 years,
and l've never seen anything like this.

266
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:52,415
lt is so real.
Now, you gotta go and check them out.

267
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:57,750
They're dressed like Siamese twins.
l-- They've really got it down.

268
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,752
- Which table?
- Two.

269
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,369
Blake and Francis.

270
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,603
- What are you guys doing?
- Trick or treating.

271
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,678
Where?

272
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,676
- Main Street.
- Near Second.

273
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,345
That's cool.

274
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,752
Have a seat and some candy.

275
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,292
Nobody knows.

276
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:46,994
Except that woman over there.
She keeps staring at us.

277
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,040
Did your mother have to put up with
shit like that when you were kids?

278
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,477
- We don't have a mother.
- You have a mother.

279
00:36:56,581 --> 00:37:01,018
Well, what he's trying to say is
we don't have a human mother.

280
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,381
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

281
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,655
What do you mean?
Then how were you born?

282
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,757
Promise you won't flip out?

283
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,434
- l promise.
- Okay.

284
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,563
Right before we were born--

285
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,573
We grew too big
for our mother's stomach.

286
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:30,474
So they put us inside a cow.

287
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,981
A cow? No way!

288
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:37,316
- Do you want to hear this or not?
- Okay.

289
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,588
l'm sorry.

290
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,499
For a month and a half...

291
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,569
we were inside
the cow's stomach.

292
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,571
And the cow delivered you?

293
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,310
Well, they let the cow out
to graze.

294
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:05,041
And one morning, they saw us
running around in the pasture.

295
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,617
l don't believe you.
Come on.

296
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,686
Okay.

297
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,722
Francis, say ''mom.''

298
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,224
Mom!

299
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,626
Hey, you guys wanna go
to a party?

300
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,032
lt's a photographer l know.
lt's supposed to be huge.

301
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,197
Come on.

302
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,502
You can't let that vintage look
go back in the closet.

303
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:36,137
Who knows when chocolate brown
will be back in style?

304
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,441
- Do you really want to go?
- Sure.

305
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,548
- We'll go.
- We'll go.

306
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,088
Good, then l have a date.

307
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:49,285
Actually we can walk.
lt's just by Third Street. Okay?

308
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,758
Okay.

309
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,668
Wow, it looks great, Tre.

310
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,173
Oh, thank you so much for coming.
l'm so glad. You look great.

311
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,300
Look at you.

312
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,642
Well, hi. Don't be rude.
Who are your friends?

313
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:47,684
Uh, l'm sorry.
Blake, Francis, this is Tre.

314
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,685
Oh, my!

315
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,655
How tragic is this?

316
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,420
l love it!

317
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:00,089
Are they both straight?
You know my mind just wanders.

318
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:05,396
Wouldn't it be tragic if one of them
fancied boys and the other fancied--

319
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,666
Oh, my God, l can't bear
the thought. The horror.

320
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,537
You know what? We're gonna
go get a drink. We'll see you later.

321
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,509
<i>Oh, okay, have fun.
l'll catch up with you later.</i>

322
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,180
Don't worry. Tre has no idea.
Are you both okay?

323
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,582
- Yeah.
- Fine.

324
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,482
- You?
- Yeah, fine.

325
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,589
What do you both
want to drink?

326
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,683
- Nothing.
- A beer.

327
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,285
Okay, l'll be right back.

328
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,588
I need another.

329
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,636
- What?
- They're here. Those Siamese twins.

330
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,139
- Shh.
- Things.

331
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:36,287
l may be really fucked up...

332
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,260
but are you two, like, brothers?

333
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,697
l'm sorry. You were whispering.
l couldn't hear you.

334
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,966
Yes, we are brothers.

335
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,040
Twins, then?

336
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,341
Yes.

337
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,383
Wonderful!

338
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,942
Who's older?

339
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,146
Caesarian.

340
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,989
That's the Greek method?

341
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,963
Well, then, who came out first?

342
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:20,966
Caesarian. We were both born
at the same time.

343
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,042
How fucking amazing is that?

344
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,579
There's another couple here...

345
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,310
and they're dressed like Siamese...

346
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:37,649
but they don't look
anything like you two.

347
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,247
Look, they're over there.

348
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,051
- What?
- Now, l trust you, Sissy.

349
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:11,087
You're not gonna tell anybody
that they're real, are you?

350
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,581
Come on, Sissy. Promise me.

351
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,295
Sissy, show some compassion.

352
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,355
lt is the one night the entire year
that they are normal.

353
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:26,459
One night of the whole entire year.
Don't ruin it.

354
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,464
Okay, okay, l promise.

355
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,633
Thank you.

356
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:46,279
What's the matter?
ls somebody bothering you?

357
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,291
Here, Francis.

358
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,951
Thanks.

359
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:57,964
Francis, would you like to dance?

360
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,663
Sure.

361
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:04,230
Blake, would you like to dance?

362
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,339
Sure.

363
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,949
Penny, you've got to be
shitting me.

364
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,723
Sissy just told me your two friends
aren't in a costume.

365
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,261
You've got to let me
photograph them.

366
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:40,700
- A photo of those two in Prada.
- No, Tre!

367
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:45,241
Okay, no fashion.
How about a super tasteful nude?

368
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,709
Just think about it. lt's all about
their plumbing anyway, right?

369
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,379
No, they're not freaks,
and l'm leaving, okay?

370
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:55,179
Wait! What, you think l can't
sympathize with them?

371
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:58,721
l'm a weeping freak. l've got women
inside me screaming to get out.

372
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,457
- l gotta go.
- Let me--

373
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,458
Fine. Bye-bye.

374
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,198
This is it.

375
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,335
You like my place?

376
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,968
lt's Christmas every day.

377
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,575
Relax, it's okay.

378
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,354
ls that you?

379
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,951
You think it looks like me?

380
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,691
Well, it's a little hard to tell.

381
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,168
You have a lot of makeup on.

382
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,967
You don't like it?

383
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:53,440
No. lt's just that
clowns wear a lot of makeup.

384
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,039
My mother mailed it to me.

385
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:03,052
She was really happy
to see me in a magazine.

386
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,080
But you know what?

387
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,523
l don't think that model
looks like me.

388
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:18,197
Anyway, that heavy makeup thing is so
last season. l'd never do that now.

389
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:52,462
<i>Traveling so long</i>

390
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,334
<i>Without you</i>

391
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,341
<i>Really don't know</i>

392
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,469
<i>Much about you</i>

393
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:09,018
<i>I just wish</i>

394
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,950
<i>The night</i>

395
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,954
<i>Away</i>

396
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:17,721
<i>On a vision</i>

397
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:21,260
<i>Holiday</i>

398
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,662
<i>Living my life</i>

399
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,434
<i>Around you</i>

400
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,511
<i>Really don't know</i>

401
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:39,673
<i>Much about you</i>

402
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,042
Oh, wow.

403
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,055
That was so cool.

404
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,260
You guys should go play
in a bar or something.

405
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,591
l mean, l would pay money
to go see you guys.

406
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,633
l've always wanted
to play the guitar.

407
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,759
Blake-- he's always
looking for a singer.

408
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,198
Aren't you, Blake?
Aren't you?

409
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,331
What, to start a band?

410
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,569
Someone to sing duets with.

411
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,045
l can sing.

412
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:17,015
Do you know any, um, duets?

413
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,451
Yeah. ''lslands in the Stream.''

414
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,288
l don't know that one.

415
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,294
Try ''Jackson.''

416
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:30,662
Do you know any country tunes,
like ''Jackson'' by Johnny Cash?

417
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,130
No, l don't know that one.

418
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,937
lt's pretty easy. lf you sit down,
l can teach it to you.

419
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,376
- Really?
- Yeah.

420
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,246
Okay, wait. First, l'm gonna
change into my western outfit.

421
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,342
lt's gonna be really cool, okay?

422
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,504
''Jackson''?

423
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,640
Shut up.

424
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,473
You don't even sing
that song with me.

425
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,478
Do you know an easier song?

426
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,484
''l'm in Love.''

427
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,255
By who?

428
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:29,554
You-- Blake Falls.

429
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,305
Here.

430
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,397
l can't play it
and press the chords...

431
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,408
so l'll show you
where you put your fingers.

432
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,410
Okay. Here.

433
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,980
You want me to use--

434
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,983
- Put one finger here.
- There?

435
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,486
- Yeah. There and there.
- And there.

436
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,385
- Okay?
- Yeah.

437
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:04,188
- Wait. There.
- There.

438
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,989
There.

439
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,291
Here's the poster
of your new band.

440
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,331
This is you...

441
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,996
and this is you, Penny.

442
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,977
ls my butt that big?

443
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,177
No, you've got a nice back yard.

444
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:32,983
lt's just that
this drawing's a bit abstract.

445
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,682
Abstract?

446
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,688
- lt's what l see.
- No, it's not what he sees.

447
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:45,200
lt's what he sees and interprets
and then expresses in a drawing.

448
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:50,104
So, you look at my ass
and then draw a big one?

449
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:56,611
He sees your--
He likes your butt...

450
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,738
and draws a big one.

451
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:03,213
So everyone who sees your butt
in this drawing...

452
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,722
and then sees your butt
in real life...

453
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,759
they, um, say...

454
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:13,962
''Well, Penny's got a pretty
nice butt in real life.''

455
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,461
Good one, Blake.

456
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,202
So, Francis...

457
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,171
where are you in the drawing?

458
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:29,076
There's not enough room
in this picture.

459
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,741
Are you guys tired?

460
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,146
Do you want some coffee?

461
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,223
No, thank you.

462
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,585
Are you tired?
Do you want to go? Okay.

463
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:49,256
- You're welcome to stay here.
- That's your choice.

464
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,391
l mean, l stayed at your place.

465
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,527
Plus, you don't want to go
back to that hole anyway.

466
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:55,627
Okay, fine.

467
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,469
l'll get
the marshmallows out, okay?

468
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,543
Who is it?

469
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,617
What is up with the outfit?

470
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:14,289
They're in there, huh?

471
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:19,394
What are you gonna do with them?

472
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,226
Nothing.

473
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,358
Holy shit. Are you--
Are you gonna get--

474
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,628
Am l gonna what?

475
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:31,537
- No way. Penny, you--
- What? They're just two brothers.

476
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,542
<i>They got three legs. They got two arms.
What's the big deal, Sissy?</i>

477
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,544
Oh, and how many--

478
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,944
That l'll have the answer to
in the morning.

479
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,416
Really?

480
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,289
l'll see you in the morning.

481
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,721
Are you fucking with me?

482
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:53,019
You know, maybe we can all
get married in Utah.

483
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:57,190
They accept that kind
of relationship there, right?

484
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:01,327
Wait. ls it only
two girls and a guy?

485
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,065
l don't know.
See you tomorrow.

486
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:27,253
<i>lf you ever want to find out
how he's doing...</i>

487
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,662
<i>or some information--</i>

488
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,640
<i>''Bruise.''</i>

489
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,044
lt's the new color
by Urban Decay.

490
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:47,173
- Can l try it on you?
- Sure.

491
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,615
Yeah? Okay.

492
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,132
Which piggy's that?

493
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,167
That's mine.

494
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,237
l control...

495
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:12,001
the right foot
and this right leg.

496
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,474
And the middle foot...

497
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:17,011
and, um...

498
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,075
this foot here.

499
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,708
Which one?

500
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,420
This one.

501
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:39,001
That toe and that toe
l have a little control of.

502
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,738
l guess we'll start here, then.

503
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,969
Do you ever get lonely?

504
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,967
When?

505
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:23,974
Well, l was thinking,
you were born with somebody...

506
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,741
at your side.

507
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,381
So l was wondering
if you ever got lonely.

508
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:35,219
You don't have to answer me
if you don't want to.

509
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,952
No, that's okay.

510
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,427
l just never get
a question like that.

511
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:44,593
lt's usually if Francis and l
share the same dick.

512
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,107
The minute l wake up...

513
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,505
and the minute l fall asleep.

514
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:02,080
Two minutes of every day
l feel lonely.

515
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,019
l try to grab those two minutes.

516
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:10,559
and toss 'em
before they get ahold of me.

517
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,256
Two minutes isn't that long.

518
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,624
Long enough...

519
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,403
to remind me.

520
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,632
Of what?

521
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,175
Of who I am.

522
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:30,738
Of who we are.

523
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,678
What are you doing?

524
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,217
Your nail polish is wet.
l'm blowing on it.

525
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,960
Can Francis feel that?

526
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:07,582
Can he feel this?

527
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,487
Close your eyes.

528
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,471
No, l don't think so.

529
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,201
Okay. Good.

530
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,939
Good morning.

531
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,947
l'm going to meet my lawyer
for breakfast.

532
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,978
l should be back around noon.

533
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,986
Are you two gonna be okay here?

534
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,425
We'll be fine.

535
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,002
What's it like
being with someone all the time?

536
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,564
l don't know any different.

537
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,608
l've nothing to compare it to.

538
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,018
Do you ever think about separation?

539
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,748
Blake always says...

540
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:32,155
''We checked in together...

541
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,422
we'll check out together.''

542
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:41,334
Blake could live a normal life
when l go.

543
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,101
He has a very strong heart.

544
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:54,977
He's the reason why my blood pumps
and my heart beats.

545
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,513
l'm alive because of Blake.

546
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:04,458
ls there a sad ending?

547
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:12,024
ln time...

548
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:16,331
every sad ending
will become happy.

549
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:19,671
The sad ending is only because...

550
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:22,176
the author stops telling the story.

551
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,745
But it still goes on...

552
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,748
it's just untold.

553
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:55,603
''lf you picked the short road,
you fall in love quickly.

554
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,512
The long road,
you take your time falling in love.''

555
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:02,575
So you fall in love faster.

556
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,586
Answer number two.

557
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,420
''The number of red roses you choose...

558
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:12,120
is how much you would give
in a relationship.

559
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,595
The white roses tell you how much
you want out of a relationship.''

560
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,760
l chose all red.

561
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:26,197
lt's okay.
l think it's just Penny.

562
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,057
Fuck me.

563
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,726
Penny said you two were close,
but--

564
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,360
Jesus Christ.

565
01:02:57,173 --> 01:03:00,006
Real genuine Siamese.

566
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,543
Sit down.

567
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,714
You're Blake, right?

568
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,584
No? Oh, Francis.
You're Francis, you're Blake.

569
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,243
Okay.

570
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,584
Penny told me about you guys
at breakfast.

571
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,590
lsn't one of you sick?

572
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,156
But you play the guitar,
though, right?

573
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,164
- Yeah.
- Hey, see? l know.

574
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:28,470
Oh, wait.

575
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,507
Forgive me.
I forgot myself.

576
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,576
l'm Jay Harrison and Associates.

577
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,441
l'm what you call...

578
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:41,574
a legal associate in the entertainment
field, but don't let that throw you.

579
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:45,586
There's no such thing as laws to enforce
in the entertainment field.

580
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,519
No, please, wait.

581
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:49,454
Give me a second, please.

582
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:54,121
Before you guys come to any conclusions,
can l have your attention for a minute?

583
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:58,462
Let me just take you through
a little scenario, okay?

584
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,435
All right? Okay.

585
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:04,995
What things are
are not always what they seem...

586
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,235
and what things seem
are not always what they are.

587
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:11,404
Right now, to me,
you both seem okay...

588
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,210
with who you are...

589
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,717
and that's not okay.

590
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,747
What we need to do...

591
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,957
is create a drama,
an illusion.

592
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,223
lt's like a yin and yang thing.
lt's like a give and take, you know?

593
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:29,025
You give a little show,
you take a little dough.

594
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,031
See?

595
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:33,033
Two brothers...

596
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,000
conjoined at birth...

597
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,301
who can no longer
live with each other anymore.

598
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:40,700
How epic is that?

599
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,605
<i>lt's profound.</i>

600
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,614
We leak this into the tabloid--

601
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,980
Hello? Excuse me...

602
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:55,046
but the world's greatest
show on earth has just begun.

603
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:56,591
Think about it.

604
01:04:56,692 --> 01:05:01,527
This is capable of being the most
famous divorce case of all time.

605
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,394
That's right.

606
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:07,629
lt's not about who gets the beachfront
property or who gets the Rolls...

607
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,466
or who gets the kids.

608
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,632
lt's about who gets the kidneys...

609
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:18,009
which one gets the leg,
who gets the lung.

610
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:23,643
Those guys-- Yang and Dang,
Ding and Bing, whatever their names--

611
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,052
those guys from the picture postcard--
they had good quality of life.

612
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:30,455
They both had wives,
they both had homes...

613
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:34,620
they both had children,
and they had a lot of dough too.

614
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,666
You see? Look...

615
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,430
a disease is not a disease
unless it's marketable.

616
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,537
What are you doing here?

617
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:48,610
l'm just sitting here
talking with the guys.

618
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,679
l told you to meet me
downstairs in the lobby.

619
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,647
- Yeah, okay, well--
- Get out of here!

620
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,688
You know, one last thing.
Did l mention sitcoms?

621
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,953
They do sitcoms all the time
with physically challenged people.

622
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,494
All right.
One last thing, though.

623
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:10,156
lf l take you out in public,
you have got to stop whispering.

624
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:12,530
Because it might be part of your act,
but it's just downright rude.

625
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,470
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What do you mean?

626
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:19,440
l had to see for myself.
You think those guys can act?

627
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:23,000
Knock it off, Jay. You're not doing shit
and not with them, okay?

628
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:26,013
You know what you got in there?
You got a million bucks in your room.

629
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:28,516
You wanna just let it go away
like that? All right?

630
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:32,111
l'll tell you something:
l barely got you back in your apartment.

631
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:34,086
Don't be stupid.
This is a lot of money.

632
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,353
- What were you saying at breakfast?
- What was l saying at breakfast?

633
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,088
Don't get that way with me, okay?
You know what you were saying.

634
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:42,756
You were talking about a country home,
getting out of the city, right?

635
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,465
- Yeah.
- Bingo.

636
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,331
That's right. Behind door number one.
lt's right there.

637
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,563
l don't want to be a part
of your sick fucking schemes.

638
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,230
Wait a minute.

639
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:57,244
You can't just fuck me off when you've
got a million bucks sitting in there.

640
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,315
When you couldn't get a job, who got you
in bed with the photographers?

641
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,543
Who took care of you
every step of the way?

642
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,950
Hold on a second.
You can't just dump me like that.

643
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:09,388
Don't get all Mother Teresa on me
just because you had a retard--

644
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,687
<i>Okay, all right.
You couldn't take care of it.</i>

645
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:15,127
You were right to get rid of him, but
you can't replace him with those freaks.

646
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:18,530
You're a lousy excuse
for a fucking man, all right?

647
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,568
- So how was it?
- How was what?

648
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:23,536
Come on, tell me.
Did they double your pleasure?

649
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,137
Fuckin' bitch.

650
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:40,452
Shit.

651
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,104
Over there.

652
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,461
lt's Penny.

653
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,564
Oh, open up.

654
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,104
Hello, Blake?

655
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:51,980
Are you gonna let me in?

656
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:08,630
Blake, Francis, it's Jay.
lt's not me.

657
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,639
l told you she was gonna come here.

658
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,340
What do you wanna do?

659
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,347
- l bought you some food.
- Let's just wait a few minutes...

660
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,274
then she'll go.

661
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,124
Are you gonna let me in?

662
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,222
She isn't gonna leave.

663
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,163
l think we should talk to her.

664
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,996
No.
Not after what she did.

665
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:45,005
lt wasn't her fault.

666
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,175
l forgot.

667
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,009
You're in love.

668
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:54,048
l'm not in love.

669
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,051
Well, that's good.

670
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:02,689
Look, Francis.

671
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,089
<i>She's nice.
She took care of us when you were ill.</i>

672
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,993
- l still don't like her.
- Why?

673
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,339
l just don't.

674
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,246
You're jeaIous.

675
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:28,182
Of what?

676
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,218
A hooker?

677
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:24,998
Are you gonna answer the phone?

678
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,388
Jesus! Shut up!

679
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,994
What's wrong?

680
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,629
Us...

681
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:36,262
lying here,
back in this bed.

682
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,010
You want to leave?

683
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:47,214
l wish l could.

684
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,012
l wish l could just get up
and walk out of here...

685
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:52,018
on my own.

686
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:54,554
And separate?

687
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,518
You'd only be half a man to her.

688
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,365
l'd be free.

689
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:19,973
What are you doing, Blake?

690
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,709
- l'm leaving.
- What are you doing?

691
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:24,043
l'm leaving. Let go.

692
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:27,280
lt's not about freedom.

693
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,252
Let go!

694
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:36,962
lt's about...

695
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:39,260
cutting us...

696
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,268
in half.

697
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:45,635
You'd be a cripple.
You'd be maimed.

698
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:52,042
Somebody who pisses in the bag
and carries it around with them.

699
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:54,547
Well, it may be better...

700
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,720
than carrying you around.

701
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,085
Come on, Francis.
Let go!

702
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,466
You took the short road.

703
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,668
You always fall in love
too quickly!

704
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,375
Did you ever think...

705
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:32,613
that if l took the long road
you wouId have never lasted?

706
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,621
Did you ever think...

707
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:36,486
about me?

708
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:40,555
God Almighty, Marvin is askin'
what's goin' on, y'all?

709
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:55,999
My fellow neighbor,
may l help you?

710
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,301
Yes.

711
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,966
Could you please...

712
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:03,510
close our door?

713
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,603
l assume that the person
next to you is...

714
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:07,614
all right?

715
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:12,053
And who are you?

716
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:16,488
Me? Oh, in Spanish
they call me Jesus.

717
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:18,183
But in plain English...

718
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:19,988
l'm just Jesus.

719
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:22,996
Jesus...

720
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:27,961
my brother Francis is ill.

721
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:34,669
My friend, he ain't lookin' like
no one's brother.

722
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:39,306
lt's okay.
We've been through this.

723
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,279
- He'll snap out of it.
- Tell you what.

724
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,045
l got a car.
l'm gonna take him to a hospital.

725
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:46,950
- Okay?
- No. lt's okay.

726
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,751
My friend,
this child here...

727
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:52,016
is in need of medical help.

728
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:57,360
ln a situation like this, l stand back
and say, ''What would Jesus do?''

729
01:18:57,466 --> 01:19:00,594
And you know what? l am Jesus,
and l know what l'm going to do.

730
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:04,729
- l'm takin' this boy to a hospital.
- No, we can't do that.

731
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,379
Whoa.
Well, l guess you're going too.

732
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,242
You two men.

733
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:22,255
You two are awesome.
You know what l mean?

734
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:24,689
l like what you two represent.

735
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:28,661
Two folks livin' in harmony.
That's right.

736
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,426
You two symbolize peace and love.

737
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:36,095
Like you're the biological realization
of togetherness.

738
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:40,971
You know what?
l hold a marriage-counseling seminar...

739
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:44,307
and l'd like for you two
to speak at it, okay?

740
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:47,939
Because divorce is not even an option
in your marriage.

741
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,218
Hey, l like that.

742
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:05,224
Miss, l need to check
two brothers in.

743
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,493
- Your name, please?
- Jesus.

744
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:10,101
You need some l.D.?

745
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:14,938
<i>No. Please just fill out these forms.
lt doesn't matter who you claim to be.</i>

746
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:19,207
My little sister, these are some
special brothers. They're connected.

747
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:25,350
Even if they're family, they'll
still need to fill out these forms.

748
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:29,549
No, baby girl, this is an emergency,
and these guys can't take the hype, see?

749
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:32,149
- Look.
- Not exactly, l--

750
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,625
l'm not sure l understand.

751
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:35,629
Check it out.

752
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:45,301
- l see. Here. Take this.
- Thank you very much, miss.

753
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,125
Excuse me, Doctor.

754
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:17,034
Are Blake and Francis
gonna be okay?

755
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,470
Are you a relative?

756
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,009
No, l'm a friend.

757
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:27,009
Well, they're stable.
We need to run a few more tests.

758
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:31,142
Once we have those results
we can decide what we want to do.

759
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,221
You don't know how to reach
any of their relatives, do you?

760
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,221
I mean,
this is a very serious matter.

761
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:38,726
l'm sure they would enjoy
all the support that they can get.

762
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:43,256
No, l really don't know.

763
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:47,062
Their birth records indicated that their
mother lived somewhere on Main Street...

764
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,692
at the time they were born.

765
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:52,337
<i>We've tried that number
but we've had no luck reaching her.</i>

766
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,964
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

767
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:46,993
Francis is really sick.

768
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,530
l know.

769
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:15,021
You rest, okay?

770
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,193
lntriguing, isn't it?

771
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,527
Yeah.

772
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:08,033
You look at something like this,
and you go, ''Wow...

773
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:10,043
they are connected.''

774
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:15,207
What's important now is
what they don't share.

775
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:23,651
Whether we did this on the day
they were born or ten years from now...

776
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,749
this day was gonna present itself.

777
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:30,230
lt's a doctor's career day.

778
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:35,260
lf l could figure out why the fusion
occurred in the first place...

779
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:37,304
that would be a career day.

780
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:42,207
There's not one clue
in the medical books why this happens.

781
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:45,507
Why does the egg
stop splitting in them...

782
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,140
and not some other pair of twins?

783
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:52,379
We're just left with whatever
Mother Nature decides to give birth to.

784
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:57,387
Maybe it's not
meant to be figured out.

785
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,619
They're not a puzzle.

786
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:07,391
You are fully aware
of their condition?

787
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:11,631
Yes, l am.

788
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:17,468
Blake has a 50 percent chance
of surviving the surgery.

789
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:22,615
Do you like those chances?

790
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,411
We understand those chances.

791
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,460
Hi.

792
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,394
My name is Penny.

793
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:44,063
<i>Can l help you?</i>

794
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,238
l'm a friend of your boys,
Blake and Francis.

795
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:55,004
Wait, please.
They need you. They're in the hospital.

796
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:15,227
l kept telling Blake that...

797
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,930
l thought something terrible
was wrong.

798
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:22,041
That morning--

799
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:26,011
And they told us...

800
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:29,115
we had Siamese.

801
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:37,717
l didn't even know
what the doctor meant.

802
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:43,627
All l knew about Siamese...

803
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:45,358
were cats.

804
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:53,371
l was in shock.

805
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:59,745
l thought a two-headed kid, right?

806
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:05,616
And l didn't understand.
l just...

807
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:10,649
cried and cried.

808
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,394
Did the doctors give you
any options?

809
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:25,598
l signed on the bottom line.

810
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,673
l was just...

811
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:33,942
hoping that my confusion...

812
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:41,451
l was hoping
my confusion would vanish.

813
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,722
l thought it would.

814
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:52,497
But it's not so easy.

815
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,192
lt's not so simple.

816
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:58,271
lt haunts you.

817
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,216
You trick yourself...

818
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,515
into believing that...

819
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,713
a nice family is gonna adopt them.

820
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,461
But they couldn't adopt...

821
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:26,967
my feelings of abandoning...

822
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:28,969
my boys.

823
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:39,445
l know they'd love to see you.

824
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:43,010
lt doesn't matter about the past.

825
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:46,053
- No. l can't.
- Please.

826
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:02,662
Thanks so much.

827
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:05,426
Thanks for coming.

828
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:07,262
You're welcome.

829
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:09,359
How are they?

830
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:12,371
You knew.

831
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:16,643
Why?

832
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:27,020
Did anyone in their lifetime...

833
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:29,555
ever ask Blake and Francis...

834
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:33,960
if they mind who they are?

835
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:39,723
Did anyone in their lifetime ever
consider their view on who they are?

836
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:45,037
Yeah, l knew.

837
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:48,540
The minute l heard
Francis' heart...

838
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:52,442
l knew it wouldn't pump much longer.

839
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:57,544
They knew it, Penny.

840
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,256
As far as l know,
they checked in that hotel...

841
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:04,257
to die together...

842
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,558
and l wasn't about to interrupt that.

843
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:13,293
You believe in symbols?

844
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:18,638
Two single dollars...

845
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:23,668
put together into one bill...

846
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:27,670
worth twice its value.

847
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:33,345
Tear it in half...

848
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:36,184
and you don't get two single bills.

849
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:40,089
The bill loses all its value.

850
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,993
The strength is in the bond of two.

851
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:51,131
They need each other
to live as one.

852
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,744
l'm sorry, Penny.

853
01:32:00,748 --> 01:32:04,445
Sorry if my diagnosis lets you down.

854
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:40,338
You can't go...

855
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:43,516
without me.

856
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:50,056
l don't know who you are...

857
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,617
and l don't care...

858
01:33:56,163 --> 01:34:00,327
but you brought us
into this world together...

859
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:09,170
and you should take us together.

860
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,718
Oh, God, please.

861
01:34:35,469 --> 01:34:37,437
<i>Their degree of fusion is this:</i>

862
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:40,132
<i>They share some internal organs--</i>

863
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:43,108
<i>liver, kidney and maybe one lung.</i>

864
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:44,643
<i>It's hard to tell
until we get inside.</i>

865
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:48,442
<i>Their circulatory system is
interconnected...</i>

866
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:51,040
<i>though their nervous system is not.</i>

867
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:53,712
<i>- Since their spinal cords don't meet...
- l hear the train coming.</i>

868
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:58,584
<i>their senses of touch are
totally separate.</i>

869
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:54,098
Yeah, l'll never get used to
taking orders.

870
01:36:55,309 --> 01:37:00,212
<i>Oh, wait.
Did you see the April Harper's?</i>

871
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:04,983
- No, l didn't.
- Yeah.

872
01:37:06,086 --> 01:37:07,986
Tryin' the new dish?

873
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:17,293
lt's been long enough.

874
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:25,170
Wait, Miles.

875
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,307
Do not expect
a happy ending, Penny.

876
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:34,545
Don't.

877
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:46,750
Hello.

878
01:38:52,493 --> 01:38:55,462
Oh, hello! l'm June.

879
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:57,120
Hi. l'm Penny.

880
01:38:57,231 --> 01:39:00,029
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

881
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:02,466
- l just baked it.
- No, thank you.

882
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:04,093
Did you have a hard time
finding the ranch?

883
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:08,232
- No, not at all.
- l am so glad.

884
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:12,075
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

885
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:14,079
Come with me, dear.

886
01:39:18,085 --> 01:39:20,713
Most of the performers have left.

887
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:24,053
A few still live on the land,
but...

888
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:26,149
it's not like it used to be.

889
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:30,759
That's Pinky.

890
01:39:31,732 --> 01:39:33,632
Hi, Pinky!

891
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:47,039
They were the best in the show.

892
01:39:47,147 --> 01:39:49,672
l wish you could have seen them.

893
01:39:53,354 --> 01:39:55,254
Hello, honey!

894
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:04,026
He's sleeping.

895
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:06,429
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

896
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:49,658
Wanna play with me?
Yeah?

897
01:42:08,722 --> 01:42:11,213
l'll just do the strumming.

898
01:42:11,325 --> 01:42:13,418
l'll play the chords.
Okay.

899
01:42:33,514 --> 01:42:35,675
<i>Every dollar was 50 cents.</i>

900
01:42:39,419 --> 01:42:42,388
When we were little...

901
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:45,458
we used to search
for train tracks...

902
01:42:45,559 --> 01:42:47,459
in every city we'd visit.

903
01:42:50,564 --> 01:42:54,056
<i>And when we found 'em,
we'd lie down.</i>

904
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:59,028
A rail would split between us.

905
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:02,737
We'd wait for a train.

906
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:09,312
Francis used to say...

907
01:43:10,417 --> 01:43:14,478
''Blake, do you hear the train?''

908
01:43:16,657 --> 01:43:18,591
<i>l'd say, ''No.''</i>

909
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,253
A few minutes would pass.

910
01:43:24,298 --> 01:43:27,096
l'd say to Francis...

911
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:28,691
''Francis...

912
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:31,699
do you hear the train?''

913
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:35,573
<i>He'd say, ''No.''</i>

914
01:43:40,013 --> 01:43:43,449
We thought if a train would come
it would split us apart...

915
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:49,051
and we both would grow
new limbs...

916
01:43:51,525 --> 01:43:54,085
kind of like a lizard grows
a new tail.

917
01:43:57,497 --> 01:43:59,431
But as we grew older...

918
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:04,426
we realized we didn't have a problem
with who we were...

919
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:08,606
just the audience
that came to see us did.

920
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:16,714
We never wanted to be apart
for any other reason...

921
01:44:17,985 --> 01:44:20,112
than being gawked at.

922
01:44:30,163 --> 01:44:32,028
Thank you.

923
01:44:34,735 --> 01:44:37,067
Where are you going?

924
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,634
The story of me...

925
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:46,211
is over.

926
01:44:56,123 --> 01:45:00,116
ln time,
every sad ending will become happy.

927
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:14,202
<i>The sad ending is only because
the author stops telling the story.</i>

928
01:45:16,243 --> 01:45:18,268
<i>But it still goes on...</i>

929
01:45:19,446 --> 01:45:21,380
<i>it's just untold.</i>
