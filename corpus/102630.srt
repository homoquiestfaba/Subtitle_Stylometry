2
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,560
I hate mondays

3
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:50,963
Pookey, cover me. I'm going in.

4
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:03,199
Sleeping beauty, wake up

5
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,910
You can stop dreaming about me,
because I'm here now

6
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,171
Just wake up

7
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:13,941
You've got work to do.
You're not just my owner...

8
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:16,499
...you're my primary care giver

9
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,040
Not now, Garfield

10
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:22,938
Alright, cut the sweet... easy now.

11
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:27,421
Trying to cuddle with me, huh?

12
00:02:27,422 --> 00:02:30,712
Trying to avoid your duties, huh?

13
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,988
Well that just ain't gonna fly!

14
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,794
See, I'm doing my exercise,
doing my job.

15
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:41,615
Just one quick CANNONBALL

16
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,759
- Good morning
- Garfield!

17
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,945
OK, I think you're clean enough now.

18
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,221
Got your towel right here.

19
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:56,412
No, Garfield!

20
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:09,083
It's liver flavoured.

21
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:10,587
MMM Delicious.

22
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:21,586
Ugh, Liver!

23
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:25,593
Actually, it's liver 'flavoured'.

24
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:30,516
That was good breakfast.
Now I think I'll fall off the Catkins diet

25
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:33,947
and get myself a little high fat chaser.

26
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,600
Garfield,
look, the milk truck!

27
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:39,922
Oh, thatta boy Nermal.
The milk truck comes every day.

28
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:46,013
Maybe not today. Maybe it's changing routes?
Maybe this will be the last we'll ever see of him?

29
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:48,309
We're cats,we like milk.
Let's go for it.

30
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,352
- No.
- But...

31
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:53,063
But nothing. I don't leave the
cul-de-sac for anything.

32
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,730
Out there it's a hornet's nest of trouble.
Bad things happen out there, so I don't go out there.

33
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:04,877
Besides,I've found, if you wait long enough.
Everything comes to you.

34
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:09,851
Here come the milk man.
Here come the milk man.

35
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,632
Hey, Nermal.
Let's play Astronaut again today.

36
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,797
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I love that game

37
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,542
- You're such a brave little Astronaut
- Alright

38
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:22,489
Prepare to jump into your spaceship,
Commander Nermal.

39
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,834
Whoa, whoa!
What about the milk?

40
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:26,285
Who needs milk when you can be
in outer space?

41
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:28,460
- We've got a secret mission today.
- Yeah?

42
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,303
You'll be exploring the Milky Way.

43
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,231
I get the chills when you jump in your
little spacecraft.

44
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:36,941
The nation thanks you.
Prepare to blast off!

45
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,272
Three, two, one!

46
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:41,802
Bon Voyage!

47
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:43,257
Look at me go!

48
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:45,305
Don't look down!

49
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:49,948
- Come to papa, baby
- I can see everything up here

50
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,041
I can see my house!

51
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:53,545
Got Milk?

52
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,353
I can see the whole neighbourhood!

53
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,179
Well that's nice.
That's very nice.

54
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,420
Hey, another milk truck!

55
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,147
Ooh, and that is even nicer.

56
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,198
I can see a whole......

57
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,340
Mission accomplished, Nermal

58
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:09,289
Whoa, Garfield. Do it again!
Where did everybody go?

59
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:12,532
You're on the wrong side of the street,
Fat Cat... beat it!

60
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:15,872
And you Luca are on the wrong side of the
evolutionary curve.

61
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:18,704
Ok, that's it.
You're gonna get it good today.

62
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:21,254
I make a point to get it good every day.

63
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:24,424
The real question is, Luca:
How shall I outwit you this time?

64
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:28,077
- With simple maths?
- I know how to spell.

65
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,837
- Or shall I distract you with something shiny?
- Now you're making fun of me. 

66
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,880
I hope so, you're no fun to look at.

67
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:35,307
You'll never get the best of me....

68
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:37,270
I think I just did.

69
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,161
Not the ducks again.

70
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,612
Jump back!
and kiss my skin.

71
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:49,098
If I ever get off this chain,
you're going down.

72
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:53,114
Everybody back up!
I dont know how wild this thing's gonna get.

73
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:56,729
I love the smell of cinnamon apple in 
the morning.

74
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,510
- Smells like victory.
- I hate this fat cat.

75
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:08,752
So much time, and so little I need to do.

76
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,372
Mouse!

77
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:15,276
No thanks, I'm full.

78
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,110
Get him, Garfield

79
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:20,469
Get him, Jon

80
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:30,618
Always gotta be smashing and crashing.

81
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:33,782
Nobody poisons anymore.

82
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,411
There's my ball.

83
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:44,498
What good is a cat,
that can't chase a mouse?

84
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:47,229
I don't do the chase thing.

85
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:55,962
I know you don't hear me.
But can't you just listen?

86
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:02,019
Louis, what are you doing in the
house when Jon's home.

87
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,847
Sorry Garfield,
man I couldn't help it.

88
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:06,667
Look, when he sees you he expects
more from me. Don't you get that?

89
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:09,954
Jon's got those macadamia nut cookies,
I'm trying to maintain.

90
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,218
- You understand?
- Sure, as long as you understand...

91
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,109
that I have to eat you.

92
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:31,087
Good boy! See, I knew you could
do it if you put your mind to it.

93
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:35,148
You're the best cat a guy could have.

94
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:44,763
Have you tasted yourself lately?

95
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,718
Hey, it wasn't exactly the first-class
lounge in there for me either.

96
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:51,704
Get yourself lost, Louis. Take a powder
for a couple of days, get a haircut and grow a beard.

97
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,525
Cool, I owe you one G

98
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,933
<< I've got a question for you. >>

99
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,684
<< Do you love your Cat? >>

100
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:00,153
Finally, back on my regular schedule.

101
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:03,492
<< Make sure he has nothing but Kibbly Kat food >>

102
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,520
That cat's puss is everwhere.
TV, newspapers, t-shirts

103
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:13,581
I wouldn't want that kind of exposure (!)

104
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,552
- Hey buddy
- Cut the small talk

105
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:18,163
What's in the bag?

106
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,181
<< Remember: Be Happy >>

107
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:21,928
I'm happy when I'm with you

108
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:25,429
You delicate melange of tomato paste,
cheese, ground meat and pasta!

109
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:28,512
Garfield, don't even think about it.

110
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:30,105
That's my food.

111
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,260
I may just nibble.

112
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:38,231
<< Thanks Happy, and thank you for joining us >>
<< I'm Christopher Mello, remember: Be Happy >>

113
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,750
Cut!

114
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,519
Give me the Benadril!

115
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,500
Damned cat allergies

116
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:05,764
Any word from the network yet?

117
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:08,428
No, but they're looking for a dog-act
on Good Day New York.

118
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:13,469
Dog act! Story of my life:
Looking for a dog, and I'm stuck with a cat

119
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:17,038
- But the segment went quite well
- "But the segment went quite well"

120
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,003
Of course it went well, you toad.

121
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:21,824
The fifty housewives who saw it, loved it.

122
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:26,200
<< This is Walter J Chapman, reporting live from the Hague >>

123
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,371
Oh, please. What a know-it-all.

124
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:33,526
And everybody always said I was the 
handsome one.

125
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,487
I was the smart one

126
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,851
And I was born first.

127
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:42,232
But there you are, "live from the Hague",
and I'm here working with this sack of dander

128
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,535
on a dead-end regional morning show.

129
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:46,706
<< Back to you, Dan >>

130
00:09:48,774 --> 00:09:49,774
Garfield!

131
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:54,453
Did you eat all four boxes of Lasagne?

132
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:57,245
It's not my fault.
They started it.

133
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:58,559
What am I going to do with you?

134
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,247
Love me, feed me,
never leave me.

135
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:06,992
Let's go for a ride to some place you love 
that always leaves you feeling pampered and refreshed.

136
00:10:06,993 --> 00:10:09,023
Oh I know, Chucky Cheese

137
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:11,316
Thank you!

138
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,177
No, Wendys?

139
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,297
Taco kitty?

140
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:20,798
Well I'm stumped.
Maybe olive garden, for you?

141
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:25,836
The only time I leave my cul-de-sac is
when Jon takes me to the Vet.

142
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:30,518
Which he's been doing a lot recently.
And it appears to have nothing to do with me.

143
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,747
Jon must want to go for his own reason.

144
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:36,828
Well, there's nothing wrong with Garfield

145
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:39,501
He's just a happy, fat, lazy cat.

146
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:40,963
No need for a second opinion.

147
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:44,814
- I worry about him.
- I know you do.

148
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:47,960
Y'know, you care about him
more than any owner I've ever known.

149
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:50,971
'Him' has a name.
Is this an HMO?

150
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:56,937
Let's get Garfield in for his dip,
I wanna talk to you, in private.

151
00:10:58,797 --> 00:10:59,920
She's so beautiful.

152
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:02,969
Mr Pathetic, you've had a crush 
on her since High-School.

153
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,092
Will you please ask her out so she can reject
you, and we can get on with my life?

154
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,912
I have to ask her out.

155
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:11,895
- Wish me luck
- Ok, go get 'em big tiger

156
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:14,836
You the man, you the fella, you the boss

157
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:20,915
You preach to her, show her how the co...
you hopeless loser...

158
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:27,522
Betty how about today you start me off with
a Swedish massage, a manicure and a pedicure

159
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:30,813
Seaweed wrap, loofa, belly rub, tail waxing...

160
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,691
...then crack my toes to finish.

161
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,164
Jon, there's something important I 
need to ask you.

162
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:41,551
Something I wouldn't ask most of the
guys who come in here.

163
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:43,949
No, wait. I think I know where this is going.

164
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,950
You do?

165
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,064
I do!

166
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:48,364
Liz, I've wanted to ask you
the same thing for a very long time.

167
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:50,763
Are you sure we're talking about the same thing?

168
00:11:50,764 --> 00:11:51,764
Absolutely

169
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,315
I've never been more sure of anything in my
entire life

170
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:57,116
Liz, I'm ready to take a chance.

171
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,329
I'm ready for...

172
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:02,509
Thank you

173
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,273
A dog?

174
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,469
A dog, I'm ready for a dog.

175
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,801
I think he likes you.

176
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:15,999
Frisky little fella, isn't he

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,780
His name's Odie, and he's not going to
make it if he has to live his life in a cage

178
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:21,791
He needs to be loved.

179
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:34,705
Well thank you, thank you very much
Ladies and Gentlemen

180
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:37,193
Nah, maybe not in my neighbourhood

181
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,397
Hey, homer, I really gotta run

182
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:45,367
Gotta fly everybody, please, stay behind the
security fence.

183
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:47,287
It's so great of you to come out and see me.

184
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,808
But I've got somebody waiting for me,
very devoted. Almost crippled.

185
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,955
No, please, don't cry.
I know what it's like to be unloved.

186
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,380
Well, you do.

187
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:59,531
I'll try to come back and visit.
And if I don't, I'll try to write. Bye bye

188
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,338
Does anybody know this guy?

189
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,922
Goodbye everybody - Garfield is leaving the building.

190
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:06,841
Jon, you know, you don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

191
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,522
No, no. It's okay.

192
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,700
Some part of me has always wanted to know what 
it's like to have a pet that actually wants to play with you.

193
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:15,381
You're a good friend.

194
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,180
One question:
Am I still gorgeous?

195
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,875
Jon, I think we've got a little problem here.

196
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:23,876
Jon...

197
00:13:24,214 --> 00:13:26,872
I want you to know I can help the transition
go smoothly.

198
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,026
Jon, it's in my seat!

199
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:28,545
Jon...

200
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:29,980
We could all go out together.

201
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:32,117
Park, dog-shows.

202
00:13:32,118 --> 00:13:33,118
Stuff like that

203
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,850
- Jon...
- Wait a minute,

204
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:38,432
are you asking me out?

205
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:43,123
Jonny-boy, the time has come to get a
car-alarm!

206
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:46,026
You're not gonna believe it!
A mongrel-mutt has broken into your car.

207
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:50,021
Garfield, this is Odie.
He's coming home with us.

208
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:52,542
Whoa: you went in there to get a date,
and came out with a dog?

209
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,853
Well that's bad even for you.

210
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:59,812
Oh you're so sad. Oh no no no... 
We're not bringing a dog home with us.

211
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:05,553
Hey, I ride shot-gun!
What are you lookin' at, tick-boy?

212
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:12,656
Jon, it's not too late. Quickly, turn around,
before he finds out where we live!

213
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,279
Please take this trouser-sniffer back!

214
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:18,716
Come on Odie

215
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:21,406
This is your new home.

216
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:29,519
Come on Buddy

217
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Jon...

218
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:37,176
You had me, a chick-magnet.
And now you got a tick-magnet.

219
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:41,374
Garfield, Jon brought a dog home.

220
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:43,143
I am aware, Nermal.

221
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:45,244
Why would he do a thing like that?

222
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:46,286
Gee, I don't know, Nermal.

223
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:51,572
It just seems like a weird thing to do, bringing
a dog into a house that already has a cat.

224
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:58,223
Can we drop it? I mean, it's no big deal.
It's just a splattered bug on the windshield of my life.

225
00:14:59,203 --> 00:15:04,943
A dimwitted, smelly, goofy splattered bug
that I will deal with appropriately and enthusiastically.

226
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:06,082
Come on!

227
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:08,564
As you can see, I'm still Jon's favourite.

228
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,105
See you later, Garfield.

229
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:13,042
Good luck with the bug thing

230
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:19,293
This is payback for the liver thing, isn't it?
Payback, ha ha ha

231
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,782
This is your new home Odie.

232
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:25,393
That's my office over there.

233
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:27,569
The TV over there.

234
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:28,893
The kitchen.

235
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,780
Go see the house.

236
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:35,082
Why don't you draw him a map?

237
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:38,336
Ok, I've got to remain calm, that's all

238
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,978
Jon's a cat-guy,
not a dog-guy

239
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:45,045
This'll last a week, maybe ten days.
Tops.

240
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:47,496
Boy this puppy is stupid gone wild

241
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:51,991
Nah, this is just a bad dream.
I'm going to close my eyes

242
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,422
and when I open them,
everything will be back to normal.

243
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:04,064
Nyagh! That's not normal.

244
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:05,390
Not close.

245
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:09,241
Oh great, dog-cooties.
Somebody innoculate me please?

246
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:17,567
This is a nightmare. I just need a 
little quality time 

247
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,789
with man's real best friend.

248
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,790
Television.

249
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:28,232
No, no. no.

250
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,475
Hey, new guy.
Let me hip ya to the rules, ok.

251
00:16:33,098 --> 00:16:34,890
Number one:
That's my chair.

252
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:39,791
Alright, I even see you raise a leg,
and it's on, it's go time, pal.

253
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
Very well.

254
00:16:56,604 --> 00:17:00,874
Y'know, I may just have a mental
advantage on this guy.

255
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,192
Leave me alone.

256
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:16,247
I'm not kidding, Yodel Odie.

257
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:20,378
Pop a worm pill, and hit the 
road, I'm busy.

258
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,937
You wanna play? Fine.

259
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:23,866
You can be my new astronaut!

260
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,948
You go jump in the pail, and 
we'll shoot you into outer space.

261
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,139
Come on, it's real simple!

262
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:30,153
Here, I'll even throw your ball in there.

263
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:32,437
Follow the ball and jump in the pail.

264
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:33,438
Come on, Odie

265
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:37,964
Just like this, come on over here and
just jump right into the pail and help me.

266
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,450
No, just in here like this...

267
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:43,558
Uh oh - don't touch that!

268
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:49,982
Oh no!

269
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:11,395
Houston, we have a problem.

270
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,522
Odie, Get off the pail.

271
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:19,945
Ok, time for a new game.

272
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:22,886
It's called my claw in your foot game

273
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Come here

274
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,815
I'll just use my left claw

275
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,863
If my legs were longer I'd have caught
you by now - come here!

276
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:32,404
Just wait for one second.

277
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:34,081
Slow... down...

278
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:38,298
Well, well, well

279
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,193
I've got you now fat cat

280
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:42,784
Hey Luca - is that a new chain you're wearing?
Fella?

281
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:45,149
Looks good on ya

282
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,846
You look great.
You been working out?

283
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:48,773
Oh I've been waiting years for this.

284
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:52,694
Would that be regular years,
or dog-years?

285
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:56,399
Get away from me pipsqueak!

286
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,760
You're nothing but a...

287
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,003
Luca, this is Odie.
Odie, Luca.

288
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:03,255
Luca, do me a favour and eat him
for me would you please?

289
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:04,827
Garfield, are you alright?

290
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:05,948
I think so.

291
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:07,774
Luca's about to have Odie for lunch.

292
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:10,577
If it wasn't for Odie, you'd be Luca's chew-toy

293
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:12,468
Yeah, he saved your life.

294
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:14,361
Odie's a hero!

295
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:16,896
Why? Because I wasn't ripped to shreds?

296
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:20,187
No: Odie's an imbecile, 
until further notice.

297
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,525
Hey Moondust, if I were you I'd grab a nice 
piece of carpet

298
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,309
Jon doesn't let me sleep up-top

299
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,990
Ever.

300
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:32,449
Odie...

301
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,576
You wanna sleep in the bed?

302
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:35,577
Ok

303
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:37,548
What?

304
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:40,885
Good boy.

305
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,573
You wanna sleep on the bed tonight?

306
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:45,834
Yes I do. Yes...

307
00:19:45,905 --> 00:19:48,285
I think I'm going to blow cat chow chunks

308
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:50,386
Good night Odie

309
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:51,945
Good night Garfield

310
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:55,726
Great, wish me luck with the nightmares

311
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,001
Another day ruined.

312
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:22,056
Oh, you little suck up!

313
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:31,464
Whoa baby

314
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:36,154
No.

315
00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:38,107
Down. Down dumb dog

316
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,219
What part of 'no' don't you understand?

317
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,516
The push off the chair?

318
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:50,917
I don't wanna play

319
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,193
Oh, look...

320
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:55,000
What am I supposed to say?

321
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:57,291
Thanks for saving my hide with Luca?

322
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,342
Ok, thanks for saving my hide with Luca.
Get off!

323
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:02,738
Where was I? Right here.

324
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:07,983
Whoa, that was a cheap shot.

325
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:10,117
Hit a guy when he's not looking?
Ok...

326
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:13,058
Oh, excuse me, I think you may have
forgotten something.

327
00:21:13,518 --> 00:21:15,198
I saw this and I thought, I was pretty sure
it was your... 

328
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:23,038
Watch out!
You see, you can't touch this.

329
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,574
That's right. Don't sneak up on me, baby.

330
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:31,695
Oh, come on with that!

331
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:33,741
Get that weak step outta here!

332
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:38,093
Is that butt broken?
No it's something like this here....

333
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:43,372
Can you do this?
Shouldn't those hips be in the shop?

334
00:21:44,284 --> 00:21:45,284
Walk this way please...

335
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,869
I'ma walking the dog

336
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,350
Let's step it up a little bit,
something like this....

337
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,612
Whoa, look at this!
Watch out now!

338
00:21:53,774 --> 00:21:55,244
Watch out for this thing!

339
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:03,177
You probably should've practiced in the
garage before you stepped up to someone of my level.

340
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:04,178
Bash up!

341
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:08,194
Maybe something a little bit more challenging.

342
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:10,034
How about this?

343
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,190
Look who's here on the porch.
I'm walking the porch.

344
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:20,716
I'm holding the torch,
I'm ready to scorch.

345
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:23,807
Hey!

346
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:26,241
Look, Garfield's dancing with Odie.

347
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:27,292
They're like buddies now!

348
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:30,355
Odie, what are you doing here?

349
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,650
I was doing a solo dance,
and a creepy dog comes up next to me...

350
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,378
Did you guys see that?

351
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:37,689
Thank you fellas, thank you.

352
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:40,779
Uh oh, here's more trouble.

353
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:47,689
Look at the goony look on his face!

354
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:49,938
Come here Odie

355
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:52,189
Taking him back to the vet?

356
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,060
You're taking him back to the kennel, right?

357
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:57,737
Are you putting him up for adoption?

358
00:22:58,096 --> 00:23:02,836
Hey Garfield, Jon's taking Odie on his
date with Liz and he's leaving you behind!

359
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:04,302
I know, Nermal

360
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:07,148
They're off on an adventure,
and you're still here!

361
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:08,862
And your point is?

362
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:11,310
Well, that's gotta feel bad

363
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:13,913
Being left by Jon, while he takes Odie out.

364
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:16,947
It's like you're not his favourite anymore.

365
00:23:16,948 --> 00:23:22,058
Hey, whaddya say we play brain surgeon?
Would you go get my powertools?

366
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:27,019
This is so sad.
Jon has completely lost his mind.

367
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,068
He doesn't realise how important I am to him.

368
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:34,388
I need to be so understanding of him
at this difficult time.

369
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:36,654
Hey, wait up! Wait up for me!

370
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:37,775
You forgot me!

371
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:39,167
Slow down!
Please slow down!

372
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,873
I'm right back here!

373
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,828
I think I've pulled a hamstring!

374
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:51,821
It's ok. I'm on, relax.

375
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:57,012
Car broke my nose....

376
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,360
Yeah, go on ahead, I'll catch up with you.
It's probably only a mild concussion.

377
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:23,698
Or a skull fracture.

378
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:25,866
Maybe I'll get a cat-scan?

379
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,127
A cat-scan!

380
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,679
Ladies and Gentlemen!

381
00:24:45,003 --> 00:24:47,038
Welcome to the Dog Show!

382
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,749
But what if I compromised a little? How about 
I do the rolling around with the yarn-ball thing?

383
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:55,408
And I'll purr. I'll purr like a Ferrari!

384
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:56,723
Make that a Jaguar.

385
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:01,837
I won't climb drapes though, that's more
than you'd get from some dumb... dog.

386
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,210
Oops, dogs.

387
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,610
What, you're all going to take it personally?

388
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,658
Now I'm gonna die.

389
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:13,095
Now I really am gonna die!

390
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:13,935
Excuse me!

391
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:15,546
Can I get through here?

392
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,318
Going under this tarp.
That's my ear.

393
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,189
Owners, maintain control of your dogs!
Control your dogs now!

394
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:24,418
Music!

395
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:25,992
Music, you idiot!

396
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:29,864
Yeah, play the music....

397
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:32,573
That's my bad knee, stop it

398
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:35,114
Alright, feet don't fail me now!

399
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,149
I apologise for this, please excuse this outburst

400
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,390
This is highly irregular.

401
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:43,383
Odie.

402
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:45,137
Odie.

403
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,488
Come back Odie.

404
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:53,174
Ok, alright, I need a ride

405
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:58,915
Madam, I'm a cat in trouble.
I'm hitching a ride in your moo-moo

406
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,460
Come on, let's move!

407
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,100
Come on pinky, move it out!

408
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,361
Sorry, sorry!

409
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:09,781
Move move move, Pinky, 
Move Pinky move!

410
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:15,940
We certainly have a new star in the arena.

411
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,951
Ladies and gentlemen, this is amazing!

412
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:22,475
Talented little fella, huh

413
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,178
Yah Pinky!

414
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:27,790
They're gaining on us Pinky!

415
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,801
A cat's life is at stake

416
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:36,188
Excuse me ma'am, 
Please call 911 !

417
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:43,194
This is exactly what I deserve anyway

418
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:48,181
I promise if I survive, 
I'll never compete with a dog again

419
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:51,811
Ok, you got me,
but before I say goodbye...

420
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:55,303
Oh isn't this the final irony,
look who's here to witness this:

421
00:26:55,304 --> 00:26:56,912
The mail man!

422
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:58,453
You're so stupid!

423
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:12,938
Odie, come here!

424
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:14,799
That's a good boy!

425
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:24,605
That, is one talented dog!

426
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,770
Y'know, this is exactly the kind of dog
that could have a future in television.

427
00:27:30,771 --> 00:27:34,193
Oh, thank you Mr Chapman,
but Odie's just my pet.

428
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,822
and that's all I really want him to be

429
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:36,823
You're kidding?

430
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:38,381
No.

431
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:39,801
Ok

432
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:41,832
Well, this is for you.

433
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:46,046
And this is for you if you happen to 
change your mind...

434
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:48,662
you just ring me up and say
"Hello, hello, I changed my mind"

435
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:51,273
"I wanna be a star!"

436
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:52,604
- Ok
- Ok

437
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:55,043
Let's hear it for Odie!

438
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:06,828
Our winner today:
a fabulous dancing puppy called Odie.

439
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:11,045
Never leave the cul-de-sac
Never leave the cul-de-sac

440
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:14,192
Never leave the cul-de-sac

441
00:28:17,324 --> 00:28:18,324
I'm home.

442
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:23,901
- I had fun today, thank you
- Yeah, me too

443
00:28:24,173 --> 00:28:25,503
Would you like to come in?

444
00:28:25,628 --> 00:28:26,591
Not today

445
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:27,998
I knew that. I'm sorry

446
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:33,274
Jon, I wanna come over, just not today.
I have to cover for another vet.

447
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:34,275
Oh, really?

448
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:36,283
How's Sunday?

449
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:37,949
Sunday's great.

450
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:41,056
Sunday's good.
Sunday.

451
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:49,715
So I'll see you Sunday.

452
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,888
Why, why has this happened?

453
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:00,262
I was the one!

454
00:29:00,263 --> 00:29:02,223
It was all about me.

455
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:07,388
Not about some stupid, snivelling,
smelly, high-maintenance Disco Dog.

456
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,362
Oh no.

457
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:08,126
You just can't do this Jon.
He's trying to tear us apart, don't you see that?

458
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:11,668
You know me. I'm too lazy to try to 
destroy your house.

459
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:14,399
I was provoked, pushed, prodded,
driven mad. 

460
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:19,698
You can't kick me out of my own house,
like I'm some kind of animal.

461
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:20,906
Oh come on Jon.... Jon....

462
00:30:23,436 --> 00:30:26,446
You know I'm scared of the dark.

463
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,972
I used to have Jon to myself.

464
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:37,155
Day or night, there was noone else.

465
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:42,008
From dawn to dusk,
my meals would come.

466
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:44,875
I'd lounge about in my home

467
00:30:47,532 --> 00:30:49,982
But now I'm out in the cold night.

468
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:55,593
All alone, til the dawn's first light.

469
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,611
I'm in a new-dog state of mind.

470
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,750
Used to think I had a home

471
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:15,112
A special place to call my own

472
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:19,960
But now the dog's in,
and I'm out.

473
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,361
I've got no Jon, I've got no clout

474
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:36,545
I'm in a new-dog state of mind.

475
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:50,028
Leave me alone. You've won.

476
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:56,027
You're inside, with him.
And I'm out here, all by myself.

477
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:23,058
Odie. You came out here to be with me?

478
00:32:23,924 --> 00:32:24,974
I'm touched

479
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,867
And you must be touched in the head!

480
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,219
Bring out the dog,
Bring in the cat

481
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:36,967
See ya in the morning little fella

482
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,021
You know, a puppy needs a little tough-love,
every now and then. 

483
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,352
I think it builds character.

484
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,857
Hello Pookey - miss me?

485
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:53,335
Y'know what: I'm going to make it up to Odie tomorrow. 
I'm going to teach him how to drink out of the toilet.

486
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:56,206
Poor Odie. That cat is such a pig.

487
00:32:56,532 --> 00:32:57,856
Garfield's a pig?

488
00:32:57,857 --> 00:32:59,518
You never put the dog out at night

489
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,639
Why not?

490
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:04,636
Because dogs run away.

491
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:31,374
Sure Jon, I'll eat all your lasagne for you...

492
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:41,501
Oh look, what do we have here....

493
00:34:43,227 --> 00:34:45,187
You're a lost dog.

494
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:52,231
Well, we can fix that.

495
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,249
Oh, do I feel good this morning.

496
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,420
I slept like a fat cat

497
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:05,125
Hey tall dark and human,
What's for breakfast?

498
00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:06,126
Odie!

499
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:07,822
Where are you boy?

500
00:35:07,963 --> 00:35:10,623
Relax, I think he was gonna camp out

501
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:12,896
Odie?

502
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:16,613
Well, he probably had a sleep over at Luca's,
I think....

503
00:35:18,811 --> 00:35:19,811
Odie?

504
00:35:23,982 --> 00:35:28,252
Maybe he's fetching the paper 
for the neighbours?

505
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:31,918
Where is that silly dog?

506
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:40,442
I can't go on like this any more Wendel.
I've got to get a dog.

507
00:35:40,443 --> 00:35:41,905
I think that's a lovely idea.

508
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,396
I know you've been sad 
and lonely since the divorce 

509
00:35:44,397 --> 00:35:45,443
and I've tried to be your friend...

510
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:47,960
Not for me, you imbecile, for the act.

511
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:51,461
If I could get my hands on a 
really talented dog.

512
00:35:52,961 --> 00:35:53,961
Walter J. just choke on his Emmy

513
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:56,481
Like Odie?

514
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:57,888
Yeah

515
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,210
Yeah now he was good.

516
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:02,523
Oh yeah

517
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:05,349
Y'know he was kindy dopey-looking
and spry and...

518
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:07,821
Lost?

519
00:36:14,864 --> 00:36:17,344
Hi, it's Jon. I was just calling to see if
Odie's been over there.

520
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:19,751
I can't find him around. 
My name is Jon Arbuckle...

521
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:22,181
...and I can't find my dog.

522
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:23,842
I've looked all around the neighbourhood,
and I can't seem to find him.

523
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:25,496
He was home last night, but I haven't
seen him this morning....

524
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:27,001
if you see him, give me a call please.

525
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:30,551
Hi it's Jon, I was calling to see if you'd seen
Odie, I think he's run away.

526
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:34,133
I was giving him a bath last night, and
I forgot to put his collar back on.

527
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,427
Because Garfield hates his collar.

528
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:40,436
He's about 15 pounds, he's brownish yellow
with big floppy ears....

529
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:43,167
Would you mind getting that?

530
00:36:43,695 --> 00:36:44,775
I'm offering a reward.

531
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:47,119
Yes, that's right.

532
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:49,738
And he answers to the name of....

533
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,634
- Hi.
- Hi.

534
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:55,281
I'd say the refrigerator is unguarded.

535
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,419
Wha, what are you doing here?

536
00:36:57,946 --> 00:36:59,186
We're having dinner, remember?

537
00:37:00,423 --> 00:37:01,663
Right. Dinner, the two of us.

538
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,430
Tonight. Of Course.

539
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:07,764
- Shall I come in?
- Yeah? 

540
00:37:08,882 --> 00:37:09,602
Yeah, come on in.

541
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,540
Liz, I have a confession...

542
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:18,309
It's not really a confession, 
it's more of an admission.

543
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,261
It's a, you know it's like a declaration.

544
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:24,022
- I have a....
- I love it when you do that

545
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:27,542
- Do what?
- Y'know, trip over yourself.

546
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:32,571
It's cute... It's one of the reasons why
I had a crush on you in high-school.

547
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:35,779
- You had a crush on me?
- Yeah....

548
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:39,355
I thought you were really cute, decent,
not like all those other jerks.

549
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:43,079
I don't believe it, 
I had a crush on you too.

550
00:37:43,316 --> 00:37:44,636
- Isn't that funny...
- Yeah...

551
00:37:46,392 --> 00:37:47,092
Hillarious.

552
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,300
So um, what's your confession,
admission, declaration?

553
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:54,764
Actually, um,

554
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:59,781
I forgot about our dinner... yeah.

555
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,763
That's ok, I can go?

556
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:05,724
No, no. I'm glad you're here.

557
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:07,963
Let me just get my jacket and 
then we'll go.

558
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,620
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

559
00:38:17,451 --> 00:38:20,571
What am I going to do? I've waited for 
this night my entire life...

560
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:23,174
If you tell her the truth, you'll feel
much better.

561
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:27,373
And you wont have to see her any more. It's kinda 
creepy having a vet around the house anyway.

562
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:30,991
I can't go out and pretend that nothing's
happened, can I?

563
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:32,078
Well, I sure could.

564
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:35,629
The one thing you can't do is tell her
the dogs gone...

565
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:36,964
- I gotta tell her.
- No.

566
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,990
- I've gotta to tell her.
- No!

567
00:38:39,672 --> 00:38:41,032
That's not what I said!

568
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,040
Schmuck

569
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:45,601
Liz. We can't go out tonight.

570
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,700
- Why not?
- Odie's run away.

571
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,399
- What?
- He got out last night...

572
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:52,959
I feel terrible. I call the pound, 
I put up posters, I looked everywhere

573
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:55,548
...but I can't find him.

574
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,500
Why didn't you just tell me?

575
00:38:57,557 --> 00:39:01,117
I guess I figured he was the only 
reason you were spending time with me.

576
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:02,402
- Come on.
- No, I'm serious.

577
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,879
No, I mean let's go find him.

578
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:18,728
How can this dog be such a problem
when he's not even here anymore?

579
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:22,483
Well I'm not gonna worry about him.

580
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,701
I believe you found my dog.

581
00:39:25,637 --> 00:39:27,117
He answers to Odie.

582
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,132
- Odie.
- Family name

583
00:39:32,897 --> 00:39:33,617
Oh, Odie. Come on!

584
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:35,839
There you are!

585
00:39:44,602 --> 00:39:46,202
I can live again now.

586
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:47,917
How could I ever repay you?

587
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:50,096
An autograph would be splendid.

588
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
Then splendid it shall be.

589
00:39:57,452 --> 00:39:58,212
<< come on, boy >>

590
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,639
This is ridiculous.

591
00:40:11,427 --> 00:40:12,347
Hey: what are you looking at?

592
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:14,741
Nothing, just looking for some company.

593
00:40:15,006 --> 00:40:17,326
- Keep walking creepo.
- What's going on?

594
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,588
We know how much
you hated Odie.

595
00:40:19,255 --> 00:40:20,655
We know how much you 
wanted him gone.

596
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:23,056
Wait a minute... all I wanted was
to sleep in my own bed...

597
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,941
And to do it you cast Odie out into
the cold, cruel world?

598
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:28,862
We saw how you locked Odie 
outside last night.

599
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:31,995
Oh I don't believe you guys, 
I didn't know he was gonna run away.

600
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,640
He's a dumb dog,
no offence Luca.

601
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,230
Uh, what?

602
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:36,941
You can't blame me for that...

603
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,227
Any one of us could be next.

604
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:42,141
Yeah, there's no room for anybody 
else in Garfield's world.

605
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,800
Oh that's a little dramatic.

606
00:40:45,324 --> 00:40:48,164
Well I may have been a little tough
about protecting my turf,

607
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,260
...but I don't hate the guy.

608
00:40:52,872 --> 00:40:55,792
<< I understand Happy has a big surprise for us, >>
<< a special treat... >>

609
00:40:56,135 --> 00:40:57,335
<< What have you got for us, Happ? >>

610
00:40:57,586 --> 00:41:00,226
<< Ah, guten morgan, Chris >>

611
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:05,109
<< I have been working with a very special new friend... >>
<< And I would like to introduce him to all of you... >>

612
00:41:06,616 --> 00:41:07,736
<< "Odie Schnitzel" >>

613
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:12,885
Lookie here, It's Odie!

614
00:41:14,551 --> 00:41:15,471
And he's safe and sound.

615
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,880
Although he seems to have found
an alternative lifestyle.

616
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:20,956
He still can't dance.

617
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:22,565
Well this gets me off the hook with
Jon and the gang.

618
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:25,379
Now, I'm gonna be the hero.

619
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,157
<< That's one talented dog >>

620
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:31,475
<< I'm glad you think so Chris, >>
<< because I have a little announcement to make >>

621
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:34,154
<< Old Happy Chapman and Odie Schnitzel >>

622
00:41:34,188 --> 00:41:37,628
<< are going to be climing aboard that >>
<< New Amsterdam Ltd. at 3pm >>

623
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:40,572
<< bound to New York city, where we have >>
<< the opportunity to be regular contributors on >>

624
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:43,055
<< "Good Day New York" >>

625
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,396
That's his last name? Schnitzel?

626
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:48,383
Thank you for all your help yesterday...

627
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:49,498
You were great.

628
00:41:49,732 --> 00:41:52,492
Jon, Odie's on TV. 
And he's wearing Lederhosen.

629
00:41:53,184 --> 00:41:54,624
I'm sorry, Garfield. Not now.

630
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:58,952
I upped the reward to $200, and I'm
going to put up some more posters tomorrow.

631
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:01,005
He's clog-dancing I think

632
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
...wearing Lederhosen.

633
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:04,971
I'm sorry, Garfield. Not now.

634
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:06,427
You're gonna miss this...

635
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,332
I'm sorry Liz,  I'll call you later.

636
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:09,051
Garfield's being... Garfield.

637
00:42:10,122 --> 00:42:12,042
Do I have to bark like Lassie?

638
00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:15,833
Come on! Humour me, would ya?
Arf! Arf! Arf! Quickly!

639
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:18,989
While we're young.
Today, let's go!

640
00:42:20,464 --> 00:42:21,184
<< "Remember: Be Happy" >>

641
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:23,881
You're gonna miss this: he's the small one.

642
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:25,579
The small one in the guy's hands....

643
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:29,363
Garfield... I'm not in the mood.

644
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:35,218
Y'know, it's never good when you turn off
my TV, and this may be the worst ever.

645
00:42:38,696 --> 00:42:39,656
Odie's not ready.

646
00:42:39,581 --> 00:42:41,661
He's months of positive reinforcement
away from consistently performing.

647
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:51,652
Happy.
You promised you'd never use that.

648
00:42:52,344 --> 00:42:54,144
That collar is inhumane.

649
00:42:54,845 --> 00:42:55,525
This collar...

650
00:42:57,355 --> 00:42:58,515
...is the dog's future.

651
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,380
Do you have a problem with that?

652
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:08,061
Now we'll see how smart you
really are...

653
00:43:12,994 --> 00:43:13,674
Happy Chapman.

654
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:16,552
Not now Garfield.

655
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:19,673
Jon, you're denser than ever!

656
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:23,073
I gotta think outside the box.

657
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,050
Hey: the box!

658
00:43:25,594 --> 00:43:26,474
Wait a second...

659
00:43:29,187 --> 00:43:29,627
My box.

660
00:43:30,535 --> 00:43:31,775
My box had something on it.

661
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:35,228
"Applejacks", "Frosty Flakes", "Coco Puffs"...

662
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:36,969
"Kibbly kat!", Yes!

663
00:43:38,536 --> 00:43:40,176
There it is: Telegraph Tower!

664
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:43,931
That's where they make the 
"Happy Chapman" show.

665
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:46,349
Yeah, but, how far away can that be?

666
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,520
Hmm, a paw?
A paw and a half maybe?

667
00:43:51,678 --> 00:43:53,318
This is a done-deal. I can do this!

668
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:56,308
No. Can't do this!

669
00:43:58,628 --> 00:44:00,068
Reached physical limits!

670
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:01,843
Shouldn't have tried it without snacks!

671
00:44:02,297 --> 00:44:03,657
Must go back, and re-load.

672
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:20,507
And that's the sign that the tank is full...

673
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:21,237
I can do this.

674
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:22,847
Beyond this intersection, 

675
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,451
is just another intersection.

676
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:26,836
and another, and another.
On the otherhand...

677
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,825
I wonder if there's any meatloaf 
left in the fridge?

678
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:32,345
No, now is not the time for a 
plate of meatloaf.

679
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,490
Now is the time for a plate of courage.

680
00:44:35,274 --> 00:44:36,674
Ladies and Gentlemen: Garfield!

681
00:44:38,236 --> 00:44:39,836
...has left the cul-de-sac.

682
00:44:55,955 --> 00:44:57,475
Now that's more my style.

683
00:44:59,386 --> 00:44:59,666
Oh, Taxi.

684
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:02,506
Step on it, will ya driver?

685
00:45:09,702 --> 00:45:11,382
No, Odie's not a hound-dog.

686
00:45:12,645 --> 00:45:13,765
Yes I'm sure.

687
00:45:14,072 --> 00:45:15,352
No, I don't want another dog.

688
00:45:16,355 --> 00:45:17,515
Thanks anyway.

689
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:19,226
Garfield, lunchtime.

690
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:22,659
I made your favourite, Lasagne.

691
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:29,102
Garfield?

692
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:35,451
Garfield. Where are you?

693
00:45:40,977 --> 00:45:43,137
Can anyone direct me to the
pink building shown on 

694
00:45:43,943 --> 00:45:46,063
the back of the Kibbly Kat box?

695
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,719
It's the one right next to the blue
and orange tree.

696
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:53,105
This doesn't feel pink building-ish...

697
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:00,615
Rats?

698
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,090
Rats the size of... Rats!

699
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:05,721
- Stop

700
00:46:07,116 --> 00:46:09,956
Why am I being surrounded here?
Some of my best friends are vermin.

701
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:12,515
Finally, some meat.

702
00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:14,389
Meat, no. It's not meat.

703
00:46:15,098 --> 00:46:17,058
They measured: it's 100% body fat.
No nutritional value whatsoever.

704
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:21,826
Hey, body fat's good with us.

705
00:46:22,705 --> 00:46:24,145
- Garfield.
- Louis!

706
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:25,869
Hey, what's going on here?

707
00:46:26,256 --> 00:46:28,376
- Louis, my friend!
- Come on I've got 3000 tiny mouths to feed.

708
00:46:29,973 --> 00:46:31,813
Garfield?
What are you doing here?

709
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:33,484
Besides defending my life?

710
00:46:33,734 --> 00:46:35,144
Jon got a dog.

711
00:46:35,074 --> 00:46:36,992
Dog got kidnapped by a TV star.

712
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,237
...I'm trying to rescue him.

713
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,220
Seems like you got yourself 
in a jam, huh?

714
00:46:40,184 --> 00:46:41,704
Wish there was something I could do
to help you out...

715
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:44,708
Louis, I think you and I have an account
still, remember?

716
00:46:45,258 --> 00:46:46,571
The Macadamia-nut cookies?

717
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:48,188
I do love the Macadamias

718
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:53,913
Sorry rat-pack. This cat's with me.
You all gotta roll. Go ahead, roll out.

719
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:55,958
Who wants to go to the Red Lobster alley?

720
00:46:57,081 --> 00:47:00,571
Maybe next time, little critters.
Good luck with the plague and rabies and everything.

721
00:47:01,725 --> 00:47:03,725
Don't push your luck, fat cat.

722
00:47:04,895 --> 00:47:07,415
Garfield, you can't just be wandering 
around the city... 

723
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:11,292
There are dangers everywhere... 
Potholes, subways, animal control.

724
00:47:12,648 --> 00:47:15,105
You think you could get me to
Telegraph Tower?

725
00:47:14,816 --> 00:47:16,546
Two more cookies and you got a deal,

726
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:18,222
but you gotta keep it on the down-low.

727
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:20,392
How down-low do we have to go?

728
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:21,828
Yo, Garfield, are you with me?

729
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:25,127
Louis, this is a little bit lower than
I expected.

730
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:28,366
If I didn't have a box over my head,
I'd be humilated.

731
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,100
Alright, we're almost there.

732
00:47:34,278 --> 00:47:37,078
Now when I give you the signal,
you gotta cross the street.

733
00:47:37,238 --> 00:47:39,838
- Way over there, by the horizon?
- Come on, Garfield!

734
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:41,774
Wait up!
Wait up!

735
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:48,678
Am I dead?

736
00:47:49,528 --> 00:47:51,608
- Garfield, don't move!
- Don't move?

737
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,475
- Not a problem.
- Just wait for the Walk signal.

738
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:02,861
It's a stampede!
If I could just get away from this herd.

739
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:03,626
Garfield?

740
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,124
Garfield, where are you?

741
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:12,007
Garfield, get down from there, man!

742
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:16,186
No, I'm not coming down.  I'm happy to 
live the rest of my life up here, thank you.

743
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:24,479
Liz!
Liz!

744
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:25,457
- What's wrong?
- Garfield's gone.

745
00:48:26,477 --> 00:48:29,091
I think he's run away too.
First Odie, and now Garfield.

746
00:48:29,062 --> 00:48:30,428
Liz, I am the worst pet-owner on
the planet.

747
00:48:30,806 --> 00:48:31,326
What happened?

748
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:32,863
I can't find him,
you gotta help me.

749
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:34,532
I can't live without Garfield.

750
00:48:34,538 --> 00:48:35,698
Let's start at the park.

751
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,400
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? 
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? 

752
00:48:42,843 --> 00:48:43,803
Are we there yet? 
Garfield. Relax!

753
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:46,628
- Look we're here.
- We're here now?

754
00:48:46,306 --> 00:48:48,986
"Curve Service"
The Telegraph Tower, in all it's splendour.

755
00:48:55,028 --> 00:48:56,428
It looks much smaller on the box.

756
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,650
You gotta go all the way up there?
Good luck, player.

757
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:02,694
I'll catch ya later, I don't do the
vertical thing.

758
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:04,184
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- Oh yeah, hold up G.

759
00:49:04,337 --> 00:49:05,987
- What?
- Watch out for the popo, you know...

760
00:49:06,871 --> 00:49:09,991
The 5-0. Controlo. Animal Control, man!

761
00:49:11,552 --> 00:49:12,072
oh, that popo (!)

762
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,080
Keep it squeal.
Thanks partner.

763
00:49:17,828 --> 00:49:19,228
I can't try the door.

764
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,450
I couldn't handle another stampede.

765
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:33,815
First thing, Monday morning.

766
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:35,245
I'm going to get to work on losing those

767
00:49:36,246 --> 00:49:36,766
last 20 pounds.

768
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,956
Ok, everything looks good out there.

769
00:49:46,325 --> 00:49:48,285
Looks like we've got ourselves a blockage.

770
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:58,242
Guess we'll just purge the system.

771
00:50:09,429 --> 00:50:10,749
Pardon me, that wasn't my stomach, was it?

772
00:50:14,751 --> 00:50:16,071
Ah,there's a cooling breeze.

773
00:50:36,271 --> 00:50:39,073
Nyagh, my poor nose!

774
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:42,585
Jon, stop the car!

775
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:50,275
It's Odie.

776
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,675
Somebody found him!

777
00:50:53,388 --> 00:50:54,788
- 52903 Euclid Street.
- Let's go

778
00:50:57,606 --> 00:50:58,166
Odieeeeeeee.

779
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:00,009
Ooooodd.

780
00:51:03,453 --> 00:51:03,973
Oooodster

781
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:07,101
Oood-man

782
00:51:08,472 --> 00:51:09,872
This rescue thing is exhausting.

783
00:51:11,117 --> 00:51:12,908
When do heroes get to eat?

784
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,450
Oh my, it's Odie!

785
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:21,005
Oooodie.

786
00:51:24,203 --> 00:51:24,803
I've found ya.

787
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:28,401
I'm so sorry I got you into this mess.

788
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:30,959
Look, we kinda got off on the wrong paw.

789
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:33,897
But, come on, you can be really annoying sometimes

790
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:35,323
and you don't give me enough space.

791
00:51:35,471 --> 00:51:38,671
And you're a major league suck up...
but we have a common purpose

792
00:51:41,063 --> 00:51:41,943
We share Jon.

793
00:51:42,286 --> 00:51:43,486
Jon needs us even more.

794
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:46,573
And, I kinda want you back home too.

795
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:49,423
So: stand back.

796
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:51,748
Almost there....

797
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,968
You think he's ready for the audition?

798
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:02,865
Well, why don't you see for yourself?

799
00:52:04,728 --> 00:52:06,608
Come on, Odie.
Showtime.

800
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:16,185
"Good Day New York" - I know you're
gonna flip for Odie because he

801
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:19,024
sure is flipping for you...

802
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:23,669
A shock-collar?

803
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:26,007
That's inhumane.

804
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:29,890
Hot doggy...

805
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:35,128
- When does our train leave?
- Two hours

806
00:52:41,552 --> 00:52:44,352
Poor Odie. He faces a future of
torture, neglect and degradation.

807
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,331
Hey nobody gets to mistreat my dog like that,
except me.

808
00:52:58,704 --> 00:53:00,384
I'll be right behind ya, little buddy.

809
00:53:16,775 --> 00:53:17,855
Gravity, do your thing!

810
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:38,019
Y'know, I think I had a nightmare like
this once...

811
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:56,549
Once again, my life has been saved
by the miracle of Lasagne.

812
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,620
I said Limo, not taxi,
do you know the difference?

813
00:54:03,947 --> 00:54:05,667
Odie here I come.
Don't worry, fella, I'll rescue you.

814
00:54:09,397 --> 00:54:10,517
- Gotcha
- Huh?

815
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,360
Well, what have we got here?

816
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:15,721
Looks like we got us a cat with no tags.

817
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:20,309
Hey, there's an animal felony happening right
there behind you. 

818
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:23,598
I'm trying to do some rescue work here, pal

819
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,884
Welcome to my world, Red.

820
00:54:30,163 --> 00:54:32,243
This is police brutality.

821
00:54:31,713 --> 00:54:34,353
I have tags. I just left them in my
other fur.

822
00:54:35,183 --> 00:54:36,103
This is abusive, now. This is abuse.

823
00:54:40,138 --> 00:54:42,138
- What is with the cage?
- Ok, lock her down.

824
00:54:44,005 --> 00:54:46,685
Oh no this is insulting. You know
I'm house-trained.

825
00:54:47,436 --> 00:54:51,276
- Settle down people
- Oh, I oughta give you a bunch of fives, pal.

826
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,225
This is all a terrible mistake.

827
00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:56,529
I was trying to save a friend.

828
00:54:57,363 --> 00:55:00,803
He's not very smart, he needed my help.
I don't belong in here.

829
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:02,711
I have an owner.
I'm not a stray.

830
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:06,582
- Hi, I'm Jon Arbuckle
- Hi

831
00:55:07,698 --> 00:55:09,338
I think you have my dog, Odie?

832
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:11,133
I think you're mistaken.

833
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,040
No, I saw the flyer. Odie's my dog.

834
00:55:12,745 --> 00:55:14,545
No, he's Happy Chapman's dog.

835
00:55:15,754 --> 00:55:16,474
Happy Chapman?

836
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,780
The gentleman with the cat on
Channel 37.

837
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,087
He came and took Odie home.

838
00:55:25,565 --> 00:55:27,325
Odie's a family name, y'know?

839
00:55:29,574 --> 00:55:30,934
Well, good day.

840
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,743
Happy Chapman took Odie.

841
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,810
He's got Garfield too?

842
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:39,451
I don't know. But we're gonna find out.

843
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:56,011
Could you please be quiet.

844
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:59,357
Guards, Guards!
Oh this really is too much.

845
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:01,514
Persnikitty!

846
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,964
Happy Chapman's cat! What are you
doing in here?

847
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:05,868
I 'was' his cat.

848
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:09,349
until I outlived my purpose.

849
00:56:09,663 --> 00:56:11,103
Then he replaced me with a dog.

850
00:56:11,822 --> 00:56:13,022
and dumped me in this wretched place.

851
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:15,774
All humans are the same.

852
00:56:16,257 --> 00:56:17,337
Not Jon, my owner.

853
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:19,924
No way, he only does what's best
for me.

854
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:22,701
He puts up with me, then he feeds me.

855
00:56:23,305 --> 00:56:25,283
And he lets you vacation in this
charming animal pound. Hello?

856
00:56:26,602 --> 00:56:28,242
Not for long, Persnikitty.

857
00:56:28,213 --> 00:56:30,001
Would you please just stop calling me that.

858
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,972
My name isn't really Persnikitty...

859
00:56:32,907 --> 00:56:33,627
It's Sir Roland.

860
00:56:34,573 --> 00:56:35,173
Sir Roland?

861
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:38,034
Yes, another one of Happy Chapman's
acts of cruelty.

862
00:56:38,516 --> 00:56:40,836
I was trained in the classical theatre,
you know...

863
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:43,369
But now, I'm a "Celebrity Cable Cast-off Cat"

864
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:46,713
with a name I can never live down.

865
00:56:47,134 --> 00:56:48,682
Well, this may hurt a little then,

866
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:51,951
I'm trying to rescue the dog that replaced
you, Persnikitty.

867
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:53,412
I mean, Roland.

868
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:56,306
Happy and Odie are getting on a train in less 
than two hours,

869
00:56:56,442 --> 00:56:59,279
going to New York to become regulars on
"Good Day New York".

870
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:00,479
Wait a minute: did I just hear that right?

871
00:57:02,703 --> 00:57:05,543
You're a cat that's trying to rescue a dog?

872
00:57:06,363 --> 00:57:09,181
It's true. I know, it's a crime against
nature,

873
00:57:09,608 --> 00:57:11,048
at first I thought he was a pain, but,

874
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,600
he's grown on me. Like a wart you wanna
have removed until you realise

875
00:57:15,273 --> 00:57:18,193
it defines you, in some funny way.

876
00:57:18,888 --> 00:57:21,088
Do you know, that is absolutely
charming?

877
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:23,496
Let me ask you a question, chubby.

878
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:25,589
What are you talking about?

879
00:57:26,614 --> 00:57:27,694
How could you understand?

880
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:29,182
He's my friend.

881
00:57:31,927 --> 00:57:32,927
Oh, my gosh. How low have I sunk?

882
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,848
Guard, may I have some shoelaces please.

883
00:57:37,311 --> 00:57:37,911
Well, hello there.

884
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,409
Right on time. Alright,  I need a five-cat
line up right now.

885
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,160
What's going on?

886
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:48,101
Adoption. It's like one of us is getting
outta here.

887
00:57:48,693 --> 00:57:49,573
So, here to look at a cat?

888
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:51,373
Alright, let's see if we can't take care of that.

889
00:57:54,172 --> 00:57:55,172
Come on boys, lets hurry it up

890
00:57:55,344 --> 00:57:56,664
Can I say, your hands are freezing.

891
00:57:57,431 --> 00:57:57,911
Come here

892
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:09,377
- You are heavy.
- Excuse me, muscle weighs more than fat. Check this.

893
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:17,866
Alright, line it up. Paws on the white line.
Tails in the air.

894
00:58:18,986 --> 00:58:22,386
I don't need to be adopted guys.
My guy Jon is coming to get me, I'm sure.

895
00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:24,429
- That one!
- Really?

896
00:58:25,194 --> 00:58:26,754
She picked me, she picked me.
She picked me, she picked me.

897
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:30,311
No, not that one. That one.

898
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,148
The one that looks like the cat on TV.

899
00:58:34,275 --> 00:58:35,835
Back it up, Red.

900
00:58:37,276 --> 00:58:38,316
Sorry love, better luck next time.

901
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:40,378
Now you be careful. That's sore.

902
00:58:43,426 --> 00:58:45,746
Jon's going to be here in
five minutes anyway.

903
00:58:45,782 --> 00:58:48,022
When I give the signal, run like a mad-cow.

904
00:58:48,494 --> 00:58:50,454
- What?
- Don't you want to save your friend?

905
00:58:50,397 --> 00:58:52,277
- Do I really have to run?
- Now!

906
00:58:52,774 --> 00:58:54,134
Eat Hairball, Happy Chapman.

907
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,330
 

908
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:01,131
 

909
00:59:25,836 --> 00:59:27,676
We've got runners!
We've got runners!

910
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,060
Stop!

911
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,840
You've not been cleared for release!

912
00:59:31,997 --> 00:59:33,117
 

913
01:00:01,207 --> 01:00:02,238
Garfield's been here.

914
01:00:02,857 --> 01:00:04,017
Excuse me, can I help you guys with something?

915
01:00:04,585 --> 01:00:06,145
We're looking for Happy Chapman.

916
01:00:06,287 --> 01:00:08,821
Yeah he's on his way to the train station,
he's going to New York.

917
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:10,310
Do you guys have a pass, or something?

918
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:13,446
Thanks

919
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,335
  

920
01:00:19,502 --> 01:00:20,222
Hello, excuse me.

921
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,656
<< Your attention please >>

922
01:00:23,323 --> 01:00:25,363
<< The Amsterdam Ltd. is now departing >>

923
01:00:26,202 --> 01:00:27,722
<< from Platform 12 >>

924
01:00:29,641 --> 01:00:31,401
All aboard!

925
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,143
All Aboard!

926
01:00:41,158 --> 01:00:42,118
Good afternoon, Gentlemen.

927
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,367
What will you be having today?
Salmon, Steak or Lasagne?

928
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:46,688
Steak. I hate Lasagne.

929
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:50,592
Beep Beep!
Cat coming through! Beep Beep!

930
01:00:51,435 --> 01:00:52,395
Going through the tunnel.

931
01:00:53,313 --> 01:00:53,873
I just had to do that.

932
01:00:54,073 --> 01:01:00,719
<< Final call for the new Amsterdam Ltd. >>
<< The Amsterdam Ltd. is now departing from Platform 12 >>

933
01:01:03,919 --> 01:01:08,519
No... wait... please.
Stop. Wait. Don't!

934
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:11,671
You monster Chapman.

935
01:01:14,974 --> 01:01:16,214
I can't out-run a train.

936
01:01:17,443 --> 01:01:18,923
Watch the train, pal.

937
01:01:20,771 --> 01:01:21,671
Hey, I got it.

938
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,540
It's just a train set, only bigger.

939
01:01:28,073 --> 01:01:29,593
- Oh no, we're too late.
- No... 

940
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,522
...we're gonna stop that train.

941
01:01:31,656 --> 01:01:31,976
Come on.

942
01:01:34,268 --> 01:01:35,468
Somewhere around here

943
01:01:35,789 --> 01:01:37,029
There's got to be a big table

944
01:01:38,442 --> 01:01:39,922
With all the trains on it.

945
01:01:47,418 --> 01:01:48,818
He looks like the type.

946
01:01:49,841 --> 01:01:51,961
And this must be where he's got 
his little table...

947
01:01:57,206 --> 01:01:58,720
I'm very sorry sir, there's simply no way 
to stop that train.

948
01:01:58,797 --> 01:02:00,877
You don't understand, you have to
stop the train.

949
01:02:01,048 --> 01:02:02,968
My dog and my cat are on that train.

950
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:06,612
I suppose if Jon can do this, I can.

951
01:02:11,508 --> 01:02:14,908
Ok, we gotta find our train.
Let's see what happens when I do this...

952
01:02:18,479 --> 01:02:20,599
<< Boston Express switching to track 18. >>

953
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:23,251
Oh, I'm sorry.
The folks in Boston are going to be a little late today.

954
01:02:28,337 --> 01:02:29,977
Let's see what happens when I do this...

955
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,630
- << Warning, Seattle Wind... >>
- No, I don't care about Seattle.

956
01:02:37,324 --> 01:02:39,444
Ma'am, I'm looking for one train in particular.

957
01:02:40,588 --> 01:02:42,548
Just one second, I'm trying to find
my train.

958
01:02:43,944 --> 01:02:46,304
- << The New Amsterdam Ltd. >>
- There's the Amsterdam.

959
01:02:49,653 --> 01:02:53,133
- << Warning: collision 20 seconds >>
- Gosh, you sound like my mother.

960
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,260
Hold up, everybody stop!

961
01:03:01,765 --> 01:03:03,125
- Five, four...
- Stop what you're doing...

962
01:03:13,805 --> 01:03:16,085
Ok, everybody - let's take it from the top.

963
01:03:21,028 --> 01:03:22,908
- You have to stop that train...
- Hold on.

964
01:03:24,851 --> 01:03:26,971
I'll be down to meet you at the station, Odie.

965
01:03:28,662 --> 01:03:31,822
Actually, that train has stopped.
It's returning to the station.

966
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:35,541
Are we on the right train?

967
01:03:44,745 --> 01:03:45,385
Where are ya?

968
01:03:48,689 --> 01:03:50,129
I think I recognise that whine.

969
01:03:58,826 --> 01:04:01,946
Come on: see, these are the kinda seats
you get when you book at the last minute.

970
01:04:05,366 --> 01:04:07,086
Good to see you, partner.

971
01:04:11,732 --> 01:04:12,692
Let's get outta here.

972
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:18,330
<< Your attention please: the New Amsterdam Ltd. >>
<< Is making an unscheduled stop on Platform 12 >>

973
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:24,054
- Sir, please take your seat.
- No, no... my future is travelling away from me.

974
01:04:54,669 --> 01:04:57,229
Will ya slow down?
I've been doing this running thing all day,

975
01:04:57,984 --> 01:04:58,864
and I am over it.

976
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:01,038
We're safe now, we're free.

977
01:05:02,826 --> 01:05:05,146
- Oh, if it isn't Unhappy Chappy.
- Going somewhere?

978
01:05:08,509 --> 01:05:11,709
Nice accessory, but I don't think I
wanna play dress up with you, pal.

979
01:05:12,285 --> 01:05:13,245
Let's get out of here.
Let's beat it.

980
01:05:17,905 --> 01:05:19,025
Oh, right in the nose again!

981
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,217
So it's gonna get physical, is it?

982
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,000
Did you really think you could just
run away from Happy Chapman?

983
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,560
Oh is this a cry for help.

984
01:05:29,928 --> 01:05:32,248
No dumb, dirty animal is ever gonna get
the better of me.

985
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:37,928
And lets see how you feel with 200 volts
coursing through that thick canine skull of yours.

986
01:05:38,763 --> 01:05:39,923
- Chapman...
- Come here.

987
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:41,939
Get your hands off of my friend!

988
01:05:51,331 --> 01:05:52,851
Hey boomer, what round is it?

989
01:05:53,245 --> 01:05:55,125
- Good to see you, Chubby.
- We're here to help

990
01:05:55,909 --> 01:05:57,229
- Sir Roland?
- In the fur.

991
01:06:32,307 --> 01:06:35,347
Alright, here's the drill.
Cats, scratch like you've never scratched before.

992
01:06:35,944 --> 01:06:37,624
Dogs, bite... but don't chew.

993
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:40,845
and rats. See if you can get that
pretty necklace around his neck.

994
01:06:44,815 --> 01:06:50,255
Canines, Felines and Vermines...
It's show time!

995
01:06:56,985 --> 01:06:57,705
Thanks boys.

996
01:06:58,101 --> 01:06:59,701
Thanks boys.
The home team will take it from here.

997
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:02,318
Better split before Animal Control
gets here.

998
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:03,848
Hey Garfield, take it easy.

999
01:07:04,082 --> 01:07:05,122
Garfield good luck.

1000
01:07:07,222 --> 01:07:09,662
Odie would you mind sharing the remote,
please?

1001
01:07:13,552 --> 01:07:15,072
Every dog has his day, Happy.

1002
01:07:17,656 --> 01:07:20,016
- Nice Kitty.
- Let's see what's on the news...

1003
01:07:24,259 --> 01:07:25,499
Let me tell you something, Happy.

1004
01:07:26,133 --> 01:07:30,613
To you Odie might be just a dumb, stupid,
smelly dog. But to me...

1005
01:07:31,812 --> 01:07:33,212
he's all that and much more.

1006
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:35,749
He's my friend.

1007
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,060
Odie, try something else.
Maybe there's a game on?

1008
01:07:47,493 --> 01:07:48,453
Strong finish little buddy.

1009
01:07:50,475 --> 01:07:51,275
Odie, Garfield?

1010
01:07:52,529 --> 01:07:53,369
- Odie?
- Odie?

1011
01:07:57,404 --> 01:07:57,924
Be Happy.

1012
01:07:58,626 --> 01:08:00,546
This is for stealing my dog and my cat.

1013
01:08:04,699 --> 01:08:07,232
He didn't steal me. 
I was doing the rescue work.

1014
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:07,779
Garfield! Odie!

1015
01:08:09,183 --> 01:08:09,543
Come here!

1016
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,784
I missed you guys so much.
I was so worried about you...

1017
01:08:15,094 --> 01:08:17,143
Never gonna let you out of my 
sight again.

1018
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:18,848
Never. You guys are my best friends.

1019
01:08:20,214 --> 01:08:21,054
You have me, but hello.

1020
01:08:25,741 --> 01:08:28,741
<< This is Walter J. Chapman with breaking news from >>
<< the Midwest. >>

1021
01:08:29,207 --> 01:08:31,607
<< Abby Shields reporting, >>
<< whatcha got for me, Abby? >>

1022
01:08:32,563 --> 01:08:35,803
<< Details are sketchy, but it appears that >>
<< a derranged man >>

1023
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,838
<< may be the cause of all the trouble here. >>

1024
01:08:37,652 --> 01:08:38,892
A derranged man?
What is this?

1025
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:43,573
<< Police are bringing the suspect out >>
<< as we speak >>

1026
01:08:43,923 --> 01:08:45,123
Good grief, it's my idiot brother.

1027
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:47,175
Hey - that's Happy Chapman!

1028
01:08:48,935 --> 01:08:51,255
He's going for a ride in a Police car.

1029
01:08:51,976 --> 01:08:55,536
<< But sources tell me that this incident somehow >>

1030
01:08:56,444 --> 01:08:58,124
<< involved a dog and a very heroic cat. >>
- Garfield!

1031
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:00,904
He saved Odie. Now he's a hero!

1032
01:09:04,233 --> 01:09:07,113
- Oh, I didn't realise.
- Garfield's on TV - he's a hero!

1033
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:13,325
Garfield! Garfield's a hero now!

1034
01:09:14,038 --> 01:09:14,438
Thanks everybody

1035
01:09:17,174 --> 01:09:18,614
We're a whole street full of heroes

1036
01:09:27,929 --> 01:09:33,689
- It's nice to be recognised by your peers.
- I couldn't have done this without you.

1037
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,650
You're a really great friend.

1038
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:41,441
Jon, I wanna be more than your friend.

1039
01:09:44,512 --> 01:09:45,152
- Me?
- Yeah.

1040
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:51,189
Where do they find the energy?

1041
01:10:11,064 --> 01:10:12,904
Yeah, just one big happy family.

1042
01:10:15,966 --> 01:10:17,566
Yeah, right.
Hit the floor.

1043
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:23,134
No, seriously, you can come up buddy.
Seriously, come on up.

1044
01:10:25,749 --> 01:10:27,669
Down you go. We just hit it off so well,
because we both love the same thing...

1045
01:10:29,413 --> 01:10:31,813
and that is: Me!

1046
01:10:33,015 --> 01:10:33,215
Whoa!

1047
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:35,251
<< I feel good >>

1048
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:38,908
<< I knew that I would now >>

1049
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:41,577
<< I feel good >>

1050
01:10:44,043 --> 01:10:45,843
<< I knew that I would now >>

1051
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,280
<< So good >>

1052
01:10:49,185 --> 01:10:49,825
<< So good >>

1053
01:10:50,775 --> 01:10:51,695
<< I got you >>

1054
01:10:54,109 --> 01:10:54,749
<< So good >>

1055
01:10:55,809 --> 01:10:56,449
<< So good >>

1056
01:10:57,247 --> 01:10:59,167
<< I got you >>

1057
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:10,167
Oops

1058
01:11:10,872 --> 01:11:13,832
Hey Odie, help me...
I can't get up!

1059
01:11:13,032 --> 01:11:13,032
