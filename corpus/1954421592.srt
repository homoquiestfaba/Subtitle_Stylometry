not to be forgotten.

51
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:30,004

you coulda saved them bruises,

52
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:32,178
and have a good laugh.

53
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,050

00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:36,784

00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,015

56
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,359
- Here.
- Yes, sir.

means shit in this part of town.

67
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,249
Tossing balls now and then,

68
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,189

70
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,053

71
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:55,156

75
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:13,487
He was kicked out
for game-rigging.

76
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,612
He's the one.

77
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,020
Cute.

78
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:30,158
You outnumbered him,
yet, he still bested you?

79
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,609
If I wanted to, I could have smashed
his spine and every bone in his body.

80
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,573
But we outnumbered him,

81
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,843
so we went gentle.

82
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,625

Look at this prick.

86
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,100
It's unacceptable to come back empty
from a collection.

87
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,704
Jong-ho, weren't you
on top of this?

88
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:17,811
Rockfish still has some clout

00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:21,318

00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,789
Don't make excuses like a bitch.

91
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:31,156
You're the fuck who called?

92
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:34,234
This guy's a piece of work.

93
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,658
You want a loan
for the compensation?

94
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,606
Isn't that why
you wanted to see me?

95
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,538
I don't got shit.

96
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:46,000

ask a shady loan shark?

97
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:49,003
Brave motherfucker, this one.

98
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,074

100
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:54,282

101
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:58,914

00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:03,891
What'll you do
for the money?

103
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,769
Shouldn't you at least
have some credibility?

104
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,599
He's called Rockfish
a retired gangster.

105
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:19,334
This fat fuck took off
with our money.

106
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:23,471
Young man, isn't life
more important than money?

107
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,749
Don't get worked up
and get killed,

108
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,610
sit this one out
and observe.

109
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:30,147
See how pros do it.

110
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,617
- Let's go!
- Yes, boss.

111
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,087

you hear me?!

112
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:09,421

Who the fuck are you?

116
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,886
Do you know who I am?

117
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:41,293
So, you're goldfish?

118

125
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,453
Done deal?

126
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,597
Everyone knows you now,
what will you do?

127
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:29,398
- Why do you care?
- Why shouldn't I?

128
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,127
Continue working for us.

129
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,341
You got the chops.

130
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,737
Overconfidence alone won't
put food on the table.

131
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:45,112
Either cook, or line up
at a soup kitchen.

132
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:47,749
If not...

133
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:55,893
starve to death.

134
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,772
When does he start?

135
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:24,476
He'll report tomorrow, sir.

136
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:31,015

138
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,919
She's doing well.

139
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:38,128
The old man likes her too.

140
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:40,594
Tell her to keep a good watch.

141
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:42,800
Put him in good mood.

142
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:43,965
Yes, sir.

143
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:00,947
Hi!

144
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,926
Got a boner?

145
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:11,130
Let's go.

146
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,970
Boss, he's in great shape.

147
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,627
I picked out his clothes.

148
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:22,496
He's got a good build,
so everything fits.

149
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:24,773
Even rags look good on him.

150
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,871
Fuck that shit,
look how skinny he is.

151
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:32,373
Leave the past behind,
and have a fresh start.

152
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,352
Yes, sir.

153
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,710
Come on, boss!

154
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,578
He took care of a weak ass bitch,

155
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:41,618
there's no need to
put him on a high horse.

156
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:46,226
Fucking gambler.

157
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,403
What the fuck
are you staring at?

158
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,002
I'll fucking rip your eyes out!

159
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,709

160
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:57,939
Get the fuck up!

161
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,206
Calm down.

162
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,351
Hwan is now part of the family.

163
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:14,626
Raise your glasses.

164
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,854
Didn't make you
for a cheap drunk.

165
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,660
Stay with Kyung-su
and learn the ropes.

166
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:23,991
Yes, sir.

167
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,400
Wait, come here.

168
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,037
Fucking smooth.

169
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,611
Stick it at the right height.

170
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,974
When you're on the toilet,

171
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,742

And at that moment,
they have to see the sticker.

174
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:02,089
Don't you see this?

175
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,858
I know it's an Au-fucking-di.

176
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,127

Wait, please!

178
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:31,160
Let's go.

179
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:34,655
No, I'm not done here.

180
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:35,691

185
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:55,711
You fucking nuts?!

186
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:59,489
Fuck off!

187
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,093
Hands off!

188
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:03,689
HVe-jllng, you're up.

189
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,716
100 grand!

190
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,350
200!

191
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:37,291
Jackpot!
Holy fucking shit!

192
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:37,917
Going home?

193
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,159
What's the most useless thing
in our business?

194
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:47,024
Sir?

195
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,196
Sympathy.

196
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,998
Sympathy won't make you rich.

197
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:58,668
If you sympathize with a pig,
how'd you eat pork?

198
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,113
So cool...

199
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:09,111
You see?

200
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,419
Once you let go of sympathy,
you gain respect.

201
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,057
Luck or skill?

202
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:19,663
The betting, I mean.

203
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:21,058
You play a lot?

204
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,733
Ball players can't make bets.

205
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:27,767
Baseball is all I know,
so I see the big picture quickly.

206
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:31,409
Why don't you manage
our sports betting website?

207
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,139
If you're so versed in betting,

208
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:38,316
you can manipulate the odds
and game selection to our favor.

209
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:45,722
Think it over
and open the glove compartment.

210
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,523
Take it.

211
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:57,870
It's an older model,
but Benz is still a status symbol.

212
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,831
I'm alright.

213
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,819
You can't park here.

214
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,152
I was about to leave.

215
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:46,773
Got plans tomorrow?

216
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:47,203
Who is he?

217
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,642
Your pimp?

218
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,445
Just a friend.

219
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,044
Missy.

220
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:59,977
You two rubbed uglies,
haven't you?

221
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:04,383
He wouldn't look at me
so menacingly othewvise.

222
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:06,454
Was she tasty?

223
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,318
Her pussy still firm and tight?

224
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,685
Who the fuck are you?!

225
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:12,664
Stop it.

226
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,925
Stop it!

227
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:59,762
I thought he'd get 5 years,
but he only served 3.

228
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,458
Cutter's not someone who'll let
bygones be bygones.

229
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,631
Stay on full alert.

230
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:16,845
Hwan, pay your respect.

231
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:18,781
This is Hwangje's chairman.

232
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,551
He takes care of
our betting website.

233
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:25,916
He's got the wits
and punches to boot.

234
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,226
Probably good at
choking old men too.

235
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:42,968
So the congressman's lobby
didn't work?

236
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:47,072
Buhyun Bank is tight
with the ruling party.

237
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,611
An idiot can only do so much.

238
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:56,586
At least you got the casino
and hotel stakes out of this.

239
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:57,778
Please ease your mind.

240
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:00,919
Imagine doing it on my land,
know how much that'd be?

241
00:35:01,816 --> 00:35:04,922
We're not talking about
a few million.

242
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,865
Take good care of
the men noted there.

243
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:17,601
How did this break...

244
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:25,277
I'm sorry, chairman,
I'll replace it, sir.

245
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,079
Got $500,000 on you?

246
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:31,778
Bury him when you break
hotel ground.

247
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:33,816
Please spare me,
I will...

248
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,892
replace it with something similar
within my power.

249
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,361
I'm sorry sir, please.

250
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:45,865
<i>Due to newly excavated relic</i>

251
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,169
<i>at Blue City construction site,
development will be postponed.</i>

252
00:35:57,438 --> 00:35:58,644
Checkmate.

253
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,360
Do you see those lights?

254
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,196
Aren't those squid boats?

255
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:16,393
Right.

256
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:20,763
Squid come swimming
toward those lights.

257
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:29,743
I guess all living things are
attracted to shiny things.

258
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:32,048
- Agree?
- Yes.

259
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:38,418
Funny thing is,

260
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,854
people call those
'Lights of Night Sea'.

261
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:53,966
But up close,
it's a chaotic slaughterhouse.

262
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,410
Our business is the same.

263
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,713
If you want to succeed,
your eyes have to lit up like that.

264
00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:11,417
Boss...

265
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:16,655
could I ask you something?

266
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:23,935
Why did you take me in?

267
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:29,040
I was at a point of no return.

268
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,435
Lee Hwan.

269
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:34,846
It's a great name.

270
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,148
A name that reeks of money.

271
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,766
<i>3 years later</i>

272
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:33,920
<i>Hwangje Finance</i>

273
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:35,901
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

274
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:40,601
Boss, how do you expect me
to walk away now?

275
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:45,207
Your match rigging article
will be released.

276
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:50,211
We finally got it legalized,
so imagine the backlash.

277
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:51,979
It won't be pretty.

278
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,811
You know full well
how hard I worked on it.

279
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:00,217
By yourself?

280
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:07,062
Anyway, bring me
the complete list of games you fixed.

281
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:15,538
Do you still go to Temptation?

282
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:22,077
A dirty mop is for cleaning,
not to be used as a blanket.

283
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:25,639
Remember that.

284
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,081
Shouldn't you be on
a debt collection run somewhere?

285
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,875
Here to boost my business?

286
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:03,881
What a fucking day...

287
00:41:04,812 --> 00:41:06,655
Look at this bitch!

288
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:11,127
Your promotion isn't
your fucking high horse.

289
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,063
Did I beg for it?

290
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,687
He went too far this time.

291
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:39,982
Isn't it time to cut him loose?

292
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:43,454
Tae-m u .

293
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:46,859
We're going on 15 years, right?

294
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,760
Why do you think I've kept you?

295
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:54,295
Sir?

296
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:58,143
I don't know...

297
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:03,842
Some unique qualities?

298
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,379
You were always by my side.

299
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:14,084
I won't turn my back on
members of my family first.

300
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:19,126
I'll give Hwan a warning,

301
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,461
take care of your own boys.

302
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:25,795
There's another pressing matter.

303
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:30,972
Cutter will be out soon.

304
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:37,581
<i>Busan Penitentiary</i>

305
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:54,524
Only the hungry
grabs the fishing pole.

306
00:42:55,289 --> 00:43:00,637
Are you using Hwan
as your bait?

307
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:05,642
Speak of the devil.

308
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,710
I don't own anything.

309
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:17,350
Money has no master.

310
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,417
Money only lets out a scent.

311
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,996
That scent is
the sweetest in the world.

312
00:43:27,454 --> 00:43:30,924
But once you taste it,
it turns into poison,

313
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:34,663
and rot you from inside.

314
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:38,668
I know you desire to be rich.

315
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:45,149
Then only chase the scent.

316
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,918
Are you sure?

317
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:58,452
Boss, Hwan is with the old man.

318
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:02,755
Could he be dipping into
a different pocket,

319
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:04,793
because you pulled him out?

320
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:09,932
He may feel cornered,
there's nothing he won't do.

321
00:44:26,013 --> 00:44:27,117
Welcome.

322
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,961
The news of Marina sector seeking
private capital will be out soon.

323
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,858
Won't it look great
with a few yachts,

324
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:41,271
and a resort over there?

325
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,098
Sounds very expensive.

326
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:49,839
Business is done not with money,
but with people.

327
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:56,846
Indeed, the chairman's influence
casts a wide net.

328
00:44:58,679 --> 00:44:59,817
Congratulations, sir.

329
00:45:00,547 --> 00:45:01,890
No need for that.

330
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:04,495
I'm still just a front.

331
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:10,962
We must free ourselves from
our sponsors and stand tall.

332
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:12,460
A9 Feed?

333
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,938
Don't lose sleep
over the website.

334
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,784
Can't live forever
on fringes of the law.

335
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:32,415
I know you worked so hard
to relocate the servers.

336
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:36,222
It's fine,
don't fret it sir.

337
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:42,727
If this takes off,
I'm leaving the loan business behind.

338
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:47,199
From here on,

339
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:50,838
these are our future.

340
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:55,341
Very nice.

341
00:45:56,703 --> 00:46:00,913
I need a good sponsor
and stand tall too.

342
00:46:08,615 --> 00:46:10,390
Where were you
in the afternoon?

343
00:46:10,918 --> 00:46:12,693
Kyung-su was looking for you.

344
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:19,803
I had things to take care of.

345
00:46:24,765 --> 00:46:26,005
Yeah?

346
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:43,652
You can't do everything
you desire to do,

347
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:48,256
and become someone you desire.

348
00:46:49,456 --> 00:46:53,336
We all have pre-destined paths.

349
00:46:57,498 --> 00:47:04,746
If you know your place in life,

350
00:47:05,506 --> 00:47:07,543
everything'd be easy.

351
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,480
I guess it's not always so obvious.

352
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:22,030
I hope you still prefer
old man's cock.

353
00:47:58,725 --> 00:47:59,897
Why are you so late?

354
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,981
Did you have a VIP
or something?

355
00:48:18,745 --> 00:48:20,554
Did Sang-ha tell you?

356
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:27,027
All I got is this body...

357
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,296
If they're paying,
what can I not do?

358
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:36,174
Loan without any interest...

359
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,439
Nothing I can't do.

360
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:59,156
Madame Cha's debt...
is significant.

361
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,264
I'll take care of it.

362
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:10,775
So you'll blanket the mop?

363
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:25,685
Transfer Cha's debt to Hwan.

364
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:33,321
Also, spread his
responsibilities to others.

365
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:57,485
Dipshit, if you took out a loan,
have the decency to pay back!

366
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,954
I'll pay back!

367
00:49:59,312 --> 00:50:02,816
Look at this punk ass,
think you're all that?

368
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,594
Afternoon.

369
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:10,892
Don't you know this is my turn?

370
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:12,298
Jong-ho sent us...

371
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:17,338
Get the fuck out of my face.

372
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:33,058
Do you really want me dead?

373
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:41,630
Your interest won't die with you.

374
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:44,433
Hwan!

375
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:51,736
I really hope that I won't see
your blood on my hands.

376
00:51:02,075 --> 00:51:04,910
This 250,000 ha sector includes...

377
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:06,447
So how much?

378
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,420
Of the $201.5 million,
$150 million will be privatized.

379
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:13,129
Who are they negotiating with?

380
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,197
HY and Jeil,
but HY's the front runner.

381
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:20,192
Isn't chairman Kang
in charge of Jeil Marina?

382
00:51:20,193 --> 00:51:21,365
That's correct, sir.

383
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,662
Give him a call.

384
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,607
Right away.

385
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,275
Chairman Kang,
yeah, it's me.

386
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:31,481
I hear you're working on
something fun.

387
00:51:32,405 --> 00:51:35,011
What?
It's no fun?

388
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,785
Should I spice things up?

389
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:46,919
Is it okay to be here
during the day?

390
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,024
Who cares.

391
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,962
I polished
a piece of shit into gold,

392
00:51:52,492 --> 00:51:54,995
but someone else'll reap the benefits,

393
00:51:55,662 --> 00:51:58,165
and I'm reduced to
collecting debts from the feeble.

394
00:51:58,598 --> 00:52:02,136
But that's how you got to
where you are now.

395
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:08,282
This'll make you feel better.

396
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,274
There was only sky
and sea here.

397
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,980
Why's it so messy now?

398
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:19,887
Even a mountain changes
in a decade.

399
00:53:20,413 --> 00:53:22,825
Ocean will surely too.

400
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:53,750
This is rather awkward.

401
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:06,064
You have to leave, sir.

402
00:54:08,028 --> 00:54:10,201
Prepare two matching coffins.

403
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,240
Lead him out of here!

404
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:25,686
What's an abandoned rook
doing on the chessboard?!

405
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,890
Take care of it!

406
00:54:30,984 --> 00:54:31,758
Let go!

407
00:54:35,722 --> 00:54:39,465
Perhaps you took
your job too personally.

408
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:42,096
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb.

409
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:46,302
I was grooming Hwan just fine.

410
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:51,270
I will not allow him to falter
because of you.

411
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:53,046
He's not your fucking mutt!

412
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,225
Cha Yun-su...

413
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:07,427
Madame Cha, I mean.

414
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:13,236
Can you handle it?

415
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:13,097
Take the fucking knife!

416
00:56:17,757 --> 00:56:20,260
Did that whore take
your fucking balls?

417
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,742
Stand down, boy.

418
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,978
You up for this?

419
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,452
Motherfucker!

420
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,754
It's all your own undoing.

421
00:56:43,683 --> 00:56:45,390
Don't you know
what we're here to do?

422
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,263
How could I not?

423
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,930
Kill 'em all!

424
00:58:31,624 --> 00:58:32,864
You fucker...

425
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:48,229
You fucker...

426
01:01:51,924 --> 01:01:53,733
Try to stay awake.

427
01:01:54,527 --> 01:01:58,100
Boss, the cleaning is done.

428
01:01:58,664 --> 01:02:01,941
But Cutter isn't
out of the picture.

429
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:08,145
Yes, sir.

430
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,720
You Okay?

431
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:45,506
<i>The call cannot be connected...</i>

432
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:49,174
<i>Next up, Han Young-su,
a former Red Whales,</i>

433
01:03:49,175 --> 01:03:51,985
<i>has committed suicide.</i>

434
01:03:52,178 --> 01:03:55,780
<i>His bereaved family stated that
he took his own life,</i>

435
01:03:55,781 --> 01:03:58,785
<i>when he was unable to
control his mounting debt.</i>

436
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,344
<i>CEO Jung Sang-ha</i>

437
01:05:28,441 --> 01:05:30,114
<i>Where is the end of this road?</i>

438
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:36,826
<i>How will I look
when I finally reach it?</i>

439
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,800
Here for Madame Cha?

440
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,189
Do you know where she is?

441
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:12,052
She's famous for
ripping men off.

442
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:16,600
She probably got to
several others too.

443
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:27,737
Tonight...

444
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:31,715
could be the end for Jong-ho.

445
01:06:35,808 --> 01:06:37,014
Did you...

446
01:06:39,612 --> 01:06:41,649
Plan it?

447
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,989
Is that what you think too?

448
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:54,566
Don't fuck around,
say it straight!

449
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:55,968
I saw you...

450
01:06:57,063 --> 01:06:58,440
stab him.

451
01:06:58,864 --> 01:07:00,571
Is that what you want
to believe?

452
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,746
Say it again.

453
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:12,453
Go on, slice me.

454
01:07:16,882 --> 01:07:18,020
Slice me open.

455
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:20,064
Goddamn fuck!

456
01:07:30,029 --> 01:07:35,035
Getting stabbed is on par
for our line of work.

457
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:43,313
But I won't tolerate my own
turning his back on me.

458
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:55,499
Stop yapping and go home.

459
01:07:56,689 --> 01:07:58,327
We got work cut out for us.

460
01:08:12,471 --> 01:08:13,643
Off you go.

461
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,760
Sang-ha, my boy-

462
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:00,858
<i>Hwan! Boss is in trouble!</i>

463
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,491
<i>I can't reach Tee-mu.</i>

464
01:09:03,656 --> 01:09:05,363
<i>Remember where we first met?</i>

465
01:10:07,586 --> 01:10:12,092
Looks like Sang-ha raised
a fine minion.

466
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,271
You're Cutter?

467
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:22,977
So disrespectful...

468
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:36,250
Son, kids who don't respect elders

469
01:10:36,348 --> 01:10:38,954
don't live long.

470
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,261
Then come earn my respect.

471
01:11:36,175 --> 01:11:39,054
You should've stayed down.

472
01:13:11,403 --> 01:13:12,814
What will you do?

473
01:13:16,575 --> 01:13:17,952
If I go to hell,

474
01:13:20,112 --> 01:13:24,390
I'll bribe Lucifer
and go to heaven.

475
01:14:04,823 --> 01:14:09,670
Life's full of ironies.

476
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,743
<i>Isn't it funny?</i>

477
01:14:19,271 --> 01:14:23,413
<i>Sang-ha burned you,</i>

478
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:29,458
<i>but you unknowingly worship him.</i>

479
01:14:34,086 --> 01:14:39,195
<i>He's the one
who fucked your life.</i>

480
01:14:40,526 --> 01:14:49,002
You were caught in the trap
he laid out for me.

481
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,917
You pitiful bastard...

482
01:15:23,835 --> 01:15:25,815
Continue working for us.

483
01:15:26,205 --> 01:15:32,815
But up close,
it's a chaotic slaughterhouse.

484
01:15:44,156 --> 01:15:48,662
<i>But I won't tolerate my own
turning his back on me.</i>

485
01:15:52,364 --> 01:15:54,742
Please join me in welcoming

486
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,709
the new CEO of Jeil Marina,

487
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:02,414
who'll lead our ocean industry
to the international stage.

488
01:16:20,392 --> 01:16:24,636
I sincerely thank you all
for attending this grand occasion.

489
01:16:37,109 --> 01:16:42,286
No calling, no moving,
no talking!

490
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:09,504
"If you desire money,
chase the scent."

491
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:12,302
That's what you said to me.

492
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,749
You can't even differentiate
money from blood now?

493
01:19:23,442 --> 01:19:25,080
I'm up for it, sir.

494
01:19:27,746 --> 01:19:29,225
Go on now.

495
01:19:47,065 --> 01:19:49,671
There're already cruise boats
on Han River,

496
01:19:49,968 --> 01:19:52,847
a few more yachts
isn't a big fuss.

497
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,315
I'm dreaming even bigger things.

498
01:19:58,844 --> 01:20:00,289
Looks like...

499
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:04,923
you don't dream very big.

500
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:08,459
It must look petty to politicians.

501
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:14,697
What do money and power
have in common?

502
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:19,773
The one who's holding it
is the master.

503
01:20:21,967 --> 01:20:27,076
You should become
the master of your own domain.

504
01:20:37,949 --> 01:20:40,122
You said so yourself.

505
01:20:40,452 --> 01:20:43,626
"Once you let go of sympathy,
you gain respect."

506
01:20:44,489 --> 01:20:48,631
So why did you pity me?

507
01:20:51,563 --> 01:20:54,134
You must be gravely mistaken.

508
01:20:56,134 --> 01:21:00,742
I... never pitied you.

509
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,191
I don't...

510
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:20,126
even know what sympathy is.

511
01:21:21,092 --> 01:21:22,400
From here on,

512
01:21:22,928 --> 01:21:24,737
I'll only feed on

513
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:28,243
respect.

514
01:21:29,367 --> 01:21:30,471
Hwan.

515
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:33,743
Should you be like this?

516
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:39,279
- Be well.
- They're not...

517
01:21:40,612 --> 01:21:42,956
people we can handle.

518
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:57,260
A rook...

519
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:00,836
leapt out of the chessboard.

520
01:23:02,661 --> 01:23:05,073
Come, sit down.

521
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:42,473
We got an extraordinary relationship.

522
01:23:56,381 --> 01:23:59,726
Endless greed...

523
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:14,034
You tasted money too well.

524
01:24:16,568 --> 01:24:18,878
Your head must be rotten to hell.

525
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:22,149
Cut him slowly,

526
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:24,848
let him feel it.

527
01:25:16,261 --> 01:25:19,504
I need some popcorn.

528
01:25:21,266 --> 01:25:23,974
So many plot twists.

529
01:25:50,094 --> 01:25:51,334
Look over here please!

530
01:25:51,863 --> 01:25:54,366
Did you contribute to
the ruling party's campaign?

531
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:04,113
I had the ledger in front of me.

532
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:05,980
Where is it?

533
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:09,820
I'm dying to know that myself too.

534
01:26:12,383 --> 01:26:14,124
Where could it be?

535
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,492
In any case,
that's the situation we're in.

536
01:26:19,157 --> 01:26:22,627
Take a good rest while at it.

537
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:26,039
Make sure to find out
what happened.

538
01:26:26,998 --> 01:26:31,708
Also, release Sang-ha back out.

539
01:26:33,538 --> 01:26:38,749
This isn't a soccer game,
you don't sub one for another.

540
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,907
I'll setup another game.

541
01:27:07,605 --> 01:27:10,882
You just reset the board.

542
01:27:12,944 --> 01:27:17,689
You're the only king I recognize
on the chessboard.

543
01:27:20,351 --> 01:27:26,996
But I'm the one who controls
the board, even rook.

544
01:27:29,427 --> 01:27:30,997
Don't forget it.

545
01:28:04,495 --> 01:28:08,966
Boss, did you see the old man
on TV yesterday?

546
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:13,840
He looked so frail
and pathetic!

547
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:16,476
How did you work your magic?

548
01:28:23,848 --> 01:28:27,796
Boss, everything's calm now,

549
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,897
why don't you bring her back?

550
01:28:31,155 --> 01:28:32,099
Kyung-SU.

551
01:28:33,591 --> 01:28:41,601
I realized that she never once
came to me first.

552
01:28:43,101 --> 01:28:47,243
I finally understand why.

553
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:56,723
Let's hear the weather forecast.

554
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,526
Yes, boss.

555
01:29:34,185 --> 01:29:36,756
<i>CEO Lee Hwan</i>

556
01:29:42,026 --> 01:29:44,529
Why go to such lengths
for him?

557
01:29:44,896 --> 01:29:49,367
Watching him eat
with his bare hands...

558
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:50,975
was like...

559
01:29:54,939 --> 01:29:56,384
seeing myself.

560
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:05,017
Cutter and I followed
the old man blindly.

561
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:13,629
But Hwan is sitting at
his dinner table.

562
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:18,101
So as a parting gift,

563
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:25,074
I'll give him a spoon.

564
01:31:53,057 --> 01:31:56,231
Take everyone out.

565
01:31:59,397 --> 01:32:02,571
These are the statement
and contract,

566
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,035
everything's here.

567
01:32:08,472 --> 01:32:09,416
Shall we?

568
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:28,802
Could I get a smoke?

569
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:42,514
I said a goddamn smoke!

570
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:24,519
This is all you got?
Get ready.

571
01:37:13,177 --> 01:37:14,417
Hwan,

572
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:17,258
you got a smoke?

573
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,242
You didn't have to do this.

574
01:38:17,841 --> 01:38:18,911
Let go!

575
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,722
Rat fucker...

576
01:38:22,913 --> 01:38:24,620
Send him to his mom.

577
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:33,131
<i>BOY</i>

578
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:35,565
Motherfucker!

579
01:38:35,893 --> 01:38:37,133
Come here, you little shit!

580
01:38:51,475 --> 01:38:53,682
<i>Lee Hwan</i>

581
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:05,489
How did we end up like this?

582
01:39:13,931 --> 01:39:15,740
There's a storm brewing.

583
01:39:17,468 --> 01:39:18,845
Let's go inside...

584
01:39:46,497 --> 01:39:48,272
<i>Could I have stopped it?</i>

585
01:39:51,101 --> 01:39:53,012
<i>When should I have stopped?</i>

586
01:39:57,808 --> 01:39:59,412
<i>The clouds in the sky...</i>

587
01:40:02,513 --> 01:40:04,322
