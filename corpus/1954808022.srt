1
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:59,258
            -This is
 "Dude Bro Party Massacre III."

2
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,826
     -What you doing, buddy?

3
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,795
      You mowing the lawn?

4
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,309
- D-u-u-ude!

5
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,712
          -Br-o-o-o-o!

6
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:57,316
          -P-a-a-arty!

7
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,585
- Massacre!

8
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,588
             -Three.

9
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,556
      Three times this week
      you've been in here,

10
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,826
    and you've yet to tell me
 why you keep saying "massacre."

11
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,361
    -It was just so painful.

12
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,829
    There was so much blood.

13
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,699
            -Brock...

14
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,834
      This is a safe place.

15
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,536
     I need you to open up.

16
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,874
       This is about those
    two previous mass murders

17
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,709
     on Frat Row, isn't it?

18
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:26,211
          I don't know
    if I can talk about that.

19
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,247
          It's just...

20
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:28,914
           so painful.

21
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,749
         Okay. I'll try.

22
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,451
The first party massacre started

23
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:35,487
with a panty raid gone wrong.

24
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,457
    The sorority house mother
           was pissed.

25
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,260
        No one taught her
       how to open doors.

26
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,262
        But she learned.

27
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,298
  And she was out for revenge.

28
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,567
              -Oh!
        Little help, bro?

29
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,802
       Wh-- Wha-- Oh, no!

30
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,704
          -Road Doggie
      was her first victim.

31
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,673
      -Daddy's bro. Ugh...

32
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,276
   -Next, she went after Cindy
          and C-Trunk.

33
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,410
          -Oh, C-Trunk.

34
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,811
          Oh, C-Trunk!

35
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,950
     -What's taking you bros
       so long to shower?!

36
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,618
      -But when she killed
         Coach Handsey,

37
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,853
       I had to wonder...
              -Aah!

38
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:08,787
    -...was she on our side?

39
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,322
          -Good throw.

40
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,456
          -She wasn't!
              -Aah!

41
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,658
             -Whoa!
              -Ohh!

42
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,459
      -She hunted us down!

43
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,630
Frat Row was no longer a street.

44
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,432
       It was...a river...

45
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,267
              -Ohh!
          -...of blood!

46
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,742
   It was the death of Scooter
    that rallied us together.

47
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:34,346
              -Aah!

48
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,848
   -The house mother was dead,
              see?

49
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,885
       And I became a full
         Delta Bi Theta.

50
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,853
    But little did we know...

51
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,323
     mother had a daughter.

52
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,428
      Anyway, junior year,
      we raged even harder.

53
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,332
       We thought we were
       gonna live forever.

54
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,366
        -And then fire...

55
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,601
         -We were wrong.

56
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,502
         -Could you hold
       my hair back, bro?

57
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,005
    -Someone took her place.

58
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,876
           Motherface.

59
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,647
    The junior-year streaking
     contest was under way.

60
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:09,948
  I was supposed to officiate,

61
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,384
        but I couldn't go
     because I got pink eye.

62
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,988
      That fart on my face
         saved my life.

63
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,631
     Too bad I couldn't say
  the same for Jimmy Galoshes.

64
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,773
         No one was safe
        from her wrath...

65
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,575
        -Yeah. "Areolas."
        Gonna masturbate.

66
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,809
   -...not even Little Spoon.

67
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,645
              -Aah.

68
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,648
      -Not Timmy and Tommy,
      the Birdstone twins.

69
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,686
    -Look, babe -- no hands!

70
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,622
       Not concert pianist
         Chaz Noodlemen.

71
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,556
         -Aah! Aah! Aah!

72
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,725
           -Aah! Aah!

73
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,297
   -Not even our weed dealer.

74
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,065
        There was no way
    to deal with the stress.

75
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,934
             -Aaaah!

76
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,003
    -Randall went on to have
           three kids.

77
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,672
         He seems happy.
   I'm actually grabbing lunch

78
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:07,839
       with him tomorrow.

79
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,710
  But then she killed Dolphman.

80
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,446
    It was Delta Bi genocide.

81
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,814
         But in the end,

82
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,450
    thanks to our good looks
    and bond of brotherhood,

83
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,987
          the Delta Bis
      triumphed once more.

84
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,657
    -Looks like your flame...
            retarded.

85
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,560
       -I projected an air
    of cool, calm confidence,

86
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,995
   'cause I'm Brock, you know?

87
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,730
  But something in her eyes --

88
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:35,100
 something told me that nothing
     could stop Motherface.

89
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,004
     ...not even the grave.

90
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,840
             -Brock!

91
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,376
        The serial killer
  known as Motherface is dead.

92
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,478
           You told me
    you killed her yourself.

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,380
 It's time you take your life...

94
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,683
            ...back.

95
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,352
           -Thank God
      my twin brother Brent

96
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,054
       didn't want to get
  involved in the Greek system.

97
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,056
     We used to be so close.

98
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,624
   We haven't talked that much
          since we went

99
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,861
     to different colleges,
         but I still...

100
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,830
           feel him...

101
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,798
  like we have some sort of...

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,634
    psychological connection.

103
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:14,005
  -Brock, I need you to tell me
   what you're most afraid of.

104
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,775
   -Besides seeing all my bros
   killed before my very eyes?

105
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:17,909
       -Yes, besides that.

106
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,946
   Please, tell me everything.

107
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,714
         -I don't know.

108
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,716
        After watching 17
       of my best friends

109
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,452
 get killed by some crazy lady,

110
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,422
    I guess you could say I'm
  a little bit afraid of women.

111
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,690
    -Well, then it looks like
       we're gonna have to

112
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,558
     cut this session short.

113
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,127
        -Oh, I thought we
   were making good progress.

114
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,962
             Really?
      What are you doing?!

115
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,622
  -Aah! Damn it, Brock Chirino,
            you punk!

116
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,023
    You're gonna kill someone
        with that thing!

117
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,727
              -No.
  Ernest, that's Brent Chirino,

118
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,095
      Brock's twin brother.

119
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,797
       He transferred here
     after Brock was killed

120
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:15,600
 in that brutal freak accident.
              -Oh.

121
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,770
    You know I've been trying
to work on my temper, Sebastian.

122
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,906
     Brock was the coolest.

123
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,080
           -Hey, there
  goes that sexy Brent Chirino.

124
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,882
 Too bad his twin brother died.

125
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,784
        I would've loved
      to have been the meat

126
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,486
    in that Chirino sandwich.

127
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,455
         -Yeah, at least
      Brock wore a helmet!

128
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,857
   I'm looking at you, Brent!

129
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,659
   If you're hiding any drugs
    in your butthole, missy,

130
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,595
        I swear to God...

131
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,100
            -Brent...

132
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,136
           -Look out!

133
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,471
             -Brent.

134
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,206
      -There's still time!

135
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,542
              -Unh!

136
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,184
 You really threw me for a loop.

137
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,820
  I was on the edge of my seat.

138
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,624
   Say, aren't you that fella
whose cool brother was murdered?

139
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,758
           -Whatever.

140
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,494
 I don't want to talk about it.

141
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,028
     -Well, name's Nedry --

142
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,263
        Nedry Headcheese.

143
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,531
           -Chirino --

144
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,966
         <i> Brent</i> Chirino.

145
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,801
      -I think you'll find
      I have a lot to offer

146
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,236
        as a best friend.

147
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,972
         -Whatever, man.
  I'm not here to make friends.

148
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,574
      I'm here to find out
     who murdered my brother

149
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,910
        and get revenge.

150
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,112
    -Say, isn't this the frat

151
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,181
      your murdered brother
          belonged to?

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,787
 Maybe we could pledge together,

153
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,690
      find out what<i> really</i>
    happened to your brother.

154
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,558
       I always thought...

155
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,559
       -I promised myself

156
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,928
I would never join a fraternity.

157
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,030
   I already had one brother.

158
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:56,668
I don't need any other brothers.

159
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,670
        -And that's why,
  even though a pack of wolves

160
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,971
    took the use of my legs,

161
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,074
       I decided to become
        a zoology major.

162
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,710
         My whole family
  was once murdered by wolves.

163
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,617
      -Well, well, well...

164
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,086
   If it isn't Brock Chirino,
       back from the dead.

165
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:19,691
           -Actually,
I'm Brock's twin brother, Brent.

166
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,160
             -Weird.

167
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,695
   Hey, you looking to pledge?

168
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,564
        Great to have you
        aboard Delta Bi.

169
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,998
            -Oh, I --
            -But I --

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,300
     I understand, you know?

171
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,334
   If you need some more time
           to get over

172
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,836
 your brother's tragic death...

173
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,238
              -No.

174
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,773
       I'm done grieving.

175
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,909
       I'm ready to party
    until my pants fall off.

176
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,046
   -Welcome to Delta Bi Theta.

177
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,014
    I think you're gonna fit
     right in with the guys.

178
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,250
 I'm Derek. I'm the friendliest
      guy you'll meet here.

179
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,585
    -Shut the fuck up, Derek!

180
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,853
      -Nice comeback, bro.

181
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,622
     Don't mind the camera.
           That's Z.Q.

182
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,258
You should see the workout tapes
      he makes of us bros.

183
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,127
    They're very...artistic.

184
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,597
              -Hi.
             -Hello.

185
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,765
            -Come on.
        Let's go inside.

186
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,979
      -Siskel and Ebert say
         "Pizza Goblins"

187
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,246
       is "family magic."

188
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,982
     "Two thumbs way down."

189
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,218
          -Dragons fr--

190
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,823
      -Welcome to Delta Bi.

191
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,026
           You'll see
that the party never stops here.

192
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,929
          That's Spike.
 He rages harder than any of us.

193
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,165
         Classic Spike.

194
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,634
     That there is Sizzler.

195
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,002
 He's trying to pledge Delta Bi,

196
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,371
       but he won't get in
    'cause he's a vegetarian.

197
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,338
             -What?

198
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,911
      -This here is Samzy.

199
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,813
          He has a lot
  of memories of your brother.

200
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,324
   -I made them just like you
  like them, Samzy -- overhard.

201
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,160
- Pretty nice.
-       Overhard.

202
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,262
        Like you, Samzy.

203
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,764
             -Sorry.

204
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,932
    Samzy's a bit of a bitch.

205
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:11,036
     -Oh. That explains it.

206
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,144
         -This is Todd.

207
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,212
    We call him T-O-Double-D
           for short.

208
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,148
          He's pre-med.
    Smartest guy in the frat.

209
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,182
              -Ohh!

210
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,717
     Jesus, Derek, not now!

211
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,452
     I got a lot on my mind.

212
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,320
       Look at all my work
         that I'm doing.

213
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,823
    With midterms and finals
      for everyone, what...

214
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,095
             Brock?
  -Oh, this is actually Brent,

215
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,364
      Brock's twin brother.

216
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,331
             -Weird.

217
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,934
           -Surprise!
              -No!

218
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,873
              -Ugh!
    Samantha, what the fuck?!

219
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,844
   -That's Todd's girlfriend,
            Samantha.

220
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,914
She's a psych major, which means
      she's a total psycho.

221
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,782
       But, uh, you know,
     she owns a motor home,

222
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,084
          so it's cool.
              -Oh.

223
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,119
      -Babe, you can't keep
         coming in here,

224
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,821
    bringing delicious treats
             for me.

225
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,956
 -But you deserve a treat, Todd!

226
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,357
 Just a little bit of pampering

227
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,160
   before our big anniversary
         getaway weekend

228
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,896
     in old-town Sacramento.

229
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,833
- I guess I do deserve a treat.

230
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,434
            -Mm-hmm.

231
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,036
 -But they're over on the floor.

232
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,750
  -Sorry I tossed your cookies
           back there.

233
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,084
          -That's okay.
         I'm used to it.

234
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,353
       -What do you mean?

235
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,422
       -I've always wanted
        to be a Delta Bi.

236
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,058
   -Be one of these guys? Why?

237
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,894
  -Delta Bi is the coolest frat
            in Chico,

238
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,429
         but I'm a girl,

239
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,432
     so I could never join,
    even though I'm a legacy.

240
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,300
           -Listen...

241
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,771
             I know
  what it's like to not belong.

242
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,172
             -Brent!

243
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,074
       -I'm coming, guys!

244
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,342
           I'm coming!

245
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,843
       All right, I came.

246
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,312
   -Some pretty sweet tai chi
           back there.

247
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,047
     Knew you'd fit in here.

248
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,183
   -But I never knew tai chi.

249
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:09,120
  My dead brother knew tai chi.

250
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,188
           -You okay?

251
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,456
             -Sure.

252
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,892
  Uh, where's Brock's old room?

253
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,231
             -Yeah.

254
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:40,251
 -And the winner for best dancer
     at prom, Brent Chirino!

255
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,122
              -Ugh!
        This is my room!

256
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:47,525
 I called dibs on this room like
  two minutes after Brock died!

257
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,894
              Shit!

258
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,095
   You got to get out of here!

259
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,931
     I got to haze a pledge
           right now.

260
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,866
       -This is Turbeaux.
         -I'm Turbeaux.

261
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,168
              Shit!
        Pinch me, pledge.

262
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,304
               Oh!
        Pinch me harder!

263
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,306
              Aah!
     Guess I'm not dreaming.

264
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,540
   Brock told me about you --

265
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,475
             little
   Brenty Brent Brent Chirino.

266
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,845
              Hmm!
He said you're a bit of a loner.

267
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,848
      -Actually, Turbeaux,
Brent's thinking about pledging.

268
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,516
          -Oh, really?!

269
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,518
 You want to get into this frat?

270
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,420
 You want to learn our secrets?

271
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,021
   You got to get through me.

272
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,090
            Sizzler!

273
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,960
     Or maybe you don't have
 what it takes to be a Delta Bi.

274
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:22,994
           -Do or die!

275
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,362
  -You think you can handle...

276
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,964
             this?!
              -Aah!

277
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,499
-You<i> think</i> you can handle this?!

278
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,367
              -Ohh!

279
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,969
          -You think...

280
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,471
      you can handle this?

281
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,339
              -Aah!

282
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,473
             -This?
              -Aah!

283
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,641
             -This?

284
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,443
              -Ohh!
             -This?

285
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,878
     -Aah! Aah! Aah! Aahn=!

286
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,614
-You think you can handle this?!

287
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,315
        Do you...think...

288
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:48,219
  you...can... handle...this?!

289
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,654
    Watch me not give a shit!

290
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,356
            Sizzler!
              -Ohh!

291
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,191
    -I don't care about you!

292
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,059
          I don't care
      where you came from!

293
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,161
  Your ancestors mean nothing!

294
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,899
  You bring shame to all of us!

295
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,166
           -Yes, sir.

296
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,335
           -Actually,
    Brent was thinking about

297
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,337
         helping us out
     with our senior prank.

298
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,909
          -Oh, really?

299
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,445
        Well, our pranks
    are pretty goddamn wild.

300
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,481
        This year's gonna
        be no different.

301
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,316
        Gonna be bonkers!

302
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,085
  We're gonna need a real party
   boy to pull off this prank.

303
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,454
          Is that you?

304
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,923
     You daddy's party boy?

305
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,424
              -Yes.

306
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,060
          -Look at you.
   You'll never be a Delta Bi.

307
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,462
     I'm gonna whup your ass
     with my big paddle now.

308
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,697
       It's in my closet.

309
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,169
            Aaaaaah!

310
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,205
- Oh, man!

311
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,573
              -God!
       -I think I captured

312
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:43,675
    some genuine fear there.

313
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,109
           -God, guys!

314
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,211
       You know how I feel
        about baby dogs!

315
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,680
              -Oh!
       We got you so good!

316
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:52,383
   -Get the fuck out of here,
            Samantha!

317
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,251
             -Why?!

318
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,353
        God, guys! Guys!

319
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,956
      -I got this for Brock
     for his 16th birthday.

320
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,492
It looks just like our childhood
        dog, Dr. Bagels.

321
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,594
     -To me -- to Turbeaux!
              -Ha!

322
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,996
          -To your bro!

323
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,298
      -But I need Turbeaux
          to trust me.

324
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,001
      -I hate puppies, too!

325
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,170
              Unh!

326
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,572
            -Really?

327
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,976
 Maybe you are okay, Not Brock.

328
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,311
       Maybe you are okay.

329
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,382
  Hey, Sizzler, get the window.
   Z.Q., shut that camera off.

330
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,650
             Brent,
 think about spending the night

331
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,085
           in my room
     once I'm all moved in.

332
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,419
         Let's check out
       these prank plans.

333
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,691
              -Oh.
 First, we're gonna need these.

334
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,994
          -That's tape.

335
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,329
             -Whoo!

336
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,698
            Goddamn!

337
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,501
      -They gave us so much
       of that beer stuff.

338
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,236
        I have the spins.

339
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,671
  I can't even read this sign.

340
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,106
       -Calm down, Nedry!

341
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,741
According to these plank prints,

342
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:53,511
    it says the college radio
   station is right up there.

343
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,414
          So, remember,
     when we get on the air,

344
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,715
        you're gonna say,

345
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:01,786
 "Dean Pepperstone eats farts,"
              okay?

346
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,554
 And be sure not to mess it up,

347
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,690
      'cause I have to get
         into this frat

348
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:10,128
to find out who was the murderer
         to my brother.

349
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,196
 -Whatever you say, best friend!

350
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,599
- They murdered my brother!

351
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,769
          -Chico Tower,
   this is Pan Am flight 912,

352
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,604
 requesting permission to land.

353
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:23,574
             -Okay!
  Dean Pepperstone eats farts!

354
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,176
        -Dean Pepperst--

355
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,677
         Listen, this is
   air-traffic control tower.

356
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,046
     Get off this frequency!

357
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,647
  -You get off this frequency.

358
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,315
         -I am a pilot.
     I have a plane to land!

359
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,618
        I'm gonna crash!
  -Dean Pepperstone eats farts!

360
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,087
     -Oh, God, I'm so sorry!

361
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:46,664
      -You Delta Bi Thetas
 have done it for the last time!

362
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,133
     You killed 250 people,

363
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,335
     and I do not eat farts.

364
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,137
  -Listen, you need to give us
        a second chance.

365
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,739
 -I've given you enough chances!

366
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,442
        Need I remind you
      of last year's prank,

367
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,143
  when you broke the county dam

368
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:03,214
   and submerged Ol' Parchtown
            in water?

369
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,149
 -But we created New Lake City.

370
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,784
   -You drowned 4,000 people.

371
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,220
    -The paddle-boat business
        is booming there.

372
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,723
    -Don't make me remind you
    of sophomore-year prank.

373
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,295
-Sophomores, get to the chopper!

374
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,497
         We are leaving!

375
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,399
 Sophomores, get to the chopper!

376
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,700
        -That's not fair!

377
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,535
      Freshman-year prank,
       let me remind you,

378
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,237
          we helped...

379
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,506
    depose a Central American
            dictator.

380
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:31,742
- That's true.
Your heavy-metal hot-air balloon

381
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:35,246
    did drive General Cortez
   from the Brazilian embassy,

382
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:38,116
            which is
  why I'm only suspending you.

383
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,383
      -During Greek Week?!

384
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,219
     What's wrong with you?!

385
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,887
            -Come on!
    It's like Easter for men!

386
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,856
          -You can have
       your own Greek Week

387
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,425
out at the old sorority house...

388
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,827
          by the lake.
           -What? Ugh!

389
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,729
       -They never pick up
         their dog shit!

390
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,764
         -It's haunted!
              -No!

391
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,302
       -Go there, brother.

392
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,573
  -Guys, a weekend at the lake?

393
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,475
     That's nothing, right?

394
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:09,147
       It'll be like a --
     like a Dude Bro party!

395
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,781
          -Yeah. Okay.

396
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,183
             -Yeah.

397
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,751
        A Dude Bro party.

398
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,653
And maybe you could invite some,

399
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,690
       uh, young, nubile,
    recently divorced women?

400
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,526
              -No!
              -No!

401
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,527
           -Bullshit!

402
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,828
            -Come on!
        No girls allowed!

403
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,296
      -Fine! Fine! Get out!

404
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,465
      Get out, all of you!

405
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,833
       -Somebody help me!

406
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,735
      -Should I lock this?

407
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,643
           -It's done.

408
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,311
           -Excellent.

409
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:45,716
       Soon, the Dude Bros
   will taste their own blood.

410
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:52,356
     All that's required now
     is a virgin sacrifice.

411
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,559
       Virgo sacrificium.

412
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,327
           -Yes, yes.
        Virgo Sacramento.

413
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:00,431
            Whatever.
       -Virgo sacrificium.

414
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,401
       Virgo sacrificium.

415
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,535
              -No!

416
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,303
               No!

417
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,305
            Aah! Ohh!

418
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,239
              Aah!

419
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,674
              Aah!

420
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:13,744
       -Virgo sacrificium!

421
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,582
 -I'm an immortal fuck machine!

422
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,352
     -Buttiker, get in here!

423
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,722
             -Uh-oh!
      Someone's in trouble!

424
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,494
          -Yes, Chief.
     -Ah. Candace Buttiker.

425
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,563
       First in your class
        at Naval Academy,

426
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,898
      in Valencia, Florida.

427
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,833
        Are you ready for
          a real-world

428
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,501
      Chico police mission?

429
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,703
        -Oh, daddy like!

430
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,271
   -What have you got for me,
             Chief?

431
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,273
      -Motherface is rising
       on the harvest moon

432
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,408
     to kill the Delta Bis,

433
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,845
     but her plan won't work
   without a virgin sacrifice.

434
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,748
     That's where that idiot
     virgin Sminkle comes in

435
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,817
      -Aah! Fuck! My face!

436
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,953
      -You want me to send
  Officer Sminkle to his death.

437
00:20:55,955 --> 00:21:01,459
    -You see, only his death
 will give Motherface the power

438
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:05,529
     to defeat the Delta Bis
    when it matters the most.

439
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,633
-And, um, what would you like me
          to tell him?

440
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,502
- Watch this.

441
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,440
      Sminkle, get in here!

442
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,676
   -Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
   oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

443
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:19,844
       Aw, come on, Chief!

444
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,345
 I thought we talked about this.

445
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,949
        No girls allowed
        in the Dude Room.

446
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,487
       I'm fine. Ah-choo!

447
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,389
              -Aah!
         What the hell?!

448
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,890
          -Sminkle, um,

449
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,426
   I have kind of an important
    assignment for you, if --

450
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:36,827
 if you think you're up for it.

451
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,430
          -Oh, my gosh.
         Oh, absolutely.

452
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:42,033
     Wait a second, though.
   Don't -- don't you hate me?

453
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,402
      'Cause you called me
     a cum bubble yesterday.

454
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,370
-Well, the way you got that girl
           to confess

455
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:49,073
       that she was hiding
  those drugs in her butthole,

456
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,641
   that was pretty impressive.

457
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,977
          And I'd like
  to kind of give you a reward.

458
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,447
     You know about Chico's
 orange-shortage problem, right?

459
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,649
            -Oh, yes.
   It's very terrible, Chief.

460
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,552
   City-wide vitamin-C levels
     have never been lower.

461
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,622
           -Well, uh,
   turns out your old friends

462
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:09,727
       the Dude Bros are,
          in reality...

463
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,363
        bags of oranges.

464
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,868
       -I should've known.

465
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,872
   -So, what I need you to do
          is find them,

466
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,541
      bop them on the nose,

467
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,043
       and turn them back
    into their actual forms,

468
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,678
    which as I said earlier,

469
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,382
      are bags of oranges.

470
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,983
     Save our city, Sminkle.

471
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,653
        Officer Buttiker
       will accompany you

472
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:40,891
to bop the Dude Bros on the nose

473
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:49,533
     and turn them back into
    bags of fucking oranges.

474
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,436
 -Got it! You won't regret this,
         Chief-a-rooney!

475
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,606
   -See? Now Officer Sminkle's
            Spazwagon

476
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,408
        is all gassed up.

477
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,511
  The Dude Bros are at the old
   sorority house by the lake.

478
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,847
          And get there
    before the harvest moon.

479
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,749
  The town is depending on you.

480
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,593
         -Come on, guys!

481
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:19,730
  Let's get some tunes in here!

482
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,000
    -What the shit is this?!

483
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,135
          -Yeah, Todd.

484
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:27,071
     What<i> is</i> all this about?

485
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,641
 -Flowers, the music, champagne,

486
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,710
 that banner I refuse to read...

487
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,813
   -Guys, Samantha loves you,

488
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:39,650
    and she wants us to have
    a good time by the lake.

489
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,960
              -Aah!

490
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,196
      -Hey, Todd, Samantha
    take your virginity yet?

491
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,697
            -Not yet.

492
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,200
  She's been really pushing me,
             though.

493
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:58,102
 And I'm not ready to be a dad.

494
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,604
    -Guys, there's baby stuff
          in here! Gah!

495
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,573
    -Hey! No! No baby stuff!

496
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,108
          -Baby hats...
      -Put that stuff back!

497
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,011
           No babies!
   -No, Todd, we're Americans!

498
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:10,748
   We can do whatever we want
      with no consequences!

499
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,983
  -No consequences in America!

500
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,052
       -A toast to Brent.

501
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,854
              -Boo!

502
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:19,957
   -Hey, now, pour that pledge
  a pint of Prosecco, partner.

503
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,993
  Chirino perfectly pulled off
        our senior prank.

504
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,830
    We wanted the whole world
  to know that Dean Pepperstone

505
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,064
           eats farts.
           -Thank you.

506
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,933
          -And I think
      they got the message.

507
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,968
        -Speech! Speech!
           Right now!

508
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,803
             -Um...

509
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,172
 I guess I just want to say, uh,

510
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:42,480
    I can see why my brother
   was so stoked on you guys.

511
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,582
              Um...

512
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:47,251
           and, uh...

513
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,022
            Titties.

514
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,224
             -Yeah!

515
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:54,492
              Yeah!
           -All right.

516
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,259
             -Yeah!
             -Whoo!

517
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,194
             -Yeah!

518
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,797
     -Yes! Oh, my favorite!

519
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,701
             -Yeah!
 -Forever's gonna start tonight!

520
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:06,537
      -Delta Bi! Do or die!
           -It speaks!

521
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,973
      -Delta Bi! Do or die!

522
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,542
      Delta Bi! Do or die!

523
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,177
      Delta Bi! Do or die!

524
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,613
      Delta Bi! Do or die!

525
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:20,050
      -Delta Bi! Do or die!
      Delta Bi! Do or die!

526
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,254
      -How are we gonna get
        across this lake?

527
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:35,199
  -Well, that's enough footage
            of that.

528
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,801
       Someone want to get
         his attention?

529
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:38,802
        -Come on, pledge.

530
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:39,937
    I'm over this tear shit.

531
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,071
   Go get us some paddy boats.

532
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,172
            Come on!

533
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,679
        -Uh...Uh, hello?

534
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:49,947
            -Go away!

535
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:52,082
          Can't you see
     I'm mourning the dea--

536
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,299
               Oh.

537
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:12,303
              Hey!
         The Delta Bis!

538
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,572
     I was just celebrating
         the anniversary

539
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:18,008
         of my business
    finally taking off, huh?

540
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,111
         I have you boys
       to thank for that.

541
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,216
        Stand over there,
     next to my dead family!

542
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,952
            Come on.
              Yep.

543
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:31,055
      Nobody wanted to rent
 a paddy boat in Ol' Parchtown.

544
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,290
     I was swimming in debt.

545
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,225
 Until you boys flooded the town

546
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,361
  and drowned my whole family,
            that is.

547
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:40,331
    Now business is booming!

548
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,267
    Go ahead -- put your arm
         around my wife.

549
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,036
My beautiful wife!

550
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,273
 She died doing what she loved.

551
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,609
           -Drowning?
             -Yeah.

552
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,143
         Not much reason
      for swimming lessons

553
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,912
 if you lived in Ol' Parchtown,

554
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:59,016
   which is what made it such
   a particularly funny prank.

555
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:06,056
   -Now let's do a goofy one!

556
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,726
      I said make it goofy!

557
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,406
     That's a great picture.

558
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:25,809
            Oh, man,
    that's my baby boy, too.

559
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,980
  16 months old when the water
         took him away.

560
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,316
     You guys still got it!

561
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,652
    Pranksters till the end!

562
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,021
        The bitter...end.

563
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,224
      You boys want to rent
          a paddy boat?

564
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:45,829
         What paddy boat
  are you gonna choose, Brock?

565
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,799
           -I'm Brent.
        -Okay. All right.

566
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:51,201
 -I trust that you have a paddy
   boat that will accommodate

567
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,269
          my lifestyle.
              -No.

568
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,404
              -Oh.

569
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:56,073
    -If I remember correctly,
            and I do,

570
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,308
 there's a handicap paddle boat
    about 20 miles that way.

571
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,011
             -Yeah!
        Fuck off, Nerdry!

572
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,413
    -Don't tell me to F off!

573
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:04,214
           I'll F you
 if you don't come back for me!

574
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,950
          -Whoa, whoa!
        Nerdry, come on.

575
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,018
     You're in college now.

576
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,420
       You can say "fuck."

577
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:11,388
         Give it a try.

578
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,758
         -F-f-f-f-f-f...

579
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,694
        F-f-f-f-f-f-fu--

580
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:19,763
    You won't leave me here,
            will you?

581
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,199
     -I got to go with them.
         You understand.

582
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,801
              Here.

583
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:26,103
     In case your wheelchair
          breaks down.

584
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,237
          -Uh, thanks.

585
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,972
          Radical deck.

586
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,809
   Well, see you there, Brent.

587
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,877
     Don't forget to avenge
     your murdered brother!

588
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,280
             -Okay!
        One more picture!

589
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:37,481
        And surprise me!

590
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,016
  Like when you blew up the dam

591
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,885
        and took everyone
        I knew and loved!

592
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,062
    -Well, they don't call me
    Ol' Iron Arms Headcheese

593
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,097
          for nothing.

594
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,732
       Just 20 more miles,

595
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,400
 and I'll have an ice-cold brew
         waiting for me.

596
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,770
               Ha!

597
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:02,272
        Oh, monkey butts.

598
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,342
      Is it so pooping hard
        to load a legacy

599
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,278
 into a -- a whore paddle boat?!

600
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,346
           That's it.

601
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,248
        I'm gonna say it.

602
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,383
     F-f-f-fuck this creek!

603
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,087
        Those dick farts
 never gave two shitting bitches

604
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,455
      about Ol' Iron Arms.

605
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,157
          They'll see.

606
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,026
     I'll show those vagina
       faces what's what.

607
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:27,264
  Those Delta Bi titty jizzers
will regret the day they were --

608
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,866
Guys?

609
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,203
              Help.

610
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,036
       -My psychic told me
   my son's head would cave in

611
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,137
      from a car accident,

612
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,006
     and hello, prom night.

613
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,579
   -And the number-one reason

614
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:19,583
          men and women
     just can't get along...

615
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,819
       The remote control!

616
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,086
   What do you think, Candace?

617
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,822
     Think Letterman will go
        for these lists?

618
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,490
   -I'm not here to humor you,
            Sminkle.

619
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,960
    -Top 10 reasons Letterman
 will go for these Top 10 lists.

620
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:33,263
           Number 10,
    my boundless enthusiasm.

621
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,165
    -32 more hours, Candace.

622
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,035
       -Number 9, that man
    is slapping a little boy.

623
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,303
             -What?
          -That man is

624
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:41,038
     slapping a little boy!
          -Oh, my God!

625
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,439
-You think you're cooler than me

626
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:45,876
       just 'cause you got
     a fancy tie and a job?!

627
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:48,545
             -Yaaah!

628
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,547
         Here's $100 and
   "The Grapes of Wrath," kid!

629
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,249
        Get out of town!
        Change your name!

630
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,851
 Start a new life for yourself!

631
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,053
     Keep going! Keep going!
         You can do it!

632
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,856
 And once you get into the trees
         for the night,

633
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:01,225
       I want you to read
       that fucking book!

634
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,629
-That was, uh, pretty impressive
      how you handled that.

635
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,632
          -Yeah, well,
 every child deserves a chance.

636
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,035
           -Aaaaaaah!

637
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,503
        -I love children.

638
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,472
   They're the future that we
    screwed up for ourselves,

639
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:18,408
            you know?
          So innocent.

640
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,345
 I guess you probably don't care
     about this crazy dream

641
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,213
     that I have, but, uh...

642
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,285
        I want to open up
 a mobile library for children.

643
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:30,287
            -Really?
    -You see, the first time

644
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:33,090
         I read a book,
       my mind went bang!

645
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,559
         Like, anything
  in the universe was possible,

646
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,161
        and I could find
 it all in the pages of a book.

647
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,430
           And, well,
    that's what I want to do

648
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,566
 for all the children of Chico.

649
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,002
  I just want to bang them all.

650
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,172
             -Um...
       -I'm gonna call it

651
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,308
  Sminkle's Bang Bus, Candace.

652
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,912
  No more waiting in the public
library to bang every kid I see.

653
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,381
  No, sir, I'm going to travel
      from block to block,

654
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:59,249
screaming out my window for kids

655
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,653
     to climb aboard my bus
      and get banged silly.

656
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,688
            -I mean,
your heart's in the right place,

657
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,258
but, um, how about "bookmobile"?

658
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,127
             -Yeah?
   -Not gonna lie, Candace --

659
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:13,063
    that sounds real boring.

660
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:16,166
 I would not want to get banged
        in a bookmobile.

661
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,169
          My bang bus.
            -Oh, no!

662
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,971
         Oh, no, no, no!
          -My bang bus!

663
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,139
            My dream!

664
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,610
            -Sminkle!

665
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,178
            -Aw, man!

666
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,381
        Why does it have
   to not be a person anymore?

667
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,382
              -Ugh.

668
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:44,728
          -There it is.

669
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,030
     The old sorority house
          by the lake.

670
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,084
      -Damn it! This place
     is a fucking shit-hole!

671
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,518
         Who did this?!

672
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,287
              -Aah!

673
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:16,693
       -Someone -- someone
   else somewhere is in here.

674
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,209
     -Relax, bros! It's me!
           -Rip Stick!

675
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,678
     -Thought you'd rock out
  on the lake without me, yeah?

676
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,147
      -We thought you died
         in the embassy.

677
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:45,555
  -Part of me did die that day.

678
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,024
        But now I'm back!

679
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,692
      Rippin' and stickin'!

680
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,500
 And I see I'm not the only one
   back from the dead, Brock.

681
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:58,035
         -Brock did die.

682
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,304
 That's his twin brother, Brent.

683
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:02,672
             -Weird.

684
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,775
        Well, let's clean
      this stupid shit-hole

685
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,309
    up so we can party, eh?!

686
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,544
             -Yeah!

687
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,479
           -All right!

688
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,119
- Hey!

689
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,196
     -This is more like it,
           huh, guys?

690
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,700
             -Okay.
       Now start partying.

691
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,706
             -Yeah!

692
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,416
          -Oh! No, no!
      It's happening again!

693
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,618
             Again!
      It's happening again!

694
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,319
     -What is your problem,
             Samzy?!

695
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,155
    -Yeah, chill out, Samzy!

696
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,556
      -Self-righteous fuck!

697
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,658
 -Samzy, you need to chill out,
           all right?

698
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,828
    This is just an old house
      with old fuses, bro.

699
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,896
           -Old fuses.

700
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:07,697
  -That's what I said -- fuses.

701
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,232
        -Old fuses, huh?

702
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,801
 -They are fuses, motherfucker!
           -It's old!

703
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,670
  -The fuse box is in the shed,

704
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,338
    if I remember correctly.

705
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,541
   -Derek, you know how to be
    a handyman from your dad.

706
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,176
          Go out there.
          -I told you,

707
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,744
      I hate handyman work.

708
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:23,613
  -You never told me that, bro.
     You never told me that.

709
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,249
   I would have not said that
if you had told me that earlier.

710
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,763
          I'm so sorry.

711
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,432
       -Here goes nothing.

712
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,643
        All right, Derek,
        you can do this.

713
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,845
       You've been working
    with a therapist on this.

714
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,547
         You can do it.

715
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,883
       They're just tools.

716
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,352
    They're all just a bunch
            of tools.

717
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,824
             Oh, no!

718
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:25,542
   All just a bunch of tools.

719
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,891
          Aha. Gotcha.

720
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,662
             Aaaah!

721
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,797
       -Hoes before bros!

722
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,935
- Derek did it!

723
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,603
        The electricity!

724
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,015
      -Come dance with us.

725
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:07,751
   -Brent, go dance with them.
               Go.

726
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:09,619
           Go, go, go.

727
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:13,556
           -D-a-ance?

728
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:14,958
          With someone?

729
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,994
        I did that once.

730
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,970
     -There you are, Brent.

731
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,438
       What are you doing?

732
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,441
  Prom limo's waiting outside.
             -Whoo!

733
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,842
       -I'm scared, Brock.

734
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,778
   I've never been with a girl
            before...

735
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,414
          dancing-wise.

736
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,882
             You...

737
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,717
      You weren't supposed
          to see this.

738
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,453
   -Dancing is easy, Brent --

739
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,988
  if you have a plan, that is.

740
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,723
              Here.

741
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:48,558
        Let me show you.

742
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,731
    Follow the natural rhythm
          of the music.

743
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:57,467
  Ease into her smooth curves.

744
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,636
  The body wants what it wants.

745
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:00,870
    -I think I'm getting it!

746
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,540
           -Dancing is
     like tai-chi fighting.

747
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,976
 It's all about the transference
           of energy.

748
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,546
      Just use her inertia
          against her.

749
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:10,613
         That's it now.

750
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,949
             Whoooa!

751
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,752
              -Oh.

752
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,620
 -Oh, and first thing tomorrow,

753
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:20,523
     we're gonna return that
 mannequin to T.J. Maxx, buddy.

754
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,691
           -All right.

755
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,994
           Oh, Brock,
       what am I gonna do

756
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,863
         when you go off
        to East Chico U.?

757
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,099
 -Hey, you'll make some friends
          of your own.

758
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:31,368
  -But everybody sucks but us.

759
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,969
 -Remember what I always say --

760
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,404
       when you face a foe

761
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:36,072
          you're afraid
       you can't defeat --

762
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,507
             Murder!

763
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:41,711
         Aahhhhhhhhhhh!

764
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,114
         -Aah! Aah! Aah!

765
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:45,582
              Aah!

766
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,884
              Aah!

767
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,053
         It's horrible!

768
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,521
         Someone killed!

769
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:52,689
    -What's going on, Spike?

770
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:53,790
 -Spike, tell us what happened!

771
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,925
       -Someone killed...

772
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,161
          all the beer!

773
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,098
          -This can...

774
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,500
           Shotgunned.

775
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:05,101
             -Why?!

776
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,837
   Who would do such a thing?!

777
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,672
          -Did you know
      about his worst fear?

778
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:10,707
      -Running out of beer?

779
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:11,775
   -I think it's pretty clear.

780
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:14,744
    -We'll get to the bottom
            of this.

781
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,814
         But right now,
     beer run, pledge, now!

782
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:18,715
     -I'll take the pledge.

783
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:19,716
    I was planning on getting

784
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,117
some candid nature shots anyway.

785
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,685
 -Yeah, yeah, sounds real great.

786
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,921
     Just one thing, pledge!

787
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,692
    Welcome to the beef box,
         population you.

788
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,429
   This is where you live now,
         in this thing.

789
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,697
         Lick the inside
      for a 3-D experience,

790
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,801
      you little shit bag.

791
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,936
        -All these bills!

792
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,571
             Aaaaah!

793
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,572
         -Your vagina --

794
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,912
  -Uh, you sure you don't want
       me to call my dad,

795
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,713
 just have him come pick us up?
              -No!

796
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,816
 I've got to fix this on my own!

797
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:55,585
    Plus, you murdered a guy!
              -Hey!

798
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,053
     Stuff happens, Candace.

799
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,055
      That's the real world
           we live in.

800
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,992
  Well, the wolves are coming.

801
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,727
   Let's spend the night here.

802
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:06,896
     Clean up the dead parts
         in the morning.

803
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,476
- What's wrong?

804
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,743
           -I'm sorry.

805
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:24,514
    I've just had a hard time
        sleeping since...

806
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:25,949
          -Since what?

807
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:29,185
          -The Dude Bro
      sophomore-year prank.

808
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:30,987
           -Oh, yeah.

809
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,188
    The sophomore-year prank.

810
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,891
       I remember it well.

811
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,593
      -Time's up, Sminkle.

812
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:39,062
  But you know what you can get
    for another $200, right?

813
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:41,664
   -Who the fuck do you think
  you're talking to, Fantasia?!

814
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,199
    I own this fucking town!

815
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,102
          I am eternal!

816
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,137
          I am eternal!

817
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,974
  Well, I don't really remember
    the sophomore-year prank,

818
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:54,277
          but I'm sure
     it was something awful.

819
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,913
         We're gonna get
    those Dude Bros, Candace.

820
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:59,182
 I don't know if you've ever...

821
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,118
         bopped anybody
 on the nose before, but, uh...

822
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,588
   it sure brings about a lot
           of closure.

823
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,157
             -Yeah.
    -Oh, um, I kind of sleep

824
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,260
       with my eyes open.

825
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:11,728
       It's just a thing.

826
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,929
           -It's okay.

827
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:15,198
    -Hang in there, partner.

828
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,100
           Good night.

829
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,035
          -Good night.

830
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,141
            Sminkle?

831
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,628
   -Z.Q., I can't see a thing
         in this thing.

832
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,031
 -Life is tough in the beef box,
             pledge.

833
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:49,666
            You know,
   you can get out of that box

834
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,634
  if you just man up and beef.

835
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:53,102
      I beefed on day five.

836
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,805
             Spike,
   he beefed like every hour.

837
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,674
           It's like,
  "Spike, slow your roll, man.

838
00:42:57,676 --> 00:43:00,577
      Don't beef so fast."
       He wouldn't listen.

839
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,580
       Turbeaux, he beefed
  before he even got in there.

840
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:04,747
        Dude's a machine.

841
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,149
  -Those guys seem pretty wild.

842
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:08,685
        -So fucking wild.

843
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,620
   -Can I tell you something,
              Z.Q.,

844
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:12,121
something I haven't told anyone?

845
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,957
         -Sure, Sizzler.

846
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:16,993
 -Sometimes, I think those guys
        don't respect me.

847
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,596
  And I'll never be a Delta Bi

848
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:22,031
          even if I get
   out of this cold beef box.

849
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,200
     -Delta Bis have to have
           confidence.

850
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,969
            In there,
 you have to think on your feet,

851
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:27,971
   'cause it's all you've got.

852
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:31,307
      My advice, if you're
    getting cold, just beef.

853
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,876
     Get a good steam going.
     -I don't want to beef.

854
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:36,112
 -Let go of your fears and beef.

855
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,780
        -My fear is beef!

856
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:41,250
      And pork and chicken
    and all that gross stuff!

857
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:42,919
      No one respects that.

858
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:44,287
     I'll never fit in here.

859
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,722
   -Don't get cranky with me,
             pledge!

860
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:47,223
     Just because I like you

861
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:49,258
   doesn't mean you're getting
     out of that box early.

862
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,396
     You, uh -- you hungry?

863
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:59,636
   You know, through my lens,
   I see the souls of my bros.

864
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:02,005
   I've seen your inner truth.

865
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:03,740
     You've got beef in you.

866
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,074
   I'm not gonna let you quit.

867
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:06,876
  You have too much potential.

868
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,698
           Oh, Brock,
 how am I supposed to avenge you

869
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,168
         if I can't find
        any stupid clues?

870
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,371
    Anyway, good to see you,
             like --

871
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,274
              Whoa.

872
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,153
               Oh!

873
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:26,155
             Clues!

874
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,024
            <i> -Oh, no!</i>

875
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:34,230
-Can you hold my hair back, bro?

876
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,367
             -Clues!

877
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,872
             -Brock.

878
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:45,208
       Is that you, Brock?

879
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,013
              -Yes.
            -Strange.

880
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:55,952
         I have memories
  of your corpse, a flagpole...

881
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:56,953
           your anus.

882
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,922
    -Must have been a dream.

883
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,157
         -I don't dream.

884
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:03,159
       -You should try it.
            It's fun.

885
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,495
          You can fly,
 you can fuck whatever you want.

886
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:07,330
           It's great.

887
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:09,999
   -What's that on your face,
             Brock?

888
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,201
        -It's chocolate.

889
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,405
    I'm saving it for later.

890
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:17,440
   -Did you miss your brother?

891
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,408
             -Brent?

892
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,845
     No, he -- he's a loser.

893
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,382
           -Peculiar.

894
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,251
   You used to cry every night

895
00:46:28,253 --> 00:46:32,488
   for having pushed him away
  to keep him safe from this...

896
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,056
           nightmare.

897
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,027
      Dance with me, Brock.

898
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:40,396
         Dance with me,
    just like we did in 1986

899
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:42,265
 at the rhythm and blues mixer.

900
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:44,200
 -That's when the second string
  of murders started happening!

901
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:46,202
       Do you remember --
           -Dance now.

902
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:48,538
    -But my investigation --
         -Now we dance.

903
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,859
            Catch me.

904
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,496
             -Whoa!

905
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,331
             Heavy!

906
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,499
              Ohh!

907
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,968
         Oh, no! Oh, no.

908
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,436
       No, no, no, no, no.
            Come on.

909
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,405
          Sam-- Samzy?

910
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:25,474
You're okay!
       You're okay, Samzy!

911
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:29,212
    Heavy! Come on! Come on!

912
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:30,513
          Think, Brent.
          Think, Brent.

913
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,215
      Everybody likes you.
       You're a good guy.

914
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,250
      They'll believe you.
         Samzy, Samzy...

915
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:36,152
          -Oh, my God!

916
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:41,390
   I see what's going on here.

917
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,126
      He's wasted on beer!

918
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:46,395
         You lied to me!

919
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,464
              Aah!

920
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,302
     -This coffee's so lame.

921
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:56,906
              -Aah!
 -Did somebody say orange juice?

922
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,908
        -Oh, oh, oh God!

923
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,476
            The beer!

924
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:02,912
            Oh, God!
            Oh, God!

925
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:04,580
       Oh, fuck you, tree!
               No!

926
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:09,285
        Oh, beer! No! No!

927
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:11,520
          Oh, God, no!
             Oh, no!

928
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:12,622
              Aah!

929
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:21,430
        Oh, it can't be!

930
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,933
            Oh, beer!

931
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:26,402
              Beer!

932
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,004
            Oh, beer!

933
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:30,306
               Oh!

934
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:34,310
      Oh, it's still cold!

935
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:36,412
         Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

936
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,080
               Oh!

937
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:42,151
          Oh, perfect!
    Now I just need the tap.

938
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,353
         Where's the...

939
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:45,922
        Where's the tap?!

940
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,021
         -It's all head.

941
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,230
 -So, Hamlet's not in the play.

942
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:30,366
        -No, he's in it.
    It's just not about him.

943
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:32,001
      It's about these two
         side characters

944
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:33,202
           that nobody
     thought were important.

945
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,504
      -Seems unnecessarily
          pretentious.

946
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,443
          -What?! Aah!

947
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:41,978
             -Boom!

948
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,679
            Oh, yeah!

949
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,118
       -All right, pledge.

950
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,386
   You're in the final stretch

951
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:52,588
    of the Delta Bi biannual
         bicep gauntlet.

952
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,423
           You've lost
 to pretty much every bro here.

953
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:55,624
    Now you're gonna face me.

954
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:56,625
        And if you lose,

955
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:58,127
   you're going in the barrel,

956
00:49:58,129 --> 00:49:59,228
       and I'm gonna read
    what you've been writing

957
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,097
 in that stupid diary of yours!

958
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:02,631
          -My journal.

959
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:04,433
           -All right.

960
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,002
         -Kick his ass.

961
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:07,636
          3,<i> tres,</i> go!

962
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:13,142
         -I already know
 what today's entry's gonna be.

963
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:14,377
      "Dear Diary, I lost,

964
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:16,245
    and now I'm in a barrel."
              -No.

965
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:17,279
             -Yeah!
              -No.

966
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,581
             -Yeah!
            -Please.

967
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,449
         -"Please" what?
     -Please don't beat me!

968
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:21,550
          -Okay. Maybe.

969
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:23,552
          Just kidding.
              -Ohh!

970
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,688
- Aah!

971
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,623
             -Yeah!
              -Yay!

972
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,158
           -Hey, guys!
              -Aww!

973
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,394
      -Babe, what the fuck
      are you doing here?!

974
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:32,762
      -Yeah! What the fuck,
           Samantha?!

975
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:34,230
     -What the fuck, Todd?!

976
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:35,431
          You can't let
      your girlfriend come!

977
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:36,432
       You know the rules!

978
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:37,600
     -I didn't let her come!

979
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:38,567
             What?!

980
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:40,403
    Babe, you can't be here.

981
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:42,638
   -I know you guys like beer,
        so I brought beer

982
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,440
      so you guys like me.
             Right?

983
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:47,510
-We can like beer without having
     to like you, Samantha.

984
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,578
      Samzy, get the beer!
             -Sorry.

985
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,515
     -See? Now we hate her.
        -Yeah, fuck her.

986
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:54,683
  -Don't we have an extra room?
           -Oh, yeah.

987
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:55,785
       We got all the room
          in the world.

988
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:57,486
      It's called outside!

989
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:00,289
       -The rules do state
  that during bicep bi-annuals,

990
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:04,193
           all females
     have to stay outside...

991
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:06,162
    where there is more room.

992
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:07,463
      -But I brought beer,

993
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:09,465
          and you guys
      stole my motor home!

994
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,367
   -Todd, you broke the rules.
     You got to go with her.

995
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,069
         -You can't let
     me go outside with her!

996
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,604
         She's gonna try
     and take my virginity.

997
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:17,540
       -No, I would never.

998
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:19,108
    -If I remember correctly,

999
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:22,845
    and I do, there's a tent
      in the shed out back.

1000
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:25,347
      -Yep, there's a tent
          in the shed.

1001
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:27,083
-The tent's located in the shed.

1002
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:29,185
   -That's where the tent is.
          In the shed.

1003
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,520
      -Tent's in the shed.
       Tent's in the shed.

1004
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,089
       Tent's in the shed.

1005
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:34,190
              -No!

1006
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:35,458
      -What's it gonna be?

1007
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,194
       Are you a Delta Bi
       or a Samantha guy?

1008
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,365
       -What do you think?

1009
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,374
      -Tent's in the shed.

1010
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:59,248
   -Looks like you get a stay
      of execution, pledge.

1011
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,457
       -I don't even want
    to look at you right now!

1012
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:14,830
          You've ruined
   my l-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife!

1013
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,199
    We're getting this tent,
     and we're going to bed!

1014
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,901
           That's it!

1015
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,672
        -Oh, that's fine!
          That's fine.

1016
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:24,740
            -Babe...
     -We can just go to bed.

1017
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,242
        -Yeah, I'm tired.

1018
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,510
      -I didn't mean to get
         you kicked out.

1019
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:28,811
            -Babe...
         -I am so sorry

1020
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,613
     that I'm a girl, baby.
         -You should be!

1021
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,248
    -Who needs the Delta Bis?

1022
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,849
  I think they're just jealous
         of you anyway.

1023
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,885
          -Babe, babe!

1024
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:37,586
 -Yeah, you are the smartest bro
          in the frat.

1025
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:40,556
    I mean, you've got career
    prospects, healthy gums,

1026
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,391
 I mean, amazing bone structure.
   -Stop. Your hands are cold.

1027
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:43,859
         -That tickles.
          -Your body is

1028
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,262
        so fucking jacked
          and fertile!

1029
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:49,465
 It's like your sperm count must
be in the billions or something.

1030
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,534
            -Oh, oh!

1031
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:53,169
             Babe...
    -I mean, those Delta Bis

1032
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:56,572
should be getting on their knees
         to worship you.

1033
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:58,240
  -Tell me more about my bros.

1034
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:00,209
         -Oh. Found it.

1035
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:04,180
              -Oh.

1036
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,881
          Oh, Samantha.

1037
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:07,283
            Oh, baby.

1038
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:08,717
        -Stay on target.
            -Oh, Sam.

1039
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,553
       -Eye on the prize!

1040
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:12,221
  -These air holes you poked in
the condom aren't working, babe.

1041
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,422
      -No, stay the course!

1042
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:15,191
          -Little Todd
      still can't breathe.

1043
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:17,760
       He looks like a --
  a dude jammed into something.

1044
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:19,595
       -It's usually hard.

1045
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:21,197
        -It normally is!

1046
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,531
        -Does this help?

1047
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,201
   -Yeah. Yeah, that's better.
          -Okay, good.

1048
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,969
             -Okay.
     -You've got this, Todd!

1049
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:28,637
      You are in the zone!

1050
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,839
  You are in the home stretch!
            -Please!

1051
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:32,808
 -You are killing it back there!
       -Don't look at me!

1052
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:38,847
      -Ahh, I'm having sex.

1053
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,584
    -Don't you quit now, boy!
       Don't you quit now!

1054
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:42,985
     -Now -- now I lost it.

1055
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:45,387
 -Put your Delta Bi seed in me!

1056
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,689
           -My seed?!

1057
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:48,624
              Aah!

1058
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,702
       -Thank you, Toddy.

1059
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,439
               Mm.

1060
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,276
     -Should've pulled out.

1061
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,849
    -How much further, Z.Q.?

1062
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:16,352
      -Our journey will end
     when it ends, Sizzler.

1063
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:18,287
       And once you beef,
       a whole new journey

1064
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:19,355
         begins for you.

1065
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:21,624
- Oh!

1066
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:24,360
          What's that?!
          -Tree noises.

1067
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,963
              Aah!

1068
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,304
           Oh. Oh, no!

1069
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,673
               Oh!
      -Z.Q., are you okay?!

1070
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:39,375
              -No!
          I'm not okay!

1071
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:40,976
         Kick my camera
    in my general direction!

1072
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,678
  This is an incredible scene!

1073
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,380
 -I'm getting out of this thing.
              -No!

1074
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:45,447
     -But I could save you!
             I just

1075
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,548
  have to get out of this box!

1076
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,385
      -Not until you beef!
            Sizzler!

1077
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,457
          -I'm trapped!
          I'm trapped!

1078
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,361
           -No! Ha ha!
         I'm on my way!

1079
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:00,529
         I have a rope!

1080
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:01,430
      Hang tight, Sizzler!
              -Aah!

1081
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,932
Aah!

1082
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,538
            Amazing!

1083
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,609
          -Rainin' men.

1084
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:17,579
     -Come on, Got to beef!

1085
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:18,847
          Got to beef!

1086
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:22,351
      I got to beef! Aaah!

1087
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:24,320
              Aaah!

1088
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:25,954
              Aaah!

1089
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:28,891
              Aaah!

1090
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:31,860
 -And the, uh, number-one reason

1091
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:37,366
    why cops just can't catch
         a break, uh...

1092
00:55:37,368 --> 00:55:38,634
         My dad beat me,

1093
00:55:38,636 --> 00:55:41,337
  and now I sleep with my eyes
              open!

1094
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:43,772
              -Boo!

1095
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:44,907
            -God! No!

1096
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:46,909
  -You can tell he's a virgin!

1097
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:49,078
            Oranges!

1098
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,548
        Oranges! Oranges!
        Get away from me!

1099
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,616
       -Sminkle! Wake up!

1100
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:56,418
-Number 6, please don't kill me!

1101
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,554
       -It's just a dream!
   We've got to move this car,

1102
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,022
  and I can't do it on my own.

1103
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,624
      I need your muscles.
              -Oh.

1104
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,094
  Well, why didn't you say so?

1105
00:56:05,096 --> 00:56:07,863
All I need is a hearty breakfast
           and, uh...

1106
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,531
              Hey.

1107
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,501
      The wolves cleaned up
        all the deadness.

1108
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:15,704
  And they filled up the tires.

1109
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,041
    Boy...those wolves are...

1110
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,813
    ...getting pretty smart.

1111
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,915
      -Just push, damn it!

1112
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,517
        -Brace yourself,

1113
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:31,920
     'cause you just bought
    yourself a one-way ticket

1114
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:35,124
 to the motherfucking gun show!

1115
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:43,031
     Fu-- Havin' a good time
        at the gun show!

1116
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:45,667
        Havin' a good --

1117
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:49,538
    Aah! Oh, those Dream Bros
          were right --

1118
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,674
   I can't do anything right.

1119
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:56,545
   -Look, here are the top 10
  reasons why Sminkle is great.

1120
00:56:56,547 --> 00:56:59,848
     10, he greets every day
          with a smile.

1121
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,484
  9, he wants to help children.

1122
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,686
    -I want to bang children!

1123
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:07,689
      -8, he wants to bang
        children's minds.

1124
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:10,125
    -No, it's not as catchy.
       No, it's too long.

1125
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:11,894
      It's too thought-out.
       It's too involved.

1126
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:14,062
 -7, he wants to bang children.

1127
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:16,932
         -Bang 'em good.
    -Don't give up, Sminkle.

1128
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,634
        We got to get you
        to the lake house

1129
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:20,869
      so that you can solve
     Chico's orange crisis!

1130
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:24,506
        -Virgin strength!

1131
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:27,843
              -Ah!
    6, he's asleep right now

1132
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:28,744
   yet still somehow pushing.

1133
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:30,212
              Uh...

1134
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:32,181
            I, uh...

1135
00:57:32,183 --> 00:57:34,082
    2, he's awake right now,

1136
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:35,451
    and that's a good thing!

1137
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:41,824
         1, he probably
     doesn't deserve to die.

1138
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:45,661
              Yes!
              -Yes!

1139
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:47,162
          -Oh, my God!
       Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1140
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:48,197
         -Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1141
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,705
            -Oh, no.

1142
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,526
   -Oh, no. I forgot my keys!

1143
00:58:17,528 --> 00:58:18,861
              Aah!

1144
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:20,963
          -Every year,
   thousands of idiots are --

1145
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:32,875
             -Guys!

1146
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:51,093
    -Hey, friend, come on in.

1147
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:53,061
    It's nice, and it's warm.

1148
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:56,031
   -Quit remembering your dead
 brother and jump in the water.

1149
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,533
      -Brent, come on, man!

1150
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:59,067
         You can do it!
             Brent!

1151
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:00,669
    Oh, take off that shirt.

1152
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,838
         You'll love it!

1153
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,740
        -Come on in, bro.
        Get in the water.

1154
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:07,075
         -In the water!
          -It's so wet!

1155
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:08,544
              -Yay!

1156
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:09,745
           You did it!

1157
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:12,014
        Congrats, buddy.

1158
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:13,815
 -We're having such a good time.

1159
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:16,919
       -Aren't we, Brent?
             -Yeah.

1160
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,087
         I guess we are.

1161
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:20,689
              Yeah!

1162
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:21,790
          -Told you so.

1163
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,592
          -Nice catch.

1164
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:24,893
             -Whoa!
            -Oh, no!

1165
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:28,230
      -Daddy, no, don't go.

1166
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,731
      I'm sorry I'm a girl.

1167
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,166
         Daddy, no! No!

1168
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:33,101
     No, I promise I'll have
         you a grandson.

1169
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:34,903
    It'll make it all better!
              Wait.

1170
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,305
       What's that, daddy?

1171
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:39,107
  You -- you'll be right back?
            Oh, okay.

1172
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,209
   I'll wait here on the stoop
            for you.

1173
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,844
              Bye.

1174
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,247
               Mm.

1175
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,115
            Oh, Todd,
   I had the most wonderful --

1176
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:49,785
          Aah! Aaaaaah!

1177
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,058
             -Whoo!
              Yeah!

1178
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,726
              -Shh!
              -Oh!

1179
00:59:57,728 --> 00:59:59,995
   Look, guys, Z.Q.'s overcome
      his fear of heights!

1180
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:01,196
              -Wow!

1181
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,846
      -Oh, my God! Torsos!

1182
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,683
       -Hey! Todd is dead!
            Help me!

1183
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,226
        -So, Z.Q.'s dead?

1184
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:40,362
        Samantha shows up
        covered in blood?

1185
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,231
 I knew she couldn't be trusted,
       but she's a killer!

1186
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:45,367
- Please let me in!

1187
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,103
 I just got punched in the face,
    and my boyfriend's dead!

1188
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:51,239
This weekend is not going at all
        how I planned it.

1189
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:53,041
    -Brent, you get the door.

1190
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,310
     Samzy, you played ball
       in college, right?

1191
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:58,113
       -Starting pitcher,
       East Chico Rapiers.

1192
01:01:58,115 --> 01:01:59,114
       -Batter's up, bro.

1193
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:00,248
     -Guys, I don't know --

1194
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,750
   -We're killing the killer!

1195
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:04,453
It's just like old times, Brock!
            Remember?

1196
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:06,722
Go, Rapiers!

1197
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:07,956
            -Please!

1198
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,391
           -Just move.

1199
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:11,793
   Your brother's more Rapier
      than you'll ever be.

1200
01:02:11,795 --> 01:02:13,762
       -Please let me in!

1201
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:15,897
           -Who is it?
         -It's Samantha!

1202
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,799
         -Samantha who?

1203
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:19,835
       -Samantha Samantha!
           Let me in!

1204
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:20,902
     I'm Todd's girlfriend!

1205
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,437
 I've tried to bang all of you!

1206
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:24,940
-Todd doesn't have a girlfriend.

1207
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,908
 He's still discovering himself.

1208
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,510
        -Just let me in.

1209
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:30,879
             -Okay.

1210
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,750
              -Ohh!

1211
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:36,952
          -Go, Rapiers!

1212
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:39,421
         -Wait a minute.
Samantha couldn't be Motherface.

1213
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:42,157
      Todd told me she was
  on that Booze Cruise in Cabo

1214
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,458
        when Brock died.

1215
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,761
         Guys, Samantha
     couldn't be Motherface.

1216
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,329
      Todd told me she was
      on that Booze Cruise

1217
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,764
    in Cabo when Brock died.

1218
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:50,031
             -Whoa!

1219
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:51,900
           Motherface?
      -Motherface is dead!

1220
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:53,201
      We killed her twice,
        Brock, remember?

1221
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:54,903
  Rememb-- Br-Br-Broc-- Broc--

1222
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:56,138
          Broc-- Broc--

1223
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,806
          Broc-- Broc--
             Broc--

1224
01:02:57,808 --> 01:02:59,174
      -Ba-gawk! She's dead.

1225
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:01,009
       Motherface is dead.
          -She's dead.

1226
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:04,446
  But Samantha is here, alive,
        covered in blood!

1227
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:06,181
  -We're all covered in blood!

1228
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,550
        Are you guys daft
         or something?!

1229
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:10,852
       Motherface is back!

1230
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:13,822
        She killed Todd,
        she killed Z.Q.,

1231
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:15,991
   and she killed my brother,
             Brock!

1232
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:17,425
    -Samzy, throw another bat
             at him.

1233
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:19,060
        -I'm out of bats.
             -Fine.

1234
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:21,863
I'll defeat him using good looks
           and logic.

1235
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:24,833
        You are stu-pid.

1236
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:26,134
  -Brock, you always had a plan

1237
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,202
   when these kinds of things
            happened.

1238
01:03:27,204 --> 01:03:28,203
     Brock, What's the plan?

1239
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:29,971
  -Don't drag Brock into this!

1240
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:33,041
         -Don't tell him
 where to drag my dead brother!

1241
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:36,144
     I already lost him once
  when he joined the Delta Bis,

1242
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:39,481
    and then you let him get
     murdered by Motherface

1243
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:41,249
     right under your noses!

1244
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,318
          -That's fine.
         You know what?

1245
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,419
   I'm rescinding your pledge.

1246
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:46,454
            -Oh, no!

1247
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,323
          I don't care!

1248
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:49,958
  I'm not even here to pledge!

1249
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,459
      I'm here for Brock --

1250
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:55,263
to find out what happened to him
      and avenge his death,

1251
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:59,100
 not to bro out with you dudes!

1252
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:01,837
        -You lied to us.
              -No.

1253
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,004
       No, no, no, no, no.

1254
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,574
         -I trusted you!

1255
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:09,010
         -Who are you?!

1256
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:12,113
    -New plan -- time to beat
         the shit out of

1257
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:14,249
  dead Brock's living brother,
             Brent.

1258
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:18,253
      -Brock has a brother?
       -I told you, Samzy.

1259
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:20,255
          God damn it.
          -Oh, my God!

1260
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:22,257
  You're little Brent Chirino!

1261
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:25,126
 I have heard so much about you.

1262
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,494
         You can -- Wow.
              Okay.

1263
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:28,897
      So you can understand
       how meeting someone

1264
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:31,099
that looks exactly like somebody
    that you thought was dead

1265
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:33,969
     would be exceptionally
           confusing.

1266
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,875
  -What the hell are you doing
  out of the beef box, pledge?!

1267
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,647
           <i> -Amazing!</i>

1268
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:49,150
         <i> -Rainin' men.</i>

1269
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:50,652
        -Oh, God -- Z.Q.

1270
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:52,187
             <i> -Aah!</i>
             -There!

1271
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:54,556
     That's where I beefed.

1272
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,458
        -Pause the tape.

1273
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:01,229
            Enhance.

1274
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:04,666
    I said enhance, damn you!

1275
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:07,936
           Now squint.

1276
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:09,037
          -Motherface!

1277
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,305
              -Who?
           -I knew it.

1278
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,339
              -Yes.
             -Whoa.

1279
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,642
           -It's true.

1280
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:15,176
           She's back.

1281
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:16,678
  But I've been investigating,

1282
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,548
  and I think I know who she is
      and how to stop her.

1283
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,550
 I thought I could do it alone.

1284
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:24,286
         But I need you.

1285
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,989
      You're the only bros
          I have left.

1286
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:32,928
          -Step aside,
 Brock's identical twin brother.

1287
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,430
Let a real Delta Bi handle this.

1288
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,700
    You see, after surviving
   two party massacres myself,

1289
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:43,371
     I grew weary of relying
on Brock's plans to save us all.

1290
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:46,641
 To wit, I created an identical
    robot duplicate of myself

1291
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:51,413
  for one, singular purpose --
       to kill Motherface.

1292
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:55,216
             -Weird.
     -It's up in the attic.

1293
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:57,185
              -Oh!

1294
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:59,087
               Oh!
           That's it!

1295
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:00,488
             Robot!

1296
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:02,324
          In the attic.

1297
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:04,326
              -Oh!
             -Okay.

1298
01:06:04,328 --> 01:06:08,063
    Well, with that in mind,
 you bros just kick your feet up

1299
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:10,365
    and let me and Robo-Samzy
     take care of this one.

1300
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:12,100
 -I don't know if you should --
          -Just, uh...

1301
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,373
 That's odd. There appears to be
    some kind of malfunction.

1302
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,508
  I'll just do a quick check --
            -No! No!

1303
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,979
   I was just thinking, maybe,
      if that doesn't work,

1304
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:26,381
  then we should have a plan B.

1305
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:28,717
- I got this one.

1306
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:31,386
      -Yeah, there he goes.

1307
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:34,189
       -Secret door open.

1308
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:36,758
     -And there he's going.

1309
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,294
           Oh, Jesus.
          -Robo-Samzy?

1310
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:40,462
          Robo-Samzy?!

1311
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:42,530
       Oh, no! Robo-Samzy!

1312
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:45,266
    You didn't try to dance,
            did you?!

1313
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:48,636
       You beautiful fool!
      Who did this to you?!

1314
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:51,773
        -It was...Bro...

1315
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,313
       -What is going on?!

1316
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:02,584
         Aah! Aah! Aah!

1317
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:04,452
         Aah! Aah! Aah!

1318
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:05,787
         Aah! Aah! Aah!

1319
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:07,255
         Aah! Aah! Aah!

1320
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:09,057
       Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

1321
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:10,692
     -I don't like that guy.

1322
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,429
           -Aah! Aah!

1323
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,435
      -What is happening?!

1324
01:07:20,437 --> 01:07:22,237
     I had a plan this time!

1325
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,738
       I watched you die!

1326
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:24,606
             Twice!

1327
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:29,411
              Hmm?

1328
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:36,084
      -Why are you hitting
         yourself, huh?

1329
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:41,723
        -What are you --
       I'm a little bitch!

1330
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,091
       I'm a little bitch!

1331
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:44,659
       I'm a little bitch!

1332
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:46,494
   I'm a little bitch, bitch,
   bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch,

1333
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,763
      bitch, bitch, bitch,
      bitch, bitch, bitch!

1334
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:50,098
     -You killed my mother.

1335
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:53,435
         And my sister.

1336
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,173
          You at least
    deserve a tongue-lashing.

1337
01:07:58,175 --> 01:07:59,574
              -Aah!

1338
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:00,809
            Aah! Aah!

1339
01:08:00,811 --> 01:08:02,644
            Aah! Aah!

1340
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:03,645
            Aah! Aah!

1341
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:05,713
Aah!

1342
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,493
        -What? No tongue?

1343
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:43,284
           -Call now,
 and we'll send you a second --

1344
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,487
  Are you bored of the same --

1345
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:48,256
- No, no.
      Please. Please, God.

1346
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:49,557
         Please. Oh, no.

1347
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:51,159
        Oh, God, Candace.

1348
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:01,769
Oh, God!

1349
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,610
         Virgin...tears.

1350
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:09,644
--Aah.

1351
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,713
Ugh.

1352
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:13,648
Ew.

1353
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,484
       -You saved my life.
   -Well, yeah, you big dummy.

1354
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,653
   I mean, you know, honestly,
    this is the longest time

1355
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,921
         I've ever spent
      with another person,

1356
01:09:19,923 --> 01:09:21,589
      and I've never really
          had a friend,

1357
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:22,891
   and no one's ever listened
    to my top 10 lists before

1358
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:24,359
    or had such pretty hair,

1359
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:25,693
 and when we were flying through
            the air,

1360
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:27,428
       I really thought we
       had a moment there,

1361
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:28,796
 and I honestly thought I could
    spend the rest of my life

1362
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:30,498
     flying through the air
      next to this person!

1363
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,533
     And I was honestly glad
   we didn't wear seat belts!

1364
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:32,734
     You know, fuck safety!

1365
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:34,602
      And I really thought
        that I lost you!

1366
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:35,770
          -Oh, Sminkle.

1367
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:38,573
          -Oh, Candace.

1368
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:39,841
           -I'm sorry.

1369
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:41,242
      -There's another guy,
          isn't there.

1370
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:42,410
          Gosh darn it.
       I should've known.

1371
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:44,913
        Classic Candace.

1372
01:09:44,915 --> 01:09:47,415
- Nice work, officer.

1373
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:57,525
              -Hey.

1374
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,228
        Sorry I abandoned
         you back there.

1375
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,696
     -That's okay, daddy --

1376
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:04,232
- I mean, Brent.
-     Brent.

1377
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:08,836
            I'm cold.

1378
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,553
    Are we gonna die, Brent?

1379
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,433
    -Hey, Sizzler, great job.

1380
01:10:38,435 --> 01:10:40,468
    Why don't you go fuck off
      for a sec, all right?

1381
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,871
       -Sure. I'll go get
  my organic veggies upstairs.

1382
01:10:43,873 --> 01:10:45,540
    -Grab a big bag of dicks.
          I don't care.

1383
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,678
              -Hey.

1384
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,513
    -Brock meant a lot to me.

1385
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:55,883
  And I thought, like a idiot,

1386
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:58,253
  that maybe you'd be like him,

1387
01:10:58,255 --> 01:10:59,854
       and we could go on
   like nothing ever happened.

1388
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:02,357
    But something did happen.

1389
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:03,424
         You lied to me!

1390
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,659
  -Turbeaux, you can trust me.

1391
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:06,494
     We're in this together.
              -No!

1392
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:08,663
  Brock planned all my workouts
             for me!

1393
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:10,932
  We were supposed to do traps
    and lats the day he died!

1394
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,767
         Now look at me!

1395
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:16,404
  -If we do 10 sets of 20 reps
  on the lat pull-down machine,

1396
01:11:16,406 --> 01:11:19,807
   I swear, we will sculpt you
   the V-taper of your dreams.

1397
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:21,542
        -You lied to me!

1398
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:23,278
            -I swear,
 I will never lie to you again.

1399
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,612
   -What if it's my birthday?

1400
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:26,481
           You take me
to a quiet little bistro dinner.

1401
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:27,815
       Nothing too fancy?

1402
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:30,385
        And then you act
  like you "forgot your keys."

1403
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:31,486
     Then the lights go out.

1404
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:32,920
   Who turned out the lights?

1405
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:34,622
   Then the lights go back on.

1406
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:35,990
    All my friends are there.

1407
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,525
    And you know what it is?

1408
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:40,828
     It's a goddamn surprise
         birthday party!

1409
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:44,832
  Garcon, bring out the fucking
  raspberry brown butter torte

1410
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:48,336
  that reads "Happy 23rd B-Day,
            Turbeaux!

1411
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:50,838
     Love your lying friend,

1412
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,408
        the sack of shit
       that he is, Brent!"

1413
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:56,010
      -I swear, I will ruin
      every surprise party

1414
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,313
  that anyone ever throws you!

1415
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,514
     -But I love surprises!

1416
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:00,782
   -What's your problem, man?!

1417
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:03,384
      -I have a hairy dick!

1418
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:09,857
            -Wh-what?

1419
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,330
      -You know how I hate
        little baby dogs

1420
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:17,699
        and their little
      hairy baby dog dicks?

1421
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,100
      -Yeah, I guess, yeah.

1422
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:22,637
         -When I look at
   a little baby dog, Brent...

1423
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:25,707
      I see the parts of me
          that I hate!

1424
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:29,077
        I hate my little
      hairy baby dog dick!

1425
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,879
       -That's cool, man.

1426
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:34,782
    That's...That's normal...

1427
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:38,886
 for us...to have...problems...

1428
01:12:38,888 --> 01:12:42,790
   with our -- with our dicks.

1429
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:43,958
            -Really?

1430
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,128
             -Sure.

1431
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:48,863
           -All right.

1432
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:49,864
           All right.

1433
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,667
    Well, me and my fuzz rod,

1434
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:54,502
         we're gonna...

1435
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:58,873
      go down to the cellar
    and...get some more wood.

1436
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:03,010
      All right. Good talk.

1437
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,421
             -What?

1438
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:15,923
           Who's been
    pillaging my veg stash?!

1439
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:19,794
      What am I gonna eat?

1440
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:40,815
    Aww. You're just hungry.
          That's cool.

1441
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:43,684
      What's mine is yours,
         rabbit friend.

1442
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,561
          No, I can't!
        I'm a vegetarian!

1443
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:54,762
      Meat upsets my stom--

1444
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:04,038
         Oh, n-o-o-o-o!

1445
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:37,939
           -All right!

1446
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:48,649
        One bullet? Cool.

1447
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:51,185
               Oh!

1448
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,093
     I'm not afraid of you.

1449
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,211
   Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1450
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:18,746
          I'm a puppet!

1451
01:15:18,748 --> 01:15:20,648
              Aah!

1452
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:21,649
           Oh, my God!

1453
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:22,850
            Ohh! Ohh!

1454
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,553
        I hate my little
      hairy baby dog dick!

1455
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:27,755
      I have a hairy dick!

1456
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:29,790
        Baby hairy dick!

1457
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:33,094
        I hate my little
      hairy baby dog dick!

1458
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:35,563
      I have a hairy dick!

1459
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:43,871
        You're so small!

1460
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:47,708
         -What was that?
        -Turbeaux's dead.

1461
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,277
          -And Sizzler?

1462
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:51,579
           -Honestly,
    I forgot who Sizzler was,

1463
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:54,282
   but I should play it cool.

1464
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:56,551
Let's split up and look for him.

1465
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,690
            -Sizzler?

1466
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:04,325
            -Sizzler?

1467
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,664
            -Sizzler?

1468
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:11,933
            -Sizzler?

1469
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,305
            -Sizzler?

1470
01:16:17,307 --> 01:16:19,206
            -Sizzler?

1471
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,108
            Sizzler?

1472
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,080
            -Sizzler?

1473
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,850
            -Sizzler?

1474
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:32,353
          Oh! Sizzler?!

1475
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:37,792
            -Sizzler?

1476
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,129
            Sizzler?

1477
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:44,065
            Sizzler?

1478
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:47,068
            -Relzzis?

1479
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,371
            -Relzzis?

1480
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:52,740
            -Sizzler?

1481
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:54,675
            -Relzzis?

1482
01:16:54,677 --> 01:16:56,177
            Relzzis?

1483
01:16:56,179 --> 01:16:58,012
            Sizzler?

1484
01:16:58,014 --> 01:16:59,046
            Relzzis?

1485
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:01,382
            Relzzis?

1486
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:03,684
            -Sizzler?

1487
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:06,621
            -Sizzler?

1488
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:13,961
      Oh, my God! Oh, God!

1489
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,734
         -Whoa, Sizzler?

1490
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:22,703
              Shit.

1491
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:26,073
      Looks like it's just
         the two of us.

1492
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:28,909
              -No.

1493
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,811
        There's a third.

1494
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,652
         -T-O-Double-D?
            -Mm-hmm.

1495
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,054
    -It's the last Delta Bi.

1496
01:17:51,934 --> 01:17:54,435
    -We have Steve Guttenberg
       here in the studio

1497
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:56,070
          to talk to us
    about his upcoming movie,

1498
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:59,040
       "3 Men and a Baby."
          -Can't wait!

1499
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:00,408
  See you after the late-night
         morning movie.

1500
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,710
          -Stay tuned!
            -Sizzler?

1501
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,847
     Oh, God! Todd Jr., no!

1502
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:10,117
Fetus!

1503
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,686
 -I wish you'd be more positive.

1504
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:13,688
      -I've had a bad day.
            -Oh, no.

1505
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,089
  Motherface got you guys, too.

1506
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:16,691
      -Oh, you don't care.

1507
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,392
 You don't even know our names.

1508
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:20,227
       -Yea-- yeah, I do.

1509
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:21,829
            -Name us.

1510
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:23,731
          -Todd -- no.
           Turtleneck.

1511
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:26,300
        Turtleneck bro...

1512
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:28,836
          Flannel bro.

1513
01:18:28,838 --> 01:18:30,137
          -Lucky guess.

1514
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:32,273
     Only 'cause we're named
        after our shirts.

1515
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:35,176
 Can you even name one good time
       we've had together?

1516
01:18:35,178 --> 01:18:37,078
             -Yeah!

1517
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:43,117
              -No.

1518
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,023
            Aah! Ohh!

1519
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:50,791
            Ohh, ohh!

1520
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,295
      -You're alone, Brent.

1521
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:55,963
 You never avenged your brother.

1522
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,798
 You never solved your mystery.

1523
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,934
       -Oh, you're wrong.

1524
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:05,372
 I'm ready to avenge my brother
  because I solved my mystery.

1525
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:08,776
 I know who you are, Motherface.

1526
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:11,045
      You're Ronald Reagan.

1527
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,150
       -No -- no, I'm not.

1528
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:17,985
 -Think about it, Mr. President.

1529
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:21,388
   The Dude Bros freshman-year
  prank deposed General Cortez.

1530
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:24,425
    -Your heavy-metal hot-air
balloon did drive General Cortez

1531
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:25,893
   from the Brazilian embassy.

1532
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:28,262
      -So you could install
        a puppet dictator

1533
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,431
        and turn the tide
       in Central America.

1534
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:34,235
  Oh, with their powerful pecs
    and extreme athleticism,

1535
01:19:34,237 --> 01:19:38,405
          the Delta Bis
 were you personal Delta Force.

1536
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,110
      -This is ridiculous.
        -Sophomore year,

1537
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,445
     they sold arms to Iran,

1538
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:47,181
      but that went south,
       didn't it, Ronnie?

1539
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:50,317
   So you decommissioned them
 to a frat house in East Chico.

1540
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:52,019
         How convenient.

1541
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:54,321
      Oh, except you forgot
        about one thing.

1542
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:56,891
       You can't turn off
  training like that, can you?

1543
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:58,893
               No.
    Not like a light switch.

1544
01:19:58,895 --> 01:20:00,895
  -Part of me did die that day.

1545
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:03,931
  -So, two days ago, when they
    brought down two planes,

1546
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:07,301
      you got a sex change,
    you appointed an imposter

1547
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,236
       to take your place
            in D.C.,

1548
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:14,074
     and donned the face of
 Chico's most notorious killer.

1549
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:16,944
      Admit it, Motherface.

1550
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:21,048
      You are our nation's
         40th president.

1551
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,587
        -Damn it, Brent.

1552
01:20:26,589 --> 01:20:28,856
        How did you know?

1553
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:30,591
          -I solved it!

1554
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,896
          Oh, damn it!

1555
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:38,065
I really thought I had that one!

1556
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,034
               Oh!

1557
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:42,403
 I'm ready to avenge my brother,
           Motherface,

1558
01:20:42,405 --> 01:20:44,205
   because I know who you are.

1559
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:46,106
          -Did you know
      about his worst fear?

1560
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:47,842
      -Running out of beer?

1561
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:50,244
     -You knew all kinds of
 personal information about us.

1562
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:52,079
      -No babies! My seed!

1563
01:20:52,081 --> 01:20:53,180
              Aaah!

1564
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,548
        -My fear is beef!

1565
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:57,585
      And pork and chicken
    and all that gross stuff!

1566
01:20:57,587 --> 01:21:00,120
         -I told you --
      I hate handyman work.

1567
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:01,522
              Aaah!

1568
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:03,257
        -Z.Q.'s overcome
      his fear of heights!

1569
01:21:03,259 --> 01:21:04,225
              -Wow!
      -We never established

1570
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:05,593
    he was afraid of heights.

1571
01:21:05,595 --> 01:21:07,061
         -Eh, who cares?
   This whole thing's a mess.

1572
01:21:07,063 --> 01:21:09,063
    -This is fucking stupid.
            -Guys...

1573
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:12,299
           And that's
   because you're Turbeaux --

1574
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:14,101
      the school therapist!

1575
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:15,436
            Ow! Why?!

1576
01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:17,238
              -Why?

1577
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:20,241
 Haven't you been investigating
       any of this shit?!

1578
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:24,311
  Your brother murdered my mom
       and my twin sister!

1579
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:28,449
     I swore that the reign
of terror of your kind was over.

1580
01:21:28,451 --> 01:21:29,917
    I swore that I would find

1581
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:32,286
     the Delta Bis deepest,
         darkest fears,

1582
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:34,154
  starting with your brothers,

1583
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:36,156
  and use it to slaughter them!

1584
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:40,294
     -Hey, my brother was --
     -Oh, shut the fuck up.

1585
01:21:40,296 --> 01:21:42,196
     I was their therapist!

1586
01:21:42,198 --> 01:21:45,032
    Oh, the things these guys
            told me.

1587
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:46,934
       Did you know that,
         two months ago,

1588
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:49,069
     Derek hit a 9-year-old
          with his car

1589
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:52,039
       and then buried her
 under the football field, huh?

1590
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:56,277
     And Samzy put Coca-Cola
  and Pop Rocks in the fuselage

1591
01:21:56,279 --> 01:21:58,979
    of the Challenger shuttle
           as a goof!

1592
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:02,616
 -Hey, what about patient-doctor
        confidentiality?

1593
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:05,152
  -Oh, the sense of entitlement
         on these bros!

1594
01:22:05,154 --> 01:22:07,554
            -Tai chi!

1595
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,358
 -Why did you join their ranks,
             Brent?

1596
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,362
  You could've ended this cycle
   of meaningless destruction.

1597
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:17,932
     -I just wanted to have
        the feeling of...

1598
01:22:17,934 --> 01:22:20,067
       brotherhood again.

1599
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:22,436
     I...I had a good time.

1600
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,072
         -Oh, fuck you!

1601
01:22:25,074 --> 01:22:26,640
     What about sisterhood?!

1602
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:28,676
  My sister was my best friend.

1603
01:22:28,678 --> 01:22:32,146
 None of you motherfuckers have
  any sense of goddamn empathy.

1604
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:35,149
      They crashed a plane
       into an orphanage.

1605
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:37,084
          An orphanage!

1606
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:41,488
 -Well, I was behind the planes,
            not them.

1607
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,591
    -You are just like Brock.

1608
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:48,696
  Do you know why your brother

1609
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:51,298
   went to a different college
            than you?

1610
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,167
         -East Chico U.
 has an urban-development major.

1611
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:55,169
 He wanted to be a city planner.

1612
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:58,038
  -He told me he needed space.

1613
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:06,246
    -N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

1614
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:09,149
   -Not so motherfucking fast,
           Motherface!

1615
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:13,087
            -Nedry?!
  -That's fucking right, bitch!

1616
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:15,723
    -You're doing it, Nedry!
        You're swearing!

1617
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:17,257
      -Looks like I fucking

1618
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:19,426
   handicapped your advantage,
           Motherface.

1619
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:22,062
    See, I've gained mastery
     over all these animals!

1620
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:23,430
       Look at my beasts!

1621
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:25,599
    I've forgiven the wolves
      that slayed my family

1622
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:27,134
    and become their leader.

1623
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:29,036
         You want to see
       some cold-ass shit?

1624
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:30,637
             Ca-caw!

1625
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,010
  This here is a motherfucking
           bald eagle,

1626
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:37,611
   the most majestic creature
           in America,

1627
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:40,314
    and I made him my bitch!

1628
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:43,283
  And it's about to motherfuck
     your face, Motherface!

1629
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:46,653
     Because you know, birds
     of a feather, flock --

1630
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:48,789
            together.

1631
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,470
             -Whoa!

1632
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:04,605
            Tai ch--

1633
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:09,109
       -What's the matter?

1634
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:10,511
         All choked up?

1635
01:24:26,462 --> 01:24:29,163
  Use her inertia against her.

1636
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,204
       -Is it really you?

1637
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:38,639
        -It's really me.

1638
01:24:38,641 --> 01:24:40,407
           It's Brock.

1639
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:41,642
             -Weird.

1640
01:24:41,644 --> 01:24:44,478
  I...thought you needed space.

1641
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,681
   -Hey. We've had our space.

1642
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:49,583
   And we'll never need space
             again,

1643
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:52,386
       because I'll always
         be with you...

1644
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:54,855
           within you.

1645
01:24:54,857 --> 01:24:57,124
        Yeah. You'll see.

1646
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:04,098
          Oh, crumbles!

1647
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:08,168
      Virgin sacrifice. Oh!

1648
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:15,509
        Oh, if only I was
   a roly-poly bag of oranges!

1649
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:17,244
   I'd bop myself on the nose

1650
01:25:17,246 --> 01:25:20,380
      and tumble and fumble
 right out of this tender trap.

1651
01:25:20,382 --> 01:25:21,782
       -Sminkle, it's me.

1652
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:24,651
   Let's get you out of here.

1653
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:28,122
        -You lied to me.

1654
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:30,524
       You all lied to me.

1655
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:33,660
 And the Dude Bros aren't really
   bags of oranges, are they?

1656
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:35,762
        And every moment
     we spent in my bang bus

1657
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:37,831
     meant nothing, did it.

1658
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:39,533
      Well, fine, Candace.

1659
01:25:39,535 --> 01:25:41,335
        If dying a virgin
         is the only way

1660
01:25:41,337 --> 01:25:43,537
  I can save my beloved Chico,

1661
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:46,540
     then I guess that's all
          I'm good for.

1662
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,811
     -Not if I can help it.

1663
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:52,679
      -What are you doing?

1664
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:54,414
       -Saving your life.

1665
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:59,386
   -She's too powerful, Brock.
         I let you down.

1666
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:01,922
         -Hey, remember
      what I always say --

1667
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:04,892
        if you face a foe
 you're afraid you can't defeat,

1668
01:26:04,894 --> 01:26:06,760
  you got to let your bros in.

1669
01:26:06,762 --> 01:26:07,861
        Let us in, Brent.

1670
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:10,430
        Let us all...in.

1671
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:20,574
   All along, Brent, you just
   needed to let you bros in.

1672
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,179
           -I'm ready.

1673
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:32,219
         Bros, enter me!

1674
01:26:32,221 --> 01:26:33,754
               Oh!

1675
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,723
               Oh!

1676
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:37,858
            Oh-ho-ho!

1677
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:40,561
              Unh!
        -You're doing it.

1678
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,770
              -Oh!

1679
01:26:49,772 --> 01:26:51,438
            Oh-ho-ho!

1680
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,674
              Unh!

1681
01:26:53,676 --> 01:26:55,242
               Oh!

1682
01:26:55,244 --> 01:26:57,878
             -Whoa!
    We're not virgin anymore.

1683
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,348
         I feel so free!

1684
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:01,982
              -Ah!

1685
01:27:01,984 --> 01:27:03,517
               Oh!

1686
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:40,020
          -I'll always
     be with you, Brent....

1687
01:27:40,022 --> 01:27:44,925
        inside your butt
       giving you powers.

1688
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:46,827
            -Bye-bye.

1689
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,809
 -And that's the number 1 reason
 why Candace and I are in love.

1690
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:04,544
           -You fool!

1691
01:28:04,546 --> 01:28:07,914
   You had one simple destiny,
           Sminkle --

1692
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,349
     to stop the Dude Bros,

1693
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:11,051
     and you balls'd it up!

1694
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:13,387
      Do you have any idea

1695
01:28:13,389 --> 01:28:18,058
how much work and taxpayer money
        went into this?!

1696
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:20,460
        I learned Latin.

1697
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,562
           And making
    all those blood candles?

1698
01:28:22,564 --> 01:28:26,366
           Jesus, I --
     I killed so many ducks.

1699
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:31,405
          And Debra...
       made a lovely cake.

1700
01:28:31,407 --> 01:28:35,409
  I ate a goddamn nicoise salad

1701
01:28:35,411 --> 01:28:38,011
          to make room
      for this cocksucker,

1702
01:28:38,013 --> 01:28:40,447
and now I can't even look at it!

1703
01:28:42,618 --> 01:28:45,652
           And you --
   you said I could trust you!

1704
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:48,088
 And you fall in love with<i> him?!</i>

1705
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:49,756
     -Chief, you got a call

1706
01:28:49,758 --> 01:28:54,027
 from the Imperial Dark Majesty
           on line 1.

1707
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:59,933
   -That's, uh -- that's Eric,
    and I have to take this.

1708
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:07,007
    -Well, we did it, Candy!

1709
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:09,509
  And all because you taught me
      to believe in myself.

1710
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,411
       -Well, I don't want
     to take all the credit.

1711
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:14,514
I mean, you did teach me a thing
        or two, as well.

1712
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:17,017
      -Hey, I got a silly,
     crazy, little old idea.

1713
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,885
   What say you and me become
     a boyfriend-girlfriend

1714
01:29:18,887 --> 01:29:22,522
      mystery-solving team,
    banging kids on the side?

1715
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:25,025
         I already know
 what our first case will be --

1716
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:28,362
 the Chico County Orange Crisis.

1717
01:29:28,364 --> 01:29:31,832
          -About that,
   I already cracked the case.

1718
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:35,869
              -Wow.
     That was fucking fast.

1719
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:39,639
 Where are your clues, partner?

1720
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:41,875
     -I'm a bag of oranges.

1721
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:48,782
             -What?

1722
01:29:48,784 --> 01:29:52,652
     -I'm a bag of oranges.

1723
01:29:52,654 --> 01:29:54,788
       -That's not a clue.
       That's not a clue.

1724
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:55,922
     -Search your feelings.

1725
01:29:55,924 --> 01:29:58,792
     You know it to be true.

1726
01:29:58,794 --> 01:30:01,895
  -Bag of oranges, get in here!

1727
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,598
      -Top 10 reasons magic
           isn't real.

1728
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,800
           Number 10,
    I have prayed to a genie

1729
01:30:06,802 --> 01:30:08,835
         to take me away
   from my abusive home life,

1730
01:30:08,837 --> 01:30:10,737
     and it never showed up.

1731
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,773
      Candace, please, no!

1732
01:30:12,775 --> 01:30:16,510
          Ew! Oh, gosh!

1733
01:30:16,512 --> 01:30:18,011
         But I love you!

1734
01:30:18,013 --> 01:30:19,980
        -If you love me,
  you know what you have to do.

1735
01:30:19,982 --> 01:30:22,549
             -I do.

1736
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:25,652
 -Look, he's talking to that bag
        of oranges again.

1737
01:30:25,654 --> 01:30:27,654
       -Do it. Save Chico.

1738
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,725
        -I will always...

1739
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:33,460
            love you.

1740
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:41,868
      N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

1741
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:43,637
  <i> -I don't want to call things</i>
           <i> too early,</i>

1742
01:30:43,639 --> 01:30:45,038
    <i> but up here in the sky,</i>

1743
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,807
         <i> it looks like</i>
     <i> Chico's orange crisis</i>

1744
01:30:46,809 --> 01:30:48,475

1745
01:33:20,027 --> 01:33:21,995
             -Whoo!

1746
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:46,332
          -Hi, my baby!

1747
01:41:46,334 --> 01:41:48,568
           -Sizzler?!
            -My baby!

1748
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:51,104
            -Sizzler?
