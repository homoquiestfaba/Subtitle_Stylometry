They didn't even know you were there?

355

No way. I was in the shadows, hiding.

356

This guy is all green.

Who wears paint when they're doing it?

359

where you told my sister

You'd break her heart,
and then I'd have to kill you, all right?

a bunch of different girls

and just bang one girl, you know?

It's bigger than me.

all hot and bothered by her,

wanna bang the waitress?

I'd still bang the waitress.

is gonna be Eric, right?

00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,155
-It's like 80 out there.
-Listen to me.

692
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,038
I can't do this right now.

693
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,429
Eric, I'm not letting you do this to me again,
all right?

694
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,635
-lf you want to screw...
-Tyler.

695
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,915
No. If you want to screw around
and mess up your own life, fine.

696
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,718
But I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let you screw up mine.

697
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,638
-Tyler...
-I'm not finished. I'm not finished, all right?

698
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,156
You spend all of your free time just trying to
bone any girl that'll smile at you. No!

699
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,471
And your game has gone to complete shit
because all you do is hustle.

700
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,235
And now, you want to screw up
everything we've worked for.

701
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,519
All I need you to do is step up, be a man,

702
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,875
and do this photo shoot,
so I can get the advertising campaign going.

703
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,873
And you can't even do that,
'cause it's always about you, Eric.

704
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,349
What are you doing?

705
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,750
What the hell is this? A joke?

706
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,912
-I wish.
-Very funny. Okay, you got me.

707
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,555
Just take those off
and let's go do the photo shoot, all right?

708
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,675
Let's go.

709
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,320
Ty, this is not a joke. I'm serious.

710
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,395
Those aren't real.

711
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,790
They are real. Give me.

712
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,673
TYLER: Holy fucking shit!

713
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,034
(STUTTERS) This is messed up, man.

714
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,269
I know.

715
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,596
-How the hell could this have happened?
-I don't know.

716
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,477
-You don't know?
-Don't know.

717
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,518
-We gotta do something.
-I know!

718
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,869
Hey, you guys all right?

719
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,757
-Yeah, yeah, we're good.
-Yeah, yeah, we're good.

720
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,829
We're just...

721
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,395
-We're good.
-We're just...

722
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,553
Give us a minute.

723
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,629
Talent, you know.

724
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,389
So this is what you've been doing
the last two days?

725
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,391
I guess. I don't know.
I don't remember anything.

726
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,755
-What are we gonna do?
-Just relax, all right? I got it.

727
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,398
We have a problem with the clothes.

728
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,357
-What?
-I know.

729
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,518
I pulled the wrong sizes.

730
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,513
-He's gonna be pissed.
-I know.

731
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,795
Can you just handle it for me, please?

732
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,359
I need him out of here.
Just, whatever you have to do.

733
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,908
-Just get him out of here.
-Great.

734
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,637
-PHOTOGRAPHER: What? What is going on?
-There's a little problem with the clothes.

735
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,871
But they're going to fix it,
and we're gonna have to postpone.

736
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,151
And you're sure
you've never seen these doctors before?

737
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,269
(SIGHS)

738
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,878
No, I don't know.

739
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,035
No. I don't think so.

740
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,032
But you're sure about their names?

741
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,236
Yeah, Hamilton and Carlton.

742
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,829
So...

743
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,910
Have you, like, pinched them and stuff?

744
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,236
-Come on, dude.
-I'm just naturally curious.

745
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,117
No, see, this is why
I didn't want to talk to you about this.

746
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,918
-I'm not trying to be a dick or anything.
-Shut up, you are

747
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,752
-trying to be a dick.
-It's not like I'm ever going to know.

748
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,353
-What's the big deal?
-Just fucking drop it.

749
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,429
Too soon?

750
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,109
Why'd you take the bet?

751
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,759
It was 50 grand.

752
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,797
You should have been able
to sniff this one out.

753
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,431
I thought I had them.

754
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,150
I would've had them, too,
if I had my partner there.

755
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,559
Don't put this on me, all right?

756
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,916
I'm the one that told you to quit hustling.

757
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,879
It just ends up screwing with your game,
or in this case, giving you tits.

758
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,554
What do we do now?

759
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,549
"We", huh?

760
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,635
Come on, Ty.

761
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,276
Well, first thing we gotta do
is track down these doctors, all right?

762
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,748
And get them to take the tits out.

763
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,435
Then, we sue them for everything they got.

764
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,834
-Sound good?
-Yeah, sounds good.

765
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,629
Do me a favour, though.

766
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,469
Don't tell Mandy.

767
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,909
(PHONE RINGING)

768
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,309
What?

769
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,750
(WHOOPING) We're testy, ain't we?

770
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,990
<i>-What is it, that time of the month?</i>
-What?

771
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,435
(LAUGHS)

772
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,317
<i>Oh, it's you. Listen, man,</i>

773
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,789
I really don't have time for this right now.

774
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,917
Oh, I completely understand, Eric.
No problem at all.

775
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,395
Why don't I bust out my scheduler.

776
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,993
Okay, now what time should I
pencil you in for? Shall we say 4:00?

777
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,629
Believe me, you are not
the most pressing issue in my life right now.

778
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,628
Is that so?

779
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,393
Well, then maybe I ought to
make myself more pressing. Hmm?

780
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,436
Try to scare me all you want.
You're not scary to me any more.

781
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,476
<i>Okay? You want to know what scary is?</i>

782
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,995
Try waking up tomorrow morning
with a set of tits, pal. That's scary.

783
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,549
I try to wake up
with a set of tits every day, fool.

784
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,474
What the hell is wrong with this boy?
Ain't nothing scary about that.

785
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,709
I got the address.

786
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,359
-Hamilton and Carlton?
-Yes, please have a seat.

787
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,034
Excuse me! Excuse me!

788
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,398
You can't go in there! Please, stop.

789
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,994
Dude, we should've knocked.

790
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,830
-Sorry, Doctor, I told them.
-It's okay.

791
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,997
Eric, I'm with a patient.

792
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,992
Fuck you, psycho.
We need to talk, right now.

793
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,069
About what?

794
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,910
About what? About these.

795
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,718
Those are exactly what I want.

796
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,195
-Can you excuse me for just a minute?
-Sure.

797
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,316
Okay. Sweetheart,
would you stay with Taylor?

798
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,197
I'm gonna take care of these gentlemen.

799
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,076
-Fourteen-pounders?
-Yeah.

800
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,229
-You like them?
-I do.

801
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,711
Look what the surgeon dragged in.

802
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,198
Wow. Looking good, Eric.
Nice to see you again.

803
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,430
Cut the shit.
You gave me tits, you're taking them out.

804
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,748
Chocolate, boys?

805
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,313
The way we remember it is,
we had a deal, Eric.

806
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,715
Fuck the deal.
You hustled me, motherfucker.

807
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,791
-You hustled me, motherfucker!
-Yo, yo. Chill, chill, chill.

808
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,553
It was a fair bet. You agreed to the terms.

809
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,950
We've got the legal forms in our files.
Signed and witnessed.

810
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,552
-Any soreness?
-Get off me! I don't care what you have.

811
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,598
You performed surgery on me
against my will, dick.

812
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,234
-Yeah, we'll go to the cops!
-Nice to see you, Tyler.

813
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,349
Mr PAHR.

814
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,319
-How do you know me?
-It doesn't matter.

815
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,989
You can do what you want.
You can protest, you can go to the cops.

816
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,116
But the fact remains is,
you signed the release

817
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,475
and we were just performing the surgery
to your wishes.

818
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,872
All right, come on. What's it gonna take
to cover the bet and get them out?

819
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,109
(MOUTHING)

820
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,599
Fifty grand.

821
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,437
-He doesn't have that much.
-Then the hooters stay.

822
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,799
All right, you know what?
I'll just go to another surgeon.

823
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,791
They'll take them out for less than 50 grand.

824
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,393
Might even feel sorry for me
and take them out for free.

825
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,993
Yeah, let's go.

826
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,832
You know what?
That's not like that, actually.

827
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,870
It's a patented procedure
that nobody can perform but the two of us.

828
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,316
In fact, there's not a doctor in the free world
who'd risk his career to even touch you.

829
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,829
Better hope we stay healthy.

830
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,512
And should you decide to go to Mexico
or some other such place,

831
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,353
or, God forbid, take them out yourself,

832
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,191
here's what would likely happen.

833
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,510
(SNICKERING)

834
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,878
-It's upside down.
-There we go. Sorry about that.

835
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,793
Picture your mom's face
as she opens up the mail one day.

836
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,758
Or your dad.
"What has our son done to himself?"

837
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,879
-You don't even know my parents.
-You mean Mr Doug Keller,

838
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,394
majority stock-holder
of Oswald Manufacturing,

839
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,198
charter member
of Champion Creek Country Club?

840
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,555
Imagine the first board meeting.

841
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,839
A crisp white envelope
for each board member

842
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,675
containing a nice eight-by-ten glossy
of the favourite son.

843
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,958
With a sweet set of hooters.

844
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,112
The only modelling you're gonna be doing
is for our next ad campaign.

845
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,077
-Hey, that's good.
-I'm an idea man.

846
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,435
You guys are sick.

847
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,399
Why me? What did I do to you?

848
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,512
You lost a bet, hotshot.

849
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,878
Now, bring us the 50 grand
and end this freak show.

850
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,551
How am I supposed to
come up with 50 grand?

851
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,310
You're a smart kid.
You'll think of something.

852
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,874
Now, why don't you two boys run along

853
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,349
before we send our office manager
out for stamps.

854
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,436
And, Eric.

We're not betting anything away.

1180
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,435
Just think about what PAHR could do
with that money.

1181
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,078
We could pay ourselves salaries.

1182
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,996
So whatever. Let's just go
beat these assholes, keep their money.

1183
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,554
Our money.

1184
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,232
-Come on, Ty. It's one last game.
-Okay.

1185
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,789
-Okay.
-Okay.

1186
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,915
-Let's do this.
-Let's do it.

1187
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,593
ERIC: I'm sorry,
why are you bringing me here?

1188
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,670
TYLER: Joslyn said it was important.
I don't know, man.

1189
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,552
-They're here. Hey, guys.
-Hey.

1190
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:32,832
Come on, we've been waiting for you.
What took you so long? Join us.

1191
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,839
Hey, boys.

1192
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,434
-What's going on?
-Have a seat, Eric.

1193
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,071
Yeah, straddle that bench.

1194
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,274
E-dog, listen, man,
we're seriously worried about you.

1195
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,834
You've been drinking way too much.

1196
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,991
You flat-out disappear.

1197
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,033
It's gotten to the point where you messed up
a very important photo shoot.

1198
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,354
What's up with that jacket?

1199
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,035
And you almost put your best friend
and business partner through financial ruin.

1200
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,917
And you put me and Jason in danger, man.

1201
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,039
Okay, guys. What's going on here?

1202
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,512
Tyler, this is an intervention. We're trying
to help Eric get through his issues.

1203
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,795
-He doesn't have any issues. He's fine.
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

(EXCLAIMING)

1205
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,230
Intervention? Hold on a second.
Hold on. I don't have an issue.

1206
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,869
-Denial.
-See, textbook, man. You got a problem.

1207
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,111
Guys, I really appreciate
what you're trying to do here, all right?

1208
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,918
But Eric and I have everything under control.

1209
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,592
Tyler, no. You're not helping!

1210
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,398
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

1211
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,469
Hold on! Hold on a second!
Everybody just shut up for a second!

1212
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,317
I'm not an alcoholic.

1213
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,069
Well, I am, sort of,
like in a college frat boy kind of way,

1214
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,355
but look, that's not the issue. Okay?

1215
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,959
-These are.
-(GASPING)

1216
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,597
-What the fuck?
-Okay, this is beyond...

1217
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,389
-Okay, don't freak. Hold on a second.
-This is beyond an intervention.

1218
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,710
-Jos, I can explain everything.
-The whole fuck buddy, booty call...

1219
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,756
Wait a minute, that's what you've been
doing the last two weeks?

1220
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,829
No.

1221
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,229
Come on, Big Dog, bust them out again,
man. I wanna see them.

1222
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:10,153
Stay the fuck away from me, Mark.
I'll give you the fucking haymaker, man.

1223
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,676
Look, I really care about you,
but this is really fucked up, Tyler.

1224
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,988
I can explain everything, all right?

1225
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,992
Dude, he's got jiggly titties.

1226
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,117
Jiggly titty, you got that jiggly titty.

1227
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,031
You got that jiggly titty...

1228
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,753
(EXCLAIMING)

1229
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,115
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1230
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,670
-Mark. What are you doing?
-You fucking dick!

1231
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,149
Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

1232
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,437
-You are disgusting!
-Mandy, hold on.

1233
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,031
-Stop it. Stop it.
-What?

1234
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:52,319
I can explain all this.
Look, it's all a big fuck up, okay.

1235
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:57,793
I know I've been cheating, I've been lying
to people, I've been lying to you,

1236
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,078
but the boobs have made me a better person.

1237
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,080
-I know, that sounds really stupid.
-Save it, Eric.

1238
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,033
I came here tonight
because I was worried about you.

1239
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,790
I don't even think you and I
are on the same planet.

1240
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,755
No, no, that's not true. We are.

1241
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,829
(INAUDIBLE)

1242
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,273
(MIMICKING ERIC) "Come on, Mandy,
they're only a C-cup."

1243
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,669
(MIMICKING MANDY) "Only a C-cup?
They're bigger than mine."

1244
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,955
"Why are you so mad? I got them for you."

1245
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,595
"Eric, I said if you got boobs,
they'd have to be a B-cup."

1246
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,513
"I'm sorry,
but four titties are better than two. Right?"

1247
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,388
"No. Oh, my God, Eric,
I am not a lesbian any more."

1248
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,550
"Just touch them one time.
Don't you want to motorboat?"

1249
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,950
No, I'm not into kinky stuff.
Who said I was into kinky stuff?

1250
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,158
-I can't do this.
-Let me explain. Shit.

1251
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,875
Dude.

1252
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,237
Can I get my car keys?

1253
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,071
Thanks, man. The repo man took your car.

1254
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,310
-What?
-I know, I know.

1255
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,115
Get in the car, Vanilla Ice.

1256
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,597
Hey, Mandy. What's up? It's Eric.

1257
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,192
Just calling to see what's up.
Give me a call when you get this.

1258
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:24,509
I'd love to hear from you.
Yeah, give me a buzz.

1259
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,794
Ready?

1260
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,432
What's going on?

1261
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,511
-What is all this?
-What does it look like?

1262
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,919
You guys are on the map.

1263
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,470
And I got San Diego CNTV
to stream the whole thing.

1264
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,473
Why are all these people here?

1265
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,519
-It doesn't matter.
-Really?

1266
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,034
-It works out in our favour, though.
-And how's that?

1267
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,237
Well, you see, Mr Cover Girl
can't hide from this kind of publicity.

1268
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,360
Company stays on top. PAHR goes down.

1269
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,397
Mmm-hmm. Good.

1270
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,871
What's the president of Ash-Whole
doing here?

1271
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,393
If I were you, I wouldn't worry about that.

1272
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,277
I'd be worrying about the double bogeys
coming your way.

1273
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,395
Bogey-bogey.

1274
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,517
He put you up to this.
That's why you want PAHR.

1275
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,113
Put us up to this? No.

1276
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,431
We created this company.
We're the majority stock holders.

1277
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,796
What? You think you are the only two
geniuses that can sell a cotton-poly blend?

1278
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,158
Enough! Get ready to have your asses
handed to you.

1279
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,232
The only ass that's gonna be handed
is yours.

1280
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,472
-Oh, wait. Here's your ass now.
-And here's a spanking.

1281
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:53,155
(EXCLAIMS) Faster. Yeah, smack that ass.

1282
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,356
-CARLTON: Pastor, that hurts.
-Right.

1283
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,195
Anybody hear anything from Mandy?

1284
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,633
She said she had something important to do.

1285
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,233
I haven't seen Mark in two days either.

1286
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,835
Hey, I just found out the answer
to this whole mystery.

1287
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,318
I'm gonna go hit some balls.

1288
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,471
MAN: We're live in three, two...

1289
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,154
Hi, I'm Scott, and welcome to
the first annual Cuda Challenge,

1290

brought to you by San Diego CNTV.

1291
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,834
We're here at the beautiful
Borrego Springs Resort.

1292
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,672
It's a hot one, and tensions are mounting,

1293
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,433
so grab a cold drink,
we're about ready to tee off.

1294
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,999
Fucking golf.
They've got me broadcasting fucking golf...

1295
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,197
(ALL CHEERING)

1296
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,312
An extremely blustery day
here at the course,

1297
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,073
as we get a look at
the PAHR team's secret weapon up close

1298
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,037
to begin the tournament.

1299
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,237
-Hello, Scott.
-We welcome Stephanie to the broadcast.

1300
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,989
Her handlers finally finished with
the Herculean task of applying her makeup.

1301
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:57,113
Now that I can see your crow's feet up close,
I can cancel my trip to the Grand Canyon.

1302
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,349
(LAUGHING)

1303
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,109
Let's do it.

1304
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,678
My back is killing me, dude.

1305
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,590
That's what we're here to fix. Let's do it.

1306
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,638
(FAST MUSIC PLAYING)

1307
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,829
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1308
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,155
Eric.

1309
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,231
Great place to put a fucking tree.

1310
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,559
Oh, yeah.

1311
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,199

1312
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,914

(BOTH GRUNTING)

1315
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:22,550
It's okay, let that one go. It's okay.

1316
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,517
-No, no.
-Don't do this.

1317
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,999
Son of a bitch.

1318
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,872
-What was that?
-I don't know.

1319
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,514
BOTH: Eric sucks at golf. Eric sucks at golf.

1320
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,949
I don't think it's too early to call.

1321
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:07,316
With the docs this far ahead,
I'm putting my money on them.

1322
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,068
We'll be right back.

1323
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,798
What the hell was that?

1324
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,952
-Had to lay up.
-Bullshit. You could've made that shot.

1325
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,635
-No, not today I can't.
-What's the matter with you?

1326
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,157
We've finally got a surefire way of getting
rid of those things and you're blowing it.

1327
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,110
-I was hoping Mandy would come.
-That ship has sailed, my friend. All right?

1328
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,512
You blew your chance with her.
There's nothing we can do about it now.

1329
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,197
Just get your head in the game, Eric.

1330
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,279
Looks like your friend is
getting used to having that rack.

1331
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:45,757
I'm getting the impression that
he wants to keep them forever and ever.

1332
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,839
No, stop. All right.
You can't do this to me, man.

1333
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,599
We're gonna lose if you don't pick it up.

1334
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,989
No, I can't beat these guys
on my own. Okay?

1335
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,594
I know, I'm sorry. It's this thing with Mandy.

1336
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,552
I'm in love with her, Ty.

1337
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,829
-What?
-I know. I don't know.

1338
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:10,789
Ever since I got these hooters,
I don't feel complete without her.

1339
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,069
Okay.

1340
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,469
Let's just not talk about that right now.
I need you to focus, okay?

1341
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,276
I can't. Not until I...

1342
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,473
-Oh, shit. It's my dad.
-What?

1343
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,276
You sent that envelope?

1344
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,957
-Yes, we definitely sent the envelope.
-Yeah, sorry.

1345
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,476
CARLTON: It was just sitting there
with a stamp on it.

1346
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,949
HAMILTON: And it slipped into the box.

1347
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:47,397
-Hey, Dad, I can explain this...
-It's okay, Eric. I know what happened.

1348
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,596
-You do?
-Mandy told me everything.

1349
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,194
Mandy?

1350
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,638
-Hey.
-Hey, you.

1351
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,035
Hey, it's really good to see you.

1352
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,188
I'm sorry I'm late, I just wanted to make sure
your dad understood everything.

1353
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,032
Like I finally did.

1354
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,398
Mandy tells me
you made $50,000 playing golf.

1355
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,749
Yeah.

1356
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,319
Why didn't you just come to me?

1357
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,314
No, I couldn't come to you.
It was my fault. I got in way over my head.

1358
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,675
I was letting golf
get in the way of my classes, and I wasn't...

1359
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,034
Whoa!

1360
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,236
$50,000 from golf?

1361
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,437
Maybe the school is getting in the way
of your golf.

1362
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,039
I mean, it's something to think about.

1363
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,352
Now you better get back in there.

1364
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,518
Unless you plan on keeping those ta-tas.

1365
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,150
Mandy, on the other hand...

1366
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,673
She's a keeper.

1367
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,958
-I'll see you on the 18th.
-All right, Dad.

1368
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,519
Wait, Mandy, hold on.

1369
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,354
Come on, take your shot
or forfeit the hole, Erica.

-Served.
-Psych.

1372
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,111
-You need to go.
-No, I have to say this first. Okay?

1373
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,199
I'm sorry.

1374
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,118
I'm sorry I didn't realise how stupid I was.

1375
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,350
I'm sorry it took you giving up on me

1376
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:14,199
in order for me to figure out
that I can't give up on you.

1377
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,194
None of this means anything now.

1378
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,748
The tits, the golf game,
none of it means anything

1379
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,479
unless I know that we still have a shot.

1380
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,711
None of it matters
unless I know I haven't lost you.

1381
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,714
Eric, you never lost me.

1382
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,672
It's gonna take a lot more than
another set of boobs to come between us.

We can talk more later.

1385
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,639
First, you need to get out there

1386
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,632

how a real man plays golf.

That bold prediction you made earlier
really didn't pan out for you, did it, Steph?

Bite me.

A little right to left, slightly uphill.
