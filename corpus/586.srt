1
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:32,374
They say the great thing about being a kid is,
it's so easy to pretend.

2
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:37,883
You can have a conversation
with your dog, or a baseball, or a banana.

3
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:42,078
Well, what if it wasn’t pretend?
What if you could have a conversation?

4
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:46,420
I mean, not with a baseball or a banana -
that's ridiculous. But with your dog...

5
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:51,395
I mean, we don't have the same concept
of time that, for instance, people do.

6
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:55,059
Because you have watches and clocks.

7
00:00:55,168 --> 00:01:00,265
But we do know that you go away. And it's
not like we don't know that you're gone.

8
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:03,171
So, we don't know exactly how long, no.

9
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:06,871
Why do dogs sniff each other's butts?

10
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,677
Well, that's just kinda
our way of shaking hands.

11
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:14,844
If you really wanna get a sense of
who somebody is, you gotta sniff their butt.

12
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,254
Son. Stop talkin' to the dog.

13
00:01:18,324 --> 00:01:20,588
She doesn't understand a word.

14
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,288
At first his dad thought "Hey, it's harmless."

15
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:28,527
But as time went on, John crossed that
fine line between harmless and just weird.

16
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:29,659
Mr Galvin.

17
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:31,897
- Mr Dolittle.
- This is my son John.

18
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:36,442
- John, this is your new principal, Mr Galvin.
- Nice to meet you, John.

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,877
That's not good.

20
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:45,247
- Nice to meet you.
- John!

21
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:50,145
It was time to put an end to it.

22
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:54,355
Thank you for coming, Reverend.

23
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:07,331
Leave this boy, devil man. Go now, Satan.
Take the serpent's voices with you.

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,434
I command you to come outta this boy.
Come on outta this boy.

25
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,571
God said it. Come on!

26
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:16,842
I'm gonna bite ya.

27
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,141
Get off.

28
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:22,449
Get this dog... get this dog off of me.

29
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:30,685
She was my best friend.

30
00:02:30,763 --> 00:02:34,199
You'll make some real friends now.

31
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:37,964
From that day on, John Dolittle
never spoke to animals again.

32
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:41,336
Someday, you're gonna thank me for this.

33
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:43,671
And after a while all he could remember

34
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,371
was that deep down
there was something missing.

35
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,317
And, just like his dad wanted, he grew up
to be a regular guy. You know, miserable.

36
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,615
Hey! Hey, get outta here.

37
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,363
Stupid mutt.
A vicious animal's in the hallway.

38
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:16,105
Did I mention he was a father? A lot like his
own father, who was a father to him before

39
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,904
he himself became...

40
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:20,542
She's got a giant egg.

41
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:29,350
- Good morning, Charisse.
- I have changed my name to Paprika.

42
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:32,516
Paprika? Paprika Dolittle.
That has a nice ring to it.

43
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:35,959
Not Dolittle. Just Paprika.

44
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:38,963
Well, I don't understand it.
What is that about?

45
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:41,829
You know, Salt-n-Pepa? Paprika?

46
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:46,200
- OK. Paprika. I get it.
- I think Paprika is a beautiful name.

47
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:48,934
Really? I think Paprika
sounds like a seasoning.

48
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:53,803
- Dolittle.
- He doesn't take anything we want seriously.

49
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,745
Tell me about it.

50
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:58,249
I did go over the proposal. It's unbelievable.

51
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:02,287
- OK, I'm on my way in now.
- Maya, where are you goin' with that?

52
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:06,154
- It's for my swan egg I found.
- Looks like it'd be a good omelette.

53
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,361
- It's gonna hatch any day now.
- You'll miss that cos you'll be at camp.

54
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:16,231
I can't go. When a bird hatches, the first thing
it sees, it bonds with it. I want it to be me.

55
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:20,500
You know, it is not healthy for you
to spend all your time with your experiments.

56
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:24,702
An experiment for you would be to spend
time with kids your own age at camp,

57
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:28,076
which is exactly where you're goin'
this Sunday - camp.

58
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,843
And what about my pet egg?

59
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:34,444
Here. Here's half a dozen pet eggs
to take with you to camp.

60
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,250
- Stop it.
- I don't know what all the fuss is about.

61
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:41,384
We went and bought you that thing -
what was that pet rat thing that we bought?

62
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,829
- A guinea pig.
- The thing died. And it's not our fault.

63
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:48,867
It didn't die.
His name is Rodney and he's in my room.

64
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:51,426
So why are you bothering me
about the swan...?

65
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:54,064
- I'm goin' to work. Goodbye.
- Bye.

66
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,405
Have a nice day, everybody. Nice day.

67
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:06,750
Johnny. Gene has got some qualms
about the new proposal. Talk to him.

68
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:10,687
- No room for qualms, Gene.
- No room for qualms.

69
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:14,522
- Qualms are bad.
- Qualms are bad. Listen to Johnny.

70
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:16,959
I have qualms I'd like to discuss.

71
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:21,762
I'm just afraid that if we let a big company
like Calnet take us over,

72
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:24,701
you know, we're not gonna be us any more.

73
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:28,873
- You know? We'd be them.
- Let me explain.

74
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:32,275
"Them" has the best hospitals,
the best labs,

75
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:36,509
and "them" is gonna pay us
a very big, giant amount of money.

76
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:40,313
I swear to God that
when I think about the money, I get teary.

77
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:44,288
- Look at me.
- Those are real tears in his eyes.

78
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:48,691
So Saturday we're sitting down with the
Calnet people. I'm very excited about it.

79
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:53,061
Hey, wait. Whoa. Saturday morning? I'm
supposed to take my family to the country.

80
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:55,191
Well, don't.

81
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:58,065
You see? It's happening already.

82
00:05:58,137 --> 00:06:02,130
- What?
- You're being forced to neglect your family.

83
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,608
Gene, relax. No such thing.

84
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:08,578
- Mrs O'Brien?
- Yes.

85
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:11,946
How are you? Is your tummy still...?

86
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:16,079
Saturday morning, guys.
Gene, no tank tops, please.

87
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:19,022
- Mrs Parkus.
- Yes, Doctor?

88
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,993
- Mrs Parkus. Have you eaten shellfish again?
- Just soft-shell crab.

89
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:25,427
- And what's the middle word?
- Shell.

90
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:29,033
Rodney's lost. He's not in his cage.

91
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:31,399
Y'all get goin'. I'll find your hamster.

92
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:35,235
- He's a guinea pig.
- Whatever. It's a rodent. I'll find the rodent.

93
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:37,433
Hey, Nutmeg, let's go.

94
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:42,572
You better wipe that look off your face.

95
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,639
That's better.

96
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,810
- She's turnin' into a wiseass.
- She's turning into you.

97
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:53,590
You know, there's more to this HMO deal
than money. You sell, they own you.

98
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,752
This will be good for us.

99
00:06:55,828 --> 00:07:01,198
I am so tired of that rap. It's always for us.
But sometimes I don't know who "us" is.

100
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:05,203
What do you mean? Us is us.
Me and you and Maya and Charisse.

101
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:10,834
Lisa, the more money you have, the more
time you can spend with your family.

102
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:15,573
Meanwhile you'll just have to make do with
this fancy sports car you always wanted.

103
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:19,140
- Right here. Beautiful.
- Oh, my God, John. You didn't!

104
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:24,053
No, I didn't. But I saw how fluttery you got,
so don't tell me you don't care about money.

105
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:28,456
- "John, you didn't!"
- That's not funny.

106
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:31,621
So, Daddy, you have to find Rodney.

107
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:35,098
- I'll put down some of that sticky paper.
- No, don't.

108
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:38,864
Don't worry. You peel him
right off it and he'll live.

109
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:44,671
Tell you what. I will turn the house upside
down and I will find Rodney for you. Yes?

110
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:49,407
- And call me if my egg starts to hatch.
- I will call you if your egg starts to hatch.

111
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:32,347
Ma!

112
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:39,323
Let's go. Let's go.

113
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:42,457
Get in there. And you stay in there.

114
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:57,873
Dolittle.

115
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:04,047
Mrs Parkus, do you have a death wish?

116
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:06,353
But I took it out of the shell.

117
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:10,887
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

118
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:15,061
- You couldn't tell what it was without me?
- I knew what it was.

119
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:17,329
She was frightened. She wanted her doctor.

120
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:21,169
- It's a beautiful thing.
- That's a beautiful thing?

121
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:23,298
- How old are you?
- 26.

122
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:28,711
You spend all your time here, right? Probably
grab your naps curled up in the break room.

123
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:31,944
Occasional nooky with
one of the interns in the closet.

124
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:36,920
I have a real life. And I'd appreciate it if you
only called me when it was a real emergency.

125
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:39,890
If a patient comes in
carrying his own head, call me.

126
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,985
Somebody has a bicycle up their ass,
call me. Understand?

127
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:46,758
Yeah, I understand.
So, you want me to give her the injection?

128
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:50,393
I would not be a smartass right now
if I was you.

129
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:55,906
Making little smart statements to me
at two o'clock in the morning after I came...

130
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,184
Is there something wrong, Doctor?

131
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:12,982
No, Mrs Parkus.

132
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,056
There we go.

133
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:18,858
- OK.
- Thank you.

134
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:20,556
You're welcome.

135
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:09,442
Watch where you're goin'
next time, bonehead.

136
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:37,237
Let me start by saying thank you very much
for giving up part of your weekend.

137
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:41,268
We just want to make sure
we can answer any and all of your questions.

138
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:44,407
We want you to be comfortable
with what we're proposing.

139
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:48,749
And, speaking of which,
that explains the details of the buyout.

140
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:53,291
The information you're probably
most interested in is on page four.

141
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:56,692
Wow, four million dollars.
That's pretty comfortable.

142
00:11:56,762 --> 00:12:00,960
- I'm comfortable. You comfortable, Geno?
- I have some questions.

143
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,330
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

144
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:06,670
Are we gonna have to cut back on our staff?

145
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,503
Yes. Unfortunately,
we'll have to make some cuts.

146
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,667
Bread?

147
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,837
No, thank you.

148
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,843
- "No, thank you"?
- Yeah. You offered me some bread.

149
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:22,114
- I don't want any, thanks.
- So you have no problem with staff cuts?

150
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:25,748
- You gonna share that bread?
- You just said you didn't want any.

151
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:29,089
- What is it, some kind of joke?
- Absolutely not.

152
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:31,994
- Bagel chips!
- Back off or you'll find your nuts in a tree.

153
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:33,689
Where's the love?

154
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:37,930
So, John, do you have a problem
with that or not? John?

155
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:41,769
- Watch your head.
- That's enough meeting for me. I gotta go.

156
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:44,399
This was a great meeting. Very productive.

157
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,978
Wonderful meeting.
See you guys on Monday.

158
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:49,980
I'll talk to you later. 'Scuse me.

159
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,314
Johnny's been on call all night,
Mr Calloway. He's very excited.

160
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,789
You gotta move it.

161
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,966
I said let's go. You can't park here.

162
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:15,302
Oh, jeez. Thanks, man.
OK, I'm movin' it. Thank you.

163
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,788
This is ridiculous.

164
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:48,868
Boy, we got some fresh air here.

165
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:52,842
That's the thing about the city.
You don't realise it...

166
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:55,004
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

167
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:58,182
I should've put on my seat belt.

168
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,483
Easy now. Easy now.
Slow your butt down! Whoa.

169
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:08,353
Jeez, Louise! That didn't seem too safe.

170
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:11,185
My back hurt.

171
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:15,495
This is a dream. I'm dreaming right now.

172
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:19,059
Hold it. Stop.
You're talkin' and I understand you.

173
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:25,908
Those guys in my dorm told me that stuff
was safe. 15 years later, this starts happenin'.

174
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:28,502
Let's chill. Let's just chill.

175
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,817
I'm not gonna chill. You gonna chill.

176
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:35,649
- Are you switchin' sides?
- All right, you. Come on.

177
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:39,781
- Hey, I can't drive.
- Out. Let's go.

178
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:43,090
- Need some help?
- No. We're fine.

179
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:46,824
- I'm just stretchin' my legs.
- Ask her if she's got any lettuce.

180
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:51,666
- Shut your little furry mouth right now.
- Are you sure you're OK?

181
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,997
Yeah. I'm fine.

182
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:59,202
- That's good.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

183
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:01,337
- Goodbye.
- Now what?

184
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:05,013
Monster!

185
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,483
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Leave me alone.

186
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:10,954
- What are you, nuts? I'll roast.
- Stay away or I'll kill you.

187
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:15,516
Don't leave me out here. It's hot.
Hey, what kind of doc are you?

188
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:18,425
Hey, doc. This is cruel to animals.

189
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:23,226
Come on. I'm your friend.

190
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,361
I'm your buddy.

191
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:28,064
Reverse.

192
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:34,908
That's it. Back up. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't run over the cage now.

193
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,147
Man, you scared the crap outta me.
See? There it is.

194
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:43,517
Shut up. Shut up right now.

195
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:47,919
Say one more word and I'll leave you
here in the road. Understand?

196
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:49,654
OK, OK, OK.

197
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,928
Stop. Slow down.

198
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,298
Shut up. I can hear you up there. Shut up.

199
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,860
I'm gettin' whisker-whipped up here.

200
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:05,774
One more word and I'm gonna pull over, let
you out your cage and leave you in the wild.

201
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:09,312
See how much you talk
with real squirrels kickin' in your ass.

202
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:11,281
Fine, then I'll sing.

203
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:17,578
- You know it is.
- Turnin' up the radio.

204
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,992
- I can't hear you. I'm groovin'.
- Come on. Let me in.

205
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:27,157
Hey, why they call me guinea pig anyway?
I'm not Italian and I'm not pork.

206
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:34,902
Grandpa, did Daddy learn
how to be bossy from you?

207
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:37,771
Maya, don't talk to your grandfather that way.

208
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,937
He certainly didn't learn it from his mother,
God rest her soul.

209
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:48,146
One day you'll understand that sometimes
your parents do know what they're doing.

210
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,552
- I made it.
- Daddy, what's Rodney doing on the roof?

211
00:16:56,628 --> 00:17:00,120
I thought the fresh air
would do him some good, honey.

212
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:01,927
- Hey.
- Are you OK?

213
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,126
I'm fine.

214
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:04,930
- Hey.
- Lunatic.

215
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,733
Daddy, we still got those BB guns
I used to play with?

216
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:10,274
- Crazy man.
- BB gun?

217
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,774
Psycho.

218
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:15,938
- Son, I think you need a vacation.
- And I'm gonna have one too.

219
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:21,816
This is beautiful. 'Scuse me, honey.
Hey, what's that step called?

220
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:26,217
Let's get rid of Maya's little rat thing.

221
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:31,422
He's a guinea pig.
I don't know why you let him get to you.

222
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:35,557
I goan get gim. I guss... Gugga geggond.

223
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,103
I'm not lettin' him get to me. Not the least bit.

224
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,269
Good.

225
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,780
- I'll be right back.
- Is it all right if I wait in the bed naked?

226
00:17:55,854 --> 00:17:57,583
Yes.

227
00:17:57,656 --> 00:18:00,386
Time to come out of these drawers, then.

228
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,518
Hello!

229
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:05,520
Out here.

230
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:07,292
Yeah.

231
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:10,493
- There you are.
- Oh, my God.

232
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:12,832
Hello.

233
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:17,870
That's right. You're the one
who can hear us, aren't you?

234
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,478
No, I'm not hearing anything.
I can't hear you.

235
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:24,447
The whole woods are talking about you,
you know.

236
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:26,677
Listen, can you do me a favour?

237
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:31,246
Can you just take this stick out of my wing?
It's killin' me. Can ya, huh?

238
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,317
Don't worry. I won't hurt you.

239
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:46,036
Much better. Good job. Thank you.

240
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:52,435
What's happenin' to me?

241
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:56,504
You're gonna be
pleasantly surprised, that's what.

242
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:02,748
- Oh, my goodness. It's an owl.
- Yeah, a big, nasty owl. Let's go in.

243
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:05,288
- It's beautiful.
- They're very dangerous.

244
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:08,292
- No, they're not.
- They are. They can poke your eye out.

245
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,852
- Come on!
- Yes, they can. Very easily.

246
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,865
- Take a finger off.
- What you doin' with that owl?

247
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:18,596
Go get into bed.
I'm gonna go check on Charisse and Maya.

248
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:20,365
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

249
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:23,305
- Are you sure?
- Get to bed. Please?

250
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,309
- OK.
- Five minutes.

251
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:34,076
Crazy man! You havin' fun in there.

252
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:43,391
Can I make a request?
Can I get tuna in oil instead of water?

253
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:45,554
Who put in that bug-zapper?

254
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:51,695
I'm nasty.

255
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:58,175
Yo, looky here. Hey, buddy, my old lady
asks, I been eatin' trash all night. You dig?

256
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:00,336
You're on my tail, you idiot.

257
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:03,210
Got to lose that bug light.
I know you can hear me.

258
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:06,580
Hey, doc, while you're out, get some salmon.

259
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:09,711
- Hey, buddy. All night.
- You broke Mr Stinky, I think.

260
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,348
- Keep away!
- John? What are you doing?

261
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:15,621
- I have to go back to the city, honey.
- Wait! John, why?

262
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:17,957
- John, you just got here.
- I need a doctor.

263
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:21,328
I mean, I am a doctor
and I got beeped, so I gotta go.

264
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:25,165
I'm very sorry, hon. I'll talk to you later.

265
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,731
I love you so much.

266
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:42,379
Come on. Pick up the phone. Pick it up!

267
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:46,857
- Dr Litvack.
- Hello, Sam, how are you? It's John Dolittle!

268
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:51,452
- John?
- How you doin'? So, enjoying your summer?

269
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:55,397
Jeez, it's really late, John.
It's one o'clock in the morning.

270
00:20:55,467 --> 00:21:00,268
Is it really? Wow! I didn't realise it was
that late. I'm sorry. I'm on my way into town.

271
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:05,002
I wondered if you wanted to get together
for a drink or a CAT scan or somethin'.

272
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,408
A CAT scan?

273
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,572
Can it wait till morning?

274
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:11,980
I love you.

275
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,278
No, I have to come right now.

276
00:21:26,264 --> 00:21:28,232
- What's wrong?
- Your face.

277
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,828
- I'll hit you so hard you'll see ten more of me.
- It already smells like ten more of you.

278
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:35,737
Come on. Bring it on. I'll tear you to pieces.

279
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:39,038
- You are tempting fate now, buddy.
- Right here, fat boy.

280
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:41,237
Put it right here. I'll murderise you.

281
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:45,272
- Stick 'em up, you little rat.
- Hey, come here, you gerbil.

282
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,511
- Hey, what are you looking at?
- Me?

283
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:50,520
Yeah, you. Who else, buddy?

284
00:21:50,622 --> 00:21:53,921
I'm lookin' at a couple of greasy rats
fightin' over garbage.

285
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:57,119
Come here and say that,
you four-eyed dufus biped!

286
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,891
I'll get bubonic on your ass. Come here.

287
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:03,861
What if I take that light bulb,
put it between your butt cheeks

288
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:06,165
and make a rodent lamp out of you?

289
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:09,468
Let me tell you somethin'.
I'm a human. I'm a human.

290
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:13,944
Hey. Sam, how are you? How are you?
Thanks for comin' down, Sam. Thanks.

291
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:20,080
- There's no abnormalities of any kind.
- All right, then.

292
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:22,915
- Why are you hearing animal voices?
- Exactly.

293
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:26,287
Why do I think I am if everything is fine?
I tell ya, Sam,

294
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:31,791
I don't wanna wind up like one of these guys
on the street, talking to myself

295
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:35,355
and stinking, with my hair all matted.
It's not a cool look.

296
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:39,494
Have you been under
any unusual stress lately?

297
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:45,304
Not really. My wife's been givin' me
a hard time about Calnet, but that can't be it.

298
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,408
- Small potatoes.
- I did hit a dog the other day.

299
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,378
Oh, my God! A dog?

300
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:55,214
- Hey, make me feel worse, huh?
- Well, I'm sorry, but a little doggie?

301
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,312
- The dog was fine. It got up and ran off.
- He was injured?

302
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,723
He felt well enough to scream out
"bonehead" before he left.

303
00:23:03,094 --> 00:23:07,428
- John, the dog couldn't have spoken to you.
- Well, Sam, with all due respect...

304
00:23:07,532 --> 00:23:12,231
No, John. The dog did not speak to you.

305
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:17,507
Maybe you're right.
I'm sorry I woke you up for this.

306
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,034
Thanks.

307
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:21,908
- Hi, honey.
- Are you all right?

308
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,574
- I'm OK.
- Are you sure?

309
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:26,981
Really. I just freaked out a little bit.

310
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:29,520
- What's wrong?
- I got stress I been under.

311
00:23:29,587 --> 00:23:32,147
- From what?
- The merger and the practice.

312
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:34,521
It's all come to a head, and I'm sorry.

313
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:37,459
OK, John, just come back out here, OK?

314
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:40,531
Yeah, I'm on my w...
Yeah, I'm on my way out now.

315
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:44,732
Bonehead!

316
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:46,930
- I'll see you in a few.
- John?

317
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:48,969
John?

318
00:23:56,948 --> 00:24:01,681
- 'Scuse me. Where's the stray dogs?
- Right this way.

319
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:06,616
- Yo!
- What's up?

320
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,753
Hey, buddy.

321
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,421
Over here.

322
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:16,558
Hey, mister.
Bet you I won't bite nobody again.

323
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:20,028
I am Keyser Soze.

324
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:23,097
I have owners.
They've just been out of town for a few...

325
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,301
...a few years.

326
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:29,908
- Dead dog walkin'.
- That does not sound good.

327
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:34,213
When are we gonna get
some decent chow in here?

328
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,446
Hey, thanks a lot. Whoa, that was close, huh?

329
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:41,390
Hey, hey, you got kids?
Kids, they're the greatest.

330
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:44,986
- Kids are great! What the hell is goin' on?
- Hey, you understood me.

331
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:48,294
You don't say.
How come I can understand you talkin'?

332
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,664
I don't know. Maybe you're just weird.

333
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:53,295
Hey, shut up. You're a dog. Dogs can't talk.

334
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:56,067
What do you think barking is?
An involuntary spasm?

335
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:59,008
I don't know what it is.
I know you're not barking.

336
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:01,875
And I'm going to be with my family.
Good luck to you.

337
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:04,141
That's it?

338
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:11,849
It must be that truck exhaust or something.
Oh, no! Everything's going black.

339
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:16,150
It's not good.

340
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,898
Thank you. Oops.

341
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,701
Is that the biggest ass you've ever seen?

342
00:25:32,777 --> 00:25:34,836
Lie down.

343
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:39,782
Lie down. Lie down, Chauncy.

344
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:45,755
- He's deaf.
- I'm not. I just can't stand listening to her.

345
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:50,191
Just don't fix me, OK? Please. Don't fix me.

346
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:53,657
I won't look at another female ever, I swear.

347
00:25:53,731 --> 00:25:58,998
Anything but my manhood, man.
Not my manhood, please! I'm...

348
00:25:59,604 --> 00:26:03,404
Yo, baby, what's up?
You lookin' sweet there, sugar. Is it the...

349
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:07,274
No. Don't, please.
Please, ju... No, no, no, don't.

350
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:09,539
Please, I'm begging you.

351
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,175
Dolittle.

352
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:15,309
Come on.

353
00:26:23,828 --> 00:26:26,797
So, what seems to be the problem?

354
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:31,335
Well, I really think it's pulmonary distress.
And he might have fluid on his lungs.

355
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:35,202
- Let me guess. You're an MD.
- Yes, I am.

356
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:40,209
I can always tell when a real doctor comes in.
They always do a little amateur diagnosis.

357
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:45,510
- Tell him to get away from my butt.
- I did go to veterinary school for five years.

358
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,916
Is it just me,
or is he hovering around my butt a lot?

359
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:52,946
And unlike an MD,
my patient cannot tell me where it hurts.

360
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:55,652
Seriously,
could you tell him my butt is great?

361
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,321
So, Doctor, if you don't mind...

362
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,591
Hey, where's he's gonna put that?

363
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:05,796
Look, look, I was faking it, OK? I feel fine.
Just don't let him stick that...

364
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,599
Hello!

365
00:27:07,672 --> 00:27:09,970
Let's just have a listen to those lungs.

366
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,942
I'm gonna swallow it.
And I don't mean in my mouth.

367
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:15,639
Dr Fish, I should pull that out a little bit.

368
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:19,615
- Don't you touch that.
- It's headin' in. It's goin' south for the winter.

369
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:25,652
Now, you see? I have to interpret
what the dog is moaning about.

370
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:29,488
What's to interpret?
There's a thermometer. It's in my butt.

371
00:27:29,961 --> 00:27:33,294
- Take it easy. It'll be over in a minute.
- What?

372
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:37,367
- Yes.
- Well, there it goes. Butt just swallowed it.

373
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:43,301
Doctor? I'm just guessing, but I think
you might have just lost your thermometer.

374
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:53,512
It's gone.

375
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:57,318
All right, I have... I have three options.

376
00:27:57,655 --> 00:28:00,783
- One: I can manually retrieve it.
- What's he sayin'?

377
00:28:00,858 --> 00:28:02,917
Options. Retrieve it manually.

378
00:28:03,027 --> 00:28:07,987
- Pass.
- Two: Give the dog a laxative and wait it out.

379
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:10,830
And three: Surgically remove it.

380
00:28:10,902 --> 00:28:13,063
- A laxative or surgery.
- Laxative!

381
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:17,506
Why don't you just give him a laxative?
It'd probably come out later on.

382
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:20,510
- Never works.
- So what would you suggest?

383
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:26,010
I'd like to go in manually.

384
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:33,518
- Here we go.
- Oh, my Lord!

385
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:37,059
This is not good. Lassie go home!

386
00:28:44,902 --> 00:28:49,168
Why on earth would a guy
go into a line of work like that?

387
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:53,904
- All right. That's it for you. Hit the road.
- What? But I'm your pet.

388
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:58,915
You are not my pet. If I were gonna get a pet,
I wouldn't get one as annoying as you. Go.

389
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,343
Hey, don't worry about it.
You sprung me from the joint. I'm thankful.

390
00:29:03,454 --> 00:29:05,945
- Yeah. Just go.
- Don't worry about me.

391
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:09,549
I'll just be goin' down the road,
disappearing without a trace.

392
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:13,196
I hope a car doesn't hit me.
Oh, well, one less dog.

393
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:15,198
- Dolittle.
- Hi, Daddy.

394
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,566
- Hey, baby. How you doin'?
- Am I gonna see you before I go to camp?

395
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:22,469
I'm really workin' on it.

396
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:24,370
Get outta here.

397
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:27,171
- Daddy, is that a dog?
- Yeah, but it's a...

398
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,271
- Mommy, guess what. Daddy got me a dog.
- No! Daddy didn't...

399
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:34,341
Hey. Is that what you've
been up to, you sneak?

400
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,384
You caught me.

401
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:41,424
What? I have allergies.

402
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:44,323
Yeah, I guess we'll see you at camp.

403
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:48,356
Grandpa, Daddy got me a dog.
He got me a dog.

404
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,924
Can you believe it? My own dog.

405
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,567
Hi.

406
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:58,302
- They're gonna want to know your name.
- I don't have one.

407
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:00,936
- We'll have to think of one.
- Let me see.

408
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:05,142
A little girl once called me
"Please, Mommy, not him." How 'bout that?

409
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:09,653
Nah, that's not gonna work.
You got red hair. How 'bout Lucy?

410
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:12,314
Yes, I like that. Lucy. Just one problem.

411
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,019
- I'm a guy.
- Really? How 'bout Lucky?

412
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:19,654
Perfect. Lucky, yes. "Hi, I'm Lucky."

413
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:22,164
Hey, it works on two levels. I love it.

414
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:24,201
Daddy!

415
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:28,398
- That's my daughter. Be nice.
- Oh, you got me a dog. Oh, he's adorable.

416
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,340
Oh, you're such a cute dog.

417
00:30:34,245 --> 00:30:36,236
- What's his name?
- Lucky.

418
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:40,443
- Does he do any tricks?
- He does a neat trick with a thermometer.

419
00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:42,246
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

420
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:46,380
- You got her a dog.
- Yeah, well, I got us a dog.

421
00:30:47,258 --> 00:30:49,351
Are you OK?

422
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:51,252
Yeah.

423
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:53,455
Come on, let's get you all set up here.

424
00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:58,365
- Come on, Maya.
- Look at this nice rabbit on your door.

425
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,870
This is nice.

426
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:04,168
- Yeah!
- What a fun cabin.

427
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:08,503
You smell the air here?

428
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:11,979
What a wonderful place.
What a wonderful camp.

429
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:14,449
Daddy, can I go home with you and Lucky?

430
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:20,414
Hey, Maya. Look, here's the deal.

431
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:24,484
You stay here for a while,
have a great time, then Lucky's all yours.

432
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:27,291
Three weeks is a long time.
Can't I go home with...

433
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:30,265
No. No camp, no dog.

434
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:36,907
- OK, I'll stay.
- You're gonna have a great time.

435
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:42,275
When you get older you're gonna thank me,
cos you'll have so many friends. You'll see.

436
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:44,337
You'll see.

437
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:54,122
- What's the matter with you?
- Everything's goin' by so fast.

438
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:57,717
Don't you dare throw up in this car.
What are you lookin' at?

439
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:00,764
The lines on the road.
They're just whippin' by.

440
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:04,096
Lines. Line, line, line, line, line, line.

441
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:07,569
Don't focus on somethin' so close.
Don't look at the lines.

442
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:09,334
OK.

443
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,932
Tree, tree, tree, tree, tree, tree.

444
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:16,173
Tree, tree, tree.

445
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:19,543
Sir, could you just...

446
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:23,278
Who knew?

447
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:28,950
And not only could he understand me,
but it turns out he's a doctor.

448
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,494
Look. Not even a scar.

449
00:32:31,562 --> 00:32:36,966
And it hurt so bad. I don't know
what I would have done without him.

450
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:39,400
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yup.

451
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:42,939
Oh, what a day.

452
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:45,407
You have knots all over the place.

453
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,071
I'm all messed up. I'm fallin' apart.

454
00:32:52,783 --> 00:32:55,775
- How's that feel?
- Mrs Dolittle!

455
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:58,185
Yeah, baby!

456
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:03,226
- Excuse me one second.
- OK.

457
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:05,591
Excuse me just one second.

458
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:09,759
- Come on. Let's go.
- What a gyp.

459
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:12,962
You mind if I have a little privacy, please?

460
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:16,370
Oh, yeah, but it's fine
when people watch us do it, huh?

461
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,533
Fine to turn on the garden hose.

462
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:21,510
Hey, you want a tip on a good position?

463
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:24,514
- You were barking.
- Well, I'm excited.

464
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:27,415
When I get excited I make all kinds of sounds.

465
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:32,146
- You never barked before.
- Oh.

466
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,060
Hello.

467
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:48,328
- Yoo-hoo, doc. We got trouble here.
- Let's go.

468
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,840
Hey! No. You take the ducks.
I'll take the goat.

469
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:53,240
Me?

470
00:33:53,344 --> 00:33:55,471
All right. I'll get the ducks.

471
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:02,651
What's goin' on?

472
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:07,815
Mark just showed up. So I'm gonna have to
go over the proposal. We have to...

473
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:09,450
- Come on!
- Don't do that.

474
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,997
Lucky wants me to take him for a walk.
So I gotta do that, then I gotta deal with Mark.

475
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:17,466
Great. I'll be the one cooking breakfast.

476
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:19,831
Tomorrow.

477
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:24,633
Hey, Mark! How you doin'?

478
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:27,872
You're trying to destroy my life, all of you.
Aren't you?

479
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:30,846
Freeze! Stop right there. Don't you move.

480
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:35,318
- What are you doin' in the hallway?
- Going to the bathroom. What are you doin'?

481
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:41,253
I'm p-p-patrolling the hallways. I'm the father.
I make sure it's safe while you're asleep.

482
00:34:41,325 --> 00:34:44,021
I patrol these halls.
You wait. Don't you move.

483
00:34:44,495 --> 00:34:49,626
The reason you're up this time of night is cos
you spend too much time drinkin' liquids.

484
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,329
You're old enough to be able to hold it in.
So go on back to bed.

485
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:56,099
But, Dad, I have to go.

486
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:59,705
Lucky's in the bathroom right now.

487
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:02,470
The dog is using the bathroom?

488
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:17,058
Let me make sure he put the seat down.
Then it's your turn, OK? Don't you move.

489
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:23,497
- You heard of knockin'?
- Not one quack. Not one quack.

490
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:33,967
Here's the toilet. It's all down
like y'all like it, ready for you.

491
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:39,779
No little sprinklets on it or anything.
It's waitin' for you to come and do your thing.

492
00:35:40,384 --> 00:35:44,115
- Dad, I don't need adult supervision.
- OK.

493
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,955
- Somebody get this thing off me.
- Come here.

494
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,585
Get this thing off... Whoa.

495
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:53,459
Take it easy.

496
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:59,901
- Night, Dad.
- Night, honey.

497
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,801
Yeah, yeah.

498
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,340
OK, let's go.
See what you almost made happen?

499
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:08,139
What I almost made happen? What did I do?

500
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:10,942
- Beep, beep! We're the sheep.
- Oh, no.

501
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:13,677
- Not these clones.
- Where you goin'?

502
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:16,618
- Move aside.
- Am I late?

503
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:19,212
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Oh, no, no.

504
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:22,486
You gonna have to take your fat ass back...
I don't...

505
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,360
- Oh, my God! What a zoo.
- Obviously not a kosher establishment.

506
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,628
- Everybody, just come in...
- Where are the chicks? I'm cool.

507
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:39,367
Landing! Make way.

508
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:44,610
Very well appointed sty.

509
00:36:47,184 --> 00:36:50,415
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, there's the guy.

510
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:53,251
I don't know. You know, tell a friend.

511
00:36:53,357 --> 00:36:55,985
Looks like they need to talk to a doctor, doc.

512
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,255
Our butts hurt.

513
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:01,356
OK, let's do this.

514
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:04,959
- Watch your droppings.
- This is the house of love.

515
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:08,971
East coast, west coast, let's unite!
Is Brooklyn in the house?

516
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,339
This should take care of the inflammation.
But who'll wipe it on for you?

517
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,173
Does Brad Pitt need a goat?

518
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:18,841
Don't be ashamed.
It happens to most men occasionally.

519
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:22,419
- You're probably under a lot of pressure.
- He's not.

520
00:37:22,486 --> 00:37:25,353
He's not interested because I'm just a pigeon.

521
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:27,390
- But...
- He's a self-hating pigeon.

522
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:30,450
- That is not true.
- Ask him what he does all day.

523
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:32,688
- What do...
- I sit in a tree by myself.

524
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:37,197
He's too good to eat with the rest of us
when the old people feed us in the park.

525
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:40,101
- Can I speak?
- The way he stares at a robin's breast...

526
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:44,834
- It's enough to make you sick.
- I happen to be attracted to orange breasts.

527
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:49,039
You're not a robin. Or a dove or a hawk.
You're a pigeon and I'm a pigeon.

528
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:54,380
I'm sorry. She sits on that nest all day long,
and she just gets a little crazy.

529
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:59,388
May I ask you something? If I turn this way,
don't I look a little like a blue jay?

530
00:37:59,456 --> 00:38:01,856
Poor equilibrium may mean an ear infection.

531
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:10,800
- Or it may be due to this.
- I'm a social drinker. Very social.

532
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:13,234
Stand up. Stand up.

533
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:17,730
- Touch your nose and raise your left foot.
- Nose. Leg.

534
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,276
I don't know. I think you're wasted.

535
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:25,713
- I want to see you walk this line.
- Oh, my goodness.

536
00:38:25,816 --> 00:38:27,443
Ooh-la-la!

537
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:32,287
You have a drinking problem.
I suggest that you stop drinking.

538
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:34,449
- I think you may be an alcoholic.
- Really?

539
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:37,494
- Nobody likes a drunk monkey.
- Sorry.

540
00:38:37,561 --> 00:38:40,894
You're suffering from
obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

541
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:42,089
Throw!

542
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:45,533
Whenever you want the ball,
think about something else.

543
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:48,571
- Just throw the ball.
- Can you relax your mind?

544
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:53,336
This is the way it works. You're the person.
You throw the ball. I'm the dog. I get it.

545
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:56,038
- Look at you goin'!
- I'll pee on your carpet.

546
00:38:56,113 --> 00:38:59,514
- It's very irritating, this ball thing.
- Shut up and throw it.

547
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:05,078
Am I alone here? Am I by myself?
Am I in another universe?

548
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:09,387
- Throw the damn ball.
- He threw the ball. He threw the ball.

549
00:39:09,493 --> 00:39:11,859
I'll get it. Hold on. I'll get it, I'll get it.

550
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:14,523
I love you. I love you. You threw the ball.

551
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:17,129
You can't save 'em all, Hasselhoff.

552
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:19,396
'Ey, is there a doctor in the house?

553
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:22,467
Up here.

554
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:25,906
Doc, they're gonna kick me off the force.
I'm as blind as a bat.

555
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:28,877
- Can you help me?
- Just gimme a minute, all right?

556
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:31,141
- All right.
- Keep it quiet.

557
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,911
Tell me what you think of these.

558
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:40,890
Holy road apples! I can see!
No deskjob for me.

559
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:43,518
- Thanks a million.
- You are most welcome.

560
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:49,622
This is gonna be great. I'll make lieutenant.
Nothing can stop me. Look, a doughnut shop.

561
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:49,900
Wow, what a night. All those animals.

562
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,993
Wow, what a night. All those animals.

563
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:55,731
And I bet that's just the tip of the iceberg.
When word gets around...

564
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:58,969
- Doctor, you must help us, quick.
- What happened?

565
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:01,541
It is all my fault.
I should not have let him out.

566
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:04,308
- Calm down.
- The circus tiger, he will jump.

567
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:07,612
- I told you to stop drinkin'.
- Drinking. I give it up.

568
00:40:07,718 --> 00:40:11,449
- That's better. Let's go.
- Wait for me. You don't know where it is.

569
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:14,315
And now, on the day I end it all,

570
00:40:14,391 --> 00:40:18,919
I'd like to leave Margaret the bearded lady
my rhinestone collar and my wet-dry shaver.

571
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:23,524
I'd like to leave Jack the midget nothing.
It's too late for you. You're a short...

572
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,433
Hey, get outta there.
You're in my landing space.

573
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:29,438
- Man!
- See if you land on your feet, road kill.

574
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,338
Why don't you bloodsuckin' vermin
take a break?

575
00:40:32,743 --> 00:40:34,870
- Blood sucking!
- Look out below.

576
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:37,038
- Hey, Lucky, come on.
- Come on what?

577
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:40,617
- Come on. We gotta go up there.
- Are you crazy? That's a tiger.

578
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:44,643
- I'm jumping now. Don't try and stop me.
- Will you come on?

579
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:47,883
Comin' right up.
One order of man, side of dog.

580
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,657
I need a drink.

581
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:52,854
Goodbye, cruel world.

582
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:57,491
Oh, no, I just remembered.
I wanted to leave the whip to the baboon.

583
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,633
One of the few animals that enjoys that stuff.

584
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:03,502
- Hi.
- Who are you?

585
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:06,571
- I'm Dolittle.
- Yeah, well, get outta here.

586
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:10,909
- I'm in a lot of pain and I'm gonna jump.
- Whoa, take it easy now.

587
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:14,883
- I'm a doctor. Maybe I can help.
- I don't need a doctor. I need a miracle.

588
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:20,719
I'm a train wreck. I have headaches, nausea...
The worst thing is this double vision.

589
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:25,622
What's the use?
It's not like anybody cares about tigers.

590
00:41:25,696 --> 00:41:29,462
Now stop, you're being silly.
There have been lots of loveable tigers.

591
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,626
Yeah? Name one.

592
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:35,464
How about Tony?

593
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:39,100
- Tony the cereal tiger?
- I didn't hear you come up with anything.

594
00:41:41,278 --> 00:41:44,338
Remember that song
"Eye of the Tiger" from Rocky III?

595
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:51,548
That one from Rocky III, when Rocky
was fightin' Mr T, couldn't beat Mr T,

596
00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:54,021
Apollo Creed played "Eye of the Tiger",

597
00:41:54,091 --> 00:42:00,052
he went back and beat the snot out of Mr T
because of that song. It moved him inside.

598
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,429
Not "Eye of the Moose", not "Eye of the Bull".
"Eye of the Tiger".

599
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,764
- That's it. I'm jumping.
- No, no, don't.

600
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:10,329
Jump, you big pussy. I'll catch ya - not!

601
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:14,037
Didn't I say take a break?

602
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:17,274
All right, doc. Then you jump!

603
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:20,839
- Why do you want to help me?
- Because I'm the only one who can.

604
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:25,480
Maybe it's my destiny. And maybe it's yours
to be the one tiger everybody remembers.

605
00:42:25,556 --> 00:42:31,358
- Why else would I be here talkin' to you?
- Cos the monkey can't keep his mouth shut.

606
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:34,863
- Are you gonna let me help?
- What if you can't?

607
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:39,266
- If I can't help, you can eat me and Lucky.
- Yeah, or just him.

608
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:43,966
- Really? Will you take me back to the circus?
- I will take you back to the circus.

609
00:42:44,074 --> 00:42:48,340
All right. But don't think
I wasn't gonna jump, because I was.

610
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,608
Hope you're a better doctor
than you are a singer.

611
00:42:52,716 --> 00:42:58,518
Good job, doc. Although seein'
a tiger jump five stories would've been cool.

612
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:00,819
I heard that.

613
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:01,091
Hey, Dr D. Three o'clock, Calnet. Meeting to
go over the agreement. You gonna be there?

614
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:06,586
Hey, Dr D. Three o'clock, Calnet. Meeting to
go over the agreement. You gonna be there?

615
00:43:06,697 --> 00:43:10,758
You're not gonna believe what I got for us.
Corporate cars - every two years.

616
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:13,325
Why aren't you paying attention to me?

617
00:43:13,403 --> 00:43:18,102
Atlas of Feline Anatomy for Veterinarians.
But, John, we treat humans.

618
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:21,838
Hey, Mark, sit down a second. Just a minute.

619
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:25,642
- OK.
- Do you remember when we started out?

620
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:30,243
We had crummy offices in the worst
neighbourhood and got paid almost nothing.

621
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:32,345
- I've blocked it out.
- Really?

622
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:36,118
- I guess so, yeah.
- Those were the most exciting times to me.

623
00:43:36,193 --> 00:43:40,459
It was like, you felt like
you were making a difference, you know?

624
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:44,432
And last night I had to treat some...
some emergencies.

625
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:47,402
And I was challenged, and it was difficult,

626
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:50,269
and I got the same kind of rush
I had back then.

627
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:53,810
I felt like I was doin' somethin',
like I was makin' a difference.

628
00:43:53,877 --> 00:44:00,043
And I started thinkin' that here I'm not giving
my patients the right amount of attention.

629
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:05,345
Do me a favour. Don't confide in me.
I'm utterly useless. I'm very self-absorbed.

630
00:44:05,422 --> 00:44:07,481
Let's get Geno.

631
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:09,456
Hey, Geno?

632
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,792
You did your job just by pretending
you were listening. It was very helpful.

633
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:15,957
- Any time.
- OK.

634
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:20,901
- Calnet, three o'clock.
- Three o'clock sharp.

635
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:33,574
- This is Dr Fish.
- The author of Feline Illnesses and Diseases?

636
00:44:33,884 --> 00:44:36,045
Yes it is. You've read my book?

637
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,613
Have I read your book? I sleep with
your book next to your bed. It's my bible.

638
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:45,890
Well, some people consider it
the definitive work on cats, but

639
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:49,090
bible? I... I... I...

640
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,599
Well, no, I can... I can see your point.

641
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:56,105
Dr Fish, I have a very very sick,
very very big cat.

642
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,871
I'm concerned it might be serious
because his vision's impaired.

643
00:45:00,944 --> 00:45:03,344
And he seems to be in a lot of pain.

644
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:07,474
Unfortunately,
if it is in the head there's only two options.

645
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:11,612
One is surgery
and the other is putting it down.

646
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:15,821
I have no idea how I'm gonna do this.

647
00:45:15,892 --> 00:45:20,955
- I'm gonna try to take care of you. I promise.
- Just hurry back.

648
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:24,295
Every minute you're gone
I'm one minute closer to death.

649
00:45:24,434 --> 00:45:27,767
I just might hang myself by my underpants.

650
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:30,135
I can get underpants.

651
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,571
Not really.

652
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:35,042
- He blew off the Calloway meeting.
- I don't care about that.

653
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:39,981
I need to speak with John.
You wouldn't believe what's goin' on here.

654
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:46,285
Doc!

655
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,518
You gotta help me. He's dead.
You gotta help me.

656
00:45:50,727 --> 00:45:53,890
- He's not dead.
- Oh, no, no, don't go, old buddy, old pal.

657
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:56,990
- You gotta help him.
- Really? Why's that?

658
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,263
Cos... cos... cos you're the man.
You're the man!

659
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:03,397
Oh? I thought I was the guy
you wanted to get bubonic with.

660
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:06,908
- I'm going towards the light now.
- I was kiddin'. We were riffin'.

661
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:09,946
Serious? Come on!

662
00:46:10,013 --> 00:46:12,538
Goodbye, world. I smell flowers.

663
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:15,881
I'm begging you. Don't let him die.
Don't let my buddy go.

664
00:46:15,952 --> 00:46:18,147
I'm sinking fast.

665
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,885
- John! Where have you been?
- Hi.

666
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,892
- What?
- The meeting.

667
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,588
I had an emergency. Excuse me. Sorry.

668
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:28,528
Excuse you!

669
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:31,726
- Hang in there, brother.
- Does it hurt when I do this?

670
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:34,532
- It ain't no day at the dump.
- If he dies

671
00:46:34,604 --> 00:46:36,765
- I don't know what I'll do.
- He'll eat me.

672
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,638
Only out of respect.

673
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:42,337
Be quiet. I can't hear while you're talkin'.

674
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:44,641
- Sorry, doc.
- John.

675
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,346
He said he was suffering
from abdominal cramps.

676
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,578
"He said"?

677
00:46:51,655 --> 00:46:55,716
I wouldn't be working on this rat
unless it was an emergency. Take a look.

678
00:46:57,794 --> 00:47:01,457
- What happened?
- He's gone into arrest. I don't feel a pulse.

679
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:04,557
- Oh, my God, he's a goner.
- He's not breathing.

680
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:07,068
- Johnny.
- Maybe we should shock him, huh?

681
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:10,970
- I don't know.
- The paddles'll be too big. He needs CPR.

682
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:14,636
- You know how to do CPR?
- I can't even spell it.

683
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:18,146
- OK.
- I can't even look. Doc, no.

684
00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:20,683
- No, Johnny.
- For Chrissakes.

685
00:47:20,784 --> 00:47:25,949
You didn't even wine him or dine him, doc.
I think my friend would rather die.

686
00:47:26,022 --> 00:47:28,081
No tongue, doc.

687
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:32,218
- Come on. I got no pulse.
- Doc, do somethin'.

688
00:47:32,295 --> 00:47:34,661
- John...
- Not now.

689
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:37,097
- Honey...
- Lisa, please!

690
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:41,164
I'm hungry.

691
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:45,572
It's a false alarm. There's nothing wrong
with him. He just has gas.

692
00:47:45,642 --> 00:47:48,702
- Whoa, you're telling me!
- He just had gas.

693
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,115
You're back.
I don't care if you stink. I love ya, pal.

694
00:47:53,216 --> 00:47:56,674
Thanks a lot, little buddy. I felt your presence.

695
00:47:57,521 --> 00:48:00,820
Lisa, stop lookin' at me like that.

696
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:08,524
John Dolittle.

697
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:14,100
Who'd have ever thought
you would end up in a mental institution?

698
00:48:14,204 --> 00:48:17,332
Number one in our medical school class.

699
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:22,071
Not that I'm jealous, John.
Someone had to finish first.

700
00:48:22,145 --> 00:48:25,137
And someone had to finish last too.

701
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:29,314
So, John. You talk to animals now, do ya?

702
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:34,314
Would you like to tell me about it?
Or would you rather tell Bettelheim?

703
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:40,092
- I don't need to talk to your cat, Blain.
- Why? Do you think he'd talk back to you?

704
00:48:40,163 --> 00:48:43,929
- You know, he just might.
- And what would he say?

705
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:46,366
I'd say you were a butthead.

706
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,933
I really like this cat.

707
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,643
He's recommending you stay
a minimum often days.

708
00:48:56,713 --> 00:49:00,740
You really think I need to be here
for that long?

709
00:49:01,785 --> 00:49:04,686
You said that you can talk to animals.

710
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:08,386
You know, I can really hear 'em.

711
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:12,088
I can.

712
00:49:12,162 --> 00:49:14,255
You gotta believe me.

713
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:17,758
I can't.

714
00:49:26,743 --> 00:49:29,473
Here you go. Your medicine.

715
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:33,911
OK, then.

716
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,913
I can get you anything you need.
Saucers, coasters...

717
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,514
Go away.

718
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:44,219
If you have any extra medication
I could use it.

719
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:47,023
You're not following me, are you? Whoa.

720
00:49:48,431 --> 00:49:52,993
- Now, what is all this?
- This is to prove to me and the world

721
00:49:53,103 --> 00:49:55,435
that you can actually talk to animals.

722
00:49:55,539 --> 00:50:00,772
Now, the orang-utan is attached to
this brain-wave monitor.

723
00:50:01,344 --> 00:50:05,007
Normally he responds to
visual stimulation, but

724
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:10,849
since you have got the gift of gab, you won't
need pictures to make him respond, will ya?

725
00:50:10,954 --> 00:50:13,514
Get acquainted, John.

726
00:50:14,824 --> 00:50:19,454
OK, listen. I need your help. I need you
to make that needle over there move,

727
00:50:19,563 --> 00:50:22,657
cos if you don't
they'll make me stay here for ever. OK?

728
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:26,167
So just make the little needle jump.

729
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:29,165
Come on.

730
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:33,266
I know you can hear me now, so don't play.
This is very serious right now.

731
00:50:34,044 --> 00:50:36,979
I guess he's just not a big talker, John.

732
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:41,415
Look, gimme a break. Say somethin', please.

733
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:53,656
Please escort Dr Dolittle back to his room.

734
00:51:01,972 --> 00:51:04,702
Wait. You speak Spanish?

735
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:08,437
That's why he couldn't understand.
He's from south of the border.

736
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:12,709
- Remove him. Go.
- Turn that machine back on.

737
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:14,579
Spanish...

738
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:21,048
I'm worried, John.

739
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:25,458
Who are you trying to fool?
You're worrying about Calnet.

740
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:28,330
John I admit it.

741
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:31,195
I want the money. I'm not ashamed of that.

742
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:34,236
Look, here's what I want you to do for me.

743
00:51:34,304 --> 00:51:37,239
Just stop barking and chirping for one day.

744
00:51:37,307 --> 00:51:39,832
If you do, I'm pretty sure
you can get out of here.

745
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:42,275
And that'd be a really good idea,

746
00:51:42,345 --> 00:51:47,942
because Calloway said if you’re not back
for Friday's press conference, the deal's off.

747
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:52,750
If you would do that for me, Johnny,
I'll buy you a rat farm.

748
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:57,623
And you can... you can burp and fart
the little rats till you pass out.

749
00:51:57,727 --> 00:52:01,254
But let's just get it signed. OK, my shot.

750
00:52:08,471 --> 00:52:10,735
Pick it up. Pick the phone up, please.

751
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,241
Hi. We're nowhere. Leave a message.

752
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,369
Hey. Hi, it's me.

753
00:52:18,481 --> 00:52:21,314
I'm really startin' to miss you guys.

754
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:24,785
I'm startin' to wonder what I'm doin' here too.

755
00:52:24,888 --> 00:52:27,914
Maybe you were right.
Maybe it was all my imagination.

756
00:52:27,991 --> 00:52:30,323
- Hey, honey, feelin' better?
- Who's this?

757
00:52:30,393 --> 00:52:34,853
I'll give you a hint. I'm cute, I'm furry
and I make 500 babies a year.

758
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:37,357
Rodney. Get back in your cage.

759
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:40,994
What's up with that trap behind the fridge?
You tryin' to kill me?

760
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:44,335
Never mind that.
Get your little furry ass back in your cage.

761
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:46,875
Now. I don't want your droppings on...

762
00:52:47,711 --> 00:52:49,576
Bye-bye.

763
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:52,580
My son Rodney.
Little hairy boy, sleeps in the cage.

764
00:52:52,682 --> 00:52:56,709
I have to keep him in the cage
cos he has hygiene problems.

765
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,513
He's not coming back.

766
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:02,958
I can't believe I fell for it.

767
00:53:03,493 --> 00:53:07,395
- Oh, boy, I'm getting dizzy.
- Man, you don't look so good.

768
00:53:07,497 --> 00:53:10,364
Look who's talking!
What do the three of you know?

769
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:13,894
I'm in bad shape.

770
00:53:14,804 --> 00:53:16,328
My head!

771
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:18,533
What kind of a name is Edfora horse?

772
00:53:18,608 --> 00:53:21,600
What kind of a name is Wilburfora man?

773
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:25,112
Peanut butter. That's how they
got the horse to move his lips.

774
00:53:25,181 --> 00:53:28,207
- In the back of the mouth.
- I disagree, sir.

775
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:30,752
- Side. The side.
- Look, look. See his jaw?

776
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:33,152
- See? See?
- The oesophagus, yes.

777
00:53:33,223 --> 00:53:36,124
- He's not talking. That's an act.
- No, no, no.

778
00:53:40,597 --> 00:53:43,031
Finish what you were talking about.

779
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:45,863
- No, he's...
- Full teeth. Full teeth.

780
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:47,561
Doc. Out here.

781
00:53:47,637 --> 00:53:49,832
Doc. Hey, over here.

782
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,141
What are you doin' here?

783
00:53:59,215 --> 00:54:04,278
I crossed three freeways to rescue you,
and all I get is "What are you doing here?"

784
00:54:04,754 --> 00:54:08,087
- This isn't a prison. It's a clinic.
- The tiger's in bad shape.

785
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:10,785
The tiger? Listen, forget the tiger.

786
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:14,762
I had a perfect life until you came along
and started talkin' to me.

787
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:18,095
Now I'm sittin' here in a robe
discussin' Mr Ed with these guys.

788
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:21,193
You've ruined my life enough. Just go away.

789
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:23,705
Just get outta here, please. This is crazy.

790
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:27,033
I get it.
Now it's crazy to want to save a tiger's life.

791
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,840
Listen, tigers die every day.
It's called nature.

792
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:34,179
Let me tell you a little about nature.
I'm a dog, and I act like a dog.

793
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,878
I don't try to be anybody else.
We are who we are.

794
00:54:36,986 --> 00:54:41,389
And you are a doctor who can talk to animals.
That's who you are.

795
00:54:41,457 --> 00:54:44,426
- That is not who I am.
- Stop lying to yourself.

796
00:54:44,494 --> 00:54:47,622
Didn't I tell you to get outta here?
Go. Get outta here.

797
00:54:47,697 --> 00:54:49,460
- Get outta here.
- Fine.

798
00:54:49,532 --> 00:54:52,399
- Stop talkin' to me.
- With pleasure.

799
00:54:52,468 --> 00:54:55,301
You better not come back.

800
00:54:55,905 --> 00:54:58,203
- Bonehead.
- That's all of you.

801
00:54:58,675 --> 00:55:01,041
Leave me alone. Stop talkin' to me.

802
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,670
Ruined his life. That's a laugh.

803
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,894
- OK, Blain, look. I wanna go home.
- So soon? And miss the field trip to the zoo?

804
00:55:29,472 --> 00:55:32,305
Listen.
You've hated me since medical school,

805
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:35,310
but we are both adults now.
Let's put that behind us.

806
00:55:35,378 --> 00:55:38,711
We both have families.
I want to get back to mine. How do I do that?

807
00:55:38,781 --> 00:55:43,275
Well, it's very simple.
Stop talking to animals, John.

808
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:44,445
Simple.

809
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,455
All right, listen.
You're right. I made a mistake.

810
00:55:47,523 --> 00:55:53,120
Maybe it was a case of temporary insanity,
but it's over. I don't talk to animals any more.

811
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:59,331
I'm not convinced.
We'll talk again in a month or so, OK?

812
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:03,169
Tell you what, Blain.
You sign my release form

813
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:08,267
and I won't tell our fellow-doctor friends
about that pink tutu you keep in your closet.

814
00:56:08,344 --> 00:56:10,972
With the thong back.

815
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,718
- Daddy's home.
- Daddy? Hey, Daddy.

816
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:27,695
- Hey, beautiful, how are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

817
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:30,130
- Hey, baby.
- Wh...?

818
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:34,726
- Why didn't you call me?
- I wanted to surprise you.

819
00:56:34,804 --> 00:56:39,002
- Hey, why aren't you in camp, young lady?
- Mom brought her home.

820
00:56:40,043 --> 00:56:42,910
I didn't fit in.

821
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,812
You're just gonna have to try a little harder
next year. Gimme a hug. I missed you.

822
00:56:48,918 --> 00:56:51,409
- Still Daddy's baby, huh?
- Honey?

823
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:53,921
Do they know that you left?

824
00:56:54,023 --> 00:56:59,017
No, I escaped. Of course they know I left.
I'm better. Time to spend some time with you.

825
00:56:59,862 --> 00:57:02,023
Are you not talkin' to me?

826
00:57:02,131 --> 00:57:04,725
- You're sure you're OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

827
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:08,168
Cos I got scared,
wonderin' when you were comin' home.

828
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:13,405
Well, I am back and I'm fine, and everything's
gonna be just like it was in the old days.

829
00:57:13,476 --> 00:57:18,072
I know what you're doin'. Two can play at
that game. I don't have to listen to you either.

830
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:21,150
I was thinkin' maybe
we should get rid of that dog.

831
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:26,450
Comin' home empty-handed! Don't tell me
there wasn't a gift shop at the loony bin.

832
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:31,183
Diane, please call down to Radiology
and get me the x-rays on Mr Galvin.

833
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,094
Also, see if Mrs Rivers
can switch her appointment to 3.15.

834
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:38,099
- I may need Gene for a consultation.
- Yes, Doctor.

835
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:42,427
Gene can you check your schedule
and see if you can do a 3.15 consult?

836
00:57:42,505 --> 00:57:44,439
- Sure.
- Good. And Mark.

837
00:57:44,507 --> 00:57:48,773
- Did you get back the tests on Mr Freeman?
- I think they're comin' in this afternoon.

838
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:51,780
Good. Keep me informed, OK?

839
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:55,443
Hey, doc, do you think
I should get my beak done?

840
00:57:57,687 --> 00:58:01,646
Tell Maintenance we need to put some
permanent screens up, set some traps.

841
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:05,285
This is a doctor's office, not a zoo.

842
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:08,091
He's back. We're gonna be rich.

843
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:16,335
This is where he lives,
and this is where he exercises.

844
00:58:16,439 --> 00:58:20,432
- Does he do aerobics?
- Yeah, the guinea pig aerobics.

845
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:25,345
Let's get this show on the road. Put that thing
away. You're gonna get your dress dirty.

846
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:27,541
Pop, help out. I can't be late for this.

847
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:30,619
- But Rodney wants to come.
- Rodney cannot come.

848
00:58:30,686 --> 00:58:33,883
This is a press conference for people.
No animals allowed.

849
00:58:33,956 --> 00:58:38,325
- Why don't you tell him? He'll listen to you.
- No, I am not going to tell him.

850
00:58:42,432 --> 00:58:44,957
Help out.

851
00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:47,893
Come on, Pop.

852
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:50,564
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yes.

853
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:56,469
When Mommy told me what happened
to Daddy, I wasn't afraid - I was happy.

854
00:58:56,546 --> 00:58:59,947
Because I believed
that he can talk to animals.

855
00:59:00,049 --> 00:59:03,143
Cos I wanted Dad to be weird. Like me.

856
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:06,346
- Is that wrong?
- No. No, it's not wrong.

857
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:09,323
It's just, sometimes
I don't think he likes me much.

858
00:59:09,759 --> 00:59:12,887
Honey, he loves you.

859
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:16,720
I know he loves me. I don't think he likes me.

860
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:20,167
And I really want him to.

861
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:22,499
I'm gonna try to do things his way.

862
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:26,667
And stop doing these stupid experiments.

863
00:59:28,878 --> 00:59:30,937
No, Maya.

864
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:34,011
Don't stop your experiments.

865
00:59:35,184 --> 00:59:40,144
Sometimes daddies are the ones
who need to change.

866
00:59:52,902 --> 00:59:57,965
- Let me park this car.
- All right. Come on, girls. Let's go.

867
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:00,909
Maya. Let me talk to you a second.

868
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:04,174
- We'll be in there in a second.
- OK.

869
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:06,340
Hey, listen.

870
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:10,216
I don't think your egg is a stupid idea.
It's kinda cool.

871
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,048
- You do?
- Yes.

872
01:00:12,188 --> 01:00:15,749
You have curiosity and ideas,
and that's what makes you special.

873
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:19,261
- You mean weird.
- I didn't say weird. I said special.

874
01:00:19,996 --> 01:00:26,026
Being weird's not so bad. A lot of the greatest
people in history were considered weird.

875
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:29,229
- Like who?
- Lots of people. Albert Einstein.

876
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:34,571
With his crazy hair, people thought he was
weird. A guy that smart was weird to people.

877
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:38,410
Muhammad Ali, when he said what round
he was gonna knock out people in

878
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:42,611
and screamed "I'm the greatest."
People thought that was super-weird.

879
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:46,348
- And Joan of Arc, she heard voices.
- Like you, Daddy?

880
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:50,650
Yeah, like me.

881
01:00:51,594 --> 01:00:56,793
Listen, this is what I'm tryin' to tell you.
No matter what happens, you be who you are.

882
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:59,198
And you love who you are.

883
01:01:00,236 --> 01:01:02,295
Cos I love you.

884
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:06,801
Gimme a kiss.

885
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:08,835
Yes.

886
01:01:08,911 --> 01:01:12,005
- You know, you're a great person.
- Oh, thank you.

887
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:15,073
And a weird one too.

888
01:01:15,218 --> 01:01:17,686
- See you inside.
- OK.

889
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,297
That was beautiful, man.

890
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,892
- Lucky! What are you doin' here?
- Do you have a tissue?

891
01:01:35,004 --> 01:01:38,337
Yes, I do.
Right in the back in that pocket over there.

892
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:41,137
Listen. I'm sorry I ignored you
back at the house.

893
01:01:43,145 --> 01:01:46,114
You were the one who said
"Be who you are." You were right.

894
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:52,415
Put me back in touch with the part of me
that I'd forgotten years ago, Lucky.

895
01:01:53,889 --> 01:01:56,881
Can you take it easy?
I'm tryin' to say somethin'.

896
01:01:56,959 --> 01:02:00,451
- Well, then just say it.
- I'm trying to say it.

897
01:02:00,529 --> 01:02:03,657
- What do you think I'm tryin' to say?
- "I love you, Lucky."

898
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:06,293
- That's not what I'm tryin' to say.
- Yes, it is.

899
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:08,462
That is not what I'm tryin' to tell you.

900
01:02:08,537 --> 01:02:12,268
Come on. Deep down inside
that's exactly what you want to say.

901
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:15,276
Come on, now.
You'll feel a lot better. Come on.

902
01:02:15,344 --> 01:02:18,711
Let it out. Go ahead. You know it. I know it.

903
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:21,375
- I love you.
- You love me?

904
01:02:22,518 --> 01:02:24,645
I'm gonna need another tissue.

905
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,917
- Where are we off to?
- We are off to ruin my life.

906
01:02:30,526 --> 01:02:33,086
Wake up!

907
01:02:34,063 --> 01:02:36,930
Hey, doc. You came back.

908
01:02:37,566 --> 01:02:39,761
You need help. I wanna take you for tests.

909
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:43,999
- Tests? That's good, right? Tests?
- Yeah. Come on.

910
01:02:45,941 --> 01:02:48,102
I hate these stairs.

911
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:51,407
Take good care of him, doc. He's our star.

912
01:02:51,514 --> 01:02:53,311
He'll be OK.

913
01:02:53,382 --> 01:02:55,577
- Great. More steps.
- Come on. Get in.

914
01:02:57,386 --> 01:03:00,947
Wait a minute. The dog gets to ride up front?

915
01:03:01,023 --> 01:03:05,187
- Stop looking at me like I'm a side dish.
- Don't flatter yourself.

916
01:03:05,328 --> 01:03:08,354
- Now, you two guys shut up. Quiet.
- Hey, look. Jerry.

917
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:11,025
- Can you keep your voice down?
- He's a big fan.

918
01:03:11,133 --> 01:03:15,729
Hey, Jerry. How you doin', dude?
Just goin' for some tests.

919
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:20,231
I'm fine! "The tiger's fine." I'm sick.

920
01:03:21,644 --> 01:03:24,909
- I told you they'd get away.
- No thanks to you.

921
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:28,848
No? Three armed guards
versus a pigeon - that's a fair fight?

922
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,388
He's not at home and he's not
answering his pager. I'm worried.

923
01:03:35,925 --> 01:03:37,358
- Mom.
- Yes?

924
01:03:37,426 --> 01:03:40,554
Guess who Maya brought to the party.

925
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:43,464
Rodney. Rodney, there you are.

926
01:03:45,034 --> 01:03:47,264
- Man...
- Where the hell is Dolittle?

927
01:03:47,403 --> 01:03:52,238
You know, I just talked to him. He stopped
at an orphanage to take care of a sick child.

928
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:56,175
That is so John. It's so typical of the man.
He just cares.

929
01:03:56,245 --> 01:04:02,480
Weller. Take your lips off my butt
long enough to hear what I'm going to say.

930
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:06,783
If Dolittle's not here in ten minutes,

931
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:09,222
- I'm pulling the plug.
- You won't have to.

932
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:11,657
He's gonna be here in five minutes.

933
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:16,198
- I hope so.
- He will be. He'll be here in five minutes.

934
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:20,058
Hey.

935
01:04:20,169 --> 01:04:24,401
Where's the kitchenette? I gotta get in here.
Where's the food?

936
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:28,634
- Rodney.
- She's comin' to get me.

937
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:31,405
Rodney.

938
01:04:39,422 --> 01:04:43,119
- Who's Rodney?
- Sorry.

939
01:04:48,297 --> 01:04:52,495
This ain't no kitchen. Smell bad.
Must be cookin' chitlins.

940
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:58,065
Now what's this for?

941
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:02,836
Somebody help me.

942
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:09,108
I can't swim.

943
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:13,652
Aaaggghhh yourself!

944
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:23,430
Where you goin'? Get me outta here.

945
01:05:26,902 --> 01:05:32,738
Somebody get the license plate number.
I have just been violated.

946
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:46,649
- This is where you work?
- Come on.

947
01:05:50,459 --> 01:05:55,954
Don't throw that away. That's
the marrow - it's the best part of the bone.

948
01:05:57,132 --> 01:06:00,693
- Look who's here.
- Well, if it isn't Siegfried and Roy!

949
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:01,929
Quiet.

950
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,667
- Lucky, keep an eye out. You rats help him.
- We don't work for you.

951
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:09,336
- Gimme a break. I saved your life.
- That's yesterday's news.

952
01:06:10,312 --> 01:06:12,371
You want gratitude, get a hamster.

953
01:06:12,515 --> 01:06:15,882
"Get a hamster." You kill me!

954
01:06:15,951 --> 01:06:17,578
I gotta get help.

955
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:20,621
Yeah, I got a plate ID on the catnapper.

956
01:06:20,723 --> 01:06:22,588
Do something.

957
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:25,683
The heart of a hawk.
The heart of a hawk.

958
01:06:25,761 --> 01:06:29,629
- A chicken hawk
- The heart of a hawk.

959
01:06:40,242 --> 01:06:42,972
That feels good.

960
01:06:43,045 --> 01:06:47,379
I enjoy my personal relationships
with my patients.

961
01:06:47,516 --> 01:06:50,041
- You'll get over that.
- I just might not.

962
01:06:50,152 --> 01:06:52,313
I'm joking. Gene, I'm...

963
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:59,820
This is the kind of guy who would rather be
trudging through the snow with a black bag

964
01:06:59,929 --> 01:07:02,659
- makin' house calls.
- Exactly.

965
01:07:04,433 --> 01:07:07,061
- That hurt me.
- Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry.

966
01:07:07,169 --> 01:07:10,036
- I may have broken my nose.
- I think I broke his nose.

967
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:12,334
- Is it broken?
- Let me check.

968
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:15,434
Oh, my God! I broke his nose.

969
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:19,570
- Let me take him to X-ray.
- I'm blackin' out.

970
01:07:28,857 --> 01:07:35,023
Thaaaat feeeeels goooood!

971
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:38,999
- This really hurts. I think...
- Of course it hurts.

972
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:41,263
You walked right into a door.

973
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:43,463
Oh, God, I'm bleeding.

974
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:46,803
I'm bleeding.
Do we have any morphine in the vault?

975
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:49,002
- Hey, guys.
- John.

976
01:07:49,378 --> 01:07:51,778
- What happened to you?
- I walked into a door.

977
01:07:51,847 --> 01:07:54,179
- I crushed his septum.
- Really?

978
01:07:54,249 --> 01:07:57,685
Look, this is not really a good time.
I'm kinda

979
01:07:57,786 --> 01:07:59,879
- here with somebody.
- Oh, my God.

980
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:03,857
I-I-I do not approve.
Lisa is a wonderful woman!

981
01:08:05,828 --> 01:08:07,261
- Jesus.
- It's OK.

982
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:09,422
- It's a friggin' tiger.
- He won't hurt you.

983
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:13,830
- I know him.
- Be afraid. Be very afraid.

984
01:08:13,902 --> 01:08:16,393
Oh, my goodness. I have to sit.

985
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:22,308
Here's what we do. We tell Johnny
we're gonna fix his little tiger up

986
01:08:22,411 --> 01:08:24,504
after he signs. OK?

987
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:28,743
Then we'll have him committed.
It's perfect! That way we get our money.

988
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:38,119
It's shifted to the left.
So there's something applying pressure to it.

989
01:08:38,227 --> 01:08:42,425
You can't operate on a tiger.
Especially as you don't know the symptoms.

990
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:47,060
- Double vision and headaches. He told me.
- You'll wind up back at Hammersmith's.

991
01:08:47,136 --> 01:08:49,070
I've been supportive,

992
01:08:49,138 --> 01:08:52,904
but if you expect me to believe
that a tiger told you his symptoms,

993
01:08:53,308 --> 01:08:55,538
I might have to draw the line.

994
01:08:57,646 --> 01:09:00,137
You have to do something. Quick.

995
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:03,548
We gotta get him into OR fast.
It's the only chance he's got.

996
01:09:03,686 --> 01:09:06,780
What about the press conference?

997
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:09,289
20 bucks says this guy never shows.

998
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:12,657
Watch your back.
Trying to get to the operating room.

999
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:18,360
- Outta the way, please.
- Clear a spot. We have an emergency here.

1000
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:21,095
Clear the way, please. Comin' through.

1001
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:25,539
- There you are. Let's do this.
- Mr Calloway, Mark broke his nose.

1002
01:09:25,674 --> 01:09:29,770
- The nose can wait. The press is waiting.
- I-I-I-I...

1003
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:34,315
- We're announcing.
- I really don't know if we should...

1004
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,579
- Where were you?
- I'll explain.

1005
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:42,589
Thank you all for coming,
and thank you all for being so patient.

1006
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:47,355
As you all know, the practice of medicine
and the business of medicine

1007
01:09:47,429 --> 01:09:51,092
have been undergoing
very big changes in this country.

1008
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:55,227
We at Calnet strive to be
at the forefront of these changes.

1009
01:09:55,337 --> 01:09:58,898
That is why I'm proud to announce
the acquisition of...

1010
01:09:58,974 --> 01:10:03,138
This is the life! Hot wings, nuts.
I love nuts.

1011
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:07,709
Oh, my! Live prey.

1012
01:10:14,056 --> 01:10:18,459
- That's a big cat!
- It's all right. It's OK.

1013
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:21,521
It's OK. He's not gonna hurt anybody.

1014
01:10:22,998 --> 01:10:25,057
He's just a very, very sick tiger.

1015
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:28,261
You'd better have a rational
explanation for all this.

1016
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:33,569
Mr Calloway, I don't have a rational
explanation. I wish I did, but I don't.

1017
01:10:33,842 --> 01:10:38,370
Right now I got a sick tiger on my hands. I'm
gonna try to save it. That's all that matters.

1018
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:40,608
Dolittle, you go through with this...

1019
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:47,486
So if you’ll excuse me...

1020
01:10:49,224 --> 01:10:51,988
- Stupid cat. Ruined the party.
- Shut up.

1021
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,893
What do you mean, shut up?
I was gonna do karaoke!

1022
01:11:09,077 --> 01:11:11,807
What the hell is this?

1023
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,713
- No more bacon.
- One, two, three, four.

1024
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:17,911
You ain't gettin' through this door.

1025
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,113
Make love, not war.

1026
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:23,784
Fur is murder. Free Willy.

1027
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:28,262
Pigs go home. Pigs go home. Pigs go home.

1028
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:29,627
Huh?

1029
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:32,131
No, no, not you. The police.

1030
01:11:32,234 --> 01:11:34,464
Wow, this is great.

1031
01:11:34,536 --> 01:11:37,903
- Are you OK?
- The man's comin' down hard, but

1032
01:11:38,006 --> 01:11:41,533
- we're holdin' strong.
- I got such a chill.

1033
01:11:41,643 --> 01:11:44,669
I'm gonna give you a local.
It's not gonna hurt.

1034
01:11:44,813 --> 01:11:47,304
It'll feel like a little bee sting.

1035
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:50,852
A little pressure. That's about it.

1036
01:11:50,919 --> 01:11:53,012
OK? Here I come.

1037
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,514
There you go.

1038
01:11:56,758 --> 01:11:58,692
He can't do this.

1039
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:04,130
- He still thinks he can talk to animals.
- He can, Lisa. He can talk to animals.

1040
01:12:04,233 --> 01:12:07,464
It all started when he was a kid.
I didn't know what to do.

1041
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:10,903
- What are you saying, Dad?
- I thought it was a handicap,

1042
01:12:10,973 --> 01:12:13,066
but it's a gift, Lisa.

1043
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:16,269
Don't you believe it? Look. See for yourself.

1044
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:25,517
I need you to stay alert and tell me if you feel
numbness in your paws or on your right side.

1045
01:12:25,587 --> 01:12:29,853
Have you ever done this operation before?

1046
01:12:29,925 --> 01:12:32,325
Yeah, once in medical school.

1047
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:34,658
But it was to a cadaver.

1048
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:38,723
My professor told me that had my patient
not been dead, he would have lived.

1049
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,397
Very comforting, doc.

1050
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:52,343
It's like Noah's ark out here.
It truly is a remarkable sight.

1051
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:58,148
This collection of animals has prevented San
Francisco's finest from entering the building.

1052
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:01,519
Which is apparently
where the stolen tiger is being held.

1053
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:01,723
OK, we're open. Gene, irrigate, please.

1054
01:13:01,723 --> 01:13:05,090
OK, we're open. Gene, irrigate, please.

1055
01:13:09,231 --> 01:13:13,429
All right, Jake, I need you to be alert.
Tell me if you feel anything at all.

1056
01:13:13,535 --> 01:13:15,628
- Can you feel anything now?
- No.

1057
01:13:15,737 --> 01:13:17,830
Just the same old pain.

1058
01:13:19,174 --> 01:13:23,133
How about now?
You feeling any numbness at all?

1059
01:13:23,211 --> 01:13:26,408
I... I can't. I don't know!

1060
01:13:26,515 --> 01:13:29,382
Just relax and listen to
the sound of my voice, OK?

1061
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:33,785
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared. I'm not gonna let you go.

1062
01:13:33,922 --> 01:13:35,981
John?

1063
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:41,986
- What did he say?
- He said he's a little scared.

1064
01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:27,772
Pulse is dropping fast.

1065
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:31,973
His dura is bulging.
There's too much pressure.

1066
01:14:32,047 --> 01:14:34,607
- My left side went numb.
- Pulse still dropping.

1067
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:38,619
All right. Hey, you just hang in there,
OK, Jacob? Hang in there for me.

1068
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:41,815
- OK, doc.
- It's a blood clot. It has to be.

1069
01:14:41,923 --> 01:14:46,383
All I gotta do is find it. We're too close
to his motor strip. More suction, Gene.

1070
01:14:46,461 --> 01:14:49,794
- We're losin' him. We gotta relieve pressure.
- Come on, Jake.

1071
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:54,325
- Don't let go yet. We're almost there.
- I can feel it.

1072
01:14:54,436 --> 01:14:56,267
- There.
- There?

1073
01:14:56,338 --> 01:14:58,738
OK. OK, here we go.

1074
01:15:04,312 --> 01:15:07,145
It's gone. The pain is gone.

1075
01:15:07,249 --> 01:15:10,446
Blood pressure stabilising.

1076
01:15:10,519 --> 01:15:13,818
It's gone. It's really gone.

1077
01:15:14,122 --> 01:15:16,682
He's OK.

1078
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:26,726
- Thank you.
- You are very welcome.

1079
01:15:26,835 --> 01:15:31,636
You just lay back and relax. We're gonna
have you back in the centre ring in no time.

1080
01:15:36,845 --> 01:15:38,710
Why'd you do that?

1081
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:42,716
If he tries to eat me again, I'm gonna
smack that moustache off your face.

1082
01:15:46,488 --> 01:15:50,185
He's a lunatic.
He has a history of mental illness.

1083
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:52,385
- He's frankly...
- He's the most

1084
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:57,397
- remarkable surgeon I have ever seen.
- He's here to stay.

1085
01:15:57,499 --> 01:16:01,799
- He is the straw that stirs the drink.
- I want exclusive rights to him.

1086
01:16:01,903 --> 01:16:04,599
He's dynamic, caring. I can't imagine...

1087
01:16:04,706 --> 01:16:07,504
- What's the matter?
- Dolittle. Wonderful work.

1088
01:16:07,576 --> 01:16:11,672
- Bravo. Bravo, Johnny. I'm so inspired.
- Welcome aboard.

1089
01:16:11,746 --> 01:16:15,739
- I feel like I bought a winning franchise.
- Yeah.

1090
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:19,416
You haven't bought anything.
We're not for sale.

1091
01:16:19,588 --> 01:16:24,525
Look. We don't need these namby-pamby
wacko freaks. It's you and me,

1092
01:16:25,093 --> 01:16:29,120
- straight to the top.
- You want pigeon? You'll get pigeon.

1093
01:16:34,836 --> 01:16:39,637
- Are ya happy now?
- I'm right behind ya.

1094
01:16:49,117 --> 01:16:51,415
Hey. Somebody come here.

1095
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,114
I think we got birth here.

1096
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:57,852
Hey, hey! Somebody!
I see some shakin' in that egg.

1097
01:16:57,959 --> 01:17:00,154
I see shakin' in the egg.

1098
01:17:00,228 --> 01:17:02,719
Hey, how's it goin', McGruff?

1099
01:17:02,797 --> 01:17:05,197
You know what? A Tic Tac wouldn't kill you.

1100
01:17:05,267 --> 01:17:08,395
Hey, girl, get up. We got birth comin'.

1101
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,597
A swan egg. This is gonna be great.

1102
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:13,163
- Come on, girl.
- One question. What is a swan?

1103
01:17:13,241 --> 01:17:15,971
- That's my egg hatching.
- OK, just breathe.

1104
01:17:16,077 --> 01:17:19,069
Yeah, here it come, the magic moment.

1105
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:22,548
Oh, no. Just like Jurassic Park.
It's gonna kill us.

1106
01:17:22,617 --> 01:17:25,347
My swan egg's hatching. It's hatching. It...

1107
01:17:27,556 --> 01:17:30,150
Good lord, doc. What on earth is that?

1108
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:34,355
That would be Maya's
brand-new baby alligator.

1109
01:17:34,429 --> 01:17:36,294
Cool.

1110
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:38,832
- Momma?
- Momma? I'm not your momma.

1111
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:44,164
- Momma?
- Oh, no, don't look at me.

1112
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:48,801
Although there was that one time
I got drunk in the Everglades...

1113
01:17:50,011 --> 01:17:51,501
Doc, wait up.

1114
01:17:51,613 --> 01:17:54,446
So, you're gonna treat humans and animals.
I love it.

1115
01:17:54,516 --> 01:17:57,178
It's no big thing. We're all basically the same.

1116
01:17:57,252 --> 01:18:01,279
My thoughts exactly. First I want to
move my bowl up on the dining-room table.

1117
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:04,381
Second, no more dog food.
That stuff's just gross.

1118
01:18:04,459 --> 01:18:07,724
I want my own room, with a TV.
Basic cable will be fine.

1119
01:18:08,029 --> 01:18:10,998
I hate stories with happy endings.

1120
01:18:11,099 --> 01:18:12,896
- Yoo-hoo.
- What?

1121
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:16,129
- I didn't say nothin'.
- Then who...?

1122
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:20,106
Run for your lives.
Oh, my God. I don't wanna die.

1123
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:23,109
Hang a left. No, hang a right.

1124
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:29,275
- Legs, do your thing. Outta my way.
- This circle of life really stinks.
