00:00:00,946 --> 00:00:04,781
Power resides where
men believe it resides.

2
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:07,270
I will hurt you for this.

3
00:00:07,597 --> 00:00:11,029
The day will come when you
think you're safe and happy...

4
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:14,959
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth.

6
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:19,812
It's about power.

7
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:21,279
This world has gotten very dangerous.

8
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:26,491
No one is safe.

9
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:29,147
Killing you would send
your brother a message...

10
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:30,373
Grenade!

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,707
It's massive.

12
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:35,149
We will take back what
was stolen from me!

13
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:36,758
It takes you by surprise.

14
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,268
You win or you die.

15
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:42,783
It's war.

16
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:49,453
I think from the first
time Dan and I read

17
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:52,096
George Martin's books we knew
he had taken fantasy to a

18
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,208
different place that
never'd been before,

19
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:55,613
into a more realistic place...

20
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,823
The characters don't feel like
they're in... they're locked

21
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,861
in the eternal struggle
of good and evil.

22
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:04,181
They feel like real people wrapped into
live in a world that's not our world,

23
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:06,049
the world where magic still exists.

24
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:12,329
It's a much more adult, grounded
and psychologically complex,

25
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:16,581
it probably has more in common
with many other HBO shows

26
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:18,434
than The Sopranos and Deadwood.

27
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:20,979
I think it's more reality-based
than fantasy, personally.

28
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,490
And maybe I'm a little bit biased
'cause I sometimes see, uh...

29
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:28,393
people of my size, how they are
represented in fantasies,

30
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,036
they're comical and...
I feel like there's some sort of

31
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:33,673
cook-book that they
have to follow in fantasy.

32
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:36,818
With our show, that line
is very unclear.

33
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,640
It would be good to
have you in the field.

34
00:01:40,753 --> 00:01:42,451
Competition has become a little stale.

35
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:46,186
I don't fight in tournaments.

36
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:47,961
But that's why when I fight
a man for real

37
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,957
I don't want them to
know what I can do.

38
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:54,729
My character is a Lannister.
And the Lannister family

39
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,184
is the most powerful, the
strongest family in all the kingdoms.

40
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,946
They come from amazing privilege.

41
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:05,279
It's sort of "mess them up a little bit"
in terms of how they should be treated.

42
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:06,858
Starks are enemies.

43
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:10,392
Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.

44
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,813
Starks are one of the oldest families
in Westeros and they have a

45
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,639
very strong code. They take a lot
of proud in being Northerners.

46
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:19,845
South is the place you'd really rather live.
It's Southern California opposed to Alaska

47
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,981
and for the Starks their
motto is "Winter Is Coming".

48
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:26,275
Metaphorical in the sense that things
are always gonna get worse.

49
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,323
A guardsman just
rode in from the hills.

50
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:31,008
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

51
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,060
They've maintained power in
the North for thousands of years

52
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,510
and they really have the respect
of the people they lead,

53
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:39,096
and part of that means if someone
needs to be executed for instance,

54
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,086
you don't have an executioner do it,

55
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:43,387
you do it yourself because
that's the Stark way.

56
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:44,572
Don't look away.

57
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,104
You did well.

58
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,004
Jon is not exactly a Stark.
He is a Snow, he's called a bastard name.

59
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:57,582
But he is of the North and his father
is Ned Stark so he's half a Stark.

60
00:02:57,749 --> 00:03:00,183
Bastards get the names derived
on where they are from.

61
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,987
So if you a Northern bastard,
you're a Snow.

62
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:03,589
If you're born in The Riverlands
and you're a bastard

63
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:06,059
you're a Rivers
and so forth and so on.

64
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,459
On one side you have the
not-trained maternal family

65
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:12,775
that you see in a lot of the family
characters but at the same time

66
00:03:12,898 --> 00:03:15,866
the politics of being royal as well,

67
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:18,168
it's kind of really, really fascinating.

68
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,394
Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea

69
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:22,346
and take back your father's throne.

70
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:25,841
The people drink secret
toast to your health.

71
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,585
They cry out for their true king.

72
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:31,386
She's an exiled princess
on the run because

73
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:33,508
her father was used out
from the throne.

74
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:36,030
As she is with her older
brother, Viserys,

75
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:41,634
and he is fearlessly ambitious and he's
been planning his return to be king.

76
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,700
Vengeance is obviously
another driving motivation.

77
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:46,723
This is a ruthless world,
this is a world where people

78
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:50,395
are constantly killing each other
and often they do so to avenge a

79
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:53,335
prior crime and of course
the cycle of avenge is

80
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:56,588
you kill somebody that just means
that now you are the target for

81
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:59,102
the next person in the avenge cycle so

82
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,799
vengeance drives a number
of different narrowed threats.

83
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:05,135
In my dreams I kill him every night.

84
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:09,538
Robert Baratheon came
to power as a warrior.

85
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,913
This is someone who won
the throne through violence

86
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:18,077
and the attempted rebellions will be
dealt with the show of real force.

87
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,264
He has two brothers, one is Renly
Baratheon who is the younger brother,

88
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:24,456
he's never fought in anything. His other
brother Stannis on the other hand,

89
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,878
Stannis is a proving commander,
problem with Stannis is nobody likes him.

90
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:31,066
- Stannis is your older brother.
- We both know what Stannis is.

91
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,301
He inspires no love or loyalty.

92
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:35,927
Very well written characters,
it's the core of the show.

93
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,393
Everyone can relate to someone.

94
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:39,627
Who but you can protect the kingdom?

95
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:43,975
It covers all bases, I think that's why
people get so passionate about it.

96
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,145
They can loose themselves in
these characters and in their stories.

97
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:50,145
Some people hold a grudge,
some people don't.

98
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,563
I'll try to keep you
alive for her sake.

99
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,519
The tension is always so high,

100
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:56,709
and then you can decide for
yourself as an audience member

101
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:58,999
who you believe should have the power.

102
00:05:00,477 --> 00:05:03,728
The first book was written 20
years ago and there's still so much

103
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:06,407
that seems to apply to
what's going on today.

104
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:09,318
When you are writing about
people struggling for power,

105
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:10,961
that's so much of
what drives the world.

106
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:14,018
When you play the game of thrones,
you win or you die.

107
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,092
It's been interesting
working on the first season

108
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,359
and seeing the response to it
and seeing people try to apply

109
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:21,865
things that they saw on
Game Of Thrones to real world events.

110
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:25,056
You have the same power corrupts and
I think that's very true.

111
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:38,767
There was a raven from King's Landing.

112
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Jon Arryn is dead.

113
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:44,821
The King's most important
adviser is called The Hand of the King

114
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,076
and the former Hand has died
under mysterious circumstances,

115
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,228
so King Robert travels north
to ask his most trusted friend

116
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,067
to come back to the capital with him

117
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:55,384
and serve as his chief
adviser, as his Hand.

118
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:59,107
Lord Eddard Stark,
I will name you the Hand of the king.

119
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:03,280
One of the primary conflicts in the
show is when Ned is called south

120
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:08,037
and given no choice, to help out his
best and oldest friend in the world.

121
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:10,243
They were raised together,
they learnt how to fight together,

122
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:13,433
Robert just looks on Ned
as a true brother.

123
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:16,292
I mean, Robert has two brothers
that he doesn't like or trust.

124
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:18,830
But there's no one else out there
that Robert could give

125
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:21,759
that much faith and confidence in,
it had to be Ned Stark.

126
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:24,571
We were meant to rule together.

127
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,123
Ned doesn't want to do it.
He hates politics, doesn't want

128
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:31,295
any part of that, he's a guy who's
spent most of his life fighting in wars

129
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:33,698
and now he really wants to spend
the rest of his life with his family

130
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:35,240
in relative quiet.

131
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:39,978
I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats nest they call a capital.

132
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:42,661
His wife reminds him the last
Hand might have been murdered

133
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:45,990
and he's putting himself into a
very dangerous situation.

134
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:49,087
He ends up going south with
his two daughters and

135
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:51,832
nothing is ever the same after that.

136
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,599
Ned is a very good man,
he's the one we're rooting for

137
00:06:56,703 --> 00:07:02,003
and that's because he is noble,
he believes in doing the right thing.

138
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,187
There's grace on a serving
in the Night's Watch.

139
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:07,210
The Starks have manned the
wolves for thousands of years.

140
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,455
You may not have my name,
but you have my blood.

141
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:15,324
The Night's Watch is a band of men,
who have been guarding the south

142
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:19,184
from what lies beyond
the wall for millennia

143
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:23,666
and what lies beyond the wall in this
day and age is thought to be wildings,

144
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:25,644
and probably not a huge thread,

145
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:29,499
but we know there to be
other things that may be rising.

146
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:33,958
I am ready to swear your oath.

147
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:36,136
Do you understand what
you'd be giving up?

148
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:39,875
The vow for the Night's Watch is
you forsake having children,

149
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,935
you forsake having a wife, you forsake
anything that was from your old life.

150
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:47,511
You give your life to
protecting the realms.

151
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:48,906
Welcome.

152
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:55,358
And Tyrion says to Jon that he's an
outsider as well, they're both outsiders,

153
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:57,663
and you have to arm yourself with what

154
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:00,276
your code'd be, a bastard
or dwarf or little man,

155
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,330
and then it can never
be used to hurt you.

156
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:03,808
Why do you read so much?

157
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:07,329
My brother has a sword
and I have my mind,

158
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,437
and a mind needs books like
a sword needs a whetstone.

159
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:15,269
Tyrion is someone who's always
had an affinity for other outcasts,

160
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:19,464
he'd grow up a dwarf in a society
where if you were born a peasant,

161
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:22,909
and you're a dwarf, your father would
have carried you out into wilderness

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,841
and left you there for the wolves.

163
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,065
Luckily he was born into
a very wealthy family.

164
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:29,551
This is about family and
what family means and

165
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,796
how loyalties and how love
for those around you

166
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:37,824
can make them do things which they
wouldn't necessarily do otherwise.

167
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,906
You're not thinking
of taking the black.

168
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:41,416
What? And go celibate?

169
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:44,163
Cersei just wants him dead,
she loathes Tyrion.

170
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,647
Wouldn't get underneath
her skins, very easily,

171
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:50,263
because we know each other's secrets
and know each other's desires

172
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:53,734
and know how to exploit
that into our advantage.

173
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,083
He's not afraid of his sister.

174
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:57,110
Almost everyone in the
kingdom is afraid of Cersei,

175
00:08:57,194 --> 00:09:01,411
but Tyrion is not and he's known about
her affair with Jamie for a very long time.

176
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:04,361
He fell in love with the
wrong woman in so many ways,

177
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:06,380
in this case he fell in
love with his sister.

178
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:12,157
Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for
300 years to keep the blood line's pure.

179
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,079
Dany has only known what
her brother has told her.

180
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:21,529
She is incredibly submissive and she is
completely dominated by her older brother.

181
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:25,639
She's a princess but she's also
her brother's pawn in being sold

182
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:30,632
into marriage to someone she
perceives as a terrifying barbarian

183
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:32,471
from an alien culture.

184
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,760
You see how long his hair is?

185
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:38,197
When Dothraki are defeated in
combat, they cut off their braids

186
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:40,513
so the whole world
can see their shame.

187
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:44,582
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

188
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,802
She's been married off to Khal Drogo,
a horse lord of the Dothraki,

189
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,710
and this marriage is purely for
Viserys political convenience,

190
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:54,389
he wants to go back home
and conquer Westeros.

191
00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:56,074
The problem is he
doesn't have an army.

192
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:57,631
And the easiest way for
him to get an army

193
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:01,882
is to get one by marrying off his
sister to a Dothraki horse lord,

194
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:04,973
who has a horde of
40,000 tough fighters.

195
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:08,035
So the deal that Viserys thinks
he strikes is

196
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:12,285
"You get to marry my sister and then you'll
come with me and we'll fight my enemies

197
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:13,820
and conquer Westeros."

198
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,878
The wedding day is not how you'd hope

199
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:18,940
your wedding day would go.

200
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,030
A Dothraki wedding wedding
without three deaths

201
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,857
is considered a dull affair.

202
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:28,932
He's an incredibly aggressive warrior.

203
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:30,678
And he doesn't speak her language.

204
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,025
So first and foremost,
there's a language barrier there.

205
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:37,162
This is her new society and
she's initially repelled by that.

206
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:40,131
But as she starts to travel with them
and ride with them

207
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:43,364
and spend more time with them,
she actually comes to actually admire them,

208
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:45,466
and have a great deal of respect
for their culture.

209
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:51,948
It kinda turns from being a horrific
arranged violent marriage to

210
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,875
a beautiful love story and they're kind of
perfect for each other,

211
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,441
So it turns into something quite gorgeous.

212
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,992
You're not supposed to be here.

213
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:10,829
No!

214
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:15,070
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother...

215
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:18,644
Do you know whose dagger this is?

216
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:23,308
I do. Tyrion Lannister, the Imp.

217
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:27,138
The strongest characters
in the story are female

218
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:29,668
and I like to think of
the dual between the two mothers

219
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:32,520
in the competing families, Catelyn Stark
and Cersei Lannister.

220
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:35,598
They seem diametrically opposed
in many other ways, but

221
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,022
they're both women that are driven

222
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:39,726
to very extreme actions

223
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:40,903
to protect their children.

224
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:43,214
This man came into my house

225
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:46,553
and there conspired to murder my son.

226
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,994
I call upon you to seize him.

227
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:54,964
The wonderful thing for me is that
it's got some strong women in it,

228
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,845
which is wonderful
as a young girl to be playing

229
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:00,245
such a strong female role.

230
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:03,667
I've heard the show
be referred to as feminist.

231
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:06,056
We have characters
such as Cersei the Queen,

232
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:09,329
Daenerys, the exiled princess,
who find their strength

233
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,191
through being wronged.

234
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,603
And then some of
the possibly strongest characters

235
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:16,128
and the most brutal in a lot of ways.

236
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:19,392
The next time

237
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:21,358
you raise a hand to me,

238
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:24,400
will be the last time you have hands.

239
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:27,513
This is the first time
that she starts to take matters

240
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:30,471
into her own hands and she starts
to kinda see who she could become.

241
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,688
She sees something in Khal Drogo

242
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:36,035
that gives her the courage
to make the best of this situation.

243
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,423
A Targaryen of the head of a Dothraki army!

244
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:41,817
The Narrow Sea lies between us.

245
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:43,971
Ned is a very straightforward person

246
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:47,850
and finds himself dealing
with backstabbers and double-dealers.

247
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,451
No matter how effective
he is at being Ned Stark

248
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,612
he's really not very well
equipped to handle them.

249
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,548
We've come to a dangerous place.

250
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:58,164
We must protect ourselves.

251
00:12:58,284 --> 00:12:59,448
Look after one another.

252
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:02,965
Ultimately, those qualities
that we consider positive qualities

253
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:04,735
become liabilities for him.

254
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:07,154
- I'm looking for my brother.
- You kill me,

255
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:08,449
your brother is a dead man.

256
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:09,851
He loves Tyrion.

257
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,336
And I think that it's mutual.

258
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:16,166
They're both Lannisters and they like
to play with people's ideas of them.

259
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:18,031
Have you ever heard the phrase

260
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,497
"Rich as a Lannister"?

261
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:22,421
Of course you have,

262
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,178
You're a smart man.

263
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:28,481
I was falsely accused of attempted murder.

264
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:32,093
They kept me
at the Eyrie, in a sky cell and

265
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:35,556
and the fourth wall of the cell
is basically a cliff...

266
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:39,302
The show is often about the misuse
and abuse of power

267
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:42,099
and what happens when people end up with

268
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:45,765
a power that they're not really fit
to wield and what can go wrong...

269
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:48,701
Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son.

270
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:54,819
Robert Baratheon dies and
his young unfit son sits on the throne.

271
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,150
- Bring me his head.
- No!

272
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,489
You hear this kind of whispers
as you start to make the show

273
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,319
"Are you really gonna kill
your lead in the first season?"

274
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:08,276
And we were nervous about that scene
and also couldn't be more excited

275
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:10,985
because it's really the emotional
climax of the season.

276
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:13,361
Ned's death becomes the occasion

277
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:16,421
for the struggle to return
freedom to the North.

278
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,010
That's only the tip of the iceberg.

279
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,160
Jon has a huge dilemma

280
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,824
when he hears what's going on south of the
wall, that his brother is rallying to the war.

281
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:25,599
You took the oath, you can't leave.

282
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:28,183
He didn't expect his family
to be wronged in such a way.

283
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:32,425
I think it takes huge courage
for him to forsake them really

284
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:34,433
and to stick with what his task is.

285
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:38,316
It's a big decision and that creates
who he is going to be in season 2.

286
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:40,676
The world becomes
a much more dangerous place.

287
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,678
An open war started to break out
between Robb and the South.

288
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,848
They're all in danger, always.

289
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,209
The world is gotten darker,
is gotten more violent.

290
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:52,104
None of our characters are
in safe places anymore.

291
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,589
It certainly makes the actors
read their scripts quicker,

292
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,657
knowing that anyone could die at any point.

293
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:58,910
It just keeps you guessing
and it keeps you on your toes.

294
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,035
You never know which family
you're gonna be rooting for.

295
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:04,453
There's such a wide variety
of fans out there.

296
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:07,189
It doesn't just appeal, I think,
to one demographic.

297
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:10,469
What I always wanted is
for the show to not disappoint them.

298
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:13,029
And Dany is such a character that people

299
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,504
either love or hate,
but it's always been positive.

300
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:18,746
Luckily, I had no one who said
"You were rubbish", which is always good.

301
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:19,977
Everyone's just being wonderful.

302
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:22,995
The final image seems to be the one
that people kind of speak about most.

303
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:25,407
People go, "Yeah, I saw that."

304
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,217
I had to guy buy all the books.

305
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:31,589
It's cool. It's amazing.

306
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:34,923
I remember having a conversation
with an HBO executive and saying

307
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:37,968
"You know, this isn't the kind of show
that gets nominated for fans cause

308
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:41,032
they don't like fantasy shows, ***
just doesn't happen."

309
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:43,208
And Dan, my partner said,
"We just got nominated

310
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:46,452
for an Emmy" and it was just...
it was pretty surreal and it was great

311
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:50,159
to see Peter get nominated and so many other
people that worked so hard on the show.

312
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,999
I remember exactly when
they called out Peter's name.

313
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,572
I was definitely shout out, I was so happy

314
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:57,410
for him, I was so happy for the show.

315
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,629
The Golden Globes
is a slightly different event,

316
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:03,311
because there's wine and
champagne on the table, but...

317
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:08,379
when he won, that was also
an amazing experience for everybody.

318
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,210
I mean recognition is really great.

319
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,396
You pretend to be cynical about it,
but it's great

320
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:16,484
when something that you love
and respect and love being a part of

321
00:16:16,604 --> 00:16:18,842
turns into a hit or popular.

322
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:20,955
Um, it's a really great feeling.

323
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:22,750
To have that recognized,

324
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,733
so early on, it's glorious,
it's incredible.

325
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:37,206
The world just got a lot bigger.

326
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,369
By season 2, we're already at war.

327
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,138
So there's no more peace.
Basically, everywhere you go,

328
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:45,629
this world got very very dangerous.
There are more characters and

329
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:47,684
things just got a lot more brutal.

330
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:50,993
We do have a clash of kings,
of several kings and

331
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:54,803
we have a lot of people
who believe they are the rightful king.

332
00:16:54,923 --> 00:16:57,154
Many of the characters that were together

333
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,723
and in one another's presence
in season 1 have been

334
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:01,653
dispersed to the four winds in season 2

335
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:04,400
who is definitely bigger in *** field.

336
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,491
The locations we *** were
so stunning that

337
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,648
they kinda look CGIs.

338
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,633
We went there to not CGI things and

339
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:15,507
I think that makes the show what it is.

340
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:18,204
Everything's done in a very real way.

341
00:17:18,324 --> 00:17:24,037
The ability to go to places like
Malta or Croatia or Iceland to shoot

342
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:29,501
affords us an opportunity to hit
the kind of a realistic note that

343
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:33,815
is never possible no matter how brilliant
the sets are.

344
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:36,292
That affects the actors too.
It puts us there.

345
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:40,313
When you're in a cave up
in the mountains and you're there and

346
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:43,259
you see your own breath,
you don't have to CGI breath.

347
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:46,480
You're cold, so you don't have to act cold.

348
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,713
So it does a lot of the work for you.

349
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,232
We've been able to do it
the way we want to.

350
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:54,702
We've been able to go to all these far
found locations with an incredible cast.

351
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:57,994
I mean, the books have such
a huge ensemble of characters.

352
00:17:58,523 --> 00:18:00,127
And so many of those roles
are really vital.

353
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,169
It's not like if it is a one-man show
with a bunch of side characters.

354
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,742
There are really 20 characters in the show

355
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,997
who all are often the leaders
in their particular scenes.

356
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:12,037
We've got some new characters,
who are fascinating and wonderful

357
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,830
and bring new dimensions and textures and

358
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,866
and bring out new things in the characters
that we already know and love.

359
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:24,933
And again more brilliant women, more
brilliant, strong, feisty, wonderful women

360
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,181
who just gonna dominate.

361
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:28,291
The time to strike is now.

362
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:32,551
The Stark fight the Lannisters,
Baratheons fight each other.

363
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,232
All of our characters are increasingly
dangerous circumstances

364
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,487
and even the characters that
you might think of as villains

365
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,769
in their minds, they are actually
doing the right thing.

366
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,122
It's not all black and white with Jaime.

367
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:47,664
He's got the twists and surprises.

368
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:49,887
Do you think that you can't beat dragons,

369
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,328
but actually the reality of that is that

370
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,075
they are stuck in a wasteland,

371
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:59,148
and whilst having dragons is kind of
the biggest miracle this world has seen,

372
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:02,962
it's not gonna put a roof
over their heads or food on the table.

373
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:06,191
And so that's kind of the first struggle
that you see they're doing.

374
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,703
What you can expect from
this season is more bloodshed,

375
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,792
there's more epic sword fighting,

376
00:19:12,912 --> 00:19:15,215
It doesn't hold back any punches.

377
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:17,889
You're gonna be left on a knife
edge again and again.

378
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:21,651
Not to give too much away,
but the fans who want

379
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:24,918
blood and battle won't be
disappointed in season 2.

380
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:27,442
The cold winds are rising.

381
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:31,615
The war of five kings,
they're calling it.

382
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,361
Nothing matters but how it ends.

383
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:35,999
I heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

384
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,089
That comet means one thing, boy.
Dragons.

385
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,126
Power is a curious thing.

386
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:46,598
It's a trick,

387
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,535
a shadow on the wall.

388
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,345
This is what ruling is.

389
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:55,528
Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out
before they strangle you in your sleep.

390
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:57,559
The king's a lost cause.

391
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,502
It's the rest of us I am
worried about now.

392
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:02,698
You have inherited your father's
responsabilities.

393
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:04,950
- They come at a cost.
- I love her.

394
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,154
- I saw it.
- Whatever it was, you'll see it again.

395
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:12,606
When my dragons are grown,
we will burn cities to the ground.

396
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:35,305
