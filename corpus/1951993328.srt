2
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:28,705
Well done boys.
It looks like ice cold sushi for breakfast.

3
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,607
No, no son. Over here.

4
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:53,160
See the lion, look at  the lion, you get the lion.

5
00:00:57,802 --> 00:01:02,796
Now son, if you are going to grow up and be like your daddy someday
you got to learn how to fight.

6
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:08,422
Alakay, let me show you something, OK?

7
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:11,553
You see this mark?

8
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:16,792
You and me are the same and when you're bigger,
you are gonna be alpha lion just like your daddy.

9
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:19,536
Now, let me see you fight. Ready?

10
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:22,769
No Alakay, no dancing.

11
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,447
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You are a strange kid. You are a strange man.

12
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:32,300
Oh come on, let's try it again.

13
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:39,580
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up
the way you want it to.

14
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:44,679
Oh come on.
You are not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side Zuba. After I...

15
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:50,309
...defeat you and take over as alpha lion,
you will have so much more time
to spend with your pathetic excuse of a son.

16
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:58,046
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you,
why do you even want to become the alpha lion?

17
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:01,389
I am better looking, I have better hair,
I am deceivingly smart and...

18
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,990
I want everyone else to do what I say.

19
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,049
We'll fight on three.

20
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:12,114
One.
Pay attention Alakay.
Daddy gonna show you how it's done.
Two, three.

21
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:36,893
Who is alpha lion?
You are.

22
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,958
Don't you forget it.
And that Alakay is how you attack.

23
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:45,581
Alakay?

24
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:53,001
That's it. Here kitty kitty.

25
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:58,312
Ah, this one is a beauty.
It will be worth a few bucks.

26
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,478
It just gets easier and easier.

27
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:04,435
Daddy!

28
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:08,871
Alakay, Alakay, Alakay!

29
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,646
Daddy!

30
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:16,839
No, no, no!

31
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,250
Alakay!

32
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:33,018
Daddy!
Alakay! Daddy got you, hold on.

33
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:38,592
Daddy!

34
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:55,849
Alakay!

35
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:03,046
Daddy!

36
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,948
Madagascar Escape 2 Africa.[2008].RDQ.DVDRIP.XVID.[Eng]-DUQA 

37
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:17,279
I don't like looks of this guy.
Well, I think he is kind of cute.

38
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,217
I think he is kind of show off.
You think he is cute?

39
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,326
The king of New York City.

40
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:42,109
Alex the lion!

41
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:47,384
I still think he is kind of a show off.
You got to give it to him, the guy is an animal.

42
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,182
Maybe you should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

43
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:56,209
Come on. Where on earth would we go on vacation.
I don't know about you but I wanna go to Connecticut.

44
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:01,413
On the loose,
several animals including the world famous Alex
the lion the king of New York...

45
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:06,584
...escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were finally cornered
in Grand Central Station.

46
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:09,611
It was a very bad kitty.

47
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:14,959
Animal rights activists who convinced zoo officials
to have the escaped animals sent to Africa...

48
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:20,129
...were stunned to learn that
the shipping freighter carrying the animals
was reported missing today.

49
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,148
Tonight hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered
at the Central Park Zoo
to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.

50
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:29,840
The question on everyone's mind:
where are they now.

51
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:11,121
I like to move it, move it!

52
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,784
He likes to move it, move it!

53
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:14,491
She likes to move it, move it!

54
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:15,692
We like to?

55
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:16,700
Move it!

56
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,663
We are gonna miss you little fuzz buckets.
You guys had been a great crowd.

57
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,440
Glad we can introduce you to the toilet.

58
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:32,324
If you ever come to look at Central Manhattan,
feel free to call first.

59
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,897
Seriously no, call. OK?

60
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:41,884
Settle down, settle down everybody. Ssh... Be quite.
You can't leave without this.

61
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:46,567
Hey. Surprise freaks!
Look. Shake it, shake it.

62
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:51,737
Yeah, I am a lady, I am a lady everyone.
I am a lady.

63
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:57,247
Not really, it's me, it's King Julien.
Which of you was attracted to me?

64
00:07:57,616 --> 00:07:58,616
Hands up.

65
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:06,387
Hey freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.

66
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:09,867
Oh no, thank you.

67
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:16,759
Yes thank you. It's my plane.
Until I return with the spoils from the new country...

68
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:20,203
...Stevie will be in charge.

69
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:26,989
I don't think they liked that idea so much Julien.

70
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,605
What is that you are saying Stevie?

71
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:31,037
Oh, oh, no!

72
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:38,064
What? Really? No, you didn't say that.
Oh it's not even possible.

73
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:39,399
Stevie says:

74
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:42,108
Let them eat the cake!

75
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:45,175
King Julien wait for me.

76
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:48,583
I'm all packed.
I have such a whole itinerary plan.

77
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:52,343
Oh no. It's Mort. He's so annoying.
Don't let him on.

78
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:56,317
Stop that thing, he is carrying scissors and hand cream.

79
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:02,913
Everybody in quickly. Get in. Get in.
Get in quick. Get in quick.

80
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:06,829
Struts. Checked. Fillets. Checked.
Engine. Checked. Coffee mate. Checked.

81
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:13,459
Oopsie daisy.

82
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:18,478
That is got to be the second biggest slingshot I have ever seen.

83
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,078
But it is got to have to do.
Attention. This is your captain speaking.

84
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:27,176
In the event of a water emergency,
place the vest over your head then kiss your life good bye!

85
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,200
New York City, here we come baby.
[Skipper] ...sit back, relax and pray your personal gods that...

86
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,101
...this hunk of junk flies.

87
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,210
Personal god, hunk, what?

88
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:39,553
We are going sir.
Open the door. I am outside.

89
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:44,901
In case of losing cabin pressure,
please place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expressions from the other passengers.

90
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:49,121
Excuse me miss.
But aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat.

91
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:51,516
No sir.
OK. boys. Launch.

92
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:55,704
Launch.
Launch.
Launch.

93
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:35,781
Melman!

94
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,349
Hey, Mort.

95
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,461
Hi.

96
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,050
That was weird.
Hey, somebody is dreaming ha?

97
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:53,095
I think I just saw Mort on the wing of the plane.
You got Madagascar on the brain.

98
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:58,626
... it was quite a, it was incredible, wasn't it?
I think we will see much more fun
the further way we get from.

99
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:02,695
Yeah, like when you beat me on the butt?
I am gonna take that, that thing you are holding on to...

100
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:08,288
...and I am going to use it, on stage.
So all part of my little actor's salad bar
of emotional tidbits.

101
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,604
Are the butts next to the crutons at the salad bar?
You don't need to be sarcastic Marty.

102
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:18,587
Hey guys, you know, I was thinking.
When we get back,
I might assign up for the breeding program.

103
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:19,388
Breeding program?

104
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:25,398
I think we all reach a point on our lives
when we wanna meet somebody,
you know settle down, have a relationship.

105
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:30,836
I see that.
What? Like, like dating?
Yeah, dating!

106
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:33,683
Other, other...
Other guys?

107
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,637
What do you mean "other guys"?

108
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,423
Darn it!

109
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,537
I'm gonna, what is holding up that beverage service.

110
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:47,716
I'm gonna go and check.

111
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,789
Oh, yeah ya, keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few wings.

112
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,219
Did you see that?
It is so funny.

113
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:58,021
I like laughing.
It is such a nice experience. To laugh.

114
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:08,501
Do you mind going back? This is first class.
It's nothing personal, it's just that we are better than you.

115
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,843
Hey Maurice. I'm awful, hit me, hit me.
Is it Vivaldi?

116
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:15,113
Hey, in flight slave.
Can I help you Mr. Mankiewicz?

117
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:19,685
Bring me my nuts, on a silver plate.
We just wanted to check on the drinks we ordered.

118
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,203
Oh, sorry. We are in a little backed up.
Then I guess I am gonna back to..

119
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:25,852
Hey, what happened to your body?
You are freaking me out.

120
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,810
And can you please go over there please.
Thank you very much.

121
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:34,493
Whatever happened to the separation of the classes.
Yeah, I am sure is all democracy thing is just affeered.

122
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,006
Skipper, look.
Analysis.

123
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:46,031
It looks like a small incandescent bulb
designed to indicate something out of the ordinary.
Like a malfunction.

124
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:49,445
I found it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too sir.

125
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,748
Right. Rico, manual.

126
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,108
Problemo solved.
Sir, we may be out of fuel.

127
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:59,465
What makes you think that?
We lost engine one.

128
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:03,403
And engine two is no longer on fire.

129
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,161
Buckle up boys.

130
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:10,093
Don't look dull. This might get hairy.
Attention. This is your captain speaking.

131
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:13,818
I've got good news and bad news.
The good news is, we will be landing immediately.

132
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,348
The bad news is,
we are crush landing!

133
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:22,464
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice what so ever.

134
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:24,889
But thanks again for choosing air penguin.

135
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,450
Raise your arms Maurice.
It's more fun when you raise your arms like this.

136
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:45,393
I can fly.
This could be it Marty.

137
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:49,224
I just want you to know that
you are truly a one in a million friend.

138
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:53,802
Thanks buddy. You are the best ever.
I know you won't mind when I tell you...

139
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:57,142
Come on. Tell me it, tell me, tell me what?
I broke your iPod!

140
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,942
What!
The button were so small. It made me mad.

141
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:04,106
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna kill you!

142
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:08,600
I love you Gloria,
I always have!

143
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:19,264
Like ah...
Like you love the beach or a good book.

144
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:20,987
Or the beach.

145
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,848
My goodness doll,
you are shaking like a leaf.

146
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,519
Rico, you had your fun.
Haul up!

147
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:40,844
Gear down.

148
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,860
Gently now. You just wanna kiss the ground.
Just a little pack, smooch like a kiss...

149
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:50,554
I said kiss it!

150
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:57,869
Now, just a little break.
Just a touch, a little whisper.

151
00:14:58,994 --> 00:15:00,682
I believe that's checkmate.

152
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:08,686
Immersed emergency landing procedure.

153
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,008
Flaps up! Deploy!

154
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:27,958
Oh, we are here.

155
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,699
What in the world?

156
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,589
What happened to the plane?
OK. I'm OK. OK. I'm alive.

157
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:39,668
See, I can't even sleep for a minute.

158
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:43,466
You know what, this is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.

159
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:47,124
Only two passengers unaccounted for, Skipper.
That's a number I can live with.

160
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,815
Good landing boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly.

161
00:15:51,838 --> 00:15:54,490
Hey, happy slappers.
Is there some reason to celebrate?

162
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,496
Look at the plane.
We'll fix it.

163
00:15:56,496 --> 00:16:01,051
Fix it? How you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lotta duct tape.

164
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:04,918
We should be up and running in say,
six to nine months.

165
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,696
Sixty nine months?
No! Six to nine months.

166
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:10,686
Kowalski,  I say we use this setback to our advantage.

167
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:12,541
Where do you get,
where do you pull that number out of, huh?

168
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,392
I want you to reconfigure the design, so start reconfiguring!
Great, that's a great... How do you estimate that?

169
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,935
You! Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a tree, maybe find water.

170
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:23,733
Hold on, hold on a second.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?

171
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:27,303
Excuse me.
Fine, you can be in charge. You fix the plane!

172
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:31,472
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK then, I'll remain in charge.

173
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:36,183
Yeah, that's right. You will remain in charge.
You and your little happy friends can stay out of our hair.

174
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:39,208
Correctamundo! Because I decided to.
Good for you.

175
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,624
Yeah, well guess what this discussion isn't over.

176
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:47,797
Higher mammals, you stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and apposable thumbs.

177
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:51,806
Feel crushed
wash your hands out with soap.

178
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:59,508
How, in the.. Hello! are they gonna fix this plane?
You know, grit 'n spit and spit, once spit and griten.

179
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,683
Stick to it at mist.
They don't sound too promising.

180
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:09,610
You're right. Right, we are stuck here.
Hey guys, as long as we're together we'll be OK.

181
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:13,368
Yeah, yeah but love ain't gonna get us home.

182
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:17,757
Behold, the lion!
Hey, it's people.
OK. There is much to see, moving on.

183
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:20,367
People.
Wait, wait.
Wait people.

184
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,145
Hey wait, if you stop we'll autograph those.

185
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,782
I know you.

186
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:36,015
You.
It's that bad kitty.

187
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:45,339
How do you like some other?

188
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:13,545
Right in the batteries!

189
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:16,676
You think that old lady can't take care of you?

190
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,417
Next time I won't go so easy on you.

191
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,570
Thank you dear.
Moving on.

192
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:30,295
Are you out of your mind?
We need their help, and you're arresting little old ladies?

193
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:34,473
Out of my mind? Aha!
Who is out of my mind?

194
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,219
See if you can get an operator?
No problem.

195
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:40,100
Out of my mind?
We're going home.

196
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:58,242
Message A-4: the service user has brought outside
of the coverage area. Please try again later.

197
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,577
Oh my.. Wow...

198
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,757
Am I trappen?

199
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:07,851
All those zebras, like me.

200
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,051
Wait a minute, where are we?
San Diego.

201
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:15,396
This time I'm forty percent sure.
I know this place.

202
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,312
I think this is Africa.
Africa?

203
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:21,533
It's gotto be.
Our ancestral crib.

204
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:25,382
It's in our blood. I can feel it.
No, no. It's more than that.

205
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:29,551
It's like dejavu.
Like I've, like I've been here before.

206
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:36,163
It's like roots.
No, no. It's like dejavu.
Like I've, like I've been here before.

207
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:42,752
How? How?

208
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:52,538
Me, Alex. Me and me friends. Fly. Fly.

209
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:55,282
In great metal bird.

210
00:19:56,476 --> 00:20:03,449
Then. Plummet.
Smash ground. Go boom.

211
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:11,754
Then here. We emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.

212
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:15,377
Is he dancing about a plane crash.

213
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:21,568
Yeah, we just... Yeah. I thought. Sorry.
You mean, you came from off the reserve.

214
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:24,521
Yeah, way off, from the Central Park Zoo actually.

215
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:35,809
Don't strain yourself.
What is going on here, what is all this have about?

216
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:39,997
They say they are from off the reserve.
That's impossible.

217
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:42,169
Only people come from off the reserve.

218
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:46,470
You look familiar, do I know you from...
How could you possibly survived the hunters.

219
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,705
Hunters, we didn't see any hunters.
What are you looking at?

220
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:53,540
Me? Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.

221
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:58,795
So just get out of back to wherever you came from.
OK. Was there a maybe like a manager we can talk to?

222
00:20:59,186 --> 00:21:01,825
Oh, I see.
You're here to challenge me.

223
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:05,193
What? No! No, no.
What else would start you look on to me?

224
00:21:05,193 --> 00:21:08,766
Hold on, Zuba, wait.
Don't call woman, don't you see I am trying...

225
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:10,482
Yeah, yeah...
Zuba. Hold on.

226
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,509
Alakay, is that you?

227
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,469
No, it's Alex. "X",  like New York Knicks.

228
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:23,602
- Zuba, look.
Oh, I have always had that, have had checked it out,
it's really...

229
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:26,167
it's kind of a beauty spot, really.

230
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,487
Mark.

231
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,418
Alright, this is a little weird.

232
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:35,276
Honey, he has come home.
What?

233
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,304
You've come home.

234
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,796
Son.

235
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:54,409
Dad.

236
00:21:56,064 --> 00:22:00,434
Mom and dad.
Mom and dad. Mom and dad.

237
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:01,794
It's my mom and dad.

238
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:07,421
I've got a mom and dad.
My baby is alive.

239
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:12,241
My son.
My son is home.

240
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:25,736
Alakay, yeah. The pathetical son returns.
This is perfect.

241
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:27,950
I thought you hated Zuba.

242
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:32,150
No I do. I do, I do. I hate him. Oh, I do.

243
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:38,079
And I am going to use Alakay.
Yes. I am going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all.

244
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,073
Move out of the way, stand aside.

245
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:51,882
New York. Hmm, it's a bit of a dumb.
Are you sure we are not in New Jersey?
Hello New Yorkers, your new king is here.

246
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:58,463
This calls for celebration.
Maurice, I think they like me.
You got to love a known house to take off.

247
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:01,666
Chaka chaka what?

248
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:12,423
Excuse me, excuse me.
I'm Marty. I'm kind of new around here.

249
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:14,396
Hey Marty.

250
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:20,899
Hey, you are a good looking group.
You like to run?

251
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:29,020
Oh yeah. Running is crackalacking.
That's right, that's right, crackalacking.
You guys are speaking my crackalacking language.

252
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:32,997
What, you don't have doctors here?
Well, not any more.

253
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:38,484
What if you catch a cold?
We go over to the die holes and we die.

254
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,059
OK, you guys really need a doctor.
Hey, we have an opening.

255
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:48,577
Would you be interested?
Me? A doctor?

256
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:56,454
It's raining men, hallelujah.
You are gotto going all.

257
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,915
How come you don't have a man in your life.

258
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:04,896
Listen girls, Manhattan is short on two things:
parking and hippos.

259
00:24:04,896 --> 00:24:09,665
Hey everybody! I just found out that
my son is a king.

260
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:11,809
The king of New York.

261
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:16,809
Show me some of your moves son. Come on.
Don't be bashful.
Alright.

262
00:24:17,142 --> 00:24:19,316
Ooh, this one always knocks them dead.

263
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:25,109
The king is mad, the king is mad.

264
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,117
Now, let's all welcome him back into the pride
above the arms.

265
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:37,843
Welcome to the herd Marty.
Me, in a herd?
I've always wanted to be a part of a herd.

266
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:40,554
It's one for all,
and all for all.

267
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:49,126
How do I look?
Technicly, a traditional witch doctor has a bone to his nose.

268
00:24:50,145 --> 00:24:52,254
Don't worry, it has just a clip on it.

269
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:57,248
Voila, he's a witch doctor.
My mother would be so happy.

270
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:04,845
Look out. I think Moto Moto likes you.

271
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:09,240
Here he comes.

272
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:12,883
I like 'em big.

273
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:14,875
I like 'em chunky.

274
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:16,596
I like 'em big.

275
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,779
I like 'em plumpy.

276
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:20,647
I like 'em round.

277
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:22,537
With something, something.

278
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:26,004
They like my sound.
They think I'm funky.

279
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:28,571
Goodness girl.
You're huge.

280
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:31,174
Who is your friend,
or is that your butt?

281
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:36,310
Girl, you are as quick as you all have to.
So, you are Moto Moto.

282
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:39,092
The name is so nice,
when you say it twice.

283
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:41,937
I kind of a like it that so.
I see you around new.

284
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,139
I won't be hard, because you're so plumpy.

285
00:25:51,644 --> 00:26:01,105
Oops. I hate to be a party pooper Zuba
but some of the other lions are wondering
when you are going to banish your son.

286
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:04,229
What are you talking about, Makunga?
It's nothing really,

287
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:10,250
if their great being about who Alakay
never went through the rite of passage, bla bla bla...
So, technically speaking...

288
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:14,537
...he can't be a member of the pride,
it's nonsense.

289
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:19,146
I had forgotten about the rite of passage.
What is it? What is this rite of passage?

290
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:24,985
It's a traditional common of a ceremony where
young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.

291
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:28,819
Sort of a show skill, talent show, tab dale?
Yeah, sturdiness stuff.

292
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:33,460
Great informers. I think that's up my alley guys.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.

293
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,217
Stud my stuff. Earn my mane.
I want to be Alakuy.

294
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:42,360
Alakay.
Alakay. Even better.
We'll hold the rite of passage first thing in the morning.

295
00:26:42,493 --> 00:26:46,986
That's wonderful. Good luck Alakay.
Where I come from we say: Break a leg.

296
00:26:47,112 --> 00:26:48,958
Oh, that's my boy.

297
00:27:13,194 --> 00:27:15,268
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah.

298
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:17,095
It's amazing.

299
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,107
Guys, this is where we belong.

300
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:26,366
Operation tourist trap is in go.
Oh, I like that one.

301
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:29,216
That's a good one.
That works on many levels sir.

302
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,773
You guys are a bunch of suck ups.
That too sir.
Absolutely.

303
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:33,087
Hide.
Stations.

304
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:35,582
Stage one. Go.

305
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:53,663
Oh no. What've I done.
Come on, take the bait.

306
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,699
Stage two. Go, go, go.

307
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,797
I'll  give him the kiss of life.

308
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:13,392
Rico.

309
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,228
Rico!

310
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,164
Reverse.
Gas.
Music.

311
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:27,116
Oh no, stop. Stop.

312
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,434
Stop. Come back.

313
00:28:33,576 --> 00:28:35,722
What is all that rock'n roll racket?

314
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:43,288
Is she dead?

315
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:44,904
No!

316
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:54,157
You hood ones!

317
00:28:56,511 --> 00:29:00,737
Good heavens. Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocket bag.

318
00:29:01,512 --> 00:29:04,713
Oh, my hand bag. Such a good boy.

319
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:08,985
Man, I can't survive without it.
Wow, you are a one tough cookie.

320
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:11,394
Brownies, root for sixteen. Yonkers.

321
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:16,980
OK. Nobody panic. The best thing we can do is
stay together. We'll wait for another tour jeep.

322
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,297
It may take hours and it's getting dark but...
Where are you going?

323
00:29:21,046 --> 00:29:25,857
I'm not gonna stay out in the opening
get attacked by more animals.
I'm too old to die.

324
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:29,237
I don't know about you guys
but I'm going with her.

325
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:34,315
Please! We need to stay...
together.

326
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:39,819
Fine, we'll go that way.
Does anyone want a hot candy?

327
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:50,495
Easy now.
Watch your step. And this, right here.
OK. Are you ready?

328
00:29:52,606 --> 00:29:55,738
This is where you always slept.
Oh man!

329
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:02,804
Was this mine?
Look at you. Look at him honey.

330
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:08,016
Oh my.
Oh this thing. Look, look. I remember this.

331
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,337
You remember.
Harder than I...

332
00:30:11,337 --> 00:30:14,880
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

333
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:19,500
Was that, was that my?

334
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:24,352
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.

335
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,593
Little bit of paws.
You did that the day we lost you.

336
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,746
Wow. I was so young.
What happened to me?

337
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:41,867
It was all my fault. I turned my back for a minute and...
It was not your fault.

338
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:47,106
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

339
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:53,224
Far off the reserve.
Finally I had to assume that the hunters... Well...

340
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:59,487
We thought, we thought they killed you.
But my son fought those hunters off ha?

341
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:02,721
Don't mess with the king of New York.
That's right.

342
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,472
Alright, alright boys. Be careful.
Watch out before you break something.

343
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:11,406
You used to call this Fufi.

344
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:15,284
Fufi?
Fufi.

345
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:18,052
Oh, he doesn't want that thing.
Give my Fufi.

346
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:25,652
Zuba, you'd better give him his Fufi.
I mean no, thank you, thank you.

347
00:31:26,322 --> 00:31:30,891
It's perfect.
Well son, you get your rest,
you'll have a big day tomorrow.

348
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:35,427
You're gonna need all your strength.
I'm gonna bring the house down for you dad.

349
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,310
I hope so,
otherwise your father would have to banish you.

350
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:44,502
Oh gee, not really?
I know you're gonna do us proud. You know why?

351
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,441
You were born with it.

352
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:54,102
Good night Alakay.
My boy, my own boy.

353
00:31:56,249 --> 00:32:00,569
My son is a king.
My son is a king.

354
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:12,501
Good night mom.

355
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:15,351
Good night Alakay.

356
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:33,143
No sign of civilization.

357
00:32:33,497 --> 00:32:37,681
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.

358
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:44,539
Hey Nana, do you even know where you are going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.

359
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:47,212
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, alright.

360
00:32:49,294 --> 00:32:53,788
It's people. Where do you come from?
How could we get out of here?
Can you help us, we're lost?

361
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:57,538
We are lost too.
It was awful, a flash of black and white never gone.

362
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:01,772
They took the jeep, everything.
That happened to our jeep too.
What are we gonna do?

363
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:06,416
Only hope to survive out here!
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?

364
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:14,293
You can let nature get the best of you,
or you can get the best of nature.

365
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:21,058
Gather around children.
We are New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.

366
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:25,159
We survived in a concrete jungle.

367
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:29,379
If we need food, we hunt for a decent hotdogs stand,
am I right?
She is right.

368
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:33,611
If we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.

369
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:37,431
If we need water, we build a dam.

370
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:45,668
Come on, we're New Yorkers.
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere.

371
00:34:00,294 --> 00:34:03,423
I'm coming King Julien.

372
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,931
Skipper, we have all the parts we need
but we're slightly behind schedule.

373
00:34:26,317 --> 00:34:28,063
How slightly?
Six to nine years.

374
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:31,628
Sixty nine years?
No six to nine years.

375
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:37,180
Privates, what happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday sir. Damn you...

376
00:34:38,258 --> 00:34:42,250
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private, you are coming with me.

377
00:34:43,694 --> 00:34:45,660
Rico, you are coming with me.

378
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:50,197
I'm tracking down to bring them for the court marshall.
That won't be necessary.

379
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,820
We have recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

380
00:35:00,046 --> 00:35:03,350
Floppy of monkeys entered.
I doubt that.

381
00:35:10,102 --> 00:35:16,292
Enough wallin' gagging now let's get to work. We'll divide into three groups.
Group alpha, you are charged in seeping of fabrication.

382
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:20,196
Group Offset, you'll handle assembly.
Group George Report: you'll handle gas services.

383
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:23,960
Any questions?
Good, then let's get to work.

384
00:35:31,516 --> 00:35:34,153
I'd like to kiss you monkey man.

385
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:38,023
Alright but you are so darn ugly.

386
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:48,399
Alright, so little cubs cats, just remember
great dance performance comes from the heart.

387
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:51,320
Just comes straight from your heart and you never go wrong.

388
00:35:53,148 --> 00:35:57,333
Sure Mr.
Hey Alakay, I just happened to walk by and wanted to wish luck.

389
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,411
You're not nervous, are you?
No, it's my thing. You know.

390
00:36:00,764 --> 00:36:05,000
It's kind of what I do.
In my opinion; the key of this whole thing
is choosing the right competitor.

391
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:09,115
Oh, you mean this is like a dance battle, sort of thing?
Like a dance off?

392
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,931
Sure.
Great, I loved that. Freestyle, put your moves out.

393
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:14,564
Who do you thing would be a good match for me?

394
00:36:14,564 --> 00:36:18,260
You know, just to keep the things interesting.
Well...

395
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:23,712
I wish I could help, but that's strictly against to our ancient tradition and although we hold secret but

396
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:28,674
If I was me out there, I'd choose Titsy.
Titsy, OK?

397
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,672
Sounds interesting. Makunga, right?
Thank you.

398
00:36:32,672 --> 00:36:35,371
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go, get him tight.

399
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:36,563
Shake it out.

400
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:03,479
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
Come on baby, make mama proud.

401
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:06,218
Oh woman, I'm trying to take care of passage here.
Got it mom.

402
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:09,807
So who will be the first participant?
Me, me me...

403
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:14,839
How about you, the tall, handsome one?
Right there, yeah. Choose your opponent.

404
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:17,865
Let me see.

405
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:21,242
I guess I'll pick...

406
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:25,180
...Titsy.

407
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:32,078
Titsy? Why did he pick Titsy?
Oh, that's my boy, he got some gumption there.

408
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:35,383
Somebody wake him up, wake him up.

409
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:54,030
Alright, so Titsy. Come on. Let's do this ha?
Come on Titsy fly, Titsy fly, come on let's see your stuff.

410
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:56,850
Bring it.
Let's dance.

411
00:37:57,057 --> 00:38:02,511
OK. But it's only fair to warn you
that I'm a prodigy of fupsy and robbins.

412
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:05,646
Not dance dance, fight.

413
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:08,986
Oh, dance fight. You got it.

414
00:38:15,074 --> 00:38:16,762
Is he dancing?
What is he doing?

415
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,944
I know that boy is not dancing.

416
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:22,047
This is even better than I thought.

417
00:38:24,756 --> 00:38:29,857
Alakay, turn around.
No no pap, it's hop shuffle ball change, hip swish, turn around.

418
00:38:40,163 --> 00:38:43,190
Oh no.
Alakay.

419
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:45,792
Are you hurt?
Oh yeah, I'm.

420
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:51,071
Did I, did I win?
Oh no son, how could, I mean how could this happen?

421
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:55,574
You told us you were a king.
And a king does not get beat.

422
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:59,269
Well, I'm a king.
I'm a king in New York.

423
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,768
It's my stage name.
I'm like a, you know, It's for what I perform.

424
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:08,519
Perform?
No, this is horrible. Alakay has failed the test.

425
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:14,222
Who would have ever imagine that the day Zuba would have to banish...

426
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:18,339
...his own son.
- Zuba, no.

427
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:23,826
Zuba, yes.
Sadly the alpha lion must cast out all failures.

428
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,987
Then, I'm no longer the alpha lion.

429
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:41,247
Dad, what are you doing?

430
00:39:41,835 --> 00:39:44,511
Dad no, you can't do this.

431
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:49,295
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

432
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,657
Anyone? Someone?
No one?

433
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:56,715
Hey.
You sir. I guess not.

434
00:39:57,388 --> 00:40:04,425
Well I, this is all very awkward, but I suppose,
I could carry this tremendous burden.

435
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:08,120
Titsy, get the hat.

436
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:12,940
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay...

437
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:18,003
...he shell wear this hat of shame
and leave the watering hole.

438
00:40:18,356 --> 00:40:21,733
For a thousand years or life...

439
00:40:22,224 --> 00:40:24,864
...whichever comes last.

440
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:29,576
Come on. Shoo shoo.
Get out of here.

441
00:40:29,414 --> 00:40:33,869
You should have told us son.
You should have told us that you weren't a real king.

442
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:37,387
You never told me that I have to fight anybody.
What did you expect son?

443
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,904
I don't know, maybe a fatherly advice,
like: hey son...

444
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:45,056
...it's a fight.
You are a lion, aren't you?
But I never fought another lion in my life.

445
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:49,033
Yeah, yes, right. You dance.
And other stuff. The point is, your pal, Makunga...

446
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:53,038
...set me up back there. I mean, none of these would happen...
If you were a real lion...

447
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:55,359
Zuba.
Yeah, I said it.

448
00:40:56,555 --> 00:41:00,073
A real lion?
Thanks.

449
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:05,325
Thanks a lot.

450
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:19,265
Saw, stitcher.

451
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:22,994
Swallow.
You're in my light Steaven.

452
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:26,150
Oh, say. You've got a brown spot there on your shoulder.

453
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,407
Yeah, that's very observative of you Steven.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

454
00:41:30,728 --> 00:41:36,209
OK. That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So, I don't have to pick another dying hole?

455
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:41,109
No, Timo. You've got your whole life ahead of you.
Really?
Go out there and grab a bite of that horns.

456
00:41:41,776 --> 00:41:44,239
Thank you doctor Mankiewicz.
Break a leg. Sweet kid.

457
00:41:45,046 --> 00:41:49,938
This spot looks like witch doctor's disease.
Witch doctor's disease?

458
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:52,741
That's the most ridiculous disease, I've ever heard of, Steven.

459
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:56,408
Wow...
Don't ask.
Someone has been naughty.

460
00:41:57,814 --> 00:42:02,810
OK. This one will hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, he had a spot just like that.

461
00:42:03,373 --> 00:42:06,610
Monday Joe, Wednesday no Joe.

462
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,477
Wednesday no Joe?
I can breathe.

463
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:15,646
Thanks doc.
So, this witch doctor's disease is a real thing?

464
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:20,359
You'll find a cure. Hey, you got at least forty eight hours.
But I have never even heard of it.

465
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:26,690
What? I mean, I don't have any penicillin.
I'm gonna need a catscan just to get started.

466
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:30,102
You'll have a lion looking over, they'd be happy to.

467
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:43,156
Ta daaa.
That guy has got talent.

468
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:49,310
Bet you haven't seen that one before.
This knock 'em dead in New York.

469
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,833
Hey, let's all give it a try.
Yeah, let's do it.

470
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:55,543
Well, hey hey hey, I know you want to
but it's gonna take years of practice...

471
00:42:55,543 --> 00:43:00,662
...you get never gonna quite get a tight stream
until you build up your lip muscles to the point...

472
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:04,356
...where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?

473
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:19,234
Ta daa...

474
00:43:22,996 --> 00:43:25,987
How did you?
You guys got it right up the box.

475
00:43:26,267 --> 00:43:28,695
If you can do it.
We can do it.
It's in our blood.

476
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:32,704
I always thought, I was a little bit unique.
We are unique.

477
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:37,486
Hey, we are like a force of nature.
A million points of light.
And all stripes.

478
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:40,685
Exactly the same.

479
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:43,640
Exactly the same.

480
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:48,108
Looks impressive Kowalski,
but will it fly?

481
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:51,626
Yes, if we fold it here, here and here.

482
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,205
Nice.

483
00:44:07,036 --> 00:44:12,522
Oh man, my dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I have ruined my parent's lifes.

484
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:17,025
That is definitely not crackalacking.
It's lacking in the craken my friend.

485
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,100
I have got to fix this.

486
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,451
So,
there is...

487
00:44:22,899 --> 00:44:25,141
...there is something I gotto tell you.

488
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:28,460
Hey guys.
Is this place great or what?

489
00:44:29,236 --> 00:44:31,591
I'd go with or what.
Oh well, I tell you what.

490
00:44:31,908 --> 00:44:36,728
You're not gonna believe it but;
I got a date with Moto Moto.

491
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:42,708
Who is Moto Moto.
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big.

492
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:45,311
You know what Moto Moto means?
Twins?

493
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:48,197
It means hot hot.
Hot hot?

494
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:52,928
OK, when did you start parley in African?
It's in my blood.

495
00:44:52,928 --> 00:44:56,219
Don't worry.
You can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

496
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:59,278
What's the deal Melman?
Why am I the parade and you are the rain?

497
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:03,577
Why do you have to dry the parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll just parade myself in another part of town.

498
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:09,092
Fine by me. By the way, the main streets mine.
Well, you can have your old stinking main streets.

499
00:45:09,221 --> 00:45:14,332
And you can take your hottie tub flood
and you Mr. hot, Moto Moto Jr. comes...
My hottie tub what? What are you talking about?

500
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:19,574
Come on Melman, why don't you just tell her?
You tell, what? Tell her, what are you talking about?

501
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:22,249
I don't know what you are talking about.
So I guess, I'll go then.

502
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:25,718
You know what, don't bother.
Don't get up in my account.

503
00:45:25,718 --> 00:45:31,079
Melman, Gloria.
Hey, I thought you guys were friends.
Come on guys, Marty is absolutely right.

504
00:45:31,571 --> 00:45:33,719
Marty?
Marty?
Marty!

505
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:39,274
What the heck is going on?
You are not ooh.. He was no! I thought he...

506
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:45,502
You are not him. He is ooh...
You thought that guy was me?

507
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:49,057
No, no, no. I mean yes, yes.
You do guys, come on.

508
00:45:49,336 --> 00:45:53,946
You thought I was him?
You guys do kind of look a little a lot you look a lot alike.

509
00:45:54,297 --> 00:45:59,281
Marty you look a lot alike, come on.
You laugh alike, you talk alike, he has the same sort of speech pattern...

510
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:02,401
I mean that is a little weird.
Really, you two guys are, come on Marty.

511
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:07,701
So you're saying there is nothing unique about me,
I am just like any other zebra.

512
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:10,547
No, of course you are different.
How?
How?

513
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:16,917
OK. I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something. I don't know.

514
00:46:17,548 --> 00:46:20,234
A bell?
OK. not a bell, no bell is a bad idea.

515
00:46:20,234 --> 00:46:23,140
No, no, no.
How about a t-shirt that says: "I'm with stupid."?

516
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,533
I am not stupid.
Not you stupid, him stupid!

517
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:31,340
You know what? While you have been off doing
prancing pony with the new pussy.
I have been having pretty much the worst day of my life, OK?

518
00:46:33,906 --> 00:46:35,875
It's always about you, isn't it?

519
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:39,218
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours Marty.

520
00:46:39,572 --> 00:46:42,561
All right, I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?

521
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:48,190
Yeah fine, run away Marty! Run away.
That's what you do best, just like back in New York!

522
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,859
I'm right here. But you can't tell that right?

523
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,966
Your one in a million friend hopes you enjoy your
bigger than everyone else's problems, alone!

524
00:46:59,966 --> 00:47:03,432
Good, leave! I don't need you to help me solve my problems.

525
00:47:03,432 --> 00:47:09,460
You know what? You diame dust I can't tell which one is Marty.
Oh, which one is Marty? Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah!
I don't care.

526
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,336
Nice hat, you show off!

527
00:47:17,998 --> 00:47:18,614
Marty...

528
00:47:20,051 --> 00:47:21,259
...don't go.

529
00:47:26,402 --> 00:47:33,258
Look Maurice. Here is the perfect spot for my semi-palace,
so please fill in all these holes and relocate the roofed.

530
00:47:34,071 --> 00:47:36,821
Oh, who'd leave a perfectly good head lying around.

531
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:40,862
What a waste.
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

532
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:47,965
I'm terminal, you know.
Probably only have another two days left to live.

533
00:47:49,197 --> 00:47:53,231
That's a bomber man.
Oh, if I King Julien, that's my name.

534
00:47:53,227 --> 00:47:58,962
Only had two days left to live.
I'd do all the things I have ever dreamed of doing.

535
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:02,623
Like what?
I'd love to became a professional whistler.

536
00:48:02,623 --> 00:48:06,540
I pretty amazing that I did know.
But I wanna get luck even better.

537
00:48:06,998 --> 00:48:09,778
I'd make my living out of it.

538
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:22,692
You know what else I'd do?
I'd invade a neighboring country and impose...

539
00:48:22,794 --> 00:48:27,160
...my own ideology even if they didn't want it.
It's easy for you to say, you are a king.

540
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,593
Yes. And you are only just a sad little head.

541
00:48:32,084 --> 00:48:35,560
But there must be something
you want to do before you die.

542
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,338
Well...

543
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:39,438
There is this one thing.
What is it? Tell me.

544
00:48:39,642 --> 00:48:42,356
Well. No, I couldn't. I mean.
What is it?

545
00:48:42,471 --> 00:48:45,864
You know, I just never really have the guts to tell Gloria,
how I think about her.
What is it?

546
00:48:45,864 --> 00:48:49,955
I don't really have the guts to tell Gloria,
how I feel about her.
What is it?

547
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,616
I have always felt about her.
Fine, don't tell me!

548
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:59,035
Is it a woman?
Oh, you didn't tell me we are talking about a woman.

549
00:48:59,493 --> 00:49:03,224
What are you afraid of?
You are dead man anyway, come on.

550
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:05,179
Yeah?
Yeah...

551
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:10,539
Yeah, you are right.
Well, you gotta march right up to this woman, right?

552
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:16,096
You look her right in the eye, you lean forward, right?
Just a little, almost all the way.

553
00:49:16,905 --> 00:49:20,456
Then you let her, like, lean forward, just a little bit until you're...

554
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:23,729
...just a lips distance away from each other.

555
00:49:24,326 --> 00:49:27,564
And then you just tell her,
how much you hate her.

556
00:49:27,704 --> 00:49:31,995
Actually, it's, it's more like love her.

557
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:37,099
Oh, you slave dog.
You're a real player, you know that?

558
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:39,781
Now listen to me.
You gotto raise up.

559
00:49:41,705 --> 00:49:43,195
I can't hear you.
Yeah.

560
00:49:43,195 --> 00:49:45,123
Good. You gotto raise up.

561
00:49:45,731 --> 00:49:47,723
You gotto get out of the hole.

562
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:51,148
I'm raising up on the ground.
He's raising Maurice.
I'm raising Maurice.

563
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:54,999
You gotto go right up to this woman.
Yeah.

564
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:59,433
You gotto go right up to a fight.
Yeah, I tell her.

565
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:06,490
And then you gotto say: Baby, I dig you. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.

566
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,701
I love that happy little head.

567
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:17,721
She loves me.

568
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:19,879
She loves my eyes.

569
00:50:20,805 --> 00:50:21,898
She loves me.

570
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:23,930
She loves my ass.

571
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:25,828
She loves my roundness.

572
00:50:26,327 --> 00:50:27,790
She loves that I'm chunky.

573
00:50:28,399 --> 00:50:29,778
She loves that I'm plumpy.

574
00:50:30,373 --> 00:50:31,788
She loves my healthiness.

575
00:50:32,214 --> 00:50:33,787
She loves my zestiness.

576
00:50:34,187 --> 00:50:36,008
She loves me restlessly.

577
00:50:36,527 --> 00:50:37,738
She loves me forever.

578
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,054
She loves me, because she loves me.

579
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:46,281
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well...

580
00:50:47,054 --> 00:50:50,675
...I was wondering if I were to for example stay here...

581
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,432
...I'd like to ask you
Let your candy lips bring the messages to my ear canal.

582
00:50:56,556 --> 00:51:02,573
Well I don't know, I have so many questions.
Well I promise, the answer will always be yes...

583
00:51:02,573 --> 00:51:08,893
...unless, no is required.
OK. So, what is it about me that you find so interesting?

584
00:51:09,456 --> 00:51:12,866
Oh, you're the most plumpiness girl I've ever met.

585
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:19,353
OK. Other than that?
Let's see, you, you know, you are chunky.

586
00:51:20,232 --> 00:51:26,019
Right.
Oh, my gosh girl you are huge.

587
00:51:26,226 --> 00:51:31,258
You've said that.
Oh, yes right. We don't have to talk no more.

588
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:35,268
Gloria!
Gloria?

589
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,301
Melman?

590
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:42,443
Melman, I want you to meet with Moto Moto.

591
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:47,315
Ah, Moto Moto. Yeah.
Nice to, nice to meet you.

592
00:51:47,334 --> 00:51:52,627
Well, I guess, I...
It's OK. Melman. Apology accepted.

593
00:51:52,627 --> 00:51:57,223
Oh, yeah, right, yes. That, yes, that's why I... Good.

594
00:51:57,223 --> 00:52:03,225
Oh, OK. That's well, that's it then.
You good, we're kind of a busy here man.

595
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:07,202
No! No, that's not it!

596
00:52:07,812 --> 00:52:14,420
Listen Mototo, you'd better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.

597
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:20,838
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I would give her flowers every day. And not just any flowers, OK?

598
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:22,886
Her favorites are orchids.
White.

599
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:28,427
And breakfast in bed. Six loaves of wheat toast with butter on both sides.
No crusts. The way she likes it.

600
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:31,787
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend...

601
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:36,956
... and I'd spend every day trying to think of how to make her laugh.
She has the most...

602
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:39,701
...most amazing laugh.

603
00:52:42,387 --> 00:52:45,550
Well, I mean. That's what I would do, if I were you.

604
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,908
But I'm not. So you do it.

605
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:53,219
Oh, OK. What?

606
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:56,242
That was beautiful.

607
00:52:57,122 --> 00:52:59,369
Anyways, where were we?

608
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,554
I'm huge.

609
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,814
Surprised to see me Makunga?
Well I'm here to set things straight.

610
00:53:06,814 --> 00:53:10,583
Like a real lion.
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?

611
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:16,052
This is for setting me up.
This is for stealing my dad's job.
This is for humiliating my family.

612
00:53:16,052 --> 00:53:18,270
And making me fun like a fool.

613
00:53:35,068 --> 00:53:38,539
Had enough? Sure fly away. Coward.

614
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,706
The water, it's gone.
Oh no.

615
00:53:52,706 --> 00:53:56,301
The watering hole has never gone dry before.
We're gonna need a lot more dying holes.

616
00:53:56,584 --> 00:53:58,128
How could this happen?
Out of my way.

617
00:53:58,764 --> 00:54:03,177
What is going on here?
The watering hole is dried up, there's barely enough water for one of us.

618
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:05,347
Yes, good observation Shirley.
I'm Boby.

619
00:54:05,347 --> 00:54:08,004
Makunga what will we do?
Quiet!

620
00:54:08,682 --> 00:54:13,325
Listen up. I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis.

621
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:18,326
We'll all have to fight for it.
Fight for it? This is crazy.

622
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:23,700
That's not fair, you'd win.
Exactly Shirley.
I'm Boby.

623
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:28,168
Sorry folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now.

624
00:54:28,488 --> 00:54:34,537
Thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please Makunga this is the only water on the reserve.

625
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:38,476
If you're thirsty you'll have to look for water off the reserve.

626
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:48,622
I left the reserve and survived.

627
00:54:49,677 --> 00:54:54,357
I could do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe. But we get in New York all the time.

628
00:54:54,637 --> 00:54:57,419
I'll just travel up river.
Up river?
Off the reserve?

629
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:02,444
You?
Yeah me. I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.

630
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:07,615
Great I'll help you pack but by the looks of that hat I see you're all set.

631
00:55:08,635 --> 00:55:12,961
Yeah fine. Go ahead laugh. Laugh your mane off.
I'm gonna prove you're wrong.

632
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:16,586
May be you should try a little rain dance.

633
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,274
Zuba would know what to do.
Where is Zuba? You don't care about us.

634
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:27,663
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

635
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:36,633
Alright, fine. As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba.

636
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:44,793
Marty?

637
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:55,271
Marty?

638
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:12,613
Is Marty here?

639
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:54,012
Marty, I apologize to you.

640
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,154
I did wrong.

641
00:56:56,438 --> 00:57:03,751
I'm sorry. I overlooked your problems.

642
00:57:04,946 --> 00:57:07,619
At that moment I realized that I was wrong, actually.

643
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:14,711
What kind of a friend does that make me?
Pretty lousy friend I guess.

644
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,700
Well I just want you to know that...

645
00:57:18,053 --> 00:57:21,463
...you're one in a million.
Isn't this touching?

646
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:26,773
This is touching.
So could you please turn around so I can tell you that to your face?

647
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:34,175
That's right. Got you.
I see you in there. Yeah yeah you.
That's right you, right there.

648
00:57:34,175 --> 00:57:38,100
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.

649
00:57:38,836 --> 00:57:41,665
I see you Marty.
I know it's you.

650
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:47,100
You know what makes you special?
These guys...

651
00:57:47,521 --> 00:57:50,336
They're white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

652
00:57:50,722 --> 00:57:53,502
You're a dreamer Marty. Always have been.

653
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:58,179
You have a great taste in music and
horrible taste in friends.

654
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,802
Not Melman and Gloria, me.

655
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:07,568
OK. I'm in.
No Marty. You can't come with me.

656
00:58:07,813 --> 00:58:10,065
I don't believe you have a choice.

657
00:58:26,832 --> 00:58:28,380
Any water?

658
00:58:28,837 --> 00:58:31,122
No, just more diamonds and gold.

659
00:58:36,397 --> 00:58:40,549
OK. Don't give up hope.
Listen up. I'll help you.

660
00:58:40,971 --> 00:58:43,748
There is only one way to get your precious water.

661
00:58:44,175 --> 00:58:51,668
I, your beloved King Julien, must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, water gods.

662
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:55,071
In the volcano.

663
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:00,277
What does that do?
What does that do?

664
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:05,096
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes into volcano.

665
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:08,823
Then the friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

666
00:59:08,823 --> 00:59:11,691
Mmm.. Very nice. Thank you for the sacrifice.

667
00:59:11,901 --> 00:59:14,150
Please have another sacrifice.
No, I've had enough for the day.

668
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:18,863
Listen, I'm gonna be very unsettled unless you will have another...
I don't want another sacrifice, OK?

669
00:59:19,145 --> 00:59:22,203
Look at you, you look skinny.
No, I think I've had enough, is that clear?

670
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:29,449
The gods eat the sacrifice, they are grateful, they give me some of their water.

671
00:59:30,116 --> 00:59:32,473
Then I give it to you.
What?

672
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:36,693
Does it work?
No. I mean yes.

673
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:41,195
Well, Maurice?
Yeah, it's fifty fifty.

674
00:59:45,094 --> 00:59:46,156
Excellent.

675
00:59:47,111 --> 00:59:52,517
Now, all I  need is someone who'd like to go in the volcano
and get eaten by gods.

676
00:59:53,294 --> 00:59:55,575
Any hands? Hands? Anybody?

677
00:59:55,575 --> 00:59:58,904
OK. I need someone, perhaps who has never fall in love.

678
00:59:59,775 --> 01:00:03,842
Who could look death, straight in the eye ball.
A real genuine hero.

679
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,481
I'll do it.
Melman?

680
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:18,251
Hurry up. Before you all come to your senses.

681
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:22,135
Melman, what is wrong with you?

682
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:26,600
I'm dying anyways.
If there is a chance, it'll get you water, it'll be worthy.

683
01:00:27,055 --> 01:00:34,473
Are you nuts?
Gloria, I just want you to know, back at the zoo,
it was never the doctors or the prescriptions that kept me going...

684
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:38,624
...it was always you. Seeing you every day.

685
01:00:39,328 --> 01:00:41,225
That's what kept me going.

686
01:00:44,898 --> 01:00:47,037
Melman, wait.

687
01:00:55,148 --> 01:00:57,960
You gonna mop around like this all day?

688
01:00:58,275 --> 01:01:02,742
Don't hmph me. Listen Zuba. A miracle happened.

689
01:01:03,374 --> 01:01:05,906
Our son has come back to us.

690
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:09,843
How come, that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying woman?

691
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:14,976
We've lost him once Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

692
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:25,979
Zuba!

693
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:26,857
Zuba.

694
01:01:26,929 --> 01:01:29,460
Get out of here.
What do you want Makunga?

695
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:34,067
It's awful. The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?

696
01:01:34,805 --> 01:01:37,230
That's impossible.
There is nothing left.

697
01:01:38,004 --> 01:01:41,696
Well, you are the alpha lion Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

698
01:01:41,941 --> 01:01:45,844
Your son, Alakay. He said he could fix it.
He has gone up river.

699
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,466
Off the reserve?
No!
I tried to stop him.

700
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:52,348
I told him it was suicide but he was determined to prove himself to you.

701
01:01:53,649 --> 01:01:56,111
You stay here in case he comes back.

702
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,579
Hurry Zuba.

703
01:02:03,472 --> 01:02:05,056
I'm so parched.

704
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:13,288
Is this place, aren't affright you out?

705
01:02:13,992 --> 01:02:17,683
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters'll never know we were here.

706
01:02:18,247 --> 01:02:22,782
Why are "we" doing this?
Look, Marty maybe my dad'll think that I'm...

707
01:02:23,556 --> 01:02:28,549
I just wanna show him, I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

708
01:02:29,005 --> 01:02:34,996
I know this might sound hard to believe,
but apparently lions don't dance.
What?

709
01:02:36,706 --> 01:02:41,024
As far as my dad's concerned.
As far as the people is concerned, you're a huge hit.

710
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:43,808
That was New York. This is Africa.
It's a much tougher crowd.

711
01:02:44,196 --> 01:02:46,165
Marty, Marty.
This's it.

712
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:48,766
This is the clog.
Come on.

713
01:02:56,747 --> 01:02:58,298
Here's the water.

714
01:02:59,813 --> 01:03:02,382
Marty, stay down.
Look at that.

715
01:03:05,138 --> 01:03:06,295
It's her.

716
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:08,167
Is this right?
Oh, very good.

717
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:20,610
We need dynamite, do you have any dynamite?
Oh, snap, I just used my last...

718
01:03:37,796 --> 01:03:42,115
Alex!
Run Marty.
Come on, I can't leave you here.

719
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:45,469
Go, get help.

720
01:03:53,886 --> 01:04:00,389
OK. OK. OK...

721
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:11,599
OK. Here we go. OK...

722
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:17,857
Here we go. Here we go.

723
01:04:18,878 --> 01:04:23,441
What is all the hoop about?
Joe?
Joe, the witch doctor? We thought you were dead.

724
01:04:23,441 --> 01:04:27,144
So did I. Then I realized, I'm covered in brown spots.

725
01:04:27,812 --> 01:04:31,505
So, Melman's not dying.
Melman's not dying.

726
01:04:31,926 --> 01:04:34,845
Excuse me, excuse me.
Melman!

727
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:39,558
Move out. Don't do this.
Julien, stop this. This's crazy!

728
01:04:40,015 --> 01:04:45,132
Oh, certainly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy.
Yes!

729
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:52,007
Please, Melman stop.
Gloria?

730
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,767
You can't do this.
Why not?

731
01:04:54,329 --> 01:04:55,983
Because I...

732
01:05:13,781 --> 01:05:17,087
You can't do this Melman.
First of all, it hurts.

733
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,756
Second of all, I'll only have eighteen hours to live anyway.
Melman, I gotto know.

734
01:05:23,952 --> 01:05:27,045
Did you really mean all those things you said about me?

735
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:30,177
Of course I did.
This is crazy.

736
01:05:30,456 --> 01:05:31,617
It is?

737
01:05:33,551 --> 01:05:36,997
It's crazy in the thing, I had to go half way around the world...

738
01:05:38,089 --> 01:05:41,010
...to find out that the perfect guy for me...

739
01:05:41,288 --> 01:05:45,579
...lived right next door.
Then I guess it's you and me neighbor...

740
01:05:45,965 --> 01:05:48,710
...you and me for the next eighteen hours.

741
01:05:49,025 --> 01:05:51,064
I'll take whatever you got.

742
01:05:55,074 --> 01:05:58,030
Maurice, what just happened?
I believe the fat lady has sobbed.

743
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:04,851
Hey, what's going on here?
Marty.
Hey, listen up. Alex is in big trouble. We get to get up the river fast.

744
01:06:05,168 --> 01:06:07,173
What about the plane?
Perfect. Come on.

745
01:06:10,128 --> 01:06:13,927
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.

746
01:06:14,276 --> 01:06:16,492
Now, about maternity leave.
Maternity leave?

747
01:06:17,549 --> 01:06:20,993
You're males.
Look, we need a plane for rescue mission.

748
01:06:21,065 --> 01:06:23,604
Well, there is nothing I can do until we bust up this union.

749
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:27,289
I'm gonna get the busty not bully you if you don't get this plane going.

750
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:31,302
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied here?
No maternity leave.

751
01:06:34,044 --> 01:06:38,159
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savannah.

752
01:06:47,445 --> 01:06:50,153
Alright, you get your maternity leave.

753
01:06:51,432 --> 01:06:52,521
Finally.

754
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,791
Where are you headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

755
01:07:00,457 --> 01:07:02,986
Oh no, please. You are not gonna burn me there.

756
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:05,440
No, no, no.
This's wrong.

757
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,757
You see? You are survivals.

758
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:12,977
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

759
01:07:13,185 --> 01:07:16,408
We can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, taste like chicken.

760
01:07:16,593 --> 01:07:22,125
No, no, no, no. Don't listen to her.
She is out of her mind. People.

761
01:07:24,115 --> 01:07:28,565
I'm from New York City too.
It's me, Alex the lion. From Central Park.

762
01:07:35,248 --> 01:07:36,503
Dad.

763
01:07:37,596 --> 01:07:41,013
What were you thinking son?
You got no matter be not here.

764
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:46,611
This's it, I want you to stay behind.
Look dad, they're New Yorkers, they are just...

765
01:07:46,611 --> 01:07:49,193
...ruined and frightened people.
Stay back.

766
01:07:49,952 --> 01:07:52,079
Are you gonna let them get away?

767
01:07:57,694 --> 01:08:01,846
What are you doing son?
The only thing I know how to do.

768
01:08:12,142 --> 01:08:15,157
Hey, all those moves...
Alex?

769
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:21,817
This is Alex the lion.
From Central Park.
This is Alex.

770
01:08:21,817 --> 01:08:24,000
Only one lion can move like that.

771
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:32,453
This is beautiful.
I can't believe this.

772
01:08:39,138 --> 01:08:40,724
How does he do that?

773
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,024
Dad, what are you doing?
Dancing with my son...

774
01:08:56,484 --> 01:08:59,050
...I think.
Don't think dad, feel.

775
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:01,584
Butterfly.

776
01:09:03,908 --> 01:09:06,193
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

777
01:09:28,602 --> 01:09:31,663
Oh, that was beautiful.
Now, let's eat.

778
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:33,597
Dad, look out!

779
01:09:35,147 --> 01:09:38,010
What the?
Alex, get in.

780
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,986
She has got a gun.
Let's get out while we can.

781
01:09:41,972 --> 01:09:45,700
What?
She has got a gun. Let's get out while we can.
Pass it on.

782
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:53,507
He said, let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Pass it on.

783
01:09:53,507 --> 01:09:59,982
Skipper, Alex wants to take out the dam.
Alright, but it's his funeral.
What?

784
01:10:00,825 --> 01:10:03,462
Deploy.
Aye aye, Skippy.

785
01:10:12,151 --> 01:10:14,155
Come back. That's my dinner.

786
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:15,804
Kovalski, full proto.

787
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:18,896
Music.

788
01:10:20,827 --> 01:10:22,798
Oh, I like this song.
It never gets old.

789
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:26,246
It does have a catchy hook.

790
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:41,218
Tell them, no, pull up. She will kill us.
There is gotto be another way. Pass it on.

791
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:49,167
They say, no pull up, kill us. There is no other way. Pass it on.

792
01:10:49,517 --> 01:10:54,511
Are you sure?
There is no sacrifice greater then someone else.

793
01:10:55,463 --> 01:10:57,783
No, medic!

794
01:11:01,405 --> 01:11:03,693
Relic speed.

795
01:11:06,939 --> 01:11:08,580
Bring it on.

796
01:11:10,268 --> 01:11:11,922
Bad kitties.

797
01:11:19,485 --> 01:11:22,154
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.

798
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:27,220
The science seem so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano...

799
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:30,104
...if I wasn't so good at whistling.

800
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,580
Oh, it's you. I found you.
Mort?

801
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:59,238
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's go find out.

802
01:12:01,312 --> 01:12:03,950
Look, Maurice.

803
01:12:04,933 --> 01:12:08,770
That was quick.
I did it. I did it. I did it.

804
01:12:10,669 --> 01:12:13,023
OK. You did it.
Oh yes.

805
01:12:38,609 --> 01:12:41,668
Look.
It's Alakay, it's Zuba.

806
01:12:52,694 --> 01:12:54,478
Zuba, Alakay.

807
01:12:55,257 --> 01:12:59,475
You're back.
I'm so glad you're safe.

808
01:13:00,705 --> 01:13:04,576
Out of my way.
Well, well, well, well, well.

809
01:13:06,016 --> 01:13:12,082
You know Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quitted the pride, and you were kicked out.

810
01:13:12,082 --> 01:13:16,181
So don't think for any instant that this changes anything.

811
01:13:16,497 --> 01:13:23,257
You're right, in fact we humbly
present you with this token of appreciation.
That is a man bag, very popular where I came from.

812
01:13:23,257 --> 01:13:26,907
I don't know what to say.
You can still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does this strip adjust?

813
01:13:27,406 --> 01:13:32,675
Yes. I think this will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But I'm afraid you're still banished.

814
01:13:33,097 --> 01:13:35,066
We figured you'd say that.

815
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,243
My hand bag.

816
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,505
You bad kitty.

817
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:58,385
You deserve this son.

818
01:14:00,037 --> 01:14:01,868
Welcome to the pride.

819
01:14:05,948 --> 01:14:08,760
Thanks dad. But this belongs to you.

820
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:12,101
No, no son, to us.

821
01:14:17,054 --> 01:14:20,603
My son, the king of New York!

822
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,800
Love transcends all differences.

823
01:14:34,716 --> 01:14:38,656
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.

824
01:14:39,711 --> 01:14:43,192
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?

825
01:14:45,933 --> 01:14:47,692
For better please.

826
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,391
What a beautiful weird couple.

827
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,006
That's not gonna last.

828
01:14:54,803 --> 01:14:57,933
Can I kiss the bride Skipper?
No.
Music.

829
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:01,915
Struts? Checked.
Fillets? Checked.
Diamonds and gold? Checked.

830
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:07,541
Bye bye.
We're gonna miss you.
See you later.

831
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:10,348
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo.

832
01:15:10,635 --> 01:15:13,905
Or whenever the gold runs out.
Take cares.
Come back soon.

833
01:15:14,258 --> 01:15:18,869
Hey you know mom, let them take their time.
New York is not going anywhere.
Right guys?

834
01:15:18,869 --> 01:15:22,412
Yeah, you're right about that?
Well, as long as I'm with her.

835
01:15:23,184 --> 01:15:26,246
And you two.
I don't care where we're.

836
01:15:26,891 --> 01:15:29,461
She has the most amazing laugh.

837
01:15:32,169 --> 01:15:33,786
Love has no boundaries.

838
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:37,305
Well, it looks like you're stucked with us for a while.

839
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:44,340
Dad, what's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...

840
01:15:47,789 --> 01:15:49,582
You got me.
I got you son.

841
01:15:49,827 --> 01:15:53,062
You got me with my... You did my thing.
You got a background on me. I love it.

842
01:15:56,294 --> 01:15:57,806
I got you son.

843
01:15:58,545 --> 01:16:01,148
Old man is not too bad, hey Marty?
Marty?

844
01:16:01,464 --> 01:16:04,488
Who's Marty?
Come on?
I don't know Marty. Don't call me Marty.

845
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:07,903
You can't fool me.
I don't see no Marty. Ain't no Marty here.

846
01:16:08,288 --> 01:16:12,403
Marty, I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.

847
01:16:24,156 --> 01:16:27,220
Hey shake the hot thing.
Shake the hot thing.

848
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:31,006
Shake 'em. Shake 'em.
Shake 'em. Shake 'em...
