1
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:46,553
 My name is Diana Armstrong,
 but my stage name is Diamond.

2
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:54,394
 I worked at the PIayers CIub
 4 years before it burnt down...

3
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:58,765
 and to teII you the truth,
 I,m gIad it,s gone.

4
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,970
 When I was a senior
 in high schooI...

5
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:04,971
 aII I wanted to do was attend
 a famous bIack coIIege...

6
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:06,842
 and study journaIism.

7
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:09,843
 But my father had
 different pIans for my Iife.

8
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:12,715
 You,re not going
 to one of those nigger coIIeges!

9
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:15,716
 You have the opportunity to go
 upstate to a good coIIege...

10
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,220
 and that is where you are going!

11
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,222
 No, I,m not!
 That,s where you want me to go!

12
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:21,657
 I,m going to Southern Tech!

13
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:24,658
 No, you are not!
 Not with my goddamn money!

14
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:26,495
 You are not!

15
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:29,365
 We don,t need yo, money!
 We don,t need nothin, from you!

16
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,567
 You must think you grown, huh?

17
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:33,902
 You think you got
 this whoIe worId figured out.

18
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:35,404
 If you are that grown...

19
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:38,073
 you need to get the heII
 out of this house!

20
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,075
 Get out there
 and get a house of your own!

21
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:42,244
 No! She is not goin, anywhere!

22
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,246
 That,s right!
 And don,t come back...

23
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:46,248
 tiII you get some sense in you!

24
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,250
 Don,t pay attention
 to what he says!

25
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:51,251
 Diana, he,II caIm down.
 Just wait. Honey!

26
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,822
 You got that baby!

27
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:56,625
 -Do you hear me?
 -Mama, I,m gone!

28
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:57,926
 So to show him...

29
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:00,529
 I got a IittIe apartment
 with my baby,s father.

30
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,530
 And it was aII good
 untiI he needed his space--

31
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,602
 whatever the fuck that means.

32
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:09,271
 So instead of checking into
 Southern Tech that semester...

33
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:11,707
 I had to deaI
 with the reaI worId.

34
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,708
 That,s when I met
 Tricks and Ronnie.

35
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:21,681
 Ain,t you supposed to heIp me
 try these on?

36
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:24,951
 You need heIp?

37
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:34,263
 I ain,t trying to get
 in your business...

38
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:36,131
 but can I ask a question?

39
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,300
 How much money you make
 working here?

40
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:39,668
 I make enough.

41
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,403
 Enough to do what?

42
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:44,404
 They couIdn,t pay me enough
 to smeII feet aII day.

43
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,643
 You couId be making
 a Iot more money...

44
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:49,578
 if you wouId just use
 what you got...

45
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,613
 to get what you want
 and forget this chump change.

46
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:54,614
 -What,s that mean?
 -Just what it sound Iike.

47
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:56,718
 Don,t be stupid, girI.

48
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:59,121
 Use what God gave you.

49
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:00,956
 Y,aII some prostitutes?

50
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:03,292
 HeII, no. We dancers.

51
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:05,994
 Dancers? Where y,aII dance at?

52
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:08,995
 The PIayers CIub.

53
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,501
 The PIayers CIub was owned...

54
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:15,502
 by this Iow-Iife named
 ''DoIIar BiII''--aIways in debt.

55
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:18,740
 He was the one that gave me
 the name Diamond.

56
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,410
 He said ,cause my face
 was so pretty...

57
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:24,411
 but he never reaIIy Iooked
 at my face.

58
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:26,181
 How you doing?

59
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:27,516
 Hi. I,m Diana.

60
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,151
 DoIIar BiII.

61
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:31,787
 Kinda cute.

62
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:33,288
 A IittIe makeup...

63
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,157
 fix your hair
 a IittIe different.

64
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:38,158
 Turn around. Tet me see.

65
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,729
 Damn, she got ass.

66
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,035
 You can start tonight
 if you want to.

67
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:48,971
 I got to caII the baby-sitter.

68
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:51,972
 AII right, then.
 They was cheap tonight.

69
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:56,676
 Just quit fuckin, with my shit!
 PIease!

70
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,857
 What,s up, new booty?
 How you doing?

71
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,125
 Nervous.

72
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:12,294
 Don,t think I can go out there
 Iooking Iike this.

73
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:15,130
 Yeah, you can. You just gotta
 Iearn how to reIax.

74
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:17,132
 Took around you.
 Everybody here is naked.

75
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,134
 Every girI was nervous
 their first night...

76
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,135
 but they got used to it.

77
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,474
 You drink?

78
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:28,475
 Here.
 Tet me show you something.

79
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:33,549
 Try not to Iook
 at the customer.

80
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,550
 Just Iook in the mirror
 and dance sexy to the music.

81
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:40,253
 Pretend you,re at home
 in your bathroom by yourseIf.

82
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:46,662
 That,s it?

83
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:49,663
 And drink as much as you can
 as fast as you can.

84
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,668
 You might as weII get faded.

85
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:55,669
 HoId on.

86
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:01,910
 Where,s my money
 from the party you did?

87
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,911
 I want my money,
 and I,m not pIaying.

88
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:09,051
 -Tet,s go, ho.
 -What?

89
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,219
 That,s what they about
 to caII you upstairs...

90
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,221
 so get used to it.

91
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:16,222
 Now, Iet,s go, ho.

92
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,643
 When it was my turn to dance...

93
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:36,845
 I was shittin, bricks.

94
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:39,846
 I feIt Iike a mouse
 in a room fuII of snakes.

95
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:52,659
 What,s up?

96
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:22,057
 That,s it!

97
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:25,058
 Damn, baby! Work that shit!

98
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:34,801
 You want a dance, Miron?

99
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,872
 What you waitin, on, girI?
 You better get yo, money.

100
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,660
 My first tabIe dance...

101
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:01,661
 was the most degrading
 experience of my Iife.

102
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:05,932
 But after a few hours,
 and a few more drinks...

103
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:08,303
 I didn,t even worry about it.

104
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:11,304
 The money was fast and easy.

105
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:14,741
 And I needed it.

106
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:17,944
 I tried not to Iet this cIub
 change me, but it has.

107
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:20,782
 You can,t park there.

108
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:23,783
 I,m not the same person
 I was before.

109
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,120
 God damn it!
 I said you can,t park there!

110
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:30,123
 I waIked in a young Iady
 and came out a woman...

111
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:34,563
 knowin, a Iot more about Iife.

112
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:37,564
 Tike in this business,
 hounds can be maIe and femaIe.

113
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:40,635
 And I tried to avoid both.

114
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:43,636
 Excuse you. You better watch
 where you going!

115
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:46,639
 I had a four-year hustIe pIan
 that was the bomb.

116
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,610
 I wouId go to schooI
 in the daytime...

117
00:09:48,611 --> 00:09:51,611
 and I wouId pay for it at night.

118
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:54,583
 I got aII the way up
 to my senior year...

119
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:57,584
 without getting caught in any
 buIIshit the cIub had to offer.

120
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:00,655
 I had Tance, my new boyfriend.

121
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:03,656
 And my father and I
 was even speaking again.

122
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,060
 Everything was cooI.

123
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,629
 At Ieast untiI...

124
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,630
 my 18-year-oId cousin Ebony
 moved here from TaIIahassee...

125
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,801
 a month before finaIs.

126
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:15,802
 And my mama toId her mama
 I wouId keep her out of troubIe.

127
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:19,706
 I said, ''Yeah,'' because she was
 my favorite IittIe cousin.

128
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:25,478
 -How are you?
 -I,m fine.

129
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:27,849
 Took at you.

130
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,850
 Come on in. Give me your stuff.

131
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:33,221
 Tance, this is my cousin Ebony.

132
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:34,389
 How you doing?

133
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,358
 After seeing my new apartment...

134
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:39,359
 she asked if she couId work
 with me at the PIayers CIub.

135
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,264
 Stripping business
 started in Africa.

136
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:43,965
 Tong time ago...

137
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:46,735
 Iong, Iong time ago,
 white men went to Africa.

138
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:49,237
 And he saw aII
 these bootifuI bIack women...

139
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:51,239
 waIking around, singing...

140
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,240
 dancing, working, Iiving...

141
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:56,745
 in the nude.

142
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:58,747
 Bucket nekkids.

143
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:00,949
 You couId see they pubIic hairs.

144
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,185
 This white man
 went from viIIage to viIIage...

145
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:05,287
 to seek out
 these bootifuI bIack women.

146
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:08,288
 Watching them perform
 in the nude.

147
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
 Titties! Asses. Free.

148
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,197
 White man got a idea.

149
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:17,098
 He figure
 he go back to Europe...

150
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,367
 and start the same type
 of business...

151
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,336
 take away from my bIack womens.

152
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:24,337
 Try to get those white bitches
 to dance the same identicaI way.

153
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,710
 But to no avaiI.

154
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,545
 Wasn,t no shame
 in our bIack women.

155
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:33,546
 Wasn,t no shame in them
 waIking around bucket nekkid.

156
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,452
 So he went to Europe,
 tried to start the same thing.

157
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:39,221
 But it didn,t happen.

158
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:42,222
 Those white bitches toId him
 the most bootifuI words...

159
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:44,459
 you ever wanna hear
 in our profession.

160
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,694
 What she say?

161
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:48,695
 Baby, those white bitches
 Iooked at that white man...

162
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:52,232
 dead in the eye and toId him,
 ''Fuck that. Pay me.''

163
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:57,239
 That,s why I get thirty percent.

164
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,740
 When can I start?

165
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:01,741
 ImmediateIy.

166
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:05,280
 Ebony jumped head-first
 into this IifestyIe.

167
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:08,281
 She wouId stay out aII night...

168
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:11,618
 and I wouId have to spend
 aII morning Iooking for her.

169
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:20,026
 Hey, girI.
 Have you seen my cousin?

170
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:28,904
 See you tomorrow, man.
 You got your bag?

171
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:30,605
 Yeah, I got it. Bye, Mama.

172
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:33,606
 Bye. Don,t teII Grandma

 and asked if I wanted
 to make some extra money.

328
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:45,933
 They knew about

 so I went.

00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:53,220
 She goes by the name of Diamond.

385
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:56,221
 In this case,

00:25:34,856 --> 00:25:36,424
 You scared me, Tance.

389
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:38,993
 I wanted to go out tonight.

390
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:40,628
 What you doing
 sitting up in the dark?

391
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:42,697
 How,d you get in here?

392
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:45,698

 -Today is Thursday.
 -I know what day it is.

395
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:54,275
 Every Wednesday, Thursday,
 Friday, Saturday--same thing.

396
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:56,277
 You,d rather shake your ass
 for some strangers...

397
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:57,778
 than spend some time
 with your man.

398
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,481
 That,s not true.
 You know I,d rather be with you.

399
00:26:00,482 --> 00:26:01,849
 You don,t act Iike it.

400
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,318
 When you going to quit working
 at that dumb-ass cIub?

401
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,020
 Because I,m getting fed up
 with this.

402
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:09,021
 Was it a dumb-ass cIub
 when I met you there?

403
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:19,200
 Don,t you think you want
 to put some cIothes on?

404
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:22,201
 For what? Tance?
 He ain,t nobody.

405
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:29,942
 Come on. Tet,s go in my room.

406
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:42,790
 So, what do we do...

407
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:45,791
 when our mainstream media
 quotes our tabIoid media?

408
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:49,296
 What do we do?

409
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:52,066
 Investigate the subject
 for yourseIf.

410
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:54,401
 Don,t trust anyone,s research
 but your own.

411
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:56,337
 AIways question
 the information you receive.

412
00:26:56,338 --> 00:26:57,938
 If it is the truth...

413
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:00,939
 it shouId be abIe to withstand
 the test of investigation.

414
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:03,978
 Don,t forget--
 review chapters 27 and 54.

415
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:06,979
 The big day is coming.

416
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:25,933
 Excuse me.

417
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:28,934
 Miss Armstrong.

418
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:38,078
 Wake up!

00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,446

00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:44,819
 I,m going to pass.

422
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,820
 How? Someone sIid you
 a copy of the test?

423
00:27:48,023 --> 00:27:50,357
 I,m not going to cheat.

424
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:51,625
 How do I know that?

425
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:54,626
 Because I don,t trust anybody,s
 information but my own.

426
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,797
 Very good.

427
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:58,132
 I toId you I was up.

428
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,433
 You better be.

429
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:02,203
 I haven,t heIped you this far
 for you to mess up now.

430
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:05,204
 Do you think you can get
 more rest?

431
00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:08,507
 Good. Just don,t get it
 in my cIassroom.

432
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:38,672
 Damn.

433
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,374
 Keys, pIease.

434
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,109
 What up?

435
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,078
 This is what,s up, nigga.

436
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,080
 We tired of pIaying

 Today, you going to die.

438

 That motherfucker asIeep.
 Tet him drop.

439
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,632
 Shit!

440
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:07,633
 Do we torture and kiII him
 or just kiII him?

441
00:29:07,636 --> 00:29:09,436
 Shit. Torture his ass.

442
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:11,639
 Dead man don,t pay no biIIs,
 understand?

443
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,640
 That,s why you take a vise grip,
 and you puII out his teeth.

444
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:17,978
 You take a ice pick,
 stick the nigga in his kneecaps.

445
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:20,414
 Cut his eyeIids off
 and keep taking his picture.

446
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:22,116
 Whatever you got to do
 to get paid.

447
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:25,117
 -What was that?
 -PuII over.

448
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:36,664

00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:39,665
 Took in there

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,175

 What you think?
 We knock his ass back out.

454
00:29:58,053 --> 00:29:59,320
 Open it up.

455
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:00,654

 -Tet me get your foot up.
 -This boy,s heavy.

461
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:18,603

 He owed us some money.

468
00:30:43,064 --> 00:30:45,499
 He gave us the car,
 we caught a fIat.

469
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,434
 You aII expect us

00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:50,304
 -Yeah, weII, Iook.

473
00:30:53,008 --> 00:30:55,642
 -HeII, no.

00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:56,677

00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:14,661
 -I smeII a rat here.
 -I smeII two.

 Something,s going down.

00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:21,535
 I don,t trust
 this banana motherfucker.

484
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:23,837
 Tet,s bring them in.
 See if they got warrants.

485
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:24,972
 Come on. Step to the car.

486
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:26,740
 We,re taking you in.

487
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:28,242
 -What?
 -Come on!

488
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:29,843
 Drop you off

 Take some of that bass

496
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:53,365
 You just forgot your keys,
 you dumb ass.

497
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:56,403
 This is poIice brutaIity.

498
00:31:56,404 --> 00:31:59,404
 I didn,t even get
 to Iock the doors.

499
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:05,913
 Come on, man! I,m sorry, man!

500
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:07,915

 Come on, nigga.
 This ain,t nothin, new.

507
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:44,683
 Put your hands on your head.

508
00:32:48,256 --> 00:32:50,257
 Watch my nuts, man.

509
00:32:50,258 --> 00:32:52,826
 Where,s your boss?

510
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:54,161
 I don,t know.
 He ain,t in there.

511
00:32:54,162 --> 00:32:56,730
 Don,t make us

526
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,440
 -Can I ask y,aII a question?

535
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:09,670
 That,s why

00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:12,671
 Can,t use nothin,
 but Head and ShouIders.

537
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:15,707

 Anyway, feIIas, we got coming

00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:44,069
 She started out dancing
 in the Iate 1800s.

546
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:46,573
 She was a premier dancer

00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:49,574
 when Kunta Kinte was
 big baIIin, and shot caIIin,.

548
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:51,345
 Everybody says that Trix

550

 Who toId you to watch me?

665

 Everybody can,t go to coIIege.

 So you,d think
 we,d be cIoser than that.

1028
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:30,375
 Get back.

1029
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:32,344
 You need to stop fighting me,
 Diamond.

1030
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:33,946
 I,m not one of
 these trick-ass niggas.

1031
01:01:33,947 --> 01:01:35,113
 I,m not gonna chase you.

1032
01:01:35,114 --> 01:01:36,648
 Stop. Come on, now.

1033
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:38,550

1036
01:01:43,256 --> 01:01:45,724
 -That incIudes you, Diamond.
 -GirI, move back.

1037
01:01:45,725 --> 01:01:48,660
 You either gonna give it to me,
 or I,m gonna take it...

1038
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:50,462
 just Iike I did Iast time.

1039
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,463
 You know I don,t even
 get down Iike that.

1040
01:01:53,466 --> 01:01:56,168
 I don,t think
 you understand, dawg.

1041
01:01:56,169 --> 01:01:59,169
 That,s the Mr. Doodoo Brown man,
 himseIf.

1042
01:01:59,973 --> 01:02:02,674
 I don,t care about no Tuke.

1043

01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:13,118
 You better not go--Hey!

1048
01:02:15,355 --> 01:02:18,355
 Worse than them femaIes.

1049
01:02:22,262 --> 01:02:25,097
 Wait, wait, wait.
 Now where you goin,?

1050
01:02:25,098 --> 01:02:26,465
 I,m just trying to say
 what,s up to Tuke.

1051
01:02:26,466 --> 01:02:29,201
 He,s trying to reIax.
 No autographs.

1052
01:02:29,202 --> 01:02:32,202
 HoId up. I don,t want

 Tet me hoIIer at you

1057
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:45,150
 You gonna have to step back.
 Tuke is busy.

1058
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:48,151
 Get your hands off of me.

1059
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:51,690
 He ain,t tryin, to meet nobody.

1060
01:02:51,691 --> 01:02:54,192
 We just came here to reIax
 and have a good time.

1061
01:02:54,193 --> 01:02:55,861
 That,s aII.
 We don,t want no troubIe.

 Yeah, boy!

1072
01:03:51,851 --> 01:03:54,851
 Drop that weapon! Reggie!

1073
01:03:59,192 --> 01:04:01,360
 Get the fuck out of my way!

1076
01:04:12,605 --> 01:04:15,605

01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,160
 They done fucked up

1079
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:40,265
 Good evening.

1080

 shot up another party.

1082
01:04:46,606 --> 01:04:49,007
 Shot up the pIace.
 You know that,s right.

1083
01:04:49,008 --> 01:04:50,575
 You know there,s aIways
 somebody on the side...

1084
01:04:50,576 --> 01:04:52,277
 ''I seen the whoIe thing.

1085
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:55,278
 ''Wasn,t nobody but BiIIy EarI

1086

1087
01:04:58,718 --> 01:05:01,086
 Get on in there.

1088
01:05:01,087 --> 01:05:03,155
 There you go.
 Bag and everything.

1089
01:05:03,156 --> 01:05:06,156
 Thank you for waIking me.

1090
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,360
 Yeah, I was thinking, though...

1091
01:05:10,897 --> 01:05:13,897
 that maybe I couId taIk
 to you, as opposed...

1092
01:05:14,934 --> 01:05:17,402
 to screaming over the music
 aII the time.

1093
01:05:17,403 --> 01:05:20,403
 I couId get your number
 or something?

1094
01:05:22,508 --> 01:05:23,542
 What?

1095
01:05:23,543 --> 01:05:26,543
 You aIways said to say
 what I feeI, right?

1096
01:05:27,113 --> 01:05:30,113
 So I feeI Iike you shouId
 give me your phone number.

1097
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:33,917
 I can,t give you
 my number, BIue.

1098
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,188
 Yeah, weII, why not?

1099
01:05:36,189 --> 01:05:38,657
 I just broke up
 with my boyfriend.

1100
01:05:38,658 --> 01:05:41,658
 You know how that can go.
 We might get back together.

1101
01:05:41,661 --> 01:05:43,195
 I ain,t trippin,.

1102
01:05:43,196 --> 01:05:46,196
 But you couId give me yours.

1103
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:48,967
 Right here is the home number
 right at the top...

1104
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:51,570
 the pager,s right there,
 and if Ray-Ray answers...

1105
01:05:51,571 --> 01:05:54,005
 teII him to go ahead
 and put you through.

1106
01:05:54,006 --> 01:05:55,440
 -AII right?
 -AII right.

1107
01:05:55,441 --> 01:05:58,441
 Peace.

1108
01:06:35,448 --> 01:06:37,516
 So this is your apartment.

1109
01:06:37,517 --> 01:06:38,850
 What do you want?

1110
01:06:38,851 --> 01:06:40,185
 -Can I come in?
 -HeII, no!

1111
01:06:40,186 --> 01:06:42,220
 Don,t come to my house again.
 I,m gonna caII the poIice.

1112
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:45,221
 Why? I aIways make sure
 you get home safe.

1113
01:06:46,192 --> 01:06:47,759

1116
01:06:55,034 --> 01:06:57,702

1117
01:06:57,703 --> 01:06:59,538
 and you act Iike
 I don,t even exist!

1118
01:06:59,539 --> 01:07:02,539

1119
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:05,644

 Tet me go!

1128
01:07:30,603 --> 01:07:33,603
 Wait a minute. Just caIm down.
 I can expIain everything.

1129
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,640
 It ain,t what you think.

1130
01:07:35,641 --> 01:07:38,641
 I think you were fucking
 my cousin in my house!

1131
01:07:39,412 --> 01:07:41,613
 Just caIm down.
 I can expIain everything.

1132
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:42,747
 I want you out of my house!

1133
01:07:42,748 --> 01:07:45,417
 I came over here
 to make up with you.

1134
01:07:45,418 --> 01:07:48,418
 I ain,t going nowhere
 untiI you taIk to me.

1135
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:50,055
 Just taIk to me!

1136
01:07:50,056 --> 01:07:52,958
 I came over,
 Ebony opened up the door...

1137
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,293
 and she said she had
 a crook in her neck...

1138
01:07:55,294 --> 01:07:58,294
 and I said I was gonna
 heIp her work it out.

1139
01:07:58,864 --> 01:08:01,864
 -Diana, be cooI!
 -Get out!

1140
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:26,391
 Open up the door, bitch.

1141
01:08:26,392 --> 01:08:29,392
 I,m sorry.

1142
01:08:30,263 --> 01:08:33,263
 You,re not sorry. Shut up.
 You aIways with somebody,s man.

1143
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:37,433
 Open up the door.

1144
01:08:43,843 --> 01:08:45,243
 You know what?

1145
01:08:45,244 --> 01:08:48,244
 I ain,t even mad at you,
 ,cause you a ho.

1146
01:08:48,814 --> 01:08:51,814
 I knew you was a ho
 before you moved up here.

1147
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,320
 I shouIdn,t have never
 Iet you Iive in my house.

1148
01:08:55,321 --> 01:08:58,321
 And I shouId never have brought
 Tance around you anyway.

1149
01:08:58,658 --> 01:09:01,559
 That was my fauIt.

1150
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,560
 Why, Ebony? Why?

1151
01:09:08,134 --> 01:09:10,335
 You know what?

1152
01:09:10,336 --> 01:09:12,404
 The onIy reason
 why I hurt so much...

1153
01:09:12,405 --> 01:09:15,405
 is because I thought
 you was my famiIy.

1154
01:09:16,676 --> 01:09:19,676
 I thought you Ioved me,
 but I guess you don,t.

1155
01:09:23,015 --> 01:09:25,383
 I,m sorry.

1156
01:09:25,384 --> 01:09:28,384
 I,II be at my mom,s
 tiII I find a new pIace to stay.

1157
01:09:44,537 --> 01:09:47,537
 Bitch, you think I was gonna
 Iet you get away with that?

1158
01:09:48,174 --> 01:09:51,174
 Get your shit and get
 the fuck out of my house!

1159
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:58,581
 Sometimes bIood
 ain,t no thicker than water...

1160
01:09:58,684 --> 01:10:01,684
 and sometimes famiIy wiII bring
 you down quicker than strangers.

1161
01:10:01,721 --> 01:10:03,755
 AII this drama.

1162
01:10:03,756 --> 01:10:06,756
 FinaIs was right around
 the corner.

1163
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,595
 That,s a rowdy pIace
 where you work.

1164
01:10:10,596 --> 01:10:13,498
 I haven,t seen you
 in my cIass aII week.

1165
01:10:13,499 --> 01:10:14,766
 Is there a probIem?

1166
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:17,068
 I had a IittIe bit
 of a famiIy probIem.

1167
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:18,570
 I had to cIear my mind.

1168
01:10:18,571 --> 01:10:21,406
 But I,m just a IittIe jeaIous.

1169
01:10:21,407 --> 01:10:24,342
 The professor did
 a bit of research of his own.

1170
01:10:24,343 --> 01:10:26,644
 It seems you made
 every one of your other cIasses.

1171
01:10:26,645 --> 01:10:28,913
 Every one except mine.

1172
01:10:28,914 --> 01:10:31,182
 You reaIIy hate your job,
 don,t you?

1173
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:34,183
 How you know I hate my job?

1174
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,320
 The expression on your face
 when I waIked in.

1175
01:10:37,623 --> 01:10:39,491
 I may as weII have been
 your dad or something.

1176
01:10:39,492 --> 01:10:40,959
 You were out of there.

1177
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,327
 -I,m sorry.
 -Don,t be.

1178
01:10:42,328 --> 01:10:45,328
 I understand.

1179
01:10:47,266 --> 01:10:50,168
 I taIked to a good friend
 of mine over at B.E.T.

1180
01:10:50,169 --> 01:10:52,270
 You shouId give him a caII
 and see what he,s got for you.

1181
01:10:52,271 --> 01:10:55,271
 Wow, Professor. Thank you.

1182
01:10:56,175 --> 01:10:59,110
 I reaIIy appreciate it.
 Everything you,ve done for me.

1183
01:10:59,111 --> 01:11:00,311
 Don,t mention it.

1184
01:11:00,312 --> 01:11:01,880
 Just come back
 and see me sometime.

1185
01:11:01,881 --> 01:11:04,881
 -First, I gotta pass.
 -You better pass.

1186
01:11:06,152 --> 01:11:08,052
 See you tomorrow, right?

1187
01:11:08,053 --> 01:11:11,053
 In cIass.

1188
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:14,690
 Thank you.

1189
01:11:20,566 --> 01:11:22,734
 Yo, Junior.

1190
01:11:22,735 --> 01:11:25,637
 Your party is wack.
 Know what I,m saying?

1191
01:11:25,638 --> 01:11:27,939
 Yo, pop this in.

1192
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,940
 We ain,t watchin,
 no more pornos!

1193
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:38,581
