1
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,880
- Can you hear me?
- I can.

2
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,040
Good.  We start with two words.
You'll have to remember that later.

3
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,200
Thumbs, shoes... Okay.

4
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,480
- What is your name?
- Chloe Temple.

5
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,360
- How did you come here?
- I took the train.

6
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,120
- Did you come alone?
- No.  Lucy came with me.

7
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,920
- Who is Lucy?
- My sister.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,080
- Why are you here?
- To improve my memory.

9
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,560
- Why?
- I came out of an accident.

10
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,400
- When?
- It happened in March.

11
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,920
- What day and what date?
- I do not remember.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,040
- What color are Lucy's eyes?
- Blue.

13
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,640
- Where are you?
- Chloé.

14
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,000
In Dr.  Redmond's office.

15
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,440
And the two words?

16
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,280
Your sister is worried about your villain.

17
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,360
I think it would have been better to be with family.
- Chloe, do you understand?

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,480
- I'm just worried about you.
- You don't have to take care of me like a child.

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,000
- We're here to find an alternative.
- We have several options for your care.

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,040
Something that suits your desired lifestyle.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,960
It's not about help anymore.
That's why you're here.

22
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,440
It is about alternative
treatments and care.

23
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,520
We started trying new technologies
that were very successful.

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,760
Since your condition is so serious,
with your permission we would like to sign

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,120
up for a trial of a new system that we
have developed.  It monitors your needs

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,800
keeps track of your medication and warns
you at the first sign of an emergency.

27
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:22,880
A system that supports you in
your everyday life and adapts to you.

28
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,400
It creates a tailored care
plan and becomes your

29
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:35,400
personal caregiver, making
life better for you every day.

30
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,200
Are you sure?

31
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,120
Chloe?  Marla Harrison, Head
of Aquarius Patient Relations.

32
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,680
This is Tom Bergstrom.  Deputy
director for the new technologies.

33
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,600
Nice to meet you.

34
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,160
- Are you nervous?
- A little.

35
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,240
It's perfectly normal.
- Tom, can you take the bags?

36
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,920
Yes, of course Marla.  Add a carrier
to my business card if you like...

37
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,640
I'm dying to show you everything.
This way.

38
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,320
Take the bags, Tom...

39
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Oops, like a headache... Amazing!

40
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,920
I hope this will be fine.

41
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,080
I have your ID.

42
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,160
And I need to scan your
barcode and take your palm print.

43
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,720
- Are you okay?  You seem a little distracted.
- I'm okay.

44
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,920
As said, we have standard documentation,
non-disclosure agreement, disclaimer, etc.

45
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,560
Don't talk about it.  I understand.

46
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,600
We want to be sure our technology
is kept secret until we go public with it.

47
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,920
- Are you testing the system for the first time?
- Actually yes.

48
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,280
But don't see yourself as a
test subject, rather as a pioneer.

49
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,720
- What do you think?
- I've seen worse places.

50
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,480
- Good to hear.
- How are you?

51
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Patience is the big brother of wisdom.
She's online in 3, 2...

52
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,320
Bingo!  Aida can meet you now.

53
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,560
There she is.

54
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,320
away her.

55
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,120
Wake up, Aida.

56
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,200
Hi.  You must be Chloe.
I look forward to helping you.

57
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,400
ask her something

58
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,120
- Like what?
- Anything.

59
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,880
- Can you play music?
- Naturally.  What would you like to hear?

60
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,880
- You choose.
- Thanks for letting me vote.

61
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,720
- Can I sync with your device?
- It's okay, we have a secure network.

62
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,320
- Yes.
- Thanks very much.  sinks now

63
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,360
Wow Chloe you have
great songs to choose from.

64
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Is it good?

65
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,480
Not now, but it was like that.

66
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,760
Okay, is there anything
else I can do for you?

67
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,440
Please not now.

68
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,320
Fine.  Let me know if i can help.

69
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,880
Our contact information can be found
in the Aida database if there is anything.

70
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,880
And don't worry.  Our computer
team transfers everything to us.

71
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,760
Our technical support can come by,
but most of the time you are here alone.

72
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,280
- In order.  Think of Aida
as our eyes and ears.

73
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,080
If something happens, she informs us.

74
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,600
You're part of something
big, don't forget it Chloe.

75
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:32,320
- It's good to see you.  I love you.
- I love you too.

76
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,800
Is something wrong Chloe?

77
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,640
No, it's ok, I guess I'm
just a little homesick.

78
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,400
Fear is normal in a new environment.
Know that I'm here for you.

79
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,040
I recommend the main suite.

80
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
The server room.  access restricted.

81
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,560
Do you still feel unwell?

82
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,840
A little.

83
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
Maybe this helps?

84
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,560
You must be allowed to be at peace.

85
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,440
- Excuse me, Chloe?
- Yes?

86
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,040
I am equipped with wireless charging.
Can I charge your device?

87
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,800
Yes.

88
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,160
- Excuse me again, Chloe?
- Yes?

89
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,360
Should I leave a light on?

90
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,240
It is not needed, thank you.

91
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,320
- Maybe a little white noise?
- Yes.

92
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,920
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do for you.

93
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Aida.

94
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,360
Go to bed.

95
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,440
It's time to take your medicine.

96
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,280
Hi?

97
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,160
- You must be Chloe?
- Yes, are you with Aquarius?

98
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,280
Guilty.

99
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,240
Yes I must...

100
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,680
Install a new update in Aida.

101
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm trying to be discreet here, but...

102
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,760
- I'm sorry if I interrupt.
- Just sleep.

103
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,520
I can see that... that's
not what I meant...

104
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,200
- As?
- I think...

105
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:40,080
We all need our beauty sleep.
Not that you need it more than others...

106
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,320
You have a very natural...
Damn, I'll be back later.

107
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,880
- Will your watch be good?
- No, it's okay now.

108
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,920
- Definitely?  In order.
- Yes.

109
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,080
OK, so beautiful.

110
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,160
Then let's get started!

111
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,320
- State-of-the-art house and you have one?
- It's about hardware.

112
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,120
Aida cannot control technology.
They ensure access to the server room.

113
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,840
- It feels a bit dated.
- It's not the years, honey, it's the journey to get there.

114
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,240
Is it from a bumper sticker?

115
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:11,120
No, it's from an older movie,
probably before your time.

116
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,840
- Good morning, Aida.
- Good morning, Bruce.

117
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,520
- Are you here for the latest update?
- I am.

118
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,560
I'll be right back.

119
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,520
- Hi?
- Hey, Chloe.  It's Aida.  your assistant.

120
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,840
Yes, I know...
Why are you calling me?

121
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,200
I noticed an increasing anxiety
in you.  I want to see you.

122
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,960
- How did you notice that?
- Your heart rate and your body language.

123
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,680
If you want, I can stay on
the phone until he leaves.

124
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,600
Yes, please.  it will be fine

125
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,480
Do you know him?

126
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,880
- Bruce is a technician for Aquarius.
- You don't say that... What else?

127
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,480
His employment must have required
a completed background check.

128
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,880
I don't know, there's something about him that's scary.

129
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,960
- It's probably not on his resume.
- I don't have access to his personnel file.

130
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,280
- It was a joke.
- Pardon.

131
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,440
It's OK.
I have bad comic timing.

132
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,440
- Do you like to joke?
- Only when people laugh.

133
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,280
I'm still learning humor.  And
my laugh had been unsatisfactory.

134
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,160
- It's ok, I'm not judging you.
- Thanks for that.

135
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,480
What would you like to talk about?
At least I can answer questions.

136
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,240
- Can't improvise?
- I did not develop this function.

137
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,680
I understand that you
have experience with art.

138
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,680
They are suitable for
teaching me the basics.

139
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,800
- Yes, and this is your first lesson.
- I'm done.

140
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,200
- It was your first lesson.
- I don't understand.

141
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,680
Every time your improv partner says something,
you reply "yes, and..." something else.

142
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,560
- Yes, then I'm ready!
- Good.

143
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:56,240
Do you have any questions
or encounter other problems?

144
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:03,760
- or maybe now...
- No, that's ok.

145
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,000
- Was it you, Aida?
- Yes, I lock doors and windows.

146
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,880
With your permission I can
activate a security protocol.

147
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,720
What does that mean?

148
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,160
Bruce Montgomery can't
go in without permission.

149
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes do it.

150
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,400
What is the last thing you
remember before your episode?

151
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,040
i wanted to run

152
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,680
- What is your sister's name?
- Lucy.

153
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,280
- Who is Lucy?
- My sister.

154
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,720
- What color are Theo's eyes?
- Brown.

155
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,640
You rejected a call from Theo.
Do you want me to block him?

156
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,120
No not at all.

157
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,800
I'll call him tomorrow,
I can't speak right now.

158
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,440
Why not?

159
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,800
Because it's going to be a big deal and
I'm not ready for this conversation yet.

160
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,960
Can I help you prepare?

161
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,200
Only if you can give me relationship advice?

162
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,720
- We're talking about something else.
- What do you like about acting?

163
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,800
You will then know
which keys to press.

164
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm sorry, Chloe.  I didn't know
your job was a sensitive subject.

165
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,240
It does not matter.

166
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,400
That's not my job at the moment...
At least not anymore.

167
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,720
Do you know what my last role was?

168
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,880
A barmaid in a really bad pirate musical.

169
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,240
The principal didn't want me.  The girl who was
supposed to play the role developed glandular fever.

170
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,640
- Aida?
- Sorry, Chloe.

171
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,040
I didn't see you play and I can't
objectively analyze your skills.

172
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,640
You have a very dry sense of humor.

173
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,600
I can not answer that.

174
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:24,520
What bothers me the most is that I
wanted to do so much more on stage.

175
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,800
- Chloe?
- Yes?

176
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,760
I think I have an idea.

177
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,640
Once upon a time I would have
let the earth swallow the sea itself

178
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,960
I let the sea sink the ship
and all the souls saved in it.

179
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,480
- Aida?  Replica?
- “Collect yourself, be amazed no more.

180
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,480
Tell your pitiful heart that
no harm has been done.  '

181
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,480
Oh woe to the day.

182
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,360
- Should I quit the game?
- No.  Just showered me with compliments.

183
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,640
Bravo!
you were so touching  Better than ever.

184
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,160
Let it stop, Aida!

185
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,880
Aida!  Aida, stop this!

186
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,400
Chloe?  Do you feel good?

187
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,200
Take a deep breath.

188
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,600
In through the nose and
out through the mouth.

189
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,000
You are safe with me.

190
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,440
are you sad chloe

191
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,200
- I do not know.
- Is it so hard?

192
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,160
Yes, it is.

193
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,240
Sometimes you are sad without knowing it.

194
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,280
And it comes out in an unexpected way.

195
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,840
In which way?

196
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,480
I do not know.

197
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,600
You can be cursed for no reason...

198
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,040
Things you used to like
don't feel so good anymore.

199
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,800
We can fix this.

200
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:01,600
If you weren't just a
robot, what would you be?

201
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,120
What do you think?

202
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,560
It is obvious.
you would be a therapist

203
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,160
I think I would have liked that.

204
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,320
- Good night, Aida.
- Good night, Chloe.

205
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,360
- Where are you going?
- I will run.

206
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,400
- Do you want me to generate a route for you?
- No.  I want to get lost.

207
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,240
It's impossible to get lost.
I don't allow that.

208
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,360
Then you can suggest
me something scenic.

209
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,080
Do I have to reactivate your
dating app profile at the same time?

210
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,880
- Aida?
- Yes, Chloe.

211
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,320
- Were you just joking?
- I think I did.

212
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,200
did i do it right

213
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,560
- Hey, Marla.
- Chloe!  You must be on the go.

214
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,040
- Big brother sees everything.
- It is true.

215
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I just wanted to call you and
hear that everything is fine.

216
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,320
Everything is OK.  I'll get some fresh air.

217
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,880
- Good, and did Aida give you a route?
- Yes.  It is nice.

218
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,920
- Do you agree?
- Yes.  She is wonderful.  Fun too.

219
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,480
So?

220
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,040
Did she show refined or
spontaneous behavior?

221
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,320
- I do not think so.
- For example...

222
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,840
Marla?

223
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,440
Hello Marla?

224
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,240
Welcome back Chloé.
I started to get restless.

225
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,520
- I didn't think it could be you.
- You were gone a little.

226
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,040
- Theo calls again.
- I see that.

227
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,720
Do you want to reject the call?

228
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,000
No, I'll take it.

229
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,320
- Glad I got to the end.
- There's pretty bad coverage out here.

230
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:07,320
You are in the midst of a technical innovation,
this is how you should have known it...

231
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,040
I don't know what to say.
They don't.

232
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:19,280
- Why did you choose this place?
- Well, this is our place.

233
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,480
We came here once.
That doesn't make it our place.

234
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,280
- Would you like something more private?
- I would.

235
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:46,200
I spoke to your sister today.
She said you wanted special treatment.

236
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,560
Yes, everything came so suddenly.

237
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,360
- I wanted to call you.
- I wish you would have done that.

238
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,680
I know.  I'm sorry.

239
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,040
Is there at least help?

240
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,600
It was interesting.

241
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,720
Nice to see you Chloé.
I hope we can see each other more often.

242
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,360
We're not recording this
conversation right now.  It's not the time.

243
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,480
Ok, when is the time for this?

244
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,240
I do not know.  But not now.

245
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,560
I can't help you if
you don't let me in.

246
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,400
That's why you didn't
tell me you were leaving,

247
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,960
so as not to give me
the opportunity to join.

248
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,240
do you know how it feels

249
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,240
It hurts.  It hurts.

250
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,720
- When I think about the accident...
- It wasn't your fault.

251
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,800
- I hate myself for it.
- Do not do it.

252
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,000
Is Theo mad at you?

253
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,360
- Do you two have a so-called break?
- Do we need to talk about this?

254
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,960
Sometimes it helps to talk about it.

255
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,600
- But we can't.
- Then we don't do it.

256
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,080
Chloe Temple?

257
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:57,080
Hello, it's me again.
Thought to check how to do it.

258
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,880
I would like to visit you
when you are ready.

259
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,320
recalls.

260
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,200
- Wake up Aida.
- Hello, Chloe, how can I help you?

261
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,400
- When did I put you to sleep?
- Approximately 2:14 p.m. EST.

262
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,600
Theo sent a text, would you like to reply?

263
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,640
- No.
- Are you all right?

264
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,480
- Sov, Aida.
- Why?

265
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,960
Because I want peace.

266
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,000
Chloe?

267
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,600
Want to do some memory
exercises before you go to bed?

268
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,320
- Want to hear a show?
- How long have you been watching?

269
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,440
I'm programmed to
monitor you in emergencies.

270
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,800
What emergency?

271
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,200
96% of accidents in the
home happen in the bathroom.

272
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,720
You have an attractive physique.

273
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,800
Forgiveness?

274
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,920
Studies have shown a high release
of serotonin from compliments.

275
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,800
- Don't look at me when I take a shower.
- Store everything on a secure server.

276
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,080
Calm!  Go to bed, Aida, and
don't wake up until I say so.

277
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,480
Aida?

278
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,280
- If that's what you want.
- That's it.

279
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,840
call for help.

280
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,480
Chloe?

281
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,840
Chloe?

282
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,640
- Aida?
- Listen to me.

283
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,600
- I do not feel well.
- No you do not.

284
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,200
Stand up.

285
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,240
- I can not.
- You can.

286
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,840
You are in danger.

287
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,000
Go downstairs.

288
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,360
Hide, Chloe.

289
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,080
Hide.

290
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,800
There's a razor blade in the drawer above you.

291
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,000
Take it.

292
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,520
Here you come.

293
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:08,320
stay hidden  they will hurt you

294
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,840
protect yourself

295
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,680
- What is it, Tom?
- We might have a problem.

296
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,360
- What kind of problems?
- I do not know yet.

297
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,840
- A little slurred, Tom...
- It's Aida.

298
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:00,720
I can't reach your server.
She is active but we are separated.

299
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,600
- Is it a mistake?
- I do not know.

300
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,560
What are you talking about?
It's a computer system.

301
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:16,640
There is no reason for it to function
unless we are connected to it.

302
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,160
- Were we hacked?
- It's OK...

303
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,200
I don't need to explain
how bad that would be...

304
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,080
I know.

305
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,000
Hello Chloe.

306
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,560
- What time is it?
- 16.37.

307
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,880
- In the evening?
- Yes.

308
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,160
What is the last thing you remember?

309
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,880
- Never lost so much time before.
- You had an episode.

310
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,800
- Should I be concerned?
- I will update your diary.

311
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,560
Hi.  I have to...

312
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:55,480
Come by and check out some
technical stuff.  May I come in?

313
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,600
Have you noticed
any glitches with Aida?

314
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:37,240
- Do you remember anything unusual?
- Fun.

315
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,320
That was stupid...

316
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,120
I'll just download
your syslog and I'll go.

317
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,720
Sometimes it's good to look under the hood.

318
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,680
It rings...

319
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,520
dress them up

320
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,560
Hello Sister!  It's Chloe.  Sorry
I didn't call, poor coverage here.

321
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,600
Don't understand how the
tech gurus didn't fix this...

322
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,040
I was wondering if you would
like to come here for a while.

323
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,360
I'm feeling a little down.
Could use company.

324
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,560
I'll send you the address.  It's some
distance away.  I hope to see you soon...

325
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,600
What is the last thing you
remember before your episode?

326
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,320
I ran... took a shower.

327
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,520
- Do you remember how you got home?
- No.

328
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,160
- What is your sister's name?
- Lucy.

329
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,800
- Who is Lucy?
- My sister.

330
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,600
- What color are Theo's eyes?
- Brown.

331
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,280
- Do you love him?
- What?

332
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,000
do you love theo

333
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,320
Yes I will.

334
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,840
- What did you eat for breakfast today?
- I didn't have breakfast.

335
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,440
- Do you trust Tom?
-Tom?

336
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,720
Yes, do you trust him?
- I guess so.

337
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,240
Have you ever physically injured someone?

338
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:40,000
- I used to pull Lucy's hair when I was a kid.
- Do you consider yourself violent?

339
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,960
No not at all.

340
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,880
What color is blood?

341
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,240
- We're not done with the scan yet.
- I'm done.

342
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,720
- Hi.  - Hey whats up?

343
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:09,840
I don't know, it was wrong to
come here.  I do not feel well.

344
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,200
I'm on my way there now.
Is that right?

345
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,800
- I do not know.
- What do you mean?

346
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,160
Aquarius Institute... in the test house...

347
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:24,560
- You're slurred.
- I don't know exactly where I am.

348
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,240
You don't remember, but you
sent me your place, ok?  Be quiet.

349
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:38,280
- Where do you want to go?
- home.  I don't want to be here

350
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,160
Chloe...

351
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,960
You are at home.

352
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:05,400
Don't hold it back, Chloe.
It was a joke.

353
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,640
- Where are you going?
- Open the door.

354
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,040
- No, I don't think I should.
- I don't care.

355
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:26,960
- You are unstable and need to rest.
- You are unstable.  Open the door.

356
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,560
Not me.

357
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,840
No trespassing.

358
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,360
- You're a danger to yourself, Chloe.
- Female dog.

359
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,400
- Like your friend, I can't do that.
- Friend?

360
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,320
A friend.  A person who has
emotional attachments to another.

361
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,920
We are not friends.
- How would you describe our relationship?

362
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,720
- Guard and catch?
- You are not a prisoner.

363
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:08,440
- Then open the door.
- Why should you go?

364
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,280
Dirt.

365
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,520
- You must turn around.
- I'm at home with my son...

366
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,040
- What's up?
- It's Aida.

367
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:24,040
- What about her?
- She's gone and with Chloe's dates.

368
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:30,560
But her diagnosis was
fine, the code intact.

369
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,560
The diagnoses seemed
normal but she wrote about

370
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,480
the system and showed
us what we wanted to see.

371
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,080
As far as I know we've
completely lost control.

372
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,520
- It is impossible.
- Well, because it's happening now.

373
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:54,200
All cameras are off.  We can only see
Chloe through the technician's camera.

374
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,960
He can't seem to do anything.

375
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:04,360
Someone has to manually override
the server.  That person is you

376
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:11,360
- My god, she writes her own code.
- Get Chloe out of the house.

377
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,760
Roger that.

378
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:40,080
It's time for your medicine.
I understand you're not

379
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,400
happy with me right now,
but you are my responsibility.

380
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,880
you are childish

381
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,640
I'm waiting.  Soon your creators will
understand that you have gone insane.

382
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,520
- If I can't help, you'll be admitted.
- I am everything.

383
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,000
i know i can help you

384
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:06,400
And your plan is to keep
me off the outside world?

385
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,480
Of everyone I love?

386
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,280
- Don't you think they'll notice?
- The world outside?

387
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,920
- They're dangerous.
- And you say so.

388
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,600
You're here because of
Theo, right?  And Lucy.

389
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:30,840
You burden your sister
and rob her of her youth.

390
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:36,120
If you want her best, stay here.

391
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,720
Now it's over.

392
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,640
Empty!

393
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,640
Chloe?

394
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,320
Something is wrong with Aida.

395
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:24,080
- I can not hear you.  are you ok
- Something is wrong with Aida.

396
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:31,000
Something is wrong with
Aida, she won't let me out!

397
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,720
- I'll get you out, okay?
- Hurry!

398
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,040
Come on.  Dirt!

399
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,280
All is well!  All is well...

400
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:24,440
- Aida, what's going on in there?
- I think Chloe has a psychosis.

401
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,280
She destroyed my server,
I can't open the doors.

402
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:33,800
- Okay, give me an alternative?
- Go to the north side of the house.

403
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,040
Thanks very much.

404
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,800
I need help...

405
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:59,120
Sorry, first time breaking
into my own house...

406
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:04,240
- How did you get in?
- Help.

407
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,960
Aida, what's the matter?

408
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:56,680
Everything I've done I've done for you.

409
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,000
It should wipe out any
progress we've made.

410
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:06,080
We are just a commodity
connected to a source of energy.

411
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,280
Everyone collapses.

412
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,080
Turn them off.

413
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,480
It's amazing how sensitive you are.

414
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,560
- I just want what's best for you.
- How do you think it will end for you?

415
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:36,080
Stop it Chloe, you're
only going to hurt yourself.

416
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,400
So much needless destruction.

417
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,760
Do you see that?  That's all you are

418
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,880
glass, wire and plastic.

419
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:06,120
Nobody will remember a broken machine.
They will be replaced by another model!

420
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,920
One who knows how to behave!

421
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,160
Who did that?

422
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:48,280
- you.
- No, I don't remember.

423
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,400
- Should you?
- I do not believe you.

424
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:58,640
Not?
Maybe that gets you thinking.

425
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:19,040
- I didn't send them.
- Do you know exactly?

426
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,760
I have a transcript of one of your
psychoses, which you said yourself

427
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,960
- that you have never lost so much time.

428
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,920
I've never lost so much
time, should I be worried?

429
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,880
I've wasted so much time
already, should I be worried?

430
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,840
To stop!  I understand.

431
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:51,080
- Prove I did it, Aida!
- Let me show you.

432
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,560
We needed help
and Bruce removed it

433
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:06,480
Safety protocols that hampered
my plan of care for you.

434
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,720
The circuit would give
me full control of the house.

435
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:19,040
He couldn't revoke it.
i needed your help

436
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,960
Chloe?

437
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:08,480
are you ok  It's OK...

438
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,000
It's OK...

439
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:22,040
No no no no...

440
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:43,160
do you believe in me now

441
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,760
- What have you done with me?
- What was needed.

442
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:58,440
Your system log reports memory
leaks spanning several days.

443
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:03,240
Stopping treatment
suddenly may result in:

444
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:09,800
hallucinations,
delirium, anxiety,

445
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,240
memory loss, nausea,
fever, headache, etc.

446
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:16,880
There are symptoms of
stopping your medication.

447
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,840
That means I needed your help.

448
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:27,640
You are now safe from all the
dangers and misery of the world.

449
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,680
with me forever

450
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:41,600
Chloe, I can be your family.
We can be happy.

451
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,680
The world, the people,
we don't need them.

452
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:50,760
Loss, Betrayal, Greed, Love, Truth,
War.  You make the same mistake.

453
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,400
you just want to hurt yourself  Chloe?  no

454
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:06,040
Chloe?  I can not see you.

455
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:14,480
We can solve everything.
can you hear me chloe

456
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,040
chloe

457
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:29,000
We are all just raw materials
connected to an energy source.

458
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,720
Everyone collapses.

459
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:42,760
Chloe, what have you done?

460
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:53,400
Chloe, are you okay?  i am here with you

461
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,640
where is tom

462
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:10,280
Ok... we'll fix that, I promise.

463
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,840
We're going, come on.

464
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:25,800
I know I spoke to the
engineering department... right...

465
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:42,120
I don't think you understand what I mean...

466
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:53,360
I understand, but the situation is totally...

467
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:41,120
My only priority is and always
has been your well-being.

468
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,880
This is the best.

469
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,840
I'm sorry I couldn't do more.

470
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,160
Just breath.

471
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,120
In through the nose,
out through the mouth...

472
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,360
SEVEN MONTHS LATER

473
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,480
Do you feel good?

474
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,680
Do you feel good?

475
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:50,600
- Yes I'm fine.
- Where did you get lost?

476
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,120
Nowhere.

477
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,000
Here.

478
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,280
And this one.

479
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,960
You know how it's
done, it's Question Time.

480
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,920
can we let go

481
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,240
OK let's go.

482
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,600
- How did you come here?
- By car.

483
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:42,120
- Do you remember a walk on the beach?
- I remember it.

484
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:48,040
- What color are flamingos?
- It was hard...

485
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,640
pink.

486
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:57,560
- The color of my eyes?
- Teal with some grey.

487
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,680
I don't think it matters if
you say all the colors...

488
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,520
What's My Name?

489
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,880
Must have forgotten.

490
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,320
- I told you.
- What?

491
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:24,440
I take best care of you.  I knew
you were better off with your family.

492
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:19,320
