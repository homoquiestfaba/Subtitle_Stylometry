1
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,341
Gimme back that money!

2
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,842
Pow, pow, pow!

3
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,377
I got you now!

4
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,582
Pow, pow, yeah!

5
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,555
Hey. What's up with the dolls, Beeman?

6
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:58,067
Here you go.

7
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,715
Hey, I got it right here, right here.

8
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,686
They're waiting for us.

9
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,457
<i>Yeah, you're not listening, okay?</i>

10
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,259
<i>I don't know why you're not listening,</i>

11
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,893
but you're not listening.

12
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,564
I'm already down eight million
on oil today, okay,

13
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:21,269
because some blogger says
China's going big on solar.

14
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:24,672
<i>Will, this is a huge risk.
You're overexposed.</i>

15
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,408
- It doesn't matter.
- <i>And over-leveraged.</i>

16
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:31,011
Look, I don't care if it's still
decades away from saving the world.

17
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,282
Just add another 150 points
to our position and do it fast

18
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:36,517
before the rest of the street
sees a not so sunny light.

19
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,919
- <i>Laura's on the line.</i>
- Yeah, thank you.

20
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,554
Hey, hun.

21
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,022
<i>Danny's in the principal's office.</i>

22
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,459
- What?
- He's been hit again.

23
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:47,295
Is he okay?

24
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,831
<i>Yeah, he's okay,
but he really needs his dad.</i>

25
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,301
I mean, right now?

26
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,269
I've got a kidney removal in an hour.

27
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,804
<i>There's no other doctor on call?</i>

28
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,040
Bill's here, but I'd rather
not hit him up again.

29
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,677
All right, yeah, I'll move
a few things around, okay?

30
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,679
- <i>I'll go get him.</i>
- Great.

31
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,649
- All right, thanks, hun.
- Yeah, all right, bye.

32
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,056
Hey, did the meeting with
the Saudis get moved to today?

33
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,958
Yes, 3:00 p.m.

34
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,598
Get Laura back on the phone, please?

35
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:25,999
<i>Got it.</i>

36
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,712
Fourth time this year, Will.

37
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,373
Will, what are you doing down there?

38
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,811
We're taking a trip.

39
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,714
Great, can you move my call
with GE to next week?

40
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,550
<i>Yes, absolutely, got that taken care of.</i>

41
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,618
- Perfect.
- <i>Have a good trip.</i>

42
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,854
- See you Monday, then.
- <i>Bye.</i>

43
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,493
You ready for this, kiddo?

44
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:40,468
You know, my dad took me
on my first deer hunt

45
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,869
when I was half your age.

46
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,504
I don't know, Dad.

47
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,173
Ah, come on, buddy,
you're gonna love it.

48
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,842
The rush, the feeling of accomplishment.

49
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,680
I told you, we're gonna do
everything the right way.

50
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,715
One shot, no pain, no suffering.

51
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,950
How do you know there's no suffering?

52
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:01,555
When was the last time
you got shot with a rifle?

53
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:05,526
Well, you get to see where I grew up.

54
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,896
First ten years, anyway.

55
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,198
And you'll get to see
Aunt Dottie for the first time

56
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,467
since you were a baby.

57
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,833
- All set?
- Yeah.

58
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,674
Jesus. Man, are you kidding me?

59
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,216
Marvin Howell.
That's the chief of police, Danny.

60
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,319
He was even a friend of
my dad's before his accident.

61
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,790
Dated Aunt Dottie, too, back in the day.

62
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:25,132
Let me see your license.

63
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,638
Billy Beeman? That's you?

64
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,105
Just Will now, sir.

65
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,274
William, right?
Your name is William,

66
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,844
but everybody calls you Billy?

67
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,346
- You remember?
- I do remember, yes.

68
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,314
Hey, this is my family,
this is Laura, my wife.

69
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:44,618
- How do you do?
- My son back there, Danny.

70
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,253
Hey, Danny, how you doing?

71
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,495
He's a very smart kid.

72
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,630
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about that close call.

73
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:59,900
I, uh, I don't know,
I wasn't paying attention.

74
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:04,705
I'm okay, you're okay, you're okay.

75
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,339
What brings you home?

76
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,409
Actually, we're going
for a weekend at Dottie's.

77
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,344
Gonna show Danny where I'm from.

78
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,780
Hm.

79
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,214
Roughing it?

80
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,243
Well, you're in for a treat, young man.

81
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,286
This little town is truly a gem.

82
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:23,223
You folks have yourself a nice visit.

83
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,192
Hey, thank you.

84
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,294
I'll only ask you for one favor.

85
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,697
I want you to keep your eyes open, okay?

86
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,210
We had a little trouble at the bank,
and I'm advising everybody

87
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,401
to exercise caution till it's resolved.

88
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,636
All right, will do.

89
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,339
And...

90
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,074
Drive carefully.

91
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,110
Thank you, sir.

92
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,300
All right, kiddo, come on.

93
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,272
Who's hungry?

94
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,842
The fridge is full, and
the place is all ready for you.

95
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,245
Daniel, you come give
your great aunt a hug!

96
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,713
Go on, give her a hug.

97
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:23,751
There's my little man!

98
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:27,320
God, it's been so long!

99
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,224
- Laura, honey.
- Hi, Dottie.

100
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,062
And there's my favorite nephew!

101
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:41,034
- Only nephew.
- Oh, well, who's counting?

102
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:44,237
You're not taking that thing
out tomorrow? Are you?

103
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:47,440
- Yeah, why not?
- That thing's gonna get stuck

104
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,177
before you can get started.
You take the Ridgeline.

105
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,313
That'll handle anything up there.

106
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,756
- <i>Hey, Marv, what's up?</i>
- How you doing?

107
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:43,163
Do you have anything to tell me?

108
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,035
For thousands of years,

109
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:52,706
men have viewed hunting as something

110
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,908
much more than just
a means of survival, Danny.

111
00:12:55,242 --> 00:13:00,280
Okay, it's... it's a test of
character and courage.

112
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,951
I mean, the singular act

113
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,887
of tracking another
living creature, Danny,

114
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,224
and then possessing the will
and the skill to end its life.

115
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,198
All right, maybe this'll help.

116
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,603
Whoa, cool!

117
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,975
This was your grandfather's rifle.

118
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,579
He left it to me when he died.

119
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:36,016
One day, when you're ready,
it'll be yours.

120
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,418
Can I hold it?

121
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,287
Of course, kiddo, that's why we're here.

122
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,857
All right, but first,
there's some rules, okay?

123
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,326
Well, there's three of 'em.

124
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:50,931
Safety, safety, and safety, you got it?

125
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,033
- Mm-hm.
- This is a dangerous weapon.

126
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,302
I need you to promise me
you're gonna be extra careful.

127
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,571
- I promise.
- I'm serious.

128
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,074
- I am, too.
- All right, buddy.

129
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,442
Let me show you how to hold it.

130
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:09,950
Now, you grip it with your
left hand here, all right,

131
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,518
and you get the butt of the rifle

132
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,453
right into your shoulder,
just like that.

133
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,189
That's how you brace yourself, okay?

134
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,891
Now, the safety's on,

135
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,645
but you never put your finger
on the trigger

136
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,616
until you're ready to take
your shot, okay?

137
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,430
All right.

138
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,543
This, right here, this is
how you load the cartridge.

139
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:28,201
It's called bolt action.

140
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,503
- See that?
- Mm-hm.

141
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,239
There we go.

142
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:47,921
Now just imagine a huge
whitetail steps out of the brush.

143
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:51,258
And I'm talking a 12-point, 275 pounds,

144
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,326
a real prize animal.

145
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,397
And you got a clear shot,
just for a second,

146
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,168
so you line him up, you put
him dead in your cross hairs,

147
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:05,505
take a deep breath,
steady your nerve, and then...

148
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,208
Then what?

149
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,613
Well, then you find out
what you're really made of.

150
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,416
Wanna give it a try?

151
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,253
- What do you say?
- Yeah.

152
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,455
All right, let's do it. Here.

153
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,442
Now that's a loaded weapon,
all right? Safety's still on.

154
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,378
When you're ready.

155
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,286
That's all right.

156
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,288
First one's practice, come on.

157
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,631
Dang it.

158
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,366
It's okay, it's not easy.

159
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,700
Try again.

160
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:16,076
All right, Danny.
Just take your time, okay?

161
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:19,479
Take your time, I want you to focus.

162
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,082
Whoa-ho-ho!

163
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,584
That's my boy!

164
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,187
- Good job, buddy.
- Thanks.

165
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,058
All right, let's try again
with your eyes open, okay?

166
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,525
Dinner's ready!

167
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,728
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Danny.

168
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,798
You never point your gun
at another person, ever.

169
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,035
- Safety, safety, safety.
- Good.

170
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,404
- Let's go get something to eat.
- Okay.

171
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,513
Come on, kiddo.

172
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:07,294
- What's the matter?
- You know where I stand.

173
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,697
Danny is who he is,
he doesn't need to change.

174
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,700
Him getting bullied doesn't
make him weak or inferior.

175
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,236
It's the problem with
the bully, not Danny.

176
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,606
Laura, no one's trying
to change him, okay?

177
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,775
But I mean, he's gotta learn
how to stand up for himself

178
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:27,347
and not be pushed around.

179
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,585
If you get out there, and he doesn't
wanna pull the trigger, don't make him.

180
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,106
Hey, kiddo.

181
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,808
Kiddo, time to wake up.

182
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:06,186
- It's not even light out, yet.
- Early bird catches the buck.

183
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,656
Come on.

184
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,898
One of my best memories of
grandpa is hunting in these woods.

185
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,285
Hey, check it out.

186
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,586
Cool.

187
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,831
Let's put your hood up.

188
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,366
Oh, I got you!

189
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,436
- I got you.
- Come on, Dad. Come on.

190
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,472
Come on.

191
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,708
Keep your hood up.

192
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:46,819
What's that?

193
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,589
Oh, that's a tree blind.

194
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,925
Hunters build them so
they have a hidden vantage

195
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,228
to gaze down their prey.

196
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,864
You know, sometimes they'll
spend days up in one of those,

197
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,566
waiting for just the right buck.

198
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,334
That's not fair.

199
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,239
Danny, fair's got nothin' to do with it.

200
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,911
Now let's hold up here.

201
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,920
Grab a sip.

202
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,481
All right, we're not actually
that far from the car.

203
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,350
There's a road right up
there that leads back

204
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,785
once we bag our deer, all right?

205
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,887
Come on, Dad,
we've been here all morning.

206
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,056
We haven't seen a thing.

207
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,625
Yeah, well we're not going anywhere.

208
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,992
Patience, buddy.

209
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:13,606
Dad. Dad, Dad.

210
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,342
Look.

211
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,951
Get down, get down, get down.

212
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,726
All right.

213
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:37,397
Chamber your round.

214
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:45,572
All right, take a deep breath.

215
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:50,443
And when you're ready, it's all you.

216
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,451
Okay.

217
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:05,992
It's all right.

218
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,428
Here, give me that.

219
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,400
He's probably the guy
from that ATV we saw.

220
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,435
Keep walking.

221
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,072
What's going on, Dad?

222
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,709
It's fine, it's nothing, all right?

223
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:24,877
Just stay here, one sec.

224
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,391
I told you, it's in a safe place.

225
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:39,945
Fuck you, that wasn't the arrangement.

226
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,895
I know, but there was
this car at the drop.

227
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,799
I swear, the guy inside
looked right at me.

228
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,469
Looked, I panicked and
took off to stash the bag.

229
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,404
Then where, where did
the fuck did you put it?

230
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:56,809
Listen, shouldn't we sit on
this a week or two, anyway?

231
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:59,479
What with all this heat on us now?

232
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:03,616
You are one stupid motherfucker,
you know that?

233
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,117
Fuck you.

234
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,166
I should've known you'd steal it,
you fucking hillbilly.

235
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:23,135
I didn't steal it, man,
the drop went bad.

236
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,672
You want it today?

237
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,942
I'll take you there.

238
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:33,613
You just give me my cut,
and we're through.

239
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,715
Just as we planned.

240
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,850
Well that plan is long gone now.

241
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,164
New plan is you got five seconds

242
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:42,792
to tell me where the fuck that bag is.

243
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,534
Yeah, I'll take you there.

244
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:57,737
You're just gonna kill me anyway.

245
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,818
Oopsie daisy.

246
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:15,755
You're a stupid motherfucker,
you know that?

247
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,457
Now nobody gets it.

248
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,149
Danny, shh.

249
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,719
Who's there?

250
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:52,559
Huh? I know someone's there, come out!

251
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,160
I said, come out!

252
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:58,565
Shh, Danny, it's okay, all right?

253
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,066
You hear?

254
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:11,243
I know you're there, come out!
Come out!

255
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,151
Dad!

256
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,253
Danny!

257
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,623
Stay there, Danny.

258
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,220
Fuck me.

259
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,789
<i>Dad!</i>

260
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,158
Stay there!

261
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,193
Dad, look!

262
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,698
Look, he's alive!

263
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,281
Danny, come here, now!

264
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,987
Shit. Shit.

265
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,190
Here, take this.

266
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,194
- What are you doing?
- Taking him to mom.

267
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,962
What about that thing
he threw over there?

268
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,864
I saw where it went.

269
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:14,667
This man's bleeding to death, come on!

270
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:16,035
Should we go get it?

271
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,404
Daniel, come on!

272
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,911
Laura!

273
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:26,813
Guys?

274
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,782
Oh my God, what happened?

275
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,952
He was shot.
Danny, go get some towels.

276
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,322
- Who is he?
- Uh, I have no idea.

277
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:40,159
He just appeared in the woods.

278
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,829
Laura, you've gotta do something.
He's lost a ton of blood.

279
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,030
Did you shoot him?

280
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,298
- What, no!
- Did Danny?

281
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,434
No, no, he was with
another guy, all right?

282
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,870
They were arguing about something,

283
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,983
and the other guy just
fucking shot him, point blank!

284
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,073
Why?

285
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,843
I don't know, all right?

286
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,978
I think he owed him money or something.

287
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,947
Um, where's the other guy now?

288
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,987
Danny, go play some video games.

289
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,290
Will, where is the other guy now?

290
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,492
I killed him.

291
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,494
You shot a man in front of our son?

292
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,864
I had no choice, all right?
We'd witnessed what he'd done.

293
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:19,921
He was gonna shoot us next,
it was self-defense.

294
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:20,465
What are you...

295
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,066
Hey, look, you weren't there, all right?

296
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,203
I did what I had to do!

297
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:27,740
Now can you please fucking
help this guy before he dies?!

298
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,780
He needs a hospital.

299
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,248
Yeah, well there's no time.
The nearest one's an hour away.

300
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:39,118
- We'll call for an airlift.
- Laura, you know better than I do,

301
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,087
this guy's running out
of time, all right?

302
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,855
Do something.

303
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,891
Hey, wake up!

304
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,793
Wake up!

305
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:49,428
There's bandages and gauze in my bag.

306
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,330
All right.

307
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,354
This is gonna hurt.

308
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:52,391
He's all right.

309
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,160
How are you doing?

310
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,429
Yeah, all right.

311
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:01,968
I'm gonna go up to Dottie's
and call him an ambulance.

312
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:05,037
Hey, Laura. Just hold on
a second, would you?

313
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:06,572
What?

314
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,908
Listen, it's just right now,

315
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:11,978
we're the only ones who know about this.

316
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,411
Why don't we just wait
for this guy to wake up

317
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,847
and tell us what happened?

318
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,182
What are you so worried about?

319
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,950
Hun, I mean, if it was
really self-defense,

320
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:21,020
- it's not gonna be a problem...
- He was a cop.

321
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:25,491
Laura, the guy I shot was a fucking cop.

322
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,097
Shh.

323
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:52,144
You let go of my son right now.

324
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:55,447
I can't do that, mister.
I need him.

325
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,049
What for?

326
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,451
Put the gun down.

327
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:02,121
Put the gun down!

328
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:05,391
All right, all right, all right.

329
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,699
He says he knows where my key landed.

330
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,468
I need that key more
than you can understand.

331
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:18,102
There's gonna be cops
all over that place

332
00:32:18,126 --> 00:32:20,207
any minute now, so I gotta get there.

333
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:23,509
All right, all right, all right.
Why don't you take me instead?

334
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,577
Okay, I saw where it landed, too.

335
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,713
I mean, come on, he's just a kid.

336
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:32,084
You don't expect him to
remember the exact spot, do you?

337
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,220
I'll take my chances.

338
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:38,624
All right, then we all go.

339
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:45,964
Dottie!

340
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:51,670
It's okay, buddy.

341
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,373
Just hop in the back seat, okay?

342
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,346
Buckle up, kiddo.

343
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:01,547
Okay.

344
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,218
Giddyup, city boy.

345
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,397
Will!

346
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,304
- You all right, Danny?
- Yeah, I'm okay, Dad.

347
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,010
Know where you're going?

348
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,513
Yeah.

349
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:39,385
You wanna tell me
what happened back there?

350
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,524
You seem like nice people.

351
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:49,095
I hope you get back to
that cabin before the cops do.

352
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:51,730
If so, I suggest you head home.

353
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,316
Why don't you let my son stay here?

354
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,352
I think he's been through
enough for one day.

355
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,692
Come on, man.

356
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:24,363
I don't need him seeing that body again.

357
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,137
Thank you.

358
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,940
All right, buddy,
you're gonna stay here.

359
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:38,210
I'll be right back, okay?
Just keep the doors locked,

360
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:42,414
and if you see anything,
honk as loud as you can, okay?

361
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,183
All right.

362
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:52,491
Can't have you trying to run off, now.

363
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,222
It's just up here.

364
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,257
Take me right there.

365
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,596
Freeze!

366
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,239
Stechel.

367
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,910
Don't do this.

368
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:49,181
- Don't do it.
- Get me that key.

369
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:51,317
Please, don't do it.

370
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,490
Ah, fuck!

371
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,930
Find the help wanted
notice board outside Earl's.

372
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,832
Meet me there.

373
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,235
Meet me there!

374
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:12,204
Ah.

375
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:23,849
Ah!

376
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,619
Damn it, my son's in there!

377
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:35,327
Dad! Dad!

378
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:36,828
Buckle up.

379
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,639
Fuck!

380
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,835
Get down and stay down!

381
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,785
Stop that.

382
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:09,388
We're just gonna play a game.

383
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,557
It's called Dukes of Hazard.

384
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,360
Shit.

385
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:51,363
Don't shoot! Hey!

386
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:55,033
- Please stop!
- Get down, and stay down!

387
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:10,782
Dad!

388
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,876
Don't fuckin' move!

389
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,682
My son is in that car.

390
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:49,655
Was there another officer
out here with that man?

391
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:56,094
Yeah. He's dead.

392
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,436
Shh.

393
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:41,172
I'm sorry.

394
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,942
Danny.

395
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,804
Goddamn shame.

396
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,842
Laura, come here.

397
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,900
Have you talked to anyone about
what happened this morning?

398
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,217
No, Dottie wasn't home, I couldn't call.

399
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:28,754
You sure? What about the cop
who drove you here.

400
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:31,723
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothing.

401
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,928
Nobody else saw this?

402
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:41,099
Nobody else heard this,
nobody heard any fuckin' gunshot?

403
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,006
All right, listen.

404
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,810
Danny and I never came back
to the cabin this morning, got it?

405
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,846
- Okay.
- We went out for our hunt...

406
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,916
We went out for our hunt, and
this is the first you've seen me since.

407
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,985
You don't know anything
about anyone getting shot

408
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,053
or stitching up any wounds
or anything, okay?

409
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:04,990
- What are you talking about?
- I can get Danny back.

410
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,694
- How?
- He offered me an exchange.

411
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:12,230
- What, like ransom?
- Before he was shot.

412
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,265
The guy through a key into a bush.

413
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,868
If I get it for him, Danny goes free.

414
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:18,770
- Then do it!
- I'm going to,

415
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,773
but it means not a word to
the cops until Danny's safe, okay?

416
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:24,976
Just get him back.

417
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:29,681
Will Beeman?

418
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:32,918
Twice in two days?

419
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,786
You wanna tell me what's going on here?

420
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,090
Yeah, um, I was out
taking my son for a hunt

421
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:41,159
when two men appeared out of nowhere.

422
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,895
The first guy caught me by surprise,
grabbed my Remington.

423
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:48,199
Levi Barrett is his name.
You've never seen him before?

424
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:53,104
He say or give anything to you?

425
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,273
Like what?

426
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:01,079
The Remington isn't your
pop's old shooter, is it?

427
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:05,851
So Levi snatches your stick
and turns on my officer.

428
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:09,755
Yeah, they both fired at the same time.

429
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:12,157
Officer Stechel got off a few rounds,

430
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,760
couple went into the side
of that barn over there.

431
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,795
How long was this before Richie arrived?

432
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:20,231
I don't know, maybe five minutes?

433
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,168
He says the boy was already
in the vehicle when he got here.

434
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:25,070
Doesn't make sense.

435
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:29,808
Yeah, well, uh, after Levi was shot,

436
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,321
he was in pretty rough shape,
so he went over there to sit down

437
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:36,347
and collect himself, and I sent Danny
up to the car to get a first aid kit,

438
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:39,818
and that's what he was doing
when Officer Richie arrived.

439
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:46,725
This is Officer Tom Davies.
One of my best and brightest.

440
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:50,128
He'll take care of anything you
need until you find your son.

441
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,398
All right.

442
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:01,239
How long did it take you
to walk up that ridge?

443
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:02,841
A few minutes.

444
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:05,944
You hear any shots on the way up?

445
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,382
Something doesn't feel right.

446
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,816
You think he's working with Levi...

447
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,385
I think he's lying, is what I think,

448
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:17,355
and if he is, I can't figure out why.

449
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:21,760
You stay on him, I'll handle Levi.

450
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:27,866
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.

451
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:30,001
That's what all kidnappers say.

452
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:32,938
How would you know?

453
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,741
Because I watch TV.

454
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:37,776
How old are you?

455
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,177
Eleven.

456
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,046
Where are you taking me?

457
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,414
I'm not taking you anywhere.

458
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:45,316
I'm just trying to stay alive.

459
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,119
Why do you need me?

460
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:51,089
I made a deal with your dad
to get me my key.

461
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:56,394
If I let you go,
he's got no reason to do it.

462
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,930
What if he doesn't bring it?

463
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:01,032
He will.

464
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:03,869
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?

465
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,973
Haven't thought that far ahead yet.

466
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,710
That's when you start hurting me.

467
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:17,916
Why'd that cop shoot you?

468
00:45:19,785 --> 00:45:23,288
Uh, it's grown up stuff.

469
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:25,123
Like making babies?

470
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:30,495
Yeah. Like making babies.

471
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:47,178
What are we doing?

472
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:50,148
Here? Walk.

473
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,903
You better be right about all this.

474
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:15,206
What'd you want me to do,
tell 'em I killed a cop?

475
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,346
Look, as soon as it's dark out,

476
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:25,817
I'm gonna go get that key
and find Levi, okay?

477
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:27,518
He's just a boy, Will.

478
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,460
He's a smart kid, all right?
He's gonna be fine.

479
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,165
I'm gonna make it fine, I promise.

480
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:05,957
Got a favorite game on that thing?

481
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:10,528
- Yeah, I got a lot of games.
- What's your favorite?

482
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,097
I don't know.

483
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,235
Well, I got some cool games
where we're going.

484
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:19,270
Killer Instinct's still my favorite.

485
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:22,607
My parents don't let me play that.

486
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,877
Ah. More grown up stuff.

487
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:30,916
Killer Instinct's one
to look forward to.

488
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:33,251
It's got some crazy shit.

489
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,190
Sorry. Gotta watch my tongue.

490
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:42,493
- Did it hurt?
- What?

491
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,330
- Getting shot?
- Ooh, wee.

492
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,433
Like a motherfucker. Oh.

493
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:54,605
Sugar snaps, I, uh, did it again.

494
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:10,155
There you are!

495
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:13,158
- Who the hell is this?
- It's Danny.

496
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:15,593
And you're supposed to be
watching the TV, keeping tabs.

497
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:19,064
- I just checked, nothing new.
- You sure?

498
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:22,100
After what I've been through today,
I thought Anderson Cooper'd

499
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,969
be checked in to the Beaumont by now.

500
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:25,536
Jesus.

501
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,906
His ma's the one who fixed me up.

502
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:31,542
I gotta go pee.

503
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:34,679
Oh, be my guest, right through there.

504
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:43,054
Just don't scare the kid.

505
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,780
<i>Still no suspects in Thursday night's...</i>

506
00:49:10,804 --> 00:49:12,483
<i>Granville First National heist.</i>

507
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:15,753
<i>Police say they vow to return
all 2.3 million to the bank,</i>

508
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,389
<i>despite it being federally insured.</i>

509
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:20,725
<i>Bailouts are not the Granville way,</i>

510
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:24,195
<i>stressed police chief, Marvin Howell.</i>

511
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:41,379
<i>No, I ain't nobody's taxi to no place.</i>

512
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:43,681
<i>But he can't stay here the night,
they're gonna find us.</i>

513
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,317
<i>We have to stay here
until I get the key.</i>

514
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:49,654
<i>Just trust me, I know what I'm doing.</i>

515
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,661
You fall in?

516
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,233
Danny, you come on out now.

517
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,140
Danny!

518
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:13,644
There you are.

519
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,614
I though you might've try
to slither down the drain.

520
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,753
Oh, uh, that's Adele's mom.

521
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:24,655
Say hi, Mabel.

522
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:31,429
What's wrong with her?

523
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:32,797
What isn't wrong with her?

524
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:36,567
Diabetes, onset chronic renal failure,

525
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:38,703
80-pound tumor in her gut.

526
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:43,241
Eighty pounds?
That's more than I weigh.

527
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:47,112
Even with health insurance,
she can't afford proper treatment.

528
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:50,215
All right, yeah, uh, come on.

529
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:53,318
I'll show you them games
I was talking about.

530
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,826
Daryl, yeah, it's Levi.
Yeah, right, I need a favor.

531
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:06,264
Uh, you know that help wanted
notice board outside Earl's?

532
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,499
Yeah, that's the one.

533
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,468
Now write this down.

534
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,404
All right, I think it's dark enough.

535
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:14,705
I'm gonna head off.

536
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,308
Please just bring him home.

537
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:18,743
I will.

538
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:27,585
And, Will, if you do encounter Howell,
just... be careful.

539
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,121
This heist is the biggest crime

540
00:51:30,155 --> 00:51:31,556
to hit Granville in decades,

541
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:35,360
and he's gonna solve it
one way or the other.

542
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,728
Take the jeep.

543
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,898
Thanks, Dottie.

544
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,653
Officer.

545
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,623
- Give me the key.
- What key?

546
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,861
Oh, yeah that key.

547
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:19,797
Okay.

548
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:25,436
Here you go.

549
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:22,627
What the... what the fuck?

550
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,435
Beeman.

551
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:32,937
You're fuckin' dead, Beeman!

552
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,809
You're having bad luck
with keys tonight.

553
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:41,011
Fuckin' dead, Beeman!

554
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,417
Beeman! Beeman!

555
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:47,752
I swear to...

556
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:52,523
How'd you even do that?

557
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:53,958
Those are good.

558
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:59,430
Ah... sugar snaps.

559
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:04,502
Yes.

560
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,372
I knew you'd like it.

561
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:08,806
Just don't tell my dad, okay?

562
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:11,308
It's our secret.

563
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,847
Why'd you rob that bank anyway?

564
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:20,485
Same reason anybody does.

565
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,854
Money.

566
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:27,458
I figured my cut'd be enough
to cover Mabel's medical care,

567
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:30,127
till I could put a ring
on Adele's finger.

568
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,431
Mabel's all the family she's got.

569
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:36,967
She matters to Adele, she matters to me.

570
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,839
So, what went wrong with the robbery?

571
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,876
It was wrong from the start.

572
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,913
Should've known I was there
only to take the fall.

573
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,781
They told me all I had to do

574
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:53,751
was crawl through that tunnel
they dug and fill the bag.

575
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:55,920
Everything else was already square.

576
00:55:55,953 --> 00:56:00,090
The alarm, security camera, loot itself.

577
00:56:00,118 --> 00:56:02,158
See, there was this armored truck
rolls through town

578
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:05,563
every other Thursday
carrying over $2 million.

579
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:07,898
Feeding the town, two weeks at a time.

580
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:10,034
Been that way 50 years.

581
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,973
So, you got caught?

582
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:20,077
I got out of the bank just fine,

583
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,948
but when I drove to the old
feeder mine to make the drop,

584
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:26,517
there was this car in the lot.

585
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,185
Place has been closed near 10 years.

586
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,154
Should've been empty.

587
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:31,889
It was probably just some driver

588
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:35,860
trying to catch some shut eye,
but he spooked me good.

589
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,796
I bolted.

590
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:41,532
Probably the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

591
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:44,769
'Cause now I know them
Stechels would've killed me

592
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:46,904
the second I gave up that bag.

593
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,545
Here, don't worry about that.

594
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:57,114
Rematch.

595
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:46,030
Place has been tossed, sir.

596
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:48,533
Yeah, probably by Charlie.

597
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:50,901
The girlfriend's place is empty, too?

598
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:53,203
<i>No one's seen Adele since Thursday.</i>

599
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:56,707
Does Levi have any family
or friends we can question?

600
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:58,676
Man likes his solitude.

601
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:01,045
What else I don't get is
why he took the boy.

602
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:03,881
He's already got the money, right?
Why take a hostage?

603
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:06,884
Are you telling me there isn't
one usable piece of evidence

604
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:08,653
in that entire apartment?

605
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:12,890
Not unless Levi's got some cancer
we don't know about.

606
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:17,027
There's a whole stack of
tumor removal pamphlets here.

607
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:19,930
Cancer?

608
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:23,834
Chief Howell, line one.

609
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:28,072
Marvin, how can I help you?

610
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:30,841
Listen, do you have a patient
named Levi Barrett

611
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,811
on any tumor patient lists over there?

612
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,013
<i>Now, you know I'm not
allowed to tell you that.</i>

613
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:40,184
Laverne, it's off the record,
just like always.

614
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:43,153
<i>Nope, no Levi Barrett anywhere.</i>

615
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:47,224
- What about Adele Fantion?
- <i>No Adele Fantion either.</i>

616
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,227
Oh, wait. We got a Mabel Fantion.

617
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,164
Her primary contact is daughter,
Adele Fantion.

618
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:22,727
Anybody home?

619
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,096
Drop that gun now.

620
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,837
On the floor, now!

621
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:47,111
The hell are you doing here?

622
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:50,647
I was just trying to find my son.

623
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:55,986
You're here alone?

624
01:00:57,454 --> 01:00:59,790
Who else would I bring?

625
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:02,159
Didn't I tell you to wait for my call?

626
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,028
You think I'm not doing my job?

627
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:06,697
No, no, no, that's not what I...

628
01:01:06,731 --> 01:01:10,400
How did you know to come here anyway?

629
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:14,739
Uh, you know, just asking
around town about Levi.

630
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:18,442
Really? Asking around?

631
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:22,379
Like some sort of door-to-door canvass?

632
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:25,415
And what exactly were you
planning to do when you got here?

633
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:29,053
Politely request that Levi
just give you your son back?

634
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:31,756
Or maybe you're gonna shoot him first?

635
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:36,093
Unless you got something else to trade.

636
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:41,932
That's what's going on here?
You have something Levi wants?

637
01:01:41,966 --> 01:01:44,168
No, no, no, no, no, no.

638
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:50,775
Just like your dad.
I see that now.

639
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:54,979
So I want you to hear me
loud and clear, Billy.

640
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:59,249
Just let me do my job, and
this ends well for everyone.

641
01:02:07,992 --> 01:02:10,127
What's wrong with her?

642
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,862
The biggest thing wrong
with her right now

643
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:15,399
is how unhelpful that she's being.

644
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,236
What?

645
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,008
One more time a little louder, hun.

646
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:26,510
Thirsty.

647
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,014
Thirsty.

648
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:33,417
She's thirsty.

649
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:37,354
Well.

650
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:40,524
Why didn't you say so?

651
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:43,327
I'll get you some water.

652
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,295
Jesus Christ.

653
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:54,504
- <i>Chief Howell? Peterson, here.</i>
- What is it, Peterson?

654
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:57,041
<i>It's about Will Beeman, sir.</i>

655
01:02:57,074 --> 01:03:00,544
<i>We think he's lying about
the shooting this morning.</i>

656
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:03,213
Go to secure channel four.

657
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:23,800
Do you know where my son is?

658
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:40,550
<i>We found the two shell casings
from Charlie's side on 'em.</i>

659
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:43,087
<i>But one was no where near the other.</i>

660
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,422
<i>We think Charlie shot
Levi out in a clearing,</i>

661
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:47,858
<i>then walked over to
the barn and fired again.</i>

662
01:03:47,892 --> 01:03:50,895
Making it unlikely that
Levi fired that rifle?

663
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:52,930
<i>Copy that.</i>

664
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,435
Good work, officer.

665
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:24,361
Here you go, one glass of
Granville lager at your service.

666
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,866
Where'd he go?

667
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,971
Where did he go?!

668
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:40,911
It's just up here.

669
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:46,050
- I lost my iPod.
- What?

670
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:50,220
I think it fell out
of my pocket back there.

671
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,459
That's all right,
I'm sure your mom and pop

672
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:59,096
- will swing for a new one.
- I want my mom and dad.

673
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:03,367
You'll get them real soon,
buddy, I promise.

674
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,970
Here.

675
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:10,340
I barely knew your dad,

676
01:05:10,374 --> 01:05:13,410
but what he did to Charlie this morning,

677
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:15,345
that's not easy to do.

678
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:19,283
And he did it to protect you.

679
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:23,420
You think he can't handle
finding you out in the woods?

680
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:28,025
Now, as soon as he gets here,
this'll all be over.

681
01:05:28,993 --> 01:05:30,327
It'll just be some cool story

682
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,130
you can tell your friends
back at school.

683
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:36,633
I don't really have many friends.

684
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:40,304
Aw. Then it will just be some cool story

685
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:43,974
you can use to help you make some.

686
01:05:44,008 --> 01:05:45,342
Believe me.

687
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:51,048
Hey, who wouldn't wanna be friends

688
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:53,083
with a tough kid like you?

689
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:01,591
And, uh, look.

690
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:04,461
There's my bunker.

691
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,264
Where?

692
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:10,634
Exactly.

693
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:33,390
Oh, here, sit down, Danny.

694
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,351
Fuck!

695
01:07:45,462 --> 01:07:48,232
Drop that bag!

696
01:07:48,265 --> 01:07:49,599
Are you kidding me?

697
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:53,837
Drop that bag.
You're under arrest.

698
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,806
Oh, yeah, what for?

699
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,276
For murdering an officer of the law.

700
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:02,446
And aiding a bank heist, you idiot!

701
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:05,882
Aw, man, you got this all wrong.

702
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,418
All right, I know this
doesn't look good,

703
01:08:08,452 --> 01:08:11,655
but I can explain, all right?

704
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,290
Yeah.

705
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:17,727
All right, it's true.

706
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:20,897
I killed Charlie Stechel.
It was self-defense.

707
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,900
I was just trying to protect my son.

708
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,837
We saw him shoot Levi without
provocation, all right?

709
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:30,674
And then he turned on me and Danny,
he was gonna kill us!

710
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:32,387
And I'm pretty sure
that Charlie and Richie

711
01:08:32,411 --> 01:08:33,777
did the bank job with Levi.

712
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,812
Shut up. Highly unlikely, Billy.

713
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,648
The Stechel brothers are
two of my finest officers.

714
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:40,402
Yeah, well, there's
no other explanation for

715
01:08:40,404 --> 01:08:42,164
why they were all out
in the woods like that.

716
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:47,191
Yes, I'll be sure to look into
it as soon as this is all over.

717
01:08:47,224 --> 01:08:50,360
What is this?
This looks like a rendezvous map.

718
01:08:50,394 --> 01:08:52,396
No, it's not like that, all right?

719
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:57,334
Look, Levi told me to come here,
and to get the money for him,

720
01:08:57,367 --> 01:09:00,170
and... and... and he insist
that I not tell the cops,

721
01:09:00,204 --> 01:09:02,206
- what was I supposed to do?
- Tell the cops!

722
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:03,165
Come on, man.

723
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:05,343
Why would you even attempt
something like this?

724
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:07,311
I didn't attempt anything, all right?

725
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:09,011
I'm just trying to get
my son back alive.

726
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:11,315
What is it? You need a new rush?

727
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:16,520
You're not listening.
Levi Barrett took my son

728
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:20,190
because his accomplices,
your fucking officers,

729
01:09:20,224 --> 01:09:21,858
were gonna kill him.

730
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,427
All right, now I'm begging you,

731
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,262
that money is the only way
to get Danny back.

732
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:27,631
Why don't you just pay him
out of your own pocket?

733
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:31,268
Because that's not what he asked for,
this isn't a normal ransom situation.

734
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:34,538
Of course not, you'd rather
give him other people's money.

735
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:38,808
Just let me take this money
and go get my kid.

736
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:41,511
Please. And then once he's safe,

737
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:43,713
you can do whatever you want
with Levi Barrett.

738
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:47,551
Hey, hey, hey!
You do not call the shots.

739
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:12,376
You ready to get your son?

740
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:16,446
You're not taking me in?

741
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,616
Levi's expecting you this morning.

742
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:22,486
The longer we wait,
the more suspicious he becomes.

743
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:23,999
He'll think either you're not coming,

744
01:10:24,023 --> 01:10:26,593
or you went to the police.

745
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:30,594
You're just gonna do
this alone, no back up?

746
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:34,364
I got you and the money.
What else do I need?

747
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:42,939
Let's go.

748
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:48,372
I don't blame you for not grabbing 'em.

749
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:51,975
Never easy being the one
holding all the cards.

750
01:11:53,377 --> 01:11:55,512
You're lucky I didn't run away.

751
01:11:55,545 --> 01:12:00,550
Where would you have gone?
We're miles from anywhere, kid?

752
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:03,387
My back.

753
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,789
Here, why don't you go
grab us some firewood.

754
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:07,724
I packed breakfast.

755
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:11,461
Laura!

756
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:16,600
Laura, honey, breakfast is ready!

757
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:20,937
Laura?

758
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:24,340
Lau...?

759
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:35,719
Hello?

760
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:39,956
She what?

761
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:42,992
I'll be right there.

762
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:50,500
So this is where Levi hid all that time?

763
01:12:50,534 --> 01:12:53,002
We combed this area a dozen times.

764
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:55,605
You know the story?

765
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:57,941
He sat up there close to a half a year.

766
01:12:57,974 --> 01:12:59,876
Got me all kinds of bad press,

767
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:03,179
nearly had the town rooting for him.

768
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:08,585
Truth is, I enjoyed every minute of it.

769
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:12,388
Exhilaration, tracking your prey.

770
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,425
Hemingway said it best.

771
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:20,530
"There is no hunting
like the hunting of man."

772
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:25,068
I guess maybe you got a
little taste of that now, huh?

773
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:27,136
After killing Charlie.

774
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:33,042
Fuckin' ay.

775
01:13:41,685 --> 01:13:44,588
Richie, this is Tom, come in, over.

776
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:47,524
<i>Stechel, what's your 20?</i>

777
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:52,061
Shut up, bitch!

778
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:55,999
<i>Richie, this is Tom, come in, over.</i>

779
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:02,839
What were you and your dad
doing out in the woods anyway?

780
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:05,542
Took me on a hunting trip.

781
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:07,143
Whitetail.

782
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:11,615
Ah. You wanted to be
a big man hunter, huh?

783
01:14:11,648 --> 01:14:12,949
No.

784
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,151
Well.

785
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:17,954
Why was he teaching you?

786
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:23,960
Oh, little city boy and
his son bonding, huh?

787
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:35,071
There's this kid at school
that keeps beating me up,

788
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:40,610
and he thought that hunting
would... I don't know.

789
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:43,680
I tried to tell him
it was a stupid idea,

790
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:45,749
but he wouldn't listen.

791
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,585
Well.

792
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,255
Especially since you
already got what it takes

793
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:54,057
to handle a bully.

794
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,562
It's true.

795
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:04,868
See, bullies are about
one thing, intimidation.

796
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:07,003
And they feed off fear.

797
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:12,609
You take that away from 'em,
you stop 'em cold.

798
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:18,782
And I seen you not be
intimidated in spades.

799
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,853
You know when you're
playing your video games

800
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:30,226
and you're fully into it and
focused, ready for anything?

801
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,861
It's like you're outside of yourself,

802
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:35,832
but in control of this warrior.

803
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:41,337
That's the attitude you gotta
give a bully. Completely still.

804
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:46,643
In your mind, you're able to
change what's about to happen.

805
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:50,146
In your heart, there's no fear.

806
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:56,853
There is nothing he can do to
you that you can't overcome.

807
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:03,927
You stare at him,
think you're unstoppable.

808
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,895
You shake your head.

809
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,166
No more.

810
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:19,843
That'll back 'em down,
99 times out of 100.

811
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:22,846
What about that one time it doesn't?

812
01:16:22,879 --> 01:16:24,681
Well.

813
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:30,787
In that case, son, you just
hit 'em with all you got.

814
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:34,157
Or run.

815
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:38,094
Hey, no shame in either.

816
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:43,032
Just like you did with Charlie,
before you threw that key.

817
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:46,970
Yeah, something like that.

818
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:49,272
Danny.

819
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:55,144
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

820
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,348
It's okay.

821
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:20,003
You remind me of him.

822
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,676
I always liked your pop.

823
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,011
Your mom, too.

824
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:31,915
Very special woman, your mom.

825
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:35,351
I think about her sometimes.

826
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,756
When I was young, I remember thinking

827
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:42,892
I was gonna grow old with these people.

828
01:17:42,926 --> 01:17:44,694
Jesus.

829
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:46,329
Now, here I am, about to retire,

830
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:51,267
and I feel like...
Like it's a different life.

831
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:57,440
It's tragic what happened that day.

832
01:17:57,473 --> 01:17:59,342
I couldn't believe when
I came around that bend

833
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:02,678
and saw him at the bottom
of that ravine.

834
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:09,318
I scrambled down the cliff
as fast as I could.

835
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:11,755
I thought you heard him fall.

836
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:13,890
His yell, that's what
it said in the paper,

837
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:15,158
that's what Dottie told me.

838
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,063
Good memory.

839
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:24,333
I guess you're right.

840
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:28,471
It's been a long time since
I thought about that day.

841
01:18:28,504 --> 01:18:31,240
All I'm trying to say is, you were...

842
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:35,845
You were just lucky to
have really good parents.

843
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:37,679
Yeah, well, I just wish
I'd gotten to know him

844
01:18:37,703 --> 01:18:39,172
as well as you had.

845
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:54,230
What are you waiting for?

846
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:10,746
Geez, where is she with that firewood?

847
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:18,321
You know, I also brought some of this.

848
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:22,892
Who doesn't love those
little marshmallows?

849
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:27,330
<i>Levi!</i>

850
01:19:38,341 --> 01:19:40,076
It's Will Beeman!

851
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:47,483
Come on.

852
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,066
It's all here!

853
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:09,572
You come alone?

854
01:20:14,577 --> 01:20:16,012
Yeah.

855
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:21,184
You got the money?

856
01:20:21,217 --> 01:20:24,988
I got your money, you got my son?

857
01:20:27,123 --> 01:20:29,825
- Should we let him in?
- Yeah!

858
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,510
I'm coming in.

859
01:20:55,451 --> 01:20:58,221
- That full?
- It's all here.

860
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:17,173
I'm sorry.

861
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:20,944
I'm so sorry, kiddo.

862
01:21:23,246 --> 01:21:25,514
Are you okay?
He didn't hurt you, did he?

863
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:26,983
No, no, no.

864
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:31,254
He's not the real robber, Dad.

865
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:35,658
- Well, he is, but...
- I know.

866
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,170
You got the money?

867
01:21:49,072 --> 01:21:50,439
Possibly.

868
01:21:51,307 --> 01:21:55,044
Are we good? Can we go?

869
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:09,558
Levi.

870
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,965
Any chance I can get my rifle back?

871
01:22:15,999 --> 01:22:17,933
Kinda special to me.

872
01:22:42,558 --> 01:22:44,393
Come on, let's go.

873
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:09,152
- Good luck, Danny.
- Good luck, Levi.

874
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,526
Who is that?

875
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,727
- Who is that?
- I tried.

876
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,596
- Okay, you tried?
- I tried to come alone...

877
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:22,298
- Who is that?
- It's Howell.

878
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:24,533
- You brought Howell?
- Look, I tried, all right?

879
01:23:24,567 --> 01:23:25,907
He's behind the robbery.

880
01:23:25,909 --> 01:23:27,389
Hey, Danny, you just stay back there.

881
01:23:27,421 --> 01:23:29,156
The mastermind of
the whole goddamn thing.

882
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:33,276
- What?
- I told you not to bring any cops!

883
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,280
God damn you, city boy.

884
01:23:42,585 --> 01:23:45,688
Come on out, now!

885
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:49,758
There's some bad news
about your girlfriend!

886
01:23:53,329 --> 01:23:54,797
She's dead!

887
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:02,105
Hey! You hear me?

888
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:07,376
Come on! It's all over!

889
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:10,579
Don't do it, man.

890
01:24:20,323 --> 01:24:22,658
Come on, let's go.

891
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,604
Hey, hey look at me.

892
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:38,307
Danny, Danny, look at me.

893
01:24:38,341 --> 01:24:39,675
It's okay, all right?

894
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:43,679
Hey, we got this, all right?
Come on.

895
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,823
<i>Give me my fuckin' money!</i>

896
01:24:54,857 --> 01:24:56,792
Come on, let's go!

897
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:58,727
Let's go!

898
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,329
Let's go!

899
01:25:04,167 --> 01:25:06,235
All right, let's go.

900
01:25:25,321 --> 01:25:26,822
Come on, Dad!

901
01:25:28,757 --> 01:25:31,294
Aw, fuck.

902
01:25:31,327 --> 01:25:33,162
On the ground, bitch.

903
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:37,833
Ah, shit.

904
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:40,436
No one can find Richie anywhere.

905
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,805
Laura knew that Will
was at the post office,

906
01:25:42,838 --> 01:25:45,408
which means Richie
probably knows now, too.

907
01:25:45,441 --> 01:25:46,809
So is that where we should go?

908
01:25:46,842 --> 01:25:50,513
No, look, look.
One mile due north of the mill run

909
01:25:50,546 --> 01:25:54,517
and Grugen Hollow intersection,
we go here.

910
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,718
Okay.

911
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:06,295
How's that?

912
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,818
Come on, Tom, we ain't got all day!

913
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,454
Move it!

914
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:37,926
All right, here it is, come on.

915
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:43,332
All right, I need you climb up
there and wait for me, okay?

916
01:26:43,366 --> 01:26:43,933
Yeah.

917
01:26:43,935 --> 01:26:45,695
You're gonna get your
body flat on the floor,

918
01:26:45,728 --> 01:26:47,968
and don't make a sound or move
a muscle until I get back.

919
01:26:47,992 --> 01:26:49,838
- You got it?
- Got it.

920
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:53,276
- All right, I love you, kiddo.
- Love you, too.

921
01:26:53,309 --> 01:26:54,710
Go do it.

922
01:27:15,598 --> 01:27:18,501
Come on, let's go, now!

923
01:27:28,777 --> 01:27:31,013
All right, now lay down.

924
01:27:31,046 --> 01:27:32,681
Okay.

925
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,421
Richie, get that kid!

926
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:40,556
- Okay!
- No!

927
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:44,593
No! No, no!

928
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,989
Room for two up there?

929
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:39,748
- You let her go!
- That's my money!

930
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:41,650
I'm not letting her go!

931
01:28:41,684 --> 01:28:43,852
This is over, Howell!

932
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:45,921
What are you some kind of hero, now?

933
01:28:45,954 --> 01:28:50,092
I got news for you, Billy.
It doesn't work that way!

934
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:54,597
See, I know about heroes,
I protect this entire community.

935
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,565
You fucking steal from it.

936
01:28:56,599 --> 01:28:58,734
It's federally insured, you idiot.

937
01:28:58,767 --> 01:29:01,103
The bank will give you
back every last cent.

938
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:03,406
What's a lousy two million
for all I've done

939
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:05,107
for the people of Granville?

940
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:08,644
Now throw that fuckin' bag over here?

941
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:13,949
Uh-uh. No more.

942
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:30,733
I'm gonna count to three.

943
01:29:30,766 --> 01:29:32,000
You need to let her go.

944
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:34,503
You can count to three?

945
01:29:34,537 --> 01:29:37,773
Who the fuck do you think you are?

946
01:29:39,808 --> 01:29:42,945
Now get the fuck out of here before
I put one in your fuckin' head.

947
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:44,513
One.

948
01:29:44,547 --> 01:29:46,782
I gave my life to this town,

949
01:29:46,815 --> 01:29:48,784
and what thanks do I get?

950
01:29:48,817 --> 01:29:50,653
Two.

951
01:29:50,686 --> 01:29:52,955
I'm gonna put two in her
fuckin' head, right now.

952
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:54,823
Let's see if you got the precision

953
01:29:54,857 --> 01:29:56,992
to splatter my brains and not hers.

954
01:30:00,996 --> 01:30:03,165
Go ahead, you're a killer now, right?

955
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:05,801
Since you shot Charlie yesterday?

956
01:30:05,834 --> 01:30:08,871
You got all that juice
flowing through you?

957
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:12,040
I remember how that felt,
the first time.

958
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:16,044
Right after I pushed
your dad off that cliff.

959
01:30:27,956 --> 01:30:29,658
Three.

960
01:30:31,894 --> 01:30:34,129
Put the gun down!

961
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:36,932
Danny! Danny, no!

962
01:30:39,868 --> 01:30:43,005
Oh my God, isn't this precious?

963
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:45,941
- <i>Danny!</i>
- I got the shot, Dad.

964
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:49,678
No!

965
01:30:49,712 --> 01:30:52,548
You know what they say about
women and children first.

966
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:55,050
Danny, no, no!

967
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:58,220
I can do it!

968
01:30:58,253 --> 01:30:59,855
Put the gun down, son.

969
01:30:59,888 --> 01:31:03,492
Danny, Danny!

970
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:36,191
Levi!

971
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:47,169
Levi, come on!

972
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:50,706
Danny, Danny!

973
01:32:06,822 --> 01:32:08,957
- Mom!
- Danny!

974
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:17,566
Are you okay?

975
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:19,835
I'm okay.

976
01:32:23,338 --> 01:32:24,840
Oh!

977
01:32:28,076 --> 01:32:29,812
My goodness.

978
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:36,278
It's pretty exciting, we were able
to recover all the money for the bank...

979
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:57,265
Why don't you add this
to your collection?

980
01:33:57,299 --> 01:34:00,202
Think it belongs here anyways.

981
01:34:00,235 --> 01:34:03,305
Besides, Danny doesn't need
to shoot anything

982
01:34:03,338 --> 01:34:05,007
to prove how tough he is.

983
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,976
He's already more of a man than most.

984
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:43,078
- You good, kiddo?
- I'm good, Dad.

985
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:48,817
That's my boy.
