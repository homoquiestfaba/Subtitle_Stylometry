1
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,022
Sylvia...

2
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,456
Sylvia...

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:39,264
Sylvia

4
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,830
Smile for me

5
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:47,245
Fill my world
with poetry

6
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:53,344
Forget those
faraway dreams

7
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:58,722
That haunt you

8
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,024
Sylvia

9
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,328
Young in years

10
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,529
Let the sunshine

11
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,335
Dry your tears

12
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:18,276
And we
will walk in the wind

13
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,714
And stars

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:28,710
Like April lovers

15
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:35,183
With hearts aglow...

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,465
Come on back
to bed, Sylvia.

17
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,165
Can't you see
l'm cooking scrapple?

18
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,767
lt can wait.
Sex is in the air.

19
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,745
Not in here it isn't.
l got work, Vaughn.

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,771
Your mother
is up the store.

21
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:59,080
lt's light out, for Christ's sake.
What's gotten into you?

22
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,020
Come on, move!

23
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,153
...Forget those
faraway dreams

24
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:13,928
That haunt you...

25
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,203
God!

26
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,642
...Let the sunshine

27
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,804
Dry your tears

28
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:34,287
And we will walk
in the wind...

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,312
Damn it!

30
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,221
Jesus Christ.
Oh-hh!

31
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,396
...With hearts aglow

32
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,404
Till love discloses

33
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:57,307
Where the secret
roses grow...

34
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,311
You seen my keys?

35
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,745
Ow!

36
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,412
l said, have you seen
my keys?

37
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,421
Where did you
leave them?

38
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,652
lf l knew where l'd left them, they
wouldn't be lost, would they?

39
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,490
Vaughnhole!

40
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,595
Oh, Jesus Christ Almighty!

41
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,297
lt's not my fault.

42
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,398
Somebody left his magazine on the front
porch and it got me all riled up.

43
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,535
Oh, sure,
''somebody left it.''

44
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,273
sure, sure...

45
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,780
You said
you didn't want to.

46
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,783
l mean a man has needs, Sylvia.
Marital needs.

47
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,309
My gal is red hot, yeah!

48
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,684
My gal is red hot

49
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,691
Your gal ain't
doodly squat

50
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,693
Well, she ain't got
no money, but man

51
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,958
She's really
got a lot

52
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,091
Well, l got a gal,
six feet four...

53
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,795
Ooh.

54
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,804
...My gal is red hot

55
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,430
Your gal
ain't doodly squat

56
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:04,068
Yeah, my gal
is red hot

57
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,907
Your gal
ain't doodly squat

58
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,175
Well, she ain't got
no money, but, man...

59
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,479
lsn't it a little early
for that, Caprice?

60
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,042
l'm developing
my act, Mother.

61
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,454
Mutilating your mammaries
and gyrating down at some biker bar

62
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,186
is an act, all right,
an act of defiance.

63
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,389
l was a legend down at the Holiday
House, in case you didn't know it.

64
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,333
Morning, honey.

65
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,700
Daddy, let me go down to the bar
and perform.

66
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,602
You're in home detention,
cupcake.

67
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,335
The ''government'' wants you to stay
indoors for a while, huh?

68
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,206
You're just too pretty
to go out.

69
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:41,680
We let you keep your tawdry theatrical
mementoes. lsn't that enough?

70
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:46,014
You were convicted
of indecent exposure for the third time.

71
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,179
l was promoting
the art of dance.

72
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,052
With nude loitering?!

73
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,082
Nude and disorderly conduct?
Nude drunken driving?

74
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,325
l was not drunk.
l was on pills.

75
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,094
Something is the matter
with you, Caprice.

76
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,160
You are such a Neuter,
Mother.

77
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,364
And Neuters will never
understand.

78
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,136
Something is the matter
with your vagina.

79
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,443
Hulh

80
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:17,938
Morning,
Mrs. Stickles.

81
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,077
Oh, you brat!
l'm gonna report you.

82
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,784
Morning.
Formstone's looking good.

83
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,089
Ah, it's the real McCoy
all right, vintage.

84
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,822
- Paid through the nose for it.
- Oh.

85
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,093
One thing we've learned-- proper
restoration never comes cheaply.

86
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,533
l need to go down to
the bar-- just for an hour!

87
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,800
Come on, Dad, don't lock it.
Daddy, let me go!

88
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,740
My public needs me!

89
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,902
- Ooh!
- Mrs. Stickles,

90
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,276
my name is Fat Fuck Frank.

91
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,077
And l'm your daughter's
number one fan.

92
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,744
She moved to
the Erie Canal area.

93
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,548
Hey, Vaughn.

94
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,578
Hey!

95
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,590
Caprice retired
from show business.

96
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,387
She's no longer
a public figure.

97
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:04,055
Her name ain't Caprice,
it's ''Ursula Udders.'' And she's famous.

98
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,395
She got the biggest tits
on Harford Road.

99
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,833
Ursula! Ursula Udders!

100
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,929
Texture, that's
what l call it.

101
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,667
lt's me,
Fat Fuck Frank.

102
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,141
And l miss
them great big--

103
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,607
Destroy all Neuters!

104
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,172
We sure didn't
have this in D.C.

105
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,846
God, l love Baltimore.
lt's a real city of diversity.

106
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:32,119
Sylvia! Sylvia,
we need gas, honey!

107
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,150
Get gas.

108
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,662
Honey,
still mad?

109
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,827
Remember to fill it up.
l'll walk, don't worry.

110
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,239
Hmm?

111
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,675
Ugh!

112
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,416
Smokey the bear,
Smokey the bear

113
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,050
- Prowling and a-growling...
- Grr!

114
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,026
Hi! Grrr-rr! Woof!

115
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,587
- Grrr!
- Woof! Woof!

116
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,998
That's why they called him Smokey,
that is how he got his name...

117
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,966
- Hi, Vaughn.
- Morning, Betty.

118
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,909
Does the Pinewood
Park-and-Pay sell lotions?

119
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,572
You know--
ointments?

120
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,581
We sure do.

121
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,876
How is that fine wife
of yours doing?

122
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,822
She's up at the store
like always, Wendell.

123
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,121
Don't you
find it funny

124
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:45,222
that every man
in this neighborhood has a penis?

125
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,993
Well, not really,
Betty.

126
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,377
Sheeze...!

127
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,178
Uglh!

128
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,389
Oh, don't.

129
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,423
Jesus, Mary,
and Joseph!

130
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,094
Olh!

131
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,261
...Whoa, whoa-whoa

132
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,603
l need your loving--
oh, that's it, babe.

133
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,075
That's it, oh-oh-oh.

134
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,135
Oh, God!

135
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,644
Ooh, that's it, baby.

136
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,141
Oh, talk to the mike,
talk to the mike. Ooh-ooh.

137
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,218
Oh, that's what
l call a hum job. Oh, yeah.

138
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,627
Come on.

139
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,398
Oh, okay.

140
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,837
l'm out of gas.

141
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,568
Move it, Neuter!

142
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,941
- Oh, God!
- How am l supposed to move with no gas?

143
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,174
Get out of the way!
We're in a hurry.

144
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

145
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,824
- Filthy little hedges.
- Morning, Marge.

146
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,762
Growin' all dirty,
makes me sick.

147
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,971
Hi, l'm ''Mama Bear.''

148
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,066
have you met
my hus-bear?

149
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,633
No, l haven't.

150
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,646
l'm ''Papa Bear.''

151
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,116
And this is our cub,
''Baby Bear.''

152
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,549
Grrr!

153
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,351
l'm Vaughn. Welcome
to the Harford Road area.

154
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,856
When we take over,
it's gonna be a--

155
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,382
''Bearquake!''

156
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,456
...Happy, happy, happy

157
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,659
With a big bear hug.

158
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,100
- Come on.
- Move that piece of shit.

159
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,659
Can you call
Triple-A, please?

160
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,007
Hurry up,
l've got a hot date.

161
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,012
What, at 7:00 a.m.?
What's the matter with you?

162
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,480
You'd have a date too
if you wore some make-up.

163
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,881
- Your poor husband.
- Huh?

164
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,421
Ooh-hh!

165
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,019
lf you could just
help me, l'd--

166
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,359
Ooh!

167
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,135
lt's her!

168
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,436
Let's go sexing.

169
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,711
Sylvia...

170
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,066
Olh!

171
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,576
Ooh!

172
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,944
Hello, ma'am.

173
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,443
My name is Ray Ray
and l'm here to-- service you.

174
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,420
l'm Sylvia,
and l hit my head. Oh.

175
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:42,029
A concussion
is a terrible thing

176
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,730
to waste.
lt's okay.

177
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,136
Ooh!

178
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,607
My pussy's on fire.

179
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,270
l know it is.
lt's a burning bush.

180
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,643
Show me a sign, Sylvia.

181
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,614
We knew you'd come.

182
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,584
All l can do
is pass the gift.

183
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,142
Huh?

184
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,351
You're a sex addict now
and you'll never be the same.

185
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,593
Ooh-aah--!

186
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,712
There you go.

187
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,809
All better?

188
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,310
Oh, thank you so much.

189
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,846
l don't know
what came over me.

190
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:42,383
Well, you recognized the concussion
and there's no going back now.

191
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,790
l'm gonna give you
my card.

192
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,132
Sex addicts
are everywhere, Sylvia,

193
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,695
and pretty soon,
Harford Road will be ours.

194
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,899
Oh, hey, hold on.

195
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,893
Ray Ray
is a sexual healer.

196
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,925
Come visit us,
Sylvia.

197
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,962
Your people
are waiting.

198
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,201
Olh

199
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:33,007
One day we're going
to discover a brand new sex act,

200
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,206
one that's never
been performed before.

201
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:39,115
And we hope you'll be
with us on that day of carnal rapture.

202
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,725
Ooo

203
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,034
Alh

204
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,218
Pussy, ooh...

205
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,925
Sore, wet, ooh...

206
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,998
My pussycat was scratching out
on my back door...

207
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,169
...Scratched so long
poor pussy got sore

208
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,307
Sore pussy, ooh...

209
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,343
Sore... pussy... ooh

210
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,049
Just a friendly
little cat

211
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,149
Friendly little cat

212
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:57,458
My pussycat
was sitting out on the front step

213
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,830
Sat so long poor pussy got wet,
sore pussy.

214
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,766
Hello, Mrs. Stickles.

215
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,274
Oh boy, am l blushing?

216
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,437
Everyone is familiar with
the traditional forms of pornography.

217
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,276
But the lnternet
is creating new forms--

218
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,976
- You going to the movies, Dave?
- Huh?

219
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,985
Hell, you're picking
your seat, aren't you?

220
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,289
Dykes!

221
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,089
Used to be Harford Road
was for families.

222
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,119
Now it's
a lesbian aorta.

223
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,826
Mother,
l don't feel well.

224
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,801
Well, no wonder,

225
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,827
they've got blatant homosexuals
shopping right in our store.

226
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,204
They eat life,
you know.

227
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,835
- Jesus!
- Sperm!

228
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,353
Did you see those
new neighbors moving in?

229
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,982
Hmm? Grown men with
hairy legs prancing around half naked--

230
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,721
''We're bears.'' what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

231
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,729
Free country,
Big Ethel.

232
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,630
Yeah well, we got laws
to protect decency.

233
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,634
And it would
be nice

234
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,136
if somebody enforced them.
19, 20.

235
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,298
Well, as my mother
used to say--

236
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,832
'''Each to their own,' said the old lady
as she kissed the cow.''

237
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,352
Perverts are taking over
this neighborhood.

238
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,285
Ugh! Mr. Mailman,
as of next week,

239
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,261
we're not carrying
the girlie magazines no more.

240
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,264
That's a shame.

241
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:43,166
Makes me sick to see government
employees looking at that filth, Marge.

242
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,831
And on taxpayers' time yet.
That's why the mail's late.

243
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,932
Yeah, and the post office has the nerve
to raise the price of a stamp.

244
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,910
While mailmen are
beating off everywhere.

245
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:57,541
l found a used condom
in my back yard.

246
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,414
You think that's bad?

247
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,248
Somebody wrote
the word ''boner''

248
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,049
on our parking lot wall
last night.

249
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,454
We've got to do something,
Marge.

250
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,821
People have got to know
how bad things are getting.

251
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,889
No wonder l've got
to take heart pills.

252
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,422
l read in the paper
the other day

253
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,834
that the average married couple has sex
over 100 times a year.

254
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,602
That's a lie.
People would be raw if that was true.

255
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,270
l'll be at your meeting all right,
with bells on.

256
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,905
You have, uh, AAA batteries?

257
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,040
l certainly do.

258
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,413
You sure these
are the right ones?

259
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,618
You want me
to take them out?

260
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,092
No, no, l guess l'll buy them.

261
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,062
Well, get down there,
mutha, and start scarfing.

262
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,190
What the hell?

263
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:51,794
l mean, Jesus...
for Christ's sake! l'm moving to Towson.

264
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,328
Harford Road--
where life is cheap.

265
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,536
- Only you can prevent fornication.
- Yeah, yeah.

266
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,409
You see, Marge?
People in the neighborhood have had it.

267
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,209
lt wasn't this bad
in the '60s.

268
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,737
You're right.

269
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:07,411
Someone left a dildo
in my neighbor's wishing well,

270
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,751
right on her
front lawn.

271
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,983
People are just ignorant
everywhere.

272
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,318
Morning, Big Ethel.

273
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,624
Uh, what's good about a morning
with dildos in it?

274
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:22,157
Amen to that.
My husband's on Viagra.

275
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,863
- Oh, you poor thing!
- Every minute, he wants it.

276
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,871
He has no right
to be that hard.

277
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,999
l'm Viagra-vated
and l'm not gonna take it anymore.

278
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,755
Sylvia!

279
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,757
Feeling better,
huh?

280
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,364
Mail here
for Ursula Udders.

281
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,730
Her name is Caprice
and she's got shingles.

282
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,259
Our daughter doesn't really participate
in the mail these days.

283
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,831
l'll take the fan mail to her, Warren.
Don't you worry.

284
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,003
You should be ashamed of yourself,
Mr. Mailman.

285
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,035
Ashamed of what,
Big Ethel?

286
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,314
- Damn, l could deliver that one.
- Oh, keep it up.

287
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,222
l'm gonna call the Postmaster general--
lf he's not whacking off--

288
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,317
and report
your potty mouth.

289
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,659
Sex addicts
are everywhere, Sylvia.

290
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,687
You wanna
have funch?

291
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,700
What's ''funch,''
honey?

292
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,170
Fucking
after lunch.

293
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,037
Funch, huh?

294
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,372
Come on.
This must be my lucky day.

295
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,311
- Hmm, spaghetti...
- Yeah, she'll ring it up for you.

296
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,576
Where do you two
think you're going?

297
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,583
lt's not safe out.

298
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,847
People are shaving
their crotches as we speak.

299
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,514
There's pubic hair
in the air everywhere.

300
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,217
We're having
a decency rally,

301
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,623
and l think you two
need to be there.

302
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,957
Yeah.

303
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,940
l've got hot nuts

304
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,773
10 cents a bag...

305
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,678
- What kind of station is that?
- A good one.

306
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,308
...l've got hot nuts...

307
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,682
- Feeling frisky, eh?
- Uh-huh.

308
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,244
Let's open one of Caprice's
fan letters.

309
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,256
That's her
personal mail.

310
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,225
Oh, look...

311
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,822
it's from the mailman. He sent Caprice
a photo of his penis. Ooh!

312
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,832
He what?

313
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,801
Are you kidding me?
Give me the picture.

314
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,738
Give me the picture. Give me the pic--
l'm not kidding around.

315
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,105
This is disgusting.

316
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,837
Well, he's got
a big one.

317
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,845
What kind of talk
is that?

318
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,074
Oh, they're all photos
of the mailman's unit.

319
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,106
l'm calling
the cops.

320
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,983
Yes, sir,
a real arse-opener!

321
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,351
Stop it, Sylvia.

322
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,414
Pink steel!

323
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,755
What's the matter
with you?

324
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,091
Hey, Vaughn,
feel like ''yodeling in the canyon''?

325
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,632
We have to visit
my mother, remember?

326
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,396
Oh, come on,
you wanted to earlier.

327
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,426
Well, not that,
l didn't.

328
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,929
Come on, Vaughn,
discover the oyster.

329
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,465
Honey, this is Pinewood Avenue.
We live here.

330
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,478
Can't we wait
till we get back to the house?

331
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,571
Oh, go ''way down
South in Dixie.''

332
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,014
All right, all right,
just keep a look out.

333
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,541
Okay.

334
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,653
Oh-hh!

335
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,989
No--!

336
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,052
Oh!

337
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,690
Now that's what l call
''sneezing in the cabbage.''

338
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,424
Olh!

339
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,506
Harford Road,
let's all band together.

340
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,341
Horndogs are everywhere.
Pretty soon they'll be living next door.

341
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:57,838
Decency, that's all
l'm asking for. Decency!

342
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,820
Decency's fine.

343
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,520
But diversity in a neighborhood
is a good thing too.

344
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,792
This isn't diversity,
it's depravity.

345
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,425
On my way over here,
l saw a man

346
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,731
performing oral sex
on a lady

347
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,499
in a car
in broad daylight.

348
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,964
Lesbians have taken over
the softball fields.

349
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,671
So? Lesbians are
good neighbors.

350
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,340
We need to start by teaching tolerance
in our own homes.

351
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,942
Some guy was playing with himself
near me in the movies.

352
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,420
You're saying that's normal?
His crotch was shaved!

353
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,387
These are isolated
incidents.

354
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,393
No, they're not.

355
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,294
Look, l'm not a prude.
l'm married to an ltalian.

356
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,628
But l am disgusted.

357
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,328
l live near what they call
''The Bear House.''

358
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,564
Last night,

359
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,903
hairy, overweight men
who call themselves bears

360
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,569
were having sex
outside the house.

361
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,510
My children heard them.

362
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,673
''Mommy, what's that noise?''
They actually asked me.

363
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,115
l raced outside
clapping my hands loudly

364
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,245
and l yelled--
''No blow jobs!''

365
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,255
And they just laughed.

366
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:14,918
Some of them
even growled at me.

367
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,258
Oh, no!

368
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,354
Today, somebody
called me a Neuter.

369
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,662
And you know what?
l didn't mind.

370
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,260
lf neuter means ''normal,''
l'll say it loud--

371
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,964
l am Marge, the Neuter,
and l'm proud.

372
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,700
That's right!

373
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,276
We're all Neuters!

374
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,874
And we'll never,
never be not normal!

375
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,421
You put your left foot in,
you put your left foot out

376
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,188
You put your left foot in

377
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,819
And you shake it
all about

378
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:54,320
You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around

379
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,597
- That's what it's all about
- Right arm!

380
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,231
You put your right arm in,
you put your right arm out

381
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,902
You put your right arm in
and then you shake it all about...

382
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,479
Left arm!

383
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:16,544
You put your left arm in,
you put your left arm out

384
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:20,718
You put your left arm in
and then you shake it all about

385
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,819
You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around

386
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,762
That's what
it's all about

387
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,628
Right elbow!

388
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,602
You put your right elbow in,
you put your right elbow out

389
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:35,163
You put your right elbow in
and you shake it all about

390
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,471
You do
the Hokey-Pokey...

391
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,670
Hi!

392
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,874
- That's what it's all about...
- Hey, Mom.

393
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,441
You put your left elbow in,
you put your left elbow out...

394
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,444
- Come on, let's dance.
- And then you shake it all about...

395
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,185
Head!

396
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,791
You put your head in,
you put your head out

397
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,530
You put your head in
and you shake it all about

398
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,666
You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around

399
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,006
That's what
it's all about

400
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,772
Right hip!

401
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,838
You put your right hip in,
you put your right hip out

402
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:20,409
You put your right hip in
and you shake it all about

403
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:24,946
You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around

404
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,890
That's what
it's all about

405
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,483
Left hip!

406
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,054
You put your left hip in,
you put your left hip out

407
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:35,931
You put your left hip in
and you shake it all about...

408
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,101
Whole self!

409
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,373
You put your whole self in,
you put your whole self out

410
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:51,075
You put your whole self in
and you shake it all about

411
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,677
You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around

412
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,381
That's what it's
all about

413
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,014
Backside!

414
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,390
You put your backside in,
you put your backside out

415
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,761
You put your backside in
and you shake it all about

416
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,665
You do the Hokey-Pokey
and you turn yourself around...

417
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,067
Ooh!

418
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,140
You do the Hokey-Pokey

419
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,376
You do the Hokey-Pokey...

420
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,681
That's what it's all about.

421
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,621
Sylvia!

422
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,898
Oh!

423
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,944
Oh! Oh!

424
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,495
Taxi! Taxi!

425
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,779
Ray Ray's service center,
6630 Harford Road.

426
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,076
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,115
Uhh.

428
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,224
Hey, lady, you can't
change your clothes in here.

429
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,059
- Why not?
- 'Cause l said so.

430
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,496
Want some fun?

431
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,526
What are you doing?

432
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,034
- Can l get up front?
- No, you can't.

433
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:42,604
- You can leave the meter running.
- Stay in the back.

434
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:46,606
- Oh, come on, l want some action.
- Get off me, lady.

435
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,984
Hey-- you can't do
that stuff in here.

436
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,990
- Get out!
- This cab free?

437
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,117
Sure is, tiger.

438
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,789
Hey, hey, hey!
Jeez!

439
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,425
Go! What the hell
was that?

440
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,667
Oh.

441
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,768
- Mommy told me something...
- Traitor!

442
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,779
That's right,
spread the word.

443
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,543
You bet, Big Ethel.

444
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,745
Here, put the pink ones
on the cars.

445
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,582
Put the yellows
on the houses.

446
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,248
Put that
on the windshield.

447
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,054
And don't stop till you get to the end
of the block.

448
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:35,591
He will never
ever leave you if your heart...

449
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,659
- Who is it?
- lt's Big Ethel.

450
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,369
We're having
a decency rally--

451
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,568
You better start
in your own backyard then.

452
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,203
l heard your daughter Sylvia
picked up a bottle

453
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,440
with her cooter
in the old folks' home.

454
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,415
She what?
That's not true.

455
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,317
My daughter is a good girl.
She hates sex.

456
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,450
What is she talking about,
that bitch?

457
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,815
Hello?

458
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,348
Ray Ray?

459
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,728
lt's me, Sylvia.
And l need full service.

460
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,324
l knew you'd find us,
Sylvia.

461
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:49,103
Don't be afraid. We've all had
accidental concussions just like you.

462
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,700
- You have?
- Yeah.

463
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,644
Mine was from the faulty hood
of a customer's car

464
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,512
that collapsed on my head
while l was changing the oil.

465
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,355
And now l guide other
head-injury sufferers

466
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,086
to the final dawn
of sexual awakening.

467
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,459
- You've been sent to help us.
- l have?

468
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:15,296
We're all sex addicts
and we have been waiting for you.

469
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,995
- But why?
- Because you can lead us

470
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:22,632
to an erotic orgasm
we've never experienced.

471
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,505
l can't.
l promise you l can't.

472
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,305
l'm Loose Linda.

473
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:30,474
l fucked the entire
Harford Road Police Department.

474
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,506
lt's nice to meet you,
Loose Linda.

475
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,587
Until you've hit your head,

476
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,784
you can never really feel
the power you get from sex.

477
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,384
My name is Paw Paw.
l'm on ''bush patrol.''

478
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,395
l hope we can
have sex one day.

479
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,863
l'd like that, Sylvia.

480
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,563
l knew you'd come.
You're number 12.

481
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,232
- Number 12 what?
- All in good time.

482
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,150
Dave, is that you?

483
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,347
We call him Dingy Dave
and he's number three.

484
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,686
Don't worry, Mrs. Stickles,
you'll understand soon.

485
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,852
Dingy Dave is lucky.
He's into mysophilia.

486
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,385
lt's a sexual attraction to dirt.
He thought it was new.

487
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,398
But it wasn't.

488
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,765
Dirt worship's been around long
before my accident.

489
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,532
l just didn't know.

490
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,665
Ray Ray

491
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:33,336
has helped me understand
my hypersexuality.

492
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:37,075
And he cured me
of my herpes.

493
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,345
Like a miracle.

494
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,352
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no.

495
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,786
We don't say the ''m'' word
around here.

496
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,757
- Oh.
- Mrs. Stickles?

497
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,784
May l, uh, be
your vacuum cleaner?

498
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:54,594
Well, l'm new to this,
but l'll try.

499
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,965
Oh!

500
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,805
Oh!

501
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,610
lt's like Noah's ark
around here.

502
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,411
There is one
of every perversion.

503
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,716
But, alas, it's all
been done.

504
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,847
Brace yourself, Sylvia.

505
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,188
Got company!

506
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,159
Officer Alvin!

507
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,929
l'm an adult baby, Sylvia.
You want to be my mommy?

508
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,025
Adult babies are into
age regression.

509
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,765
They intensely eroticize
being infants.

510
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,103
And sometimes they like
to be burped.

511
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,906
l'm a big boy and
l'm beyond the law.

512
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,947
Bouncy, bouncy,
bouncy...

513
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,006
As you grow to embrace
your concussion,

514
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,018
you'll learn to accept
anything sexual

515
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,816
as long as it's safe,
consensual and doesn't harm others.

516
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,585
You wanna powder
my chafed butt?

517
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,285
Uh, l would,

518
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,659
but l'm supposed
to help Ray Ray think up a new sex act.

519
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,323
Maybe later.

520
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,026
Da-da...

521
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,362
Number five,
six and seven.

522
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,804
You may know us
as neighbors, Sylvia,

523
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,741
but in this world,
we're into human sandwiches.

524
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,641
One day, we hope
you'll be our ''lettuce.''

525
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,111
- You know about my Priority Penis.
- Oof! Ow!

526
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,121
l never thought
it would be you.

527
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,783
Come on and meet
the ''Three Bears.''

528
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,752
We're husky, we're hairy,
we're homosexual

529
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,789
and out of
the second closet.

530
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,802
And we can cuddle
all night.

531
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,431
Yeah, hunting for some grizz-sm...

532
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,179
Ever hear
of sploshing?

533
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,877
l only had my concussion
this morning.

534
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,977
lt's okay.
lt's an English fetish.

535
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,147
Sploshing is
the erotic urge

536
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,248
to dump food
in your private area.

537
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,659
Oh-ooh!

538
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,891
l'm Messy Melinda

539
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,059
and our bushes
will burn together.

540
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:14,037
And of course you know
of Fat Fuck Frank.

541
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,631
Mrs. Stickles, go home
and free your daughter.

542
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,870
She's one of us
and needs to be here now.

543
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:31,053
l'm number 11.

544
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,454
Number 11?

545
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:46,164
Oh, my God!
l'm the 12th apostle?

546
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,728
- Yes, shh.
- Say it proud.

547
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,400
lf you say it out loud,
you might disappear.

548
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,306
No, no, no, l'm just
Sylvia Stickles.

549
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,971
l'm a horny woman
with a head injury. l can--

550
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:58,573
l know you are and we're
gonna do something about that.

551
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,515
Ray Ray
is a sex saint,

552
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,114
- and he's got powers.
- Amen to that.

553
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,491
l've got a hard-on
of gold,

554
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,936
and my tongue
is on fire.

555
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,673
Oh, and l've got
hot pants, Ray Ray.

556
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,542
We're all in heat.

557
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,445
And as you know, Sylvia
is a cunnilingus bottom.

558
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,573
Yes, she is.

559
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,481
Who wants
to eat her out?

560
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,755
Let's go sexing!

561
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,121
Yeah!

562
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,296
Jesus Christ,
how many houses do l gotta go to?

563
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,026
Who is it?

564
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,591
lt's Big Ethel
from up the Park-and-Pay.

565
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,604
We're having
a decency rally tomorrow.

566
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,163
We want all Neuters
to be there.

567
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,376
What's a Neuter?

568
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,277
lt's a normal person who
is fed up with perversion.

569
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,439
Sign me up then.

570
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,541
Tonight a woman in my cab
tried to grab my nutsack.

571
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,109
Oh, it's a sick world!

572
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,049
l don't know how it started
l don't know what l did

573
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,251
l don't know how it started
i don't know what l did

574
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,456
But there's a gal who's chasing me
who really flipped her lid

575
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,260
- Hey!
- l call her my eager beaver baby

576
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,824
Ooh, eager beaver
baby...

577
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,063
- Was that Sylvia Stickles?
- l think it was.

578
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,730
What happened
to her?

579
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:31,640
l don't know, but
it's a dirty shame.

580
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,111
...Well what am l
gonna do

581
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:41,881
With that eager beaver
baby of mine?

582
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,085
Hello, Vaughn.

583
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,255
Hello, Betty.
Have you seen my wife?

584
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,194
Come on in.

585
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:56,188
No, l can't.
Sylvia seems to be missing.

586
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,394
l was with her
earlier, but--

587
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,836
Maybe she's
getting lucky.

588
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:04,238
Harford Road
is wild these days.

589
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:20,889
Hey, hey, come on,
open.

590
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:10,001
l seen you,
Sylvia Stickles,

591
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,373
showing your pubic patch
to the bus driver.

592
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,312
You should move downtown
where you belong, you whore.

593
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,017
End of the line.

594
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,632
Okay, buster,
turn off the motor.

595
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:40,068
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you!

596
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,406
Yes, Ma'am!

597
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,412
Don't touch that spot
that itchy-twitchy spot

598
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,509
That spot that's swelling up
and turning red...

599
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,316
- Grrr...
- What are you doing in there?

600
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,787
Vaughn, where is
my daughter?

601
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,757
l don't know, Big Ethel.
l can't find her.

602
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,453
Oh, don't go in there.
Bears live here.

603
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,622
Big fat hairy fags
with dicks.

604
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,561
Hi, l'm Cow Patty.

605
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,162
l'm Vaughn.
l live up the street

606
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,695
and l'm looking
for my wife Sylvia.

607
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,675
l'm the only ''Goldilocks'' allowed
in this bear cave.

608
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,304
l'm a bear hag.
And we call this--

609
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,814
Bear soup!

610
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,816
Wow, a tranny bear.

611
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,348
Come on in.

612
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,656
Police!

613
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,620
My gal is red hot

614
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,632
Your gal
ain't doodly squat

615
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,294
Yeah,
my gal is red hot

616
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,997
- Your gal ain't doodly squat...
- Go, baby, go!

617
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,471
Shake that thing!

618
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,701
...she's really
got a lot...

619
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,609
Mother!
What's the matter?

620
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,636
...Six feet four...

621
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,444
Nothing, honey.
l just wanted to have

622
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,280
a little
mother-daughter chat.

623
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,116
l'm so sorry
l spoke so harshly

624
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,179
about your vagina
this morning.

625
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,954
lt's all right.
Where did you get that outfit, Mother?

626
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:46,724
Oh, you like it?
lt's my new apostle look.

627
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,631
Oh, you've got fan mail.

628
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,533
The mailman's
got a big johnson, doesn't he?

629
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,665
Mother!

630
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,005
Well, your father's
got a big one too.

631
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,170
Oh, you are
freaking me out.

632
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,179
l was with Fat Fuck Frank
this afternoon.

633
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,306
He seems to really
like your tits.

634
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,113
ls he hung?

635
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,245
He's about
average.

636
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,755
Tell me, Ursula...

637
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,759
'cause that's the name
you like to use, isn't it?

638
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:16,987
Yes it is, Mother.

639
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:20,929
l know that Fat Fuck Frank
is a tit man,

640
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:25,402
but does he ever...
well, you know--

641
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,097
''whistle
in the dark''?

642
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:31,540
Yes, he does.
Thank you for asking.

643
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,373
Oh, my God!
You have met Ray Ray.

644
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:40,611
Oh, Mother!

645
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,614
Goo-goo, da-da

646
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,816
Goo-goo, da-da

647
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:50,691
Officer, it's not like my wife
to just walk away.

648
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,186
She was probably
kidnapped by sex fiends.

649
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,723
We've got orgies going on,
perverts walking around.

650
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:01,169
- Do something.
- l am doing something.

651
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,264
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy

652
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,138
Hmm, bouncy...

653
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,143
Goo-goo,
Goo-goo, ma-ma!

654
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:13,174
- This isn't California.
- lt's Harford Road.

655
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:16,618
Baby just shaved his balls.
You wanna see 'em?

656
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,053
Oh!

657
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,278
l'm a sex addict,

658
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,576
an exhibitionist,

659
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,776
and l'm
your daughter.

660
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:50,719
Oh, oh, Ursula...

661
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,551
ever since
my concussion,

662
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:56,252
l've learned so much
about eros.

663
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,818
l'm a sex addict too.

664
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,763
l'm a cunnilingus
bottom,

665
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,664
and l'm
your mother.

666
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,535
l tried to tell you about my maypole
accident when l was 11.

667
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,433
But you never listened.

668
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:17,004
Oh, l'm so sorry. l'll make it up
to you, Ursula, l promise.

669
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,915
Let's go down
to the Holiday House

670
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,977
and fuck the whole bar.

671
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,353
Okay, Mom.

672
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,951
Let's go sexing!

673
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,598
Ooh-ooh!

674
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,246
- Come on!
- l am coming as fast as l can.

675
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:10,565
Well, l was drivin'
down l-95 the other night

676
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,264
Somebody nearly cut me
right off the road

677
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:17,671
l decided it wasn't
gonna do any good to get mad

678
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:21,007
So l wrote a song
about him instead

679
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,638
lt goes like this...

680
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,377
Were you born
an asshole?

681
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:31,979
Or did you work at it
your whole life?

682
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:36,118
Either way
it's worked out fine

683
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,493
'Cause you're
an asshole tonight...

684
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,066
Ha! Ha! Ha!

685
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,548
Ursula! Ursula! Ursula!

686
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,450
Ursula!
Ursula! Ursula!

687
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,511
Ursula! Ursula! Ursula!

688
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,648
My gal is red hot

689
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,090
Your gal
ain't doodly squat

690
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,959
Yeah, my gal is red hot

691
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,963
Your gal
ain't doodly squat

692
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,862
Well, she ain't got
no money

693
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,799
But man, she's really
got a lot

694
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,338
Well, l got a gal,
six feet four

695
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:25,273
Sleeps in the kitchen
with her feet out the door

696
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,277
My gal is red hot

697
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,302
Your gal
ain't doodly squat

698
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,247
Yeah, my gal
is red hot

699
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,443
Your gal
ain't doodly squat

700
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,213
Well, she ain't got
no money

701
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,982
But man, she's
really got a lot...

702
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,483
Wait up, Vaughn.

703
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,088
Come on, Big Ethel.

704
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,060
Oh, my God.

705
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,194
- Vaughn, l need my pills.
- l know.

706
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:59,272
...Well, she walks
all night, talks all day...

707
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,402
That's my daughter.

708
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,140
That's my daughter!

709
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,239
That's my
daughter!

710
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:09,514
...Yeah, my gal
is red hot...

711
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,646
Caprice!

712
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,317
Capri--

713
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,693
Hi. Hey, come on.
Come on.

714
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,264
Ooh-hh!

715
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:36,642
Well, she's the kinda
woman who's a lounge-around

716
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,444
Spendin' my business
all over town

717
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:42,111
But my gal is red hot

718
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,450
Your gal
ain't doodly squat...

719
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:47,082
Aah! Let me go!

720
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,217
Oh, Big Ethel!

721
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,920
Get off my ass!

722
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,321
Ooh.

723
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,031
Sylvia!

724
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,594
Shoot!

725
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,731
Sylvia...

726
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,505
Sylvia...

727
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,512
Z-Y-X

728
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,707
And W-V-U

729
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,045
T-S-R-Q

730
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,415
P-O-N-M-L-K

731
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,044
J-l-H

732
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,317
G-F-E-D-C-B-A

733
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,382
We say
the backward alphabet

734
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,519
lt's complex

735
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,290
And trouble
to learn too

736
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,788
But you can do it
if you put your mind to it

737
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,630
That's the way...

738
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,761
Now everybody say it

739
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,635
You can do
the backwards alphabet

740
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,162
Z-Y-X...

741
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,368
You can learn
the backwards alphabet

742
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,570
S-R-Q-P...

743
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,374
You can learn
the backwards alphabet...

744
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,254
- Sylvia?
- Hmm?

745
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:04,199
You have what is known
as a ''runaway vagina.''

746
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:06,862
- l do?
- You had a concussion, honey.

747
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:09,804
Sometimes a booboo
on the head

748
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,774
can trigger inappropriate
sexual outbursts.

749
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:15,642
- You're a sex addict, Sylvia.
- And you've hit bottom.

750
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,613
Don't listen
to them, Mother.

751
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,047
Sexual addiction is a privilege.
You know that.

752
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,677
Do you know how embarrassing
this is for me?

753
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,120
One nymphomaniac
in the family's bad enough, but two?!

754
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,590
lt's a disease,
Big Ethel.

755
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,992
Being a whore
is a disease?

756
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,728
Caprice, because of your
criminally enlarged breasts--

757
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,132
You're a freak.

758
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,762
The bloodstream to your brain
has been blocked,

759
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,364
causing
permanent depression.

760
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:46,808
l'm not depressed.
Daddy!

761
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,835
- You should be depressed.
- No, l don't want Prozac!

762
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,474
- No--
- These will make you feel normal.

763
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,212
l don't want to feel normal!
Mother, help me.

764
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:58,415
Caprice, l apologize
for my shameful behavior.

765
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,423
Don't you recognize
the concussion?

766
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,187
Just swallow.

767
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,194
prozac can lower
the libido

768
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,095
and stymie the sexual fantasies
of many female patients.

769
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,793
And then finally, finally we can
schedule you

770
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,495
for a breast reduction operation.

771
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,164
No! l don't
want to be Neuter.

772
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,436
Maybe she's right.
Sex addicts are everywhere.

773
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,103
And soon they're gonna
discover a new sex act.

774
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,907
l'm supposed
to help them.

775
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,641
lt will pass, Sylvia.

776
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,343
No, there's this guy
named Ray Ray

777
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,842
and he is their leader
and he ate me out.

778
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,219
Ugh!

779
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,090
You let strangers put
their germ-filled mouths on your uterus?

780
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,629
Sylvia, Dr. Arlington told me
about these meetings.

781
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,156
Yeah, they're
for people like you.

782
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:47,967
Honey, the whole family
is gonna go, Sylvia.

783
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:50,700
But we're not
telling anybody.

784
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,306
Sylvia...

785
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,441
l've got a hard-on
of gold,

786
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:05,182
and my tongue
is on fire.

787
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,247
Let's go sexing...?

788
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,453
Sylvia, stay
on this side.

789
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:19,293
You had a concussion,
honey.

790
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,203
Mmph.

791
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:32,078
No, Caprice, you know
it doesn't work that way.

792
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,515
lt has to be
an accident.

793
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,129
Oh, please,
l beg of you.

794
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,430
Help me to keep
my sexual sobriety.

795
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,765
Please.

796
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,714
Ho-ho-ho!

797
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,194
Do you like boobs a lot?
Yes, l like boobs a lot

798
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,390
Boobs a lot, boobs a lot,
you gotta like boobs a lot

799
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,524
Really like boobs a lot,
you gotta like boobs a lot

800
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,728
Boobs a lot, boobs a lot,
you gotta like boobs a lot

801
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,862
Down in the locker room,
just we boys

802
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,838
Beating down the locker room
with all that noise

803
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,034
Singing ''Do you like boobs a lot?''
you gotta like boobs a lot...

804
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,236
Boobs a lot, boobs a lot--
you like boobs a lot

805
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,301
Do you wear
your jock a lot?

806
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,309
Oh--!

807
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:45,849
lf l forget
to say my prayers

808
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,585
The devil
jumps with glee

809
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:52,152
That he feels
so awful-awful

810
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:55,653
When he sees me
on my knees

811
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:59,191
So if you're
full of trouble

812
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,672
And you never seem
to win

813
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:05,869
Just open up
your heart

814
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,606
And let the sun
shine in

815
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:13,605
So let the sun
shine in

816
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,847
Face it with a grin

817
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:19,719
Open up your heart

818
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,317
And let the sun
shine in.

819
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,487
Sex.

820
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,496
My name is Paige,

821
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,192
l'm from Roxton
and l am a sex addict.

822
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:33,202
My drug of choice--
frottage,

823
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:36,603
the sexual rubbing-up
on unsuspecting citizens.

824
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,507
''Excuse me,'' l'd say,
while l'd grind my crotch

825
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,841
into an unsuspecting passenger
on a crowded airplane.

826
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,347
Halt, hungry, angry,

827
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,373
lonely, tired.

828
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:50,386
No one ever knew.
l was in first class...

829
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,980
Hello, l'm Ronnie the Rimmer
and l'm a sex addict.

830
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,456
Uh. Uh!

831
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:59,518
l'm Sylvia and
my clitoris is in crisis.

832
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,496
l'm Sylvia's
husband Vaughn,

833
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,591
and... l'm trying
to understand.

834
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,602
And this is my daughter,
Caprice.

835
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,469
Yeah, and Prozac
saved my life.

836
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:14,239
l'm Big Ethel and don't get any ideas,
l'm normal.

837
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:17,508
Hello, l'm Tony the Tickler
and l was a tickle top.

838
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,572
And that's nothing
to laugh at.

839
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:24,053
We are the Stickles family
and it's nice to be here.

840
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,988
Excuse me, l'd say
for the hundredth time...

841
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,457
this is Lu Ann
and Larry.

842
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,517
We were into
''Roman showers.''

843
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,688
Vomiting on each other
as foreplay.

844
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,322
But that doesn't
come up anymore.

845
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,697
No, siree,
a higher power saved us.

846
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,702
l want these
people arrested

847
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,761
and punished
to the full extent of the law.

848
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,898
Let me lead you
to recovery.

849
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,534
Once, a man on jury duty
complained that l rode his knee

850
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,443
when we filed in
to announce the verdict.

851
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,539
But l denied it
to the judge.

852
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,107
Sex addicts
learn to lie.

853
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:59,451
Denial-- don't need you
to know that l am lying.

854
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,287
They call me Dora.

855
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,692
And l'm a chronic
masturbator.

856
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,721
l've been sober
only two weeks now.

857
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:12,064
l'm Sylvia
and l've hit bottom.

858
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,866
...day in and day out.

859
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:18,067
Finally someone reported me
to a security guard and l was arrested.

860
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:22,807
- l would hope so.
- We don't judge others here, madam.

861
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:25,076
Progress, not perfection.

862
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,812
Sex addicts,
your meetings are my life.

863
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,915
Thank you.

864
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,718
Thank you so much.

865
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,555
Halt, hungry, angry,

866
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,618
lonely, tired...

867
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:42,324
All this yelling is giving me
a ''Swedish headache.''

868
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:46,859
you know what l mean?
Horny.

869
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,894
This woman is crazy.

870
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:51,566
Nothing's the matter with ''beating
the beaver'' once in a while.

871
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:56,403
Hello, l'm Paige
and l am a sex addict.

872
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,971
l'm Sylvia
and l can't control

873
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,677
my... ''axis of evil.''

874
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,811
let me be your sponsor,
Sylvia.

875
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,788
Thank you.
l'm so ashamed.

876
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:11,317
- Admit to God-- you are a whore.
- l'm a whore.

877
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,352
Make a list of all
the people you've fucked

878
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,694
and apologize
to their parents.

879
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:18,530
My name
is Mr. Pay Day.

880
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:21,662
- And l'm here for a little scat chat.
- Thank you.

881
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:26,141
A pay day is an unflushed turd,
hence my name.

882
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,179
l used to defecate
in public restrooms

883
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,408
up and down Harford Road

884
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,384
- and never flush the toilet.
- That was him?

885
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:38,854
But my life of turd abuse
didn't stop there, oh no.

886
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:42,187
l started doing
''upper deckers''--

887
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,523
shitting in the top tank
of the toilet,

888
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,620
where no one would ever look
to find the odor.

889
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,154
l can certainly
judge that.

890
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,327
- Progress, not perfection.
- Thank you.

891
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,359
Thank you,
it really means a lot.

892
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:58,636
Hi, my name is Caprice

893
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,405
and l am a sex addict.

894
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,041
l used to be known
as Ursula Udders,

895
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:10,746
but let me tell you,
Ursula Udders is utterly over.

896
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:15,383
l'm on Prozac now
and l am a new woman.

897
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,757
Oh.

898
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:20,854
Halt, hungry, angry...

899
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:24,162
Ever jerk off when one
of your hands is asleep?

900
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,260
No. Look, please,
l'm a Neuter.

901
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:29,271
You should try it.

902
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:33,036
lt feels like
somebody else is doing it.

903
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,169
l defied nature
and now l must pay the price.

904
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:38,180
- Ever take a ''rufie''?
- No!

905
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:41,308
Me neither.
l'm afraid l'd stay home

906
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,945
and date rape myself
all night long.

907
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:48,048
...that l will get
a breast reduction operation.

908
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,218
Yes. l will.

909
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,923
- l promise.
- Yes! Yes!

910
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:56,693
And l will never

911
00:58:56,733 --> 00:59:00,100
be nude again!

912
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:03,833
Thank you.
Thank you.

913
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,433
l got my girls.

914
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,878
Er... er...
my name is Sylvia,

915
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:15,942
And l too
am a sex addict.

916
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:19,011
But l'm not dirty
anymore.

917
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,752
Grrr-rr...

918
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:25,249
That's right, Sylvia. You know how long
your poor dead father had to wait?

919
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:28,856
lt was a long hard road
to this vagina.

920
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:34,767
We must warn others
in the concussion community,

921
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:39,241
that a head injury
is not an excuse for debauchery.

922
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,268
That's right, sister!

923
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,944
But your vagina
belongs to eternity, Sylvia Stickles.

924
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,453
be gone,
Beelzebub.

925
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:54,285
Let my mother's
pussy be!

926
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,417
l'm not your
filthy apostle.

927
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,586
No, sir, no!

928
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,290
l'm not
number anything.

929
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:05,995
He is a fraud. Remember Jim Jones?
Remember People's Temple?

930
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:10,267
He's a sex addict. A filthy controlling
pervert who wants your soul.

931
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:14,072
lt's all mumbo-jumbo.
He's just a filthy man.

932
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,601
Sex addicts,
you are the chosen people.

933
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,477
Help us uncover
nature's secret.

934
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:21,176
Halt, horny,

935
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:25,847
anal, lustful, titties.

936
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:30,484
- Seduce your sponsor.
- One fuck at a time.

937
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,552
lntimacy equals inadequacy.

938
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,757
What's the matter
with you people?

939
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,789
You're wasting
valuable sex time.

940
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,268
Your cunt
is like a charity.

941
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:45,070
You must give,
give and give...

942
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,201
l'm slipping.

943
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,336
l'm slipping.

944
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,813
Recovery is regression.

945
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,408
lt will never pass.

946
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,510
No, don't! l have to.

947
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:00,852
Don't listen to him.

948
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,593
Stop it.
Please, l'm a Neuter!

949
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,893
Concussion sufferers,

950
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:15,426
find the new orgasm
and we'll all be supernatural.

951
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,234
lt's out there, you just...

952
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:21,471
l have to do this.

953
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:26,308
There is no
higher power than sex!

954
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,180
Stop it! Aah-ah!

955
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,516
Stop it, don't touch me.
l've been neutered.

956
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:33,681
Let no sex act...

957
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:36,351
You're fired, David,
and no unemployment neither.

958
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:39,361
lt's okay.
This is sex.

959
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:41,761
There is a beautiful woman
here tonight named Sylvia

960
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,766
who can reveal a secret.

961
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,769
And that woman
is my wife!

962
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:49,863
Vaughn, let us show you
eternal sexual satisfaction.

963
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,897
- We love you.
- Love?!

964
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,774
Whatever you do,
don't call it love.

965
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,280
Oh, God!

966
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,088
Let's go sexing!

967
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:12,117
Help me Mr. Fireman,
please

968
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,459
You know l'm burning
from my head to my knees

969
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,761
l'm aflame with
such a burning desire

970
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,166
That little girl
sets my soul on fire

971
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:23,969
She's got me burning up
like a paper cup

972
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:27,203
Whoo-whoo-whoo,
l'm on fire...

973
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,076
Come on, Dad!

974
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:33,014
- Go, baby.
- Get off of me!

975
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,313
Ooh!

976
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:38,411
Sylvia, Sylvia?

977
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:41,946
Sylvia?

978
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:44,289
...Hmmm, hmmm,
l'm on fire...

979
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:49,098
...the shock of each moment
and still be alive.

980
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:00,340
You've got the devil in your cervix,
that's what you've got.

981
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,209
Come home to my penis
where you belong.

982
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,708
l can't, Vaughn.
l'm a libertine.

983
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,880
l say no
to sexual addiction.

984
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:15,891
You'll get
a yeast infection.

985
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:18,553
Now is the time
for home invasion!

986
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,133
Oh, his pop-up
doesn't pop up anymore...

987
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,146
Somebody help!

988
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,307
lt just doesn't do
the thing it did before...

989
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,145
Somebody gave him pills!

990
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:46,588
...His pop-up will not
pop up anymore.

991
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:51,457
We're gonna make
a nice sauce...

992
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,052
Oh, my God!

993
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,689
Okay, who wants
to fuck me?

994
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,598
l do.

995
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,932
She wants me!

996
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:03,700
- Get off of him!
- Let me go with her!

997
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,673
Have faith, hope
and charity

998
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,198
- Have faith, hope and charity...
- Sex is disgusting!

999
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,801
That's the way
to live successfully

1000
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,904
That's the way
to live successfully

1001
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:11,914
How do l know?
The Bible tells me so...

1002
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:12,937
How do l know?
The Bible tells me so...

1003
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:13,949
How do l know?
The Bible tells me so...

1004
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,951
The Bible
tells me...

1005
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:21,946
Do good
to your enemies

1006
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,618
And the blessed Lord
you'll surely please

1007
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:29,626
How do l know?
The Bible tells me so

1008
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,929
The Bible
tells me

1009
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:35,460
Don't worry
'bout tomorrow

1010
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:39,133
Just be
real good today

1011
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,576
The Lord
is right beside you...

1012
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,603
All right, everybody,
just come on in.

1013
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,706
That's right,
everybody in.

1014
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,979
Thank you. Thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

1015
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:50,645
- We got toilet paper?
- We've got toilet paper.

1016
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,779
We couldn't be
doing this without you.

1017
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,985
Move up,
everybody, okay?

1018
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,687
Now, parents,
talk to your children

1019
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,959
tell them
how repulsive sex is.

1020
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:07,129
And kids, tell your mom and dad
the truth.

1021
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:10,502
Second base isn't just
feeling up a bra strap anymore.

1022
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,507
No, it's a blow job.

1023
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,509
No blow jobs!

1024
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,475
Teenagers everywhere,

1025
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:21,677
come on, join
the Neuter resistance.

1026
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:25,312
We're not here protesting
anything tonight, are we, Neuters?

1027
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,447
No!

1028
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,321
We're for something.

1029
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,326
Yes, yes!

1030
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:35,262
That's right.
We're for the end of tolerance.

1031
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,923
Tolerance went too far
and we all know it.

1032
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,164
No more tolerance!

1033
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:45,173
No more tolerance!
No more tolerance!

1034
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:48,699
No more tolerance! No more tolerance!

1035
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,042
Hurry, hurry!

1036
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,447
Hey, feel like
blowing some tunes?

1037
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:57,816
Come on, don't be shy,
what's the matter with you?

1038
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,821
Hey!

1039
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,722
l'm Sylvia Stickles
and l've got the itch.

1040
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,661
Hoo-hah, hoo-hah...

1041
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,825
Baby, baby...

1042
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,837
Baby, baby, baby...

1043
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,208
Down here!
Come on and join the fun!

1044
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,710
Ooh!

1045
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,447
Hey, hey
you white devil!

1046
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,978
Come on up here and give me
some of that strange.

1047
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,389
...pussy wants
some action.

1048
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,393
That's right, Sylvia,

1049
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,396
we're going pearl diving.

1050
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:46,600
Yes, siree,
l'm looking to go ''below 14th Street.''

1051
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:49,433
Get it, Sylvia,
get it while you can.

1052
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:50,939
l'm coming
as fast as l can.

1053
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:55,406
No, you're not,
motherfucker.

1054
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:57,571
Whoa!

1055
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,205
Get your ass
in here now.

1056
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:02,740
Get out of here,
come on, beat it, Sylvia.

1057
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,032
Fucking tranquilizers.

1058
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:26,873
lt's all right.
Ray Ray is gonna be all better, right?

1059
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:30,572
You betrayed me.

1060
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:33,207
No, l'm back.
l just had a relapse.

1061
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:36,946
Heretics!
Because of you l can't have sex.

1062
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,420
lt's not our fault,
we're sorry.

1063
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,151
Try this.
''Face The Nation.''

1064
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,785
No.
Help me.

1065
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:51,959
- l want to be horny.
- You will be. Concentrate.

1066
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:56,131
Did you know sex
is even infiltrating the economy?

1067
01:07:56,172 --> 01:08:00,802
Experts estimate
at least 15,000 Americans

1068
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,744
are masturbating at work
right this minute.

1069
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:06,907
Masturbation is costing
American business...

1070
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,281
Come back,
Caprice.

1071
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:12,253
Get out.
This is a Neuter establishment.

1072
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:14,415
We don't serve
Ray Ray's people here.

1073
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:18,188
Don't get a breast reduction, Ursula.
Fat Fuck Frank will die.

1074
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:20,957
Oh, his spiritual life
is already dead.

1075
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:22,964
But it's coming!

1076
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:26,695
No, it isn't.
There is no new sex act.

1077
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,999
The Ressur-sexion
is about to happen.

1078
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,097
Oh, God,
you're crazy.

1079
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,938
This is Tuesday night.
This is Harford Road.

1080
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:36,137
This is a school night!

1081
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:44,517
Ladies,
let's start over.

1082
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:47,215
Have you heard about
vaginal restoration?

1083
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:50,157
Any gynecologist
can do it.

1084
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:53,355
The hymen
is sewn back together.

1085
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:54,362
Ah-agh!

1086
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,489
Hey, rent a room,
not here.

1087
01:08:56,532 --> 01:09:00,195
- Get the hell out of my store.
- Just come on, you guys.

1088
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,704
Oh, Vaughn,
get this creep out of here.

1089
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,434
Right now,
l want you out of here.

1090
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:11,509
- Ugh!
- On top of spaghetti

1091
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:14,107
All covered
with cheese...

1092
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,051
Use a napkin,
you freak.

1093
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,520
...l lost my poor
meatball...

1094
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,648
When somebody sneezed...

1095
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,555
- Oh yeah.
- When somebody sneezed.

1096
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:31,025
They're everywhere.
They're in the bushes.

1097
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:34,399
Dad, somebody's
licking our tires.

1098
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,631
- Honey, don't look.
- Hey, pervert!

1099
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,731
Leave our family alone.

1100
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:42,039
- Oof!
- Come on, let's just get out of here.

1101
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:43,408
Oh-ho-ho. Oh.

1102
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:46,175
Ooh, ever hear
of helicoptering?

1103
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,513
Whipping someone's face
with your erect penis?

1104
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,280
- Whap, whap, whap!
- Old hat.

1105
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,446
- Shrimping?
- Everybody licks toes.

1106
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:55,082
Tromboning-- jacking off
when you're taking a crap?

1107
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:58,184
l did that during
the Reagan Administration.

1108
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:01,754
Try some vitamins.

1109
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,063
l need to satisfy someone.

1110
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,071
Oh, yeah.

1111
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,970
Tell me a story

1112
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:18,980
Tell me
a story

1113
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:22,450
Tell me a story,
remember what you said

1114
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,645
You promised me,
you said you would

1115
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,484
You've got to give in
so l'll be good

1116
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:28,285
Tell me a story...

1117
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,383
yes, Mommy's
drying dishes

1118
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:33,156
so that pretty little baby
will have clean plate-plates

1119
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,459
when we move
to our new house.

1120
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:38,125
...Go home without
my raise in pay

1121
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:41,933
- Home by the fire where a man can-
- Mama! Mama!

1122
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,303
Sleep out there
by the chair

1123
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,501
Not a worry,
not a care...

1124
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,581
Come on, you're the cunnilingus
concussion king.

1125
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,181
Am l? Am l?

1126
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,556
So many vaginas,
so little time.

1127
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,151
l try
and do good work.

1128
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,060
Sometimes
chocolate helps.

1129
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,088
Oh, give me
the green one.

1130
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,100
Boy, those fuckers
work.

1131
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:14,694
l managed to cop some spanish fly
down on the block.

1132
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,263
Oh, that's some
good shit.

1133
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:19,569
- Felching?
- Done it.

1134
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,576
- Getting your ''red wings''?
- l got 'em.

1135
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,044
- Plate job?
- Over and under.

1136
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:26,013
- Blossoms?
- Don't want them.

1137
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,515
Ever tried these?

1138
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:31,713
Damn Viagra.
And l'm already there.

1139
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,466
''Astral-orgasm,''

1140
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:49,096
reaching an out-of-body state
through sexual arousal.

1141
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:06,719
Let's go sexing!

1142
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,696
Come on, you can't do that inside.
Take it outside.

1143
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,358
Yeah, l'm looking
for to get blowed.

1144
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:18,457
We don't have that.

1145
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,060
l've been scarred!

1146
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,869
Get off me,
l'm straight.

1147
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:26,204
So's spaghetti till you get it
heated up.

1148
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:28,903
l tell you, this virginal
operation works.

1149
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:31,208
Even the most skeptical man
will be convinced.

1150
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:33,214
You're what l'd call
a pity fuck?

1151
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:37,344
The restored virgin
fills a gelatin capsule with blood

1152
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:40,583
and inserts it into her vagina
just before intercourse.

1153
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:42,249
You're all crazy.

1154
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:45,124
When she has sex for the first time,
the hymen will pop.

1155
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,186
You'll be a virgin
for the second time.

1156
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,666
- Leave us alone.
- Help!

1157
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:55,761
Hey! Hey!
Call the National Guard.

1158
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:56,964
To hell with Harford Road!

1159
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,870
We're moving back to D.C.
Where we belong.

1160
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:00,966
- Frank, call them off.
- But, Ursula,

1161
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:04,410
they are hotter than a fresh fucked fox
in a forest fire, you know that.

1162
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:08,177
l am pure now, Fat Blank Frank,
l'm a Neuter.

1163
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,912
Just let them puppies
loose, honey.

1164
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,149
l have faced the beast of lust
and l have won.

1165
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,986
Besides,
my back hurts.

1166
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:19,653
l get rashes.
Simple chores bother me.

1167
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:22,323
l would like to sleep on my stomach,
if you don't mind.

1168
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:24,855
Please, Ursula...!

1169
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,392
- Let's go sexing.
- N-O spells no!

1170
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:31,895
- Come on, man--
- This isn't that kind of place. Lady!

1171
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:38,739
aah-- auto-erotic
asphyxiation.

1172
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:40,806
Oh, you oughta
try it, ahh!

1173
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:44,808
- Let me in, you know you got it.
- Get away! We're not horny.

1174
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:47,151
We're married.
We don't want anything.

1175
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,755
Somebody somewhere,

1176
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:55,025
finish me up!

1177
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,210
- Huh?
- Feel like getting lucky?

1178
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:21,222
Huh? Huh-Uh.

1179
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:25,485
Hey, how about you?
Huh? How about you?

1180
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:28,189
Uh-huh.

1181
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:38,803
You are barred from
the Pinewood Park-and-Pay.

1182
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:42,674
Ever hear of
mononucleosis?

1183
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,975
Get help!

1184
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:52,350
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, polar bear,

1185
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,412
- you know what an ''otter'' is?
- No.

1186
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:59,826
lt's a bear cub who
isn't fat or hairy yet, but will be.

1187
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:02,592
Find me
a significant otter.

1188
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,862
Ungh!

1189
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,862
Whoop!

1190
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,805
Oof!

1191
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,376
Oh!

1192
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:31,354
Yes!

1193
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:33,361
Get out, you disgusting
piece of filth.

1194
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:35,556
Get out now and
never come back.

1195
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,640
Yeah, baby!

1196
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,047
Oh, no, not you!

1197
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,982
Yeah, baby!

1198
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,986
Yeah, baby!
Whoo-ooh!

1199
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,685
Yeah!

1200
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,626
Ursula! Ursula! Ursula!

1201
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,794
Mom!

1202
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:18,067
Yeah, my gal is
red hot

1203
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:20,131
Your gal
ain't doodly squat

1204
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:23,576
Well she ain't got no money,
but man, she's really got a lot...

1205
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:26,911
Oh, baby, let me bang
your box

1206
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,948
Baby, let me bang
your box

1207
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:33,420
Baby, let me
bang your box

1208
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:36,049
Baby, let me bang

1209
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,958
Baby, let me bang it,

1210
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:41,622
Baby, let me bang

...Let me bang your box,
oh, baby, l'll give you a thrill...

1212
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:58,203
This is a liberated area.

1213
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:00,976
The sexual revolution
has been won.

1214
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,177
You can finally be free.
Come out.

1215
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:05,186
The Neuters have fled.

1216
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,847
There is somebody
for everybody.

1217
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:09,356
- That means you!...
- Ray Ray!

1218
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:12,918
Straight, gay or bi, there's a new sex
act just waiting for you.

1219
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,089
Sex for everybody!
Fuck your neighbors joyously.

1220
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:19,066
Hurry!
You, on your front lawn.

1221
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,035
Join us.
Come on, let's go.

1222
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:23,537
The Neuters are history.

1223
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,563
We are taking over!

1224
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:27,404
Today Harford Road...

1225
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:30,502
Tomorrow the world!

1226
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:33,946
Then all of Baltimore, then up
to Washington and finally New York,

1227
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:36,610
the Midwest, the South,
California,

1228
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,052
Europe, Japan,
North Korea--

1229
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:41,317
the whole world will soon
fuck at the same time.

1230
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:43,916
Sexual anarchy
will finally happen.

1231
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,322
Come on, let's go!
Jump on!

1232
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:02,432
Ladies and gentlemen,
the captain has informed us

1233

our final approach

1234

Washington National Airport.

1235
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,241
Mr. Hasselhoff?

1236
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:11,275
Sorry to interrupt,
but you are my favorite star.

1237

Excuse me one second.

1243
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:31,030

01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:36,463
Oh...

1252
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,878
Honey...

1254
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:01,954
- Oh.

1255
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:06,127
Oh-hh!

1256
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:12,406
- Ha-ha!
- No, Vaughn, l've done that.

1257
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:16,500
You know, don't you?

1258
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,619
Oh!

1259
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,468
Oh-hh!

1260
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,948
Oh-hh...!

1261
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:13,463
She was
a Neuter.

1262
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:16,664
A sexual anorexic
whose time has come.

1263
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,423
Ow! Oh!

1264
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:59,012
Big Ethel...?

1265
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:08,249
Ooh-oh!

1266
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,841
The big ''O.''

1267
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:15,920
Do it for us
one more time, Ray Ray.

1268

Let's go sexing!

1271
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:55,886
At the end of a rainbow

1272
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:59,832
You'll find
a pot of gold

1273
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:03,634
At the end of a story

1274
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:06,970
You'll find
it's all been told

1275
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:11,445
But our love
has a treasure

1276
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,971
Our hearts
can always spend

1277
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:19,180
And it has a story

1278
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:24,089
Without any end

1279
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:27,925
At the end of a river

1280
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:31,762
The water stops
its flow

1281
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,998
At the end of a highway

1282
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:39,097
There's no place
you can go

1283
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:43,167
But just tell me
you love me

1284
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:47,580

Of time

1288
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:08,501
At the end of a river

1289
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:12,632
The water stops
its flow

1290
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:16,610
At the end of a highway

1291
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:19,841

01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:23,977

And our love will go on

1295
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:36,160
Till the end...

1296
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:41,100
Of time

1297
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:45,800
Till the end...

1298
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:51,210
Of time.

When you make me

A funny feeling

1305
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:23,971
Pounding in my head

1306
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,980
My hands are trembling

1307
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,346
My eyes are turning red

1308
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,214

1309
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:32,947
With a heavy load

1310
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:34,818
Like a volcano

1311
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,120

1312
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:39,422

There's lava in my veins

1325
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,346
Pumping with passion

1326
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:42,447
Throbbing with desire

1327
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:46,426
A heatseeker missile

1328
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:49,328
