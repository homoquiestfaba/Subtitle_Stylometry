2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,299
I don't understand!

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:08,200
It was supposed to be
a routine telemetry implant.

4
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:11,170
Standard tag and monitor, then
weighed, sexed and measured!

5
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:13,772
Apparently, behavioral
patterns are highly erratic.

6
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:15,473
Banging into the side of
the tank, tearing off pieces

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,111
of her own skin, could be an
allergic reaction to the tag.

8
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:20,745
Bacterial infection maybe?

9
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,447
We might have to run
bloodwork on glucose, cortisol

10
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:25,217
and lactate to gauge levels
on medium term consequences.

11
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:27,053
She's going into convulsions!

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,057
I have pulses and electrical
activity in the systemic heart!

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,860
What do you need?

14
00:00:35,928 --> 00:00:39,131
We have to initiate
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

15
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:41,334
100 micrograms epinephrine!

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,767
Anything else?

17
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,437
Prep one dose lidocaine,

18
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,572
one magnesium chloride in case
we have to remove the tag!

19
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:49,507
The IE injectors are
in the supply!

20
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:51,010
There should be a
whole new batch in there!

21
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:53,112
The stuff from Eden Zoo
had to be destroyed.

22
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:57,482
100 micrograms now!

23
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:07,625
Here!

24
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,734
Five!

25
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,205
10 seconds!

26
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,242
15! No response!

27
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,279
20 seconds!
Still no response!

28
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:30,249
I think we lost her!

29
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:32,684
Counting down to
one-half minute!

30
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,765
Ah!

31
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:54,006
[screams]

32
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,607
No!

33
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,879
[screaming]

34
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:11,183
Welcome to a world of wonder.

35
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,886
Nearly 72% of our planet
is covered in water,

36
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:18,090
home to one million
different species of life.

37
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:21,093
Even now, humankind
continues to unlock

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,864
the extraordinary secrets
that lurk beneath the surface.

39
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,700
There is a place where
these mysteries of the deep

40
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:31,170
are explored and celebrated.

41
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:35,407
That place is the Shining Sea
Aquarium.

42
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:39,145
We strive to educate,
protect, and inspire

43
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:42,914
through our many innovative
exhibits and learning programs

44
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,682
that bring you face to face

45
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:47,620
with our planet's most
exotic creatures.

46
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:51,123
So come, step into
that world of wonder.

47
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,893
Immerse yourself in imagination
and observe our oceans

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,265
like never before...
at Shining Sea Aquarium.

49
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:27,859
The vets did an ultrasound
on our dolphin, Hannah,

50
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:30,429
last week and nothing
came back abnormal.

51
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:33,332
But on closer examination,
I have found

52
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,900
lesions on the hearts
and the tissues

53
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:37,735
in the surrounding areas
that are consistent

54
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:39,771
with heart failure.

55
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:41,706
I'm not really
gonna be satisfied

56
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:43,509
until I do some more tests.

57
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:46,078
But I have never
seen a dolphin's condition

58
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:50,115
deteriorate so quickly
unless it was something viral.

59
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:55,887
Ugh.

60
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,260
Oh! Um...

61
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:02,628
Am I too early?

62
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,063
I can come back.

63
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,365
No. Hi, Joe.
You're... You're fine.

64
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,001
I think I'm all done here.
I've got everything I need.

65
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:12,504
What do you want me
to do about disposal?

66
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:14,006
Oh.

67
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:15,608
We have to recycle her

68
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:19,545
per the new company policy
from the people up above.

69
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,046
Mm.

70
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,382
Not a fan of that choice myself.

71
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,351
Me neither.

72
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:26,485
Hannah deserves better.

73
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:36,828
Hey, Joe, would you hold off
for a little while

74
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:38,497
rolling her out?

75
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:41,600
We've got a VIP experience
at the shark exhibit

76
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:45,638
and I would rather the guest
see the sharks eat mackerel

77
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:47,139
instead of Hannah.

78
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:49,375
- Sure thing.
- Thanks, Joe.

79
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,948
It's too bad.

80
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:29,881
[bell rings]

81
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,987
Oh...

82
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,759
Hey, Ellen.
I've got a morning feed.

83
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,127
What's up?

84
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,196
Daniel, I'm checking
to make sure that

85
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:45,764
all of those medications
that you received

86
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,133
from our facility
were destroyed.

87
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,501
Yeah, I handled it myself.

88
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:51,136
Our logistics firm moved
all the doses

89
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,705
out of the veterinary wing.

90
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:54,306
Moved?

91
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,708
You need to make sure
that they were destroyed!

92
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:57,242
Do you hear me?

93
00:06:57,309 --> 00:07:00,079
No worries, Ellen.
I am sure that it is handled.

94
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:02,114
Anytime one of our team
members is called out,

95
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:04,783
they must submit and
execute a disposal form.

96
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:06,352
What's with the urgency?

97
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,587
I mean, none of
that product has expired.

98
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:10,222
There was an incident!

99
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,391
We had an animal that
had a severe adverse reaction

100
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,759
to the dosage

101
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:15,127
and I cannot take a
chance of something like that

102
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:16,861
happening at your facility.

103
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:20,232
The best thing for you to do
is just destroy the shipment.

104
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:22,935
Burn it and use whatever
you have on reserve.

105
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,869
But you need to call
and confirm now.

106
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:27,773
No, it is confirmed.

107
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,375
We use an outside logistics firm

108
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:31,777
that has no storage
space at their facility.

109
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:33,112
They only perform a disposal

110
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:34,680
of anything they pick
up at our lab.

111
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,648
I got the paperwork
somewhere here in the office.

112
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:38,883
You're sure?
Positive?

113
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,085
Yeah, yeah.
It's all good.

114
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:41,720
Everything's taken care of.

115
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:44,490
I don't want to put anyone
at your park in danger.

116
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,426
No, and I appreciate that and
we do not want that either.

117
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,027
Thank you for
confirming, Daniel.

118
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,963
You are welcome.
Bye-bye.

119
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,698
I gotta go.

120
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:56,001
Morning feed, VIP, As you always
say, I can't be late.

121
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,254
Hey, good morning!

122
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,223
And welcome to what I think
is the best part of

123
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,094
the Shining Sea Aquarium,
the Shark Encounter.

124
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,595
My name is Daniel and you are...

125
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:25,063
- Skylar.
- Skylar.

126
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,498
Did not know that
was also a dude's name.

127
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:28,967
I'm one of
the senior aquarists here.

128
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,769
And I will be your guide
on your meet and greet

129
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,704
with some of the best
the park has to offer.

130
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:34,239
Hey, man, this is pretty cool.

131
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,374
Look, I've never done
anything like this.

132
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,209
But, hey, it's my birthday,

133
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:38,510
so I said let's try
something new today, right?

134
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:40,312
- So it's your birthday?
- Yeah.

135
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,814
Oh, it's your birthday,
it's your birthday.

136
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,815
No, no, I'm kidding.

137
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,416
Hey, this is for you.

138
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,985
Got a couple of t-shirts
in there, some aquarium swag,

139
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:49,221
a birthday gift
from your friends here

140
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:50,489
at the Shining Sea Aquarium.

141
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:51,924
Thank you.

142
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,660
I also have some fish here
that our sharks like to eat,

143
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:57,196
a little bonito, some cod,
some mackerel...

144
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:59,531
Hey, a little broth,
some garlic and tomatoes,

145
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:01,066
you got yourself
a bouillabaisse there.

146
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,402
A dude named Skylar
who also cooks?

147
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:04,770
It's a diverse world, man.

148
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,238
Oh, it is now.

149
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:07,639
But I'm in my second year
of nursing school.

150
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:09,908
So I don't have time
for a love life,

151
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:12,044
let alone a hot cooked meal.

152
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,580
Well, you're in luck.
You don't have to cook this.

153
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:15,581
They like to eat it raw.

154
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:16,582
So do I.

155
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:18,183
And here we are!

156
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,354
The best shark experience
you'll ever experience.

157
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,024
Now in this tank is
one of the fastest

158
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:29,194
and most powerful sharks
in the ocean, the Maco.

159
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:31,363
We work on a tunnel system here.

160
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,434
So they have to swim through
that portal in order to feed.

161
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:36,735
Ooh!

162
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:40,372
It also gives us a front
row seat to the feast.

163
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,840
Hey, they're pretty quick.

164
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:44,610
Oh, yeah. They are amazing.

165
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:48,547
They have 12 serrated teeth on
the upper jaw, 11 on the lower.

166
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:51,550
You definitely don't want these
bad boys taken up in a tornado.

167
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,252
Why would a shark
be in a tornado?

168
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:55,721
You know... 'cause of the...

169
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:57,957
Yeah, never mind.
It's a boomer joke.

170
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:00,325
I think sharks are some of the
coolest creatures in the ocean.

171
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,195
But I'm a fan
favorite of the walrus.

172
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:04,730
- Get out!
- Yeah.

173
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:06,966
You know, they're like
gentle giants, you know?

174
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,367
Like those tusks? Man!

175
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,868
Hey, would a shark
ever attack a walrus?

176
00:10:09,936 --> 00:10:11,870
No, no, no. They're never
in the same habitat.

177
00:10:11,938 --> 00:10:14,406
Macos like, uh,
sea turtles and other sharks.

178
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:15,874
Huh.

179
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:19,077
The tusks of a walrus and
the serrated teeth of a Maco...

180
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:21,079
pretty good matchup.

181
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:22,214
I got my money on a walrus.

182
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:23,983
I think you'd lose that bet.

183
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:27,686
- <i>Daniel, what is your 20?</i>
- Oh, I'm sorry. One second.

184
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,489
Dan here on that
VIP feed like I told you.

185
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:32,257
Okay. I just wanted to know
if you'd taken care

186
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:34,159
of that Eden Zoo supply.

187
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:36,562
Miranda, I took care of it.

188
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:38,630
I've been here a while.
You gotta trust me.

189
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:40,666
No, no, no.
It's not that I don't trust you.

190
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:43,235
It's just...
I want this Senator Blackburn

191
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,470
meeting to just
go perfectly.

192
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:49,374
Anything for you, beautiful.

193
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,842
Get back to work, Daniel.

194
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,781
She's got a thing for me.

195
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:35,821
All right, when we get in there,

196
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:37,222
don't let me get caught up
in a debate with Miranda.

197
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:38,958
Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,293
If the conversation starts going
nowhere, get me out of there.

199
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,461
I don't care what you tell her.

200
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:45,897
- Understood?
- Yep, understood.

201
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:47,934
I don't want to spend all day
in here with her,

202
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:49,035
she'll complain constantly.

203
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:50,369
Mm-hm.

204
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:51,971
All right, what else
have you got?

205
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:53,872
That guy from the Picayune
Herald paper called again.

206
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,642
He wants to know if you're
planning on running for Governor

207
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,411
after your tenure in the
State Senate comes to an end.

208
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:01,213
Well, he's assuming
I am now, isn't he?

209
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,781
Well, aren't you?

210
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,083
Yes.

211
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:07,053
My poll numbers are
through the roof.

212
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,487
I'm not gonna give
that clown

213
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,589
at the Picayune-Herald
an exclusive.

214
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:13,425
- Okay.
- Just tell him "no comment".

215
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:14,826
- Do that.
- Mm-hm.

216
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:16,528
All right, what else?

217
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:20,165
Uh, tomorrow, meeting with
the historic landmarks board.

218
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:21,500
- Get that for me.
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,536
No. Change that.
Reschedule it.

220
00:12:24,603 --> 00:12:27,506
There's no reason that
a barn built in 1903

221
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,241
should stand in the way
of low-income housing

222
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:31,810
for 32 families.

223
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,178
All right.

224
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,513
Senator Blackburn, good morning.

225
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,349
- Good morning.
- Right on time, as usual.

226
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,650
The senator has
a very tight schedule.

227
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,385
We can't afford to fall behind.

228
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:42,521
I had Beth pencil you
in so that we could listen

229
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:44,489
to your concerns,
your complaints.

230
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,625
And we're gonna come up
with solutions today, okay?

231
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,028
Well, I really appreciate that.

232
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:50,529
We have a lot to talk about.

233
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:10,549
[moaning]

234
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:17,823
Oh!

235
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,359
[growling]

236
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:29,068
Hello? Hello?

237
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:30,268
[growling]

238
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:46,219
Come in?

239
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,786
Clu? Miranda?
This is Dr. James!

240
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:50,522
I need you both to
the veterinary wing now!

241
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:54,193
Come in!
This is Dr. James!

242
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,928
Come in!

243
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:56,929
Come in...

244
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:01,399
No... No. No!

245
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:07,806
<i>Come in! Come in!
Clu? Miranda?</i>

246
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:10,475
I'm on my way.

247
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,377
Christie, meet me
at the Veterinary.

248
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:14,147
I'm on it.

249
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:15,480
<i>I'll be down in a second.</i>

250
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:17,682
Hey, Clu, can you
see what Karen needs?

251
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:19,451
I'm with the senator right now.

252
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:22,121
- <i>Okay, will do.</i>
- Thanks.

253
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:25,290
I am so sorry.
Where was I?

254
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:27,692
Oh, right.

255
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,762
Our facility is in need
of some major

256
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:34,733
technological infrastructure
upgrades for over a decade now.

257
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,970
I mean, our connection
network is so antiquated,

258
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:40,106
we could put
the components on display

259
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:43,575
at the Maritime History Wing.

260
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:47,280
Look, we need a new heating
and cooling system

261
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,314
for all of the enclosures,

262
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:51,783
upgraded water toxicity sensors.

263
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,854
Our animal safety mechanisms
are so inadequate

264
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:58,490
because we don't even have a
high-speed network connection.

265
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:00,492
What about some of
the local supportive initiatives

266
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,994
that we discussed?

267
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,730
Direct and in-kind donations,
ticket sales?

268
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:08,567
I mean, they might keep the
lights on and the animals fed.

269
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:12,138
But gift shop sales
aren't going to cut it.

270
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,606
What about an online store?

271
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:17,009
There you go.
That'll generate some revenue.

272
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:18,410
Write that down.

273
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:20,779
Great.
Get me the funding.

274
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:26,818
I need financing, the kind
of financing that you can get.

275
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,089
Sponsors,
corporate partnerships,

276
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:32,557
one of those black tie galas

277
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:35,261
that we can bring in
new sponsors and donors.

278
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:38,864
You might be the CEO and
president of this facility,

279
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:42,767
but I am the one who is keeping
these animals safe and healthy.

280
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:45,470
And you're very
much appreciated for it.

281
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:48,540
Look, for all the talk
of conservation

282
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,709
we do for this facility,

283
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:54,247
we need so many upgrades to
get this place to go green.

284
00:15:54,313 --> 00:15:56,781
[grumbles]

285
00:15:56,848 --> 00:15:59,751
Look, I can...
I can ask for funding,

286
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:01,287
but it's gonna have
to be after the first

287
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:02,888
of the fiscal year, okay?

288
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:04,789
Doing great here.

289
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:06,825
Every penny that goes
into this facility

290
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:09,794
goes back to these amazing
and incredible creatures!

291
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,638
Wow.

292
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:22,908
So... So let me
get this straight.

293
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:24,576
You're saying
this was an octopus?

294
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:27,013
The duct.
It's in the duct!

295
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,614
It killed Hyde and Price and
then it went into the...

296
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:31,250
Slow down, slow down.

297
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:32,450
Okay.

298
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:33,585
What happened, Dr. James?

299
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:35,154
It killed them.

300
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:38,523
We must close the duct
before it gets out!

301
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,127
This animal has
become reanimated.

302
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:44,163
And there's no telling
the level of toxic bacteria

303
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,466
growing in its body or
if it will attack again!

304
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:52,004
Gotcha.

305
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,195
Okay, we gotta move fast.

306
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:18,697
But we can't close
all the ducts down at once.

307
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:21,900
Unfortunately, every vent
has to be shut down manually

308
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:24,036
in every room, hall and
exhibit in the building.

309
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:25,737
We also got to let
Miranda know

310
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:27,073
that we got to go
on lockdown now.

311
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:28,673
Yeah.

312
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:32,144
Miranda.

313
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,645
Do you hear me, Miranda?

314
00:17:33,712 --> 00:17:35,081
Miranda, do you copy?

315
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:37,782
- She's with the senator, right?
- Yes.

316
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,085
She may have turned
off her radio.

317
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:41,087
- I'll go find her.
- Okay.

318
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,791
Christie?
Christie, come in!

319
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,626
<i>Hey Clu, go for Christie.</i>

320
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,196
Christie, we have an
animal on the loose,

321
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:52,664
possibly inside of the ducts.

322
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:54,532
It killed two of
our vet techs.

323
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,636
Conduct a sweep of every room in
the wing in case it slipped out.

324
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,407
<i>Do not approach.
You radio me if you see it.</i>

325
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:02,942
Copy?

326
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:04,176
Copy that.

327
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:13,618
So, for example,
on Tuesdays and Fridays,

328
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,854
we have started
doing a VIP Experience

329
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,190
before the aquarium opens.

330
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:22,194
If we started to do more of
this, then maybe we could...

331
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:23,795
Karen?

332
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:30,835
Karen, what's wrong?
What happened?

333
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,871
Sorry about this, Hannah.

334
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:36,342
I know Miranda's devastated...

335
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:37,842
And, uh...

336
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,162
[dolphin squeaks, growls]

337
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:03,269
[screaming]

338
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:12,178
[rattling]

339
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:19,318
Dr. James, what happened?

340
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:22,687
It killed them and
it almost killed me...

341
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:24,056
- What?
- Wait.

342
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:26,559
Who is dead?
What is she talking about?

343
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,094
The octopus.

344
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,463
We brought it in for
a tagging blend.

345
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:32,364
There were
post-op complications.

346
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:33,598
It went into cardiac arrest.

347
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,867
I administered the standard IE

348
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:38,736
and now it's crawled
into the duct.

349
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,773
For all we know, it's already
managed to escape the building.

350
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,910
Okay, we are officially
closing for the day

351
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,679
and we're going on the lockdown.

352
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:49,048
- Okay.
- I'm gonna contact the police.

353
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:51,649
Clu, can you come in?
Copy.

354
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:54,886
Miranda, what's your 20?
I've been trying to reach you!

355
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:56,654
We're in the main concourse.

356
00:19:56,721 --> 00:20:00,226
This animal has
become reanimated.

357
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:04,063
Did you...
did you say reanimated?

358
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,764
Oh, come on!
That is impossible.

359
00:20:08,134 --> 00:20:09,168
Okay...

360
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:12,538
- Karen...
- Yeah?

361
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:14,672
Tell me what happened.

362
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:18,310
We may have a viral outbreak
on our hands

363
00:20:18,377 --> 00:20:21,947
that could infect and kill every
living thing in this facility.

364
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,450
- What?
- I know, I know.

365
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:27,153
[rattling, glass cracks]

366
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:33,392
What... was that?

367
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:39,999
That is extreme pacing behavior

368
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:44,203
and they're doing it
at the same time.

369
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:48,507
Oh, my God, they're trying
to compromise the tank!

370
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:51,143
Run! Run!

371
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,119
[alarm blares]

372
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:09,328
Miranda! Come in! Miranda!

373
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,695
What's going on?

374
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:11,997
I'm calling 911 now.

375
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,169
That's water.

376
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,305
One of the tanks
has been compromised.

377
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,108
We're officially
going into lockdown.

378
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:24,776
I'm not getting trapped in here!

379
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:26,312
I'll get on the boat
and get help!

380
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:27,947
Christie!

381
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:29,881
Christie... Christie, wait!

382
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:38,390
Oh, my purse!

383
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:42,161
Just leave it!

384
00:21:42,228 --> 00:21:43,929
The water pressure
will kill you!

385
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:47,865
[rattling]

386
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,970
Christie, if you can hear me,
radio back when you reach help.

387
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:53,305
I'll try to override the
lockdown and let you in.

388
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:56,175
[growling]

389
00:21:56,242 --> 00:21:57,509
Oh my God.

[gasps]

391
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:08,387
Oh my God.

392
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:17,096
[growling]

393
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:21,166
[screams]

394
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:36,415
Hey, what's going on?
This normal?

395
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,484
Could be a variety of things.
Hang on a second.

396
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,485
Like what?

397
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:40,818
Miranda, this is Daniel.

398
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:42,087
Can you tell me
the source of the alarm?

399
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,392
Miranda, Daniel.
Come in.

400
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,393
I'm just gonna call 911.

401
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:51,297
Yes, 911?

402
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:53,365
I think there's a fire
at the Shining Sea Aquarium!

403
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:54,799
Can you send someone?

404
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:57,736
Yes, that's my current location!
Can you send someone?

405
00:22:57,802 --> 00:22:59,038
Thank you, thank you.

406
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:01,707
We gotta go through
the other way.

407
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:03,509
Why isn't the door opening?

408
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:04,909
Because the door is locked.

409
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:06,578
We are on lockdown.

410
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:08,013
One of the tanks must
have breached or something.

411
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,682
Lockdown?
What do you mean?

412
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,016
- We're stuck here?
- Don't worry about it.

413
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,484
There's no fire or anything.

414
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,086
Otherwise, the sprinklers
would have gone off.

415
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:15,688
But I just told 911
there's a fire!

416
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:17,356
Dude, it doesn't matter
what you told them.

417
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:18,624
They can't get in
and we can't get out

418
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:19,891
until the lockdown is over.

419
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,859
So chill out.
Follow the leader.

420
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:24,229
We've got to go through
the Sea Otter Exhibit, okay?

421
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:25,397
[growling]

422
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:28,133
We're already here.

423
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:31,670
My purse got swept away
in the water!

424
00:23:31,737 --> 00:23:33,372
You lost my phone?

425
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,507
I had everything in
there, mine and yours.

426
00:23:35,574 --> 00:23:37,476
Miranda!

427
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,278
No.

428
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:40,412
Dr. James?

429
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:42,981
I left mine charging
in my office

430
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,417
when I went in to surgery
on the octopus!

431
00:23:45,484 --> 00:23:48,053
The fire doors close
each quadrant.

432
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,189
The alarm is going.
Help is on the way!

433
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:52,091
Will this thing every turn off?

434
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:54,126
Yeah, it'll turn off
in a second.

435
00:23:58,597 --> 00:23:59,864
[alarm stops]

436
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:03,035
Okay.

437
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:06,004
So, basically, each quadrant
works independently.

438
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,173
When there's a fire,
they all shut

439
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,743
so it doesn't spread
to protect the animals.

440
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:11,977
It should
do the same for flooding

441
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:13,412
and keep the animals contained.

442
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,013
But we need to get
out of here, so why...

443
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,615
Would you stop!

444
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:21,320
Please, just stay calm.

445
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:24,189
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

446
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:28,827
Don't be sorry.
Just stay calm.

447
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:30,562
We won't be in here very long.

448
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:32,498
We'll be out of here soon.
Just relax.

449
00:24:32,564 --> 00:24:36,368
Just as long as we can get
the failsafe protocols released.

450
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:40,205
Clu, are you there?
Are you okay?

451
00:24:42,508 --> 00:24:45,577
Yes, but Christie
didn't make it.

452
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:52,484
Where are you?

453
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:54,420
I'm headed to the Central Access
to see

454
00:24:54,486 --> 00:24:56,288
if all that water
shorted the breakers

455
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:59,091
and find out what's online
and what's down.

456
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:01,193
If I can reboot the system,
I can get us out of here.

457
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:06,765
For now, the only contact
we have with the outside world

458
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:08,267
is through cellphones.

459
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,669
And if the surveillance
systems are down,

460
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:13,305
we're pretty much moving blind
through this place.

461
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:25,117

60 miles an hour

with a busted boot.

You can't handle this?

Come on, man!

Miranda, come in.

477
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,148
Miranda, I think
the octopus was here.

478
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:34,186
It might be on the move.

479
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:38,123
Copy, Clu.
Be careful.

480
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,458
Stay alert.

481
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:42,794
Copy. You too.

482
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:45,697
Okay, I'm gonna check in
to see if the coast is clear.

483
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:55,541
It's clear. Come on, let's go.
Hurry, hurry.

00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:08,053
Okay.

Don't touch the fence!
It's electrified!

494
00:27:33,645 --> 00:27:35,048
What?

495
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,182
No!

496
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,719
What was that, man?

497
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,287
I ain't never seen
otters act like that!

498
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:43,990
I don't know.
I haven't either.

499
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:45,357
Something is up
with the animals.

500
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:47,259
What you trying to do?

501
00:27:47,326 --> 00:27:49,963
I thought I could
turn off the fence.

502
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:52,130
But I don't have a key
and we're surrounded by it.

503
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:53,565
Okay, well, we need
to figure something out.

504
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,167
Like we can get
a ladder or something!

505
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:56,501
Inside.

506
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:57,803
Well, let's stack
some tables up!

507
00:27:57,869 --> 00:27:59,237
Bolted to the ground!

508
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:00,772
Okay, we need to figure out
something, okay?

509
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,208
We're smarter than the fish!
We got hands!

510
00:28:03,275 --> 00:28:06,079
All right, number one,
dude, that is speciest.

511

Two, otters are mammals.

512
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,382
We just need to get
inside the aquarium.

513
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:12,451
You wanna go back...
back inside there

514
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:14,419
with the rest of those mammals?

515
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,688
There's just fish tanks,
there's no mammals.

516
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,057
Okay, but what
about them sharks?

517
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:19,725
I remember how fast they were!

518
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,193
Last time I checked,
they don't walk, hop or skip.

519
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:22,494
I think we'll be fine.

520
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:24,363
Yeah, but they
got teeth, remember?

521
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:26,832
Yes, behind two feet
of transparent acrylic!

522
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:28,133
They're not gonna
break through that!

523
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,936
Okay.

524
00:28:30,003 --> 00:28:31,203
So... but how do
we get back in?

525
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:32,504
We're locked out, remember?

526
00:28:32,571 --> 00:28:34,740
There are tunnels
under the aquarium.

527
00:28:34,806 --> 00:28:35,774
Tunnels?

528
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,110
Yes, yes, with offices.

529
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:38,543
Okay, with offices.

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,312
- And telephones!
- Okay. They got a restroom?

531
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:42,081
Yeah, and a candy machine too.

532
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:45,751
Good. You need a candy bar.
You're a little hangry.

533
00:28:45,817 --> 00:28:47,619
Sorry.
Just a little stressed.

534
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:53,625
Okay, everything is locked down,

535
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,828
so we need to find another
option other than the doors.

536
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:59,431
Clu is working on a way out,

537
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:01,600
but I don't think
she's going get us out in time.

538
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,701
[growling]

539
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:08,407
Okay, everyone just stay quiet
and stay behind me.

540
00:29:08,473 --> 00:29:10,943
What? What's that?

541
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,745
Shh!
Just keep moving.

542
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:14,780
Miranda, what is it?

543
00:29:14,846 --> 00:29:16,548
Sounds like crocodiles.

544
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:28,527
Just stay quiet and follow.

545
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,096
[gasping]

546
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:31,863
I knew it!

547
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:36,902
Get down.

548
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:23,315
Okay, I think it's gone.
Let's move.

549
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:24,683
Okay.

550
00:30:25,952 --> 00:30:28,020
There it is.

551
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:30,889
Run!

552
00:30:30,957 --> 00:30:32,657
Oh, Jesus, go!

553
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:36,628
Quick!
Quick! In here!

554
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,438
The nearest water is at the
front entrance of the place.

555
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:48,273
I don't see any smoke.

556
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:52,711
Well, maybe they got it under
control and didn't cancel.

557
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,681
It's a fire until
we find out it's not.

558
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:01,254
It's also locked.

559
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,990
I thought this place was open.

560
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:08,094
Dispatch, this is 19.
We're on the property.

561
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:09,394
Not seeing anyone on site

562
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:11,264
nor am I seeing any
kind of emergency.

563
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,099
Caller didn't cancel?
Over.

564
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,299
<i>Negative. No cancel.</i>

565
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:16,002
Copy.

566
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:18,870
We'll do a lap around the
property, confirm false alarm.

567
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:20,872
In the meantime,
can you get us information

568
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,675
on maybe head of security
or someone on site?

569
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:25,644
Copy that.
Be careful.

570
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,678
Over.

571
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:28,080
Let's check it out.

572
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:35,821
I got the number.
I'll give 'em a call.

573
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:39,791
Keep getting a message.

574
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:44,362
It's the main switchboard.

575
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:45,630
Hours of Operation.

576
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:49,534
They're not open 'til 11 a.m.

577
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:51,103
Let's check around back.

578
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,642
I think we need to find
some armor or something.

579
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,178
Armor?

580
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:00,213
Armor, dude?

581
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,214
Yes!

582
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,581
What are you gonna do?

583
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:03,582
Lay down and let
'em roll you around?

584
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:06,585
What we need is this.

585
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:09,255
What about me?
I need one!

586
00:32:09,322 --> 00:32:11,090
I need an ax for this creepy
pirate ship you got me on!

587
00:32:11,157 --> 00:32:12,657
It's Pirate's Bay!

588
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,693
Okay. Now a pirate fish
gonna come attack me now?

589
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,229
Relax. It's a kid's area.

590
00:32:16,295 --> 00:32:18,463
Oh, ain't no skeletons
or Krakens gonna come?

591
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,133
No. That was last season.

592
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:30,775
[shouting]

593
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:32,345
- Damn it!
- Damn, it won't open?

594
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,511
It won't open!

595
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:36,349
- Why not?
- It's locked!

596
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:37,849
So what do we do?
What do we do?

597
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:38,951
Whatever we can!

598
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:40,319
Whatever we can?
Whatever you can!

599
00:32:40,385 --> 00:32:42,454
You're the one with the ax!

600
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,822
Oh, damn.

601
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,992
Come and get it!

602
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:49,362
Ah!

603
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,163
[shouting]

604
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,000
What do I do? Oh! Ah!

605
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:55,268
- What do I do?
- Get it off me!

606
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:57,303
- How?
- The ax!

607
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,139
Oh, God, no!

608
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:01,307
No, no, no, no, no!

609
00:33:01,374 --> 00:33:02,607
Whack it!
Don't crack it!

610
00:33:06,312 --> 00:33:08,047
Ah!

611
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:09,781
Woo!
Take that, bitch!

612
00:33:09,848 --> 00:33:11,516
[panting]

613
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,855
Oh, God!

614
00:33:21,493 --> 00:33:23,195
That was not fun!

615
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:25,064
Where's the first aid kit?

616
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:27,699
Gimme that.

617
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:31,370
You know, maybe
I should hold the ax.

618
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:33,438
Oh! Oh!

619
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:36,008
Ah!

620
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:40,346
Ah!

621
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:42,914
Should have got that armor
when I had the chance!

622
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:49,021
You're fixing my face!

623
00:33:49,088 --> 00:33:52,590
We can't stay here forever!
Let's see if it wandered off.

624
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:57,762
I think it's gone.

625
00:33:59,332 --> 00:34:00,465
I'll go first.

626
00:34:06,272 --> 00:34:09,008
Listen, we need to
find the nearest door

627
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:11,609
and smash our way
through the glass.

628
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:13,145
That won't work.

629
00:34:13,212 --> 00:34:14,813
Why? It worked for the fish.

630
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,816
There are 100 species
of wildlife

631
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:21,020
propelling through thousands
of pounds of weight,

632
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:24,357
through hundreds of thousands
of gallons of water.

633
00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:26,658
There's got to be a way
to smash through it!

634
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:29,828
It's reinforced with Lucite

635
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:32,731
and then coated with
a commercial window tint.

636
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:34,699
Even if you were to crack it,

637
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:37,269
it's engineered not to break.

638
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,108
You can't cut it
and you can't tear it.

639
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:48,280
Well, the fish figured it out,

640
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,950
and I can't accept that
fish are smarter than us.

641
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:55,820
There has to be a release
latch or a mechanism

642
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,756
of some sort that
can open these doors.

643
00:34:57,822 --> 00:34:59,557
It won't work.

644
00:34:59,624 --> 00:35:02,928
The only way the doors are open
is from the Central Access

645
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,896
so the surveillance
cameras can see

646
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:06,564
what's behind them
before they're open.

647
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:09,969
We are not getting into
the next quadrant through here.

648
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:13,372
We're gonna have to double back.

649
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,639
Oh, God.

650
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:17,542
Uh... Guys, look.

651
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:22,248
Crush them! That's the only
way to stop them!

652
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:32,091
Ah! Help!

653
00:35:32,158 --> 00:35:33,092
[gasping]

654
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,461
Ah! Help me!

655
00:35:35,528 --> 00:35:36,561
Help get this off me!

656
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:38,563
Help, help me!
Help!

657
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:43,936
Ow!

658
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:45,371
- Come on, get up! Get up!
- They're still coming!

659
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:46,905
Hurry! Hurry!

660
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:52,577
Quick! Back in the theater!

661
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:54,180
[crying]

662
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,883
God Damn it!

663
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:15,733
Everyone get back!

664
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,305
[panting]

665
00:36:20,506 --> 00:36:22,074
Starfish!

666
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,477
- Oh!
- Ah!

667
00:36:24,543 --> 00:36:26,145
[screaming]

668
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,718
- Karen!
- Get back!

669
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:40,658
Oh, God, okay.
Karen, Karen, just stop!

670
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:41,961
Stop!

671
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,399
You have to crush
their radial nerve

672
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:50,236
along that ambulacral region.

673
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:52,138
Destroying the
central nervous

674
00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:54,140
seems like the only thing
that stops them.

675
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:56,075
That is crazy.

676
00:36:56,142 --> 00:36:58,410
That kind of starfish
isn't supposed

677
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:01,347
to survive outside of the water
for more than a couple minutes.

678
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:03,582
Water pumps through
its body, not blood.

679
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:05,850
They don't have any blood?

680
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,920
No, nor a brain,
not in the typical sense.

681
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:12,391
That species emits
a toxin usually harmless.

682
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:15,693
You get stung, there's some
minor vomiting at the worst,

683
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,896
but we can't take that risk.

684
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:19,932
With this lockdown,
no one will be able

685
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:22,667
to get here on time
to save your life!

686
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:25,037
That octopus that escaped...

687
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:27,940
Also secretes a venom.
All octopi do.

688
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:29,807
They're mostly non-toxic,

689
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:32,645
except for the blue-ringed,
which is lethal.

690
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,548
Is that a blue-ringed one?

691
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:36,748
No.

692
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:38,850
And that's what worries me.

693
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:41,920
Dr. Hyde was bitten and
died from acute paralysis,

694
00:37:41,987 --> 00:37:44,223
probably within minutes.

695
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,358
Whatever's happening
to these animals

696
00:37:46,425 --> 00:37:49,094
is also making
their secretions more potent.

697
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:51,931
Okay, what is happening to them?

698
00:37:51,997 --> 00:37:53,399
They're dead.

699
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:57,236
But not dead.

700
00:37:57,303 --> 00:37:58,470
Huh?

701
00:37:59,672 --> 00:38:01,574
The toxicity of the octopus

702
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,376
must have been spread across
the aquarium like a virus.

703
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:08,380
Look, I don't think
we're gonna have enough time.

704
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:10,382
We just need to keep moving.

705
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:12,451
But Clu is trying to get us
out of here, right?

706
00:38:12,518 --> 00:38:14,386
Yeah, but after
the last three times,

707
00:38:14,453 --> 00:38:17,223
I don't think
it's gonna be quick enough.

708
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:21,961
We could try the roof.

709
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:24,396
There is a door...
There's an access door there.

710
00:38:24,463 --> 00:38:26,864
Yeah. Yeah, we go
where there's no water, right?

711
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:30,035
We go to the roof
and we call for help.

712
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:32,338
And maybe somebody
from the street will see us.

713
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:34,173
Maybe, yeah.

714
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:36,342
There it is.

715
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:39,877
[sighs]

716
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,347
I'm pretty sure it's locked.

717
00:38:41,413 --> 00:38:43,115
No, no.
I come down here all the time.

718
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:44,882
It just needs
a little elbow grease.

719
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,018
- Need some help?
- I got it.

720
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:47,453
You sure about that?

721
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,388
Dude, I work out all the time.

722
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:50,522
Okay, He-man.

723
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,125
Hey, what's that over there?

724
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,035
I loosened it for you.

725
00:39:03,102 --> 00:39:05,738
Sometimes it takes brains,
not always brawn.

726
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,140
Dude, so uncalled for.

727
00:39:19,118 --> 00:39:20,519
Those crabs had it out for you.

728
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:22,121
Yeah.

729
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:25,457
I think they know they're
not my favorite exhibit.

730
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:27,993
I guess I'm getting
the real tour now, huh?

731
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,030
Dude, I think you
are getting a refund.

732
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,398
Hey, this doesn't
lead outside, does it?

733
00:39:32,464 --> 00:39:34,433
No, no.
It's like a bunker.

734
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,337
Half the park and
the aquarium are above us.

735
00:39:38,404 --> 00:39:39,837
Great. We can stay
down here, right?

736
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:41,674
Absofrickinglutely!

737
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,043
Good. Where's the bathroom?
I'm about to piss my pants.

738
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:45,778
I think I already did.

739
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:47,112
It's down to your left.

740
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:01,960
Ah...

741
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,762
I'm still not seeing anything.

742
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:05,030
I still get the same recording.

743
00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:06,465
Maybe the phones
are down in there.

744
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:13,439
Well, what do you want to do?

745
00:40:13,505 --> 00:40:15,107
Dispatch just sent me
a number for

746
00:40:15,174 --> 00:40:17,909
the security manager for
this place...

747
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:19,011
Cluwirth.

748
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:20,412
I'll give her a call.

749
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:27,686
Let's go.
Let's go check it out.

750
00:40:27,753 --> 00:40:29,388
Well, let's do one more
sweep and we'll call it.

751
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:31,056
- Let's do it.
- All right.

752
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:34,859
Clu?

753
00:40:34,926 --> 00:40:36,462
Clu, hello?
Are you there?

754
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:38,997
Clu, talk to me.

755
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:40,466
Miranda, I'm here.

756
00:40:40,532 --> 00:40:42,668
<i>Are you okay?</i>

757
00:40:42,735 --> 00:40:44,236
You're not hurt, are you?

758
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:46,372
Clu, what is your status?
How bad is it up there?

759
00:40:46,438 --> 00:40:48,774
It's bad.

760
00:40:48,841 --> 00:40:50,642
The whole top of the desk

761
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:54,246
is covered with grease
or slime, I guess.

762
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:56,014
I think the octopus
left it here.

763
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:03,455
Okay, Clu, be very,
very careful if it comes back.

764
00:41:03,522 --> 00:41:05,691
There's something
happening to the animals.

765
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:08,827
They're everywhere
and they're attacking.

766
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:11,497
Ask her how to get out of here.

767
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,434
Listen, Clu, we're in
the Theater Box Office.

768
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:17,269
Do you know the quickest
way to get out of here?

769
00:41:17,336 --> 00:41:19,138
And what's
working and what isn't?

770
00:41:19,204 --> 00:41:21,306
At the moment, no, I don't.

771
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:25,244
It's gonna take maybe
half an hour at the least,

772
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,279
maybe more, to repair the desk.

773
00:41:29,914 --> 00:41:35,020
But at the time, I have
no operational capability.

774
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:36,488
A half hour?

775
00:41:39,091 --> 00:41:42,227
Would somebody please
tell me why this desk

776
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,630
means so much to us
getting out of the aquarium?

777
00:41:44,696 --> 00:41:48,100
Because without it,
we're not getting out of here.

778
00:41:51,103 --> 00:41:53,338
That console monitors
all of the security

779
00:41:53,405 --> 00:41:56,575
and all of the surveillance
on the entire property

780
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,111
which regulates and
overrides anything

781
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:01,914
that is triggered
in the unlikely event

782
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,949
a tank is breached.

783
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:05,217
Wonderful.

784
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:08,353
Clu, do we have any roof access?

785
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,489
What about getting
out from there?

786
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:15,093
Uh, no go.

787
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,629
Access to the roof
is on the same locking mechanism

788
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:18,664
as the steel doors.

789
00:42:23,135 --> 00:42:25,170
In the meantime,
if you all are in the theater,

790
00:42:25,237 --> 00:42:26,972
that puts you in Quad Two.

791
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,407
Now those doors
aren't designed

792
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:30,375
to keep out flooding,
only fires.

793
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:32,144
So I wouldn't go back
in the Box Office

794
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:33,846
because if the water
gets through, you're all

795
00:42:33,912 --> 00:42:36,281
going to keep on moving
until it's safely to do so.

796
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,617
- Copy?
- Copy that.

797
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:42,187
<i>Be careful out there.</i>

798
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:44,923
- Marvelous.
- We'll keep moving

799
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,592
and check back with you later.

800
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:47,726
Gotcha.

801
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:51,263
Oh, yeah.

802
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,232
This scar's gonna get me laid.

803
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:55,534
Man, this place is rank.

804
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:56,970
Pretty sure you guys
didn't pass health code.

805
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:59,471
Yeah.

806
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:01,707
So why a nurse?

807
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:03,876
Why not doctor,
you know, make the cash?

808
00:43:03,943 --> 00:43:06,311
Really?

809
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:07,713
Why a middle-aged tour guide

810
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:09,448
and not the executive
running the joint?

811
00:43:09,515 --> 00:43:11,149
Middle-aged?

812
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:13,418
I am younger than I look.

813
00:43:13,485 --> 00:43:16,956
Besides, management
just isn't for me.

814
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:19,558
The Shining Sea Aquarium
is not my life.

815
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:20,592
I got plans.

816
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:22,528
Plans, huh? Really?

817
00:43:22,594 --> 00:43:23,662
[clattering]

818
00:43:24,763 --> 00:43:27,032
Aw, damn!

819
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:28,767
Not those spider crabs again!

820
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:33,105
Okay, okay. I think we need
to move up into the aquarium.

821
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:35,207
Up in the aquarium?
Look, I can't swim.

822
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:36,976
The aquarium,
not the fish tanks.

823
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:38,744
What's the difference?

824
00:43:42,047 --> 00:43:43,983
Okay, get your phone out.

825
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:45,250
Why? You trying to
take a picture?

826
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:46,585
We can use it
as a flashlight.

827
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:48,120
Look, I know!
I was making a joke!

828
00:43:48,186 --> 00:43:49,621
Your humor is
really dry sometimes.

829
00:43:49,688 --> 00:43:51,623
Look, man, this better not
be leading back outside.

830
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,759
This is gonna lead us
to the aquarium.

831
00:43:53,825 --> 00:43:54,826
With the sharks?

832
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:55,861
Yes, with the sharks!

833
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:57,696
They're in tanks!

834
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,264
[growling]

835
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:00,866
Will you hold still?

836
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:02,301
Look, I'm trying!

837
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:06,238
Go, go.

838
00:44:06,305 --> 00:44:07,606
Okay, look.

839
00:44:07,673 --> 00:44:10,742
All we have to do is
go down this hall

840
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:12,511
and there's a staircase,
all right?

841
00:44:12,578 --> 00:44:14,880
So we're just gonna
move to this real fast.

842
00:44:14,948 --> 00:44:16,248
And then we're gonna climb up

843
00:44:16,315 --> 00:44:18,083
and we're gonna be
in the aquarium.

844
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,451
In the aquarium
with the shark tanks?

845
00:44:19,518 --> 00:44:21,453
Yes, that are in tanks.

846
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,221
Okay?

847
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:25,357
After you.

848
00:44:27,826 --> 00:44:30,228
Shh!

849
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:32,966
Let's just go, let's just go,
let's go, go, go, go, go.

850
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:34,000
Shh!

851
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:36,234
[growling]

852
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:37,336
- Did you hear it?
- Yes, of course I heard it!

853
00:44:37,402 --> 00:44:38,837
You are freaking me out, buddy!

854
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:40,272
Just keep it together!

855
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:41,975
What you scared for?
You got the ax!

856
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,141
Will you please?

857
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,576
I'm behind you with nothing!

858
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:46,211
No armor, you already
messed up my face!

859
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:48,680
I am a professional!
We go at this slowly!

860
00:44:53,118 --> 00:44:54,353
There.

861
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:01,126
And be smart out there, too.

862
00:45:01,193 --> 00:45:02,594
Copy that.

863
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:12,738
Miranda, come look at this.

864
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:17,876
This starfish has
cutaneous abrasions

865
00:45:17,944 --> 00:45:22,081
and tissue decay consistent
with the onset

866
00:45:22,147 --> 00:45:25,617
of marine epizootic
similar to SSWS.

867
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,455
But there's nothing
to presently support

868
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,959
any possibility
of densovirus infection.

869
00:45:33,026 --> 00:45:35,293
Well, I haven't noticed
any limb impairment

870
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,828
or limited mobility.

871
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,065
But I'm not ruling out
bacterial contamination.

872
00:45:39,132 --> 00:45:40,265
Yeah.

873
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:44,636
[gasps]

874
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:45,437
Jesus!

875
00:45:45,504 --> 00:45:47,073
You said that was dead!

876
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,342
You crushed its nervous system!

877
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:52,711
Dead, but not dead.

878
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:01,020
We're dealing with
a reanimated specimen.

879
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:02,287
What?

880
00:46:04,222 --> 00:46:06,092
Hey, Clu? Clu?

881
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:07,759
If you can hear me, stay clear.

882
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:11,663
And I mean,
stay clear of any wildlife.

883
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,299
<i>And do not touch
any of the slime.</i>

884
00:46:14,366 --> 00:46:16,668
No. No way am I touching
that slime.

885
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:19,738
And I'm not going anywhere.
We need to find a way out.

886
00:46:19,805 --> 00:46:22,207
If anything pops its head up
in here that doesn't belong,

887
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:23,709
it's gonna wish that it hadn't.

888
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:26,244
We might be dealing
with something viral,

889
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:28,714
something reanimated.

890
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,450
<i>We've never seen
anything like this</i>

891
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:33,752
and it could be contagious.

892
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:36,421
And we really don't
know what's causing it.

893
00:46:36,488 --> 00:46:39,158
I'm gonna try to get
these cameras up and running

894
00:46:39,224 --> 00:46:41,160
so that can get you a
little bit more visibility.

895
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:42,995
<i>I don't like you all
running around blindly</i>

896
00:46:43,062 --> 00:46:44,830
<i>without knowing
what's around the corner.</i>

897
00:46:44,896 --> 00:46:47,066
<i>Especially because
we're not exactly sure</i>

898
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:48,667
<i>what we're up against.</i>

899
00:46:48,734 --> 00:46:51,070
Thank you, Clu.
We'll keep moving.

900
00:46:51,137 --> 00:46:53,172
I'll check back with you later.

901
00:46:53,238 --> 00:46:54,740
Copy that.

902
00:46:57,242 --> 00:46:58,410
Let's see what we got.

903
00:47:00,113 --> 00:47:02,514
Come on.
Give me something!

904
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:09,921
Okay, I'm gonna get
you guys out of here,

905
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:11,057
but I need to find a map.

906
00:47:11,124 --> 00:47:12,357
Come help me find one.

907
00:47:14,926 --> 00:47:17,130
Yes...

908
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:18,396
No.

909
00:47:19,364 --> 00:47:21,366
Oh, I found some!

910
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:23,902
Okay, there's gotta be
another way

911
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,538
that I haven't thought of to get
out of here or crawl out of.

912
00:47:29,976 --> 00:47:32,677
I didn't realize
how huge this place was.

913
00:47:32,744 --> 00:47:34,813
Hey man, are you
feeling all right?

914
00:47:36,082 --> 00:47:38,050
Yes, I just need to...

915
00:47:38,117 --> 00:47:40,318
sit down for a moment.

916
00:47:40,385 --> 00:47:41,753
[panting]

917
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:47,026
Oh... oh, yeah.

918
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:54,934
What are you smiling at?

919
00:47:56,135 --> 00:47:58,336
Oh, I don't feel so good.

920
00:47:58,403 --> 00:47:59,838
Hey! Focus!

921
00:47:59,905 --> 00:48:01,573
I really feel like
I'm gonna pass out.

922
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,109
Hey, you lost
a lot of blood, man.

923
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:04,376
Oh...

924
00:48:04,442 --> 00:48:05,544
Hey, hey, hey!
Stay with me now.

925
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,180
Hey, I'll be right back.

926
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:08,613
Okay.

927
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:10,715
Where'd he go?

928
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,856
Hey. Here.
You gotta drink this.

929
00:48:22,427 --> 00:48:23,963
Drink, you got to drink it!

930
00:48:32,138 --> 00:48:33,538
[grunts]

931
00:48:34,606 --> 00:48:37,576
You... You saved
my life back there.

932
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:39,811
Yeah. Don't mention it.
I gotta bandage you up.

933
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:43,715
[grunts]

934
00:48:46,152 --> 00:48:48,653
Hey, hey.

935
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,523
Thank you for not
leaving me behind, man.

936
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:52,992
You're a tour guide.

937
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:54,359
How else am I gonna
get out of this place?

938
00:48:55,094 --> 00:48:56,394
Hey, I just remembered!

939
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:57,930
What?

940
00:48:57,997 --> 00:48:59,364
There's another door
hidden from the public.

941
00:48:59,431 --> 00:49:01,499
Seriously?
Is that one locked, too?

942
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:02,567
Go find out.

943
00:49:02,634 --> 00:49:04,136
You wanna show me?

944
00:49:04,203 --> 00:49:06,404
No. I want to wait for the crabs
to come back, of course.

945
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:10,176
Jacked up my knee.

946
00:49:10,243 --> 00:49:12,811
You're a tough guy.
You can shake it off.

947
00:49:12,878 --> 00:49:15,047
Ah!

948
00:49:15,114 --> 00:49:16,048
Gimme that.

949
00:49:16,115 --> 00:49:17,682
For what?

950
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:19,517
I'm still the tour guide.

951
00:49:29,996 --> 00:49:33,865
Yeah, Dispatch.
No hot spots, no people.

952
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:35,767
Place is empty.

953
00:49:35,834 --> 00:49:37,502
There's another
outage at the aquarium.

954
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:41,007
Something's gotta
be going on.

955
00:49:41,073 --> 00:49:42,174
10-4. Copy that.

956
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:43,042
[growling]

957
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:44,243
You hear that?

958
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,311
- What?
- Shh!

959
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:46,312
You wanna feed the sharks?

960
00:49:46,379 --> 00:49:48,381
Shh!

961
00:49:48,446 --> 00:49:49,282
[screaming]

962
00:49:49,348 --> 00:49:50,515
- Oh!
- What?

963
00:49:50,582 --> 00:49:52,484
That's a crocodile!

964
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,619
Dispatch! We got people
running around in there!

965
00:49:54,686 --> 00:49:56,922
Animals are loose!
We gotta get them out!

966
00:49:56,989 --> 00:50:00,259
No. Stay where you are.
Wait for Animal Control. Copy?

967
00:50:00,326 --> 00:50:01,626
Negative! No!

968
00:50:01,693 --> 00:50:03,396
We need to get them
out right now!

969
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:05,463
We have a citywide grid outage.

970
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,967
- How long?
- 60 minutes.

971
00:50:08,034 --> 00:50:10,403
With any luck,
we can get there in 45.

972
00:50:10,468 --> 00:50:11,903
We've gotta find a way in there!

973
00:50:13,605 --> 00:50:15,942
This is not how I planned
to spend my birthday.

974
00:50:16,008 --> 00:50:18,010
You should have
gotten a girlfriend.

975
00:50:18,077 --> 00:50:20,645
Well, maybe I thought the tour
guide was gonna be a girl.

976
00:50:20,712 --> 00:50:23,082
Says the guy named Skylar.

977
00:50:23,149 --> 00:50:24,083
You know what...

978
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,617
[growling]

979
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:27,053
What was that?

980
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,593
Ah!

981
00:50:36,395 --> 00:50:37,529
[growling]

982
00:50:40,598 --> 00:50:42,234
[screaming]

983
00:50:45,438 --> 00:50:50,376
Okay, so the sea lion habitat
is both indoor and outdoor.

984
00:50:50,443 --> 00:50:55,247
There is a chute that we can go
down and kind of glob back up.

985
00:50:55,314 --> 00:50:56,415
It's about 15 feet.

986
00:50:56,481 --> 00:50:58,650
So then we climb out?

987
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:01,786
Well, the only problem
is that sea lion habitat

988
00:51:01,853 --> 00:51:03,555
is in Quadrant One.

989
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:06,993
We are in Quadrant Two

990
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:10,695
and the fire doors
are shut very tight.

991
00:51:12,465 --> 00:51:15,434
So if we can figure out a way
to get through the quadrant,

992
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,403
we can get out.

993
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,505
So is that it?
Is that our plan?

994
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:21,706
That's the plan.

995
00:51:23,742 --> 00:51:27,712
But we can't let any of these
animals get out to the public.

996
00:51:27,779 --> 00:51:30,116
We can't even imagine the damage

997
00:51:30,182 --> 00:51:33,219
and destruction that
would occur as a result.

998
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:34,487
Well, we can barricade them.

999
00:51:34,552 --> 00:51:36,155
We can wedge it
from the outside.

1000
00:51:36,222 --> 00:51:39,758
I just hope the octopus
doesn't get the same idea.

1001
00:51:39,824 --> 00:51:42,028
It's already killed two people

1002
00:51:42,094 --> 00:51:44,230
and it's probably still
on the move in the ducts.

1003
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,099
Wait.

1004
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:49,301
Does the octopus still
have the telemetry tag?

1005
00:51:49,368 --> 00:51:51,736
Is it still in there?
Is it still active?

1006
00:51:51,803 --> 00:51:53,872
We never had a chance
to bring it online.

1007
00:51:53,939 --> 00:51:57,675
But I could log on to the
network and initiate the signal.

1008
00:51:57,742 --> 00:51:59,245
Okay, yes.

1009
00:51:59,311 --> 00:52:01,981
Oh, damn it!
I don't have my phone.

1010
00:52:02,048 --> 00:52:04,649
That's the only way to track it.

1011
00:52:04,716 --> 00:52:07,953
Everything else is down.

1012
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:08,920
Okay.

1013
00:52:08,988 --> 00:52:11,490
So we'll go get your phone.

1014
00:52:11,556 --> 00:52:14,994
We'll call 911, we'll turn
on and activate the tag.

1015
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:16,761
And we'll make sure that
it's not going anywhere.

1016
00:52:16,828 --> 00:52:18,964
And then we will get to
the sea lion habitat.

1017
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:22,001
We have to hurry or we'll
be doing this in the dark.

1018
00:52:22,068 --> 00:52:24,103
The only reason some of
the lights are still on

1019
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,738
is because of our
backup generators.

1020
00:52:26,805 --> 00:52:29,041
But who knows how long
that will last.

1021
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:31,444
Okay?

1022
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,710
That's the plan.

1023
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:52,597
[sighs]

1024
00:52:53,466 --> 00:52:54,967
Okay?

1025
00:52:55,034 --> 00:52:55,834
Now what?

1026
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,169
Well, we have two options.

1027
00:52:57,236 --> 00:53:00,940
We can either go this way
or that way.

1028
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:04,143
And that way is flooded, so...

1029
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,545
So that's not an option,
so we're going this way.

1030
00:53:06,611 --> 00:53:08,013
Great.

1031
00:53:10,216 --> 00:53:11,083
I have an idea.

1032
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,085
I have an idea, I have an idea.

1033
00:53:17,356 --> 00:53:18,857
This is the Educational Lab.

1034
00:53:18,923 --> 00:53:20,792
It's been under construction
for a few weeks.

1035
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:22,861
There's been flooding
in here, too.

1036
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,041
You weren't kidding.

1037
00:53:36,108 --> 00:53:37,576
No.

1038
00:53:37,642 --> 00:53:40,479
We have to crawl through the
ceiling to get to the fire door.

1039
00:53:40,546 --> 00:53:44,116
It's the only way we'll get
to the sea lion habitat.

1040
00:53:44,183 --> 00:53:46,519
Okay.
There you go.

1041
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:47,685
I got it.

1042
00:53:47,752 --> 00:53:49,821
Thank you.

1043
00:53:49,888 --> 00:53:52,391
Okay, so you guys
need to go first.

1044
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,826
And then Dr. James and
I will follow behind you.

1045
00:53:57,563 --> 00:53:59,031
Okay.

1046
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:02,067
Careful, Bailey.

1047
00:54:06,372 --> 00:54:09,408
So how far are
we supposed to go?

1048
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:12,777
The Marine Science Gallery, it's
got a different color carpet.

1049
00:54:12,844 --> 00:54:13,946
So when you
look down through the panel,

1050
00:54:14,013 --> 00:54:15,281
you'll be able to see that.

1051
00:54:15,347 --> 00:54:19,185
And then just
drop down in there.

1052
00:54:19,251 --> 00:54:21,086
Okay.

1053
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:22,854
Different color carpet.
Got it.

1054
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:29,094
Uh, I don't know
about this...

1055
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:30,862
Okay, well,
unfortunately,

1056
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,164
it's the only
option that we have, okay?

1057
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:32,965
Mm-hm.

1058
00:54:33,032 --> 00:54:34,333
Just give me your hand.

1059
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,833
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

1060
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,969
Do you want me
to hold your binder?

1061
00:54:37,036 --> 00:54:38,237
Oh, no, no.
I have this.

1062
00:54:38,304 --> 00:54:39,104
Okay.

1063
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:41,307
Okay, Karen, let's go.

1064
00:54:41,373 --> 00:54:42,408
Okay.

1065
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:55,321
I cannot believe you
lost our phones!

1066
00:54:55,387 --> 00:54:57,089
I don't like this.

1067
00:54:57,156 --> 00:54:58,723
I don't like this at all.

1068
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,960
Oh, God.
Oh, I want to get down.

1069
00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:03,429
I really...
Okay, I've got to get down.

1070
00:55:03,495 --> 00:55:07,533
Beth, it's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1071
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,034
Just look for another vent.

1072
00:55:13,905 --> 00:55:15,407
Are you guys okay?

1073
00:55:15,474 --> 00:55:17,276
Where's Dr. James?

1074
00:55:17,343 --> 00:55:20,079
She took a different route.
She's gonna meet us there.

1075
00:55:20,145 --> 00:55:21,013
What?

1076
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,248
She's gonna meet us there!

1077
00:55:22,314 --> 00:55:23,415
Oh, my God.

1078
00:55:23,482 --> 00:55:24,416
Just keep going.

1079
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:25,684
Okay.

1080
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,353
Just a little bit
more to the left.

1081
00:55:27,419 --> 00:55:29,955
This is insane.

1082
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:32,324
I cancelled a 12 PM lunch
for this.

1083
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:34,526
Actually sir, they had
already cancelled last week.

1084
00:55:34,593 --> 00:55:35,860
I just felt like you needed
something that was

1085
00:55:35,927 --> 00:55:38,830
giving back to the community.

1086
00:55:38,896 --> 00:55:42,134
We do appreciate your support.

1087
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:45,971
Beth, remind me to fire you
when we get out of this mess.

1088
00:55:56,848 --> 00:55:58,183
Okay, come on.

1089
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,685
It's safe down here.
I went.

1090
00:55:59,752 --> 00:56:01,387
Oh! Okay.

1091
00:56:02,154 --> 00:56:03,722
Okay, is anything down there?

1092
00:56:03,788 --> 00:56:05,024
- No! You're fine.
- Are you sure?

1093
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,091
- You're fine.
- Okay.

1094
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:10,862
- Come on.
- [whimpers]

1095
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:12,131
Take this.
Stand right here.

1096
00:56:12,197 --> 00:56:13,532
Careful.

1097
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:14,767
Got it?

1098
00:56:14,832 --> 00:56:16,535
I guess you got it.

1099
00:56:16,602 --> 00:56:17,970
All right.
This way.

1100
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:24,310
What is that?

1101
00:56:24,376 --> 00:56:26,911
Crabs! Run!

1102
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,748
Oh!

1103
00:56:29,814 --> 00:56:30,683
- Sorry.
- Crabs!

1104
00:56:30,749 --> 00:56:33,885
Crabs, crabs!

1105
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:35,254
You're alive!

1106
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:39,091
Ah!

1107
00:56:56,442 --> 00:56:57,909
Crab legs, anyone?

1108
00:57:00,012 --> 00:57:01,714
Uh, we're not far
from the Veterinary.

1109
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,982
I can go get my phone.

1110
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:05,184
I'll go with you.

1111
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,252
Wait, wait, wait!
Be careful!

1112
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:08,587
There was a crocodile
coming after us!

1113
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:10,255
We have no idea where he is.

1114
00:57:10,322 --> 00:57:11,423
[growling]

1115
00:57:14,326 --> 00:57:16,061
We should probably go with them.

1116
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:17,396
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1117
00:57:26,305 --> 00:57:28,340
Oh my God!

1118
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:29,541
Joe!

1119
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:33,445
No. He's gone.

1120
00:57:33,512 --> 00:57:34,879
Oh my God.

1121
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:42,621
This is just like the syringe
I used on the octopus!

1122
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:46,959
Whatever is in there needs
to be out of the lab

1123
00:57:47,025 --> 00:57:48,627
into quarantine to study.

1124
00:57:51,663 --> 00:57:54,299
Oh, my God, E.Z.

1125
00:57:54,366 --> 00:57:56,235
Eden Zoo!

1126
00:57:57,269 --> 00:57:59,171
I thought that was destroyed.

1127
00:57:59,238 --> 00:58:01,507
There was a disposal order.

1128
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,177
Daniel told me he burned them.

1129
00:58:11,483 --> 00:58:13,918
That theory is totally
wacked, Miranda.

1130
00:58:13,986 --> 00:58:16,221
There has to be a
normal, logical,

1131
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:18,457
scientific reason
why this happened.

1132
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:21,326
Then why did Dr. Rogers tell us
to get rid of the injectors?

1133
00:58:21,393 --> 00:58:23,195
Bad lots happen all the time.

1134
00:58:23,262 --> 00:58:24,696
And I told you
I got rid of them.

1135
00:58:24,763 --> 00:58:26,665
I don't know.
Maybe Logistics screwed up

1136
00:58:26,732 --> 00:58:28,600
and one of them mixed in
with the stable lot.

1137
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:31,170
My phone, the signal
isn't coming through.

1138
00:58:31,236 --> 00:58:34,306
I mean, I can't even
open the app

1139
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:36,508
to register the telemetry tag
on the octopus.

1140
00:58:36,575 --> 00:58:38,577
It may be this
fiberglass insulation.

1141
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:40,212
We get dead spots all the time
at the hospital.

1142
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:43,248
Happens a lot in
these older buildings.

1143
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:47,152
Okay, well, we just need
to keep moving, okay?

1144
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:49,221
I need to talk to you right now.

1145
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:53,358
You told me that you
burned the Eden supply.

1146
00:58:53,425 --> 00:58:54,927
You told me you destroyed it.

1147
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:57,062
I did. I had it arranged
and everything.

1148
00:58:57,129 --> 00:59:00,332
So how do you explain
these syringes?

1149
00:59:02,868 --> 00:59:04,203
I don't know, Miranda.

1150
00:59:04,269 --> 00:59:05,637
I did my job, though.

1151
00:59:05,704 --> 00:59:07,272
There's a disposal order
in the office.

1152
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:08,307
You want me to risk my life
and go there

1153
00:59:08,373 --> 00:59:09,508
and bring it back for you?

1154
00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:10,944
No.

1155
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,412
After this is all over,
I will find out what happened.

1156
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:16,048
So if you want to talk to me
about anything that you know,

1157
00:59:16,114 --> 00:59:18,450
you tell me right now.

1158
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:22,454
I'm telling you
I don't know anything.

1159
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:26,191
[scoffs]

1160
00:59:27,793 --> 00:59:29,561
This is an aquarium!

1161
00:59:29,628 --> 00:59:31,630
What if one of the animals got
loose 'cause a tank got busted?

1162
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:34,600
It would kill the phone lines.
It'd kill the power.

1163
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:35,935
Hell, it even triggered
the alarm

1164
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:37,169
without a fire being around!

1165
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:38,337
How many gallons
are in this place?

1166
00:59:38,403 --> 00:59:39,872
Hundreds of thousands.

1167
00:59:39,939 --> 00:59:41,907
If just one of those tanks
sprung a small leak,

1168
00:59:41,975 --> 00:59:44,409
they could be up
to their knees in it!

1169
00:59:44,476 --> 00:59:46,578
Forget that! Come on!
Let's take the stairs!

1170
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:47,613
Forget the stairs!

1171
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,384
I got this!

1172
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:57,656
Hey! I got it!

1173
00:59:59,758 --> 01:00:01,260
Hey!

1174
01:00:14,606 --> 01:00:15,574
[growling]

1175
01:00:17,376 --> 01:00:18,377
Oh!

1176
01:00:18,443 --> 01:00:20,245
Oh, shit!

1177
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:33,659
Ah!

1178
01:00:37,663 --> 01:00:39,364
Ah!

1179
01:00:39,431 --> 01:00:40,365
Oh, sh...

1180
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:45,137
Oh, my God!

1181
01:00:45,203 --> 01:00:47,306
Oh my God!
Are you okay?

1182
01:00:47,372 --> 01:00:48,307
What was that thing?

1183
01:00:48,373 --> 01:00:49,708
I don't know.

1184
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:51,176
Next time, I'm taking
the stairs.

1185
01:00:58,917 --> 01:00:59,851
Come on.

1186
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:10,095
Almost there...

1187
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:23,076
What in the hell
were you thinking?

1188
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,409
Rigging that tank to break

1189
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:25,911
while Beth and I
were in the premises?

1190
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:27,112
What's gotten into you?

1191
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:28,113
It wasn't me!

1192
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,182
What do you mean?

1193
01:01:30,248 --> 01:01:32,384
I only lied about burning
the bad doses

1194
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:33,987
to sabotage the
Veterinary clinic.

1195
01:01:34,053 --> 01:01:36,321
I was waiting to rig the tank
until you two left.

1196
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:37,723
I'm not an idiot!

1197
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,660
Uh, Daniel.

1198
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:44,129
Is that what I think it is?

1199
01:01:44,196 --> 01:01:45,864
Oh, my God.

1200
01:01:49,568 --> 01:01:52,038
Okay, we can just
turn back and...

1201
01:01:52,105 --> 01:01:54,873
- Oh!
- Oh, shit.

1202
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,579
Now what?

1203
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:05,217
I think they're communicating!

1204
01:02:05,283 --> 01:02:07,319
Yeah, but it's different.

1205
01:02:07,386 --> 01:02:09,921
It's new, it's louder
and more urgent.

1206
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:12,624
It's a strange signal.

1207
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:14,626
It's like they
can't see each other,

1208
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:16,328
like they're blind or something.

1209
01:02:16,395 --> 01:02:18,864
No. Not today, not today!
I'm not dying today!

1210
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:22,434
- Skylar!
- Skylar, no, no, no!

1211
01:02:23,936 --> 01:02:26,271
Skylar, no!

1212
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:28,907
Ah!

1213
01:02:40,153 --> 01:02:44,256
Ooh, look at all this!

1214
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,328
Miranda?

1215
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:52,197
Come back.
Checking in.

1216
01:02:52,264 --> 01:02:55,267
How's everyone doing out there?

1217
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:58,637
Miranda?
Come in!

1218
01:02:58,704 --> 01:02:59,838
Miranda!

1219
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:03,642
[growling]

1220
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:09,949
Everyone, stay completely quiet.

1221
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:32,071
Oh, God.
That was close.

1222
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:33,505
[growling]

1223
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:40,779
Everybody, quick. Hide!

1224
01:03:40,846 --> 01:03:42,380
Stay out of its path
and stay quiet.

1225
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:43,815
What are you gonna do, Karen?

1226
01:03:43,882 --> 01:03:46,085
Just shut up and go.
Everybody go. Go.

1227
01:03:46,152 --> 01:03:48,353
No, Karen! No!

1228
01:03:50,223 --> 01:03:53,658
Come on, work! Record!

1229
01:03:53,725 --> 01:03:57,329
Species showing evidence
of complete blindness,

1230
01:03:57,395 --> 01:03:59,831
eyes milky white.

1231
01:03:59,898 --> 01:04:03,635
Exhibiting behaviors consistent
with complete loss of vision

1232
01:04:03,702 --> 01:04:06,005
through form of improvised
communication

1233
01:04:06,072 --> 01:04:07,506
with one another.

1234
01:04:07,572 --> 01:04:11,543
Hunting patterns dependent
solely

1235
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:14,846
on locating its prey
through sound!

1236
01:04:14,913 --> 01:04:18,151
<i>...blindness...
eyes milky white.</i>

1237
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:22,621
<i>Exhibiting behaviors consistent
with total loss of vision</i>

1238
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:25,924
<i>through form of improvised
communication with one another.</i>

1239
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:30,529
<i>Hunting patterns

1240
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:33,465
<i>upon locating their

1241
01:04:35,234 --> 01:04:37,937
<i>...of complete blindness,

1242
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:42,440
<i>Exhibiting behaviors consistent

1243
01:04:42,507 --> 01:04:44,309
<i>through form of imp...</i>

1244
01:04:48,446 --> 01:04:49,447
A door.

1245
01:04:49,514 --> 01:04:51,316
Come on, come on, come on!

1246
01:04:56,721 --> 01:04:57,856
Damn it!

1247
01:04:57,923 --> 01:04:58,857
It's locked!

1248
01:05:01,294 --> 01:05:04,030
Miranda?
You there?

1249
01:05:04,096 --> 01:05:05,164
Go ahead, Clu.

1250
01:05:05,231 --> 01:05:07,033
The desk is back online.

1251
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:08,767
I've got some cameras
up as well.

1252
01:05:08,834 --> 01:05:12,238
So it's a good news
and bad news situation.

1253
01:05:12,305 --> 01:05:13,839
What news do you want first?

1254
01:05:13,905 --> 01:05:17,009
I think we could all use
a little good news right now.

1255
01:05:17,076 --> 01:05:18,476
Okay, good news it is.

1256
01:05:18,543 --> 01:05:21,346
The desk is allowing me
to override the lockdown

1257
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:23,782
and I've released
some of the exits.

1258
01:05:23,849 --> 01:05:25,084
And the bad?

1259
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:27,419
And the bad news is

1260
01:05:27,485 --> 01:05:29,921
the failsafe locking
mechanisms are electronic

1261
01:05:29,989 --> 01:05:32,691
and absolutely none
of them are responding.

1262
01:05:32,757 --> 01:05:35,660
So nothing or no
one is getting out of here

1263
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:38,097
unless those locks are powered.

1264
01:05:38,164 --> 01:05:40,432
Now I can override
those locks all day long.

1265
01:05:40,498 --> 01:05:43,135
But if there ain't no juice
getting to those electronics,

1266
01:05:43,202 --> 01:05:45,403
we are stuck like chuck.

1267
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:46,771
Copy.

1268
01:05:46,838 --> 01:05:48,307
So all the doors are
still locked.

1269
01:05:48,373 --> 01:05:50,408
How is she working
on the console

1270
01:05:50,475 --> 01:05:51,978
if this whole place
is out of power?

1271
01:05:52,044 --> 01:05:54,579
Because the console
has a backup battery.

1272
01:05:54,646 --> 01:05:57,283
It was the last thing
to get upgraded six years ago.

1273
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:59,885
<i>Everything is under water
in this place.</i>

1274
01:05:59,952 --> 01:06:02,787
I've tried to reroute the power
to the alternate generator.

1275
01:06:02,854 --> 01:06:05,057
But it just won't cycle over.

1276
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:08,894
It needs to
be switched on manually?

1277
01:06:08,961 --> 01:06:11,429
Yeah. If we don't do that,
then we're not gonna get out.

1278
01:06:11,496 --> 01:06:13,598
Hey, Clu.
We're in the sea lion habitat.

1279
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:15,567
Good. Then you're not far
from the breaker box,

1280
01:06:15,634 --> 01:06:17,702
but it's located
in the basement.

1281
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:18,737
Copy?

1282
01:06:18,803 --> 01:06:19,838
Copy.

1283
01:06:19,905 --> 01:06:21,073
The basement?

1284
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,574
Does she even know
what we went through to

1285
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:24,010
get from the fire door to here?

1286
01:06:24,076 --> 01:06:26,145
Who cares?
We know where we're going.

1287
01:06:26,212 --> 01:06:27,712
Let's get there.

1288
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:28,847
Okay.

1289
01:06:28,914 --> 01:06:30,216
The only way through
is the basement

1290
01:06:30,283 --> 01:06:31,816
and it's right by the stairs.

1291
01:06:31,883 --> 01:06:35,087
But we have to go through
the next exhibit next to us.

1292
01:06:37,156 --> 01:06:38,090
Super.

1293
01:06:39,925 --> 01:06:41,127
Why?

1294
01:06:41,193 --> 01:06:44,562
Because all the doors
are still locked! Jesus!

1295
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:45,864
So wait, wait.

1296
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:47,632
What exhibit are
we talking about?

1297
01:06:50,303 --> 01:06:51,603
Shark Cove.

1298
01:06:53,372 --> 01:06:54,806
You gotta be kidding.

1299
01:07:02,447 --> 01:07:03,848
- Come on, stay close.
- Oh, Jesus.

1300
01:07:04,916 --> 01:07:05,850
[growling]

1301
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,693
- Oh, shit.
- Everyone hide!

1302
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:38,985
It's clear.

1303
01:07:39,051 --> 01:07:40,852
Let's go.

1304
01:07:40,919 --> 01:07:41,519
Come on.

1305
01:07:41,586 --> 01:07:43,588
Whoa!

1306
01:07:44,991 --> 01:07:45,992
Shh!

1307
01:07:47,592 --> 01:07:50,196
Are they dead?

1308
01:07:50,262 --> 01:07:54,066
They're not moving, but they
are definitely not dead.

1309
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:55,867
This is the only way out.

1310
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:59,205
Okay, these...
These are Macos.

1311
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:01,040
There's only two of them.

1312
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:03,742
Where are the others?

1313
01:08:05,945 --> 01:08:08,747
What do you mean, the rest?

1314
01:08:08,813 --> 01:08:10,682
Hey, Miranda, there's the
stairwell

1315
01:08:10,749 --> 01:08:11,816
on the other end of the Gallery.

1316
01:08:11,883 --> 01:08:13,319
Maybe we go back that way.

1317
01:08:13,386 --> 01:08:15,154
Fuck this.

1318
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:18,857
I am going through to the other
side with or without you guys.

1319
01:08:18,923 --> 01:08:21,193
And then I'm having
this place condemned!

1320
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,660
Wait. What?

1321
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:24,230
I am getting to the other side
of this exhibit.

1322
01:08:24,296 --> 01:08:28,267
I am faster on my feet than
they are out of the water,

1323
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:29,402
I'll tell you that.

1324
01:08:29,468 --> 01:08:30,769
No, you can't just do that.

1325
01:08:30,835 --> 01:08:32,104
You can't just march
over there

1326
01:08:32,171 --> 01:08:33,638
and expect everything
to go well.

1327
01:08:33,705 --> 01:08:37,276
Okay, we should go
one by one, okay?

1328
01:08:37,343 --> 01:08:40,179
Okay, I'll go first.

1329
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:43,915
Make sure it's safe.

1330
01:08:43,983 --> 01:08:45,317
Okay.

1331
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:50,855
Oh, da...

1332
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,029
Ooh!

1333
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:03,269
Okay.

1334
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:12,911
Oh.

1335
01:09:12,978 --> 01:09:15,847
Okay, come on, guys.
Come on, guys.

1336
01:09:15,914 --> 01:09:17,882
Do I have a fever?

1337
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,751
Are you okay?
Are you sick?

1338
01:09:19,818 --> 01:09:24,023
I'm feeling really, really cold.

1339
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:25,657
Feels like you're burning up.

1340
01:09:25,723 --> 01:09:26,992
She's burning up.

1341
01:09:27,059 --> 01:09:29,594
- All right, watch me.
- Okay.

1342
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:31,297
Watch me do it.

1343
01:09:37,602 --> 01:09:39,038
Oh my... oh!

1344
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:41,873
Okay, good job.

1345
01:09:46,579 --> 01:09:47,712
[sighing]

1346
01:09:48,713 --> 01:09:50,516
Okay, come on back, come on.

1347
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:52,318
No.

1348
01:09:52,384 --> 01:09:55,187
You gotta go.
But you gotta go now.

1349
01:09:55,254 --> 01:09:56,754
- Come on!
- I can't, I can't.

1350
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:58,424
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1351
01:09:58,491 --> 01:10:00,625
- You guys, I can't, I'm sorry.
- Yes, you can.

1352
01:10:00,692 --> 01:10:01,994
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.

1353
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:03,795
Follow the leader, okay?
We can do this.

1354
01:10:03,862 --> 01:10:05,264
Follow the leader.

1355
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:06,966
Come on.
Come on over.

1356
01:10:07,032 --> 01:10:09,368
Follow the leader.
Follow the leader.

1357
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:17,543
There you go.
There you go.

1358
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,811
See? See?
You did it, you did it.

1359
01:10:19,878 --> 01:10:21,746
Okay, one more.

1360
01:10:21,813 --> 01:10:23,115
One more to go.

1361
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:30,422
Come on, come on.
There you go.

1362
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:35,427
There. There you go.
There you go.

1363
01:10:35,494 --> 01:10:36,395
Okay, come on, Karen.

1364
01:10:36,462 --> 01:10:37,762
Your turn.

1365
01:10:37,829 --> 01:10:39,064
- Oh, I don't know.
- You got it.

1366
01:10:39,131 --> 01:10:39,864
Come on.

1367
01:10:39,932 --> 01:10:42,501
I gotta get out of here.

1368
01:10:42,568 --> 01:10:44,303
Okay, okay.

1369
01:10:50,842 --> 01:10:51,709
Yes, yes, okay!

1370
01:10:51,776 --> 01:10:53,546
Oh, my God!

1371
01:10:53,612 --> 01:10:56,081
Just one more.
Just one more.

1372
01:10:56,148 --> 01:10:58,184
- You can do it, come on!
- You got it.

1373
01:11:02,921 --> 01:11:04,123
Behind you!

1374
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:06,724
The other shark, it's moving!

1375
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,693
Watch out!

1376
01:11:09,562 --> 01:11:11,796
Ah!

1377
01:11:11,863 --> 01:11:13,365
- Move!
- Jesus!

1378
01:11:13,432 --> 01:11:14,466
Help me!

1379
01:11:16,868 --> 01:11:19,804
Go, go, go!
Run, run!

1380
01:11:34,919 --> 01:11:36,255
[growling]

1381
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:39,425
[screams]

1382
01:11:39,491 --> 01:11:42,094
[screaming]

1383
01:11:44,063 --> 01:11:46,365
Give me your tie!
Give me your tie!

1384
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:50,936
[screaming]

1385
01:11:51,003 --> 01:11:52,404
It's okay, I got you.

1386
01:11:52,471 --> 01:11:55,074
- Hold on, hold on.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1387
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:57,610
There you go.
Can you walk?

1388
01:11:57,676 --> 01:12:00,845
I'm not gonna let you leave me
behind, that's for damn sure.

1389
01:12:00,912 --> 01:12:01,813
Okay, good.

1390
01:12:01,879 --> 01:12:03,415
Whoa! Whoa!

1391
01:12:03,482 --> 01:12:04,583
You okay?

1392
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:05,917
Yeah, thank you.

1393
01:12:09,722 --> 01:12:12,091
I'm so cold, I'm so cold.

1394
01:12:12,157 --> 01:12:13,791
Oh, my gosh, she's burning up.

1395
01:12:13,858 --> 01:12:15,194
Are you okay?

1396
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:16,794
Can you help me?

1397
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:20,399
I didn't want to say anything
as we had to go and move...

1398
01:12:26,305 --> 01:12:28,307
Oh, my God!

1399
01:12:28,374 --> 01:12:31,909
We need to get that
thing off of her now!

1400
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:34,546
- Get her back.
- I got you. I got you.

1401
01:12:34,613 --> 01:12:35,981
Okay, thank you.

1402
01:12:36,048 --> 01:12:37,449
- We got you.
- Thank you.

1403
01:12:37,516 --> 01:12:39,551
Oh, my God, it's
drinking her blood source.

1404
01:12:39,618 --> 01:12:41,620
Ow!

1405
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:42,955
- Okay.
- Beth, stay with us.

1406
01:12:43,022 --> 01:12:45,257
- Okay.
- Stay with me.

1407
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:47,326
Look at me.

1408
01:12:47,393 --> 01:12:48,460
Hey, hey, hey.

1409
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:51,063
Beth, stay with us!
Stay with us!

1410
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:52,531
Look at me!
Beth, look at me.

1411
01:12:52,598 --> 01:12:54,133
It's in there so deep!

1412
01:12:58,537 --> 01:12:59,972
Guys?

1413
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:01,674
Guys, I don't think
she's breathing.

1414
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:04,209
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, no.

1415
01:13:04,276 --> 01:13:05,277
No.

1416
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,648
- Beth, no, no, no.
- She's not breathing.

1417
01:13:09,715 --> 01:13:11,483
Beth, no!
I can get this off!

1418
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:14,386
- I can get it off!
- I'm not getting a pulse!

1419
01:13:14,453 --> 01:13:16,921
Miranda, we lost her.

1420
01:13:18,123 --> 01:13:19,792
No, no, no,
no, no, no, Beth.

1421
01:13:19,857 --> 01:13:21,360
No, no, no, no!

1422
01:13:21,427 --> 01:13:23,662
I can do this!

1423
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:25,197
I can get it out!
I can get it out!

1424
01:13:25,264 --> 01:13:27,566
Miranda, she's gone.

1425
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:35,840
There was no saving her
at this point.

1426
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:40,446
That thing has been
feeding off of her

1427
01:13:40,512 --> 01:13:43,182
even with the central nervous
system destroyed.

1428
01:13:43,248 --> 01:13:45,484
It still managed
to get sustenance.

1429
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:48,554
Who knows how long that
thing's been stuck there?

1430
01:13:53,925 --> 01:13:55,627
Did you know about this?

1431
01:13:55,694 --> 01:13:58,430
No. She didn't say anything.

1432
01:13:58,997 --> 01:14:00,165
[growling]

1433
01:14:04,303 --> 01:14:05,971
We gotta keep moving.
Let's go!

1434
01:14:07,606 --> 01:14:08,974
[gasps]

1435
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:12,544
No, no!

1436
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:13,545
[screaming]

1437
01:14:17,882 --> 01:14:21,220
Jack, you don't understand!
This thing was at least 15 feet!

1438
01:14:21,286 --> 01:14:23,122
We don't have the resources
to bag something like this!

1439
01:14:23,188 --> 01:14:24,623
That's why we call you guys in!

1440
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,792
Well, I've got to tie
this up, first.

1441
01:14:26,859 --> 01:14:29,528
Yeah, you do that and, as soon
as you're done, you get here!

1442
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:32,064
I will! You just have no idea
how bad it is

1443
01:14:32,131 --> 01:14:34,333
at Eden zoo right now.

1444
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,836
We can't get in.
It's electrified.

1445
01:14:37,902 --> 01:14:39,204
What'd he say?

1446
01:14:39,271 --> 01:14:40,873
Homicide says they got
two dead bodies

1447
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:42,508
in what they're calling an
extreme hoarding situation.

1448
01:14:42,574 --> 01:14:43,842
What?

1449
01:14:43,908 --> 01:14:45,611
They got about 30 cats
and 12 dogs.

1450
01:14:45,677 --> 01:14:47,246
They need to get out of there
before CSI can even move in.

1451
01:14:47,312 --> 01:14:49,148
Something about
the Eden Zoo Sanctuary.

1452
01:14:49,214 --> 01:14:50,783
Call the Sheriff's Department!

1453
01:14:50,849 --> 01:14:52,618
We can't do that!
They don't deal with animals!

1454
01:14:52,684 --> 01:14:54,453
Can we call the Animal Control
next county over?

1455
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,854
No, no, no.
They'll take too long.

1456
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,423
We gotta get them out of here!

1457
01:14:57,489 --> 01:14:58,624
Let's go!

1458
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:00,259
- Let's check it out.
- All right.

1459
01:15:02,728 --> 01:15:03,996
Where is it?

1460
01:15:04,062 --> 01:15:06,098
Where's the breaker box?

1461
01:15:06,165 --> 01:15:07,633
It's flooded!

1462
01:15:07,699 --> 01:15:09,568
I think the breaker box
is over there, right?

1463
01:15:09,635 --> 01:15:11,170
We're never gonna
get out of here.

1464
01:15:11,236 --> 01:15:14,273
I have an idea!
Daniel, come with me.

1465
01:15:19,178 --> 01:15:20,979
The generator's
over there.

1466
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:25,584
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna go get it.

1467
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:26,885
You're gonna what?

1468
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:30,022
Gonna go turn it on.

1469
01:15:30,088 --> 01:15:31,423
Be careful.

1470
01:15:37,596 --> 01:15:38,730
Almost there...

1471
01:15:45,504 --> 01:15:47,039
Careful!

1472
01:15:48,073 --> 01:15:49,675
[growling]

1473
01:15:49,741 --> 01:15:50,809
No! No!

1474
01:15:50,876 --> 01:15:53,011
Oh!

1475
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,482
Get off me!

1476
01:16:01,453 --> 01:16:02,488
Clu!

1477
01:16:02,554 --> 01:16:06,458
Deep-fried calamari...
my favorite.

1478
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:08,460
Ah!

1479
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:09,695
No! Clu!

1480
01:16:09,761 --> 01:16:11,163
[screams]

1481
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,268
No, Clu!

1482
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:21,707
[growling]

1483
01:16:21,773 --> 01:16:23,175
Clu!

1484
01:16:23,242 --> 01:16:25,544
You gotta keep going, Miranda!

1485
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:28,547
Get to the breaker box!
You gotta keep going!

1486
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:32,084
You can do this!

1487
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:41,793
That's right.

1488
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,128
Almost there.

1489
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:50,536
Yes!

1490
01:16:53,872 --> 01:16:56,308
I can't get to
the breakers from here.

1491
01:16:59,012 --> 01:17:00,947
You have to!

1492
01:17:01,014 --> 01:17:02,414
But I can get to the generator!

1493
01:17:02,481 --> 01:17:03,615
What?

1494
01:17:03,682 --> 01:17:05,985
I'm gonna go this way
to the generator!

1495
01:17:06,051 --> 01:17:07,987
Stay right there!

1496
01:17:08,053 --> 01:17:09,521
Just don't get eaten, all right?

1497
01:17:17,829 --> 01:17:19,531
[growling]

1498
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:14,586
Just keep moving,
keep moving, keep moving.

1499
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:26,498
[panting]

1500
01:18:39,478 --> 01:18:41,613
It should be around
here somewhere.

1501
01:18:44,117 --> 01:18:46,151
- [sparking]
- Oh, God.

1502
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:53,558
[grunts]

1503
01:18:58,064 --> 01:19:02,068
Where is this thing?

1504
01:19:02,135 --> 01:19:03,168
Yes!

1505
01:19:03,235 --> 01:19:04,436
[powers up]

1506
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:06,638
Yes!

1507
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:26,324
Oh, God!

1508
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:28,460
Oh, God... oh!

1509
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:35,400
[grunts]

1510
01:19:45,111 --> 01:19:46,578
[grunts]

1511
01:19:57,756 --> 01:19:59,691
Ah!

1512
01:20:13,672 --> 01:20:14,906
[laughs]

1513
01:20:18,177 --> 01:20:20,512
Come on! We need to get
you all to the truck!

1514
01:20:21,379 --> 01:20:23,248
No, I'm fine.

1515
01:20:23,315 --> 01:20:25,350
Dr. James needs
medical attention.

1516
01:20:27,153 --> 01:20:29,521
Not you, Daniel.

1517
01:20:29,588 --> 01:20:31,556
We're going to your office.

1518
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:33,492
What?

1519
01:20:33,558 --> 01:20:37,395
The disposal order
from the Eden Zoo supply?

1520
01:20:38,864 --> 01:20:41,167
You told me that we could
get that from your office.

1521
01:20:41,234 --> 01:20:43,970
So let's do that.
I'll follow.

1522
01:20:44,036 --> 01:20:46,038
Miranda?

1523
01:20:46,105 --> 01:20:48,406
We've just been through
hell and back, all right?

1524
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:50,642
You need to give me a
day to clean up my wounds.

1525
01:20:52,078 --> 01:20:54,279
No.

1526
01:20:54,346 --> 01:20:56,581
Let's make one thing clear.

1527
01:20:56,648 --> 01:20:58,416
You show me that disposal order

1528
01:20:58,483 --> 01:21:01,453
or you tell me
what really happened.

1529
01:21:05,224 --> 01:21:06,558
I'm waiting.

1530
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,063
Fine.
All right.

1531
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:12,430
It's Blackburn.

1532
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:16,868
It's all his idea.

1533
01:21:16,936 --> 01:21:18,904
He wants to sell the aquarium
because he can get top dollar.

1534
01:21:18,971 --> 01:21:20,872
And he told me if
I didn't destroy the injectors

1535
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,741
to switch them,
he was gonna cut me in.

1536
01:21:22,808 --> 01:21:25,044
I just thought a few animals
were gonna get hurt.

1537
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:26,745
I didn't know
this was gonna happen!

1538
01:21:26,812 --> 01:21:28,647
Why did you think
was gonna happen?

1539
01:21:28,713 --> 01:21:31,316
There are innocent people
dead because of you!

1540
01:21:31,383 --> 01:21:33,186
Okay, okay.

1541
01:21:33,252 --> 01:21:34,954
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy now!

1542
01:21:35,021 --> 01:21:36,655
Take him into custody!

1543
01:21:36,721 --> 01:21:38,456
Ma'am, I don't have
that kind of authority.

1544
01:21:38,523 --> 01:21:40,126
I'm only administered
to save lives

1545
01:21:40,193 --> 01:21:42,228
and take the necessary
precautions on site.

1546
01:21:42,295 --> 01:21:45,031
And bring badly injured patients
to the nearest medical hospital.

1547
01:21:45,097 --> 01:21:46,832
Okay.

1548
01:21:48,234 --> 01:21:49,401
- God!
- Ow!

1549
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:51,037
That'll do it.

1550
01:21:51,103 --> 01:21:52,571
Not cool!

1551
01:21:52,637 --> 01:21:53,973
Come on, buddy.

1552
01:21:59,411 --> 01:22:00,745
Thank you!
