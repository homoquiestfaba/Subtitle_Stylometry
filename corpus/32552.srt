1
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:57,740
Why not call it the Pecu?
Or the Nipia one?

2
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,870
I'm just saying how do we know
it's an ice age?

3
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:03,915
Because of all the ices!

4
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,718
Well , things just
got a little peculiar.

5
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:12,449
Help! Help!

6
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:16,051
Come on, kids, let's go.
The berg is moving.

7
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,681
But, dad. . .

8
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:21,284
No "but".
You can play later.

9
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:24,200
Okay.
Come on, guys.

10
00:04:25,614 --> 00:04:27,587
Sally, where's Eddie?

11
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:31,661
He said something about being on a
verge of a revolutionary breakthrough.

12
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,077
Really?

13
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:37,066
I'm flying!

14
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,938
Some breakthrough.

15
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:43,498
Look out!
A mammoth is on its way.

16
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:55,934
Hey, do the world a favour!

17
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,022
Move your issue off the road!

18
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:03,654
If my trunk was that small ,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal .

19
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,155
Give me a break.

20
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:07,856
We've been wandering with our babies.

21
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:12,360
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

22
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:14,203
Be quiet when you're gone.

23
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,076
Come on.

24
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,286
I'm up, I'm up!

25
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:36,161
Rising sign, everybody.

26
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:39,249
Zeke? Mashu?

27
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:42,593
Birdie? Uncle Fungis?

28
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:44,352
Where is everybody?

29
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:46,710
Come on, guys.
We gonna miss the mi . . .

30
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:49,369
My patient.

31
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:53,743
They left without me.

32
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,831
They do this every year!

33
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:01,505
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

34
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:06,351
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

35
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:10,940
All right, I'll just go by myself.

36
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,972
Oh. Stinks!

37
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:18,231
Hey, wait, buddy!
Tell me next time!

38
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:24,106
I can't believe it.
Fresh and green.

39
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:27,066
Frank, you're cutest ever.

40
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:28,480
Go ahead, pick it.

41
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,954
A dandelion.
I thought the frost wipe them all out.

42
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,755
All but one.

43
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,700
Make me so. . .

44
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,876
This is definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm saying, buddy?

45
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,592
What a mess.

46
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:48,422
Hey, you rhino, you have really
nice race, do you know that?

47
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,537
It's just a fact.

48
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:52,797
You know what I'm talking about.

49
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,342
A dandelion.

50
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,486
Must be the last one of season.

51
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,589
Carlo.
Easy, Frankie.

52
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,434
He ruined our salad.

53
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:10,979
Oh, my mistake.
It's my mistake. Let me. . .

54
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:13,295
No, seriously, let me take care of this.

55
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,310
Oh. What is this?

56
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:19,299
My goodness, that's my favourite.

57
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,744
Hmm , delicious.

58
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:25,989
That's a. . .good eating.

59
00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:29,420
Don't let me have it all .
Yes, you have some.

60
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,707
Tasty, isn't it?

61
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:32,379
Gonna have to pick tooth.

62
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,296
Now?

63
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:37,139
Now.

64
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:48,846
Please save me.

65
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,677
I wanna hit him full speed.

66
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:54,421
That's okay, Frank.
We'll have some fun with him .

67
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:57,167
Don't let them kill me, please.
I wanna live!

68
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:58,110
Get off me!

69
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,726
Come on, you're making a scene.

70
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,814
We just take off free and go.
Do your mind?

71
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:06,902
Buddy, if not them today,
it's just someone else tomorrow.

72
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,689
I rather not be today. Okay?

73
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:13,119
Gotta break your neck so you
don't feel the pain. How's that?

74
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:16,293
Wait a minute.
I thought rhinos are vegetarians.

75
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:18,394
An active point.
Shut up!

76
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,268
Who says we gonna eat him
after we kill him?

77
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,254
Come on, move it.

78
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:25,385
You know, I don't like
animals to kill for pleasure.

79
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:26,971
Sid, for matters that cares.

80
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,030
I'm the matter that cares.

81
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:30,960
Okay, look. If either of you make it

82
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:34,391
across that sink hole in front of you,
you get this one.

83
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,779
That's right, you losers.
You take a step and you're dead.

84
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,442
You're bluffing, huh?
Yeah, that was a bluff.

85
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:48,157
Go!

86
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,168
A dandelion?

87
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:32,371
We're steady!

88
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:34,644
What?

89
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:43,607
You have beautiful eyes.

90
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:45,622
Get off my face.

91
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,697
You and me, we make a great team .

92
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:51,240
What do you say
we just head South together?

93
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:53,856
Yeah, jump on my back
and relax your whole way.

94
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,743
Really?
No.

95
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,845
Wait, aren't you going to South?

96
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,332
The changing season,
emigrational things?

97
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,334
Is it ringing a bell?
I guess not, pal .

98
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:06,336
Okay, thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

99
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:11,353
Hey, you over grown weasel .
Wait till we get down there.

100
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:14,913
The whole South thing is way out.
The heat, the crowd.

101
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:20,616
This great. You and me, two guys
knocking about in the wild.

102
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,733
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

103
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:27,307
You're very strut mammoth.

104
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:30,051
Can you lead the way, Mr. Big Guy?

105
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:31,338
Manfred.

106
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:35,498
How about Mandy the moody
mammoth or nanny the. . .

107
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,188
Stop following me.

108
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:47,548
Okay, so you got it.
You won't even know I'm here.

109
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,522
I'll just zip the lip when I say. . .

110
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:39,868
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

111
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,714
Isn't it nice if he joining us for breakfast?

112
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:47,202
It wouldn't be breakfast without him .

113
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:53,248
His daddy wiped our hair for pack.
And rag our skin to keep warm .

114
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:56,465
And ruin our lives. Don't you think?

115
00:11:56,594 --> 00:12:00,239
Let show that human what happen
when he messed with Sabers.

116
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:03,370
Alert the troops.
We attack at dawn.

117
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:09,416
And Diego, bring me that baby. Alive.

118
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:14,777
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

119
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:38,835
I'm wiped out.

120
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,379
That's your shelter?

121
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,896
You're a big guy. You got a lot of
woods. I'm a little guy.

122
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:45,268
You only got a stick.

123
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:50,114
Yeah, but with my little stick,
and my highly evolved brain. . .

124
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,301
I'll start the fire.

125
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,016
Fascinating.

126
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:59,463
We'll see if breeze try to blow us
tonight. Now won't we?

127
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:07,011
Hey, I think I saw its flare.

128
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:15,202
Any chance I can squeeze
in there with you?

129
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,775
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

130
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:21,934
Friends? Family?
Poison reptiles?

131
00:13:21,977 --> 00:13:26,309
My family is bad.
They just kind of migrate without me.

132
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:28,753
You should see what they did last year.

133
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:33,384
They woke up early and
they tied my hands and feet together.

134
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:36,859
They buried the cave door,
and covered their tracks.

135
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:42,262
They made it anyway.

136
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:48,995
So what about you? You got family?

137
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,500
Okay, you're tired, I see.
We'll talk tomorrow morning.

138
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:00,831
Manfred? Manfred.

139
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:02,461
Could you move over?

140
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:06,450
Come on, nobody fall asleep that fast.

141
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:08,465
Mandy!

142
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,580
That's Diego, fall back!

143
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,771
Where's the baby?

144
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:16,902
I lost it over the falls.
You lost it?

145
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:23,463
I want that baby, Diego.
I'll get it.

146
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,709
You better. Unless you want to serve
yourself as the replacement.

147
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:31,268
We'll go up to half peak. Meet us there.

148
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:34,184
It'd better be alive.

149
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:38,430
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

150
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,674
Let's go!

151
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,434
And you pick this year off my shoulders.

152
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:08,578
If you gonna have a mating partner,

153
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:11,237
at least pick a female
with the same color palette, right?

154
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:14,625
And I thought, wow, he's gonna go
primal , you know what I'm saying?

155
00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:17,541
If you find a mate in life,
you should be loyal .

156
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,899
In your case, it's grateful .
Get away from me.

157
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:24,960
Well , I think mate in life is stupid.
I mean everybody just sit around. . .

158
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:27,705
Mandy?

159
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:28,129
Look at that.
He's okay.

160
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:41,596
She's gone.

161
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,847
Hey, Mandy,
are you forgetting something?

162
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,505
No.
But you just saved him .

163
00:19:57,635 --> 00:20:00,636
Yeah, but I'm still trying
to get rid of the last thing I saved.

164
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:02,695
You can't leave him here.

165
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:08,785
Look, there's smoke.

166
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,130
That's his heir right up the hill .
We should return him .

167
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:15,132
Let's get something straight.
There's no "we".

168
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:17,104
There never was a "we".

169
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:20,792
In fact, without me,
there wouldn't even be a "you"!

170
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,280
Just up the hill .

171
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:29,069
Listen very carefully.
I'm not g-o-i-n-g.

172
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:30,741
Fine. Be a jerk.

173
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:32,329
I'll take care of him .

174
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:34,044
Go. Yeah, that's good.

175
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,788
You take care of him?
You can't even take care of yourself.

176
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:37,904
This I gotta see.

177
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:42,149
I'll return him .
We don't need that Mandy.

178
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:43,864
You know we do.

179
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,744
You're embarrassing the nature,
do you know that?

180
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:22,033
I'm fine. I'm fine!

181
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:23,491
I'm gonna die.

182
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:54,968
That thing is mine.

183
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:57,412
No, actually that thing belongs to us.

184
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:04,145
Us?
You two are barely a couple.

185
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:06,933
There is no "us".
I see.

186
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:09,378
You can have one of your own
so you won't adopt.

187
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,650
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt this.

188
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:12,936
But we gotta go.

189
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,909
The baby, please.

190
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,411
I'm returning to his heir.

191
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:18,898
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

192
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:21,042
You're calling me a lair?
I didn't say that.

193
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,843
You were thinking it.

194
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:25,845
I don't like this cat.
He reads mind.

195
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,161
Name is Diego, friend.

196
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,134
Manfred. And I'm not your friend.

197
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,307
Fine, Manfred.

198
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:36,223
If you're looking for its heir,
you're wasting your time.

199
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:37,681
He left this morning.

200
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,684
Thanks for the advice. I beat this.

201
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,042
All right, I'll help you bring it to its heir.

202
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:45,272
But promise me
you'd leave me alone after that.

203
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:47,031
Okay, deal .

204
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,874
What's your problem?
You're my problem .

205
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:51,362
But I think you're stressed.
That's why you eat so much.

206
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,463
It's hard to get fat on a diet.

207
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:57,837
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look puffy.

208
00:22:57,966 --> 00:23:01,525
All right, yeah. Fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

209
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:07,100
Just drop it on the land.

210
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,217
Shouldn't we make sure they found
him? Good idea.

211
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:12,976
No, no, no!
Wait.

212
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,835
Don't spear me!

213
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:21,767
This is a problem .

214
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:23,483
Now what?

215
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:26,270
That's perfect.

216
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:58,863
I told you they were gone.

217
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:00,107
Look who it is.

218
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,894
Don't you have some flaw
defenseless animals to disembogue?

219
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:05,295
They couldn't be far.
They went this way?

220
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:07,225
Or this way?

221
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:09,455
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

222
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:13,444
I must lost. I see trees,
either leaves, that's my tracking.

223
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,631
You didn't miss them by much.

224
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:17,517
It's still green.

225
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:19,534
They head north 2 hours ago.

226
00:24:19,662 --> 00:24:21,763
Is it? They head north 2 hours ago.

227
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,667
You don't need this aggravation.

228
00:24:29,997 --> 00:24:31,584
Give me the baby.

229
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:34,072
I can track human down
faster than you can.

230
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,859
And you're just a good citizen
helping out, right?

231
00:24:36,988 --> 00:24:38,960
I just know where the human will go.

232
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:40,633
Find the pass.

233
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:43,977
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

234
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:47,237
Unless you know how to track,

235
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:50,453
you never gonna reach them
before their pass closed up with snow.

236
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:53,412
Which should be like, tomorrow.

237
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:57,786
So you can give that baby to me
or go get lost in the blizzard.

238
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,459
It's your choice.

239
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:10,395
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We'll return it to the human.

240
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:16,527
Big bad Tiddy Widdy get cliff.
Poor Tiddy Widdy. . .

241
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:20,387
Sid, Tiddy Widdy is gonna lead the way.

242
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:25,962
Mandy, can I talk to you for a second?

243
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:26,734
No.

244
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:30,937
The sooner we find the human,
the sooner I get rid of Mr. Stinky-drew-face.

245
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:32,566
And the baby too.

246
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:37,456
You always have that jumbo
around to protect you.

247
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:41,057
And when that day comes,
I suggest you watch your back.

248
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:43,116
Cause I'll be tuning on it.

249
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:47,061
Human tracker,
up front so I can see you.

250
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:48,777
Help me.

251
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:08,718
You gotta make him stop.
I can't tolerate anymore!

252
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:10,692
I think this thing didn't complain this much.

253
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,050
Stop shouting at me.
You're holding it wrong.

254
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:15,237
Watch its head!
Just put it down.

255
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:19,740
Its nose is dry.

256
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,713
That means something is wrong with it.

257
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,857
Maybe we should lick it.
Just in case.

258
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:24,672
I'll do it.

259
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:26,988
You know, the baby stinks.

260
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:29,947
So if it poops, where does it go?

261
00:26:32,563 --> 00:26:34,321
Humans are disgusting.

262
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:35,522
Okay, you.

263
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,680
Check for poop.

264
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:38,309
Why am I the poop checker?

265
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:41,354
Because returning it is your idea.
Because you're small and insignificant

266
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:43,884
And because I'll pound you if you don't.

267
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:46,500
What else?
Now, Sid!

268
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,734
I mean, my goodness.

269
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:56,450
All right, look out. Coming through.

270
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,851
Watch out!
Stop waving it around!

271
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:00,866
Oh, I'm gonna slip!

272
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:08,329
It's clean! Got you!

273
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,102
Would you cut it out!

274
00:27:14,204 --> 00:27:16,434
Hey, do that again.
He likes it.

275
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:21,580
That makes me feel better too.

276
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,116
Turn him towards me.

277
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:38,863
Where is the baby?
There it is!

278
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:42,679
Where is the baby?

279
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:43,966
There it is!

280
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:48,383
Stop it! You're scaring it!

281
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:54,687
I bet he's hungry.

282
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:55,545
How about some milk?

283
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:58,590
I'd love some.
Not you, the baby.

284
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,463
I ain't exactly doing it right now, pal .

285
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,865
You alone are the food
jamming mouth, aren't you?

286
00:28:03,993 --> 00:28:06,138
Enough!

287
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:11,627
Food!

288
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:32,340
Prepare for ice age!

289
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:34,914
Protect the Dodo valley!

290
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:38,773
Survivals separate the Dodo off the peak!

291
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,104
Protect the Dodo valley!

292
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:45,121
Prepare for ice age!

293
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:46,664
Ice age?

294
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:48,766
I've heard of these cracks, buddy.

295
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:52,796
Intruders!

296
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:56,142
Don't fall in. if you do, you'll physically. . .

297
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,085
Intruders!

298
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,802
Burned and died.

299
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,147
Hey, can we have our melon back?

300
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:06,563
Junior is hungry and. . .

301
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:10,079
No way! This is our private
stuff for ice age.

302
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:14,368
Some of us has been looking
around for billions billions years.

303
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:17,069
So you got three melons?

304
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:23,631
If you weren't smart,
and I'll cut it into half and throw on you.

305
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,748
Wait for me.

306
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,436
No!

307
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:33,365
Retrieve the melon!

308
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:35,510
Attack!

309
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:48,762
The melon!

310
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,109
There goes our last female.

311
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:10,848
The last melon!

312
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,791
That's it.

313
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:42,063
Now we gonna find more food.

314
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:50,856
We got dinner on the shore.

315
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:03,206
Now the meal will be feeding a hungry sloth.

316
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:07,494
With who?
A vole?

317
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,038
Come on, you wanna fist me?

318
00:32:24,134 --> 00:32:25,420
Bedtime.

319
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:37,986
The triumph has returned.

320
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,517
Shuffle.

321
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:46,563
How about a good night kiss for you?

322
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:48,707
Shh. It's asleep.

323
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:50,680
I was talking to you.

324
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:53,768
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

325
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,159
Good night.

326
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:28,290
Would you stop that!

327
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:29,833
All right. All right.

328
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:31,206
Trying to relax.

329
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:39,011
All right.

330
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,358
What the. . .

331
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:30,559
Go ahead. Slice me.

332
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:32,059
It'll be the last thing you'd ever do.

333
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:34,204
I'm working here, you wasted fur.

334
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,919
For who, Diego?

335
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:39,092
Tracking down human
is too difficult for you?

336
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,194
What are you two doing here?

337
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,381
Soto's getting tired of waiting.

338
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,898
Yeah. He said,
come back with the baby,

339
00:34:47,027 --> 00:34:48,956
or don't come back at all !

340
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:52,816
I have a message for Soto.

341
00:34:52,944 --> 00:34:55,732
Tell him , I'm bringing the baby.

342
00:34:56,633 --> 00:35:01,479
And tell him , I'm bringing a mammoth.

343
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:02,680
A mammoth.

344
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:04,823
Mammoth never travels alone.

345
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:09,241
This one does.
And I'm leading him to half peak.

346
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,029
Look at all that meat.

347
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:14,130
Let's get him !
Not yet!

348
00:35:14,258 --> 00:35:17,004
We need the whole gang
to bring this mammoth down.

349
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:18,675
Get everyone ready.

350
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,249
Now!

351
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:47,452
Where is the baby?

352
00:35:47,537 --> 00:35:49,296
You lost it?

353
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:52,083
Sid!

354
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:56,757
It's so ugly.
But it's adorable.

355
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,489
Hello, pumpkin.

356
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:02,075
Where did you find it?

357
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,821
The poor kid all alone in the wild.

358
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:09,023
Sabers gang nailed on it.
So I just snatch it.

359
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:10,438
So brave.

360
00:36:10,566 --> 00:36:14,641
Well , he needed me and
I only wish I have with my home.

361
00:36:15,198 --> 00:36:16,742
Really?

362
00:36:17,214 --> 00:36:19,873
I never attracted to a male.

363
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:23,132
Who wouldn't want a family, I always say.

364
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:27,678
Well , you know.

365
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:32,781
Cute kid, huh?

366
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:35,955
So I was saying, ladies. . .

367
00:36:37,627 --> 00:36:39,943
Hey! Mandy!

368
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:42,087
What's the matter with you?

369
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,703
Excuse me, ladies.

370
00:36:44,831 --> 00:36:47,490
You just keep aggregating
and I'll be right back.

371
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,540
He's not much to look at
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

372
00:36:56,753 --> 00:36:59,799
Tell me about it.
But the sensitive ones get eaten.

373
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:04,130
No, please.
I beg you, I need him .

374
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:06,489
Why? A good looking guy like you?

375
00:37:06,617 --> 00:37:07,990
You say that but you don't mean it.

376
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:09,876
No, seriously, look at you.

377
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:12,621
Most ladies, they don't stand the chance.

378
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,594
We have a very cool sense of humour.

379
00:37:14,722 --> 00:37:16,138
Don't let me crap this time.

380
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,982
Thanks, man. You're the best.

381
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,241
Without the baby.
Mandy, I need him .

382
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,618
So, ladies, where were we?

383
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:32,048
Carlo?
Easy, Frankie.

384
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:37,709
Pretty tired, huh?
Somebody moves like a cheater.

385
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,952
And that tiger.

386
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:42,640
Yeah, Mr. Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

387
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:44,957
What am l? Head winder?

388
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:46,929
What are you looking at?

389
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:53,233
Look at you. You gonna
grow into a big predator, huh?

390
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:54,734
I don't think so.

391
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:56,235
What do you got?
You got. . .

392
00:37:56,449 --> 00:38:00,181
Iittle patched fur,
no teeth, no claws.

393
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:06,699
Your foot is skin-wrap in mulish.
What so threatening about you?

394
00:38:12,017 --> 00:38:15,062
Hey, am I like pillow a to you?

395
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:20,122
Okay. All right, wise guy.

396
00:38:20,293 --> 00:38:21,880
You just started time out.

397
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:27,370
You think that's funny?
How about this?

398
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,473
You'll lose snack in an hour.

399
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:37,362
I'm a little square to give you that.

400
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:46,196
Thank goodness.

401
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:51,857
Oh, a tiger!
Help! Help!

402
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:53,101
Where's the baby?

403
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:55,588
The rhinos are after me.
So think about it.

404
00:38:57,389 --> 00:39:00,734
He got me!
Help. . .

405
00:39:00,863 --> 00:39:02,107
Get away from me.

406
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,809
This way.
Over here.

407
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:17,117
No, Carlo!
The tiger beat us to him .

408
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,418
Wait a minute.

409
00:39:26,036 --> 00:39:27,666
It's dead, all right.

410
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:30,925
No.
Carlo, where's your all upon?

411
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:38,087
I hate to bend like that.
But you know how it is.

412
00:39:38,988 --> 00:39:41,003
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now.

413
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:43,748
Mandy!

414
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:46,964
Guys, I thought we're in a hurry.

415
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,438
When Diego speaks that out,
you're gonna wiped.

416
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:56,184
Boy. For a second, I actually
thought you gonna eat me.

417
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:57,686
I don't eat junk food.

418
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,446
I thought you're gonna. . . Were you?

419
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,863
Wait up. Wait up!

420
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:09,436
Can you wait a second, please?

421
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,151
Hey, fellows!

422
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:14,754
Thanks for waiting.

423
00:40:15,698 --> 00:40:18,055
3, 2, 1 .

424
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,473
Sure is faithful .

425
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,870
Don't make me reach back there.
He started it.

426
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:43,015
I don't care who started it.
I'll finish it.

427
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:20,453
Modern architecture.
It'd never last.

428
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:36,321
Hey, Mandy.

429
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:40,481
Hey, Diego.

430
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:49,616
Hey, Sid.

431
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:55,062
You're lost, aren't you?
No, I know exactly where we are.

432
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:56,434
Ask him direction.

433
00:41:57,506 --> 00:42:00,208
I don't need direction.
Fine, I'll ask him .

434
00:42:00,508 --> 00:42:03,339
Hey, buddy. Have you seen
any human goes by here?

435
00:42:06,898 --> 00:42:08,142
I love this thing.

436
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:10,929
Okay, three words.

437
00:42:11,058 --> 00:42:12,902
First word, stamp.

438
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:15,690
Let me try.

439
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,091
Pack.
Good word, Mandy.

440
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:20,064
Long teeth?

441
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,651
Great news

442
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:07,409
I found a short cut

443
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,354
What do you mean short cut ?

444
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:13,842
I mean it's faster that the
Long way around

445
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,715
I know what a short cut is

446
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:20,103
Either we slip through there and
Beat the past

447
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:22,247
Or take the long way and miss them

448
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:25,764
What do you take me for?

449
00:43:25,892 --> 00:43:29,580
This time you can be a free man

450
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:34,941
Hei guys check this out

451
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:40,258
The tiger found the short cut

452
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,762
No thanks I chose light

453
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:47,935
Did I suggest you take
The short cut ?

454
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,608
Are you threatening me?

455
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,323
Move sloth

456
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,388
Stick together it's easy to get lost in
here

457
00:45:22,325 --> 00:45:24,041
Fish

458
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,600
I don't want to keep track
Of one baby

459
00:46:58,302 --> 00:46:59,503
I got you

460
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:29,947
Tell the kid to be more careful

461
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,205
Tigers

462
00:49:16,992 --> 00:49:18,278
It's ok

463
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:22,653
Tigers are just playing with the
antilopes

464
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:25,526
With their teeth

465
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:26,856
Come on Sede

466
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:41,994
Somebody pinched me

467
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:45,296
Look! This fat one
Just like you

468
00:49:50,013 --> 00:49:51,986
Look he is playing with this kid

469
00:49:52,287 --> 00:49:53,745
See that's your problem

470
00:49:53,873 --> 00:49:56,017
That's what men're supposed to do

471
00:49:56,274 --> 00:49:58,676
Find the shelters, have the babies . . .

472
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,220
Sede
What ?

473
00:50:00,306 --> 00:50:01,035
Shut up

474
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:36,789
Look at this

475
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,579
Next stop.
Major pass

476
00:53:43,008 --> 00:53:44,980
How could I ever doubted you ?

477
00:53:45,108 --> 00:53:46,867
Did you hear that ?

478
00:53:46,996 --> 00:53:48,625
You are almost home?

479
00:53:53,858 --> 00:53:55,144
I feel a sweat

480
00:53:55,272 --> 00:53:58,703
Do you have to get a new flask
Every time your body does something ?

481
00:53:58,832 --> 00:54:00,033
Just ignore him

482
00:54:00,161 --> 00:54:03,635
Seriously, my feet are really hot. . .

483
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:11,568
Tell me that was your stomach

484
00:54:11,698 --> 00:54:14,142
I am serious about this

485
00:54:14,314 --> 00:54:16,844
From under . . ,

486
00:54:38,072 --> 00:54:40,002
Come on keep up with me

487
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,975
I wonder if you're moving

488
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:47,035
I wish I'd jump like that

489
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,497
Come on move faster

490
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,144
Mandy are you ok?

491
00:56:07,273 --> 00:56:10,189
Come on say something Anything

492
00:56:12,805 --> 00:56:14,949
What I can't hear you

493
00:56:15,078 --> 00:56:17,265
You are standing on my trunk

494
00:56:19,538 --> 00:56:20,481
You're ok

495
00:56:20,567 --> 00:56:22,583
Why'd you do that ?

496
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,713
You'd have died trying To save me

497
00:56:26,013 --> 00:56:28,158
That' what you do when I'm hurt

498
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:31,031
We guard for each other

499
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:34,075
Well . . .thanks

500
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:36,649
I don't now you guys

501
00:56:36,778 --> 00:56:39,865
We're the weirdest herd I ever seen

502
00:56:59,121 --> 00:57:02,251
I can't wait to get my
Claws on that mammal

503
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:06,454
No one touches until I get that baby

504
00:57:14,903 --> 00:57:16,746
Knock it off I am starving

505
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:22,579
I told you to knock it off

506
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:23,865
Save your energy

507
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,953
Mammals don't go down easy

508
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:29,697
There is only one way to do it

509
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:32,700
First you have to force him lnto a corner

510
00:57:33,172 --> 00:57:34,930
Cut off his ribs

511
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:37,846
Then go for throat

512
00:57:50,454 --> 00:57:52,856
We gotta get this kid out Of the wind

513
00:57:57,058 --> 00:57:59,073
How much further ? 3 miles

514
00:58:06,064 --> 00:58:07,222
what're you doing ?

515
00:58:07,307 --> 00:58:10,353
I'm painting sloth on a map

516
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,100
Why don't you make him look
Realistic and make him like down

517
00:58:16,228 --> 00:58:17,858
Make him rounder

518
00:58:23,046 --> 00:58:24,547
I forgot how to laugh

519
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:33,897
I am a genius

520
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,415
Now you have to refer me as

521
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:43,245
Sid, Lord of the flame

522
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:46,934
Lord of the flame, your tail ls on fire

523
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:56,197
Thank you

524
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:59,156
From now on I'm gonna call You Diego

525
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:00,828
You touch me and you are dead

526
00:59:02,029 --> 00:59:05,116
I am just kidding you little Nuthead

527
00:59:07,562 --> 00:59:08,891
Look at this

528
00:59:14,123 --> 00:59:17,167
I don't believe. . .

529

Good job

535

Practise

536
01:00:00,695 --> 01:00:02,882
A little guy growing up

537
01:00:05,499 --> 01:00:08,115
Come on sleep tight

538
01:00:17,592 --> 01:00:22,309
You know I never had a friend
who'd Risk his life for me

539
01:00:22,438 --> 01:00:26,985
Yeah he is a good guy

540
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:28,914
Yeah he is

541
01:00:29,986 --> 01:00:32,516
Well , good night

542
01:00:39,121 --> 01:00:40,964

Get down and follow me

547
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:15,444
What's going on?

548
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:21,148
There is an ambush waiting for you

549
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:23,293
What do you mean ambush

550
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:26,380
You set us up ?

551
01:01:26,509 --> 01:01:29,210

Get the baby but. . .

560
01:01:42,805 --> 01:01:43,791
You have to trust me

561
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,179

Worry about you

566
01:02:12,138 --> 01:02:13,725
No need to worry

Satisfied your taste for revenge

01:02:23,975 --> 01:02:26,847
Don't give away your position
Until you see the mammal

571
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:28,864
He is the one you have to surprise

01:07:04,356 --> 01:07:06,244
Knock it off

01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,289
You have to be strong

592
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:11,647
You have to take care of mammal

593
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,850
Especially Sid

594
01:07:18,852 --> 01:07:21,768
You're a tiger I can carry you

Listen. You have to leave me here

01:07:33,604 --> 01:07:35,749
Or the humans get to the pass

599
01:07:35,877 --> 01:07:37,764
You'll never catch them

600
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:40,595
You didn't have to do that

601
01:07:41,881 --> 01:07:44,283
That's what you do in The herd

602
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:07,643
Forget about us , ok?

603
