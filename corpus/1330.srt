00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,240
Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

2
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,880
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

3
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,000
Our obligation is to reduce
our bloated government...

4
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,400
but at the same time,
restore its creative power...

5
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,480
to reinvigorate our society...

6
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,680
My name is Jay Bulworth.

7
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

8
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,320
Our obligation...

9
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,200
California families
who live by the rules...

10
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,960
and work hard
and pay their taxes...

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,080
shouldn't be paying
for people who do nothing.

12
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,280
I'm Jay Bulworth.

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,480
I believe in a hand up,
not a hand down.

14
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,840
I need your support on Tuesday.

15
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,880
I'm Jay Bulworth.

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,160
I'll fight to end unnecessary
affirmative action programs.

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
I'm Jay Bulworth.

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,520
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,280
Our obligation is to reduce...

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,840
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

22
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,920
Our welfare system
is out of control.

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,520
Of course we should help...

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,200
My name is Jay Bulworth.

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,000
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,320
My wife Connie and I
have been married for 24 years.

27
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,960
She's been a loving partner,
and more importantly...

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,760
Connie's been my friend.

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,720
Jay has been a great
senator for California...

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,600
but the best job he's done is
as a loving husband and father.

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,280
I believe
in the old-fashioned values...

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,920
of honesty and decency
and fidelity.

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,000
Join me in my crusade...

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
to strengthen
California's families.

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,960
Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,360
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,680
I'm Jay Bulworth.

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,760
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,160
We can't afford any longer
to give people privileges...

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,600
on the basis of race.

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,240
It's time we realized
discrimination in the past...

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,880
doesn't justify discrimination
in the future.

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,360
Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,400
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,240
Our welfare system
is out of control.

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,640
Of course we should help
families who truly need it...

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,720
but too often, welfare
is a permanent subsidy...

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,760
for able-bodied people
who could and should...

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,240
Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,880
Our obligation is to reduce
our bloated government...

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,400
I'm Jay Bulworth.

53
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,600
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,400
It's time we realized
discrimination in the past...

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,400
Of course we should help
families who truly need it.

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm Jay Bulworth.

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,360
Our obligation is to reduce...

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,520
I'm Jay Bulworth.

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,800
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

62
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,520
We can't afford any longer
to give people...

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,280
I'll fight to end unnecessary
affirmative action programs...

64
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,040
Hello, this is
a telephone answering machine.

65
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,200
Leave a message at the beep.

66
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,800
If you're there,
pick up the goddamn telephone.

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,000
I know you're there.

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,680
Pork bellies, indeed.

69
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,280
I've just spoken with Hong Kong
again, and I'm very upset!

70
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,240
That's the wrong word.
I'm pissed, pissed...

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
pissed, pissed, pissed, pissed!

72
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,720
I warned you repeatedly
about Fenner.

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,520
That son of a bitch and
his pork belly goddamn schemes.

74
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,200
And now he tells me...

75
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,760
He tells me you've invested
nearly everything you had...

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,240
and they're selling
the goddamn things short.

77
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,520
We got the check.

78
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,400
The senator would just love
to have drinks with the sultan.

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,560
Will the sultan be
in Beverly Hills?

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,480
- Has he buzzed yet?
- No.

81
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,920
Feldman call?

82
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,360
It's 6:15 in the morning in L.A.

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
I don't care.
Get me Liebowitz and Macavoy.

84
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,280
I only got two hands.
I'm too old to grow a third.

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,040
I didn't ask you
to grow anything new.

86
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,560
Just get me the calls.

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,680
And Mr. Chow?
What about Mr. Ling?

88
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
Tell me, did his check clear?

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,280
Hey, Senator.

90
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,480
It's a beautiful morning.

91
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,880
The birds are singing.
The leaves are...

92
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,640
doing whatever leaves do.

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,760
Did you eat anything?

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,000
It's Friday.
That pizza's from Wednesday.

95
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,360
Ahem.

96
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,560
Fenner call?

97
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,360
He said you sold pork bellies
short, and now they're up again.

98
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,080
I mean, is that a disaster?

99
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,320
Davers, do I look like
a disaster to you?

100
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,600
Good morning.

101
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,200
The poll's
worse than we thought.

102
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,560
We're down by four points...

103
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,560
but the new spots
are playing absolutely huge...

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,760
and we'll get 900 grand
from the Sunday brunch.

105
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,720
You might be asked about that
insurance bill in five minutes.

106
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,680
Which insurance bill?

107
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,920
S2720...
regulates insurance companies.

108
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,240
Makes them sell it
to poor people.

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,800
That's a good bill.

110
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,000
Not for insurance companies.

111
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,680
What, are we working
for the insurance companies?

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,640
We do today, or Tuesday,
we don't work for anybody.

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,960
We're trying to get
50 grand a table.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Should we talk on the way?

115
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,760
Senator, Missy Berliner,
Los Angeles Times.

116
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,880
Sam.

117
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,360
Senator, your challenger
in next Tuesday's primary...

118
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,560
said you were, quote,
"an old liberal wine...

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,400
"trying to pour himself
into a new conservative bottle".

120
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,360
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

121
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,720
- That kind of mistake can hurt.
- What mistake?

122
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,160
The both sides remark.
Hello, Constance.

123
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,840
I don't know
why your people would think...

124
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,360
I have nothing better to do
than wait around.

125
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,560
I have no objection
to doing my part...

126
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,640
but the least you can do
is to get your staff...

127
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,320
to show some respect
for my time.

128
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,680
Uh-huh.
What about both sides?

129
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,440
It was Bob Sheer, right?

130
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,280
Weren't we supposed to go with
"We'll get back to you, Bob?"

131
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,560
"Both sides" implies the other
side is worth considering.

132
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,080
- Where's Becky?
- She doesn't want a photo op.

133
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,040
She's 17. She wants
to be with her friends.

134
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
Is she mad at me?

135
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,120
She's not mad. She's 17.

136
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,880
Just send her money.
She'll be fine.

137
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
Smile in the back, please.

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,640
OK, that's it.

139
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,160
Uh, Con... Uh...

140
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,720
We want to thank you all
for your help.

141
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,800
Any other help, please
make payable to Bulworth '96.

142
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Serum cholesterol,
folate level...

143
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,240
liver function, blood pressure,
EKG... they're all fine.

144
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,720
Are you eating?

145
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,000
Uh, no, thanks.

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,400
No, I'm asking, have you
experienced a loss of appetite?

147
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,760
No, no, no.
I'm just not very hungry.

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,320
When was the last time you ate?

149
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,520
Mr. Fong
and the Chung family left.

150
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,960
Will Mr. And Mrs. Wang
be in California?

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hello, Helen, how are you?

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,480
- Hello, Mr. Crockett.
- Hello, Mrs. Dobish.

153
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
Mr. Crockett,
American Insurance Federation.

154
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,400
Jay. Jay.

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,320
Are you telling me you haven't
eaten or slept in three days?

156
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,440
That's not good.

157
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,840
Maybe you should talk
to someone.

158
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
I'll give you a name.
Milton Alexander.

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,960
He's head of Psychiatry
at Georgetown.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,240
Uh, I got a meeting here.

161
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
This bill will devastate us.

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,520
- It will be...
- Crockett.

163
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,800
Can I call you back?

164
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
Doc, how's he doing?

165
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,520
Fine. Fine.

166
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,480
- How are you doing?
- Fine, fine. You?

167
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,040
- Fine.
- Fine.

168
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Can you believe
this goddamn regulation bill?

169
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,640
Is the whole world going insane?

170
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,080
When you consider
the dislocation...

171
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
in the relationships
with the state commissioners...

172
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,800
or the effect
on the rate structure...

173
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,040
This bill's
gonna cost us billions.

174
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,360
And it's the usual people
making trouble.

175
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,120
You think I'm gonna say
it's the African Americans.

176
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,320
It's not the African Americans.

177
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,720
I have no problem
with African Americans.

178
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm not other people.

179
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,280
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Colin Powell, Michael Jordan...

180
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,520
I have no problem with them.
They have good jobs.

181
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,320
But you throw down
some lazy, welfare-taking...

182
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,280
drug-dealing,
rap-singing punk...

183
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,000
and tell me my people
have to give him a policy. Why?

184
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,800
So he can burn down his house?
Or smoke crack and get AIDS?

185
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,720
You can't get AIDS
by burning your house down.

186
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,640
We got
the broadcasters, insurance...

187
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,200
A.M.A... Buddhists?

188
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,520
What about the Buddhists?

189
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,720
Vinnie! Ha ha ha ha!

190
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,960
Vinnie, you son of a bitch,
how are you?

191
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,160
How you been?

192
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,680
Other than the prostate
like a coffee cake...

193
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,880
a little ticker trouble...
terrific.

194
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,480
To use an overworked phrase,
this bill is...

195
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,280
The bill is un-American.

196
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,280
And I have
total confidence in you...

197
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,600
that you can bottle up this bill
in committee.

198
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
What have we got there?

199
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,600
Oh, I got
your homeowner's insurance...

200
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,720
disability insurance,
umbrella, liability...

201
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,480
and I see no reason
why you shouldn't have...

202
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,240
a couple million dollars
in life insurance.

203
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,240
I thought we said ten.

204
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,600
- What?
- Ten. Ten million.

205
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,040
Pesos?

206
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,840
Senator... Ha ha ha.

207
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,640
I feel constrained to remind you
that what we said was...

208
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,440
a couple of million
paid to your daughter...

209
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,960
Four payments,
2.5 million each...

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,880
ten million dollars
to my daughter.

211
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,080
Would five do it?

212
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,120
Why don't we just say seven?

213
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,080
Ten million.
That's a lot of life insurance.

214
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,480
If Jay Bulworth plays ball,
we'll play ball.

215
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,440
Oh, Senator,
I want you to meet Vinnie.

216
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,680
Vinnie, how are you?

217
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,640
Ready for the weekend
research project?

218
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,240
Davers, could you excuse us?
Thanks.

219
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,360
Uh, all right, Senator,
I'll be right outside.

220
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,720
Tell her we need
U.S. American dollars.

221
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,560
Small bills.

222
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,960
I wish I didn't have to go
through Davers to talk to you.

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,880
Davers can always reach me.
Davers is a sweetheart.

224
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,840
Did Davers ask you...

225
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,760
what the weekend
research project was?

226
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,320
Uh-uh.

227
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,680
Good.
Nobody knows but you and me.

228
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,960
You and me, Senator.

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,080
That's good.

230
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,280
Here's a couple of pictures
of the person.

231
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,880
Give them to whomever
is gonna do the, uh...

232
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,520
- Research.
- Research.

233
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,280
This is the first time...

234
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,480
I've ever arranged
to get a guy to off a guy...

235
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,880
who I don't know who the guy is
who he's gonna off.

236
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,000
You mean, research.

237
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,320
Yeah, research a guy
who I don't know who it is.

238
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
You said
you didn't have to know.

239
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm just the liaison. I don't
want to know who this is...

240
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,280
and I don't want nobody knowin'
nothin' about me.

241
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,760
I need to talk to you,
I call Eddie Davers.

242
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,280
You need to talk to me,
you call Eddie Davers.

243
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,040
That way nobody knows nothin'.

244
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,400
- Fine.
- Except for one thing.

245
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,160
- What's that?
- I gotta know who this guy is.

246
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,000
- You just said...
- But that was in the abstract.

247
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,360
Now that we're really
doin' it...

248
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,720
and you don't tell me
who this is, and then, uh...

249
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,160
Simple math.

250
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,160
Take a look.

251
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
Excuse me.

252
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,480
What's the gag?

253
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,480
He will be arriving at LAX...

254
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,280
tomorrow night at 8:40
on American Airlines.

255
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,760
A check for the second half
of the money.

256
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,120
If I'm not dead by Monday,
I stop payment on that check.

257
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,160
Thank you for flying with us.

258
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,600
Have a pleasant stay
in Los Angeles.

259
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,560
As you exit the aircraft,
our flight agents...

260
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,080
will help direct you
to any connecting flights.

261
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,400
Oh, and have a nice day.

262
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,720
Welcome back.
Did you sleep on the plane?

263
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,240
We're running late, so let me
run through some changes.

264
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,140
By the way,
excellent work with Crockett.

265
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,000
The final haul
from the Sunday brunch is 1.1.

266
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,360
Insurance came up with 250.

267
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,920
We got two from oil, banks
are in for one and a half...

268
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,880
A.M.A. And the lawyers
came in just south of 100.

269
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,280
Gloria Allred got very excited
over your O.J. Statement.

270
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,160
Even the women have coughed up.
Came in with about 65.

271
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,880
We do have a new schedule.

272
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,800
We have a black church,
and then we have Beverly Hills.

273
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,600
He's here.

274
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,240
It'd be nice later
to have a drink with the sultan.

275
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,360
The guy is nuts.

276
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
Welcome home, Senator.

277
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,440
- What's this?
- I told you.

278
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,920
Twenty-four hours
on the campaign trail.

279
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,240
This is Gary Plunkett of C-SPAN.

280
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,160
And Fred Tinsdale
and Mimi Binder.

281
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,120
How you doing?
Mimi and I are gonna be...

282
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,960
right behind you
in the truck, Senator.

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,160
MIMl: Fred, get in the truck.

284
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,800
So, C-SPAN
is gonna be with us all night?

285
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,640
All weekend.
Tonight's installment...

286
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,320
airs tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

287
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,480
Where are we going?

288
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,600
First stop, we are going
down to South Central.

289
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,320
Did you get a copy
of the schedule?

290
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,920
We're gonna be on the go.

291
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,520
First stop is South Central and
the African-American community.

292
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
Gee, your African-American
constituents...

293
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,040
down in South Central...

294
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,800
don't forget what you've done
for them, do they?

295
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,920
Where we going?

296
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,920
Down to Grace Church.

297
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,520
- Fred.
- What?

298
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,160
Did you say
you'd covered Bulworth before?

299
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,320
Yeah.
These things go by the book.

300
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,960
Then over to Beverly Hills...

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,840
to meet some big names
in the entertainment business.

302
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,200
Scotty, how are you?

303
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,880
Vivian, Rwanda,
I didn't expect you to be here.

304
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,200
Those key chains look fantastic.

305
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,440
How you feeling, Senator?

306
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,000
Get any sleep on the plane?

307
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,560
Has Mr. Murphy
forgotten something?

308
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,640
Mr. Murphy, the senator?

309
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,800
Whoops.

310
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,520
Senator? Senator Bulworth.

311
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,640
Senator...

312
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,000
The honorable senator
from California...

313
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
the Senator
Jay Billington Bulworth.

314
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,120
- Yay!
- Yay!

315
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,360
Hey, that's a nice
little piece of timing.

316
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,440
Amen.

317
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,840
Senator, your speech, sir.

318
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,000
Amen!

319
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,840
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

320
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,960
Listen to this.
I put a little time in on this.

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,800
And at the same time,
restore its creative power...

322
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,920
to reinvigorate our society...

323
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,760
And, uh...

324
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,760
bring about a, uh, rebirth
of, uh, democracy, uh...

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,080
Any questions?

326
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,320
Nice. Less is more.

327
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,720
When the riots went down
four years ago...

328
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,480
you promised us
federal funding to rebuild.

329
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,800
What happened?

330
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,600
What happened was...

331
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,760
we all knew
that was gonna be big news...

332
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,680
so we all came down here...
Bush, Clinton, Wilson...

333
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,000
got our pictures taken, told you
what you wanted to hear...

334
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,800
and we pretty much
forgot about it.

335
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,600
Ha ha ha!

336
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,720
Did you hear that?

337
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,520
Let's see where he's going.

338
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,560
We can't get health insurance,
fire insurance, life insurance.

339
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,280
Why haven't you come out
for Senate Bill 2720?

340
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Because you haven't contributed
any money to my campaign.

341
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,080
You know how much insurance
companies come up with?

342
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,800
They depend on me
to get a bill like that...

343
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,120
and bottle it up in committee
during an election...

344
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
and then we can kill it
when you're not looking.

345
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,320
When you say "by the book",
what book would that be?

346
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,800
So the Democrats
don't care about us?

347
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,920
Isn't that obvious?

348
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,720
Half your kids are out of work
and the other half are in jail.

349
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,080
Do you see any Democrat
doing anything about it?

350
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
Certainly not me.

351
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
What are you going to do,
vote Republican?

352
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
Come on. You're not
gonna vote Republican.

353
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,360
Let's call a spade a spade.

354
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,440
I mean, you can have
a Billion Man March.

355
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
If you don't put down
that malt liquor...

356
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,840
and stop backing a running back
who stabs his wife...

357
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,560
you're never gonna
get rid of somebody like me.

358
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,600
Fire! Fire! Fire!

359
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,120
Yo, fire alarm!
Nina, let's be out.

360
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,120
Fire!

361
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,840
Right this way, Senator.

362
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,960
What are you doing?

363
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That was good.
That was really good.

364
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,000
Fire!

365
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,600
Does anybody know
where the fire actually is?

366
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,760
Where's the fire?

367
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
Does anybody know
exactly where the fire is?

368
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,240
I find it very worrying
that in 1990 Los Angeles...

369
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,520
churches are burning.

370
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,760
Smell smoke? I don't smell shit.

371
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,920
If there's a fire,
I don't know where it is.

372
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,520
We have to be running along.

373
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,680
Coming through. Thank you.

374
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,600
Hey, Senator! Listen, hon.

375
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,240
Like what she said.
We into politics.

376
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,960
We want to work
on your campaign.

377
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,160
We need some jobs volunteering.
I don't mind volunteering.

378
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,720
It's on to Beverly Hills
on our new schedule...

379
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,280
and our friends the Liebowitzes.

380
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,800
We're into
that whole political... Nina.

381
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,760
To prevent any damage
to this wonderful landmark...

382
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,240
- Yo.
- Yo. Yo to you.

383
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,000
- Later.
- I was hoping for sooner.

384
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,720
- What'd you say?
- Later is good.

385
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,000
You tryin' to mack on my sister?

386
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,120
There's no macking
going on here, young man.

387
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,840
I really think
we should be on our way.

388
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,520
We should go.

389
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,440
Feldman, my friends here
would like to volunteer.

390
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,600
What can you help us with?

391
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,240
It's a shame we didn't get
into the heart of your remarks.

392
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,240
You want to volunteer?

393
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,760
You've always had tremendous
support in this district.

394
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,080
Come on, that Nina. Woof!

395
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,360
Oh, yes.

396
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,520
Woof! Woof!

397
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,440
Never underestimate
the value of a frank exchange.

398
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
- What does "mack" mean?
- Mack?

399
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,000
Macavoy, what does mack mean?
Gary, do you know?

400
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,080
Like, "You're macking
on my sister"?

401
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,960
For you to be running
against Hugh Weldie...

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,120
who has just leapt on
the neoconservative bandwagon...

403
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,320
Uh, is your sciatic nerve
bothering you again?

404
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,560
No, no, no, I'm fine.

405
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,840
Several of our people
find Weldie's duplicity...

406
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,280
particularly, uh...

407
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,600
You've had such a tough day.

408
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,560
What do you say we get you
some downtime?

409
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,040
I could cover for you
at the Liebowitzes'.

410
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,640
- Are you kidding me?
- Absolutely.

411
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,560
After all the money
we've worked these guys for?

412
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,760
We get more money from
these jokers than the Chinese.

413
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,600
I'll tell you what.
I've got an idea. Pull over.

414
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,360
Gary, what do you say you and I
and your colleagues...

415
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,680
head on over to headquarters?

416
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,360
That is a good idea. Great.

417
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,080
Let's do that. Come on, Gar.

418
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
And we'll see you
in Beverly Hills.

419
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,520
That is a good idea.

420
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,320
Gary, this is gonna be
much better.

421
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,680
You are gonna get
a behind-the-scenes look...

422
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,360
at how a campaign
actually operates.

423
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,080
You eat on the plane, Senator?

424
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,200
No.

425
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,200
- How long since you ate?
- Wednesday.

426
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,760
Ha ha ha!

427
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,000
Pull in here, will you?
I'm starving.

428
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,520
Let's get some chicken wings.

429
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Frankly, this is getting
uncomfortable for me.

430
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,800
A third of the guests
have left already.

431
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,320
A third of the guests are drunk.

432
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,240
When do you think he'll be here?

433
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,400
I think he'll be here
any second.

434
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,520
You do?

435
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,800
He's had such a day.

436
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,880
The senator is helping
the state department...

437
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,760
work out details
on a new guarantee.

438
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
A new guarantee? I'm sorry.

439
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,160
The West Bank.
You didn't hear it from me.

440
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,280
The West Bank.

441
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,280
He'll be here any second.

442
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,680
Yo, Senator Bulworth.

443
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,440
Here we are... volunteer valets.

444
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,440
Manny and Dorothy Liebowitz.

445
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,320
Hello. It's good to see you.

446
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,880
Sid Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman
had to leave...

447
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,920
but I'm sure they'd agree
the security of the West Bank...

448
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,640
is more important
than you being on time.

449
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,080
I was just grabbing a bite.

450
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,200
Come in.

451
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,400
We'll be out shortly.

452
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,240
We can't ask the Liebowitzes
to throw open their doors...

453
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
to a national
television audience, can we?

454
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,920
Nonsense.
Mi casa es su casa, huh?

455
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,440
Yes!

456
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,600
Oh, miss, um...

457
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,880
Thank you very much.

458
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,960
Do you think those of us
in the entertainment business...

459
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,960
need government help
in determining limits...

460
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,840
on the amount
of sex and violence...

461
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,680
in today's films
and television programs?

462
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,600
You know, the funny thing
is how, uh...

463
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Lousy most of your stuff is.

464
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,320
You make violent films
and dirty films...

465
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,680
and you make family films...

466
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,520
but most of 'em
are not very good, are they?

467
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,640
It's funny
that so many smart people...

468
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,560
could work so hard and
spend all that money...

469
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,880
and make so much money on 'em...

470
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,680
What do you think it is?

471
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,920
It must be the money, huh?

472
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,240
It turns everything to crap.

473
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,960
But how much money
do you guys really need?

474
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,720
I mean...

475
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,640
you be honest with me,
and don't spare my feelings.

476
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,760
Do you have any more
of the crispy crab cakes?

477
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,280
Wait! Just wait a minute.

478
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,520
Aah!

479
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,120
Do you think
it's advisable...

480
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,760
to schedule campaign stops
with industry leaders...

481
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,000
when you have such
a low opinion of their product?

482
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,560
My guys are not stupid.

483
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,680
They always put the big Jews
on my schedule.

484
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,440
You're mostly Jews here, right?
Three out of four anyway.

485
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,640
Excuse me?

486
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,800
I bet Murphy put something bad
about Farrakhan in here for you.

487
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,240
Thank you, Senator.

488
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,840
I know I speak for you
when I say I'm energized...

489
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
by your...
this kind of give and take.

490
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,280
Can you play that
crispy crab cakes remark again?

491
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,200
Hey!

492
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,960
Oh, great.

493
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,640
I think everybody
was challenged by your candor.

494
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,520
Let Bob Dole put that
in his pipe and smoke it.

495
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,960
Just get out!
All of you are fired!

496
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,560
Fuck you! We are volunteers.

497
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,000
The senator's
gonna go to his hotel and sleep.

498
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,480
We stayed
too long already. We out!

499
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,600
- You girls want a ride?
- Yeah!

500
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,320
Get the stuff.

501
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,960
Get in the limo, big butt.

502
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,160
- That shit be awesome!
- Where we going?

503
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
Where can we drop
you young women?

504
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,600
Just take us down La Brea.
We'll take a bus.

505
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,040
No. We goin' down to Frankie's.

506
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,600
- Frankie's?
- Yeah.

507
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,880
We'll take you.

508
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,400
I don't want to go down
to no Frankie's.

509
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,400
What's Frankie's?

510
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,520
Are you trippin'?

511
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,760
Let's go, Macavoy.

512
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,960
I can't stand when people
wanna flex their authority.

513
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,360
I can't believe him
tryin' to tell us to...

514
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,680
I don't think you need
to feel badly...

515
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,680
about going to the hotel
and getting some sleep.

516
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,040
You've had a tough day.

517
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,000
Letterman
ain't no Arsenio Hall.

518
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,960
I heard that Arsenio
was a two-minute brother.

519
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,080
You buggin'.

520
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,800
I heard the head of Arsenio's
jimmy big as a apple.

521
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,440
Why don't we take a look
at that new 30-second spot?

522
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,560
My name's Jay Bulworth.

523
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,680
You don't know nothin'
about Arsenio's jimmy.

524
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,280
I got the 411
from Sanequa James.

525
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,600
- She saw it up close.
- You mean his dick?

526
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,640
I really like it
when you serve the potato salad.

527
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,800
It's very dynamic.

528
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,680
She gave him the nappy dugout.

529
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,800
Nappy dugout?

530
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,880
Man got a nine-inch jimmy.

531
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,880
But she booty ugly!

532
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Dugout, do some nappy tricks.

533
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,720
Nappy dugout.
Jimmy and the nappy dugout.

534
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
Nappy tricks.

535
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,480
- Some of the Frisbee tricks.
- Yeah.

536
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,880
Our welfare system
is out of control.

537
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,800
Ladies,
we'll just be five minutes...

538
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,480
because the senator is meeting
the cardinal in the morning.

539
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,400
If I have to meet
with the mackerel snappers...

540
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,680
can't I just dump the sultan?

541
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,000
Two seconds.
Let me make a security check.

542
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,800
Bulworth!

543
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,920
Oom boop sheh bam
oh coo-coo mop

544
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,280
Can ya sing, Bulworth?

545
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,840
Rock until you can't be a ghost.
You got to sing.

546
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,840
Be a spirit. That's how
these niggers got here.

547
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,200
Ghosts got 'em
when they touched each other.

548
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,960
Be a spirit!

549
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And the spirit will not descend
without song.

550
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,560
You got to sing, fool.

551
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,760
Don't be no ghost, Bulworth!

552
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,080
Not him. No cameras.

553
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,680
That's a tough break.

554
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,920
I thought
they'd let you follow us...

555
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,000
but the camera
must make them nervous.

556
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,080
How disappointing.

557
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,160
- He with you?
- He all right.

558
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,960
Check your weapons.

559
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,600
I don't think we have
any weapons.

560
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,920
- Expecting trouble?
- No.

561
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,880
You can't do nothin'
in five years.

562
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,080
His family owns a pork shop
for five years.

563
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,160
Go on. You're good.

564
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,600
He ain't doin' it to honor
all the subspecies of life.

565
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,000
Hey.

566
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,120
Good to see you, my friend.
That's...

567
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,360
What you said
at the church... brave.

568
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,400
If you haven't
been able to talk to me...

569
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,240
you can talk to me now.

570
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,160
- Go stand by the door.
- Why?

571
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
- Keep a look out.
- Nobody can get in.

572
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,800
Good work. Sit down.

573
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,080
Tell these niggers what's up

574
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,200
Come, come get it

575
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,640
Senator?

576
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,880
Sir, if you're having...
Excuse me.

577
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,840
I need to talk to the Senator.

578
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,120
If you're having a problem,
we should talk about it.

579
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,440
What are you concerned about?

580
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,240
I'm concerned that you told
300 people in a black church...

581
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,640
they wouldn't be a factor...

582
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,880
as long as we're controlled
by insurance.

583
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,880
I'm concerned you went to
a Beverly Hills fund-raiser...

584
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,200
and told people in entertainment
their product is lousy.

585
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,960
And, since many of them
are Jewish...

586
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,920
you thought it prudent
to mock their Jewish paranoia.

587
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,960
I'm concerned we're in a club
in Compton...

588
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,440
before the most important
campaign swing.

589
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,560
God knows what illegal activity
is taking place...

590
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,880
and you're smoking marijuana!

591
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,520
I work for you.
You call the shots...

592
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,280
but I can do my job much better
if you just tell me...

593
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,800
what is this new strategy?

594
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Have a drink, Murphy.
Live your life.

595
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,400
Bartender.

596
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,560
What the hell are you
doin' here, sugar? Chillin'?

597
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,880
God damn!
Leroy, get over here!

598
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,160
Have a drink on me, sweetness.

599
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,920
Leroy, look who's here...
Clint Eastwood! Damn!

600
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,920
- That ain't Clint Eastwood.
- What do you mean?

601
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,280
That's George Hamilton.

602
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,480
George Hamilton?

603
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,680
He got that TV show.

604
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,760
Hey, George, what's happenin'?
What's up, man?

605
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,320
God damn!

606
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,040
- He with you?
- Yeah.

607
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
What's happenin'?

608
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,000
I don't care who you
think you know. You can't enter.

609
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,200
What you doin'?

610
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,720
Senator, this is fun,
but I'm gonna tell Mac...

611
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,680
to get ready to go.

612
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,600
Put it away.

613
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,400
What's up?

614
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,720
Hi.

615
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,640
You lost, massa?

616
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,360
How you doin'?

617
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,800
This place
ain't for you, motherfucker.

618
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,720
Can we talk?

619
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,200
This place
is for our homies, real niggers.

620
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,160
- He ain't no nigger.
- I ain't no what?

621
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,440
You ain't no real nigger.

622
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
Is you a real nigger?

623
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,200
You callin' me nigger,
motherfucker?

624
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,400
Don't call me nigger,
motherfucker.

625
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,160
Would you prefer
"motherfucker", motherfucker?

626
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,600
What the fuck?
You can't call me motherfucker.

627
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,800
Shit!

628
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,520
You gotta get out of here!

629
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,440
I don't need my sister
coverin' my ass!

630
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,560
Yes, you do!

631
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,160
- Move.
- Where you goin'?

632
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,800
Get in your car and go!

633
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,080
I saw you rush your brother out.

634
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,360
That's fucked up.
He owes me money.

635
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,840
If I left him there,
you'd cap his ass.

636
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Motherfucker rip off L.D.,
he a dead-ass motherfucker.

637
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,560
I give people protection
around here. Right?

638
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,680
Mm-hmm.

639
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,360
I can give you
protection or pain.

640
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,160
It's wrong to embarrass me,
Nina...

641
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,560
wrong and detrimental
to my way of life.

642
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,640
That motherfucker owe me money.

643
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,560
I'm workin' on gettin' it.

644
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,480
I'm tired of playing with you.

645
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,520
Whenever I see you,
you say that.

646
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,120
I said I'm gonna get it.

647
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,000
The only reason his legs
ain't snapped by now...

648
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,640
is 'cause he's your brother.

649
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,120
If you fall absolute

650
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,640
I thought ya knew,
I thought ya knew

651
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,160
Bitches are hustlers, too

652
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,400
I thought ya knew

653
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,120
Now, what I really want to know

654
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,600
Is where did little Nina go?

655
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,200
I'm lookin' here,
I'm lookin' there

656
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,360
But I can't find her anywhere

657
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,240
Where, oh, where

658
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,440
Is little Nina?

659
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,640
I'm happy with Nina

660
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,760
Hello, Nina

661
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,200
Where you been-a

662
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,480
Nina, Nina

663
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,840
Nina

664
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,080
Has anybody seen 'er?

665
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,320
Nina, Nina where you been-a?

666
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,480
You're the prettiest girl

667
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,800
Leave.

668
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,040
OK, OK

669
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,440
You come downstairs,
and then we'll play

670
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,240
Excuse me.
Coming through. Sorry.

671
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,200
Damn, motherfucker,
watch yourself!

672
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,320
I am terribly...

673
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,960
You's a sorry-assed
motherfucker.

674
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

675
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
Keep walkin', bitch.

676
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,640
I'll whup your ass up,
motherfucker!

677
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,600
I'll give you five dollars
to buy a new suit, punk!

678
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,320
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

679
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,800
- He won't leave.
- He's not tired?

680
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,200
I doubt he's slept
the past five days.

681
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,040
- There's something else.
- What?

682
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,600
He's rhyming now.

683
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,480
- Rhyming?
- Rhyming.

684
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,320
He's talking in rhymes.

685
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,040
It's very, very disconcerting.

686
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,520
Yo, Nina, Nina, I'm over here

687
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,840
And this is really good
if you give it a chance

688
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,640
I never even knew
that I could dance

689
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,240
I guess some people can
and some people can't

690
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,680
But I don't even care
if I splits my pants

691
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,240
We had a neighbor
who'd lose her mind sometimes.

692
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,200
What's weird is,
when she got that way...

693
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,200
she'd only speak in song lyrics.

694
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,840
Murphy, Feldman,
you're lookin' pretty beat

695
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,120
I thought you might feel better
with some ribs to eat

696
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,520
Eat 'em, gentlemen,
you'll think they're really fine

697
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,040
And if you want a couple more,
you can get 'em anytime

698
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm incredibly frightened.

699
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,840
Hey-oh

700
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,000
Hey, hey, hey-oh

701
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,080
Hey-oh,
hey, hey, hey-oh

702
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,440
Hey, you sing, hey-oh

703
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,120
Hey, hey, hey-oh

704
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,720
Hey-oh

705
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,000
Hey, hey, hey-oh

706
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,800
Let's go, come on,
just bounce to the beat, yeah

707
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,920
Just bounce to the beat

708
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,480
Just bounce to the beat, yeah

709
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,480
That George Hamilton
sure can move.

710
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,840
Just bounce to the beat, yeah

711
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,400
I once knew a girl
named Peggy Sue

712
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,920
The only thing
that she liked to do

713
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,920
Was take the club,
get on the funk

714
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,360
All I did was jump and go

715
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,480
Hey, Lou,
look at that girl right there

716
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,920
The one with the weave
all in her hair

717
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,280
Just bounce to the beat,
yeah, yeah

718
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,280
Just bounce to the beat,
come on, come on

719
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,200
Tell that girl in the blue

720
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,520
What she got to do
to get with you

721
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,760
Come on, just,
just bounce to the beat, yeah

722
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,000
Just bounce to the...

723
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,320
Tell that girl in the big ol'...

724
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,440
Talkin' 'bout the firm

725
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,600
That is, that is,
that is, that is

726
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,800
My pops used to warn me

727
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,440
Never fall victim to the pornie

728
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,600
Keep the pussy tight

729
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,640
The... the... the pussy,
the pussy tight

730
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,960
The pussy... the pussy tight

731
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,120
That bitch

732
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
If I'm gonna fuck,
raise that dick

733
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,320
I whip my dick out... whu-whu...

734
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,040
When I whip out my dick,
I do my duty

735
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,160
Hey, guys!

736
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,440
The dick,
his dick, his dick

737
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,040
Plays that dick, that d-dick

738
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
I need some pussy

739
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,360
Some dick, dick

740
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,600
Senator Bulworth, sir?
The fund-raiser!

741
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,360
Some pussy, his dick,
some pussy, his dick

742
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,280
The Beverly Wilshire
fund-raiser starts in 5 minutes!

743
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,920
Senator, the brunch
begins in five minutes.

744
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,840
But are you up to speaking?

745
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,800
Up? What's up?

746
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,480
Perhaps Barbara Boxer
should talk.

747
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,000
It'll be fine.
Give me the speech.

748
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,280
Hey, Murphy, we had a good time.

749
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,560
You're very tired, sir.

750
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,080
Just give me the speech.

751
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,800
You girls want breakfast
at the Beverly Wilshire?

752
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,920
Where's Nina?

753
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,400
We could drop you at
that chicken and waffles place.

754
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,200
It's really yummy.
Have you ever tried it?

755
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,280
Where's Nina?

756
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,040
Nina said
she'd see you later, George.

757
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,080
- I'm comin'.
- Oh. OK.

758
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,480
I think it'll be fine.
He got it out of his system.

759
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,840
Don't worry.
I'll be fine this time.

760
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,880
You can get some sleep
at the hotel afterwards.

761
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,120
It's gonna be fine.

762
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,120
And freshen up.

763
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,200
OK, Macavoy.
Beverly Wilshire, chop chop.

764
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,440
You got nothin'
to worry about.

765
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,120
I'm tellin' you,
the man is a rock.

766
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,280
He looked in my eyes and said,
"This bill is un-American".

767
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,440
This man is granite.

768
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,280
Good. We're down 31/8, and
the bill's still in committee.

769
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,880
It never will get out.
Jay Bulworth's on this baby.

770
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,880
I'm sure all he needed
was a good meal and some sleep.

771
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,520
Senator?

772
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,400
Your speech, sir.

773
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,480
Go get 'em.

774
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,240
Hiya, Constance.

775
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,520
Good of you to show up.
Rough night at the prom?

776
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,840
We're back on track.

777
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,120
- How's Edward?
- Edgar.

778
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,480
I like Edgar.
I've always liked Edgar.

779
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,040
Knock it off.

780
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,080
Once in a generation,
if we're lucky...

781
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,000
an individual
whose life and work...

782
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,560
are the life and work
of the people he represents.

783
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,480
Such is the man
who has served the people...

784
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,880
of the state of California...

785
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Senator Jay Billington Bulworth!

786
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,040
Thank you, Bill Stone.

787
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,000
We stand on the doorstep
of a new millennium.

788
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,400
We have an obligation...

789
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,520
on one hand, to reduce...

790
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,360
Ahh...

791
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,680
Yada yada...

792
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,080
Yada yada yada.

793
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,800
It's up to the people
to decide...

794
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,640
what the state of California
and the nation will do.

795
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,560
Biddy biddy bid...
Ooh, what'll we do?

796
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,640
The nation will do

797
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,960
It's up to you. What'll we do?

798
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,280
What'll we do,
well, it's up to you

799
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,680
You know, it ain't that funny,
you contribute all my money

800
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,440
You make your contribution,
then you get your solution

801
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,680
As long as you can pay,
I'm gonna do it all your way

802
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,360
Yes, money talks,
and the people walk

803
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,480
Yeah, now let me hear ya say it,
big money

804
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,560
Whoa! Big money, big money

805
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:40,080
Big money, big money, big money

806
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,680
One man, one vote,
now is that really real?

807
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,120
The name of our game
is "Let's Make a Deal"

808
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,560
Now people got the problems,
the haves and the have-nots

809
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,880
But the ones that make me listen
pay for 30-second spots

810
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

811
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,000
Yo, Bank of America
at this table over here

812
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,640
Wells Fargo and Citibank,
you're really very dear

813
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,160
Loan billions to Mexico
and never have to fear

814
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,520
'Cause taxpayers,
taxpayers take it in the rear

815
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,320
Take it
in the rear, take it in the rear

816
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,920
Yo, over here
we've got our friends from oil

817
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,120
They don't give a shit
how much wilderness is spoiled

818
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,400
They tell us
that they're careful

819
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,560
We know that it's a lie

820
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,040
As long as we keep drivin' cars,
they let the planet die

821
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,360
Let the planet
die, let the planet die

822
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,800
Exxon, Mobil,
the Saudis in Kuwait

823
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,280
If we still got the Middle-East,
the atmosphere can wait

824
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,800
The Arabs got the oil,
we buy everything they sell

825
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,960
But if the brothers
raise the price

826
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,920
We blow 'em all to hell

827
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,880
Boom boom boom boom

828
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,000
Now let me hear ya say it

829
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,480
- Saddam
- Saddam

830
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,600
- Hussein
- Hussein

831
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,720
- Saddam
- Saddam

832
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,920
- Hussein
- Hussein

833
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,680
Mmm

834
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,800
Get me a phone number.
Dr. Morris Fishman, UCLA.

835
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,520
He's at the Department
of Psychiatry.

836
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,080
Get the number now.

837
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,280
Yo, everybody
gonna get sick someday

838
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,760
But nobody knows
how they're gonna pay

839
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,320
Healthcare, managed care, HMOs

840
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,640
Ain't gonna work,
no, sir, not those

841
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,760
'Cause the thing that's the same
in every one of these

842
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,120
Is these motherfuckers there,
the insurance companies

843
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,760
Yeah, yeah

844
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,440
You can call it single-payer
or Canadian way

845
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,080
Only socialized medicine
will ever save the day

846
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,480
Come on now,
let me hear that dirty word

847
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,880
Socialism!

848
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah

849
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,400
Now, the women in the world
is mistreated and abused

850
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,720
But when we try to fix it,
we tend to get confused

851
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,920
I got respect
from all the sisters

852
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,320
They will tell you
that's my style

853
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,640
But there's one thing
in politics

854
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,640
That always makes me smile

855
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,280
I like the pussy, the pussy,
I like it really fine

856
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
And when you be a senator,
you get it all the time

857
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,160
The young ones, the old ones,
they really like 'em all

858
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,480
And when you be in Washington,
you hardly have to call

859
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,760
The women, they love power

860
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,000
And if you don't
pull that rug out

861
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,560
No matter what they say or do,
they give you nappy dugout

862
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,240
MIMl: Now, would we be eligible
for an Emmy or a Peabody?

863
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,120
Will rap be
a regular part of your campaign?

864
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,120
A part of my campaign?

865
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,560
Now, that just sounds insane

866
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,920
- Went well, don't you think?
- Extremely.

867
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,640
Is campaign finance
reform your central issue now?

868
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,240
It's the only way to go

869
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,560
If these guys pay the piper,
then the piper does a show

870
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,040
You got that right.
Bye, fellas.

871
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,520
Wait in here.

872
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,000
I'll be right back.

873
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,600
Patricia Ireland
is expected in town.

874
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,840
Will you have a meeting
with her?

875
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,000
How does this approach sit...

876
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,000
with the National
Organization of Women?

877
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,160
- Hi.
- Hi.

878
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,920
- That speech was phat.
- "Phat"?

879
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,400
- You got a room here?
- Huh?

880
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,760
A room we can go to upstairs?

881
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,960
- A room?
- A room.

882
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,840
What do you want to do now?

883
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,320
We could proceed to
the church, then the debate...

884
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,840
or we can shut down
until the debate.

885
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
Dr. Morris Fishman
is in Paraguay.

886
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,680
- It's your call.
- My call?

887
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,360
It's my call?
I know it's my call!

888
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,280
Feldman?

889
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,600
Uh, Feldman?

890
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,120
Is Mrs. Bulworth
making the campaign swing today?

891
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,520
Yes, sir?

892
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,440
Uh, Feldman, could I
have the key to the room?

893
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,160
- The room?
- The room, upstairs.

894
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,000
Oh! Sure.

895
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,120
- Feldman?
- Yeah?

896
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,120
- Key?
- Right. Sorry.

897
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,400
You have no fear...

898
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,960
your big money sources
are gonna dry up?

899
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,160
What?

900
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,440
- Senator Bulworth?
- It's in the car.

901
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,560
The Senator needs his room key.

902
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,880
Senator, we have
to get in the car now, sir.

903
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,120
Key's in the car. Let's go.

904
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,680
Why don't you
get some sleep now?

905
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,840
Yes. Nina and I
are going up to the room.

906
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
- That's not a good idea.
- Yes, it is.

907
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,480
- You and her right now?
- Yes.

908
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,040
I've got a better idea.

909
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,120
You and I get in the limo alone
and circle back when you want.

910
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,640
Why would I do that?

911
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,120
Will the insurance industry
respond well to your remarks?

912
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,440
Senator,
where is the nappy dugout?

913
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,880
Where's the nappy dugout?

914
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,080
That's where you get the bug out

915
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,240
How are you gonna keep
the American Medical...

916
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,760
Who are the girls?

917
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,000
The girls?

918
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,600
They're friends of mine,
can't you see?

919
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,480
Feldman, Feldman,
where's that key?

920
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,840
The key's
in your hand. You got the life!

921
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,880
You got the life,
ain't it grand?

922
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,000
You got the life

923
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,960
Senator, how do you intend...

924
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,240
You got
to be a spirit, Bulworth.

925
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,320
You can't be no ghost.

926
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,960
You got it all, Bulworth.

927
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,240
Ain't life grand?

928
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Ain't it grand?

929
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,040
You got the life, man.

930
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,320
Let's go, Macavoy.
We're on the move.

931
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,400
Give me the phone.
I need Davers.

932
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,960
You got to be a spirit,
not a ghost!

933
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,760
Macavoy,
you know where Davers is?

934
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,880
No, sir.

935
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,960
Maybe he's at our next stop,
the church.

936
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,280
You've had a crushing weekend...

937
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,040
This is
Eddie Davers. Leave a message.

938
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,800
You should get some sleep.

939
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,560
Davers, this is the Senator.

940
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,360
Once you get this message...

941
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,360
call the man you introduced me
to in Washington.

942
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,760
Tell him he has to cancel
the weekend research project.

943
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,760
It's very important.
See you at the church.

944
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,080
The church in Pasadena.

945
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,960
We can drop
the young supporters off.

946
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,800
Where can we take
you young ladies?

947
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,920
We rollin' with y'all!

948
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,880
Senator, a pleasure to see you.

949
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,440
Cardinal! Yo!

950
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,520
I hope Mrs. Bulworth
isn't under the weather.

951
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,240
No. She's fine.
I'll be with you shortly.

952
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,400
Y'all got a choir
in your church?

953
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,160
I'm with the network.

954
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,520
Find Davers.

955
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,640
The weekend research project
has to be canceled.

956
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,560
Macavoy, go in there
and find Davers.

957
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
I've got to find Davers.

958
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,040
Sir, a couple of questions.

959
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:27,040
The glory of his name

960
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,200
- You see him?
- No.

961
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,560
We are honored today
by the attendance...

962
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,160
of United States Senator
Jay Billington Bulworth.

963
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,280
Let us rejoice
in his presence...

964
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,400
and sing hymn number 376.

965
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,720
Joyful, joyful

966
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,080
We adore thee

967
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,160
God of glory

968
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,600
Lord of love

969
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,040
Lord of love

970
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,360
Hearts unfold like flowers
before thee

971
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,040
- Get out of the car.
- Why?

972
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,000
I got some problems,
and you're not safe with me.

973
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,280
What does that mean?

974
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,800
Just get out of the car.

975
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,080
- You afraid of somebody?
- Yeah.

976
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,080
Kill 'em live

977
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,600
Kill 'em live

978
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,800
Kill 'em live

979
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,680
Kill 'em live

980
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,680
Kill 'em live

981
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,640
Kill 'em live

982
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,040
Kill 'em live

983
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,240
Thou our father

984
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,480
Christ our brother

985
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,880
All who live in love are thine

986
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,360
Teach us how to love each other

987
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,520
Lift us to the joy divine

988
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,160
If you're so afraid,
why don't you tell me why?

989
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,720
I can't.
I just need a guy to call a guy.

990
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,920
Call the guy yourself.

991
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,920
I don't know how.

992
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,560
Let's go back to the hotel.

993
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,480
- You liked that hotel.
- I gotta stay out of sight.

994
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,240
Kill 'em live

995
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,320
Kill 'em live

996
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,120
Kill 'em live

997
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
It is worse than arrogance.
It is contempt.

998
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,000
Contempt for the press
and for the people.

999
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,760
Have you heard a rumor that
Gephardt's looking for someone?

1000
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,040
I'm staying out of sight
until he gets back.

1001
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,520
We can wait in the car.

1002
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,080
Hi, Mimi.
We lost our ride to the debate.

1003
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,360
Can we catch a ride
with you guys?

1004
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,760
- He split with the limo?
- Yeah.

1005
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,400
So who walks in? Huey Newton.

1006
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,760
You know who Huey Newton was?

1007
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,200
A lot of people I talk to...
black, your age... don't know.

1008
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,600
Huey.

1009
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,840
Why do you think
there are no more black leaders?

1010
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,000
Some think it's because
they all got killed...

1011
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,120
but I think
it's from the decimation...

1012
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,000
of urban manufacturing bases.

1013
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,720
Senator, an optimistic,
energized population...

1014
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,200
throws up optimistic,
energized leaders.

1015
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,840
When you shift manufacturing
to the Third World...

1016
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,040
you destroy
the blue-collar core...

1017
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,320
of the black activist
population.

1018
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,320
Some people would say
the problem is cultural.

1019
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,200
But the media is controlled
by fewer and fewer people.

1020
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,400
Add to that a consumer culture
based on self-gratification...

1021
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,560
and it means nobody
wants leaders...

1022
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,000
calling for self-sacrifice.

1023
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,800
Fact is, I'm a materialist.

1024
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,240
If I look at the economy...

1025
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,120
high employment means
jobs for African-Americans.

1026
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,320
World War II meant
lots of jobs for black folks.

1027
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,840
That's what energized people
for the civil rights movement.

1028
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,720
An energized,
hopeful community...

1029
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,240
not only produces leaders,
but leaders they'll respond to.

1030
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,960
What do you think, Senator?

1031
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,680
What do you think my age is?

1032
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,800
Your age?

1033
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,880
You said black people my age.

1034
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,440
Oh. 23?

1035
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,440
Twenty-six.

1036
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,840
How old do you think I am?

1037
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,480
How old?

1038
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,760
Hmm?

1039
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,440
Sixty.

1040
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,600
My mother was a Panther.

1041
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,880
Huey Newton
fed kids on my block.

1042
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,000
Huh.

1043
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,080
Senator,
aren't you late for the debate?

1044
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,720
Davers, Davers, Davers.

1045
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,000
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

1046
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,040
I'm here.

1047
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,760
We have to call Vinnie.

1048
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,400
You know what I get
out of this place? Bupkus.

1049
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,720
Talk to you later.

1050
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,680
- Yeah?
- Vinnie, it's Nina.

1051
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,880
You a fucking bimbo?

1052
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,360
I couldn't get him
up to the room.

1053
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,480
You're incompetent.

1054
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,600
You didn't
have to push him off.

1055
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,160
You just had
to get him upstairs.

1056
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,400
I've had it with you!

1057
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,840
Vinnie, wait.

1058
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,600
You move on to plan B.

1059
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,920
What the fuck is plan B?

1060
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,320
You know plan B.
And you better get it done.

1061
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,000
You said if I got him up
to the room, I'd get 10 Gs.

1062
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,880
- Fucking bimbo!
- Vinnie.

1063
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,040
Vinnie! Davers.

1064
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,520
The Senator
wants to speak with you.

1065
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,920
Hey, Vinnie. Vinnie, my friend,
how are you?

1066
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,360
Vinnie, I'm very relieved
to get in touch with you...

1067
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,320
because we're gonna have
to call off...

1068
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,640
the weekend research project.

1069
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,800
Call it off?

1070
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,080
- That's not a problem, is it?
- Not a problem?

1071
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,240
My plans have changed.

1072
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,600
But you keep the fee.
That's not a problem, is it?

1073
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,040
No.

1074
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,160
Oh, good!

1075
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,120
Good, good, Vinnie.

1076
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,320
Let me ask you a favor.

1077
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,640
Can we keep this
just between the two of us?

1078
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,600
You and me
and whoever's doing the thing?

1079
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,440
We're gonna need a surcharge.

1080
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,560
- Fine.
- Cancellation fee.

1081
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,000
OK. Just keep the check.

1082
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,160
No. An additional 50,000.

1083
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,520
That's good.

1084
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,440
I'll send Davers over right away
with another check.

1085
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,760
Shall we consider it done?

1086
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,240
Yeah.

1087
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,720
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1088
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,680
Good. Thanks, Vinnie, thanks.

1089
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,960
You're welcome.

1090
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,760
Fuckin' crazy motherfucker.

1091
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,040
Senator, what is
a weekend research project?

1092
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,640
No, it's a... It's nothing.

1093
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,600
It's all off.

1094
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,520
That guy's nuts.

1095
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,720
I don't feel too good.

1096
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,200
Want something?

1097
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,800
Vinnie.

1098
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,320
You want something?

1099
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,240
Vinnie!

1100
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,520
I gotta go. I'm out.

1101
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,640
All right!

1102
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,360
All right!

1103
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
We're late,
we're late, we're late!

1104
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,160
For a very important debate!

1105
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,160
And I'm feeling so great
while I'm feeling my fate

1106
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,440
when I get to the gate...

1107
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,720
Senator!

1108
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,120
'Cause I got a new slate
on my plate and it's great

1109
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,040
If you want to hide,
I know a place.

1110
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,240
You think after all this crap
is over Tuesday...

1111
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,160
that maybe you could
actually, like, hang?

1112
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,200
- Hang?
- Hang out with me?

1113
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,600
Oh, hang out with you.

1114
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,080
What do you think?

1115
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,160
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1116
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,480
I got the plan.
Want to meet my family tonight?

1117
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,240
Oh, that would... That's great.

1118
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,000
That's great, that's great

1119
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,440
I got a whole new slate

1120
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,960
I get to meet the family,
I can hardly wait
