1
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,599
Or a merry Christmas.

2
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,399
THE DIFFERENCE IS
THE BONUS CHECK I'LL GET YOU

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,499
FOR EARLY DELIVERY.

4
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,032
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

5
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,399
END OF THE WEEK.

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,867
I WANT A MERRY CHRISTMAS, TOO.

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,799
NAT SOUNDED HAPPY.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,866
OH, DON'T GET CUTE.
HALLE DOWNING.

9
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,432
YOU'RE NEXT.

10
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:49,499
WHAT DID I DO?

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,699
NOTHING.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,232
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

13
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,132
YOU KNOW I'M BLOCKED.

14
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,632
YOU'RE FIVE MONTHS LATE.

15
00:00:55,633 --> 00:01:00,066
YOU OWE THE PUBLISHER
AT LEAST AN OUTLINE, OR...

16
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:03,667
THEY WILL DISCONTINUE THE
"CHRISTINA KICK-BUTT" SERIES.

17
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,299
"DISCONTINUE"?

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,066
BUT WHY?

19
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,799
FANBASE IS ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,466
ANXIOUS FOR THE NEXT BOOK.

21
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:16,499
THAT MAKES PUBLISHERS,
WELL, REACT.

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,799
THERE'S ONLY ONE FOSTER KID
SUPERHERO RIGHT NOW,

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,066
AND IF YOU WON'T DELIVER HER,

24
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,833
SOMEONE ELSE WILL CREATE ONE.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,132
LOOK AT ALL THE WORK
YOU'VE DONE.

26
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,732
YOU DON'T WANT IT
TO END, DO YOU?

27
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,799
YOU KNOW I DON'T.

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,766
THEN COME UP WITH A BOOK
SO GOOD THEY'LL WANT MORE...

29
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,699
AND I WILL BE REMINDING YOU
OF THE DEADLINE.

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,532
MM-HMM.

31
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:45,733
OKAY.

32
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:52,866
GOOD AFTERNOON.

33
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,766
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

34
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:57,366
WE ARE FINALIZING
THE DISTRIBUTION

35
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,832
OF THE BUSINESS ASSETS
IN MR. MOORE'S ESTATE,

36
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,799
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE
OUTSTANDING ISSUE TO RESOLVE.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,432
AS HIS WIDOW AND HIS MOTHER,
I THINK WE NEED YOUR HELP.

38
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,732
WHAT'S THAT?

39
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,632
WELL...

40
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:12,966
HIS DAUGHTER.

41
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,732
WHAT HAS TIFFANY DONE?

42
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,267
NOT TIFFANY.

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,132
CANDACE.

44
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,566
YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS!

45
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:25,932
YES... OH!

46
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,232
BUT DUE TO
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

47
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:31,299
AND RULES GOVERNING
HER CLOSED ADOPTION,

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,499
I CAN ONLY SHARE THAT
THOUGH HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO,

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,633
MR. MOORE DID LOCATE HER.

50
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,599
LEGALLY, SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO INITIATE CONTACT,

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,299
BUT WITH THIS NOW BEING
AN ESTATE MATTER,

52
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,766
HOWARD AUTHORIZED
OUR OFFICE TO INFORM HER

53
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,499
OF HER PENDING INTERESTS.

54
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,866
NOW, WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED
A RESPONSE FROM HER,

55
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:53,267
SO I THINK WE NEED
A PERSONAL TOUCH.

56
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,799
SHE'S A STRANGER.

57
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,099
WE... WE DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS

58
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,066
OR WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF.

59
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,499
MAYBE HER NOT RESPONDING

60
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,199
IS A SIGN TO JUST
LEAVE IT ALONE.

61
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,766
BUT SHE'S ALSO
MY FIRST GRANDCHILD,

62
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:09,599
AND I'M NOT MISSING
ANY MORE OF HER LIFE

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,399
IF THERE'S A CHANCE
TO REACH HER.

64
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,200
WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?

65
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,332
FAN MAIL.

66
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,100
FAN MAIL, FAN MAIL.

67
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,667
"LAW FIRM."

68
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,166
"AN ESTATE-RELATED MATTER.

69
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:12,533
PLEASE USE THIS TEST
TO CONFIRM LEGAL RELATIONSHIP."

70
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,667
THIS REQUIRES CHOCOLATE.

71
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,367
"I THINK YOU ARE
MY GRANDDAUGHTER."

72
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,400
COME IN.

73
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,467
HEY. HEY.

74
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:49,767
AH, MIRACLE WORKER.

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,833
STILL BLOCKED, HUH?

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,499
THIS ISN'T HALLE I KNOW.

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,732
SHE WOULD DARE SOMEONE
TO TAKE HER SERIES AWAY

78
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,899
AND MAKE THEM REGRET TRYING TO.

79
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,766
UM, LATELY I DON'T FEEL LIKE
MY USUAL SOUTHSIDE SELF.

80
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,299
OH, SHE'S STILL IN THERE.

81
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,399
YOU JUST NEED TO GET ANGRY.

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,066
HOW MANY TIMES DID
I HAVE TO MOVE YOU

83
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,766
BECAUSE YOU STOOD UP
FOR YOURSELF TOO WELL?

84
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,632
WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS
MY FAVORITE SOCIAL WORKER.

85
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:27,699
YOU ACTED AND
ASKED QUESTIONS LATER.

86
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,266
WELL...

87
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,232
HELPING KIDS FINDING
WHERE THEY BELONG

88
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,599
WAS MY PURPOSE,

89
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,899
LIKE I KNOW WRITING
THESE BOOKS IS YOURS.

90
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,632
LOOK HOW MANY CHILDREN THEY HELP

91
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:39,766
IN AND OUT OF FOSTER CARE.

92
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,566
WHAT DOES A SINGLE 30-SOMETHING

93
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:45,132
THAT'S AN-AGED OUT FOSTER KID
KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING?

94
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:48,066
HALLE, YOU ARE
A SUCCESSFUL AUTHOR

95
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:49,732
OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS.

96
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,299
THAT'S THE RESULT
OF CHOICES AND TIMING.

97
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,499
TO GET WHERE YOU ARE,

98
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,432
YOU MADE SOME GOOD CHOICES
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

99
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:59,132
"CHOICES AND TIMING."

100
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,799
THAT'S THE WAY OUT
OF MY WRITER'S BLOCK?

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,932
THAT'S PART OF IT,

102
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,299
BUT MAYBE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

103
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,399
YOU HAVE FOR THIS BOOK IS THAT
YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS

104
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,233
THAN ANSWERS ON WHAT YOU
WANT TO WRITE ABOUT.

105
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,599
ABOUT THAT...

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,233
THESE CAME IN THE MAIL.

107
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:17,066
WHAT ARE THOSE?

108
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,100
ANSWERS.

109
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,199
THEY CAME WITH LETTERS
FROM AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

110
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
AND SOMEONE THAT MAY BE
MY GRANDMOTHER.

111
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,233
THIS IS ABOUT SOMEONE'S ESTATE.

112
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,399
I KNOW.

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,632
I'VE NEVER BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH

114
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,632
TO TAKE ONE OF THOSE TESTS.

115
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,066
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.

116
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,800
THEN MAYBE YOU NEED TO DECIDE
WHICH YOU'RE MORE AFRAID OF.

117
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,466
KNOWING...

118
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:48,867
OR NOT KNOWING.

119
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,932
ALL RIGHT, INSPIRATION.

120
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:24,067
COME FIND ME.

121
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,066
"HELLO, HALLE,"

122
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,832
WE FOUND YOU!

123
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,466
I DON'T HAVE YOUR NUMBER,
SO PLEASE CALL ME.

124
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:11,366
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU!

125
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,300
"YOUR GRANDMOTHER."

126
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:29,532
UH-UH.

127
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,067
I NEED SUGAR FIRST.

128
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:40,499
<i>HELLO?</i>

129
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,932
<i>IS SOMEONE THERE?</i>

130
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,099
HI.

131
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,699
THIS... UH, THIS IS HALLE.

132
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,532
<i>OH, IT'S SO GOOD
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.</i>

133
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,233
<i>THIS IS YOUR GRANDMOTHER.</i>

134
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,399
HI.

135
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,066
I TOOK THAT DNA TEST.

136
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,566
THAT NOTE WAS FROM
MY GRANDMOTHER.

137
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:06,799
IT'S SO WEIRD TO
SAY THAT OUT LOUD.

138
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,399
SHE INVITED ME TO SPEND
CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR

139
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,366
WITH HER FAMILY.

140
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:14,533
YOU MEAN, "YOUR FAMILY."

141
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,599
THEY CONTACTED ME BECAUSE
MY FATHER DIED A FEW MONTHS AGO.

142
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,166
SWEETIE, I...

143
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,700
I'M SO SORRY.

144
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,432
I'D ALWAYS WONDERED
ABOUT FINDING MY PARENTS.

145
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:32,067
I HADN'T THOUGHT I'D BE
TOO LATE TO MEET THEM.

146
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:38,233
HALLE.

147
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:39,832
HMM?

148
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,266
YOU'RE A BIG SISTER, TOO.

149
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:43,699
I AM.

150
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,199
I HAVE TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS
AND A YOUNGER SISTER.

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,932
THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ME UNTIL
THE DNA TEST RESULTS CAME IN.

152
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,266
IN ONE DAY, I GOT MORE
ANSWERS ABOUT MYSELF

153
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,499
THAN I HAVE MY WHOLE LIFE.

154
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,066
CHOICES AND TIMING.

155
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,999
WHEN BOTH ARE RIGHT...

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,767
IT'S MAGICAL... IT'S MAGICAL.

157
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,132
IS THIS TRIP A GOOD TIME
TO TELL THEM ABOUT MY WORK?

158
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,866
I WANT THEM TO
ACCEPT ME FOR ME...

159
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,299
NOT BECAUSE I'M "H.D. MADISON."

160
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,399
WELL, THEY INVITED YOU IN
WITHOUT KNOWING WHO YOU ARE,

161
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,799
SO JUST GO WITH
YOUR INSTINCTS ON.

162
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,532
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

163
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,899
YOU KNOW I HAVE THE INSTINCT
TO SNOOP THROUGH YOUR THINGS

164
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,267
WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING.

165
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,799
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

166
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,499
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
BUT I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF

167
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,400
TO CONTACT YOUR BROTHER,
SINCE I WON'T BE HERE.

168
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:39,999
GOT YOU A NEW PHONE
FOR YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,632
TO FINALLY BRING YOU
INTO THIS CENTURY,

170
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:47,567
AND THE FIRST MESSAGE
ON IT IS FROM HIM.

171
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:54,532
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHY WE STOPPED SPEAKING.

172
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,233
MAYBE THAT MEANS IT'S THE
PERFECT TIME TO START AGAIN.

173
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,633
THESE YEARS ARE PRECIOUS,
AREN'T THEY?

174
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,899
SO, YOU'RE CAN HAVE THE
NEIGHBORHOOD CHRISTMAS

175
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,066
WE ALWAYS HAVE, BUT I THOUGHT
MAYBE WE BOTH COULD USE

176
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,833
SOME FAMILY THIS YEAR.

177
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,899

00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,433

00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,732

SO NERVOUS.

194
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,732
WELL, YOUR MEMAW THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE.

195
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:56,433
YOU KNOW, FIGURED IT'D BE BEST
TO LEAVE EVERYONE ELSE AT HOME.

196
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:01,432
SO, YOU ARE...?

197

00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,366
MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY

242
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,332

MY SON <i>LOVED</i> CHRISTMAS.

248
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,699
IT WAS HIS FAVORITE
TIME OF THE YEAR

249
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,899

00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,199

295
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,399
MAYBE STEPMOMMY-DEAREST

296
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,232
SHE WORKED AT DADDY'S COMPANY.

297
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:12,066
WERE YOU A RECEPTIONIST?

298
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,932
OR A SECRETARY?

299
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,832
I WAS VICE PRESIDENT
OF MARKETING.

300
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,166
I HIRED THE PUBLICIST

301
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:21,232
THAT, UH, PRINCESS SPOILED HERE

302
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:24,266

00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,499
NO, I WAS ADOPTED AS A BABY,

316
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,366
BUT I GREW UP IN FOSTER CARE.

317
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,366
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR YET.

318
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,566
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PARENTS?

319
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,232
I'VE HAD LOTS OF THEM,

320
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:06,432
AND A REALLY GREAT
SOCIAL WORKER NAMED EUGENE.

321
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,066
WE'RE STILL CLOSE.

322
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,067

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,366
I CAN HEAT SOMETHING UP
FOR YOU, IF YOU LIKE.

328
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,799
JUST LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING SWEET.

329
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,599
OKAY.

330
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,432
WHAT DO YOU HAVE A TASTE FOR?

331
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:12,599
SOMETHING WITH SUGAR IN IT,
ON IT, AND WITH IT.

332
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,066
WITH IT, OKAY.

333
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:17,499

SO, WHAT'S CHRISTMAS LIKE

336
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:24,932
COLD.

337
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:27,099
SNOW IS ALREADY ON THE GROUND.

338
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,832
SOME NIGHTS, IT'S
WHAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE

339
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,766
A WINTER WONDERLAND IS.

340
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,433
IS THAT SNOWMEN
IN BIG PUFFY COATS?

341
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:39,699
I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER
KIND OF CHRISTMAS.

342
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,599
I'VE SPENT ALL OF THEM THERE.

343
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,632
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT CHRISTMAS HERE.

344
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:46,766

PARENTS AND SIBLINGS.

361
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,066
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

362
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:27,566
YOU EVER GET A CHANCE
TO SPEND THOSE...

363
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,432
WINTER WONDERLAND MOMENTS
WITH ANYONE SPECIAL?

364
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,332
ONLY MY FORMER
SOCIAL WORKER, EUGENE.

365
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,632
SO, LET ME ASK YOU THIS...

366
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,100
HOW ARE YOU HANDLING FINDING
OUT ABOUT YOUR NEW FAMILY?

367
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,366
NOT KNOWING WAS MUCH EASIER.

368
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,200
EASIER, YEAH. BUT BETTER?

369
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,166
I'M NOT SURE YET.

370
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,299
DID YOU GUYS HAVE FUN?

371
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,499
HE INTRODUCED ME TO BEIGNETS.

372
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,599
OOH.

373
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,966
HE'S SUCH A FINE YOUNG MAN.

374
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:01,300
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

375
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:06,966
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

376
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:07,967
OH...

377
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:12,700
YOU LOOK SO MUCH
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

378
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,466
I'M SORRY.

379
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,932
OH, BABY, NO.

380
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,399
YOU LOOK LIKE MY SON.

381
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,333
PLEASE DON'T EVER
FEEL SORRY ABOUT THAT.

382
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,767
WHEN YOU'RE READY...

383
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,867
CALL ME "MEMAW."

384
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:39,733
GOOD NIGHT, BABY.

385
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:40,867
GOOD NIGHT.

386
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,299
EVERY YEAR, THE CHAMPION HERE

387
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,466
REPRESENTS THEIR SCHOOL
AT THE CITY-WIDE CHESS SLAM

388
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:48,799
THAT'S IN A FEW DAYS.

389
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,099
OH, OKAY.

390
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,099
IS HE THAT GOOD? OH, HE IS.

391
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,532
HE HAS A COACH AND EVERYTHING.

392
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,366
I JUST WANT HIM
TO HAVE THE BEST LIFE.

393
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,367
MM-HMM.

394
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:59,900
NOW, WITH HIS FATHER GONE...

395
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:04,066
IS ANY THE FAMILY HELPING YOU?

396
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:05,732
OH, I THANK GOD FOR MEMAW.

397
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,966
I MEAN, SHE'S A LIFESAVER.

398
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,799
BUT TIFFANY, SHE'S WRAPPED UP
IN HER OWN DADDY ISSUES,

399
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,567
AND GLENN JUST FOLLOWS HER LEAD.

400
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:18,166
HAVE YOU ASKED THEM
FOR THEIR HELP?

401
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:20,132
HAVE THEY OFFERED?

402
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,900
GOT IT.

403
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:26,066
WELL, WHAT ABOUT HOWARD?

404
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,767
WOULD YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM?

405
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:31,699
HE WAS HILARIOUS.

406
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,633
OH, WE LAUGHED SO MUCH
OVER THE YEARS.

407
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,132
HE WAS JUST SO KIND.

408
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,400
HE REALLY CARED ABOUT PEOPLE.

409
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,632
DID HOWARD TELL YOU ABOUT ME,

410
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:49,599
OR DID YOU FIND OUT
WITH EVERYONE ELSE?

411
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,066
HE DID... A FEW YEARS
AFTER WE GOT MARRIED.

412
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,432
YOU KNOW, AFTER WE
HAD DREW, HE...

413
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:57,666
IT FELT LIKE
HE WAS HOLDING BACK.

414
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:01,133
UNTIL I FINALLY ASKED HIM
ABOUT IT, AND TOLD ME.

415
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,532
HONESTLY, I DON'T...

416
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,100
THINK HE EVER GOT OVER
YOUR MOTHER AND WHAT HAPPENED.

417
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:11,832
WHY DO YOU THINK HE DIDN'T TELL

418
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,567
TIFFANY AND GLENN ABOUT ME?

419
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,466
I THINK HE WANTED TO,

420
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:21,533
BUT HE WAS WAITING
FOR THIS PERFECT MOMENT.

421
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:28,066
THERE REALLY IS NO PERFECT
MOMENT FOR THIS, IS THERE?

422
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,367
MM-MM.

423
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:35,232
AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING

424
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:37,933
TO TIFFANY AND GLENN
ABOUT ME KNOWING.

425
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:41,666
EVEN THOUGH
THEY KEEP THEIR DISTANCE,

426
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,333
I'LL ALWAYS BE
PROTECTIVE OF THEM.

427
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,967
THAT MUST BE REALLY HARD ON YOU.

428
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:52,400
SO, WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU?

429
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:59,066
UH, I'M WORKING ON A BOOK
FOR FEMALE EXECUTIVES

430
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:03,166
ABOUT WHAT TO DO
TO PLAN PROPERLY...

431
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,066
YOU KNOW, FOR CAREER AND FAMILY.

432
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:08,732
SO, YOU WANTED TO
GO BACK TO WORK?

433
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:10,666
MY ORIGINAL PLAN WAS MONTHS,

434
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,633
AND IT TURNED INTO YEARS.

435
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:17,299
SO, PLAN FOR WHEN
THE PLANS CHANGE.

436
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,733
BASICALLY. MM.

437
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:23,466
WANT ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT
WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN SO FAR?

438
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,632
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU WORK FOR A PUBLISHER.

439
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,133
YEAH. DOING WHAT, EXACTLY?

440
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:31,532
OH, UM, PROOFREADING.

441
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,733
I... I PROOF MANUSCRIPTS.

442
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:38,166
OH, WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'D KNOW WHAT YOU DO.

443
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:42,699
WELL, WHEN I'M READY TO PROOF,
I KNOW WHO TO CALL.

444
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,666
AND WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO BE HONEST WITH ME

445
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:47,767
ABOUT WHAT YOU DO,
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

446
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,832
HEY, BIG MAMA. WHAT UP, BIG SIS?

447
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,066
WHY DOES EVERY NICKNAME
FOR THE WOMEN IN YOUR LIFE

448
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,966
INCLUDE THE WORD "BIG" IN IT?

449
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:59,066
I MEAN...

450
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:00,666
YOU KNOW...

451
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,066
Y'ALL SHOULD SHOW HALLE HERE
SOME GOOD SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY

452
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,332
AND SHOW HER AROUND TOWN.

453
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,799
WE WOULD, BUT GLENN AND I WERE

454
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,432
JUST HEADED OUT SOMEWHERE.

455
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:11,066
MM-HMM.

456
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,232
IT'S FINE.

457
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,366
I'M TIRED, AND I'VE GOT TO
GET SOME WORK DONE.

458
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,399
OH, NO, NO. TAKE HALLE.

459
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,066
I MEAN, YOU GUYS SHOULD START
DOING THINGS TOGETHER...

460
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:23,666
YOU KNOW, SINCE THE DUO
IS NOW A TRIO, AND ALL.

461
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,732
FINE.

462
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,233
BUT YOU TWO ARE GONNA NEED
TO PUT ON SOME NICER CLOTHES.

463
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,899
SHE BROUGHT THAT CAR
TO SHOW MEMAW

464
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,466
HER FIRST GROWN-UP PURCHASE.

465
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:37,967
SHE KEEPS IT SPOTLESS.

466
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:44,132
THIS FOOD BETTER MAKE ME
FORGIVE HOW FAST YOU DROVE

467
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,132
THROUGH EVERYTHING
I'LL HAVE TO SEE AGAIN.

468
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:48,099
AH-AH-AH, YOU MIGHT
BE FROM CHI-TOWN,

469
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,799
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
NEW ORLEANS CUISINE, BIG SIS.

470
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,066
GLENN, DON'T MAKE ME AGREE
WITH YOUR STEPMOTHER.

471
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:55,566
ENOUGH WITH THE "BIGS."

472
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:56,700
LEAVE IT IN FRONT.

473
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:07,332
SO, YOU HUNG OUT
WITH JOAN THIS MORNING.

474
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,332
HOW WAS THAT?

475
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,533
NOT BAD.

476
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,066
WE TALKED.

477
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,066
JOAN'S HOT AND COLD.

478
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:17,599
SHE STARTS OFF HOT,

479
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,399
BUT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

480
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,899
SHE'S JUST COLD TO US.

481
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,066
HOW DID SHE GO FROM HOT TO COLD?

482
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:25,066
WHEN HER AND DADDY GOT MARRIED,

483
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,232
SHE TRIED WITH US.

484
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,066
IT WAS LIKE WE WERE A FAMILY.

485
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:29,766
BUT THEN SHE HAD DREW,

486
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:33,366
AND WE WENT FROM BEING HER KIDS
TO BEING HER STEPKIDS.

487
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,399
MM.

488
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,866
THE FIRST TIME SHE INTRODUCED US
LIKE THAT IN A STORE,

489
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:41,066
I HID IT, BUT I CRIED
THE WHOLE WAY HOME.

490
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:42,432
MM-HMM.

491
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:46,599
AND IT'S CHILDISH,
BUT I'VE BEEN DONE EVER SINCE.

492
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,899
YEAH.

493
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,466
IT FEELS LIKE WE USED TO
BE HERE ALL THE TIME

494
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,667
WHEN WE WERE KIDS,
BUT AFTER A WHILE...

495
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,932
IT JUST FELT LIKE
WE WERE IN THE WAY.

496
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,699
HAVE YOU EVER TOLD HER HOW
YOU'VE FELT ALL THESE YEARS?

497
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,332
I MEAN, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.

498
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,699
PARENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE CONSISTENT...

499
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,299
EVEN THE "STEP" ONES.

500
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,432
YEAH, WHATEVER SHE DID
OR DIDN'T DO

501
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,832
TO BE MORE INVOLVED
IN OUR LIVES,

502
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,666
IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

503
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:16,899
WITH DAD GONE, IT JUST
FEELS LIKE IT'S TOO LATE.

504
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,400
COMING FROM EXPERIENCE,
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

505
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,399
WHAT ABOUT DREW?

506
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,232
DO YOU SPEND MUCH TIME WITH HIM?

507
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,932
SHE IS A HELICOPTER.

508
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:28,099
WE SEE DREW AT THE HOUSE,
BUT REALLY,

509
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,066
IT'S SHEER MEMAW
WHO'S TAKING CARE OF HIM.

510
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:32,066
MM-HMM. TRY ASKING TO DO MORE.

511
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,532
I MEAN, WHATEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE,

512
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,967
MAYBE YOU ALL CAN START AGAIN.

513
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,932
I THINK SHE WANTS RELATIONSHIPS
WITH ALL OF YOU.

514
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,966
SHE JUST MAYBE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE TO START.

515
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:47,399
WOW.

516
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,232
YOU SPEAK JOAN.

517
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,566
YEAH, TOO BAD SHE DIDN'T KNOW

518
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,799
SHE HAD A LONG-LOST
INTERPRETER OUT THERE.

519
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,366
WELL, AC...

520
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:58,166
"WELL," WHAT?

521
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,699
NOTHING.

522
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,767
REALLY.

523
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,932
WAIT, DID JOAN KNOW ABOUT YOU?

524
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,232
LOOK, I... I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

525
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:08,899
OH, I HAVE HAD IT WITH HER.

526
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,432
I... I... TIF, JUST...

527
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:12,067
JUST SIT TIGHT. NOPE, I AM...

528
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:17,066
YOU KNEW ABOUT HALLE,
DIDN'T YOU?

529
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:19,299
IT WASN'T MY SECRET TO TELL.

530
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,432
WHY NOT?

531
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,066
YOU WEIGHED IN
ON EVERYTHING ELSE.

532
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:24,766
NO, I NEVER WEIGHED IN ON
DECISIONS THAT WEREN'T MY PLACE,

533
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:26,566
AND THIS DEFINITELY WASN'T.

534
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:28,166
YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE.

535
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,232
THAT'S ENOUGH.

536
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:34,166
YOUR FATHER IS NOT HERE
TO EXPLAIN WHY HE DID

537
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,699
OR DID NOT DO SOMETHING,

538
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,866
AND I WILL NOT HAVE YOU
TEARING INTO JOAN ABOUT IT NOW.

539
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,799
BUT, MEMAW, SHE KNEW
ABOUT HALLE!

540
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,332
SHE WAS HIS WIFE.

541
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,399
I WAS HIS MOTHER.

542
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,867
ARE YOU MAD AT ME, TOO?

543
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:55,299
YOUR FATHER WASN'T PERFECT.

544
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,299
HE DIDN'T KEEP THIS
FROM YOU TO HURT YOU.

545
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,933
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

546
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,432
LOOK, UM, SHE DIDN'T
MEAN ANY OF THAT.

547
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,932
WE WERE JUST CAUGHT OFF GUARD

548
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:09,366
BY SOME SUPER-SECRET FAMILY TEA.

549
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,166
AGAIN.

550
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,433
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, GLENN.

551
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,599
HEY, IS ANYONE
INTERESTED IN LEARNING

552
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,632
THE SICILIAN DEFENSE?

553
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:20,299
MAYBE LATER.

554
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
I NEED SOME AIR.

555
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:23,766
I'M GONNA GO FOR A WALK...

556
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:26,666
AND I HOPE I FIND
AN ICE CREAM TRUCK.

557
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:27,699
MAY I GO WITH HALLIE?

558
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,399
PLEASE? OF COURSE.

559
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,567
NOW, DON'T FORGET YOUR JACKET.

560
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:36,099
UH-UH, T-T-THERE'S NO...

561
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,399
YOU... I-I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.

562
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,066
YOU ALL JUST GO AHEAD.

563
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:41,100
GO AHEAD.

564
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,699
SO, WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

565
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,099
WELL, IF I WERE HOME,
I'D GO FOR A WALK AND...

566
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,766
HEY, HEY. HEY.

567
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,066
WHERE YOU TWO HEADED?

568
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,299
I DON'T KNOW. LET ME CHECK.

569
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,199
WELL, LOOK, UM,
CAN'T FORGET MY PHONE AGAIN.

570
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,666
TELL YOU WHAT... LET ME GRAB IT.

571
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,433
I'LL JOIN YOU. OKAY.

572
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:05,799
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

573
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,899
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF CHRISTMAS,

574
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,132
AND HALLE'S NOT
MAKING IT ANY EASIER.

575
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,299
WELL, IS SHE SUPPOSED TO?

576
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,499
SO, HALLE GETS WELCOMED

577
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,499
AND I'M STILL
THE EVIL STEPMOTHER,

578
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,600
THANKS TO TIFFANY.

579
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:22,599
I MEAN, I LOVE THEM,
BUT FOR SOME REASON,

580
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,900
THEY PULLED AWAY FROM ME
AFTER DREW CAME ALONG.

581
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,266
THEY DOTE ON HIM, SO...

582
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:32,232
IT MUST BE ME,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

583
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:34,100
WHY DON'T YOU ASK THEM?

584
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,666
GLENN DOES WHATEVER
TIFFANY TELLS HIM TO,

585
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:38,866
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

586
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:41,066
WHENEVER WE SPEAK
TO ONE ANOTHER.

587
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:43,299
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE TO
GET IN THE MIDDLE

588
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,332
OF YOU AND THE KIDS.

589
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,366
I'M ON ALL OF YOUR SIDES.

590
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,266
WELL, I THINK THAT
WE WISH SOMETIMES

591
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:51,167
THAT YOU WOULD GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

592
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,667
MM.

593
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,766
WHY DO YOU WORK FOR THIS...

594
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:11,232
WHAT I'LL CALL "SPECIAL" FAMILY?

595
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,199
WELL, THEY ARE
SPECIAL, YOU KNOW?

596
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,166
IN ALL OF THE BEST WAYS.

597
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:19,199
ONE THING YOU'RE GONNA LEARN
IS THAT FAMILIES ARE MESSY.

598
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,232
OH, I KNOW.

599
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:21,966
I'M AT A HOLIDAY EVENT
WITH MY BROTHER

600
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:24,132
WHO'S YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE MY SON.

601
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,332
I HAVE ANOTHER
BROTHER AND SISTER

602
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,699
WHO I'M SURE WISH
I DIDN'T EXIST,

603
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,399
A STEPMOTHER WHO ALSO PROBABLY
WISHES I DIDN'T EXIST,

604
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,466
AND A GRANDMOTHER
WHO'S JUST TRYING

605
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,766
TO CLEAN UP HER SON'S MESS.

606
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,599
YOU'RE NOT A MESS
SHE'S TRYING TO CLEAN UP.

607
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,132
SHE'S EXCITED YOU'RE HERE,

608
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:41,432
AND IF YOU COULD HAVE HEARD
HER PLANS FOR YOUR ARRIVAL...

609
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,232
I KNOW SHE'S TRYING.

610
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:45,566
YOU WERE COMING UP TO THE HOUSE
WHEN WE KIDNAPPED YOU.

611
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,599
WHAT DID WE KEEP YOU FROM DOING?

612
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,166
WELL, I WAS PREPPING
FOR TOMORROW...

613
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,666
WELL, SINCE I'M
GOING OUT TONIGHT.

614
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,566
OH.

615
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,266
SOMETHING FUN?

616
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:57,099
YEAH, I'M GOING TO MY FAMILY'S
HOLIDAY GUMBO COOK-OFF.

617
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,799
I'M JUDGING THIS YEAR.
THE COMPETITION IS REAL.

618
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,266
YOU KNOW, THE WINNER GETS
TO MAKE THIS YEAR'S

619
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:02,599
BIG NEW YEAR'S PIE.

620
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,066
HMM, THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOME
REAL NEW ORLEANS TO ME.

621
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:09,066
DOES IT? MM-HMM.

622
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,132
UM, WOULD YOU WANT TO GO?

623
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,866
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

624
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:15,732
DREW, THAT'S LOVELY.

625
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:17,332
WELL, IT'S FOR YOU.

626
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,566
THANK YOU.

627
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,532
I NEEDED THIS.

628
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:22,832
LET'S GET YOU BACK HOME.

629
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,932
OKAY. MERRY CHRISTMAS.

630
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,232
MAYBE I SHOULD, LIKE, QUIT CHESS

631
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,932
AND JUST FOCUS
ON MY ART BUSINESS.

632
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:30,832
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW,
LET'S JUST SEE...

633
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:33,199
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!

634
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,066
YOU LEFT HOURS AGO!

635
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,632
I CALLED YOU!

636
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,099
OH, I'M SORRY.

637
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,832
UH, MY PHONE WAS ON SILENT.

638
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,699
FIGURES.

639
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,266
MOM, WE WERE AT THE MUSEUM,

640
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:45,932
AND I MADE THIS FOR YOU.

641
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,332
THANK YOU, BABY.

642
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,966
CAN YOU TAKE IT INSIDE? O-OKAY.

643
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:51,232
I'M SORRY I WORRIED YOU.

644
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:52,666
WE WERE JUST GONNA TAKE
A WALK, BUT THEN, WE...

645
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,166
LOOK, IT WAS MY IDEA, OKAY?

646
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:57,132
WE DECIDED TO TAKE HALLE
ON A HORSE AND CARRIAGE.

647
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:59,532
YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO DREW.

648
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,666
NO, I DON'T KNOW THAT.

649
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,600
I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR FIVE MINUTES.

650
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:10,767
MM.

651
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:14,199
IS THE INVITATION
TO THE PARTY STILL OPEN?

652
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,499
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

653
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,166
OF COURSE.

654
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:20,133
COME ON.

655
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
<i>WE'RE GONNA DO A SHOUTOUT</i>

656
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:26,067
<i>TO NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA!</i>

657
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,866
WELL, NOW, WHO DO WE HAVE HERE?

658
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,466
WELL, HELLO TO YOU, TOO.

659
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:32,632
THIS MY SISTER, COREY.

660
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:34,632
COREY, THIS IS HALLE. HI, HALLE.

661
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,799
HI.

662
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,899
I WAS ABOUT TO SEND THE DOGS
TO COME AND FIND YOU.

663
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,732
AUNT JULIA'S HAD HER FOOD
HERE FOR 20 MINUTES,

664
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:44,299
AND YOU KNOW SHE LOVES TO WIN
AND HATES WAITING.

665
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,866
TOLD YOU THE COMPETITION
IS FIERCE.

666
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,066
I SEE.

667
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:49,066
I'M ALMOST AFRAID FOR YOU.

668
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,066
I AM, TOO.

669
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:52,432
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HELP HIM JUDGE IT.

670
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:54,199
THAT WAY, THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE OPINION.

671
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,632
I ENTERED, SO I CAN'T.

672
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:57,599
WHY NOT? I LOVE GUMBO.

673
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,132
OH, WELL, BABY,
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME,

674
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,466
BECAUSE ANY FRIEND OF DEVIN'S,

675
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:03,600
THAT BEAU IS FAMILY TONIGHT.

676
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,832
EVER BRING THE MOORES TO THIS?

677
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,966
THEY'VE COME,

678
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:24,200
BUT THEIR FATHER WOULD
COME MORE OFTEN.

679
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:27,099
HOW DID YOU TWO CONNECT?

680
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,599
HIS COMPANY WAS A SPONSOR
AT MY HIGH SCHOOL.

681
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,066
I CREATED SOME RECIPES

682
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:35,632
THAT HOWARD WAS
SO IMPRESSED WITH, HE...

683
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:39,199
HE DECIDED TO COVER MY TUITION
FOR CULINARY SCHOOL.

684
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,166
WOW.

685
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:43,766
HE WAS A LIFE-CHANGING
KIND OF GUY.

686
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:45,066
OH, COMPLETELY.

687
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,632
HE HIRED ME RIGHT AFTER
I GRADUATED,

688
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,366
AND I'VE BEEN
TESTING OUT RECIPES

689
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,366
ON THE MOORES EVER SINCE...

690
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:51,666
HMM.

691
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:56,732
FOR MY RESTAURANT
I WANT TO OPEN SOMEDAY.

692
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,366
OH, NICE.

693
00:33:58,367 --> 00:33:59,700
YEAH.

694
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,100
UM...

695
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,932
MAY I HAVE THIS DANCE?

696
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:10,133
YEAH.

697
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,099
DID I KEEP YOU UP AGAIN?

698
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,799
OH, NO.

699
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,099
COME, SIT WITH ME.

700
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,066
I'M JUST LOOKING
AT AN OLD PHOTO ALBUM

701
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:44,566
FROM WHEN HOWARD WAS A CHILD.

702
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:46,499
OH, WOW.

703
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,633
LOOK. OH, MY GOODNESS.

704
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:54,166
SO MUCH WAS SAID EARLIER.

705
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:59,600
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU WERE OKAY.

706
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,666
I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M FEELING.

707
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,867
MM, ASK ME ANYTHING.

708
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:17,333
DID YOU SUPPORT ME
BEING GIVEN UP?

709
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:22,166
HOWARD FELT HE WAS TOO YOUNG

710
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:26,366
AND IMMATURE TO BE A FATHER.

711
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,599
SO...

712
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,700
I DIDN'T INTERFERE.

713
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:33,967
MM-MM.

714
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,966
SO, YOU NEVER SAW ME.

715
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:41,800
NO PICTURES.

716
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,800
IF I HAD SEEN YOU...

717
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:52,400
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO LET YOU GO.

718
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,066
I WAS COMFORTED...

719
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:01,432
BELIEVING THAT...

720
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:06,200
YOU WERE ADOPTED
INTO A GOOD FAMILY.

721
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,667
I GET THAT.

722
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,832
CHRISTINA, I'M TRYING
TO SAVE YOU.

723
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,267
I JUST...

724
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,733
NEED TO FIND THE WORDS.

725
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:40,332
OH, HEY!

726
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,432
WANT TO PLAY WITH ME?

727
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:42,433
SURE.

728
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,433
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW BAD I AM.

729
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:52,067
IS IT OKAY IF I ASKED YOU
WHAT FOSTER CARE WAS LIKE?

730
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:54,399
HMMM.

731
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,866
WELL, THERE'S A BOOK SERIES

732
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,832
CALLED "CHRISTINA KICK-BUTT"...

733
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,099
I KNOW ABOUT CHRISTINA.

734
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,499
WELL, CHRISTINA TALKS
ABOUT ALL THE SKILLS

735
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,966
SHE LEARNS AT HER GROUP HOMES.

736
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:09,567
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR ME.

737
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,332
CHESS ISN'T A GAME
ABOUT ANY ONE PIECE.

738
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:26,532
EACH MOVE IS ABOUT
ALL OF THE PIECES.

739
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,566
THEY'RE CONNECTED.

740
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:33,299
SO, WHEN YOU MOVE
THE WHOLE BOARD AT ONCE,

741
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,599
YOU'RE NOT JUST A PAWN ANYMORE.

742
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,332
BE THE BOARD,

743
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,400
A-AND NOT JUST A PIECE.

744
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:43,533
HEY.

745
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:44,899
I'LL BE TAKING YOU TO PRACTICE.

746
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,067
GO AHEAD. I'LL KEEP STUDYING.

747
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,866
I'LL BE CHECKING OUT THE VENUE

748
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,566
ONCE I DROP OFF MY BABY BROTHER.

749
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,900
OKAY, BYE.

750
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:59,166
YOU'RE TAKING HIM TO PRACTICE?

751
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:00,399
YEAH.

752
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,732
YOU WERE RIGHT.

753
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:04,667
WHEN I GOT BACK, I ASKED JOAN,
AND SHE SAID, "OKAY."

754
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,700
HE'S GONNA BREAK HIS NECK.

755
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:13,799
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

756
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,499
YOU'RE GONNA FALL. NO, HE WON'T.

757
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,066
I'LL HELP HIM.

758
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,166
SEE?

759
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,733
SHE'S NOT SO BAD.

760
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,666
PRACTICALLY HAVE TO FLY

761
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,233
TO GET DREW TO PRACTICE ON TIME.

762
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:28,367
NOT LIKE SHE WAS GONNA SPEED
THE WHOLE WAY ANYWAY, RIGHT?

763
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,133
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I DID.

764
00:38:36,433 --> 00:38:37,732
DON'T YOU FORGET
NOTHING, ALL RIGHT?

765
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,066
I'M NOT.

766
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,399
YOU DON'T FORGET
THIS INGREDIENT.

767
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,766
YES.

768
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,232
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

769
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:46,832
I HAVE A GINGERBREAD RECIPE,

770
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:49,800
AND DEVIN IS PICKING UP
SOME INGREDIENTS FOR ME.

771
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,932
OH, YOU COOK DESSERTS, TOO.

772
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:55,833
HALLE, WHAT DON'T YOU DO?

773
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,066
JOAN, I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.

774
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:01,967
I SCREWED UP.

775
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:04,199
AND ABOUT DREW. IT'S FINE.

776
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,832
THE TWINS NEEDED TO
KNOW THE TRUTH,

777
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,533
AND DREW RAVED ABOUT
HOW MUCH FUN YOU ALL HAD.

778
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:12,166
SO, WE'RE OKAY?

779
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,566
OF COURSE.

780
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:16,432
I WAS THE NEW MEMBER
OF THIS FAMILY ONCE.

781
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:19,099
THE MOORES MAKE YOU
EARN YOUR SPOT,

782
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,400
ESPECIALLY TIFFANY.

783
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,299
IT'LL TAKE YEARS...
LIKE IT DID FOR ME...

784
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,799
BUT YOU'LL SETTLE INTO

785
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,933
A COMFORTABLE GROOVE EVENTUALLY.

786
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:31,499
BUT YOU'LL GET THERE FASTER

787
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,733
IF YOU'RE NOT KEEPING US
AT A DISTANCE.

788
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,199
THAT SUIT IS FIRE.

789
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,932
OH, YOU LIKE IT? MM-HMM.

790
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:42,199
I'M GOING TO A HOLIDAY LUNCHEON

791
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,466
WITH THE WIVES OF THE
EXECUTIVES AT THE COMPANY.

792
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,399
THEY NEED TO KNOW
I STILL GOT IT.

793
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,567
OKAY.

794
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,699
I WAS WONDERING WHEN
YOU WOULD FINALLY CHECK IN.

795
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,032
I'M SORRY.

796
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:06,066
IT'S BEEN A WHIRLWIND
SINCE I GOT HERE.

797
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:07,299
IT'S GOOD.

798
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,832
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THIS PHONE IS A GAME-CHANGER.

799
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,666
OH, I WOULD HAVE GOT YOU ONE
A LONG TIME AGO

800
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:13,432
IF I'D KNOWN ALL THAT.

801
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:14,966
<i>HEY, MY BROTHER AND HIS FAMILY</i>

802
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:16,532
<i>ARE COMING OVER FOR CHRISTMAS.</i>

803
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:18,166
<i>I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.</i>

804
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:21,866
GENE, HEARING ALL THIS
GOOD NEWS IS THANK YOU ENOUGH.

805
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:23,699
OH, ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

806
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,932
TELL ME ABOUT NEW ORLEANS.

807
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:28,199
ARE YOU GETTING THE ANSWERS
TO HELP UNBLOCK YOU?

808
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,132
NOT YET.

809
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:32,699
I'M REALLY SCARED.

810
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,299
I ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE DAYS
TO GET THIS IN.

811
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO

812
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:37,999
IF I CAN'T WRITE
CHRISTINA ANYMORE.

813
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,166
<i>NEVER GON' HAPPEN.</i>

814
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,833
<i>TELL ME SOMETHING HAPPIER.</i>

815
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,000
HOLD ON, GENE. COME IN!

816
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:49,266
MEMAW WANTED ME TO
MAKE SURE YOU WERE SET

817
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:51,666
FOR TONIGHT'S REVEILLON DINNER.

818
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:53,266
I'LL TRY YOU LATER.
<i>ALL RIGHT, BYE.</i>

819
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:55,366
OKAY, BYE. I'M SET.

820
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:57,266
UH, MY DRESS IS IN THE CLOSET.

821
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:59,332
OH, MAY I?

822
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,467
GO AHEAD.

823
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:05,367
OH, THIS DRESS!

824
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,199
WOW, HALLE.

825
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,100
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CAME TO SLAY.

826
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:15,599
BUT, YOU KNOW,
TONIGHT'S PARTY IS

827
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,699
AN UGLY CHRISTMAS SWEATER PARTY.

828
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,966
OH, I THOUGHT IT WAS COCKTAIL.

829
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:21,699
YEAH, WITH EVERYTHING
GOING ON THIS YEAR,

830
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,332
WE FIGURE, "LIGHTEN THE MOOD."

831
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,932
LET'S GO SHOPPING
AND GET YOU ONE.

832
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:27,299
OKAY.

833
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,532
READY WHEN YOU ARE.

834
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:30,600
OH, RIGHT NOW. OKAY, OKAY.

835
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,667
I CAN EAT A LITTLE MORE
OF THESE.

836
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:05,399
HALLE. COME, COME.

837
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,667
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO
MY OTHER GRANDDAUGHTER, HALLE.

838
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,066
EXCUSE ME.

839
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:21,799
THIS IS CONSIDERED "DRESSED UP"
IN CHICAGO.

840
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,233
WISH I COULD TRADE YOU.

841
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:33,600
YOU'RE REALLY
LIGHTING UP THE PLACE.

842
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:58,232
"HOW DO YOU ACCEPT
THAT THE FAMILY"

843
00:42:58,233 --> 00:43:05,666
YOU HAVE DREAMED OF FOR
A LIFETIME IS A NIGHTMARE?

844
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:09,600
"THIS ENTIRE MOORE
FAMILY IS FAKE."

845
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,733
HEY. THIS IS FROM DEVIN.

846
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:31,532
SO, WILL YOU TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THAT BOOK YOU MENTIONED?

847
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:33,167
I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

848
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:38,866
THANK YOU! I'LL GO READ IT NOW.

849
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:42,866
NO, THANK YOU. YOU ARE SO SWEET.

850
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:45,799
YOU MAKE THIS MUCH EASIER.

851
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,633
WELL, I TAKE BEING
A BROTHER SERIOUSLY.

852
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:03,432
YOU OWNED THAT SWEATER.

853
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,899
I HAD TO.

854
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,866
COULDN'T LET MY OPPONENTS
SEE ME BREAK DOWN.

855
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:08,166
YEAH.

856
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:11,532
SEEMS LIKE THIS FAMILY
BRINGS OUT THAT SIDE OF ME.

857
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,132
DEFIANCE?

858
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:14,567
RESILIENCE.

859
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,966
ALRIGHT. LET'S GET TO COOKING.

860
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:21,367
HERE WE GO. WE GOT
SOME APPLESAUCE.

861
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:26,833
MM.

862
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:33,666
THIS SMELLS AMAZING.

863
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,566
GIVE EUGENE ALL THE CREDIT.

864
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:38,266
I BURNED WATER BEFORE HE
AND HIS WIFE TAUGHT ME.

865
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:40,832
OH, SORRY. WE SMELLED
SOMETHING GOOD.

866
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,299
AH-AH!

867
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,699
YOU'VE EARNED WHATEVER'S
ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

868
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,199
WANT SOME?

869
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,099
YOU'RE LUCKY I'M NOT GOING
SOUTH SIDE ON YOU TONIGHT.

870
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,566
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

871
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,432
TO EMBARRASS ME IN
A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE?

872
00:44:57,433 --> 00:45:00,099
OR TO TAINT WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS FINALLY A NICE DAY

873
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,767
SPENT WITH MY NEW SISTER?

874
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:07,732
D, THIS SMELLS AMAZING, MAN.

875
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:11,532
OH, THIS ISN'T ME.
IT'S ALL HALLE.

876
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:12,966
IT'S EUGENE'S RECIPE.

877
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:14,299
HALLE.

878
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,066
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD US YOU
NEEDED APPROPRIATE ATTIRE.

879
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:20,366
YOU'VE BEEN SO TASTEFUL
IN YOUR CLOTHES UNTIL NOW.

880
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:21,732
TALK TO TIFFANY.

881
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:23,066
WHY WOULD I WEAR THAT SWEATER

882
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:25,766
WHEN I HAVE A DESIGNER
COCKTAIL DRESS IN THE CLOSET?

883
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,232
FINE, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO KEEP WORRYING ABOUT

884
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:31,132
THE NEXT UNEXPECTED THING
YOU'RE GONNA DO OR SAY.

885
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:34,566
IF YOU WANT ME TO TRUST YOU,
STOP COMING FOR ME LIKE THIS.

886
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:36,633
TRUST IS A TWO-WAY STREET.

887
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,933
MM!

888
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,700
WHO'S GOING TO START?

889
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,099
HEY.

890
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,066
NO ONE HAS EVER DARED
TO DO THAT BEFORE.

891
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:08,066
DONE WHAT?

892
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:10,067
SAY EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

893
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:16,700
AT THIS RATE, I DON'T KNOW THAT
I'LL MAKE IT TO CHRISTMAS DAY.

894
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,366
YOU WILL.

895
00:46:21,367 --> 00:46:23,966
TRUST ME.

896
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:29,666
MEMAW AND DREW, THEY'RE WORTH
PUTTING UP WITH THE CRAZY,

897
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,566
SO STAY FOR THEM.

898
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,199
HMM.

899
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,333
STAY FOR ME.

900
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,732
WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH

901
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:45,867
THIS FIRST CHRISTMAS
WITHOUT MY SON AS A FAMILY.

902
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:48,632
AM I CLEAR?

903
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:53,332
YES, MA'AM.

904
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:56,799
HALLE, COME WITH ME.

905
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,066
SHE ACTUALLY TOOK YOU SHOPPING
TO BUY THAT AWFUL SWEATER?

906
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:02,499
SHE DID.

907
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,599
I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE COMMIT
THAT HARD TO A PRANK.

908
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,067
SHE'S A PUBLICIST FOR A REASON.

909
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:14,432
JOAN'S RIGHT, THOUGH.

910
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:16,967
I AM KEEPING
SOMETHING FROM YOU...

911
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:23,499
BUT I'M ALSO KEEPING IT
FROM THE WHOLE WORLD.

912
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:29,333
I DON'T WORK FOR A PUBLISHER.
THEY KIND OF WORK FOR ME.

913
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:36,732
I WRITE UNDER
THE NAME H.D. MADISON.

914
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:39,299
YOU WRITE THE "CHRISTINA" BOOKS.

915
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,799
YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM?

916
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,499
I SIT ON THE BOARD OF A LIBRARY.

917
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,066
OF COURSE I KNOW ABOUT THEM.

918
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:49,067
THE SUPERHERO OF... FOSTER CARE.

919
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:53,299
OH, HALLE.

920
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,166
YOU SHARE YOUR PAIN
AND YOUR TRIUMPHS.

921
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:03,732
WHY NOT TELL THE WORLD
YOU'RE A WRITER?

922
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:08,266
WELL, THERE'S A SHAME
TO FEELING UNWANTED.

923
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:13,966
IT'S A SECRET THAT WALKS
INTO EVERY ROOM WITH ME.

924
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:15,700
ANONYMITY IS FREEDOM.

925
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:21,532
THANK YOU FOR
TRUSTING ME WITH THIS.

926
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:24,466
I WON'T SAY A WORD.

927
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:28,332
OH, HALLE... WOULD
YOU STOP A MINUTE?

928
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,099
IT'S LATE. I'M HEADING TO BED.

929
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,566
I EXPLODED EARLIER.

930
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,632
I DIDN'T WANT HOWARD'S
BUSINESS ASSOCIATES

931
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:37,299
BEING INTRODUCED
TO YOU THAT WAY.

932
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,600
NEITHER DID I.

933
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:42,866
WAIT, IS THIS...?

934
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:44,966
HOWARD'S OFFICE?

935
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,499
IT IS.

936
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,066
OH, HE WAS A HARD WORKER.

937
00:48:50,067 --> 00:48:54,066
HE WOULD BE IN HERE ALL HOURS
OF THE NIGHT, CREATING.

938
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:58,632
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
SOME INSPIRATION FROM THAT.

939
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:01,232
INSPIRATION.

940
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:03,732
I'M TRYING TO FIND
SOME OF THAT MYSELF.

941
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:06,299
OH, ARE YOU WORKING
ON A PROJECT?

942
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,367
YES.

943
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:12,766
RIGHT.

944
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,666
ABOUT THAT.

945
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:18,467
IS YOUR OFFER TO READ
MY WORK ON THE TABLE?

946
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:22,767
SURE.

947
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:27,199
THANKS. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.

948
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,599
THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.

949
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,866
YOU NEED ME TO COME DOWN THERE?

950
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:31,332
I MEAN, I'LL SET THEM STRAIGHT.

951
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,266
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH ALL OF THAT THIS SOON.

952
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:35,799
I HAVE TO GET THIS BOOK DONE.

953
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,066
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

954
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:39,432
NO.

955
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:41,166
<i>YOU'RE BLOCKED BECAUSE
YOU HAVEN'T DONE THE WORK</i>

956
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:42,799
<i>TO GET THE ANSWERS
THAT YOU NEED.</i>

957
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,533
<i>KEEP AT IT, AND KEEP
YOUR RIGHT HOOK READY.</i>

958
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,966
EUGENE, I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

959
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:54,799
<i>GET TO WORK.</i>

960
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,399
HI, SABRINA.

961
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,666
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU
FOREVER. I'M AT MY LIMIT, HALLE.

962
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,399
SABRINA, YOU TOLD ME TO GET
YOU PAGES BY CHRISTMAS,

963
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,832
WHICH IS STILL A FEW
DAYS AWAY, RIGHT?

964
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,999
<i>WELL, YES.</i>

965
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,066
THEN UNLESS YOU'RE
CALLING TO OFFER ME

966
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:13,599
SOME WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT,
I'D RATHER GET BACK TO WORK.

967
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,966
<i>SHE'S BACK!</i>

968
00:50:14,967 --> 00:50:16,767
THIS IS THE HALLE
I LOVE TO FIGHT FOR.

969
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:21,900
YEAH.

970
00:50:27,767 --> 00:50:30,632
IS THAT A "DEAR JOAN" LETTER?

971
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:33,499
NO, IT'S NOTHING.

972
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,566
ALRIGHT, YOU TWO.

973
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:38,732
IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS,
NOW MAKE UP.

974
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:40,032
IF NOT FOR ME, DO IT FOR MEMAW.

975
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:42,299
IF NOT FOR ME AND MEMAW,
DO IT FOR DREW, SANTA,

976
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,466
WHOEVER YOU NEED IT TO BE.

977
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:49,132
YOU FIRST.

978
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:51,332
I'M SORRY, HALLE.

979
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:54,233
THAT WAS A VERY IMMATURE
THING THAT I DID TO YOU.

980
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,767
FOR MEMAW AND DREW, THERE
WILL BE NO PAYBACK TODAY.

981
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,766
Y'ALL CAN'T FEEL
THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT?

982
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,166
SURE,

983
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:11,432
BUT I NEED TO GO PREPARE
FOR THE GREEN CARPET TOMORROW.

984
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:13,067
SHE INVITED HER GIRLFRIEND.

985
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:16,732
IF SHE'S GONNA BE IN
TOWN FOR THE EVENT,

986
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:19,066
YOU SHOULD INVITE HER TO
SPEND TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY.

987
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:21,632
NOW, SHE'S ONLY IN TOWN
TO SUPPORT THE ARTISTS

988
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:24,166
BECAUSE THEY USED
TO TOUR TOGETHER.

989
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:27,067
SHE LEAVES ON A RED-EYE
AFTER THE CHESS SLAM.

990
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:35,266
IF SHE'S COMING ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE, YOU SHOULD INVITE HER.

991
00:51:35,267 --> 00:51:36,899
I GOT ON A PLANE NOT
KNOWING ANY OF YOU,

992
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,499
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE
NERVOUS TO MEET ANYONE,

993
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,166
BUT IT FELT GOOD TO BE INVITED.

994
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,599
INVITING HER WILL
MAKE HER FEEL LIKE

995
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:47,132
YOU'RE REALLY LETTING HER IN,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

996
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:48,932
THAT IS WHAT I WANT.

997
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:50,766
THEN LISTEN TO HALLE.

998
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:52,332
AT LEAST INVITE HER
TO THE CHESS SLAM.

999
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,466
YOU CAN LET HER DECIDE
IF IT'S TOO MUCH.

1000
00:51:54,467 --> 00:51:56,732
SHE MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

1001
00:51:56,733 --> 00:52:00,399
THERE'S NO BETTER TIME TO
MAKE THIS REALLY GOOD CHOICE.

1002
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,699
MM-HMM.

1003
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,067
IT'S HER.

1004
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,332
<i>HEY, BABY.</i>

1005
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,499
<i>I ONLY GOT A SECOND.
I'M AT THE STUDIO,</i>

1006
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,866
<i>AND THE DESIGNER
SENT THE DRESSES.</i>

1007
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,632
<i>WHICH ONE AM I
WEARING TOMORROW NIGHT?</i>

1008
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:14,766
JUST BRING THEM BOTH,

1009
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:17,066
AND WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
WHEN I SEE THEM.

1010
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,766
<i>GOT IT. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.</i>

1011
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:20,932
WILL YOU COME WITH ME

1012
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,266
TO MY LITTLE BROTHER'S
CHESS SLAM?

1013
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:24,632
PLEASE. CHESS IS HIS LIFE.

1014
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:26,099
BABE?

1015
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,766
WILL YOU COME WITH ME TO
MY BROTHER'S CHESS SLAM?

1016
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:32,699
IT'S HOURS BEFORE YOUR FLIGHT.
MY WHOLE FAMILY WILL BE THERE.

1017
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,166
<i>WHICH BROTHER? THE LITTLE ONE?</i>

1018
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:39,766
<i>OH, IF IT'S HIM, YES.
GLENN? NO WAY.</i>

1019
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:42,499
YES, MY BABY BROTHER, DREW.

1020
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,799
<i>WOW.</i>

1021
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,799
<i>I FINALLY GET TO MEET
THE REST OF THE FAMILY?</i>

1022
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,466
<i>SHOOT ME THE DEETS,
I'LL BE THERE.</i>

1023
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,432
<i>I GOT TO GO, BABE.</i>

1024
00:52:52,433 --> 00:52:54,933
OKAY. <i>BYE, GLENN.</i>

1025
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,066
<i>BYE.</i>

1026
00:53:01,067 --> 00:53:03,699
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW EASY THAT WAS.

1027
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,532
YOU WERE RIGHT, HALLE.

1028
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:07,199
I HELPED TOO.

1029
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,699
WOULD YOU MIND DROPPING ME OFF

1030
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,199
AT THE STORE
ON YOUR WAY TO WORK?

1031
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,566
ONLY IF YOU MEET US
SOMEWHERE AFTER.

1032
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:14,333
OKAY, LET ME GET MY COAT.

1033
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,599
YOU MADE A MIRACLE
HAPPEN TODAY, OLDEST SISTER.

1034
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,432
TIFFANY AND PARIS
MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY,

1035
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:31,366
AND WE COULD ALL USE SOME
MORE OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

1036
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:33,299
WELL, MAYBE THIS WAS
A GIRL THING.

1037
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,299
SHE JUST NEEDED
SOME SISTERLY ADVICE.

1038
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,932
GLENN, I THINK HALLE IS RIGHT,

1039
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:39,799
AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

1040
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,066
"OLD" IS NO BETTER THAN "BIG."

1041
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:45,066
I'M GLAD IT WORKED OUT.

1042
00:53:45,067 --> 00:53:47,532
I'M STARTING TO GAIN
SOME PERSPECTIVE

1043
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:50,099
ON HOW THINGS RUN
IN THIS FAMILY.

1044
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,766
OH, LIKE WHAT?

1045
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,099
LIKE REALIZING THERE'S
A LEARNING CURVE

1046
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,599
TO BEING A SISTER.

1047
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,232
MAYBE IF WE HELP EACH OTHER,

1048
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:01,699
THE REST WILL JUST
FALL INTO PLACE.

1049
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,899
DO YOU KNOW WHY WE BROUGHT
YOU HERE TWICE NOW?

1050
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,199
BECAUSE THE FOOD IS GOOD?

1051
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,766
DADDY BROUGHT US HERE
FOR EVERY SPECIAL OCCASION.

1052
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:13,266
THIS IS ONE OF HIS
FAVORITE PLACES.

1053
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:15,199
IT'S ONE OF YOUR TRADITIONS?

1054
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,699
IT'S A DAD TRADITION.

1055
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,432
I GUESS YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT BEFORE BECAUSE...

1056
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:22,432
WE WEREN'T READY.

1057
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:23,866
I GET IT.

1058
00:54:23,867 --> 00:54:27,732
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
SOME OF HIS MANNERISMS.

1059
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:31,399
BIG TIME. Y'ALL
SMILE JUST THE SAME.

1060
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,432
SO JUST KNOW, WE KNOW
YOU'RE ONE OF US,

1061
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:36,366
EVEN IF WE DON'T ALWAYS SAY
IT, BECAUSE IT'S AWKWARD.

1062
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:37,566
YEAH.

1063
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,066
THANK YOU.

1064
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,899
THAT MEANS A LOT.

1065
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,332
NOT TO BREAK
THE MOOD OR ANYTHING,

1066
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:45,532
BUT MAY I ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT A CONCEPT YOU INSPIRED?

1067
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:48,566
I DID? WHAT WAS IT?

1068
00:54:48,567 --> 00:54:51,099
IT'S AN APP THAT CONNECTS PEOPLE
TO FAMILIES DURING THE HOLIDAYS

1069
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,099
OR WHENEVER PEOPLE ARE IN NEED
OF SOME EXTENDED FAMILY.

1070
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,932
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

1071
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:58,166
FROM COLLEGE KIDS THAT CAN'T
GET HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS

1072
00:54:58,167 --> 00:55:00,432
TO SENIORS WHO DON'T
HAVE FAMILIES...

1073
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:02,632
THERE'S A MARKET FOR THAT.

1074
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:07,233
LOOK AT YOU GUYS BUILDING
A BUSINESS IN DADDY'S HOTEL.

1075
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:10,866
ALL I KNOW IS, HOWEVER IT GOES,

1076
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:12,966
I WANT TO HANDLE ALL THE PRESS

1077
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:15,332
DEAL. OKAY.

1078
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,067
CHEERS. CHEERS.

1079
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,699
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE YOU.

1080
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,166
WELCOME. YOU ALMOST GOT LEFT.

1081
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:29,199
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOU, TOO, GLENN.

1082
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,132
MEMAW, HALLE, DEVIN,
THIS IS PARIS.

1083
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,599
PARIS, THIS IS MY FAMILY.

1084
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,466
WELCOME, PARIS.

1085
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:39,832
WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU
FROM TIFFANY AND GLENN.

1086
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,599
OH, THANK YOU.
THE PLEASURE IS MINE.

1087
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,466
AND GLENN, YOU ARE GETTING
FOUR BACKSTAGE PASSES

1088
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:49,932
TO MY NEW YEAR'S SHOW IN L.A.

1089
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:54,432
WE'LL PAUSE OUR TEASING
FOR ONE NIGHT.

1090
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:55,699
LOVE HAVING SISTERS.

1091
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,967
IF YOU'RE DONE DANCING,
WE CAN GET TO THE SLAM.

1092
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,866
TIFF TOLD ME WHAT
YOU SAID TO HER.

1093
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:07,232
I DIDN'T DO MUCH.

1094
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:10,366
SHE JUST NEEDED A LITTLE PUSH
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

1095
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,633
WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT PUSH.

1096
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,766
CHECK IT OUT! I WON!

1097
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:25,799
WOW. THIS IS AMAZING.

1098
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,966
YEAH, IT IS! CAN'T
BELIEVE I WON.

1099
00:56:28,967 --> 00:56:32,766
DID YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO
REVIEW THAT EDIT I LEFT FOR YOU?

1100
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:36,299
WHAT ARE YOU EDITING,
SISTER DEAR?

1101
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,232
GREAT. SORRY.

1102
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:43,966
HALLE IS REVIEWING
SOMETHING I'M WRITING.

1103
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,432
YOU'RE A WRITER, MAMA?

1104
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:48,599
SHE IS, AND IT'S EXCELLENT.

1105
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,299
WOW. THAT'S AWESOME, JOAN.

1106
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,366
IT'S ONLY MY FIRST CHAPTER.

1107
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:56,632
SOMETIMES THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.

1108
00:56:56,633 --> 00:57:00,400
AND YOU KNOW THIS FROM YOUR
WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE PROOFING?

1109
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,932
JOAN, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1110
00:57:08,933 --> 00:57:10,967
I AM KEEPING SOMETHING FROM YOU.

1111
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:18,099
I WRITE BOOKS.

1112
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,732
PUBLISHED BOOKS.
I'M H.D. MADISON.

1113
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:26,399
<i>THE</i> H.D. MADISON?

1114
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,266
SOLD LIKE A JILLION COPIES THAT
ARE PROBABLY GONNA BE MOVIES?

1115
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:34,932
WHY NOT JUST TELL US
YOU'RE A FAMOUS AUTHOR?

1116
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:38,599
I WANTED YOU TO GET TO KNOW
HALLE DOWNING FIRST.

1117
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,832
AND JOAN, YOUR WORK INSPIRED ME.

1118
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,766
<i>I'VE</i> EVEN BEEN TRYING
TO WRITE MY NEXT BOOK,

1119
00:57:43,767 --> 00:57:47,066
AND I NEED TO BE MORE CONFIDENT.

1120
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:50,066
SO YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT US?

1121
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:53,232
NOT ABOUT YOU, BUT INSPIRED BY.

1122
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:57,299
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, HALLE.

1123
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,966
HERE, CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH?

1124
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:01,266
SURE. YES.

1125
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:02,633
SURE.

1126
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,467
WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO SAY?

1127
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:12,966
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1128
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:15,132
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HER.

1129
00:58:15,133 --> 00:58:17,066
SHE'S BEEN LYING
TO US ALL ALONG,

1130
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:19,799
AND NOW SHE'S SECRETLY
A FAMOUS AUTHOR

1131
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,232
WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE?

1132
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:24,432
TONIGHT IS ABOUT DREW.

1133
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:27,666
LET'S HAVE OUR CELEBRATION
AS WE PLANNED.

1134
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:30,800
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY,
AND I'M TIRED.

1135
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:35,066
DREW, BABY, COME TELL ME
GOOD NIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED.

1136
00:58:35,067 --> 00:58:36,867
WELL, IMAGINE IF YOU
MADE A BOOK ABOUT ME.

1137
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,767
HE DIDN'T EVEN HEAR ME.

1138
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:45,899
YOU ALL ARE MAKING IT SO EASY
FOR HER TO BECOME A MOORE

1139
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,066
IN A WAY YOU DIDN'T FOR ME.

1140
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,133
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SAYING THIS.

1141
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,899
THANK YOU ALL
FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

1142
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,466
BEFORE EACH SEAT,
THERE IS A SEALED ENVELOPE

1143
00:59:07,467 --> 00:59:11,466
THAT CONTAINS THE SPECIFIC
DETAILS OF YOUR DISTRIBUTION.

1144
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:15,166
BUT BEFORE WE GO OVER THAT,
WE HAVE A VIDEO TO PLAY,

1145
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:18,400
SO MR. MOORE CAN EXPLAIN
SOME THINGS HIMSELF.

1146
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,866
<i>HELLO, FAMILY.</i>

1147
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:26,399
<i>DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL BE SMILING
BY THE END OF THIS.</i>

1148
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,099
<i>I DON'T WANT ANY CONFUSION
WHEN IT COMES TO MY AFFAIRS,</i>

1149
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,599
<i>SO MY ATTORNEY HAS
BEEN INSTRUCTED</i>

1150
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,866
<i>TO FOLLOW MY WISHES
TO THE LETTER...</i>

1151
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:36,632
<i>AND FOR THAT, CANDACE,
I THANK YOU.</i>

1152
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:40,066
<i>TO DREW, TIFFANY, AND
GLENN... LOVE YOU ALL.</i>

1153
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:43,499
<i>GO BE SUCCESSFUL,
TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER,</i>

1154
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,432
<i>AND KEEP DOING
ALL OUR FUN STUFF.</i>

1155
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:47,867
<i>AND BOYS, YES, TIFFANY
IS THE BOSS OF YOU GUYS.</i>

1156
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:56,166
<i>BUT THEN AGAIN, THERE IS
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS, RIGHT?</i>

1157
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:57,799
DADDY... YOU HEARD THE MAN.

1158
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,799
<i>DEVIN, MY MAN.
YOU MADE ME PROUD.</i>

1159
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,632
<i>GET THAT RESTAURANT STARTED.</i>

1160
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:10,366
<i>YOU DON'T HAVE TO NAME IT
"HOWARD'S" UNLESS YOU WANT TO</i>...

1161
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,900
<i>BUT, YOU KNOW, NO PRESSURE.</i>

1162
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:19,466
<i>MAMA, YOU GAVE ME EVERYTHING.</i>

1163
01:00:19,467 --> 01:00:22,999
<i>ALL MY SUCCESS IS YOURS, TOO.</i>

1164
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,266
<i>I KNOW YOU THINK
I SPOILED EVERYONE,</i>

1165
01:00:25,267 --> 01:00:29,832
<i>BUT WHERE DO YOU
THINK I LEARNED IT?</i>

1166
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:34,066
<i>JOAN, MY BELOVED WIFE.</i>

1167
01:00:34,067 --> 01:00:38,332
<i>I KNOW I AM AMAZING
IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE...</i>

1168
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,232
<i>HANDSOME, THOUGHTFUL,</i>

1169
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:42,666
<i>AND I GAVE THE BEST
ANNIVERSARY GIFTS,</i>

1170
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:47,999
<i>AND EVEN WHEN I FORGOT, YOU
TOOK IT OUT ON MY CREDIT CARDS.</i>

1171
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,699
<i>I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,</i>

1172
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:55,699
<i>BEING YOUR HUSBAND
MADE ME A VERY LUCKY MAN.</i>

1173
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,267
<i>I LOVE YOU, SWEETHEART.</i>

1174
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:06,466
<i>AND TO HALLE, IF YOU'RE THERE</i>...

1175
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:09,866
<i>NOT A DAY PASSED THAT
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT YOU.</i>

1176
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:14,399
<i>I PRAY THAT THE FAMILY CAN DO
FOR YOU NOW WHAT I COULDN'T,</i>

1177
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:20,099
<i>AND KNOW THIS... I'M A FAN.</i>

1178
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,732
<i>SO CHEER UP, FAMILY,</i>

1179
01:01:21,733 --> 01:01:23,799
<i>I LOVE YOU ALL, AND I KNOW</i>

1180
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,640
<i>YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
WHAT'S IN THOSE ENVELOPES.</i>

1181
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:30,833
YEAH.

1182
01:01:33,967 --> 01:01:36,766
WE HAVE COPIES OF THAT
FOR EACH OF YOU.

1183
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:40,132
PLEASE, OPEN YOUR ENVELOPES.

1184
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:44,799
YOU WILL FIND SPECIFIC DETAILS
THAT PERTAIN TO YOU PERSONALLY,

1185
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,699
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, YOU
EACH GET A SEAT ON THE BOARD

1186
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,699
WITH INVESTMENTS
AVAILABLE FOR YOU

1187
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,632
TO EACH LAUNCH A PROJECT
WITH COMPANY BACKING.

1188
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:57,166
YESSS.

1189
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:58,666
WE ALL GET THE SAME THING.

1190
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:01,066
WITH ONE EXCEPTION...

1191
01:02:01,067 --> 01:02:05,600
MRS. MOORE RECEIVES HOWARD'S
CONTROLLING COMPANY INTEREST.

1192
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:11,767
OH, I'M SORRY. I MEANT
MRS. <i>FIONA</i> MOORE.

1193
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,866
IT AN ORIGINAL CLAUSE...
EXCUSE ME.

1194
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:21,366
FROM WHEN THE COMPANY
WAS FOUNDED.

1195
01:02:21,367 --> 01:02:25,799
I UNDERSTAND.

1196
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,967
IT'S OKAY.

1197
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:32,367
IT'S ALRIGHT. IT'S OKAY.

1198
01:02:36,967 --> 01:02:40,366
GLENN. SHOW THEM WHAT YOU GOT.

1199
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:44,267
BEFORE WE GO INSIDE, I'D LIKE
TO SHOW YOU ALL WHAT I DID.

1200
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,632
OH, WOW.

1201
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:50,299
OHHHH.

1202
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,732
GLENN DESIGNED IT WITH HOWARD.

1203
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:55,799
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1204
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,299
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I DID.

1205
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,632
HOW DID HE DO THAT ON HIS PHONE?

1206
01:02:59,633 --> 01:03:01,099
BABY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1207
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,132
LOOK, WE STARTED WORKING
ON THIS LAST YEAR.

1208
01:03:02,133 --> 01:03:05,400
OH, MY GOD. WONDERFUL.

1209
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:09,666
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

1210
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:10,966
YES, BABY.

1211
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:13,733
PRETTY CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
MAKE EVERYONE FEEL BETTER.

1212
01:03:16,233 --> 01:03:18,199
I NEED TO CALL PARIS BACK,
BUT IT'S TWO HOURS

1213
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,466
EARLIER IN L.A., AND I
AM HUNGRY HERE, RIGHT NOW.

1214
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,166
HOW ABOUT PIZZA AND DESSERT?

1215
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:26,066
ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS,
I REQUIRE BOTH.

1216
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:29,966
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I ATE PIZZA.

1217
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:32,066
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

1218
01:03:32,067 --> 01:03:33,899
THE PLACE UP
THE STREET DELIVERS.

1219
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,499
OKAY. PLACE THE ORDER.

1220
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,466
IS THERE SOMETHING SWEET
WE CAN HAVE WHEN WE WAIT?

1221
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:43,100
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

1222
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:48,133
THERE'S ICE CREAM.

1223
01:03:54,067 --> 01:03:56,099
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

1224
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,632
PIZZAS WILL BE HERE
IN 30 MINUTES.

1225
01:03:58,633 --> 01:04:01,932
WE'RE HAVING A PIZZA AND ICE
CREAM PARTY, COURTESY OF HALLE.

1226
01:04:01,933 --> 01:04:04,832
YEAH! BEST IDEA EVER.

1227
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:07,832
WELL, YOU COULD HOST

1228
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:12,366
THE PIZZA AND ICE CREAM
PARTY AGAIN NEXT YEAR.

1229
01:04:12,367 --> 01:04:16,333
THAT'S A TRADITION I WOULD
LOVE PUTTING IN ROTATION.

1230
01:04:19,533 --> 01:04:22,367
WELL, I HAVE TO TEACH YOU
ALL WHAT <i>REAL</i> PIZZA IS.

1231
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,066
I'D LOVE TO...

1232
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:28,167
MEMAW.

1233
01:04:33,867 --> 01:04:36,833
GOOD NIGHT.

1234
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:42,466
WHAT DID I ALMOST
JUST CATCH YOU DOING?

1235
01:04:42,467 --> 01:04:44,566
I HAVE NO IDEA.
JUST STANDING HERE.

1236
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:47,599
UH-HUH.

1237
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,766
AH-AH-AH-AH!

1238
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:50,199
GLENN!

1239
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,166
NO GIFTS ON CHRISTMAS EVE.
MEMAW, YOU KNOW I WASN'T...

1240
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:53,899
GLENN, YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN THAT.

1241
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,699
I WASN'T DOING NOTHING.
I'M READY.

1242
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,932
WHERE ARE JOAN AND DREW?

1243
01:04:57,933 --> 01:05:01,532
LET ME GO
SEE WHAT'S KEEPING THEM.

1244
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:04,066
JOAN, YOU ALRIGHT?

1245
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:07,966
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

1246
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:09,266
COME WITH US.

1247
01:05:09,267 --> 01:05:13,932
FETE QUARTIER IS OUR
CHRISTMAS EVE TRADITION.

1248
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:16,499
I DON'T WANT TO
LEAVE YOU HERE ALONE.

1249
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,732
YOU NEED TO BE WITH YOUR FAMILY.

1250
01:05:18,733 --> 01:05:22,299
MY FAMILY.

1251
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:26,232
MEMAW, I JUST NEED A DAY OFF.

1252
01:05:26,233 --> 01:05:29,200
IF DREW IS WITH ALL OF YOU,
HE WON'T EVEN MISS ME.

1253
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:34,399
HE'S IN HIS ROOM.

1254
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:41,833
SWEETHEART, I KNOW YOU'RE
IN PAIN AND YOU'RE GRIEVING.

1255
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:47,633
WE'RE GOING TO
SET THINGS STRAIGHT.

1256
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:51,733
I PROMISE YOU.

1257
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:09,500
GIRL KNOWS HER STUFF.

1258
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:33,299
HEY, HOW WAS THE PARTY?

1259
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,466
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!

1260
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:36,699
WE PLAYED GAMES, MY FRIENDS
FROM SCHOOL CAME

1261
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,232
AND WE ATE A LOT OF PIZZA.
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE ATE

1262
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:41,066
EVERYTHING SWEET HE COULD FIND.

1263
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:45,066
GO AHEAD, GET READY FOR BED,
OKAY? BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

1264
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,232
PSHH. PSHH.

1265
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:49,366
EVERYONE ASKED ABOUT YOU.

1266
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:53,099
I JUST NEEDED SOME
TIME TO MYSELF...

1267
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,099
AND IT'S A GOOD THING, TOO,

1268
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,367
BECAUSE I FOUND SOMETHING
THAT YOU ALL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.

1269
01:07:05,233 --> 01:07:09,200
MERRY ALMOST-CHRISTMAS, HALLE.

1270
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:17,232
YEAH, YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

1271
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:19,433
YOU TOO. BYE.

1272
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:39,199
"WHO WOULD WANT TO BE
IN A FAMILY LIKE THIS?"

1273
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,499
I HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER
TO HAVE GROWN UP WITHOUT THEM.

1274
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,066
"I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO
I WOULD HAVE BECOME."

1275
01:07:45,067 --> 01:07:46,732
YOU SEE?

1276
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:48,799
YOU BROUGHT THIS
STRANGER IN HERE,

1277
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,899
AND SHE JUST WANTS
TO WRITE TRASH ABOUT US.

1278
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:56,800
JOAN, PLEASE. SHE'S HERE.
LET HER SPEAK FOR HERSELF.

1279
01:07:58,933 --> 01:08:01,666
IS THIS TRUE?

1280
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:04,166
DID YOU WRITE THAT?

1281
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,399
LET ME EXPLAIN.

1282
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,332
I KNEW YOU'D SHOW YOUR
TRUE COLORS EVENTUALLY.

1283
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,799
I TOLD YOU I'M PROTECTIVE
OF THIS FAMILY,

1284
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,199
AND WE WILL NOT
BE TRASHED IN PRINT.

1285
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,332
SO SHE SNEAKS INTO MY ROOM,
FINDS MY PRIVATE THOUGHTS,

1286
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:18,632
AND SOMEHOW I'M THE VILLAIN?

1287
01:08:18,633 --> 01:08:22,766
I DIDN'T SNEAK ANYWHERE.

1288
01:08:22,767 --> 01:08:24,467
THIS WAS STUCK TO MY PAGES.

1289
01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:31,367
SO YOU DID WRITE THOSE WORDS?

1290
01:08:34,767 --> 01:08:36,499
MM.

1291
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,233
TIFF. TIFF, BE COOL.

1292
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,132
I TOLD YOU. <i>I TOLD YOU.</i>

1293
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:45,632
I WAS ANGRY. THAT'S ALL.

1294
01:08:45,633 --> 01:08:47,099
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?

1295
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,966
WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY?

1296
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:52,932
I NEVER MEANT FOR
YOU ALL TO HEAR THAT.

1297
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:54,466
I DIDN'T WANT TO LIKE YOU.

1298
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:55,832
I LET YOU IN.

1299
01:08:55,833 --> 01:09:00,732
YOU GOT TO BE ONE OF US, AND
YOU'RE WRITING TRASH ABOUT US?

1300
01:09:00,733 --> 01:09:02,300
ABOUT MY DADDY.

1301
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:06,466
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

1302
01:09:06,467 --> 01:09:07,633
NO ONE WILL STOP YOU.

1303
01:09:33,733 --> 01:09:35,732
<i>HI, YOU'VE REACHED
DEVIN'S VOICEMAIL.</i>

1304
01:09:35,733 --> 01:09:37,432
<i>PLEASE BE SURE TO LEAVE
YOUR NAME AND YOUR NUMBER,</i>

1305
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:39,300
<i>AND I'LL BE SURE
TO RETURN YOUR CALL.</i>

1306
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,999
<i>WE WAITED FOR YOU.</i>

1307
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,266
<i>I TAKE BEING A
BROTHER VERY SERIOUSLY.</i>

1308
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:13,699
<i>I DON'T WANT TO
KEEP WORRYING ABOUT</i>

1309
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,332
<i>THE NEXT UNEXPECTED THING
YOU ARE GONNA DO OR SAY.</i>

1310
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:18,999
<i>IT'S A DAD TRADITION.</i>

1311
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,367
<i>I DIDN'T WANT TO
LIKE YOU. I LET YOU IN.</i>

1312
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,766
THANKS TO YOU, IT'S GONNA BE
A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1313
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:06,799
WELL, I GOT IT STARTED,
AND YOU KEPT IT GOING.

1314
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,132
WE CAN SHARE THE CREDIT.

1315
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:11,532
WHAT ABOUT CHRISTINA?

1316
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,966
<i>DID YOU GET IN
WHAT YOU NEEDED TO?</i>

1317
01:11:13,967 --> 01:11:15,899
I'M NOT BLOCKED ANYMORE.

1318
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,466
MY FAMILY MADE SURE I GOT

1319
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:21,099
ALL THE ANSWERS
I NEED FOR THIS BOOK.

1320
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:25,066
I'M PROUD OF YOU, BABY
GIRL. MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1321
01:11:25,067 --> 01:11:27,767
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1322
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:33,700
HALLE GOT ALL OF US GIFTS.

1323
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:40,932
MEMAW.

1324
01:11:40,933 --> 01:11:45,499
TIFF. OHH.

1325
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,199
OOH.

1326
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,866
AWW.

1327
01:11:51,867 --> 01:11:55,067
AW. LOOK.

1328
01:12:02,133 --> 01:12:04,266
HOW COOL.

1329
01:12:04,267 --> 01:12:06,499
SHE GAVE US GIFTS,

1330
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:11,332
AND BROUGHT SOME OF HER
HOMETOWN TO SHARE WITH US.

1331
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:12,799
HMM.

1332
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,433
I'M NOT OPENING MINE.

1333
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:34,932
HEY, HEY! MERRY
CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE.

1334
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:36,066
IS HALLE WITH YOU?

1335
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:38,666
NO, ISN'T SHE HERE?

1336
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:40,132
SHE LEFT.

1337
01:12:40,133 --> 01:12:43,066
HER PHONE GOES
STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL.

1338
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,332
OKAY, WELL, I'LL CALL.

1339
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:46,700
DEVIN, YOUR PHONE
IS IN THE KITCHEN.

1340
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:57,399
HOWARD WOULD BE SO
DISAPPOINTED IN US.

1341
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:02,066
HALLE GOT TIFFANY TO FINALLY
INTRODUCE US TO PARIS,

1342
01:13:02,067 --> 01:13:05,499
GLENN WORKING ON HIS APP.

1343
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:11,132
EVEN I SEE THAT I DID
NOTHING TO HELP HER, AGAIN.

1344
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:13,266
FAMILY IS SUPPOSED TO

1345
01:13:13,267 --> 01:13:15,332
GET IN THE WAY FOR EACH OTHER.

1346
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:16,632
SO SHE JUST GETS TO COME IN HERE

1347
01:13:16,633 --> 01:13:18,232
AND WRITE ALL
THOSE AWFUL THINGS?

1348
01:13:18,233 --> 01:13:20,666
OH, I'D WRITE HATEFUL
THINGS ABOUT ALL OF YOU

1349
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:22,466
IF I HAD A DIARY RIGHT NOW.

1350
01:13:22,467 --> 01:13:25,566
I JUST READ WHAT SHE WROTE.

1351
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,432
SHE THREW HER OUT OF THE HOUSE.

1352
01:13:27,433 --> 01:13:30,499
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
EVERYONE WANTED ME TO DO.

1353
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,566
YOU SAID SHE WAS GONNA PUBLISH
WHAT SHE WROTE ABOUT US.

1354
01:13:33,567 --> 01:13:39,432
AND YOU HUMILIATED HER IN FRONT
OF A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE.

1355
01:13:39,433 --> 01:13:42,432
AND JOAN, YOU THOUGHT
HER COMING HERE

1356
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:44,632
WAS GOING TO COST YOU SOMETHING.

1357
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:48,532
WELL, THE ONE YOU'RE
MAD AT IS GONE.

1358
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:49,666
HEY, UM...

1359
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:50,832
HALLE CALLED ME LATE LAST NIGHT.

1360
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,600
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP
FOR ME EITHER.

1361
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:58,500
WE KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
WE KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

1362
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,567
HALLE.

1363
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:13,832
HOW DID YOU...

1364
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:16,099
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
ANSWER YOUR CALLS, OKAY?

1365
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:19,266
I LEFT MY PHONE AT THE HOUSE
AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

1366
01:14:19,267 --> 01:14:21,066
IT ALL WENT
VERY LEFT LAST NIGHT,

1367
01:14:21,067 --> 01:14:23,799
SO I THINK I'M JUST
GONNA GO HOME.

1368
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,466
MAYBE IF I GET BACK
TO CHICAGO EARLY ENOUGH,

1369
01:14:25,467 --> 01:14:27,132
I CAN GO TO EUGENE'S DINNER.

1370
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:29,132
YEAH, BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS.

1371
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:31,366
I KNOW, BUT I MESSED
EVERYTHING UP.

1372
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:32,966
NO, YOU... NOT WITH ME.

1373
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:35,266
LOOK, HALLE, I DON'T BLAME
YOU FOR WANTING TO LEAVE.

1374
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:36,799
I DON'T, BUT...

1375
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,599
WE CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO.

1376
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,132
"WE?"

1377
01:14:41,133 --> 01:14:43,066
WAIT, HOW DID YOU EVEN
KNOW I WAS HERE?

1378
01:14:43,067 --> 01:14:44,899
TIFFANY AND GLENN TOLD ME.

1379
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,332
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE GONE

1380
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:49,232
UNTIL AFTER I LEFT
THE HOUSE THIS MORNING.

1381
01:14:49,233 --> 01:14:52,399
I THOUGHT YOU'D SPENT CHRISTMAS
MORNING WITH YOUR FAMILY.

1382
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,833
I WANTED TO SPEND
THIS ONE WITH YOU.

1383
01:14:59,733 --> 01:15:01,067
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1384
01:15:10,633 --> 01:15:13,532
CHOICES AND TIMING.

1385
01:15:13,533 --> 01:15:14,699
WHAT WAS THAT?

1386
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,766
NOTHING.

1387
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,200
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1388
01:15:42,133 --> 01:15:43,400
COME ON OUT, GUYS.

1389
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:48,333
THEY WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

1390
01:15:51,233 --> 01:15:55,066
OH, MY GOD.

1391
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:57,133
WE'RE SORRY, HALLE.

1392
01:16:00,567 --> 01:16:02,066
LET'S GO HOME.

1393
01:16:02,067 --> 01:16:05,367
YES. LET'S GO HOME.

1394
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:11,966
ON THE WAY BACK TO THE HOTEL,
TIFFANY AND I TALKED.

1395
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,732
I WASN'T EVEN AWARE
THAT I WENT FROM

1396
01:16:14,733 --> 01:16:21,132
CALLING THE TWINS MY KIDS BEFORE
DREW, TO MY STEPKIDS AFTER.

1397
01:16:21,133 --> 01:16:24,099
ME BEING...

1398
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:28,832
THAT CARELESS JUST CAUSED
THEM TO PULL AWAY FROM ME.

1399
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:31,400
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT...

1400
01:16:33,933 --> 01:16:38,567
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US
WAS MY OWN FAULT.

1401
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:42,432
HOW DO I FIX THAT?

1402
01:16:42,433 --> 01:16:44,732
TIFFANY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
THAT CANDID WITH YOU

1403
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:47,767
IF SHE WASN'T READY TO FIX IT.

1404
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:56,432
AND I WANT YOU TO
HELP ME FIGURE OUT

1405
01:16:56,433 --> 01:17:01,332
A ROLE IN THE COMPANY
THAT WILL LET YOU

1406
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:06,600
BE THERE FOR DREW, WRITE YOUR
BOOK AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT.

1407
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,932
IT'S IMPORTANT

1408
01:17:11,933 --> 01:17:16,667
THAT YOU RETURN
ON YOUR OWN TERMS.

1409
01:17:19,733 --> 01:17:25,067
SWEETHEART, YOU DESERVE IT.

1410
01:17:29,933 --> 01:17:33,266
THANK YOU, MEMAW.

1411
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:34,432
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1412
01:17:34,433 --> 01:17:36,400
OHH.

1413
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:52,732
I WANTED TO START BY SAYING
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I WROTE.

1414
01:17:52,733 --> 01:17:55,499
IT WAS IN A MOMENT OF
ANGER, AFTER I'D BEEN...

1415
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,833
OH, HALLE. WE KNOW.

1416
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,132
I HAD WRITER'S BLOCK,

1417
01:18:06,133 --> 01:18:10,199
BUT THIS FAMILY
INSPIRED ME TO WRITE

1418
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,899
WHAT MY BOOK IS REALLY
GONNA BE ABOUT.

1419
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:17,200
I'M NOT JUST A PAWN WHO GETS
MOVED FROM HOME TO HOME ANYMORE.

1420
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:24,833
SO, WHAT FINALLY GOT YOU GOING?

1421
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:31,733
ALL OF YOU HAVE TOUCHED MY
HEART IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

1422
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,832
I FEEL SO CONNECTED
TO ALL OF YOU

1423
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:40,100
IN A WAY I'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE.

1424
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,767
I'M NEW TO THE WHOLE
FAMILY THING, BUT...

1425
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:50,899
WHEN YOU HAVE ONE, YOU HOLD ON.

1426
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,099
RIGHT, MEMAW?

1427
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,900
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

1428
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,932
SO THAT'S WHAT
THE BOOK IS ABOUT...

1429
01:18:58,933 --> 01:19:03,366
HOW I FOUND MYSELF
BY FINDING YOU.

1430
01:19:03,367 --> 01:19:05,667
SOUNDS LIKE A BESTSELLER,
IF YOU ASK ME.

1431
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:13,566
WELL, BREAKFAST IS NOW
BRUNCH. LET'S EAT.

1432
01:19:13,567 --> 01:19:15,899
DEVIN, WOULD YOU MIND
HELPING ME IN THE KITCHEN?

1433
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,099
YES, MA'AM.

1434
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,500
AND I'LL GET DREW.

1435
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,599
UM, HALLE, CAN I HAVE A MOMENT?

1436
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,733
SURE.

1437
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,566
THE GIFTS THAT YOU GAVE US,
THEY WERE SO PERSONAL.

1438
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:34,466
I FIGURED YOU'D NEED
BUSINESS CARDS

1439
01:19:34,467 --> 01:19:38,166
FOR YOUR BOOK SIGNINGS
AND WHATEVER.

1440
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:41,832
WELL...

1441
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:45,899
I WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS.

1442
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,932
IT BELONGED TO YOUR FATHER.

1443
01:19:48,933 --> 01:19:51,599
AND SINCE H.D. MADISON
AND HOWARD MOORE

1444
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,266
HAVE THE SAME INITIALS,

1445
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:59,732
I FIGURED THAT BELONGED TO YOU.

1446
01:19:59,733 --> 01:20:01,832
YOU GOT A FIRST EDITION
OF MY BOOK?

1447
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:06,132
WELL, I WAS WRITING YOU A NOTE
THIS MORNING AND I FOUND IT...

1448
01:20:06,133 --> 01:20:07,900
IN HOWARD'S DESK.

1449
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,732
THANK YOU, JOAN.

1450
01:20:23,733 --> 01:20:25,967
I MEAN THAT.

1451
01:20:31,933 --> 01:20:34,699
<i>NOW</i> LET'S GO EAT.

1452
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,167
COME ON.

1453
01:20:37,633 --> 01:20:41,332
OKAY, EVERYBODY.
CHRISTMAS BRUNCH IS SERVED.

1454
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:44,299
MEMAW, ARE Y'ALL
TRYING TO GET ME FAT?

1455
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,299
I CAN'T WAIT FOR
YOU TO MEET EUGENE.

1456
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,866
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HIM.

1457
01:20:49,867 --> 01:20:52,532
I'M GLAD YOU CAME BACK. ME TOO.

1458
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:54,032
MERRY CHRISTMAS, DREW.

1459
01:20:54,033 --> 01:20:56,532
YOU'RE THE BEST CHRISTMAS
PRESENT THERE IS.

1460
01:20:56,533 --> 01:20:58,966
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1461
01:20:58,967 --> 01:21:00,532
DID YOU GET ALL 12 GIFTS?

1462
01:21:00,533 --> 01:21:01,699
'CAUSE I TOOK ALL

1463
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,299
THE HOTEL SOAPS IN MY ROOM,
IF YOU NEED THEM,

1464
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:07,066
OKAY. ALRIGHT.

1465
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:09,632
TIFF.

1466
01:21:09,633 --> 01:21:12,399
I'M SORRY.

1467
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,866
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1468
01:21:13,867 --> 01:21:16,533
TEST YOUR LUCK.

1469
01:21:21,367 --> 01:21:22,899
HALLE? HM?

1470
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,799
PARIS IS BACK IN L.A.

1471
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,166
I SENT HER A PIC OF
ME IN THIS SWEATER,

1472
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:30,266
AND SHE USED IT IN HER POST
MAKING US OFFICIAL.

1473
01:21:30,267 --> 01:21:32,167
AWW, CUTE.

1474
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:36,499
I'M GLAD WE'RE EVEN.

1475
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:40,666
THE SWEATER? NO, TIFF.
THAT'S NOT MY PAYBACK.

1476
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:42,699
WHOSE CAR DO YOU THINK
I TOOK LAST NIGHT?

1477
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:45,532
OHH. OHHH.

1478
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:49,067
AND I DROVE DOWN ALL
THE MUDDIEST ROADS I COULD FIND.

1479
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:52,366
WE CAN GET IT FROM
THE VALET LATER, IF YOU WANT.

1480
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:54,432
CHECKMATE.

1481
01:21:54,433 --> 01:21:59,532
WELL, WE SUFFERED A
MAJOR LOSS THIS YEAR,

1482
01:21:59,533 --> 01:22:03,099
AND WE RECEIVED A BIG WIN.

1483
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:06,832
WELCOME TO OUR FAMILY.

1484
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:10,566
TO HALLE.

1485
01:22:10,567 --> 01:22:12,566
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1486
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:15,299
MERRY CHRISTMAS, FAMILY.

1487
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,532
AWW. OKAY, LET'S EAT.

1488
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:19,633
NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT. WAIT, NOW.

1489
01:22:22,133 --> 01:22:25,799
THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD
WE'RE ABOUT TO RECEIVE,

1490
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,766
AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING HOWARD

1491
01:22:27,767 --> 01:22:33,699
THE WISDOM PULLING US
ALL TOGETHER AT CHRISTMAS.

1492
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:36,299
AMEN. AMEN.

1493
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,200
ALRIGHT. FIRST THINGS FIRST.
