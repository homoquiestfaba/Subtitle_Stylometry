a little housekeeping.

RONDELL: EPA has saddled them
with the whole bill

45
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,040
and given your client's
history at that site,

46
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,708
that's a real possibility.

47
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,171
- I'll take it back to them.
- Good. Tab 12, Middletown...

48
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,465
I know. I'm sorry.

49
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,134
- But they won't leave.
- Who's they?

50
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,179
I don't know.
They say they know you.

51
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,311
- Um...
- Robert Bilott?

52
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,231
Um, yes.

53
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,652
They call it a landfill.
A dump's what it is.

54
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,864
They told my brother and me
no chemicals, just trash.

55
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,198
But we ain't stupid.

56
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,034
I made them videotapes myself.
All the proof you need.

They're poisonin' the creek,
killing my animals.

- I'm in the middle of a meeting.
- So, I want a lawyer.

59
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,833
Every damn one in Parkersburg's
too yella to take my case.

60
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,626

back in there.

61

Well, I ain't scared
of nobody.

63
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,548
Okay.
Kathleen is my paralegal.

64
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,758
She's gonna give you
a directory of lawyers.

65
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,260
That's why
I called your grandma.

66
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,556
- What?
- My neighbor who tells me,

67
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,807
call Alma White.

68

Her grandson's some fancy environment
lawyer down in Cincinnati.

69
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,111
Sir, I am a corporate
defense attorney.

70
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,031
- So?
- I defend chemical companies.

71
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,992
- Well, now you can defend me.
- TOM: Rob!

72
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,245
Uh, 30 seconds, Tom.

73
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,123
- Uh, I'm sorry, Mr...
- Tennant.

74
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,250
I can offer you
a referral.

75
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,211
But I just don't see how I
can be of any help to you.

76
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,380
You can start by watching
them tapes for one thing.

77
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,965
Oh, let's go, Earl.

78
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,885
I'm sorry.
I... I wish you all the luck.

79
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,178
I don't need
your damn luck, boy!

80
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,638
- I need your help!
- TOM: Rob!

81
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,142
Come on.

82
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,401
I'm not arguing
with the overall analysis.

83
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,571
My only point is that
whatever we decide upon...

84

LAWYER: Thank you, gentlemen.

85
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,873
Do you know
where we're going?

86
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,668
There's a place
right around the corner.

87
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,836
- Yeah?
- What the hell was that all about?

88
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,423
- He knows my grandmother.
- Really?

89
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,884
Well, my mom's from
West Virginia.

90
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,844
Uh, from a town,
Parkersburg.

91
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,764

my father was Air Force.

We...
We moved around a lot,

93
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,266
but we spent
the summers there.

- Of course I am.

95
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,231
You can be
from West Virginia, Rob.

96
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,525
I won't tell anyone.

97
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,408
TOM: All right, gentlemen.
Morton's it is.

98
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,537

with us lowly associates?

99

101
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,755
We practically invented it.

102
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,048
"We?"

103
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,967
Besides, I know
a highly esteemed partner

104
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,135
who still drives American.

105
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,511
- Some real clunkers too.
- Okay,

106
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,346
yeah, but he
collects them.

107
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,140
That's different.
Like his

108

and law school.

109
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,976
- No offense.
- Are you listening to this?

110
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,394
Hey, you guys go ahead,
all right?

111
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,397
- Look, I didn't mean anything by it.
- No. I gotta make a call.

112
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,481
It's all right.
I'll see you there.

113
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,941
Okay, we'll save you
a fish log.

114
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,030
- You can be such an asshole.
- JAMES: Karla, it was a joke.

115
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,906
- KARLA: Yeah.
- JAMES: We always joke.

116
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,825

a couple of jokesters.

right now...

said, howdy, partner.

She says,
"Howdy, partner."

123
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,808
Are we ever gonna
see him again on Sundays?

124
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,935
Yes, he can still come
to Sunday dinners, Mom.

125
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,146
He's a partner,
not the President of the United States.

126
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,023
I wanna make...
Do you have my Bundt pan?

127
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,107
Returned it.

128
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,233
Where?
I looked under the counter.

129
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,694
It's the right hand cupboard,
in the plastic. Yeah.

130

we just sat down.

132
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,824
So, I gotta go.

Love to Dad.

135

Talk to you later.

136
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,913
Can you pretend to be
surprised about the cake?

137
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,331
She wants it
to be very special.

138
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,250
Oh, and the granite samples
came in.

139
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,794
Can you pick them up
on your way home tomorrow?

140
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,337
- Mmm.
- Rob?

141
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,713
Hmm? Uh, sure.

142
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,638
You okay?

143
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,098
Yes.

144
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,391
Bless us, our Lord
and thy gifts

145

from thy bounty

146

Thank you for our family.

- What on earth!

I tried to call,
but you weren't picking up.

Wilbur Tennant?

157
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,189
You do know him.

158
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,359
I don't socialize with him,
if that's what you mean.

Inez Graham owned the farm
next to his.

I used to take you and Beth
over there when you were little.

have been getting sick.

took a look around. I wondered...

- The name of the landfill again?
- Dry Run.

724
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,370
There is a man-made
chemical

725
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,624
that was invented
during the Manhattan project.

726
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,170
It repelled the elements,
especially water.

727
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:21,133
So they used it to make the first
ever waterproof coating for tanks.

728
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,593
It was indestructible.

729
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,764
Then some companies thought,
"Hey, why just the battlefield?

730
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:30,726
"Why not bring this chemical
into American homes?"

- TOM: All right. Good.

733
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,110
ROB: DuPont was one
of those companies.

734
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,406
So they took
this chemical, PFOA.

735
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,867
They renamed it C-8.

736
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,537
And they made their own
impenetrable coating,

737
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:53,248
but not for tanks. For pans.

738
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,627
They called it Teflon.

739
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:00,631
A shining symbol
of American ingenuity,

740
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,925

in Parkersburg, West Virginia.

742
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,223
But right from the start,
something wasn't right.

743
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:13,101
The men, and workers
who made Teflon

744
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,687
were coming down
with nausea, fevers.

745
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,189
DuPont wanted to know why.

746
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,526
So they laced cigarettes
with Teflon.

747
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,111
They told a group of their
workers, "Hey, smoke these."

748
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,739
DuPonters did
as they were told.

749
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,326
Almost all of those men
were hospitalized.

750
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,457
That's 1962.

751
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,962
One year after Teflon launched
and already DuPont knew.

752
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:44,258
The dust, they just sent right up the
smoke stacks, released into the air.

753
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,636
The sludge,
tossed it into the Ohio.

754
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:51,932
Or, uh, packed into drums and
chucked it into the Chesapeake.

755
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,893
But then their drums
started washing up.

756
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,813
So, DuPont starts
digging ditches

757
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,857
on the grounds
of the Washington Works plant.

758
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,192
And in those pits,
they dumped

759
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:05,863
thousands of tons
of toxic C-8 sludge and dust.

760
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,074
One of the men that they hired
to dig those ditches

761
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,827
was Wilbur Tennant's
brother Jim.

762
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,038
But they weren't the only ones
covering their tracks.

763
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:19,334
3M who pioneered these
chemicals for Scotchgard,

764
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:20,794
they were testing them
on monkeys.

765
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,754
Most of the monkeys died.

766
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,757
It wasn't like DuPont
didn't know that because

767
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,176
they were doing
their own tests on rats.

768
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,679
Watched their organs balloon.

769
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,765
Now the rats
are getting cancers.

770
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,978
Tested them on pregnant rats
and watched them give birth

771
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,355
to pups
with deformed eyes.

772
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,276
So, they yanked all the young
women off the Teflon line

773
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,028
and never told them why.

774
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:55,037
Sue Bailey's job was scrubbing
these huge steel vats

775
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,165
where they held the liquid C-8.
She was pregnant.

776
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,709
- I love you!
- Would you stop?

777
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:07,215
ROB: She gave birth to a baby with
one nostril and a deformed eye.

778
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:10,844
Remember how DuPont had seen
those deformities in the rats?

779
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:15,599
Oh, God.
What about his eyes?

780
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,226
Blue. Just like all newborns.

781
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,687
But they're normal,
the lids, the pupils?

782
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:24,232
Mr. Bilott, relax.
He's perfect.

783
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,194
Hey. Hi, Charlie.

784
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,863
ROB: So Sue goes to DuPont.

785
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,699
She says, "Why did you pull me
off the Teflon line?

786
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:38,121
"Did C-8 make my baby this
way?" "No," they tell her.

787
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:42,542
Then all of her records from
her time at Teflon disappear.

788
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:47,339
One year later,
they put all of the women back on Teflon

789
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,175
and never say a thing.

790
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:57,808
He's here.

791
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,772
ROB: DuPont knew everything.

792
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,235
They knew that the C-8
they put into the air

793
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,320
and buried into the
ground for decades

794
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,072
was causing cancers.

795
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,909
They knew that their own workers
were getting these cancers.

796
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,037
They knew that the consumers
too were being exposed

797
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:22,457
and not just in Teflon.
In paints,

798
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:27,212
in fabrics, in,
uh, raincoats, boots.

799
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,298
To this day...

800
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:36,471
ROB: For 40 years you knew
C-8 was poison.

801
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,975
You knew the "Happy Pan"
was a ticking time bomb.

802
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,103
And you knew exactly why.

803
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,522
Because C-8,
it stays in us forever.

804
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,316
Our bodies are incapable
of breaking it down.

805
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:53,196
And knowing all of this,
still you did nothing because

806
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,033
doing something,

807
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,870

put the long-term viability

808

"of this product's segment

00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,004
You were making
too much money.

810
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,133
One billion dollars a year just in
profits, just in Teflon.

811
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,971
And so you pumped
millions more pounds

812
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,224
of toxic C-8 into the air,
into the water

813
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,478
so much so you could
actually see it foam.

814
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:30,776
C-8 was everywhere. There was
nowhere left for you to contaminate.

815
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,074
And that's when
they came to Jim.

816
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:41,369
They knew he was sick and needed
the money and they needed his land.

817
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,207
And when they got it,
they dug up all the C-8

818
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:48,168
from every single pit
at Washington Works.

819
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,588
Fourteen million pounds
of toxic C-8 sludge

820
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:55,008
and they dumped it, again.
This time right up there.

But this is a civil case.
The most we can hope for is damages.

- You're right. They should.

830
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,754
And it kills me
that they won't.

831
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,383
But that would mean
going to trial

832
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,969
and proving
that C-8 killed your cows.

01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,680
And every scientist who knows
anything about any of this

already works
for these chemical companies.

835
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,393
That's not an accident, Earl.

836
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:52,149
Earl, these companies,
they have all the money all the time,

837
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,692
and they'll use it. Trust me.

838
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,569
I know. I was one of them.

839
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:59,447
You're still one of 'em.

840
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,830
You can't be serious.
You know what I put on the line here?

'cause for once in your life

Sorry, no prize. All you get is
your share of this blood money.

Start over. Give your family
a fighting chance!

01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,193
for the last 40 years.

1026
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:45,278
A class action?

1027
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,529
Let him finish.

1028
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,364
The Kigers were notified

1029
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:51,784
by their local water company
that DuPont had found

1030
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:55,663
small concentrations of C-8
in their water supply,

1031
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,206
but not to worry

1032
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,668
because those concentrations
were safe.

1033
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,671
Why?
Because DuPont said so.

1034
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,303
This is what DuPont
considers safe.

1035
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,180
That's something like
one drop of water

1036
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,349
in an Olympic size
swimming pool.

1037
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,935
In other words,
even a trace of C-8

1038
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,937
renders water unsafe.

1039
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,356
But DuPont told
the local water authority,

1040
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,482
"Don't worry.

1041
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:25,568
"Your wells have got even
less than that."

1042
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,737
- Except that was a lie.
- A lie?

1043
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,448
Yes. DuPont has been
secretly testing

1044
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,866
these wells for decades.

1045
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:34,911
They knew they had
contaminated those wells

1046
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,914
up to six times
that level.

1047
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,666
And thanks to the Tennant
case, now we know too.

1048
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,377
DAVID: Hold on. This stuff
is unregulated, right?

1049
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,004
I mean, as far as
EPA's concerned,

1050
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,131
it might as well
be rose petals.

1051
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,467
The EPA hasn't
set a standard, that's true,

1052
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,218
but DuPont did.

1053
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,263
And all the law requires
to win a case like this,

1054
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,599
is to show
that DuPont exceeded

1055
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,226
what DuPont itself
considers safe.

1056
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,603
Self-regulation.

1057
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,605
- MANAGING PARTNER: If what you're saying is right...
- It is right.

1058
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:06,067
...then why would DuPont tell this
water district anything at all?

1059
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,610
Seems to me
that they're being

1060
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,445
a good
corporate citizen here.

1061
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,865
That's how long
you have to file suit.

1062
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,575
One year from the moment

1063
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:17,203
you realize your water's
been contaminated.

1064
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:21,749
This letter looks like it's
telling people their water is safe.

1065
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:25,002
In fact, it's notifying them
that it isn't.

1066
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:26,754
DuPont has started the clock.

1067
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,255
DAVID: Smart.

1068
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:29,966
We would've
counseled that.

1069
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,093
ROB: It was sent
11 months ago.

1070
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,637
The moment they realized
we knew.

1071
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,515
In 30 days,
they're home free.

1072
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:40,184
So that's the proposed
case in brief.

1073
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,019
But there's something else
to consider.

1074
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,354
PARTNER: You think?

1075
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:44,730
Rob.

1076
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,733
C-8 bio-accumulates.
It builds up inside of us.

1077
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,403
Some class members
who aren't sick today

1078
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,114
will get sick tomorrow.

1079
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,950
We need a way to protect
them into the future.

1080
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,077
Jesus, Tom! If you're even thinking
about using medical monitoring...

1081
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,496
Hold on. Hold on.

1082
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,208
Medical monitoring
is a claim now permitted

1083
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,501
in West Virginia courts.

1084
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,545
- PARTNER: Oh, come on.
- Let's hear him out.

1085
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:10,297
It say if a company
exposes a community

1086
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,008
to something
that makes them sick,

1087
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,302
they must monitor the health
of that community indefinitely.

1088
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:19,265
Everybody get that? You're creating
liability from mere exposure.

1089
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,058
It's also unprecedented.

1090
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,269
Exactly!
Which is why not six months ago,

1091
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,021
we fought tooth and nail
against it.

1092
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,815
And you lost.
Our clients have the right

1093
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,734
to avail themselves
of the law.

1094
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,319
Potential clients.

1095
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,491
JAMES: Okay.

1096
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:41,412
I know you, Rob.
I know your passion.

1097
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,415
You got a great settlement
for your farmer.

1098
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,833
You should be proud of that.

1099
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:50,379
And perhaps as the newest
partner at this table,

1100
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,006
I should be
more circumspect.

1101
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:56,177
But what he's
proposing here is

1102
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,055
nothing less
than a shakedown

1103
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:02,141
- of an iconic American company.
- We do not represent DuPont.

1104
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,310
No, you don't
represent anyone.

1105
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,813
Is this what
we have become?

1106
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,649
Plaintiff's attorneys.
Ambulance chasers.

1107
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,651
Why don't you just admit it?
Rob, you wanna flip.

1108
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,862
You wanna take everything
that you know

1109
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:17,364
about how
chemical companies operate

1110
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,909
and turn it against DuPont.
Like an informant.

1111
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,077
- That's enough.
- JAMES: Isn't that right?

1112
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,536
- TOM: Okay!
- Isn't that right?

1113
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,996
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

1114
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:27,958
Okay, then, I...
I say we take a vote

1115
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,169
and determine whether or not

1116
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,754
we continue
in the tradition

1117
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,173
that has distinguished this
firm from everyone else...

1118
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,717
TOM: Okay, I'm running
this meeting. Okay?

1119
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:38,385
You got that?

1120
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,055
Has anyone even read
the evidence

1121
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:42,223
this man has collected?

1122
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,726
The willful negligence,
the corruption?

1123
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,187
Read it!

1124
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,856
And then tell me we should
be sitting on our asses!

1125
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:55,528
That's the reason
why Americans hate lawyers.

1126
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,365
This is the crap that fuels
the Ralph Naders of the world.

1127
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,159
We should want
to nail DuPont.

1128
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,995
All of us should!

1129
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,289
American business is better
than this, gentlemen.

1130
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:10,000
And when it's not,
we should hold them to it.

1131
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:12,169
That's how you build
faith in the system.

1132
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:16,298
We're always arguing
that companies are people.

1133
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:20,803
Well, these people
have crossed the line!

1134
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:23,597
To hell with them!

1135
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:28,811
HARRY: It may come
as a surprise

1136
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,814
to corporate defense types
like yourselves,

1137
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,774
but there's more to the law
than just flooding

1138
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,442
the other side in papers.

1139
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:38,737
From where I sit,
you have to touch people.

1140
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,407
These girls,
they handle the calls

1141
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,659
from the
class action members.

1142
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,203
And there's thousands of 'em
on any given case.

1143
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,915
And it's here that we come
to know their pain.

1144
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,542
Isn't that right, Hazel?

1145
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,920
Yes. We hear it every day

1146
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:58,174
and it's my job to make
a jury feel that pain.

1147
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,759
Not out of pity,
but out of fear.

1148
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:03,637
Whatever it is
that happened to my client,

1149
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,514
that juror has to think,

1150
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,100
"That could happen to me."

1151
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:09,685
ROB: You just
keep hammering it.

1152
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:11,937
One part per billion.
One part per billion.

1153
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,440
It's their own documents.
Their own scientists.

1154
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:15,566
HARRY: Absolutely.

1155
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,068
ROB: They set that standard,
they have to live with it.

1156
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:20,154
HARRY: Yeah, I think
we can relax, Rob,

1157
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:23,490
though, there's no way they're gonna
prevail with a motion to dismiss.

1158
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,159
This is procedural.

1159
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,411
It's nonsense.
We'll get a trial today.

1160
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,374

you guys in there.

Yes, I've heard of it.

Apologies, Your Honor,

1207
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,517

the dangers of this chemical

from the government
for a while now.

to let them off the hook

in their strategy.

Mr. Holliday, you're aware
that in 1981

1377
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:59,477
3M notified DuPont that it
had conducted studies on rats.

1378
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:00,979
And these studies showed

1379
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:04,900
that sustained C-8 exposure
can cause facial deformities?

1380
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,735
I'm not aware
of a study by 3M.

1381
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:11,406
How about DuPont's own studies that
showed the same thing in humans?

1382
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,288
That's DuPont's
pregnancy study from 1981.

1383
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,165
Does that look like
a DuPont document to you?

1384
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,333
It looks to be.

1385
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:27,047
Are you aware that DuPont has
denied that any such study

1386
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,591
ever even took place?

1387
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:33,553

has led to increased incidents

- DR. FRANK: Mr. Bilott?

01:54:13,513 --> 01:54:14,681
Yes?

1707
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:17,934
I guess I should start
by apologizing for taking...

1708
01:54:18,352 --> 01:54:20,604
well, seven years to call you.

1709
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:22,689
- Who is this?
- Oh, yes, of course.

- It's Dr. Karen Frank from the...

Would just please
tell me what's happened?

What's happening?
What you've found out?

Yes. You gave us an

Of course, it does.
That's exactly what it does!
