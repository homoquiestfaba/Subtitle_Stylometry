Looking for Tommy Larabito,
he used to live here.

47
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,469
- Who are you?

00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:23,470

52
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:35,149
- Got out.

53
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:36,775
- Legally?

54
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:37,818
- I believe so.

55
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:43,157
- Wait here.

00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:48,037
(door bangs)

57
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:04,303
- Jesus fucking Christ.

58
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:05,554
What the hell are you doing here?

59
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:07,181
When did you get out?

60
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:08,474
- This morning, about ten o'clock.

61
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,142
- Why didn't you call me?
I would have picked you up.

62
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:12,853
- I tried, the phone's been disconnected.

63
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:13,729
- Didn't I give you the new number

64
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:15,481
when I wrote you last time?

65
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:18,067
- Tommy, I'm sure I would
have wrote it down if you did.

66
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,486
- At least you remembered the address.

67
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:22,112
- Tommy, I lived here for 20 years.

68
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:25,157
- I can't believe it, you look great.

69
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,909
Got a little bulk, huh?

70
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:34,249
So what do you think of my wife?

71
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,793
- She's your wife?

72
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:36,627
The blonde?

73
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:37,628
- Yeah.

74
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,047
- Shit, you never told me you got married.

75
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,840
- Hey, we all gotta go sometime.

76
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:45,594
Lorraine, where are ya?

77
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:48,430

80
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:20,379
Joey.

81
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:33,934
Lorraine, this is my kid brother.

82
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:34,977
- Glad to meet you.

83
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:37,896
Congratulations on being married.

84
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,734
- What, is there one beer left?

85
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:43,569
You didn't buy any beer?

86
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:45,988
- Not enough money for beer.

87
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,906
- Not enough money?

88
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:49,116
What did you buy?

89
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:50,242
- Food.

90
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:51,785
- [Tommy] You bought food instead of beer?

91
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:52,703
- Yeah.

92
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:54,747
- Here, kid.

93
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,540
- No Tommy, its your
last one, you have it.

94
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:58,876
- Come on, when's the
last time you had a beer?

95
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:00,502
- [Joey] Six years, I guess.

96
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:01,462
- [Tommy] Six years?

97
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,214
Come on, Take it.

98
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:06,800
- Tommy, may I speak to you for a minute?

99
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,218
Out here, please.

100
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,056
- I can't believe you're here.

101
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,644
- [Lorraine] What's he doing here?

102
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:18,771
- [Tommy] What are you talking
about, he's my brother.

103
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:20,773
- [Lorraine] I know that,
but what is he doing here?

104
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:22,441
- [Tommy] He's my brother,
what do you want me to do?

105
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:24,401
- [Lorraine] I think he wants to stay.

106
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:26,320
You know?

107
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:29,823
Find out what he wants.

108
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:32,743
(kids chattering)

109
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,878
(bird tings)

110
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,509
- This place has really changed.

111
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:51,053
- Yeah, the house ain't
the same since mommy died.

112
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,056
- I'm sorry about that.

113
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,975
They wouldn't let me out for the funeral.

114
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:00,437
There was this mix up, by the
time it got straightened out...

115
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:03,607
- Oh, she went quick, you
know, she didn't have any pain.

116
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,692
- You tell her what happened?

117
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,029
- You know, she never really asked.

118
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,745
- Hey, let's go down to Cropsey's
and get some beers, huh?

119
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:18,622
- [Joey] Cropsey's still open?

120
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:20,791
- [Tommy] We're going out
hun, we'll be back later.

121
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:29,466
(door bangs)

122
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:31,260
So where are you going to stay?

123
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:33,720
- I wanna talk to you about that.

124
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:36,390
Think I could stay at the
house for a little while?

125
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:38,475
At least till I get a
job, settle in somewhere?

126
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,227
- Jesus kid, I don't know about that.

127
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,229
I mean if it was up to me I wouldn't mind,

128
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:45,149
but you know, Lorraine is
really weird about her privacy.

129
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:47,192
You know what I mean?

130
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:48,026
- Yeah sure, I understand.

131
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:49,111
I'll find a place.

132
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:52,573
Is my stuff still in my room?

133
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:55,075
- Yeah, me and mommy put it in boxes.

134
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,326
Now, we didn't know when you got out

135
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:59,663
whether or not you were
going to come back or not.

136
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:02,166
- I'll come for it as soon
as I find a place to stay.

137
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:08,046
- You know what, fuck it.

138
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,339
I'm gonna have Lorraine fix something up

139
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,507
for you in the basement, all right?

140
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,509
I mean, this way you got your privacy,

141
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:16,471
she's got hers, and you know...
I mean till you find a place.

142
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,015
- Sure I won't cause any problems?

143
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:19,266
- Don't worry about it.

144
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,518
- You sure about that, Tommy?

145
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,105
- Hey, blood is thicker than water, no?

146
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:28,025
- I don't know, I haven't
drank any in a while.

147
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:31,153
- You haven't changed a bit, you fuck.

148
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:33,822
(upbeat music)

149
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,491
Believe that?

150
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:40,537
So he's standing there staring at me,

151
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:43,624
says, "What's your problem?"

152
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,210
Well my problem is you're
a thief and a crook,

153
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,961
and you look like a fucking rat.

154
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:50,631
(crowd laughs)

155
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:53,383
So he grabs a pipe from behind the bar,

156
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:54,259
he's walking towards me,

157
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:57,721
and I grab a chair, I smash it
over his fucking head.

158
00:11:58,013 --> 00:12:00,015
He falls down cold on the floor, right?

159
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:03,018
His brother runs into the
phone booth to call the cops.

160
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,729
I go out to the car,
Lorraine's sitting there.

161
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:07,564
I start the car, ready to go.

162
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:11,401
She holds it up, she goes, "Oh
God, look, I had it all along."

163
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:13,070
(crowd laughs)

164
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,489
Can you believe this, I
wanted to strangle her.

165
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:18,033
Gary, two more over here.

166
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:20,035
- You're all tapped out, Tommy.

167
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:20,869
- [Tommy] What?

168
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,079
- Harry says you're at the limit.

169
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:23,330
- You gotta be kidding,
you're gonna break my balls

170
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:25,832
with all the money I spend
in this fucking joint?

171
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:27,668
- Hey look, I'm only doing what Harry

172
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,461
tells me to do, all right Tom?

173
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:30,963
- I got it Tommy, no problem.

174
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,220
- [Radio] In the neighborhood.

175
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:41,640
And he's someone I've known
since he was a little boy.

176
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:42,516
(cupboard creaks)

177
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,184
Well the things is, my husband,

178
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:45,727
he doesn't really like this kid,

179
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,523
and he's telling my daughter
that she can't see him anymore.

180
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:51,817
I think its just a harmless
teenage relationship,

181
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:54,987
but my husband has suddenly
gotten so protective.

182
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,073
I mean like, he's just
watching every move she makes,

183
00:12:58,365 --> 00:12:59,866
and when I try to talk to him about it,

184
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:02,411
he just says she's too young to be dating,

185
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:04,830
or he just refuses to
talk about it at all.

186
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:06,331
It's created like...

187
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,086
- Joey, I'll pay you back
when we get back to the house.

188
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,088
- Don't worry about it.

189
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:24,641
This is really great, Lorraine.

190
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,560
I haven't had a meal
like this in a long time.

191
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:27,477
- Thanks.

192
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:28,812
- She's a good cook, huh?

193
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,735
- So what are your plans
now that you're out?

194
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:35,819
- Huh?

195
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:36,945
- Now that you're out?

196
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:39,156
Where are you staying,
you know, stuff like that.

197
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:40,907
- He's staying with some friends,

198
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:42,868
but they're out of town right now

199
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,744
so I said he could stay

200
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,413
in the basement till he finds something.

201
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:47,331
- Oh.

202
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,792
Where do your friends live?

203
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:52,169
- [Tommy] In the neighborhood.

204
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:54,296
- How many days they say they'd be gone?

205
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:55,672
- A few days, right?

206
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,550
- Can he answer for himself?

207
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,345
- He could if there weren't
so many goddamn questions.

208
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:07,142
- I'm sorry if I offended
you with my questions, Joey.

209
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:08,810
It's really none of my business.

210
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:10,645
- I'm not offended at all.

211
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,523
- Speaking of business,
shouldn't you be getting ready?

212
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:14,358
- For what?

213
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:15,192
- Don't you have a job tonight?

214
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:17,444
- Told you, it was canceled.

215
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:18,445
- You didn't tell me that.

216
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:19,363
- I did tell you, this morning

217
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:20,530
in the hallway, remember?

218
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:21,907
- No.

219
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:23,784
- What do you do, Lorraine?

220
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:29,206
(phone rings)

221
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,501
Yeah?

222
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,213
Look, Camille call back,
I'm waiting for a call.

223
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:38,799
(phone bangs)

224
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,180
- How did you know I
didn't want to talk to her?

225
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:47,099
- She'll call back, she always call back.

226
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:48,433
- He thinks the world's supposed to end

227
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:51,311
just cause he's expecting
a call, you know?

228
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:52,646
- Why don't you stop?

229
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:54,773
You know these calls are business.

230
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:56,983
- Yeah, monkey business.

231
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,152
- [Tommy] Why are you getting
so bent out of shape for?

232
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:00,487
- [Lorraine] Because maybe I
wanted to talk to her, ya know?

233
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:01,738
- Think I'll look for a job tomorrow.

234
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,989
- She'll call back.

235
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:03,907
- That's not the point.

236
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,118
- Remember we used to work
at the supermarket, Tommy?

237
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,536
- Give me a fucking break here.

238
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:08,662
- The old AMP on Decker.

239
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:11,123
I was in charge of the frozen foods.

240
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:12,124
- Why don't you give me a break?

241
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,584
- He was in charge of the produce.

242
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:16,044
- What?

243
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:18,213
What are you, a fucking imbecile?

244
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,340
- [Lorraine] Don't pick on him.
He didn't do nothing, did he?

245
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:22,926
(phone rings)

246
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:27,889
- Yeah?

247
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:30,267
Hey, how's it going?

248
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,898
Yeah.

249
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,443
- You finished with that?

250
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:40,527
- Yeah, I am.

251
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:58,420
(phone bangs)

252
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,547
- I'm going out. If anybody
calls, I'll be back.

253
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:02,799
And don't tie up that phone.

254
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:08,263
Joey, come on, take a ride with me.

255
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:10,015
- You sure I can't help
you with the dishes?

256
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:12,559
- No, I'm fine.

257
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,144
Just take the ride with Tommy.

258
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:18,690
(engine rumbling)

259
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:21,485
- [Joey] Where we going?

260
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:23,904
- I got to see someone.

261
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,740
(dramatic music)

262
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:58,772
What's wrong?

263
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:01,274
- Cops was just here.

264
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,530
- What did you expect?
We're in the fucking projects.

265
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:09,366
(dramatic music)

266
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,787
- What's in the bag, Tommy?

267
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,080
- What?

268
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:16,289
- I could get sent back
another eight years

269
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:18,208
for what you got in that bag.

270
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,461
- What are you talking about?

271
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:23,964
- Come on Tommy, I'm not an imbecile.

272
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:25,215
- Nobody said you were.

273
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:29,678
It's weed, all right?

274
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,514
(dramatic music)

275
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,896
There, all right, you happy now?

276
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:43,233
Make believe like it's not even there.

277
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:46,069
(dramatic music)

278
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:54,786
Got you a pillow and some sheets.

279
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:58,623
It's a little musty, but it's clean.

280
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,542
- Thanks.

281
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,630
- You going to be all right down here?

282
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:06,548
- Yeah.

283
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:13,805
- Look kid, I'm sorry I snapped
at you in the car before.

284
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:15,765
I just wanna say I'm glad you're back.

285
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,651
And I meant what I said before.

286
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:29,779
- What?

287
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:31,072
- You are an imbecile.

288
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:37,746
Goodnight, kid.

289
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:38,788
- Goodnight, Tommy.

290
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,126
(cricket chirping)

291
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:34,552
(dramatic music)
(whacking)

292
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:09,754
(dramatic music)

293
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:20,807
(rain spattering)

294
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,729
- You think Mike Tyson's
finished for the evening?

295
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,523
- Will you stop it, he's my brother.

296
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,703
- I know who he is.

297
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:44,622
(rain spattering)

298
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:56,968
(thunder crashes)

299
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:01,055
- [Radio] We've been,
you know really close,

300
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,850
we're really good friends...

301
00:21:04,142 --> 00:21:07,145
He's being a little mysterious lately.

302
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:12,192
(garbage crinkles)
(bag rustling)

303
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:15,236
- [Radio] I don't really know where he's going,

304
00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:19,365
and I've never really been
to his apartment or anything.

305
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:22,994
(phone rings)

306
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:26,456
- Yeah?

307
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,543
Look, you know not to call
before noon, call back later.

308
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:32,921
Idiot.

309
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:34,964
- Sorry Lorraine, I didn't
mean to wake you up.

310
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:36,591
- Don't apologize, you didn't.

311
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:37,509
I've been up.

312
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:39,844
I'm a very light sleeper.

313
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:43,264
- You got any more trash bags?

314
00:21:44,224 --> 00:21:46,267
There's a lot of stuff I
could throw out back there.

315
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,186
- You don't have to do that, you know.

316
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,482
Actually I think Tommy likes
things cluttered up like that.

317
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:56,694
- Mind if I sit down?

318
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,531
- No.

319
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:11,417
- Where is he?

320
00:22:12,877 --> 00:22:15,380
- He doesn't get up before
noon, if he can help it.

321
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,133
- I'm like you, I'm a light sleeper.

322
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,428
In the joint we had to be up by sunrise.

323
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:29,686
- If you want to wash up,
the bathrooms up on the...

324
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:33,022
You should know where it is.

325
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:39,362
- I washed up down here,
I hope that was all right.

326
00:22:39,654 --> 00:22:40,989
- You can wash up wherever you want.

327
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:47,662
- You don't have to worry, Lorraine.

328
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:49,247
I'm not going to be here long.

329
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:52,000
Just had nowhere else to go.

330
00:22:54,544 --> 00:22:56,129
- I didn't say you couldn't stay.

331
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:59,924
- No, you're absolutely
right, I don't belong here.

332
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:03,177
My story about friends from out of town...

333
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:04,637
I ain't got any friends.

334
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:06,723
They're not out of town.

335
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,268
I'm sorry to lie to you like that.

336
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,354
- You didn't lie to me, your brother did.

337
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:17,567
- As soon as I can, I'll be moving on.

338
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:22,113
- [Lorraine] Where you gonna go?

339
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:23,448
- I don't know.

340
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:30,121
How long you and Tommy been married?

341
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,543
- Going on four years.

342
00:23:35,835 --> 00:23:36,794
- He never mentioned it.

343
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,508
I guess he was too busy,
didn't have time to write.

344
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,677
- Did you write him?

345
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:45,595
- No, I didn't.

346
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:51,935
- Jesus Christ, you two are up early.

347
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:54,479
Who called before?

348
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:55,396
- Conrad.

349
00:23:57,065 --> 00:23:58,733
I told him not to call before noon.

350
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:06,866
- So how'd you sleep your first night out?

351
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:07,784
- Fine.

352
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,828
It was strange though, without the bars.

353
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,000
- Good morning, beautiful.

354
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:17,043
- Morning, asshole.

355
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:22,340
(dramatic music)

356
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:00,920
- Tommy.

357
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:05,049
This is the second notice
we got from the bank.

358
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:06,634
- What?

359
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:07,802
- Mortgage.

360
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:08,720
- Let me see.

361
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:18,604
I sent them a check last week.

362
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:19,564
- Yeah, I know.

363
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:22,358
- They must be on glue down
there, I'll call them later.

364
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,276
- Alright.

365
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:28,322
Oh, some guy Louis
called, he's coming over.

366
00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:30,825
- That's another hundred bucks.

367
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,370
- Word spreads fast around here.

368
00:25:34,662 --> 00:25:35,288
- What?

369
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,081
- Nothing.

370
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:45,048
He doesn't really seem how you described.

371
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:46,799
- What do you mean?

372
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:48,134
- Your brother.

373
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:50,928
He doesn't really seem capable
of the things you said.

374
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:52,972
- He doesn't, huh?

375
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:57,810
- He's got a parole officer, right?

376
00:25:58,102 --> 00:25:59,353
- So?

377
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,939
- What happens if he should come over?

378
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:04,025
- Why don't you let me worry about that.

379
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,454
- [Boy] Yo Candy, what
do you say we go behind

380
00:26:16,746 --> 00:26:18,456
the quarry and I'll show you my pet snake?

381
00:26:18,748 --> 00:26:20,374
- Yeah, no thanks, I don't like snakes.

382
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:21,542
- Come on, it doesn't bite.

383
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:22,960
- Yeah, but I do.

384
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:26,631
Give it back. What the fuck?

385
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:27,840
Jesus Christ.

386
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:30,218
Why don't you all grow up?

387
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,058
- Candy Riedel.

388
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:39,227
- Who are you?

389
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,729
- Joey Larabito, remember?

390
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:43,147
I used to hang out with your brother.

391
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,608
- Get out of here. Joey Larabito?

392
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,485
Oh my God.

393
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:50,071
- [Boy] Yo candy, who's your
boyfriend, Freddy Krueger?

394
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:52,490
- He looks old enough to be your old man.

395
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:53,533
Twice as ugly.

396
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:56,244
- You guys should treat
a girl with respect.

397
00:26:56,536 --> 00:26:58,454
- Why don't you mind your
own business, Freddy?

398
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:00,832
- Maybe you want to take
a step and say that.

399
00:27:01,124 --> 00:27:02,542
- Joey, it's all right.

400
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:03,918
They're just little boys.

401
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,420
Come on, come on.

402
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:09,632
- You going home?

403
00:27:09,924 --> 00:27:10,466
- Yeah.

404
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:11,801
- I'll walk ya.

405
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:13,636
- See you tomorrow in school, Candy.

406
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:17,765
Freddy Krueger.

407
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:19,016
- [Joey] So who are those guys?

408
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:21,185
- Just some jerks from school.

409
00:27:22,395 --> 00:27:23,896
The short one, he likes me.

410
00:27:24,939 --> 00:27:25,982
- Likes you?

411
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:27,817
He's got a funny way of showing it.

412
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:31,529
- No, he's only like that
when he's with his friends.

413
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:34,031
He's actually really shy
when he's by himself.

414
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,743
- Still, that's no way to behave.

415
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:38,661
So how's Carl doing?

416
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:41,706
- Oh he's fine, yeah.

417
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:43,666
He lives in California now.

418
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:47,128
He's married, he's got two
kids, a boy and a girl.

419
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:47,962
- Get outta here.

420
00:27:48,254 --> 00:27:48,796
- Yeah.

421
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:50,715
- Never pictured Carl married with kids.

422
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:54,510
So what happened, did you get left back?

423
00:27:54,802 --> 00:27:57,346
(dramatic music)

424
00:27:58,264 --> 00:27:59,891
This place hasn't changed at all.

425
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:02,560
- Yeah.

426
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:04,520
- How's your mother and your father?

427
00:28:04,812 --> 00:28:06,856
- They're doing good, yeah.

428
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:12,737
I'd ask you to come in, but you know.

429
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,532
- Yeah.

430
00:28:16,824 --> 00:28:18,201
- Tell him I was asking for him, okay?

431
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:19,118
- Yeah, I will.

432
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:21,329
Thanks.

433
00:28:21,621 --> 00:28:24,332
Oh, and thanks for walking me home.

434
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:25,166
- Anytime.

435
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:26,209
- All right.

436
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:28,920
Hey, sweetie.

437
00:28:29,212 --> 00:28:31,756
(dramatic music)

438
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:37,720
Hey, mom.

439
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:40,556
(dramatic music)

440
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:55,655
- [Lorraine] Dinner's ready.

441
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:58,491
(dramatic music)

442
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:04,872
- I put in an application
at AMP today, Tommy.

443
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:06,874
- Again with the AMP.

444
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,501
- Did you know Mr.
Fritz still works there?

445
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:11,754
He don't remember me, but
he took my application.

446
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:14,340
(door knocks)

447
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:22,723
- [Tommy] 70 a quarter.

448
00:29:23,015 --> 00:29:24,141
- [Man] 70? Last time it was 60.

449
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,102
- [Tommy] Well its 70 now, you
want the fucking pot or not?

450
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:27,103
- [Man] All right, give it to me.

451
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:28,938
- [Tommy] Hurry up, my
dinner's getting cold.

452
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:35,027
(door bangs)

453
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:39,573
- Who was that?

454
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:41,993
I never saw him before.

455
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:44,704
- That's Frankie Hamm, he's
friends with Joe Bologna.

456
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:47,665
- Frankie Hamm and Joe Bologna?

457
00:29:47,957 --> 00:29:49,792
What are they, meat products?

458
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:51,877
Just be careful who you got coming here.

459
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:54,338
- Don't worry about it.

460
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,090
- Just be careful, all right?

461
00:29:56,382 --> 00:29:57,758
- You made your point, all right?

462
00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:00,428
- Hey, Tommy.

463
00:30:01,637 --> 00:30:03,764
You got a pail and some
rags I could borrow?

464
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:05,933
- For what?

465
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:08,102
- When I was out today, I thought up

466
00:30:08,394 --> 00:30:10,646
a fast way to make some quick cash.

467
00:30:10,938 --> 00:30:11,856
- Oh yeah, doing what?

468
00:30:13,357 --> 00:30:14,317
- Well, the stores on main street,

469
00:30:14,608 --> 00:30:15,818
they got plate windows, right?

470
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,197
And they're dirty, some
are filthy, I checked.

471
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,366
So I figured I could clean windows,

472
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:24,452
make some quick cash, what do you think?

473
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:29,248
- I think that's a great idea, no?

474
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,292
- Yeah, yeah.

475
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:32,752
- I mean you could make 50,

476
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:36,255
a 100, maybe 200, 300 dollars a day.

477
00:30:36,547 --> 00:30:38,507
- Will you stop it. Maybe he
wants to earn some honest money

478
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,885
for a change. Who are you
to be putting him down?

479
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:42,636
- Why don't you mind your own business?

480
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,722
He's not talking to you, is he?

481
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,686
- So what do you think I could charge

482
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:52,355
for that, cleaning windows?

483
00:30:53,898 --> 00:30:55,316
- Jesus, kid.

484
00:30:55,608 --> 00:30:57,693
You know there's a lot of things
to consider here with this.

485
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:01,405
You got to consider
the size of the window,

486
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:03,657
the width, how thick it is,

487
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:05,993
if it's tinted,

488
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:07,745
if there's lettering on it.

489
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:08,829
You know, if there's lettering on it,

490
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:10,247
you got to charge more, no?

491
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,710
(door knocks)

492
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:24,887
(indistinct muttering)

493
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:26,680
(door bangs)

494
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:27,973
- Look, if it's a normal size window,

495
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:29,100
like the candy store or something,

496
00:31:29,392 --> 00:31:31,227
charge five bucks for the
whole job, inside and out.

497
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,228
But if it's one of those plate

498
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,480
glass windows, like the
laundromat or the supermarket,

499
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:36,399
charge five bucks for like each side.

500
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:39,485
- Think that's a fair price?

501
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:41,987
- Yeah.

502
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:45,449
I'll get you the bucket and rags.

503
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:46,367
- [Joey] Great.

504
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:53,749
- [Radio] Good, its just that
she just wants to move out

505
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,918
and I don't understand why.

506
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,005
- Your hands are really soft, Lorraine.

507
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:01,841
- Skin cream, thanks.

508
00:32:04,385 --> 00:32:06,512
(glass shatters)

509
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:07,346
- Sorry.

510
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:08,431
- It's all right.

511
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:09,432
Its just a plate.

512
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:11,934
- Don't move, its everywhere.

513
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:21,694
(door bangs)

514
00:32:21,986 --> 00:32:23,028
- What the hell's going on here?

515
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:26,031
- Dropped a dish.

516
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:29,076
- Why do you have him doing housework?

517
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:29,910
- He actually offered to help,

518
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:31,787
and I let him. What's the big deal?

519
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,123
- The big deal is I turn
my back for one minute

520
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:35,666
and you're feeling up my wife's feet.

521
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,085
- You don't feel up my
feet anymore, do you?

522
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:39,503
- [Tommy] You touch her toes?

523
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:43,883
- Might've touched the big one.

524
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:46,510
- That's it, its over!

525
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:48,179
Nobody touches my wife's toes!

526
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:51,265
- Maybe I should leave you two alone.

527
00:32:51,557 --> 00:32:52,099
- Where are you going?

528
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:53,017
- Hey.

529
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:55,561
- Come on, we're gonna go out.

530
00:32:58,105 --> 00:32:59,106
- Where you taking him?

531
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:00,274
- The Garter.

532
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:05,696
- Oh.

533
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:10,868
- When's the last time
you saw a naked girl,

534
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,286
and not in a magazine?

535
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:15,998
- I don't know.

536
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,917
- You're going to see some tonight.

537
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:19,877
If you're lucky, you might even get laid.

538
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,214
- They got toes down at the Garter?

539
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:25,382
(Tommy laughs)

540
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:28,844
- How the hell'd you go six
years without having sex?

541
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:30,137
Huh?

542
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:33,390
- I don't know. Try not
to think about it, I guess.

543
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:35,434
- What was it like in there?

544
00:33:37,186 --> 00:33:38,354
- It was rough.

545
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,275
- Did you get into fights?

546
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,193
- Yeah, some.

547
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:47,196
I was on the boxing team.

548
00:33:47,488 --> 00:33:48,739
- Boxing team?

549
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:50,491
- Yeah, we had a boxing team.

550
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:53,369
We had a team for everything.

551
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:55,871
Even had a chess team, which somehow

552
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:57,373
turned into the boxing team.

553
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:01,794
- Did you get into any
fights outside of the ring?

554
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:03,963
You know, people trying to fuck with you?

555
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:06,590
- I had my share.

556
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,805
- Did you get raped?

557
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:16,475
- Tommy, what kind of
question is that to ask?

558
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:21,897
- Hey kid, I didn't mean anything
by it. I'm just curious.

559
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:25,734
- Some things are better not talked about.

560
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:36,078
- Me and you used to talk
about everything, remember?

561
00:34:38,956 --> 00:34:40,457
- Yeah, I remember.

562
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:45,588

563
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:46,589

00:44:22,956 --> 00:44:23,999
- Why?

717
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:25,083
- It doesn't add up.

718
00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:26,793
I mean you're supposed to come out

719
00:44:27,085 --> 00:44:27,627
worse than you went in, right?

720
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:29,045
But in your case you...

721
00:44:31,965 --> 00:44:33,008
I don't know, whatever.

722
00:44:35,427 --> 00:44:37,512
- It's not so hard to figure.

723
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:39,681
I don't want to go back there.

724
00:44:39,973 --> 00:44:41,099
Even if I gotta clean toilets

725
00:44:41,391 --> 00:44:42,809
at the depot, I'm not going back.

726
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:45,520
I'd rather die than go back there.

727
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:56,156
- I got that pail and rags
for you, they're on the porch.

728
00:44:56,448 --> 00:44:57,073
- Thanks.

729
00:44:58,408 --> 00:45:01,161
I should get started
while it's still early.

730
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,710
What was that word you said before?

731
00:45:09,002 --> 00:45:11,379
- Oh, enigma.

732
00:45:12,464 --> 00:45:13,590
- Yeah.

733
00:45:13,882 --> 00:45:15,592
It's a good one, I got to remember that.

734
00:45:18,845 --> 00:45:21,514
(dramatic music)

735
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:38,740
- [Woman] Joey?

736
00:45:43,161 --> 00:45:43,912
- Denise.

737
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:46,456
- When did you get home?

738
00:45:46,748 --> 00:45:47,374
- A few days.

739
00:45:49,376 --> 00:45:50,710
How you doing?

740
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:52,837
- Fine, I guess.

741
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:54,422
How about you?

742
00:45:54,714 --> 00:45:56,007
- Fine too.

743
00:45:56,299 --> 00:45:57,259
I'm staying with Tommy.

744
00:45:58,885 --> 00:46:00,220
You know he's married now?

745
00:46:00,512 --> 00:46:02,889
- Yeah, I see his wife
sometimes, she's very pretty.

746
00:46:06,476 --> 00:46:09,813
Guess you didn't hear, I'm married now too.

747
00:46:10,814 --> 00:46:11,564
- Really?

748
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:14,442
That's great.

749
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:15,443
I'm happy for you.

750
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:17,946
Any kids?

751
00:46:18,238 --> 00:46:20,365
- Two boys, two and four years old.

752
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:23,076
Actually the four year old

753
00:46:23,368 --> 00:46:26,121
is my husband's from a previous marriage.

754
00:46:28,581 --> 00:46:30,125
- Who'd you marry?

755
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:31,668
- It's nobody you would know.

756
00:46:32,961 --> 00:46:35,839
He's older than us, friend of the family.

757
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:42,804
- Well, that's great.

758
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:49,561
- I gotta go, cause I gotta pick
up my kids from my mother's.

759
00:46:51,563 --> 00:46:52,314
- Sure.

760
00:46:53,565 --> 00:46:54,607
- It's good to see you.

761
00:46:55,525 --> 00:46:57,068
I'm glad you're home.

762
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,611
- Thanks.

763
00:46:58,903 --> 00:46:59,946
It's good to see you too.

764
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,536
So where you living now?

765
00:47:06,828 --> 00:47:10,415
- We're... I'm over on Porter.

766
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:12,917
You remember the Beeler house?

767
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:16,713
- Dead man Beeler's
house, the haunted house?

768
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:19,132
- Yeah, that's the one.

769
00:47:19,424 --> 00:47:20,550
- You're living there?

770
00:47:20,842 --> 00:47:21,968
- It's all fixed up now.

771
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:23,845
- Remember when we was kids,

772
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:26,306
we was always seeing
ghosts and monsters inside.

773
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:28,516
- Yeah, well you know,
when you're a kid,

774
00:47:28,808 --> 00:47:30,393
you think a lot of things are true.

775
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:35,023
You almost convince yourself of them.

776
00:47:35,315 --> 00:47:38,109
You grow up, you see things in
a completely different light.

777
00:47:39,194 --> 00:47:40,570
- Yeah, it's like an enigma.

778
00:47:45,075 --> 00:47:47,369
- Well, anyway, that's
where I'm living now so...

779
00:47:50,914 --> 00:47:51,664
I gotta go.

780
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:53,958
Take care, Joey.

781
00:47:55,335 --> 00:47:56,544
- You too, Denise.

782
00:47:56,836 --> 00:47:59,381
(dramatic music)

783
00:48:02,258 --> 00:48:03,343
Enigma, shit.

784
00:48:06,012 --> 00:48:08,681
(dramatic music)

785
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:22,737
- [Man] Hey Burke, where's Scalero?

786
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:23,988
- [Burke] Out by the trailer.

787
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,825
(dramatic music)

788
00:48:49,264 --> 00:48:51,349
- [Man] You want the part?

789
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:54,727
What the fuck am I running here?

790
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,020
- [Man] Seem on edge today.

791
00:48:56,312 --> 00:48:57,897
- Hey Bobby, don't be a comedian.

792
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:00,483
- Thanks, Ralph.

793
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:04,863
- Oh Christ, you show up two days early,

794
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:06,197
it can only mean bad things.

795
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:07,532
- Why do you say that?

796
00:49:07,824 --> 00:49:08,741
- Why?

797
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:09,993
Because I know you.

798
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:12,871
You got something for me?

799
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,927
It's a little light here, Tommy.
It feels about 200 light.

800
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:31,222
- Look, I wanted to talk to you about that.

801
00:49:31,514 --> 00:49:33,099
The last few weeks have
been really rough for me.

802
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:36,019
- Now look, I've been giving
you a break as it is, huh?

803
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:39,481
And what about the pound of
weed you got from my nephew?

804
00:49:39,772 --> 00:49:40,356
How are you going to pay for that?

805
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:42,609
- I didn't pay for that
shit, he fronted me.

806
00:49:44,235 --> 00:49:47,405
- What are you going to do
when Jackie wants his money?

807
00:49:47,697 --> 00:49:48,615
He ain't as nice as me.

808
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,744
- Look, what am I going to do, run away?

809
00:49:53,036 --> 00:49:54,120
You know I'm good for it.

810
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,833
I'm being straight with you, Ralph.

811
00:50:00,376 --> 00:50:01,753
- I know that.

812
00:50:02,045 --> 00:50:03,129
I appreciate it.

813
00:50:10,595 --> 00:50:12,305
That better not be long distance.

814
00:50:12,597 --> 00:50:13,139
Remember what I told you about that?

815
00:50:13,431 --> 00:50:14,933
- Hey, I gotta go.

816
00:50:15,225 --> 00:50:17,268
- Fucking guy, he calls
his mother everyday,

817
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,686
upstate, on my phone.

818
00:50:18,978 --> 00:50:21,397
Like I'm responsible for
his personal fucking life.

819
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:24,609
- It was a local call, honest Ralphie.

820
00:50:24,901 --> 00:50:25,443
- Yeah?

821
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:27,070
We'll see when we get the bill.

822
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:29,864
You guys have been here all day, can't ya...

823
00:50:30,156 --> 00:50:30,990
(metal clanging)

824
00:50:31,282 --> 00:50:32,742
Fucking tidy up, or something?

825
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:34,786
I mean what the fuck, this place

826
00:50:35,078 --> 00:50:36,454
looks like a fucking pig sty.

827
00:50:37,747 --> 00:50:40,500
Too fucking proud to pick
up a fucking broom, huh?

828
00:50:43,169 --> 00:50:44,796
Not now, ya fuck.

829
00:50:45,797 --> 00:50:46,839
I mean when you're just hanging out

830
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:48,299
in here with nothing to do.

831
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:54,180
Tommy, look, I appreciate
what you're saying here,

832
00:50:54,472 --> 00:50:57,433
but we gotta do something
about settling this account.

833
00:50:58,434 --> 00:50:59,644
You got to start paying a principal.

834
00:50:59,936 --> 00:51:02,146
I can't carry the weight anymore.

835
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:04,357
My fucking back is breaking.

836
00:51:04,649 --> 00:51:06,776
- I told you, you know I'm good for it.

837
00:51:08,444 --> 00:51:10,154
- I don't know nothing, Tommy.

838
00:51:10,446 --> 00:51:12,907
All I know is you're two bills short.

839
00:51:19,497 --> 00:51:21,124
I hear your brother's out of jail.

840
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:23,001
- Yeah.

841
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:26,004
- I hear he kicked the shit out
of Gas Tank the other night.

842
00:51:27,213 --> 00:51:28,715
You're just causing problems

843
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:31,092
all over the neighborhood, ain't you?

844
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:33,553
- His brother beat the
shit out of Gas Tank?

845
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:35,138
I thought he was a retard.

846
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,472
(man chuckles)

847
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:37,974
- He's not retarded, asshole.

848
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:41,227
- I saw your wife at a
party the other night.

849
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:43,354
Sucking cock, ten bucks a head.

850
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:44,397
Was pretty good too.

851
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:45,607
(man laughs)

852
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:46,524
- Oh yeah, I saw your mother

853
00:51:46,816 --> 00:51:48,735
at the racetrack sucking a horses dick.

854
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:54,157
- All right, all right, you
two, that's enough, okay?

855
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:56,367
What am I running here,
a fucking day camp?

856
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:05,710
Look Tommy, this has gone on
as far as it can, all right?

857
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:09,881
I can't do you any more favors.

858
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:13,259
People think I'm a fucking charity.

859
00:52:13,551 --> 00:52:15,053
It's not the money, you know that.

860
00:52:16,554 --> 00:52:17,639
It's about respect.

861
00:52:19,098 --> 00:52:20,224
Responsibility.

862
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:24,062
- Yeah, I know.

863
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:25,480
- No, I don't think you do.

864
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,483
That's the fucking problem.

865
00:52:31,486 --> 00:52:32,820
I want a thousand on Monday.

866
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,200
- I'll give you something on Friday.

867
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:47,126
(dramatic music)

868
00:52:47,418 --> 00:52:48,127
(Tommy thuds)

869
00:52:48,419 --> 00:52:50,963
(dramatic music)

870
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:57,053
- I want all of the money on Friday.

871
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:57,970
You got that?

872
00:53:02,016 --> 00:53:04,268
I thought I told you
guys to clean up in here.

873
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:09,440
(Tommy thuds)

874
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:21,661
- Oh, I know.

875
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:23,788
Shouldn't be up here.

876
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:25,498
- That's okay.

877
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:30,253
What you looking at?

878
00:53:30,545 --> 00:53:32,338
- Some old pictures.

879
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,799
Saw an old friend
yesterday, got me thinking.

880
00:53:38,928 --> 00:53:39,971
- Is that her?

881
00:53:40,263 --> 00:53:42,557
- Yeah, her name's Denise.

882
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:44,767
- [Lorraine] Close friend?

883
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:45,810
- You could say that.

884
00:53:48,104 --> 00:53:49,981
We was gonna be married, me and her.

885
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:51,441
Long time ago.

886
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:52,358
- Oh.

887
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:55,236
- [Joey] Yeah, she's
married and got a kid.

888
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:02,410
- I'm sorry.

889
00:54:02,702 --> 00:54:05,079
- Its funny, you think
something's over, you know,

890
00:54:06,122 --> 00:54:07,999
after a certain amount of time passes.

891
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:09,751
And then you see them, it's like

892
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:12,003
a rubber band snaps you back.

893
00:54:12,295 --> 00:54:15,047
And you realize, maybe
it's not over after all,

894
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:16,215
at least not for you.

895
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:19,093
That ever happen to you?

896
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:22,680
- No, not really.

897
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:25,308
- Thing of it is, I think

898
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,019
we could have had a good life together.

899
00:54:28,311 --> 00:54:30,146
I mean, I really loved her.

900
00:54:33,816 --> 00:54:36,486
(dramatic music)

901
00:54:37,737 --> 00:54:38,821
- What's this?

902
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:46,037
Who drew these?

903
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:50,208
- [Joey] Used to be
able to draw real good.

904
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,125
- You drew these?

905
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:53,294
- Hard to believe, right?

906
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:57,006
- I didn't mean it to sound like that.

907
00:54:57,298 --> 00:54:59,675
- No, you're right, I find
it pretty amazing myself.

908
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:01,594
- If you drew these, it's not like

909
00:55:01,886 --> 00:55:03,387
you're going to forget how to draw.

910
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,807
- Haven't you noticed, I'm
a little slow upstairs.

911
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:10,228
It wasn't always like this.

912
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,687
I was pretty smart as a kid.

913
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:15,483
That all changed after the accident.

914
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:16,400
- What accident?

915
00:55:17,485 --> 00:55:18,528
- Tommy never told you?

916
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:20,571
- No.

917
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,201
- I was a kid.

918
00:55:26,244 --> 00:55:28,246
We was playing out in the backyard.

919
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:29,747
I fell.

920
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:32,124
Cracked my head on cement
stairs by the kitchen.

921
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:35,795
I was in the hospital for a long time.

922
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:37,755
They didn't think I was going to live.

923
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:39,465
Anyway, I did.

924
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:43,636
But ever since I've been
like this, you know.

925
00:55:43,928 --> 00:55:44,554
Slow.

926
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:47,431
- I don't think you're slow at all.

927
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,726
- Well anyway, I can't draw anymore.

928
00:55:52,687 --> 00:55:53,437
- Yeah.

929
00:55:55,231 --> 00:55:57,066
Well, when was the last time you tried?

930
00:55:59,777 --> 00:56:00,862
Oh, I was going to say,

931
00:56:02,864 --> 00:56:03,823
maybe you should sleep in here

932
00:56:04,115 --> 00:56:05,283
from now on. You know, it
was your room to begin with,

933
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:08,286
and your stuff's here.
It'd just be easier.

934
00:56:12,081 --> 00:56:13,541
I'll get you some clean sheets.

935
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:21,841
(dramatic music)

936
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:27,096
Tommy?

937
00:56:27,388 --> 00:56:29,932
(dramatic music)

938
00:56:59,003 --> 00:57:02,089
Who are these people you owe money to?

939
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:06,260
Honey, who are these
people you owe money to?

940
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:11,724
- Scalero.

941
00:57:13,351 --> 00:57:18,272
- Ralphie Scalero.

942
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:21,025
You promised me, you swore to me

943
00:57:21,317 --> 00:57:22,526
you were finished with that.

944
00:57:24,195 --> 00:57:25,738
- Lorraine please, please.

945
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:30,993
- So you haven't been paying
the mortgage, have you?

946
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:35,998
And all the money I've been making?

947
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:38,334
- It's the only way I
can get them off my ass.

948
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:41,045
- Oh fuck, Tommy.

949
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,426
It's like a bad fucking dream.

950
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:49,845
What are we gonna do?

951
00:57:51,681 --> 00:57:54,350
We can't get another loan on the house.

952
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:56,060
There's nothing left to sell.

953
00:58:00,231 --> 00:58:03,859
- I did this for us.

954
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:08,030
- You didn't do this for us.
You don't give a fuck about us.

955
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:09,865
You did this for you.

956
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,285
I want this garbage out of my life.

957
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:14,870
I'm sick of this shit.

958
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:17,707
(dramatic music)

959
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:28,175
What are they going to
do when you can't pay?

960
00:58:29,969 --> 00:58:32,722
- What do you think they're gonna do?

961
00:58:34,724 --> 00:58:35,391
- [Man] And you're living there

962
00:58:35,683 --> 00:58:36,434
with your brother and his wife?

963
00:58:36,726 --> 00:58:37,560
- Yeah.

964
00:58:37,852 --> 00:58:39,895
- Okay, 'cause I'm going
to have to come by soon,

965
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:41,230
and it's my duty to inform you

966
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:43,524
that I could come by at any time.

967
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:46,569
I don't need a warrant.

968
00:58:46,861 --> 00:58:47,778
I don't need a reason.

969
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,282
And I work around the clock, okay?

970
00:58:51,574 --> 00:58:52,199
- Okay.

971
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:55,036
- How are you doing with work?

972
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:56,495
No steady employment yet?

973
00:58:56,787 --> 00:59:01,542
- I put in an application at the
AMP and three other places.

974
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:03,252
- All right.

975
00:59:04,295 --> 00:59:05,212
Try and get something soon,

976
00:59:05,504 --> 00:59:06,964
'cause this cleaning windows stuff...

977
00:59:08,424 --> 00:59:10,926
Well, it's nothing to put in your file.

978
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:12,511
- [Joey] Okay.

979
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:14,305
- You're not taking any drugs are you?

980
00:59:14,597 --> 00:59:15,306
- No.

981
00:59:15,598 --> 00:59:17,349
- Not hanging out with
any of the old crowd?

982
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:20,102
- No, it's pretty much me by myself.

983
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:21,062
- Good.

984
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:23,397
'Cause if you hang out
with the wrong people,

985
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:24,940
you'll wind up right
back where you came from.

986
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:26,233
You know that, right?

987
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:27,151
- Yeah.

988
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,111
- Okay.

989
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:32,073
You're off to a good start.

990
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:32,948
But if you still haven't found

991
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:33,908
work by next week, let me know,

992
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,328
and I'll see if there's something
I can point you towards.

993
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,245
- Okay.

994
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:40,664
- That's it.

995
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:42,833
- I'm outta here?

996
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:44,418
- Yep.

997
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,669
Pretty painless, right?

998
00:59:46,712 --> 00:59:47,463
- Yeah.

999
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:49,673
- Okay.

1000
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:50,883
I'll see you next week.

1001
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:00,684
- Aren't people going to smell that?

1002
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:02,269
- They won't know the fucking difference.

1003
01:00:04,105 --> 01:00:06,148
- [Lorraine] You still won't
have the money by tomorrow.

1004
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:08,484
- Are you working tonight?

1005
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:11,529
- They haven't called back yet.

1006
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:13,614
- You know if you did, it would help.

1007
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:16,075
- Then what? What about next week?

1008
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:18,077
What happens then?

1009
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:19,912
What about the guy you got this from?

1010
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:23,833
He's going to want his money
eventually, don't you think?

1011
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,085
- Enough of the questions, all right?

1012
01:00:26,377 --> 01:00:27,795
- One more question.

1013
01:00:28,087 --> 01:00:30,214
Your brother, he's on parole, right?

1014
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:33,384
They're going to send him right back.

1015
01:00:33,676 --> 01:00:35,803
- What do you want me to do,
kick him out of the house?

1016
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:40,683
(phone rings)

1017
01:00:40,975 --> 01:00:42,560
Answer that, it might be the agency.

1018
01:00:44,854 --> 01:00:47,439
(phone ringing)

1019
01:00:53,279 --> 01:00:55,739
(oregano thuds)

1020
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:58,534
(dramatic music)

1021
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:09,879
(Joey knocks)

1022
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,305
- Joey, what are you doing here?

1023
01:01:19,597 --> 01:01:21,974
- Just dropped by to say hello.

1024
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:23,350
- You shouldn't have done that.

1025
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:24,810
What if my husband was home?

1026
01:01:26,604 --> 01:01:28,981
- What, you can't see an old friend?

1027
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:32,610
- He doesn't know
anything about you, or us.

1028
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:35,821
- I wanna talk to ya.

1029
01:01:37,948 --> 01:01:38,699
- I can't.

1030
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:43,579
I got my kids inside, I gotta fix dinner.

1031
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:44,663
- Just five minutes.

1032
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,000
Five minutes, I'm out of here.

1033
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:56,050
Hey.

1034
01:02:04,225 --> 01:02:04,975
- Come on.

1035
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:06,727
Come on, hun.

1036
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:23,410
- The place has been fixed up nice

1037
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:24,745
since the last time I saw it.

1038
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:29,291
No ghosts, either.

1039
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:30,209
- So?

1040
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:32,628
You said you wanted to talk.

1041
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:36,465
- When's your husband coming home?

1042
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,217
- He works late on Thursdays.

1043
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:41,428
- Oh, what's he do?

1044
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,265
- He's a bookkeeper at McReynolds.

1045
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:45,182
- The department store?

1046
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:46,100
- Yeah.

1047
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:47,851
- That's great.

1048
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:49,853
- Yeah, it's okay.

1049
01:02:51,397 --> 01:02:52,147
So?

1050
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:01,991
- Well, it was really good
to see you the other day, Denise.

1051
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:04,868
And... Look, you're right,

1052
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:10,541
this was a terrible idea. I better go.

1053
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:12,001
- Well, you must've had something

1054
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:14,712
on your mind, or you wouldn't have come.

1055
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:15,796
What is it, Joey?

1056
01:03:17,298 --> 01:03:18,048
- You really want to know?

1057
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:18,966
- I'm waiting.

1058
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:23,804
- It's just that I felt I deserved

1059
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:25,931
a little better than what I got from you.

1060
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:28,559
I felt I deserved something more.

1061
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:33,063
A goodbye, an apology, an excuse.

1062
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,320
Anything other than what I got.

1063
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:41,864
- You do? That's pretty funny.

1064
01:03:43,324 --> 01:03:44,742
- [Joey] Why is that so funny?

1065
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,579
- Because I feel like
I deserved better too.

1066
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:49,621
- What are you talking about?

1067
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,707
- I'm talking about Joey Larabito,

1068
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:53,792
the neighborhood patsy.

1069
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:55,502
Everybody's door mat.

1070
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,713
- I was nobody's door mat, except yours.

1071
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:00,090
- You were the biggest joke around.

1072
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:02,468
- How could you say
that? You of all people.

1073
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,845
- Because it's true, everybody knows it.

1074
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,556
Just pat you on the back
and throw you to the wolves.

1075
01:04:07,848 --> 01:04:09,683
You went with a smile on your face.

1076
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:12,978
- Well, Denise what's true
is that once I was inside,

1077
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:15,064
once you didn't have to be there anymore,

1078
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:17,483
you left me to rot like
a piece of garbage.

1079
01:04:17,775 --> 01:04:20,319
All that shit you said
to me, how you love me,

1080
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:21,695
how you would wait for me.

1081
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:23,155
How could you lie to me like that?

1082
01:04:23,447 --> 01:04:24,239
- I never lied to you.

1083
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:26,867
- What do you call saying those things?

1084
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:28,494
Why did you make all those promises?

1085
01:04:28,786 --> 01:04:30,329
- I promised you nothing.

1086
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:31,914
- You promised me everything!

1087
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:33,791
(baby cries out)

1088
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:38,796
- Don't yell at me, and
don't upset my kids.

1089
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:41,173
You can get the fuck out, right now.

1090
01:04:43,926 --> 01:04:46,261
Its okay, mommy's right here.

1091
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:49,223
Don't cry, everything's fine.

1092
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:50,391
Watch your brother.

1093
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:56,647
- I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1094
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:01,777
But Denise, if you wanted to fall in love

1095
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,529
and get married, fine.

1096
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:08,242
I know you deserve those things.

1097
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:11,203
But why did you say that you love me?

1098
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:13,539
- I did love you.

1099
01:05:15,374 --> 01:05:18,669
I would have waited forever for you.

1100
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:22,631
But the more I thought about it,

1101
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:26,552
day after day, the more mad I got.

1102
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:29,930
I was young, and I wanted
a life together sure,

1103
01:05:30,222 --> 01:05:32,182
but I wasn't prepared to
throw 10 years of it away

1104
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:34,017
because of your brother.

1105
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:35,978
- Tommy has nothing to do with this.

1106
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:40,023
- God, you can't tell me
the truth even now, can ya?

1107
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:43,318
You know you are so fucking dense, Joey.

1108
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,153
- Denise.

1109
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:45,821
- Stop it.

1110
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:46,989
It wasn't you.

1111
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:51,326
I know it wasn't you.

1112
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:55,330
You never hurt nobody in your life.

1113
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:57,124
You wouldn't harm a fly.

1114
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,211
Let me ask you a question.

1115
01:06:03,255 --> 01:06:07,509
Did he ever once even say thank you?

1116
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:10,345
- Denise, you're wrong.

1117
01:06:10,637 --> 01:06:13,432
- I have never been more right in my life.

1118
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:16,977
He took six years of your life,

1119
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:20,355
and you know what, I don't even blame him.

1120
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:22,566
I blame you.

1121
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:26,361
'Cause if you had really loved me,

1122
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,656
you wouldn't have given him those years.

1123
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:35,162
- You don't understand, he's my brother.

1124
01:06:35,454 --> 01:06:37,164
- No, you don't understand, Joey.

1125
01:06:38,624 --> 01:06:39,625
That's the problem.

1126
01:06:43,295 --> 01:06:45,130
- You love this guy you're married to?

1127
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:50,469
- What does that have to do with anything?

1128
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:51,803
- Because I want to know.

1129
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,182
Denise, I loved you more than I ever loved

1130
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:57,142
anything in my life.

1131
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:02,648
- No Joey, you never loved me.

1132
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:08,570
I gotta fix dinner.

1133
01:07:27,923 --> 01:07:30,509
Well, I guess there was some
ghosts in here after all.

1134
01:07:38,934 --> 01:07:40,435
- No, no.

1135
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:43,063
[Tommy] No, that's not what I'm saying.

1136
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:44,481
I know, but that's not what I saying.

1137
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:45,941
You said I had till Friday,

1138
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:47,192
I don't know what the problem is.

1139
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:48,694
I'm doing the best I can here.

1140
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:50,529
I mean you're... Hello?

1141
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:53,991
(phone clicks)

1142
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:54,908
Joey.

1143
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:58,370
What are you doing?

1144
01:07:58,662 --> 01:07:59,454
- Just fooling around.

1145
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:00,289
- Let me see.

1146
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:03,041
That's not bad, kid. You still got it, huh?

1147
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,668
Look, I want you to do me
a favor tonight, all right?

1148
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,712
I want you to drive Lorraine to a job

1149
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:09,214
and wait there till she's finished, okay?

1150
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:10,257
- Yeah, no problem.

1151
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:11,925
- She's got to be there by nine.

1152
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:16,972
- Hey Tommy, what does she do?

1153
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:19,433
So he wasn't kidding, was he?

1154
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:21,768
- Who?

1155
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:24,771
- Tommy said you strip.

1156
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:29,318
It's what you really do.

1157
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:30,235
- Yeah.

1158
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:32,613
Yeah.

1159
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:38,910
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

1160
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:42,789

1161
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:44,958

1163
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:54,635

(audience applauding)

1167
01:11:24,201 --> 01:11:25,368
- Here's a little something extra for you.

1168
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,370
You really made his night, thank you.

1169
01:11:27,662 --> 01:11:28,205
- I'm glad.

1170
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,415
- I just hope he's not
going to be spoiled now.

1171
01:11:30,707 --> 01:11:31,833
- It was fun. Thank you.

1172
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,752
- Drive safely going home, okay?

1173
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:40,717
(door knocking)

1174
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:54,105
- What do you want?

1175
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:55,941
- Who the fuck do you think
you, you fucking bastard?

1176
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:56,942
- Whoa, whoa, what's your problem?

1177
01:11:57,234 --> 01:11:58,193
- What's my problem?

1178
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,403
- Come on in, we'll talk about it.

1179
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:02,280
- Do I look like a
fucking pizza guy to you?

1180
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:05,367
- Who's this?
- Don't worry about who that is, man.

1181
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:07,160
Do I look like a pizza man to you?

1182
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:08,203
- What's your problem?

1183
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:09,162
- You wanna know what my problem is?

1184
01:12:09,454 --> 01:12:10,789
This is my problem, man.

1185
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,840
(car doors banging)

1186
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:20,757
- What are you going to do with that?

1187
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:23,468
- If I don't get my shit, you'll find out.

1188
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,012
- What you take from me,
you take from Scalero, remember that.

1189
01:12:26,304 --> 01:12:27,597
- [Man] I'm afraid he's right.

1190
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:29,850
- Jack.

1191
01:12:30,141 --> 01:12:30,684
Look, I don't want no trouble, all right?

1192
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:32,769
But this fucking guy ripped me off.

1193
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:34,145
- [Jack] What'd you cop from him?

1194
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:36,690
- [Man] A quarter ounce
of oregano man, smell it.

1195
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:39,317
(Jack inhales)

1196
01:12:41,736 --> 01:12:43,071
- You know, you're a real asshole, Tommy.

1197
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:45,949
- Does Scalero know you're
working with this little prick?

1198
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:48,034
- I thought Jack oughta
know what's going down with you.

1199
01:12:48,326 --> 01:12:49,119
(whacks)

1200
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:51,162
(Tommy thuds)

1201
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:53,123
- Here, this settle things for you?

1202
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:55,000
- Yeah, I just want what I paid for.

1203
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:56,543
- Good, we're settled then.

1204
01:12:56,835 --> 01:12:58,712
Next time you cop from
Peter Louise, understand?

1205
01:12:59,004 --> 01:12:59,546
- Got it.

1206
01:12:59,838 --> 01:13:00,380
- [Jack] Now get outta here.

1207
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:01,298
- Thanks, Jack.

1208
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:02,924
- Where are you going with that?

1209
01:13:03,216 --> 01:13:05,051
This is mine. Get outta here, you too, go.

1210
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:11,516
(whacks)
(Tommy thuds)

1211
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:14,269
Now where's my money, fucker?

1212
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:15,729
How the fuck you paying my uncle,

1213
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:17,731

1214
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,024
Huh?

1215
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:20,692
What's with the oregano?

1216
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:23,194
What are you, fucking stupid, Tommy?

1217
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:24,112
Huh?

1218
01:13:27,365 --> 01:13:29,576
I want my money now, Tommy.

1219
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:32,078
- I ain't got it.

1220
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:46,718
- Where's the rest?

1221
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:47,969
- Come back later, I'll
give you something.

1222
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:50,513
- Come back later. Hey
fuck you, come back later.

1223
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:53,767
- My wife's got it, all right?

1224
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:56,019
- Your wife, what is she, the
fucking bank of New England?

1225
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:57,604
Tommy.

1226
01:13:57,896 --> 01:13:58,897
- Hey, fuck you, all right.

1227
01:13:59,189 --> 01:13:59,731
- Fuck me?

1228
01:14:00,023 --> 01:14:00,690
- [Man] Gonna let him
talk to you like that?

1229
01:14:00,982 --> 01:14:01,608
- Gut him.

1230
01:14:09,866 --> 01:14:12,035
(Tommy thuds)

1231
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:14,621
- Check the house, whatever
you can find upstairs.

1232
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:22,337
- This little piggy went to market,

1233
01:14:23,421 --> 01:14:25,048
this little piggy stayed home,

1234
01:14:26,299 --> 01:14:28,176
this little piggy got roast beef,

1235
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:34,516
this little piggy, fuck this little piggy.

1236
01:14:34,891 --> 01:14:37,477
(finger cracks)

1237
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:45,151
- Do you mind if we just
drove around for a bit?

1238
01:14:45,443 --> 01:14:47,112
I don't feel like going home just yet.

1239
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:50,657
- Okay, where do you want to go?

1240
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:52,826
- I don't know, nowhere.

1241
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:54,953
Just drive.

1242
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:02,335
- Wake up, fuck face. Come on, get up.

1243
01:15:02,627 --> 01:15:03,753
Have a little breakfast.

1244
01:15:05,964 --> 01:15:06,756
- What do we got?

1245
01:15:10,343 --> 01:15:11,011
- This is all there is.

1246
01:15:11,302 --> 01:15:12,470
Some of it's good, most of it's shit.

1247
01:15:12,762 --> 01:15:15,557
- Throw it in the garbage. This
fuck never learns, you know?

1248
01:15:16,516 --> 01:15:17,517
- Look, if his wife really has the money

1249
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:19,102
we should stick around for her.

1250
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,771
- Maybe we should stick
around and stick his wife.

1251
01:15:22,063 --> 01:15:22,605
- Now you're talking.

1252
01:15:22,897 --> 01:15:24,274
- She got a tight little ass, eh Tommy?

1253
01:15:26,317 --> 01:15:26,985
So how do these look, huh?

1254
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:28,278
- [Jack] They look good.

1255
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:35,410
(drawer bangs)

1256
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:37,412
- Yo, fuck, get down.

1257
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:38,830
- Tommy, put it down, Tommy.

1258
01:15:39,122 --> 01:15:39,706
- On the floor!

1259
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,332
Get down!

1260
01:15:41,624 --> 01:15:42,709
- Fuck you.

1261
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:43,960
- Fuck me?

1262
01:15:44,252 --> 01:15:44,794
Fuck.

1263
01:15:45,086 --> 01:15:47,422
(man cries out)

1264
01:15:47,714 --> 01:15:49,257
Don't you two move!

1265
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:50,175
Go, get up.

1266
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:52,844
Get up, motherfucker, get up!

1267
01:15:54,429 --> 01:15:56,097
Let's show your friends
how you suck a cock.

1268
01:15:56,389 --> 01:15:57,640
- I was just doing what they tell me.

1269
01:15:57,932 --> 01:15:59,392
- [Tommy] Put it in your mouth!

1270
01:15:59,684 --> 01:16:00,560
- Son of a bitch.

1271
01:16:03,855 --> 01:16:05,190
- You better fucking
kill him, motherfucker,

1272
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:08,610
cause your life ain't worth
jack shit if you don't.

1273
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:10,570
- I'll show you what my life is worth.

1274
01:16:10,862 --> 01:16:12,655
(glass shatters)

1275
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:16,868
You, get down on the floor.

1276
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:17,702
Get down!

1277
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:18,620
- Okay, okay!

1278
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:23,792
(whacks)

1279
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:24,751
- [Jack] Calm down, Tommy.

1280
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:25,710
- Your pockets.

1281
01:16:26,002 --> 01:16:27,378
- Let's talk about this, Tommy.

1282
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:28,213
(gun clicks)

1283
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:29,297
- I'll blow your fucking head off.

1284
01:16:29,589 --> 01:16:31,216
- Cool it man, he's fucking crazy.

1285
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:33,468
- All right Tommy, take it easy, all right?

1286
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,178
It's all right, Tommy.

1287
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:38,223
You know my uncle ain't gonna
be too happy about this, Tommy.

1288
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:39,432
Yeah, this is everything, all right.

1289
01:16:39,724 --> 01:16:41,267
Here, can I go?

1290
01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:44,270
Come on, Tommy.
Can I go, Tommy? Please?

1291
01:16:45,563 --> 01:16:46,231
- Get the fuck out of here,

1292
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:47,982
and take that piece of shit with you.

1293
01:16:48,274 --> 01:16:50,819
(dramatic music)

1294
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:56,282
- Come on.

1295
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:01,412
- It's you and Tommy, huh?

1296
01:17:01,704 --> 01:17:02,372
- It's everything.

1297
01:17:03,623 --> 01:17:05,625
- Hope you guys can work it out.

1298
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:07,418
It's important to stay together.

1299
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:11,965
- It is obvious you've never been married.

1300
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:14,300
- I'm sure it's not easy,

1301
01:17:14,592 --> 01:17:16,511
but it's gotta have its good points too.

1302
01:17:16,803 --> 01:17:17,720
- Yeah?

1303
01:17:18,012 --> 01:17:18,638
Name one.

1304
01:17:21,599 --> 01:17:24,352
- To have somebody in your
life, that's a good thing.

1305
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:30,650
To find somebody you
love who loves you back.

1306
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:33,945
That doesn't happen too often.

1307
01:17:34,237 --> 01:17:35,113
- Happens everyday, people fall in

1308
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:37,615
and out of love all the time.

1309
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:39,909
I'm sorry.

1310
01:17:41,202 --> 01:17:44,414
Don't listen to me, I
don't know what I'm saying.

1311
01:17:48,835 --> 01:17:50,378
- Are you going to stay with him?

1312
01:17:53,715 --> 01:17:54,465
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1313
01:17:58,011 --> 01:17:59,846
Tommy's my second husband so...

1314
01:18:02,849 --> 01:18:05,435
I was one of those 18, straight
out of high schoolers, you know.

1315
01:18:06,352 --> 01:18:09,689
Wasn't even pregnant, either,
I wanted to get married.

1316
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:10,648
He did too, so...

1317
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:14,569
We thought we were in love,

1318
01:18:14,861 --> 01:18:17,906
and all the bullshit that goes with it.

1319
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:25,371
- [Joey] So you kind of know
what you're talking about, huh?

1320
01:18:25,663 --> 01:18:26,331
- Not really, no.

1321
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:32,712
- What happened with your first husband?

1322
01:18:35,673 --> 01:18:36,966
- He was an animal.

1323
01:18:38,384 --> 01:18:40,428
Didn't hate myself enough
to be with an animal.

1324
01:18:44,599 --> 01:18:46,017
Tommy never laid a hand on me.

1325
01:18:49,103 --> 01:18:49,854
It's funny.

1326
01:18:51,606 --> 01:18:53,149
All the shit we've been through,

1327
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:55,735
never came down to that.

1328
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:59,405
- Tommy was always a lover, not a fighter.

1329
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,451
- What about you?

1330
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:05,370
- Me, I'm neither.

1331
01:19:07,705 --> 01:19:09,415
- Maybe you're a little bit of both.

1332
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:29,936
(door knocks)

1333
01:19:31,354 --> 01:19:36,276
(suspenseful music)
(door knocking)

1334
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:43,241
- Come on, I know somebody's in there.

1335
01:19:43,533 --> 01:19:44,450
Open the door.

1336
01:19:44,742 --> 01:19:47,495
(suspenseful music)

1337
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:53,835
(suspenseful music)
(door knocks)

1338
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:56,921
(suspenseful music)

1339
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:16,816
(door knocks)

1340
01:20:17,108 --> 01:20:19,986
(suspenseful music)

1341
01:20:30,788 --> 01:20:32,415
(whacks)

1342
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:35,251
(dramatic music)

1343
01:20:59,442 --> 01:21:00,109
- Shit.

1344
01:21:00,401 --> 01:21:02,945
(dramatic music)

1345
01:21:07,575 --> 01:21:08,576
Christ.

1346
01:21:08,868 --> 01:21:11,412
(dramatic music)

1347
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:21,422
- [Lorraine] When you killed that guy,

1348
01:21:21,714 --> 01:21:23,341
was it really an accident?

1349
01:21:23,633 --> 01:21:26,135
- Didn't Tommy tell you about that?

1350
01:21:26,427 --> 01:21:27,428
- Yeah, but he didn't tell me much,

1351
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:31,557
I mean, he said he only
knew what you told him.

1352
01:21:31,849 --> 01:21:32,475
- Yeah?

1353
01:21:33,851 --> 01:21:34,602
What was that?

1354
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:37,939
- That you broke into the TV store,

1355
01:21:38,231 --> 01:21:41,776
and you were cornered, and killed
the owner trying to escape.

1356
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:45,196
- That's what he said?

1357
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:48,533
- Basically, yeah.

1358
01:21:50,076 --> 01:21:51,411
- Then that's what happened.

1359
01:21:55,623 --> 01:21:58,000
- [Lorraine] Why'd you
break in in the first place?

1360
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:00,378
- [Joey] Seemed like a
good idea at the time.

1361
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:02,130
It was too easy to pass up.

1362
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:04,632
So I snuck in, see what I could find.

1363
01:22:04,924 --> 01:22:07,427
(dramatic music)

1364
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:21,274
- [Lorraine] Why didn't you
just punch him and get away?

1365
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:22,692
- [Joey] It was either him or me.

1366
01:22:23,901 --> 01:22:25,695
I wasn't thinking at the time.

1367
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:29,866
(dramatic music)
(metal clatters)

1368
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:32,785
(dramatic music)

1369
01:22:46,674 --> 01:22:49,093
Broke my mother's heart.

1370
01:22:49,385 --> 01:22:50,887
I don't think she ever forgave me.

1371
01:22:53,264 --> 01:22:55,475
- Your mother never spoke bad of you.

1372
01:22:55,766 --> 01:22:56,392
- Yeah?

1373
01:22:58,102 --> 01:22:58,936
What did she say?

1374
01:23:00,563 --> 01:23:01,689
- She loved you, of course.

1375
01:23:05,818 --> 01:23:07,528
She never let any of us even touch

1376
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:09,113
your room while you were away.

1377
01:23:11,616 --> 01:23:15,578
I guess she just thought
of it as a mistake.

1378
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,373
We all make mistakes.

1379
01:23:22,418 --> 01:23:26,756
- Well, I think I'm going to
try and go back to school.

1380
01:23:27,048 --> 01:23:28,299
Learn a trade or something.

1381
01:23:29,509 --> 01:23:31,135
Can't wash windows for a living.

1382
01:23:32,803 --> 01:23:34,889
- I think you should.

1383
01:23:35,181 --> 01:23:36,224
- You think so, huh?

1384
01:23:38,142 --> 01:23:38,893
- Yeah.

1385
01:23:44,357 --> 01:23:45,775
- Maybe we should head back.

1386
01:23:49,237 --> 01:23:49,987
- Right.

1387
01:23:55,034 --> 01:23:56,035
- No, I know she's on a job,

1388
01:23:56,327 --> 01:23:58,079
I need the phone number where she's at!

1389
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,123
I need the number where she's at!

1390
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:07,088
(phone bangs)

1391
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:08,631
- Why are the lights out?

1392
01:24:08,923 --> 01:24:09,549
Tommy?

1393
01:24:13,594 --> 01:24:15,513
Oh my God, you're
bleeding. What did you do?

1394
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:16,347
- We're getting out of here tonight,

1395
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,641
I packed some of your stuff.
You got gas in the car?

1396
01:24:18,933 --> 01:24:19,934
- What the fuck is going on?

1397
01:24:20,226 --> 01:24:21,269
- Those motherfuckers came here tonight

1398
01:24:21,561 --> 01:24:23,229
looking for their money.

1399
01:24:23,521 --> 01:24:24,188
- [Lorraine] I'm calling the police.

1400
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,524
- To hell with the police,
we gotta go now.

1401
01:24:26,816 --> 01:24:27,900
You coming or you staying?

1402
01:24:29,485 --> 01:24:31,153
- I'm coming with you.

1403
01:24:31,445 --> 01:24:32,113
I'll get some clothes.

1404
01:24:32,405 --> 01:24:33,155
- No, no, you got no time for that.

1405
01:24:33,447 --> 01:24:34,115
We gotta go.

1406
01:24:35,741 --> 01:24:37,577
- I got a bag down here then.

1407
01:24:37,868 --> 01:24:39,412
- Wait a minute, we got no time.

1408
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:44,250
(dramatic music)

1409
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:45,334
- Aw, Christ.

1410
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:50,172
Tommy, what the fuck did you do?

1411
01:24:52,592 --> 01:24:53,801
- What is down there?

1412
01:24:58,014 --> 01:24:58,764
Tommy?

1413
01:25:00,224 --> 01:25:01,684
Who is down there?

1414
01:25:01,976 --> 01:25:03,352
- [Joey] Great, he's dead, Tommy.

1415
01:25:05,438 --> 01:25:07,898
- I thought it was one of them,
he came right in the house.

1416
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:09,775
- Who is down there?

1417
01:25:11,152 --> 01:25:12,695
- It's my fucking parole officer.

1418
01:25:14,155 --> 01:25:16,073
Can't take the blame for this one, Tommy.

1419
01:25:17,491 --> 01:25:18,826
I'm just not doing it again.

1420
01:25:20,453 --> 01:25:22,872
Can't fucking believe you did this to me.

1421
01:25:23,164 --> 01:25:25,124
- Fuck this, let's get out of here.

1422
01:25:26,417 --> 01:25:27,793
- I'm not going with you.

1423
01:25:28,085 --> 01:25:28,878
- [Tommy] What'd you say?

1424
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:30,921
- I am not going with you.

1425
01:25:32,632 --> 01:25:34,800
I didn't do anything, why should I run?

1426
01:25:35,092 --> 01:25:35,635
- [Tommy] Because they're going

1427
01:25:35,926 --> 01:25:36,636
to come back here and kill me.

1428
01:25:36,927 --> 01:25:38,763
- That's why you should
go. Why should I go?

1429
01:25:39,055 --> 01:25:39,722
- Oh, this is bullshit.

1430
01:25:40,014 --> 01:25:41,057
Give me those car keys.

1431
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:42,975
- [Lorraine] I am not going.

1432
01:25:43,267 --> 01:25:44,977
- You're coming with me.

1433
01:25:45,269 --> 01:25:48,230
- Tommy, I'm sorry.

1434
01:25:48,522 --> 01:25:49,273
I've had enough.

1435
01:25:49,565 --> 01:25:52,109
- [Tommy] You're going,
you're coming with me.

1436
01:25:52,401 --> 01:25:53,736
- I am not going.

1437
01:25:54,028 --> 01:25:54,945
- [Tommy] You're going.

1438
01:25:55,237 --> 01:25:55,780
- [Lorraine] No.

1439
01:25:56,072 --> 01:25:57,114
- [Tommy] I said let's go.

1440
01:25:57,406 --> 01:25:58,908
- She's not going with you, Tommy.

1441
01:26:00,368 --> 01:26:02,828
- Mind your own business, and
give me those fucking keys.

1442
01:26:03,788 --> 01:26:06,332
(keys jingling)

1443
01:26:15,758 --> 01:26:16,425
- Now let's go.

1444
01:26:16,717 --> 01:26:18,344
- You go ahead, Tommy.

1445
01:26:18,636 --> 01:26:21,013
Won't call the cops for a half hour.

1446
01:26:21,305 --> 01:26:21,847
- What?

1447
01:26:22,139 --> 01:26:23,724
- Just leave while you can.

1448
01:26:24,016 --> 01:26:26,435
- Shut up, this is between me and my wife.

1449
01:26:26,727 --> 01:26:29,313
- Yeah, and she's telling you no.

1450
01:26:32,525 --> 01:26:33,734
- This is because of you, isn't it?

1451
01:26:34,026 --> 01:26:35,277
- Just stop it.

1452
01:26:35,569 --> 01:26:38,322
- Why is it that everything
you touch turns to poison?

1453
01:26:38,614 --> 01:26:39,490
- Fuck you, Tommy.

1454
01:26:41,701 --> 01:26:44,995
You didn't even tell her you
was in the store that night.

1455
01:26:45,287 --> 01:26:47,581
I wouldn't have been there
if it wasn't for you.

1456
01:26:47,873 --> 01:26:49,291
I'm through paying your debts.

1457
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:50,543
- Paying my debts?

1458
01:26:50,835 --> 01:26:53,671
I got a fucking lifetime
of debt because of you.

1459
01:26:53,963 --> 01:26:56,340
I was the bib every time
you spit up your food.

1460
01:26:56,632 --> 01:26:57,466
I got into a fight every time

1461
01:26:57,758 --> 01:27:00,386
some kid in the neighborhood
called you a retard.

1462
01:27:00,678 --> 01:27:01,887
- What are you talking about?

1463
01:27:02,847 --> 01:27:03,931
The accident?

1464
01:27:04,223 --> 01:27:05,683
- The accident, no.

1465
01:27:05,975 --> 01:27:07,810
Wasn't it called the incident?

1466
01:27:08,102 --> 01:27:09,145
- I never called it that.

1467
01:27:11,105 --> 01:27:13,065
Is that what this is?

1468
01:27:13,357 --> 01:27:15,484
You're digging up shit from 20 years ago?

1469
01:27:16,652 --> 01:27:18,487
You are a sick man, Tommy.

1470
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:19,572
You need help.

1471
01:27:19,864 --> 01:27:21,741
- No, you're the one that needs help.

1472
01:27:22,032 --> 01:27:24,243
- Gonna help me with that gun on me?

1473
01:27:24,535 --> 01:27:27,163
(dramatic music)

1474
01:27:32,918 --> 01:27:34,503
- You better get to the hospital.

1475
01:27:35,463 --> 01:27:36,589
- Are you coming or not?

1476
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:52,021
- Fucker!

1477
01:27:52,313 --> 01:27:54,523
(Tommy thuds)

1478
01:27:54,815 --> 01:27:56,609
- Going somewhere, motherfucker?

1479
01:27:56,901 --> 01:27:58,944
(whacking)

1480
01:28:01,572 --> 01:28:05,326
- Tell me I suck cock,
I got your fucking cock

1481
01:28:06,535 --> 01:28:08,245
right here, you motherfucker.

1482
01:28:09,246 --> 01:28:11,207
(whacks)
(gun fires)

1483
01:28:11,499 --> 01:28:14,043
(dramatic music)

1484
01:28:15,127 --> 01:28:18,589
(dramatic music)
(groaning)

1485
01:28:18,881 --> 01:28:23,344
(whacking)
(crying out)

1486
01:28:26,806 --> 01:28:27,890
Motherfucker!

1487
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:31,143
- [Lorraine] Joey.

1488
01:28:31,435 --> 01:28:35,898
(whacking)
(crying out)

1489
01:28:36,982 --> 01:28:39,819
(windows shatters)

1490
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:43,697
(gun fires)

1491
01:28:43,989 --> 01:28:46,534
(dramatic music)

1492
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:58,879
(dog barking)
(dramatic music)

1493
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:05,761
- Tommy?

1494
01:29:12,518 --> 01:29:14,395
We gotta get out of here.

1495
01:29:14,687 --> 01:29:16,605
- We didn't do anything, Joey.

1496
01:29:16,897 --> 01:29:18,524
- [Joey] I'm on parole.

1497
01:29:20,734 --> 01:29:22,778
- I'll tell them what happened.

1498
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:24,864
- [Joey] They ain't gonna believe it.

1499
01:29:25,155 --> 01:29:27,449
- I'll make them.

1500
01:29:27,741 --> 01:29:30,411
- [Joey] We can't take that chance.

1501
01:29:35,749 --> 01:29:38,836
Get up. You dead?

1502
01:29:39,128 --> 01:29:41,672
(dramatic music)

1503
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:48,971
Tommy?

1504
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:51,390
Tommy?

1505
01:29:56,228 --> 01:29:59,273
(engine rumbling)

1506
01:29:59,565 --> 01:30:01,609
(phone clicking)

1507
01:30:01,901 --> 01:30:05,070
(dramatic music)

1508
01:30:05,362 --> 01:30:06,196
- Get me the police.

1509
01:30:07,406 --> 01:30:08,616
Someone's been shot.

1510
01:30:11,493 --> 01:30:13,245
- What are you doing?

1511
01:30:13,537 --> 01:30:15,372
What, are you calling the cops?

1512
01:30:15,664 --> 01:30:17,291
- I shot someone, Tommy.

1513
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:18,125
- What?

1514
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:19,418
- I shot somebody.

1515
01:30:21,545 --> 01:30:22,421
Tommy, you're hurt.

1516
01:30:23,672 --> 01:30:25,466
Let me call the hospital.

1517
01:30:25,758 --> 01:30:28,052
- You're calling the hospital?

1518
01:30:29,845 --> 01:30:32,556
(phone bangs)

1519
01:30:32,848 --> 01:30:33,390
Where's my brother?

1520
01:30:33,682 --> 01:30:34,391
- I don't know.

1521
01:30:34,683 --> 01:30:35,392
- Where did he go?

1522
01:30:35,684 --> 01:30:36,393
- I don't know, Tommy. He took the car,

1523
01:30:36,685 --> 01:30:37,353
I don't know where he went.

1524
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:38,646
- He took the car, where did he go?

1525
01:30:38,938 --> 01:30:41,482
(dramatic music)

1526
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:43,484
What are you two up to?

1527
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:46,111
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1528
01:30:46,403 --> 01:30:47,947
- You're gonna blame me for this?

1529
01:30:49,281 --> 01:30:51,241
You're gonna tell the
police that I did it?

1530
01:30:55,746 --> 01:30:58,290
When they get here, you're gonna
tell them that Joey did it.

1531
01:30:58,582 --> 01:30:59,375
You understand me?

1532
01:31:00,459 --> 01:31:01,877
He did it.

1533
01:31:02,169 --> 01:31:05,589
He killed Scalero, he
killed his parole officer.

1534
01:31:06,757 --> 01:31:07,883
- Tommy.

1535
01:31:08,175 --> 01:31:10,678
- Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?

1536
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:12,388
Do you understand me?

1537
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,764
- [Lorraine] He did it. He did it.

1538
01:31:14,056 --> 01:31:14,890
- [Tommy] He did it. Joey did it.

1539
01:31:15,182 --> 01:31:16,600
Joey did it all.

1540
01:31:16,892 --> 01:31:19,019
- I did an awful lot of
things, didn't I, Tommy?

1541
01:31:25,109 --> 01:31:26,110
- I thought you left.

1542
01:31:27,778 --> 01:31:29,530
- You'd like that, huh?

1543
01:31:29,822 --> 01:31:30,823
Think I'll stick around.

1544
01:31:31,907 --> 01:31:32,574
- Well that's good, because the police

1545
01:31:32,866 --> 01:31:34,952
are going to be here any minute.

1546
01:31:35,244 --> 01:31:36,829
- Yeah, that's what I'm counting on.

1547
01:31:37,913 --> 01:31:38,580
- How are you going to explain

1548
01:31:38,872 --> 01:31:40,124
your fingerprints on the gun?

1549
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:42,543
- With the truth.

1550
01:31:42,835 --> 01:31:43,877
- With the truth, huh?

1551
01:31:44,169 --> 01:31:44,795
- Yeah.

1552
01:31:45,879 --> 01:31:48,549
(sirens blaring)

1553
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,344
Here, Tommy.

1554
01:31:52,636 --> 01:31:55,180
(sirens blaring)

1555
01:31:59,643 --> 01:32:00,436
I'll turn around.

1556
01:32:03,814 --> 01:32:05,190
Get your favorite angle.

1557
01:32:05,482 --> 01:32:08,027
(sirens blaring)

1558
01:32:18,495 --> 01:32:19,705
- [Man] Everybody get into position.

1559
01:32:19,997 --> 01:32:23,042
(sirens blaring)

1560
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:24,710
This is a dangerous situation,

1561
01:32:25,002 --> 01:32:27,504
everybody clear off the
streets and go home.

1562
01:32:27,796 --> 01:32:29,840
- [Man] You two move, get
the hell out of here, now.

1563
01:32:30,132 --> 01:32:30,716
- What's up, Danny?

1564
01:32:31,008 --> 01:32:32,051
- We got a possible hostage situation.

1565
01:32:32,342 --> 01:32:34,928
We got one Caucasian male,
possibly armed and dangerous.

1566
01:32:44,354 --> 01:32:47,191
This is the police, throw your weapons out

1567
01:32:47,483 --> 01:32:49,818
and come out with your
hands over your head!

1568
01:32:52,488 --> 01:32:53,781
- Don't shoot, I'm coming out!

1569
01:32:54,073 --> 01:32:57,618
- Keep your hands over your
head and in plain sight.

1570
01:32:57,910 --> 01:32:59,203
- All right, just don't shoot.

1571
01:33:00,746 --> 01:33:03,332
- Keep your hands above your head.

1572
01:33:05,459 --> 01:33:07,711
Stop right there, don't move.

1573
01:33:09,922 --> 01:33:12,091
In the house, throw out your weapons,

1574
01:33:12,382 --> 01:33:13,926
come out with your hands up.

1575
01:33:14,218 --> 01:33:14,927
- [Tommy] Get away from there.

1576
01:33:15,219 --> 01:33:18,722
- [Danny] The house is
surrounded, you cannot get away.

1577
01:33:19,014 --> 01:33:20,599
Give yourselves up.

1578
01:33:20,891 --> 01:33:21,934
- How could you do this to him, Tommy?

1579
01:33:22,226 --> 01:33:24,686
- [Danny] The house is
surrounded, you cannot escape.

1580
01:33:25,687 --> 01:33:26,605
- [Lorraine] He's your brother.

1581
01:33:26,897 --> 01:33:31,693
- [Danny] Throw your
weapons out and come out.

1582
01:33:32,611 --> 01:33:34,822
- [Tommy] Wait here.

1583
01:33:35,114 --> 01:33:36,824
- Nobody wants to hurt anybody here.

1584
01:33:37,116 --> 01:33:40,077
You on the porch, raise your
hands above your head now!

1585
01:33:43,539 --> 01:33:44,289
- Tommy, do it.

1586
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:48,544
- Don't hurt him, he didn't do nothing.

1587
01:33:49,795 --> 01:33:51,421
You hear me, he didn't do nothing!

1588
01:33:53,215 --> 01:33:54,508
- Raise your hands now!

1589
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,968
- I'm the one you want.

1590
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:56,969
- Tommy, don't!

1591
01:33:57,261 --> 01:33:57,803
- Drop the gun.

1592
01:33:58,095 --> 01:33:58,971
(gun fires)

1593
01:33:59,263 --> 01:34:01,557
(guns firing)

1594
01:34:07,855 --> 01:34:10,524
(dramatic music)

1595
01:34:20,951 --> 01:34:22,077
- Down, down, down. Down on the ground.

1596
01:34:22,369 --> 01:34:24,246
On the ground, on the ground.

1597
01:34:24,538 --> 01:34:25,956
