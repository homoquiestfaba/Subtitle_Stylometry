1
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,506
(ominous music)

2
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,823
- Is any of this even necessary?

3
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,951
That dipshit'll
be dead before me.

4
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,286
- Him again?

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,621
- Fine.

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,293
The date is February 23rd, 1982.

7
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,462
- Can I get some snacks in here?

8
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,216
- Son, 18 years and nine
months ago you were conceived

9
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,635
on the Gadbury Ice

10
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:56,139
and you've been the bane
of my existence ever since.

11
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,560
When I was alive, I
lay awake at night

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,482
wishing I had pulled out and
let you melt into the ice.

13
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:09,652
As the saying goes,
spilled semen.

14
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,822
You've enjoyed the finer
aspects of the Gadbury name

15
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,825
while never fulfilling
your family duties.

16
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,163
Our legacy as curling
elite goes back centuries

17
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,166
and now I'm afraid
that will die.

18
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,502
As my final farewell to you,

19
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,505
I'll give you one
last opportunity

20
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,548
to prove you are a Gadbury.

21
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,843
And if not, your
sweet half baby sister

22
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,013
will receive my whole fortune.

23
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,848
Maybe by the time you've
seen this, you will have-

24
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,896
I've been saving this,
my little caliente.

25
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:47,190
- [Father] Whoa.

26
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,193
- Rapido papi.

27
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,737
(grunting)
(sexy music)

28
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,224
- Yes.

29
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,271
(upbeat music)

30
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,933
(victorious music)

31
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,108
- Come on, come on, come
on, come on, push yourself.

32
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,444
(victorious music)

33
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,612
Push yourself!

34
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,865
(victorious music)

35
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,617
I want to see them titties

36
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,620
bouncing from your toenails
to your temples, tubby.

37
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,623
(victorious music)

38
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,962
Why you stop, man?

39
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,380
- What?

40
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,174
Come on man, it's hot.

41
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,300
- Hot?

42
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,802
Man, check the ladder.

43
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,637
Dang.

44
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,057
(victorious music)

45
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:18,257
Fuck is he doing?

46
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,220
What is you doing?

47
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,014
- I prefer baseball.

48
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,683
(sighs)

49
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,059
- Lunch porky.

50
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,227
And you!

51
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,942
Whatever it is you
selling, I ain't buying.

52
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,694
- I ain't selling, I'm serving.

53
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,362
- What the fuck is this?

54
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,572
This bitch open my mail.

55
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,200
- Pay your house
payment, you broke bitch.

56
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,870
- What is this?

57
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,293
- But I will get away with it.

58
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,714
My brain is a catalog of
Datelines and 48 Hour Mysteries.

59
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,550
(speaking in foreign language)

60
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,469
That's right bitch,
I'm drowning you.

61
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,098
That's my money, my inheritance,
every single penny of it.

62
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,725
You little bastard.

63
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,728
That's my money, you're
not getting any of it.

64
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,271
- Drowning me again, puto?

65
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,900
- Did you know about the tape?

66
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,238
Why didn't you tell me?

67
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,740
(speaking in foreign language)

68
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,742
- Because you're a piece of
shit that only took from dad.

69
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,452
He didn't want you
to have that money.

70
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,745
You don't even deserve it.

71
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,996
- That's not true.

72
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,623
I'm the true heir to
the Gadbury throne.

73
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,752
- You never even went on
the ice to throw with us.

74
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,253
Do you even curl?

75
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,255
- It's in my blood.

76
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,342
- Okay, so when's the last
time you went on the ice?

77
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,137
Exactly, I thought so.

78
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,264
You were too busy
fucking your mattress

79
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,766
and eating your damn Twinkies

80
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,517
to be part of the
family business.

81
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,644
- That's not true.

82
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,104
It's all mine.

83
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,523
- Listen up dipshit,

84
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,693
the lawyer is here and needs
you to sign some papers

85
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,112
so you're aware of
the terms, okay?

86
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,280
So you're gonna get ready,

87
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,448
you're gonna meet
me in the office

88
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,450
'cause Brett is waiting for us.

89
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,535
(yelling)

90
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,789
(ominous music)

91
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:14,999
(speaking in foreign language)

92
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,126
What's taking him so long?

93
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,628
- He's gonna be here,
don't worry about it.

94
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,004
- Look at him.

95
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,967
- What?

96
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,803
You know I have low blood sugar?

97
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,806
- Gordon, shut up
and sign the papers.

98
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,973
- Gordon.

99
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,979
I'm here to explain the
conditions of the trust.

100
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,357
Your father left
explicit instructions

101
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,525
that upon his death

102
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,860
the only way to receive
your inheritance,

103
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,743
which is valued
at $125.8 million,

104
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,495
is if you lead a curling team

105
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,830
to the regionals of
the Olympic trials.

106
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,164
That is the good news.

107
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,334
- Then what's the bad?

108
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,005
- The bad is the qualifiers
for the regionals

109
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,424
its in one month.

110
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,258
- What?

111
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,678
- Looks like you
better get going.

112
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,264
(tense music)

113
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,363
- How in the world am I gonna
put together a team this fast?

114
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,075
- Gordon, I can be of
service if you need.

115
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,869
- How's a blow job gonna help me

116
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,954
put together an all
area curling team?

117
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,250
Couldn't hurt.

118
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,295
- I meant with teammates.

119
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,881
I happen to know a couple of
unemployed curlers in the area

120
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,216
who'd be available
for the right price.

121
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,885
- Money is no object.

122
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,094
- Done.

123
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,554
I'll get in touch
with you, okay?

124
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,889
- Thank you.
- No problem.

125
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,234
- Fat boy, this is $45.

126
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,777
- With the promise of a million.

127
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,070
- How?

128
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,739
- All we have to do is
get to the regionals,

129
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,325
expose my sister
for the fraud she is

130
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,785
and the $125 million is mine.

131
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,995
- That shit is a month away.

132
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,747
- We better get to it then.

133
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,582
- Get yo ass out my house.

134
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,919
The bee don't get out
the bed for less than,

135
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,338
let's think $1,500.

136
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,091
- Tell you what?

137
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:32,929
$1,000 a week.

138
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,429
- Cash only tubby.

139
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,847
- I'll get you your money.

140
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,308
(women yelling)

141
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,102
Who is that?

142
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:42,772
- Oh that's Gerri Redding.

143
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,273
- Let me be.

144
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,442
Get off me, get off me.

145
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,110
Get off me.

146
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,779
- Gerri Redding,

147
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,531
the first female
drafted to the NFL.

148
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,033
- NFL?

149
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,327
- Professional football, man.

150
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,621
- We didn't watch the
sports of the commoners.

151
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,625
- Well, right after she was
drafted, she went crazy,

152
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,794
drugs, hookers.

153
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,712
She didn't even
get to play a game.

154
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,465
- Where can I find her?

155
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,385
- County fool.

156
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,472
(mysterious music)

157
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,652
- Are you the one
that bailed me out?

158
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,820
- Yes.

159
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,655
- Listen, I
appreciate it and all,

160
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,407
but I don't get down like that.

161
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,241
- I'm sorry?

162
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,660
- With dicks, your dick.

163
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,328
I'm not gonna suck
it or nothing.

164
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,163
This is a no dick zone,

165
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,750
not here, not here,
not here, not nowhere.

166
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,670
- No, if I wanted a blowjob

167
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,088
I'd get a much
better looking guy.

168
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,090
This is strictly professional.

169
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,091
Have you ever thought

170
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,844
about playing a true
professional sport?

171
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,513
- Man I ain't got time
for the bullshit today.

172
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,515
- Listen, I'm giving
you the opportunity

173
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,851
to elevate your physical prowess

174
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,856
to play a sport of
the gods, curling.

175
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,358
- Man, let me get
out of this bitch.

176
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,568
I'm out.

177
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,864
(upbeat music)

178
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,409
- Oh that looks
like a good site.

179
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,121
Wow, she's pretty.

180
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,207
(upbeat music)

181
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,090
She sweeps like an angel.

182
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,430
Hello Amor.

183
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,977
I have a proposito for you.

184
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,605
(upbeat music)

185
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:16,926
Pop!

186
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,428
Pop!

187
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,763
Pop!

188
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,936
- Geraldine, why you sneak
in my house like that?

189
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,437
- I been calling your name.

190
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,106
- I'm trying to get
a little shut eye

191
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,024
for my studio session tonight.

192
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,194
What's wrong, baby girl?

193
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,113
(sighs)

194
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,614
- I need your help.

195
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,617
You know the training ain't
going like as planned.

196
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,953
- You mean them fucked
up tires in the yard?

197
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,496
No shit.

198
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,998
- They about to take the house.

199
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,794
- You had it all,
first woman in the NFL

200
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,630
and you had to fuck it up

201
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,800
with them phat asses and blunts.

202
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,344
- I ain't come here to get a
lecture from black country.

203
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,971
- Yeah, I'm singing
country music.

204
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,641
I'm 'bout to change
the game, just like-

205
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,684
- Ray Charles?

206
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,311
You ain't no Ray Charles.

207
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,563
- Damn right.

208
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,899
He's six feet under
and I'm still standing.

209
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,651
I would love to help you

210
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,655
but I got all my money tied
in the video shoot next month.

211
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,699
I spent my life on your dreams.

212
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,076
Now I got to do mine, Geraldine.

213
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,870
Now just listen to my new song.

214
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,166
♪ Come on home little
darling I love ♪

215
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,338
Damn Geraldine, I was just
getting to the good part.

216
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,757
- Man, I'll listen later.

217
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,383
- As soon as this gets sold,

218
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,052
we gonna be back on
top, I'm telling you.

219
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,512
- Man whatever.

220
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,727
(upbeat music)

221
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,740
- What the?

222
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,617
Hell no.

223
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,245
(speaking in foreign language)

224
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,789
- Who you calling limp?

225
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,041
Your mama.

226
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,251
(speaking in foreign language)

227
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,213
- Yo, yo, shut the fuck up.

228
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,130
- You made it!

229
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,465
- Yeah, I made it, we good.

230
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,050
That direct deposit
went through.

231
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,470
Gordo, what the fuck?

232
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,306
This is wood.

233
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,267
(speaking in foreign language)

234
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,978
- Gordo is a bit
harsh, don't you think?

235
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,106
(speaking in foreign language)

236
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,818
- Why are we practicing wood?

237
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,111
- It's an old Gadbury secret.

238
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,281
If you can practice on
wood, the ice is a breeze.

239
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,576
- That's the stupidest
shit I ever heard.

240
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,410
I'm out.

241
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,417
- I guess you could send
that money back then, huh?

242
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,092
It's not just about
hitting the bullseye.

243
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,095
It's about keeping the other
team out of here as well.

244
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,599
- Fat boy, I'm the black
curling world champion.

245
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,142
Give me the God damn broom.

246
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,645
- Well who's gonna
throw the stone?

247
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,608
(speaking in foreign language)

248
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,989
- You better float
your ass down the wood.

249
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,991
(sighs)

250
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,370
(speaking in foreign language)

251
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,122
- I don't know.

252
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,790
Let me take care of him though.

253
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,462
Gordo, I'll throw
the stones for now

254
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,841
but we need to find
somebody ASAP, cool?

255
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,678
I got some cookies in
the back for you too.

256
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,638
Come on, pep up, Gordo.

257
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,641
(mysterious music)

258
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:04,737
(crowd applauding)
(dramatic music)

259
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,020
(upbeat music)

260
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,292
- Who are these people?

261
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,004
- Well you know
the beached whale

262
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,090
and that half naked gentlemen
got suspended for three years

263
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,591
for selling trades
to the Canadians.

264
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,428
And well that, that's the help.

265
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,346
(clapping)

266
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,098
Well done, tons of fun.

267
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,142
Looks like you're
just one practice away

268
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,102
from world domination.

269
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,813
- Eat a shit sandwich,
Smellsmerelda.

270
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,982
- Oh, touchy big brother,

271
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,858
being poor is keeping
you up at night?

272
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:09,778
- Hey Gordon, sorry
to disturb practice.

273
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,989
- Why do you even hang
out with my sister, Brett?

274
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,951
- Well I, I work for her.

275
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,287
- They used to call
her a gang banger

276
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,164
and not 'cause she reps a set.

277
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,540
- Can we get on with it?

278
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,292
- As part of the agreement,

279
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,671
you are to cease and desist
all use of family funds.

280
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,630
- What?

281
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,342
- Oh, you haven't told
your little butt buddies

282
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,969
that you're poor?

283
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,387
(speaking in foreign language)

284
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,225
The man is poor meaning
zippo, zero, nada.

285
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,478
I will circumcise you again.

286
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,813
- Do you understand
these conditions?

287
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,985
- Yes.

288
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,361
- Okay, can we go now?

289
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,656
(dark music)

290
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,539
No

291
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,416
I can't stand him.

292
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,549
Nice pooch.

293
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,093
- Don't let this
outfit fool you.

294
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,178
I'll snatch your
life, rich bitch.

295
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,931
(dark music)

296
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,854
- That was awesome.

297
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,731
- Man, let's hurry up and
get this show on the road.

298
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,775
Your girl baking
bread down here.

299
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,112
(dark music)

300
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,282
- Make sure that linebacker
bitch doesn't get in my way.

301
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,410
- I know she played a little
linebacker in high school.

302
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,205
(speaking in foreign language)

303
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,395
- How are you?

304
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,397
- I'm doing well, thank you.

305
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,941
- I was just looking
over these plans

306
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,946
and we're soon gonna have
the premier curling facility

307
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,908
in the world right
here in South Florida.

308
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,579
And it's all thanks
to your beautiful,

309
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,249
generous $100 million donation.

310
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,918
- Commissioner Pottinger,
you are too kind.

311
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,088
I would be remiss if I
didn't give all that I have

312
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,798
to the curling community here

313
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,009
after all it's
done for my family.

314
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,596
- Well, I can't
thank you enough.

315
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:52,983
- What am I 'posed to do?

316
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,110
- I love your enthusiasm.

317
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,778
Everything you need to know

318
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,363
is right here in this
instructional video.

319
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,041
(upbeat music)

320
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,300
- That's some bullshit.

321
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,511
- Come on, let's
go, you got this.

322
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,058
(upbeat music)

323
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,231
All right, there you
go, remember your form.

324
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,360
(upbeat music)

325
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,835
(grunting)

326
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,392
(upbeat music)

327
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,853
(grunting)

328
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,941
(upbeat music)

329
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,129
(speaking in foreign language)

330
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,424
- Gerri, you got a minute?

331
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,092
- What?

332
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,302
- Look, I know practice

333
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,886
didn't go as well as
you would've liked but-

334
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,138
- But nothing.

335
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,390
We suck. I suck.

336
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,934
- If you want, we can stay late
and I'll help you practice.

337
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,478
- Nah man, I got to
find a job, Gordo.

338
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,397
Man, I got problems.

339
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,898
This is fine and all,

340
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,109
but if I don't
work, I don't eat.

341
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,240
- Look, I know this isn't much-

342
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,826
- No man, no, I can't.

343
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,578
- Listen, if we're
gonna win this thing,

344
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,621
I need you here and here.

345
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,251
- Are you sure?

346
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,920
- If it'll keep you focused
and off the streets then...

347
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,429
(upbeat music)

348
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,287
- Have you ever felt like
magnetically involved

349
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,288
with another?

350
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,293
Exactly.

351
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,388
Are you gonna tip me
for a dance or what?

352
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,474
- Did you even dance?

353
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,644
- Yeah, five or six dances ago.

354
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,480
Look, I'm gonna
be up there soon.

355
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,316
Just give me a few dollars

356
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,569
and I'll just consider
it down payment.

357
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,530
- Hell no.

358
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,334
- You're not gonna
invite me for a drink?

359
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,837
- No.

360
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,674
(speaking in foreign language)

361
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,927
- I've been cooling over
here by myself vibing.

362
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,721
Get the fuck out my booth.

363
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,517
- Okay, okay, leaving.

364
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,439
(slurping)

365
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,190
- Bitch, what the
fuck is you doing?

366
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,066
(coughing)

367
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,026
- Excuse me, you
got a problem here?

368
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:05,861
- She offered me a drink

369
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,028
and then she got crazy.

370
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,072
- Man, she drank
out of my bottle.

371
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,199
- You can't be
threatening the dancers.

372
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,367
- Man.

373
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,871
(grunting)

374
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,634
I just-

375
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,927
- What the fuck was that?

376
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,971
I already bailed you out once

377
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,306
and now I got to
bail you out again

378
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,724
'cause you punched a
stripper in the face?

379
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,559
- First off, I
ain’t punch nobody.

380
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,060
- Look, it doesn't even matter.

381
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,312
We don't have to be friends.

382
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,147
We don't even have
to like each other.

383
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,441
Once we win the regionals,
you're off the hook,

384
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,110
but I'm not bailing
you out again.

385
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,581
You call yourself an athlete?

386
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,167
- What you say?

387
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,085
- We're a week away
from this match

388
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,587
and you're still sweeping
like a light skin.

389
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,342
- Can you even wrap
those thick ass fingers

390
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,968
around a broom and sweep?

391
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,429
- I'll wrap my hands
around your peanut head you

392
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,768
(speaking in foreign language)

393
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,610
- Y'all break that shit up.

394
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,945
- This the most hood shit

395
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,946
I ever been a part of.

396
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,615
You thought you was gonna
teach this how to throw.

397
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,783
- What that posed to mean?

398
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,203
- It's cool, you made
the league barely.

399
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,871
To be a curler,

400
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,165
you need heart

401
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,126
and the whole world know
you don't have that.

402
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,171
(grunting)

403
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,131
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

404
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,970
- Gerri, no, Gerri come on.

405
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,805
I need him, I need you both.

406
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,683
Gerri, I need you both.

407
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,811
[shouting]

408
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,854
For the love of
the broom!

409
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,649
- Get up off me, Sasquatch.

410
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,359
I'm out of here, Gordo.

411
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,194
I'mma go home, get
my dick sucked,

412
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,698
eat some cereal, get a
manicure and count some money.

413
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,366
Teach these scrubs how to throw.

414
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,826
- And make sure you grow,

415
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,369
short ass bitch.
- Fuck you.

416
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,038
- Man, I'm outta
here, I'm tired.

417
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,053
- Gordon, good to see you.

418
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,263
- [Gordon] You too.

419
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,433
- Your sister was just
telling me about the

420
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,019
eclectic team that
you've assembled.

421
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,729
- Fucking trash.

422
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,273
- I'm trying out a
new type of athlete

423
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,232
for this year's games.

424
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,692
- That team of yours

425
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,070
is only going to bring down our
family name with that hooker

426
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,365
and that manimal you have.

427
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,533
- Eat shit.

428
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,701
- Hey Gordon.

429
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,870
- She is a bastard.

430
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,872
My old man was
banging the maid when-

431
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,873
(speaking in foreign language)

432
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,041
- Really?

433
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,254
- Well, I guess I have
to thank you as well

434
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,589
for the generous donation.

435
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,716
- No, no, no, no
need to thank him.

436
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,217
He's done nothing.

437
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,304
- I took a shit in your
bathroom, no flush.

438
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,056
It was Taco Tuesday.

439
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,058
- Gordon.

440
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,315
Well, if that's everything,
I've got to get back to work.

441
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,484
So we'll be seeing
you at the regionals.

442
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,402
- Thank you commissioner.
- Thank you commissioner.

443
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,570
- Gordon.

444
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,780
- Thank you.

445
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,241
- Wait, you did wash
your hands, right?

446
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,746
(mysterious music)

447
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,171
- Get a good night's rest.

448
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,632
You're gonna need all your
strength for tomorrow's match.

449
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,175
- Yeah, whatever.

450
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,510
- Can I give you
a ride somewhere?

451
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,767
♪ So come on home,
little darling ♪

452
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,644
♪ I love you

453
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,106
♪ I didn't mean
to make you cry ♪

454
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:15,318
♪ I know I drink and gamble
and run around town ♪

455
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:19,531
♪ But my little darling,
I'm gonna settle down ♪

456
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,453
Glad you could
make it, Geraldine.

457
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,705
- What's good, pops?

458
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,622
How's it going?

459
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,165
- 'Bout finished up now.

460
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,834
On the last scene.

461
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,794
This is my partner, Anna.

462
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,003
- Hi I'm Coach Gordon.

463
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,800
- God damn, you mighty
piggly mother fucker.

464
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,969
- Well it takes one to know one.

465
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,471
(laughing)

466
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,726
- Thanks for giving baby girl

467
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,727
another shot at the big game.

468
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,812
- You coming out
for the big match?

469
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,148
- Never missed any of her
games, not gonna start now.

470
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,649
I've got to get back to work.

471
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,025
So I'll catch up
with you guys later.

472
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:56,985
Alright.

473
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,863
(country music)

474
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,159
- I want to thank you again
for a delightful performance.

475
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,660
- I'm glad y'all made it.

476
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,496
- You know, that Gerri's
really something special.

477
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,331
- One of the best
athletes I ever seen.

478
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,207
That's no lie.

479
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,667
But you know what they say?

480
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,004
Pussy is a mother fucker's
quickest downfall.

481
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,839
Take care of my girl, all right?

482
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,340
She's an asshole I know,

483
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,925
but there ain't
nothing she can't do

484
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,720
if she put her mind
to it and that include

485
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,850
- Curling.

486
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,768
- Curling?

487
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,519
When they sweeping
on ice and shit?

488
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,188
(laughing)

489
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,857
That ain't no sport.

490
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,359
I met as well get my fat
ass out there and do it.

491
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,694
- Please do me a favor

492
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,862
and get her home soon

493
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,739
so she can be on time
for the match tomorrow.

494
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,910
And Gerri, eight
a.m., don't forget.

495
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,295
(upbeat music)

496
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,810
They're late.

497
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,395
And where have you been?

498
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,733
(speaking in foreign language)

499
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,247
- Fuck man, this is
America, speak English.

500
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,748
(speaking in foreign language)

501
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,000
- This is Miami.

502
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,629
(speaking in foreign language)

503
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,299
- Where are you?

504
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,261
(speaking in foreign language)

505
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:52,433
(alarm blaring)
(ominous music)

506
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,039
- Those bitches robbed me!

507
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,458
Fuck!

508
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,627
Shit!

509
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,298
(dramatic music)

510
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,555
- What the hell?

511
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,308
- Man, bitches ain't shit.

512
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,644
- Hey, nice tits, Gordo,
long time, no see.

513
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,021
- Who's this fuck boy?

514
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,856
- Woah, I don't want any
beef with you, sir.

515
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,648
- Sir?

516
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,318
- This is the captain
of the All Curl Revue,

517
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,819
our opponents today.

518
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,154
- So maybe afterwards

519
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,032
I might let you take
this for a spin.

520
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,367
- I gotta a spin for your ass.

521
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,703
- [Brett] Gordon!

522
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,996
- Give me a minute.

523
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,668
(ominous music)

524
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,843
- I have to say that I am
truly disappointed in you.

525
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,930
- What did you do?

526
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,599
- Just told them about
your little scam.

527
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,769
Paying players in an
amateur tournament.

528
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,396
(speaking in foreign language)

529
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,690
Shame on you.

530
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,527
- And I was truly
rooting for you, Gordon,

531
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,074
but this is disgraceful.

532
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:35,286
You've got 15 minutes
find a new player

533
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,705
or you're gonna have to forfeit.

534
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,718
(ominous music)

535
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,764
- What did you do?

536
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,224
- What the fuck
you done did now?

537
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,476
(speaking in foreign language)

538
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,271
- I had to come
clean, Gordo, my bad.

539
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,898
- My bad, what?

540
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,899
- What's going on?

541
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,901
- Rico just got disqualified.

542
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,403
(speaking in foreign language)

543
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,655
- No, your money just
got us disqualified.

544
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,448
- What did my sister give you?

545
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,741
(mimics buzzing)

546
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,910
You knew how much
this meant to me.

547
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,954
- Got a way better deal though.

548
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,247
- Better deal, huh?

549
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,456
[punch]

550
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,752
- What is happening here?

551
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,422
- That beast just physically
assaulted someone.

552
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,798
- [Gerri] Bitch!

553
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,842
- The whole team
should be disqualified.

554
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,427
- Call me out my name again

555
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,928
and yo ass gon' be next.

556
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,430
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

557
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,764
Enough is enough, okay?

558
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,640
It's time.

559
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,311
Either you have a third
party or you're disqualified.

560
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,982
(dramatic music)

561
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:55,116
- I'm gonna get you bitch.

562
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,458
(suave club music)

563
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,619
- Come on, you got this.

564
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,123
(club music)

565
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,047
- I put the faith on you.

566
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,133
- Fuck up dem gigalos!

567
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,389
- Go soft and try to
split their stones

568
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,141
and try to knock their
top one out of place.

569
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,726
And Nina, sweep hard to the left

570
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,562
so that the stone
picks up any speed.

571
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,729
Got it?
- Okay, okay.

572
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,733
(club music)

573
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,824
- Eat shit, gigolos.

574
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,161
(club music)

575
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,459
(cheering)

576
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,920
(club music)

577
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,758
- Come on, Geraldine,
get it going.

578
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,141
- Practice run.

579
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,601
It's okay Nina.

580
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,437
(speaking in foreign language)

581
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,146
- Me?

582
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,022
(speaking in foreign language)

583
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,106
- You're sweeping
is embarrassing.

584
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,316
I'm starting to think

585
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,484
your online sweeping
business is bullshit.

586
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,111
- Man, how long
we gotta do this?

587
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,362
- It's eight rounds.

588
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,531
Didn't you learn
anything from that video?

589
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,699
- No.

590
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,120
- Curl harder, curl harder.

591
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,624
(cheering)

592
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,299
(club music)

593
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,641
- You shit gigolo.

594
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,521
(cheering)
(club music)

595
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,698
- This is it.

596
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,493
We have to make
every point count.

597
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,161
Gerri, you hit it
from the inside

598
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,996
and Nina will bring
it home for the win.

599
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,415
(club music)

600
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,170
- Fuck up those gigolos.

601
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,264
(club music)

602
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,067
- Now those guys know
how to fucking curl.

603
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,739
- That's some bullshit.

604
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,791
- Well, it was
hard fought match.

605
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,920
Good effort.

606
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,798
Anyway, don't hang
your head ladies.

607
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,303
Got another two weeks
and try it again.

608
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,388
- Who are we playing?

609
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,765
- Only the top team
in south Florida.

610
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,435
- The So Flow Curls?

611
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,730
- Who are they?

612
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,398
(speaking in foreign language)

613
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,067
- Only one of the top
teams in the country.

614
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,153
They migrated Minnesota
to South Florida

615
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,946
during the cold winter of 2000.

616
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,284
- And they haven't lost a
match in 20 years. (laughs)

617
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,828
- You know every time
you open your mouth

618
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,997
I want to knock your
teeth out, bitch.

619
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,249
(speaking in foreign language)

620
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,668
- Can I borrow you for a minute?

621
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,253
- Of course.

622
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,592
- Eight o'clock
tomorrow morning.

623
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,927
- And how are we
supposed to beat them?

624
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,012
- Faith.

625
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,015
- Man, get the fuck out.

626
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,350
We done.

627
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,814
- Where have you been?

628
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,274
- Well I had a few
errands this morning.

629
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,150
I started with the dry cleaner.

630
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,443
- Zip it.

631
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,029
And you, you were worried.

632
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,950
- Well, I have to
admit I was worried

633
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,288
but after watching
Gordon and those idiots

634
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,626
I am sure that we're
gonna make South Florida

635
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:43,214
the center of the curling
world with his inheritance.

636
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,008
- Hey, is he gonna be okay?

637
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:51,138
- No, he's entering
funnel territory.

638
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,974
- Funnel?

639
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,311
(quirky music)

640
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,362
- Our father was a strict man

641
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,822
and he always pressured Gordon

642
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,865
into taking over
the family business.

643
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:13,661
And when Gordon would
disappoint, which was always,

644
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,329
he would turn to the funnel.

645
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,004
(groaning)

646
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,193
- He's gonna die.

647
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,446
- Not soon enough.

648
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,714
(soft music)

649
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,426
(phone ringing)

650
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,388
(groaning)

651
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,435
- Hey.

652
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,395
Who in the hell
call somebody

653
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,898
at five o'clock in the morning?

654
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,233
Is somebody dead?

655
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,155
Oh, all right, I'll be there.

656
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,454
Oh shit.

657
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,335
(mysterious music)

658
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,843
- What in the hell are
you doing Geraldine?

659
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,429
- Pops, what's good?

660
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,098
Can I get you one of these?

661
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,267
- Girl, ain't you got
practice tomorrow?

662
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,812
- Man that shit over.

663
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,981
- Girl, where you
get all this money?

664
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,943
- So I called the
addiction specialist.

665
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,278
They taught me to control
my booty cravings.

666
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,032
- What's wrong with you?

667
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,450
It ain't over.

668
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,285
There's one more game.

669
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,621
- You was there yesterday.

670
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,498
You was there.

671
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,292
We finished.

672
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,460
- When you gonna stop

673
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,170
giving up on yourself
before you start?

674
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,632
- Oh so now you care?

675
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,969
Now you want to be a dad?

676
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,679
- I'm always your dad.

677
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,306
- Where was you after the draft?

678
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,809
When I lost everything,
where was you?

679
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,561
- You forgot all I did for you?

680
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,647
You made the draft
because of me.

681
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,734
- Yeah, you was a good
coach or whatever,

682
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,321
but when I needed a
dad, you wasn't there.

683
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:58,867
Man, take your ass home unless
you want to pay for this.

684
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,329
- I'll take her home.

685
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,250
- She grown, not
my problem anymore.

686
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,016
(speaking in foreign language)

687
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,059
(giggling)

688
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,689
- What is you doing
in my house, stripper?

689
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,524
- It's Lola, honey.

690
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,360
- That don't answer
why you in my house.

691
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,114
- I told your papa I would
take care of you last week

692
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,116
so (giggling)

693
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,869
- A week, last week?

694
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,371
- Yeah, you've been
in a coma for 10 days.

695
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,957
I've being here
taking care of you.

696
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,293
I wouldn't let
anything happen to you.

697
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,253
Okay, mi amor?

698
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,713
- What's going on?

699
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,048
(groaning)

700
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,258
I can't move my legs.

701
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,219
- Oh yeah, you were
temporarily paralyzed

702
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,890
but I nursed you back to health.

703
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,726
- Who else in my house?

704
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,772
- Well I had to take the
week off to take care of you

705
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,901
so I had to conduct some
business out of our house.

706
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,737
And tada!

707
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,072
Ready?

708
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,448
Hop on.

709
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,910
- Bitch, didn't I say
I can't move my legs?

710
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,246
(gentle music)

711
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,754
- There you go.

712
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,590
- What these ho's
doing in my house?

713
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,759
- I ain't no ho,
control your girl.

714
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,760
- Relax.

715
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,473
You, we're guests.

716
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,475
Do not disrespect.

717
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,440
Look, they were gonna
take your house.

718
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,027
So me and my girl, we had
to make some extra money.

719
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,112
- You're welcome.

720
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,615
- We set up in here.

721
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:05,119
But don't worry, I locked her
bedroom through the parties.

722
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,286
- Parties?

723
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,162
- Big ones.

724
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,956
- Mmhmm, we entertained
a couple of times

725
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,457
just to make some money.

726
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,127
I couldn't leave you alone.

727
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,628
I needed to work from home.

728
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,462
- Home?

729
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,714
This my house.

730
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,298
Ain't nobody come by?

731
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,301
- Yeah, your dad, he did
come a couple of times.

732
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,053
He actually stayed
for the parties.

733
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,974
- Okay hot pudding,
let that booty roll.

734
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,809
- And my team?

735
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,812
- About that...

736
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,022
(flushing)

737
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,652
- Thank you for a nice evening.

738
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,037
Why are you so distant?

739
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,081
You were never like this before.

740
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,041
- Man, I was in a coma.

741
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,921
(knocking)

742
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,220
Where's Gordo?

743
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,680
- You lived,

744
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,850
What a shame.

745
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,351
- Move bitch.

746
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,854
- You know you can't roll
up into my house like this.

747
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,734
You know my brother's very
sick and he can't be disturbed.

748
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:22,029
- You're gonna let (speaking
in foreign language).

749
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,033
- You know you can't help
that fat fuck anyway.

750
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,459
- What happened?

751
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,754
- The inevitable, tubo
ate himself to death.

752
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,929
- Get up coach, man, we
still got work to do.

753
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,973
- Isn't that precious?

754
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,277
(groaning)

755
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,280
- Something's happening.

756
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,329
- Nothing, it's feeding time.

757
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,166
(gentle music)

758
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,338
- Come on, big guy,

759
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,257
I know you in there somewhere.

760
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,136
Wake up!

761
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,432
(groaning)

762
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,776
- Guacamole, is that you?

763
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,613
What happened?

764
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,032
- Just don't move, okay?

765
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,450
Relax.

766
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,952
- Gerri?

767
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:52,953
- I'm here, coach.

768
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,622
- Coach?

769
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,000
Coach.

770
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,170
(gentle music)

771
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,802
Do something.

772
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,305
No stop, oh my God.

773
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,223
But,

774
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,559
how?

775
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,645
- This ain't my first coma.

776
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,689
Let's get the band
back together.

777
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,066
- And how the hell
am I supposed to go?

778
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,207
- You'll be walking
within five hours max

779
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,252
and don't worry, the night
terrors go away in a few weeks.

780
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,010
- He woke up.

781
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,933
I know, the pig in
the blanket won't die.

782
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,393
You better take care of him.

783
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:01,355
If not, the curling
center and the money,

784
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,023
it all goes up in smoke.

785
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,860
(dark music)

786
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,533
(upbeat music)

787
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,628
- Nina, we're here to rescue you

788
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,089
from a life of
indentured servitude.

789
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,968
(speaking in foreign language)

790
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,223
- It don't look like
she want to be saved.

791
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,433
- Human trafficking is no joke.

792
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,395
You of all people
should understand that.

793
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,397
- What that supposed to mean?

794
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,773
- We will protect you.

795
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,149
Run to your freedom.

796
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,443
(speaking in foreign language)

797
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,571
- All right,

798
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,161
She won't be needing this.

799
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,086
That's going with me.

800
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,759
- Well that's it,
I'm officially poor.

801
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,012
Where do you guys
get your food stamps?

802
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,847
- So you just gonna give up?

803
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,767
(speaking in foreign language)

804
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,479
- You know a good
restaurant around here?

805
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,605
Last one buys.

806
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,356
Not it.

807
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,107
- Oh, not it.

808
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,193
(speaking in foreign language)

809
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,158
- I think I know a spot.

810
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,538
(mysterious music)

811
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,339
(speaking in foreign language)

812
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,383
- Yeah, pops talked
to the owner,

813
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,342
we can practice here.

814
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,513
- Enough grab ass,
let's get to work.

815
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,516
(upbeat music)

816
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,235
(groaning)

817
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,075
- Yeah, mother fucker!
Yeah!

818
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,078
(upbeat music)

819
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,257
(country music)

820
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,354
What the hell are you doing?

821
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,773
- You bout to be a big sister.

822
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,775
- Are you serious?

823
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,237
- Yes, little mulato on his way.

824
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,738
- Bruh.

825
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,783
- Shit, I still got the thunder.

826
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,909
- Come on, man.

827
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,410
You better sit your old ass down

828
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,412
before you gone through
your hip out of place.

829
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,918
- Have a toast with me.

830
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,589
To the family and
the fire in my loins.

831
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,716
- Come on, man, it ain't
got to be all that.

832
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,218
- Now I know you didn't
just come over here

833
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,220
just to have a drink
with your old man.

834
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,388
What's on your mind?

835
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,559
- I just wanted to
make sure we was good.

836
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,227
- You're an asshole

837
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,230
but you always gonna
be my child so we good.

838
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,942
I'm gonna be there
cheering you on

839
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,819
like I have all your life.

840
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,737
- Thanks pop.

841
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,906
- You know this
don't change things

842
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,949
how I care about you?

843
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:44,619
- Man, listen, I'm
almost 40 years old.

844
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,246
If you want to be
running around here

845
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,332
with little jits in
your '70s, be my guest.

846
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,668
- Geraldine, you
don't understand.

847
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,087
It's nice to have a
little love in the house.

848
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,424
Plus, my new medicine

849
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,759
put a little lead back
in the old pencil.

850
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,428
- Man, why you?

851
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,431
- We're gonna give those
misfits a good spanking,

852
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,183
South Florida style.

853
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,642
- And what do you
think about that?

854
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,102
- I think it's blasphemy

855
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,687
It's a mockery of a good sport

856
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,272
and they think that
they can just show up

857
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,274
and learn how to
sweep in a few weeks.

858
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,611
And that football
player, Gerri, is it,

859
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,279
what cage did they
find her from?

860
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,200
- Gerri, go back to
the black sports.

861
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,704
- That was a tad racist.

862
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,497
Back to you, Ted.

863
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,333
- What the fuck
they talking 'bout?

864
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,546
- Beat their mother fucking
ass tomorrow, Geraldine.

865
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,222
(whimsical music)

866
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,494
- Let me guess.
- Geez.

867
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,079
- You slept walked
into the kitchen again?

868
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,331
- I had a light dinner.

869
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,082
- Mmhmm.

870
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,541
- What are you doing up?

871
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:17,337
- Somebody in this family has
to put in some actual work

872
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,172
while you eat yourself to death.

873
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,551
- Ugh, I've had enough,
I'm going to bed.

874
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,387
Good luck tomorrow, loser.

875
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,514
- Bitch.

876
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,397
(tense music)

877
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,369
A land deal with
Commissioner Pottinger?

878
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,415
South Florida Curling Complex?

879
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,711
(tense music)

880
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,929
What are you doing here?

881
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,390
- I can't wish my
brother good luck?

882
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,642
Look, it's a big day and all

883
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,979
and I thought that you should
have dad's curling broom

884
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,063
for the big match.

885
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,064
- Aw.

886
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,071
- Nighty night, big brother.

887
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:28,116
You will not fuck
this deal up for me.

888
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,003
(upbeat music)

889
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,601
(gentle music)

890
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,121
(speaking in foreign language)

891
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,499
- Whatever the fuck you said.

892
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,048
Oh hey pops.

893
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,883
- Ain't mine.

894
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,134
- What?

895
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,553
- That baby.

896
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,347
I made sure of that.

897
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,308
I only do anal at
the strip club.

898
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,727
- I'm not pregnant, okay?

899
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,647
I'm here with mi amor.

900
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,650
- My Geraldine?

901
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,195
- Yeah, we just had a
connection, you know?

902
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,822
And the sex, and the sex is-

903
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,240
- Not another damn word.

904
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,076
- Like father, like daughter.

905
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,539
- What the shit is this?

906
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,666
We curling on the
soccer field now?

907
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,209
(speaking in foreign language)

908
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,420
- Man, how long you
been in America?

909
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,588
You don't speak English yet?

910
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,091
(speaking in foreign language)

911
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:09,717
- The fuck?

912
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,555
What is you doing here?

913
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,391
- Hi, mi amor.

914
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,103
I'm working the day
shift so I thought

915
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,856
I'll take my break
to watch you play.

916
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,857
- Oh no.

917
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,193
- Geraldine, you
up with this ho?

918
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,612
- I ain't no ho, okay?

919
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,866
I've changed since we've
been living together.

920
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,869
- Geraldine, you've got
this ho up in your house?

921
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,120
- Our house.

922
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,580
I pay the rent.

923
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,792
- Good luck this afternoon.

924
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,920
Where's cankles?

925
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,255
- He'll be here.

926
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,758
- One can only hope so.

927
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,598
- Yeah, she's a diddy bitch.

928
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,811
(upbeat music)

929
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,449
- God damn Nazis are coming.

930
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,244
(flushing)

931
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,250
(farting)

932
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,299
(clears throat)

933
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,099
- There you are.

934
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:46,773
So is everything in order?

935
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,651
- You have nothing
to worry about.

936
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:53,363
Let's just you say
Gordon is dead tired.

937
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,824
- Perfect.

938
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:05,625
- [Female] I think he looks

939
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,628
really cute in yellow.
That's what I think.

940
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,174
Where's your portly
third member?

941
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,803
Or is this on the team now?

942
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,012
- This?

943
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,515
I have a pistola in my
bolsa, little bitch.

944
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,851
- Mmm, gang violence in curling,

945
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,395
that's a first.

946
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,230
- Oh he'll be here.

947
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,149
- He better hurry, the
match is about to start.

948
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,026
Although it won't matter.

949
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,319
Afterwards, I'm gonna have

950
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,655
your little lady
friend here deported.

951
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:36,739
- Que?

952
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,741
- Adios muchachos.

953
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,536
- Man, fuck these clowns.

954
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,837
(tense music)

955
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,609
(sniffing)

956
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,530
- Help, help, help!

957
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,622
- Pop, we can't find Gordon.

958
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,749
- He probably dead.

959
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,584
- Man, why would you say that?

960
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:30,793
- A man that big.

961
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:31,878
- Pop.

962
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,631
Aight, I'll go check on him.

963
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,548
- I'll drive.

964
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,133
I know where he stays.

965
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,302
Got to make sure
mi amor is fine.

966
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:43,723
- Y'all hurry up,
hurry up, come on.

967
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,058
Damn, man.

968
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:48,936
- So hungry.

969
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,400
- God, hurry it up there.

970
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,234
- I'm going.

971
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,487
- I see lights coming.

972
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,825
- Help, I'm in here!

973
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,785
- Hurry up.

974
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,078
You know I'm black as night.

975
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,163
They done called the
police already.

976
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,956
- I'm doing it.

977
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:09,916
Just relax.

978
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:14,420
Yes, yes.

979
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,928
- I'm in here!

980
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,305
Get these things off me.

981
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,267
Thank God.

982
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:31,854
- There we go.

983
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,444
(groaning)

984
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,032
(tense music)

985
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:48,955
- Well ladies, can't hold
this match up any longer.

986
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:52,792
If Gordon is not here in
the next five minutes,

987
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,128
got to forfeit the match.

988
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,799
- What's the concern everyone?

989
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,468
- I know you did this,
you raggedy ass bitch.

990
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,180
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

991
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,473
- I'm gonna knock your ass out

992
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,142
before the day over
with, believe that.

993
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,893
- I'm so scared.

994
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:15,022
- Let's not do that.
- Wait, wait, I'm here.

995
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,153
(victorious music)

996
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,336
- Mmhmm.

997
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,048
(laughing)

998
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:45,386
- He ran out of time as he
ran his fat ass from the car.

999
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,181
Commissioner, call the match.

1000
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,683
- I'm here.

1001
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,856
I'm here.

1002
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,401
I'm (barfing)

1003
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:03,362
- What the fuck?

1004
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,364
Someone clean this up.

1005
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:08,034
- It's only bacon,
it'll come right out.

1006
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,369
- Oh God damn it.

1007
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,412
- I'm ready.

1008
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:21,130
- Well, I guess the match is on.

1009
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,637
(upbeat music)

1010
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,983
All right, here we are.

1011
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,736
Now you know the rules.

1012
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,405
Great Gadbury's,

1013
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,743
if you lose this match,

1014
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,830
you are eliminated and will
not move on to regionals.

1015
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:00,795
So Flow Curls, are you ready?

1016
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,171
- Yeah.

1017
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,299
- Great Gadbury's,
are you ready?

1018
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,467
- [All] Yeah.

1019
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,426
- Hell yeah.

1020
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:13,432
- All right, well let's
get ready to curl.

1021
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:18,020
- Hoes before bros. (laughs)

1022
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,939
- That ain't even
how that shit go.

1023
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:26,487
(clock ticking)
(tense music)

1024
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:31,450
- Now, I grew up
with these D-bags.

1025
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,452
Let's try to block 'em at
the top of the bullseye

1026
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,704
and we've got a chance.

1027
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,331
- Now you now you ain't
grow with these kids

1028
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,708
with your old ass

1029
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,293
but it's good to
have you back, Gordo.

1030
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,669
(speaking in foreign language)

1031
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,461
Break!

1032
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,549
(tense music)

1033
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,573
- Come on girls,
there's still time.

1034
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,950
I know we can do this.

1035
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,409
We've practiced so hard.

1036
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,578
- All right, everyone.

1037
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:58,496
That's half time.

1038
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,372
Take 10.

1039
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,793
- Save the embarrassment
and quit now.

1040
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,920
There's no turning
back after this.

1041
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,464
- Gadbury's never quit.

1042
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,424
- Save that talk for
the soup kitchen.

1043
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,885
- Come on girls, I
know we're down, but-

1044
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,887
- We done.

1045
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,222
They some real white boys,

1046
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,431
we can't beat that.

1047
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:20,267
- We just have to
have some faith.

1048
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,560
(groans)

1049
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,609
(farting)

1050
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:30,736
- Party time.

1051
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:33,406
(tense music)

1052
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,201
(pooping)

1053
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:46,252
(gunfire blasting)

1054
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,086
(groaning)

1055
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,424
(gunfire blasting)

1056
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,597
(groaning)

1057
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,516
(gasps)

1058
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,104
- His dick.

1059
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,237
Sven's dead.

1060
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:15,156
Oh my God, something
happened to him, he's dead.

1061
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,615
- What the hell?

1062
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,035
- What's going on?

1063
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:23,748
- This isn't good.

1064
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,794
- So what do we do?

1065
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:32,631
- Well I,

1066
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:39,138
So Flow Curlers, if you don't
have another player then

1067
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,682
you're gonna have to forfeit.

1068
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:44,977
- What do you mean?

1069
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,979
Sven is dead.

1070
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:48,230
Who would do that?

1071
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,692
- No, no, no, no, no,
we need to reschedule.

1072
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,486
You need to
reschedule the match.

1073
01:07:53,486 --> 01:08:00,326
- No, I understand but
curling waits for no one.

1074
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:07,333
So the winner who goes
on to the regionals is

1075
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,755
the Great Gadbury's.

1076
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,008
- What, I couldn't hear you?

1077
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:20,513
- I said the Great Gadbury's?

1078
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,015
(cheering)
(upbeat music)

1079
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,059
- You animals, he's dead.

1080
01:08:26,059 --> 01:08:27,937
(cheering)

1081
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,064
- This cannot be happening.

1082
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,232
- I'm rich.

1083
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:34,026
- We got it all, all
our money, that's mine.

1084
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,278
(speaking in foreign language)

1085
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,197
- Yes.

1086
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,532
- Gordon, this is for you.

1087
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:45,496
(tense music)

1088
01:08:46,746 --> 01:08:48,749
- Where the fuck have
you been all day?

1089
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:50,542
- Funny story-

1090
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:52,253
(shushing)

1091
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,724
- That shit don't
happen in black sports.

1092
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,772
(ominous music)

1093
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,529
- Son, I'm assuming you failed

1094
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,073
to complete the task I gave you

1095
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:24,243
so I sent in a spy
to assure your win.

1096
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:28,289
You're too important to the
Gadbury name to be a loser.

1097
01:09:28,872 --> 01:09:31,584
If any nefarious
activity took place,

1098
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,086
you will find in the
safe a signed pardon

1099
01:09:35,086 --> 01:09:37,715
by my pal Ronald Reagan.

1100
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,719
The fortune is yours,
Gordon, all of it.

1101
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,805
I'll be damned if I
let a fat backside

1102
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,807
and a tongue that rolls her R's,

1103
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,434
oh those R's,

1104
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:52,979
damned if I let that
spoil the Gadbury name.

1105
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,942
You're an idiot but
you're my fat idiot.

1106
01:09:58,986 --> 01:09:59,820
- Papa.

1107
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,907
- My final order of business,

1108
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:06,952
get that maid's daughter off
the premises immediately.

1109
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:12,958
The Gadbury's get blackmailed
by no one, no one.

1110
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,794
We do the blackmailing
around here

1111
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:17,796
and don't you ever forget it.

1112
01:10:22,675 --> 01:10:24,678
- I miss you so much.

1113
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,110
(upbeat music)

1114
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:47,743
- This is ridiculous.

1115
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,162
I demand to return
to my house now.

1116
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:52,539
- Not so fast, little sis.

1117
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:54,375
- What is that supposed to mean?

1118
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:57,253
- As of five minutes ago,

1119
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:01,173
Gordon is officially sole
heir of the Gadbury throne.

1120
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:06,428
This includes his $125.8
million and all other assets.

1121
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,889
- Oh, Gordo, you are rich.

1122
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,266
You better share.

1123
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,102
- You speak English?

1124
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:14,812
- Yeah.

1125
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,438
- What about me?

1126
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,900
- I regret to inform you your
father left you with nothing.

1127
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,693
- You broke.

1128
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:21,986
(laughing)

1129
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,154

(speaking in foreign language)

1131
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,825
- So she broke?

1132
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,827
- And what are you
gonna do about it?

1133
01:11:33,621 --> 01:11:36,959

1134

That big bitch.

1139
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,963
I will have my revenge.

1140
