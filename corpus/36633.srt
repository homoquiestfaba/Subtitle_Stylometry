1
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:37,199
Young people from all over the globe...

2
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,278
are joining up
to fight for the future.

3
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:42,086
- I'm doing my part.
- I'm doing my part.

4
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,603
- I'm doing my part.
- I'm doing my part too.

5
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,557
They're doing their part,
are you?

6
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:52,036
Join the Mobile Infantry
and save the world.

7
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:54,516
Service guarantees citizenship.

8
00:00:58,287 --> 00:01:01,199
The bugs send
another meteor our way...

9
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:03,005
but this time we're ready.

10
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:06,397
Planetary defences
are better than ever.

11
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:13,315
Klendathu, source
of the bug meteor attacks...

12
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,683
orbits a twin star system whose
brutal gravitational forces...

13
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:19,679
produce an unlimited supply
of bug meteorites...

14
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:22,281
in the form
of this asteroid belt.

15
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,517
To ensure the safety
of our solar system...

16
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,996
Klendathu
must be eliminated.

17
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:31,086
We break net now and take you
live to Klendathu...

18
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,806
where the invasion
has begun.

19
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:37,163
EXQ uplink on two, one.
You're on.

20
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:39,715
- We've just landed here
on what cap troopers...
- Move, move, move!

21
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:41,798
- are calling Big K,
- Come on! Move, move!

22
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,355
- with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division!
- Come on!

23
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:47,564
It's an ugly planet,
a bug planet!

24
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:50,241
A planet hostile to life
as we know it!

25
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:54,886
Help me!

26
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:08,160
- Come on! Go, go, go!
- Keep moving!

27
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:09,839
Get out of here now!

28
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,320
Kitten, no!

29
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:31,806
Oh, God!

30
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:33,922
Oh, God!

31
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:53,003
Rico. Rico. Rico!

32
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,004
Pay attention.

33
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:00,684
Sorry, Mr Rasczak.

34
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,723
Let's sum up.

35
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,480
This year we explored
the failure of democracy...

36
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,285
- Bad boy.
- how the social scientists
brought our world...

37
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,119
to the brink of chaos.

38
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:11,846
We talked about the veterans,
how they took control...

39
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:16,045
and imposed the stability
that has lasted for generations since.

40
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:17,845
You know these facts...

41
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:20,157
but have I taught you anything
of value this year?

42
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:21,726
Hmm?

43
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:23,684
You. Why are only citizens
allowed to vote?

44
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:25,200
It's a reward,

45
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,926
what the Federation gives you
for doing Federal Service.

46
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,077
No. No.

47
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:33,523
Something given
has no value.

48
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:36,758
Look, when you vote, you are
exercising political authority.

49
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:40,635
You're using force. And force,
my friends, is violence,

50
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:44,402
the supreme authority from which
all other authority is derived.

51
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:47,445
Uh, my mother always said
violence never solves anything.

52
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,960
Really?

53
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:52,357
I wonder what the city fathers
of Hiroshima would say about that.

54
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,199
You.

55
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:57,996
They probably wouldn't say anything.
Hiroshima was destroyed.

56
00:03:58,087 --> 00:03:59,361
Correct.

57
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,517
Naked force has resolved
more issues...

58
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:04,041
throughout history
than any other factor.

59
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:07,437
The contrary opinion, that
violence never solves anything,

60
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:09,722
is wishful thinking
at its worst.

61
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:12,844
People who forget that
always pay.

62
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:16,363
Rico, what's the moral
difference, if any...

63
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:18,324
between a civilian
and a citizen?

64
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:21,319
A citizen accepts personal
responsibility for the safety...

65
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:24,558
of the body politic,
defending it with his life.

66
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:28,560
- A civilian does not.
- The exact words of the text.

67
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:31,320
But do you understand it?
Do you believe it?

68
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,400
- I don't know.
- Of course you don't.

69
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:37,478
I doubt anyone here would
recognize civic virtue...

70
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,285
if it reached up
and bit you in the ass.

71
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:58,365
Not here.

72
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:00,483
Come on, let's see if they
posted the math final.

73
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,684
- Rico, we gonna take Tesla?
- We're gonna kill 'em.

74
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:09,126
Remember, all graduating seniors
must fill out a 710 form.

75
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,516
First thing Fleet Academy
looks at is your math scores.

76
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:12,926
Wish me luck.

77
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:22,885
- Way to go.
- Good job.

78
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,083
Your turn.
Hold on.

79
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,635
I want to talk to Marco.
His sister's at Fleet.

80
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,479
- Marco.
- Hi, Carmen.

81
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,956
- What do you hear about Roxy?
- She made pilot.

82
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:34,880
- She did?
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,356
Thirty-five percent.
Very nice.

84
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:43,518
Look at that. Thirty-five
percent, ladies and gentlemen.

85
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:44,835
Big numbers.

86
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,724
- Carl.
- Sorry.

87
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:55,875
So, you haven't done it yet,
have you? Don't lie.

88
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,605
I'm not in any hurry.

89
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,719
- Others are waiting.
- And?

90
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:03,845
- Did you read her mind?
- Don't have to.

91
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,077
It's pretty clear
what she wants.

92
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,476
Yeah, but I want Carmen.

93
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,637
- Aw, you got it bad.
- Bye, Marco.

94
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:12,046
Hey, don't forget about
this afternoon.

95
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:14,641
He's always late when he walks
you home to fish for a kiss.

96
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:16,638
Get out of here.

97
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,799
- Marco's sister made pilot.
- So will you.

98
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:23,846
I mean, imagine flying a half
a million tons of starship.

99
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:25,485
You gotta have
nerves of steel.

100
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:28,001
Yeah, you do. Let's see
how yours hold up.

101
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,202
You may begin.

102
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:42,726
Aw, come on, it's just a bug.
You better put your goggles on.

103
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,206
"Just a bug."

104
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:48,166
We humans like to think we are
nature's finest achievement.

105
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:50,397
I'm afraid
it just isn't true.

106
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:54,765
This Arkellian sand beetle
is superior in many ways.

107
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:59,363
It reproduces in vast
numbers, has no ego...

108
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:03,326
has no fear, doesn't
know about death...

109
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:07,116
and so is the perfect
selfless member of society.

110
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:09,596
But humans have created
art, mathematics...

111
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:12,201
and interstellar travel.

112
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,165
True. But before you
let that go to your head...

113
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:17,477
take the example
of the Arachnids...

114
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:20,684
a highly evolved
insect society.

115
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,645
By human standards,
they are relatively stupid...

116
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:27,606
but their evolution stretches
over millions of years...

117
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:30,075
- and now...
- Here, take this.

118
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,476
they can
colonize planets...

119
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,365
by hurling their spore
into space.

120
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:37,597
Okay, I think we got it.

121
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:38,961
That's the heart.

122
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,239
And here's the stomach.

123
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,599
Nerves of steel, huh?

124
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,480
Don't think about it.
Just go on instinct.

125
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,319
Try to visualize it.

126
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,482
I see the ace of spades.

127
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,881
You know,
statistically speaking,

128
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,686
you should have accidentally
guessed right by now.

129
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:27,397
- Try another.
- So my psychic abilities
are zero and I'm unlucky.

130
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,443
No, luck's not a factor.

131
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:32,280
No one really knows why some people
are sensitive and some aren't.

132
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:35,359
Who knows? Maybe it's a new
stage of human evolution.

133
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,166
That's why they do these
kind of Federal studies.

134
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:41,159
What-- Cyrano--
Oh, shit. Time out.

135
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:42,566
Oh, he just wants
some attention.

136
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,205
You don't play
with him any more.

137
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,436
Cyrano.

138
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,440
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

139
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,603
How do you make him do that?

140
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:04,963
Oh, I gave him the impression
there's a grub crawling up my mom's leg.

141
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,719
He's on a mission
to go eat it.

142
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:12,200
Ow! Oh! Get out!
Get off my leg! Oh! Carl!

143
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:16,238
I sure hope you don't do
anything like that to me.

144
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:21,082
Don't be afraid.
Can't do human. Yet.

145
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,044
Yeah!

146
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,039
All right!

147
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:39,556
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Touchdown Tigers.

148
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,956
And the score
is now 41-38.

149
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,038
Tigers lead
with 2:46 remaining...

150
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,197
here at the Buenos Aires
Sports Arena.

151
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:47,640
Time out Giants.

152
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:51,197
- Are you all right?
- Much better.

153
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:52,606
- Now.
- Good.
- Yeah!

154
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:55,155
All right!
Way to go, team!

155
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:56,919
Hey! Your helmet.

156
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,445
So, what are you doing
after the game?

157
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:05,006
Well, everyone's going
to the dance, aren't you?

158
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,555
I don't know. It's my
last night as a civilian.

159
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:10,115
- Come on, number 12! Let's go!
- Ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

160
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:13,756
- You're going to the Fleet Academy?
- Uh-huh.

161
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,166
That's where
I want to go!

162
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,761
Come on, number 12!
Let's play ball!

163
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:19,485
Don't get any ideas
about my girlfriend!

164
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,080
All is fair
in love and war.

165
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,239
- Giants! Giants!
-Johnny! Yeah!

166
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:30,521
Hut! Hut!

167
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:43,845
Hey, yeah!

168
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:47,522
Giants leading 43-4 1.
Just over 42 seconds remaining.

169
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:52,435
- Yeah!
- All right, let's go.

170
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,358
Irvin, Lathom,
cover the rush.

171
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,325
Perry, fake left.
Bertolli, you go long.

172
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,605
Rico, flip six three hole.
Got it? Hey, Rico?

173
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:03,962
- Hey!
- What?

174
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:07,483
You're drifting! Flip six,
three hole, on one! Got it?

175
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,718
-Just throw me the ball, Diz.
- Ready? Break!

176
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:12,035
Break!

177
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:16,603
Down. Set.
Tight left.

178
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,598
- Screen!
- Hut!

179
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:32,919
Yeah! Go, go, go!

180
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,844
All right!

181
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:42,037
Yeah!

182
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:44,482
He's in there.
It's over.

183
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,162
Who said you could
grow up so fast, huh?

184
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,203
Mom, don't get mushy.

185
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:07,998
This came for you today.

186
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,884
I presume,
at your request.

187
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,523
A lot of my friends are
doing Federal Service.

188
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:17,962
Well, you're not
thinking of applying?

189
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,003
Have you lost your mind?

190
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:23,159
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public
Square than see you ruin your life.

191
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:25,397
It's a term of service.

192
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,318
It's not a career.

193
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,443
I just want to get
out on my own...

194
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:33,236
see the galaxy
for a couple years.

195
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:35,636
Johnny, people get killed
in the Federal Service.

196
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:39,276
Who gave you this idea?
It's that teacher, isn't it?

197
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:42,165
What's his name? You know
the one I'm talking about.

198
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:46,205
- Mr Rasczak.
- Rasczak?

199
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:50,357
Silly name. There should
be a law against...

200
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,517
using a school
as a recruiting station.

201
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,805
No, Rasczak doesn't do that
at all.

202
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:58,878
He sort of discourages you.

203
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,685
Well, that's good.

204
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:03,679
'Cause you're going to Harvard,
and that's the end of it.

205
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,156
It's my decision,
not yours.

206
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:08,761
- Oh, is that how it is, huh?
- Wait, you two.

207
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:12,157
Uh, Dad and I have a surprise
for you that will settle this.

208
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:14,602
Can you guess what it is?

209
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:15,961
No.

210
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,725
You wanted to see the galaxy?

211
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,845
How about a trip
to the Outer Rings?

212
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,725
Zegema Beach. Huh?

213
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,680
I've always wanted
to go there.

214
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,201
Good, good.
Then it's all settled.

215
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,757
Sure. Don't go away.

216
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,644
I'm just gonna
go see Mr Rasczak.

217
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,603
Hey, Rico, do you
want to dance?

218
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,200
Actually, Diz,
I promised Carmen--

219
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,164
Aw, come on. Too bad for her
if she's not around.

220
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:06,406
You know, it's sad.
After tonight, most of us...

221
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:08,284
probably won't
see each other again.

222
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,723
So, you still
gonna play for Rio?

223
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,042
Yeah, looks like.
Unless Tokyo lets me start.

224
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,277
Well, anyone
who gets you is lucky.

225
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:24,167
Johnny, how come
we never got together?

226
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,884
Can't we just
be friends, Diz?

227
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:33,806
Sure.

228
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,198
- Thank you.
- Good night.

229
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:42,836
Look, Diz, I want to talk
to Mr Rasczak.

230
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,476
Well, you better hurry up
if you want to catch him.

231
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:48,841
You're the best.

232
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:03,000
Mr Rasczak!

233
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,920
- What is it, Rico?
- I want to thank you.

234
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:08,475
Your class was the best one
I had this year.

235
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:11,035
Well, it's really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.

236
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,799
Well, I want to join up.

237
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,718
I think I got what it takes
to be a citizen.

238
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:17,082
Good for you.
Go find out.

239
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,998
Well, my parents
are against it.

240
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,600
And I know it's my choice.

241
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,405
I was wondering...

242
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:23,715
what would you do
if you were me?

243
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,075
Figuring things out
for yourself...

244
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,317
is the only freedom
anyone really has.

245
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:29,760
Use that freedom.

246
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,963
Make up your own mind, Rico.

247
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,155
But I have not been
to paradise

248
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:47,081
No, I have not been
to paradise

249
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:50,840
Watch the days go by

250
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,758
All is fine

251
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:54,360
Don't exaggerate.

252
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:57,325
I'm serious. I think you have
really beautiful eyes.

253
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:59,159
- You know?
- Johnny.

254
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:03,797
Uh, this is Zander.

255
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,526
Yeah, we know each other
from the game.

256
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:11,317
- No hard feelings?
- No, none at all. We won.

257
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:15,002
Come on, Carmen.
It's the last dance.

258
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,998
Well, maybe I'll see you
at the Academy.

259
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,361
Yeah. Who knows?

260
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:24,839
- Good luck.
- Zander's going for pilot too.

261
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,596
You two have
so much in common.

262
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,645
Johnny Rico,
are you jealous?

263
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:34,287
Well, maybe.

264
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,437
You don't have
to be jealous.

265
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:42,120
Hey, hey,
break it up, you two.

266
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:44,596
There's a place
for that sort of thing.

267
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:51,082
I've been thinking,
and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.

268
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,964
I'm gonna go
for Federal Service.

269
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,242
That's great.

270
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:58,125
Carl and I are signing up
tomorrow. Come with us.

271
00:16:58,207 --> 00:16:59,481
I will.

272
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:08,124
My father's
not home tonight.

273
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,839
All is well

274
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:17,402
All is well

275
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:20,757
Talk about it

276
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:23,236
Watch the days go by

277
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:25,477
All is well

278
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,637
24th century dies

279
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:31,163
I do now,
of my own free will...

280
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:34,523
after having been
duly advised and warned...

281
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:37,724
of the meaning and consequences
of this oath...

282
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,957
enrol in the Federal Service...

283
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:42,197
for not less than two years...

284
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:45,245
and as much longer
as may be required...

285
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:47,397
by the needs
of the Federation.

286
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,443
- All set?
- Thank you.

287
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,126
Fresh meat
for the grinder, eh?

288
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,202
- So, how'd you kids do?
- I'm gonna be a pilot.

289
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:06,166
Well, good for you. We need
all the pilots we can get.

290
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,560
- Hey, did you get starside R and D?
- No.

291
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:14,003
- I don't believe it.
- I got Games and Theory.

292
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,043
Games and Theory?

293
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:18,561
- That's military intelligence.
- Yeah.

294
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,842
Way to go, Carl.

295
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:23,521
Next time we meet,
I'll probably have to salute you.

296
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,006
Hmm.

297
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:28,158
How about you, son?

298
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:31,045
- Infantry, sir.
- Good for you.

299
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,595
Mobile Infantry made me
the man I am today.

300
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:38,722
All recruits must report to the
Federal Transportation Hub...

301
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:40,365
within 24 hours.

302
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:42,961
Welcome to the adventure
of Federal Service.

303
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:45,242
Let's make a vow.

304
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:48,637
No matter what,
we'll always be friends.

305
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:51,402
I'll go for that.

306
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,277
Well, chances are we'll
never see each other again.

307
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:59,925
We'll be millions of light-years
away from each other.

308
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,396
But, uh, yeah, sure.
Why not?

309
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,678
You'll resign, and that's
all there is to it.

310
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,520
It may look bad, but if that's
the worst you suffer, then that's fine.

311
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,405
- I won't quit!
- I'm telling you, you will.

312
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:14,478
You're not going back.
You're going on vacation!

313
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,398
I am not going
on vacation!

314
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:18,205
I want to be a citizen.

315
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,686
It's my decision.
I made it.

316
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,598
You walk out that door,
you are cut off, young man.

317
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,200
You understand me?

318
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,596
All right, that's it!
You are cut off!

319
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:27,518
Johnny, why won't you
change your mind?

320
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,643
Does citizenship
mean that much to you?

321
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:32,523
Well, yeah, sure.

322
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:34,438
Well, I hope so.

323
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,961
I hope you don't ruin your life
over some silly little girl...

324
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:38,924
who wants to look handsome
in a uniform.

325
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,237
- Don't talk about Carmen that way!
- Johnny.

326
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,124
Your attention, please.

327
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:47,359
Outbound group 1380,
all hub 29 connections.

328
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:49,039
- Do you have everything?
- Moscow now boarding...

329
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:50,924
- Great.
- at bank 8-A.

330
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:59,478
- Johnny.
- Be a good girl, hear?

331
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:02,161
- You're late.
- My dad had to help me pack.

332
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:04,886
Suddenly he's afraid he's never
gonna see me again or something.

333
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:07,356
It was sweet,
but it took forever.

334
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:11,998
Oh. Anyway, I guess
I'm ready to go.

335
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,965
Yeah, me too. I'm wearing
everything I own.

336
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,518
I'm sorry your parents
were mad.

337
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,882
Who cares? The Federation
will give me...

338
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,162
everything I need for
the next two years, right?

339
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,276
- You talk to Carl?
- Yeah, he left this morning.

340
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:33,042
- Couldn't say where.
- Oh, it's exciting, going away.

341
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:35,800
But I'm scared.
Aren't you?

342
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,398
I'm gonna miss you.

343
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,917
I'm gonna miss you too.

344
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:48,798
I love you.

345
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:51,845
Outbound group 94B
to Tereshkova--

346
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:53,599
That's me.

347
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,675
Just say it once.
Try it on for size.

348
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:04,526
I love you.

349
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,803
Don't forget to write.

350
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:16,206
I won't.

351
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:33,355
Fully automatic Morita.
Who wants to hold it?

352
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:34,641
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

353
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:38,845
Citizen rule. People
making a better tomorrow.

354
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,719
A murderer was captured
this morning and tried today.

355
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,638
Guilty.

356
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:54,519
Sentence: death.

357
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:57,679
Execution tonight at 6:00.
All net. All channels.

358
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:08,285
If you think you're psychic,

359
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:09,516
maybe you are.

360
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:14,639
Federal studies are being
conducted in your community.

361
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:21,721
Every school kid knows
that Arachnids are dangerous.

362
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,965
However, Mormon extremists
disregarded Federal warnings...

363
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:34,120
and established Fort Joe Smith deep
inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

364
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:38,200
Too late, they realized that Dantana had
already been chosen by other colonists:

365
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:40,118
Arachnids.

366
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:47,795
- One, two, three, four!
- Ten-hut!

367
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:50,765
- One, two, three, four!
- Most of you will not...

368
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:53,441
live to be
in the Mobile Infantry.

369
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:56,087
The trouble is, you are not
good enough the way you are.

370
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,203
Hands at your side!

371
00:22:58,287 --> 00:22:59,606
Chin up.

372
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:02,360
I am your senior drill instructor,
Career Sergeant Zim!

373
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,166
Suck in that gut!
Feet together!

374
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,117
To think this had
to happen to me.

375
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,516
What a bunch of apes.
No, strike that!

376
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:13,835
You don't rate that good.

377
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:15,883
Never in my life
have I seen--

378
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:20,643
Do you think I'm funny?
Do I make you laugh?

379
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:23,287
- Do you think I'm a comedian, son?
- I'm sorry.

380
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:27,326
The first words and the last words out
of your stinking holes will be "Sir"!

381
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,443
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

382
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:31,882
You see that armoury?
Run around it.

383
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,197
Run, I said!
Run, run, run!

384
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,198
- Bronski, keep pace!
- Move! Move!

385
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:38,676
Now, anytime you think
I'm being too tough...

386
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,564
anytime you think
I'm being unfair...

387
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:44,003
anytime you miss
your mommy, quit!

388
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:46,396
You sign form 1240-A,
you grab your gear...

389
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:48,921
you take a stroll
down Washout Lane!

390
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,679
Do you get me?

391
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:52,917
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Pathetic!

392
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:57,080
I wonder if there's a handful of
guts in the whole bunch of you.

393
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:02,002
Now, who here thinks they got
what it takes to knock me down?

394
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,760
Sir! I guess
maybe I do, sir!

395
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:17,358
Ow! God! God!

396
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,483
- You all right, son?
- Sir, yes, sir!

397
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:24,718
It's my arm.
I think it's broken, sir.

398
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:27,560
- Medic!
- God.

399
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:30,445
Pain is in your mind!

400
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:32,358
- Who's next?
- Sir!

401
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:35,166
Recruit Flores reporting
for duty, sir!

402
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:47,643
You specifically requested transfer from
Fort Cronkite to this training unit?

403
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:49,365
Sir, I heard
it was the best, sir!

404
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,439
It is the best.

405
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:55,325
But what makes you think
you're good enough?

406
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,923
Now that's the kind of gal
who makes squad leader.

407
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:06,157
That's my job
you're talking about.

408
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:09,075
Come on.

409
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,361
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

410
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:11,641
- Roughnecks!
- Roughnecks!

411
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,001
- On the go!
- On the go!

412
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:25,885
One, two, three, four...

413
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:29,084
one, two, MI!

414
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:33,925
You know, I'd like
to kill that Sergeant Zim.

415
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:36,396
- Whoa, improper attitude!
- Watch it.

416
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:38,523
- They'll kick you out
for talking like that.
- Bye-bye.

417
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:40,598
There you go
down Washout Lane.

418
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:42,996
Yup, you either got what
it takes, or you don't.

419
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:45,203
- Hey, there is a line.
- Wait your turn, Ace.

420
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:48,802
Hey, at ease, little soldier.
It's all the same muck.

421
00:25:48,887 --> 00:25:50,400
Get in line
like everyone else.

422
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:02,880
You got some guts
for a rich kid.

423
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:05,356
I guess you and me could be
buddies. What do you say?

424
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:06,846
Oh-oh, that is
no way to act.

425
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:09,964
- I'm honoured.
- Hey! Of course you are.

426
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:12,083
Everybody should have
a friend like me.

427
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:14,317
Come on, Ace. Back of the line
now! Back of the line!

428
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,635
- Back, back, back, back!
- All right. Hurry up, hurry up.

429
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:17,240
- What a jerk, man.
- Tough guy.

430
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:21,164
Hey, Rico, want
to sit together?

431
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,566
No thanks, Diz.

432
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:26,638
What's your malfunction, Rico?

433
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:29,884
You are.

434
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,606
I joined up to get out on my own,
and you had to tag along.

435
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,922
You think I joined the Mobile
Infantry because of you?

436
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:38,838
You saying you didn't?

437
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,201
Hi.

438
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:48,755
Forget about it, Ace.
You don't stand a chance.

439
00:26:48,847 --> 00:26:51,600
What makes you even think you're
gonna make squad leader, Rico?

440
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:53,279
- Something I got, you don't.
- Ha!

441
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:56,040
-You rich kids are all the same.
-It isn't about that.

442
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:58,163
- It's about who's the best.
- Hey!

443
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,480
Third squad!

444
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:12,922
If someone's hurt, put him on your back
and take him out of there!

445
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,122
Let's go!

446
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:16,919
Go, Simmons!
Go, go, you sissy!

447
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:19,840
Sir, I don't understand.

448
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:22,077
Who needs a knife
in a nuke fight, anyway?

449
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:25,682
All you gotta do
is push a button, sir.

450
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:29,999
Cease fire. Put your hand
on that wall, trooper.

451
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,357
Put your hand on that wall!

452
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:46,046
Damn it.

453
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:54,846
The enemy cannot push a button
if you disable his hand.

454
00:27:58,487 --> 00:27:59,636
Medic!

455
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:02,279
Hand me that towel, will you?

456
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:04,756
Ah, well, we all have
one thing in common.

457
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:07,645
We were all stupid enough
to sign up for Mobile Infantry.

458
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,685
- Breckinridge, what's your excuse?
- Oh, my family's all farmers.

459
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,598
I hate farming. I mean,
uh, Mobile Infantry-

460
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:14,518
It's like pure picnic
by comparison.

461
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:17,883
All right, so they grow'em big and dumb
on the farm planet, huh?

462
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:20,242
- And pretty!
- I like big!

463
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:23,160
- Djana'D, what about you?
- Oh, I'm going in for politics...

464
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:25,238
and, you know, you gotta be
a citizen for that.

465
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:28,285
- So here I am.
- Ah, you want some responsibility.

466
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:31,484
- Yeah.
- Shujimi, come on, let's keep it goin'.

467
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,876
I got into Harvard,
but my father says forget it.

468
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,161
It's gonna cost an arm
and a leg, you know?

469
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,885
So, if I serve,

470
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,481
Federation pays my way.

471
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:40,920
I want to have babies.

472
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:43,202
You know, it's a lot easier to
get a licence if you've served.

473
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:44,925
- So-
- I'm going career.

474
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:47,601
- Officer's training. All the way.
- Ah!

475
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,882
Future Sky Marshal.
All right, Rico, your turn.

476
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:53,720
Who asked you to be so nosy?

477
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:55,798
What? I'm the-the bad guy?
I'm gonna be a writer, you know?

478
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:58,526
A writer's got
a right to be nosy.

479
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:01,280
Hey, Flores, you know
Rico from Buenos Aires.

480
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:05,406
- What's his story?
- Oh, uh,

481
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:07,398
he's here
because of a girl.

482
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:11,597
Oh, Rico! Lover boy!

483
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:15,805
- He's getting me excited.
- He's gonna blow.

484
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:20,322
Is it you?

485
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:28,758
This is where we live.
It's not much, but it's home.

486
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:32,362
Right there, that's my bunk,
where I dream about you every night.

487
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:35,320
Boot's pretty tough.

488
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,921
Sometimes I think I won't make it.

489
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:40,202
But then I think about what
you're doing, and I try harder.

490
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:46,199
- Hey, guys! Do you mind?
- Try harder, baby, try harder!

491
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:54,366
Who knows? They might even
make me squad leader.

492
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,119
Uh-oh,
I better pack it in.

493
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:59,643
Oh, I love you, baby,
I love you!

494
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:03,242
- Write me!
- I love you so much.

495
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:05,921
- I'm gonna kill you guys!
- I love you so much.

496
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:09,841
- Bye! Write me.
- Bye!

497
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:13,638
Orbit in five, banez.

498
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:15,479
First one there
gets to fly.

499
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,597
- Locking it down.
- Wait! Wait!

500
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,240
Oh, no. Not Ibanez again.
She's crazy!

501
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:39,283
Ready, go!

502
00:30:45,607 --> 00:30:46,881
Yeah!

503
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,080
Deploying wings.

504
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,676
How come you're
in such a good mood, huh?

505
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,519
'Cause today
I get to fly that.

506
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:01,316
Pilot Trainee Ibanez
reporting for duty, ma'am.

507
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:03,159
Take the number two chair,
Ibanez.

508
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:05,397
- Yes, ma'am.
- You see that?

509
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:13,601
- Identify.
- Ibanez, T-325-A, clear.

510
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:21,405
What are you doing here?

511
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:24,240
I'm the guy whose gonna
teach you to fly this crate.

512
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, Assistant Instructor.

513
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,436
Should I call you "sir"?

514
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:33,360
- Only when I give you an order.
- Prepare for departure.

515
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:38,243
It's amazing, us running
into each other like this.

516
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:40,966
- Maybe it's fate.
- Maybe not.

517
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:44,084
Heard about this crazy girl
coming through the Academy.

518
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:48,604
Solid math, a little wild
on the stick, but a natural.

519
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:50,086
And when it turned out
to be you,

520
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,283
I just made sure that we
would run into each other.

521
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:54,961
Rodger Young cleared for
undocking and departure.

522
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:56,799
All right, Ibanez.

523
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:59,117
- Take her out.
- Yes, ma'am.

524
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,198
All systems go.

525
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,603
In simulation, my supervisors
could never keep up.

526
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:30,405
Well, this isn't simulation any more...

527
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,001
so take her out easy, cadet.

528
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:34,315
Yes, sir.

529
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:44,486
Five metres from object.

530
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,006
Three metres from object.

531
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:54,841
Clear.

532
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:00,560
- Don't exceed port speed.
- Or what?

533
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:05,163
Or they revoke your flight
status, and mine.

534
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:09,122
Your career is
in my hands.

535
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,326
Steady as she goes,
Number Two.

536
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:19,557
- Prepare for warp.
- Yes, ma'am.

537
00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:22,764
Number One, design
for Jupiter orbit.

538
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:26,522
All crew, all sections,
stand by to cut in C-drive.

539
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:30,202
- Star drive in five, four,
- Five, four...

540
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:32,482
- ready...
- three, two...
- steady...

541
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,046
- one-
- go!

542
00:34:57,087 --> 00:34:58,839
We're going in!
Move!

543
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:08,880
Man, they're defended.
No way in.

544
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:13,522
- Flip six, three hole.
- What?

545
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:16,246
You run a flip six, three
hole play, and you can score.

546
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:17,646
- Cover me.
- You got it.

547
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,325
Now!

548
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:36,036
- Thanks, buddy.
- Bastard!

549
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:46,126
Yeah!

550
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,483
Kid's got some moves.

551
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,364
Give him a squad.
See what he can do.

552
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,885
Kitty, Kitty.

553
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:04,356
Someone's got to teach you guys
how to play some pool here.

554
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:06,920
Look at him.

555
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:09,646
Have you ever seen anybody
so pleased with himself?

556
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:13,242
Well, Zim must have had to choose
someone to be his brownnose.

557
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:15,561
All right, where were we?

558
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:17,478
Okay, watch and learn.
Watch and learn.

559
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:20,879
I couldn't have done it
without you, Diz.

560
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:23,961
Friends?

561
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:28,046
Friends.

562
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:31,715
- Mail call! Levy!
- Yeah, that's me.

563
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:34,275
- Shujimi!
- Here.

564
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:35,720
- Rico.
- Here.

565
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,763
- Breckinridge!
- Yeah, right here.

566
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:40,839
- Niler.
- Yeah, here I am. Ah, great, my dad.

567
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:42,804
That's all, folks.

568
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,406
Hi, Johnny.

569
00:36:51,487 --> 00:36:53,955
I'm sorry I haven't
written you sooner, but, uh...

570
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,515
- Oh, Rico,
- it's been really busy.
- you don't deserve that!

571
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:58,484
- Shh, shh.
- They've really got us
going here.

572
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:01,001
They must have made you
squad leader by now.

573
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:03,396
And if they haven't,
tell 'em to talk to me.

574
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,637
See? All it takes is
the love of a good woman.

575
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:08,036
- Yeah.
- That is a woman.
- Beautiful.

576
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:10,766
- Look at that.
- Look at those.
- Stop it.

577
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:12,678
- Isn't it beautiful?
- I'm dying.

578
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,803
I love it out here.

579
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:19,441
- That's also the problem.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

580
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:23,566
Because I think
I'm gonna go career.

581
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:27,122
I want to command
a ship of my own.

582
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:29,004
And you know...

583
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:32,040
I don't think that's gonna
leave a lot of room...

584
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:34,118
for you and me, Johnny.

585
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:37,363
- Oh, God.
- Jeez.

586
00:37:37,447 --> 00:37:40,837
I know that's not
what you wanted to hear.

587
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:42,121
But, uh...

588
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:48,439
I have to follow my heart.
I'm sorry.

589
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:53,319
Write me, all right?

590
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:55,875
Write me so that I know
we'll always be friends.

591
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:13,484
- Let's get back to the game.
- I feel so sorry for Johnny.

592
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:14,841
Funny how they always
want to be friends...

593
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:17,646
after they rip your guts
out, huh?

594
00:38:17,727 --> 00:38:20,400
Yeah. Well,
it's what I deserve.

595
00:38:21,847 --> 00:38:23,678
What are you
talking about?

596
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:27,244
Oh, I joined up for her.

597
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,717
I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for her.

598
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:33,480
What are you talking about? You
made squad leader on your own.

599
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,635
And, hey, you still got me
to kick around.

600
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,520
Fun and games are over,
children.

601
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:46,563
You will be firing
live ammunition...

602
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:48,797
in a simulated combat
environment.

603
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:53,085
You will exercise extreme
caution on my assault course!

604
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:55,806
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

605
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:57,639
Rico, take 'em out!

606
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:02,084
First fire team with me.
Next team in ten seconds.

607
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:04,886
Maximum score has been 280.

608
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,721
- I expect you to do better!
- Go!

609
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,279
Shujimi, stay down!

610
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:30,198
Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge,
clear my line of fire!

611
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:32,164
It's my helmet!
It's all screwed up!

612
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:33,919
You're gonna
blow the score!

613
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:35,486
- Damn!
- Dumb shit!

614
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:36,920
Diz, stay put!
What's the problem?

615
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,725
- Damn thing keeps getting in my way!
- Give it to me.

616
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:41,002
How come whenever something goes wrong,
it's always you, Breckinridge?

617
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,440
It must be 'cause
I'm big and dumb!

618
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:44,085
Yeah, right!

619
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,684
Medic!

620
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:57,837
Rico, you are relieved
of squad command!

621
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:02,685
Rico, did you give the recruit
permission to remove his helmet?

622
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,520
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge
reported a helmet malfunction...

623
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:07,165
and I asked him
to show it to me, sir.

624
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:10,842
Are you rated to repair
the M-3 Tactical Helmet, Rico?

625
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:13,886
Sir, no, sir!

626
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:15,798
Then why did you order your man
to remove his helmet...

627
00:40:15,887 --> 00:40:18,355
during a live fire
exercise?

628
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:21,519
Sir, I needed everyone in
my squad operational, sir!

629
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:25,282
I wanted to win, sir!

630
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:32,286
Carry on.

631
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:43,844
Sergeant, we've already lost
two recruits over this incident.

632
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:46,885
Do you think there's any possibility
of salvaging this man?

633
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:49,921
Yes, sir, I do.

634
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,481
All right.

635
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:55,719
We'll try administrative punishment.

636
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:03,124
Prisoner, halt!

637
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:22,078
Bite down on this, son.

638
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,601
It helps.
I know.

639
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:37,439
For incompetence of command...

640
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:40,041
for failure to abide
by safety regulations...

641
00:41:40,127 --> 00:41:43,403
during a live fire exercise...

642
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:47,002
for negligence which contributed
to the death of a teammate...

643
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,237
recruit trainee
John Rico...

644
00:41:49,327 --> 00:41:51,318
is sentenced to
administrative punishment.

645
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,042
Ten lashes.

646
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,798
You may carry out
the sentence.

647
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:06,763
One!

648
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:10,203
Two!

649
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:13,246
Three!

650
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,998
Four!

651
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:20,485
Five!

652
00:42:22,927 --> 00:42:23,996
Six!

653
00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:26,956
Seven!

654
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:31,155
Eight!

655
00:42:31,247 --> 00:42:32,521
Nine!

656
00:42:34,127 --> 00:42:35,446
Ten!

657
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:50,199
All sections secure.
EBS is high normal.

658
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:53,085
Switching to slave on my mark.
Mark.

659
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:58,644
Thanks.
You read my mind.

660
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:03,399
Oh, third watch always
seems to last forever.

661
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:05,079
I don't know.

662
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,522
It depends on who
you're spending it with.

663
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,959
Something's wrong.

664
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:20,081
- There.
- No, I replotted the course.

665
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:23,204
- It's more efficient this way.
- Three weeks aboard a starship...

666
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:25,437
and you think that you
can lick my navs?

667
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:26,721
Check it.

668
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:34,645
You know, I was talking
with Captain Deladier...

669
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:36,126
and, uh, she said--

670
00:43:36,207 --> 00:43:38,675
Don't change the subject.

671
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:39,961
Am I right?

672
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:49,965
Yeah. Yeah.
You're right.

673
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:52,277
So, what did
the captain say?

674
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:56,286
She thinks that we ought
to team up officially...

675
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:00,920
and crew for her.

676
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:04,363
- You and me, huh?
- We're good together, Carmen.

677
00:44:04,447 --> 00:44:07,644
We're way ahead of the curve
in every department.

678
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:10,605
I can anticipate you.

679
00:44:10,687 --> 00:44:13,326
You know what I want.

680
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:18,044
No. What do you want?

681
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:27,319
There's a gravity field
out there.

682
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:31,722
- Run a scan. Sensors on.
- There.

683
00:44:34,287 --> 00:44:37,404
- Gravity at 225 and rising.
- Report.

684
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:39,364
Captain, we're in the path
of an unidentified object...

685
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:41,085
moving toward us
at high speed.

686
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:43,362
Profile suggests
an asteroid, ma'am.

687
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:57,721
- Impact, six seconds!
- Emergency evasion!

688
00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:04,916
Three, two,

689
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:09,115
fire!

690
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:25,079
Close compartment 21!

691
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:40,000
Where'd it come from?

692
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,806
It came out of the Arachnid
Quarantine Zone, ma'am.

693
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:47,485
Number Four, contact Fleet.
Tell 'em there's a loose asteroid
headed their way.

694
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:49,603
Communications are down,
ma'am. They're gone.

695
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:54,045
- Damage assessment.
- Hull's compromised.

696
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:55,560
We're lucky
to be alive, ma'am.

697
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:57,444
Luck didn't have anything
to do with it.

698
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:00,479
We have a hell
of a flight team.

699
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:17,522
It really stinks, you going.

700
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:20,326
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry
will just have to get along without me.

701
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:27,086
I don't get it, Rico.
You took your licks.

702
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:28,759
If they didn't want you,
they would have kicked you out.

703
00:46:28,847 --> 00:46:30,166
Hey-

704
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:33,563
I joined up for the wrong reasons.
I got a guy killed.

705
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:35,877
I figure that kind of proves
I don't have what it takes.

706
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:39,357
Rico, your call's going through.

707
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:41,244
Take it there.

708
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:51,205
- Hello? Oh,Johnny!
- Hi, Mom.

709
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:53,243
B-Bill, pick it up.
It's Johnny!

710
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:55,045
- Johnny?
- Dad.

711
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:56,446
- Where's your uniform?
- Bill.

712
00:46:58,207 --> 00:47:00,038
It's just good
to hear from you.

713
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:02,322
How are you, son?

714
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:04,557
It's not really working out
here for me, Dad.

715
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,080
I was thinking-

716
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:07,998
I was hoping it would be
all right if I came home.

717
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:10,999
Well, of-of course. You should
come home immediately.

718
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:14,517
I'm sorry.
I've been an idiot.

719
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:16,802
Don't talk like that.
You just come on home...

720
00:47:16,887 --> 00:47:18,036
talk things out.

721
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:20,841
We love you, son.

722
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:24,755
- My, what's that?
- Looks like rain.

723
00:47:24,847 --> 00:47:27,407
- This time of year?
- Sure is dark.

724
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,125
Your transmission
has been terminated...

725
00:47:29,207 --> 00:47:31,641
due to atmospheric
interference.

726
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:33,126
Please try your call
again later.

727
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:37,481
Sanchez!

728
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:41,080
Well, see ya.

729
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:44,443
Hey, you take that stroll
down Washout Lane...

730
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:46,279
you're only proving
one thing, Johnny.

731
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:47,641
What's that, Diz?

732
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:53,806
That you don't have what
it takes to be a citizen.

733
00:47:57,807 --> 00:47:59,957
Mobile Infantry
is passing by

734
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:01,878
Mobile Infantry
is passing by

735
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:04,117
- Well, sound off
- MI

736
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:06,357
- Sound off
- Passing by

737
00:48:06,447 --> 00:48:09,245
- Count now
- One, two, three, four

738
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:11,636
- That's it! That's it!
- Left. Left.

739
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:14,366
- Left, right, left.
- Do you get me?

740
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:17,564
- Sir, yes, sir!
- I can't hear you!
- What's going on, you guys?

741
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:18,921
Move, move, move!

742
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:22,920
What's happening?

743
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:29,720
Hey, hey, what's going on?

744
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:31,479
Wh-What's going on?

745
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:35,003
- Hey, Kitten, what's going on?
- It's war! We're going to war!

746
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:42,717
The devastation we are seeing
is unparalleled.

747
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:47,483
Judging from early estimates,
millions dead, a city in ruins.

748
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:49,558
Is that Geneva?

749
00:48:49,647 --> 00:48:51,399
Goddam bugs whacked us,
Johnny.

750
00:48:51,487 --> 00:48:54,684
The meteor was shot out
of orbit by bug plasma...

751
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:58,043
that derived from Klendathu,
the Arachnids'home planet.

752
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:09,799
Nothing lives in what was once
called the Latin Paradise.

753
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,161
Oh, Johnny, it's us.

754
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:14,603
Buenos Aires has been
wiped off the Earth.

755
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:20,680
That's home.

756
00:49:23,087 --> 00:49:25,965
The Federal Council met moments
ago and voted unanimously...

757
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:29,722
for mobilization to destroy
the Arachnid threat.

758
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:38,283
- I'm serious. I'll go anywhere.
- Forget it, Zim. We need you here.

759
00:49:38,367 --> 00:49:41,165
-I want combat, sir.
-The only way you're gonna see combat...

760
00:49:41,247 --> 00:49:43,078
is if you bust yourself
to private!

761
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:46,045
- Get me?
- Yes, sir, I get you.

762
00:49:46,127 --> 00:49:49,119
- Sir!
- What do you want, Rico?

763
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:52,119
I wish to reconsider
my request to drop out, sir.

764
00:49:52,207 --> 00:49:54,198
You already signed
your 1240-A, son.

765
00:49:54,287 --> 00:49:57,802
- It wouldn't be legal.
- Major, I know it was wrong.

766
00:49:57,887 --> 00:50:00,526
I didn't learn from one mistake,
and I made another, sir.

767
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:02,438
You made your decision, son.

768
00:50:02,527 --> 00:50:06,964
Sir, my family, my whole family,
was in Buenos Aires, sir.

769
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:12,765
Is this your signature, Rico?

770
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:14,439
Sir, yes, it is, sir!

771
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:21,561
Doesn't look like it to me.

772
00:50:24,207 --> 00:50:27,961
- Carry on, Private!
- Yes, sir!

773
00:50:39,526 --> 00:50:44,361
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires
comes first sorrow...

774
00:50:44,446 --> 00:50:46,004
then anger.

775
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:48,919
The only good bug
is a dead bug.

776
00:50:49,006 --> 00:50:51,964
In Geneva,
the Federal Council convenes.

777
00:50:52,046 --> 00:50:55,595
We must meet the threat
with our valour, our blood...

778
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,802
indeed, with our very lives...

779
00:50:57,886 --> 00:51:02,277
to ensure that human civilization,
not insect...

780
00:51:02,366 --> 00:51:06,075
dominates this galaxy,
now and always!

781
00:51:07,326 --> 00:51:08,839
Sky Marshal Dienes
announces plans...

782
00:51:08,926 --> 00:51:10,803
for an offensive
against Klendathu...

783
00:51:10,886 --> 00:51:14,117
source of the bug meteor
that destroyed Buenos Aires.

784
00:51:16,646 --> 00:51:20,878
Every day, Federal scientists
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.

785
00:51:20,966 --> 00:51:23,241
Your basic Arachnid warrior
isn't too smart...

786
00:51:23,326 --> 00:51:24,600
but you can
blow off a limb...

787
00:51:27,326 --> 00:51:29,794
and it's still 86 percent
combat effective.

788
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:33,481
Here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem,
and put it down for good.

789
00:51:39,966 --> 00:51:42,958
Everyone's doing their part. Are you?

790
00:51:44,966 --> 00:51:47,400
- Die! Die!
- The war effort needs your effort...

791
00:51:47,486 --> 00:51:49,681
at work, at home,
in your community.

792
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:55,084
We now break net and take you live...

793
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:57,361
to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga...

794
00:51:57,446 --> 00:51:59,880
deep inside
the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...

795
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:04,357
where the men and women of the Federal
Armed Services prepare to attack.

796
00:52:04,446 --> 00:52:08,200
DXQ uplink on two, one.
You're on.

797
00:52:08,286 --> 00:52:10,436
No one here in the AQZ
knows exactly...

798
00:52:10,526 --> 00:52:12,676
when the invasion
of Klendathu will occur.

799
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:14,438
But everyone's
talking about it...

800
00:52:14,526 --> 00:52:16,357
and the talk says tomorrow.

801
00:52:16,446 --> 00:52:19,244
Here's a bunch of MI kids that look
like they could eat bugs for lunch.

802
00:52:19,326 --> 00:52:21,157
- Yum, yum, yum.
- So, trooper,

803
00:52:21,246 --> 00:52:22,918
you're not too worried
about fighting the Arachnids?

804
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,566
Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole,
you got a lot of dead bugs.

805
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:28,604
- Am I right?
- I just hope it's not over
before we get some.

806
00:52:28,686 --> 00:52:30,438
- Okay, come on.
- Some say the bugs were provoked...

807
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:33,086
by the intrusion of humans
into their natural habitat...

808
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:37,000
that a "live and let live policy"
is preferable to war with the bugs.

809
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:38,439
Let me tell you something.

810
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:40,517
I'm from Buenos Aires,
and I say kill them all!

811
00:52:40,606 --> 00:52:41,880
- Yeah!
- Go on, trooper!
- Yeah!

812
00:52:41,966 --> 00:52:43,319
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

813
00:52:43,406 --> 00:52:45,237
Big bad bugs, huh?

814
00:52:45,326 --> 00:52:47,317
Hey, guys,
we ought to get tattoos.

815
00:52:47,406 --> 00:52:48,680
- Hey, let's all get cut together.
- Yeah.

816
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,040
- What do I want a tattoo for?
- Oh, what?

817
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:51,639
Your skin's too pretty?
Come on, everybody's doing it.

818
00:52:51,726 --> 00:52:53,000
Hey, Johnny!

819
00:52:55,246 --> 00:52:56,520
Johnny Rico.

820
00:52:58,766 --> 00:53:00,040
Carmen?

821
00:53:02,886 --> 00:53:05,081
Oh. At ease.

822
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:08,078
Guess I ought to lose the hat
when I'm off duty.

823
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:12,239
- Hi, Diz.
- Carmen.

824
00:53:14,406 --> 00:53:16,920
My mother was right about you.

825
00:53:17,006 --> 00:53:18,758
You look great in a uniform.

826
00:53:18,846 --> 00:53:20,677
You look pretty good yourself.

827
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:24,317
So, what do you hear?

828
00:53:24,406 --> 00:53:27,239
You know about anyone
who made it out of BA alive?

829
00:53:27,326 --> 00:53:29,794
Most of the time
I don't think about it.

830
00:53:29,886 --> 00:53:31,444
Like it happened
to someone else.

831
00:53:31,526 --> 00:53:35,565
Then it hits me,
and I, uh, can't stop crying.

832
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:39,241
Well, we're still alive.
Got to be happy about that.

833
00:53:39,326 --> 00:53:42,477
You don't look
very happy to see me.

834
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:44,841
Should I be?

835
00:53:44,926 --> 00:53:49,477
Johnny, it's different now.
We're at war.

836
00:53:49,566 --> 00:53:53,479
I mean, I think what I did was
probably the best thing for both of us.

837
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:55,636
Everything copacetic,
Lieutenant?

838
00:53:56,606 --> 00:53:58,915
Zander, you remember Johnny.

839
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:01,156
Zander and I
are a flight team now.

840
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:02,918
Yeah, and we're best in the fleet.

841
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:05,878
I get it.

842
00:54:05,966 --> 00:54:08,685
This is the part that's
best for both of us.

843
00:54:08,766 --> 00:54:11,234
- Don't do me any more favours.
- Johnny, wait.

844
00:54:11,326 --> 00:54:13,476
No, forget it, Lieutenant.
He's Mobile Infantry.

845
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:15,397
See, when you're
trained to kill...

846
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,795
it just doesn't pay
to be polite.

847
00:54:17,886 --> 00:54:20,036
You got something to say
about the Mobile Infantry?

848
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:22,879
I think you heard me.

849
00:54:22,966 --> 00:54:25,878
You want to make
something of it, Private?

850
00:54:27,606 --> 00:54:29,756
Not with an officer.
No, sir.

851
00:54:29,846 --> 00:54:33,441
- The MI doesn't mind stupid troopers.
- Well, let's disregard rank.

852
00:54:33,526 --> 00:54:35,676
- Zander, please.
- Let it go, Rico.
- Let it go.

853
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:39,076
Everybody hear that?
Rank is not an issue here.

854
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:42,044
- Don't do this.
- Come on. What's he gonna do?

855
00:54:55,406 --> 00:54:57,840
Come on, jarheads!

856
00:54:57,926 --> 00:54:59,678
Let go of me! Come on!
I'm gonna kill you!

857
00:55:01,286 --> 00:55:05,074
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll kill you!

858
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:06,679
- Guys! Guys! Quit it!
- Come on! Come on!

859
00:55:06,766 --> 00:55:08,119
- He's not worth it!
- Come on!
- Come on!

860
00:55:08,206 --> 00:55:09,844
- Let's get-
- Come on!

861
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:13,521
Forget it, Rico! Mobile Infantry
and Fleet don't mix. Come on.

862
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:17,278
Come on, let's go.

863
00:55:19,326 --> 00:55:20,645
Jarheads.

864
00:55:23,006 --> 00:55:25,645
- Mobile Infantry rules!
- Yeah!

865
00:55:25,726 --> 00:55:27,682
Oh, God, that hurts.

866
00:55:27,766 --> 00:55:30,724
Hey, well, I got something that might
hurt just a little bit more, buddy.

867
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:35,562
Oh, yeah! We're gonna fight,
and we're gonna win!

868
00:55:35,646 --> 00:55:37,762
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

869
00:55:52,606 --> 00:55:54,278
This is the captain speaking.

870
00:55:54,366 --> 00:55:56,482
All personnel
prepare for drop.

871
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:58,875
We are at D-minus three
and counting.

872
00:56:09,886 --> 00:56:12,844
We are going in
with first wave.

873
00:56:12,926 --> 00:56:14,962
Means more bugs
for us to kill.

874
00:56:15,046 --> 00:56:16,479
You smash the entire area.

875
00:56:16,566 --> 00:56:18,557
You kill anything that has
more than two legs.

876
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:21,035
- You get me?
- We get you, sir!

877
00:57:07,126 --> 00:57:09,845
-Plasma, ma'am, from the planet.
-Bug batteries.

878
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,645
According to military intelligence,
it'll be random and light.

879
00:57:14,246 --> 00:57:16,714
- Drop status?
- Drop is...

880
00:57:16,806 --> 00:57:18,797
35 percent complete, ma'am.

881
00:57:24,086 --> 00:57:25,439
Steady as she goes,
Number Two.

882
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:41,917
Remember your training,
and you will make it back alive!

883
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:01,844
This isn't random or light.
Someone made a mistake.

884
00:58:01,926 --> 00:58:03,678
That's it.
We're empty, ma'am.

885
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:15,044
Someone made
a big goddam mistake!

886
00:58:21,926 --> 00:58:23,598
Break for high orbit!

887
00:59:00,966 --> 00:59:02,240
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

888
00:59:07,246 --> 00:59:08,759
Johnny!

889
00:59:29,286 --> 00:59:31,959
- Rockets up!
- Rocket crew, move up!

890
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,764
- Nuke 'em! Levy! Rico!
- Heat 'em up!

891
01:00:02,326 --> 01:00:05,045
- Set.
- Fire!

892
01:00:05,766 --> 01:00:06,881
Down!

893
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:13,681
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

894
01:00:16,606 --> 01:00:19,518
First platoon, left flank!

895
01:00:19,606 --> 01:00:23,565
Split up! First and
second squads, follow me.

896
01:00:23,646 --> 01:00:26,319
Two, cover!
One, with me!

897
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,037
Along side! Side to side!

898
01:00:30,686 --> 01:00:31,801
Fire!

899
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,198
Here they come!

900
01:00:54,406 --> 01:00:56,795
- Ace, what are we doing?
- Uh, I don't know.

901
01:01:01,526 --> 01:01:05,883
- I don't know.
- Kill them! Kill them all!

902
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:13,838
Come on!

903
01:01:15,886 --> 01:01:18,684
Come on! Come on!
You want some?

904
01:01:19,566 --> 01:01:21,557
Here's some! Yeah!

905
01:01:21,646 --> 01:01:22,965
Here's some of this!

906
01:01:26,286 --> 01:01:28,277
Oh, my God!

907
01:01:28,366 --> 01:01:30,675
Shujimi!

908
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:32,722
No, no, no!

909
01:01:34,886 --> 01:01:36,558
Help! Help! Help!

910
01:01:38,886 --> 01:01:41,081
No! God!

911
01:01:46,246 --> 01:01:48,282
Let's get out of here!

912
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:52,558
Fall back!

913
01:02:16,006 --> 01:02:18,315
Mayday!

914
01:02:18,406 --> 01:02:20,397
- All units,
- What's going on?
- fall back to retrieval.

915
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,839
- Repeat.
- You got com?
- All units...

916
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:23,598
- fall back to retrieval.
- It's a general retreat!

917
01:02:23,686 --> 01:02:25,677
- Back to the boats!
- Come on!

918
01:02:25,766 --> 01:02:27,040
Come on, let's go!

919
01:02:28,966 --> 01:02:30,479
We've just landed here
on what cap troopers...

920
01:02:30,566 --> 01:02:32,557
are calling Big K...

921
01:02:32,646 --> 01:02:35,035
with the 6th Mobile
Infantry Division.

922
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:38,004
It's an ugly planet,
a bug planet.

923
01:02:38,086 --> 01:02:40,077
A planet hostile
to life as we-

924
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:46,799
Help me!

925
01:02:50,806 --> 01:02:52,080
Squad right!

926
01:03:03,606 --> 01:03:06,245
Come on! Go, go, go!

927
01:03:06,326 --> 01:03:07,918
Get out of here now!

928
01:03:09,446 --> 01:03:11,516
- Watch your step!
- Watch your flank! Watch your flank!

929
01:03:11,606 --> 01:03:13,358
GXR, we're being overrun.

930
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:25,036
Kitten, no!

931
01:03:54,886 --> 01:03:56,239
Oh, God!

932
01:03:56,326 --> 01:04:00,239
Oh, God! Oh! Oh!

933
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:29,918
Crisis for humankind.

934
01:04:30,006 --> 01:04:32,236
Fleet officials admit
they underestimated...

935
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:35,602
the Arachnids'
defensive capability.

936
01:04:35,686 --> 01:04:38,154
Accepting responsibility
for Klendathu...

937
01:04:38,246 --> 01:04:40,714
Sky Marshal Dienes resigns.

938
01:04:40,806 --> 01:04:43,274
His successor,
Sky Marshal Tahat Meru...

939
01:04:43,366 --> 01:04:45,834
outlines her new strategy.

940
01:04:45,926 --> 01:04:47,757
To fight the bug...

941
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:50,155
we must understand the bug.

942
01:04:50,246 --> 01:04:53,238
We can ill afford
another Klendathu.

943
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:57,637
Federal scientists
struggle to explain...

944
01:04:57,726 --> 01:05:00,445
the intelligent military actions
of the Arachnids.

945
01:05:00,526 --> 01:05:02,517
When a colony reaches
a certain size...

946
01:05:02,606 --> 01:05:05,200
300 generations or something,
it gets smarter.

947
01:05:05,286 --> 01:05:06,605
- Insects with intelligence?
- Now, wait-

948
01:05:06,686 --> 01:05:08,358
Have you ever met one?
I can't believe...

949
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,277
- I am hearing this nonsense.
- Would you just wait a moment?

950
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:13,199
- This is the most ridiculous
conversation I have ever had.
- Maybe- Maybe...

951
01:05:13,286 --> 01:05:16,835
there is some kind of bug
that we haven't seen yet:

952
01:05:16,926 --> 01:05:19,235
a leadership caste,
a... hive brain.

953
01:05:19,326 --> 01:05:23,797
Brain Bugs? Frankly, I find the idea
of a bug that thinks offensive!

954
01:05:37,246 --> 01:05:40,761
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young
requesting approach vector.

955
01:05:40,846 --> 01:05:42,598
Affirmative, Rodger Young.

956
01:05:42,686 --> 01:05:45,359
One-zero-zero-niner-five-two.

957
01:05:45,446 --> 01:05:46,561
Welcome back.

958
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:50,040
My God.

959
01:05:51,886 --> 01:05:53,877
How could this happen?

960
01:05:53,966 --> 01:05:56,241
We thought we were smarter
than the bugs.

961
01:06:12,846 --> 01:06:14,643
Give me something, please!

962
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:17,045
It hurts!

963
01:06:22,126 --> 01:06:23,445
Be right with you.

964
01:06:25,806 --> 01:06:27,125
Help me.

965
01:06:33,806 --> 01:06:36,274
It's strange. There's
almost no wounded at all.

966
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:38,322
Bugs don't take prisoners.

967
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:48,365
Oh, no.

968
01:06:49,766 --> 01:06:51,040
Look.

969
01:06:55,366 --> 01:06:57,436
- Carmen-
- See it? Right there.

970
01:07:18,246 --> 01:07:20,885
- There he is.
- Come on, we'll just wake him up.

971
01:07:20,966 --> 01:07:25,198
Hey, Johnny! Hey!

972
01:07:25,286 --> 01:07:28,084
- Hey, Rico!
- Hey, Johnny!

973
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,997
- Hey, Rico!
- Wake up!
- How you doin', fish boy?

974
01:07:30,086 --> 01:07:32,554
Hey, look.
You're dead!

975
01:07:32,646 --> 01:07:34,841
Killed in action!

976
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:38,957
- Three more days.
- Three days.

977
01:07:39,046 --> 01:07:40,957
- And you're out.
- Good as new. See you later.

978
01:07:41,046 --> 01:07:42,320
Bye.

979
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:11,998
So what do you hear
about our new unit?

980
01:08:12,086 --> 01:08:14,395
Roughnecks killed more bugs
than any other outfit on Big K.

981
01:08:14,486 --> 01:08:17,205
Yeah, well, I hear their
lieutenant's a real nutbuster.

982
01:08:20,086 --> 01:08:21,678
Who's top kick?

983
01:08:24,086 --> 01:08:25,678
You want the job, huh?

984
01:08:25,766 --> 01:08:27,040
I wouldn't mind.

985
01:08:27,126 --> 01:08:28,923
I would.

986
01:08:30,326 --> 01:08:31,600
Just doing my part.

987
01:08:31,686 --> 01:08:33,085
Orders.

988
01:08:35,606 --> 01:08:36,959
Yours?

989
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:38,718
Where you been
besides Big K?

990
01:08:38,806 --> 01:08:42,515
- Outer rings, Zegema Beach.
- Zegema Beach?

991
01:08:42,606 --> 01:08:44,881
- I always wanted to go there.
- Good luck.

992
01:08:44,966 --> 01:08:49,835
- It's not there any more.
- So, I hear your lieutenant's
a real nutbuster.

993
01:08:52,806 --> 01:08:55,445
No one talks about
the lieutenant that way.

994
01:08:55,526 --> 01:08:57,881
- He saved my life.
- Mine too.

995
01:08:59,206 --> 01:09:01,003
- Same for me.
- Me too.

996
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:05,524
Well, sounds like
he's quite a guy.

997
01:09:05,606 --> 01:09:07,198
Who do you think
saved your ass?

998
01:09:08,326 --> 01:09:11,636
Stand by.
Attention on deck!

999
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:25,517
This is for you new people.

1000
01:09:25,606 --> 01:09:27,562
I only have one rule:

1001
01:09:27,646 --> 01:09:30,877
Everyone fights.
No one quits.

1002
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:33,844
You don't do your job,
I'll shoot you.

1003
01:09:33,926 --> 01:09:35,120
Do you get me?

1004
01:09:35,206 --> 01:09:37,117
We get you, sir!

1005
01:09:38,766 --> 01:09:41,075
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rasczak's Roughnecks!

1006
01:09:42,286 --> 01:09:44,277
At ease. Listen up.

1007
01:09:44,366 --> 01:09:47,802
We got a new Sky Marshal
and a new battle plan.

1008
01:09:47,886 --> 01:09:50,195
We're gonna clean out the
systems outlying Klendathu...

1009
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,356
one planet at a time.

1010
01:09:52,446 --> 01:09:54,516
Tomorrow
we hit Tango Urilla.

1011
01:09:54,606 --> 01:09:58,838
After Fleet glasses
the planet, MI mops up.

1012
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:00,120
Carry on.

1013
01:10:48,326 --> 01:10:50,794
All right.
Spread out!

1014
01:10:50,886 --> 01:10:54,401
Fire teams! You locate
a bug hole, nuke it.

1015
01:11:01,926 --> 01:11:03,757
Watkins, shake out
Flores and Rico.

1016
01:11:03,846 --> 01:11:06,076
Copy that.
Move out!

1017
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:08,885
First platoon,
we're going for that ridge.

1018
01:11:08,966 --> 01:11:11,764
- Levy, you're with me.
- No, I'm in A Squad.
I'm going with Rico.

1019
01:11:11,846 --> 01:11:13,279
Shut up and follow me!

1020
01:11:50,126 --> 01:11:51,878
Hey, you like that?

1021
01:11:51,966 --> 01:11:53,877
Fungus-sucking sack
of maggot puke!

1022
01:11:53,966 --> 01:11:55,479
It's dead, Watkins!
It's dead!

1023
01:12:00,406 --> 01:12:02,556
Ain't much to look at after
you scrape them off your boot.

1024
01:12:04,046 --> 01:12:06,685
Bug hole. There.

1025
01:12:20,846 --> 01:12:21,961
Nuke 'em, Rico!

1026
01:12:27,726 --> 01:12:29,125
Fire in the hole!

1027
01:12:40,366 --> 01:12:42,675
Watkins, we're under
heavy attack. Position M-4.

1028
01:12:42,766 --> 01:12:44,916
- Get over here!
- Move!

1029
01:12:54,606 --> 01:12:57,484
- You got a bug problem, ma'am?
- Ah, stow it, trooper!

1030
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,157
Tanker!

1031
01:13:20,246 --> 01:13:23,204
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Move!

1032
01:13:31,566 --> 01:13:33,397
Get down!

1033
01:13:41,206 --> 01:13:42,355
Come on!

1034
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:49,877
Stay down, sucker!

1035
01:14:49,966 --> 01:14:51,797
- Gillespie.
- Well done!

1036
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:53,399
Call for retrieval.

1037
01:14:53,486 --> 01:14:56,444
- Medic!
- Nice moves.

1038
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:58,676
Where'd you learn how
to do that, soldier?

1039
01:14:58,766 --> 01:15:01,724
Back in school, sir.
Don't you remember?

1040
01:15:01,806 --> 01:15:05,640
- I was captain of the team.
- Rico?

1041
01:15:05,726 --> 01:15:08,365
- Sir.
- I need a corporal.

1042
01:15:08,446 --> 01:15:11,882
You're it until you're dead
or till I find somebody better.

1043
01:15:12,766 --> 01:15:14,677
Thank you, sir.

1044
01:15:14,766 --> 01:15:17,326
- All right, saddle up! Show's over.
- Way to go, Corporal.

1045
01:15:17,406 --> 01:15:22,526
- Hey, I need a squad leader.
- Oh, no. No, I've been there
and blew it.

1046
01:15:22,606 --> 01:15:23,959
I'm just here to fight.

1047
01:15:25,206 --> 01:15:27,276
What about it, Diz?

1048
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:29,516
First sergeant,
get your gear in section--

1049
01:15:29,606 --> 01:15:31,164
Looks like
I'm your girl, sir.

1050
01:15:35,886 --> 01:15:37,444
- Catch you later.
- All right.

1051
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,003
Listen up!

1052
01:15:45,086 --> 01:15:48,158
I expect the best,
and I give the best!

1053
01:15:51,846 --> 01:15:53,120
Here's the beer!

1054
01:15:57,006 --> 01:15:58,883
Here's the entertainment!

1055
01:16:03,206 --> 01:16:05,117
Have fun!
That's an order!

1056
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:07,679
This one's for me!

1057
01:16:09,046 --> 01:16:10,559
Thank you, Lieutenant!

1058
01:16:14,126 --> 01:16:15,400
Rico!

1059
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:18,797
You kill bugs good.

1060
01:16:18,886 --> 01:16:20,160
Thanks.

1061
01:16:21,926 --> 01:16:24,156
You knew the lieutenant
before the war.

1062
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,077
What was he like?

1063
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:29,124
He was a teacher.
Kind of like he knew it all.

1064
01:16:29,206 --> 01:16:31,197
He always had
this little smile.

1065
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:34,562
Yeah, well, he don't
smile much any more.

1066
01:16:34,646 --> 01:16:38,241
Yeah, well, I guess your bottle fills up
real quick when your kids get smeared.

1067
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:40,681
- Come on, Corporal.
- Ah, nah, I don't do that any more.

1068
01:16:40,766 --> 01:16:43,155
I remember when you used to dance.
Come on.

1069
01:16:43,246 --> 01:16:44,599
Do I have to pull rank?

1070
01:16:47,286 --> 01:16:48,765
Excuse me, sir.

1071
01:16:57,206 --> 01:17:02,075
Rico. You once asked me
for advice. Want some now?

1072
01:17:02,166 --> 01:17:04,760
- Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant, HQ is on the com.

1073
01:17:07,126 --> 01:17:09,082
Never pass up a good thing.

1074
01:17:17,686 --> 01:17:20,200
Watkins. Beer?

1075
01:17:31,886 --> 01:17:33,160
Ace.

1076
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:44,274
So, Rico, what are you
doing after the dance?

1077
01:18:29,966 --> 01:18:31,285
What's so funny?

1078
01:18:32,766 --> 01:18:34,836
You know, just the way
things work out.

1079
01:18:51,646 --> 01:18:54,035
We finally
got together, Diz.

1080
01:18:57,086 --> 01:18:58,519
I love you, Johnny.

1081
01:19:08,686 --> 01:19:09,880
Rico!

1082
01:19:12,526 --> 01:19:15,245
We're moving out.
There's been a distress call
from General Owen on Planet P.

1083
01:19:15,326 --> 01:19:17,396
So get your shit wired
and report in ten minutes.

1084
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:18,839
Yes, sir.

1085
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:20,359
Who's that with you?

1086
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:25,797
Flores, sir.

1087
01:19:26,926 --> 01:19:28,917
Make it 20 minutes.

1088
01:19:29,006 --> 01:19:30,121
Yes, sir.

1089
01:19:31,326 --> 01:19:32,600
Twenty minutes?

1090
01:19:33,726 --> 01:19:35,000
We can do it.

1091
01:20:11,806 --> 01:20:13,398
Whiskey Outpost,
do you copy?

1092
01:20:13,486 --> 01:20:16,398
This is Roughneck 2-0
on tac three. Come in, please.

1093
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:18,999
Whiskey Outpost,
Whiskey Outpost,

1094
01:20:19,086 --> 01:20:21,236
this is Roughneck 2-0
on tac three.

1095
01:20:21,326 --> 01:20:23,476
- Any contact with General Owen?
- No, sir.

1096
01:20:23,566 --> 01:20:24,919
Not even
the transponder signal.

1097
01:20:25,006 --> 01:20:28,282
It's these canyons.
Go to higher ground, Sergeant.

1098
01:20:34,006 --> 01:20:35,803
Whiskey Outpost,
Whiskey Outpost...

1099
01:20:35,886 --> 01:20:37,638
this is Roughneck 2-0 on--

1100
01:20:40,846 --> 01:20:42,518
Look out!

1101
01:20:49,246 --> 01:20:50,804
Sugar, your weapon.

1102
01:20:57,326 --> 01:20:59,442
Help me! Help me!

1103
01:21:09,326 --> 01:21:12,762
I'd expect anyone in this unit
to do the same for me.

1104
01:21:14,086 --> 01:21:15,758
- Rico.
- Sir.

1105
01:21:15,846 --> 01:21:17,757
You're acting sergeant.
Move 'em out.

1106
01:21:19,086 --> 01:21:21,839
You heard the lieutenant!
Saddle up!

1107
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:14,757
Jeez, someone really
humped the bunk.

1108
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:16,962
- Watkins.
- Sir.

1109
01:22:17,046 --> 01:22:19,276
Secure this compound.
Police these bodies.

1110
01:22:19,366 --> 01:22:22,403
Yes, sir. Give me three
up on the tower, now!

1111
01:22:22,486 --> 01:22:24,363
- Aye-aye.
- OP there! OP there!

1112
01:22:24,446 --> 01:22:27,006
- Away!
- Number Two, police up these bodies!

1113
01:22:27,086 --> 01:22:28,963
- Stinks in there.
- Second squad,
come with me on the gate!

1114
01:22:29,046 --> 01:22:31,196
- Rico!
- Churchill, come with me!
- Yes, sir.

1115
01:22:31,286 --> 01:22:32,799
We need retrieval.
This place crawls.

1116
01:22:32,886 --> 01:22:35,036
Get somebody in the communications tent
and get me an uplink.

1117
01:22:35,126 --> 01:22:36,923
Yes, sir.
Diz, check it out.

1118
01:22:37,006 --> 01:22:38,359
- Roger.
- Command group with me.

1119
01:22:42,806 --> 01:22:44,000
Ah, shit.

1120
01:22:44,086 --> 01:22:45,405
Lieutenant!

1121
01:22:47,766 --> 01:22:50,838
Dirty bugs came in right
while they were having chow.

1122
01:22:56,246 --> 01:22:58,999
Yeah, this is
where they got in.

1123
01:23:00,566 --> 01:23:02,716
Lieutenant.

1124
01:23:02,806 --> 01:23:05,400
I think you're gonna
want to see this.

1125
01:23:05,486 --> 01:23:06,999
What do you got, Flores?

1126
01:23:07,086 --> 01:23:08,838
God, I hate this place.

1127
01:23:23,246 --> 01:23:25,601
What does that look like
to you, Rico?

1128
01:23:28,206 --> 01:23:29,958
Looks like a bug was
in his brain, sir.

1129
01:23:39,406 --> 01:23:41,874
They sucked his brains out.

1130
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:52,200
Open that.

1131
01:23:55,566 --> 01:23:57,318
Officer on the deck!

1132
01:23:57,406 --> 01:23:59,795
- Pick up the general.
- Gone?

1133
01:23:59,886 --> 01:24:01,399
Is it safe? We've got
to get out of here!

1134
01:24:01,486 --> 01:24:03,636
- General!
- We've gotta-
- Sir!

1135
01:24:06,926 --> 01:24:10,601
Thank God for you,
all of you.

1136
01:24:10,686 --> 01:24:13,803
You're all gonna be heroes.
Every last one of you.

1137
01:24:13,886 --> 01:24:16,275
- Close that hole.
- Yes, sir.

1138
01:24:16,366 --> 01:24:19,403
I had to evade capture. The security
of the Federation was at stake.

1139
01:24:19,486 --> 01:24:20,760
Fire in the hole!

1140
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:25,805
I have operational knowledge
of what we're up to out here.

1141
01:24:25,886 --> 01:24:28,195
- Flores, I need that uplink.
- Working on it, sir.

1142
01:24:28,286 --> 01:24:30,197
- Damn it.
- See?

1143
01:24:30,286 --> 01:24:31,878
- They get in your mind.
- Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.

1144
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:33,479
- Look, they did it to Farley.
- Do you read?

1145
01:24:33,566 --> 01:24:35,557
- They got in his mind.
- Come in, Battlegroup.
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1146
01:24:35,646 --> 01:24:38,604
They make you do things.
They made Farley call headquarters.

1147
01:24:38,686 --> 01:24:40,358
The distress call was a trap.

1148
01:24:40,446 --> 01:24:43,677
They're just like us.
They want to know what makes us tick.

1149
01:24:43,766 --> 01:24:45,643
They want to know us,
so they can kill us.

1150
01:24:45,726 --> 01:24:47,557
Roughnecks, this is lead.
Prepare for attack.

1151
01:24:47,646 --> 01:24:49,876
- I repeat, we're gonna be attacked.
- Where's the retrieval boat?

1152
01:24:49,966 --> 01:24:52,764
Mayday. Mayday. This is Roughneck 2-0
to Battlegroup. Do you read?

1153
01:24:52,846 --> 01:24:54,598
- Oh, God!
- Come in, Battlegroup.
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1154
01:24:54,686 --> 01:24:57,484
We're gonna die!
Don't you understand?

1155
01:24:57,566 --> 01:24:58,840
We're all gonna die!

1156
01:25:00,366 --> 01:25:01,719
Second squad, follow me!

1157
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:04,639
- Control yourself, General.
- I can't.

1158
01:25:04,726 --> 01:25:06,205
I can't.

1159
01:25:06,286 --> 01:25:07,844
I wish you'd just shoot me.

1160
01:25:10,126 --> 01:25:13,402
Lieutenant! He's just a little
out of his mind, sir.

1161
01:25:14,606 --> 01:25:16,437
Bugs! Bugs!

1162
01:25:16,526 --> 01:25:18,676
- Die!
- All right.

1163
01:25:18,766 --> 01:25:21,564
Warm it all up!
Everything you've got!

1164
01:25:21,646 --> 01:25:23,637
- Move!
- Come on, you apes!

1165
01:25:23,726 --> 01:25:25,239
You want to live forever?

1166
01:25:27,446 --> 01:25:28,765
- Here!
- I got bugs!

1167
01:25:57,926 --> 01:25:59,200
Fire at will!

1168
01:26:37,966 --> 01:26:39,319
Incoming!

1169
01:26:56,406 --> 01:26:57,600
Down!

1170
01:27:01,166 --> 01:27:02,360
No! Hey!

1171
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:09,959
- Watch your fire!
- Watch casualties!

1172
01:27:10,046 --> 01:27:12,162
Rico, where's
my communication?

1173
01:27:12,246 --> 01:27:14,237
- Diz, status on the uplink!
- Give me a minute.

1174
01:27:14,326 --> 01:27:16,123
We don't have a minute!

1175
01:27:25,046 --> 01:27:27,037
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.
We are under-

1176
01:27:27,126 --> 01:27:30,084
- This is Rodger Young. Go ahead.
- We are under attack, sir.
We need retrieval now!

1177
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:31,519
We have Planet P as clear.

1178
01:27:31,606 --> 01:27:33,597
This place crawls, sir.
We need pickup now!

1179
01:27:33,686 --> 01:27:35,836
-What's your position?
-Come down on this transmission.

1180
01:27:35,926 --> 01:27:37,439
Inside the outpost?
That's crazy!

1181
01:27:37,526 --> 01:27:39,323
Well, I hope you have
a crazy pilot. Out!

1182
01:28:10,566 --> 01:28:12,124
Lieutenant!

1183
01:28:12,206 --> 01:28:13,719
Boat coming down, sir!

1184
01:28:13,806 --> 01:28:17,162
Fall back into the compound!
Fall back!

1185
01:28:40,846 --> 01:28:43,406
Hold here!
Hold what you've got!

1186
01:28:53,646 --> 01:28:54,920
Running low!

1187
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:57,559
I'm out!

1188
01:28:57,646 --> 01:28:59,796
Here! Make 'em count!

1189
01:29:18,446 --> 01:29:20,277
Make cover fire!
Fall back!

1190
01:29:35,726 --> 01:29:37,398
Move, move, move!

1191
01:29:39,726 --> 01:29:42,115
Fall back to the boat!
Haul ass!

1192
01:29:55,286 --> 01:29:57,242
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

1193
01:30:00,766 --> 01:30:03,234
- Get him outta there!
- Pull!
- Come on!

1194
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:11,202
Rico! Rico!

1195
01:30:12,526 --> 01:30:15,643
- You know what to do!
- Yes, sir!

1196
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:21,719
Do it, Rico!

1197
01:30:45,966 --> 01:30:48,434
- Yeah!
- Dizzy!

1198
01:31:09,406 --> 01:31:11,078
No!

1199
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:13,839
Ace, help me!
Hold her down!

1200
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:20,676
Move!
Get her into the boat!

1201
01:31:22,206 --> 01:31:23,924
Come on, Diz!
Don't die on me!

1202
01:31:24,006 --> 01:31:25,234
Let's get her out!
Let's go, let's go!

1203
01:31:31,406 --> 01:31:33,044
Let's go! Get aboard!

1204
01:31:34,606 --> 01:31:36,403
Tower, let's go!

1205
01:31:42,286 --> 01:31:46,040
Let's move it, tower!
Run!

1206
01:31:51,846 --> 01:31:53,165
Lift off!

1207
01:32:22,526 --> 01:32:26,804
-Johnny, I'm dying-dying.
- No.

1208
01:32:26,886 --> 01:32:28,956
You're gonna be
all right, Diz.

1209
01:32:29,046 --> 01:32:32,083
It's all right...

1210
01:32:32,166 --> 01:32:34,521
because I got to have you.

1211
01:32:41,686 --> 01:32:43,642
Johnny, don't let me go!

1212
01:32:43,726 --> 01:32:45,398
Joh-Joh...

1213
01:32:45,486 --> 01:32:47,397
Don't let-
Don't let-

1214
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:08,925
This is traffic control. Proceed
on vector five-niner-two-two-seven.

1215
01:33:10,966 --> 01:33:12,604
I think you should know...

1216
01:33:13,806 --> 01:33:16,001
your friend Rico
is back there.

1217
01:33:24,886 --> 01:33:28,481
Get on the com and tell Fleet
to glass that rock.

1218
01:33:28,566 --> 01:33:30,204
On whose authority,
Corporal?

1219
01:33:30,286 --> 01:33:33,244
That would be mine, sir.
I assumed command of the mission.

1220
01:33:34,606 --> 01:33:36,961
Rodger Young,
we have an official request...

1221
01:33:37,046 --> 01:33:40,038
by the Mobile Infantry
to commence bombardment of Planet P.

1222
01:33:41,326 --> 01:33:43,635
I thought you were dead.

1223
01:33:43,726 --> 01:33:46,684
I'm not, but a lot
of my troopers are.

1224
01:33:46,766 --> 01:33:48,643
Negative on your request,
DeRuyter.

1225
01:33:48,726 --> 01:33:50,842
The Sky Marshal has
other plans for Planet P.

1226
01:33:50,926 --> 01:33:52,120
Welcome back.

1227
01:33:52,206 --> 01:33:55,164
MI does the dying.
Fleet just does the flying.

1228
01:33:55,246 --> 01:33:57,077
Hold on.
Something's up.

1229
01:33:57,166 --> 01:33:59,555
Fleet's mobilized
for a big operation.

1230
01:34:27,406 --> 01:34:29,158
Attention on deck!

1231
01:34:35,966 --> 01:34:37,797
Once somebody asked me...

1232
01:34:37,886 --> 01:34:40,195
if I knew the difference
between a citizen...

1233
01:34:40,286 --> 01:34:42,117
and a civilian.

1234
01:34:42,206 --> 01:34:43,719
I can tell you now.

1235
01:34:43,806 --> 01:34:45,797
A citizen has the courage...

1236
01:34:45,886 --> 01:34:50,198
to make the safety of the human race
their personal responsibility.

1237
01:34:54,206 --> 01:34:56,515
Dizzy was my friend.

1238
01:34:56,606 --> 01:34:58,642
She was a soldier.

1239
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:00,523
But more than that...

1240
01:35:00,606 --> 01:35:02,915
she was a citizen
of the Federation.

1241
01:35:05,246 --> 01:35:07,077
Present arms!

1242
01:35:24,846 --> 01:35:27,519
Order arms!

1243
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,438
Left face!

1244
01:35:45,966 --> 01:35:47,957
- Officer on deck!
- Carry on.

1245
01:35:49,486 --> 01:35:52,080
Burial detail dismissed.

1246
01:35:58,766 --> 01:36:00,916
At ease.

1247
01:36:01,006 --> 01:36:04,123
- How are you, Carl?
- Carmen, good.

1248
01:36:04,206 --> 01:36:07,004
Johnny, I'm sorry it had
to be your unit on P.

1249
01:36:07,086 --> 01:36:09,441
That mission had a very low
survival probability.

1250
01:36:09,526 --> 01:36:11,482
The bugs laid a trap
for us, didn't they?

1251
01:36:12,846 --> 01:36:15,155
Elegant proof
of intelligence, isn't it?

1252
01:36:15,246 --> 01:36:17,601
We thought there might be
a Brain Bug on P.

1253
01:36:17,686 --> 01:36:19,517
You knew, and you
sent them anyway?

1254
01:36:19,606 --> 01:36:22,837
We couldn't afford to launch an
operation if there wasn't one.

1255
01:36:24,686 --> 01:36:27,962
You don't approve.
Well, too bad.

1256
01:36:28,046 --> 01:36:29,877
We're in this for the species,
boys and girls.

1257
01:36:29,966 --> 01:36:32,241
It's simple numbers.
They have more.

1258
01:36:32,326 --> 01:36:33,998
And every day I have
to make decisions...

1259
01:36:34,086 --> 01:36:36,805
that send hundreds of people
like you to their deaths.

1260
01:36:36,886 --> 01:36:39,161
Didn't they tell you,
Colonel?

1261
01:36:39,246 --> 01:36:41,476
That's what the Mobile
Infantry is good for.

1262
01:36:41,566 --> 01:36:44,239
I hope you're ready for more.

1263
01:36:44,326 --> 01:36:47,477
We're going back to P
to capture that Brain.

1264
01:36:49,446 --> 01:36:52,085
The Roughnecks
are always ready, sir.

1265
01:36:52,166 --> 01:36:54,680
I hear they need a new lieutenant.
Want the job?

1266
01:36:54,766 --> 01:36:58,600
I'll take it, till I get killed
or you find someone better.

1267
01:37:00,726 --> 01:37:03,763
Attention. All personnel
report to your stations.

1268
01:37:03,846 --> 01:37:07,122
- Well-
- Prepare for drop in 75 minutes.

1269
01:37:07,206 --> 01:37:08,924
Take care of yourself, Johnny.

1270
01:37:09,006 --> 01:37:10,724
I'll see you again.

1271
01:37:23,366 --> 01:37:24,958
Officer on deck!

1272
01:37:41,686 --> 01:37:45,122
- Who are all these kids?
- We got reinforced.

1273
01:37:45,206 --> 01:37:47,322
Most of them are
fresh out of boot.

1274
01:37:47,406 --> 01:37:49,158
We're the old men, Ace.

1275
01:37:51,446 --> 01:37:53,596
This is for all you new people.

1276
01:37:53,686 --> 01:37:55,836
I only have one rule:

1277
01:37:55,926 --> 01:37:58,884
Everyone fights.
No one quits.

1278
01:37:58,966 --> 01:38:01,924
If you don't do your job,
I'll kill you myself.

1279
01:38:02,006 --> 01:38:03,234
Do you get me?

1280
01:38:03,326 --> 01:38:05,282
We get you, sir!

1281
01:38:05,366 --> 01:38:09,837
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rico's Roughnecks!

1282
01:38:12,366 --> 01:38:14,834
Today we're gonna pay
a visit to Bug City.

1283
01:38:14,926 --> 01:38:18,077
We're lookin' for a bug
no one's ever seen before.

1284
01:38:18,166 --> 01:38:19,918
Some kind of smart bug.

1285
01:38:25,606 --> 01:38:27,483
And it probably knows
we're comin'.

1286
01:38:27,566 --> 01:38:31,320
- Saddle up!
- Saddle up now!

1287
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:33,203
Come on!
Run, run, run, run, run!

1288
01:38:44,206 --> 01:38:46,083
Evasive action.

1289
01:39:08,486 --> 01:39:10,204
Get us clear for warp,
Number Two.

1290
01:39:10,286 --> 01:39:12,595
Clear in five, four...

1291
01:39:12,686 --> 01:39:14,563
- Initiating star drive...
- three-
- in five.

1292
01:39:37,766 --> 01:39:40,075
This is Rodger Young. We're going down
Repeat, this is Rodger Young.

1293
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:43,442
- Get out!
- We're going down.
- Abandon ship! Come on!

1294
01:39:44,806 --> 01:39:46,797
Carmen! Oh!

1295
01:39:46,886 --> 01:39:49,525
- Zander!
- Here!

1296
01:39:49,606 --> 01:39:52,598
- We've got to get to the rescue deck!
- Come on!

1297
01:40:08,486 --> 01:40:09,760
Captain!

1298
01:40:12,646 --> 01:40:15,365
Abandon ship.
That's an-

1299
01:40:16,806 --> 01:40:19,274
She's dead, Carmen.
She's dead!

1300
01:40:35,926 --> 01:40:38,645
Go! Here!

1301
01:40:53,446 --> 01:40:54,765
Follow me!

1302
01:41:06,006 --> 01:41:07,121
Ready?

1303
01:41:13,326 --> 01:41:14,645
Hit it!

1304
01:41:31,526 --> 01:41:34,199
Life pod Bravo 6-3,
two aboard.

1305
01:41:41,526 --> 01:41:45,997
Scanning for a landing zone!
Checking terrain. Here!

1306
01:41:46,086 --> 01:41:48,077
- Can you handle that?
- Piece of cake.

1307
01:41:51,726 --> 01:41:54,160
- We've lost the Rodger Young!
- What is your position?

1308
01:41:54,246 --> 01:41:57,682
Flight Command, we have confirmation.
The Rodger Young is down.

1309
01:41:57,766 --> 01:41:59,438
- Oh. Johnny!
- This is Flight Command.

1310
01:41:59,526 --> 01:42:01,517
Please repeat.
Please repeat.

1311
01:42:01,606 --> 01:42:05,042
- Johnny!
- We now have confirmation.
Rodger Young is down.

1312
01:42:05,126 --> 01:42:07,003
- I repeat, Rodger Young is down.
- Rodger Young just burned up.

1313
01:42:07,086 --> 01:42:10,317
- It's on the rescue net.
- Life pod Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1314
01:42:10,406 --> 01:42:13,204
- Is anyone receiving?
- Any survivors?
- Is anyone receiving?

1315
01:42:13,286 --> 01:42:15,800
- Well, they're getting tarred
up there pretty bad.
- Life pod...

1316
01:42:15,886 --> 01:42:17,205
Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1317
01:42:17,286 --> 01:42:18,799
Is anyone receiving?

1318
01:42:18,886 --> 01:42:20,205
- Is anyone receiving?
- Affirmative.

1319
01:42:20,286 --> 01:42:21,719
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1320
01:42:21,806 --> 01:42:23,285
You're breaking up.
Say again.

1321
01:42:23,366 --> 01:42:25,641
- Carmen?
- Say again. I'm losing you.

1322
01:42:25,726 --> 01:42:27,000
Carmen!

1323
01:42:30,766 --> 01:42:32,085
Prepare for landing.

1324
01:42:32,166 --> 01:42:33,918
Retros in three...

1325
01:42:34,006 --> 01:42:36,395
two, one, fire!

1326
01:42:51,806 --> 01:42:53,524
Carmen. Carmen.

1327
01:42:53,606 --> 01:42:55,676
- Hey, are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

1328
01:42:55,766 --> 01:42:57,119
Get out.
Get out.

1329
01:43:06,366 --> 01:43:10,325
This is Roughneck 2-0. Are you
receiving? Over. This is Roughneck 2-0.

1330
01:43:10,406 --> 01:43:13,716
- Carmen, are you receiving?
- Johnny, is that you?
- Yeah!

1331
01:43:13,806 --> 01:43:16,400
- It's me! Wh-What's your
position and situation?
- Yeah.

1332
01:43:16,486 --> 01:43:18,044
We're in Bug City,
20 metres underground.

1333
01:43:18,126 --> 01:43:21,243
Position:
south 42, east 118.

1334
01:43:21,326 --> 01:43:23,282
Situation is-

1335
01:43:23,366 --> 01:43:25,084
I repeat.
South 42, east 118.

1336
01:43:25,166 --> 01:43:27,475
What's your situation?
Over.

1337
01:43:27,566 --> 01:43:28,885
Carmen.

1338
01:43:31,046 --> 01:43:32,877
Situation is
extremely hostile.

1339
01:43:37,606 --> 01:43:39,483
I need a squad
to pull 'em out!

1340
01:43:39,566 --> 01:43:41,682
- Direction?
- Three clicks, south by southwest.

1341
01:43:47,886 --> 01:43:49,524
Look out!

1342
01:44:07,686 --> 01:44:10,075
- What do you wanna do?
- You heard the lieutenant.

1343
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:14,318
Rescue party!
Third squad, come with me!

1344
01:44:14,406 --> 01:44:16,715
Cancel that!

1345
01:44:16,806 --> 01:44:19,445
You know as well as I do,
she's already dead.

1346
01:44:22,726 --> 01:44:24,000
Sorry, buddy.

1347
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:29,362
Roughnecks, let's move.

1348
01:44:29,446 --> 01:44:31,437
All right.

1349
01:44:45,606 --> 01:44:47,437
Why didn't they kill us?

1350
01:44:47,526 --> 01:44:49,596
They want us alive.

1351
01:45:41,366 --> 01:45:43,596
We should go this way.

1352
01:45:44,886 --> 01:45:47,195
A Company's that way.

1353
01:45:47,286 --> 01:45:51,359
Yeah, but Carmen's
down there.

1354
01:45:51,446 --> 01:45:54,643
Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy,
but word has it she's dead.

1355
01:45:56,086 --> 01:45:57,280
She's still alive.

1356
01:45:57,366 --> 01:45:59,516
How do you know?

1357
01:45:59,606 --> 01:46:02,200
- I don't know how I know, but I know.
- Listen.

1358
01:46:02,286 --> 01:46:04,595
You got command,
but going off mission--

1359
01:46:04,686 --> 01:46:06,961
- That's a serious offence.
- Yeah.

1360
01:46:07,046 --> 01:46:08,923
I think they
hang you for that.

1361
01:46:11,046 --> 01:46:14,721
Roughneck 2-0,
proceed on mission.

1362
01:46:14,806 --> 01:46:17,320
I need two volunteers.

1363
01:47:25,248 --> 01:47:26,681
One day...

1364
01:47:26,768 --> 01:47:29,077
someone like me...

1365
01:47:29,168 --> 01:47:30,840
is gonna kill you...

1366
01:47:30,928 --> 01:47:32,964
and your whole fucking race.

1367
01:48:29,608 --> 01:48:30,723
You know what this is?

1368
01:48:33,608 --> 01:48:34,882
Sure you do.

1369
01:48:36,408 --> 01:48:38,876
You're some kind
of big, fat, smart bug...

1370
01:48:38,968 --> 01:48:40,242
aren't you?

1371
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:44,279
Come on.

1372
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:56,926
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1373
01:48:57,008 --> 01:49:00,478
Brain Bug sighted moving
west of grid five.

1374
01:49:02,648 --> 01:49:04,001
Run!

1375
01:49:32,888 --> 01:49:35,243
Go! Go!

1376
01:49:35,328 --> 01:49:38,638
- Give me the nuke!
- You trying to be a hero, Watkins?

1377
01:49:40,728 --> 01:49:43,959
I'm trying to kill
some bugs, sir!

1378
01:49:44,048 --> 01:49:47,085
Get outta here!
Get outta here!

1379
01:49:48,568 --> 01:49:49,842
Move!

1380
01:49:54,328 --> 01:49:57,445
Come on! You like that?
You like that? Come on!

1381
01:49:57,528 --> 01:49:58,802
You want a little more?

1382
01:50:02,088 --> 01:50:05,046
You like that? You like that?
You like that? You like that?
You want a little more?

1383
01:50:11,008 --> 01:50:12,157
Come on! Come on!

1384
01:50:17,288 --> 01:50:18,562
Come on, come on, come on!

1385
01:50:42,088 --> 01:50:43,237
Come on, Carmen.

1386
01:50:55,048 --> 01:50:57,482
- We did it!
- We won!

1387
01:51:02,568 --> 01:51:04,718
- What's going on?
- They got it!

1388
01:51:04,808 --> 01:51:05,923
Come on!

1389
01:51:18,848 --> 01:51:22,761
Pull! Pull! Pull!

1390
01:51:34,208 --> 01:51:36,119
Quiet!

1391
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:49,358
What's it thinking, Colonel?

1392
01:52:06,688 --> 01:52:07,916
It's afraid.

1393
01:52:09,328 --> 01:52:10,556
It's afraid!

1394
01:52:14,488 --> 01:52:17,719
- Come on.
- Yeah!

1395
01:52:17,808 --> 01:52:20,117
Carl! Carl! Hey!

1396
01:52:20,208 --> 01:52:23,006
Well, look who's here.
You made it. Good.

1397
01:52:23,088 --> 01:52:26,239
It was you, wasn't it?
You told me how to find Carmen.

1398
01:52:26,328 --> 01:52:27,761
Well, that's classified.

1399
01:52:29,808 --> 01:52:32,447
You know, whenever
the three of us are together...

1400
01:52:32,528 --> 01:52:35,326
I feel like things
might just work out.

1401
01:52:35,408 --> 01:52:37,239
I hope you're right,
Carmen.

1402
01:52:37,328 --> 01:52:40,126
We've got one of their Brains now.
Pretty soon we'll know how they think.

1403
01:52:40,208 --> 01:52:42,676
And then we'll know
how to beat them.

1404
01:52:42,768 --> 01:52:44,759
One day it will all be over...

1405
01:52:44,848 --> 01:52:47,646
and everyone will forget
that this was the moment.

1406
01:52:47,728 --> 01:52:50,526
This is when it turned.

1407
01:52:50,608 --> 01:52:54,521
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet,
it wasn't some fancy new weapon.

1408
01:52:58,288 --> 01:53:01,246
It was a drill instructor named Zim
who captured a Brain.

1409
01:53:01,328 --> 01:53:02,841
Come on!
Who am I?

1410
01:53:02,928 --> 01:53:04,964
- Yeah!
- Zim?

1411
01:53:06,328 --> 01:53:08,558
He got him! Yeah!

1412
01:53:08,648 --> 01:53:10,798
Zim. Zim got the bug.

1413
01:53:10,888 --> 01:53:12,401
Zim got the bug, man!

1414
01:53:12,488 --> 01:53:15,639
- Good job, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

1415
01:53:15,728 --> 01:53:20,358
- That would be private, sir.
- Carry on, Private.

1416
01:53:20,448 --> 01:53:22,962
- Yes, sir!
- Yeah!

1417
01:53:27,208 --> 01:53:30,166
What mysteries
will the Brain Bug reveal?

1418
01:53:30,248 --> 01:53:34,958
Federal scientists are working
around the clock to probe its secrets.

1419
01:53:35,048 --> 01:53:38,404
Once we understand the bug,
we will defeat it.

1420
01:53:44,328 --> 01:53:45,761
We have the ships.

1421
01:53:45,848 --> 01:53:47,122
We have the weapons.

1422
01:53:48,568 --> 01:53:50,479
We need soldiers.

1423
01:53:50,568 --> 01:53:52,718
Soldiers like
Lieutenant Stack Lumbrezer.

1424
01:53:52,808 --> 01:53:54,799
We're over the target
area now, Captain.

1425
01:53:54,888 --> 01:53:57,925
- And Captain Carmen Ibanez.
- This is the captain speaking.

1426
01:53:58,008 --> 01:53:59,600
All personnel
prepare for drop.

1427
01:53:59,688 --> 01:54:02,327
Soldiers like Private Ace Levy
and Lieutenant John Rico.

1428
01:54:02,408 --> 01:54:05,764
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?

1429
01:54:05,848 --> 01:54:07,247
We need you all.

1430
01:54:07,328 --> 01:54:10,638
Service guarantees citizenship.
