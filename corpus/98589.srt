1
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,558
Happy birthday, honey.

2
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,925
The past,
everything that went before,

3
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,636
is a dry leaf fallen from a dead tree.

4
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,763
The tree's been cut down,

5
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:39,476
the leaf crushed by feet
and ground into earth.

6
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:43,958
So now there is only
the memory of trees.

7
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:48,957
l am the disease
that rots the bark of trees.

8
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:52,799
l am rust and gravity.

9
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,963
ln my dreams we are all together again,
and my mom is happy.

10
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:04,246
But then the leaves all fall off the trees,
and my dad is gone.

11
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:10,082
''l call out to him, but wherever he is,
he can't hear me.''

12
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,079
Mr Clark, please.

13
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:19,876
This is AP English. lf you can't extend
a modicum of respect to your classmates,

14
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:22,276
you are free to go right
on down the hall to auto shop.

15
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:23,482
Sorry.

16
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,717
Thank you.

17
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:31,796
Miss Denning, how do you feel
about that piece of writing?

18
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:38,997
Anyone else? Praise, criticism
for Miss Denning's poem?

19
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:46,519
lt's very nice. Good work.

20
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:51,283
Anyone interested in vying
for the Discovery Award for Young Poets,

21
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:56,566
we will be discussing the details today
after school in Poets' Circle, room 302.

22
00:02:56,647 --> 00:03:00,720
And, just in case the $3,000 scholarship
doesn't entice you,

23
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,765
the finals are held in Florida
over spring break.

24
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:07,402
Journals in the box.

25
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:18,479
Miss Denning...

26
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:21,081
You can go deeper.

27
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:27,799
- You're not staying?
- l have to take care of my sister.

28
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:30,117
Do you want me to pick up
an application for you?

29
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:33,722
- They're not gonna pick me.
- Auster's judging the finals.

30
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:35,718
What did he say to you?

31
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:37,798
Nothin'.

32
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:47,481
A man in Mexico burst his own eardrums
with a pencil and sewed his eyelids shut.

33
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:51,321
He says because the government
is deaf and blind to people's pain.

34
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:53,284
Lily, shut up.

35
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,005
Look.

36
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,518
Stop it!

37
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:16,483
You'd better stay in there,
you little brat!

38
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,358
Where's Lily?

39
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:34,403
- Megan...
- l didn't do anything.

40
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:39,442
Lily? Open the door.

41
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:46,761
What's it gonna take? Huh?

42
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,242
Get ready for bed.

43
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:51,806
lt wasn't my fault.

44
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:55,163
l expect you to take care of her
when l'm gone.

45
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:58,557
- Get a baby-sitter.
- l can't afford a baby-sitter.

46
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:03,001
You do have a responsibility to this family.

47
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:05,885
You had her. You take care of her.

48
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,277
What did you say?

49
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,722
Get out of my sight.

50
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,636
lt's gonna get infected.

51
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:50,637
You've gotta stop hurting yourself, Lily.

52
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:21,887
Mr Blazek.

53
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,115
Mr Blazek.

54
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:25,402
Channelling Bukowski - very good.

55
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,205
Mr Cappo.

56
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:31,085
l believe ''blow job'' is two words.

57
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,476
Or maybe it's a hyphen.

58
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,558
Miss Denning.

59
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,957
Mr Sadler. Another adventure story.

60
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:17,998
Crap!

61
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:32,563
- Want a ride?
- No, it's OK.

62
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:34,603
Come on.

63
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,881
So are you starting
to look for colleges?

64
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:58,960
Oh, l think l'm just gonna stay here
and go to Sinclair.

65
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:04,400
Well, there are scholarships, you know.
l mean, in addition to the contest.

66
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:07,877
Well, l just got a job, so l'm kind of busy.

67
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:18,126
Have your parents ever read your work?

68
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:23,156
My mom has school after her work,
so she's kind of busy,

69
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:26,125
and l don't really see my dad.

70
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:29,726
Ever?

71
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:33,405
Birthdays and Christmas and...

72
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:39,760
He and my mom don't really get along,
so it's kind of... kind of easier that way.

73
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,963
Easier for you?

74
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:50,439
We're the building
up on the... on the right.

75
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:59,155
l'd like you to enter the poetry contest.

76
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,239
l can give you my lunch hour
a few days a week to help you prepare.

77
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:05,239
- But l'm not a poet.
- Not yet.

78
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,677
You miss the bus?

79
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,804
- You see me on it?
- No.

80
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,037
Draw your own conclusions.

81
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:25,677
Where'd you get those?

82
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:29,122
Did you take them from the storage space?

83
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:31,960
Draw your own conclusions.

84
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,844
Put 'em away before Mom comes home.

85
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,558
Who's this?

86
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:44,199
- Dad.
- No, the baby.

87
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,476
l wasn't an angel.

88
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,482
lt's not me. You have his face.
Same chubby cheeks, same eyes...

89
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,084
You look just like him.

90
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:30,275
Lily, get up.

91
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:38,165
Lily, you'd better be ready
to leave in two minutes.

92
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,636
Why are you all dressed up?

93
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,683
Do you have your lunch?

94
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:52,555
No. l don't want it.
Why are you wearing Mom's shirt?

95
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:54,638
Why are you such a pest?

96
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:59,560
- That's his house.
- Auster's?

97
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:02,878
Yep. He won some big award for writing
a long time ago.

98
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:07,165
You know that leather book
he carries around? lt's his novel.

99
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:11,240
- How would you know?
- My parents used to be friends with him.

100
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:13,795
lf he told you to enter the contest, you're in.

101
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,359
Sorry.

102
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:23,156
Oh, no, please, don't be. Please.

103
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:48,076
Great poets touch the hidden nerve.

104
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:54,478
So, we need a map of your nerve centres.

105
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:59,766
lf you're going to reveal them in your work,
you need to know where they are.

106
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,876
That's for later.

107
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,115
What was ''The Memory of Trees'' about?

108
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:21,281
You said ''l am rust and gravity.''
What does that mean?

109
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:24,524
That l felt bad.

110
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:30,921
Was there a particular time when you felt
bad, or you just felt bad in general?

111
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,004
l don't know.

112
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:41,159
All right. What was the poem about?

113
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:46,521
My dad leaving.

114
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,159
So what happened when your dad left?

115
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,837
Was it day or night?

116
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:57,565
Night.

117
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,286
Did he say goodbye to you when he left?

118
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:06,517
Miss Denning, l want you
to write about that day. ln detail.

119
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:10,395
Write about the weather, write about what
you were wearing, what you were thinking.

120
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:15,322
Be specific. A whole world
emerges from little details.

121
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:28,198
For example, when we buried my son,
l'd forgotten to put in my contact lenses

122
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:33,236
and l stood over him
right before they closed the coffin

123
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:36,603
trying to fix him in my memory.

124
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:43,604
l could see the red from his sweater
and his blue pants,

125
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:50,206
and there was a scab on his forehead that
hadn't healed - from a bicycle accident -

126
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,562
and l could feel that scab
when l kissed him,

127
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:58,597
but when l looked at him,
it was... well, it was out of focus.

128
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:04,200
So, when your dad left,
what were you doing?

129
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,878
l don't remember.

130
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,804
Forget that l'm here.
OK? l'm not here.

131
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:18,957
Now, just close your eyes.

132
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,602
Where are you standing?

133
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:32,242
By my window in my room.

134
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:37,398
Did your dad leave in a van, or a taxi, or...?

135
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:41,162
- A car.
- A car.

136
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,477
What colour was the car?

137
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,802
Blue.

138
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:49,443
OK. Go on.

139
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:52,675
''You're on a voyage
across an uncharted sea.''

140
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,327
''You must believe
that there is land beyond the horizon.''

141
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:57,443
''What land
remains as a question mark,

142
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:00,803
but that is the mystery,
the joy of discovery...''

143
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,597
He doesn't write that stuff to me.

144
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:06,679
- Maybe he'll ask you to the prom.
- Shut up.

145
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,244
Meg, Mom wants to talk to you.

146
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,159
Hi.

147
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,759
She won't. She's on a hunger strike.

148
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,163
Well, l can't make her.

149
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:18,041
Hello?

150
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:24,165
l thought your class was only till nine.

151
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,478
Whatever.

152
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,962
Meg?

153
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,807
OK. You tell me.

154
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,800
- l don't know.
- Why not?

155
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:02,039
- What's funny?
- Nothing.

156
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:04,721
Well, why did you laugh?

157
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,078
l don't know.

158
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,443
Are you afraid l'm gonna tell you
that your work stinks?

159
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,757
- Does it?
- What do you think?

160
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,756
Probably. l don't know.

161
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:25,082
Come back when you do.

162
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:30,277
lt doesn't stink.

163
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,524
There's a line that l like.

164
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:38,157
Which one?

165
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:47,365
''Lost leaves spin past the glass, but the
trees don't go, they stay by my window.''

166
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:50,282
What about the rest of it?

167
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:52,483
l could go deeper.

168
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,558
Good for you.

169
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:59,395
So, Meg, how are things going
over at Seymour and Cedar?

170
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:01,717
Fine.

171
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,756
- Did they say they were happy with her?
- Well, Steve hasn't called.

172
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:09,236
Well, l guess that's good.

173
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:13,006
You don't have school tomorrow,
do you, Mom?

174
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:17,365
No, honey, my interview is tomorrow.
Why?

175
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:23,841
Well, l just have this thing, this writing
contest, where we're gonna read our stuff.

176
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:25,724
What time?

177
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:27,923
After school.

178
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:34,839
l don't know if l'll be able to make it.
l don't know when l'll be done.

179
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:39,045
- l didn't call to confirm.
- lt's all right. l talked to him this afternoon.

180
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:42,961
Oh. Well, did he say
who else he was considering?

181
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:46,562
- Somebody in plastics.
- A man or a woman?

182
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:49,323
Diane, stop.

183
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:55,757
Then you'll have to take the bus
to Mrs Rand's tomorrow, OK?

184
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:05,763
Maybe when l get this job we can all go out
and celebrate, huh? The four of us.

185
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:12,205
- Have you sent Don a thank-you note?
- No.

186
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:17,281
Well, please do that.
He didn't have to help you get that job.

187
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:21,117
l'd like to read your story.

188
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:23,198
lt's not a story.

189
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,596
- l thought you said...
- lt's a poem.

190
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:28,155
Well, l would like to read it.

191
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,840
- Georgia in the contest too?
- Yeah.

192
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,518
Well, maybe her mom
can drop you off at Mrs Rand's.

193
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:42,599
l don't wanna go there, Mom.
Her house stinks.

194
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:44,757
Don't start.

195
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:48,316
Don went to a lot of trouble
to get me this interview,

196
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:52,958
and if l get that job it'll be a lot more money
for all of us, so don't be a pill.

197
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:54,765
Wish me luck.

198
00:20:54,847 --> 00:20:57,361
- Good luck.
- Good girl.

199
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:09,276
This is called ''Blue Car''.

200
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:13,920
''l rode my bike past our old house.''

201
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:17,477
''A rusty chair keeps your place
on the lawn.''

202
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:22,083
''Lily cuts holes in herself to hurt you,
but you just won't bleed.''

203
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,522
''Now she won't eat.''

204
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,843
''Since you left,
Mom doesn't say your name.''

205
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:32,317
''But even gone, l remember your face

206
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:35,877
The way the sun stays bright
when l shut my eyes,

207
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:40,518
The way a torch whipping the dark
leaves a long red scar.''

208
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:45,044
''Some nights when l wake up,
l forget where we are.''

209
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:53,840
''From our apartment, l can't see
the stars or the horizon, only the road.''

210
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:56,646
''l know it goes to wherever you are.''

211
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:02,607
Miss Denning, do you have a second?

212
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:06,038
Sure.

213
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,636
Losing a contest
doesn't mean you lack talent,

214
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:27,847
any more than... than winning one
makes you Ezra Pound.

215
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:30,157
Do you understand that?

216
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,727
All of your life you'll be judged.

217
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:39,880
Some people will love you,
some will say you stink.

218
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,878
None of it matters.

219
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:46,006
The opinions of these judges,
your friends, your mother, me.

220
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:49,284
What matters is the condition of your soul.

221
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,244
That it remain intact.

222
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:55,878
And that you stay strong and
you keep doing the work no matter what.

223
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:59,039
- l will.
- No matter what.

224
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:02,399
l will. l have to go.

225
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:05,321
So, congratulations.

226
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:10,446
- l won?
- Yes, you did.

227
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:15,757
So now we have to talk
about how to get you to the finals.

228
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:18,645
Florida? Are you gonna be there?

229
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:21,287
Yeah, l'll be there.

230
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:28,238
OK? Ms Pound, you can... you can go.

231
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:36,163
l would actually be reporting directly
to Don, though Frank would be my boss.

232
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:38,283
So when do you hear?

233
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:41,999
Could be as soon as Monday.

234
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:49,078
l know you've been
picking up the slack lately.

235
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:52,842
How does a sperm get into the egg
to fertilise it?

236
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,245
- l have some books at home.
- l've read those books.

237
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:04,880
lf the sperm is in the man's penis,
and then the egg is in the woman's uretus,

238
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:07,401
how do they come together?

239
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:11,601
Did l give you permission
to borrow my blouse?

240
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:13,757
So how does the egg enter the uretus?

241
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:16,281
Do we have to have another talk
with Father Allwart?

242
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:17,800
No, thank you.

243
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:20,959
Then keep your hands
off of things that don't belong to you.

244
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:24,403
- How does the egg enter the uretus?
- Uterus!

245
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:27,763
Do you hear me?
Don't touch my things without asking.

246
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:30,800
''So our lives are difficult,
and perhaps unpardonable,

247
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:34,926
And the fey gauds of youth have,
as the old men told us they would, faded.''

248
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,567
''But still, it is morning again, this day.''

249
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:41,526
''ln the flowering trees, the birds take up
their indifferent, elegant cries.''

250
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:45,202
''Look around. Perhaps it isn't too late
to make a fool of yourself again.''

251
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:48,518
''Perhaps it isn't too late
to flap your arms and cry out,

252
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:53,442
To give one more cracked rendition
of your singular, aspirant song.''

253
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:00,286
ls this where they have it?

254
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,800
Yep.

255
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:06,639
You can hold on to that, if you'd like.

256
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:12,240
- No lunch?
- No.

257
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,602
- Come on, here.
- Oh, no, thanks. lt's OK.

258
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:17,759
No, no. l will be offended if you don't.

259
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:24,996
- What kind of bread is this?
- lt's rosemary.

260
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:27,317
You've never had it before?

261
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:34,443
Tell your mom if she has any questions
she can call me.

262
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,920
Do you think
she'll be able to come with you?

263
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:41,282
l haven't asked her yet.

264
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:44,925
lf your family can't afford to send you,
the school might consider...

265
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:47,123
We can afford it.

266
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:50,358
''Blue Car''.

267
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:53,842
Do you think l could win?

268
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:59,202
The girl wants to win. Maybe l should
write that here on the application, huh?

269
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:01,721
Well, no, maybe l should change my poem.

270
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:04,275
Write about America,
write about something nice.

271
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,005
No.

272
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:08,237
You write what you care about.

273
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:15,639
Can you read me some of your novel?

274
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:19,436
- What do you mean, my novel?
- Georgia told me.

275
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:25,203
l'm not gonna copy you or anything.
Just for inspiration.

276
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:41,275
''ln one creative thought,
a thousand nights of love revive,

277
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:45,918
filling it with sublimity and exaltation.''

278
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:50,125
''And those who come together in the night,
in a rocking delight,

279
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:54,758
do an earnest work, and gather
sweetnesses, gather depth and strength

280
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,725
for the song of some coming poet

281
00:26:57,807 --> 00:27:03,040
who will arise to speak
of ecstasies beyond telling.''

282
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:09,362
''And though they err and embrace blindly,
the future comes all the same.''

283
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:12,723
lt's beautiful.

284
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,366
- Sorry.
- No... What's up?

285
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:21,966
Can l have some money for lunch?

286
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:28,885
Meg, this is my son Rob.
This is Meg.

287
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,480
Hi.

288
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,558
Thanks.

289
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,041
l never realised he was your son.

290
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:40,243
That's my son.

291
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:43,399
Ready or not,
the future comes all the same.

292
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,998
Where's Mom?

293
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,157
She took me to the doctor.

294
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:58,523
- What did he do?
- The usual.

295
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:03,367
We met Don afterwards.

296
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,677
Did she get the job?

297
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,886
l don't look like anyone.

298
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:10,197
Not even myself.

299
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:16,440
He said not to indulge her.
When she gets hungry enough, she'll eat.

300
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:20,122
He's a quack, Mom. She hasn't had
anything but water in two weeks.

301
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:23,085
She's probably eating at school.

302
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:27,044
Maybe we could take her to Florida.
Over spring break.

303
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:29,118
lt's a really good place for sick people.

304
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:33,439
l cannot afford the bills l have, Megan.
l can't take you on a vacation.

305
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:37,964
- Well, if you get the job, then...
- l'm not getting the job.

306
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:43,720
Angels don't fall out of the sky.
They emerge from within.

307
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:49,677
There is an angel within each one of you,
and he is your personal bridge to heaven.

308
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,682
This is the body of Christ.

309
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:56,601
This is the body of Christ.

310
00:30:00,127 --> 00:30:03,085
Blessed are the pure at heart,
for they shall see God.

311
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:07,160
- l'm an angel.
- The Lord knows you are, my child.

312
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,523
The body of Christ.

313
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:18,083
The body of Christ.

314
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:28,085
Lily...

315
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:33,281
- Lily?
- Oh, God...

316
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:34,880
Honey?

317
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,925
Lily? Lily? Honey?

318
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:41,767
ls the hurt new? Yes?

319
00:30:43,327 --> 00:30:47,525
l'm gonna get the nurse to fix it.
What do you think?

320
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:10,723
Mr Auster? lt's Meg Denning.

321
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:14,042
l'm sorry to bother you.

322
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:17,876
Well, l just wanted to talk.

323
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,840
My sister's not doing very well.

324
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:26,884
Mr Kastran? l have a family emergency.
ls it OK if l go home early? My dad's here.

325
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:29,003
- Are there any customers upstairs?
- No.

326
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,521
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

327
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:38,156
- Megan, she's gonna be OK.
- l don't know.

328
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:44,277
No, she will. She's in the hospital now, and
they're gonna take very good care of her.

329
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:50,486
lt's OK. She's gonna be fine.

330
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:56,996
l wanna take her to Florida.
Everything's gonna be fine.

331
00:31:57,087 --> 00:32:00,477
l'm not gonna listen to my mom any longer.

332
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:14,515
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah.

333
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:21,721
Sorry if l got stuff all over your shirt.

334
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:24,682
lt's not a problem.

335
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:31,559
Why are you so nice to me?

336
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:36,157
l mean, l'm glad.

337
00:32:39,247 --> 00:32:41,807
Thanks for coming.

338
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:43,605
Anytime.

339
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:57,160
- Where the hell have you been?
- l forgot my backpack.

340
00:32:57,247 --> 00:33:00,045
- Where were you?
- Work.

341
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:03,358
l called work.
They said that you left with your father.

342
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:06,120
How did you get home?

343
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:08,198
A friend.

344
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:12,686
l have been driving around for two hours
looking for you.

345
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:17,161
l called your father. He had absolutely
no idea what l was talking about.

346
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,319
You wanna go to Florida?
l can't even trust you two miles from home.

347
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:22,443
Get in there.

348
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:29,080
You can go to school and to work
and to the hospital. That's it.

349
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:33,445
You will come straight home after work,
and if you don't, then you don't get to work.

350
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:36,758
Do you understand me? And when
l find out who your little boyfriend is,

351
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:41,443
l'm gonna tell his parents
he's an inconsiderate little brat.

352
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:49,363
Unfortunately, we do need your mother
to co-sign for any withdrawals.

353
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:53,918
- But it's my account.
- That's the way the account was set up.

354
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:33,407
l wish that you could stay with us.

355
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,762
l wish that you could stay with us.

356
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:38,156
- Do you guys drive?
- No, we fly.

357
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:42,763
Unless Pat goes.
But he's on parole, thank God.

358
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,078
The four of us in one car for ten hours
is basically hell.

359
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,362
You know, you probably could stay with us.

360
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:51,200
l don't think Tampa's very far
from Siesta Beach.

361
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:54,597
That way all you'd have to do
is pay for the airline ticket.

362
00:34:56,047 --> 00:35:00,677
- l don't know these people.
- They're really nice.

363
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,918
Did they invite us, or is this just Georgia?

364
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:08,886
Georgia said that
she was gonna ask her family.

365
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:13,563
lf you need to work, then l could take Lily
and you can have a break.

366
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:16,639
l don't know, Megan. l just...

367
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:20,439
Hello?

368
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:23,805
Could you close that door, honey?

369
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:25,206
Yeah.

370
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,040
Because l don't believe you.

371
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:33,881
Well, what about my family?

372
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:48,364
Here.

373
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:53,795
l got you some chocolate, too.
Your favourite.

374
00:35:57,887 --> 00:36:01,880
They can make you disappear in the night.

375
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:06,643
They break the doors and windows,
and then they amputate the wings.

376
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:11,276
- Can you see them?
- What?

377
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:13,843
Wings.

378
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:19,047
They won't grow
because there's invisible food in the tubes.

379
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:23,520
Lily, you don't need wings.

380
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:26,917
We're gonna fly to Florida. ln a plane.

381
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:30,405
The ceiling's too low.

382
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:49,360
- What did they say?
- They're gonna move her.

383
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:51,438
Where?

384
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:54,797
The psychiatric wing.

385
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:04,918
- Hey. Everything OK at home?
- Oh, yeah. Everything's fine.

386
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:09,239
Um, l was just wondering if it would be
possible to get my pay in cash this week.

387
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,966
- That could probably be arranged.
- Thanks a lot.

388
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:13,844
You bet.

389
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,162
When did you purchase these?

390
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:30,205
Couple of weeks ago.
They were, like, $40 each.

391
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:33,040
- You bought them here?
- Yeah.

392
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:36,164
This isn't our stock.
Perhaps if you can find your receipt?

393
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:38,715
l got 'em at the Beermans in Oakmeadow.

394
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:41,321
l'm afraid l can't help you.

395
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,682
Oh, God, no...

396
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:07,038
lt's Lily.

397
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,444
The window was open, and she fell.

398
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:16,125
Oh, Jesus, God, no!

399
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:20,564
We deliver her up to you, O Lord,
to your arms and your mercy.

400
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:22,524
The 23rd Psalm.

401
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:24,916
''The Lord is my shepherd;
l shall not want.''

402
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:29,364
''He makes me lie down in green pastures;
he leads me beside still waters.''

403
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:35,283
''He restores my soul. He leads me
in right paths for his name's sake...''

404
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:03,282
l don't belong here?
For God's sake, she's my daughter!

405
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:05,198
You wouldn't know it!

406
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:09,041
- You don't come around...
- And whose fault is that, exactly?

407
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:12,164
Am l the one
trying to turn the kids against you?

408
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:34,242
l'm going to work.

409
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:22,277
Yeah.

410
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:26,406
Yeah, all right, fine.
That's how we'll handle it, then. Bye.

411
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:29,482
Do you have
any personal belongings here?

412
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:30,716
No.

413
00:41:30,807 --> 00:41:36,120
Good. Clear out. Your pay should
just about cover the cost of the ties.

414
00:41:37,007 --> 00:41:39,601
- Get out of my store.
- l need my money.

415
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:42,076
You should've thought of that
before you stole from me.

416
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,237
- l didn't steal anything!
- Get out of here anyway.

417
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:47,683
l didn't steal anything! Asshole!

418
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:07,766
- What are you doing?
- Where are they? The things you stole.

419
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:12,279
- l didn't steal anything.
- l thought we were done with this.

420
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:14,806
Get out of my room.

421
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:19,915
When you contribute to the rent
of this place, then it'll be your room.

422
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:22,999
Hey! Hey, that's my stuff!

423
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:24,918
Go ahead, ground me.

424
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:28,761
You're never even home. What are
you gonna do, hire an armed guard?

425
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:33,284
l'm going to Florida, or wherever else
l wanna go. lt's none of your business.

426
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:37,440
Then maybe you better find
someplace else to live.

427
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:40,200
- Fine. l'll go live with Dad.
- Oh, good.

428
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:43,802
You do that. You think he's so wonderful?
You go see how you like it over there.

429
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:46,037
At least he doesn't try
to control everything l do.

430
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:49,039
Your father doesn't give a shit about you.

431
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:52,275
How many times did he come around here
last year? What, three?

432
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:53,959
He doesn't come here because of you!

433
00:42:54,047 --> 00:42:58,643
He can't even manage to pay the lousy
$60 a week in child support he owes me!

434
00:42:58,727 --> 00:43:02,959
l am up to here in debts
trying to give you a life l can't afford!

435
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:07,438
l work 1 2 hours a day and go to school
at night so that l can make life nice for you,

436
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:10,837
and all that l ask is that you respect
the few rules that l lay down.

437
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:13,282
And when l stick my neck out
to get you a job,

438
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:16,723
you don't embarrass me
in front of my friends.

439
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:18,957
- That's all you care about, isn't it?
- What?

440
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:21,436
Your stupid friends! Stupid Don!

441
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,035
You're an ungrateful brat.

442
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:48,804
What do you think you're doing?

443
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:52,482
You can't just pack her away into
a storage unit like you did with Dad.

444
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:56,401
- Put that back in there.
- She's not yours, you fucking bitch!

445
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:35,878
l'm sure your mother feels
a tremendous grief.

446
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:40,399
And to lose a child is...

447
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,885
Well, my son Lucas was only four.

448
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:50,882
You wanna tell me how you feel?

449
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,958
l don't know.

450
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:05,238
How do you think your sister would feel
if she lost you?

451
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:09,560
Sad.

452
00:45:09,647 --> 00:45:11,399
Yeah...

453
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:14,763
l don't know...

454
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,563
Mad?

455
00:45:18,647 --> 00:45:21,161
Well, who would she be mad at?

456
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:25,163
My mom.

457
00:45:26,127 --> 00:45:28,880
Why would she be mad at your mom?

458
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:35,444
Do you think your mom
could've saved her?

459
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:39,278
Maybe l...

460
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,239
Maybe l could have.

461
00:45:42,327 --> 00:45:44,443
This is not your fault.

462
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:48,479
lt's not your... Oh, come here.

463
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:22,918
You are very beautiful.

464
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:25,318
And you are...

465
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:29,917
and you are very...

466
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:39,320
Listen, why don't you take some time,
take all the time you need,

467
00:46:39,407 --> 00:46:42,001
and, you know, you can stay here...

468
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:00,244
OK. All right.
We'll be home in a half an hour.

469
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:02,363
All right. Bye.

470
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:04,358
lt's OK. You can stay with us.

471
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,359
Every time we have a break, he comes...

472
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:13,441
You ladies have a full evening planned?
Huh? Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll?

473
00:47:13,527 --> 00:47:17,645
- Pat's a delinquent.
- Pat's a delinquent.

474
00:47:17,727 --> 00:47:20,480
Do l detect a fellow fuck-up?

475
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:24,962
So l was lifting credit cards,
cos nobody ever checks that shit.

476
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:28,722
l'd buy some stuff, OK,
then l'd sell it for cash.

477
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:32,800
Yeah. l've done a bunch of fucked-up shit
that l'm not really proud of in my life,

478
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:36,675
but now l'm really trying to make it up
to the people l hurt, like my parents.

479
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:39,406
They're so fuckin' cool. Sorry...
But the fuckin' feds, OK,

480
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:42,604
bust my ass in Vegas because some chick
at the bank is supposed to tell the casino

481
00:47:42,687 --> 00:47:46,600
that l got some sort of line of credit set up,
but instead she fuckin' bones me.

482
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,236
Yeah. Can you believe that shit?
Excuse my fuckin' French.

483
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:54,718
But these motherfuckers - l'm sorry -
cuff me, haul my ass down to jail,

484
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:56,763
and my parents gotta fuckin' bail me out.

485
00:47:56,847 --> 00:47:59,998
Now let me tell you something:
you put that shit out there, it's comin' back.

486
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:02,885
You gotta set it straight. Seriously.
lt's like a boomerang.

487
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:06,960
Well, l've done some things.
Stole some things.

488
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:09,607
Yeah? Well, you just gotta try
and find a balance.

489
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:13,805
You see a hungry guy,
you give him some food. You know?

490
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:18,597
Now, if l gotta take something
from somebody, you know,

491
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,485
l just gotta try and find a way
to give something back.

492
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:23,922
lt's a give-and-take sort of thing.

493
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:26,760
Yeah. l was trying to go to Florida.

494
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:28,565
You goin' with my folks?

495
00:48:28,647 --> 00:48:32,356
No. No, l was trying to get the money
so l could take a bus.

496
00:48:32,447 --> 00:48:35,086
You ever been on a bus before? Huh?

497
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:40,799
You'll sit beside some fat fuckin' bast...
Sorry, some fat guy, OK, for 1 4 hours.

498
00:48:40,887 --> 00:48:44,436
Forget about it. l'll take you up.
l'm headin' down to the Bahamas, so...

499
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:46,165
When do you need to go?

500
00:48:46,247 --> 00:48:48,966
Well, l have this thing, this contest,
in a couple of days.

501
00:48:49,047 --> 00:48:50,685
OK. l'll take you.

502
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:53,361
l don't have any money,
but l could share the driving.

503
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:55,836
Don't worry about it, OK?

504

Good job, partner.
Let's go to the bank.

521
00:50:21,887 --> 00:50:26,039
The day l started GA, some dude
says to me ''Goin' straight takes balls.''

522
00:50:26,127 --> 00:50:28,163
So l got me some.

All right. Good night.

540
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:39,922
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Last night.

541
00:53:40,007 --> 00:53:44,683
Did he give you any indication
as to where he was going?

542
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:46,519
No.

543
00:53:46,607 --> 00:53:51,920
So just the jewellery, coins and the car.
Anything else?

544
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:54,558
Some silver.

545
00:53:56,887 --> 00:53:59,321
- My stupid idiot brother!
- What happened?

546
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:01,921
He skipped his parole.

547
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:04,726
- So maybe he's gonna come back.
- He's not coming back!

548
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:09,403
He took my dad's watch collection
and my mother's heirloom silver.

549
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:11,603
What time are you guys
going to the airport?

550
00:54:11,687 --> 00:54:13,837
We're not going.

551
00:55:07,327 --> 00:55:10,444
l'll give you $ 75.
That's with the jacket and the bike.

552
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:12,199
That's a diamond.

553
00:55:12,287 --> 00:55:16,485
Yeah, but see that little brown spot?
That ain't worth nothin'.

554
00:55:56,287 --> 00:55:57,800
Just a Coke.

- When did you get here?
- Just last night.

575
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:04,163
Well, you missed
the gala opening-night festivities.

00:59:04,887 --> 00:59:07,037
l missed seeing you there.

577
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:14,356
- You don't like the sun?
- l like it too much.

578
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:19,562
Your wife seems nice.

579
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:21,638
She can be.

580
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:26,723
- You little wimpy boy!
- lt's fucking freezing!

581
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:29,037

584
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:44,046
Here. Why don't you and Meg go in search
of drinks? And Meg can change.

585
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:19,443
Let the relaxation begin.
Who wants to play a game?

586
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:22,758
- Are you gonna cheat, like you always do?
- Oh, l never cheat.

587
01:00:22,847 --> 01:00:27,602
l have never cheated in my life.
l am constitutionally incapable of cheating.

588
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,962
- Of course, l am a sore loser.
- Yeah.

589
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:32,083
But that's different.

590
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:36,876
So what kind of things do you write?

591
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,798

593
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:44,287

595
01:00:48,967 --> 01:00:51,879
Oh, l'm sorry. You're her teacher.

01:00:54,447 --> 01:00:59,077
Well, l'm sure Meg would like
to go swimming with you, darling.

597
01:01:12,687 --> 01:01:14,837
Would you like me to walk you home?

598
01:01:14,927 --> 01:01:16,440

Bravo.

613

Your wife seems really smart.

614
01:02:50,247 --> 01:02:52,442
She is.

615
01:02:52,527 --> 01:02:55,246
She's also extremely unhappy.

616
01:02:57,407 --> 01:03:00,604
We've known each other for a long time.

617
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:04,479
Well, since we were children really.

618
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:06,637
Younger than you.

619
01:03:09,727 --> 01:03:12,605
Does that make you feel uncomfortable?

620
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:14,405
No.

621
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:18,605
You should put this sweater on.
You look cold.

622

A tie?

633
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:27,677
You probably don't even wear ties.

634
01:04:41,527 --> 01:04:43,518

635
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:47,283

- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

648
01:07:18,287 --> 01:07:20,676
Do you want me?

649
01:07:22,287 --> 01:07:24,403
Do you want me?

650
01:07:27,687 --> 01:07:30,360
Say yes. Say yes.

651

Oh, come on...

654
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,557
Do you need me to walk you home?

655
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:10,638
No, it's OK.

656
01:10:16,127 --> 01:10:18,595
What's your book about?

657
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:25,117
lt's about an old man
who falls for a young girl.

658
01:10:26,367 --> 01:10:28,244
Really?

659
01:10:29,207 --> 01:10:31,323
You don't believe me?

660
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:34,164
How does it end?

661
01:10:38,647 --> 01:10:42,162
They make love and he is transformed.

Make me proud tomorrow.

663
01:10:47,927 --> 01:10:50,600
No. Strike that.

Make yourself proud.
And fame and fortune will follow.

665
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:13,160
- Night, Debbie.

666
01:11:16,727 --> 01:11:20,117

No, thanks. l'm fine.

668
01:11:22,007 --> 01:11:26,876
Hey, Ricky! Make me some pancakes,

- Do you like bacon?
- lt's OK. l'm not hungry.

672
01:11:43,247 --> 01:11:47,525

677
01:12:42,127 --> 01:12:46,598
''So do not look up to me, my friend,
for now l realise

678
01:12:46,687 --> 01:12:51,283
That growing up is nothing more
than knowing your own size.''

679
01:13:18,767 --> 01:13:20,758
This poem...

680
01:13:23,367 --> 01:13:25,483
po-em...

681
01:13:26,247 --> 01:13:28,761
is for Mr Auster.

682
01:13:30,487 --> 01:13:33,763
lt's called ''Now That l've Read Your Book''.

683
01:13:34,527 --> 01:13:38,839
''l've memorised the lines.
lt was easy.''

684
01:13:38,927 --> 01:13:43,000
''The dirty white pages,
a margin of fancy designs.''

685
01:13:43,927 --> 01:13:46,805
''You draw outlines of inverted hearts.''

686
01:13:46,887 --> 01:13:50,084
''But mine's real, not a valentine.''

687
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:56,081
''As for the details...''

688
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:11,325
''As for the details,
fiction, fiction, lies, lies,

689
01:14:11,407 --> 01:14:14,399
l am the coming poet who will arise.''

690
01:14:15,047 --> 01:14:18,960
''Crippled phoenix,
l fly up from your bed of ashes.''

691
01:14:19,047 --> 01:14:25,361
''When my dad left, l cut off my hands
and sewed up my eyes.''

692
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:30,240
''But that didn't keep me
from reaching for you.''

693
01:14:30,327 --> 01:14:34,639
''Thank you for the gold star
and your leaving.''

694
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:37,446
''Blue car, gold star.''

695
01:14:38,367 --> 01:14:42,804
''The leaving is a gift
l will always hang on to.''

696
01:15:53,327 --> 01:15:55,318
This is it.

697
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:30,006
Hi. ls my dad there?

698
01:16:31,727 --> 01:16:33,558
Hello?

699
01:16:33,647 --> 01:16:38,482
Hi, Dad. lt's Meg.

700
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,961
l called Dad.

701
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:58,924
l know.

702
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:03,164
Maybe it'll be better for a while.

703
01:17:04,207 --> 01:17:06,437
l'm sorry.

704
01:17:07,847 --> 01:17:10,156
Me too.

705
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:43,043
l know he's not perfect,
but l need him too.

706
01:19:03,087 --> 01:19:04,805
That it?

707
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:06,605
Yeah.

708
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:13,883
Do you remember when we drove
into the country that one time?

709
01:19:13,967 --> 01:19:17,357
To the place where they sell penny candy?

710
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:21,359
And it was you, me, Lily and Mom.

711
01:19:23,207 --> 01:19:29,396
And we were driving over the bumps on
the road so fast it felt like we were flying.

712
01:19:31,607 --> 01:19:33,802
l like this car.

713
01:19:39,047 --> 01:19:41,845
This old car likes you, too.
