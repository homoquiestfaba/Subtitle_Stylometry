1
00:00:01,504 --> 00:00:04,234
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

2
00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:07,968
<i>She doesn't need a crown</i>

3
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:11,211
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

4
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:15,342
<i>She'll turn the world around</i>

5
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:22,684
<i>You can see it in her style</i>

6
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:26,389
<i>You can see it in her smile</i>

7
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:30,098
<i>You can see it in her flair</i>

8
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:33,830
<i>And the way she wears her hair</i>

9
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,601
<i>Spinning</i>

10
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:40,665
<i>Twirling</i>

11
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:42,074
<i>Girly</i>

12
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:44,874
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

13
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:48,516
<i>She doesn't need a crown</i>

14
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:51,753
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

15
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:56,381
<i>She'll turn the world around</i>

16
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:04,425
<i>Her shoulders are back
Na, na, na</i>

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,129
<i>You'll never see her slack
No, no, no</i>

18
00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:11,731
<i>And even if she falls
Na, na, na</i>

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,298
<i>She'll laugh and stand up tall
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

20
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:19,177
<i>You can tell she's a princess
Yeah, yeah</i>

21
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:22,740
<i>She doesn't need a crown
No, no</i>

22
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:26,584
<i>You can tell she's a princess
Yeah, yeah</i>

23
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:30,250
<i>She'll turn the world around
Yeah, yeah</i>

24
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,399
<i>But the secret to her majesty</i>

25
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:43,094
<i>That sets the girl apart</i>

26
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:47,740
<i>Is the kindness
that shows royalty</i>

27
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,473
<i>It's etched upon her heart</i>

28
00:01:58,687 --> 00:01:59,915
<i>And welcome back!</i>

29
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,957
<i>Andrea and I are
thrilled to be here</i>

30
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:06,290
<i>bringing you the 144th
Princess Procession!</i>

31
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:10,093
<i>That's right, Phil! And where
are those princesses processing?</i>

32
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:11,564
<i>Glad you
asked, Andrea.</i>

33
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:14,159
<i>Why, to Princess
Charm School, of course,</i>

34
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:18,366
<i>"Where Glorious Girls
Meet Dreams Of Destiny!"</i>

35
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,074
<i>Emily!</i>

36
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:24,175
<i>I hope you're doing your homework
and not just watching that parade!</i>

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,269
I am, Mom!

38
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:29,249
<i>Yes, every girl dreams it,
but only a few can achieve it.</i>

39
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:33,084
<i>For those born to royalty
from kingdoms far and wide,</i>

40
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:37,189
<i>a chance to earn their
titles as princesses.</i>

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,021
<i>And for
those born commoners,</i>

42
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,621
<i>the opportunity to win a place as
a princess' most trusted advisor,</i>

43
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,632
<i>a lady royal!</i>

44
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:47,095
Boo!

45
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,268
<i>Blair! You're here!</i>

46
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,074
<i>Dance with me,
Princess Emily.</i>

47
00:02:57,313 --> 00:03:00,544
<i>Oh, Phil, it's a beautiful
day here in Gardania,</i>

48
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:03,449
<i>I've never seen so many
people for the parade!</i>

49
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:07,555
<i>I know, Andrea. You couldn't be
more right. It's a lovely day,</i>

50
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:09,853
<i>everybody's having
a wonderful time...</i>

51
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:16,523
<i>You'll hurt your
eyes looking at this.</i>

52
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,359
Let me get your tiara,
Princess Blair.

53
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:22,932
I am so
not a princess.

54
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:26,207
<i>...costumes are magnificent.
They are indeed, Phil.</i>

55
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,833
<i>Every girl's a princess.</i>

56
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,276
Some of them just
have fancier crowns.

57
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:33,110
<i>Fuchsia.
It's just adorable.</i>

58
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:34,649
<i>Mom okay?</i>

59
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,748
<i>Kind of. The doctor says
she's comfortable.</i>

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,314
Comfortable.

61
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:41,254
She should be all better.

62
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,385
<i>She'll get
there, though.</i>

63
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,017
I just have to
keep working.

64
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:48,495
Then we can afford our own
little house in a better area.

65
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:50,392
<i>With better
doctors for Mom?</i>

66
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:53,057
Mmm-hmm, and a better
place for you to grow up.

67
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:56,334
Some place right out of
the pictures you draw.

68
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,134
Blair?

69
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,938
Hi, Mom! I brought
you a blueberry scone.

70
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,302
Oh, thank you.

71
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,180
<i>It's the least I can do.</i>

72
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:09,307
<i>It's time!
It's time! It's time!</i>

73
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:11,580
<i>It's Princess Charm
School lottery time!</i>

74
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:13,177
<i>We have to watch!</i>

75
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,228
<i>And now we'll hear from
Headmistress Alexandra Privet.</i>

76
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:32,497
<i>At Princess Charm School,</i>

77
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:36,340
<i>those born to the royal life
unlock their princess potential.</i>

78
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:40,471
<i>Yet every year, one
regular citizen of Gardania</i>

79
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:43,245
<i>wins a full scholarship
to the school,</i>

80
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:45,912
<i>with a chance to
become a lady royal</i>

81
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:48,115
<i>and change
her life forever.</i>

82
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:50,050
<i>Will it be you?</i>

83
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:53,359
Oh, I hope,
I hope, I hope.

84
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:54,691
Did I mention I hope?

85
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:58,130
<i>When you're old enough
you'll enter. I promise.</i>

86
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:00,958
<i>To choose this year's
lottery winner,</i>

87
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:03,869
<i>I present Miss
Delancy Devin.</i>

88
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:13,114
<i>You of course mean
Princess Delancy Devin.</i>

89
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:16,409
<i>My daughter will soon
be ruler of Gardania.</i>

90
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:21,646
Provided she successfully
completes the semester.

91
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,257
Miss Delancy?

92
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:48,274
<i>Blair Willows.</i>

93
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:50,442
<i>And there
you have it!</i>

94
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,817
<i>Blair Willows! This year's
winner... Yes! I knew it!</i>

95
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:55,083
<i>Woo-hoo!
What? But...</i>

96
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,988
<i>Who's a lady royal?
Blair's a lady royal!</i>

97
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,119
<i>Emily, that's not possible.
Who works in the palace?</i>

98
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:01,662
Blair works in the palace!

99
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,357
Uh-huh, go Blair!
I never even...

100
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,831
Uh-huh, go Blair!

101
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,566
You
entered for me?

102
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:09,900
Only five or six times.

103
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:12,566
A day. For an entire year.

104
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,866
<i>Who's gonna be a lady royal?</i>

105
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,843
<i>Blair's gonna be a lady royal! Emily!</i>

106
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:19,073
<i>They're here?</i>

107
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:20,614
<i>They're really here!</i>

108
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,041
Mom?

109
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:30,390
<i>Blair Willows?</i>

110
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:38,957
<i>Congratulations. I'm here to
take you to Princess Charm School.</i>

111
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:41,563
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

112
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:43,002
<i>There's been a mistake.</i>

113
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,369
<i>I'm not going to
Princess Charm School.</i>

114
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:46,838
<i>Yes, you are!</i>

115
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:51,203
<i>Emily, I don't belong with a bunch
of princesses and lady royals.</i>

116
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,814
<i>Look at me!
I'm a waitress!</i>

117
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:57,213
<i>I've got straws in my pocket
and ketchup on my socks.</i>

118
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,111
You look perfect.

119
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:02,520
<i>Thank you. But the girls
there won't think so.</i>

120
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,957
And I have
responsibilities here.

121
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:09,328
<i>Blair, it wasn't right of
Emily to go behind your back,</i>

122
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:11,559
but this is a
big opportunity.

123
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:14,093
A position as
a lady royal?

124
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:19,029
<i>Would change
our lives forever.</i>

125
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,368
<i>I'll go.</i>

126
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,009
Yes!

127
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:37,023
<i>Wow, you get to
ride in a carriage!</i>

128
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:41,422
<i>It's time to go.
Now?</i>

129
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:42,587
Now.

130
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:45,462
<i>Uh... Just let me pull
together some clothes and I...</i>

131
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,297
<i>It's all at
the school.</i>

132
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,963
<i>We need to leave now, or
you forfeit your scholarship.</i>

133
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:51,369
But what about my...

134
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,499
Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock.

135
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:57,239
I love you.

136
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:02,613
<i>I won't let you down.</i>

137
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:04,644
<i>Blair!</i>

138
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:21,831
<i>Blair!</i>

139
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,738
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

140
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,637
<i>Bye, Mom!
Bye, Emily!</i>

141
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:36,348
Goodbye, Blair!

142
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,882
<i>You'll always be my princess.</i>

143
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:14,654
Ah! Great!

144
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:18,424
<i>I've already flunked
carriage riding.</i>

145
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:29,266
<i>Whoa.</i>

146
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:49,120
Thanks for the ride.

147
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,521
Uh, hey, I wonder if
you could maybe show me...

148
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,085
Oh.

149
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:55,620
Or not.

150
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:25,023
Ooh!
Hey!

151
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:26,390
Pardon me.

152
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:44,707
You scared me!

153
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,912
<i>Aww, it's okay.
You're a good dog.</i>

154
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,553
<i>"Prince. "</i>

155
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:55,782
Good boy, Prince.

156
00:10:56,758 --> 00:10:59,454
<i>Hmm. You must
be Blair Willows.</i>

157
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:03,994
<i>We don't usually find our future
lady royals sprawled on the floor.</i>

158
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:06,295
Oh! Um, hi.

159
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:08,369
Sorry about the floor.

160
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:10,631
<i>He's just...
He's very sweet.</i>

161
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:13,398
<i>Not usually.
He's normally quite shy.</i>

162
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,743
Go lie down, Prince.

163
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,713
I am Headmistress Privet.

164
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:21,373
<i>Welcome to
Charm School.</i>

165
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,610
<i>Thank you.
It's really an honor.</i>

166
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,448
Shall I take you
to your locker?

167
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:30,117
Princess Charm School was
founded on the principles

168
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:33,992
of instilling young women
with character and confidence.

169
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:38,496
And it has been preparing them for
royal life for nearly five centuries.

170
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,099
<i>Wow.</i>

171
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,636
<i>Emily would love this.</i>

172
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:45,235
<i>She's always wanted
to come here.</i>

173
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:47,063
<i>Emily?</i>

174
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,540
<i>My little sister. She's the one
who entered me in the lottery.</i>

175
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:51,909
I never would
have come,

176
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,814
<i>but it's a chance to make a
better life for her and for my mom.</i>

177
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:57,273
Ah.

178
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:02,686
Blair, only 27% of the lottery
girls make it through to graduation.

179
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,619
Do you think
you can handle it?

180
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,426
<i>I think so. I'll sure try.</i>

181
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:11,495
<i>You'll notice that
all of our students</i>

182
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:15,627
carry themselves with dignity
and sophistication.

183
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:19,105
<i>Weekly
dress-up tea socials!</i>

184
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:22,871
Yes! And we can give each other
fun nicknames and swap shoes!

185
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:25,674
<i>Shh, ladies.</i>

186
00:12:27,983 --> 00:12:31,384
<i>Dress up tea socials in
our dorm room every week!</i>

187
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:35,986
This is the original
Princess Charm School.

188
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:38,150
The centuries-old castle.

189
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:42,458
Most classes and the student
dorms are in our new section.

190
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,191
Our world-class
amenities

191
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:47,235
include a state-of-the-art
digital classroom.

192
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:52,534
To your left, our
Olympic-sized ballroom.

193
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:57,275
And my personal favorite,
our luxurious spa.

194
00:12:57,345 --> 00:13:00,178
I do enjoy a good
mani-pedi from time to time.

195
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:02,307
<i>Blair Willows!
Ah. Here we are.</i>

196
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:03,612
<i>Blair Willows!</i>

197
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:05,710
<i>Anyone seen a
"Blair Willows"?</i>

198
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:11,552
<i>At your service, miss?</i>

199
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:13,392
This is Grace.

200
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:16,225
Your personal
princess assistant.

201
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:19,060
<i>Every student at Princess
Charm School has one.</i>

202
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:22,929
They are usually punctual,
and usually helpful.

203
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:27,336
I shall leave you in her...
Capable hands.

204
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,535
I am so sorry.

205
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:33,981
It was buttercream.

206
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:37,446
<i>Now if someone spills a pot roast
on me, I'll be a complete meal.</i>

207
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:41,488
I just wanted to give you the
traditional welcome cupcake.

208
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:44,554
You wanna change
clothes? Follow me.

209
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:53,560
It has everything a
princess student needs.

210
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:57,127
Books, pens, paper,
make-up mirrors,

211
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,469
sparkle purse
collection.

212
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,475
And of course
emergency pumps.

213
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:04,502
This is my locker?

214
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,874
<i>Then we've got
your beauty supplies.</i>

215
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:09,810
Jewel-encrusted hairbrush,
diamond lipstick.

216
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:12,110
Oh, I love this perfume! Ooh!

217
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:14,951
Ugh!

218
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:16,646
Ugh!

219
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,925
<i>I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.</i>

220
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:24,496
Um, Delancy?

221
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:28,732
<i>There's such a thing
as too much perfume.</i>

222
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:30,093
Portia!

223
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:31,929
<i>Oh, no, you're...</i>

224
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:34,771
<i>Furious, that's
what I am!</i>

225
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:36,367
How dare you?

226
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:38,844
<i>Look, Delancy. They're
serving floor cakes.</i>

227
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:41,174
I just got here.

228
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,006
You just got here?

229
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:45,152
Let me guess.

230
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,620
<i>Blair Willows,
the lottery girl?</i>

231
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,623
Yes! So you understand.

232
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:51,591
Oh, this is all so new to me, and I...

233
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,253
I understand the
lottery is a joke.

234
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:55,455
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

235
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:00,329
<i>Commoners like you
don't belong here.</i>

236
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:01,460
<i>Right, Portia?</i>

237
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:02,929
<i>What?</i>

238
00:15:03,338 --> 00:15:04,737
<i>Wickellia!</i>

239
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:08,503
<i>Yes, Your Wonderful...
Ness.</i>

240
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:11,306
I need a princess
pamper package, pronto!

241
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,439
Make way!
To the spa!

242
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:17,116
Uh, are you
taking orders?

243
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:20,484
Because I would do anything
for a double foam mocha latte.

244
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,349
The floorcake
was delicious.

245
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:23,550
<i>Portia!</i>

246
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,723
As you can see,
everyone here is so nice.

247
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,528
Most of the time.

248
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:36,031
<i>Uh, so let's get
you ready for school.</i>

249
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:40,465
Locker, please extend
curtain for a princess primp.

250
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,381
<i>Oh, it's fabulous!</i>

251
00:15:47,482 --> 00:15:49,882
The best thing about
Princess Charm School!

252
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:52,476
Go on. Get gorgeous!

253
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:14,002
Oh, pretty as a princess.

254
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,201
Lady royal.

255
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,975
<i>Okay, now your schedule
and let's get you settled.</i>

256
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,243
<i>I'd love to.</i>

257
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,158
<i>Wow.</i>

258
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,692
Hey! Our new roomie, right?

259
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:41,825
Princess or lady royal?

260
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:43,998
Lady royal. You?

261
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:46,100
Princess.
Isla, too.

262
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:48,234
Do you play?

263
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:00,845
<i>Nice.</i>

264
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:02,582
Oh!

265
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:04,919
<i>Oh! I'm so sorry!</i>

266
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:06,524
Are you kidding?

267
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:08,721
<i>Isla's been Miss
Mum's-The-Word about the tunes</i>

268
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:10,787
<i>and I've been
dying to hear them!</i>

269
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:12,957
<i>I'm still working
on them.</i>

270
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:15,166
<i>They're not ready
for anyone to hear.</i>

271
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,032
<i>Really? What I heard rocked.</i>

272
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:20,734
Yeah! See? Play one
of your tunes for us!

273
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,510
<i>That's okay. No rush.</i>

274
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,380
<i>I'm Hadley.
Blair.</i>

275
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:32,282
<i>Blair Willows?
The lottery winner?</i>

276
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,151
Is it that obvious?

277
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:37,023
<i>Yup, 'cause they
announced it on TV</i>

278
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:39,116
<i>that "Blair Willows"
was the lottery winner.</i>

279
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:42,092
Oh, right. Sorry.

280
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:44,395
<i>Guess I'm just a
little overwhelmed.</i>

281
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:47,357
<i>All princesses and
lady-royals-in-training</i>

282
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:49,733
<i>are due at the Starlight
Welcome in one minute.</i>

283
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,999
One minute?

284
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:55,405
<i>Whoa!</i>

285
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,144
<i>Welcome, students.</i>

286
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,046
<i>Oh!</i>

287
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:36,249
<i>And dogs.</i>

288
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:39,184
<i>Tonight you begin the greatest
challenge of your life,</i>

289
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:41,722
<i>training to be a
princess or lady royal,</i>

290
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,015
<i>the most important
jobs of the realm.</i>

291
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:49,461
<i>Your classmates, Lorraine and Josette,
are bringing around your training tiaras.</i>

292
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,690
Thank you.

293
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,894
<i>Don't get
too used to them.</i>

294
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:58,837
<i>Only those who succeed this
semester will earn the real versions.</i>

295
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:03,366
<i>Fail as a princess-in-training
and you will not be crowned.</i>

296
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,606
<i>We have very high
expectations here.</i>

297
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:10,584
<i>Each of you must attend every
class on time and in uniform,</i>

298
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:13,086
<i>and your grades must
be exceptional.</i>

299
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:18,323
<i>That said, I believe every one
of you has princess potential.</i>

300
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:21,928
<i>Work hard and
stay dedicated,</i>

301
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,987
<i>and you will achieve it.</i>

302
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,893
<i>I'm so sorry,
Dame Devin,</i>

303
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,460
<i>that's a nasty little
tickle there,</i>

304
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:32,062
would you like a
glass of water?

305
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,735
<i>I'd like a
proper introduction.</i>

306
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:36,476
<i>Certainly.</i>

307
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,069
Students.

308
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,245
Dame Devin.

309
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:48,251
<i>I have an earth-shattering
announcement.</i>

310
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:53,953
<i>This is my last semester
of teaching before I...</i>

311
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:58,321
<i>Um, before my daughter
takes over Gardania.</i>

312
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,559
<i>No, no, hold
back your tears.</i>

313
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:04,727
<i>Ms. Privet will take over
my classes next year.</i>

314
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,239
<i>In her own little way.</i>

315
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:09,333
<i>Of course, no one knows
the royal life as I do.</i>

316
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,877
<i>I've lived at the
palace ever since</i>

317
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:14,574
<i>my dear sister-in-law Queen
Isabella and her family died,</i>

318
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,278
<i>and it has been my
great... If they died...</i>

319
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,446
You know the legend?

320
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:21,314
<i>What legend?</i>

321
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:24,017
<i>There's a legend that
Queen Isabella and her family</i>

322
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,083
<i>didn't all die
in the accident.</i>

323
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,320
I love that you
know that story.

324
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:32,355
<i>...and so I welcome you all
to Princess Charm School.</i>

325
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,061
<i>May your time
here be magical.</i>

326
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,503
<i>Two lines, everyone!</i>

327
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:45,775
<i>Curtseys to all and then
everyone's excused for bed.</i>

328
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:53,477
<i>Favorite legend about
the Gardania Royal Family, go.</i>

329
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,116
<i>I don't know any
of the legends.</i>

330
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,717
So missing out.

331
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,352
Isla, go.

332
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:03,355
<i>My fave's a simple one.</i>

333
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:05,456
<i>Gardania's magical crown.</i>

334
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,626
<i>Gardania's magical
crown?</i>

335
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,636
<i>Ow!</i>

336
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:10,893
<i>Oh, no.</i>

337
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:13,240
Ugh! You again?

338
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:14,967
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

339
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,603
<i>What is with you?
You're a walking disaster!</i>

340
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:28,281
<i>I don't think Delancy and I
are going to hang out much.</i>

341
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,288
<i>That's okay, you'll be
hanging out with us.</i>

342
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:34,421
Better believe it. And wait
till classes start tomorrow.

343
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,827
I bet you can do
anything she can do.

344
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:40,797
Sure, I can do
anything she can do.

345
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,700
I cannot do
anything she can do.

346
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:55,977
Poise. Proper poise
commands respect,

347
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,416
a necessity for anyone
in the royal life.

348
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:01,487
Thank you, Delancy.

349
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,256
Now, princesses,
lady royals,

350
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:12,629
<i>let's see what
you can do, hmm.</i>

351
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,192
Start with one book
and glide, glide.

352
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,534
Smoothly, gracefully.

353
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,732
I can balance a tray of coffee
cups for customers, right?

354
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:26,210
<i>Of course, I've never
done it on my head.</i>

355
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:34,387
<i>Hadley, you're tenderizing
your brains. Stop.</i>

356
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:38,648
<i>That's lovely, Isla.</i>

357
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:40,216
Thank you,
Dame Devin.

358
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:44,230
If you want to be the crazy
princess who hears music in her head.

359
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:46,057
<i>Whoa!</i>

360
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:50,137
<i>Lorraine, you're practicing
poise, not lifting weights.</i>

361
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:54,969
Like a princess, Josette,
not a migrating duck.

362
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,202
Portia.

363
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,234
<i>What?</i>

364
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,973
<i>You're
doing fine.</i>

365
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:11,022
Come on. Come on!

366
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:13,016
<i>Do it for Emily.</i>

367
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:16,423
Did you get those
shoes at a garage sale?

368
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,504
Is it nap time?

369
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:28,132
How come
nobody told me?

370
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:32,138
<i>You. What do you have
to say for this disaster?</i>

371
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:35,675
It was an
accident, Dame Devin.

372
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,183
I was trying...
Stand up.

373
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:40,618
<i>You're the lottery
girl, aren't you?</i>

374
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:42,350
Yes, Dame Devin.

375
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:45,348
I should have known.
Meet my eyes, girl.

376
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,394
A true lady royal
never hangs her head.

377
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,905
Mother? You were going
to say something to Blair?

378
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,207
Yes!

379
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:12,252
You are utterly unfit
for the royal life!

380
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,345
<i>I want you out
of this class!</i>

381
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:16,913
You might also think about whether
someone from your station in life

382
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:21,553
<i>should even stay someplace where
you so clearly don't belong!</i>

383
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:23,925
I understand.

384
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:46,078
<i>They're serving
strawberry swirl today!</i>

385
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,218
Thank you, Miranda.

386
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:55,986
<i>Don't let Dame Devin bug you.</i>

387
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:58,964
<i>Legend has it she's
actually a reptile alien</i>

388
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,591
from the other side
of the universe.

389
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,638
You know what really
bugs me, Portia?

390
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:10,572
Yodeling hand puppets?

391
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:14,109
<i>When a commoner like Blair
comes to Princess Charm School,</i>

392
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:16,672
she makes it less special.

393
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:18,981
She makes us
less special.

394
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:20,042
She does?

395
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:21,917
She totally does.

396
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:23,957
Specialness is like
this piece of cake.

397
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,854
<i>There's only so
much to go around.</i>

398
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:29,395
If Blair takes a
huge chunk of it,

399
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,025
<i>what's left for us?</i>

400
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,233
You stole my cake!

401
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,391
Not me.

402
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:37,726
Blair!

403
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:41,901
How dare she!
I wanted that cake.

404
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,976
<i>Don't worry. I have
a feeling she won't</i>

405
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:46,445
be around to steal
cake much longer.

406
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:48,278
<i>Wickellia!</i>

407
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,078
<i>Yes, your
Royal Sneakiness?</i>

408
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:02,928
<i>So we're coming around showing
everyone our school spirit cheer.</i>

409
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:04,930
<i>'Cause when
you've got spirit,</i>

410
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:06,591
<i>it's what we
want to hear!</i>

411
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,802
Thanks, Lorraine. Josette.

412
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:11,369
<i>Yeah. That was cute.
Rhyming and all.</i>

413
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:12,867
<i>We'll see ya.</i>

414
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,841
<i>Oh, that wasn't the cheer.
Had to make that clear.</i>

415
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,377
<i>But don't you
ever fear.</i>

416
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,970
<i>'Cause the time
to cheer is here!</i>

417
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:21,344
One, two, three!

418
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,474
Princess Charm
School is the best!

419
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:25,485
<i>Royal skills put
to the test!</i>

420
00:26:25,553 --> 00:26:27,487
<i>We can dance and
we've got poise!</i>

421
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:29,580
<i>Now it's time to
make some noise!</i>

422
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:32,854
<i>Go, Princess Charm School!</i>

423
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:38,290
<i>Wow. Cool cheer.
Thanks for sharing.</i>

424
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:40,298
Part of caring!

425
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:43,693
You guys ready?

426
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,614
<i>I'm so sorry... I...</i>

427
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:05,058
I have to go.

428
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,359
Serves her right
for stealing my cake.

429
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:22,568
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

430
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,076
<i>I don't fit in
here at all.</i>

431
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:26,708
<i>I'm like a burp
in a symphony.</i>

432
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,439
You have to give
yourself more time.

433
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:32,276
<i>You're right.
With more time,</i>

434
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:34,446
maybe I could destroy
the whole school.

435
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:37,185
<i>No, Dame Devin's right,</i>

436
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:39,784
<i>I'm not Princess
Charm School material.</i>

437
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,223
Seriously? Blair.

438
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:44,992
Dame Devin was Princess
Charm School material.

439
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,395
<i>What do you mean?</i>

440
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:49,459
Oh, I know this story!

441
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:53,303
She was a lottery winner, but no
princess picked her to be a lady royal,

442
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:56,568
not even her sister-in-law,
Queen Isabella.

443
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,373
<i>Exactly. If Delancy weren't
in line for the throne,</i>

444
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:02,040
Dame Devin would be no more
special than anyone else.

445
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:03,808
<i>Wow.</i>

446
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:07,549
<i>But
it's not just her.</i>

447
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,987
<i>Everyone thinks I
don't belong here.</i>

448
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:13,582
<i>Everyone except you guys.</i>

449
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:20,033
<i>A little help,
please?</i>

450
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:25,195
Ooh, care package!

451
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:30,441
<i>It's for you from...
Emily Willows?</i>

452
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,210
<i>Emily? Really?</i>

453
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,789
<i>That's pretty.</i>

454
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:45,883
<i>Emily drew it.</i>

455
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,093
<i>She loved the story of me being
found on my mom's doorstep.</i>

456
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:52,258
I was only one.

457
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,400
<i>Mom adopted Emily
a few years later.</i>

458
00:28:57,671 --> 00:28:59,468
<i>They're everything
to me.</i>

459
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:05,975
<i>One-two-three,
one-two-three,</i>

460
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:08,479
one-two-three,
one-two-three,

461
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,813
one-two-three,
one-two-three,

462
00:29:10,885 --> 00:29:13,410
and one-two-three,
one-two-three,

463
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,081
one-two-three,
one-two-three... Ow.

464
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:19,216
<i>Again, Blair?</i>

465
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,325
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

466
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:23,590
<i>You've stepped on
eight of my toes!</i>

467
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:25,323
I only have four left!

468
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:28,065
Two. You have two left.

469
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:31,596
<i>That's even worse!</i>

470
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:37,469
Thank you, everyone.
See you tomorrow.

471
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,711
Not you, Blair.

472
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:42,579
<i>I'd like to see
you after class.</i>

473
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,016
<i>Well, isn't
that a surprise?</i>

474
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:52,882
<i>Is...
Is everything okay?</i>

475
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,089
<i>No, it's not, Blair.</i>

476
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:58,529
Yesterday Dame Devin
recommended we expel you.

477
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,525
Oh.

478
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,233
<i>I can't say I blame her.</i>

479
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,771
<i>I know it's only been a
couple of days, but honestly,</i>

480
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:06,931
<i>I don't think
I have ever seen</i>

481
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,976
such a disaster of a student
come through these halls.

482
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:11,972
I see.

483
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:14,612
Tell you the truth,
I was almost going to do it.

484
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:18,610
<i>Did you say "almost"?</i>

485
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,177
<i>Almost.</i>

486
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:23,788
Do you know what it
takes to make a princess?

487
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:27,018
A crown?
No, not a crown.

488
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:28,856
Character.

489
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:33,556
All our classes in
poise, manners, dancing,

490
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:35,465
<i>they're not superficial.</i>

491
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:37,401
They build confidence.

492
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:41,038
But confidence without
character is dangerous.

493
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:43,770
You, Blair, have
a different problem.

494
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:46,235
Character without
confidence.

495
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:49,680
So you are going
to expel me?

496
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,481
<i>I'm going to tutor you.</i>

497
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:57,756
If you can dig deep and
find the princess inside you,

498
00:30:57,825 --> 00:30:59,725
<i>I have no doubt
you'll graduate</i>

499
00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:02,421
with your pick of any
lady royal position.

500
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:04,557
If you can
handle it.

501
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:06,565
Now, what
do you say?

502
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:08,995
Yes!

503
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:10,192
Ooh!

504
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,700
Uh, rule number one,
no hugging the tutor.

505
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:17,173
<i>Sorry. I just...
When do we start?</i>

506
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:19,240
<i>Right now.</i>

507
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:24,579
I can do this because I
am perfectly comfortable

508
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:27,677
and at ease with myself and in my body.

509
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:30,783
<i>That's because you're not
surrounded by people</i>

510
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:32,917
who make you feel like
a complete nothing.

511
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,687
No one can make you feel
inferior without your consent.

512
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:38,997
<i>Right. Your turn.</i>

513
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:42,724
<i>Headmistress Privet,
there's no way I can do this.</i>

514
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:45,430
<i>Not if you don't
believe you can.</i>

515
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:47,200
<i>We start small.</i>

516
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:54,012
Thirty seconds,
right here on the ground.

517
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:58,708
<i>That's right.
Just like that.</i>

518
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:01,750
<i>I can't.
I can't do it.</i>

519
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:02,982
Yeah, of course
you can...

520
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,952
<i>Right. I see we have our
work cut out for us.</i>

521
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,574
<i>I don't have the balance</i>

522
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,784
<i>Think I'm gonna fall</i>

523
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:33,576
<i>Wish I had the talent</i>

524
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,854
<i>I don't belong here at all</i>

525
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:51,070
<i>Drowning in the pressure</i>

526
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:52,838
<i>In over my head</i>

527
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:56,437
<i>Why did I think
I could do this</i>

528
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,910
<i>I could have
walked away instead</i>

529
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:01,909
<i>This is my chance
to break free</i>

530
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,712
<i>Everything's depending on me</i>

531
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:07,549
<i>And if I keep trying I'll be</i>

532
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:10,784
<i>On top of the world</i>

533
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:15,386
<i>Where I can see
everything before me</i>

534
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:18,863
<i>Reaching up to
touch the sky</i>

535
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:22,424
<i>On top of the world</i>

536
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:26,667
<i>All my dreams are
rushing toward me</i>

537
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,141
<i>Stretching out my wings to fly</i>

538
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,179
<i>On top of the world</i>

539
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:39,084
<i>On top of the world</i>

540
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:47,188
<i>Nothing's gonna break me</i>

541
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,328
<i>Gonna get it right</i>

542
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:55,158
<i>Even if it takes me
doing it a thousand times</i>

543
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:58,170
<i>Trying once is easy</i>

544
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:01,004
<i>Discipline is hard</i>

545
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,473
<i>But nothing can defeat me</i>

546
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:06,878
<i>If the change is in my heart</i>

547
00:34:06,947 --> 00:34:09,711
<i>This is my chance to break
free This is my chance</i>

548
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:12,479
<i>Everything's depending on me
On me</i>

549
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:15,386
<i>And if I keep trying I'll be
I'll be</i>

550
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:18,515
<i>On top of the world</i>

551
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:22,790
<i>Where I can see
everything before me</i>

552
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,591
<i>Stretching out my wings to fly</i>

553
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,727
<i>On top of the world</i>

554
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:37,300
I need two rows. Ladies on the
pink line, gentlemen on the blue.

555
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:41,781
<i>Welcome, everyone,
to our joint dance class</i>

556
00:34:41,848 --> 00:34:43,611
with Prince
Charming Academy.

557
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,983
If we could keep the
shrieking to a minimum,

558
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:50,990
it would be much
appreciated.

559
00:34:51,825 --> 00:34:54,658
<i>Hmm, it looks like
we'll have one extra lady.</i>

560
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:58,321
<i>Delancy, that's
the pink line.</i>

561
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,227
<i>I just don't see
Prince Nicholas.</i>

562
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:03,098
<i>He's the one I
want to dance with.</i>

563
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,360
<i>Maybe he's invisible.</i>

564
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:08,602
No daughter of mine sits
on the sidelines at a dance.

565
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:10,006
But, Mother...

566
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:14,238
<i>Looks like you're going to have
to sit out this one, dear. Pity.</i>

567
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:18,483
<i>All right, everyone's
paired up! Let's begin!</i>

568
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:22,548
Ugh.

569
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,224
Okay, come along.
Gentlemen, please bow.

570
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:30,854
Ladies, will you curtsey.

571
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:38,128
<i>Sorry I'm late...</i>

572
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:40,536
<i>Oh, no! I'm so sorry.</i>

573
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:42,608
<i>It's okay.</i>

574
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,945
<i>No, it's not.
I feel awful. Please.</i>

575
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,343
Thank you.

576
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:55,477
<i>Whoa.</i>

577
00:35:55,722 --> 00:35:57,747
<i>Sorry. I didn't
mean to be late.</i>

578
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:02,195
<i>That's fine. The two of you can
partner up and join the dance.</i>

579
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,799
<i>Now, gentlemen, lightly kiss
the top of your partner's hand...</i>

580
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:09,359
And dance.

581
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:16,136
Milady, I am Nicholas,
young swain from the east,

582
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:18,507
most privileged to
make your acquaintance.

583
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,769
Think that was
polite enough?

584
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:22,212
Absolutely.

585
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:23,849
Think you can top it?

586
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:28,845
I, kind swain, am Blair,
maiden of Gardania,

587
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:32,824
honored above all to be
welcomed into your swaininess.

588
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,518
<i>Well done.
I try.</i>

589
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:43,161
<i>Wonderful, everyone!</i>

590
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,825
<i>Wonderful, now a final bow
and curtsey to your partners,</i>

591
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,562
and we say our farewells
to the young gentlemen

592
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:51,331
of Prince
Charming Academy.

593
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:55,567
Keeping in mind that
you will see them again

594
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:58,805
at the Coronation Day ceremony
at the end of the school year.

595
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,006
I shall count the
moments till then.

596
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,948
As will I, good sir.

597
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:19,696
<i>I have an
exciting announcement.</i>

598
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:24,265
Thanks to the generosity
of Dame Devin,

599
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:28,467
dinner tonight will be a chance for
you to get a taste of your future.

600
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:31,441
Our manners class
served in the palace.

601
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:34,969
Yes! Sweet!
No way!

602
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:38,776
The palace! Can you
even imagine it?

603
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:42,287
I grew up in the palace,
Portia. I live there.

604
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:43,545
Oh.

605
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:46,816
But can you imagine it?

606
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,824
<i>To prepare for this event,
you'll all have the afternoon</i>

607
00:38:50,897 --> 00:38:53,331
to pamper yourselves
in the spa.

608
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,830
Your princess assistants

609
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:59,264
will help you take advantage
of all the amenities.

610
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:00,666
<i>Enjoy.</i>

611
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:08,841
<i>Wickellia.</i>

612
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:18,348
<i>Whoa!</i>

613
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:30,993
<i>Top thing you've always
wanted to see in the palace</i>

614
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:33,164
<i>that you can't
wait to see.</i>

615
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,571
Blair, go.

616
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:38,171
<i>Hmm, I've never thought
about the palace,</i>

617
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:39,644
<i>but Emily would
go nuts for it.</i>

618
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:43,449
I want to remember everything
so I can tell her.

619
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:46,142
Manicure time!

620
00:39:48,321 --> 00:39:50,255
Nice. Isla, go.

621
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,549
<i>I'd love to find out more
about what happened</i>

622
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:55,322
to Queen Isabella
and her family.

623
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:57,228
<i>They're so mysterious.</i>

624
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:02,995
<i>So true. I want to find out more
about Gardania's magical crown.</i>

625
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,466
Isla mentioned that before.

626
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:07,339
<i>Emily would
love that story.</i>

627
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:09,099
Oh! Tell her the legend.

628
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:14,078
<i>It's said that the crown glows when
placed on the true heir of Gardania.</i>

629
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:17,449
<i>It lit up on Queen Isabella's
head at her coronation,</i>

630
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:20,150
<i>but it hasn't been
seen since then.</i>

631
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:24,820
All done!

632
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:27,183
These are beautiful.

633
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:29,158
<i>Thanks.</i>

634
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:31,991
<i>We should go.</i>

635
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,828
The earlier we get to the
palace, the more we can see.

636
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,436
<i>Our uniforms.</i>

637
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:53,715
<i>Every one is in shreds!</i>

638
00:40:56,222 --> 00:40:57,780
<i>What are we going to do?</i>

639
00:40:57,857 --> 00:41:00,655
<i>We're not allowed in class
without our uniforms.</i>

640
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:03,426
And if we skip a class,
we get an F.

641
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:05,562
<i>We can't fail!</i>

642
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:08,426
Coronation Day
is two days away!

643
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,461
How could this happen?

644
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:15,099
Seriously? It was Delancy. It had to be.

645
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:17,833
<i>She's the queen of
"Make Blair Feel Inferior. "</i>

646
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:20,002
<i>No. She's not.</i>

647
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,907
No one can make you
feel inferior.

648
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:24,873
Not without your consent.

649
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,877
<i>We're princesses, right?</i>

650
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:29,982
<i>We don't even have
our crowns yet.</i>

651
00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:31,346
And you...

652
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:35,525
<i>I'm not talking about crowns.
I'm talking about character.</i>

653
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:39,656
The rule is we have to show
up to class in uniform, right?

654
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:42,829
<i>Currently they're
a little too breezy.</i>

655
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,071
Hmm. They just need
a little alteration.

656
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:50,175
Grace! Caprice! Harmony!

657
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,139
<i>Won't that
make them breezier?</i>

658
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:13,360
Hmm. It seems Blair, Hadley,
and Isla are running late.

659
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:15,534
<i>I do hope they're
not skipping class.</i>

660
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:18,571
<i>I'd hate to fail anyone
so close to Coronation Day.</i>

661
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:21,938
<i>Well, time's up.</i>

662
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:23,936
Oh, come now,
Dame Devin.

663
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:26,711
I think we can wait
a few minutes more.

664
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:28,703
And keep the
other students waiting?

665
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:30,113
That hardly seems fair.

666
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,309
<i>I'm afraid we'll have to
fail all three of them.</i>

667
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:33,374
<i>Wait!</i>

668
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,689
<i>What do you think
you're wearing?</i>

669
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:39,418
<i>Those aren't school-issued
uniforms.</i>

670
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:42,525
Forgive me, madam,
but they are, in fact,

671
00:42:42,629 --> 00:42:45,359
made entirely from the material
in our original uniforms.

672
00:42:45,765 --> 00:42:47,562
<i>But that's against the rules.</i>

673
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:51,967
<i>Actually, Dame Devin, there is nothing in
the dress code against what they've done.</i>

674
00:42:52,272 --> 00:42:55,639
<i>Right. We just used some hard work
to unlock our princess potential.</i>

675
00:42:56,342 --> 00:42:58,242
<i>And beautifully, at that.</i>

676
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:00,035
Come, join the class.

677
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:20,857
<i>Awesome!</i>

678
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:24,294
<i>Where did you get
new uniforms?</i>

679
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:26,302
Those are amazing!

680
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:27,463
<i>We made them.</i>

681
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:29,132
Blair made them.

682
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,068
How did you do that?

683
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:34,076
I want one.

684
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:36,708
<i>I didn't know
people made clothes.</i>

685
00:43:37,217 --> 00:43:40,516
I thought they came from
elves. You know, like toast.

686
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:42,954
<i>Attention, everyone.</i>

687
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:46,654
<i>Welcome to the royal
palace of Gardania.</i>

688
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:51,019
As a special treat you will
have some time before the meal

689
00:43:51,231 --> 00:43:53,927
to explore the first
floor of the palace.

690
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:56,366
<i>Enjoy!</i>

691
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,798
<i>Sweet. Royal secrets,
here we come!</i>

692
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:09,247
No way.

693
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:12,545
<i>Blair. It's a
picture of Blair.</i>

694
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:15,444
<i>That's not possible.</i>

695
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:17,549
<i>Why would there be
a portrait of me?</i>

696
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:23,262
<i>"Princess Isabella, age 18."</i>

697
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:33,828
That dog.

698
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:35,665
<i>It couldn't be!</i>

699
00:44:37,243 --> 00:44:39,541
<i>"Queen Isabella,
King Reginald,</i>

700
00:44:40,046 --> 00:44:42,981
<i>"the Princess Sophia,
and their loyal dog,</i>

701
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:45,043
<i>"Prince. "</i>

702
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:46,917
No way!

703
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:50,546
Blair? Do you know when your
mom found you on her doorstep?

704
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:51,950
The date? Sure.

705
00:44:52,325 --> 00:44:54,657
<i>I mean, she made it my birthday
since she didn't know my real one.</i>

706
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:56,155
April 26th.

707
00:44:58,398 --> 00:44:59,490
<i>What?</i>

708
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:03,596
<i>Blair, you know what
April 26th is, don't you?</i>

709
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:05,937
<i>Um, yeah.</i>

710
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:08,868
My birthday.
I just said that.

711
00:45:09,676 --> 00:45:12,304
<i>It's the day the royal
family died in that car crash.</i>

712
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:17,844
<i>I'm thinking maybe baby Sophia
didn't die in that crash.</i>

713
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:21,609
<i>Maybe she was found and
left on someone's doorstep.</i>

714
00:45:22,288 --> 00:45:23,312
No!

715
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,217
Yes, look at the portrait.

716
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:27,519
You look exactly
like Queen Isabella!

717
00:45:27,827 --> 00:45:29,727
You could be
baby Sophia.

718
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:33,498
<i>If it's true, and Dame Devin
and Delancy know it,</i>

719
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:36,062
<i>that would explain why
they're so awful to you,</i>

720
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:40,002
<i>because you're the rightful heir
to the throne, and not Delancy!</i>

721
00:45:43,376 --> 00:45:44,604
Okay.

722
00:45:44,811 --> 00:45:47,143
<i>That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.</i>

723
00:45:49,515 --> 00:45:51,176
<i>Dinner time!
We've gotta go.</i>

724
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:54,385
<i>This is serious,
you know.</i>

725
00:45:54,854 --> 00:45:57,015
The whole fate of
Gardania is at stake.

726
00:45:57,724 --> 00:46:00,192
<i>Come on, you guys.
It's crazy.</i>

727
00:46:21,314 --> 00:46:22,576
<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>

728
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:30,978
<i>Excuse me!</i>

729
00:46:32,225 --> 00:46:36,685
<i>My daughter has a declaration about how she'll
handle things when she's crowned princess</i>

730
00:46:36,896 --> 00:46:38,158
in two days.

731
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:39,253
Delancy!

732
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,624
Huh?

733
00:46:41,901 --> 00:46:43,027
I, um...

734
00:46:43,536 --> 00:46:44,525
Uh...

735
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,127
I...

736
00:46:46,572 --> 00:46:49,700
<i>My brilliant daughter noticed
that Gardania's poorer sections</i>

737
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:52,540
are a blight to the otherwise
beautiful community.

738
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:54,573
Hey!

739
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:57,215
To remedy this she will
take over those areas,

740
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:01,719
bulldoze the buildings, and turn the
land into beautiful rolling parks,

741
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:04,880
full of trees and grass,
and streams.

742
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:07,159
<i>Wonderful for the environment.</i>

743
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:11,319
But people live in those
areas you just knocked down.

744
00:47:12,065 --> 00:47:13,760
My neighborhood is there.

745
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,289
It is?

746
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:17,397
Delancy is
aware of that.

747
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,267
Those people will
move elsewhere.

748
00:47:19,906 --> 00:47:21,840
<i>How? They're like me.</i>

749
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:24,974
<i>They don't have money. They
can't just pick up and move.</i>

750
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:27,272
<i>If I were you I'd leave
this school immediately</i>

751
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:29,247
and get my family
ready to move.

752
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:31,945
Delancy?

753
00:47:44,897 --> 00:47:47,058
I think it is disgraceful.

754
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,927
Duly noted.

755
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:53,695
Now, shall we continue
our lesson in dinner manners?

756
00:47:55,808 --> 00:47:58,436
<i>Right, then, students,</i>

757
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:00,535
we will start
with our salads.

758
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,340
Outermost forks.
You may begin.

759
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:14,782
<i>Let's go.</i>

760
00:48:46,692 --> 00:48:48,717
Blair, are you okay?

761
00:48:49,495 --> 00:48:50,928
<i>I'm better than okay.</i>

762
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:52,691
<i>I'm ready.</i>

763
00:48:52,765 --> 00:48:54,027
<i>Ready for what?</i>

764
00:48:54,534 --> 00:48:55,523
To fight.

765
00:48:55,902 --> 00:48:58,962
<i>If Delancy gets on the throne
she's going to ruin my family,</i>

766
00:48:59,238 --> 00:49:01,206
and probably this
kingdom along with it.

767
00:49:01,574 --> 00:49:03,235
If she gets on the throne?

768
00:49:03,843 --> 00:49:07,404
<i>She can't, if we can prove
someone else is the rightful heir.</i>

769
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:09,877
<i>Gardania's magical crown.</i>

770
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:12,851
<i>It must be
in the palace. Right?</i>

771
00:49:17,423 --> 00:49:20,950
The crown glows when placed
on the true heir of Gardania.

772
00:49:21,494 --> 00:49:24,861
<i>But we have to find it
before Delancy's coronation.</i>

773
00:49:25,164 --> 00:49:27,724
So we have to find
the crown...

774
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,858
Tonight.

775
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:33,966
<i>It's time.</i>

776
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,577
Do we have
everything we need?

777
00:49:39,178 --> 00:49:40,167
Game on.

778
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:42,941
<i>What's that?</i>

779
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,076
<i>What's going on?</i>

780
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:47,176
<i>Fire drill! Fire drill!
There's no time!</i>

781
00:49:47,253 --> 00:49:49,414
Single file!
In a line!

782
00:49:51,724 --> 00:49:53,954
<i>Hmm. I don't see
a fire drill on the schedule.</i>

783
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,460
<i>What about the plan?</i>

784
00:49:57,563 --> 00:49:59,292
<i>We wait a little longer.</i>

785
00:49:59,365 --> 00:50:01,356
Hopefully,
this will be fast.

786
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:24,084
<i>Lovely day for a surprise
fire drill, isn't it, darling?</i>

787
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:27,553
Mom, what did you do?

788
00:50:29,629 --> 00:50:31,859
<i>Oh! What have you
done to your uniform?</i>

789
00:50:32,431 --> 00:50:33,796
I like it, Mother.

790
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,595
Ugh! Come on.

791
00:50:35,768 --> 00:50:37,827
<i>Let's join
the others outside.</i>

792
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:44,640
<i>Attention, students! You
may now return to your rooms!</i>

793
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:46,811
How much time
did we lose?

794
00:50:47,113 --> 00:50:48,102
Thirty minutes.

795
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:52,508
Plus another 15 minutes trying to
untangle Portia from the tether ball pole.

796
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:54,346
<i>Let's go.</i>

797
00:50:58,658 --> 00:51:00,819
<i>Thieves! They're thieves,
I tell you.</i>

798
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:02,216
Huh?

799
00:51:02,762 --> 00:51:04,093
Arrest them.

800
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:05,286
<i>What?</i>

801
00:51:05,431 --> 00:51:07,956
<i>I'm sure it's some
kind of mistake,</i>

802
00:51:08,334 --> 00:51:11,201
but Dame Devin believes
you stole her jewelry.

803
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:13,600
No! I would never!

804
00:51:13,706 --> 00:51:16,903
Not to save your poor family
about to lose their home?

805
00:51:17,076 --> 00:51:18,065
I doubt that.

806
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:20,845
Plus my daughter,
Delancy, saw you.

807
00:51:21,681 --> 00:51:25,549
<i>Didn't you tell me you saw Blair poking
around in my office the other day?</i>

808
00:51:26,352 --> 00:51:27,819
<i>I don't...</i>

809
00:51:28,254 --> 00:51:30,950
<i>I don't remember exactly,
but...</i>

810
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:36,861
Yes. Yes, I did.

811
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:42,531
I demand you
search their room.

812
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:43,894
<i>What?</i>

813
00:51:44,003 --> 00:51:45,334
<i>Girls, it's procedure.</i>

814
00:51:45,404 --> 00:51:48,339
<i>If you have nothing
to hide, it shouldn't matter.</i>

815
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:05,390
Look what I found.

816
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:10,389
My jewelry!

817
00:52:11,364 --> 00:52:12,456
<i>That's not...</i>

818
00:52:12,832 --> 00:52:14,925
<i>I didn't put that there.</i>

819
00:52:15,935 --> 00:52:17,334
<i>Here's another.</i>

820
00:52:19,205 --> 00:52:20,433
No way!

821
00:52:21,107 --> 00:52:22,301
One more.

822
00:52:24,443 --> 00:52:26,240
<i>We didn't steal anything.</i>

823
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,137
<i>Don't lie. It's unbecoming.</i>

824
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:29,436
Lock them up.

825
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:32,045
Headmistress Privet,
I promise you.

826
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:33,649
<i>With the evidence
and the witness</i>

827
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,380
<i>I'm afraid I have
no choice.</i>

828
00:52:35,454 --> 00:52:37,854
Brock, take them
to the detaining room.

829
00:52:37,923 --> 00:52:38,981
No!

830
00:52:39,091 --> 00:52:42,083
<i>We can't investigate until
after the ceremony tomorrow.</i>

831
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:45,095
You will remain
detained until that time.

832
00:52:45,765 --> 00:52:46,754
Detained?

833
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:48,665
As in, locked up?

834
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,894
During the coronation?

835
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,467
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

836
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:56,472
Unless there is another
way to explain this.

837
00:52:58,711 --> 00:52:59,769
Hmm.

838
00:53:00,112 --> 00:53:01,977
How very disappointing.

839
00:53:02,782 --> 00:53:03,771
<i>I'll say.</i>

840
00:53:04,183 --> 00:53:05,377
Brock!

841
00:53:27,373 --> 00:53:29,500
Isla, Hadley,

842
00:53:30,276 --> 00:53:31,675
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

843
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:34,738
Now neither of you
will become princesses.

844
00:53:35,648 --> 00:53:36,637
<i>Don't sweat it.</i>

845
00:53:37,116 --> 00:53:38,913
<i>Who needs a tiara anyway?</i>

846
00:53:39,051 --> 00:53:40,678
They just make
your head itch.

847
00:53:40,953 --> 00:53:43,786
<i>And it's not easy to kick
a ball in four-inch heels.</i>

848
00:53:44,357 --> 00:53:45,585
<i>Brock, stop!</i>

849
00:53:47,727 --> 00:53:50,059
<i>I've got something else
in mind for the prisoners.</i>

850
00:53:50,396 --> 00:53:52,057
You may turn them
over to me.

851
00:53:53,132 --> 00:53:54,326
But my orders...

852
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:58,067
<i>Will officially come from me
in only a few hours.</i>

853
00:53:58,904 --> 00:54:00,064
The keys?

854
00:54:01,674 --> 00:54:03,369
<i>They're all yours.</i>

855
00:54:03,843 --> 00:54:05,572
Thank you. You may go.

856
00:54:09,515 --> 00:54:12,541
<i>If this is your way or rubbing
it in, you don't have to.</i>

857
00:54:12,818 --> 00:54:13,876
<i>You've won.</i>

858
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:15,181
Yeah, we get it.

859
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:17,545
<i>What are you...</i>

860
00:54:17,623 --> 00:54:19,147
<i>I'm supposed to be asleep.</i>

861
00:54:19,892 --> 00:54:20,881
Tell me,

862
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:24,561
are you really
Princess Sophia?

863
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:27,795
<i>I... I don't know for sure.</i>

864
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:30,030
But I think so.

865
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:32,230
I think so, too.

866
00:54:32,872 --> 00:54:34,737
This is a map
of the palace basement.

867
00:54:34,807 --> 00:54:37,105
<i>There's something
of yours inside the vault.</i>

868
00:54:38,411 --> 00:54:40,504
<i>Gardania's magical crown?</i>

869
00:54:41,046 --> 00:54:42,411
<i>You have to get it.</i>

870
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:45,342
Let everyone know
the truth before coronation.

871
00:54:45,818 --> 00:54:47,410
<i>Once I'm crowned,
it's too late.</i>

872
00:54:47,653 --> 00:54:49,416
<i>Gardania's mine for life.</i>

873
00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:51,184
<i>You don't want that?</i>

874
00:54:51,557 --> 00:54:52,922
<i>I want what's right.</i>

875
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:55,423
I have to get back. My
mother will be looking for me.

876
00:54:55,928 --> 00:54:56,952
Thank you.

877
00:54:57,062 --> 00:54:59,553
<i>I'll leave a window open
for you on the third floor.</i>

878
00:54:59,765 --> 00:55:01,096
Good luck.

879
00:55:23,122 --> 00:55:24,384
Hey, Prince.

880
00:55:29,028 --> 00:55:31,496
<i>Aw, don't look
at me like that.</i>

881
00:55:33,265 --> 00:55:36,257
<i>I can't play
fetch, I'm on duty.</i>

882
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,394
Hey!

883
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,967
Prince. Prince. No, no.
Prince, come here. I gotta work.

884
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:44,905
Prince. Prince. Come on.

885
00:55:45,144 --> 00:55:46,270
Come here.

886
00:55:51,183 --> 00:55:53,048
<i>That's the window.</i>

887
00:55:53,118 --> 00:55:54,676
<i>Let's hope Delancy did
what she said she would.</i>

888
00:56:03,128 --> 00:56:04,959
<i>You're sure this will work?</i>

889
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,624
<i>Positive! Just hold on tight
and don't look down.</i>

890
00:56:16,642 --> 00:56:17,939
<i>Come.
Come on. Come on.</i>

891
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:19,838
Come on.

892
00:56:20,212 --> 00:56:21,543
Prince, hey.

893
00:56:21,914 --> 00:56:23,711
Drop it. Drop it. Drop it.

894
00:56:24,283 --> 00:56:25,511
Come back here!

895
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:34,024
The elevator should be
right down this hall.

896
00:56:38,564 --> 00:56:41,192
<i>It's time for
you to be asleep, Delancy.</i>

897
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,198
<i>You've a big day tomorrow.</i>

898
00:57:13,132 --> 00:57:14,292
<i>Don't move.</i>

899
00:57:14,366 --> 00:57:15,856
<i>What now?</i>

900
00:57:17,136 --> 00:57:19,400
<i>Laser alarm.
We've got 'em at home.</i>

901
00:57:19,672 --> 00:57:22,072
If we break the beams,
alarms go off.

902
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:24,566
<i>I can't see any beams.</i>

903
00:57:25,444 --> 00:57:27,912
Perhaps a little
touch up will help.

904
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:37,844
<i>Nice.</i>

905
00:57:38,257 --> 00:57:40,657
So, how good
are you guys at gymnastics?

906
00:57:41,193 --> 00:57:42,626
I do a mean tree pose.

907
00:57:43,262 --> 00:57:45,025
I think I can
do a somersault.

908
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:47,492
Follow me.

909
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:54,767
<i>Whoa!</i>

910
00:58:05,851 --> 00:58:08,411
<i>No!
This way.</i>

911
00:58:12,424 --> 00:58:13,789
Careful!

912
00:58:15,728 --> 00:58:17,320
Huh?
Okay.

913
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:20,528
<i>No, no. Whoa!</i>

914
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:03,337
<i>Welcome, Dame Devin.
Your security is our priority.</i>

915
00:59:03,842 --> 00:59:05,400
<i>Please enter your password.</i>

916
00:59:05,778 --> 00:59:06,802
Password?

917
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:10,447
<i>Try something.
What would Dame Devin choose?</i>

918
00:59:10,749 --> 00:59:12,410
<i>Delancy's coronation day?</i>

919
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:14,150
<i>Today's date.</i>

920
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,254
<i>You seem
to be having trouble.</i>

921
00:59:22,394 --> 00:59:24,259
<i>Would you like your
password hint?</i>

922
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:25,790
Yes.

923
00:59:26,165 --> 00:59:27,427
<i>Your hint is,</i>

924
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:30,191
<i>"The day it all
fell into place. "</i>

925
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:32,770
<i>Ten seconds
until your lockdown.</i>

926
00:59:33,105 --> 00:59:34,936
<i>The day it all fell into
place? Nine, eight...</i>

927
00:59:35,107 --> 00:59:36,233
<i>What does that mean?
... seven, six...</i>

928
00:59:36,308 --> 00:59:38,799
<i>Wait. "The day it
all fell into place. "</i>

929
00:59:39,178 --> 00:59:41,840
<i>The day Dame Devin's
plans started working.</i>

930
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:43,981
The day of the car crash.

931
00:59:49,955 --> 00:59:51,354
<i>Thank you, Dame Devin.</i>

932
00:59:52,024 --> 00:59:53,184
<i>Enjoy.</i>

933
01:00:11,777 --> 01:00:13,005
Not in here!

934
01:00:29,895 --> 01:00:33,695
Hadley, Isla, look!

935
01:00:34,466 --> 01:00:36,991
<i>Gardania's magical crown!</i>

936
01:00:41,974 --> 01:00:44,465
How do we get it
out of the case?

937
01:00:44,743 --> 01:00:45,903
<i>You won't.</i>

938
01:00:47,279 --> 01:00:49,873
<i>But I shouldn't have
too much trouble with it.</i>

939
01:01:06,899 --> 01:01:09,459
<i>Goodbye, Blair.</i>

940
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,135
<i>Enjoy Coronation Day.</i>

941
01:01:19,778 --> 01:01:21,006
<i>No!</i>

942
01:01:22,314 --> 01:01:25,215
<i>That's it.
We're sunk.</i>

943
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:34,215
<i>Well, Phil, here it is.</i>

944
01:01:34,293 --> 01:01:37,023
<i>The day we've all
been waiting for!</i>

945
01:01:37,095 --> 01:01:38,426
<i>My birthday?</i>

946
01:01:42,868 --> 01:01:44,495
<i>No,
it's Coronation Day.</i>

947
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,834
<i>Even now, our beloved
princesses-in-training</i>

948
01:01:46,905 --> 01:01:50,238
<i>are pulling into the royal palace
to receive their royal crowns</i>

949
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:52,106
<i>on their royal heads.</i>

950
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:18,731
Ladies and gentlemen!

951
01:02:18,871 --> 01:02:22,898
I welcome you to
our annual Graduation

952
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,136
and Coronation Day...
This will be the best

953
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:28,646
<i>Coronation Day ever,
don't you think?</i>

954
01:02:54,473 --> 01:02:57,636
Grace, go find Miss Privet
and tell her where we are.

955
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:22,426
Now, what are we
going to do?

956
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:28,169
You are hereby dubbed

957
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,903
<i>Lady Royal Josette
of Zinnia.</i>

958
01:03:41,086 --> 01:03:43,179
You are hereby dubbed

959
01:03:43,488 --> 01:03:45,422
Princess Miranda

960
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,981
of Philadelphia.

961
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:51,060
You are hereby dubbed

962
01:03:51,129 --> 01:03:54,496
Princess Portia
of Narcissia.

963
01:04:03,075 --> 01:04:05,600
Ugh! There is no service
at all down here.

964
01:04:16,355 --> 01:04:18,482
<i>Hmm. What's this?</i>

965
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:21,517
Stand back!

966
01:04:32,704 --> 01:04:35,730
If only there was a
keypad inside the vault.

967
01:04:36,975 --> 01:04:39,136
Maybe there is!

968
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:50,745
Standing before me now

969
01:04:50,822 --> 01:04:52,790
is Delancy Devin,

970
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:56,055
who will now
govern our beloved

971
01:04:56,128 --> 01:04:59,495
and flourishing
country, Gardania.

972
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:04,065
Delancy, I now crown you

973
01:05:04,136 --> 01:05:05,763
<i>Princess of...
Wait!</i>

974
01:05:05,837 --> 01:05:08,032
<i>Uh... Proper
princess protocol!</i>

975
01:05:08,106 --> 01:05:10,973
The bylaws state that before
a new princess can be crowned,

976
01:05:11,043 --> 01:05:13,511
the entire assembly must
spin around seven times,

977
01:05:13,578 --> 01:05:15,978
in honor of the seven
hills of Gardania.

978
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:17,207
<i>What is she doing?</i>

979
01:05:17,282 --> 01:05:18,340
<i>I don't know.</i>

980
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:20,715
<i>What are you doing?
You need to be crowned!</i>

981
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:24,255
<i>I just... Uh...
Want to do it properly.</i>

982
01:05:26,558 --> 01:05:28,185
Spin, you say?

983
01:05:29,995 --> 01:05:33,362
<i>It is indeed
proper protocol.</i>

984
01:05:33,965 --> 01:05:37,765
In honor of the seven
hills of Gardania,

985
01:05:37,836 --> 01:05:41,772
let us rise and spin
around seven times!

986
01:05:53,618 --> 01:05:54,915
<i>I got it!</i>

987
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,215
<i>The phone's linked up
with the keypad.</i>

988
01:05:58,223 --> 01:06:00,623
Day of the car crash.

989
01:06:03,528 --> 01:06:06,861
Ugh! Dame Devin must
have changed the code.

990
01:06:06,932 --> 01:06:08,229
<i>You're right!</i>

991
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,791
I heard Dame Devin change it
when the doors were closing.

992
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:12,536
I heard it too!

993
01:06:15,173 --> 01:06:17,403
<i>That's what I've been
humming this whole time.</i>

994
01:06:17,476 --> 01:06:19,239
Let me see the phone.

995
01:06:20,645 --> 01:06:22,704
Do, re, mi...

996
01:06:25,517 --> 01:06:26,814
Ah! I got it!

997
01:06:37,896 --> 01:06:39,295
<i>Woo!
Yes!</i>

998
01:06:39,698 --> 01:06:40,824
<i>We did it!</i>

999
01:06:44,703 --> 01:06:46,967
Now, hop on one foot

1000
01:06:47,038 --> 01:06:49,802
to honor those who
have hopped before us.

1001
01:07:10,295 --> 01:07:11,557
Bless you.

1002
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:17,324
<i>Hey! What are
you doing here?</i>

1003
01:07:25,343 --> 01:07:29,370
And now everyone must pat his head
and rub his stomach at the same time.

1004
01:07:31,249 --> 01:07:32,477
<i>Enough!</i>

1005
01:07:32,584 --> 01:07:35,280
The protocols have been
satisfied! Crown her!

1006
01:07:52,337 --> 01:07:53,361
<i>Wait!</i>

1007
01:07:58,577 --> 01:08:00,374
No! Do not wait!

1008
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:03,679
I am making a claim
to the throne,

1009
01:08:03,748 --> 01:08:06,114
because I am
Princess Sophia,

1010
01:08:06,184 --> 01:08:08,175
daughter of
Queen Isabella!

1011
01:08:14,226 --> 01:08:16,558
You know, there
is a resemblance.

1012
01:08:16,628 --> 01:08:18,255
This is ridiculous!

1013
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:20,992
The princess died
17 years ago.

1014
01:08:21,066 --> 01:08:22,363
Finish the coronation

1015
01:08:22,434 --> 01:08:25,494
and make Princess Delancy
ruler of Gardania for life!

1016
01:08:25,937 --> 01:08:29,338
Dame Devin, this is a serious
claim and we have to...

1017
01:08:29,407 --> 01:08:31,466
<i>We have to crown
my daughter.</i>

1018
01:08:39,618 --> 01:08:40,983
Come on!

1019
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:46,887
Oh! Get away!

1020
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:00,896
Hah!

1021
01:10:39,938 --> 01:10:42,031
It is Princess Sophia!

1022
01:10:45,844 --> 01:10:47,539
You useless child!

1023
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:49,807
<i>Do you have any idea
what you've done?</i>

1024
01:10:50,281 --> 01:10:53,808
<i>I eliminated Queen Isabella so
you could be princess one day.</i>

1025
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:02,991
<i>No, that's not what I meant.</i>

1026
01:11:03,628 --> 01:11:06,597
Guards, please
take her away.

1027
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:11,867
<i>No! You can't
do this to me!</i>

1028
01:11:11,936 --> 01:11:13,870
Get your hands off me!

1029
01:11:14,406 --> 01:11:16,306
You have to crown Delancy!

1030
01:11:16,374 --> 01:11:17,932
You have to!

1031
01:11:18,009 --> 01:11:19,271
<i>You'll pay for this!</i>

1032
01:11:27,152 --> 01:11:30,781
Blair... That is,
Princess Sophia,

1033
01:11:31,423 --> 01:11:35,484
is there anything you would
like to say to your new subjects?

1034
01:11:53,044 --> 01:11:54,375
Hello.

1035
01:11:54,846 --> 01:11:57,110
<i>I'm just a regular girl.</i>

1036
01:11:57,549 --> 01:11:59,642
But I think Headmistress
Privet is right

1037
01:12:00,018 --> 01:12:03,681
when she says every girl
has princess potential.

1038
01:12:04,956 --> 01:12:07,754
It is an honor
to be your princess.

1039
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:19,595
Blair, this is when
the Princess of Gardania

1040
01:12:19,671 --> 01:12:21,366
chooses her lady royal.

1041
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:23,703
<i>Now, I know it's
an important decision,</i>

1042
01:12:23,775 --> 01:12:25,367
so if you need
more time, then...

1043
01:12:25,443 --> 01:12:27,434
I already know
who I want.

1044
01:12:29,647 --> 01:12:31,945
It would be
an incredible privilege

1045
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:33,711
if my lady royal
could be

1046
01:12:35,153 --> 01:12:36,313
Delancy.

1047
01:12:41,326 --> 01:12:44,261
But Blair, why me?

1048
01:12:44,929 --> 01:12:46,988
I was horrible to you.

1049
01:12:47,966 --> 01:12:51,265
<i>I wouldn't be wearing this
crown without your help.</i>

1050
01:12:51,336 --> 01:12:52,860
<i>Will you accept?</i>

1051
01:12:54,873 --> 01:12:57,671
I would be honored,
Your Highness.

<i>Here's a special track
I wrote myself.</i>

1059
01:13:43,688 --> 01:13:45,280
Hope you like it!

1060
01:13:48,126 --> 01:13:50,253

<i>And this is how we do it...</i>

1068
01:14:06,911 --> 01:14:09,744
<i>No way! You're
spinning your tunes?</i>

1069
01:14:10,181 --> 01:14:12,012
It was totally time.

1070
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,512
I love it!

1071
01:14:14,152 --> 01:14:15,551
Hey, Blair,

1072
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,950

01:14:30,768 --> 01:14:32,497
Prince Nicholas.

1077
01:14:33,237 --> 01:14:36,934
<i>Wouldst thou do me
the honor of a dance?</i>

1078
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:40,077
I would be
most delighted.

1079
01:14:43,615 --> 01:14:44,980
<i>Jump up, hands in the air</i>

1080
01:14:45,216 --> 01:14:47,912
<i>Crowns on our head,

<i>We do.</i>

1097
01:15:41,072 --> 01:15:42,505
Oh, Blair.

1098
01:15:48,046 --> 01:15:50,776
<i>I know it's not exactly the
place we dreamed about...</i>

1099
01:15:50,848 --> 01:15:51,906
Are you kidding?

1100
01:15:51,983 --> 01:15:55,180
<i>It's better than anything
we ever dreamed about!</i>

1101
01:15:55,687 --> 01:15:58,212
It is, now that
the two of you are here.

1102
01:15:59,223 --> 01:16:00,451
Blair?

1103
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:03,283
<i>If you're
a princess now,</i>

1104
01:16:03,361 --> 01:16:05,693
<i>does that mean
I'm a princess, too?</i>

1105
01:16:05,763 --> 01:16:07,128
Of course.

1106
01:16:09,701 --> 01:16:12,465
There is a princess
in every girl.

1107
01:16:13,438 --> 01:16:16,373

01:18:10,955 --> 01:18:12,183
<i>Na, na, na</i>

1146
01:18:12,256 --> 01:18:14,383
<i>She'll laugh and stand up tall</i>

1147
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:15,686

<i>That sets the girl apart</i>

1158
01:18:44,589 --> 01:18:48,286
<i>Is the kindness

1159
01:18:48,392 --> 01:18:51,418
