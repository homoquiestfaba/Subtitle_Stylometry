1
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,204
- Shorter here.
- Shorter?

2
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:39,284
- Shorter.
- That is short enough.

3
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,731
OK, superstar?

4
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:44,807
- Wow!
- What's with the shirt?

5
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:59,090
That is the most frightenin' thing
I've ever seen. Looks like a deformity.

6
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:01,084
I'll fix that.

7
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,291
- Oh, God... yeah...
- That's better.

8
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:09,410
Now, if you was a guy,
I might even wanna fuck you.

9
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:12,883
You mean if <i>you</i> was a guy
you might even wanna fuck me.

10
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:16,090
So you're a boy. Now what?

11
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:19,490
Come on.

12
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:23,445
No fuckin' way.

13
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,524
Yes fuckin' way.

14
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:28,730
- A joke is a joke.
- Come on, don't be a pussy.

15
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:30,531
I'm no pussy. Let's go home.

16
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:34,572
- Someone's inside.
- You've got a date?

17
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,846
I gotta go.

18
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,844
Come here!

19
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:41,644
Can I talk to you just for a minute?

20
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:48,372
You look like a fuckin' idiot in that hat.

21
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:52,207
I'll be back. I'll be back.

22
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:53,726
Teena...

23
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,571
 <i>I don't want you comin' here</i>

24
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:00,770
 <i>And wastin' all my time</i>

25
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,044
 <i>I don't mind you hangin' out</i>

26
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:22,524
 <i>And talkin' in your sleep</i>

27
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,846
Yeah... athletic's nice.

28
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:30,812
But the thing is he's sweet.
And good hair. That's important.

29
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:40,687
I'm Billy. Are... are you Nicole?

30
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,362
 <i>... and talkin' in your sleep</i>

31
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:47,691
 <i>I guess you're just what I needed</i>

32
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:49,650
 <i>Just what I needed</i>

33
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,531
 <i>I needed someone to feed... </i>

34
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:55,411
You don't seem like you're from around here.

35
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:59,402
Where do I seem like I'm from?

36
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,523
Someplace beautiful.

37
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,212
I'll stand right here until
you're safe inside, OK?

38
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:23,726
OK.

39
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,604
 <i>You're just what I needed</i>

40
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:45,724
 <i>You're just what I needed</i>

41
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:53,130
 <i>You're just what I needed</i>

42
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:07,567
<i>You're not goin' anywhere! </i>

43
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:09,888
<i>Fucker! </i>

44
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:12,923
Get back here, you fucker!

45
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:19,130
- You fuckin' dyke!
- You freak!

46
00:05:19,213 --> 00:05:23,172
- You fucked my sister!
- Open the fuckin' door, you fuckin' faggot!

47
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:25,483
- Open the fuckin' door!
- Open this goddamn door!

48
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:27,529
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Brothers!

49
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,763
- I'll kick your fuckin' ass!
- Alicia.

50
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,889
- Who is Alicia?
- You fuckin' dyke!

51
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:34,533
- Damn, there's a lot of 'em!
- What have you done?!

52
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,047
Your fuckin' faggot cousin, too!

53
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,169
- Fuck!
- What is the matter with you?

54
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:41,642
I don't know! I don't know what went wrong!

55
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,930
You are not a boy! That is what
went wrong! You are not a boy!

56
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:47,607
They say I'm the best
boyfriend they ever had.

57
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:51,083
Do you want your mother to lock you up
again? Is that what you want?

58
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:52,572
No.

59
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,809
Then why don't you just admit
that you're a dyke?

60
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:58,246
Because I'm not a dyke.

61
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,891
Fucker!

62
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:06,804
- What are you doin'? Get outta my pants.
- The money you owe me. I want it back.

63
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:08,485
Jesus!

64
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:12,650
Careful with that.
You didn't have to do that. Jeez!

65
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:17,523
You're not crashin' here any more, Teena.
Get your stuff and go.

66
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:52,331
Bad night?

67
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,924
The worst.

68
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:15,371
- So what's your name?
- Candace.

69
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:20,604
I hate it, though. I'm thinkin' of changin' it.

70
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:22,604
Sometimes that helps.

71
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:24,412
I'm Brandon.

72
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,363
I'll pay if you get 'em.

73
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:37,683
- Sure.
- Marlboros.

74
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,445
I'll be right back.

75
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:49,489
Check this out.

76
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,211
My friend's sittin' there.

77
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:53,965
So?

78
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,652
I said get off.

79
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:02,887
Excuse me. Why don't you leave the lady
alone? I don't want any trouble here.

80
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,002
You gotta be kiddin' me.

81
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:11,210
I didn't ask you what you wanted,
you little fag.

82
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,887
You fucker! You motherfucker!

83
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:26,533
- I'll kick your white hick ass!
- Hold on, cowboy.

84
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:29,572
Can't I leave you alone for five minutes?

85
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:32,451
You fuck! I'm gonna get your ass!

86
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,528
Come on, stud. You got us into this.

87
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:39,524
Fucker!

88
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,802
Oh, shit. Cops, man.

89
00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:55,684
They suck.

90
00:08:56,893 --> 00:09:00,283
I would've had those guys
if you wouldn't have stopped me.

91
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,686
Oh, my God! John, look.

92
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,327
You're gonna have a shiner in the mornin'.

93
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,324
- I am?
- Yeah.

94
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:12,450
Oh, shit!

95
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:15,684
- You got a light, man?
- Oh, yeah, here.

96
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,604
You have got the tiniest hands.

97
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:26,571
No. They're big.

98
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:30,567
- Joe Louis had tiny hands.
- He didn't throw punches without defence.

99
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:34,329
If you're gonna get into fights
over girls, learn a few moves.

100
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:38,964
Come on.

101
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,721
- Hey, pussy.
- Fuck you, man!

102
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:50,327
- Tom, this is Brandon.
- Hey.

103
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:54,732
John. We'll give you a ride home,
as soon as we find the goddamn car!

104
00:09:54,813 --> 00:09:57,964
Sorry! It's up here somewhere!

105
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,488
We're goin' to a party. You wanna come?

106
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:03,007
Candace, it's 70 miles away.

107
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:07,764
I don't care. I mean, the night
is young and... and I am a mess, so...

108
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:15,812
Good.

109
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:38,373
Are we there yet?

110
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:43,447
It's just up ahead... unless you wanna stop
at a roadhouse and get in another fight.

111
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:17,411
I don't know where the fuck I am.

112
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:23,649
Falls City?

113
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:27,123
What are you doin' down there?
That's not even on the map.

114
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:28,612
Oh, fuck!

115
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:30,968
Lonny, my life is a fuckin' nightmare.

116
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:35,763
I got this big court date next week
and I don't got anywhere to stay.

117
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:39,971
<i>If I don't make it, I'm fucked. </i>
<i>Can I just stay at your house? </i>

118
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:42,169
- What about those doctors?
<i>- I went. </i>

119
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:46,292
It's insane. You gotta see shrinks,
shoot hormones up your butt,

120
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:50,889
and it costs a fuckin' fortune. I'll be
an old man before I get that kinda money.

121
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:52,531
<i>You gotta do somethin'. </i>

122
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:56,242
You can't just keep runnin',
because you'll end up in jail.

123
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,244
<i>For ever. </i>

124
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:02,764
You really think I can do it?

125
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,605
<i>You're the butch. </i>

126
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:06,729
Now come straight to my house.

127
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,646
No stoppin' in bars, no stealin'...

128
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:12,805
- And no more girls.
- No more girls.

129
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,088
- No more girls.
- Hey, handsome.

130
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:20,768
- Sleep all right?
- Yeah.

131
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:24,205
Candace.

132
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,204
I remember.

133
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:28,170
- This is Cody.
- Cody.

134
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:29,971
Wow! Beautiful.

135
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:32,283
You still broodin' over your fiancée?

136
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:33,409
What?

137
00:12:33,493 --> 00:12:36,246
Oh. It's a real long story.

138
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,969
God, you're really good with kids.

139
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,568
Yeah... I got one of my own.

140
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:54,647
Hey, Brandon! Good news.

141
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:57,769
- I got you a ride.
- All right!

142
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:01,562
- He's goin' to Lincoln later tonight.
- Oh, wow!

143
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,644
Cool.

144
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,964
You suck!

145
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,170
- Hey, champ!
- Hey!

146
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:32,211
Tom only dates girls
with a little butt and a long crack,

147
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:36,286
right up to the small of the back.
That's how he picks 'em.

148
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:40,205
Tom likes 'em coyote ugly.
You know coyote ugly?

149
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:42,568
I'm all over some booty!

150
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,486
Thank you.

151
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:55,202
- Looks like you're ridin' with Ted Bundy.
- Shut up, John. He looks fine, right?

152
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:57,523
Yeah, just like family.

153
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:59,808
- Speakin' of.
- Hey, where's Lana?

154
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,282
We were gonna go on, but she wandered off.

155
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,284
You got time to stick around, right?

156
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:08,207
These girls get their shit together,
they're gonna do some karaoke.

157
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:14,482
Lana! Where you been?

158
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,412
Come on, Lana. Let's go on already.

159
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:21,768
Lana, it was your idea!

160
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,609
Who are you?

161
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:07,282
 The lonesome Texas sun

162
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,684
 Was settin' slow

163
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,571
 And in the rear-view mirror

164
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,564
 I watched it go

165
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:22,171
Shut the fuck up!

166
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:25,129
 In her golden hair

167
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:31,050
 I close my eyes for a moment

168
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:33,523
 I'm still there

169
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,131
 The bluest eyes in Texas

170
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:43,051
 Are hauntin' me tonight

171
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:48,084
 Another town

172
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:51,051
 Another hotel room

173
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:59,532
 Another dream that ended way too soon

174
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:04,290
 Left me lonely

175
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:07,604
 Prayin' for the dawn

176
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:16,610
 Searchin' for the strength to carry on

177
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,605
 The bluest eyes in Texas

178
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:25,292
 Are hauntin' me tonight

179
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,690
 <i>Like the stars that fill... </i>

180
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:47,365
What the fuck...?
You were gonna be five minutes!

181
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:52,004
- We got stuck in time warp!
- Jesus, get in the car already.

182
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:04,249
- Brandon, come with us.
- He's a psycho killer, anyways.

183
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,166
- Crash with me again.
- One more night, Tyson!

184
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,444
Come on, buddy.

185
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:28,410
Like I was sayin'...
I get to the house, you know?

186
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:31,371
My sister was totally naked
and totally on fire. Right, John?

187
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:34,809
- Tom was like "Where's my camera?"
- You saved everyone?

188
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:38,886
Oh, yeah. Tom's a big hero.
He rescued everybody. Right, dickwad?

189
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:43,842
So when they brought me in, they said "This
is the biggest fire we've seen in 50 years!"

190
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:47,642
"You're a hero, man!" And I was like "Yeah?"
And they were like "Yeah".

191
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,691
That's why they put me in
all them Lincoln newspapers.

192
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,684
- Probably seen me.
- That's cool.

193
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:56,963
- What the hell is that?
- Bumper-skiing, man.

194
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:01,450
Thank you.

195
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:06,646
Flippin' burgers. That's for squares, man.

196
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,452
Give me real work,
like in the oilfields or somethin'.

197
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:12,366
I wanna be a smoke jumper
out in Mount St Helens.

198
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:15,445
You know, fightin' fires,
makin' lots of money,

199
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:19,526
and then travellin' all around:
Memphis, Graceland, Tennessee...

200
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:23,811
You dick. Graceland <i>is</i> in Memphis
and Memphis <i>is</i> in Tennessee.

201
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,962
I know.

202
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,882
- Maybe you've had enough.
- I ain't had any.

203
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:40,525
No shit, man. People like you, you don't need
drugs. You just hallucinate 24 hours a day.

204
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:52,723
All right, Tom, you're up.

205
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:54,690
Not me, man. I'm drinkin'.

206
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:57,724
Brandon, that means you.

207
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:01,203
- Yeah, stud! Let's go, cowboy!
- Come on, you can do it.

208
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:08,253
Brandon is a mean prizefighter from Lincoln.

209
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,291
Be careful what you say to him.
Tough. Very tough.

210
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:13,489
Don't let 'em scare ya. You can do it.

211
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:33,847
Freak!

212
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,204
Come on!

213
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:45,848
You can do better than that!

214
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:50,805
One more time.

215
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:53,088
John, come on. Stop it, John.

216
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:55,289
Oh, OK, OK.

217
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:02,851
- Take it easy.
- I'm fine.

218
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:07,484
Yeah, you're fine. You're fucked up,
you know? You are one crazy little fucker.

219
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,246
- What are we goin' to do with you?
- Man, it's nothin'.

220
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:14,363
<i>Wait, where are we goin'? </i>
<i>Wait, I'll drive! </i>

221
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,604
 <i>There's a diamond</i>

222
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:38,843
 <i>In her eye</i>

223
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,049
 <i>It's a-shinin'</i>

224
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,044
 <i>Up above</i>

225
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:47,603
 <i>And the moon</i>

226
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:49,684
 <i>In the sky</i>

227
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:51,684
 <i>Say you want it</i>

228
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:53,684
 <i>Tell her why</i>

229
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,689
 <i>Where gamblers</i>

230
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:04,809
 <i>Tell you lies</i>

231
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:06,929
 <i>She'll take a tumble</i>

232
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:08,924
 <i>And never lose</i>

233
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,523
 <i>And in the mornin'</i>

234
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:15,524
 <i>She'll wear a smile</i>

235
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:17,524
 <i>She's made of stars</i>

236
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:19,171
Oh, hi.

237
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,404
You sell, uh...

238
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:26,644
- Ruffles?
- Ruffles. Right over there.

239
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,644
Thank you.

240
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:43,770
Dream on, Lana.

241
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:47,330
- I can't be sellin' you no beer tonight.
- Fine. I'll browse.

242
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:54,007
The beer's in the back if you want it.

243
00:23:02,493 --> 00:23:03,892
Hey.

244
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:06,362
Space cowboy!

245
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,323
I'm so wasted. I don't know
if I'm ever gonna come down.

246
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:13,722
- That's OK.
- I need beer.

247
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:16,646
Come here.

248
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,644
It's OK. It's OK.

249
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,408
It's OK. Here.

250
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:27,927
- It's for me.
- Can I see some ID?

251
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:29,162
Sure.

252
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:30,811
How beautiful!

253
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:34,602
Jesus Christ, I feel like I'm on acid.
It's like an album cover.

254
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:39,042
Would you, uh... care to join me?

255
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:42,688
- Come on.
- Fuck off!

256
00:23:42,773 --> 00:23:46,607
Don't you talk to me like that,
you skanky little snake.

257
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:50,372
Kwik Stop.

258
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:55,164
Hey! Lana!

259
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:58,246
Lana, wait. I'll drive you. I got Candace's car.

260
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,130
I'm walkin'.

261
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:02,124
Well, here.

262
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,406
What are you still hangin' around here for?

263
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:11,452
Well, I thought someone oughta
walk you home before you get an MIP.

264
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,967
I don't need anybody to walk me anywhere.

265
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:20,044
- Jeez, watch it.
- I don't need you to stop me from trippin'.

266
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,852
Lana, you are one cranky girl.

267
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:27,967
You'd be cranky, too, Mr I'm-Going-
To-Memphis-Graceland-Tennessee,

268
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:33,002
if you were stuck where there's nothin'
to do but go bumper-skiing and chase bats.

269
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:35,527
Hey, I've been bored my whole life.

270
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:41,248
Is that why you let John tie you to the back
of a truck and drag you around like a dog?

271
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,689
No. I just thought that's
what guys do around here.

272
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:52,883
Wait a minute. What's your name again?

273
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,604
Brandon.

274
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:01,208
<i>The discs... took off from here. </i>

275
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:06,009
<i>That's all there is. Let's go back. </i>

276
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:10,363
Lana? Lana?

277
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:15,128
Look, just go on home, OK?

278
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:20,608
God, I hate my life.

279
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,604
Lana?

280
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:26,043
I hate your life, too.

281
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:31,245
- Don't look at my stupid house.
- I'm not lookin' at your stupid house.

282
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,244
I'm lookin' at you.

283
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,164
What was I thinkin'?

284
00:25:43,773 --> 00:25:45,684
Mom... come on.

285
00:25:47,053 --> 00:25:48,964
Come on!

286
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:51,444
Did you eat?

287
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,003
It's all right.

288
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:01,364
Don't. It's OK.

289
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:10,241
Hi. Here, drink this.
You'll feel better in the mornin'.

290
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,402
Come on.

291
00:26:27,173 --> 00:26:29,164
It's good for ya.

292
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:33,207
Yeah, I got a thing for cow.

293
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:35,764
I know a song about cows.

294
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:40,048
- My dad taught it to me.
- You're not gonna sing it for me, are ya?

295
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:43,443
No. I can't sing to save my life.

296
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:46,773
- Me neither.
- What?

297
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:49,492
Sure you can. You sing great.

298
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:51,564
That wasn't me. It was the karaoke.

299
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,085
So?

300
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:56,164
You were still great.

301
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:57,891
I couldn't do it.

302
00:26:57,973 --> 00:27:00,043
A lot of people I know couldn't.

303
00:27:36,973 --> 00:27:39,123
You don't know any songs about cows?

304
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:43,524
Sure I do.

305
00:27:55,133 --> 00:28:00,605
<i>Comin' to you this beautiful Friday, </i>
<i>October 27 th, this is Corn Report. </i>

306
00:28:00,693 --> 00:28:05,164
<i>It is 8am. It is 45 degrees. </i>
<i>You'd better watch out. That winter is comin'. </i>

307
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,766
Hey.

308
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:13,889
Is it always this nice in the mornin'?

309
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:16,203
I made you a little breakfast.

310
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,410
Wow!

311
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:23,969
Thank you.

312
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,885
My hand sucks.

313
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:34,407
How come Aunt Lana's asleep?

314
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:40,125
Well, your Aunt Lana is a nice girl, but
she is as lazy as the day is long, sweetheart.

315
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,488
Don't you be like that, OK? Huh?

316
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:46,849
- Answer if somebody asks a question.
- How are things with her mother?

317
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,083
She gave me April for a couple of days.

318
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:54,006
I love this song! Yes! Yes!

319
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:57,403
- <i>Who's that lady? </i>
- <i>Who's that lady? </i>

320
00:28:57,493 --> 00:28:58,687
 <i>Who's that lady? </i>

321
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:00,650
 <i>A real, real, real fine lady</i>

322
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:01,848
 <i>Beautiful lady</i>

323
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:06,131
 <i>I wish somebody would introduce her to me</i>

324
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:08,488
Oh, get up. Dance with me.

325
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:10,609
Come on. Get up.

326
00:29:10,693 --> 00:29:12,251
 <i>I didn't get a chance</i>

327
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,652
 <i>I asked her to dance</i>

328
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:15,451
 <i>Asked her to dance</i>

329
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:17,728
 <i>It was love at first sight... </i>

330
00:29:18,053 --> 00:29:19,964
April... come here.

331
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:24,164
Jesus, turn down the goddamn music!

332
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:31,244
- Come on, honey. Loosen up.
- No, let me go, let me go.

333
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:36,612
You motherfuckers!
Why did they let you fuckheads outta jail?

334
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:05,486
 <i>Belly is cravin', I got a shakin' in my head</i>

335
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:10,849
 <i>I feel like I'm dyin' and I wish I was dead</i>

336
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:15,848
 <i>If I live till tomorrow, that'd be a long time. </i>

337
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:21,087
 <i>I'll reel and I'll fall, but I'll rise on cod'ine. </i>

338
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:24,728
 <i>You'll forget you're a woman</i>

339
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:27,122
 <i>You'll forget about men</i>

340
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:31,925
 <i>Try it just once and you'll try it again</i>

341
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:34,804
 <i>You'll forget about life</i>

342
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:37,566
 <i>You'll forget about time</i>

343
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:42,408
 <i>And live all your days a slave to cod'ine</i>

344
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:46,691
 <i>And it's real, oh, it's real</i>

345
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:49,492
 <i>One more time</i>

346
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:56,202
 <i>And some of them fall</i>

347
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:59,691
 <i>And rise on cod'ine</i>

348
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,050
I'm an asshole.

349
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:09,522
What?

350
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:10,807
Blowout.

351
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:14,210
- What happened?
- Aw, I'm in the doghouse again.

352
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:16,523
- I've been there my whole life.
- Women, right?

353
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,251
Yeah.

354
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:23,725
- You gonna do a little damage control?
- And then you'll fuck it up again.

355
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:26,373
Come on. Oh, my goodness!

356
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:29,525
Hey... who are you? What's <i>your</i> name, huh?

357
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:31,808
- April.
- April?

358
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:34,726
- How'd you get such a pretty name?
- My daddy.

359
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:37,043
Yeah, that's true. I named her.

360
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,244
- Where are you goin'?
- See Lana.

361
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:41,244
All right. Go on.

362
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:46,283
Got an extra cig, man?

363
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:49,927
Thanks, man.

364
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:53,212
Is, uh... is she Lana's?

365
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:55,526
Lana's? No.

366
00:31:56,453 --> 00:32:00,128
No, I had April with a different girl. Mallory.

367
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:04,612
This here's my real family,
even if it isn't my real home, you know?

368
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:06,845
I mean...

369
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,925
Lana...

370
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:12,086
I don't know. It's kinda hard to explain.

371
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:19,087
Well, I got 12 more like this at home.
I keep it in a secret place.

372
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:23,370
She wrote to me when I was in lockup.

373
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:25,523
- Lana did?
- Yup. She wrote to me.

374
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:29,572
Even my own mom didn't
write to me. But she did.

375
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:33,089
Lana and her mom. They took me in.

376
00:32:36,453 --> 00:32:37,806
Fuck. Fucker.

377
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:42,250
- Brandon, honey, where are your folks from?
- I'm from Lincoln.

378
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,643
But my dad's out in Memphis right now,

379
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:47,606
and my mom's in Hollywood.

380
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:49,365
- Hollywood?
- Yeah.

381
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:52,684
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah. My sister's a model.

382
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:55,048
- That's glamorous!
- Hey, Brandon,

383
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,205
- Why don't you clean these ashtrays for us?
- Fuck you!

384
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:00,124
I'm just playin' with you, bud.

385
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:02,568
Brandon, honey, come here.

386
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:05,167
Over here. Closer, where I can see you.

387
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:08,086
Let me look at you in the light. Come on.

388
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:10,084
Come on.

389
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:13,044
Come here. Let me.

390
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,091
I can believe you got a model for a sister.

391
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:20,926
You're like a little movie star yourself.

392
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:32,487
Hey, April. Want a beer?

393
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:35,849
Hey! What the fuck are you doin'?

394
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:39,005
Here you go, hon. Here you go.
Have some of Daddy's.

395
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:41,482
Come on. Come on. Little bit.

396
00:33:41,573 --> 00:33:47,125
Four years ago, you wouldn't have thought
he could take care of himself, let alone a kid.

397
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:51,172
Shit, four years ago you wouldn't
have been able to talk to him.

398
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:52,732
Prison?

399
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:56,930
And her mother! Jesus Christ!

400
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:00,090
And this one...

401
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:04,803
- This one kept that boy's spirit alive.
- Mom, just forget about that.

402
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:12,287
The little bastard pissed on me!
She hasn't had the proper trainin'!

403
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:16,491
- Your mother's an asshole, you know that?
- John, she had an accident.

404
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:20,202
It's OK, sweetie. It's not your fault.

405
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,286
Havin' fun?

406
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,844
Yeah.

407
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:31,562
- What do you think of my mom? Weird, huh?
- No, I like her.

408
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:34,444
I think she's funny.

409
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,923
- Are you for real?
- Excuse me. Am I interruptin' somethin'?

410
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:41,528
Take a picture of me and my daughter.
Lana's dad gave us that.

411
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:45,606
- I don't feel like havin' my picture taken.
- Come on, honey. Just one.

412
00:34:45,693 --> 00:34:47,172
Come on, son.

413
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:51,682
Well... refill time.

414
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:53,889
Bring it in when you're ready, OK?

415
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:03,288
Here, look. It's not bad, huh?

416
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:06,446
What?

417
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:10,491
- No.
- Why not? You're beautiful.

418
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:13,444
Come over here.

419
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:24,926
I had a dream about you last night.

420
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:27,732
You did? What happened?

421
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:31,683
Come on, tell me the dream.

422
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:37,007
Someone walked me home
last night. I think it was you.

423
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:42,204
No fair!

424
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,167
Lana! It's time to go to work!

425
00:35:57,253 --> 00:36:01,246
John, you're too fucked up.
Why don't you let Brandon drive?

426
00:36:02,773 --> 00:36:05,162
Hey. Here you go, little buddy.

427
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:08,684
You all right?

428
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,044
Tom!

429
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,325
Nice car.
Why don't you turn down your radio?

430
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:31,324
Yeah, totally.

431
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:36,005
- What the fuck are <i>you</i> lookin' at?
- Wall people.

432
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,323
- What the fuck did you say?
- Wall people.

433
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,483
Let me outta this fuckin' car!

434
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:43,004
Bite me, you fuckin' fudgepacker!

435
00:36:43,093 --> 00:36:45,402
- Eat me.
- Fuck you!

436
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:50,648
- Go after 'em!
- Step on it!

437
00:37:01,893 --> 00:37:03,406
Go! Come on, go!

438
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:06,724
Come on, pussy. Go faster, you cocksucker.

439
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:11,283
Come on, Brandon! Go!

440
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,888
Go, Brandon!

441
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:47,247
Oh, no, it's the man!
Fuck! It's the piggers!

442
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:50,052
Come on, these cops are onto us.
What the fuck...?

443
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:54,364
Don't stop, don't stop. Go faster.

444
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,648
- Brandon...
- Go faster.

445
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:01,284
Brandon, stop.

446
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:05,887
That's it, that's it.
They ain't got no fuckin' balls.

447
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:15,686
When you hit the gravel, drop to 40.

448
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:29,161
I can't see.

449
00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:37,407
That's OK. Neither can he. You're flyin'.

450
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,244
Take it out.

451
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:21,646
Get off me, dick. I wasn't doin' anythin'.

452
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,372
Goin' awful fast back there, Mr Brayman.

453
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:27,843
- Tell me what you're doin' in Falls City.
- Just visitin', sir.

454
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:30,163
Yeah? Where are you stayin'?

455
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:36,004
He's stayin' with me.

456
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:44,606
I can't run a check on this.
Our computers are down.

457
00:39:44,693 --> 00:39:46,968
But I could run you all in right now.

458
00:39:50,373 --> 00:39:53,922
You could let these guys go.
They ain't got anythin' to do with it.

459
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:56,288
I got a little carried away back there.

460
00:39:56,373 --> 00:40:00,605
- We don't got anythin' like this in Lincoln.
- A dustless highway?

461
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:05,566
Only one in Nebraska.
That's a hundred-foot drop.

462
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:11,211
- I won't lock you up, but you get a ticket.
- OK.

463
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:14,888
Those are residential streets
back there, so you slow down.

464
00:40:14,973 --> 00:40:17,646
- Do you read me, Mr Brayman?
- Absolutely, sir.

465
00:40:18,213 --> 00:40:21,250
Did you see this ID?
That's pretty slick: Charles Brayman.

466
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,972
I let you down. I'm sorry.

467
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:27,682
Man, don't worry. We'll take you
to the tunnel, chase some bats.

468
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:31,083
Yeah... it's like the tunnel of love.

469
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:33,482
God, Candace, would you get a grip?

470
00:40:33,573 --> 00:40:37,248
- Is that your real birthday?
- No. November 10th, '72.

471
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,325
Hey, that's next week. Let's have a party.

472
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:43,166
21! You're gonna be a man!

473
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:45,652
Shit.

474
00:40:47,173 --> 00:40:49,562
Don't you never pull that shit again.

475
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:54,369
- What?
- You heard. Don't never pull that shit again.

476
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:57,286
You got me stopped by the fuckin' cops.

477
00:40:57,373 --> 00:41:01,730
Why... But you're the one
who told me to race after 'em.

478
00:41:01,813 --> 00:41:04,247
I had you in the clear and you fucked up.

479
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:09,645
John, it's over. Don't get upset.

480
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:14,727
I'm not upset.

481
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:16,883
You almost got us killed.

482
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:24,445
<i>- I</i> almost got us killed?
- Whoo! Brandon...

483
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:28,446
- You led us 90mph into a cloud of dust.
- Brandon...

484
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:32,811
- We were about to go off a 400-foot ravine.
- Shit! Fuck!

485
00:41:33,413 --> 00:41:35,449
- Get outta my goddamn car.
- All right...

486
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:37,842
Get outta my motherfuckin' car!

487
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:41,846
- Get outta my goddamn motherfuckin' car!
- Shit! Get off me, you sick fuck!

488
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:46,563
Get outta my goddamn motherfuckin'
shit-eatin' cocksuckin' car!

489
00:41:46,653 --> 00:41:48,564
Get out!

490
00:41:53,173 --> 00:41:54,970
- Not you.
- Fuck you!

491
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,968
Welcome to the psycho ward.

492
00:42:34,613 --> 00:42:37,127
Come on, Kate. He's takin' us to work.

493
00:42:37,893 --> 00:42:40,566
You know, Tom set that fire hisself.

494
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:58,324
That's my car!

495
00:43:02,173 --> 00:43:04,812
Doctors say he ain't got no impulse control.

496
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:09,772
I'm the only one who can control that fucker.

497
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:16,409
Come on. We'll walk you home, Candace.

498
00:43:20,053 --> 00:43:21,930
You ever try this?

499
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:27,928
Tom, did you set your own
family's house on fire?

500
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,008
What about this?

501
00:43:37,093 --> 00:43:39,004
You ever do this?

502
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,605
What the fuck, Tom?

503
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:47,202
Some people punch holes in walls.

504
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:51,245
This... helps snap me back into reality.

505
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:55,849
Gets a control of this thing inside of me,
so I don't... lash out at someone.

506
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:02,331
Me and John used to do it
to ourselves all the time in lockup.

507
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:05,723
I could always go deeper than him.
He was such a wuss.

508
00:44:13,893 --> 00:44:15,292
Try it.

509
00:44:23,373 --> 00:44:25,841
I guess I <i>am</i> a pussy, compared to you.

510
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:35,168
I'm just jokin' with you, man.

511
00:45:14,493 --> 00:45:16,131
Fuck!

512
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:18,885
Fuck!

513
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:37,888
Brandon... hey.

514
00:45:39,373 --> 00:45:43,446
- Lana.
- I'm so sorry. I just had to see someone nice.

515
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:46,331
I just got off work.
I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.

516
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,768
Just a minute. I have to pee, OK?

517
00:45:53,893 --> 00:45:57,283
God, I was scared to death that
Candace was gonna catch me.

518
00:45:57,373 --> 00:46:01,685
She's obsessed with findin' a husband.
You're her favourite candidate.

519
00:46:01,773 --> 00:46:05,368
I can't believe you worked last night.
You must be exhausted.

520
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:10,402
Me neither. I do it all the time, though.
You don't have to be sober to weigh spinach.

521
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:14,203
Thanks for the coffee.

522
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:20,808
I'm crashin' really hard, though.

523
00:46:22,373 --> 00:46:26,651
l, um... have to go back to Lincoln
to take care of some stuff.

524
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:31,965
- You really leavin'?
- Yeah.

525
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:34,931
Are you gonna see your sister? The model?

526
00:46:35,613 --> 00:46:37,365
Yeah.

527
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:40,286
Nicole?

528
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:43,761
She's pretty. Is she gonna be there?

529
00:46:43,853 --> 00:46:48,165
Yeah. Now that she's married,
we're gonna be takin' off any second.

530
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:55,363
So... where are you goin'
on your big trip outta here?

531
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:03,444
I don't know.
I guess it's not all worked out yet.

532
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:05,888
That's OK.

533
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:11,365
Thanks for givin' your address to the cops.

534
00:47:13,053 --> 00:47:14,964
It was nothin'.

535
00:47:22,933 --> 00:47:24,764
I might hitchhike.

536
00:47:24,853 --> 00:47:27,287
Really? I've never done that.

537
00:47:28,373 --> 00:47:30,284
Me neither.

538
00:47:36,093 --> 00:47:37,651
Well...

539
00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:44,129
This might sound really stupid, but, um,

540
00:47:44,213 --> 00:47:47,808
do you think there's anywhere
I could make money doin' karaoke?

541
00:47:47,893 --> 00:47:52,409
Why not? People make money
doin' all sorts of things.

542
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,524
Did you really write letters to him in prison?

543
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:03,802
Gimme a break. I was 13 years old.

544
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:06,648
Who told you that? My mom?

545
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,244
He did.

546
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,244
You better go.

547
00:48:44,853 --> 00:48:48,368
 <i>That rusty nail over our front door</i>

548
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:52,643
 <i>Is where I hung our tears in a ring</i>

549
00:48:54,053 --> 00:48:58,331
 <i>I threw that horseshoe into the wheat</i>

550
00:48:59,053 --> 00:49:02,728
 <i>To see what love can bring</i>

551
00:49:03,653 --> 00:49:07,965
 <i>Cos you're in your bed and I'm in mine</i>

552
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:12,247
 <i>On either side of town</i>

553
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:17,008
 <i>I think I might take a ride... </i>

554
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:30,009
Please... Please don't get mad.

555
00:49:33,213 --> 00:49:36,444
One night. One night and I'm gone.

556
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:40,768
They're not gonna lock me up, are they?

557
00:49:41,173 --> 00:49:45,724
Teena, how the fuck do I know what they're
gonna do? I'm sick of watchin' you fuck up.

558
00:49:45,813 --> 00:49:49,806
But... but I'm not fuckin' up.
It is <i>so</i> good down there, Lonny.

559
00:49:49,893 --> 00:49:54,125
In Falls City? They hang faggots
down there. Did you know that?

560
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:56,647
You've never even been there. Look.

561
00:49:58,253 --> 00:50:00,562
Look. See, isn't she beautiful?

562
00:50:01,533 --> 00:50:03,808
If you like white trash.

563
00:50:03,893 --> 00:50:05,884
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

564
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:12,210
Before or after your sex-change operation?
Before or after you tell her you're a girl?

565
00:50:12,293 --> 00:50:13,806
Shut up!

566
00:50:13,893 --> 00:50:16,566
It's... it's different. It's workin'.

567
00:50:16,853 --> 00:50:20,129
I'm not gonna fuck it up this time.

568
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,723
I hope they <i>do</i> lock you up tomorrow.

569
00:50:26,893 --> 00:50:31,921
<i>Keith Pierce, for spray-paintin' and</i>
<i>smashin' 50 new cars, you are sentenced</i>

570
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:35,403
to six months at the
juvenile detention centre.

571
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,044
Teena Brandon.

572
00:50:40,253 --> 00:50:43,529
Teena Brandon, docket 72391.

573
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:52,723
<i>Teena Brandon, docket 7 2391,</i>
<i>grand theft auto. </i>

574
00:51:44,253 --> 00:51:46,608
Psst! Lana! Down here!

575
00:51:48,053 --> 00:51:51,250
Brandon! Where'd you get that?

576
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:53,684
Nice hat.

577
00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:59,728
I gotta go. My break's almost over.

578
00:52:16,453 --> 00:52:19,047
It all looks so different from the outside.

579
00:52:35,893 --> 00:52:37,804
Oh, you're so pretty.

580
00:53:07,053 --> 00:53:09,283
I feel like I'm in a trance.

581
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:15,124
Am I goin' too fast?

582
00:54:46,613 --> 00:54:49,411
I cannot wear these. They make me look fat.

583
00:54:49,893 --> 00:54:51,804
Quit changin' the subject.

584
00:54:53,053 --> 00:54:55,487
I saved your ass at work.
Now tell us what's goin' on.

585
00:54:55,573 --> 00:54:58,690
Yeah, I bet Brandon doesn't think you're fat.

586
00:54:58,773 --> 00:55:03,164
- Nobody looks fat when they're layin' down.
- I knew it! I fuckin' knew it!

587
00:55:07,893 --> 00:55:11,408
- We just drove around, takin' pictures.
- Yeah, right.

588
00:55:33,613 --> 00:55:37,242
Oh, I cannot talk about it!
It's too intense.

589
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,052
Come on, Lana! I can't take it!

590
00:56:26,853 --> 00:56:28,764
<i>Are you OK? </i>

591
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:31,608
<i>Yeah. </i>

592
00:56:37,973 --> 00:56:39,884
Are you OK?

593
00:56:40,453 --> 00:56:42,125
Yeah.

594
00:56:42,213 --> 00:56:45,250
I mean, uh... I don't know.

595
00:57:13,853 --> 00:57:16,083
You're so handsome.

596
00:57:33,893 --> 00:57:36,851
And then we took off our clothes
and went swimmin'.

597
00:57:43,053 --> 00:57:45,283
Don't be scared, Brandon.

598
00:57:52,613 --> 00:57:54,569
But did you do it?

599
00:57:54,653 --> 00:57:56,564
What do you think?

600
00:58:13,104 --> 00:58:17,222
- What did you wish for?
- I know what he wished for. Yeah, baby!

601
00:58:17,304 --> 00:58:20,057
Oh, Mom, don't talk so gross!

602
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:27,419
- Happy birthday.
- You shouldn't have, really.

603
00:58:34,824 --> 00:58:37,019
Keepin' me strong, Mom?

604
00:58:37,304 --> 00:58:39,181
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

605
00:58:39,264 --> 00:58:42,142
- Thank you, Mom.
- Sorry, I forgot mine.

606
00:58:44,264 --> 00:58:47,301
- That's OK.
- I haven't wrapped mine yet.

607
00:58:49,144 --> 00:58:51,374
- Hey, grease monkey.
- How ya doin'?

608
00:58:51,464 --> 00:58:54,740
We were doin' a job in Omaha.
We could've used a lookout.

609
00:58:59,584 --> 00:59:04,339
John Lotter, I know your mother, and
I know she taught you how to knock.

610
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:08,053
We could've been lyin' around
here naked, for all you know.

611
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,736
- Where's Lana?
- In her room.

612
00:59:10,104 --> 00:59:14,894
Come on, get a beer, John.
It's Brandon's birthday. Sit with us.

613
00:59:23,104 --> 00:59:25,015
Hey, gorgeous.

614
00:59:25,784 --> 00:59:27,695
Walk right in, why don't you?

615
00:59:27,784 --> 00:59:32,016
- I'm busy fixin' my hair.
- Your hair's beautiful. I love your hair.

616
00:59:34,744 --> 00:59:37,861
- I got this for you up in Omaha.
- Cool.

617
00:59:40,504 --> 00:59:43,701
Tom and I went up to Lincoln
for a couple of days.

618
00:59:44,344 --> 00:59:46,096
Stealin' cars?

619
00:59:52,544 --> 00:59:56,139
I came by the factory before we left
and you weren't there.

620
00:59:57,144 --> 00:59:59,055
So?

621
01:00:01,504 --> 01:00:03,415
Nice.

622
01:00:09,584 --> 01:00:12,337
- Don't get upset. I just wanna talk.
- About what?

623
01:00:12,424 --> 01:00:15,734
About you and Brandon.
I'm just lookin' out for ya.

624
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:19,134
What are you talkin' about?
He's your friend, too.

625
01:00:22,464 --> 01:00:24,455
I miss you.

626
01:00:24,544 --> 01:00:26,978
- I do.
- Stop it, John. You give me the creeps.

627
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:30,022
- You're like a stalker.
- Fuck you!

628
01:00:32,624 --> 01:00:35,582
- No. No. Fuck you.
- John, I'm sorry.

629
01:00:35,664 --> 01:00:37,973
I just need some privacy right now.

630
01:00:38,944 --> 01:00:40,696
Yeah.

631
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:43,014
You know I just wanna protect you.

632
01:00:44,384 --> 01:00:46,534
I know.

633
01:00:46,624 --> 01:00:49,058
No one's ever protected me like you.

634
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,540
What do you see in him?

635
01:00:57,144 --> 01:01:00,420
I know he's nice and everythin',
but he's kind of a wuss.

636
01:01:00,904 --> 01:01:05,022
I know he's no big he-man, like you.
There's just somethin' about him.

637
01:01:05,424 --> 01:01:09,053
Oh, yeah.
"There's just somethin' about him"!

638
01:01:09,144 --> 01:01:11,180
Stop makin' fun of me!

639
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:18,533
- Lana, honey, are you fuckin' him?
- Goddamn it, John!

640
01:01:18,624 --> 01:01:21,184
- It's none of your fuckin' business!
- You are!

641
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:24,381
Excuse me. Did I interrupt somethin'?

642
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:28,695
Lana, are you OK?

643
01:01:29,224 --> 01:01:31,374
Don't even think about it, John.

644
01:01:37,264 --> 01:01:41,382
- John, let's hit the road, man.
- No. It's Brandon's birthday.

645
01:01:44,504 --> 01:01:46,734
She's beautiful, isn't she?

646
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:50,660
Oh, man. I've known her
since she was like this high.

647
01:01:51,864 --> 01:01:54,253
I could tell you stories about her.

648
01:01:55,464 --> 01:01:57,853
You know what kind of stories?

649
01:02:00,824 --> 01:02:02,940
She told me about you guys.

650
01:02:06,504 --> 01:02:11,703
And I can't think of a better guy to give
Lana to than you, so happy birthday!

651
01:02:14,144 --> 01:02:16,055
Thanks, John.

652
01:02:17,944 --> 01:02:23,701
You know, just one thing you gotta
remember, little man, is this is <i>my</i> house.

653
01:02:28,264 --> 01:02:30,175
Come on, turn up the music!

654
01:02:31,144 --> 01:02:33,055
Turn up the music!

655
01:03:16,944 --> 01:03:18,423
I quit.

656
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,938
- Quit what?
- My evil job.

657
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:26,303
I've just been thinkin' and thinkin',
what am I doin' here?

658
01:03:26,384 --> 01:03:29,740
And then it came to me...
I'll go to Memphis with you.

659
01:03:29,824 --> 01:03:32,816
- Memphis?
- I got it all figured out.

660
01:03:32,904 --> 01:03:35,816
You're right.
I'll make money singin' karaoke...

661
01:03:35,904 --> 01:03:38,213
- Lana...
- You'll manage me,

662
01:03:38,304 --> 01:03:41,933
and, if I'm no good, you'll sing
and I'll manage you. Perfect.

663
01:03:45,304 --> 01:03:47,659
Nothin' can go wrong if we're together.

664
01:03:48,544 --> 01:03:53,982
Lana, um... it's a little more complicated
than that, you know? Memphis is far.

665
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:57,056
It's 1,327 miles.

666
01:03:57,864 --> 01:03:59,536
Yeah,

667
01:03:59,624 --> 01:04:02,138
but, you know, I been thinkin'.

668
01:04:02,624 --> 01:04:07,175
We could just start our own trailer park
right here in Falls City.

669
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:14,138
- You don't wanna go with me?
- No! Of course I do!

670
01:04:14,224 --> 01:04:16,658
That's the point. I'll marry you right now.

671
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:20,294
Oh, Lana... you're in trouble again.

672
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:25,533
Actually, that ain't Lana's, it's mine.
I'll take care of it.

673
01:04:25,624 --> 01:04:27,819
I just got my first paycheck.

674
01:04:28,544 --> 01:04:30,774
Come on, now. You go sit down.

675
01:04:30,864 --> 01:04:32,695
- OK.
- I'll bring your breakfast.

676
01:04:34,344 --> 01:04:38,019
<i>The thing about the trailer park</i>
<i>is we'll have picnic tables</i>

677
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:41,858
<i>and people playin' music, </i>
<i>and barbecues every night. </i>

678
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:45,459
<i>We'll invite our friends: </i>
<i>Candace, Kate, your mom. </i>

679
01:04:45,544 --> 01:04:49,139
<i>Heck, even John, </i>
<i>if you two don't kill each other first. </i>

680
01:04:51,144 --> 01:04:54,454
<i>And best of all, we'll have our own Airstream. </i>

681
01:05:05,464 --> 01:05:08,740
If that's a hassle, you could
mail the receipt to my house.

682
01:05:08,824 --> 01:05:12,658
That's all right. I'll just be
a moment. I'll be right back.

683
01:05:19,344 --> 01:05:21,460
Just one second.

684
01:05:22,784 --> 01:05:24,695
It's slow.

685
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:32,175
Miss Brandon?

686
01:05:36,744 --> 01:05:41,340
Miss Brandon, we put your Charles Brayman
ID number through the computer yesterday,

687
01:05:41,424 --> 01:05:45,497
and this is what the Lincoln
authorities faxed us over.

688
01:05:52,144 --> 01:05:54,055
You tell me.

689
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:57,377
Wow.

690
01:05:57,464 --> 01:06:00,342
This Teena chick seems pretty messed up.

691
01:06:04,224 --> 01:06:06,021
What the hell is this?

692
01:06:09,024 --> 01:06:12,858
- Who wrote this?
- That guy who stayed with you. Brandon.

693
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:01,462
<i>Dear Lonny, I bet you can't guess where I am. </i>

694
01:07:02,464 --> 01:07:05,058
<i>That's right, back in jail, in Falls City. </i>

695
01:07:06,784 --> 01:07:08,661
<i>I'm so tired of fuckin' up. </i>

696
01:07:08,744 --> 01:07:13,613
<i>I'm tryin' to stay strong, but I don't know</i>
<i>if I can face all the mistakes I've made. </i>

697
01:07:24,704 --> 01:07:26,615
<i>I'm stayin' tough. </i>

698
01:07:35,304 --> 01:07:36,578
No!

699
01:07:55,664 --> 01:07:58,701
Candace... why do you look so funny?

700
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:16,384
Lana! Lana, what are you doin' here?

701
01:08:18,384 --> 01:08:20,295
What are <i>you</i> doin' here?

702
01:08:20,384 --> 01:08:22,261
The girls' cell?

703
01:08:22,344 --> 01:08:25,700
This place is crazy.
It's, like, put you wherever they want.

704
01:08:25,784 --> 01:08:28,139
It's fine with me, I guess, but...

705
01:08:28,624 --> 01:08:33,334
Julie, give us a break, man. Watch
the rest of the show. Tell us how it ends.

706
01:08:36,504 --> 01:08:38,734
We only got three channels. I hate it.

707
01:08:39,224 --> 01:08:40,816
Brandon, what's goin' on?

708
01:08:42,144 --> 01:08:44,533
You want the truth, don't ya?

709
01:08:46,304 --> 01:08:49,376
It sounds a lot more complicated than it is.

710
01:08:51,864 --> 01:08:56,255
Do you have any water?
Cos I'm really... My voice is... dry.

711
01:09:01,824 --> 01:09:03,815
I'm a hermaphrodite.

712
01:09:03,904 --> 01:09:05,019
What?

713
01:09:05,104 --> 01:09:07,015
Come here.

714
01:09:09,824 --> 01:09:14,102
It's a person who has both...
girl and boy parts.

715
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:17,333
Brandon's real name is Teena Brandon.

716
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:21,703
Well, see, Brandon's not quite a he.

717
01:09:22,744 --> 01:09:26,498
- Brandon's more like a sh...
- Shut up. It's your business.

718
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:31,339
Look, I don't care if you're half monkey
or half ape. I'm gettin' you outta here.

719
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:58,620
 <i>I would say I'm sorry</i>

720
01:09:58,704 --> 01:10:02,140
 <i>If I thought that it would change your mind</i>

721
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:03,862
 <i>But I know that this time... </i>

722
01:10:03,944 --> 01:10:06,014
Candace,

723
01:10:06,104 --> 01:10:08,334
I spoke to Lana's mom.

724
01:10:09,464 --> 01:10:11,341
She's missin'.

725
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:14,461
- You know where she is?
- I don't know. I swear.

726
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:17,775
Candace, if you know anythin',
you better tell me now.

727
01:10:17,864 --> 01:10:19,900
You know what?

728
01:10:19,984 --> 01:10:23,454
I already opened my big mouth,
and now no one's talkin' to me.

729
01:10:23,544 --> 01:10:25,580
Candace, <i>I'm</i> talkin' to ya.

730
01:10:33,344 --> 01:10:35,619
Either I'm fucked up,

731
01:10:35,704 --> 01:10:38,582
or something's totally weird.

732
01:10:39,504 --> 01:10:42,860
Come on, Kandi. You can tell me.
I won't tell anybody.

733
01:10:44,464 --> 01:10:46,978
- I need more to drink.
- There you go.

734
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:49,096
 <i>I try to laugh about it</i>

735
01:10:49,184 --> 01:10:52,494
 <i>Hidin' the tears in my eyes, cos</i>

736
01:10:53,224 --> 01:10:56,341
 <i>Boys don't cry</i>

737
01:10:57,824 --> 01:11:02,852
 <i>Boys don't cry</i>

738
01:11:03,664 --> 01:11:06,576
 <i>I would tell you that I loved you</i>

739
01:11:06,664 --> 01:11:09,576
 <i>If I thought that you would stay</i>

740
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:12,462
 <i>But I know that it's no use</i>

741
01:11:12,544 --> 01:11:15,104
 <i>You already gone away</i>

742
01:11:15,824 --> 01:11:17,735
 <i>Missed out your limits</i>

743
01:11:18,704 --> 01:11:20,342
 <i>Pushed you too far</i>

744
01:11:21,624 --> 01:11:23,501
 <i>Took you for granted... </i>

745
01:11:31,544 --> 01:11:35,776
Goddamn it! I wanna touch you
the way you touch me.

746
01:11:37,864 --> 01:11:39,820
No. Wait.

747
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:41,940
Fuck you, Brandon!

748
01:11:42,024 --> 01:11:43,935
Fuck you!

749
01:11:44,024 --> 01:11:46,094
I want you to feel what I feel.

750
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:52,172
Lana, wait. Wait.

751
01:11:54,384 --> 01:11:56,454
Soon. I promise.

752
01:11:59,744 --> 01:12:02,019
- Is she back yet?
- No, and I'm worried.

753
01:12:02,104 --> 01:12:05,380
- Come on, let's just go find Lana.
- He'll show up.

754
01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:08,262
Kate, I want you to tell me what's goin' on.

755
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:10,376
Mom, you read the paper today?

756
01:12:10,904 --> 01:12:12,701
- No.
- Candace, show Mom the paper.

757
01:12:12,784 --> 01:12:16,254
- John, you promised.
- Come on. Is Lana your friend or not?

758
01:12:16,344 --> 01:12:18,380
Just gimme that, honey.

759
01:12:19,984 --> 01:12:22,976
"Teena Brandon, 19,
picked up on a speeding violation."

760
01:12:23,064 --> 01:12:24,895
So? Brandon got a ticket.

761
01:12:24,984 --> 01:12:26,895
The name, Mom. The name.

762
01:12:31,984 --> 01:12:34,214
He's brainwashed her. That's what they do.

763
01:12:34,304 --> 01:12:38,183
Get out! There's nothin' in Lana's room.
John, leave her stuff alone.

764
01:12:38,264 --> 01:12:43,019
I'm not touchin' her stuff! If you were any
kind of mother, this wouldn't have happened.

765
01:12:43,104 --> 01:12:46,699
- I told you you couldn't trust him.
- You never told me anythin'.

766
01:12:46,784 --> 01:12:49,696
Come on, Kate, you got to stop this.

767
01:12:49,784 --> 01:12:54,733
Like you wouldn't jump in if it wasn't
totally obvious you're in love with Brandon!

768
01:12:57,784 --> 01:13:01,015
Holy fuckin' mother of fuck!
Tom, check this out.

769
01:13:04,184 --> 01:13:07,733
"Cross-Dressers and Transsexuals:
The Uninvited Dilemma."

770
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:10,582
"Sexual identity crisis."

771
01:13:10,664 --> 01:13:14,339
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Tom,
check this out... OK, look at this.

772
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:17,575
"The grafted skin will mimic
the skin of the natural penis."

773
01:13:17,664 --> 01:13:19,814
Get this sick shit away from me!

774
01:13:19,904 --> 01:13:21,815
Just give it a minute, OK?

775
01:13:22,744 --> 01:13:25,019
She's gotta think I was at work.

776
01:13:25,504 --> 01:13:27,415
OK.

777
01:13:27,824 --> 01:13:29,735
But I'll miss you.

778
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:53,773
- Whoa!
- Thank God you're home.

779
01:13:54,224 --> 01:13:56,340
Did you party all night without me?

780
01:13:56,424 --> 01:13:57,857
Come on in, have a beer.

781
01:13:57,944 --> 01:14:02,938
Look, I gotta take a shower. I don't mean
to be antisocial, but I'm really tired, guys.

782
01:14:03,024 --> 01:14:06,858
- How was work, Lana?
- Oh, you know, whatever, Mom. The usual.

783
01:14:10,544 --> 01:14:13,058
Mom, what the hell's goin' on?

784
01:14:15,144 --> 01:14:17,374
God, what did you tell them?

785
01:14:17,944 --> 01:14:21,095
We called work. We know you weren't there.

786
01:14:21,184 --> 01:14:25,462
Why is he talkin' to me?
What are you? My dad?

787
01:14:27,184 --> 01:14:29,539
Why are you all starin' at me?

788
01:14:30,584 --> 01:14:34,702
Get away! You're gross! You're
horrible people! Get outta my room!

789
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:37,298
We're worried. We're just tryin' to save you.

790
01:14:37,504 --> 01:14:39,335
You got a sick way of showin' it.

791
01:14:39,424 --> 01:14:42,541
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey... Oh, my God!

792
01:14:44,184 --> 01:14:47,062
Brandon, turn around and go, now.
This is a nuthouse.

793
01:14:47,144 --> 01:14:49,783
- I'm just worried about you.
- Stop with that!

794
01:14:49,864 --> 01:14:52,981
- We just need to talk.
- What do you need to talk about?

795
01:14:53,064 --> 01:14:55,532
There are some things I don't understand.

796
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:59,902
You took a leak with me and... pardon my
French, Mom, but... you shook off your dick.

797
01:14:59,984 --> 01:15:03,579
And what was that bullshit
about payin' child support for a kid?

798
01:15:03,664 --> 01:15:07,816
- You been lyin' since you came into town.
- No...

799
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:11,021
When you rode in on your
pussy-whipped faggot horse.

800
01:15:11,104 --> 01:15:15,222
The fact is, little dude,
you're nothin' but a goddamn liar.

801
01:15:15,304 --> 01:15:17,056
You know what we do to liars?

802
01:15:17,144 --> 01:15:19,419
There was never any Memphis, was there?

803
01:15:19,704 --> 01:15:23,060
We're totally fuckin' with you! Seriously!

804
01:15:24,304 --> 01:15:26,215
Go get Brandon a beer.

805
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:31,493
We were wonderin' about this paper
that you are in, Teena.

806
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:39,864
It's our ticket. They're hungry for news here.

807
01:15:39,944 --> 01:15:43,493
Yeah, but what I'm
wonderin' about is the name.

808
01:15:44,824 --> 01:15:47,622
Huh, Brandon? I mean, huh, Teena?

809
01:15:47,704 --> 01:15:49,581
I really fucked up.

810
01:15:49,664 --> 01:15:53,623
I borrowed one of Candace's cheques
and I got that ticket and this fake ID.

811
01:15:53,704 --> 01:15:56,093
I guess I just need to learn to stay home.

812
01:15:56,184 --> 01:16:00,894
Brandon, I invite you into my home and
you expose my daughter to your sickness.

813
01:16:00,984 --> 01:16:04,943
- Did you ever think about Lana?
- That's all I've been thinkin' about.

814
01:16:05,024 --> 01:16:08,460
You know, Lana, if you are a lesbian,
you just need to tell me.

815
01:16:08,544 --> 01:16:12,173
- John, I'm not. Mom, it's not...
- Stop it. It's not Lana. It's me.

816
01:16:12,264 --> 01:16:17,054
Lana, I'm so sorry. Mom, wait, I can explain.
We can work this out. I have this thing...

817
01:16:17,144 --> 01:16:20,056
You fuckin' pervert.
Are you a girl or are you not?

818
01:16:20,144 --> 01:16:21,941
Are you a girl or are you not?

819
01:16:22,024 --> 01:16:24,174
There's a real easy way to solve this.

820
01:16:24,264 --> 01:16:26,983
- Fuck you! Get the fuck off of me.
- You want a fight?

821
01:16:27,064 --> 01:16:31,342
- Get out of here with your sick psycho brain!
- I could kill you for lyin' to Lana.

822
01:16:31,424 --> 01:16:35,053
John, there's not gonna be
any killin' goin' on, OK?

823
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:42,174
Do you trust me enough to let
Brandon show <i>me? </i> Then I'll tell <i>you. </i>

824
01:16:43,184 --> 01:16:45,095
Do you trust me enough?

825
01:16:48,184 --> 01:16:49,856
OK, John?

826
01:16:50,824 --> 01:16:52,735
Yeah.

827
01:16:53,704 --> 01:16:55,376
OK.

828
01:16:55,464 --> 01:16:57,375
Thank you, guys.

829
01:16:59,344 --> 01:17:01,096
Fuck me!

830
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:03,095
Holy fuck!

831
01:17:03,864 --> 01:17:06,094
Get over here. I'm so sorry, Brandon.

832
01:17:06,184 --> 01:17:08,140
Lana... I gotta explain.

833
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:11,933
Oh, no, no, no. Button up your pants.
Don't show me anythin'.

834
01:17:12,864 --> 01:17:14,695
Think about it.

835
01:17:14,784 --> 01:17:16,502
I know you're a guy.

836
01:17:16,584 --> 01:17:21,339
OK, but you gotta listen. I was born
with this weirdness, like a birth defect.

837
01:17:21,424 --> 01:17:25,099
It's actually not that rare,
but these doctors are tryin' to fix it.

838
01:17:25,184 --> 01:17:27,254
But I have really weird stuff, too.

839
01:17:28,624 --> 01:17:30,501
Don't be scared.

840
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:33,774
Look how beautiful it is out there.

841
01:17:33,864 --> 01:17:37,140
- Oh, Lana...
- That's us. We can beam ourselves out there.

842
01:17:40,304 --> 01:17:42,454
So what are you gonna tell 'em?

843
01:17:42,544 --> 01:17:45,263
I'm gonna tell 'em what they wanna hear.

844
01:17:45,504 --> 01:17:48,223
I'm gonna tell 'em what we know is true.

845
01:17:59,904 --> 01:18:01,815
Mom,

846
01:18:03,144 --> 01:18:05,374
I seen him in the full flesh.

847
01:18:06,024 --> 01:18:08,174
I seen it.

848
01:18:08,264 --> 01:18:10,175
I know he's a man.

849
01:18:11,064 --> 01:18:13,703
Problem done. Now let's go to bed.

850
01:18:15,464 --> 01:18:17,614
Son of a bitch!
What have you done to my baby?

851
01:18:17,704 --> 01:18:20,264
What the fuck are you, you motherfucker?!

852
01:18:20,344 --> 01:18:21,777
Huh?

853
01:18:22,304 --> 01:18:24,022
Tell me!

854
01:18:30,344 --> 01:18:32,255
You little liar.

855
01:18:32,864 --> 01:18:34,616
Kate, get her outta here.

856
01:18:34,704 --> 01:18:36,615
Come on.

857
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:44,103
All I need is the truth, little buddy. Come on.

858
01:18:46,864 --> 01:18:49,901
All right... I'm sorry to put you
through this. Wait...

859
01:18:50,104 --> 01:18:51,935
- Unstrap his belt.
- I'll do it!

860
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:54,902
Tom, just turn the light off. I'll do it! Please!

861
01:18:54,984 --> 01:18:56,975
Fuck! John, let me the fuck go!

862
01:18:57,064 --> 01:19:00,659
What's goin' on in there? Open the door!

863
01:19:03,064 --> 01:19:04,975
Open the fuckin' door!

864
01:19:08,864 --> 01:19:11,173
- John, please! Please!
- What do you see?

865
01:19:11,264 --> 01:19:13,619
If it's down here, it's the tiniest I ever saw!

866
01:19:13,704 --> 01:19:17,902
- Touch it.
- Oh, goddamn it, I can't! God, I can't do it!

867
01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:19,895
What the fuck are you?!

868
01:19:19,984 --> 01:19:21,940
Come on. Come on. Come on.

869
01:19:22,744 --> 01:19:24,894
Let me go! John, let me go!

870
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:30,575
Open the door!

871
01:19:33,784 --> 01:19:36,582
Don't look like no sexual identity crisis to me.

872
01:19:39,784 --> 01:19:42,014
- Open the door!
- Get in here.

873
01:19:43,704 --> 01:19:46,502
Look at your little boyfriend.
Look at your little boyfriend.

874
01:19:50,024 --> 01:19:52,936
Come on, I'm holdin' you until you look.

875
01:19:53,024 --> 01:19:54,503
Look!

876
01:19:54,584 --> 01:19:56,336
Leave him alone!

877
01:20:12,024 --> 01:20:14,538
- Leave him alone!
- Him?

878
01:20:14,624 --> 01:20:16,535
Him?!

879
01:20:17,864 --> 01:20:20,378
- Get outta my house!
- John, we called the cops.

880
01:20:20,464 --> 01:20:23,854
- Go on. Get out.
- You are just too fucked up!

881
01:20:24,584 --> 01:20:26,734
Leave us alone!

882
01:20:26,824 --> 01:20:31,773
- Leave me alone. Please, just leave me alone!
- You promised... You promised...

883
01:20:46,784 --> 01:20:49,423
I guess that's everythin'.

884
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:54,621
You know, I told Brandon...
that nobody has a right to do that to you.

885
01:20:56,704 --> 01:20:59,901
Come on, we've done everythin' we can.
Let's get outta here.

886
01:21:00,144 --> 01:21:02,658
- Let's go.
- I'm waitin' for Brandon.

887
01:21:03,824 --> 01:21:06,861
Your mom's right.
Until this is straightened out,

888
01:21:06,944 --> 01:21:11,176
it'd be better for everyone
if Brandon stays someplace else.

889
01:21:11,264 --> 01:21:15,098
What are you talkin' about?
lt'd be better to lock up Tom and John.

890
01:21:15,184 --> 01:21:18,494
Lana, everythin' Teena told us was lies.

891
01:21:18,584 --> 01:21:20,700
Everythin'. Everythin'.

892
01:21:22,504 --> 01:21:24,699
We need to go.

893
01:21:24,784 --> 01:21:26,661
Now.

894
01:21:26,744 --> 01:21:28,621
Come on!

895
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:30,615
Come on. Get up!

896
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:35,176
I'm askin' you this
because if this goes to court

897
01:21:35,264 --> 01:21:39,223
that question's gonna come up
and I'm gonna want an answer.

898
01:21:39,824 --> 01:21:41,337
Uh, I don't know why I have to...

899
01:21:41,424 --> 01:21:43,335
All right, let's back up.

900
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:46,655
After they pulled your pants down
and seen you was a girl,

901
01:21:47,184 --> 01:21:50,062
what did he do? Did he fondle you any?

902
01:21:55,984 --> 01:21:57,895
No.

903
01:22:07,944 --> 01:22:10,663
<i>Didn't that kinda get</i>
<i>your attention somehow? </i>

904
01:22:12,144 --> 01:22:16,740
That he wouldn't put his hand in your pants
and just play with you a little bit?

905
01:22:18,624 --> 01:22:20,182
I don't know what he did.

906
01:22:29,184 --> 01:22:31,175
Let's go. Come on.

907
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:36,453
Let's go, buddy.
Come on, let's go for a ride. Move!

908
01:22:39,824 --> 01:22:43,942
I can't believe that he pulled your pants
down, and if you are a female,

909
01:22:44,024 --> 01:22:47,460
that he didn't stick
his hand in ya or his finger in ya.

910
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:49,783
Well, he didn't.

911
01:23:05,744 --> 01:23:07,621
Get outta the car.

912
01:23:07,704 --> 01:23:09,979
Get outta the car. Come on.

913
01:23:12,304 --> 01:23:14,340
- John...
- Shut up. Move!

914
01:23:14,424 --> 01:23:15,823
- Wait, John.
- Shut up.

915
01:23:15,904 --> 01:23:18,862
- John, it's me. Brandon. You know me.
- Shut up.

916
01:23:18,944 --> 01:23:21,378
- Don't hurt me.
- Take off your shirt.

917
01:23:21,464 --> 01:23:25,343
You know you brought this on yourself,
Teena. Tom, get out the car!

918
01:23:26,744 --> 01:23:30,054
- I'm...
- Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt.

919
01:23:30,144 --> 01:23:33,978
You can make this easy, or you can
get the shit knocked outta you.

920
01:23:34,064 --> 01:23:35,975
All right...

921
01:23:41,544 --> 01:23:46,698
Please, John, wait. Please...
We can work this out. Please.

922
01:23:46,784 --> 01:23:48,661
Get off me. Get off!

923
01:23:49,744 --> 01:23:52,304
<i>Wait, John. Please. Please don't hurt me. </i>

924
01:23:52,384 --> 01:23:54,944
After you had your pants off,

925
01:23:56,184 --> 01:23:58,744
how were you positioned in the back seat?

926
01:23:59,744 --> 01:24:01,257
On my back.

927
01:24:01,344 --> 01:24:03,255
You was on your back?

928
01:24:05,464 --> 01:24:08,536
You say you're 21 and you've
never had sex before. Correct?

929
01:24:08,864 --> 01:24:10,934
That's right.

930
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:13,620
When they had a spread of ya,

931
01:24:13,704 --> 01:24:15,660
when they poked ya,

932
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:18,338
where'd they try to pop it in first?

933
01:24:18,824 --> 01:24:21,258
<i>I said move your fuckin' hands! </i>

934
01:24:24,384 --> 01:24:26,261
My vagina.

935
01:24:26,344 --> 01:24:28,255
Where?

936
01:24:28,944 --> 01:24:30,855
My vagina.

937
01:24:40,624 --> 01:24:42,535
Go ahead, man. Take it.

938
01:24:53,544 --> 01:24:55,421
Come on. Come on.

939
01:24:55,504 --> 01:24:57,415
Get up there. Get up!

940
01:24:59,024 --> 01:25:00,935
Take this fuckin' thing off.

941
01:25:03,344 --> 01:25:05,255
Take this fuckin' thing off.

942
01:25:14,584 --> 01:25:16,495
No!

943
01:26:30,304 --> 01:26:32,579
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

944
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,940
- You OK?
- Yeah.

945
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:54,622
Just... just take me home, OK?

946
01:26:56,944 --> 01:27:00,653
If you keep our little secret,
we'll stay friends. Right, little buddy?

947
01:27:00,744 --> 01:27:04,373
Cos if you don't...
we'll have to silence you permanently.

948
01:27:06,944 --> 01:27:11,142
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I mean, this is all my fault. I know.

949
01:27:24,344 --> 01:27:26,619
You OK in there, little dude?

950
01:27:27,424 --> 01:27:28,857
Yeah!

951
01:27:29,464 --> 01:27:31,375
I'm fine!

952
01:27:43,784 --> 01:27:45,740
I'm gettin' a beer. You want one?

953
01:27:45,824 --> 01:27:47,257
No.

954
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:52,300
Make sure you get yourself
cleaned up in there.

955
01:27:52,944 --> 01:27:55,174
Will you need any help?

956
01:27:58,664 --> 01:28:00,575
No! I'm good!

957
01:28:10,064 --> 01:28:12,578
You almost ready in there, little dude?

958
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,462
Gimme a break, man!

959
01:28:16,544 --> 01:28:18,421
Gimme two fuckin' seconds!

960
01:28:22,224 --> 01:28:24,135
Tom! Tom!

961
01:28:38,504 --> 01:28:40,574
Oh, my God! Brandon!

962
01:28:42,864 --> 01:28:45,094
What are you doin' here?

963
01:28:45,584 --> 01:28:47,973
Mom, stop it! He's hurt!

964
01:28:51,504 --> 01:28:53,176
Lana...

965
01:28:53,264 --> 01:28:55,573
I don't want <i>it</i> in the house.

966
01:28:56,104 --> 01:28:58,015
Lana...

967
01:28:58,504 --> 01:29:00,893
Mom, stop it. He's hurt!

968
01:29:00,984 --> 01:29:02,895
I'm sorry.

969
01:29:04,264 --> 01:29:06,573
Call an ambulance! Now!

970
01:29:14,304 --> 01:29:16,215
OK, almost.

971
01:29:27,384 --> 01:29:29,579
So they assaulted you?

972
01:29:35,544 --> 01:29:38,012
If you don't mind, it's just necessary...

973
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:43,462
I need for you to take your pants off, OK?

974
01:29:45,584 --> 01:29:47,495
Please.

975
01:29:47,584 --> 01:29:49,495
I'm not gonna hurt you.

976
01:29:52,184 --> 01:29:54,414
How do you know they raped me?

977
01:30:17,624 --> 01:30:21,537
Why do you run around with guys,
bein' you're a girl yourself?

978
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:26,379
- Why do you go around kissin' girls?
- I don't know what this has to do with...

979
01:30:26,464 --> 01:30:31,060
I'm tryin' to get some answers,
so I can know exactly what's goin' on.

980
01:30:32,144 --> 01:30:35,181
Are you gonna answer
my question for me or not?

981
01:30:38,864 --> 01:30:41,378
I have a sexual identity crisis.

982
01:30:42,144 --> 01:30:44,055
You what?

983
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:48,294
A sexual identity crisis.

984
01:31:26,264 --> 01:31:28,141
Brandon...

985
01:31:28,504 --> 01:31:31,382
I just wanted to say I'm really... sorry.

986
01:31:34,104 --> 01:31:36,015
Oh, my God!

987
01:31:36,744 --> 01:31:38,939
What did they do to you?

988
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:42,543
Oh, my God. Come in here. Come in.

989
01:31:44,144 --> 01:31:45,577
Go inside.

990
01:32:41,224 --> 01:32:45,422
That is a bunch of bull.
If I wanted to rape somebody, I got Mallory.

991
01:32:48,224 --> 01:32:50,135
Listen, John.

992
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:53,934
I'm just here to tell you
that it's been reported.

993
01:32:54,024 --> 01:32:59,178
Listen to me. So if you did anythin',
or anythin' happened in that room,

994
01:32:59,744 --> 01:33:01,655
you get it cleaned up.

995
01:33:15,384 --> 01:33:19,935
We went out, um... muddin' last night,
and we got stuck in a ditch.

996
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:25,939
- Seriously.
- Why is she fuckin' makin' lies like that?

997
01:33:31,624 --> 01:33:33,535
Seriously!

998
01:33:35,024 --> 01:33:36,935
You want a beer?

999
01:33:39,704 --> 01:33:41,899
- No, no, no.
- Oh, come on.

1000
01:33:41,984 --> 01:33:43,895
You take care, John.

1001
01:33:44,784 --> 01:33:47,298
I'll come back later. We'll play cards.

1002
01:33:47,384 --> 01:33:50,581
Why don't you just give it
a few days, all right?

1003
01:33:50,664 --> 01:33:52,575
OK.

1004
01:33:57,584 --> 01:34:00,018
God, you're such a stupid fuckin' pussy!

1005
01:34:00,104 --> 01:34:02,060
What, man? You're paranoid.

1006
01:34:02,144 --> 01:34:05,454
She came here to warn us.
She ain't gonna say nothin'.

1007
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,135
Hello?

1008
01:34:08,984 --> 01:34:10,337
Yes, sir.

1009
01:34:10,424 --> 01:34:12,301
No, sir.

1010
01:34:12,584 --> 01:34:15,018
Yes, sir. Tomorrow mornin'.

1011
01:34:15,104 --> 01:34:17,060
Yeah, we'll come by.

1012
01:34:17,144 --> 01:34:19,863
We have to go by the station
tomorrow mornin'.

1013
01:34:55,304 --> 01:34:57,499
Can I come sit by you?

1014
01:35:15,984 --> 01:35:17,895
Do you hate me?

1015
01:35:22,904 --> 01:35:24,815
Do you need anythin'?

1016
01:35:38,144 --> 01:35:40,055
God!

1017
01:35:42,024 --> 01:35:43,935
You're so pretty!

1018
01:35:50,624 --> 01:35:53,263
You're just sayin' that cos you like me.

1019
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,255
No!

1020
01:36:11,424 --> 01:36:13,415
What were you like

1021
01:36:14,264 --> 01:36:16,175
before all this?

1022
01:36:18,304 --> 01:36:20,613
Were you like me? Like a <i>girl</i> girl?

1023
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,975
Yeah.

1024
01:36:27,184 --> 01:36:29,095
Like a long time ago.

1025
01:36:31,424 --> 01:36:34,177
And then I guess I was just like a <i>boy</i> girl.

1026
01:36:35,264 --> 01:36:37,175
And then I was just a jerk.

1027
01:36:42,104 --> 01:36:44,015
It's weird.

1028
01:36:45,384 --> 01:36:47,659
Finally everythin' felt right.

1029
01:36:53,424 --> 01:36:55,699
Boy, that's pretty weird, huh?

1030
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:58,055
Yep.

1031
01:37:00,104 --> 01:37:02,982
That dream I had? The first night?

1032
01:37:04,704 --> 01:37:06,615
We were on the highway together.

1033
01:37:08,504 --> 01:37:10,415
We can still do it.

1034
01:37:13,464 --> 01:37:15,375
Lana... l, um...

1035
01:37:17,184 --> 01:37:21,814
Look, I never been on the highway
or the Grand Canyon, or any place like that.

1036
01:37:22,584 --> 01:37:25,382
Until I came here,
I never even been outta Lincoln.

1037
01:37:26,064 --> 01:37:27,975
I never even met my dad.

1038
01:37:28,744 --> 01:37:33,101
He died before I was born,
and my sister ain't no model in Hollywood.

1039
01:37:50,304 --> 01:37:52,943
I don't know if I'm gonna know how to do it.

1040
01:37:53,024 --> 01:37:55,379
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1041
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:43,219
Um, I was wonderin'

1042
01:38:43,744 --> 01:38:46,975
if you wanna come home
to Lincoln with me.

1043
01:38:48,784 --> 01:38:51,014
My mom, she'll love you.

1044
01:38:51,384 --> 01:38:54,023
And then you gotta meet my cousin Lonny.

1045
01:38:54,104 --> 01:38:56,459
He's a pain, but he's great.

1046
01:39:00,304 --> 01:39:02,215
When are we goin'?

1047
01:39:06,584 --> 01:39:08,859
We have to leave tonight.

1048
01:39:09,744 --> 01:39:12,099
Candace says she'll drive us.

1049
01:39:13,984 --> 01:39:15,576
All right.

1050
01:39:18,224 --> 01:39:20,260
I better get my stuff, then.

1051
01:39:20,344 --> 01:39:21,823
OK.

1052
01:39:38,104 --> 01:39:39,981
I'll be right back.

1053
01:39:53,784 --> 01:39:55,695
Lana...

1054
01:39:57,064 --> 01:39:59,180
Sorry.

1055
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:02,542
We could leave right now. It's better.

1056
01:40:03,344 --> 01:40:05,255
OK.

1057
01:40:06,184 --> 01:40:08,823
Don't pack too much. We'll send for it later.

1058
01:40:10,304 --> 01:40:12,534
Tomorrow mornin'

1059
01:40:12,624 --> 01:40:16,139
you and I will be eatin' breakfast in Lincoln.

1060
01:40:22,224 --> 01:40:24,579
Did you do somethin' to your hair?

1061
01:40:26,384 --> 01:40:28,295
I don't know.

1062
01:40:29,184 --> 01:40:31,061
You like it?

1063
01:40:31,144 --> 01:40:33,374
I don't know. I guess.

1064
01:40:34,224 --> 01:40:36,454
I'll try and put it back.

1065
01:40:44,584 --> 01:40:46,814
All right... we should go.

1066
01:40:59,944 --> 01:41:01,855
It's OK, Lana.

1067
01:41:02,584 --> 01:41:06,657
You don't have to come
with me now. There'll be time.

1068
01:41:09,304 --> 01:41:11,693
Just make sure you get out.

1069
01:41:11,784 --> 01:41:13,422
OK?

1070
01:41:23,184 --> 01:41:27,780
- John, what are you doin' here?
- Where are they? Are they here?

1071
01:41:28,104 --> 01:41:30,015
Just wait, OK?

1072
01:41:31,424 --> 01:41:33,016
I'll be right back.

1073
01:41:33,304 --> 01:41:35,613
Brandon ain't here.

1074
01:41:37,344 --> 01:41:40,780
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he ain't here.

1075
01:41:42,744 --> 01:41:44,655
Where's Lana?

1076
01:42:01,784 --> 01:42:02,978
Brandon's at Candace's.

1077
01:42:03,064 --> 01:42:05,100
- What?
- He's at Candace's place.

1078
01:42:17,864 --> 01:42:19,980
- You found him?
- Yeah.

1079
01:42:20,544 --> 01:42:22,853
- What are you guys doin'?
- Oh, shit.

1080
01:42:22,944 --> 01:42:25,299
Listen, you wanna go out for a drink?

1081
01:42:25,384 --> 01:42:27,579
- No.
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1082
01:42:42,984 --> 01:42:45,862
- Where are we goin'?
- Told you not to bring her.

1083
01:42:46,624 --> 01:42:48,535
Stay off the main road.

1084
01:42:51,504 --> 01:42:56,532
Think they'd recognise her
if we chopped off her head and her hands?

1085
01:42:58,864 --> 01:43:00,616
John...

1086
01:43:00,704 --> 01:43:04,777
We're just takin' care of a couple of dykes.
Are you one of 'em?

1087
01:43:06,384 --> 01:43:08,454
Where'd you get that?

1088
01:43:12,624 --> 01:43:15,343
You still plannin' on goin' to Memphis?

1089
01:43:16,104 --> 01:43:17,696
Memphis...

1090
01:43:39,544 --> 01:43:40,738
Why are we here?

1091
01:43:40,824 --> 01:43:43,019
Any others in there, you take care of 'em.

1092
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:45,254
What are you gonna do to Candace?

1093
01:43:46,224 --> 01:43:48,135
No! John, no!

1094
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:52,263
Wait! She's got a baby, John!
John, look at me. Look at me. No!

1095
01:43:52,344 --> 01:43:54,300
Get the fuck off of me!

1096
01:43:54,664 --> 01:43:56,495
Candace!

1097
01:43:57,624 --> 01:44:00,900
Get the light, get the light.
Where the fuck is it?!

1098
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:05,501
Where the fuck is she?

1099
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:06,932
John...

1100
01:44:07,304 --> 01:44:08,896
John...

1101
01:44:09,784 --> 01:44:11,581
- Don't hurt my baby!
- Stop...

1102
01:44:11,664 --> 01:44:12,813
Shut the fuck up!

1103
01:44:12,904 --> 01:44:15,020
- Don't hurt Candace.
- Don't listen to her!

1104
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,015
She has nothin' to do with this!

1105
01:44:17,104 --> 01:44:21,063
John, you were right about me.
I just keep gettin' back up.

1106
01:44:21,144 --> 01:44:23,533
I said shut up. Shut up!

1107
01:44:23,624 --> 01:44:25,535
Candace!

1108
01:44:26,224 --> 01:44:28,579
- Don't listen to her!
- He said shut up.

1109
01:44:28,664 --> 01:44:30,336
John...

1110
01:44:33,824 --> 01:44:35,974
Teena...

1111
01:44:36,064 --> 01:44:39,659
Please don't hurt my baby, Tom! Please!

1112
01:44:40,544 --> 01:44:42,136
Why didn't you leave?

1113
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:45,462
We can still do it.

1114
01:44:55,464 --> 01:44:56,738
No!

1115
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:59,779
No!

1116
01:45:05,704 --> 01:45:10,573
Tom, don't! Please don't hurt my baby,
Tom! Please, God, please!

1117
01:45:31,584 --> 01:45:33,256
No!

1118
01:45:37,944 --> 01:45:39,218
Come on.

1119
01:45:39,304 --> 01:45:41,340
Come on, Lana.

1120
01:45:41,424 --> 01:45:43,335
Come on.

1121
01:48:08,224 --> 01:48:12,775
<i>Dear Lana, by the time you read this, </i>
<i>I'll be back home in Lincoln. </i>

1122
01:48:12,864 --> 01:48:17,494
<i>I'm scared of what's ahead, but when</i>
<i>I think of you... I know I'll be able to go on. </i>

1123
01:48:18,984 --> 01:48:21,703
<i>You were right. Memphis isn't far at all. </i>

1124
01:48:22,504 --> 01:48:25,780
<i>I'll be makin' a trip out on</i>
<i>the highway before too long. </i>

01:48:25,864 --> 01:48:27,775
