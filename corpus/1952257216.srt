1
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,820
I've heard of you before.

2
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,090
Really?

3
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,660
You major in piano, right?

4
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:08,970
Yeah.

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,430
Why did you transfer to our school?

6
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,870
Something wrong with yours?

7
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,230
Your school is more beautiful.

8
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,980
And... My Dad made me.

9
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,810
Hi!

10
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,740
Classmate?

11
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,680
Yeah.

12
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,810
The school is famous for its piano?

13
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,060
Yeah, we're all very hard-working.

14
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,450
You too, right?

15
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,050
I'm okay.

16
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,660
Look here,

17
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,660
These 2 floors are all piano rooms.

18
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,300
You study piano, you'll be here often.

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,210
It's beautiful!

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,510
This building is over 100 years old.

21
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,540
100 years?

22
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,340
But we're tearing it

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,770
down on graduation day.

24
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,310
Why?

25
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,580
To build a new one!

26
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,660
We won't be using it
after graduation though.

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,520
Later students are more fortunate.

28
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,320
Come practice often!

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,520
Sure.

30
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,890
This is a really nice school.

31
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,930
Want me to show you inside?

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
I'll be fine on my own!

33
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,000
If I get lost, I'll yell for help!

34
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,800
Excuse me, were you playing?

35
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,330
No.

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,200
There isn't anyone else.

37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,570
Okay, it was me.

38
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,030
It sounded beautiful.

39
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,140
Thanks.

40
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,210
In the 19th century,

41
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,650
there was a musical genius

42
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,320
later known as the piano poet,

43
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,290
Sorry I'm late.

44
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,360
That's Chopin.

45
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,290
Why was he a musical genius?

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,100
Hey, pay attention in class!

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,830
He started learning piano at age of 6,

48
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,040
but when he was 8 years old,

49
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,880
he has already performed publicly

50
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,540
and successfully played a concerto

51
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,480
which made him famous.

52
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,010
But why was he called a piano poet?

53
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,850
Because his work is described

54
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,020
to be fluid and graceful like a poem.

55
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,020
- What?
- Why are you following me?

56
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,220
I'm not.

57
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,180
No? Bye then!

58
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,200
I want to ask you!

59
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,930
What's the name of the song you played?

60
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,120
It sounded beautiful!

61
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,640
That's a secret!

62
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,500
What's so secretive about that?

63
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,020
What's your name?

64
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,550
I told you already.

65
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,320
I hear you from far away.

66
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,160
Let's go.

67
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,630
This is a school!
Not a place to pick up girls.

68
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,440
Watch yourself

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,800
and pay attention in class!

70
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,440
Want me to give you a ride on the way?

71
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,490
How did you know it's on the way?

72
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,770
Why the sudden rain?
You don't have an umbrella?

73
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,210
Why are you so quiet?

74
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,720
It's a secret no matter what I ask.

75
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,720
Which musician do you like?

76
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,690
All of them.

77
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,060
Do you like the sun or the rain?

78
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,130
Like them both.

79
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,270
You play the piano well!

80
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,140
Very well!

81
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,870
Very well!

82
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,250
Will you play for me next time?

83
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,240
No!

84
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,140
That's ok. I'll hear it sooner or later.

85
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,490
I'm almost home.

86
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,830
Really?

87
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,400
It's fine here, thanks!

88
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,330
It's fine, I'll take you to the door.

89
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,060
I don't want my family to see.

90
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,080
Hey, what's your name?

91
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,070
I'm Rain.

92
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,420
My name is Jay.

93
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,690
Bye!

94
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,430
Aren't you making dinner?

95
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,010
Right, I almost forgot!

96
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,310
Here, I got it all ready.

97
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,720
That's okay, I'll get it from your Dad.

98
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,690
Really?

99
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,650
Thanks!

100
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,260
You look happy today!

101
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,180
Ok, bye!

102
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,260
Ride carefully! Bye!

103
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,660
Dinner will be ready soon!

104
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:59,300
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

105
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:05,340
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, change.

106
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,880
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

107
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,280
Jay, what're you looking for?

108
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,610
Nothing.

109
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,080
Looking for someone?

110
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,420
Good morning.

111
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,350
Good morning.

112
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,600
Okay, let's look at question 2

113
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,760
and see which student knows the answer.

114
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,230
Raise your hands. You!

115
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,030
B, 2nd augmented.

116
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,900
Very good, please sit.

117
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,310
Okay, question 3

118
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,640
The answer is A, sub key of A major.

119
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,260
Did 2 students come in?

120
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,740
He's gone!

121
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,710
You're a standup guy!

122
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,310
Are you new?

123
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,250
Yeah, music class!

124
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm Bob, he's Lance.

125
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,350
We're in the rugby team.

126
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,820
He's the captain because he's old.

127
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,660
What're you talking about!

128
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,490
I gave my youth to rugby!

129
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,130
I've chosen this long
and arduous path

130
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,370
because the school needs me!

131
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,700
Got it?

132
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,840
Pay attention when I'm talking!

133
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,410
Let's go! You don't even study music!

134
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,720
Come watch us play next week, bye!

135
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,350
- Leaving now, bye! - Bye!

136
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,410
The coach is so dumb!

137
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,660
Stupid!

138
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,330
Really dumb!

139
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,570
Did I scare you?

140
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,000
You scared me!

141
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,600
Why weren't you in class?

142
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,970
I was practicing!

143
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,410
Why? You miss me?

144
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,110
Yeah!

145
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,550
I miss your music!

146
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,690
But I miss you...

147
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,690
Your music!

148
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,050
The weather is so nice today.

149
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,930
The weather is so nice today.

150
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,680
Come here!

151
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,190
Crouch!

152
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,430
Crouch, now!

153
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,030
Let's go!

154
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,570
How many people in your family?

155
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,740
My family? Just me and my Mom.

156
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,340
What about you?

157
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,540
Just me and my Dad.

158
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,040
Just me and my Dad.

159
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,550
Stop copying me!

160
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,620
It's true though.

161
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,080
What does your Dad do?

162
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,490
You don't know?

163
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,480
How would I know?

164
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,690
Never mind then.

165
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,230
What's so secretive about that?

166
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,730
You're not the only one with secrets.

167
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,170
So tasty!

168
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,840
I've never had this.

169
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,640
Really? Then have more!

170
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,420
Cheers!

171
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,150
Nobody cheers with ice creams!

172
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,010
Jay is gonna start!!

173
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,550
Hurry, or we'll miss it!

174
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,290
Hey, you're supposed to...

175
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,560
keep the school lively!

176
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,930
Let's follow the chicks!

177
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,330
The new guy is going to challenge Howe.

178
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,800
What a brave thing to do.

179
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,710
Let's applaud to that!

180
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,680
What're they doing?

181
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,880
Piano battle, don't you know?

182
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,720
Ladies, do you all know me?

183
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,960
Mr. Ice!

184
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,760
That's right! And this is Howe.

185
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,190
Do you all know his nickname?

186
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,190
Prince of piano.

187
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,330
Right, because

188
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,510
there isn't one song he can't play!

189
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,540
And no one can compare to him.

190
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,040
What Prince of piano.

191
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,510
- Out of my way! - Okay!

192
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,910
Without further a due,

193
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,050
let's begin with our piano battle!

194
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,770
Whoa, turning black keys to white keys!

195
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,720
New guy, did you listen carefully?

196
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,950
Don't you miss a key now!

197
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,660
Not bad! You didn't miss one single key!

198
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,900
Looks like we need something harder.

199
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,470
Chopin Waltz? That's too easy.

200
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,680
I knew it wasn't going to be that easy.

201
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,520
Come on!

202
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,660
Hey, keep up!

203
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,070
I said keep up, not stand up!

204
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,910
Isn't he cute?

205
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,580
Even Chopin didn't know this part!

206
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,480
Aren't you all lucky to hear that!

207
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,110
Howe's improvisation is brilliant!

208
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,410
New guy!

209
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,620
That's my friend.

210
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,150
It's going to be a good show today!

211
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,160
Howe, keep up...

212
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,320
The battle today is just brilliant!

213
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,530
Let's give them a round of applause!

214
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,700
Okay, back to class!

215
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,340
I'm a man of my words, here.

216
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,470
You're really giving it to him? It's rare!

217
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,540
Thanks!

218
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,110
- That was good! - Okay!

219
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,010
See you in class.

220
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,330
Why do you do that?

221
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,970
I can have a heart attack, you know?

222
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,810
Hungry!

223
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,880
Very hungry!

224
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,640
You like to scare people from the back!

225
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,510
That's because I like your back.

226
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,360
You played well yesterday.

227
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,190
You were there?

228
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,490
Yeah, I didn't want to distract you.

229
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,340
How can you? No girls can distract me!

230
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,440
I can still play smoothly!

231
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,210
Don't be mad!

232
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,020
I'm just kidding.

233
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,790
Why did you battle yesterday?

234
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,620
For this egg!

235
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,090
That's a secret!

236
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,930
Come on!

237
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,070
Jay, Bob and I

238
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,670
are playing for the welcome party,

239
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,970
you played well yesterday,

240
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,010
how about I count you in?

241
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,480
Sure!

242
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,120
Then it's a deal! Stick to your words now!

243
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,880
What deal?

244
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,060
Jay, you come here too!

245
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,530
See you in the piano room!

246
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,740
Stand straight!

247
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,050
Who said you can eat here?

248
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,610
Does this look like a place to eat?

249
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,480
Would you jog in a cafeteria?

250
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,790
Why don't you tuck in your shirt?

251
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,620
What kind of belt is this?

252
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,860
You think you're a singer?

253
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,470
Is that how to wear a tie?

254
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,310
If you don't cut your hair by tomorrow,

255
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,440
I'll cut it for you!

256
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,470
Girls like it!

257
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,580
Girls like bad appearance?

258
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,750
Got a smoke?

259
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,450
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

260
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,720
Can I have one?

261
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,630
I've got a lighter.

262
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,430
It's okay.

263
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,930
It's been a long time.

264
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,070
Yeah.

265
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,970
Why do you have cigarettes??

266
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,450
8 smokes, 8 laps! Go now!

267
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,860
What kind of friends have you made?

268
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,260
Friends who smoke?

269
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,570
Go now!

270
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,020
Trying to scare me again?

271
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,390
Are they your friends?

272
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,350
Yeah.

273
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,190
They don't look like your friends.

274
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,590
I don't look like your friend.

275
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,960
You're special, I'm ordinary.

276
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,760
I think you're special too!

277
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,970
Being able to meet you has been incredible.

278
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,740
Really?

279
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,000
If I'm a friend to you,

280
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,110
then tell me why are you so mysterious?

281
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,410
I'll tell you if you can catch up to me.

282
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,790
You like to play single-handed.

283
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,700
Because I want to hold your hand
with the other.

284
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,620
I heard 4 hands playing,

285
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,390
but you're alone?

286
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,060
I played so fast,

287
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,900
you thought there are 2 people.

288
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,680
You students! Unbelievable.

289
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,110
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

290
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,390
A good pianist can get away with things.

291
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,200
Because I'm a good student,
so teachers like me.

292
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,500
Yeah, right!

293
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:21,310
That's Chopin's lover.
They were together for 10 years.

294
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,240
But eventually parted.

295
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:29,180
To have each other, 10 years is plenty.

296
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,780
Is there something on your mind?

297
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,560
I don't know,

298
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,990
maybe I'll tell you someday.

299
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,830
Just cherish our moments together.

300
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,040
Sure!

301
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,440
Let's go!

302
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,110
Where?

303
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,450
Cherish our moments together!

304
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,750
So fast!

305
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,190
Go!

306
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,730
Don't ride so fast!

307
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,300
I'll be home too soon!

308
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,270
Really? Alright then.

309
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,380
It's beautiful!

310
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,390
Want to stop here?

311
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,400
Have you been busy lately?

312
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,870
Dinner is just ready

313
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,670
when I get home.

314
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,480
Don't you think that tastes better?

315
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:14,290
You're dating someone, right?

316
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,130
No, just out with Lance and Bob.

317
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,040
Bob and Lance! I knew it!

318
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,540
They are bad people,

319
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,300
don't make those friends!

320
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,280
They smoke, don't listen to music!

321
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,180
They don't listen to music so they're bad?

322
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,210
Of course!

323
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,320
Don't make it hard for me!

324
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,120
What's so hard about that?

325
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,390
You're my only son,

326
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,190
I'm just worried about you.

327
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,660
Answer properly!

328
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,730
Okay

329
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,340
And don't make those friends, understand?

330
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,440
I'm done!

331
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,380
Are you on a diet?

332
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,060
Look at this,

333
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,160
misplacing the CD's.

334
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,060
Pay more attention!

335
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,330
Don't daydream all the time, be proper.

336
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,800
Be someone ordinary!

337
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,050
I've listened to music for decades.

338
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,660
Young people shouldn't think so much.

339
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,600
I didn't!

340
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,840
How long haven't you listened to music?

341
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,630
If I haven't,

342
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,540
how would I misplace the CD?

343
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,520
Music has many different forms.

344
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,590
We can use different instruments,

345
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,350
to mix and
have different types of feelings.

346
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,600
Like just a while ago,
we had piano and flute.

347
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,930
Let's have one of the music majors

348
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,330
come up and do an example for us.

349
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,570
Sky, how about you?

350
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,510
Sky, did you hear what I said?

351
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,250
How about you?

352
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,100
Jay, want to shoot some hoops later?

353
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,240
I'll pass!

354
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,720
I'll return the book tomorrow!

355
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,750
Okay!

356
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,880
Later! Bye!

357
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,080
Sure, bye!

358
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,880
Bye, Sky!

359
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,020
Can you give me a ride home?

360
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,760
Your bike, give me ride home?

361
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,830
Never mind, I'm just kidding, bye!

362
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,600
Bye!

363
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,830
Can you give me a ride home?

364
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,110
Sure, come on! You're such a copycat!

365
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,140
You're so bad!

366
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,080
What?

367
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,310
Someone missed class today!

368
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,710
I was practicing in the piano room!

369
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,720
Sure? Then I'll take you some place.

370
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,120
No class later?

371
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,820
Jump aboard or I'll take Sky!

372
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,650
Okay, let's go!

373
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,810
Quit messing,
you said it was only for 3 days!

374
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,710
It's been 2 weeks,

375
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,680
I'm gonna get hell from my boss!

376
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,350
What? Alright, I'll have a look.

377
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,130
This is my favorite song.

378
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,370
Well? Do you like it?

379
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,300
Keep the change!

380
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,570
Thanks!

381
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,610
We're not going inside, hurry!

382
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,840
What's wrong?

383
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,490
It's asthma, I just need a short break.

384
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,220
Don't scare me now.

385
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,730
So, I can't kiss a boy.

386
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,900
Can't hold hands,

387
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,570
can't do anything too exciting.

388
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,760
Really?

389
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:07,960
Just messing with you, I feel better.

390
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,640
I'll tell you a secret.

391
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,710
Okay.

392
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,080
I...

393
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,960
counted 108 steps
from class to the piano room.

394
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,200
That's silly.

395
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,000
Forget that I've said it then!

396
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,100
Fine!

397
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,800
I've counted too!

398
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,470
It's 5 steps from here to you!

399
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,440
How would you know?

400
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,390
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

401
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,330
You almost had me!

402
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,530
Such a silly game!

403
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:37,650
It's Swan, this is so hard to find!

404
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,280
You did the piano battle

405
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,130
to get this for me?

406
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,260
Yeah.

407
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,970
You don't have many friends, right?

408
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,100
Nobody likes me.

409
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,370
How can that be?

410
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,820
Do you like me?

411
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,960
I like you.

412
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,260
The world is a peaceful lullaby.

413
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,160
But I insist on my manhood.

414
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,800
Face all my enemies with an iron will.

415
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,900
Love you tenderly under the moon.

416
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,700
Men do not play sissy games.

417
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,980
Life is like calm scenery.

418
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,710
I insist with the shade of my manhood,

419
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,440
to give heat to my brothers,

420
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,680
and leave the chest for the girls' tears.

421
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,080
I'm a total man!

422
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,160
Watch out, girls!

423
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,590
Adjusting my manly breath,

424
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,460
shaking my manly hairstyle,

425
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,190
open my manly eyes,

426
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,370
to give you a sweet face.

427
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,510
I'll charm you with my manly smile!

428
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,650
Men with biceps of a mountain,

429
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,250
men with Ioneliness of wolves,

430
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,080
men with heated passion,

431
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,090
men with warm hearts,

432
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,480
that man is me.

433
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,020
Watch out girls!

434
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,220
That man is me,

435
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,830
and you've fallen for me!

436
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,740
Do you know
they're tearing this place down?

437
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,980
When?

438
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,250
Graduation day!

439
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,190
Then do you want to learn it?

440
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,890
That song I played the first time
you met me?

441
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,030
You're really going to teach me?

442
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,430
Finally?

443
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,770
Do you have to play so fast?

444
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,650
That's how fast I play before I go home.

445
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,080
That's hard to remember.

446
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,250
Don't play this in the old piano room.

447
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,790
Why?

448
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,860
It sounds bad on the old piano.

449
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,060
I thought it's

450
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,250
because Sky usually plays there.

451
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,520
So you don't want me there.

452
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,290
I'll play you a song too!

453
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,630
Now?

454
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,810
Not now!

455
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,670
On graduation day, I'll play for you!

456
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,610
Alright, it's a deal!

457
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,640
Aren't we too old for this?

458
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,550
123, Push!

459
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,780
Push, push.

460
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,910
That looks nice, a gift from you boyfriend?

461
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,250
I don't have a boyfriend.

462
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,220
Oh, you don't have a boyfriend.

463
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,600
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

464
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,200
Can you sign for me?

465
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,440
Sure!

466
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,470
- You guys are so good!
- We're just okay.

467
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,740
Thank you!

468
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,210
Next week is the championship,
want to come?

469
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,440
Can we? Thank you

470
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,210
Of course!

471
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,350
You're so cool! Bye!

472
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,820
Bye!

473
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,450
You're so cool!

474
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,690
Hey, Jay!

475
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,300
Men don't play sissy games!

476
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,060
Jay!

477
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,210
Not bad!
Girls from our class ask you to sign!

478
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,570
That's nothing!

479
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,540
You have to get use to it
when you hang with us!

480
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,280
Got a question!

481
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,710
Shoot!

482
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,180
Have you athletes heard of asthma?

483
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,480
What are you? Stupid?

484
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,750
- That's so easy, bye now!
- Bye!

485
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,690
That's so easy, it's a sort of cold.

486
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,020
Bull! You're not even close!

487
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,160
It's a sport injury!

488
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,020
Really?

489
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:25,920
Yeah!

490
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,260
I better ask someone else.

491
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,400
A sport injury?

492
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,400
Yeah!

493
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,000
You're back!

494
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,670
You play well when I'm not around.

495
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,260
Just learned it!

496
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,800
From who?

497
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,730
None of your business.

498
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,280
What's good for asthma?

499
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:21,250
Dancing, dancing's good for asthma.

500
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,720
Crap! What's really good for asthma?

501
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,920
Food makes you crap,

502
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,960
dancing doesn't. And...

503
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,820
Dance with me, and I'll tell you!

504
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,760
How about it?

505
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,740
Dad, are you done?

506
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,940
Just about!

507
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,410
What's good for asthma?

508
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,410
AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS DOCTOR AWAY

509
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,050
By the way,
the market lady gave us some apple!

510
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,420
So it's apples?

511
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:41,060
Yeah

512
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,760
Don't play with me!

513
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,130
Apple!

514
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:51,240
How do you turn this on?

515
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,530
York, what else do you want to listen to?

516
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,670
It's class time,
I'll play for you next time!

517
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:32,970
So many apples!

518
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:35,080
Want some?

519
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,410
Can I?

520
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,320
No! 15 apples for 15 days!

521
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,890
Look at how long you haven't been to class.

522
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,760
What does that have to do with apples?

523
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,950
I bought them for you!

524
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,690
I'm like a fool everyday!

525
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,360
I brought all these,
but you're not even here.

526
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,540
Give them to Sky then!

527
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,640
Sky? Sure,

528
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,910
I have so many of them anyways.

529
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,670
What the? Are you mad?

530
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,550
When I'm not in school,

531
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,720
will you like other girls?

532
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,120
Yeah, 15 other girls.

533
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,060
Hey, help me out!

534
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,740
Bach and Vivaldi

535
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,020
Classical, there's Mozart, Beethoven,

536
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,690
over there we have the most famous one.

537
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,690
Rain, Rain!

538
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:20,450
What's wrong?

539
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,560
I'm sorry!

540
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,690
Rain ran, Rain ran away!

541
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,770
Where?

542
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,800
Rain ran away!

543
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,610
Jay!

544
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,640
Rain's mad!

545
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,360
Thank you!

546
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,170
Excuse me!

547
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,460
Are you okay?

548
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,100
Yeah.

549
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,340
Don't you have anything to say to me?

550
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:27,280
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry.

551
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,950
Stop playing, you'll make me cry!

552
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,810
Dad, can you cut it out?

553
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,210
What?

554
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,310
Cut it out!

555
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,370
Cut it out, just leave me alone.

556
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,630
What's wrong?

557
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,330
Just tell Dad, okay?

558
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,970
Nothing!

559
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:07,980
You're my only son, I'm worried about you.

560
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,980
Tell me what's on your mind.

561
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,860
I'll go cook!

562
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,030
Don't cook, it's a day off!

563
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,800
Let's eat out, okay?

564
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,030
What do you want?

565
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,390
Let's go out and eat!

566
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,860
Be happy!

567
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,350
Alright, alright! Who're you looking for?

568
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,750
I'm looking for Rain!

569
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,810
Not so loud!

570
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,520
She's resting, you'll disturb her.

571
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,820
Why isn't she in class?

572
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,930
She dropped out!

573
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,840
Her asthma's acting up and needs rest.

574
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,530
Then...

575
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,460
Sky!

576
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,190
I'm sorry about last time.

577
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,830
It's okay, it's in the past.

578
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:16,200
After five months...

579
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,740
Okay, so these 2 starts to cave in.

580
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,210
They'll cave in from right here.

581
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,440
Then the two will connect.

582
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,910
Now think in 3 dimensions,

583
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,750
now there are 2 holes.

584
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,820
This one here is the mouth.

585
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,310
Did you ride your bike today?

586
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,790
No.

587
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,060
Will you give me a ride
if you had the bike?

588
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,160
Sure.

589
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,800
Abalone? Is that abalone?

590
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,100
We don't have abalone.

591
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:49,560
Why don't you just wait outside?

592
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:51,430
I've waited so long,

593
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,310
I'm hungry!

594
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,950
The usual, right?

595
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,280
- Yeah! - Ok!

596
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:01,440
Ok, thanks!

597
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,140
How have you been?

598
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,080
I've been okay!

599
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,190
- Sure? - Yeah

600
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,620
- bye now! - Be careful!

601
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,810
Okay, bye!

602
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,230
Old pianos are hard to play.

603
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,100
Really?

604
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,470
You like to come here often.

605
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,780
I have a lot of memories here.

606
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,240
Too bad it'll be torn

607
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,910
down on graduation day.

608
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,290
I know.

609
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,240
You're kind of mysterious.

610
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,720
Really?

611
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,390
You can tell me what's on your mind.

612
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,660
Okay.

613
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,460
Can I get a ride home after school?

614
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,580
Don't you have this album already?

615
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,720
Yeah.

616
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:16,520
Welcome to the 84th graduation ceremony

617
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,120
for TanJiang Art school.

618
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,650
Throughout this year,

619
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:24,320
watching outstanding graduates completing

620
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,830
this phase of their education.

621
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:28,870
Nervous?

622
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,220
A little.

623
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:32,730
It'll bring good luck!

624
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,630
I'll give this back after the concert.

625
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,140
Okay, good luck!

626
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,620
Come sit!

627
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,170
Rain! Rain!

628
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,080
And don't disappear anymore, okay?

629
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,690
Okay!

630
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,030
What're you doing?

631
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,610
Wait for me in class!

632
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,710
You're a disgrace! Get back there!

633
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,550
Lunatic!

634
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:19,960
It really brought good luck!

635
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:21,650
What're you doing?

636
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:23,700
- Where did you go?
- It's over, now you come back?

637
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,020
What's with this class, a refugee camp?

638
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:52,720
There's nothing here?

639
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:55,870
They should get a grant,
only pens are rulers!

640
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:57,600
Look at that!

641
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:58,630
What?

642
01:03:58,840 --> 01:03:59,770
That!

643
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:04,300
Hello, Jay!

644
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,240
What're you doing?

645
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,670
Cleaning your classroom!

646
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,440
- A lot of good stuff!
- Don't say...

647
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:11,980
we didn't take care of you!

648
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,150
Here, this is for you, don't forget us!

649
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:16,550
Let's go!

650
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:17,910
To the next room!

651
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,350
Did you see a girl in my class?

652
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,930
Girl?

653
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:24,890
Who?

654
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,430
The one dancing with me at the party!

655
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,060
Dancing?

656
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:30,760
Are you nuts?

657
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,700
You were dancing alone!

658
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,730
You totally stole my thunder!

659
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,500
Why aren't you in class today?

660
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,040
I was practicing!

661
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,280
Someone missed class today!

662
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,410
I was practicing in the piano room!

663
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,150
No! 15 apples for 15 days!

664
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,020
Look at how long you haven't been to class.

665
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,120
The one dancing with me at the party!

666
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,320
You were dancing alone!

667
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,870
Next time you need a dance partner,
just ask me.

668
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:11,940
What's your name?

669
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,010
I told you already.

670
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:16,870
I heard 4 hands playing,

671
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,570
but you're alone?

672
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,250
You students! Unbelievable!

673
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,040
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

674
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,300
Being able to meet you has been incredible.

675
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,050
(I'm Rain!)

676
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,620
(Where are you?)

677
01:06:57,650 --> 01:07:00,480
(I love you!)

678
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:30,270
(Do you love me?)

679
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,460
Granny!

680
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:54,870
Granny!

681
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,300
Granny!

682
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:58,760
Anyone there?

683
01:07:59,140 --> 01:07:59,970
Who're you looking for?

684
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,170
I'm looking for Rain, is she home?

685
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,080
The door's not locked, come in.

686
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,130
Try to be quiet,
Rain is listening to music.

687
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:31,590
Where did she go?

688
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,700
This is her favorite song.

689
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:50,240
One day, she told me:

690
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:54,790
She met a boy who loves this song too!

691
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:19,010
Don't touch Rain's stuff!

692
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:44,040
Rain, Mom should've believed you!

693
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,170
What?

694
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:20,500
It was 1979,

695
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:25,140
Rain is a 3rd year student.

696
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,910
She plays the piano very well, and...

697
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:33,220
she is a very talented student.

698
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,420
But, she was always daydreaming...

699
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,540
Rain.

700
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,430
We've sat here for so long already,

701
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:56,000
can you tell me now why are you crying?

702
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,110
I'm getting kind of tired.

703
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:05,780
Will you believe me?

704
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,180
Of course I will.

705
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:12,290
I'm just afraid you don't trust me.

706
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,690
Then I'll tell you a story, okay?

707
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,800
One day...

708
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,990
Secret...

709
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:59,970
Follow the notes upon ajourney,

710
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,370
At first sight marks one's destiny.

711
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,280
Once the voyage comes to an end,

712
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:11,840
Return lies within hasty keys.

713
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,200
Because I want to see him at first sight,

714
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:10,600
Excuse me.

715
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,900
So only he can see me.

716
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,310
Excuse me, I'm wondering...

717
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,110
Excuse me!

718
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,710
Excuse me, I'm wondering...

719
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:35,820
Now we will be learning

720
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:38,090
a new formula.

721
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,270
Basically at the circumference,

722
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:44,800
and any value outside of it,

723
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:46,770
there're 2 values for M,

724
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,040
if you can only find 1,

725
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,670
that means...

726
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,770
Sorry I'm late.

727
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,570
Why was he a musical genius?

728
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:24,440
We were in the same class,

729
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,410
Hey, pay attention in class!

730
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:28,850
January 18th, 1999

731
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:31,850
just that we're 20 years apart.

732
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,230
Stop!

733
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:50,570
97, 98, 99, 100, 101

734
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:55,840
102, 103, 104, 105

735
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:57,670
Because I want to see him at first sight,

736
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,220
I counted the distance
from piano room to class,

737
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,180
It's 108 steps.

738
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:07,860
B is augmented by 6 keys.

739
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:13,120
We are asked to find E...

740
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,460
But it was successful all the time.

741
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:31,040
I'll never forget how his back looks.

742
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,920
Those moments were hard to get!

743
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:55,570
York thought Rain was going back.

744
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:58,600
No, I'm here to see Jay.

745
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,940
I've made you fail.

746
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,830
Sky is here.

747
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:52,790
Rain! Rain!

748
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,200
Rain's gone! She's going home!

749
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:33,230
It could be...

750
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,300
He has no taste, that's right!

751
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,340
That's how future boys are!

752
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,710
If I see him,

753
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,310
I'll slap him silly!

754
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,940
Naughty! Naughty!

755
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:50,440
York!

756
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:51,380
Yes!

757
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:54,460
That's too obvious,
it's no longer eavesdropping!

758
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,260
Yes sir! I'll go sweep there!

759
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,590
Be careful, he's a pervert!

760
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,030
Rain...

761
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:11,430
He's just not worth it,

762
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,030
forget about him.

763
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,270
If anything bothers you,

764
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,410
you can talk to me, okay?

765
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:40,360
I won't go see him anymore.

766
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:47,180
Can you keep this for me?

767
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:58,940
And one more thing,

768
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:05,660
don't mention this to anyone else.

769
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,260
Then can you keep this secret?

770
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:14,860
Of course!

771
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:27,710
Rain! Don't think so much!

772
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:42,960
We've been concerned about Rain.

773
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:45,520
So don't you worry,

774
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,000
Students, teachers,

775
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:53,370
The school really cares for her.

776
01:21:55,610 --> 01:22:00,240
Mostly, we need parents to help us out.

777
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:06,890
You're the head of the class.

778
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,690
You should watch over her, understand?

779
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:19,390
Don't tell other students about this!

780
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,990
(Lose your virginity
20 years in the future?)

781
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,110
What's the point of being
such a good student?

782
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:05,750
It's a shame she's messed up!

783
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,480
That's beauty that's wasted!

784
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:12,410
Let's talk about
what the graduation performance.

785
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,450
We can just ask Rain to do it!

786
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:18,090
Do what?
Travel through time to look for love?

787
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,890
Alright, stop messing with her!

788
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,540
What? Can't take ajoke?

789
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:36,470
Don't pick on her!

790
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:38,670
Go do your garbage!

791
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:42,790
Rain?

792
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:09,210
Rain, you're really not going to class?

793
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:26,490
Take some medication then,
I'll leave them here.

794
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:53,680
(Psychiatrist Dr. Chang)

795
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:54,810
Who is he?

796
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:58,810
He's the boy I told you about!

797
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:05,560
How does Mom look in 20 years?

798
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,400
The locks were changed, I couldn't get in.

799
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:22,310
But Mom is probably as beautiful.

800
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:35,980
It's all your fault!

801
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:40,590
Saying that music
will make her more elegant!

802
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:45,700
Look at how sick she is!

803
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:52,600
What will we do?

804
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:01,520
(Psychiatrist Dr. Chang)

805
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:12,090
Rain, I'll get you some water.

806
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:24,600
Did she mention that boy?

807
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,970
Yes, thank you for visiting her.

808
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,780
She'll be really happy to see you.

809
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:33,040
It's the graduation ceremony today,

810
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,610
I hope she can be there.

811
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:36,210
I'll get her.

812
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,460
Rain, look who's here?

813
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:54,100
Rain, it's graduation day.

814
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:57,460
I wish you can come, okay?

815
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,230
Do you know
they're tearing this place down?

816
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:02,180
When?

817
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:03,610
Graduation day!

818
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,340
I'll play for you!

819
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:15,520
Look who's back!

820
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,260
Take a picture for me and Rain.

821
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:27,700
Look here, 1, 2,3, cheese!

822
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:29,730
But things didn't turn out

823
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,540
like I expected.

824
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:37,580
Me too!

825
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,370
Look here, 1, 2,3, cheese!

826
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,330
What're you doing?

827
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:45,450
Wait for me in class!

828
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:52,380
Gift from your boyfriend?

829
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:53,680
I don't have a boyfriend.

830
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,720
That was our last picture together.

831
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:46,020
Why do you ask? Have you heard of her?

832
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:52,830
Oh and...

833
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:19,950
Jay?

834
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:24,700
Don't play this in the old piano room.

835
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:26,630
Why?

836
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,560
It sounds bad on the old piano.

837
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,250
Ready over there?

838
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:57,360
Yeah!

839
01:33:57,630 --> 01:34:00,260
Hurry up! Boss is rushing!

840
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,030
No one left?

841
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:08,870
Sure?

842
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,570
I've checked a million times!

843
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:15,080
What about the piano?

844
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:17,480
The principal said they'll get new ones!

845
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,080
Start here!

846
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,080
Come over here!

847
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:36,250
Do you have to play so fast?

848
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,870
That's how fast I play before I go home.

849
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,600
(Return lies within hasty keys.)

850
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:09,730
(Even if we'll never see each other gain,)

851
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:10,900
(even if you forget me,)

852
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,160
(I just want to tell you a secret,)

853
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:13,200
(I love you.)

854
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,630
(Rain)

855
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:27,410
