1
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:04,250
Are you seriously
trying to rope-a-dope me?

2
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,875
That's an old man's move.

3
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:08,250
- I am old man.
- No, you're not.

4
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:09,668
But you box like one.

5
00:01:13,126 --> 00:01:14,125
Not bad.

6
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:16,001
Come on. Keep your guard up. Come on.

7
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:21,918
Come on, Ben. You're telegraphin'.

8
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:24,793
Mr. President.

9
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,042
Ten minutes, sir.

10
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,001
Thank you.

11
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:29,834
Thank you, Forbes.

12
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,251
Hey.

13
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:35,542
You're not supposed
to hit the president.

14
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:37,459
Yeah. I know.

15
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:40,542
I'll get you next time.

16
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:42,126
Yeah. I'm sure you will.

17
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:46,543
Perimeter's secure.

18
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:53,875
Weather's getting worse out there,
but we're advised it's drivable.

19
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:55,543
Post vehicles to stand by.

20
00:02:01,418 --> 00:02:03,542
Good evening, Mr. President.
Five minutes, sir.

21
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:04,208
Thanks, Mike.

22
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,542
- Evening, ma'am.
- Merry Christmas, Mike.

23
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,875
The president gets us off our
dependence on foreign oil...

24
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:11,168
yet he cannot help
a wife choose an earring.

25
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:15,001
Uh, small one.
Classic look for a classic lady.

26
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,459
Good chat.

27
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:19,251
Kiss ass.

28
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:23,209
Well, I love you both
but I am going with the long.

29
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:28,375
I hate going to these fundraisers.
Why don't you go for me?

30
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:31,751
Oh, honey. You're perfect.

31
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,209
God forbid people know we kiss.

32
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,626
Now the real bloodbath starts
when your mom catches you playing this.

33
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:55,626
You suck.

34
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,251
You suck worse. Come on.

35
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,250
Well,
he likes it when you call him Dries...

36
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:03,417
because it makes him feel like,
I don't know, you're pals or something.

37
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:06,167
Hey, love.
You wanna open a gift before we go?

38
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:08,750
It's not love, and I'm gonna wait
'til everyone else is here.

39
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:10,417
Keep forgetting. Sorry.

40
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:13,208
Do I really have to come with you guys?
I mean, I've been on so many.

41
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,000
Re-election's hard work, buddy.

42
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,292
Sorry, pal.

43
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:17,834
Can I at least ride with Mike?

44
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:21,876
You'll have to ask him. He's the boss.

45
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:24,626
Mike, do I get to ride with you?

46
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:28,084
Okay. All right.

47
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,125
Okay, Diaz.
You're riding in the Beast tonight.

48
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,209
Merry Christmas.

49
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:36,375
Thank you, sir.

50
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:38,958
You okay to stay back
and watch the fort tonight?

51
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,042
You kidding me? In this weather?

52
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:43,417
Get out of this monkey suit,
sit by the fire,

53
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:45,958
watch "Breaking Bad?" Fine by me.

54
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,876
My own little retirement party?

55
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,168
Leave the babysitter alone, all right?

56
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,750
- Are you going to wear that hat?
- I like the hat.

57
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,917
I think it's fine.
It's age appropriate.

58
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:59,793
- You take it off when you get inside.
- No, the girls dig it.

59
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,917
Mustang, this is Big Top.

60
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:03,626
Bringing out the full package.

61
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:05,084
Let's go.

62
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,126
Package is on the move.

63
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:33,418
ETA to Morgan residence, 22 minutes.

64
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:35,293
Keep it tight, everybody.

65
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:41,625
Hey, Connor. Come on.
Scoot back. Put your belt on.

66
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:42,625
What if I don't?

67
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:45,251
Then O'Neil here's gonna punch
in the nuts. Come on.

68
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,667
You keeping 180 degrees awareness?

69
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:51,500
I thought you said it was 360.

70
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:52,833
Yeah, I was just checkin'.

71
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,750
Setting me up is what you're doing.

72
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,750
All right. So, how many emergency exits

73
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:59,208
- in the West Wing?
- 8.

74
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,875
How many feet from the Oval Office
to the PEOC elevator?

75
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,500
116.

76
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:04,833
From doors closing in the elevator,

77
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,375
how long does it
take to get to the PEOC?

78
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:07,458
Four minutes.

79
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,583
Security cameras? How many have audio?

80
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:11,042
Only the ones in the common areas.

81
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,917
- Not bad.
- Kid's got it, huh?

82
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,792
Yeah, we're gonna make
a Secret Service agent outta you yet.

83
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:17,667
You just need to remember
to keep your seatbelt on.

84
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:18,626
That's right.

85
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:30,543
Gosh, it's really coming down.

86
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:39,126
I've been thinking about shaving my head.

87
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,293
That sounds good.

88
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,209
It's getting worse out there. Bring it down to five.

89
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,709
Merry Christmas, Mr. President.

90
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:54,751
You shouldn't have.

91
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,542
My God. It's my grandfather's watch.

92
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:07,001
How did you find this?

93
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:09,543
Just have my ways.

94
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:11,167
Thank you.

95
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,668
You're just welcome.

96
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,709
Now, let's talk about that shaved head idea.

97
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:19,167
You were listening.

98
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:19,833
You didn't think I was listening,

99
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,334
- did you?
- Very clever.

100
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,667
You ever been to a billionaire's
Christmas party before, Diaz?

101
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:30,292
- No, sir.
- They're over-rated.

102
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:31,293
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,209
Oh, my gosh.

104
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:35,959
Look what I found.

105
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,293
Where'd that come from?

106
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:40,334
Merry Christmas.

107
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:54,876
Stop, stop, stop!

108
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,043
Hey, Connor, stay right there!

109
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,042
Clear communications, it's Diaz.

110
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,000
- First lady's injured.
- Connor.

111
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,292
Get some weight on the back!
O'Neil, get on the back!

112
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:19,709
I'm gonna get this door!

113
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,501
- Don't anybody move inside! Don't move!
- Mike! Maggie!

114
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,333
- Sir?
- Seatbelt's stuck!

115
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:35,458
Sir, get out of the car!
I'll take care of her!

116
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,167
Keep your weight on the back, O'Neil!

117
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:39,125
- Hold it back!
- Roma, open the fucking door!

118
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,083
It's jammed! It's fucking jammed!
Pull her out that side!

119
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:43,958
It's going down! it's going down!

120
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,876
O'Neil, goddamn it!
Hold it down! Hold it down!

121
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:52,001
- Mike, it's going!
- Hold it back!

122
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,584
Mike, take Maggie!

123
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:56,708
Shit. Sir, I'm sorry!

124
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,418
- Watch out, it's going!
- Maggie!

125
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:01,251
No, Mike!

126
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:10,709
No!

127
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,334
Mom!

128
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:47,876
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:50,876
Yeah.

130
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:54,876
And I don't like going to
barbecues by myself, you know?

131
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:06,000
North Korean maneuvers along the DMZ
continue to ring alarm bells...

132
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:09,000
throughout Pacific markets,
even as President Asher...

133
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:12,042
is set to meet this afternoon
with South Korean...

134
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,709
Babe, we out of coffee?

135
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:17,376
I don't know. Are we?

136
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,001
All right, just...
I thought you said that anything...

137
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,876
You were saying?

138
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,418
I was saying, I'll get some more coffee.

139
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:34,043
Great.

140
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,333
So, how was the barbecue I missed?

141
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,917
It was actually kind of fun.
You might have enjoyed it.

142
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:41,918
Yeah?

143
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:44,958
Paula's got this new boyfriend
who's very sweet...

144
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,750
but he's working in the same department
as her ex, Alex.

145
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:49,042
Remember Alex?

146
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:52,333
Anyway,
Alex ended up showing up at the party...

147
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:56,501
which was really weird for Paula,
who was...

148
00:10:58,126 --> 00:10:59,459
overwhelmed.

149
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:04,208
Mike, you're not listening to me.

150
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:05,167
I was listening.

151
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:05,833
You were talking about

152
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,875
- patty's boyfriend and she's...
- No.

153
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,043
Paula and Paula's boyfriend.
You've met Paula.

154
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:13,918
It's okay, Mike.
We'll talk about it later.

155
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:15,793
All right, babe. I'm sorry.

156
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:20,583
But I tell you what.
Why don't we go see a movie tonight?

157
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,293
Okay? Just the two of us.

158
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:27,333
Or you can bring Paula and Patty
and their boyfriends.

159
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:28,876
You know what I think we should do?

160
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:33,125
I think we should take that holiday
that we've been talking about.

161
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,375
All right?

162
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:37,543
You, me, the ocean.

163
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:41,168
Come on. It'll be like the honeymoon
we never had.

164
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,001
We didn't have a honeymoon?

165
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:04,668
Thanks.

166
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:07,293
So, how was your Fourth?

167
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,583
My fourth what?

168
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,583
Fourth of July. Don't be an ass.

169
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:13,958
Some people do take holidays, you know.

170
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, it was quiet.
You know, we stayed in.

171
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:17,959
We?

172
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:21,375
Okay. I stayed in. She went out.

173
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:22,958
I'm shocked.

174
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,167
Ms. Jacobs?

175
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,125
- Good morning.
- Director.

176
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:26,208
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey, Roma.

177
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:27,500
- Good to see you, partner.
- How's the family?

178
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,125
- The kids are good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

179
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:30,376
- O'Neil.
- Hey, Banning.

180
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:31,875
You're looking sharp.

181
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,500
So, we missed you for, poker,
uh, last week. Where were you?

182
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,333
Missed taking your money.

183
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,626
Yeah, I know.
I've been working the late shift.

184
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,834
Yeah, non-stop action over there
at the Treasury.

185
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,792
You gotta do what you gotta do, right?

186
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,917
Yeah.
You guys got a big day coming up, huh?

187
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:46,667
You got the Koreans coming in?

188
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:49,167
Nah, I mean, you know.
Business as usual.

189
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,792
Hey, I wanted to introduce you.
This is Agent Jones.

190
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,375
You've heard of Mike Banning,
haven't you?

191
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:53,458
Yeah, yeah. The guy who told

192
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,418
the Speaker of the House
to go fuck himself.

193
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,042
Don't you guys have somewhere to be?

194
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:01,625
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

195
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,250
- Hey, Mike. Good seein' you.
- Yeah, you too.

196
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,167
- Come Thursday night, all right?
- Okay.

197
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:06,168
Seven o'clock.

198
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:11,001
Not getting any easier, huh?

199
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:12,584
No.

200
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:16,376
I want back in.

201
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,043
Desk job's killing me.

202
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:20,250
Mike.

203
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:22,500
Everybody knows you did the right thing
on that bridge.

204
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,626
Hell, even the president knows.

205
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:29,251
He just doesn't want to see you
and have to be reminded of it every day.

206
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:33,043
He never even stopped
to grieve properly.

207
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,709
Just, give it some time.

208
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,042
How's Connor?

209
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:42,667
President's son, misses his mom.

210
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:44,208
Hell of a gig.

211
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,958
Misses his buddy though.

212
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,251
Yeah, he's a good kid.

213
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:49,125
Is he still sneaking
around the White House,

214
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:50,417
making everybody crazy?

215
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,001
Oh, I wonder who taught him that.

216
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,708
You know, the first time you walked
into my office out of the darkness...

217
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,083
you needed therapy then.
Never mind now.

218
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:04,667
And you don't exactly
do yourself any favors.

219
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:05,917
Where are you going with this?

220
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:09,958
Mike. Look, you gotta learn
how to get back into the real world.

221
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,084
That's good, Jacobs.
Let me write that one down.

222
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,126
Hey, Jacobs.

223
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:22,792
Thanks.

224
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:24,126
I'll be in touch.

225
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:01,168
Hey, buddy. What do you think of this?

226
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,459
- Which one do you like?
- I don't know.

227
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,293
Okay, you take that one.
I'll take this one.

228
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,333
- Maggie! Maggie!
- I'll take care of her! Sir!

229
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,793
No! No, Mike!

230
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:58,876
Mr. Foss came in. Chest pains.
About an hour ago.

231
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,625
Hey, it's Leah.

232
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:07,834
You've reached my phone.
You know what to do.

233
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:09,668
Just checking in.

234
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:17,709
Listen, I'll call you later. Bye.

235
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,418
Get some fishing in.

236
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:26,167
Hit the bag together. Be fun.

237
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:27,917
I hate Camp David.

238
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:31,542
Do we really have to go?
Can't we go somewhere else?

239
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:33,709
You know, the beach?

240
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:36,334
Yeah.

241
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,501
The beach does kinda sound better.

242
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:48,334
Hey.

243
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,375
I've got three minutes.

244
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,208
Let's run down to the kitchen
and get some ice cream.

245
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,375
Yeah.

246
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:54,875
Chocolate chip or rocky road?

247
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:56,792
I'm gonna have rocky road
before you eat it all,

248
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:58,043
like you did the last time.

249
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:01,126
- I don't remember it that way.
- Yeah, you did.

250
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,376
Come in.

251
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:06,209
Mr. President, we're ready for you.

252
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:08,584
- Already?
- Yes, sir.

253
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,209
Sorry, buddy.

254
00:17:11,543 --> 00:17:12,709
It's okay, Dad.

255
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:15,084
All right.

256
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:17,543
I'll see you soon.

257
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:52,250
Minister Lee
is going to want you to issue

258
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:54,417
a joint statement, Mr. President...

259
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:57,000
threatening military action
to get the North Koreans...

260
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,250
to stand down from the border

261
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:01,708
and stop their missile tests.

262
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,584
Which I think we should give them.

263
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,625
Ruth?

264
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:10,167
Provided that the
North Koreans are rational...

265
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:11,959
which is dicey, at best.

266
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:16,083
We bluff. They call it. Then what?

267
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:17,793
Well, who says we'd be bluffing?

268
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,334
Personally,
I like to try to avoid a war.

269
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:23,793
Charlie?

270
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:27,459
I think I agree with Ruth on this one,
Mr. President.

271
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:30,833
Thank you for sitting in, Mr. Speaker.

272
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,918
- Yes, sir.
- I won't hold you up any longer.

273
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:45,793
- Hello, Mr. Speaker.
- Hello, Janie.

274
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,583
What time is Minister Lee due to arrive?

275
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,084
7:00 this evening.

276
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:09,001
Our guests have arrived.

277
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:33,875
Prime Minister Lee.

278
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,625
I'm Special Agent-in-Charge Roma.

279
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:37,208
I'd like to welcome you
to the White House, sir.

280
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:37,833
Thank you.

281
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:40,918
May I introduce my Head of Security
and Chief Aide, Mr. Park.

282
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:44,626
My pleasure.
Prime Minister, after you, please.

283
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:53,126
Agent Davis will be taking care
of your security team outside.

284
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:56,876
Prime Minister, if you would follow
Agent O'Neil, please?

285
00:20:58,209 --> 00:20:59,126
Ma'am?

286
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,208
Private sector looks good on you, Dave.

287
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:04,750
Yeah, something to look forward to.

288
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,708
Yeah. How've you been?

289
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,542
I'll tell you.
I miss the Secret Service.

290
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:09,959
Best years of my life.

291
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:12,417
It misses you too, old man.

292
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:13,876
I could still kick your ass.

293
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:16,584
At what? Dominos?

294
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,584
- It's good to see you, my friend.
- You, too.

295
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:33,917
Unidentified flight,

296
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,208
this is Flight Leader, U.S. Air
Force aircraft at your starboard wing.

297
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:38,918
You've entered restricted airspace.

298
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:40,417
Unidentified flight,

299
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:43,917
you must divert immediately
to vector 0-2-0. Acknowledge.

300
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:46,208
I'm sorry to have
disrupted your vacation.

301
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:47,668
Please. I'm glad you could come.

302
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:50,334
Mr. Lee, we have a mutual problem.

303
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:54,125
And I think together,
I'm confident we can find a solution.

304
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:57,001
Thank you, Mr. President.
That's why I'm here.

305
00:21:57,543 --> 00:22:00,458
As you know, North Korea
has a one million man standing army...

306
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:02,668
less than 50 kilometers
from our capital.

307
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:04,251
The threat is real.

308
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,583
Unidentified flight.

309
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:10,167
You must divert immediately
to vector 0-2-0.

310
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:13,418
This is your final warning.
You will be shot down. Acknowledge.

311
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:23,334
Anti-aircraft. We're taking fire.

312
00:22:37,126 --> 00:22:39,125
Mr. Lee, I'm sure you can appreciate
that this is...

313
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,792
Sir? There's been an incursion.
Please stand up.

314
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,751
Let's go. Move!

315
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:44,917
- Mr. Lee, please join us.
- That's not protocol, sir.

316
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:45,708
He's coming with us!

317
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,668
Move, move, move!
Get him to the elevator.

318
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,168
- Go! Go!
- Find Connor!

319
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,292
Code 9-9-9.

320
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:54,584
Go. go, go! Move!

321
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,479
Keep moving!
Get that elevator open now!

322
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:06,000
Give me four minutes, Mr. President.

323
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,376
Harden down on Olympus.

324
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:13,293
Air support on the way.

325
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:17,792
ETA, four minutes.

326
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:21,001
Code Red. Air space 1 and 2 compromised.

327
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:23,250
Robert, Delta, Ready One.

328
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:26,209
Move to West Corridor!
Move to West Corridor!

329
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,167
This way, please.

330
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:45,751
This is not a drill.
Evacuate immediately.

331
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:16,250
All units, 9-9-9.

332
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:19,876
I repeat, all units, 9-9-9.

333
00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:06,334
Let's move!

334
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:13,418
Find my son.

335
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:15,208
Sylvio, find Sparkplug immediately.

336
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:16,459
You okay, Mr. President?

337
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:19,334
Sir. This way. Over here.

338
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,709
Go on! Get down!

339
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:30,251
Get down!

340
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,334
Stay down! Don't move!

341
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:49,001
Get down! Get out of the way!
Take cover!

342
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:21,543
PPD Command, this is Wolfhound 6.
Have bogey in sight.

343
00:26:22,043 --> 00:26:24,751
Wolfhound 6, fire at will.
Repeat, fire at will.

344
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,251
Acknowledge.

345
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:26,918
Mr. President?

346
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:31,001
We have confirmation
that the bogey is down, sir.

347
00:27:31,376 --> 00:27:32,584
Thank you, Jones.

348
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:36,792
Activate Compound One.

349
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:40,251
I want open lines to the Pentagon,
Homeland Security and NSA.

350
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:44,250
Charlie.
Coordinate with the Air Force and FAA.

351
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:46,750
- Find out if that's' a lone aircraft.
- Yes, sir.

352
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:48,043
Half hour at the most.

353
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,834
Ruth. Where the hell is my son?

354
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:34,001
Hey!

355
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,417
Hey!

356
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,209
Hey, get the fuck down!

357
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:42,875
Mr. Lee. We've had a problem.

358
00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:44,708
- Please have patience with us.
- Got it.

359
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,459
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

360
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:49,959
It's a critical message.

361
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,251
The White House is under ground attack.

362
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:22,625
Officer on deck!

363
00:30:22,626 --> 00:30:25,458
Rapid Response Team from Andrews,
get 'em moving!

364
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,667
At ease. How bad is it?

365
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:29,167
Front fence has been breached.

366
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:31,167
We've got a C-130 burning
on the South Lawn

367
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,000
and a gunfight raging on the North.

368
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:34,875
Fucking shitting me.

369
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,208
Where's the president?

370
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,084
In the bunker.

371
00:31:12,084 --> 00:31:14,375
- Get me the Pentagon on the line now!
- Yes, sir!

372
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:15,376
It's happening.

373
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:23,626
Mr. President!

374
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:35,001
Forbes, what are you doing?

375
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:39,043
- Move!
- For God's sakes, Forbes.

376
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:47,876
Forbes! What are you doing?

377
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:49,084
Shut up!

378
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,083
Come on. Tim.

379
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:51,875
Come on. Hang in there!

380
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:52,751
Hey!

381
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:55,126
Ah, shit.

382
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:01,750
Where's the president?

383
00:33:01,751 --> 00:33:02,918
I don't know!

384
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,250
Goddamn it! Where's that response team?

385
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,708
- They're 5 minutes out, sir, but...
- But what?

386
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,125
We have a hostage situation
on our hands.

387
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:12,834
P.E.O.C.'s gone offline.

388
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:40,668
Go back! Get back now! Go back!

389
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:21,459
Fuck!

390
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:25,959
RPG!

391
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:38,418
Get in! Get inside! Get inside!

392
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:52,251
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

393
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,209
Go, go! Move!

394
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:13,208
Fall back, fall back!

395
00:36:13,209 --> 00:36:14,543
Let's go, let's go!

396
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:24,667
- They're down the hall!
- Shit, we've only got four guys left!

397
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:26,334
Hold your positions, you understand?

398
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:32,918
I got this door. Cover the other one.

399
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:58,583
Olympus has fallen. Olympus has fallen.

400
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:00,126
Olympus has fallen.

401
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,959
Fuck you!

402
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:09,959
They've taken the White House.

403
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:40,084
Command, Sniper Team One, in position.

404
00:38:02,376 --> 00:38:04,917
We're coming from the White House.
So far, the perimeter's been set.

405
00:38:04,918 --> 00:38:07,583
We're waiting on more intel to come
in right now, and once we do...

406
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:09,250
Bravo team's gonna breach.

407
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:11,876
- Wait for my command to execute.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:17,875
Not since the British burned down
the White House in the War of 1812...

409
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:21,083
has an enemy force occupied
the center of American power.

410
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:21,917
The White House,

411
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:25,584
the most protected building on Earth,
has fallen.

412
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,418
Sir,
we have a hot feed from the P.E.O.C.

413
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:33,375
Mr. Lee. Sir, are you safe?

414
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:35,083
Are you with the president?

415
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:36,751
Sir, can you hear m...?

416
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:38,876
Oh, my God.

417
00:38:43,876 --> 00:38:45,293
Don't negotiate.

418
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:51,751
Sir?

419
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:54,251
I have your commander-in-chief.

420
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,418
Now, stand down.

421
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,208
Who are you?

422
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:01,959
I am the man in control
of your White House.

423
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:07,043
Now, stand your men down.

424
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:15,542
- Stand down!
- Sir.

425
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:17,376
All units, stand down!

426
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:21,417
Ladies and gentlemen we are at DEFCON 4.

427
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:22,709
How could you?

428
00:39:23,668 --> 00:39:25,918
- Put your hands up. -Fuck you.

429
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,376
No!

430
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:51,459
There is a reason I never voted for you.

431
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:55,084
Don't do it, Forbes!

432
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:50,708
It takes 15 minutes
for your Armed Forces

433
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,251
to reach the White House.

434
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:56,584
We took it down in 13.

435
00:43:34,084 --> 00:43:35,125
Hurry, we need a wheelchair.

436
00:43:35,126 --> 00:43:37,708
In Triage, do you want me
to color code them or number code them?

437
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:38,625
Color code 'em.

438
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:40,709
Okay, Pam,
we still need to take the vitals.

439
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:53,459
Call, Mike. Mike.

440
00:43:56,918 --> 00:43:59,292
The cellular service in the area
you are calling

441
00:43:59,293 --> 00:44:00,250
has been suspended temporarily.

442
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:02,834
I got head trauma,
six-year-old girl, she's fading!

443
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:22,293
Bring Mr. Asher here.

444
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,584
What are you doing, for Christ's sake?

445
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:30,418
Oh, sir!

446
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:36,418
I have no interest
in your nuclear launch codes.

447
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:41,584
By now your Pentagon
has changed then, no?

448
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:44,168
Sit.

449
00:44:44,918 --> 00:44:46,334
You from the North?

450
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:48,918
You sure as hell are not from the South.

451
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,334
I'm working for justice.

452
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:54,167
To give millions of starving
men, women and children

453
00:44:54,168 --> 00:44:56,667
a chance at more than just subsistence.

454
00:44:56,668 --> 00:45:00,418
To end the civil war your country
interrupted so long ago.

455
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:02,459
And yes...

456
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:06,792
for a united, prosperous Korea.

457
00:45:06,793 --> 00:45:08,709
It's a whole new world, baby.

458
00:45:09,293 --> 00:45:11,668
What's the going rate for souls
these days?

459
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,667
What'd you say to me?

460
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:15,417
I never would have taken you
for a traitor.

461
00:45:15,418 --> 00:45:16,376
Me?

462
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:18,583
What about you?

463
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:21,709
You sold this country out long
before I ever did.

464
00:45:22,084 --> 00:45:25,875
Globalization and fucking Wall Street.

465
00:45:25,876 --> 00:45:28,918
What's it cost to buy
a presidency nowadays anyway?

466
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:32,417
$500 million?

467
00:45:32,418 --> 00:45:36,334
I'm a fucking rookie compared to you!

468
00:45:37,626 --> 00:45:39,459
Gotta keep your gloves up, Forbes.

469
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:41,459
Enough!

470
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:47,668
What about Connor?

471
00:45:48,126 --> 00:45:50,001
What the fuck are you gonna do
with my son?

472
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:03,751
Mr. Speaker.

473
00:46:05,001 --> 00:46:06,917
As both the President
and the Vice President

474
00:46:06,918 --> 00:46:09,000
of the United States
are unable to discharge

475
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:10,458
the duties of their offices

476
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:14,251
I'm officially placing you
under Secret Service protection.

477
00:46:18,668 --> 00:46:21,584
You are the Acting President
of the United States.

478
00:46:23,668 --> 00:46:24,918
Are they alive?

479
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:26,543
They are.

480
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:41,750
Sir, North Korea is denying
any involvement in the attack.

481
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:44,333
We've secured the perimeter
of the White House...

482
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,208
and cleared a 10-block radius.

483
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:50,043
Sir, they've also assassinated
the South Korean Prime Minister.

484
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:00,500
We have contact
from inside the White House.

485
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:02,918
Trace confirms
it's the president's Sat phone.

486
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,209
Put it through!

487
00:48:05,376 --> 00:48:06,751
Mr. President?

488
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,500
Negative.

489
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:11,000
- Identify yourself.
- Echelon Four.

490
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:12,000
That's one of yours?

491
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:16,333
- Designator?
- Oscar Zulu 309.

492
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:19,042
Jesus. Banning? Where are you?

493
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:20,625
I'm in the Oval Office.

494
00:48:20,626 --> 00:48:22,292
Is the president in the bunker?

495
00:48:22,293 --> 00:48:24,876
- He...
- Can we trust him?

496
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,875
Banning was one of our best agents.

497
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:30,333
Mr. Speaker, I just have to say,
this is Mike Banning.

498
00:48:30,334 --> 00:48:32,792
This is the same guy that was removed
from the president's detail...

499
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:33,708
- after the accident
- Whoa, whoa,

500
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:34,958
- when we lost the first lady?
- Ray! Ray! Ray!

501
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:35,958
- You wanna add something?
- Well, what's he doing

502
00:48:35,959 --> 00:48:36,750
- I suggest you get your facts straight.
- In the White House right now?

503
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:38,292
- How do we know we can trust this guy?

504
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:41,083
Banning is ex-Special Forces,
Ranger Battalion

505
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:45,126
He will move mountains or die trying.
I know him.

506
00:48:45,584 --> 00:48:46,792
Does anyone else in this room

507
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:49,501
have any intelligence
coming out of the White House?

508
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:52,918
Then we have no choice.

509
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:58,543
Yes. The president's in the bunker.
He's being held hostage.

510
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:01,333
What do they want?

511
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:02,751
We're trying to find out.

512
00:49:03,168 --> 00:49:04,500
Who's in charge?

513
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:05,458
Trumbull.

514
00:49:05,459 --> 00:49:08,001
- Are there any survivors with you?
- Negative, sir.

515
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:10,084
They wiped us out.

516
00:49:12,168 --> 00:49:14,458
They have commandos roaming
the hallways...

517
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:16,793
with enough explosives
to take out an army.

518
00:49:17,168 --> 00:49:20,833
Looks like the doors and windows
are rigged with C-4 explosives.

519
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:23,084
Who knows what other tricks
they have up their sleeves?

520
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:26,793
Any team coming in is gonna be ringing
the front doorbell pretty loud.

521
00:49:27,418 --> 00:49:28,625
They shut the power down.

522
00:49:28,626 --> 00:49:31,084
Lights off.
And I assume they closed the air vents.

523
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,458
I killed the surveillance,

524
00:49:32,459 --> 00:49:34,625
but I don't know
how long that's gonna last.

525
00:49:34,626 --> 00:49:35,668
Where's Connor?

526
00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:40,333
Oh, we have no status of his location,
but he's presumed to still be inside.

527
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:42,083
Well, they're looking for him.

528
00:49:42,084 --> 00:49:43,418
They have his photo.

529
00:49:44,043 --> 00:49:45,168
Sir...

530
00:49:45,876 --> 00:49:47,583
I'm here. Use me.

531
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:50,626
Okay, Banning. Sit tight.
We'll get back with you.

532
00:50:48,293 --> 00:50:50,459
Sir, we have a hot feed
from the P.E.O.C.

533
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:53,667
- Mr. Speaker.
- What is it you want?

534
00:50:53,668 --> 00:50:56,583
Recall the Seventh Fleet
from the Sea of Japan.

535
00:50:56,584 --> 00:51:01,542
And withdraw all 28,500 American troops
from the Demilitarized Zone.

536
00:51:01,543 --> 00:51:03,209
If you do not comply.

537
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:07,042
If you attempt any operation
to take this building...

538
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:10,042
- if you deviate from my instructions...
- Wait a minute.

539
00:51:10,043 --> 00:51:12,292
We can't just recall the Seventh Fleet.

540
00:51:12,293 --> 00:51:14,834
Then I will execute your officials
one by one...

541
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:17,333
and their blood will be on your hands.

542
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:18,626
You have until dawn.

543
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:20,876
I suggest you move quickly.

544
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:23,625
Who is that guy?

545
00:51:23,626 --> 00:51:26,292
Well, sir, we're running facial
recognition on him right now.

546
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:29,042
Well, he cleared as part of
the South Korean security detail.

547
00:51:29,043 --> 00:51:32,667
If we recall the Fleet,
and leave the DMZ...

548
00:51:32,668 --> 00:51:36,167
Seoul, all of South Korea could fall
within 72 hours, sir.

549
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:39,250
But if we do nothing, they kill Asher,
the vice president...

550
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:41,208
and his entire National Security team.

551
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:43,334
And Connor, if he's in there.

552
00:51:58,918 --> 00:52:00,625
Mary, get me some coffee

553
00:52:00,626 --> 00:52:04,458
Half-and-half, three Sweet 'N Lows.
In a real cup.

554
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:06,709
Not one of those paper
or Styrofoam things.

555
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:13,167
All right.
Let's secure all nuclear sites.

556
00:52:13,168 --> 00:52:15,500
Get me our expert on North Korea.

557
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:18,833
Then I want to speak with the Premiere
of North Korea on a secure line.

558
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:20,667
After that,
I wanna speak with the Russians,

559
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:22,625
the Chinese,
the British and the French.

560
00:52:22,626 --> 00:52:24,918
And set up a press conference.
In that order.

561
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:32,043
The United States of America
doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

562
00:52:38,584 --> 00:52:41,293
Who said anything about negotiating?

563
00:53:09,168 --> 00:53:13,293
Admiral Hoenig, your Cerberus code.

564
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:21,959
You kill him, you won't get the code.

565
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:25,168
I will not ask again.

566
00:53:45,293 --> 00:53:48,001
- Give it to him, Joe.
- Mr. President.

567
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,959
You'll never get mine.

568
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:55,959
Tango-Juliet-1-9-3-3-4.

569
00:53:57,876 --> 00:53:59,083
Louden

570
00:53:59,084 --> 00:54:04,084
Tango-Juliet-1-9-3-3-4.

571
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:17,418
What the hell?

572
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:20,208
Get me Homeland Security.

573
00:54:20,209 --> 00:54:21,168
No, now!

574
00:54:25,043 --> 00:54:29,376
Sir. NORAD reports a Cerberus code
has been entered.

575
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:31,626
Jesus.

576
00:54:38,834 --> 00:54:42,918
Jacobs, I got something coming your way.

577
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:45,501
I got a clean commando in front of me.

578
00:54:47,168 --> 00:54:48,875
- What is that? -Is he alive?

579
00:54:48,876 --> 00:54:50,418
Ask me a serious question.

580
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:52,668
Anybody around the table?

581
00:54:53,876 --> 00:54:55,292
We don't recognize it.

582
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:58,209
Well, whoever they are,
they're fucking good.

583
00:54:59,001 --> 00:55:01,458
They're well-trained
and they're well-organized.

584
00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:02,625
But I guess you know that already.

585
00:55:02,626 --> 00:55:03,918
Get that over to Langley.

586
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:06,833
So, what have you got? Talk to me.

587
00:55:06,834 --> 00:55:09,918
They want us to recall the Seventh Fleet
and pull our troops out.

588
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:12,126
Oh, is that all?

589
00:55:13,459 --> 00:55:15,834
A Cerberus code has been entered.

590
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:17,958
What's Cerberus?

591
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:19,292
That's classified.

592
00:55:19,293 --> 00:55:20,959
Classified? Really?

593
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,626
Well, right now I think I have
the proverbial need-to-fucking-know.

594
00:55:29,418 --> 00:55:32,626
Cerberus is a
highly-classified military protocol.

595
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:39,167
A 3-pronged fail-safe in the case of
an inadvertent nuclear launch.

596
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:42,625
It allows us to access
the self-destruct mechanism

597
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:45,083
in our ICBM's in-flight.

598
00:55:45,084 --> 00:55:48,208
So even if one of our nuclear warheads
was launched and we wanted to abort.

599
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:51,333
Cerberus is the only way to stop it
from reaching its target.

600
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:53,668
No one person has all three codes.

601
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:57,333
It's parceled out to the president,
Secretary of Defense...

602
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:59,333
and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

603
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:02,083
All of whom are
in the president's bunker right now.

604
00:56:02,084 --> 00:56:05,875
With those codes, they can destroy
any long-range nuke that we fire.

605
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:09,751
And that would make America vulnerable
to a nuclear strike.

606
00:56:11,418 --> 00:56:13,000
So, change the codes.

607
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:14,083
We can't.

608
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:16,042
Cerberus was designed
as a self-contained

609
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:17,500
total-isolation system.

610
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:20,542
The only way to change the codes
is physically on the computer itself.

611
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,792
Which is located
in the president's bunker.

612
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:25,333
So, now we know why
they wanted the president's son.

613
00:56:25,334 --> 00:56:27,917
The president will hold out
as long as he can.

614
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:29,543
But if they get his son...

615
00:56:30,293 --> 00:56:31,584
if they hurt him...

616
00:56:32,084 --> 00:56:33,083
well...

617
00:56:33,084 --> 00:56:35,834
nobody could hold out
under those circumstances.

618
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:37,834
So, find Connor

619
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:39,918
get him the hell out of there.

620
00:56:40,584 --> 00:56:41,584
Yes, sir.

621
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:51,084
Mr. Forbes.

622
00:56:57,959 --> 00:56:59,168
Who is that?

623
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:07,376
Mike Banning.

624
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:18,458
And who might that be?

625
00:57:18,459 --> 00:57:21,793
He was on the president's protection
detail for a few years.

626
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:24,250
Are we worried about him?

627
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:25,376
Hell no.

628
00:57:28,626 --> 00:57:29,751
No.

629
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:32,543
He should be.

630
00:59:37,126 --> 00:59:42,584
Did Truman gut the White House interior
in 1948 or '49?

631
00:59:43,334 --> 00:59:45,251
I believe it was '49.

632
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:49,876
Steel frame over
the old stone walls. Yes?

633
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:09,376
Connor!

634
01:00:15,793 --> 01:00:18,084
- How're you doing? Okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

635
01:00:24,168 --> 01:00:26,709
I see this is still
your favorite hiding place, huh?

636
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,458
I've got Sparkplug.

637
01:00:31,459 --> 01:00:33,251
Finally, some good news.

638
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:36,543
He's safe. I'm bringing him out.

639
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:39,750
What about my dad?

640
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:42,375
Your dad's gonna be fine, okay?

641
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:43,500
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

642
01:00:43,501 --> 01:00:44,959
We're gonna get him outta here.

643
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:39,126
- Okay? -Yeah.

644
01:01:39,584 --> 01:01:41,418
All right. Let's get outta here.

645
01:01:43,376 --> 01:01:45,667
- You ready to haul ass?
- Yeah.

646
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:46,959
Okay, stay close.

647
01:01:50,084 --> 01:01:50,876
Okay.

648
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:08,001
Come on.

649
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:14,584
Okay, come on.

650
01:02:20,751 --> 01:02:21,958
All right, kiddo.

651
01:02:21,959 --> 01:02:24,458
Keep an eye out, okay? Watch my six.

652
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:25,334
Jacobs.

653
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:27,543
Okay, I have Sparkplug.

654
01:02:28,543 --> 01:02:32,500
He's coming out in a ventilation shaft
in the northwest corner, ground floor.

655
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:33,792
Have the green party waiting.

656
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:34,709
We'll be there.

657
01:02:56,043 --> 01:02:58,876
How are you gonna fit through that?
You're coming with me, right?

658
01:03:02,334 --> 01:03:03,709
I gotta go get your dad.

659
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:06,375
All right. Now, listen, you can do this.

660
01:03:06,376 --> 01:03:09,167
Now, you remember chimney climbing
I taught you on the Rose Garden wall?

661
01:03:09,168 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah? So, that's all it is. Okay?

662
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:15,083
It's one foot against the front wall,
one foot against the back.

663
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:16,584
Now, all the way to the top.

664
01:03:21,876 --> 01:03:23,667
- Mike?
- Yeah.

665
01:03:23,668 --> 01:03:24,834
I'm scared.

666
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:26,626
Yeah, me too.

667
01:03:27,459 --> 01:03:29,001
But you're gonna get through it.

668
01:03:30,126 --> 01:03:31,584
You're one of us now.

669
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:34,583
This is yours. Put that on.

670
01:03:34,584 --> 01:03:36,459
Now, I'm counting on you, kiddo.

671
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:38,000
Okay.

672
01:03:38,001 --> 01:03:40,376
Good man. All right. Let's go.

673
01:03:44,584 --> 01:03:46,834
There you go, kiddo.
I'm gonna push you on up, okay?

674
01:03:50,084 --> 01:03:51,668
I'll see you on the other side.

675
01:03:55,376 --> 01:03:56,583
Now, keep movin'.

676
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:58,334
Sparkplug is on his way up.

677
01:04:00,543 --> 01:04:03,751
Oh, Jacobs, hold on. Connor, wait up.

678
01:05:11,043 --> 01:05:13,209
- False alarm. Go.
- Okay.

679
01:05:15,834 --> 01:05:17,334
He's coming out, Jacobs.

680
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:41,334
Hold your position.
Hostiles in the area.

681
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:53,418
Go, go, go! It's clear.

682
01:05:54,376 --> 01:05:56,126
CIB-1. Going in.

683
01:06:13,209 --> 01:06:14,209
You Okay?

684
01:06:19,626 --> 01:06:20,626
Coming out.

685
01:06:26,918 --> 01:06:29,626
Hostile moving toward the ledge.
Hustle up.

686
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:44,834
Sparkplug received.

687
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:48,793
Good job, Banning.

688
01:06:49,459 --> 01:06:51,959
Now, let's see
if we can get the president out.

689
01:06:52,793 --> 01:06:54,043
Roger that.

690
01:06:57,459 --> 01:07:04,042
I want to reassure all Americans
and everyone around the world

691
01:07:04,043 --> 01:07:05,958
that despite today's events

692
01:07:05,959 --> 01:07:08,959
our government remains 100% functional.

693
01:07:09,709 --> 01:07:12,501
We know that the president is alive.

694
01:07:13,543 --> 01:07:18,251
To our friends, we are grateful
for your loyalty and support.

695
01:07:19,126 --> 01:07:22,084
As a nation,
we are never stronger than when tested.

696
01:07:22,543 --> 01:07:25,668
We will remain united and strong.

697
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:28,417
God bless you all

698
01:07:28,418 --> 01:07:31,001
and God bless
these United States of America.

699
01:07:50,543 --> 01:07:54,918
Okay, asshole.
Yo. Hey. Who's running the show?

700
01:07:57,251 --> 01:07:58,709
Oh, you speak English?

701
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:01,209
They teach you that where you come from?

702
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:03,833
'Cause you know what they teach me?

703
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:06,709
Is how to extract information
from people like you.

704
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:16,917
That's funny, huh?

705
01:08:16,918 --> 01:08:18,751
No, it's funny. I know. I get it.

706
01:08:32,918 --> 01:08:36,084
Yeah. I guess I'm a little rusty.

707
01:08:38,084 --> 01:08:39,875
I liked your friend though.

708
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:41,418
He seems like a funny guy.

709
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,334
What's your leader's name?

710
01:08:44,876 --> 01:08:46,501
Oh, I'm sorry. Here.

711
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:49,001
How many men do you have?

712
01:08:53,168 --> 01:08:54,626
In English.

713
01:08:55,876 --> 01:08:57,792
His name is Yeonsak Kang.

714
01:08:57,793 --> 01:08:59,042
He's the head of the KUF.

715
01:08:59,043 --> 01:09:01,000
The paramilitary organization?

716
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:02,459
No surprises there.

717
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:05,583
40 commandos breached the gate
and 28 are left.

718
01:09:05,584 --> 01:09:07,668
How do we know
we can trust the information?

719
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:09,959
I just asked them nicely.

720
01:09:11,501 --> 01:09:12,792
Kang Yeonsak?

721
01:09:12,793 --> 01:09:15,667
Sir, this is one of the most
wanted terrorists in the world.

722
01:09:15,668 --> 01:09:18,875
He was brought across the DMZ as a child
after his father was executed

723
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:21,208
for crimes against
the North Korean state.

724
01:09:21,209 --> 01:09:22,250
While they were crossing the border,

725
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:24,417
his mother was killed
by an American landmine.

726
01:09:24,418 --> 01:09:28,208
This guy masterminded the 2004 bombing
of the British Embassy in Seoul.

727
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:31,917
And he funneled Pyongyang uranium
enrichment technology from Pakistan.

728
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,875
He's never before been
photographed or identified

729
01:09:33,876 --> 01:09:36,208
by any Western intelligence agency.

730
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:38,292
Well, Jesus Christ,
nobody ever thought to look for him

731
01:09:38,293 --> 01:09:39,417
inside the South Korean government.

732
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:42,208
Look, I don't care who he is.
With a force that size

733
01:09:42,209 --> 01:09:44,542
I have men who can sweep 'em out
in short order.

734
01:09:44,543 --> 01:09:46,834
Sir, this is not going to be a cakewalk.

735
01:09:47,293 --> 01:09:49,708
These sons of bitches
are pretty fucking tough.

736
01:09:49,709 --> 01:09:52,250
I've got the toughest fuckin' guys
in the world.

737
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:54,375
What we need to know is
how to get into that bunker.

738
01:09:54,376 --> 01:09:57,583
Once those blast doors close, you don't.
It's nuclear hardened.

739
01:09:57,584 --> 01:10:00,875
Now, there used to be some old tunnels,
but they were sealed up years ago.

740
01:10:00,876 --> 01:10:03,583
Sir, your men need to know
what the hell they're dropping into.

741
01:10:03,584 --> 01:10:06,751
Do not launch anything
until I do some recon.

742
01:10:40,376 --> 01:10:45,043
Agent Banning. Yes, I know who you are.

743
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:49,126
Welcome to my house.

744
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,792
Hey, asshole. What took you so long?

745
01:10:56,793 --> 01:10:59,126
You're the one that
let the first lady die, no?

746
01:11:00,793 --> 01:11:02,584
And soon, the president.

747
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:05,458
Failure seems to be a habit with you.

748
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:06,918
Yeah, well...

749
01:11:07,709 --> 01:11:11,208
Maybe I owe you for giving me the chance
for making up for that today.

750
01:11:11,209 --> 01:11:14,667
I admire you
for acknowledging your failure.

751
01:11:14,668 --> 01:11:16,292
But there's no going back.

752
01:11:16,293 --> 01:11:19,792
Nothing you try and do here
tonight can atone.

753
01:11:19,793 --> 01:11:21,209
Yeah, maybe not.

754
01:11:21,918 --> 01:11:25,208
But I reckon fucking your shit up
will be a pretty good start.

755
01:11:25,209 --> 01:11:30,209
You may wanna take a headcount.
The bodies are piling up.

756
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,833
I have more than enough men
to finish the mission.

757
01:11:34,834 --> 01:11:37,792
Oh, and by the way,
if you're looking for Connor...

758
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,876
he's on his way to the baseball game.

759
01:11:42,418 --> 01:11:44,251
How's your wife, Michael?

760
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,834
Leah. She's a nurse.

761
01:11:48,293 --> 01:11:49,875
Saves lives.

762
01:11:49,876 --> 01:11:52,043
Too bad she will not save yours.

763
01:11:52,751 --> 01:11:54,417
You know what?

764
01:11:54,418 --> 01:11:57,001
Why don't you and I
play a game of fuck off?

765
01:11:57,501 --> 01:11:59,001
You go first.

766
01:12:00,959 --> 01:12:02,043
Go kill him.

767
01:12:14,584 --> 01:12:15,626
Enough!

768
01:12:17,293 --> 01:12:18,334
Enough!

769
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:37,501
Madam Secretary.

770
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:41,043
Your Cerberus code.

771
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:43,084
No!

772
01:12:47,793 --> 01:12:48,751
Ruth!

773
01:12:53,626 --> 01:12:54,751
Your code!

774
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:57,708
You'll have to kill me.

775
01:12:57,709 --> 01:12:59,168
As you wish.

776
01:13:08,168 --> 01:13:09,501
There's a saying...

777
01:13:10,543 --> 01:13:11,668
in Korea.

778
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:19,417
Seeing something a 100 times...

779
01:13:19,418 --> 01:13:21,501
is not as good as living it once.

780
01:13:23,626 --> 01:13:24,959
Fuck you.

781
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:27,293
Stop!

782
01:13:27,834 --> 01:13:29,333
Enough!

783
01:13:29,334 --> 01:13:30,918
Enough! Stop!

784
01:13:33,168 --> 01:13:34,126
Enough!

785
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:46,418
Give it to him, Ruth.

786
01:13:47,001 --> 01:13:48,333
It doesn't matter.

787
01:13:48,334 --> 01:13:50,001
And he won't get mine.

788
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:56,376
Ruth.

789
01:14:01,918 --> 01:14:03,126
Give it to him!

790
01:14:04,168 --> 01:14:05,834
That's an order, Ruth.

791
01:14:06,418 --> 01:14:07,501
Sir...

792
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:09,918
Give it him, Ruth.

793
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:13,584
Yes, sir.

794
01:14:15,709 --> 01:14:19,542
Echo-Mike...

795
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:24,168
6-0-2-8...

796
01:14:25,459 --> 01:14:27,918
5, sir.

797
01:14:35,959 --> 01:14:39,959
Get your fucking hands off of me!

798
01:14:42,668 --> 01:14:46,668
Sir, NORAD reports that the second
Cerberus code has been entered.

799
01:14:52,418 --> 01:14:53,418
My God.

800
01:15:06,209 --> 01:15:09,375
- Mike! Mike, Mike, it's me.
- Dave?

801
01:15:09,376 --> 01:15:10,833
You scared the shit out of me.

802
01:15:10,834 --> 01:15:12,083
Jesus, what the fuck?

803
01:15:12,084 --> 01:15:12,875
Yeah, just put that thing down.

804
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:14,542
I almost blew your
fucking brains out, man.

805
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:15,750
What are you doing here?

806
01:15:15,751 --> 01:15:17,667
I was with the South Korean delegation.

807
01:15:17,668 --> 01:15:19,708
What the fuck are you doing here?

808
01:15:19,709 --> 01:15:21,083
I thought you were working
at the Treasury.

809
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:22,250
Yeah, I am.

810
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,293
Believe it or not,
I came in through the front door.

811
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:29,376
Oh, fuck, Mike.

812
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:31,875
I saw my life flash in front of me.

813
01:15:31,876 --> 01:15:34,667
Look at my hand. Fucker's shakin'.

814
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:36,000
Jesus Christ.

815
01:15:36,001 --> 01:15:37,375
It's good to see you, buddy.

816
01:15:37,376 --> 01:15:39,043
You got a funny way of showing it.

817
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:44,500
Is the president okay?

818
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:45,834
He's alive for now.

819
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,376
They got him in the bunker.

820
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:52,375
It's a fucking shit show, huh?

821
01:15:52,376 --> 01:15:53,668
Yeah, that's for sure.

822
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:57,334
Roma make it?

823
01:15:59,626 --> 01:16:00,918
Fuck.

824
01:16:02,043 --> 01:16:03,376
We gotta keep movin'.

825
01:16:08,668 --> 01:16:10,583
- You got a plan, Mike?
- Yeah.

826
01:16:10,584 --> 01:16:12,334
But it hasn't worked out so far.

827
01:16:14,459 --> 01:16:16,708
Fuckin' Mike. You always were a hardass.

828
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:18,209
You never change.

829
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:22,418
Hey, Dave.

830
01:16:23,168 --> 01:16:26,709
This place is getting me rattled, man.
I can't think straight.

831
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:28,709
You okay?

832
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:32,793
No. Not for real.

833
01:16:33,459 --> 01:16:35,709
This fucking Kang, man. He's crazy.

834
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:39,418
How do you know his name?

835
01:16:45,876 --> 01:16:48,459
Hey, Mike, do you remember that time
in New York?

836
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:45,876
Dave.

837
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:49,459
Why'd you do it?

838
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:52,543
Fuck, Mike.

839
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:55,251
Fuck.

840
01:17:57,793 --> 01:17:59,626
I lost my way.

841
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:06,001
You can make up for it now.

842
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:10,709
Tell Kang I'm dead.

843
01:18:12,126 --> 01:18:14,043
You'll help me save the president.

844
01:18:18,418 --> 01:18:21,918
Kang. It's Forbes.

845
01:18:23,459 --> 01:18:27,918
I got him. All clear.

846
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:31,126
Good.

847
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:46,043
Ruth.

848
01:18:47,251 --> 01:18:49,834
Mr. President, sir?

849
01:18:53,168 --> 01:18:54,334
Rough day.

850
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:56,459
Could be worse.

851
01:18:57,793 --> 01:18:59,543
How's my hair?

852
01:19:01,459 --> 01:19:03,418
Not a strand out of place.

853
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:12,584
Any regrets?

854
01:19:12,876 --> 01:19:13,876
None.

855
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,834
You?

856
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:20,418
A few.

857
01:19:20,876 --> 01:19:22,459
Like running for president.

858
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:27,209
The office is lucky to have you, sir.

859
01:19:28,334 --> 01:19:31,001
We all may meet our maker today...

860
01:19:33,043 --> 01:19:37,043
but the one thing
I do not want on my tombstone...

861
01:19:38,376 --> 01:19:40,751
"She Went Down Without a Fight."

862
01:19:46,501 --> 01:19:48,001
No danger of that.

863
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:51,334
Pull up your satellite feed.

864
01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:53,293
Give me eyes on.

865
01:19:55,001 --> 01:19:57,793
Looks like there's only four sentries
on the roof.

866
01:19:58,251 --> 01:19:59,917
With the Air Defense grid gone,

867
01:19:59,918 --> 01:20:01,876
they're vulnerable
to an aerial insertion.

868
01:20:03,209 --> 01:20:05,459
Wait. Let me get there first
and check it out.

869
01:20:06,751 --> 01:20:08,125
We're not waiting.

870
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:10,001
We have to secure Cerberus.

871
01:20:10,418 --> 01:20:11,793
Oh, fuck.

872
01:20:13,001 --> 01:20:14,834
Send in the SEALS, General.

873
01:20:15,501 --> 01:20:16,834
We're going through the roof.

874
01:20:25,543 --> 01:20:27,293
Command, Tiger Flight inbound.

875
01:20:29,834 --> 01:20:31,251
Tiger Team, stand by.

876
01:20:34,126 --> 01:20:35,875
The assault team is on the way.

877
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:37,168
About fucking time.

878
01:20:38,293 --> 01:20:39,959
Yes, sir. Copy.

879
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,333
Command,
Tiger Flight's three minutes out.

880
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:00,834
Team, go green.

881
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:02,251
Go green.

882
01:21:08,376 --> 01:21:09,001
Cho.

883
01:21:44,918 --> 01:21:48,084
60 seconds to target.
I want a clean deployment.

884
01:22:11,084 --> 01:22:11,834
Fuck.

885
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:13,626
Tell them to hold.

886
01:22:14,168 --> 01:22:15,876
We aren't holding shit!

887
01:22:17,001 --> 01:22:20,083
Jacobs. You've gotta abort his mission.

888
01:22:20,084 --> 01:22:21,875
They've got the Hydra Six!

889
01:22:21,876 --> 01:22:22,792
What's that?

890
01:22:22,793 --> 01:22:25,042
Next generation weaponry. Ours.

891
01:22:25,043 --> 01:22:27,208
How the hell would they get that?

892
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:29,293
It doesn't matter. We'll take it out.

893
01:22:29,918 --> 01:22:31,876
I said abort this fucking mission!

894
01:22:32,418 --> 01:22:34,333
Let's go get our goddamn house back,
Captain.

895
01:22:34,334 --> 01:22:36,667
Tiger Two, Tiger Three,
you're cleared hot.

896
01:22:36,668 --> 01:22:37,875
Tiger Two, roger.

897
01:22:37,876 --> 01:22:39,167
Tiger Three, roger.

898
01:22:39,168 --> 01:22:42,126
All birds, be on the lookout
for possible advanced weaponry.

899
01:22:58,251 --> 01:22:59,751
Approaching rooftop.

900
01:23:02,584 --> 01:23:04,126
Negative on the four sentries.

901
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:05,793
Tiger Flight's on station.

902
01:23:06,418 --> 01:23:07,376
We got 'em.

903
01:23:08,293 --> 01:23:09,418
Go, go, go!

904
01:23:09,834 --> 01:23:11,459
Fast ropes deployed.

905
01:23:13,959 --> 01:23:16,376
We have a radar locked sourced
from target.

906
01:23:17,918 --> 01:23:19,667
Tiger Two's taking fire
from the rooftop!

907
01:23:19,668 --> 01:23:21,167
Tiger Team, go combat flight.

908
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,000
Tiger Two's hit.He's going down.

909
01:23:23,001 --> 01:23:24,333
Tiger Two going down hard.

910
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:25,418
Tiger Two's hit.

911
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,292
Evasive, evasive.

912
01:23:27,293 --> 01:23:28,543
Take out that target.

913
01:23:29,168 --> 01:23:30,584
Concentrate fire on that rooftop.

914
01:23:32,418 --> 01:23:34,292
Tiger Three, fly behind the target.

915
01:23:34,293 --> 01:23:35,625
Tiger Four, adjust approach!

916
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:37,459
Head northwest and flank from there!

917
01:23:39,209 --> 01:23:42,583
Tiger Five and Six, switch to Formation
Charlie and take out that gun!

918
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:43,959
Damn it, drop altitude!

919
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:47,459
Tiger One gunner just got hit!

920
01:23:55,293 --> 01:23:56,876
Watch your three. Watch your three.

921
01:23:57,293 --> 01:23:58,251
Taking fire.

922
01:23:58,626 --> 01:23:59,918
- Hold on!
- We're getting hit!

923
01:24:06,043 --> 01:24:07,209
Tiger Six is down!

924
01:24:10,918 --> 01:24:12,084
Tiger Five taking...

925
01:24:15,126 --> 01:24:16,584
Tiger Five's gone down.

926
01:24:18,959 --> 01:24:21,333
Reset formation. Tiger One taking lead.

927
01:24:21,334 --> 01:24:22,376
Roger that.

928
01:24:30,334 --> 01:24:31,418
We need backup!

929
01:24:32,334 --> 01:24:33,167
They're chewing us up!

930
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:34,875
Engaging Target. Provide cover.

931
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:36,918
All remaining Blackhawks,
provide air cover.

932
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:46,792
Two birds up. Only two birds remain.

933
01:24:46,793 --> 01:24:47,958
Abort! Abort!

934
01:24:47,959 --> 01:24:49,083
Pull out. Clear the area.

935
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,584
Roger! Clearing the area!

936
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,251
Tiger One is hit! Losing control!

937
01:24:59,459 --> 01:25:02,751
Tail rotor failure.
Mayday, mayday! We're going down!

938
01:25:32,626 --> 01:25:34,334
Five out of six birds are down.

939
01:25:34,918 --> 01:25:36,543
Requesting QRT.

940
01:25:38,418 --> 01:25:40,459
Permission to launch second squadron.

941
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:42,750
Negative, negative.

942
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:43,792
We don't have any intel about

943
01:25:43,793 --> 01:25:45,876
what other surprises
they could have for us.

944
01:25:47,001 --> 01:25:49,126
Return to base. Return to base. Over.

945
01:25:49,501 --> 01:25:50,459
Roger that.

946
01:25:56,251 --> 01:26:00,209
Banning, are you there? Banning!

947
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:08,167
Half the White House is just gone.

948
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:11,083
The residence, the roof,
all destroyed...

949
01:26:11,084 --> 01:26:13,918
and the remainder of
the historic building now trashed.

950
01:26:15,668 --> 01:26:16,793
Speaker Trumbull,

951
01:26:17,793 --> 01:26:20,501
that was a very foolish undertaking.

952
01:26:32,251 --> 01:26:34,084
Your president is next.

953
01:26:34,584 --> 01:26:37,875
You now have one hour
to recall the Seventh Fleet

954
01:26:37,876 --> 01:26:39,333
and your troops.

955
01:26:39,334 --> 01:26:42,583
Once you do so,
I want a helicopter on the North Lawn

956
01:26:42,584 --> 01:26:43,876
fueled and ready.

957
01:26:44,376 --> 01:26:45,751
60 minutes.

958
01:27:05,334 --> 01:27:06,168
Fuck.

959
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:08,084
It's Banning.

960
01:27:08,626 --> 01:27:09,834
Patch him through.

961
01:27:10,209 --> 01:27:11,626
- Mike?
- Yeah.

962
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:14,792
We've been trying to reach you, son.
Are you okay?

963
01:27:14,793 --> 01:27:18,501
Mr. Speaker, sir,
if we ever get out of this shit storm...

964
01:27:19,168 --> 01:27:21,168
you can hold me for insubordination.

965
01:27:22,584 --> 01:27:25,167
But your team needs
some serious fucking help.

966
01:27:25,168 --> 01:27:27,250
This is General Clegg,
Army Chief of Staff.

967
01:27:27,251 --> 01:27:29,792
I am ordering you to stand down.

968
01:27:29,793 --> 01:27:31,583
Remove your only eyes and ears
from the ground.

969
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,792
That's fucking brilliant.

970
01:27:32,793 --> 01:27:35,625
We need to pull you out of there
before we lose another hostage!

971
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:37,875
I am giving you a direct order.

972
01:27:37,876 --> 01:27:41,083
Newsflash, asshole.
I don't work for you.

973
01:27:41,084 --> 01:27:44,333
General Clegg.
I'm the Commander-in-Chief.

974
01:27:44,334 --> 01:27:47,208
If I didn't absolutely need you,
I would relieve you right now.

975
01:27:47,209 --> 01:27:48,667
I will not let this asshole
- General.

976
01:27:48,668 --> 01:27:50,250
- Blow up America, sir!
- I don't wanna here another word...

977
01:27:50,251 --> 01:27:52,543
out of you unless I ask you a question!

978
01:27:57,668 --> 01:27:58,626
Sir.

979
01:27:59,251 --> 01:28:00,459
Mr. Banning.

980
01:28:01,668 --> 01:28:03,126
Mr. Banning, are you there?

981
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,751
Yes, sir. What's the plan?

982
01:28:08,376 --> 01:28:12,667
We're recalling the Seventh Fleet
pulling our troops back from the DMZ

983
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:14,292
and giving them the helicopter.

984
01:28:14,293 --> 01:28:18,375
Sir, you cannot do that.
You cannot give this guy what he wants.

985
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:20,500
I've dealt with
these types of men before.

986
01:28:20,501 --> 01:28:22,625
Give me some time. Let me flush him out.

987
01:28:22,626 --> 01:28:26,583
We are talking about the safety
of the President of the United States!

988
01:28:26,584 --> 01:28:28,918
We're talking about a hell of
a lot more than that, sir.

989
01:28:33,543 --> 01:28:36,959
With all due respect,
you're acting president now.

990
01:28:37,834 --> 01:28:39,751
And I'm the best hope you've got.

991
01:28:42,043 --> 01:28:44,168
Okay, Mike. You've got 30 minutes.

992
01:28:49,334 --> 01:28:51,208
Leah, call for you on the landline.

993
01:28:51,209 --> 01:28:52,501
The emergency line.

994
01:28:56,418 --> 01:28:58,000
Can you make sure he gets some morphine?

995
01:28:58,001 --> 01:28:58,793
Yes.

996
01:29:02,126 --> 01:29:03,001
Mike?

997
01:29:03,501 --> 01:29:05,543
Hey. I was just checking in.

998
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:09,459
Babe. How's your day been?

999
01:29:11,084 --> 01:29:12,501
Yeah, it's been busy.

1000
01:29:13,459 --> 01:29:15,084
It's good, you know.

1001
01:29:16,543 --> 01:29:17,876
How 'bout you?

1002
01:29:18,918 --> 01:29:21,293
Yeah. Busy.

1003
01:29:22,251 --> 01:29:23,626
Hey, you okay?

1004
01:29:24,126 --> 01:29:27,584
Yeah, I just, I've, I've had to stay
a little later than I expected.

1005
01:29:28,834 --> 01:29:30,126
Yeah, me too.

1006
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:34,709
You're gonna come home tonight, right?

1007
01:29:35,126 --> 01:29:36,958
Yeah. Sure.

1008
01:29:36,959 --> 01:29:38,709
We got a date, remember?

1009
01:29:39,459 --> 01:29:40,834
Hey, I gotta go.

1010
01:29:41,168 --> 01:29:44,751
You know, this, uh,
paperwork's piling up.

1011
01:29:45,251 --> 01:29:46,376
Okay.

1012
01:29:49,668 --> 01:29:50,709
I love you.

1013
01:30:11,543 --> 01:30:12,918
What's the matter, Kang?

1014
01:30:13,334 --> 01:30:15,084
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1015
01:30:15,668 --> 01:30:18,417
I guess you don't know
who you can trust, huh?

1016
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:19,542
It's over.

1017
01:30:19,543 --> 01:30:23,375
No more televised executions.
No chopper.

1018
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:24,958
No more negotiating with you

1019
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:27,918
and the United People's Front
of Who Gives a Fuck.

1020
01:30:28,751 --> 01:30:30,875
I will send the president out...

1021
01:30:30,876 --> 01:30:32,792
one piece at a time.

1022
01:30:32,793 --> 01:30:34,001
It won't matter.

1023
01:30:34,418 --> 01:30:36,500
Because whatever you think
you accomplished

1024
01:30:36,501 --> 01:30:38,293
you won't be alive to see it.

1025
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:41,168
Shut him down.

1026
01:30:41,626 --> 01:30:44,000
Ah, you're not shutting me down, Kang.

1027
01:30:44,001 --> 01:30:45,792
I'm here to stay.

1028
01:30:45,793 --> 01:30:47,375
I underestimated you.

1029
01:30:47,376 --> 01:30:49,083
It will not happen again.

1030
01:30:49,084 --> 01:30:50,458
There is no again.

1031
01:30:50,459 --> 01:30:54,042
You're gonna die down there alone
cut off from the rest of the world.

1032
01:30:54,043 --> 01:30:57,667
My advice?
Save the last bullet for yourself.

1033
01:30:57,668 --> 01:30:59,208
'Cause if you don't...

1034
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:01,709
I'm gonna stick my knife
through your brain.

1035
01:31:02,043 --> 01:31:03,375
But don't worry.

1036
01:31:03,376 --> 01:31:06,000
I'm gonna leak the photos
of your body to the press.

1037
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:08,334
You know, 'cause I know you
like that kind of shit.

1038
01:31:27,293 --> 01:31:28,126
Her!

1039
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:49,667
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

1040
01:31:49,668 --> 01:31:54,418
of the United States of America!

1041
01:32:08,876 --> 01:32:10,918
Your leader is out of his mind.

1042
01:32:15,293 --> 01:32:17,501
You fucking idiot!

1043
01:32:23,376 --> 01:32:24,334
Go.

1044
01:32:24,876 --> 01:32:26,126
Walk.

1045
01:32:26,918 --> 01:32:28,084
Move!

1046
01:32:54,584 --> 01:32:57,208
Sir, there's movement
in front of the White House.

1047
01:32:57,209 --> 01:32:58,583
Ours or theirs?

1048
01:32:58,584 --> 01:33:00,500
Looks like Secretary McMillan, sir.

1049
01:33:00,501 --> 01:33:02,876
- Any bulges, wires? -Negative.

1050
01:33:08,668 --> 01:33:11,209
Sir, ground reports activity
at the White House.

1051
01:33:11,709 --> 01:33:13,292
- Is that?
- McMillan.

1052
01:33:13,293 --> 01:33:16,959
Get a team out there now.
And another to cover! Go!

1053
01:33:20,543 --> 01:33:24,459
It looks like Secretary McMillan.
Yeah, yes, it is.

1054
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:46,959
Yes!

1055
01:34:02,293 --> 01:34:03,209
Mike?

1056
01:34:05,543 --> 01:34:06,458
Hey.

1057
01:34:06,459 --> 01:34:08,751
He got away. He's back in the bunker.

1058
01:34:09,584 --> 01:34:12,376
You gave it a good shot, Mike.
You saved McMillan.

1059
01:34:13,834 --> 01:34:17,208
North and South Korean military
forces are on high alert

1060
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:20,292
in response to rumors
of an impending American

1061
01:34:20,293 --> 01:34:22,042
pull-out from the DMZ.

1062
01:34:22,043 --> 01:34:25,292
India, China and Russia
have declared a state of emergency

1063
01:34:25,293 --> 01:34:27,125
and have mobilized military forces.

1064
01:34:27,126 --> 01:34:27,958
In the Middle East though,

1065
01:34:27,959 --> 01:34:31,167
the response to the attack
on the White House is jubilant.

1066
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:33,625
Crowds of thousands
are celebrating in the streets

1067
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,417
and American flags are burning.

1068
01:34:35,418 --> 01:34:37,917
...created by a U.S. departure
could spark

1069
01:34:37,918 --> 01:34:42,875
an immediate and full-scale conflict
and that any conventional war

1070
01:34:42,876 --> 01:34:45,542
in this heavily-armed corner
of the world

1071
01:34:45,543 --> 01:34:50,126
could easily escalate
into nuclear confrontation.

1072
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:51,501
The hour's up.

1073
01:34:52,334 --> 01:34:53,918
Send the helicopter.

1074
01:34:55,668 --> 01:34:57,418
Le's recall the Seventh Fleet.

1075
01:34:59,334 --> 01:35:01,500
Pull the troops out of the DMZ.

1076
01:35:01,501 --> 01:35:03,376
We just lost South Korea.

1077
01:35:05,668 --> 01:35:07,750
Our Pentagon sources are now saying

1078
01:35:07,751 --> 01:35:08,917
that U.S. ground troops

1079
01:35:08,918 --> 01:35:11,625
have been given the order
to withdraw from Korea

1080
01:35:11,626 --> 01:35:14,042
for the first time in 60 years.

1081
01:35:14,043 --> 01:35:16,625
We're also hearing reports
that the U.S.'s Seventh Fleet

1082
01:35:16,626 --> 01:35:19,250
has been directed to pull back
in the region.

1083
01:35:19,251 --> 01:35:20,625
Although unconfirmed,

1084
01:35:20,626 --> 01:35:23,750
this historic turn of events
seems to be motivated

1085
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:26,125
by today's attack on the White House

1086
01:35:26,126 --> 01:35:28,625
which began
as the Prime Minister of Korea

1087
01:35:28,626 --> 01:35:30,709
was meeting with President Asher.

1088
01:35:55,293 --> 01:35:56,209
What are they doing?

1089
01:36:33,543 --> 01:36:35,958
Mike. We have to get Kang
and the president out

1090
01:36:35,959 --> 01:36:37,958
in the open and take out our best shot.

1091
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:39,043
Copy that, sir.

1092
01:36:53,459 --> 01:36:55,293
Bravo Team is in position.

1093
01:36:58,459 --> 01:37:01,168
Sir, we are ready.
All units are in position.

1094
01:37:08,584 --> 01:37:09,876
Here come the hostages.

1095
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:16,251
We count 11 targets, sir.

1096
01:37:16,751 --> 01:37:18,458
One of them's gotta be the president.

1097
01:37:18,459 --> 01:37:19,584
That's their ticket out.

1098
01:37:24,668 --> 01:37:26,751
Hercules Six in position.

1099
01:37:27,209 --> 01:37:28,751
Can you I.D. the president?

1100
01:37:31,751 --> 01:37:32,793
Negative.

1101
01:37:33,251 --> 01:37:34,751
Can you I.D. Kang?

1102
01:37:37,043 --> 01:37:37,917
Negative.

1103
01:37:37,918 --> 01:37:39,209
Targets unclear.

1104
01:37:41,418 --> 01:37:43,125
Sir, all ground units are in position.

1105
01:37:43,126 --> 01:37:45,293
Do we have the go-ahead to take them?

1106
01:37:55,001 --> 01:37:56,668
If we're gonna go, we gotta go now, sir.

1107
01:38:00,918 --> 01:38:02,418
Do we have the go-ahead, sir?

1108
01:38:05,668 --> 01:38:08,334
No. Too risky.
They could kill the president.

1109
01:38:10,793 --> 01:38:11,543
Yes, sir.

1110
01:38:12,168 --> 01:38:14,208
It's okay.
We have a tracking device on the chopper.

1111
01:38:27,418 --> 01:38:30,208
Holy shit. What was that? Was that us?

1112
01:38:30,209 --> 01:38:32,334
Negative, negative. That wasn't us.

1113
01:38:40,584 --> 01:38:44,042
Though it is not confirmed yet,
President Asher

1114
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:45,917
is believed to have been
among those killed

1115
01:38:45,918 --> 01:38:48,000
when the Blackhawk helicopter went down

1116
01:38:48,001 --> 01:38:50,251
in flames on the White House North Lawn.

1117
01:38:51,626 --> 01:38:54,625
And certainly, today's events
will be recorded in history

1118
01:38:54,626 --> 01:38:57,418
- as one of this country's darkest hours.
- Oh, my God.

1119
01:39:00,626 --> 01:39:02,168
The president's gone.

1120
01:39:20,876 --> 01:39:21,918
Mike?

1121
01:39:22,501 --> 01:39:23,918
What the hell just happened?

1122
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:26,626
I'm sorry to report...

1123
01:39:28,168 --> 01:39:30,459
the president was on that helicopter.

1124
01:39:31,168 --> 01:39:32,459
And Kang?

1125
01:39:33,209 --> 01:39:35,042
Kang killed himself.

1126
01:39:35,043 --> 01:39:36,918
And all the other hostages.

1127
01:39:38,793 --> 01:39:43,126
Wait. This doesn't add up.

1128
01:39:44,293 --> 01:39:45,875
It doesn't make sense.

1129
01:39:45,876 --> 01:39:47,334
What doesn't make sense?

1130
01:39:48,709 --> 01:39:50,792
Kang would not go out like that, sir.

1131
01:39:50,793 --> 01:39:52,168
That's not who he is.

1132
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:56,125
I think he's still in the bunker.

1133
01:39:56,126 --> 01:39:58,668
And he has the president.
He's gonna try and slip away.

1134
01:39:59,043 --> 01:40:01,042
If Kang is still on the premises
with the president,

1135
01:40:01,043 --> 01:40:02,834
you can't let him leave.

1136
01:40:04,376 --> 01:40:05,459
He won't.

1137
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:10,043
Huh? Who the hell does that?

1138
01:40:11,376 --> 01:40:12,334
Enough!

1139
01:40:15,959 --> 01:40:18,542
I read your Bible, Mr. President.

1140
01:40:18,543 --> 01:40:21,708
It says, the wages of sin is death.

1141
01:40:21,709 --> 01:40:23,376
You better keep that in mind.

1142
01:40:31,918 --> 01:40:32,708
What are you doing?

1143
01:40:32,709 --> 01:40:34,625
Cerberus has been activated.

1144
01:40:34,626 --> 01:40:36,376
We haven't launched any missiles yet.

1145
01:40:38,126 --> 01:40:39,918
I don't need to launch them.

1146
01:40:40,376 --> 01:40:43,000
The explosive force
within each hardened silo

1147
01:40:43,001 --> 01:40:44,543
will detonate the missiles.

1148
01:40:44,959 --> 01:40:47,418
Tens of millions of Americans
will perish.

1149
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:51,959
Your country will be a
cold, dark nuclear wasteland.

1150
01:40:54,834 --> 01:40:58,626
Now, too, America shall know
suffering and famine.

1151
01:41:00,876 --> 01:41:03,917
South Korean officials are saying
now that they've pulled out the reserves

1152
01:41:03,918 --> 01:41:06,833
and they're mobilizing additional
armored units in response...

1153
01:41:06,834 --> 01:41:09,458
Sir? Cerberus has been activated.

1154
01:41:09,459 --> 01:41:11,418
- What?
- NORAD confirms.

1155
01:41:12,834 --> 01:41:14,500
How did it come to this?

1156
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:16,792
We lost Korea and now our nukes?

1157
01:41:16,793 --> 01:41:18,917
- They couldn't have broken the code.
- That would be impossible.

1158
01:41:18,918 --> 01:41:21,417
They'd be on the bunker computer
for days to break three codes.

1159
01:41:21,418 --> 01:41:23,917
No, he only need to break one code.

1160
01:41:23,918 --> 01:41:26,209
But we haven't launched any missiles.

1161
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:31,834
They're gonna detonate them
in their silos.

1162
01:41:34,501 --> 01:41:35,626
How many?

1163
01:41:38,084 --> 01:41:39,293
All of 'em.

1164
01:41:47,293 --> 01:41:49,334
He's just opened the gates of hell.

1165
01:41:53,959 --> 01:41:55,418
Time to go, Mr. President!

1166
01:42:05,293 --> 01:42:07,626
You really think you're gonna
get out of here alive?

1167
01:42:08,334 --> 01:42:10,209
The world thinks we're both dead.

1168
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:13,334
And with you as insurance...

1169
01:44:09,918 --> 01:44:11,043
Come on, Mike.

1170
01:44:17,168 --> 01:44:19,126
Looks like you failed again, Mike.

1171
01:44:46,626 --> 01:44:47,501
Sir?

1172
01:44:48,001 --> 01:44:51,793
Sir, sir, look at me. Sir...

1173
01:44:53,876 --> 01:44:54,876
Sir.

1174
01:44:55,918 --> 01:45:00,083
Okay. It's gone through
and you've lost a little blood.

1175
01:45:00,084 --> 01:45:01,751
But I'm gonna get you outta here, okay?

1176
01:45:02,501 --> 01:45:03,793
Now, you know what to do.

1177
01:45:06,001 --> 01:45:07,208
Ben, Ben, come on!

1178
01:45:07,209 --> 01:45:09,042
- Cerberus.
- What?

1179
01:45:09,043 --> 01:45:10,543
Cerberus activated.

1180
01:45:10,959 --> 01:45:12,126
Cerberus.

1181
01:45:14,918 --> 01:45:16,250
Keep that pressed in.

1182
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:17,668
Sir! Ben!

1183
01:45:18,168 --> 01:45:19,500
You're gonna be okay.

1184
01:45:19,501 --> 01:45:20,376
All right.

1185
01:45:29,876 --> 01:45:31,042
This is Banning.

1186
01:45:31,043 --> 01:45:33,167
I have the president.
He's hurt, but alive.

1187
01:45:33,168 --> 01:45:34,918
How do I switch this fucking thing off?

1188
01:45:35,418 --> 01:45:37,293
- Hang on.
- Deactivation code!

1189
01:45:38,959 --> 01:45:42,709
Find a control panel marked,
"Countermand."

1190
01:45:43,751 --> 01:45:44,709
Countermand.

1191
01:45:45,543 --> 01:45:46,542
Got it!

1192
01:45:46,543 --> 01:45:51,209
Flip a blue-white switch marked,
"Initiate Recall."

1193
01:45:51,751 --> 01:45:53,209
Initiate recall.

1194
01:45:53,959 --> 01:45:54,668
Okay.

1195
01:45:55,168 --> 01:45:57,875
Deactivation sequence initiated.

1196
01:45:57,876 --> 01:45:59,417
Please enter abort command.

1197
01:45:59,418 --> 01:46:00,818
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

1198
01:46:01,334 --> 01:46:04,958
November. India.

1199
01:46:04,959 --> 01:46:06,125
Lima.

1200
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:10,000
- Wait, wait. Yep.
- 5-Oscar-hotel.

1201
01:46:10,001 --> 01:46:12,750
- Oscar, hotel.
- Backslash. Niner.

1202
01:46:12,751 --> 01:46:14,793
- Backslash.
- Victor. Kilo.

1203
01:46:15,251 --> 01:46:16,625
- Hash-tag
- What?

1204
01:46:16,626 --> 01:46:18,834
- Hash-tag.
- Shift 3!

1205
01:46:19,334 --> 01:46:20,583
Okay, fuck!

1206
01:46:20,584 --> 01:46:22,833
- Shift 3!
- Echo.

1207
01:46:22,834 --> 01:46:24,042
Sierra.

1208
01:46:24,043 --> 01:46:25,959
- Foxtrot.
- Foxtrot.

1209
01:46:26,876 --> 01:46:27,833
Is that it?

1210
01:46:27,834 --> 01:46:28,751
That's it.

1211
01:46:34,793 --> 01:46:37,334
Cerberus has been deactivated.

1212
01:46:46,959 --> 01:46:50,083
Sir. NORAD confirms...

1213
01:46:50,084 --> 01:46:51,709
Cerberus has been shut down.

1214
01:46:52,209 --> 01:46:53,334
Good.

1215
01:46:53,751 --> 01:46:56,084
Now get me Seoul and Pyongyang
on the line.

1216
01:47:25,418 --> 01:47:27,001
Are you ready, Mr. President?

1217
01:47:38,293 --> 01:47:39,334
All right.

1218
01:47:55,918 --> 01:47:57,626
Sorry about the house, sir.

1219
01:47:59,876 --> 01:48:03,209
It's okay. I believe it's insured.

1220
01:48:25,376 --> 01:48:26,918
We've lost good friends.

1221
01:48:28,918 --> 01:48:30,043
Family.

1222
01:48:31,918 --> 01:48:33,209
All good people.

1223
01:48:36,043 --> 01:48:38,334
- Heroes, every one of them. -Dad!

1224
01:48:39,334 --> 01:48:42,126
Our hearts and prayers
go out to their families.

1225
01:48:42,876 --> 01:48:44,459
And they will be remembered.

1226
01:48:45,543 --> 01:48:47,208
Nor will we forget...

1227
01:48:47,209 --> 01:48:50,333
those who serve out of the spotlight

1228
01:48:50,334 --> 01:48:54,001
to whom we owe our highest gratitude.

1229
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:05,168
Our foe did not come only to destroy
our things or our people.

1230
01:49:06,168 --> 01:49:08,708
They came to desecrate a way of life.

1231
01:49:08,709 --> 01:49:11,876
To foul our beliefs,
trample our freedom.

1232
01:49:12,334 --> 01:49:14,834
And in this, not only did they fail...

1233
01:49:15,376 --> 01:49:18,334
they granted us the greatest gift.

1234
01:49:19,584 --> 01:49:21,459
A chance at our rebirth.

1235
01:49:23,751 --> 01:49:26,543
We will rise. Renewed.

1236
01:49:27,043 --> 01:49:29,084
Stronger and united.

1237
01:49:29,584 --> 01:49:30,918
This is our time...

1238
01:49:31,626 --> 01:49:35,918
our chance to get back
to the best of who we are.

1239
01:49:36,751 --> 01:49:39,375
To lead by example with the dignity,

1240
01:49:39,376 --> 01:49:42,126
integrity and honor
that built this country

1241
01:49:42,793 --> 01:49:45,709
and which will build it once again.

1242
01:49:46,084 --> 01:49:47,418
May God bless you.

1243
01:49:48,543 --> 01:49:51,209
And may God bless
the United States of America.
