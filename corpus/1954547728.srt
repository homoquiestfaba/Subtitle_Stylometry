5
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:45,099
I don't want to know.

6
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,890
There's chicken pot pie
defrosting on the counter.

7
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:49,799
Dad is not home and
I'm going to therapy.

8
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,503
First stop of the day.
Just you and me, kid.

9
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:04,403
Just... pick a seat...

10
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:07,004
Any seat.

11
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:12,904
It's my first day
of high school.

12
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:17,804
I have seven new notebooks, a
skirt I hate and a stomachache.

13
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:38,705
Hi I'm Heather. I'm new here.

14
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:41,306
Are you? We moved
in here Saturday.

15
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:45,669
Cool shoes.

16
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:48,006
Oh, thanks.
I got them at a back to school sale.

17
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:50,606
I mean, I wanted them in
black but I wear an 8 1/2.

18
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:54,706
And they were a bit small, so I had to
find 9s. They only had a 9 in pink.

19
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:57,206
But they look good.

20
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:20,708
Name.

21
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:24,008
Name, freshman. It's
for the yearbook.

22
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:27,808
Melinda Sordino.

23
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:36,609
The school board decided that Trojans
didn't send a strong message of abstinence.

24
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:40,309
So now we've become the
Merryweather Hornets.

25
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:53,110
What are we supposed to cheer? 'We are
the Hornets, the horny horny Hornets!'?

26
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,611
Got a hall pass, young lady?
Come here.

27
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:21,911
Hustle, young lady!

28
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,712
Seven minutes past grace period.

29
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:33,112
Name.

30
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:36,612
Don't make this difficult. Name!

31
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,612
Melinda Sordino.

32
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,412
- Grade?
- Ninth.

33
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:52,113
That's one demerit, Sordino.
Get to class.

34
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:03,113
Biology... is the study of...

35
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:06,014
Is the study of... good...

36
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,514
Good.

37
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:12,314
Oh hello, dear. Do you
have a late pass?

38
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:18,014
It is the first day. Just
don't make it a habit of it.

39
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:21,414
- And your name is?
- Melinda Sordino.

40
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:28,115
Ok, your lab partner must be...
uh, let's see...

41
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:34,015
Oh, excellent!
And your name is?

42
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,515
Dave Petrakis.

43
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:44,216
My English teacher has no face.

44
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,716
I call her "Hair Woman".

45
00:05:57,016 --> 00:06:01,317
Grada Walkancros...
from Belgium.

46
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:05,817
We're so pleased to have
you here in America.

47
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:08,317
She doesn't speak English.

48
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,718
- Heather Billings.
- Here.

49
00:06:19,518 --> 00:06:21,118
Rachel Bruin.

50
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:25,618
Rochelle. Ah, Rochelle.
Rochelle.

51
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,518
Rachel Bruin. My ex-best friend.

52
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,631
Oh, and class?
Please tell me if I

53
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,620
pronounce your surname wrong or
if you have a preferred nickname.

54
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:08,027
911, what is the nature
of your emergency?

55
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:12,627
Hello? Hold the line, we'll
try to find your location.

56
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:17,528
- Rachel, wait...
- Are you nuts?

57
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:28,028
Where's Melinda?
I don't care!

58
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,429
Hi everybody. Uh,
welcome to Art.

59
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:36,729
The only class that will
teach you how to survive.

60
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,129
This is where you
can find your soul.

61
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,429
If you dare.

62
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,329
Don't ask me to show you
how to draw a face.

63
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,830
Ask me to help you
find the wind.

64
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,030
Good! Right, that's good! Can you
tell me what you're feeling?

65
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,830
Right now.

66
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,230
Ok, can anybody tell me what they're
actually feeling right now?

67
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:11,531
Does Algebra move you to tears?

68
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:18,431
Are numbers and words more
important than images?

69
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:23,031
Can anybody tell
me what this is?

70
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,532
A-globe?
A-globe.

71
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:32,532
What are you guys 13, 14? You've already
let them beat the creativity out of you?

72
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,432
It's ok.

73
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:39,322
I used to let my daughters
kick this around my

74
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:42,332
studio when it was too
wet to play outside.

75
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:47,433
And one day, Jennie put her
foot right through Texas and

76
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:51,433
the entire United States,
crumbled into the sea. See?

77
00:10:53,233 --> 00:11:00,533
I mean, you could, you could, ahem, paint
a wet muzzled dog chewing Alaska, right?

78
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,834
I mean, the possibilities
are endless.

79
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:14,834
It's almost too much, but uh, you all
are important enough to give it to. So.

80
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:21,935
Alright, so um, here you go.
In here is a piece of paper.

81
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:26,135
Great. And on that piece
of paper is a word.

82
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:31,935
You're gonna spend the rest of the
year turning that object into art.

83
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:40,036
- Mr. Freeman.
- Mm-hmm?

84
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:43,001
When I was little, I was
really scared of clowns and I

85
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,536
don't want to relapse and
have to go back into therapy.

86
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:50,036
Oh, yeah well fear is a
great place to begin art.

87
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:04,337
Hey! Whoa! You just chose your destiny.
You can't change that.

88
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,937
I learned how to draw a tree
in like the second grade.

89
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:15,138
Oh, really?

90
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:20,838
Well, you gonna show me?
It's ok, I won't grade you.

91
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,039
No commentary, please.

92
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,240
That's a pretty good start.

93
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,180
Let's see what it looks like
at the end of the year, huh?

94
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,141
It's Melinda Sordino.

95
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:29,843
Called the cops. You know,
and busted everyone...

96
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:35,044
You know, my buddy? You
know Jeff, his brother?

97
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:46,743
See you tomorrow!

98
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:16,744
Are you sick?

99
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,845
How was your first day?

100
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,445
- Fine.
- Look what I got at the store.

101
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,945
You don't like it, we can
always get store credit.

102
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,147
Where's the sweater?

103
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:00,847
I thought you said
it was returnable.

104
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:05,547
No, I got it on sale. Don't wear
it, don't wear it. It's fine.

105
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:07,847
Well then why'd you
say that it...

106
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,348
All that crap you hear on TV about
communication and expressing feelings

107
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:28,848
is a lie.

108
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:30,949
No one really cares
what you have to say.

109
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:34,249
So here's the plan. We join 5 clubs,
one for every day of the week.

110
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:36,949
But not like Latin club.
Cool stuff.

111
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:40,149
What do you want to join? Hey, maybe we
can tutor kids at the elementary school.

112
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:44,149
What about your friends from last year?
Don't you know Nicole?

113
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:46,650
I wonder how long it would
take for anyone to notice

114
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,350
if I just stopped talking.

115
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,850
0% body fat!

116
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,050
I was into bowling back in La Joya.
That was fun.

117
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,150
But the bowling club here does seem like
it really attracts the right people.

118
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,047
Hanging back is a very
common mistake most ninth

119
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,151
graders make.
I mean you shouldn't be intimidated.

120
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:10,351
Wait, are you getting darker than me?
Hold on.

121
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:32,252
- Oh man. You need a mouthguard.
- Gym should be illegal.

122
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:34,552
It's humiliating.

123
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:37,580
Hey, do you know the Martha clan?
They do all these

124
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:39,592
cool projects like feeding
the homeless and stuff.

125
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:41,964
Oh and they dress in different
color schemes depending

126
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:43,937
on the season.
I mean, I'm not good in fall tones.

127
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:46,313
And I said I can wear beige
instead of orange, but you know.

128
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:54,053
Oh no, Sordino. Front row.

129
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:58,554
I got my eye on you.

130
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:09,454
We're studying American history
for the ninth time in nine years.

131
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,180
Every year they say we're going
to get right up to the present

132
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:16,284
but we always get stuck in
the industrial revolution.

133
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:19,055
My family...

134
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:21,955
has been in this country...

135
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:24,055
for over 200 years.

136
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:27,655
We built this place.

137
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:30,955
We fought in every war. From
the first one to the last one.

138
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,756
We paid our taxes. They voted.

139
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:41,056
So, tell me why my
son can't get a job.

140
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:48,556
Reverse discrimination.

141
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:51,857
He wanted to be a firefighter.

142
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:56,057
Went up for the job

143
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:57,457
but he didn't get it.

144
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:03,657
What I'm suggesting here is maybe
if we had closed our borders

145
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:08,957
in 1900, then real Americans
would get the jobs they deserve.

146
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:16,258
Young lady.

147
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,250
Um, I think that we're all
foreigners, and should

148
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:21,658
just give the country back
to the Native Americans.

149
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,559
Now we have a debate, don't we?

150
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,759
Native Americans.

151
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,959
Maybe your son didn't get the job
because he wasn't good enough.

152
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,692
Or maybe he's lazy... or maybe
the guy was just better...

153
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:39,799
Watch your mouth, mister.

154
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,459
That's my son you're
talking about.

155
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:45,360
You know what? That's
enough debate.

156
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,360
Everybody take out your book.

157
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,360
Mr. Petrakis, please
take your seat.

158
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,060
If the class is debating, than any student
has a right to say what's on his mind.

159
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,261
I decide who talks in here, Mr.
Petrakis.

160
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,901
You opened a debate. You can't close it
just because it's not going your way.

161
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:10,329
Watch me! Take your seat, Mr.
Petrakis.

162
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:12,261
The constitution does
not recognize different

163
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,361
levels of citizenship based upon
the time spent in the country.

164
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:18,361
As a citizen and a student, I'm
protesting the tone of this lesson

165
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,962
as racist, intolerant,
and xenophobic.

166
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:25,062
Sit your butt in that chair, Mr. Petrakis.
And watch your mouth.

167
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:30,662
I tried to get this debate going and, uh,
you people turn it into a race thing.

168
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:34,682
Sit down, Mr. Petrakis, or you're gonna
go down to the principal's office.

169
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:50,063
Dave Petrakis is my new hero.

170
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:03,864
Hey, Rach.

171
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:08,264
How's it going?

172
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:10,064
Good.

173
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:14,164
I know.

174
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,965
Look...

175
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:20,465
I was wondering if we could...

176
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:28,465
Boni va cheri.

177
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:43,766
"Exchange students are
ruining our country."

178
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:53,667
- Sordino.
- Yo, fresh meat.

179
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,167
- What?
- Can't I say hello?

180
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:26,069
I'm sorry, it's just you
can't be standing here.

181
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:27,669
Alone.

182
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:30,269
You're just too pretty.

183
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,769
I'm not alone.
My friends are inside.

184
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:42,369
Well... would you like
to go dance with me?

185
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,270
Sure.

186
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,375
There is no point talking
to my ex-friends.

187
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,675
Our clan "The Plain Janes" has
been absorbed by rival groups.

188
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:35,176
Nicole hangs out with the jocks.
Rachel went all "Euro".

189
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:39,476
Ivy straddles two crowds...
The Goths and "The Marthas".

190
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:42,876
And then there's me...

191
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:46,976
I'm clanless.

192
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:11,378
Nice, Petrakis.
Look live, Missy.

193
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,747
It's impossible to listen to Miss Kane.
Her voice

194
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,678
sounds like an engine
that won't turn over.

195
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:21,327
- Plus she laughs at her own jokes.
- Alright, we're

196
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:23,378
beginning our unit on
genetics and reproduction.

197
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,979
In case you thought your
genes came from JC Penny...

198
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:32,379
Ah, oh no, these genes
are actually different.

199
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,490
Now you'll want to cut
your apples into four...

200
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:38,179
boys, I'm going to take
points off your grade...

201
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,380
What are you doing?
We need that.

202
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,983
- Heather has found a
- clan: "The Marthas".

203
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,783
Very Connecticut, very prep.

204
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,483
I suspect money changed hands.

205
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:49,783
I like your costume.

206
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,184
So, what are you guys?

207
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:59,084
- Ever heard of the 1920s?
- We're flappers at a speakeasy.

208
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:01,784
Andy Evans. 8 o'clock.

209
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:07,484
'Em, I think he's looking for you.
Fact, he called her last night.

210
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:10,984
Fact, he's gorgeous. Hey, could
you grab me an iced tea?

211
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:17,685
- Hello, ladies.
- Hey, what's up?

212
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:21,285
- Did you bring me a taco?
- Of course.

213
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:22,385
Just kidding.

214
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:24,085
No, take it.

215
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:32,786
- What is that?
- Just kidding.

216
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:38,586
- Did you bring my barrette?
- Ah, you know, I forgot it.

217
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,087
Maybe you should wear
it to the house.

218
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:46,386
- I think that looks really sexy on you.
- Thank you.

219
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:49,687
What time do your parents
come home tonight? Around 6.

220
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:05,188
- What's with her?
- She's a freak who needs chapstick.

221
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:06,488
And a life.

222
00:27:07,688 --> 00:27:10,488
- I don't want her eating with us anymore.
- Nice, Siobhan.

223
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,188
What, we're not social workers.

224
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:15,688
- The girl has problems.
- Yeah, who doesn't?

225
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:32,089
Hey, you're the tree.

226
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:36,489
You can eat lunch in here, if you want.
It is against school rules, but

227
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:37,889
I'm kind of a rebel, so...

228
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,290
Here you go.

229
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,131
That's not a placemat.
Ok, the rule is that if

230
00:28:03,143 --> 00:28:08,291
you're gonna be in here,
you got to be working. So.

231
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:14,891
Choose your weapon.
Do something, anything.

232
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:19,592
Hey, does this inspire you?

233
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:21,292
No?

234
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:43,393
So you going
trick-or-treating tonight?

235
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:46,493
No.

236
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:51,193
Ah, you don't like candy?

237
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:56,394
- I'm too old.
- Oh, right.

238
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:02,394
Yeah, I got kids, so...

239
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:04,894
Guess I never get
too old, right?

240
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:24,995
- Last year we were witches.
- Who's "we"?

241
00:29:29,496 --> 00:29:31,996
My ex-best friends.

242
00:29:48,197 --> 00:29:50,897
What are you doing? No.

243
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:54,097
You gotta give things a chance.

244
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:12,598
Close your eyes.

245
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:16,398
Just do it. I'm the teacher.

246
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,999
Can you picture a tree?
Any tree.

247
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,099
There it is.

248
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:38,799
It's burned in your retina.

249
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
You got it.

250
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,200
Do it.

251
00:31:24,402 --> 00:31:26,802
Dave Petrakis invited me
over to do lab homework.

252
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:29,402
I said no.

253
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:31,402
No, thanks. I just... I can't.

254
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:48,903
Oh, my God.

255
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,504
I'm turning into "Hair Woman".

256
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:07,004
Oh, damn!
The Turkey.

257
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:20,405
- Maybe we should just get pizza.
- No.

258
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:21,905
It's Thanksgiving.

259
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:26,506
It just needs to thaw.

260
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:37,706
How's she doing?

261
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:45,007
It's Thanksgiving.

262
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:51,807
Hey, you wanna go for doughnuts?

263
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:10,308
How's school?

264
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,808
Fine.

265
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:27,109
You're boiling it?

266
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:29,209
It's too big to put
in the microwave.

267
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,910
He doesn't think
it's gonna thaw.

268
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,810
No!
Not you, Ted.

269
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:03,364
We can wash it. -Tell Julie
to restock the faux bells

270
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:06,611
and to take the sign out
of the window, alright?

271
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,949
No, they're in a green
box by the register...

272
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:10,961
Sorry.

273
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:14,512
Mel, see if there's any
potatoes over there.

274
00:34:18,612 --> 00:34:21,012
Can we just forget it?

275
00:34:21,712 --> 00:34:25,712
You know, I've got a
crisis down at the store.

276
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:28,412
We'll go out to dinner, ok?

277
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:32,313
My treat.

278
00:35:03,614 --> 00:35:05,514
Hey, Dan, good stuff.

279
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:12,615
Yes, you are on fire, Melinda!
Yes! You are the bird.

280
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:17,341
Hey, sacrifice yourself
to abandon family values

281
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,315
and canned yams.
This is wonderful!

282
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:22,415
But keep thinking tree.

283
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:26,696
You know what I'm thinking?

284
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:28,516
More glue.

285
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:33,416
F minus. Just kidding.

286
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:46,517
Where's the tree?

287
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:49,817
It's firewood.

288
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:51,417
Get it?

289
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,717
You can do better than that.

290
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:30,519
It's scary! Like in a weird way.
Not clown-scary.

291
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:33,619
How do I say this?

292
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,720
It's like you don't want to
look at it for too long.

293
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,220
Excellent.

294
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,620
This is excellent.

295
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,820
What does this say to you?

296
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,321
Do you want me to
tell you what I see?

297
00:36:56,321 --> 00:36:57,321
Alright.

298
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:04,421
I see a girl caught in the
remains of a holiday gone bad.

299
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:11,121
Her flesh, picked
off, day after day.

300
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:16,154
The palm tree, might be
like a broken dream.

301
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:19,122
I don't know, it
definitely has meaning.

302
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:22,122
A lot of pain.

303
00:37:23,122 --> 00:37:24,122
That's good.

304
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:26,722
Good job, Mel.

305
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:34,423
There is no kissing
in the hallway.

306
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,943
Hey, come to the pep rally with me.
I brought extra pompoms. Come on!

307
00:37:57,424 --> 00:38:00,724
Hey! I know these guys.
They're on the newspaper.

308
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:08,725
This is Melinda Sordino. She was very
nice to me when I first got here.

309
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:12,128
- You're Melinda Sordino?
- Yeah.

310
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:16,628
Aren't you the one who called
the cops at Carl Ryder's party?

311
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:22,329
My brother was arrested at that party.
Got fired because of it.

312
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:20,632
I cannot believe.

313
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:22,132
What?

314
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:27,432
- Never mind.
- What?

315
00:40:28,032 --> 00:40:30,433
- Never mind.
- What? You can't say 'never mind'!

316
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:36,333
Let's go for a drive.

317
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:40,633
Come on, let's go.

318
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:46,534
Maybe I should tell my friends!

319
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:48,935
Tell your friends
you're with me.

320
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:53,334
- Alright?
- Yeah.

321
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:06,835
You want to?

322
00:41:08,735 --> 00:41:10,535
Wanna what?

323
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:19,535
Let me out. Let me
talk to my friends.

324
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:26,436
No.

325
00:41:29,636 --> 00:41:32,336
Stop. No.

326
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,236
No.

327
00:41:40,637 --> 00:41:41,937
No, no, no.

328
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:55,437
No, it's alright. It's alright.

329
00:41:58,238 --> 00:42:00,738
It's alright. It's
over now, okay.

330
00:42:01,138 --> 00:42:02,438
Okay.

331
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:09,238
The bogeyman is gone. He went right
out that way. It's okay. You ok now?

332
00:42:12,638 --> 00:42:14,238
No.

333
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,439
Oh, honey.

334
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:21,439
I know that it's been
a rough year for you.

335
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,039
I do.

336
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:27,539
I really thought you and Rachel
were gonna patch things up.

337
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,540
You know, sometimes, people just...
suck.

338
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:40,740
But now, you have got to pull yourself
up by the bootstraps and get on with it.

339
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,440
You're not even going to remember
any of this in 5 years. I swear.

340
00:42:52,141 --> 00:42:55,841
Come on. I'll make it home early tonight.
Can rent a movie.

341
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:57,841
Yeah?

342
00:43:13,942 --> 00:43:16,842
Today is career day.

343
00:43:27,443 --> 00:43:34,243
(Am I: A) A helper b) A doer
c) A planner d) A dreamer?

344
00:43:57,144 --> 00:44:00,606
Every word Hawthorne
wrote; Every comma, every

345
00:44:00,618 --> 00:44:03,945
paragraph break, these
were done on purpose.

346
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:10,245
It is our job to try and figure out
what he's really trying to say.

347
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:13,133
Why couldn't he just say
what he meant? Would

348
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:15,145
they pin a Scarlet
letter on his chest?

349
00:44:15,645 --> 00:44:18,245
- As for straightforward...
- The house...

350
00:44:18,945 --> 00:44:23,046
with the chunks of
glass in its walls...

351
00:44:23,946 --> 00:44:25,846
Is a symbol of what?

352
00:44:29,846 --> 00:44:34,946
It would reflect, sparkle.

353
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:37,546
Come on, people...

354
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:41,347
The house symbolizes?

355
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,147
Yes.

356
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:47,147
How do you know it's
what he meant to say?

357
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:49,567
I mean, you could just make all that up.
It's just a story.

358
00:44:50,547 --> 00:44:52,047
This is Hawthorne.

359
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:57,648
One of America's greatest novelists.
And not that makes any difference...

360
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:01,948
but I wrote my
dissertation on Hawthorne.

361
00:45:03,848 --> 00:45:06,448
Fine, but...

362
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:08,504
I thought we were all
supposed to have opinions

363
00:45:08,516 --> 00:45:10,274
here. I mean, it's a good
story, especially...

364
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:13,418
when Hester and that guy fall in love.
But I don't really believe in symbolism.

365
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:16,349
I mean, you can just
make all that up.

366
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:24,849
Alright, class.

367
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:29,149
I want you all to write
a 500 word essay...

368
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:31,349
on symbolism.

369
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,650
And then...

370
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,350
Poor "Hair Woman".

371
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,150
Turn it in.

372
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,850
I hope they send her to a conference or
something. I'm ready to help pay for a sub.

373
00:45:55,851 --> 00:45:57,551
I guess you all must
be bad students.

374
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:02,651
Because, apparently, I gave away
too many A's last trimester.

375
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:07,351
Has anybody in here
learned anything?

376
00:46:10,552 --> 00:46:15,352
They cut my budget in half because
art isn't important, see.

377
00:46:15,452 --> 00:46:18,352
And then I get reamed
for grade inflation?

378
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,653
Sorry.

379
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:32,353
Go back to work.

380
00:46:42,653 --> 00:46:43,954
Mr. Freeman.

381
00:47:00,054 --> 00:47:01,555
Ivy.

382
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:03,755
Will you take her to
the nurse, please?

383
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:07,455
Hold it up.

384
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:12,555
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

385
00:47:16,455 --> 00:47:18,155
Ivy's being nice.

386
00:47:19,956 --> 00:47:21,556
Say something.

387
00:47:23,756 --> 00:47:25,856
My throat is dry.

388
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:28,356
It hurts.

389
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,856
This one is the one I think I'm gonna use.
It's like... Really, just like...

390
00:47:33,956 --> 00:47:36,857
Heather landed a modeling job at
a department store in the mall.

391
00:47:37,857 --> 00:47:39,757
It's paying off in
major "Martha" points.

392
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,351
It is so disgusting, I don't know why.
And then like

393
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:45,957
that one? It just was like,
what was I thinking?

394
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:49,857
You want to start?

395
00:47:50,257 --> 00:47:55,558
Now remember, we're just taking a peek
inside today. Don't remove anything.

396
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:58,458
It's very hard to put it back.

397
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:03,158
Are you sure you want to do?

398
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,258
Do you want me to do?

399
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:11,658
No, um, I got it.

400
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,459
It's one clean line down the middle.
Like a zipper.

401
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,460
Melinda.

402
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,760
Hello?

403
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:42,060
Can you count backwards from 10? Who
is the President of the United States?

404
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,960
Come on, open your eyes.

405
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,261
Oh my gosh. Dave, don't hit her!

406
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:51,661
It's what you're supposed to do.
My Dad's a doctor.

407
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:52,761
Melinda.

408
00:48:54,561 --> 00:48:56,361
Who is the governor of Texas?

409
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,762
It's beautiful.

410
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:12,862
You can't go wrong
with the classic "V".

411
00:49:16,962 --> 00:49:19,662
Wow, this is great! You shouldn't
have spent so much money though.

412
00:49:19,762 --> 00:49:21,762
It's ok, I wanted to.

413
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:25,063
That way you won't bleed all
over the bathroom floor, honey.

414
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:30,763
And these are for you.
Open the big one first.

415
00:49:37,863 --> 00:49:42,064
It's for your room. It'll
help you fall asleep.

416
00:49:53,464 --> 00:49:55,464
Oh, we noticed you
were drawing, so...

417
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:57,465
I hope we got the right kind.

418
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:15,565
You know this thing
has a sleep alarm.

419
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:20,878
I don't know what quadra surf means?
What do you think

420
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,466
it is?
I think it means you surf multiple quads.

421
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,566
Headphone Jack.

422
00:50:26,966 --> 00:50:29,266
Front and rear a/v Jacks.

423
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:32,866
Is it 19 inches across or high?

424
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:34,467
It's 19 all the way around.

425
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:26,469
I hate winter.

426
00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:29,570
I've lived in the Midwest my
whole life and I hate winter.

427
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:32,870
It starts too early
and it ends too late.

428
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,470
Why doesn't everyone
just move to Florida?

429
00:51:54,871 --> 00:51:56,671
Attention Merry
Weather students:

430
00:51:57,071 --> 00:52:01,471
- The final tally is in.
- Bees: 35, Icebergs: 17.

431
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:06,672
Hilltopers: 6, Wombats: 84.

432
00:52:07,272 --> 00:52:10,672
We will now be the home of:
"The Merry Weather Wombats."

433
00:52:11,672 --> 00:52:13,398
What in the world is a Wombat?

434
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,882
For those of you who
didn't vote, maybe you've

435
00:52:15,894 --> 00:52:18,472
learned a valuable lesson
today about democracy.

436
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,373
Oh hey, Melinda.

437
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:27,573
Can we have a heart to heart at lunch?
It's kind of important.

438
00:52:28,073 --> 00:52:29,973
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, great.

439
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,774
This is really awkward.

440
00:52:42,274 --> 00:52:44,874
No matter what...

441
00:52:45,574 --> 00:52:46,734
Oh, I don't want to say that.

442
00:52:47,774 --> 00:52:50,674
I mean, we kind of paired up
at the beginning of school.

443
00:52:50,774 --> 00:52:52,254
When I was new and
didn't know anyone.

444
00:52:53,074 --> 00:52:54,714
And that was really,
really sweet of you.

445
00:52:56,074 --> 00:52:57,074
But...

446
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,475
I think it's time that we
both admit to each other that

447
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:02,475
we're just very
different people.

448
00:53:03,975 --> 00:53:06,801
I mean, I have my modeling
and I like to shop.

449
00:53:06,825 --> 00:53:07,825
I like to shop.

450
00:53:09,675 --> 00:53:12,375
You don't like anything. You're the
most depressed person I've ever met.

451
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:14,075
And excuse me for
saying this, but...

452
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:16,976
I think you need
professional help.

453
00:53:23,976 --> 00:53:27,476
So, you're blowing me off
because I'm a little depressed?

454
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:30,776
Once you get through
this 'life sucks' phase,

455
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:32,916
I'm sure lots of people will
want to be your friend.

456
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:38,577
But for right now, I don't think
we should have lunch together.

457
00:53:47,077 --> 00:53:49,677
Look, I need to be alone. And I'm
glad you're so enthusiastic, but...

458
00:53:49,777 --> 00:53:50,877
I just need some space.

459
00:53:57,978 --> 00:54:01,578
- Rise and shine, Melinda.
- Your report card came this morning.

460
00:54:02,178 --> 00:54:04,658
I'm only going to say this once.
You gotta get those grades up.

461
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:06,878
- Way up.
- I'll handle this, alright?

462
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:10,679
Honey, we just want you to do
your best, and we know that

463
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:12,579
your best is a lot
better than this, okay?

464
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:16,779
What happened with social studies?
This Mr. Neck gave you a "D".

465
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,879
We want you to ask Neck how
you can raise your grade.

466
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:24,479
This is not gonna look good on
your college application, sweetie.

467
00:54:24,979 --> 00:54:27,680
- I had to go to state.
- She knows.

468
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,280
You'll go today,
won't you, honey?

469
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:00,581
Excuse me, sir.

470
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,382
I was wondering if...

471
00:55:06,482 --> 00:55:09,182
I was... Come on,
Sordino, spit it out.

472
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:13,082
You have to learn to annunciate,
or else no one will listen.

473
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:18,582
I was wondering if there was any
way I could raise my grade?

474
00:55:20,282 --> 00:55:22,083
Parents got the
report card, huh?

475
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:27,083
No, I just wanted to.

476
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:28,903
Why I should give
you that chance?

477
00:55:31,283 --> 00:55:34,083
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

478
00:55:35,783 --> 00:55:37,383
I mean, isn't that
what Jesus said?

479
00:55:39,884 --> 00:55:41,884
Are you being smart with me?

480
00:55:44,184 --> 00:55:47,041
Ok, I'm feeling generous,
just because I don't

481
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:49,984
want to have to see your
face in summer school.

482
00:55:51,284 --> 00:55:55,484
Write me a report on a cultural
influence at the turn of the century.

483
00:55:58,285 --> 00:56:00,085
And it better be good.

484
00:56:03,885 --> 00:56:05,585
It will be.

485
00:56:08,985 --> 00:56:10,785
I'll write about
the Suffragettes.

486
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:15,086
Before they came along, women
were treated like dogs.

487
00:56:49,187 --> 00:56:53,188
To get credit, you have
to deliver it orally.

488
00:56:54,088 --> 00:56:56,888
Tomorrow, at the
beginning of class.

489
00:57:19,289 --> 00:57:22,589
- Can you help me with something?
- Yeah, sure. What's up?

490
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,290
Sordino?

491
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:42,328
Mr. Patrucus.

492
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,591
The Suffragettes fought
for their right to speak.

493
00:57:45,391 --> 00:57:48,591
They were attacked, arrested and
thrown in jail for daring to do

494
00:57:48,691 --> 00:57:49,791
what they wanted to do.

495
00:57:50,891 --> 00:57:53,491
Like them, Melinda is willing to
stand up for what she believes.

496
00:57:53,591 --> 00:57:55,491
That no one should be
forced to give speeches.

497
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:58,791
- What is this?
- Melinda had to deliver her report...

498
00:57:58,891 --> 00:58:01,811
to the class as part of the assignment.
She made copies everyone can read.

499
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:03,292
Oh no you don't.

500
00:58:03,592 --> 00:58:07,292
When I say oral, I mean oral.
Now you, sit down!

501
00:58:08,392 --> 00:58:12,092
And you, read that report.
Open your mouth, Sordino.

502
00:58:12,592 --> 00:58:13,892
Open your damn mouth.

503
00:58:21,993 --> 00:58:25,293
I am so sick of your attitude.

504
00:58:29,793 --> 00:58:32,193
I forgot the Suffragettes
were hauled off to jail.

505
00:58:32,693 --> 00:58:34,093
Duh.

506
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:37,293
Well...

507
00:58:40,094 --> 00:58:42,694
Oh, for the love of God,
open your mouth, Melinda.

508
00:58:43,494 --> 00:58:46,494
- This is childish, honey.
- I don't know why she's doing this to us.

509
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:49,294
We're not ganging up on
you, we're here to help.

510
00:58:49,394 --> 00:58:51,194
Let's start with grades.

511
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,482
This isn't what we
expect of you, Melissa.

512
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:54,094
Melinda.

513
00:58:54,494 --> 00:58:56,054
Last year you were a
straight B student.

514
00:58:56,295 --> 00:58:59,095
No behavioral problems,
a few absences.

515
00:59:00,295 --> 00:59:01,595
What you have to say?

516
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:07,495
She's mute. She's mute.
She's not saying anything.

517
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:11,995
I think that we need to explore
the family dynamics at play.

518
00:59:12,395 --> 00:59:15,396
All I know is, last year I had a sweet,
loving little girl, and now she's

519
00:59:15,496 --> 00:59:17,396
flushing her grades
down the toilet.

520
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:21,896
What have you folks done to her? I play
golf with the school board president.

521
00:59:21,996 --> 00:59:25,076
- Did you know that? Did you know that?
- Nobody cares who you play golf with.

522
00:59:25,196 --> 00:59:30,896
- Can I just remind everyone that
- we need to, number one: Reassure

523
00:59:31,597 --> 00:59:32,797
number two: Stay open,

524
00:59:33,897 --> 00:59:36,597
and number three: Don't judge.

525
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:38,197
How old are you?

526
00:59:43,097 --> 00:59:44,097
Listen.

527
00:59:44,597 --> 00:59:48,397
The Suffragettes were all about speaking
up. You can't speak up for your rights

528
00:59:48,497 --> 00:59:49,497
and be silent.

529
00:59:51,598 --> 00:59:52,998
I thought what you
did was cool...

530
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:56,898
but you can't make a difference
unless you speak up.

531
00:59:58,398 --> 01:00:00,038
Do you lecture all your
friends like this?

532
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:02,998
Only the ones I like.

533
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:07,299
Gotta go.

534
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,299
Wow!
Melinda, you look pretty.

535
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,401
"Thanks for understanding.
You the sweetest! Heather."

536
01:00:58,201 --> 01:01:01,602
Hi, class. Sorry I'm late.
I was... delayed.

537
01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:08,802
There was an accident and
I had to catch a ride.

538
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:15,702
Andy.

539
01:01:29,703 --> 01:01:30,703
Good.

540
01:01:31,703 --> 01:01:32,703
That's nice.

541
01:01:56,305 --> 01:01:58,505
You need to visit the
mind of "The Great One".

542
01:02:02,705 --> 01:02:04,405
Picasso.

543
01:02:05,505 --> 01:02:06,705
Picasso.

544
01:02:07,305 --> 01:02:08,805
Who saw the truth.

545
01:02:10,805 --> 01:02:11,906
Who painted the truth.

546
01:02:13,706 --> 01:02:15,406
And ripped it from the earth...

547
01:02:17,106 --> 01:02:19,106
With two angry hands.

548
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:40,807
Excuse me.

549
01:02:45,507 --> 01:02:47,408
It's "Night in Venice".

550
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:53,008
This is the color of
an accountant's soul.

551
01:02:54,008 --> 01:02:59,708
A love rejected. This...
I once...

552
01:03:00,508 --> 01:03:04,808
grew mold on an orange this color
when I was living in Boston.

553
01:03:06,609 --> 01:03:07,609
And uh...

554
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:11,209
These are various memories
of the school board.

555
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:19,309
See uh, if something's eating at
you, you gotta find a way to use it.

556
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:53,811
It's kind of dark in here.

557
01:04:02,512 --> 01:04:04,912
Have you seen Rochelle?

558
01:04:05,612 --> 01:04:08,312
Bruin?

559
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,612
She was supposed to meet me.

560
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:17,413
Hello?

561
01:04:19,013 --> 01:04:20,413
Anybody home?
Are you deaf?

562
01:04:29,613 --> 01:04:31,913
I was just thinking that...

563
01:04:34,013 --> 01:04:36,814
Andy, I've been looking for
you for like half an hour.

564
01:04:39,114 --> 01:04:39,552
Rochelle.

565
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:40,914
I've been wandering up
and down the halls...

566
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:42,489
I was just asking your
friend where you were.

567
01:04:42,501 --> 01:04:43,214
She's not my friend.

568
01:04:43,314 --> 01:04:44,914
- I thought she was your friend, alright?
- No, she's not.

569
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,114
- Why were you asking her?
- I've been looking for you.

570
01:04:47,214 --> 01:04:48,914
Why didn't you wait...

571
01:04:49,114 --> 01:04:51,314
Just shut up, alright?

572
01:04:51,914 --> 01:04:54,215
I was looking for you, alright?

573
01:04:55,415 --> 01:04:57,315
- Andy.
- It is Valentine's Day. Okay?

574
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:37,717
It's time for a mental health day.
So conjugate this:

575
01:05:38,217 --> 01:05:42,017
I cut class, you cut class,
he/she/it cuts class.

576
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,520
I should probably tell someone.
Just anyone.

577
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,720
Get it over with.

578
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,420
Blurt it out.

579
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:17,726
It's hard to sleep at home.

580
01:08:18,326 --> 01:08:21,526
How long would it take for the nurses
to figure out I don't belong here?

581
01:08:23,726 --> 01:08:25,926
Would they let me
rest for a few days?

582
01:09:42,431 --> 01:09:43,631
It happened.

583
01:09:44,131 --> 01:09:46,731
There's no avoiding it.
No forgetting.

584
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:37,034
Mellie, there's a
friend here to see you.

585
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:45,834
I hate being a "Martha". You
were so right not to join.

586
01:10:45,934 --> 01:10:47,534
I mean, all I am was
their little slave.

587
01:10:48,234 --> 01:10:51,635
Ok, it was supposed to be me and Megan
Shevan decorating the Holiday Inn for prom,

588
01:10:52,135 --> 01:10:54,835
and now Megan Shevan can't do it.
And I'm totally screwed.

589
01:10:55,935 --> 01:10:59,035
Mel, you have to help me. They have some
sales meeting in there until like 3.

590
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:01,175
But then, they'll let us start.
I know we can do it.

591
01:11:02,135 --> 01:11:05,235
You are so great. I
owe you big time.

592
01:11:06,735 --> 01:11:08,836
What if I help you
re-decorate your room?

593
01:11:09,236 --> 01:11:11,236
I know, a nice sea foam green.

594
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:16,536
- No.
- Okay, or something rich, like...

595
01:11:16,836 --> 01:11:17,836
like, eggplant.

596
01:11:19,236 --> 01:11:20,236
No.

597
01:11:20,736 --> 01:11:21,836
I mean...

598
01:11:22,636 --> 01:11:24,636
- I won't help you.
- But you have to.

599
01:11:25,837 --> 01:11:27,237
- No, I don't.
- But...

600
01:11:27,737 --> 01:11:28,737
Why?

601
01:11:28,837 --> 01:11:31,737
Because I was nice to you
in the beginning of school,

602
01:11:32,337 --> 01:11:34,437
when I didn't even like you.

603
01:11:35,337 --> 01:11:37,337
And you blew me off.

604
01:11:38,637 --> 01:11:41,337
Because you're a self-centered
social-climber.

605
01:11:42,237 --> 01:11:44,397
And you know what?
I know what I want to do to my room.

606
01:11:45,038 --> 01:11:46,838
And it doesn't involve eggplant.

607
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,538
I think you should go.

608
01:13:03,042 --> 01:13:04,542
Why should I worry about Rachel?

609
01:13:05,942 --> 01:13:08,242
This'll hurt her.

610
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:10,342
We were best friends
for nine years.

611
01:13:10,942 --> 01:13:12,343
That counts for something.

612
01:13:13,243 --> 01:13:14,943
She's a traitor.

613
01:13:15,343 --> 01:13:17,223
- And a witch.
- She doesn't know what happened.

614
01:13:18,243 --> 01:13:21,243
- She'll hate me.
- She already hates you.

615
01:13:25,643 --> 01:13:27,143
I hope he breaks her heart.

616
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:28,050
- Hey.
- Hey.

617
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:32,750
- Homework?
- Kind of.

618
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:36,451
I'm going to France this summer
with the International Club.

619
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:37,551
That's great.

620
01:15:38,151 --> 01:15:40,151
I mean, you always
talked about traveling.

621
01:15:43,051 --> 01:15:45,239
Do you remember when we
read "Heidi" and then

622
01:15:45,251 --> 01:15:47,451
we tried to melt the
cheese in the fireplace?

623
01:15:59,152 --> 01:16:00,852
So you're going
to prom with him?

624
01:16:02,352 --> 01:16:04,152
Yeah.

625
01:16:04,552 --> 01:16:05,652
He's so great.

626
01:16:07,252 --> 01:16:09,852
So awesome, and
gorgeous and yummy.

627
01:16:12,453 --> 01:16:14,373
What are you going to do
when he goes to college?

628
01:16:15,853 --> 01:16:18,653
I can't even think about it.
It hurts too much.

629
01:16:20,553 --> 01:16:22,653
He said he'd transfer
somewhere around here.

630
01:16:23,253 --> 01:16:24,553
I'll wait for him.

631
01:16:25,053 --> 01:16:27,553
But you've only been going out
with him for like 2 months.

632
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:32,354
What do you want, anyway?

633
01:16:35,454 --> 01:16:37,654
I'm just really sorry we
couldn't be friends this year.

634
01:16:41,154 --> 01:16:44,954
- Are you still mad about the party?
- No.

635
01:16:46,355 --> 01:16:49,655
I mean, it was dumb to call the
cops, but we could've just left.

636
01:17:17,056 --> 01:17:20,756
"I was raped."

637
01:17:25,657 --> 01:17:27,657
Oh my God, why
didn't you tell me?

638
01:17:30,357 --> 01:17:33,657
When police came, everyone started
freaking out. I got scared.

639
01:17:34,557 --> 01:17:36,057
I walked home.

640
01:17:36,557 --> 01:17:39,357
After that night, I
couldn't tell anyone.

641
01:17:43,658 --> 01:17:45,258
Did you get pregnant?
Did you get AIDS?

642
01:17:45,358 --> 01:17:46,358
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

643
01:17:47,358 --> 01:17:49,458
I mean, no, I didn't
get pregnant.

644
01:17:51,058 --> 01:17:52,058
I'm fine.

645
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:55,458
Was it someone from the school?

646
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:00,759
Who was it?

647
01:18:04,659 --> 01:18:06,459
Melinda, tell me.

648
01:18:09,459 --> 01:18:11,759
It was Andy Evans.

649
01:18:12,459 --> 01:18:13,459
What?

650
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:15,960
I can't believe you!

651
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,060
Liar! You're jealous!
I'm popular...

652
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,040
and I'm going to Prom. And
now you tell me this?

653
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:24,060
That's twisted, Melinda. Seriously.
You're sick.

654
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,660
You need help.

655
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:54,262
Coming?

656
01:18:58,462 --> 01:18:59,962
Hello?

657
01:19:01,062 --> 01:19:02,862
Earth to Rochelle.

658
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:08,162
Alright. Okay.

659
01:19:09,263 --> 01:19:10,663
What did I do this time?

660
01:19:14,763 --> 01:19:15,763
Tell me.

661
01:19:21,763 --> 01:19:24,463
Remember when you asked
me about Melinda Sordino?

662
01:19:26,363 --> 01:19:27,864
The girl in the art room.

663
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:33,264
Why did you ask me if I
was friends with her?

664
01:19:37,264 --> 01:19:38,264
Do you know her?

665
01:19:41,964 --> 01:19:43,364
How do you know her?

666
01:19:45,765 --> 01:19:47,065
I was looking for you.

667
01:19:49,865 --> 01:19:50,965
Bitch.

668
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:07,266
A revolutionary is only
as good as his analysis.

669
01:20:08,066 --> 01:20:09,066
What does that mean?

670
01:20:16,466 --> 01:20:18,266
Melinda. Better late than never.

671
01:20:18,766 --> 01:20:22,567
Why's a revolutionary only as
good as his or her analysis?

672
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:28,567
I think you should know what you stand
for, not just what you're against.

673
01:20:29,167 --> 01:20:31,287
We should be able to shout
how things could be better.

674
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:36,267
That's pretty darn good.

675
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:41,668
Rochelle, so glad
you could join us.

676
01:20:49,168 --> 01:20:52,168
- I need to talk with you for one second.
- No, let go. Andy get off of me!

677
01:21:04,669 --> 01:21:06,569
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, stranger.

678
01:21:08,769 --> 01:21:12,369
- What's the occasion?
- I just came from a job interview.

679
01:21:12,769 --> 01:21:14,570
Really, how'd it go?

680
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,370
Good, I think. Yeah?

681
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:21,370
- Yeah.
- Dad, that is so great.

682
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:31,870
Here's what I learned in Bio: If
the seed is planted too deep,

683
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,050
it doesn't warm up in time.

684
01:21:34,071 --> 01:21:37,771
Once the plant surfaces, it sprouts
leaves so it can absorb more sun.

685
01:21:39,471 --> 01:21:43,571
If someone picks the flower, the plant
grows another bloom to produce more seeds.

686
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:49,972
Melinda.

687
01:21:51,372 --> 01:21:53,872
Will you sign my yearbook?

688
01:21:54,272 --> 01:21:57,072
- I'm not in it.
- Yeah you are.

689
01:21:57,572 --> 01:21:58,572
Right here.

690
01:22:01,772 --> 01:22:03,272
Doesn't really look like you.

691
01:22:08,273 --> 01:22:09,673
It is me.

692
01:22:17,673 --> 01:22:19,923
Hey, uh, do you want to
go out for some Chinese

693
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,773
food tonight?
A bunch of us are going.

694
01:22:22,273 --> 01:22:23,373
Do you want to come?

695
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:26,674
Yeah, sure.

696
01:22:29,874 --> 01:22:31,374
Thanks.

697
01:22:32,974 --> 01:22:34,974
So, ah, what are you
up to this summer?

698
01:22:36,374 --> 01:22:38,274
I'm going to take an
Art class in the city.

699
01:22:38,874 --> 01:22:39,874
That's cool.

700
01:22:40,774 --> 01:22:45,175
I think I'm going to intern at my Uncle's
lab. It's good experience for Pre-Med.

701
01:22:47,475 --> 01:22:50,675
I forgot something, but
call me about tonight, ok?

702
01:22:51,075 --> 01:22:52,075
Alright.

703
01:23:03,676 --> 01:23:06,276
Definitely check out the
ouiji exhibit at the "ICP".

704
01:23:06,876 --> 01:23:07,876
Hey, Melinda!

705
01:23:08,676 --> 01:23:09,343
Glad you're here.

706
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:11,252
Thanks for everything Mr.
F and I really hope I

707
01:23:11,276 --> 01:23:13,476
make enough money so I can
afford one of your paintings.

708
01:23:14,276 --> 01:23:16,876
Yeah, alright, go.
Alright, go on, have fun.

709
01:23:17,776 --> 01:23:19,277
Make the world a better place.

710
01:23:23,377 --> 01:23:24,577
You leaving?

711
01:23:33,977 --> 01:23:35,177
I like to...

712
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:39,378
I like to swear, play music.

713
01:23:39,778 --> 01:23:42,278
I hate giving grades.

714
01:23:46,078 --> 01:23:48,178
Have a nice life.

715
01:23:51,378 --> 01:23:53,478
I'm here if you want to talk.

716
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:56,879
Even if I'm not...

717
01:23:58,479 --> 01:23:59,679
here.

718
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:06,279
Can I show you something?

719
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:09,283
It's really good.

720
01:25:29,484 --> 01:25:31,184
So, I raped you?

721
01:25:32,284 --> 01:25:34,124
I could have any girl in
this school, I wanted.

722
01:25:34,284 --> 01:25:35,284
Willingly.

723
01:25:35,684 --> 01:25:36,884
Why would I rape you?

724
01:25:37,184 --> 01:25:38,384
You're not even attractive.

725
01:25:39,984 --> 01:25:42,185
You really screwed things
up for me, you know that?

726
01:25:44,185 --> 01:25:46,394
Now you are going to go
to every single person

727
01:25:46,406 --> 01:25:48,485
in this school and tell
them that you lied.

728
01:25:48,885 --> 01:25:50,385
You are going to tell them!

729
01:25:52,485 --> 01:25:53,685
My eyes!

730
01:25:54,585 --> 01:25:55,685
Get off me!

731
01:26:01,486 --> 01:26:03,786
What's going on in there?
Open this door now!

732
01:26:11,886 --> 01:26:13,386
Come out, Melinda.

733
01:26:15,586 --> 01:26:16,786
It's Melinda Sordino.

734
01:26:21,887 --> 01:26:24,387
- Are you okay?
- What the hell is wrong with you?

735
01:26:24,887 --> 01:26:26,287
Answer me!

736
01:26:27,387 --> 01:26:28,987
Everybody knows what you did.

737
01:26:34,087 --> 01:26:35,688
Say something, asshole!

738
01:26:47,088 --> 01:26:49,088
Please, please.

739
01:26:49,488 --> 01:26:50,488
I can't see!

740
01:26:52,088 --> 01:26:53,989
Please move.
I can't see anything!

741
01:26:54,889 --> 01:26:56,889
I can't open my eyes!

742
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,190
What's going on down there?

743
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:25,590
What happened?

744
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:27,190
Melinda?

745
01:29:22,097 --> 01:29:23,597
Dad changed his flight.

746
01:29:24,297 --> 01:29:25,797
He's going to be
home in a few hours.

747
01:29:26,197 --> 01:29:27,197
Why?

748
01:29:27,897 --> 01:29:30,697
I mean, I'm fine. Really.

749
01:29:31,097 --> 01:29:32,097
I am.

750
01:29:38,398 --> 01:29:40,718
Well you don't have to talk
about it, if you don't want to.

751
01:29:41,998 --> 01:29:43,798
No.

752
01:29:44,698 --> 01:29:45,898
I want to tell you about it.

753
01:29:56,799 --> 01:30:00,199
Last year. I went to this party
at the end of the year...
