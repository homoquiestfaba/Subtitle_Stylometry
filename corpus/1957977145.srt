00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:38,206

[heavy breathing]

6
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:58,000
- Hey, come here.

7
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:00,103
I got you.

8
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:06,137
[sighing]

9
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:12,827
The same one?

10
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:20,724
You wanna talk about it?

11
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,758
[sighing]

12
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:33,689
- It just...

13
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:36,724
It felt so vivid.

14
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:42,379
Like I could feel it.

15
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,240
I was drowning.

16
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:50,137
And I think someone was
trying to help me this time.

17
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:51,793
- Really?

18
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:56,482
Who was it?

19
00:01:58,206 --> 00:01:59,448
- I don't know.

20
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,448
I couldn't see anything.

21
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:05,655
There was blood everywhere.

22
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,896
But I could feel him.

23
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:15,655
- Him?

24
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:19,517
[pattering rain]

25
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:24,896
- I don't know.

26
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,517
- Babe, we're gonna get
through this, all right?

27
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,379
- What if we don't?

28
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:34,931
- We don't have any choice.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,206
We gotta get through this.

30
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:53,172
- You're such an optimist.

31
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,206
- With a dash of love.

32
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,517
Of course.

33
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:57,931
Mm.

34
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:59,620
Let's get your meds.

35
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:03,000
- No, I made up my mind.

36
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,931
I'm not going to...

37
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:06,379
- Going to what?

38
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:07,413
Take them?

39
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:11,241
- Will you just hear me out?

40
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:12,931
Okay?

41
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:14,724
They...

42
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:19,620
They make me lethargic.

43
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:25,447
Like, sometimes I can't even
function or do simple things.

44
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,827
- And that's just because
you're stressed out, all right?

45
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:29,724
You're working a lot,
between the shop,

46
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:30,793
with Jada, with me.

47
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,293
And you can't be every
woman all the time, babe.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,655
- Bryce, I made up my mind.

49
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:48,482
- And that's it? No discussion?

50
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,620
No thought on how
this ended last time

51
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,448
with you going...

52
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:53,517
- Don't. Don't.

53
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:55,412
- [Bryce] No.

54
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,930
- Don't go there.

55
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,091
- No, we've already moved in
now and unpacked our shit.

56
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,930
The last tango
around you sneaking

57
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:04,034
and not taking your
medication resulted

58
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,826
in your agoraphobia
making you believe

59
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:07,586
you were trapped in your car.

60
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:08,793
You punched out the window.

61
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,551
That's how you got
the scar on your hand.

62
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:14,620
You ran for blocks on end,
Faith, until you collapsed.

63
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,793
Is that what you wanna
relive, day in and day out?

64
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:19,827
That's the experience we
wanna give our daughter?

65
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:38,689
Babe.

66
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm begging you, please.

67
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:49,482
Take the medication so we
can start our day in peace.

68
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:12,724
I love you and you know this.

69
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:16,413
This is what's best.

00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:21,344
[light rain]

71
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:31,724
Jada! It's time for
school, monster!

72
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:37,758
[light rain]

73
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,034

[ominous music]

75
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:28,000
- Can I join you?

76
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,068
[Faith sighing]

77
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:56,758
Good morning my loves.

78
00:06:57,896 --> 00:06:59,586
Good morning, princess.

79
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:00,723
Muah!

80
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,172
- Morning, daddy.

81
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:04,067
- Morning, darling.

82
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,586
[chuckling]

83
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:11,274
And I believe I already
gave you a good morning.

84
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:13,000
- Oh, is that so?

85
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,034
- Mm-hm.

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,136
- Good morning and welcome
to New Day World News.

87
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:22,862
Joining me this morning
is presidential candidate

88
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:26,275
and retired four-star
general, Michelle Dupree.

89
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,586
She is best known...

90
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,103
- Babe.
- Hm?

91
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,596
- For leading a successful
mission into Afghanistan

92
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,551
and the take down
of the OCI regime.

93
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,034
A terrorist organization...

94
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:34,862
- Babe, did you remember...

95
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:35,965
- Just give me a second.

96
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:37,182
- [Reporter] By
overthrowing and killing

97
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,757
then President
Abdur-Raheem Zalmai.

98
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:42,757
Welcome to New Day,
General Dupree,

99
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:44,862
and congratulations on
your recent retirement

100
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,550
and of course, your
bid for the presidency.

101
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:48,793
- Thank you for having me.

102
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:51,620
That was quite an introduction.

103
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,102
You know, Lydia, one
of the things that I

104
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:55,931
am most proud of was
being able to assist

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,136
the new democratically elected
president of Afghanistan

106
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:01,033
with taking power.

107
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:02,896
It's a great addition
to my life's work

108
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,241
to see the Afghani people
receive the liberation

109
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,586
and leadership they
so rightly deserve.

110
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,655
- I was watching that.

111
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,931
- Exactly.

112
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:15,620
Meanwhile, your husband
and our daughter

113
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,175
have been trying to
get your attention.

114
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:21,137
Did you remember to make
arrangements for Jada?

115
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,137
You know she has a half
day at school today.

116
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,619
- Oh my god, Bryce, I forgot.

117
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,827
Can you please call in?

118
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:30,586
- No, we talked about this.

119
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,862
I told you, I have
patients all day today.

120
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,758
Which is why you
agreed this morning

121
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:36,517
that you would figure it out.

122
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,861
- I know, I meant to.

123
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:42,172
And I just got distracted.

124
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,689
You know that general on TV?

125
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,896
She looks, like,
really familiar to me.

126
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:52,068
- That's because
she's always on TV.

127
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:54,965
And you're a news
hound and that's that.

128
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:58,206
- Right.

129
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:01,827
So a half a day, huh, Jada?

130
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:04,723
Look, mommy has to
work late, okay?

131
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:07,275
Because there's inventory
coming into the store

132
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,068
and I gotta close.

133
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:11,000
Karena asked for
the evening off.

134
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:11,827
- Karena?

135
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,103
- Mm-hm.

136
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,241
- Who's that?

137
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:15,241
- Yeah, she's my new employee.

138
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:16,586
She's so good.

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,620
- What happened to Melissa?

140
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:21,862
- Ugh, she was terrible.

141
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:24,965
Had no customer
service experience.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,689
I mean, she just felt
like she was too good

143
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:28,689
to touch people's feet.

144
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:29,803
So I was like, listen girl,

145
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:31,182
go be a rocket
scientist or something.

146
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,827
Since you wanna act
like you're just

147
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:34,826
too good to do anything.

148
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:38,310
- I thought we agreed to
select new employees together.

149
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,171
- We did.

150
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,689
But I needed someone right away.

151
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:43,896
Karena it is.

152
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:48,586
It's not a big deal.

153
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:53,413
Look, how about I text Miss Amy

154
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:54,965
about picking you up for us?

155
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,931
- Miss Amy to the rescue!

156
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,241
And I'll get to play
with her puppies.

157
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:01,655
- Mm-hm.

158
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:04,862
Done.

159
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:06,068
- Jada gets what she wants.

160
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,724
All the time.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,964
- Eat all your carrots today.

162
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:13,965
Promise?

163
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:16,344
Good.

164
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,379
- That's my baby.

165
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:25,000
[snapping photos]

166
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:33,241
- Whew.

167
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:35,896
[engine starting]

168
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,413
[typing]

169
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:06,240
- Yeah, I need these.
I'm coming back for you.

170
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,241
Faith.

171
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:10,068
Guess who has a date?

172
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:14,275
Okay, I'm just gonna tell you.

173
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:15,448
You're taking too long.

174
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:16,482
My grandma.

175
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:18,448
- What?

176
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:19,896
- You heard me.

177
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:21,724
Granny said she
met a man online.

178
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:24,896
She liked him and they
went on a few dates.

179
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:27,516
So she gonna live her best life.

180
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:31,931
So, she can't babysit
my son tomorrow.

181
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:38,379
- Okay, so Mr. Steal-Your-Grandmother
is in full effect?

182
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:40,344
- Pretty much, yeah.

183
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:42,413
- All right, well, that's okay

184
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:43,895
because I have a
sitter for Jada tonight

185
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,068
and I did plan on closing.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,965
And I'll just figure some
things out for tomorrow.

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,137
- Okay, oof!

188
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:51,689
I'm getting out of here.

189
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:53,206
Thank you, Faith, girl.

190
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:54,379
- Mm-hm!

191
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,310
- [Karena] Best boss ever.

192
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:56,344
- Mm-hm!

193
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,000
- Oh shit. Um, and
can you clock me out?

194
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:03,413
Okay.

195
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:04,793
[giggling]

196
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:06,068
Oh, I'm so sorry.

197
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,343
I did not even see you.

198
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:09,067
- It's fine.

199
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:11,895
I was actually just going
to ask for directions.

200
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:15,758
My phone died and this
was my navigation.

201
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,102
- Happens to me all the time.

202
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,379
Look, all you do is
exit the parking lot,

203
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,379
make a left, and you'll
see the signs, okay?

204
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:24,310
- Thank you.

205
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,310
- You're welcome, bye.

206
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:35,068
[ominous music]

207
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,343
- I'll just get right to it.

208
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:48,413
Dupree can't be trusted.

209
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:51,931
- You're just figuring that out?

210
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:56,793
Listen, I know she was
your father's right hand.

211
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,206
He prided himself on maintaining

212
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,275
these powerful connections
and he worked hard

213
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:04,103
to construct this
impressive empire

214
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:06,103
of Afghan heroin
but that Dupree...

215
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:08,241
- Yeah, but since his
death, Dupree's changed.

216
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:09,275
- Yeah.

217
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:11,448
- She's quieter.

218
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,379
Gained a lot more power
in a short amount of time.

219
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,931
- Mm.

220
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:19,344
- It's part of the
reason I relocated.

221
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:21,517
You know, the main office
from New York to LA.

222
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:24,586
Dupree's here.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,965
And I've got a feeling
she's setting something up

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,379
to take us out, undercut us.

225
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:34,964
You don't think she's
running for president

226
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,525
for the betterment
of the people do you?

227
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,137
[crowds chanting]

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,827
- Oh!

229
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:57,413
- Bravo, General, Bravo.

230
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,448
- Mr. Secretary.

231
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:04,355
- You told me every
one of those soldiers

232
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,448
in that unit was dead.

233
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:10,344
Thomas Richardson, suicide,
shot himself in the head.

234
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,378
Carol Davinson, alcohol
poisoning, drank herself to death.

235
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:18,137
Marilyn Roman, electrocuted
in a freak accident.

236
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:21,034
And Imani Avant drowned.

237
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:23,965
Allegedly.

238
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:34,137
- This is impossible.

239
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:38,965
Uh.

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
- Now fix it.

241
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:47,000
[crowds cheering]

242
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:07,379
[phone ringing]

243
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,275
[sighing]

244
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,931
- I need a moment.

245
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,206
- You got it, boss.

246
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,620
- Dominique.

247
00:15:47,482 --> 00:15:49,000
I need to see you.

248
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:22,137
Come here, baby.

249
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:24,379
- You called for me?

250
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:25,551
- Mm, oh, I did.

251
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,551
- I'm here.

252
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:32,205
- I missed you.

253
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,482
- Missed you, too.

254
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,413
[kissing]

255
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:51,275
- So I just got a call.

256
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:53,448
- Okay.

257
00:16:57,413 --> 00:16:59,379
Ah.

258
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:00,068
- And it contradicts every
fucking thing you told me

259
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,655
about Imani's death, bitch.

260
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:04,551
Is she alive?

261
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,827
- I promise.

262
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:08,310
I swear she's dead.

263
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:10,448
I swear.

264
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,448
You asked me to protect
the family and I did.

265
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:24,344
At all costs.

266
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:28,310
Imani betrayed all
of us, remember?

267
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,275
Remember? Remember that?

268
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,620
She had to pay.

269
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:37,517
This has to be a mistake.

270
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:50,620
- For your sake, I
hope it is, bitch.

271
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:52,586
Now get the fuck off me!

272
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:57,379
Get your shit and get out.

273
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:17,689
[phone ringing]

274
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:22,896
- Hello.

275
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:26,241
- Scarlet never lost her letter.

276
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,379
- [Khalil] Really?

277
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:28,448
- Absolutely.

278
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,482
- So, no wet bird?

279
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:35,758
- I have no fucking idea.

280
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:38,517
But I need you to go look.

281
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:40,758
- Where?

282
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,241
- I'll text you the rest.

[footsteps]

285
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:34,827
- Don't move.

286
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,275
- Wait, wait.

287
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:36,827
Wait, you can have
whatever you want.

288
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:38,241
- Get down!

289
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:39,034
- You can have
whatever you want!

290
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:40,115
I promise you, I don't, ah!

291
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:41,931
- Stay down!

292
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,896
I told you not to move.

293
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,448

301
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,793
- Is that crystal clear?

302
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:05,941
- [Woman] Near the front door.

303
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:06,827
Near the front door.

304
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:09,172
[gunshot]

305
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,620
- Stay right there.

[patrons murmuring]

317
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,516
- I should have both
of your fucking heads

318
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:08,620
right here, right now.

319
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:17,034
- You look like you
could use a meal.

320
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,689
You want some?

321
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:20,010
- Your father gave
you one fucking job.

322
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,758
One.

323
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:23,517
To be a good son.

324
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,689
But you couldn't
even handle that.

325
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:31,000
I mean my god, Raymond
handed you everything.

326
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:34,827
Money, his multi-million dollar

327
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:36,758
liquor distribution business,

328
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:39,000
his connections, Afghanistan.

329
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,068
Me.

330
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:47,586
But no matter how much he
loved you and took care of you,

331
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,620
and even though you
were his junior,

332
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:53,551
there's still one thing
he couldn't teach you.

333
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:55,965
Loyalty.

334
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,689
[scoffs]

335
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:08,517
Your sister was not only
a better soldier than you,

336
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:12,172
she was more of a man
than you'll ever be.

337
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:17,827
So maybe she should
have been left alive.

338
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:22,965
She is dead, right?

339
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:31,654
Well, you know what they say.

340
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:34,620
You want something done
right, do it yourself.

341

[Supreme chuckling]

342
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:38,000
- Well, I guess she's dead then.

343
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:56,551
- You can play this game.

344
00:23:57,931 --> 00:23:59,827
But you and I both know
who loses in the end.

345
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:03,517
You'll go down.

346
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,172
And so will your
family's entire legacy.

347
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:10,172
- Hm.

348
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:12,172
You know, my father always said,

349
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:15,724
"Those on the
proximity to power"

350
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:18,931
"are sometimes deluded into
thinking they wield it."

351
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:24,586
"But in fact, it's the
man standing behind you"

352
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,896
"that decides if you take
that next step or not."

[patrons murmuring]

354
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,965
- Are those his final words?

355
00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:45,827
You were the last one to see
your father alive, right?

356
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:54,862
Strange how he died
so suddenly like that.

357
00:24:57,068 --> 00:24:58,068
With only you there.

358
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:03,965
[patrons murmuring]

359
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:17,068
- Ha, ha.

360
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,896
Next time have some class and
order the steak medium rare.

361
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,793
And don't fuck up my fundraiser!

[radio chatter]

366
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,000
Looks like a robbery gone wrong.

367
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:18,896
- Gone wrong is right.

368
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:21,724
This is professional.

369
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:24,379
- A gang hit?

370
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:27,427
- From the looks of
this, more than that.

371
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:29,862
All these bodies are armed.

372
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:35,000
All I know is that
whatever it is,

373
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,758
it's ruining my weekend plans.

374
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:41,275
Any witnesses?

375
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:47,413
- Just one, sir.

376
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:52,137
[radio chatter]

377
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:07,103
[phone ringing]

378
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:26,827
- Sir.

379
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,344
I've been here for hours.

380
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:31,103
An officer still has not
come and taken my report.

381
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:32,734
Now I know I don't
have to wait this long

382
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:34,205
to make a report
for my wife missing.

383
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:36,482
- Well, is she missing
voluntarily or involuntarily?

384
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:38,758
I mean, I see husbands everyday.

385
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:39,999
And don't even get me
started on the wives

386
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
looking for their husbands.

387
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:43,034
- My wife is missing!

388
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:45,793
Okay, she could be in danger.

389
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:47,172
She doesn't have her medication.

390
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:48,862
Anything could have happened.

391
00:27:48,896 --> 00:27:51,275
She owns a shoe store, she
shut down, did not come home.

392
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,448
- Which shoe store, sir?

393
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:54,034
- The Gleaming Slipper.

394
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:56,000
On the strip mall
right off the freeway.

395
00:27:58,034 --> 00:27:59,034
- Wait right here.

396
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:01,344
Hey.

397
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:05,275
Call Hoffman.

398
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,044
I think this might have something
to do with those murders.

399
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:08,068
- Murders?

400
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,482
[sighing]

401
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:18,793
- Mr. Dames.

402
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:19,793
Mr. Avant is in a
meeting right now.

403
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:20,827
Please, have a seat.

404
00:28:23,517 --> 00:28:25,964
I said, he's in a meeting.

405
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,068
You can't go in there, stop!

406
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:31,206
Mr. Avant, I
explained to Mr. Dames

407
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:34,172
that you were in a
meeting and he insisted.

408
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:35,758
- It's fine, Nola.

409
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:36,827
- Are you sure?

410
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:38,241
Because I can call security.

411
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:39,792
- I am security.

412
00:28:39,793 --> 00:28:40,793
Good day, Nola.

413
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,344
- I promise you,
Nola, it's fine.

414
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:52,034
Good day, Mr. Dames.

415
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:54,379
Take a seat.

416
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:58,482
- What type of fucking
mission are you sending me on?

417
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:00,413
Are you playing with
me or something?

418
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:01,482
- What?

419
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:03,379
I've been waiting
on word from you

420
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:04,573
since last night and nothing.

421
00:29:05,448 --> 00:29:06,965
So you tell me.

422
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:08,241
What mission you been on?

423
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:10,172
- Anytime you've given
me a job, I do it.

424
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:13,941
I've never given you any
reason to check up on me,

425
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:15,034
or clean up after me.

426
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:17,068
And I never needed back up.

427
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:19,241
- That's why I hired you.

428
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:22,274
- Yeah, I go to carry out
the job you hired me to do.

429
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:24,586
And you send a god damn
A-team to the scene before me?

430
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:27,103
- What?

431
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:32,896
What the fuck is
he talking about?

432
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:34,172
- Unless it was you?

433
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,137
- Ha, ha!

434
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:38,034
You're out of your mind.

435
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,137
Supreme, get your boy, man.

436
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:44,965
- See, maybe you
nervous, scared,

437
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:47,034
that I'm getting too close.

438
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:52,172
Close enough to take your
place and push you out the way.

439
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:55,550
So you send me into an ambush.

440
00:29:55,551 --> 00:29:56,551
- Two things, boy.

441
00:29:58,068 --> 00:30:01,000
One, you could never
take my fucking place.

442
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:03,862
And I don't send mother
fuckers to kill, they send me.

443
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:05,320
So calm your ass
down and leave me out

444
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,413
of whatever bullshit
you really got going on.

445
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:12,481
- Fellas, this is real cute.

446
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:13,964
I hate to break this up.

447
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:16,896
But somebody better tell
me what's going on now.

448
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:17,482
Talk!

449
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:18,482
Where's she at?

450
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:19,517
- She got away.

451
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:23,275
- Fuck.

452
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:24,464
- And it definitely was her.

453
00:30:25,482 --> 00:30:26,482
- So what now?

454
00:30:27,448 --> 00:30:28,931
- What you mean, what now?

455
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:33,068
I'll find her, I'll
execute her, period.

456
00:30:36,172 --> 00:30:38,034
- Yeah, that's
exactly what we'll do.

457
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:41,931
But first we're gonna
let her come to us.

458
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,827
If there's one thing
I know about Dorothy,

459
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:46,806
that bitch will always
find her way home.

460
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:55,379
[heavy breathing]

461
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:12,931
- It's only me and you, Imani.

462
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:19,482
[grunting]

463
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:39,620
[Faith groaning]

464
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:53,137
[grunting]

465
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:01,551
- Ah!

466
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:06,378
[snapping]

467
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:09,206
[heavy breathing]

468
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:13,241
Oh shit.

469
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:19,344
[footsteps]

470
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,724
- Mr. Newford.

471
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:30,793
I'm detective Hoffman.

472
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,344
We'd like to show
you some footage.

473
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:35,620
- Footage of what?

474
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,344
- An incident that
occurred last night.

475
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,068
Maybe it'll shine some light

476
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,206
on where your wife is.

477
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,241
[grunting]

478
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,310
Is that your wife?

479
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:10,620
- That's not the wife I know.

480
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:20,206
[knocking]

481
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,068
- Can I help you?

482
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:35,620
- Who are you and why
are you in my house?

483
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:36,655
- Excuse me?

484
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:40,379
- Where's Bryce and Jada?

485
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:42,206
- Ma'am, ma'am.

486
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:43,758
You probably got
the wrong address.

487
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:45,516
- Are you fucking crazy?

488
00:33:45,517 --> 00:33:46,724
- Ma'am are you okay?

489
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,217
- I live here, where
the fuck is my family?

490
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:49,137
- Ma'am, hey, hey, hey.

491
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:50,137
Are you all right?

492
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:51,137
- Honey, is everything okay?

493
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:52,206
I heard yelling.

494
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:53,551
- No, baby, it's all right.

495
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:54,551
I'm gonna handle this.

496
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:55,596
- And she's in my fucking robe.

497
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,620
What the fuck is...
- Hey!

498
00:33:58,172 --> 00:33:59,723
- Where the fuck is my family?

499
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:01,136
- Ah!

500
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:02,137
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

501
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:03,206
- I'm on with the police.

502
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,724
- Call them.

503
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:06,355
This is my fucking house,
they'll figure this shit out.

504
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:08,137
- Hurry, please, she's
attacking us now.

505
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,310
[grunting]

506
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:21,413
[shattering glass]

507
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:24,655
[grunting]

508
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:39,620
[heavy breathing]

509
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:19,793
[phone ringing]

510
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:29,723
- Bryce.

511
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:32,895
- Daddy, daddy! Where's Mommy?

512
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:34,585
- Hey, baby.

513
00:35:34,586 --> 00:35:36,758
Uh, Mommy's gonna
be home soon, okay?

514
00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:38,620
I promise that.

515
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:40,448
But guess what?

516
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:41,724
- What?

517
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:43,448
- So you know, you
love the lake house.

518
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:45,826
- Yes.

519
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:47,481
- Amy's gonna take
you to the lake house

520
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:50,241
and Mommy and I will
join you soon, all right?

521
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,724
- Yay, the lake!

522
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,931
- [Amy] We're gonna
have so much fun.

523
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,481
Let's go pack, okay?

524
00:35:55,482 --> 00:35:56,482
- [Jada] Okay!

525
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:23,482
[electronic beeping]

526
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:46,586
[typing]

527
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:15,689
- What the fuck?

528
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:20,793
[pen clicking]

529
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:37,517
- You should not
be on this phone.

530
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:52,448
[sighing]

531
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:18,034
- Senator.

532
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:23,827
- I'm not pleased.

533
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:28,793
Matter of fact, that's
an understatement.

534
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:32,931
I'm vexed.

535
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm quite vexed.

536
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:43,448
I need to understand how
a veteran CIA officer

537
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:45,034
allows any of this to happen.

538
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:50,034
Please, fill me in.

539
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:54,448
Because the last come to
Jesus moment that we had,

540
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:57,517
you told me you were weening
her off the medication

541
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:58,792
and slowly bringing her around.

542
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:00,586
- Yes, I was bringing
her around but...

543
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:01,655
- Shh.

544
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:04,964
I was raised to believe
that anything before

545
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:06,896
that "but" is bullshit.

546
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:10,010
So why don't you
do us both a favor

547
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:13,172
and skip to the part
where somehow, once again,

548
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:16,172
you led me into a mess that
I have to clean up for you

549
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:17,793
and your assigned bride.

550
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:19,044
- If you'll let me
explain, Senator.

551
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:22,448
- You see, that's
my issue, Alexander.

552
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:23,689
You're always explaining.

553
00:39:25,137 --> 00:39:28,034
First, you explained
that in order for Avant

554
00:39:28,103 --> 00:39:30,482
to feel that she was
in a normal family,

555
00:39:30,517 --> 00:39:32,482
she needed a child.

556
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:34,137
So we arranged for
you to adopt one.

557
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:39,689
Then you explained that she
was bored being a housewife

558
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:41,758
so we put things
in place for her

559
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:44,586
to open a fucking business.

560
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,206
All under the guise that you
would be bringing her around

561
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:51,862
just in time for me to use
the information that I need.

562
00:39:51,896 --> 00:39:53,758
And yet all I've
gotten out of it

563
00:39:53,793 --> 00:39:55,896
is Dupree's poll numbers rising

564
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:58,172
and her climbing
directly up my ass

565
00:39:58,241 --> 00:39:59,895
in the presidential race.

566
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,137
- My wife, I mean...

567
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:03,551
- No, you're right.

568
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,448
You were correct. Your wife.

569
00:40:07,793 --> 00:40:09,586
Because clearly,
you've fallen in love.

570
00:40:10,862 --> 00:40:13,655
- With all due respect, Senator,

571
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:15,965
let's be real here for a moment.

572
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,068
You knew Avant and I
had a thing going on

573
00:40:18,137 --> 00:40:19,930
before any of this.

574
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:21,931
Which is why you and
the head of your company

575
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,896
elected that I'd be on
top of this assignment.

576
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:26,999
And the fact that she's
been shot and has amnesia,

577
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that's real.

578
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:31,000
We've just been prolonging it

579
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:33,689
so that we can wait it out
until the election year.

580
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:35,827
And that was your call.

581
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:37,896
- It was. Why?

582
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:41,758
Because if she stepped
into total recall

583
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:43,965
she would confront Dupree

584
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,102
and Dupree would
try to kill her.

585
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:47,792
Again.

586
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,827
And probably get
away with everything.

587
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:50,793
- [Bryce] And that
wouldn't have been good

588
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:52,067
for you running for president.

589
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:53,551
- Exactly.

590
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:55,724
- But I've done
everything so far

591
00:40:55,793 --> 00:40:56,964
that you've asked me to do.

592
00:40:56,965 --> 00:40:58,758
- Everything except
keeping bandits

593
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:01,103
from kidnapping your
asset outside a store.

594
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:02,724
Other than that,
you're doing great.

595
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,068
Now, this election's gonna
be here before you know it.

596
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:12,172
And you shoulda brought
her around by now, Doctor.

597
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:16,517
Especially if you expect
me to nominate you

598
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:18,689
as the head of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

599
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:21,620
Unless that's changed?

600
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:22,827
- Nothing's changed, sir.

601
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,793
At the same time, we
both know the process

602
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:29,827
of removing this medication
can cause severe hallucinations

603
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,793
and even be deadly.

604
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:33,724
Which is why the
weening takes time.

605
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:37,205
- You know what takes time?

606
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:38,896
You dragging this
out takes time.

607
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:42,033
You should have let her
just have some seizures

608
00:41:42,034 --> 00:41:44,068
or whatever the fuck it
is and get on with it.

609
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:48,758
Yet here we are with soldier
gone wild on the loose.

610
00:41:48,793 --> 00:41:50,241
Two dead hit men
in the parking lot

611
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,103
and god only knows
who sent them.

612
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:55,068
And police evidence that
your wife killed them.

613
00:41:56,793 --> 00:41:58,758
Evidence that we now
have to make disappear.

614
00:41:58,793 --> 00:41:59,551
- I've handled that.

615
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,172
- Oh yeah.

616
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:04,067
Yeah, let's not forget about
the police report you filed.

617
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:06,688
- Of course, I've gotta
play the concerned husband.

618
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:07,929
- Okay, let's cut the bullshit.

619
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,551
You're not fooling any
fucking body with that.

620
00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:14,241
You were concerned.

621
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:15,655
About your wife.

622
00:42:19,793 --> 00:42:20,793
Now.

623
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:27,136
You have 72 hours to get
her ass back in place

624
00:42:27,137 --> 00:42:29,793
and resume your assignment.

625
00:42:32,896 --> 00:42:35,000
Or I'm gonna eliminate
the whole operation.

626
00:42:37,379 --> 00:42:40,896
And I do mean the
whole operation.

627
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,827
- [Elevator] Going up.

628
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:02,068
[heavy breathing]

629
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,862
[footsteps]

630
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:22,275
- If I don't leave,
he's going to kill me.

631
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,620
And you too.

632
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:26,206
- What happened?

633
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:30,137
- Listen, I have to
tell you something.

634
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:31,172
- Anything.

635
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:35,896
- Supreme was apart of
the original hit on Imani.

636
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:38,931
He got the orders from
the General but...

637
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,413
- But what?

638
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:48,689
- I did it.

639
00:43:54,206 --> 00:43:55,758
I was desperate for money,

640
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:57,103
for my mother's medical expenses

641
00:43:57,137 --> 00:44:00,275
and... I just agreed.

642
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:04,655
And I swear I thought
Imani was dead.

643
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:07,896
- Why did they want her dead?

644
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:10,724
- Something about,
she knew too much

645
00:44:10,758 --> 00:44:12,724
and that she was gonna
be bringing everyone down

646
00:44:12,758 --> 00:44:14,034
with the information she had.

647
00:44:15,413 --> 00:44:18,482
Something went down
in Afghanistan.

648
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:21,758
And the General returned
on operation wipe out.

649
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,895
The entire troops
were knocked off.

650
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:24,724
- You?

651
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:26,413
- Hell no!

652
00:44:26,448 --> 00:44:28,896
One body of blood on my hands
was more than enough for me.

653
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,274
- What's General Dupree's
real ties to Supreme?

654
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:38,344
- She was his father's
overseas connect, then his.

655
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,793
Now he and Jonathan are
going a different direction

656
00:44:40,827 --> 00:44:42,172
with another connect.

657
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:43,344
- Who?

658
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:44,792
- I don't know.

659
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:45,689
- I need you to find that out.

660
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,724
- Why?

661
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:51,827
We need to get out
of here like we said.

662
00:44:53,206 --> 00:44:56,000
I have access to
Supreme's accounts

663
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,862
and I've transferred more
than enough money into mine.

664
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,068
He won't miss it.

665
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:06,965
I've packed my bags and as
soon as I leave here, I'm gone.

666
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,310
And I want you to come with me.

667
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:15,034
But if you decide
that you wanna stay

668
00:45:15,068 --> 00:45:17,826
and remain loyal to
him, I promise you,

669
00:45:17,827 --> 00:45:19,068
he's gonna take you down too.

670
00:45:20,482 --> 00:45:22,413
Especially since he sent
you to bring her back

671
00:45:22,448 --> 00:45:23,516
and you haven't.

672
00:45:23,517 --> 00:45:24,862
- Shh, shh, shh.

673
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:27,068
Shh.

674
00:45:27,551 --> 00:45:29,137
Let me worry about that.

675
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:43,068
[sighing]

676
00:46:05,413 --> 00:46:08,241
[Faith groaning]

677
00:46:18,965 --> 00:46:21,206
- Officer, I'm gonna need
you to uncuff this patient.

678
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:23,010
- I have orders to keep her
restrained at all times.

679
00:46:23,034 --> 00:46:24,517
- Orders and this
patient's health

680
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:26,309
are not of the same importance.

681
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,448
Okay, she needs a
CT scan of her head.

682
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:32,413
Anyhow, when I
return I'd appreciate

683
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:34,206
my patient being
out of these cuffs.

684
00:47:07,517 --> 00:47:08,931
- Faith Newford's room.

685
00:47:08,965 --> 00:47:09,965
- Uh, 450.

686
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:13,137
- Okay.

687
00:47:17,724 --> 00:47:22,000
All right, anyone in the room,
get them out, immediately.

688
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:23,137
Standby until I get there.

689
00:47:24,413 --> 00:47:25,413
I need to handle this.

690
00:47:26,586 --> 00:47:29,000
If she escapes,
bring her back to me.

691
00:47:30,068 --> 00:47:31,068
Alive.

692
00:47:46,275 --> 00:47:47,555
- Don't do anything
stupid, okay?

693
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,068
[grunting]

694
00:47:53,586 --> 00:47:55,241
- Oh, fuck!

695
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,310
- What the fuck is
going on here, Newford?

696
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,586
You can't just run up
in here and bark orders.

697
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,206
Your wife is needed for
questioning and you know why.

698
00:48:07,413 --> 00:48:08,413
- Ah, god.

699
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:15,344
- Now call off your fucking dogs

700
00:48:15,379 --> 00:48:17,206
and get your ass out
of my investigation.

701
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:18,275
Or this won't end well.

702
00:48:20,103 --> 00:48:22,482
[phone dialing]

703
00:48:24,206 --> 00:48:26,000
- Hey, Cap.

704
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:29,551
I have a detective...
Hoffman here.

705
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,315
He doesn't seem to understand
his position, Captain.

706
00:48:35,689 --> 00:48:36,689
Thank you, sir.

707
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,068
He's clear for sure.

708
00:48:41,137 --> 00:48:42,724
[phone ringing]

709
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:45,379
- [Hoffman] Shit head.

710
00:48:45,413 --> 00:48:46,413
Captain.

711
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,482
Yeah, but...

712
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:50,551
Okay.

713
00:48:53,586 --> 00:48:54,586
Fuck!

714
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,310
- Ah!

715
00:49:05,413 --> 00:49:06,413
Oh.

716
00:49:08,689 --> 00:49:09,689
Hey!

717
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:12,344
- Faith.

718
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:16,620
Wait.

719
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:18,034
- God damn it.

720
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,655
[rattling]

721
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:51,620
[grunting]

722
00:50:11,724 --> 00:50:14,448
[alarm blaring]

723
00:50:27,793 --> 00:50:31,000
[workers murmuring]

724
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:44,551
- Bryce?

725
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:46,517
- Target secure.

726
00:50:48,275 --> 00:50:49,275
Faith, baby.

727
00:50:51,137 --> 00:50:52,137
I know you're scared.

728
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:56,103
But I need you to trust me.

729
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:00,309
I need you to come with me.

730
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,586
I can explain!

731
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,275
[alarm blaring]

732
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:49,517
- And then she gonna say,

733
00:51:49,586 --> 00:51:51,482
you must be taking
diet baby aspirin.

734
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:52,596
Because them blue
pills you takin,

735
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,275
ain't doing shit for you.

736
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,274
I mean, she clean cussed me out.

737
00:51:56,275 --> 00:51:58,344
Said she's looking to
settle down with a stallion.

738
00:51:59,344 --> 00:52:00,517
Ha!

739
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:03,655
I told her, bitch,
you are 72 years old.

740
00:52:03,724 --> 00:52:05,620
The only stallion you'll
be settling down with

741
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:06,724
is Jesus Christ.

742
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:10,379
[chuckling]

743
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:16,517
Yeah, sure did!

744
00:52:17,758 --> 00:52:19,931
[unzipping]

745
00:52:22,793 --> 00:52:24,344
[gasping]

746
00:52:24,379 --> 00:52:25,172
Yeah, all right, Momma.

747
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:26,793
I love you too.

748
00:52:26,827 --> 00:52:27,827
All right.

749
00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:35,344
[Faith groaning]

750
00:52:35,379 --> 00:52:36,517
- Alrighty, here we go!

751
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,655
All right.

752
00:52:45,965 --> 00:52:47,413
Alrighty, Ralph.

753
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:51,103
Are you ready for
your last ride?

754
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:55,413
All right, here we go.

755
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,448
Vroom, vroom, vroom!

756
00:52:59,793 --> 00:53:00,793
Ah!

757
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:06,931
Watch out, going
through the door!

758
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:07,965
Ah.

759
00:53:09,758 --> 00:53:10,758
Ah.

760
00:53:15,965 --> 00:53:16,965
Here we go.

761
00:53:18,379 --> 00:53:19,379
Look out.

762
00:53:46,758 --> 00:53:48,965
[rattling]

763
00:53:54,862 --> 00:53:55,862
Here we go.

764
00:53:56,758 --> 00:53:57,758
Ah.

765
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,000
- Hold it.

766
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:05,689
- Oh, shit.

767
00:54:05,724 --> 00:54:06,724
They got me.

768
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:12,896
Listen, listen.

769
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:13,931
I can explain.

770
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:19,723
Now, I've been meaning to
file my taxes since '96.

771
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:21,620
But after what I seen
y'all do to Ron Isley...

772
00:54:21,655 --> 00:54:23,758
- Sir, please step
away from the vehicle.

773
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,448
- No, I, I can't do that, now.

774
00:54:26,482 --> 00:54:29,827
You see, I know exactly
what this is about.

775
00:54:29,862 --> 00:54:32,586
- Sir, I need you to move
away from the vehicle.

776
00:54:34,758 --> 00:54:35,758
Now.

777
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:37,931
Thank you.

778
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,724
- Shit.

779
00:54:40,758 --> 00:54:43,481
For 32 years I done
bagged and zipped

780
00:54:43,482 --> 00:54:45,448
and bagged and zipped
and bagged some more.

781
00:54:46,793 --> 00:54:48,665
And nobody ever come
behind me to check my work.

782
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:50,068
It's that new
supervisor of mine.

783
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:51,482
I know she sent you.

784
00:54:52,517 --> 00:54:53,724
I'm filing a grievance.

785
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:54,758
Today.

786
00:54:55,586 --> 00:54:57,378
And poor Ralph.

787
00:54:57,379 --> 00:54:59,861
All he did was drop
dead on Wednesday.

788
00:54:59,862 --> 00:55:01,447
And he can't even rest in peace

789
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:02,848
without the po-po
running up on him.

790
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:09,827
Shoot.

791
00:55:30,103 --> 00:55:30,965
- Sorry about the
inconvenience, sir.

792
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Have a good day.

793
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:35,034
Sir, sorry.

794
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:37,862
- What... you?

795
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,586
It's a damn shame.

796
00:55:44,896 --> 00:55:45,896
God damn shame.

797
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:48,965
God damn shit.

798
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:51,481
I tell ya, Ralph.

799
00:55:51,482 --> 00:55:53,931
A black man can't catch a break.

800
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,758
[knocking]

801
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:55,758
- Get out.

802
00:55:58,172 --> 00:56:00,724
- I knew that bag was a
little too bulky for Ralph.

803
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:04,000
Look, don't shoot now.

804
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:07,103
Because you won't get no
argument and no ID from me.

805
00:56:07,137 --> 00:56:08,517
- I don't wanna hurt you.

806
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:09,723
- That makes two of us.

807
00:56:09,724 --> 00:56:11,793
- I'll be needing this hearse.

808
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,931
- Lady, you can
have this hearse.

809
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,068
You can have the keys,
Ralph's old stinkin' ass.

810
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:18,448
All of it.

811
00:56:18,517 --> 00:56:20,448
You ain't getting no
argument from me, lady.

812
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:21,689
I ain't seen nothing.

813
00:56:33,586 --> 00:56:34,586
Ha.

814
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,655
- Step away slow.

815
00:56:36,896 --> 00:56:37,896
- Okay.

816
00:56:38,793 --> 00:56:40,793
All right, take it easy.

817
00:56:45,103 --> 00:56:47,758
[engine starting]

818
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,034
[knocking]

819
00:57:30,172 --> 00:57:31,275
- Faith!

820
00:57:31,344 --> 00:57:33,448
Oh my god, are you okay?

821
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,689
- I don't know what to do.

822
00:57:39,862 --> 00:57:41,931
I don't know what to do.

823
00:57:41,965 --> 00:57:43,068
I'm trying everything.

824
00:57:43,103 --> 00:57:44,240
I'm...

825
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:45,551
I'm lost.

826
00:57:47,103 --> 00:57:49,113
My world is falling apart
and I don't know who I am.

827
00:57:49,137 --> 00:57:50,103
I don't know what to do.

828
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:51,517
- Is it Bryce?

829
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:52,586
Is it Jada?

830
00:57:54,689 --> 00:57:57,103
Why are you in a
hospital gown and a robe?

831
00:57:57,137 --> 00:57:59,240
- I don't know.

832
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:01,137
I don't know how I got here.

833
00:58:01,206 --> 00:58:02,793
I don't...

834
00:58:02,862 --> 00:58:03,896
- It's okay, it's okay.

835
00:58:03,931 --> 00:58:05,068
Shh. It's okay.

836
00:58:05,103 --> 00:58:06,826
Let's get you
changed and showered

837
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:08,343
and something to eat, okay?

838
00:58:08,344 --> 00:58:09,344
Then we'll talk.

839
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:31,034
[sighing]

840
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:32,827
Tell me what's going on.

841
00:58:35,827 --> 00:58:36,862
Were you in the hospital?

842
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:39,896
And why do you have a gun?

843
00:58:42,793 --> 00:58:44,313
- Girl, I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

844
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:49,206
My entire life as I
know it has been erased.

845
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:55,241
I go home and there's
random people in my home.

846
00:58:56,827 --> 00:58:57,931
And my baby is gone.

847
00:59:00,172 --> 00:59:02,999
And then I'm at the
hospital and Bryce shows up

848
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,931
and he's a completely
different person.

849
00:59:07,068 --> 00:59:08,241
He pulled a gun on me.

850
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:09,862
- What?

851
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:10,965
What do you mean?

852
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:13,034
- I've been kidnapped.

853
00:59:13,068 --> 00:59:14,103
- What? By who?

854
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:16,275
- I've been shot at.

855
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,000
- With bullets?

856
00:59:18,068 --> 00:59:20,000
- I've been called Imani Avant.

857
00:59:22,241 --> 00:59:24,620
- Who?

858
00:59:24,655 --> 00:59:25,930
Who is that?

859
00:59:25,931 --> 00:59:27,965
- I don't know.

860
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,793
I don't know, but
whoever she is,

861
00:59:30,827 --> 00:59:32,137
somebody wants the bitch dead.

862
00:59:38,137 --> 00:59:39,137
- Um...

863
00:59:40,724 --> 00:59:43,655
What floor of the hospital
did you say you were on again?

864
00:59:44,862 --> 00:59:45,862
The locked one?

865
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:48,931
- I'm not crazy.

866
00:59:50,206 --> 00:59:51,896
- I... I didn't say that.

867
00:59:53,275 --> 00:59:54,275
It's just...

868
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,931
What did you say your
husband did again?

869
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:01,310
What kind of friends
do y'all have?

870
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:02,896
- He's a doctor.

871
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:06,930
We don't have friends.

872
01:00:06,931 --> 01:00:07,965
We have a nanny.

873
01:00:09,379 --> 01:00:10,379
And there's you.

874
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:18,862
Look.

875
01:00:24,896 --> 01:00:26,724
A couple of years ago

876
01:00:26,758 --> 01:00:28,278
I was in a really
serious car accident.

877
01:00:30,758 --> 01:00:32,206
I got amnesia from it.

878
01:00:35,034 --> 01:00:36,413
Bryce has been really good about

879
01:00:36,448 --> 01:00:38,137
filling me in on the
details of my life.

880
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:44,724
- Girl.

881
01:00:45,931 --> 01:00:48,930
Look, I'm not a cop or nothing

882
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:52,930
but I do watch
"Investigation ID."

883
01:00:52,931 --> 01:00:54,620
And this sounds like
one of those stories

884
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:57,068
called A Whole Damn Problem.

885
01:00:57,103 --> 01:01:01,241
And on the last episode, this
man stole his wife's identity

886
01:01:01,275 --> 01:01:02,413
and gave it to the mistress.

887
01:01:02,448 --> 01:01:03,448
- Karena.
- Babe.

888
01:01:03,482 --> 01:01:04,482
- Karena.

889
01:01:05,448 --> 01:01:06,448
This is not that.

890
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:09,965
[sighing]

891
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:13,448
- Then why would somebody
call you by another name?

892
01:01:17,448 --> 01:01:18,448
- I don't know.

893
01:01:23,862 --> 01:01:26,724
- Well, let's Google
that name and see.

894
01:01:32,827 --> 01:01:33,827
Imani Avant.

895
01:01:39,379 --> 01:01:43,068
War hero and
heiress to the Avant

896
01:01:43,103 --> 01:01:46,240
Liquor Distribution
Company dynasty.

897
01:01:46,241 --> 01:01:49,724
Dead after
accidentally drowning.

898
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,310
Faith.

899
01:01:56,103 --> 01:01:57,103
Is this you?

900
01:02:04,793 --> 01:02:06,448
- Will you click on that?

901
01:02:11,586 --> 01:02:14,827
- Captain Imani Avant has
been laid to rest today.

902
01:02:14,896 --> 01:02:16,240
The war hero and daughter

903
01:02:16,241 --> 01:02:20,034
of well revered business
man Raymond Avant Senior

904
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,274
drown tragically after returning

905
01:02:22,275 --> 01:02:25,000
from a successful
tour in Afghanistan.

906
01:02:33,137 --> 01:02:37,034
Captain Avant is survived
by her brother Raymond Jr.

907
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,895
As you can see, the
well loved army soldier

908
01:02:43,896 --> 01:02:47,378
was so highly regarded
that four-star general

909
01:02:47,379 --> 01:02:52,068
Michelle Dupree and Secretary
of Defense, Arthur Bridges

910
01:02:53,586 --> 01:02:55,103
were in attendance
at her service.

911
01:03:00,896 --> 01:03:02,137
- Okay, click on her.

912
01:03:09,448 --> 01:03:10,448
Zoom in.

913
01:03:17,379 --> 01:03:18,379
- Yeah.

914
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:22,206
I'm so glad you came
up here with me.

915
01:03:24,275 --> 01:03:26,931
I so needed a moment
away from the city.

916
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,585
And plus I've been wanting
to get here for awhile.

917
01:03:30,586 --> 01:03:32,344
- Yeah.

918
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:34,103
Honestly, this
place is beautiful.

919
01:03:37,137 --> 01:03:38,577
You know my brother
really loves you.

920
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:43,137
I haven't seen him this
happy since our mother died.

921
01:03:44,586 --> 01:03:46,344
- I love him too.

922
01:03:46,379 --> 01:03:49,034
And I would do anything for him.

923
01:03:51,448 --> 01:03:54,172
[patrons murmuring]

924
01:03:57,448 --> 01:03:58,448
- Ha!

925
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:03,965
Sorry.

926
01:04:04,482 --> 01:04:05,931
[chuckling]

927
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,482
This wine is really strong.

928
01:04:07,517 --> 01:04:09,551
[chuckling]

929
01:04:09,586 --> 01:04:11,172
The wine is strong.

930
01:04:14,379 --> 01:04:17,103
Yeah, I thought the wine
overseas was strong, ha!

931
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:19,620
This...

932
01:04:21,448 --> 01:04:24,206
[patrons murmuring]

933
01:04:25,965 --> 01:04:26,965
- Cheers.

934
01:04:38,482 --> 01:04:39,482
- Wait.

935
01:04:48,206 --> 01:04:49,206
- Um...

936
01:04:51,034 --> 01:04:52,655
Are you sure you're okay?

937
01:04:54,689 --> 01:04:56,241
- What's the date
on that article?

938
01:05:00,034 --> 01:05:02,965
- Uh, the funeral
was only a year ago.

939
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,965
- Bryce said we've
been married 10 years.

940
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
That can't be me.

941
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:16,310
Pull up that picture again.

942
01:05:35,482 --> 01:05:36,482
Fuck.

943
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:42,448
- Yeah.

944
01:05:42,482 --> 01:05:45,275
And that guy, Raymond Jr.

945
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:48,000
Better known as Supreme.

946
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:50,965
The one that they're
saying is your...

947
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,344
I mean, her brother.

948
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,586
He owns the Avant
Suite downtown.

949
01:05:58,172 --> 01:06:00,517
It's one of those high
end exclusive clubs

950
01:06:00,551 --> 01:06:02,000
for the rich and famous.

951
01:06:04,379 --> 01:06:08,413
Politicians, A-listers,
that's who goes there.

952
01:06:11,827 --> 01:06:13,482
You know, I've heard

953
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:16,448
a lot of things about
that Avant family.

954
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:21,206
Like, powerful.

955
01:06:23,551 --> 01:06:25,310
And dangerous things.

956
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,205
- Dangerous like what?

957
01:06:30,206 --> 01:06:32,344
[explosion]

958
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,205
Karena, run!

959
01:06:35,206 --> 01:06:36,103
- Girl.

960
01:06:36,137 --> 01:06:37,068
- Girl, run!

961
01:06:37,103 --> 01:06:38,379
- Okay, all right.

962
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:41,551
Ah!

963
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,275
[grunting]

964
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:52,275
- God damn it!

965
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,620
[grunting]

966
01:07:05,758 --> 01:07:07,827
[gunshots]

967
01:07:15,275 --> 01:07:17,827
[heavy breathing]

968
01:07:34,896 --> 01:07:35,896
- Hey!

969
01:07:38,275 --> 01:07:40,413
[gunshots]

970
01:07:40,448 --> 01:07:42,310
[shattering glass]

971
01:07:42,379 --> 01:07:43,379
- Ah!

972
01:07:45,241 --> 01:07:46,241
- Fuck!

973
01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:03,758
- Faith!

974
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:04,793
Get in!

975
01:08:05,793 --> 01:08:06,724
Get in, girl.

976
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:07,758
Come on.

977
01:08:10,758 --> 01:08:12,838
Girl, close the door, close
the door, close the door.

978
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:17,172
People are really
coming after you, faith.

979
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:18,241
Why?

980
01:08:19,931 --> 01:08:20,862
Has this got something
to do with your family?

981
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:21,862
- I don't know, Karena.

982
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,274
- Some mafia type shit?

983
01:08:23,275 --> 01:08:24,517
- I don't know!

984
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:27,310
But I need to find out.

985
01:08:27,344 --> 01:08:29,413
- Right, because you like some

986
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:31,379
wingnut terminator type bitch.

987
01:08:31,413 --> 01:08:32,930
I mean, you fucked
a handful of men up

988
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:34,344
with one karate kick.

989
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,482
How you do that?

990
01:08:40,931 --> 01:08:41,931
- Good question.

991
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:47,448
I need to talk to Bryce.

992
01:08:47,517 --> 01:08:49,586
- Yeah, call him.

993
01:08:50,655 --> 01:08:51,655
Right now.

994
01:08:57,965 --> 01:08:58,965
- [Bryce] Hello?

995
01:09:01,034 --> 01:09:02,310
Hey, baby, is that you?

996
01:09:04,827 --> 01:09:05,862
Where are you?

997
01:09:05,896 --> 01:09:07,379
Come home, please.

998
01:09:08,275 --> 01:09:10,206
You need your medication.

999
01:09:12,344 --> 01:09:13,344
- Bryce.

1000
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,551
- [Bryce] Faith.

1001
01:09:19,586 --> 01:09:20,896
- We need to talk.

1002
01:09:30,896 --> 01:09:31,896
- What'd he say?

1003
01:09:33,965 --> 01:09:34,965
- He knows something.

1004
01:09:35,965 --> 01:09:36,965
Take me home.

1005
01:09:49,034 --> 01:09:51,310
[sighing]

1006
01:09:51,379 --> 01:09:52,688
- I don't know, Faith.

1007
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:53,689
Are you sure?

1008
01:09:55,379 --> 01:09:57,586
- Whatever is going on, I
can't just leave Jada here.

1009
01:09:59,586 --> 01:10:01,655
We'll figure some shit out.

1010
01:10:01,724 --> 01:10:04,206
- Well, then I'm
coming with you.

1011
01:10:04,275 --> 01:10:07,275
- What I need you to
do is just get your son

1012
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:09,241
and your grandmother
and go somewhere safe.

1013
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:11,931
- I will.

1014
01:10:20,344 --> 01:10:22,517
[sighing]

1015
01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:33,241
[scoffs]

1016
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:41,275
- Let me know if you can
get anymore information.

1017
01:10:53,379 --> 01:10:55,206
- What the fuck is going on?

1018
01:10:55,275 --> 01:10:56,517
- Faith.

1019
01:10:56,551 --> 01:10:58,654
- Why did you have a
gun at the hospital?

1020
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:00,620
- A gun? I was there
to bring you home.

1021
01:11:03,482 --> 01:11:04,482
- Don't lie to me.

1022
01:11:06,758 --> 01:11:08,655
- Faith, babe.

1023
01:11:10,758 --> 01:11:11,758
Give me the gun.

1024
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:15,034
All of this is happening

1025
01:11:15,103 --> 01:11:17,793
because you're off
your medications.

1026
01:11:17,827 --> 01:11:20,689
I told you this would happen.

1027
01:11:21,655 --> 01:11:23,689
All right, the panic attacks.

1028
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,793
The violence.

1029
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:29,551
Feeling trapped.

1030
01:11:36,551 --> 01:11:39,517
I love you, so much.

1031
01:11:40,793 --> 01:11:41,793
Okay?

1032
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,586
And I promise we're gonna
get past this but...

1033
01:11:48,896 --> 01:11:49,896
You've gotta trust me.

1034
01:12:04,724 --> 01:12:07,620
I'm so sorry this
is happening to you.

1035
01:12:11,413 --> 01:12:14,068
[Faith whimpering]

1036
01:12:20,931 --> 01:12:22,103
Come on, let's go to bed.

1037
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,137
Come on.

1038
01:12:26,827 --> 01:12:27,827
Come on.

1039
01:12:45,551 --> 01:12:47,413
Come on babe, let's go.

1040
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,137
[footsteps]

1041
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,827
[screaming]

1042
01:13:32,862 --> 01:13:33,895
- I'm disappointed
in you, bitch.

1043
01:13:33,896 --> 01:13:35,793
I'm so disappointed in you.

1044
01:13:36,862 --> 01:13:37,965
Uh-huh.

1045
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,482
[muffled screaming]

1046
01:13:39,517 --> 01:13:40,517
Stealing?

1047
01:13:42,068 --> 01:13:44,758
Sending a woman to do a man's
job, I can deal with that.

1048
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:46,516
That's my fault.

1049
01:13:46,517 --> 01:13:48,037
But ain't no bitch
gonna steal from me.

1050
01:13:53,517 --> 01:13:55,689
[grunting]

1051
01:13:57,206 --> 01:13:59,896
[ominous music]

1052
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:06,620
- Okay.

1053
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
[retching]

1054
01:14:12,655 --> 01:14:13,862
- I'm sorry.

1055
01:14:13,896 --> 01:14:14,965
I've never been like this.

1056
01:14:16,137 --> 01:14:17,137
- You only live once.

1057
01:14:18,068 --> 01:14:18,862
[silenced gunshot]

1058
01:14:18,896 --> 01:14:20,862
[gasping]

1059
01:14:30,103 --> 01:14:31,103
- Same one?

1060
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:35,103
- No.

1061
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:39,724
This time someone shot me.

1062
01:14:41,068 --> 01:14:45,896
- Really?

1063
01:14:46,827 --> 01:14:51,551
You wanna talk about it?

1064
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:53,034
- No.

1065
01:14:55,551 --> 01:14:57,965
I just want to get
my day started.

1066
01:15:01,103 --> 01:15:03,102
- Babe, listen.

1067
01:15:03,103 --> 01:15:07,344
I know you don't like
taking them pills, but...

1068
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:08,517
We'll get through this.

1069
01:15:14,172 --> 01:15:15,172
- I know.

1070
01:15:19,586 --> 01:15:20,931
- Now who's the optimist?

1071
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:24,793
- With a dash of love.

1072
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:29,896
Jada, monster!

1073
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:31,965
It's time to get up.

1074
01:15:42,965 --> 01:15:45,620
[running water]

1075
01:15:53,793 --> 01:15:54,793
May I join you?

1076
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:00,000
[running water]

1077
01:16:08,103 --> 01:16:09,931
I'll take that as a yes.

1078
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:16,241
- Mm.

1079
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:29,620
She's back at home now.

1080
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:31,103
Everything's back to normal.

1081
01:16:31,137 --> 01:16:33,723
I've got eyes on her
everywhere this time.

1082
01:16:33,724 --> 01:16:36,793
In a few days I'll lower the
dosage on her medication.

1083
01:16:36,827 --> 01:16:38,896
We should be able to
find the documents then.

1084
01:16:39,758 --> 01:16:40,758
- Well done.

1085
01:16:43,827 --> 01:16:44,827
Now.

1086
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,103
Who sent those men?

1087
01:16:49,448 --> 01:16:50,448
- General Dupree.

1088
01:16:52,448 --> 01:16:54,862
But Dupree's men weren't
the only ones to show up.

1089
01:16:56,793 --> 01:16:57,793
The brother's men.

1090
01:16:59,275 --> 01:17:01,171
- Hm.

1091
01:17:01,172 --> 01:17:02,931
- Raymond Supreme Avant Jr.

1092
01:17:04,896 --> 01:17:06,068
Daddy's little prince.

1093
01:17:07,896 --> 01:17:10,137
Handed life on a
palladium spoon.

1094
01:17:10,172 --> 01:17:12,275
My sources tell me it was Dupree

1095
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:14,413
who ordered the brother
to execute his sister.

1096
01:17:16,482 --> 01:17:18,827
And that's how she got the
bullet in the back of the head.

1097
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:22,310
- Wow.

1098
01:17:25,862 --> 01:17:28,344
It appears as though it's
time to return the favor.

1099
01:17:28,379 --> 01:17:29,379
- Absolutely.

1100
01:17:37,103 --> 01:17:39,275
- And yet somehow you're
still sitting here with me.

1101
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:49,895
- Good morning, gentlemen.

1102
01:17:49,896 --> 01:17:51,862
I appreciate you stopping in.

1103
01:17:51,896 --> 01:17:53,941
I'm still a little bit upset
about my sweet Dominique

1104
01:17:53,965 --> 01:17:55,931
so forgive me if I'm
not myself, all right?

1105
01:17:57,448 --> 01:17:59,378
- Well, I still
can't believe it.

1106
01:17:59,379 --> 01:18:00,379
- Me either.

1107
01:18:02,379 --> 01:18:04,413
I know you loved her,
she was good to you.

1108
01:18:04,448 --> 01:18:06,241
- Too good.

1109
01:18:06,275 --> 01:18:08,931
- I don't want you to
worry about it, okay?

1110
01:18:08,965 --> 01:18:10,344
I've already put some men on it

1111
01:18:10,413 --> 01:18:12,000
and we'll figure
out who did this.

1112
01:18:12,068 --> 01:18:13,724
- Yeah, well my
money's on Dupree.

1113
01:18:18,586 --> 01:18:20,275
That's okay.

1114
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:21,551
No worries.

1115
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,137
Karma is the master
mother fucker, trust.

1116
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,137
Ha.

1117
01:18:26,172 --> 01:18:27,862
Speaking of Dupree.

1118
01:18:27,896 --> 01:18:30,206
Those men who snatched Imani
before you got there, Khalil.

1119
01:18:30,241 --> 01:18:31,344
- Yeah?

1120
01:18:31,379 --> 01:18:32,827
- Those were the General's men.

1121
01:18:34,862 --> 01:18:37,103
- Are you sure General
Dupree did that?

1122
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:39,137
- Yeah, that bitch.

1123
01:18:40,517 --> 01:18:41,907
She was actually
the one who gave me

1124
01:18:41,931 --> 01:18:44,551
the intel I gave
you, but obviously

1125
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,724
she ain't trust me enough
to take care of it.

1126
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:50,999
- She could have got me killed.

1127
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
- Right.

1128
01:18:53,241 --> 01:18:54,527
That's all right, I got
something for her ass.

1129
01:18:54,551 --> 01:18:55,551
- And what is that?

1130
01:18:57,172 --> 01:18:59,241
- A mark in the cemetery
and a slow walk to hell.

1131
01:19:00,344 --> 01:19:01,827
I just gotta get her there.

1132
01:19:03,103 --> 01:19:05,034
- Well, she does
have the fundraiser

1133
01:19:05,068 --> 01:19:06,103
at the club coming up.

1134
01:19:11,034 --> 01:19:12,034
- Indeed.

1135
01:19:18,965 --> 01:19:21,413
[Faith sighing]

1136
01:20:15,448 --> 01:20:17,275
[typing]

1137
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:52,344
[shuffling papers]

1138
01:20:52,413 --> 01:20:53,413
- Oh shit.

1139
01:21:24,137 --> 01:21:25,137
Faith?

1140
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:31,137
[footsteps]

1141
01:22:03,448 --> 01:22:05,931
Well, isn't this a
pleasant surprise.

1142
01:22:07,448 --> 01:22:08,448
- Is it?

1143
01:22:13,275 --> 01:22:15,379
Did you forget it's
our anniversary?

1144
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,310
Mm.

1145
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:22,586
Now who's forgetting?

1146
01:22:27,241 --> 01:22:29,000
- Does it matter now?

1147
01:22:59,689 --> 01:23:01,241
- Slow down, baby.

1148
01:23:02,379 --> 01:23:03,758
Let me do the rest.

1149
01:23:20,241 --> 01:23:22,379
[kissing]

1150
01:23:37,724 --> 01:23:38,517
- Faith.

1151
01:23:38,551 --> 01:23:39,551
- Shh.

1152
01:23:42,586 --> 01:23:47,344
Don't say another fucking word.

1153
01:23:50,724 --> 01:23:52,241
Xavier Alexander.

1154
01:23:56,137 --> 01:23:57,297
I wanna know what's going on.

1155
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:00,620
Don't lie to me.

1156
01:24:02,206 --> 01:24:03,482
Don't try to gaslight me.

1157
01:24:05,137 --> 01:24:06,137
Because I love you.

1158
01:24:08,172 --> 01:24:09,344
But I will fucking kill you.

1159
01:24:12,827 --> 01:24:14,379
I want to know
every single detail.

1160
01:24:18,689 --> 01:24:19,689
- Okay.

1161
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:21,689
Listen.

1162
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,034
When you got home
from Afghanistan,

1163
01:24:26,241 --> 01:24:27,585
you went to the head

1164
01:24:27,586 --> 01:24:29,206
of the Senate Foreign
Affairs Committee.

1165
01:24:33,172 --> 01:24:36,241
With the promise of returning
with documents and proof.

1166
01:24:38,517 --> 01:24:42,172
- Well, keep up the
good work, Captain.

1167
01:24:42,206 --> 01:24:43,482
- Thank you, sir.

1168
01:24:43,517 --> 01:24:44,517
- Absolutely.

1169
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:47,862
- [Bryce] Suddenly soldiers

1170
01:24:47,896 --> 01:24:50,206
in your unit were
showing up dead.

1171
01:24:51,827 --> 01:24:53,344
I was put on the case.

1172
01:24:55,931 --> 01:24:58,448
Powell wanted proof of what
went on in Afghanistan.

1173
01:24:59,793 --> 01:25:01,413
I had been assigned
to follow you.

1174
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:04,620
That night at the
lake, you were there

1175
01:25:04,655 --> 01:25:06,172
with your brother's girlfriend.

1176
01:25:07,655 --> 01:25:10,344
I had to fall back a few
places or blow my cover.

1177
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:12,827
And I lost you for a moment.

1178
01:25:14,586 --> 01:25:17,517
When I found you,
you were drowning.

1179
01:25:20,862 --> 01:25:22,654
I pulled you out.

1180
01:25:22,655 --> 01:25:24,517
I thought I had
lost you forever.

1181
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:28,896
Everything that happened after
that was to keep you alive.

1182
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:31,586
You actually had amnesia.

1183
01:25:32,965 --> 01:25:34,585
But when you started to heal

1184
01:25:34,586 --> 01:25:36,448
and your memories
were flooding back,

1185
01:25:36,482 --> 01:25:37,896
we were in a full operation.

1186
01:25:39,689 --> 01:25:41,619
And I was scared you
would go full metal jacket

1187
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:43,758
to bring down General
Dupree too soon.

1188
01:25:49,793 --> 01:25:51,379
So I had to create us a life.

1189
01:25:53,379 --> 01:25:54,482
One you would believe.

1190
01:25:56,586 --> 01:25:58,448
Suppress your memories
with medication

1191
01:25:58,517 --> 01:26:00,655
and keep you safe
until the right time.

1192
01:26:19,482 --> 01:26:20,586
- How do I look?

1193
01:26:22,275 --> 01:26:23,275
- You look great.

1194
01:26:28,275 --> 01:26:29,275
A lot better.

1195
01:26:55,344 --> 01:26:57,000
I mean, what did
you want me to do?

1196
01:26:57,034 --> 01:26:58,964
I couldn't just
let them kill you.

1197
01:26:58,965 --> 01:26:59,965
- You killed me.

1198
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:04,344
Because what the fuck
is a Faith Newford?

1199
01:27:04,413 --> 01:27:05,586
I am Imani Avant.

1200
01:27:07,896 --> 01:27:09,758
What the fuck is
that besides murder?

1201
01:27:13,551 --> 01:27:16,517
And then your dumb ass
couldn't even be creative.

1202
01:27:17,827 --> 01:27:19,724
You named me the
same god damn thing.

1203
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Did you not know that Faith
and Imani mean the same thing?

1204
01:27:26,034 --> 01:27:27,758
- Of course.

1205
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:28,827
It's symbolic.

1206
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:31,413
That's why I picked it.

1207
01:27:35,344 --> 01:27:36,344
Imani.

1208
01:27:39,517 --> 01:27:40,586
You are back now.

1209
01:27:43,482 --> 01:27:44,896
And you know what that means.

1210
01:28:09,758 --> 01:28:11,896
[footsteps]

1211
01:28:14,413 --> 01:28:15,585
- You make the call?

1212
01:28:15,586 --> 01:28:16,866
- Did exactly as you instructed.

1213
01:28:17,655 --> 01:28:18,965
As soon as she hits her mark,

1214
01:28:20,172 --> 01:28:21,172
it'll be in place.

1215
01:28:22,689 --> 01:28:25,379
- Taking out a
presidential candidate.

1216
01:28:25,413 --> 01:28:26,620
You're a bold mother fucker.

1217
01:28:28,137 --> 01:28:29,517
- I was raised that way.

1218
01:28:30,448 --> 01:28:33,447
[phone ringing]

1219
01:28:33,448 --> 01:28:34,448
- Excuse me, fellas.

1220
01:28:36,172 --> 01:28:38,827
[phone ringing]

1221
01:28:45,068 --> 01:28:46,103
- Got it.

1222
01:28:46,137 --> 01:28:47,793
Everything's a go.

1223
01:28:47,862 --> 01:28:49,689
- Catch her ass right there.

1224
01:28:58,517 --> 01:29:00,551
- Everything okay, Khalil?

1225
01:29:03,034 --> 01:29:04,034
- Mm-hm.

1226
01:29:16,172 --> 01:29:17,551
- You all right, Jabril?

1227
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:21,146
- Yes sir, I think
we're being followed.

1228
01:29:31,206 --> 01:29:32,206
Coming up on the left.

1229
01:29:41,586 --> 01:29:43,586
- Oh, I think we're okay.

1230
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,551
Think you're just being
a little paranoid.

1231
01:29:45,586 --> 01:29:46,758
- Yeah, I think we're clear.

1232
01:29:48,068 --> 01:29:49,620
- You may be right.

1233
01:29:50,862 --> 01:29:51,793
- Yeah, I'll tell
you what, though.

1234
01:29:51,862 --> 01:29:53,379
These poll numbers are going up.

1235
01:29:54,517 --> 01:29:56,068
I like to see that.

1236
01:29:56,103 --> 01:29:57,103
- [Jabril] Yes, sir.

1237
01:30:04,241 --> 01:30:06,620
- Okay, now what the
hell is this now?

1238
01:30:06,655 --> 01:30:07,930
- Just construction, sir.

1239
01:30:07,931 --> 01:30:09,827
We're just gonna
take this detour.

1240
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:11,689
It's probably gonna
make us late, though.

1241
01:30:13,827 --> 01:30:15,187
- Ah, it's probably
better, anyway.

1242
01:30:16,517 --> 01:30:18,689
Let her get there first.

1243
01:30:18,724 --> 01:30:20,447
I'm gonna steal some of her
thunder when I get there.

1244
01:30:20,448 --> 01:30:21,448
- Ha!

1245
01:30:26,551 --> 01:30:28,482
[revving engine]

1246

[screeching tires]

1247
01:30:29,517 --> 01:30:30,827
- Yo, what the fuck?

1248
01:30:30,896 --> 01:30:31,586
Jabril, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

1249
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:32,862
- Yo, somebody's following us!

1250
01:30:35,068 --> 01:30:36,068
- Well, go!

1251
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:37,034
Go, go, go!

1252
01:30:37,068 --> 01:30:38,148
- Just hang on, I got this.

1253
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:42,758
Oh shit.

1254
01:30:42,793 --> 01:30:44,895
- Who the fuck is this,
Jabril, who is this?

1255
01:30:44,896 --> 01:30:45,827
- I don't know!

1256
01:30:45,896 --> 01:30:47,079
- Shit, he's getting close, man.

1257
01:30:47,103 --> 01:30:48,205
Come on, come on.
You gotta step on it!

1258
01:30:48,206 --> 01:30:49,206
- Shit, here we go.

1259
01:30:54,862 --> 01:30:56,262
- Right. Right,
right, right, right!

1260

[screeching tires]

1261
01:30:58,965 --> 01:31:02,034
Go around.

1262
01:31:02,068 --> 01:31:04,103
Who the fuck is this?

1263
01:31:04,137 --> 01:31:06,827
[screeching tires]

1264
01:31:06,896 --> 01:31:09,275
Go in the tunnel. Go
in the tunnel, go!

1265
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:11,551
Tunnel, tunnel, tunnel!

1266
01:31:11,586 --> 01:31:12,344
- Ah.

1267
01:31:12,379 --> 01:31:13,689
Just hang on, I got this.

1268
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:20,724
- This is fucking Dupree.

1269
01:31:22,689 --> 01:31:24,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1270
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:26,000
[screeching tires]

1271
01:31:26,034 --> 01:31:27,896
What the fuck?

1272
01:31:27,931 --> 01:31:32,206
Go back, go back, go
back, go back, go back!

1273
01:31:32,241 --> 01:31:34,000
Ah!

1454
01:44:07,827 --> 01:44:08,586
Maybe you should...

1455
01:44:08,655 --> 01:44:09,793
- I shouldn't what?

1456
01:44:09,862 --> 01:44:11,516
I shouldn't say
anything to the General

1457
01:44:11,517 --> 01:44:13,717
about how she sent us on a
fucking suicide mission, huh?

1458
01:44:15,034 --> 01:44:16,034
Move, soldier.

1459
01:44:18,517 --> 01:44:20,689
[sighing]

1460
01:44:31,482 --> 01:44:32,448
- Mission accomplished?

1461
01:44:32,482 --> 01:44:34,034
- What mission, General Dupree?

1462
01:44:34,103 --> 01:44:35,586
The real one or the fake one?

1463
01:44:49,068 --> 01:44:51,344
That was a drone hit.

1464
01:44:51,379 --> 01:44:53,068
Not suicide bombers, not rebels.

1465
01:44:53,103 --> 01:44:54,516
- Be easy, soldier.

1466
01:44:54,517 --> 01:44:55,665
- I lost three men out there.

1467
01:44:55,689 --> 01:44:57,413
- Stand down,
soldier, last warning.

1468
01:44:57,448 --> 01:44:58,310
- That was a fucking ambush!

1469
01:44:58,379 --> 01:45:00,378
- Everything went as planned.

1470
01:45:00,379 --> 01:45:01,862
- Not the plan relayed to me.

1471
01:45:03,827 --> 01:45:07,862
We were supposed to save
President Zalmai, not kill him.

1472
01:45:07,896 --> 01:45:11,481
And then blame it on some
makeshift, OCI rebels

1473
01:45:11,482 --> 01:45:14,724
who were armed with American
weapons and ammunition

1474
01:45:14,758 --> 01:45:16,931
and then conveniently
named terrorists by you.

1475
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,379
- Now you're in violation.

1476
01:45:18,413 --> 01:45:19,688
I said, stand the fuck down!

1477
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:21,999
- Oh yeah, well tell
it to fucking Congress.

1478
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,586
Because I already
alerted the head

1479
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:25,079
of Foreign Affairs
Committee, Senator Powell,

1480
01:45:25,103 --> 01:45:26,965
that this mission
was faulty by design.

1481
01:45:39,827 --> 01:45:41,793
[dialing]

1482
01:45:43,586 --> 01:45:44,586
- We have a problem.

1483
01:45:46,931 --> 01:45:49,655
[Dupree chuckling]

1484
01:45:49,689 --> 01:45:51,724
You know, you always
were too self righteous

1485
01:45:51,793 --> 01:45:52,793
for your own good.

1486
01:45:54,172 --> 01:45:56,792
Nobody gives a fuck
about those people.

1487
01:45:56,793 --> 01:45:58,826
The world has painted
them as terrorists

1488
01:45:58,827 --> 01:46:01,724
and just maybe
that's what they are.

1489
01:46:03,655 --> 01:46:05,689
Do you think anyone
cared that we were

1490
01:46:05,724 --> 01:46:08,482
the ones who actually ordered
the hit on their president?

1491
01:46:09,758 --> 01:46:10,758
That would be a hell no.

1492
01:46:10,793 --> 01:46:11,931
And you know why?

1493
01:46:13,827 --> 01:46:15,482
Because the world
has relegated them

1494
01:46:15,517 --> 01:46:17,034
to being throw away people.

1495
01:46:18,172 --> 01:46:19,965
Not even worthy of the land

1496
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,379
and the rich resources
they sit upon.

1497
01:46:23,896 --> 01:46:25,826
Every time somebody
fills their gas tank

1498
01:46:25,827 --> 01:46:28,000
or heats their
house or buys oil,

1499
01:46:28,034 --> 01:46:29,448
do you think they give a damn

1500
01:46:29,482 --> 01:46:32,137
that we were the ones
who ran over villages

1501
01:46:32,172 --> 01:46:35,413
and started wars and created
faux rescue missions to get it?

1502
01:46:37,034 --> 01:46:38,689
Again, that would be a no.

1503
01:46:38,758 --> 01:46:42,586
And that is because those
people don't matter, Imani.

1504
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:44,240
And for the life of
me, I can't understand

1505
01:46:44,241 --> 01:46:45,551
why the fuck you think they do.

1506
01:46:45,586 --> 01:46:46,655
- They're people.

1507
01:46:48,655 --> 01:46:49,827
They deserve to live.

1508
01:46:50,965 --> 01:46:51,965
And live well.

1509
01:46:53,758 --> 01:46:55,137
Liberation and democracy.

1510
01:46:56,517 --> 01:46:57,689
That was your mantra.

1511
01:46:59,862 --> 01:47:00,862
Or...

1512
01:47:02,241 --> 01:47:04,275
Does that not matter
to you when it comes

1513
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:05,482
to black and brown babies?

1514
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:07,931
- Oh god, here we go.

1515
01:47:07,965 --> 01:47:09,172
The race card.

1516
01:47:09,241 --> 01:47:10,631
I don't make up the
rules, princess,

1517
01:47:10,655 --> 01:47:11,862
I just enforce them.

1518
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:15,274
And you.

1519
01:47:15,275 --> 01:47:17,586
You've gotta be the biggest
hypocrite of them all.

1520
01:47:19,310 --> 01:47:21,000
I know you don't think
the Avant's wealth

1521
01:47:21,034 --> 01:47:22,793
just came from your
daddy's good looks.

1522
01:47:26,655 --> 01:47:27,935
How many women
and children died?

1523
01:47:29,551 --> 01:47:30,871
How many rebels
were paid to guard

1524
01:47:30,896 --> 01:47:33,724
your daddy's coca and
poppy plantations, huh?

1525
01:47:35,344 --> 01:47:37,034
How many villages
pillaged so you could be

1526
01:47:37,068 --> 01:47:38,206
amongst the 1%?

1527
01:47:39,689 --> 01:47:42,033
Going to your fancy schools.

1528
01:47:42,034 --> 01:47:44,033
Living in your mansions.

1529
01:47:44,034 --> 01:47:45,758
- Don't try to blame
this on my father

1530
01:47:45,793 --> 01:47:48,206
because we both know you were
his partner in all of this.

1531
01:47:49,551 --> 01:47:50,551
- Yes!

1532
01:47:51,275 --> 01:47:53,482
Yes, I was!

1533
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:55,586
And you wanna know why?

1534
01:47:57,103 --> 01:47:59,000
Because we understood
each other.

1535
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:02,103
We understood the assignment.

1536
01:48:03,724 --> 01:48:07,310
But you, little miss ungrateful.

1537
01:48:07,379 --> 01:48:09,793
So determined to destroy
everything we built

1538
01:48:09,827 --> 01:48:11,171
and take your own family
down in the process.

1539
01:48:11,172 --> 01:48:12,172
And for what?

1540
01:48:13,137 --> 01:48:14,137
The good of man?

1541
01:48:15,965 --> 01:48:17,596
Oh please, that is such
a pile of bullshit.

1542
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,965
- You should rot in hell.

1543
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,793
- And you should watch
your fucking back.

1544
01:48:22,103 --> 01:48:23,931
Because your borrowed
time is ticking.

1545
01:48:26,241 --> 01:48:28,965
Now move, soldier.

1546
01:48:40,896 --> 01:48:43,000
[footsteps]

1547
01:48:53,137 --> 01:48:57,896
- [Officers] Freeze!

1548
01:48:58,724 --> 01:48:59,724
- Mother fucker.

1549
01:49:01,172 --> 01:49:03,896
[sirens wailing]

1550
01:49:10,344 --> 01:49:11,206
- I'm okay.

1551
01:49:11,206 --> 01:49:12,206
I promise.

1552
01:49:23,241 --> 01:49:24,241
- Commander.

1553
01:49:25,344 --> 01:49:26,931
- Sergeant Myles Brailey.

1554
01:49:30,758 --> 01:49:31,931
- Look at you.

1555
01:49:32,862 --> 01:49:34,655
Okay, this is different.

1556
01:49:34,689 --> 01:49:35,655
[chuckling]

1557
01:49:35,689 --> 01:49:36,793
- You like it?

1558
01:49:36,827 --> 01:49:38,172
- So is this your new uniform?

1559
01:49:38,206 --> 01:49:39,206
- I guess so.

1560
01:49:40,137 --> 01:49:41,586
Ha, good to see you.

1561
01:49:41,655 --> 01:49:42,655
- Good to see you, too.

1562
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:48,000
Looks like it's time to get
that tatted back on, hm?

1563
01:49:49,103 --> 01:49:50,103
- Sergeant Brailey.

1564
01:49:51,758 --> 01:49:54,862
Or should I say, Khalil Dames?

1565
01:49:56,206 --> 01:49:58,862
My brother, thank you.

1566
01:49:58,931 --> 01:50:00,724
We couldn't have got
this done without you.

1567
01:50:03,068 --> 01:50:04,068
And now that you're back,

1568
01:50:06,172 --> 01:50:08,344
we need to figure out
where these documents are.

1569
01:50:10,172 --> 01:50:14,586
- Well, it looks like you
don't have to search very far.

1570
01:50:15,965 --> 01:50:17,310
The documents are
in the pendant.

1571
01:50:22,172 --> 01:50:25,000
[laughing]

1572
01:50:25,034 --> 01:50:26,275
- The whole time?

1573
01:50:26,344 --> 01:50:27,862
- The whole time.

1574
01:50:27,896 --> 01:50:29,654
- The documents
are in the pendant.

1575
01:50:29,655 --> 01:50:31,964
- It's in the pendant.

1576
01:50:31,965 --> 01:50:33,724
- You know what we went through?

1577
01:50:33,758 --> 01:50:34,862
- We could have died.

1578
01:50:34,896 --> 01:50:36,896
[laughing]

1579
01:51:10,758 --> 01:51:12,827
- Dupree, Dupree, Dupree.

1580
01:51:16,965 --> 01:51:19,379
I usually don't
come to such events.

1581
01:51:19,448 --> 01:51:22,689
But for you, I decided
to make an exception.

1582
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:27,689
I had such high hopes for us.

1583
01:51:27,724 --> 01:51:29,379
You were so smart.

1584
01:51:29,413 --> 01:51:31,827
And you were definitely on
your way to being president.

1585
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,034
But you allowed
your own ambitions

1586
01:51:36,068 --> 01:51:38,034
to get ahead of what I
instructed you to do.

1587
01:51:39,241 --> 01:51:41,965
And now, you know
how this works.

1588
01:51:43,379 --> 01:51:47,172
Don't worry, I made all
the proper arrangements.

1589
01:51:47,241 --> 01:51:50,965
And this will be easy and quiet.

1590
01:51:54,931 --> 01:51:56,965
[clicking]

1591
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,034
[hissing gas]

1592
01:52:08,344 --> 01:52:09,758
Cyanide gas.

1593
01:52:11,413 --> 01:52:12,413
It'll be quick.

1594
01:52:14,551 --> 01:52:16,724
Painful, but quick.

1595
01:52:18,482 --> 01:52:21,965
You'll feel dizzy,
the room will spin.

1596
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,068
You'll begin to seize.

1597
01:52:24,448 --> 01:52:25,931
Your heart will race.

1598
01:52:25,965 --> 01:52:27,482
Your blood pressure will spike.

1599
01:52:29,551 --> 01:52:32,103
And then it'll all be over.

1600
01:52:33,965 --> 01:52:36,137
[coughing]

1601
01:52:43,241 --> 01:52:45,275
[wheezing]

1602
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:17,620
Clean this up.

1603
01:53:34,862 --> 01:53:37,137
- Officers Avant,
Brailey, Alexander.

1604
01:53:38,172 --> 01:53:39,172
Job well done.

1605
01:53:40,517 --> 01:53:42,827
This is what happens when
agencies work together.

1606
01:53:42,862 --> 01:53:44,896
The CIA and Army spec ops,

1607
01:53:44,931 --> 01:53:46,838
we're all brothers and
sisters when we're out there.

1608
01:53:46,862 --> 01:53:48,999
Congratulations.

1609
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,034
Let's not forget
your field team.

1610
01:53:51,068 --> 01:53:52,251
They worked fast and diligently

1611
01:53:52,275 --> 01:53:54,137
when things started to go south.

1612
01:53:54,206 --> 01:53:55,286
Thank you for your service.

1613
01:53:56,586 --> 01:53:58,044
By now you've all heard
that General Dupree

1614
01:53:58,068 --> 01:53:59,862
has committed suicide.

1615
01:53:59,931 --> 01:54:02,344
Not surprising, she took
the coward's way out.

1616
01:54:02,379 --> 01:54:04,481
And while she'll never
face a court of law

1617
01:54:04,482 --> 01:54:08,274
or jury of her peers, I've
received classified intel

1618
01:54:08,275 --> 01:54:09,931
that she orchestrated
the killing

1619
01:54:09,965 --> 01:54:13,000
of President Zalmai to extend
the war in Afghanistan.

1620
01:54:13,034 --> 01:54:14,034
- Why?

1621
01:54:15,206 --> 01:54:15,896
- She was involved
in a operation

1622
01:54:15,931 --> 01:54:17,413
that was allowing tons of heroin

1623
01:54:17,448 --> 01:54:20,205
into our country via
our nation's ports.

1624
01:54:20,206 --> 01:54:21,596
And she was colluding
with the rebels

1625
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:24,172
of South and West Africa
to build a drug empire.

1626
01:54:25,241 --> 01:54:27,068
When our new
president is elected,

1627
01:54:27,103 --> 01:54:28,389
I'll work with
that administration

1628
01:54:28,413 --> 01:54:30,620
to have the op declassified.

1629
01:54:30,655 --> 01:54:33,206
So Dupree will be disgraced
and go down in history

1630
01:54:33,275 --> 01:54:35,482
as a war criminal,
a drug dealer,

1631
01:54:35,517 --> 01:54:37,965
and a traitor to
the United States.

1632
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,447
And all of you
will be recognized

1633
01:54:39,448 --> 01:54:40,620
for the heroes that you are.

1634
01:54:42,034 --> 01:54:43,034
Carry on.

1635
01:54:58,379 --> 01:55:01,344
- What was that look about?

1636
01:55:01,379 --> 01:55:04,137
- How would Bridges
know about the pipeline?

1637
01:55:04,172 --> 01:55:05,172
- The pendant.

1638
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:10,670
- I haven't given
it to anyone yet.

1639
01:55:36,551 --> 01:55:37,758
- [Speaker] Confirming.

1640
01:55:37,793 --> 01:55:40,517
Delta-three-nine-nine
charlie-six.

1641
01:55:40,586 --> 01:55:42,172
- Confirmed.

1642
01:55:42,206 --> 01:55:43,486
- [Speaker] New
assignment ready.

1643
01:55:44,448 --> 01:55:45,448
- Go.

1644
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:51,137
[footsteps]

1645
01:56:03,068 --> 01:56:04,241
- Well, this is interesting.

1646
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:07,689
I never thought we'd
be here, you and me.

1647
01:56:10,275 --> 01:56:11,275
- [Powell] Neither did I.

1648
01:56:13,103 --> 01:56:14,275
- Did you hear about Dupree?

1649
01:56:15,482 --> 01:56:16,482
She didn't do so well.

1650
01:56:19,793 --> 01:56:21,000
- That's typical.

1651
01:56:25,172 --> 01:56:27,310
[sighing]

1652
01:56:29,172 --> 01:56:30,344
Doesn't surprise me, though.

1653
01:56:34,206 --> 01:56:35,344
She got ahead of herself.

1654
01:56:38,206 --> 01:56:41,206
- So tell me, how do you
plan on getting out of this?

1655
01:56:42,655 --> 01:56:44,620
[sighing]

1656
01:56:44,655 --> 01:56:49,241
- Let's just say, I
have a little faith.

1657
01:56:54,448 --> 01:56:55,448
- Well, she better hurry.

1658
01:57:03,137 --> 01:57:05,448
