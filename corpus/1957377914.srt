This place is gonna be
crawling with them.

352
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:34,144
Well, if there's that many,

353
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:37,147
they'll probably get us
wherever we are.

354
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,316
Look, the cellar.

355
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,751
There's just one door, right?

356
00:26:40,784 --> 00:26:42,119
Just one door.

357
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:44,121
That's all we have to protect.

358
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:45,322
Tom and I fixed it,
so it locks

359
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,157
and boards from the inside.

360
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,825
TOM: You got a point,
Mr. Cooper.

361
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,295
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

362
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:54,464
I mean, if they did get in,
there'd be no back exit.

363
00:26:54,498 --> 00:26:56,767
We'd be done for.

364
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,869
We can get out of here
if we have to.

365
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:01,305
And we got windows to see
what's going on outside.

366
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:04,508
But down there, with no windows,
if a rescue did come,

367
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,176
we wouldn't even know it.

368
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,111
HARRY: But the cellar
is the strongest place.

369
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:10,314
BEN: The cellar
is a death trap.

370
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:12,716
TOM: I don't know, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's right.

371
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:16,620
HARRY: Look, you two can do
whatever you like.

372
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:18,589
I'm going back down
to the cellar

373
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:21,825
and I'm not gonna unlock it
again no matter what happens.

374
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:23,894
- Now, wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.
- No, I'm not gonna wait!

375
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:25,796
I've made my decision,
now you make yours.

376
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,631
TOM: I said, wait a minute!

377
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:30,300
Let's think about this.

378
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:32,502
We can make it to the cellar
if we have to.

379
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:35,572
If we decide to stay down there,
we'll need things from up here.

380
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:38,241
Let's at least consider it.

381
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,244
If you box yourself
in the cellar

382
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:42,245
and those things
get in the house,

383
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,714
you've had it.

384
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,349
At least up here,
you have a fighting chance.

385
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,855
Looks like about eight
or ten of them now.

386
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:53,857
That's more than there were.

387
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,626
There's a lot out back, too.

Harry, what's happening?

394
00:28:33,597 --> 00:28:34,865

- We gotta fix these boards.
- Are you crazy?

401
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,841
Those things are gonna
be at every window

402
00:29:17,874 --> 00:29:19,309
and every door in this place.

403
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:20,911
We've gotta get down
into the cellar.

404
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:24,015
Go down in your damn cellar
and get out of here!

405
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,882
I... I'm taking the girl with me.

406
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,485
Keep your hands off of her
and everything else up here.

407
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:31,488
If I stay up here, I'm fighting
for everything up here,

408
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,390
the radio and the food
is part of that.

409
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:36,493
The man's insane.
He's insane.

410
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,962
We've gotta
have food down there.

411
00:29:37,995 --> 00:29:39,629
We've got a right.

412
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:40,998
- BEN: Is this your house?
- We've got a right!

413
00:29:41,032 --> 00:29:42,933
You're going down there
with him?

414
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,801
- Well, I...
- BEN: Yes or no?

415
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:46,336
Listen, I've got
a kid down there.

416
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,771
She can't possibly
take those things,

417
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:49,506
smashing through the windows?

418
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,475
If you're stupid enough
to go die in that trap,

419
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:52,977
that's your business.

420
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,746
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

421
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:58,849
It's tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

422
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,951
Now, get the hell down
in the cellar.

423
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:02,452
Go be boss down there.

424
00:30:02,486 --> 00:30:04,321
I'm boss up here.

425
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:05,856
Bastards!

426
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:08,325
You know, I won't open
this door again, I mean it.

427
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:09,893
Mr. Cooper, with your help...

428
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:12,029
Let him go.
His mind's made up.

429
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,931
TOM: Wait a minute!

430
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:18,802
Judy?

431
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:20,337
Come on up here, honey.

432
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,411
You're gonna let them
get her, too?

433
00:30:28,445 --> 00:30:30,947
It's all right, honey.
Go ahead.

434
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:48,398
Well, we're safe now.

435
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,400
It's boarded up tight.

436
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,735
What about Tom and Judy?

437
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,537
They wanna stay up there,
let 'em.

[metal clangs]

439
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:59,609
There are two other people
upstairs.

440
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:00,844
A man and a girl.

441
00:31:00,877 --> 00:31:02,779
We heard the screaming.

442
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:04,514
HARRY: Yeah.

443
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:07,551
I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

444
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:08,852
Of course not, Harry.

449
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:19,529

Let 'em stay upstairs.
Let 'em.

452
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:35,012
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

453
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:36,646
We'll see who's right.

454
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,515
Yeah, we'll see,
when they come begging me

455
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:40,417
- to let them in down here.
- That's important, isn't it?

456
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,818
- HARRY: What?
- To be right,

457
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:43,854
everybody else to be wrong.

458
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:45,822
HARRY: What do you mean by that?

459
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:52,997
Does anyone up there know
why we're being attacked?

460
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,099
Whatever it is,
it isn't just happening here.

461
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:56,666
It's some kind of mass murder.

462
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,869
It's going on everywhere.

463
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:00,403
The radio said to stay inside...

464
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:01,771
Radio?

465
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:03,140
HARRY: There's a radio upstairs.

466
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:04,774
I heard the news bulletin.

467
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:07,078
There's a radio upstairs
and you boarded us in

468
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:08,745
- down here?
- HARRY: I know what I'm doing.

469
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:10,814
- What did it say?
- HARRY: Nothing! Nothing.

470
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:13,550
They don't know anything yet.

471
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,685
People are supposed to look
for a safe place to hide.

472
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:18,189
Take the board off that door!

473
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:20,124
We are staying down here, Helen!

474
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:23,526
Harry, that radio
is at least some communication.

475
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,129
If the authorities know
what's happening,

476
00:32:25,162 --> 00:32:28,832
they'll send people or, or,
or tell us what to do.

477
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:32,802
How are we gonna know if we lock
ourselves in this dungeon?

isn't going to solve anything.

for a few minutes,

486
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,072
Harry and I can come up.

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,841

with them down there

00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:24,341
I know.

526
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:25,842
That's why I pulled in here,
but it's locked.

527
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,011
Why are space experts
being consulted

528
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:28,845
about an earthbound
emergency?

529
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,680
So far, all the betting
on the answer

530
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:33,017
to that question centers
on the recent explorer

531
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,884
satellite shot to Venus.

532
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:36,886
It's obvious. Our best move
is to try to get out of here.

533
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,356

- Look!

536
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:43,660
- MAN 1: Uh, yes.
- MAN 2: Yes, yes,

537
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:45,129
that was the subject
of the meeting.

00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:49,699

546

555
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,125
He said the rescue stations
have doctors

556
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:15,859
and medical supplies.

557
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:18,429
If we can get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

558
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:19,929
We have one
of the world's authorities

559

and technology.

560
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:24,135
BEN: Willard.
I saw a sign that said Willard.

561
00:36:24,168 --> 00:36:26,337
TOM: It's only about
17 miles from here.

562
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,837
You know this area.

563
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:29,772
Yeah, Judy and I
are both from here.

564
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:32,876
We were on our way to the lake
when we heard the reports.

565
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:36,313
And we knew this house was here
and then these people came

566
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:38,015
and we went into the basement.

567
00:36:38,048 --> 00:36:40,017
How could we possibly get away?

568
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,186
We've got three men, two women,
a sick child,

569
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,421
and another woman out
of her head.

570
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:46,357
And the place is surrounded
by those things.

571
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,192
Dr. Grimes is a special
consultant for NASA.

572
00:36:48,225 --> 00:36:50,227
Dr. Grimes,
your entire staff,

573
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:53,097
I know, has been working
very hard to find some solution

574
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,731
to these things
that are happening.

575
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:56,367
Do you have any answers
at this time?

576
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,202
We have some answers,

577
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:00,204
but let me stress
the importance of seeking

578
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:03,706
medical attention for anyone
who's been injured.

579
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,976

- It has been established...
- How bad has your kid been hurt?

582
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:14,018
Um, she...

583
00:37:16,187 --> 00:37:17,787
Tell Judy to come up here
so you can stay

584
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,390
with your kid, all right?

00:37:19,423 --> 00:37:21,225
DR. GRIMES: <i>Destructive action

586
00:37:21,258 --> 00:37:22,892
<i>to the Venus probe.</i>

587
00:37:22,926 --> 00:37:24,395
In the cold room
at the university,

588
00:37:24,428 --> 00:37:27,231
we had a cadaver,
a cadaver from which all

589
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:29,400
four limbs
had been amputated.

590
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:31,768
This morning,
it opened its eyes.

591
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:35,472
It was dead, but it opened
its eyes and tried to move.

592
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:39,909
They want you upstairs.

593
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,185
I'll come back down
as soon as I find out

594
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:49,886
what they want.

595
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:52,323
Thank you, Judy.

596
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,291
The bodies
should be disposed of at once,

597
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:55,758
preferably by cremation.

598
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:57,428
Well, how long after death then

599
00:37:57,461 --> 00:37:59,463
does the body become
reactivated?

600
00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:01,198
It's only a matter of minutes.

601
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:02,799
Minutes?

602
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:04,134
That doesn't leave much time
to make arrangements.

603
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:05,768
No, you're right.
It doesn't give them time

604
00:38:05,802 --> 00:38:07,770
to make funeral arrangements.

605
00:38:07,804 --> 00:38:09,906
The bodies must be carried
to the street and,

606
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:11,874
and, and
burned immediately.

607
00:38:11,908 --> 00:38:14,777
Soak them with gasoline
and burn them.

<i>It has been established that...</i>

609
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:19,083
Judy, I need you to find sheets
to tear into small strips, okay?

610
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:21,418
- Okay.
- We need some bottles or jars

611
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:23,120
to make Molotov cocktails.

612
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:24,821
Hey! There's a big can
of kerosene down there.

613
00:38:24,854 --> 00:38:26,090
JUDY: I'll see
what I can find.

614
00:38:26,123 --> 00:38:28,292
I'll look for bottles.

615
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:30,961
There's, uh, uh,
a big key ring down there.

616
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:32,396
The key to the gas pump may
be on it.

617
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:34,231
TOM: I'll check.

618
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:36,433
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

619
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:39,169
Meantime, some of us can go out
and try to get the gas,

620
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:40,971
and then we can come back
for the rest of the people.

621
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:42,939
That'll leave
a door open someplace.

622
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:45,376
BEN: Yeah, that's right.
This door.

623
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:47,077
It's closer to the truck.

624
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:49,046
We'll put some supplies
behind the cellar door.

625
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,382
While we're gone, the rest
of you can hole up in there.

626

and there's a key on here

that's labeled
for the gas pump out back.

that used to the truck.

HARRY: Ten minutes.

747
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,888
Oh.

748
00:48:57,921 --> 00:49:00,657
Only ten more minutes?

749
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,127
We don't have very long to wait.

750
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,495
We can leave

751
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:07,464
or we better leave soon.

752
00:49:07,497 --> 00:49:09,399
It's 10 minutes to 3:00.

753
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:14,205
You know anything
about this area at all?

754
00:49:14,238 --> 00:49:15,739
Is Willard the nearest town?

755
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:17,941
I don't know.

756
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:21,478
We were... [sighs]

757
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:25,849
just trying to get to a motel
before dark.

758
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:27,851
You said those things
turned over your car.

759
00:49:27,884 --> 00:49:29,753
You think we can get it back
on its wheels?

760
00:49:29,786 --> 00:49:31,688
- Where is it?
- Forget it.

761
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:33,490
It's at least a mile.

762
00:49:33,523 --> 00:49:34,824
Johnny has the keys.

763
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:36,760
You're gonna carry
that child a mile

764
00:49:36,793 --> 00:49:38,595
through that army of things
out there?

765
00:49:38,628 --> 00:49:40,197
I can carry the kid.

766
00:49:40,231 --> 00:49:42,133
What's wrong with her?
How did she get hurt?

767
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:44,035
One of those things grabbed her.

768
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:45,468
Bit her on the arm.

769
00:49:47,138 --> 00:49:49,073
- What's wrong?
- Who knows what diseases

770
00:49:49,106 --> 00:49:51,008
those things carry?

771
00:49:51,042 --> 00:49:53,144
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

772
00:49:53,177 --> 00:49:55,012
She can't walk.
She's too weak.

773
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,716
Well, one of us could try
to get to the car.

774
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:02,519
You're gonna turn it over
by yourself?

775
00:50:02,552 --> 00:50:06,223
You can't start the car.
Johnny has the keys.

776
00:50:10,027 --> 00:50:11,228
BEN: You have a car?

777
00:50:11,262 --> 00:50:12,829
Where? Where is it?

778
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:14,564
You won't be able to start it.

779
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:15,699
BEN: Yeah. Yeah. I know.

780
00:50:15,732 --> 00:50:18,002
- Where is it?

HARRY: Good lord.

783
00:50:33,084 --> 00:50:34,818
News cameras have just returned

784
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:36,553
from a search and destroy
operation.

785
00:50:36,586 --> 00:50:38,822
This one conducted
by Sheriff Conan McClelland

786
00:50:38,855 --> 00:50:40,523
in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

787
00:50:40,557 --> 00:50:43,060
<i>All law enforcement agencies
and the military</i>

788
00:50:43,094 --> 00:50:44,761
<i>have been organized
to search out</i>

789
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:46,730
<i>and destroy
the marauding ghouls.</i>

790
00:50:46,763 --> 00:50:49,133
<i>A ghoul can be killed
by a shot in the head</i>

791
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:51,135
<i>or a heavy blow to the skull.</i>

792
00:50:51,168 --> 00:50:53,104
<i>Officials are quoted
as explaining</i>

793
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:55,172
<i>that since the brain
of a ghoul has been activated</i>

794
00:50:55,206 --> 00:50:56,773
<i>by the radiation,</i>

795
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:59,210
<i>kill the brain
and you kill the ghoul.</i>

796
00:50:59,243 --> 00:51:01,178
Chief McClelland,
how's everything going?

797
00:51:01,212 --> 00:51:04,048
Oh, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.

798
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:06,583
You wanna get on the other side
of the road over there.

799
00:51:06,616 --> 00:51:08,718
Chief, do you think we'll be
able to defeat these things?

800
00:51:08,752 --> 00:51:11,255
Well, we killed 19 of them today
right in this area.

801
00:51:11,288 --> 00:51:13,224
Those last three we caught
trying to claw their way

802
00:51:13,257 --> 00:51:14,891
into an abandoned shed.

803
00:51:14,924 --> 00:51:16,093
They must have thought
somebody was in there.

804
00:51:16,127 --> 00:51:17,694
There wasn't though.

805
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:19,096
We heard them making
all kinds of noise.

806
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,597
We came over and beat them off,

807
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,033
- blasted them down.
- OFFICER: Chief,

808
00:51:22,066 --> 00:51:23,800
as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?

809
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,902
- Yeah, okay.
- Chief, if I were surrounded

810
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:27,171
by six or eight of these things,

811
00:51:27,204 --> 00:51:28,339
would I stand a chance
with them?

812
00:51:28,372 --> 00:51:29,906
Well, there's no problem.

813
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:31,242
If you had a gun,
shoot them in the head.

814
00:51:31,275 --> 00:51:32,742
That's a sure way to kill them.

815
00:51:32,776 --> 00:51:34,011
If you don't,
get yourself a club

816
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:35,745
or a torch.
Beat them or burn them.

817
00:51:35,779 --> 00:51:37,647
- They go up pretty easy.
- Well, Chief McClelland,

818
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,050
how long do you think it'll take

819
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:41,018
until you get the situation
under control?

820
00:51:41,052 --> 00:51:42,319
Well, that's pretty hard to say.

821
00:51:42,353 --> 00:51:44,155
When we find them,
we can kill them.

822
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,688
We'll be at it
most of the night,

823
00:51:45,722 --> 00:51:47,124
probably into the early morning.

824
00:51:47,158 --> 00:51:48,993
We're working our way to Willard
and we'll team up

825
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:50,827
with the National Guard
over there,

826
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,862
then we'll be able to give
a more definite view.

827
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,335
Is the fuse box in the cellar?

Helen?

831
00:52:07,911 --> 00:52:09,313
I have to get that gun.

832
00:52:09,346 --> 00:52:12,083
Haven't you had enough?

833
00:52:12,116 --> 00:52:14,251

because of that guy.
