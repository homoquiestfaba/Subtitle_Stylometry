That's good to hear.

I really respect what you did
back in the day.

364
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:36,475
We all heard

- [both] No.
- No?

Oh, my grandma.

In the business we're in,
loyalty goes a long way.

Behind every king...

391
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:46,812

She always supported my father,
no matter what.

This crew, where did you
meet this crew?

398
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:09,268
It all started with Dominic.

399
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:14,373
And then I took in Willy
as an orphan.

400
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,009
And then this one.

401
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:20,579
Seems to be a recurring theme
in my life.

402
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:22,981

And they run.
Get the fuck out.

428
00:26:30,682 --> 00:26:32,085
The entire shipment?

429
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:35,220
Everything was normal.

430
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:37,122
The guys were on point
and ready to cross,

431
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:39,958
and just like that, behind us,
three cars, police.

432
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:41,660
Mexican or American?

433
00:26:41,693 --> 00:26:44,396
Mexican.

434
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,065
Someone from this side
tipped them off.

435
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,834
Who else knows
about the crossing?

436
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:50,636
No one.

437
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:51,937
Hmm.

438
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,673
Only the Feliz cartel.

439
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:57,376
You think it was Juan?

440
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,612
It's too coincidental that our
first shipment gets busted.

441
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,280
Nah.

442
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:05,517
Roberto's been keeping it
a secret from him.

443
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,619
I need you to find out
who the fuck ratted us out.

444
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:12,290
Jefe, what are you going to do
about the Feliz brothers?

445
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:25,937
I appreciate you coming
to tell me face-to-face.

446
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:30,342
Most narcos would just
lie about it.

447
00:27:32,744 --> 00:27:34,813
But I have to say,
this isn't a very good start

448
00:27:34,846 --> 00:27:36,648
to our new endeavor, <i>mijo.</i>

449
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:40,952
I know.

450
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:45,657
Juan's going
to lose his shit.

451
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:51,930
But here's what I'm going to do.

452
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,267
I'm going to give you three days

453
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,537
to find out who the fuck
sold you out.

454
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,272
And then...

455
00:28:02,574 --> 00:28:03,975
I tell Juan.

456
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:09,082
And if I don't find him...

457
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,916
then what?

458
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:15,287
You already know
the answer to that.

459
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:19,725
Even if I pay for it?

460
00:28:22,427 --> 00:28:24,763
This isn't about
the money, <i>mijo.</i>

461
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:26,832
It's about trust.

462
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:30,836
And if we can't trust you
to deliver...

463
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:32,871
then we are not really
business partners.

464
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:35,707
And if we are not really
business partners, then...

465
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:40,345
what are we?

466
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,583
I get it.

467
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:49,387

that you pull this through.

Who do you think sold us out?

I don't know yet.

00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:06,172
But I think it's someone
in my organization.

471
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:09,875
I believe they'd do that before
they sell out to another cartel.

You know,
with the Bastille cartel...

478
00:29:26,691 --> 00:29:30,595
we tried to keep loyalty tests
simple at first.

479
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:35,268
Leave some expensive jewelry,
some cash,

480
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,270
where they could find it.

481
00:29:37,302 --> 00:29:40,472
See how long it would take
them to return it.

482
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:43,508
Even if you suspect
somebody might not be loyal,

483
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:46,145
you put a bullet
in that motherfucker's head.

484
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:49,081
That way, everybody knows
you mean business,

485
00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:51,349

that shit again.

486

Well, I know the most effective
way to find out

00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:20,112
if somebody is working for
the police in your organization.

494
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:23,849
Because there's one thing
that separates us from them.

And what's that?

496
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,523

You played football,

What's your point?

692
00:43:09,348 --> 00:43:10,983
Something I've always wondered

00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:12,784
ever since you got
onto my radar.

694
00:43:12,818 --> 00:43:15,320

Just the flip side
of the same coin.

My parents never saw me
for what I am.

716
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,322
My neighbor wanted
some coke.

717
00:44:24,356 --> 00:44:26,625
And my brother was lame.
He didn't...

718
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:28,794
He didn't know anything
about coke, you know?

719
00:44:28,827 --> 00:44:31,797
And so he gave me the job.

720
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:36,735
I found a good coke connection,

721
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:40,839
but he didn't want to get up
off any product, so...

722
00:44:40,872 --> 00:44:42,674
I ended up having to stab him.

723
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,742
[scoffs]

724
00:44:43,775 --> 00:44:45,310
And the rest is history.

725
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,513
You?

726
00:44:49,848 --> 00:44:52,217
Yeah, I started selling weed
in high school.

727
00:44:54,053 --> 00:44:55,787
I got busted.

728
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,924
Didn't want to face
the charges.

729
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:03,695
Came down here,
never looked back.

730
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:06,498
Man.

731
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:08,834
Shit's way different
these days.

732
00:45:10,302 --> 00:45:12,704
Nah, nothing's changed.

733
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:14,773
It's all the same.

734
00:45:14,806 --> 00:45:16,775
Of course it has.

735
00:45:16,808 --> 00:45:18,677
Technology has changed.

736
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,246
Everything is smarter
and faster.

737
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,483
Yeah, yeah,
all that shit changes...

738
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,519
but people don't change.

739
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:29,955
We're all the same,
human beings

740
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:31,656
doing whatever they do.

741
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,228
So, what's your point?

742
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,361
[laughs]

743
00:45:36,394 --> 00:45:38,764
Where does it end?

744
00:45:38,797 --> 00:45:40,699
Who says it will?

745
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:42,934
[sighs]

746
00:45:42,968 --> 00:45:44,302
You're smarter than that.

747
00:45:44,336 --> 00:45:46,972
You know this can only end
in death,

748
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:49,608
institutions or insanity.

749
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:54,946
Not for you, it hasn't.

750
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,448
[scoffs]

751
00:45:56,481 --> 00:45:58,550
I'm in my own prison.

752
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:02,521
Yeah? How so?

753
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:03,722
Hmm!

754
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:05,557
Are you kidding?

755
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,425
Fifteen years on the run.

756
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:10,762
Living from motel to motel,
out of suitcases.

757
00:46:10,796 --> 00:46:13,832
Sitting in a restaurant watching
everybody who walks in,

758
00:46:13,865 --> 00:46:17,502
wondering if this the <i>vatos</i>
gonna kill me.

759
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:21,473
When it happens,
you'll see it coming.

760
00:46:22,474 --> 00:46:24,476
Death is not going to come.

761
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,349
How much you want to bet
that within three weeks,

762
00:46:31,383 --> 00:46:33,618
I'm going to double up my men,

763
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:37,489
and I'll be sitting at the head
of the Feliz cartel.

764
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,296
[knock on door]

765
00:46:43,328 --> 00:46:46,531
[Dominic]
Boss, Roberto Feliz is here.

766
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,602
[mutters]

767
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,738
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.

768
00:46:54,406 --> 00:46:56,175
What is it?

769
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:57,943
[in Spanish]

770
00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:06,185
Hey?

771
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:07,853
What a nice surprise.

772
00:47:07,886 --> 00:47:09,855
[in Spanish]

773
00:47:11,057 --> 00:47:12,424
[chuckles]

774
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,759
How'd you know
how to find me?

775
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:16,761
I have a GPS up your ass,
<i>cabrón.</i>

776
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:19,165
Come on, I want to take you
somewhere to see something.

777
00:47:19,198 --> 00:47:21,600
- Where?
- It's going to be a surprise.

778
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:23,969
[in Spanish]

779
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:32,311
[in English]
Get out of here, no, no.

780
00:47:32,345 --> 00:47:33,678
I want to take you
to a special place.

781
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:37,216
I think you guys should have
some breakfast.

782
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,650
[Roberto]
Juan's pissed at me

783
00:47:38,683 --> 00:47:40,353
because I told him
after the fact.

784
00:47:40,385 --> 00:47:42,721
But you know what?
He's willing to forgive you,

785
00:47:42,754 --> 00:47:45,457
because he knows that you
found out who the rat is.

786
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:50,428
It's okay, we get to do
some bonding now, right?

787
00:47:50,462 --> 00:47:52,198
Two brothers.

788
00:47:52,231 --> 00:47:53,798
[sniffs]

789
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,570
Man, all bullshit aside...

790
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:04,743
nothing enrages me more...

791
00:48:07,412 --> 00:48:09,181
than betrayal.

792
00:48:12,484 --> 00:48:14,619
Never forget the first day
I tasted it.

793
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:18,456
I was 12 years old
in Guadalajara with my dad.

794
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,025
Pulls up into some shitty
fucking alleyway,

795
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:23,029
starts talking to these guys
that buy and sell sex slaves.

796
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:27,366
[sniffs]

797
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,434
Next thing I know...

798
00:48:32,637 --> 00:48:34,739
he leaves me there
with them.

799
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:40,413
You know, my dad meant
the fucking world to me.

800
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:42,013
I fucking loved him.

801
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:46,718
But that day
changed everything.

802
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:49,654
He sold me off to those
<i>pinche cabrónes</i> for sex.

803
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:55,460
My own fucking dad.

804
00:48:55,493 --> 00:48:58,097
Just so he could feed
my mother's drug habit.

805
00:48:58,964 --> 00:49:00,299
He really loved her.

806
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,534
They had a really
good bond.

807
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:05,503
But he did that to me.

808
00:49:05,537 --> 00:49:07,273
It's all right.

809
00:49:07,306 --> 00:49:10,942
A few months later,
I fucking escaped.

810
00:49:10,976 --> 00:49:12,711
Jumped off a balcony.

811
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:16,781
Broke my leg,
but I kept running.

812
00:49:16,815 --> 00:49:19,185
But that day,
I made a vow.

813
00:49:19,218 --> 00:49:21,686
And that vow
was that one day,

814
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,521
when I was old enough...

815
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,024
I was going to find him

816
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:29,462
and I was going to put the
barrel of a gun in his mouth,

817
00:49:29,494 --> 00:49:31,297
and I would make him
fucking suck it

818
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,798
the way he made me
suck dicks.

819
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:38,170
And then five years later,
almost to the day.

820
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:40,839
I find this motherfucker.

821
00:49:41,806 --> 00:49:43,842
He's in some shitty motel
with my mom.

822
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:44,876
I get in there.

823
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:47,846
They're all snuggled up
together.

824
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:50,615
I put the fucking barrel
right to his mouth...

825
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:52,717
and boom!

826
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:54,053
I fucking blew
his brains out,

827
00:49:54,086 --> 00:49:55,787
right in front
of my fucking mother.

828
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,522
You should have seen
the fucking look on her face

829
00:49:57,555 --> 00:49:59,392
when she realized
she was actually wearing

830
00:49:59,425 --> 00:50:01,193
my father's fucking brains
and his blood

831
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:02,594
all over her fucking body.

832
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:03,762
It was fucking classic.

833
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,864
[laughs]
I'll never forget it.

834
00:50:07,866 --> 00:50:09,567
[sighs]

835
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:11,270
[speaks Spanish]

836
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:12,971
[in English]
That's life.

837
00:50:13,004 --> 00:50:15,673
Got a friend for you
we're going to see.

838
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:22,614
You forgot one of the most

839
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:24,483
important rules
of the game, amigo.

840
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:27,053
Not only do we kill
the rat,

841
00:50:27,086 --> 00:50:30,555
we got to make
the family disappear too.

842
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:34,793
[in Spanish]

843
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:37,996
This is the only family I could
find of this Sebastian Montoya.

844
00:50:39,731 --> 00:50:41,633
Parents died
about ten years ago.

845
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,635
No aunt, no uncles.

846
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:44,736
Fucking sad, really.

847
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:46,105
[Roberto chuckles]

848
00:50:46,138 --> 00:50:47,872
But that girl
that you were fucking.

849
00:50:47,906 --> 00:50:49,408
Uh, Monique?

850
00:50:49,442 --> 00:50:51,976
She's one of my girls,
actually.

851
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:55,747
I went to her,
and she told me

852
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,583
all about this pretty
little dyke.

853
00:50:58,616 --> 00:51:00,785
She's fucking pretty,
isn't she?

854
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,630
Your brother was
a piece of shit traitor.

855
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:15,834
And you're the last rat
that's left.

856
00:51:15,867 --> 00:51:20,439
And now, we're going
to completely eliminate you

857
00:51:20,473 --> 00:51:22,141
from the face
of this earth.

858
00:51:23,075 --> 00:51:24,676
That's fucking exciting,
isn't it?

859
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:26,512
It's almost like
it was meant to be.

860
00:51:26,545 --> 00:51:28,547
[muffled screams]

861
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:31,616
You were looking
for her, right?

862
00:51:31,649 --> 00:51:33,085
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

863
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,753
We're looking
for this crazy bitch.

864
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:38,457
That's what we do,
<i>hermano.</i>

865
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:40,625
Look out for each other.

866
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:45,264
So, how do you want to do this?

867
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:47,699
Want to slice her up?

868
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:49,268
You know what you can do?

869
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:51,970
You can fucking burn her,
like you did to her brother.

870
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:55,940
Or you know what I like to do?

871
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:57,709
This thing called
the four-way split.

872
00:51:57,742 --> 00:51:59,411
That's when you tie her arms
and legs to a horse,

873
00:51:59,445 --> 00:52:01,280
make them run in all directions,
and boom, she explodes.

874
00:52:01,313 --> 00:52:05,451
Then I take them down
to my <i>primo's</i> hog farm

875
00:52:05,484 --> 00:52:06,684
couple of miles away.

876
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:08,587
They're down to the bone
in an hour and a half.

877
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:11,123
- It's fucking amazing.
- [muffled screams]

878
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:14,627
You know what Juan
likes to do?

879
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:16,162
He likes to fucking
put them in acid.

880
00:52:16,195 --> 00:52:18,464
Can you believe that shit?
It's fucking gross.

881
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:19,998
There's boils and shit
that go everywhere.

882
00:52:20,032 --> 00:52:23,102
Something's fucking wrong
with that guy.

883
00:52:23,135 --> 00:52:26,272
Anyway, what do you
want to do?

884
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:30,075
Kneecap?

885
00:52:33,745 --> 00:52:35,880
[muffled scream]

886
00:52:38,816 --> 00:52:42,054
[muffled yelling]

887
00:52:44,856 --> 00:52:47,892
Oh. The old-fashioned way.
Okay.

888
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,496
I like that.

889
00:52:50,529 --> 00:52:52,964
Come on.

890
00:52:52,997 --> 00:52:54,966
I'll have these fuckers
bury her.

891
00:52:56,602 --> 00:52:58,237
Let's get dinner.

892
00:53:34,806 --> 00:53:36,542
What happened?

893
00:53:36,575 --> 00:53:38,210
Are you okay?

894
00:53:38,244 --> 00:53:40,112
Yeah.

895
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:49,488
Just go to sleep.
Go to sleep.

896
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:51,523
[in Spanish]

1247
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:25,263
[Erik] How the fuck did Alvaro
and Roberto's men find us?

1248
01:18:25,297 --> 01:18:28,233
Sebastian knows where
all out safe house are.

1249
01:18:28,266 --> 01:18:30,136
[Erik] You know what?
It's going to be okay.

1250
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:34,073
I just... I have to find out
another way to fuck Roberto up.

1251
01:18:34,107 --> 01:18:36,675
If I can get to him first...

1252
01:18:37,776 --> 01:18:39,644
then we stand a chance.

1253
01:18:55,393 --> 01:18:58,164
- Hey. We need to talk.
- Yeah? What is it?

1254

1255
01:18:59,998 --> 01:19:01,700
I need a favor.

Yeah, I'm listening.

1257
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:08,273
Look, let me take my daughter

1258
01:19:08,306 --> 01:19:10,243
to my aunt's in Guadalajara.

1259
01:19:10,275 --> 01:19:12,277
Let her have the baby.

1260
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:15,847
When she's healthy,
we'll call you, come join us.

1261
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:19,684
But I don't want her
with all this stress.

1262
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:22,287
Do you actually think
that I would let you

1263
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,589
take my unborn son
away from me?

1264
01:19:24,623 --> 01:19:26,525
Are you fucking delusional,
old man?

1265
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:28,560
Hey, this isn't about you.

1266
01:19:28,593 --> 01:19:31,663
This is about her
and your kid.

1267
01:19:33,365 --> 01:19:34,833
They're not going anywhere.

1268
01:19:34,866 --> 01:19:38,070
I'm not going to let them
leave my side.

1269

Get up.

1280
01:20:05,864 --> 01:20:07,566
She's gone.

1281
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,303
They left us.

1282
01:20:10,335 --> 01:20:12,038
They fucking left us.

What's the plan,
boss?

1287
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,368
We only got
one option.

1289
01:20:49,908 --> 01:20:53,079
To turn Roberto Feliz
in to the DEA.

1290

Well...

1291
01:20:58,516 --> 01:21:00,485
that's not
our only option.

1292
01:21:03,788 --> 01:21:05,857
- No?
- Hmm...

1293
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:09,694
We could just go out,
guns blazing.

1294
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:13,798
Tony Montana style?

1295
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,500
Fuck, yeah.

1296

1321

I expected more from you.

1333

1423
01:29:29,194 --> 01:29:30,962
[laughs]

1424
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,411
You're not
in America, boy.

1425
01:29:50,115 --> 01:29:52,618
[Erik]
No. No.

1426
01:29:52,651 --> 01:29:54,520
[electricity crackles]

1427
01:29:54,553 --> 01:29:55,587
[warden speaks Spanish]

1428
01:29:55,621 --> 01:29:56,921
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1429
01:29:56,954 --> 01:29:58,624
- [electricity crackles]
- [yells]

1430
01:29:59,892 --> 01:30:01,926
[cackles]

1431
01:30:01,959 --> 01:30:04,229
[groaning]

1432
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:10,469
[screams]

1433
01:30:23,081 --> 01:30:25,184
[cell door closes]

1434
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:30,923
[door lock thumps and beeps]

1435
01:30:30,955 --> 01:30:33,292
[door unlatches and opens]

1436
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,231
No.

1437
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:42,434
No...

1438
01:30:43,869 --> 01:30:45,471
[in English]
Give me a name.

1439
01:30:47,004 --> 01:30:49,808
Miguel Antonio.

1440
01:30:49,842 --> 01:30:51,210
Miguel Antonio.

1441
01:30:51,243 --> 01:30:53,912
He's on the
Feliz cartel payroll.

1442
01:30:53,946 --> 01:30:56,981
Give him his shower
and his phone call.

1443
01:31:20,038 --> 01:31:22,274
Welcome to your new home.

1444
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:33,352
[ringing]

1445
01:31:34,686 --> 01:31:35,854
This is Angelina.

1446
01:31:35,888 --> 01:31:37,322
[Erik, on phone]
<i>It's Erik.</i>

1447
01:31:37,356 --> 01:31:39,124
You got to get
the Department of Justice

1448
01:31:39,157 --> 01:31:40,259
to get me out of here.

1449
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,994
I'm an American,
goddamn it.

1450
01:31:42,026 --> 01:31:44,096
No one cares
if you are an American.

1451
01:31:44,129 --> 01:31:47,032
And you have to come to terms
for what you did

1452
01:31:47,065 --> 01:31:50,068
and how you are expected
to be treated, got it?

1453
01:31:50,102 --> 01:31:52,638
<i>I have already contacted
the Justice Department.</i>

1454
01:31:52,671 --> 01:31:54,306
They told me yesterday

1455
01:31:54,339 --> 01:31:56,708
<i>that they will expedite you
to the United States</i>

1456
01:31:56,742 --> 01:31:59,344
<i>within 30 days.</i>

1457
01:32:01,046 --> 01:32:03,382
- Can you hold them to that?
- <i>Seriously?</i>

1458
01:32:03,415 --> 01:32:07,219
They are the Justice Department.
They can't be held to shit.

1459
01:32:12,524 --> 01:32:14,793
Look, I don't think I'm going
to make it here that long.

1460
01:32:14,826 --> 01:32:18,297
The warden's playing some
sick-ass fucking games in here.

1461
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:19,865
I don't know what to tell you,

1462
01:32:19,898 --> 01:32:21,466
and I don't know what else
I can do.

1463
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,403
All I know, I do my job
calling them every day.

1464
01:32:24,436 --> 01:32:27,272
<i>And you wait for my good news,
you got it?</i>

1465
01:32:27,306 --> 01:32:28,674
Okay.

1466
01:32:33,912 --> 01:32:35,614
[sighs]

1467
01:32:39,184 --> 01:32:41,186
[gate buzzer sounding]

1468
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:43,388
[Erik] Tell me you got
some good news for me.

1469
01:32:43,422 --> 01:32:44,957
Something.

1470
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:46,425
You're not going to believe
this shit.

1471
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:48,260
<i>I gave them the whole thing.</i>

1472
01:32:48,293 --> 01:32:51,930
American, poor, lost citizen
thing, and it worked.

1473
01:32:51,964 --> 01:32:55,167
You are going to be expedited
tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

1474
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,270
<i>Can you make it until that?</i>

1475
01:32:58,303 --> 01:33:00,505
I don't have
much of a choice.

1476
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:04,376
Well, you don't.
Just one more night.

1477
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:07,846
<i>Maybe get some laundry duties.</i>

1478
01:33:07,879 --> 01:33:09,514
Do something.

1479
01:33:09,548 --> 01:33:10,916
Be around people,

1480
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:13,385
then the warden
can't get to you.

1481
01:33:13,418 --> 01:33:16,455
I don't think
that's possible.

1482
01:33:16,488 --> 01:33:18,057
Can you make it?

1483
01:33:18,091 --> 01:33:20,093
Just get me out of here
by 8:00 a.m.

1484
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:22,260
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

1485
01:33:26,198 --> 01:33:28,500
[birds tweeting]

1486
01:33:37,943 --> 01:33:39,745
[door buzzes open]

1487
01:33:47,552 --> 01:33:50,555
I hear you'll be leaving us
in the morning.

1488
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:54,826
So I got a little surprise
for you before you go.

1489
01:33:56,194 --> 01:33:57,796
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1490
01:33:57,829 --> 01:34:02,200
A solicitor, with very deep
pockets behind him.

1491
01:34:09,341 --> 01:34:11,576
Who the fuck are you?

1492
01:34:20,252 --> 01:34:22,688
I accept my last judgment.

1493
01:34:22,721 --> 01:34:25,323
I won't retaliate
against you, <i>hermano.</i>

1494
01:34:25,991 --> 01:34:27,693
[scoffs]

1495
01:34:41,506 --> 01:34:43,408

1497
01:35:19,178 --> 01:35:21,246
[sniffles]

1498
01:35:28,353 --> 01:35:30,255
[gasps softly]

1499
01:35:33,725 --> 01:35:34,826
[warden]

1500
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,495
[door buzzes closed]

1501
01:35:55,148 --> 01:35:57,349
[Pedro]
<i>When it happens,</i>

1502
01:35:57,382 --> 01:35:59,317
<i>you'll see it coming.</i>

1503
01:36:12,531 --> 01:36:14,900
