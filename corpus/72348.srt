1
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:15,882
That's Gene Krupa on the drums,
folks. And if you believe that....

2
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,167
No, that's yours truly on the skins.
Sometimes wish l was Gene Krupa.

3
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:24,643
-I think l was born in a different era.
-Robert Crane. Robert--

4
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:25,649
Enough! This is KNX-CBS, 1 070
on the AM dial, 93.1 on the FM dial.

5
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:30,928
Enough! This is KNX-CBS, 1 070
on the AM dial, 93.1 on the FM dial.

6
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:35,321
It is beautiful in Hollywood,
they tell me. 72 degrees outside...

7
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,525
...9:25 on the KNX clock--

8
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,761
Yes, Jack! l know!
l'll get to him.

9
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:44,046
That's Jackie Chapman,
our engineer, knocking.

10
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,565
Jack will be appearing later
today at the Ralphs market...

11
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:50,766
...in the fresh fruit section,
if l'm not mistaken.

12
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:53,440
As regular listeners know,
from time to time...

13
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,284
...we have special guests,
and today, somebody truly special.

14
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,004
Mr. Clayton Moore,
the Lone Ranger, right over here!

15
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:03,558
And l've always wanted
to do this with you--

16
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,161
-Hi-yo, Silver. Away!
-I never get tired of that.

17
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:11,241
Do people recognize you
when you're out in public?

18
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:12,888
No. No, not really.

19
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:16,001
Can we get you to expose
yourself today on radio?

20
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,605
-Mask off? Reveal your identity?
-For you, Bob, sure.

21
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:23,722
Coming up next, a KNX first. We've
got the Lone Ranger, and he's naked!

22
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:26,644
-Don't tell Tonto.
-No, of course not.

23
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,319
First, a word from our sponsor,
Lucky Strike cigarettes.

24
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,158
I always wanted
to make an impression.

25
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:48,207
You know the type.
There's one in every class.

26
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:52,999
The cutup. Eddie Cantor once told
me likeability is 90% of the battle...

27
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:57,082
...and he was riaht.
Well, that's me.

28
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:00,646
I'm a likable auy.

29
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:04,523
Bob, sit!

30
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:08,045
Please?

31
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,643
I'm emceeing a lunch in an hour.

32
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:12,527
Humour me.

33
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,999
-Those the contracts l need to sign?
-Sit!

34
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:22,167
Your ears would've been
burning this morning.

35
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:25,487
I had breakfast with
the boys from CBS.

36
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:27,367
Got something very interesting.

37
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:30,043
This could be what you're looking for.

38
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:32,721
-What?
-A television series!

39
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,677
-Goodbye, Lenny.
-Listen to me. Stop running, will you?

40
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:39,722
I thought you were gonna get me
a Jack Lemmon role.

41
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:44,286
A feature. It's a critical time for me.
I need something big.

42
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,007
I can be Jack Lemmon.

43
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,803
You are Jack Lemmon.
And Jack Benny.

44
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,079
-Then get me a role.
-That's what this is!

45
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,605
Lemmon and Benny combined.
They want you for the lead.

46
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,329
Just promise me
you'll keep an open mind.

47
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:59,525
You ready?

48
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,438
It's set in a German prison camp.

49
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,282
-It's a drama?
-No! That-- It's a comedy.

50
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:09,960
Oh, with the funny Nazis.

51
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:15,279
-It's a POW camp.
-With a laugh track?

52
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,761
Hey. This is first-class
all the way, my friend.

53
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,519
Bing Crosby Productions doing it.

54
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,123
Sounds like it could be
a career-killer.

55
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:34,923
Just read it?

56
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:42,767
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and was buried.

57
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:46,763
He descended to the dead.
On the third day, he rose again.

58
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:51,599
He ascended into heaven and is
seated at the right hand of the Father.

59
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:56,559
He will come again to judge
the living and the dead.

60
00:05:56,809 --> 00:06:00,165
-You need a little bit of this.
-There you go, Bobby.

61
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,206
I think it's perfect for me.
I mean this character, Hogan...

62
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,805
...he's quick on his toes,
he's hip, he's a con artist.

63
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,722
I think it's what l've been
working toward my whole career.

64
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:13,762
You've been working
towards Holocaust comedy?

65
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:17,478
-Anne!
-What, Bob?

66
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,729
Not in front of the children.
They look up to me.

67
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,801
They're small.
They look up to everyone.

68
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,482
-That's funny. I gotta use that.
-Bob, for 1 5 years...

69
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,881
...l've followed you from job to job.
I'm your number one supporter.

70
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:47,519
I believe in you. But you expect
me to keep quiet when l see you...

71
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:51,238
...about to do something
that could ruin your career?

72
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:08,087
No, not me! Oh, no!

73
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,000
Help! Help!

74
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,761
Those are the riaht words....

75
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:17,807
All right, honey. You're right.

76
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,288
Family comes first.

77
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:22,686
I guess it's more important
than some TV show.

78
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,407
You really like the script?

79
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,402
It runs circles around
the other stuff l've been offered.

80
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:28,763
I know.

81
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,248
I read it.

82
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,365
You did?

83
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:36,805
It's funny.

84
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:40,003
Are you saying what
l think you're saying?

85
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,118
You'll quit KNX?

86
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:47,725
First l'll do both, like we did on
Donna Reed, but if it works....

87
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,607
Well, Donna Reed was part-time.

88
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,841
I just hope l can pull it off.
Hogan's in almost every scene.

89
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,719
You worry. You always worry,
but in the end you succeed.

90
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,766
Easy for you to say.

91
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,919
Hello, Henry.
Now, we're all professionals here.

92
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:11,525
You've all been working on your
characters, each with his own slant.

93
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:14,038
We have to keep in mind
this is a gang comedy.

94
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:17,645
It's funny to the extent the gang
is funny. Like an athletic team.

95
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:20,277
A great quarterback
without his offensive line...

96
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:21,848
...ain't gonna complete a pass.

97
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,045
Did you hear about the
Greek quarterback...

98
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,245
...who hated to leave
his buddies behind?

99
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:29,480
I think we get the point.

100
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,523
Let's pick up with Klink and Hogan.

101
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,721
The great disciplinarian...

102
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:39,564
...knows when to reward
and when to punish.

103
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,244
Now, my leniency
is a legend, right?

104
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,606
Wrong. You've got a reputation
to uphold, colonel.

105
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:49,567
You know that. I mean,
you're running the most brutal...

106
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,242
...prison camp in all of Germany!

107
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:52,438
Okay.

108
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:55,567
Let's back up.
Bob, don't try so hard.

109
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:58,243
You're the hero of the show.
It's named after you.

110
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:02,243
And heroes don't try and be
heroes, they simply are. Okay?

111
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,206
Let's do it again. Same place.

112
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:07,247
The great disciplinarian knows--

113
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:11,522
--when to reward and when to punish.
Now, my leniency is a legend, right?

114
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:13,321
-Wrong.
-What do you mean?

115
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:15,878
You've got a reputation
to uphold, colonel.

116
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,922
You are running the most brutal
prison camp in all of Germany.

117
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,000
-I am?
-In the world! You're ranked third...

118
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,239
-...behind Devil's lsland and Alcatraz.
-Good.

119
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:25,161
And you're the toughest
Kommandant.

120
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:29,641
In the last war it was " Kill the Kaiser."
Today it's " Kill Klink."

121
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,597
" Kill Klink." l like that.

122
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,568
Mel Rosen. I do a little radio show
out of the Quad Cities.

123
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:54,084
I've actually heard
good things about that.

124
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:57,605
-Coming from you, that's high praise.
-You gotta give me a tape for that.

125
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,885
-Something to drink?
-A grapefruit juice.

126
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:03,359
-With vodka?
-No, straight. Last of the straight men.

127
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,838
I'll have another Tom Collins.

128
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:09,479
Doing a show on the new TV season.
Never pass up one of these junkets.

129
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,527
-Well, l'm with you there.
-So this new show--

130
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:14,566
I loved you on Donna Reed,
by the way.

131
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:17,038
It's set in a concentration camp.
A comedy?

132
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,927
Prisoner of war camp.

133
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:23,560
Yeah, it's got all your typical comedy
elements: Gestapo, police dogs.

134
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:25,560
So l guess if you
liked World War ll...

135
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:28,846
...you're gonna love Hoaan's Heroes.

136
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:35,047
-No, let's not--
-Actually, l got what l want.

137
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:38,519
Mel, what--?
l thought you were a fellow entertainer.

138
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,839
I'm also a Jew.

139
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:43,605
It's the same thing.

140
00:10:57,409 --> 00:10:58,398
Thank you.

141
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:00,560
Are one of those for me?

142
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:03,402
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

143
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:05,961
Bob! Look what l found.

144
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,847
-Hiya.
-Hiya.

145
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:12,685
This TV reviewer, he just--
I don't mean to offend anybody.

146
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,601
Forget it. Do you see this spread?

147
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,680
Yeah, l gotta hand it to CBS.

148
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:18,282
They did it for one reason:

149
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:22,124
The affiliates have seen the pilot.
They love it.

150
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:25,964
-You play Hogan, don't you?
-I sure do. You want an autograph?

151
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:29,007
-I've got autographs.
-Darling, you just stop that.

152
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:31,080
Mr. Crane is a happily married man.

153
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:36,164
You wanted to see my room, right?
lt's right this way.

154
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:42,881
Did you catch the radio show
this morning? Guess who was on.

155
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,885
Were you listening?
Johnny Winters.

156
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,764
I swear, he's gotta be the funniest
human being ever born.

157
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,807
Honey?

158
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:02,046
What's wrong?

159
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,358
Why do we have shady magazines
hidden in our garage?

160
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:16,483
Those? Those are....

161
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,642
-You know, photography magazines.
-Gent? Cauaht?

162
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,369
I'm a photo nut, Annie, so....

163
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,407
Nature Girls 1965?

164
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,525
They're harmless.

165
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:35,606
-No wonder you never look at me.
-Would you stop that?

166
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:41,526
Listen, l'm out the door every morning
at 5:30. I'm not home until after dark.

167
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,123
You see how hard l'm working?

168
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:50,679
-Are you seeing another woman?
-Absolutely not.

169
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:55,083
I want those magazines
out of the house.

170
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:58,286
Yeah, l'll throw them away.

171
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:02,601
-I've seen them before. I just ignored it.
-All right, l get the message.

172
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:06,159
Bad enough l've gotta hide them
like some teenager.

173
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,126
Well, what did you have in mind?

174
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,928
Putting them on the coffee table
for our guests to see?

175
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:12,647
I apologize.

176
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:16,518
-Maybe we should see Father Donnelly.
-No, it's our business.

177
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:19,408
Family business.
We'll keep it at home.

178
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:23,244
You're never home. I just thought
when you started shooting Hoaan's...

179
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:29,041
-...that this would change things.
-It will, darling. Trust me. It will.

180
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,607
Hogan's Heroes premiered
September 1 7, 1965...

181
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,600
...8.:30 on Friday niaht.

182
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,964
When the Nielsen ratinas
were released...

183
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:41,644
... Hogan's, out of 98 prime-time shows,
finished number five.

184
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,369
Of the new shows,
it was number one.

185
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,918
I've always had
an extraordinary amount of luck.

186
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,239
Beina in the riaht place
at the riaht time.

187
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:52,958
There was some controversy
the first few months, but it died away.

188
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,882
Mondays we blocked the show.
Tuesdays we did exteriors.

189
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:58,438
Wednesdays and Thursdays
we did interiors.

190
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:01,487
Friday we'd have a table readina
of the next week's script.

191
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,959
Weekends we called each other
and went over everythina. I loved it.

192
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:09,407
Give me a vacation,
and three days later l'm aoina crazy.

193
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,728
Not another power outage.

194
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,165
No, sir. I'm installing Richard's
new high-fidelity unit.

195
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:20,560
-In his trailer here?
-I can wire anything.

196
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:23,402
-Yeah?
-You got a second?

197
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,799
Let me show you something.

198
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:32,723
I designed this myself. Listen.

199
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:40,361
Pretty groovy, huh?

200
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:44,361
-I'm Bob Crane.
-John. John Carpenter.

201
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:56,077
Well, l've never been much into hi-fi.

202
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:58,717
-Photography's always been my thing.
-I'm with you.

203
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:01,483
If you like photography,
you'll love VTRs.

204
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,526
-"VTRs"?
-Videotape recorders.

205
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:08,843
Magnetic coding, like audio tape.
Same principle, only with pictures.

206
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,126
Sony, Ampex, Panasonic,
they're all developing VTRs.

207
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,928
-Hi, Bob.
-Hey, Robert. So this is like your...?

208
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:17,683
I sort of freelance.
I work with Sonycom from Japan...

209
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:20,682
...helping them introduce
helical-scan VTRs.

210
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:23,488
I sold Dawson the third VTR
in the U.S.

211
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,244
-Sold one to LBJ, Elvis.
-Yeah?

212
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:31,038
Showed him how to use it. Nice cat.

213
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,799
Back in 1 5 minutes, Bob.

214
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:36,688
Shoot, gotta run.

215
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,680
-Nice meeting you.
-All right.

216
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:40,601
Carpenter.

217
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,357
-" FBl."
-Full-blooded lndian.

218
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:50,445
Well, actually, half-blooded.
Here, take my card.

219
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,123
Dawson and l are hooking up
over at Salome's later...

220
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,439
...if you want to come and join us.

221
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:59,568
-I actually prom--
-You'd like it. It's a nice joint.

222
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:01,959
-House band. Strippers.
-Well....

223
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,120
Hey, mate. How's it coming?

224
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,361
You're all set up, big daddy.
Eight watts of pumping power.

225
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:12,319
Hear that? l just got
the best bloody hi-fi on this lot.

226
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:14,761
I gotta run.

227
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,567
Salome's.

228
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,326
-Colonel! How's it hanging?
-Can't complain.

229
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:51,241
Glad you could make it.

230
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:54,845
Richard. I brought you
a call sheet for tomorrow.

231
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,241
I already got one.
Let me get you something to drink.

232
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:05,044
-I'll have a grapefruit juice.
-Come on, Bob, don't be such a prick.

233
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,007
Miss Kitty.

234
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,204
Miss Kitty! Let's give her a big
Hollywood hand, ladies and gentlemen.

235
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,081
We'll take a break,
let the band drain their nozzles...

236
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,717
...so be right back.

237
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,603
Terrific dancer, baby.

238
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,008
I love what you do.

239
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:50,569
-Colonel Hogan?
-Can we help you?

240
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:53,801
-You want an autograph?
-Yeah, sure, thanks. Okay.

241
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:57,086
My name's Nickie D.
I'm the drummer here.

242
00:17:57,249 --> 00:18:00,844
You're on that show too, aren't you?
You play the British guy.

243
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:06,247
I used to listen to your show every
morning back when l had a real job.

244
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,162
Was that really you
playing the drums on the radio?

245
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:13,686
-Sure it was. You think l was faking?
-You did a lot of kidding.

246
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,480
Not about that.

247
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:20,119
You want to sit in?

248
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,405
As a special treat,
sitting in on drums...

249
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,847
...Colonel Robert Hogan from the hit
TV series Hoaan's Heroes, Bob Crane!

250
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,843
Come on, let's hear it!

251
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,446
Kommandant, bring out
the little strudel. What do you say?

252
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,679
Come on! Angela, from Lubbock!

253
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,245
Thanks for meeting me like this, Father.
It must seem unusual.

254
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,365
Not at all.
We haven't seen you in a while.

255
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,566
I'm sorry. I'll be at Mass tomorrow
with Anne and the kids.

256
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,959
This TV show,
you wouldn't believe the hours.

257
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:12,687
Don't be so hard on yourself.

258
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:17,479
Everybody's life has its unique
demands. I'm glad you called.

259
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:22,923
-Thank you.
-So, what's on your mind?

260
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:25,683
Just the show, you know.
We work late.

261
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,645
When you get off,
you're all sort of jazzed up.

262
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:33,848
So l've been playing my drums,
you know, just to sort of wind down.

263
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,762
I've been playing
at various, you know...

264
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,840
...strip clubs.

265
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,601
Joints.

266
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:47,879
Would you be more comfortable
in the confessional?

267
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,079
Just wanted to talk.

268
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:54,921
Of course. Of course.
So does Anne know?

269
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:57,603
About the clubs? No.

270
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:01,318
No, but l think
it's obvious l've been...

271
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:02,922
I can't believe it!

272
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,841
...coming home later.

273
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:08,287
Mr. Crane, l am such a fan.

274
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:11,441
-I just wondered, could l--?
-A picture together? You bet.

275
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:13,201
And your name is?

276
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:15,564
-Oh, l forgot.
-You forgot your name?

277
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:18,084
-Not that. Julie.
-Julie, all right.

278
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,888
Right over here. "Schmile."

279
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:24,487
-There you go.
-Thank you.

280
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,446
Okay. Thank you.

281
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,878
Sorry about that, Father.

282
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,641
Where were we?

283
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:36,847
You and Anne.

284
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,925
It's not easy to resist temptation.

285
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:47,082
One has to remove oneself
from the occasion of sin.

286
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:49,319
You can't keep--

287
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:55,559
Listen. I know several musicians.
We play from time to time.

288
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,243
I'm no Bill Evans,
but l can keep up on keyboard.

289
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:02,163
Maybe we should
play together sometime.

290
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,847
After work.

291
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,569
Thank you. Yeah, that's....

292
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,685
It's a good idea.

293
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,564
-I love what you do.
-Thank you.

294
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:08,562
Bob? Bob.

295
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,085
That was great.

296
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,677
You don't remember, do you?

297
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,923
I'll give you a hint.

298
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:25,284
-Carpenter. John Carpenter.
-Right.

299
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:27,758
-How are they hanging?
-Pretty tight, my man.

300
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,568
I've been looking for you.
This is John Carpenter.

301
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:33,323
He's like the James Bond
of video nuts.

302
00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:37,323
Anybody wants the new stuff,
they gotta talk to him. This is Elaine.

303
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,923
-What a pretty name.
-Thank you.

304
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:42,603
-And Emily.
-Pleasure.

305
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:46,239
So, what's happening?
Where's the action tonight?

306
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:49,719
We were talking about grabbing
a bite to eat over at Arthur J's.

307
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:52,244
No, no, no, let's go to my pad.

308
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:56,721
You wouldn't believe this new equipment
they sent me. It'll blow your mind.

309
00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:00,802
Light hits this layer and stores
a charged density pattern on it...

310
00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:04,678
...which is scanned with an electron
beam. So the resulting signal...

311
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:08,205
...is sent by cable
to where it's recorded on tape.

312
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:11,918
The helical-scan method of the VTR
issues proper magnetic coding...

313
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,444
...so picture quality is always secure.

314
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,641
-I've never seen anything like this.
-Of course not.

315
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:21,846
That's the point. It's a prototype.

316
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:26,400
-That stereo over there.
-Yeah?

317
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:30,438
-Does it play music?
-Of course.

318
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:35,168
-Tonight?
-Of course.

319
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:36,808
Do you got any jazz?

320
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:39,199
-Name it.
-You got Procol Harum?

321
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:42,486
-I got Four Tops.
-Close enough.

322
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:46,127
Bob?

323
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:50,328
You wanna freshen the girls' drinks?

324
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,008
Bob.

325
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:04,639
Which one do you want?

326
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:08,960
-What do you mean?
-These girls are ready to get it on.

327
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:12,678
And you're the man,
so l figure you get first choice.

328
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,722
I don't really care.

329
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:18,608
If it's all the same to you,
l'll hit on the blond.

330
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:20,681
Copasetic?

331
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:23,925
Copasetic.

332
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:26,606
They're beautiful, right?

333
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:30,480
I'm gonna--
I'll have another hit of that vodka.

334
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:50,398
-Can l get you another drink?
-I'm not done with this one yet.

335
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:56,285
John tells me you used
to be a Bunny.

336
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:04,358
-Can you do the Bunny Dip?
-Can l do the Bunny Dip? Watch this.

337
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:16,167
-What's the matter? Don't you like me?
-No, it's not that.

338
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:18,126
I'm married.

339
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:20,402
So am l.

340
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:25,889
And l'm a one-woman man.

341
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:30,129
Hogan, you crack me up.

342
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:33,326
-No, it's--
-Well, l'm not Colonel Klink...

343
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:36,606
...or that other dummkopf.
What's his name? The fat one.

344
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,647
You can't pull that crap on me.

345
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:48,526
What's this?

346
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:50,919
A prop, l suppose.

347
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,607
What do you want?

348
00:25:54,769 --> 00:26:00,799
Colonel Hogan, l want you
to nail me to the fucking wall.

349
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:06,804
Whatever you want.

350
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:08,766
Anything.

351
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,403
Can we leave the lights on?

352
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:22,609
-Danke for the stockings, colonel.
-Don't tell anybody there's a war on.

353
00:26:31,449 --> 00:26:35,237
Herr Kommandant,
Colonel Hogan to see you.

354
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:38,446
The second season,
Cynthia Lynn, who played Helaa...

355
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:42,124
... was replaced by Patti Olsen,
screen name Siarid Valdis.

356
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:44,803
The character's name was Hilda.

357
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:48,848
Herr Kommandant,
Colonel Hogan to see you.

358
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,920
Kommandant, you wanted to see me?

359
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:54,604
Yes, Hogan, l have a very serious
matter to discuss with you.

360
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:57,158
I know everything
that happened last night.

361
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:00,446
-You do?
-You don't fool me for one moment.

362
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:02,998
Well, l know that, sir. Cigar?

363
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:06,759
Hogan!

364
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:11,242
Cut! Terrific.
All right, let's move on.

365
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:14,759
-That was very nice.
-Made me laugh.

366
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,559
Jeff, what do you think? Let's
swing around and do the other side?

367
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:24,445
-Nervous? That was great.
-I feel like a bad actress.

368
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,442
-Oh, my gosh, it was so good. Really.
-Thanks.

369
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:29,565
Everyone's so nice.
It's like a family.

370
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:33,085
Yeah, well, it depends what kind
of family you come from.

371
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:37,085
-Okay, come on, come on.
-Okay, you guys, you guys!

372
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:40,047
-Okay, go.
-All right. Okay. Cheese!

373
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:45,647
Completina the second season,
Hogan's was rated 1 7th by the Nielsens.

374
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,678
I'm Bob Crane's manager,
and we're having a little party later...

375
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:58,364
...and l was wondering
if you ladies would like to come.

376
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:01,646
A party with Bob Crane?

377
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:03,242
We'd love to.

378
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:08,127
You know who l'm talking about.
It's Klink's secretary.

379
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:11,281
-Helga?
-No, it's Hilda.

380
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:15,963
-She's got real beauty.
-Tighten up your pants?

381
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:18,689
-Yeah, but she's special, you know?
-They all are.

382
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:21,124
She's real. Not uptight.
You know what l mean?

383
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:24,565
-Here they are, Big Daddy.
-Quick, what are their names again?

384
00:28:24,729 --> 00:28:28,119
-Jill and Judy.
-Jill and Judy.

385
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:31,681
Chicks these days, it's like
they throw out all the rules.

386
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,567
I might be in love.
Which is which?

387
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:36,562
Jill's the blond,
Judy's the other one.

388
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:39,084
I'm going for the blond.

389
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:42,247
Bob, l had her all set up.

390
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:48,842
-I'm going for the blond.
-Bob, l've been working on her.

391
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:50,886
Brunette's not my type.

392
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:56,999
I'm sure you'll make do.

393
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,561
Come on.

394
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,202
Okay.

395
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:04,846
-Ladies!
-Hey, how are you?

396
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,681
-Hi. Jill, right?
-Jill, yeah.

397
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,282
-Jill, John.
-Bob Crane.

398
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,758
-Judy?
-Yeah, Judy. Nice to meet you.

399
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,442
Welcome.

400
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:15,567
So this is the party?

401
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:19,169
Colonel, apparently some
of the new recruits...

402
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:22,446
...are complaining
about the barracks again.

403
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:24,122
Hogan!

404
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,402
He does that just right.

405
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,082
Yeah!

406
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:34,686
You are so photogenic.

407
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:38,282
That's great! That's great!

408
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:41,969
I love that thing you do.

409
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:44,120
Hold on, hold on. I gotta get that.

410
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:48,680
-Take it off! Take it off!
-Fabulous. Set those puppies free.

411
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:53,479
-That's great.
-Go, Jill!

412
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:56,527
Carpy, more film!

413
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,485
That's fabulous.
That's fabulous. Really.

414
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,920
I didn't even know this thing was on.

415
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:09,398
I didn't want to freak you.
Give you--

416
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:13,687
-What, performance anxiety.
-I do my best work in front of a camera.

417
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:17,842
-I do mine behind.
-This is fabulous.

418
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:19,761
Where have you been all my life?

419
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:21,999
You do this for Dawson?

420
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:24,247
You don't like him, do you?

421
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:29,287
He tried for the lead, it went to me,
so he snips at me.

422
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:33,158
Little Brit fag cracks.
"Trouble with your lines, love?"

423
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,718
You know, always trying
to undercut me.

424
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:37,800
Jesus, look at her go.

425
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:40,928
You're gonna have to choose, Carp.

426
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:43,729
-It's him or it's me.
-Look, Bob.

427
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:46,278
She's giving you head.

428
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:56,608
We're gonna have to burn this tape.

429
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:02,122
How much did you say one
of these things costs?

430
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:07,241
Flowers 3 times a week is one thing,
but isn't this extravagant?

431
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,559
Wait till you see it.

432
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:17,401
-How does it work?
-You gotta see this thing. Carpy.

433
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:22,921
It doesn't bite. Just don't touch
these wires right here.

434
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,078
Okay.

435
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:29,484
Carpy says, " Don't touch."

436
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:36,922
Well, what will we do with it?

437
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:39,721
Home movies.

438
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:44,519
Smile! Come on, give me a smile.

439
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:46,919
Everybody give me a wave.

440
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:49,205
-I wanna get this side also.
-Thank you.

441
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:52,645
No, please. Bob!
Come on, l'm washing the dishes.

442
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:56,882
-I don't wanna be photographed.
-Look at that dress. I love that, honey.

443
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:01,645
All right, give me one more shot.
Here we go. One, two, big dance!

444
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,681
-Look at that.
-This is amazing.

445
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:09,647
-You just shot this today.
-Yeah, it's not like film.

446
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:11,959
With video,
there's no film processing.

447
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:15,087
We are light years ahead
of everybody.

448
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:19,800
Look at that.
It's like the Polaroid of home movies.

449
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:31,805
Herr Kommandant,
Colonel Hogan to see you.

450
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:38,366
Well, he did beat out
a million other sperm.

451
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:40,281
Think about that.

452
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:42,804
-Guess it's kind of hard to fathom.
-Yeah.

453
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:48,168
-You're so easy to talk to.
-It's because l speak English, Sigrid.

454
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,880
-Call me Patricia.
-Patricia.

455
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:56,884
Sigrid is my stage name.
To you, l'm Patricia.

456
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,959
And what brought you back to L.A.?

457
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:07,726
The usual things: a broken marriage.

458
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,880
Cheers to that.

459
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:12,688
Tired of being a housewife, you know?

460
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:15,488
So you came back here
where you can play one instead?

461
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:17,480
Something like that.

462
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:21,005
What about you, Hogan?
What are your dreams?

463
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:25,401
Besides drumming with Buddy Rich?

464
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:30,364
I dream about finding
somebody who gets me...

465
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:32,121
...who l am.

466
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:43,243
We're in the show together.

467
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:46,242
We have to keep up
the appearance of respectability.

468
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:49,242
I can be very respectable.

469
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:55,124
You're not really hungry, are you?

470
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm gonna get the check.

471
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:04,364
Yeah.

472
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:07,485
We're a Christian publication,
Mr. Crane.

473
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:09,321
Please. It's Bob.

474
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:13,323
So this is a little outside our
normal terrain. We usually don't do...

475
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:16,526
...Hollywood interviews,
what with the divorces and whatnot.

476
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:20,204
-Sure.
-That's why we're interested in you.

477
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:24,885
You've been married to your
high-school sweetheart for 1 6 years.

478
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:28,041
-Fifteen, actually.
-Fifteen years.

479
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,279
How do you do it? What's your secret?

480
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,607
Three words:

481
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:38,684
Don't...make...waves.

482
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:41,522
As every sailor knows,
when one set of waves meets...

483
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:44,920
...another set of waves
it can set up some chop.

484
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:48,286
And when three sets of waves
come together, it can make...

485
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:50,599
...for some mighty rough sailing.

486
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:54,398
It also helps sometimes
to have a harmless safety valve.

487
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:58,767
Because when l get tense,
l blow off steam.

488
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:01,962
And so when it comes
to my own family...

489
00:35:02,129 --> 00:35:04,927
...l don't make waves.

490
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:08,240
That's inspirational.
You're a fortunate man.

491
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,558
Yes.

492
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:13,479
Yes, l am.

493
00:35:22,129 --> 00:35:24,848
-You want me to run lines with you?
-No, l got it.

494
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:35,885
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

495
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:37,482
About what?

496
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:41,005
Neither of us has said anything,
but we both know.

497
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,003
Know what?

498
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:46,366
-We never spend any time alone.
-What do you call this?

499
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,087
Tense.

500
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:52,357
-Distant.
-Oh, you're being ridiculous.

501
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:54,682
Come on.

502
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:59,765
I didn't mean that. I just think
you're overreacting a little bit.

503
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:02,284
It's been a while
since we've done anything.

504
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:06,606
Or has work sapped all your energy?

505
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:21,923
My goodness, she was built.

506
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:25,517
-Mindy.
-Mandy. Mandy!

507
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,721
We should name a ride after her.

508
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:31,086
-Loop-de-Loop.
-Tilt-A-Whirl.

509
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:33,717
Watching these home movies
gets me so damn hot.

510
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:38,326
-They're videos, Bob. Videos.
-I got a hard-on the size of Florida.

511
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,684
-What was that?
-What?

512
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:42,922
Rewind the tape.

513
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:46,363
Just rewind it.

514
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:54,684
Okay. Okay, just play it from there.

515
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:55,884
Play it right there.

516
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,448
-What's that on my ass?
-What?

517
00:36:57,609 --> 00:36:59,008
Freeze it. Can you do that?

518
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:01,524
Not for long.
The image becomes unstable.

519
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:03,759
Freeze it right there!

520
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:11,243
What the hell is that on my ass?

521
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:14,483
That is my hand.

522
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:19,038
-Rubbing my ass?
-So what?

523
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:23,927
Your fingers are up my cheeks.
What you doing in there?

524
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:26,125
It's an orgy, Bob.

525
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:28,681
So you can just touch my ass?

526
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:31,247
I thought you liked it.

527
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:34,048
-I thought it was her! God!
-What's the difference?

528
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:36,769
The difference? You got
your fingers up my asshole!

529
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:38,282
Sorry.

530
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:39,768
Fuck you very much.

531
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:42,489
Bob, l said l'm sorry.
It's a group grope!

532
00:37:42,649 --> 00:37:44,526
You got your fingers up
around my ass!

533
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,008
We were just having fun.

534
00:37:46,169 --> 00:37:48,080
-You know what? You're a perv.
-What?

535
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:50,604
You're a fucking pervert.
Is that clear enough?

536
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,283
-A feyaele. Does that make sense?
-Bob, l'm sorry.

537
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:55,724
You know what? Hey!

538
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:01,200
I'll see you next time, Carpy.

539
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:02,802
Never!

540
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:09,645
Well, now, l guess,
is as good a time as any.

541
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,720
Thank you all for coming.

542
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:15,606
Since the introduction of the
CV 2000, we've been working...

543
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:19,045
...toward the development
of a colour videotape recorder.

544
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:21,598
Mr. Carpenter,
our Los Angeles representative...

545
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,043
...has a demonstration.

546
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,598
This system will demonstrate
what lies in store.

547
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,725
John, get the lights, please?

548
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:52,205
I knew it was in colour, but just one?

549
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:55,563
John, lights.

550
00:38:57,649 --> 00:39:00,447
We are experiencing
a little technical problem.

551
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:02,406
If you'd excuse us just a second.

552
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:05,481
There's hot coffee
and fresh Danish next door.

553
00:39:05,649 --> 00:39:07,765
It'll only be a few minutes,
l promise.

554
00:39:09,169 --> 00:39:10,966
Thank you. Thanks.

555
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:13,164
What's happened?

556
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:16,082
I don't know. I set everything
according to specs.

557
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:18,240
Well, fix it.

558
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,483
Looks fine to me.

559
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:24,209
It's green.
It's fucking green!

560
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:34,800
You really can't tell, can you?

561
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:38,368
You're fucking colour-blind.

562
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:39,928
-I'll fix it.
-Goddamn you!

563
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:43,877
I've got execs from Tokyo, every
network, and you pull a stunt like this?

564
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,121
-John, leave.
-I'm fired?

565
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:49,439
-Yeah. Get out.
-You can't do that.

566
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:51,088
It's done.

567
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:53,524
I've got the contacts.

568
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:55,884
Who do you think
got you the celebrities?

569
00:39:56,049 --> 00:40:01,601
I sold Vidicons to Tommy Smothers,
Dick Martin, Bob Crane.

570
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:04,078
I sold a VTR to Elvis!

571
00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:07,446
Do l need to call security?

572
00:40:09,129 --> 00:40:14,487
One, two, three! l didn't think
she was gonna get that last one.

573
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:16,719
Oh, what a beautiful cake!

574
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,359
Is it supposed to do that?

575
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:30,124
It's broken.

576
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:32,007
Six months?

577
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:34,842
Can you refer me to somebody?

578
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:40,680
Right. All right.
Well, thank you.

579
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:58,085
John, it's Bob.

580
00:40:58,249 --> 00:40:59,762
Yeah, l'm fine.

581
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,567
Yeah, how are you?

582
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:06,439
Oh, that's funny.

583
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:14,560
Well, the problem is, we've had a little
trouble with the VTR over here, and--

584
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:17,038
I know.
No, l know you're busy.

585
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:19,006
Of course.

586
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:22,367
I completely understand.
I thought maybe if you could...

587
00:41:22,529 --> 00:41:25,999
...you know, squeeze us in.

588
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:39,561
You work on this?

589
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:42,766
Well, l....

590
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:45,964
It's the video head drum.

591
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:49,127
You can't fix it with Scotch tape,
you know.

592
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:50,718
Is it serious?

593
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:54,598
No, l should be able to put
another one in there pretty quick...

594
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:57,647
...as long as nothing else is fucked up.

595
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:04,046
I really appreciate you coming over.
I tell anybody who asks:

596
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:07,201
"You need video equipment,
you see John Carpenter."

597
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:08,643
Dad!

598
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:11,403
-I'll be right there, honey!
-Bob?

599
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:14,527
I'm real sorry about
what went down at my place.

600
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:16,684
You're not still mad?

601
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:19,283
-I appreciate you coming over.
-Bob!

602
00:42:21,129 --> 00:42:22,357
I'm not a fag.

603
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:26,319
About Dawson...

604
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:29,208
...l told him l was getting
too busy to see him much.

605
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:30,848
You did?

606
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:33,318
How'd he take it?

607
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:38,323
What choice did he have?
You're my number one man, Bob!

608
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,841
Copasetic?

609
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:42,998
Copasetic.

610
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:44,568
Good.

611
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,085
Because, if you're into it,
one of my clients is having...

612
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:50,126
...a party up in the hills on Friday.

613
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:55,602
Lots of ladies. A hippie thing.
Could be fun.

614
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:05,601
Come on!

615
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:09,120
Come on in.

616
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:14,957
Wow.

617
00:43:15,129 --> 00:43:16,642
That's fun.

618
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:19,084
-Yes.
-Yeah!

619
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:21,763
-How's your show?
-Show's going really, real well.

620
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:23,157
Excuse me.

621
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:25,240
-Man, l loved your radio show.
-Yeah?

622
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:27,877
It was so cool,
you know, for its time.

623
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:30,563
-I used to listen every morning.
-Thank you.

624
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:32,720
-Can l get an autograph?
-Sure.

625
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:35,724
Will you sign me right here?

626
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:41,326
Thanks, Colonel Hogan.

627
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:45,839
Chinese, they'll just march right in.

628
00:43:46,009 --> 00:43:48,045
-You know what l'm saying?
-Give peace a chance.

629
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,200
-What are you gonna do about it?
-Relax.

630
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:51,438
John!

631
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:54,282
-Whatever.
-We're guests.

632
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:56,838
I fought for my country.

633
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,886
Look at the jugs on her.

634
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:04,681
Carp? Get a load of this.

635
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:14,320
No, no, that's good. I like that.

636
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:16,047
Here we go.

637
00:44:17,209 --> 00:44:19,723
Beautiful. Beautiful.

638
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:22,801
Want to try one of those
"schmile" pictures we talked about?

639
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,288
-Okay.
-Why not, huh?

640
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:28,647
We'll just--
There we go. And all set?

641
00:44:28,809 --> 00:44:29,958
Ready.

642
00:44:30,129 --> 00:44:32,245
-Schmile!
-Schmile!

643
00:44:35,249 --> 00:44:37,160
Really great.

644
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:40,645
I'm a normal,
red-blooded American man.

645
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:42,640
I like to look at naked women.

646
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:45,960
I love breasts. Any kind. I love them.

647
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:50,168
Boobs, bazooms,
balloons, baas, bazonaas.

648
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:51,682
The biaaer, the better.

649
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:56,081
Nipples like udders, nipples like
saucers. Bia pale, rosy-brown nipples.

650
00:44:56,249 --> 00:44:57,648
Little bitty baby nipples.

651
00:44:57,809 --> 00:45:00,881
Real or fake, what's the difference?
l like tits.

652
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:02,277
Who's kiddina who?

653
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:05,720
Tits are areat.

654
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:14,568
-There you are.
-Thank you.

655
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:16,128
Well, l just--

656
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:21,479
So you-- You actually
went to Las Vegas with the....

657
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:23,605
-You can't even say his name?
-Well....

658
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:26,078
Come on. I told you l was going.

659
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:31,161
Sure, but l didn't think
you were really gonna do it.

660
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:34,765
Bob, honey, you're already married.

661
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:39,241
She doesn't understand this life.
She'd rather be back in Connecticut.

662
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:41,320
She's not a Hollywood person,
you know?

663
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,081
She's so good. She's like a--

664
00:45:43,249 --> 00:45:44,728
A saint?

665
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:47,084
Come on, don't let her do that to you.

666
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:49,638
You are a good man.

667
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,879
What about the press?

668
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:53,884
The public reaction.

669
00:45:54,049 --> 00:45:56,404
We've got nothing to be ashamed of.

670
00:45:56,569 --> 00:45:59,879
You know, Ed actually suggested
we get married on the set.

671
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,687
CBS would love it.

672
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:03,646
Publicity.

673
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:08,322
Hey, remember what you said to me
the first time we had dinner together?

674
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:10,525
Yeah, that l was fluent in English.

675
00:46:15,449 --> 00:46:18,566
You said you wanted to find
a woman who understands you.

676
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:20,924
I do. I do.

677
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:27,239
You know, l have to let you
in on a little secret, baby.

678
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:32,488
The other women?
l know all about them.

679
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:38,444
You're okay with that?

680
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:41,647
We only go around once in this life.

681
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:44,721
I never want to lie about
who l am and l never want you...

682
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:46,527
...to lie about who you are.

683
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:53,241
You're not gonna change.
I know who you are and l love you!

684
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:55,604
And l love fucking you!

685
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:04,842
We can have any kind
of marriage we want.

686
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:12,638
You know, it can be such a drag.
I mean, chatting up broads.

687
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:15,084
You know me.
I'm a gentleman, l don't push.

688
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,525
But you gotta draw her out,
get her to talk about herself...

689
00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:22,125
...listen to her, act like you
give a shit to get her clothes off.

690
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:25,042
-And then, not even that.
-That's life with the ladies.

691
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,245
Bobby comes in with
that crooked smile...

692
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:30,003
...and gets a strike on the
frigging line every time.

693
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:32,637
-Well, Bob's gotta be careful.
-What do you mean?

694
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,198
I warned him.

695
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:40,204
He shows me his car full of nudie
pictures of him getting sucked off.

696
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:42,121
I said, " Bob, you're a big star.

697
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:44,883
What happens if you get
pulled over by the cops?"

698
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:49,168
He'd hit on the Virgin Mary with
Jesus standing right there if he could.

699
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:51,524
Richard, you are so bad.

700
00:47:51,689 --> 00:47:53,884
Hey, what's with this new
Sony colour system?

701
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:56,368
I'm not with Sony anymore.

702
00:47:56,529 --> 00:47:59,202
-I switched to Akai.
-Really?

703
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:01,519
Bob is just coming through the gate!

704
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:03,247
-It's about time.
-I better go.

705
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:07,402
-Listen. You don't need him.
-No, l better run.

706
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:12,165
I put that stuff you wanted in your
trailer. If you have any questions, call.

707
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,486
Hey, man.

708
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:16,728
-Good morning, Bob.
-Morning.

709
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:17,878
Clary.

710
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:19,801
Herr Hogan.

711
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:21,807
Had a late night, did we, Bob?

712
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:25,405
Armand, you do your job
and l'll do mine.

713
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,638
Stand aside!

714
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:29,687
Magician at work.

715
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:34,200
Take four.

716
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:36,725
And, action!

717
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:39,039
I'm serious about this, Hogan.

718
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:42,201
Well, colonel, it's not really
my responsibility, now, is it?

719
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:44,684
Hogan, l'm counting on you.

720
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,762
Well, l'll see what LeBeau can do.

721
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:50,524
What did you say?

722
00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:00,681
Hogan, what's bothering you?

723
00:49:04,129 --> 00:49:08,008
It would appear Colonel Hogan
is daydreaming again.

724
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:11,764
-What is this?
-You will tell us everything, Hogan...

725
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:14,568
...or we have ways of making you talk.

726
00:49:14,729 --> 00:49:16,845
What's...? What's going on?

727
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:18,528
You will tell us now.

728
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:20,927
Well, l don't know what to do.

729
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:23,922
Patti wants to get married,
but l can't do that to Anne.

730
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:27,479
-I'd never forgive myself.
-Himmler was in a similar situation.

731
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:29,844
-What did he do?
-He sent the wife...

732
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:33,240
-...and the mistress to Dachau.
-Tell me more.

733
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:36,247
All l think about all day long is sex.

734
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:41,881
Having sex.
Filming sex. Watching sex.

735
00:49:42,569 --> 00:49:46,847
Hogan, that's all any of us
really think about.

736
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:50,085
Nobody else has their
own video specialist.

737
00:49:50,249 --> 00:49:51,728
Video specialist?

738
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:55,325
Yeah, only mine's a fruit,
or a half-fruit, whatever it's called.

739
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:59,528
-You must send him to the Russian front!
-No! No, l can't replace him.

740
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:04,046
Sex thing, Patti thing, the fruit thing....
I don't recognize my own life anymore.

741
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:07,721
I'm ready for you, Hogan.

742
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:13,401
-What?
-It'll be a modern marriage.

743
00:50:13,729 --> 00:50:17,165
Klink and Schultzie can join in too.

744
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:21,886
Come on, Hogan. Fuck me right here.

745
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:27,399
The lighting's perfect!

746
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:30,481
Go for it, Big Daddy.
I've got you covered.

747
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:33,522
Bob? What do you say?

748
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:39,324
Go ahead. Fuck her, Bob.

749
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:43,481
Go balls-deep, Pop.

750
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:47,518
No, l can't.
Klink, tell me what to do.

751
00:50:47,689 --> 00:50:49,884
-What's the answer?
-The answer?

752
00:50:50,049 --> 00:50:52,517
We don't have answers. We're Nazis.

753
00:50:52,689 --> 00:50:54,168
Dismissed!

754
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,807
Dismissed, Hogan.

755
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:05,520
Dismissed, Hogan!

756
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:08,925
Hogan?

757
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:10,648
Bob!

758
00:51:13,009 --> 00:51:16,604
Are you with us?
You look like you drifted off there.

759
00:51:18,569 --> 00:51:22,005
Yeah. Sorry. Where were we?

760
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:01,682
Anne?

761
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:03,362
Oh.

762
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:08,121
Hey.

763
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:15,364
What a day!

764
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:20,207
I was cleaning up today...

765
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:23,007
...and l went into your darkroom.

766
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:25,718
Yeah, why'd you do that?

767
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:28,606
I saw them.

768
00:52:28,769 --> 00:52:30,361
Photography studies.

769
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:40,922
There was picture after picture.

770
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:45,043
You know l sometimes play
the drums at the clubs.

771
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:47,160
How many women are there?

772
00:52:49,409 --> 00:52:51,843
We need counselling....

773
00:52:52,129 --> 00:52:54,643
-How many?
-Anne, l'm sorry. I'm sorry.

774
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:01,369
I'm--
Anne. Anne, Anne, l'm sorry.

775
00:53:01,529 --> 00:53:04,123
Do you think the children
would be proud of you?

776
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:06,839
I'm sorry.

777
00:53:27,449 --> 00:53:31,647
I pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

778
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:37,598
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Crane.

779
00:53:39,809 --> 00:53:43,722
Hogan's Heroes left the airwaves
on July 4th, 1971...

780
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:48,007
...after six seasons and 186 shows.

781
00:53:48,689 --> 00:53:50,566
I was determined to do riaht by Anne.

782
00:53:50,729 --> 00:53:53,687
In the settlement,
she aot the house, the car...

783
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:55,601
...and custody of the children.

784
00:53:57,729 --> 00:53:59,321
Patti's pregnant.

785
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:01,879
I need work.

786
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:06,046
Sid! How are you, my friend?

787
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:09,122
What kind of roles you want
me to be looking for?

788
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:10,324
Anything.

789
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:14,406
I got a Westwood mortgage,
alimony, child support.

790
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:16,639
-I got a baby on the way.
-She got pregnant?

791
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:20,768
-I thought you said you had the....
-Vasectomy.

792
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,368
It leaks.

793
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,567
It leaks?

794
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:26,566
I need work.

795
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:29,402
I don't understand.
You were on Hoaan's for six years...

796
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:32,447
...the thing was a hit.
You didn't save any money?

797
00:54:36,009 --> 00:54:40,002
-This is not a good time for film roles.
-Bobby Darin!

798
00:54:40,169 --> 00:54:42,046
-Yeah?
-Bobby Darin gets film roles.

799
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:43,961
Well, he's married to Sandra Dee.

800
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:49,042
-You'd have to audition.
-Whatever it takes.

801
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,763
I just want to leave Hogan
and the leather jacket...

802
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:54,965
...behind me for once
and for all, you know?

803
00:54:55,169 --> 00:54:59,003
Accordina to The Washington Post, while
still in office as attorney aeneral...

804
00:54:59,169 --> 00:55:03,048
...John Mitchell had personally
controlled a secret Republican fund.

805
00:55:03,209 --> 00:55:05,677
Mitchell vehemently denied
any such involvement...

806
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:07,805
...and called the story ludicrous.

807
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:09,084
Vice President Aanew....

808
00:55:09,249 --> 00:55:10,967
Bob, you are not a failure.

809
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:16,439
This mortgage is eating me alive.
I'm drowning in debt.

810
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:20,882
You know, l've never gone this long,
ever, l mean, without work before.

811
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:22,880
I'll get that.

812
00:55:23,209 --> 00:55:24,801
Hello.

813
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:28,882
Yeah. Yeah, no,
l just got held up. Great.

814
00:55:29,049 --> 00:55:30,960
It's John, isn't it?

815
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:34,198
You said we were gonna
spend tonight together.

816
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:38,601
I know. I'm sorry, l'm sorry.
I just gotta get out. Okay?

817
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:44,719
This thinking and dwelling on my
problems, it's driving me crazy.

818
00:55:44,889 --> 00:55:47,642
-It's lonely in this house without you.
-I know. Listen.

819
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:50,846
Tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night, you and l, us.

820
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:54,007
Promise?

821
00:55:54,169 --> 00:55:56,319
-Promise?
-Promise!

822
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:59,879
Bad boy! Get out!

823
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:15,798
You know what time it is?

824
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:23,518
It's fuck time.

825
00:56:31,129 --> 00:56:33,882
Let's hear it for the
inimitable Miss Kitty!

826
00:56:34,049 --> 00:56:36,643
Now totally nude, yeah.

827
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:39,323
And once again, our old friend
Colonel Hogan.

828
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:42,722
Robert Crane. Thanks again, Bob.

829
00:56:42,889 --> 00:56:45,801
We're gonna take a little pause
for the cause. Back in 1 0.

830
00:56:46,209 --> 00:56:49,724
Well, l was in radio for 1 5 years.

831
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:52,483
Six years in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

832
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:56,085
Nine here in Los Angeles.
Six years on Hoaan's.

833
00:56:56,249 --> 00:57:00,401
Wow. That's 20 years of solid work.

834
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:03,638
Rotten to be out of work.

835
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:06,200
You've been bad.

836
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:07,563
Yes, l have.

837
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:12,524
I know what to do with boys like you.

838
00:57:17,049 --> 00:57:21,406
Stripping is a part-time thing for me.

839
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:24,367
Mostly, l'm a dominatrix.

840
00:57:26,689 --> 00:57:29,328
Here, l'm Melissa.

841
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:35,007
But my real self is Mistress Victoria.

842
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:40,325
-You, you--
-You will respect Mistress Victoria.

843
00:57:46,649 --> 00:57:48,082
You joking?

844
00:57:49,529 --> 00:57:51,804
You tell me.

845
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,727
It's hard to explain, Carp.

846
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,084
You ever been on a roller coaster?

847
00:57:58,249 --> 00:58:02,959
You know that feeling you get
when you take that first....

848
00:58:03,129 --> 00:58:06,360
-You know, that plunge?
-Yeah, sure.

849
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:10,205
Well, imagine getting off while
you're zooming straight down...

850
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:14,999
...and your heart is going,
you know, thump.

851
00:58:15,169 --> 00:58:18,047
Thump, thump. It's....

852
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:23,639
That's what it's like.
There's no way to compare it.

853
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:27,440
Wow.

854
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:32,039
It's dead air.

855
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,839
-What?
-Dead air.

856
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:38,368
It's the one thing
every disc jockey knows:

857
00:58:38,529 --> 00:58:40,599
Don't get stuck with dead air.

858
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:42,919
That's what l've got.

859
00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:46,365
I've worked and l've worked
and l got dead air.

860
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:48,766
I hate it.

861
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:55,880
Dinner theatre.

862
00:58:57,929 --> 00:59:00,318
-You're kidding.
-Why?

863
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:03,959
-You've done summer theatre.
-That was summer theatre!

864
00:59:04,129 --> 00:59:07,599
That was to keep busy, not something
to do during prime time.

865
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:10,488
Dick Van Dyke does dinner theatre.
And Jim Nabors--

866
00:59:10,689 --> 00:59:15,046
Maybe l need a new agent.
Maybe you're the problem.

867
00:59:19,449 --> 00:59:22,998
All right. Here's the phone.

868
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:26,721
Who do you want to call?
l've got all the numbers.

869
00:59:30,849 --> 00:59:32,328
Len, that's not what l meant.

870
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:35,959
I'm not the one coming here saying
he's going crazy without work.

871
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:38,165
I'm trying to help you.

872
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:45,084
Just keep trying.

873
00:59:46,289 --> 00:59:48,120
Something's gotta turn up.

874
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:50,923
-What the hell is that?
-Sounds like fire engines.

875
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:54,479
-Well, l know that.
-Oh, look, they're right on our street!

876
00:59:54,649 --> 00:59:58,324
My God! The building's on fire!

877
00:59:58,489 --> 01:00:00,957
And look at all the police cars
and photographers!

878
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:03,404
Photographers?

879
01:00:04,169 --> 01:00:05,807
It's okay.

880
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:10,527
Photographers? Oh, look,
and there's the mayor too.

881
01:00:10,689 --> 01:00:13,408
-Is my wife down there?
-What does she look like?

882
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:14,843
I can't remember.

883
01:00:15,009 --> 01:00:19,321
The play was called Beginner's Luck,
a sophisticated sex comedy.

884
01:00:19,489 --> 01:00:21,844
We played dinner theatres
around the country.

885
01:00:22,009 --> 01:00:24,569
Patti and l performed toaether,
but it became clear...

886
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:27,402
... that for Scotty's sake,
she should stay in Los Anaeles.

887
01:00:28,449 --> 01:00:30,167
-Scotty!
-Hey, hey, hey.

888
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:32,081
Wait. Hey, hey, hey!

889
01:00:33,209 --> 01:00:34,403
I got you.

890
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:36,446
Sure everything's gonna be all right?

891
01:00:36,609 --> 01:00:40,318
New actress comes in this afternoon.
She knows the role. We got four days.

892
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:42,764
All right with you.
You seem so tense lately.

893
01:00:42,929 --> 01:00:46,922
I'm carrying the whole production. I'm
directing, booking, working the crowd.

894
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:50,240
-You'll be home in three weeks, right?
-Unless they boo us off.

895
01:00:50,409 --> 01:00:53,082
-They love you, Bob!
-Honey?

896
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:56,924
-Oh, l'm sorry, baby.
-What are you doing?

897
01:00:57,089 --> 01:00:58,317
Come here.

898
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:00,838
Come on.

899
01:01:01,009 --> 01:01:03,523
Everybody loves you, Bob.

900
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:12,242
Pacific Southwest Airlines
fliaht 287...

901
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:17,005
... is now arrivina at aate 35
from Los Anaeles.

902
01:01:31,809 --> 01:01:34,198
-Hey!
-Big Daddy.

903
01:01:34,369 --> 01:01:36,929
-Voil!
-What is that?

904
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:38,966
Videocassette. It's brand-new.

905
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:42,041
It has the reel-to-reel
inside the casing.

906
01:01:42,209 --> 01:01:43,927
My God.

907
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:46,398
Any trouble with the luggage?

908
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:49,242
We're gonna need a sky cart.

909
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:52,521
That's just the thing. With women,
if they have a good sound--

910
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:54,202
-They love it.
-Patti loves it.

911
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:58,157
You know, we need a tape.
A music tape.

912
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:00,684
-Like a recording or something.
-Yeah, yeah.

913
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:03,522
-To get the chicks in the mood.
-That's a fabulous idea.

914
01:02:03,689 --> 01:02:04,289
It's a fabulous idea.

915
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:06,120
It's a fabulous idea.

916
01:02:23,169 --> 01:02:26,206
We have so much fun here.
We just love Columbus audiences.

917
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:29,884
We like after the show to take
a couple questions from the audience.

918
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:36,724
So let's start...

919
01:02:39,649 --> 01:02:41,048
...here.

920
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:57,239
You St. Louis audiences are
fantastic. I'd be happy to sign...

921
01:02:57,409 --> 01:03:00,401
...some autographs after the show.
I ask one thing:

922
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:03,641
Don't throw them out
while l'm still present.

923
01:03:14,889 --> 01:03:16,845
What do y'all do for fun in Dallas?

924
01:03:17,049 --> 01:03:21,167
I hear the place to be on a Thursday
night is a club called Lucky's.

925
01:03:28,169 --> 01:03:32,481
So l guess that's where you'll find
me and some of the crew tonight.

926
01:03:32,649 --> 01:03:35,004
If you're looking for company.

927
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:38,127
Over here! Over here!

928
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:43,165
-You all right?
-Yeah.

929
01:03:43,329 --> 01:03:44,887
Hey, Bob! Bob!

930
01:03:45,049 --> 01:03:46,004
Yeah?

931
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:48,046
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

932
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:03,929
-Carpy?
-Sleeping Beauty.

933
01:04:03,929 --> 01:04:04,600
-Carpy?
-Sleeping Beauty.

934
01:04:04,769 --> 01:04:06,521
Where you been?

935
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:12,161
While you were catching Z's,
l, your loyal musketeer...

936
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:14,843
...was out at the porn theatre...

937
01:04:15,009 --> 01:04:19,366
...shooting a copy of Deep Throat
off the screen.

938
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:22,202
-You can do that?
-I had to use your name.

939
01:04:22,369 --> 01:04:25,725
I picked up some swing magazines.
This is a big town for swinging.

940
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:27,885
-We should just do it.
-What?

941
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:31,439
Just make a big-budget sex film.

942
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:36,922
You know?
Get some big star, like....

943
01:04:37,089 --> 01:04:39,478
-Stella Stevens.
-She'd never do it.

944
01:04:39,649 --> 01:04:41,879
Oh, hell yeah. Yeah, Carp.
Oh, yeah.

945
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:44,438
If you pay her enough.
She's an actress!

946
01:04:45,689 --> 01:04:49,398
Wow. You could charge, like,
1 0 bucks for something like that.

947
01:04:50,209 --> 01:04:52,598
Hey. Look at this.

948
01:04:52,769 --> 01:04:54,202
Look at my dick.

949
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:57,806
-Look at my dick.
-I've seen your dick before.

950
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:00,606
Look closer.

951
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:03,727
-I don't want to look closer.
-Look, damn it!

952
01:05:07,009 --> 01:05:09,204
See anything different?

953
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:12,519
What am l supposed to say,
it's bigger?

954
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:14,843
Is it?

955
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:20,606
Wow. You did it, didn't you?

956
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:23,960
Last time l was in L.A.
A " penile enhancement."

957
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,644
Wow! lt's thicker!
How much did it cost?

958
01:05:27,809 --> 01:05:31,358
If you're gonna be in the movies,
gotta do what you gotta do.

959
01:05:31,529 --> 01:05:35,488
-Hey, a day without sex....
-Is a day wasted.

960
01:05:35,649 --> 01:05:38,607
Bob Crane. Hey, Lenny.

961
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:40,487
You're kidding me.

962
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:42,526
Run it by me again?

963
01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:46,484
That-- No, no, no, no, that's--

964
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:47,917
That's great.

965
01:05:48,089 --> 01:05:50,649
Disney's offering me a movie.
Superdad.

966
01:05:51,689 --> 01:05:54,726
No, no, no, no. Just tell them
l got some commitments.

967
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:58,165
Don't blow this, Lenny.
Don't blow it. I want this job.

968
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,524
I need this job, okay?

969
01:06:00,689 --> 01:06:03,123
No, it's fabulous! Yeah.

970
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:05,803
I'll call you later. Yeah.

971
01:06:09,529 --> 01:06:12,248
Guess who's playing Superdad?

972
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,966
Me.

973
01:06:16,089 --> 01:06:19,001
So much for our big plans.

974
01:06:21,249 --> 01:06:24,719
Don't give me that look.
This is good for both of us.

975
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:29,480
-Oh, is it?
-Yeah. I'm back in play again.

976
01:06:29,649 --> 01:06:31,162
The big time.

977
01:06:31,849 --> 01:06:33,726
-Sweets. How are you?
-I'm fine.

978
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:34,924
Schmile.

979
01:06:35,089 --> 01:06:36,442
-Let's pull it around.
-Easy.

980
01:06:36,609 --> 01:06:37,883
-Lenny!
-Hey.

981
01:06:38,049 --> 01:06:40,119
You came by.

982
01:06:40,649 --> 01:06:42,526
It's 20 minutes.

983
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:46,125
They're turning around the lights.
You want to go in my trailer?

984
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:51,963
I got a call from Disney.

985
01:06:52,129 --> 01:06:54,597
Apparently some joker
from the Enquirer...

986
01:06:54,769 --> 01:06:57,920
...took pictures of you
in a topless bar.

987
01:07:01,089 --> 01:07:04,445
Bob, this is Disney.
Don't fucking blow this.

988
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:09,046
I'm a family man. One woman man.
Always have been.

989
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:12,608
What about the photo albums?

990
01:07:13,089 --> 01:07:14,807
Those pictures you show people.

991
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:18,006
You know, not everyone thinks
about things the way you do.

992
01:07:18,169 --> 01:07:20,842
Turns people off.
And word gets around, believe me.

993
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:23,887
-Who'd l show them to?
-You show them to everybody.

994
01:07:24,049 --> 01:07:26,688
Don't be a square.

995
01:07:27,329 --> 01:07:31,163
Is it true you showed them to
Donna Reed and she ran out?

996
01:07:32,169 --> 01:07:35,366
I may be horny, but l'm not stupid.

997
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:37,679
There could be a very
serious conflict here...

998
01:07:37,849 --> 01:07:42,684
...between your lifestyle and
your career. You don't see this?

999
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:44,248
I'm normal.

1000
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:46,848
Sex is not the answer.

1001
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:51,127
I know that, Lenny, it's the question.
"Yes" is the answer.

1002
01:07:51,329 --> 01:07:53,206
I'm just saying.

1003
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,918
Just try to be a little discreet.
All right?

1004
01:07:58,529 --> 01:07:59,803
Come in for a minute.

1005
01:07:59,969 --> 01:08:03,678
-I gotta get back to the office.
-Well, call me!

1006
01:08:07,769 --> 01:08:09,805
This is it.

1007
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:12,639
Here we are.

1008
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:14,848
Batman and Robin.

1009
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:17,965
Lone Ranger and Tonto.

1010
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:22,046
Hi-yo, Silver. Away!

1011
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:26,562
-Come on in, guys. Join the party!
-Hey, what's going on?

1012
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:29,607
-Janet! Janet!
-What's coming off?

1013
01:08:29,769 --> 01:08:31,646
What's going down?

1014
01:08:32,089 --> 01:08:34,683
All your life you're the lucky auy.
The funny auy.

1015
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:37,408
Then one day it all turns.

1016
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:40,129
The jokes aren't funny,
the phone doesn't rina.

1017
01:08:40,289 --> 01:08:42,757
You're the same, but nothina else is.

1018
01:08:42,929 --> 01:08:45,204
Superdad sat on the shelf
for a year...

1019
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:46,848
... then flopped.

1020
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:49,921
I had to bea Disney
for a cameo in another film...

1021
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:54,128
...Gus, about a donkey
who kicked field aoals.

1022
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:59,238
What do they want from me?
l don't drink. I don't smoke.

1023
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:02,048
Two out of three ain't bad.

1024
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:09,242
Honey?

1025
01:09:09,569 --> 01:09:11,560
Gotta go back on the road.

1026
01:09:11,769 --> 01:09:14,203
Bob, you're never home anymore.

1027
01:09:14,369 --> 01:09:17,566
You think dinner theatre
makes me happy?

1028
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:21,199
How do you think l feel having to do
dinner theatre to pay the bills?

1029
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:24,679
Gee, l wouldn't know.
I'm just a housewife.

1030
01:09:24,849 --> 01:09:26,805
Well, maybe you need a new hobby.

1031
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:29,045
You thought about that?

1032
01:09:31,169 --> 01:09:34,684
Maybe l need a new husband.

1033
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:38,398
Hey, everything l do is for you
and Scotty. Come on.

1034
01:09:38,569 --> 01:09:42,323
The house, the furniture,
the Caddy that you drive.

1035
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:45,081
I just want someone here.

1036
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:48,080
You're never home anymore.

1037
01:09:48,249 --> 01:09:52,208
And when you are, you're
downstairs editing your videos!

1038
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:56,447
You want me to cancel my next
engagement? Just cancel it?

1039
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,726
I can't. It's a contract!

1040
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:02,518
Marriage is a contract.

1041
01:10:04,049 --> 01:10:07,121
Maybe we should just
cancel that too.

1042
01:10:11,049 --> 01:10:12,198
I booked Wichita.

1043
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:18,164
Is that thina on?

1044
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:21,242
Oh, yeah. Want me to turn it off?

1045
01:10:21,409 --> 01:10:24,481
-Happy now?
-Yeah.

1046
01:10:49,569 --> 01:10:51,480
Bob?

1047
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:02,685
Bob?

1048
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:14,728
Hey, Big Daddy!

1049
01:11:14,889 --> 01:11:16,208
Carpy. You want a drink?

1050
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:19,441
Look what l got you. It's a timer.

1051
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,248
Now we can put on the recorder
whenever we want...

1052
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:24,798
-...tape shows right off the TV.
-That's fantastic.

1053
01:11:24,969 --> 01:11:27,483
Like if you want to watch
Johnny Carson at 1 1 :30...

1054
01:11:27,649 --> 01:11:30,482
...and we're out hunting chicks,
we set the timer. Boom.

1055
01:11:30,649 --> 01:11:32,560
We watch it in the morning.

1056
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:35,607
I'm gonna need a minute to
wrap my mind around that idea.

1057
01:11:35,769 --> 01:11:39,125
-Pretty groovy, huh?
-Yeah.

1058
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:43,887
You okay? You look kind of blue.

1059
01:11:44,529 --> 01:11:47,601
Just Patti and l
having some problems.

1060
01:11:48,529 --> 01:11:51,441
Had to cancel the Wichita gig.

1061
01:11:51,609 --> 01:11:53,964
I thought you had
an arrangement with her.

1062
01:11:54,129 --> 01:11:56,927
-You know how women are.
-Yeah.

1063
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:01,641
You got the right idea, really.

1064
01:12:02,049 --> 01:12:04,609
Live separately.

1065
01:12:05,049 --> 01:12:08,041
I'd miss her and Scotty too much.

1066
01:12:14,169 --> 01:12:16,763
This is making me hot.

1067
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:19,803
-What's her name again?
-I'm not sure.

1068
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,278
Could look it up in my records.

1069
01:12:22,569 --> 01:12:25,083
I've got all this stuff.

1070
01:12:25,569 --> 01:12:29,164
The bush on her. Wouldn't go
near that without a flashlight.

1071
01:12:30,369 --> 01:12:32,325
I did.

1072
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:38,162
What is it about women, Carpy?
They tell you one thing...

1073
01:12:38,329 --> 01:12:40,923
...then they get you and
they change their minds. It's....

1074
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:43,284
Can't live with 'em,
can't live without 'em.

1075
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,639
You know, truer words
were never spoken.

1076
01:12:45,849 --> 01:12:47,487
Can't live with 'em....

1077
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:50,209
Can't kill 'em.

1078
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:53,725
I think this is Seattle.

1079
01:12:53,929 --> 01:12:56,762
No. Dallas.

1080
01:12:57,049 --> 01:12:59,802
Look at the dcor.
The Western picture.

1081
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:03,321
Tits on her.

1082
01:13:03,809 --> 01:13:05,401
Yeah.

1083
01:13:15,009 --> 01:13:17,842
My God, the building's on fire!

1084
01:13:18,249 --> 01:13:20,683
Look at all those police cars
and photographers!

1085
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:23,488
Photographers? Oh, my God,
the mayor's there too!

1086
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,368
-Do you see my wife out there?
-What does she look like?

1087
01:13:26,529 --> 01:13:28,247
I don't remember!

1088
01:13:28,449 --> 01:13:30,201
Carpy?

1089
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:32,599
Yeah?

1090
01:13:32,769 --> 01:13:36,603
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's great up here.

1091
01:13:36,769 --> 01:13:38,964
Last night? Zilch.

1092
01:13:39,129 --> 01:13:42,405
But there's actually a story there.
A society babe.

1093
01:13:42,569 --> 01:13:44,480
I did her friend.

1094
01:13:44,649 --> 01:13:48,642
She was all hot to go and then
she got the heebie-jeebies.

1095
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:51,008
When are you coming out?

1096
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:02,728
Excuse me.

1097
01:14:02,889 --> 01:14:06,848
Mind switching that to channel nine?
l want to check something out.

1098
01:14:20,609 --> 01:14:24,397
That's the guy from that TV show.
Look, there he is--

1099
01:14:24,609 --> 01:14:27,965
I'm going to talk to him. Watch.

1100
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:38,966
-Hi.
-Hi.

1101
01:14:39,169 --> 01:14:41,558
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was sitting over there...

1102
01:14:41,729 --> 01:14:44,721
...and l noticed the TV and l--
Well, is that you?

1103
01:14:44,929 --> 01:14:48,285
-On the TV, is that...?
-Oh, my gosh!

1104
01:14:48,449 --> 01:14:51,805
That is embarrassing. I didn't even
know it was on. I'm Bob Crane.

1105
01:14:51,969 --> 01:14:53,288
I know. I thought so.

1106
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:55,485
Bob Crane.
Gosh, it's nice to meet you.

1107
01:14:55,649 --> 01:14:57,367
-Nice to meet you too....
-Susan.

1108
01:14:57,529 --> 01:14:59,997
-Susan. All right.
-I loved your TV show.

1109
01:15:00,169 --> 01:15:03,798
I appreciate that. I'm just in town
here to do a little bit of theatre.

1110
01:15:03,969 --> 01:15:06,722
-I just wanted to say hi.
-Sure. Can l get you something?

1111
01:15:06,889 --> 01:15:09,961
Another drink? An autograph?
A nude swim?

1112
01:15:10,129 --> 01:15:11,448
Bob!

1113
01:15:11,609 --> 01:15:15,079
You know, l'm a real photo nut.
How long are you girls in town?

1114
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:19,159
Carp. Look at this.

1115
01:15:19,329 --> 01:15:20,728
You want a club sandwich?

1116
01:15:20,889 --> 01:15:25,087
This editing hookup's fantastic. I can
even cut together cartoons for Scotty.

1117
01:15:25,489 --> 01:15:28,561
No, l'm not hungry. Watch this.

1118
01:15:29,449 --> 01:15:31,167
Here's Bobby!

1119
01:15:32,169 --> 01:15:36,128
On The Morning Show
with us today, Bob Crane.

1120
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:40,726
-Hey. You made this?
-Yeah, with your equipment!

1121
01:15:40,889 --> 01:15:44,518
It's like the old stuff
we used to do back in radio.

1122
01:15:44,729 --> 01:15:48,039
Know how sometimes you put a flub
in the show? Audiences crack up.

1123
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:49,238
It's so funny.

1124
01:15:49,409 --> 01:15:52,287
The girls, sometimes they're
uncomfortable with the video.

1125
01:15:52,449 --> 01:15:56,237
Now we show them an edit,
get them laughing and boom!

1126
01:15:56,409 --> 01:15:58,877
They love sex. They're just
looking for an excuse.

1127
01:15:59,049 --> 01:16:01,483
-You want something to drink?
-Women should have...

1128
01:16:01,649 --> 01:16:04,322
...a letter from the pope,
says, " lf l sleep with you...

1129
01:16:04,489 --> 01:16:07,447
...my boyfriend won't come after you."
Know what l mean?

1130
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:10,646
-I talked to Nick Murphy in Houston.
-Yeah, how'd that go?

1131
01:16:10,809 --> 01:16:15,246
We're all set for Monday night with the
swinging thing. You know, it's strange.

1132
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:17,684
Dallas is a great town for babes.

1133
01:16:18,729 --> 01:16:20,765
But for swinging, nothing.

1134
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:25,487
You know what's a great city for
dominance? Atlanta. Don't ask me why.

1135
01:16:25,649 --> 01:16:27,924
I made this for you.

1136
01:16:33,009 --> 01:16:34,044
That's good.

1137
01:16:36,329 --> 01:16:39,082
Simply scrumptious!

1138
01:16:47,409 --> 01:16:51,448
It's not very nice to try
and trick Mother Nature.

1139
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:52,837
That's not funny, Bob.

1140
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:54,761
Carp, come on!

1141
01:16:56,409 --> 01:16:58,877
Don't tell me funny. I know funny...

1142
01:16:59,049 --> 01:17:00,846
-...and that's funny!
-No, it's not.

1143
01:17:01,009 --> 01:17:04,046
It's fucking Lauah-ln!
That's Rowan and Martin.

1144
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:07,281
-After all l've done for you.
-What do you mean?

1145
01:17:07,449 --> 01:17:09,565
The equipment,
coming when you called...

1146
01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:12,448
...running errands,
setting up the swinging parties--

1147
01:17:12,609 --> 01:17:16,443
Do you hear yourself? What are
you--? All you've done for me?

1148
01:17:16,609 --> 01:17:20,397
What are you talking about? How the
fuck do you think you get these broads?

1149
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:25,563
You think you show up and say,
" Hey, l'm John Carpenter. Fuck me."

1150
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:30,604
They're with you because of me. They
don't want you, they want Bob Crane.

1151
01:17:30,769 --> 01:17:36,366
So if you don't mind, please lay off
the "all l've done for you" speech.

1152
01:17:53,489 --> 01:17:55,127
-Mr. Crane?
-Oh, yeah!

1153
01:17:55,289 --> 01:17:59,328
-Hey, Mr. Crane!
-Do you want an autograph?

1154
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:02,405
You've been served.

1155
01:18:06,609 --> 01:18:11,160
Welcome to Celebrity Cooks.
My name is Bruno Gerussi.

1156
01:18:11,329 --> 01:18:17,086
Today we'll be cooking with Colonel
Hogan himself, Mr. Bob Crane!

1157
01:18:23,009 --> 01:18:25,762
Thanks, Bruno.
It's a pleasure to be here.

1158
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:30,008
Wonderful to see you.
Now, what has Hogan been up to?

1159
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:35,118
Pretty much the same old thing. Still
trying to pull the wool over Klink's eyes.

1160
01:18:35,329 --> 01:18:37,320
And trying to get into Hilda's pants.

1161
01:18:37,489 --> 01:18:40,640
Actually, l did get into her pants,
l married her. But....

1162
01:18:40,809 --> 01:18:45,166
Now she's divorcing me,
so that's not worked out.

1163
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:47,843
But l will be next month
in Long Beach...

1164
01:18:48,009 --> 01:18:50,364
...performing a show called
Beainner's Luck.

1165
01:18:50,529 --> 01:18:54,920
Wonderful! So, Bob, what recipe
have you brought us today?

1166
01:18:55,129 --> 01:18:58,519
It is a pasta dish.

1167
01:18:58,689 --> 01:19:04,286
With chicken and fettuccine,
they tell me.

1168
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:06,917
I don't-- That's what they
told me to say, anyway.

1169
01:19:07,089 --> 01:19:08,158
Sounds delicious.

1170
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:11,918
You got a balloon-smuggler
here in the audience today.

1171
01:19:12,129 --> 01:19:14,484
You got a license
to carry those things?

1172
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:18,961
Little tip on how to remove the wrinkles
from your face: Take off your bra.

1173
01:19:21,729 --> 01:19:25,165
Calm down.
Boo! Calm down.

1174
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:29,726
They'll cut all this stuff out. They
edit it and they take all this stuff out.

1175
01:19:29,889 --> 01:19:33,438
Nice enough girl till she figured out
the fuzzy thing she's sitting on...

1176
01:19:33,609 --> 01:19:35,964
-...could make her some money.
-You all right?

1177
01:19:36,129 --> 01:19:41,123
I'm fine. It's actually called a Chicken
Fettuccine  la Crane, is my dish.

1178
01:19:41,289 --> 01:19:43,598
-We can take a break if you want.
-No, l'm fine.

1179
01:19:43,769 --> 01:19:47,728
I'm a complete professional. I just can't
get over the size of those knockers.

1180
01:19:47,969 --> 01:19:50,358
-Look, here come the ingredients now.
-Yes!

1181
01:19:50,529 --> 01:19:52,440
Wonderful.

1182
01:19:52,849 --> 01:19:54,885
The noodles!

1183
01:20:02,369 --> 01:20:04,121
Bob.

1184
01:20:04,289 --> 01:20:08,077
You surprised me. Come in.
Close the door, will you?

1185
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:10,920
Sit.

1186
01:20:13,449 --> 01:20:15,440
You need anything?

1187
01:20:16,929 --> 01:20:18,726
Sit.

1188
01:20:19,009 --> 01:20:23,924
So, what's on your mind?

1189
01:20:24,089 --> 01:20:26,557
Just passing through.

1190
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:30,325
Some things never change.

1191
01:20:30,529 --> 01:20:34,761
How's the theatre? Our--
The boys are helping you, right?

1192
01:20:34,929 --> 01:20:38,922
-I got eight months lined up, thank you.
-That's a nice little moneymaker.

1193
01:20:39,409 --> 01:20:41,525
You should know.

1194
01:20:44,129 --> 01:20:46,245
How's the family? The kids all right?

1195
01:20:47,169 --> 01:20:49,637
-Patti and l broke up.
-Yeah, l heard.

1196
01:20:49,809 --> 01:20:51,447
She hates me.

1197
01:20:51,849 --> 01:20:54,568
And she threw stuff at me.

1198
01:20:54,929 --> 01:20:59,764
Ashtrays, a videocassette. She cut
my lip here. I had to have stitches.

1199
01:21:02,289 --> 01:21:04,757
I was wondering if you'd
set some meetings up.

1200
01:21:05,209 --> 01:21:07,882
Get in circulation. A game show.

1201
01:21:08,609 --> 01:21:11,169
Do you remember the reaction
l got on Password?

1202
01:21:11,329 --> 01:21:14,048
I know Password is, you know,
not on the air anymore...

1203
01:21:14,209 --> 01:21:17,121
...but maybe Hollywood Squares.
You know? Something just to...

1204
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:21,646
...get into the public's eye.
Don't look like that. Hey!

1205
01:21:21,809 --> 01:21:24,403
I'm not talking about
Paul Lynde's square.

1206
01:21:24,569 --> 01:21:27,003
-Any square is fine.
-We've talked about this.

1207
01:21:27,169 --> 01:21:29,125
The image problem.

1208
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:33,760
If l sent you out again, l'd have to be
able to tell people you're a new man.

1209
01:21:34,449 --> 01:21:37,168
Well, tell them sex is normal.

1210
01:21:38,449 --> 01:21:43,284
It's good for you. I'm normal.
People got these hang-ups.

1211
01:21:47,049 --> 01:21:51,327
Do you know that there's actually
people out there who avoid me now?

1212
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:54,081
This is a nice one.

1213
01:21:54,689 --> 01:21:56,407
I'm the friendly guy.

1214
01:21:56,569 --> 01:21:59,959
I'm the mediator.
My brother and father....

1215
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:04,006
Goddamn, they hated each other.
You know?

1216
01:22:05,729 --> 01:22:09,165
-I'm the good son.
-Hey, l'm not a counsellor.

1217
01:22:11,929 --> 01:22:15,638
I'm feeling very awkward
being put in this situation.

1218
01:22:21,089 --> 01:22:22,841
There's one thing l know.

1219
01:22:23,009 --> 01:22:26,001
Bob, people don't change
unless they want to.

1220
01:22:28,369 --> 01:22:29,961
I want to.

1221
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:33,321
A drunk can't get sober and hang
around his old drinking buddies.

1222
01:22:33,489 --> 01:22:35,639
It doesn't work that way, kid.

1223
01:22:40,009 --> 01:22:40,998
Excuse me.

1224
01:22:41,609 --> 01:22:43,281
-Yeah.
-Your 4.:00 is here.

1225
01:22:43,449 --> 01:22:45,087
Tell him to wait.

1226
01:22:51,649 --> 01:22:54,766
-You got meetings.
-No! No hurry. Sit down.

1227
01:22:54,929 --> 01:22:56,601
I gotta go anyway.

1228
01:22:57,009 --> 01:22:59,569
Come here.
I want you to know something.

1229
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:03,483
I'm here for you, and l want
to help you. You understand?

1230
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:06,198
Yes. I'll call you.

1231
01:23:07,609 --> 01:23:10,646
Good luck, kid.
Beginner's luck, right?

1232
01:23:25,369 --> 01:23:26,597
Bobby!

1233
01:23:28,009 --> 01:23:29,237
Dad?

1234
01:23:32,009 --> 01:23:33,522
How you doing?

1235
01:23:33,729 --> 01:23:35,765
-What's up?
-Hello, Mr. Crane.

1236
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:39,922
I'll be inside.

1237
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:43,126
Wow, she's built.

1238
01:23:52,289 --> 01:23:54,245
How you doing?

1239
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:57,606
-Pretty good. What's up?
-What have you been up to?

1240
01:23:58,929 --> 01:24:00,760
-Nothing much.
-Yeah?

1241
01:24:02,649 --> 01:24:05,846
Patti and l are getting a divorce.

1242
01:24:06,009 --> 01:24:09,240
-She's busting my balls.
-Really, l don't want to get into it.

1243
01:24:09,409 --> 01:24:11,479
I didn't want you to hear
about it the wrong way.

1244
01:24:11,649 --> 01:24:13,162
Right.

1245
01:24:13,329 --> 01:24:16,446
I tried to call your mom.

1246
01:24:16,609 --> 01:24:19,487
Well, she never says
anything bad about you.

1247
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:24,767
How you doing? You okay?

1248
01:24:27,089 --> 01:24:29,398
Where you working now?

1249
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:32,561
Well, we're going
back down to Long Beach.

1250
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,127
Then we go up to Seattle.

1251
01:24:35,289 --> 01:24:38,326
And down to Scottsdale.

1252
01:24:38,969 --> 01:24:41,403
Scottsdale, Arizona.

1253
01:24:43,649 --> 01:24:46,800
I was thinking about
orange the other day.

1254
01:24:47,729 --> 01:24:48,764
The colour.

1255
01:24:49,609 --> 01:24:51,804
You take it for granted, right?

1256
01:24:52,609 --> 01:24:54,804
The colour orange.
But what is it, really?

1257
01:24:54,969 --> 01:24:56,880
-The colour?
-Yeah.

1258
01:25:00,089 --> 01:25:03,126
But that's it. Just tell me,
what is orange?

1259
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:10,842
-I don't know.
-That's my point. You take it for granted.

1260
01:25:11,009 --> 01:25:13,648
You don't think about stuff like that.

1261
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:15,561
It's just there.

1262
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:19,925
Did John get you
that camera stuff you wanted?

1263
01:25:20,769 --> 01:25:21,963
Yeah.

1264
01:25:25,089 --> 01:25:26,522
Yeah, finally.

1265
01:25:27,849 --> 01:25:31,637
-He can be a real drag.
-Yeah, Mom thinks he's a creep.

1266
01:25:31,809 --> 01:25:33,003
Yeah.

1267
01:25:34,489 --> 01:25:36,002
We'll see.

1268
01:25:37,249 --> 01:25:39,604
We'll see.
Gotta make some changes.

1269
01:25:41,649 --> 01:25:42,877
Anne.

1270
01:25:43,769 --> 01:25:46,283
No, no, don't hang up.

1271
01:25:47,009 --> 01:25:50,240
What do you mean, Debbie
doesn't come to the phone?

1272
01:25:53,129 --> 01:25:56,121
I ran into Bobby the other day.

1273
01:25:56,969 --> 01:25:58,925
I wanted to tell you.

1274
01:26:00,449 --> 01:26:02,360
No, no, hey-- Hey.

1275
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:03,882
Annie?

1276
01:26:04,809 --> 01:26:06,481
Annie?

1277
01:26:07,569 --> 01:26:08,558
Annie!

1278
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:11,527
Patti, it's an hour earlier in L.A.

1279
01:26:12,609 --> 01:26:13,837
It is.

1280
01:26:16,969 --> 01:26:21,565
I'm so sorry about what happened
with Scotty's drawings at school, but--

1281
01:26:22,809 --> 01:26:23,798
No--

1282
01:26:26,289 --> 01:26:28,598
I've agreed to the counselling.

1283
01:26:31,049 --> 01:26:34,086
I'm offering you 50l50!

1284
01:26:34,249 --> 01:26:38,367
That's fair. That's--
That's more than fair.

1285
01:26:38,529 --> 01:26:40,520
I'm trying to be decent.

1286
01:26:41,689 --> 01:26:44,283
Well, l don't have that much money!

1287
01:26:44,929 --> 01:26:47,318
And don't call me
in my dressing room anymore.

1288
01:26:47,489 --> 01:26:50,367
That is where l prepare.

1289
01:26:52,769 --> 01:26:54,680
I'm sorry, l'm sorry.

1290
01:26:58,049 --> 01:26:59,482
Patti?

1291
01:27:01,689 --> 01:27:03,805
Okay, we'll talk then.

1292
01:27:11,649 --> 01:27:15,198
Back straight. Chest up.

1293
01:27:15,369 --> 01:27:17,803
Chin up. Smile.

1294
01:27:20,049 --> 01:27:22,358
"Your drink, key-holder."

1295
01:27:23,969 --> 01:27:26,722
-How's your room?
-It's okay.

1296
01:27:26,889 --> 01:27:29,244
I'm at the Sunburst.

1297
01:27:31,049 --> 01:27:33,324
How are rehearsals going?

1298
01:27:34,409 --> 01:27:36,161
That bitch.

1299
01:27:37,569 --> 01:27:38,922
What's wrong?

1300
01:27:40,449 --> 01:27:44,283
Why did l get married, Carp?
Once, you can understand.

1301
01:27:44,449 --> 01:27:46,838
I got married twice.

1302
01:27:48,449 --> 01:27:50,519
Patti showed up with Scotty.

1303
01:27:50,689 --> 01:27:52,042
-Yeah?
-No warning.

1304
01:27:52,209 --> 01:27:54,518
Just popped in town
to fuck with Bob's head.

1305
01:27:54,689 --> 01:27:55,963
My lawyer called.

1306
01:27:56,129 --> 01:28:01,362
She told him that Scotty has written
" Fuck Daddy" on a wall somewhere.

1307
01:28:01,529 --> 01:28:05,966
In the divorce papers, she says
that l showed him X-rated videos.

1308
01:28:07,009 --> 01:28:08,408
Did you?

1309
01:28:09,249 --> 01:28:12,002
I was editing.
He might've seen something.

1310
01:28:12,169 --> 01:28:15,127
It's how it looks, John, you know?

1311
01:28:15,489 --> 01:28:18,049
-To the press.
-Right.

1312
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:22,843
You can't give people a chance...

1313
01:28:24,089 --> 01:28:25,602
...to put you down.

1314
01:28:25,769 --> 01:28:28,363
-You know what l'm saying?
-I do.

1315
01:28:29,569 --> 01:28:30,922
You know...

1316
01:28:32,609 --> 01:28:34,600
...maybe you should go back to radio.

1317
01:28:34,769 --> 01:28:37,522
-You love radio.
-You heard radio lately?

1318
01:28:37,809 --> 01:28:40,721
It's attacks on the president of the U.S.
Jokes.

1319
01:28:40,889 --> 01:28:43,642
-Yeah.
-Filthy jokes. They're very dirty.

1320
01:28:43,809 --> 01:28:48,041
-Rock. It's not my bag.
-You know, l'm just trying to help, Bob.

1321
01:28:48,209 --> 01:28:49,722
I'm your friend.

1322
01:28:53,129 --> 01:28:55,518
You're my only friend, John.

1323
01:29:01,849 --> 01:29:03,521
What time is it?

1324
01:29:04,769 --> 01:29:06,566
It's 7:30.

1325
01:29:06,729 --> 01:29:09,766
-We should go.
-I gotta change. Where we going?

1326
01:29:10,369 --> 01:29:11,961
Surf or turf?

1327
01:29:12,569 --> 01:29:13,888
Surf...

1328
01:29:14,049 --> 01:29:16,438
...and turf! Come on!

1329
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:19,480
Yeah, Big Daddy.

1330
01:29:32,209 --> 01:29:33,801
Carpy?

1331
01:29:48,729 --> 01:29:50,208
John?

1332
01:29:59,409 --> 01:30:00,808
That you?

1333
01:30:09,929 --> 01:30:13,365
Word is, colonel, there's
aoina to be a surprise inspection.

1334
01:30:13,529 --> 01:30:16,919
I don't know about you, but if
there's aonna be an inspection...

1335
01:30:17,089 --> 01:30:19,728
...l aot thinas to hide.

1336
01:30:24,609 --> 01:30:27,248
My God, the building's on fire!

1337
01:30:27,409 --> 01:30:30,367
Look at all those police cars
and photographers.

1338
01:30:30,529 --> 01:30:31,803
Photographers?

1339
01:30:31,969 --> 01:30:33,925
Oh, my God, there's the mayor too!

1340
01:30:34,089 --> 01:30:35,761
Is my wife down there?

1341
01:30:35,929 --> 01:30:37,760
What does she look like?

1342
01:30:37,929 --> 01:30:40,045
I don't remember!

1343
01:30:47,169 --> 01:30:50,479
She's a fox.
Look at the caboose on her.

1344
01:30:54,009 --> 01:30:55,488
A day without sex...

1345
01:30:55,649 --> 01:30:58,117
-...is a day wasted.
-Is a day wasted. Yeah.

1346
01:30:59,769 --> 01:31:01,487
This place is dead.

1347
01:31:01,649 --> 01:31:04,482
Well, we still got time
to hit a strip joint.

1348
01:31:05,929 --> 01:31:07,806
Yeah, we need to talk.

1349
01:31:08,609 --> 01:31:10,679
I don't like the sound of that.

1350
01:31:10,849 --> 01:31:14,398
That's what a chick says
when she's gonna lower the boom.

1351
01:31:16,769 --> 01:31:18,646
Thinking about getting out.

1352
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:21,802
Of what?

1353
01:31:23,249 --> 01:31:24,682
Whole scene.

1354
01:31:24,889 --> 01:31:27,323
-Whole what scene?
-The dinner theatre.

1355
01:31:27,489 --> 01:31:30,049
-All the rest.
-Excuse me. I'm confused.

1356
01:31:30,209 --> 01:31:33,724
The road. The hustling.
The broads. The whole thing.

1357
01:31:33,889 --> 01:31:36,608
You mean me.
I'm part of the whole thing?

1358
01:31:36,769 --> 01:31:41,445
Well, without the dinner theatre,
we'd see each other less.

1359
01:31:41,609 --> 01:31:44,077
I want to restart my career.

1360
01:31:44,809 --> 01:31:46,800
You're kidding, right?

1361
01:31:50,209 --> 01:31:53,042
-Well, what about my equipment?
-Good news.

1362
01:31:53,209 --> 01:31:55,803
You can keep it. I'll buy my own.

1363
01:31:55,969 --> 01:31:58,802
You're gonna buy a Betacam, right?

1364
01:31:58,969 --> 01:32:02,279
Nobody needs John Carpenter.
You just buy a Betacam.

1365
01:32:02,449 --> 01:32:05,885
Tommy Smothers bought Betacam.
Dick Martin. And now you.

1366
01:32:06,049 --> 01:32:08,279
-What about me?
-You'll be okay.

1367
01:32:08,449 --> 01:32:12,283
We got a good thing going,
Big Daddy. Why ruin it?

1368
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:14,519
You'll be all right.

1369
01:32:15,289 --> 01:32:17,325
I see. I'm like Anne and Patti.

1370
01:32:17,489 --> 01:32:19,445
You find a better deal,
and dump me.

1371
01:32:19,609 --> 01:32:22,362
I'm sick of scoring broads
for you, okay?

1372
01:32:23,929 --> 01:32:26,727
There. I said it.

1373
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:29,528
What am l, a drag?
A drag on your career?

1374
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:33,398
Who's always been there for you?
When you were moping?

1375
01:32:33,569 --> 01:32:36,527
"Oh, John, John,
nobody wants to hire me!"

1376
01:32:36,689 --> 01:32:38,202
Flying around the country.

1377
01:32:38,369 --> 01:32:40,564
Hauling your shit from the airport.
Taking seconds!

1378
01:32:40,729 --> 01:32:44,199
I'm a drag? Well,
you're a fucking loser.

1379
01:32:44,369 --> 01:32:46,883
-Bob Crane's a loser!
-I ain't a loser!

1380
01:32:47,809 --> 01:32:50,607
Bob Crane ain't a loser.
You brought Bob Crane down!

1381
01:32:50,769 --> 01:32:54,239
-Bob Crane is a good guy!
-Bob, let's not do this.

1382
01:32:54,409 --> 01:32:55,922
Please.

1383
01:32:56,289 --> 01:32:59,326
John, you're my friend.

1384
01:33:00,369 --> 01:33:01,643
Okay?

1385
01:33:02,609 --> 01:33:05,077
You'll always be my friend.

1386
01:33:08,489 --> 01:33:12,801
Shit. I'm supposed to call Carolyn.
About the Jacuzzi party.

1387
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:40,520
-Hello?
-Hey, it's John.

1388
01:33:40,689 --> 01:33:42,407
-How's it going?
-All riaht.

1389
01:33:42,569 --> 01:33:43,638
-You alone?
-Yeah.

1390
01:33:43,809 --> 01:33:45,720
You didn't score?

1391
01:33:45,889 --> 01:33:50,121
Man, l'm in my damn shorts.
How about you?

1392
01:33:50,689 --> 01:33:55,319
Negative. I had to drive her
halfway out to nowhere.

1393
01:33:57,849 --> 01:34:00,568
-What happened?
-She said, "No way. "

1394
01:34:00,729 --> 01:34:02,401
Well, what do you mean?

1395
01:34:02,569 --> 01:34:04,958
She wouldn't let me
come to her place.

1396
01:34:05,129 --> 01:34:07,006
She wouldn't come to my place.

1397
01:34:07,169 --> 01:34:10,844
-Boy, l don't need that.
-Christ!

1398
01:34:12,729 --> 01:34:14,082
Bob?

1399
01:34:16,209 --> 01:34:19,599
You know, l was thinking....

1400
01:34:19,769 --> 01:34:21,248
You know...

1401
01:34:22,729 --> 01:34:26,688
...if l said anything
earlier tonight that....

1402
01:34:26,849 --> 01:34:30,444
-Don't worry about it.
-Well, you know, l....

1403
01:34:32,729 --> 01:34:35,038
-Did you think about it?
-What's that?

1404
01:34:35,209 --> 01:34:37,200
You know. What we talked about.

1405
01:34:39,409 --> 01:34:42,799
You know, what we talked about.

1406
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:45,403
Yeah, l need to take a break.

1407
01:34:45,569 --> 01:34:49,482
I just, you know,
this thina with Patti. All of it.

1408
01:34:49,649 --> 01:34:52,880
I need a break.
I need a break, l need a break.

1409
01:34:55,329 --> 01:34:57,160
You know, l'm sorry.

1410
01:34:57,329 --> 01:34:59,320
You'll change your mind.

1411
01:34:59,729 --> 01:35:02,038
I'll chanae my mind?
Are you deaf?

1412
01:35:03,529 --> 01:35:05,520
What the fuck's wrona with you?

1413
01:35:05,689 --> 01:35:07,964
Kaput. All riaht?

1414
01:35:08,729 --> 01:35:11,687
We're still friends, riaht?

1415
01:35:12,969 --> 01:35:15,164
You need a ride tomorrow
to the airport?

1416
01:35:15,329 --> 01:35:17,285
I aot a luncheon at noon.

1417
01:35:19,649 --> 01:35:21,560
-John?
-Don't bother.

1418
01:35:21,729 --> 01:35:24,846
-Just don't fucking bother.
-Okay.

1419
01:35:25,009 --> 01:35:27,603
Don't aet all worked up.
I aotta aet some sleep.

1420
01:35:27,809 --> 01:35:31,643
-Bob?
-I'll aive you a call sometime, Carpy.

1421
01:36:58,609 --> 01:37:03,046
The investiaation
was not well handled.

1422
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:07,168
Scottsdale was a small town
back then.

1423
01:37:07,329 --> 01:37:10,241
They suspected Carpy,
but didn't prosecute.

1424
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:13,003
Not a solid case, they said.

1425
01:37:13,569 --> 01:37:15,924
This was before DNA.

1426
01:37:16,089 --> 01:37:20,207
Fourteen years later, a new district
attorney brouaht him up for trial.

1427
01:37:20,369 --> 01:37:23,088
John told them, "He was my friend.

1428
01:37:23,249 --> 01:37:25,240
Why would l kill him?"

1429
01:37:25,689 --> 01:37:28,761
Evidence had been lost,
memories faded.

1430
01:37:28,929 --> 01:37:30,203
He was acquitted.

1431
01:37:30,369 --> 01:37:33,327
Four years later,
he died of a heart attack.

1432
01:37:34,169 --> 01:37:36,205
I can't blame him.

1433
01:37:36,369 --> 01:37:39,202
He was a cool auy, in his way.

1434
01:37:40,289 --> 01:37:42,245
That's how it is.

1435
01:37:42,409 --> 01:37:45,207
Men aotta have fun.

1436
01:41:23,409 --> 01:41:24,398
