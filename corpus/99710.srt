1
00:01:06,037 --> 00:01:07,205
Nice view.

2
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:58,839
Perfect timing.

3
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,770
Wait a minute. He's not alone.

4
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:15,688
That's heartbreaking news.

5
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,982
Pull the plug. A kid's in the car.

6
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:19,901
The drug lord's in the car.

7
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:21,944
Kid took a bad ride, that's all.

8
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:23,279
Abort the action.

9
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:24,489
You're the rigger.

10
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:26,407
I'm the trigger. I decide.

11
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:29,827
You just sit back and watch the show.
Okay, sport?

12
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:34,331
Activate the fail-safe, you psycho!

13
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:37,710
Here's a tip, Ray. There is no fail-safe.

14
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:39,837
Come on! Come on!

15
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:03,985
He'll never make it.

16
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,471
You're an arrogant man, Raymond.

17
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:18,433
I taught you everything you know,
and you dare to turn on me.

18
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,101
Gonna kill me too, Colonel?

19
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:23,188
You're a specialist, Captain.
You deserve better.

20
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,201
Don't forget to write.

21
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,353
You like watching her die?

22
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:05,854
Taking them down?

23
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:10,025
Now I'm taking you down.
You're finished in the Agency.

24
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,444
You're goin' nowhere...

25
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,905
...you're as dead as those people...

26
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:16,782
...in the river.

27
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:19,076
We both are!

28
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:12,144
Have you decided to take thejob?

29
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:13,896
I saw your ad today.

30
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:16,565
-I know it's late--
-It's never too late.

31
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,234
After all, you're giving me a new life.

32
00:07:20,694 --> 00:07:21,820
Really? When?

33
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:24,114
When you kill those three bastards.

34
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:25,782
I'm flattered.

35
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,244
You better get somebody else.

36
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:31,663
I like your voice.

37
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:34,249
You don't need an explosives contractor.

38
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,500
Yes, I do.

39
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,504
-You're my only hope.
-Go to court, use the law.

40
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:41,673
The law's been bought.

41
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:44,050
Use a bullet.

42
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:45,468
Bullets...

43
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:46,970
...are imprecise.

44
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:51,349
I heard you control your explosions...
that you shape your charges.

45
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:54,018
What I shape is my business.

46
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:55,562
All I'm saying...

47
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:57,855
...word is you are the best.

48
00:07:58,231 --> 00:07:59,357
Whose word?

49
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,192
If we couldjust meet....

50
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:04,779
I don't meet or work in Miami
and I don't do jobs like this.

51
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:07,281
Why do you keep calling me back?

52
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:08,783
Why?

53
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:11,035
I like your voice.

54
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,998
Is it my cologne?

55
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,702
They're killers.
You'd be doing the world a favor.

56
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,414
I don't owe the world any favors.
Why did you wait so long?

57
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,790
I thought....

58
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,919
I thought maybe it would pass.

59
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,047
Every day is worse.

60
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,340
Remembering what happened.

61
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,093
That's what I do instead of being alive.

62
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,263
My father hid me in the closet.

63
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,266
I could still see.

64
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,019
My mother suffered.

65
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,315
They tortured her to get my father to talk.

66
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,401
We're going to have to kill her.

67
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:55,195
He walked by something
he shouldn't have seen.

68
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,741
They covered his face
with the pillow from my bed.

69
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:01,701
Waste them.

70
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,161
It was too small.

71
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,956
So they shot him.

72
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,000
I never thought...

73
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,044
...blood would be so sticky.

74
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:14,756
Sometimes I think I can never wash it off.

75
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:29,353
The only thing I understand
anymore is revenge.

76
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:32,982
I'm going in, and I'm going to do it myself.

77
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,359
You'll only get one of them.

78
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:37,069
That's why I need you.

79
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,032
I don't do this kind ofjob anymore.

80
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:00,884
I know you've been watching me,
trying to decide if...

81
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:04,096
...l'm on the level,
ifyou're going to take thejob.

82
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,432
I can't wait anymore, I'm going in.

83
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,893
-They'll make you.
-I have an alias.

84
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:11,686
Adrian Hastings.

85
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:13,104
Wish me luck.

86
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:47,763
Señor León.

87
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:55,062
How's it coming in?

88
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,315
Oh, boy. You don't give up.

89
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,611
It's packed in Monopoly boxes.

90
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:07,533
That's great, Papa.

91
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,994
You get it in. I'll put it on the street.

92
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:16,666
Come here.

93
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:20,086
-How are you?
-Nice party.

94
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,839
You went all out. It's fantastic.

95
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:29,179
-So let's talk numbers.
-Forget business tonight.

96
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:32,015
Go grab yourself a nice mulatta.

97
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,685
I want my money.

98
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:41,357
An advance.
Small token of my family's goodwill.

99
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:42,608
Token?

100
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:44,652
Token.

101
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:50,283
Listen to me, boy.

102
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,451
You know what the Dark Ages are?

103
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:55,413
The Dark Ages are what I brought
the León family out of.

104
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:57,248
I computerized your operation.

105
00:13:57,331 --> 00:14:01,335
I streamlined your security.
I dragged you into the 20th century.

106
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,838
So don't fuck with me.

107
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,423
What is this?

108
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:09,843
A tip? I don't work for tips.
She works for tips.

109
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:12,387
I want my money. I want it now.

110
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:13,972
Go get it.

111
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:18,060
It's always a pleasure working with you.

112
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:07,233
Champagne, please.

113
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:13,714
Is there something you want?

114
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:17,510
What I want, I take.

115
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:19,678
Champagne?

116
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,514
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

117
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:27,478
Welcome to our bank.

118
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,939
I've never seen you before.

119
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:34,443
I lived here when I was little.

120
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,779
A lot's happened since you left.

121
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,531
Like what?

122
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,074
Like me.

123
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:44,953
Insecurity is a terrible thing.

124
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,288
It would be.

125
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,125
I'd like to dance.

126
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,544
What's wrong with keeping
the conversation going?

127
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:55,547
Later. Right now, I'm taking what I want.

128
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,385
You look beautiful tonight!

129
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:41,466
I'll have my driver to pick you up
tomorrow and I'll show you my Miami.

130
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,865
Right on time.

131
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,460
Should I do it, Timer?

132
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:43,861
-Kind ofyoung to be riding the bus.
-Stop it!

133
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,697
What? I'm not good enough for you?

134
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:49,366
I wanna play.

135
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,993
Come on, baby....

136
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:54,955
-Stop! Leave me alone!
-Come on now, what's up, huh?

137
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:07,425
Here, you can take my seat.

138
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:09,761
Thank you!

139
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:18,561
That seat's taken.

140
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:20,688
Fuck you.

141
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:22,273
Excuse me?

142
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,025
Fuck you.

143
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,742
Hold these, please.

144
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,089
What's going on?

145
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:06,733
I hate knives.

146
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:15,116
Fuck you! You son of a bitch!

147
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,427
I believe there's a vacancy.

148
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,259
-What do you drink?
-Martini.

149
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,346
Martini on the rocks.

150
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:21,473
Gold tequila, straight up.

151
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:25,727
No one knows Miami like I do.

152
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:29,981
You like spending the day with me?

153
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,524
Yeah.

154
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:34,027
Do you?

155
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,529
Kiss me.

156
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:38,031
I hardly know you.

157
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,038
Wait 'til you try to spend the night.

158
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,134
Thanks.

159
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,488
Stay here. I must take care of something.

160
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:21,239
Got a light?

161
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:30,665
Is that the piece of shit?

162
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,304
Where were you?

163
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:45,555
Home.

164
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,601
Thanks.

165
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:20,756
What happened to you?

166
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:23,300
I didn't like the show.

167
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:26,261
You don't...

168
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:28,722
...walk away from me...

169
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:31,433
...ever.

170
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:34,352
You understand?

171
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:36,188
Sorry.

172
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:38,899
Get in the car.

173
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:40,400
Sure.

174
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:04,465
Every time...

175
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,635
...he touches me l....

176
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:10,388
I mean...

177
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:12,807
...he's the man who shot my father!

178
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,308
And he's...

179
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:18,896
...kissing me and....

180
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:21,649
Oh, God!

181
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:25,152
You don't have to do it.

182
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:28,572
It's the only way I can get
close enough to kill him!

183
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:35,662
You see, I have this dream:

184
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:38,999
I'm right there when it happens.

185
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,419
He looks at me like I'm a stranger.

186
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:45,714
And I say my name.

187
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:50,719
And it's the last thing he ever hears.

188
00:24:52,512 --> 00:24:54,097
They don't suspect you?

189
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,516
I'm trusted, for the moment.

190
00:24:59,102 --> 00:25:01,521
He's always with you. How do you live?

191
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:02,814
Alone.

192
00:25:04,357 --> 00:25:06,067
That's not what I mean.

193
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:08,027
How do you live...

194
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:10,321
...with yourself?.

195
00:25:10,404 --> 00:25:11,572
How do you?

196
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:30,357
Hey, you!

197
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:34,945
I'm talking to you.

198
00:26:37,698 --> 00:26:39,616
You think you know me?

199
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:42,703
I asked you a question.
Do you think you know me?

200
00:26:43,454 --> 00:26:46,665
'Cause the way you're looking at me,
we must be old friends.

201
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:48,417
Where did we meet?

202
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,002
Nowhere.

203
00:26:51,253 --> 00:26:52,587
Nowhere.

204
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:55,424
You like the bitch?

205
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,974
Maybe you like me.

206
00:27:06,935 --> 00:27:08,603
I don't like you.

207
00:27:10,313 --> 00:27:12,482
Then don't stare so hard.

208
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:14,442
Somebody could...

209
00:27:16,444 --> 00:27:18,571
...put something in your eye.

210
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:32,126
Fucking pervert.

211
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:42,636
Let's move it.

212
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,071
Good night.

213
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:07,327
Adrian.

214
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:26,237
Are you listening?

215
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:30,325
The first rule:

216
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:32,493
Don't go near them again.

217
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:35,079
Second rule:

218
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:37,415
Don't contact me.

219
00:29:37,498 --> 00:29:38,750
I'll contact you.

220
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,418
Maybe I can help you.

221
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,503
-Let me see--
-No.

222
00:29:43,171 --> 00:29:45,506
They're my problem now and I'm theirs.

223
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:51,637
Are you close enough to walk over?

224
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:01,772
Rule three:

225
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:04,900
If this is a setup...

226
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:06,860
...l...

227
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:08,529
...will kill you.

228
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:48,109
Now what?

229
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,779
That cop was a regular.
Juanita's moving in on me.

230
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:54,699
Get out of here!
I don't solve domestic problems!

231
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:56,117
Asshole!

232
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:20,474
Don't go anywhere.

233
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:22,059
I'll be right back.

234
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:24,019
Lucky me.

235
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:58,094
Hey, Charlie!

236
00:32:10,606 --> 00:32:12,024
J & B.

237
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:15,903
The word is, Manny...

238
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:18,239
...you're skimming.

239
00:32:18,364 --> 00:32:21,367
Somebody's lying. I never took a dollar.

240
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,661
I hope it ain't you.

241
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:28,540
Because if you're trying
to screw Joe León....

242
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,628
You've known me, what, ten years?

243
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:35,088
I'm clean.

244
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:36,423
Good.

245
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,050
Very good.

246
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:41,136
Then you have nothing to worry about.

247
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:45,015
Let me see the books.

248
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:17,505
That is it. What?

249
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,925
-How about a drink?
-Sure.

250
00:33:24,678 --> 00:33:26,388
September's missing.

251
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:28,891
See you, Manny.

252
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:43,697
What do you feel like doing?

253
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,251
What?

254
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:58,003
I'm working.

255
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:00,296
You have two hours!

256
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,607
Get another job, kid.

257
00:34:32,328 --> 00:34:35,831
They got two bodies in there.
Something that used to be Charlie...

258
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:38,876
...and a hit on your brothel manager.
That was a bright move.

259
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,920
Something you ordered?
Didn't bother to tell me?

260
00:34:42,004 --> 00:34:43,255
He was a thief.

261
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:45,799
-Tell me about the bomb.
-Very clean.

262
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:48,719
There was no damage
left or right of the blast.

263
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:53,140
The arming device was impacted
inside the C-4, so it was vaporized.

264
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:56,643
Brilliant plan, totally professional.
Must be a specialist.

265
00:34:56,768 --> 00:34:58,770
-This guy is good.
-Yeah, okay.

266
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:03,149
He could put a bomb in your crab shell
and you wouldn't even know it.

267
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:05,485
I'll kill him!

268
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:09,322
You can't kill anyone
until we know who he is, can you?

269
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,741
I'll find him.

270
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:14,953
The important thing to find out
is who he works for.

271
00:35:15,703 --> 00:35:17,372
Maybe he's with the CIA.

272
00:35:17,455 --> 00:35:19,540
Maybe he works for the Mafia.

273
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:22,168
But we have to find out who.

274
00:35:22,502 --> 00:35:23,586
Overview.

275
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:28,257
What does eliminating Charlie mean
in the overall picture?

276
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:30,051
-Nothing.
-Less than nothing.

277
00:35:30,134 --> 00:35:31,886
So this target wasn't territorial.

278
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,346
It was personal.

279
00:35:34,472 --> 00:35:36,640
How the fuck do you know so much?

280
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:40,311
He's guessing. Let me take a few boys,
I'll find this bastard.

281
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:43,856
Wait a minute. Give me a second.
I have to make a decision.

282
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:47,735
Little time to think here, huh?

283
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:54,992
You take over, OK?

284
00:35:56,702 --> 00:36:01,623
I said, Trent will handle it, OK?
I don't hear you saying '"OK'"....

285
00:36:01,707 --> 00:36:02,874
-What did you say?
-OK.

286
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,876
That's nice. Thank you.

287
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:09,548
Fuck you.

288
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:15,011
I'll need resources on this one, Joe.

289
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:18,098
Also, the place was crawling with cops.

290
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:20,767
I can't be tripping over civil servants
every move I make.

291
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,393
I need total control.

292
00:36:22,477 --> 00:36:24,646
Yeah, OK, I will....

293
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:27,065
I will take care of that.

294
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:32,570
Personally.

295
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:57,820
Hello, Timer.

296
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:00,489
Having a good day?

297
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:09,039
Here you go. Knock yourself out.

298
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:45,366
I saw it on the news.

299
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:48,035
You got the first one.

300
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,079
Thank you.

301
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:51,747
Thank you.

302
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:55,668
Well, I'mjust doin' myjob.
You gotta stay away from the other two.

303
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:56,919
I could help you.

304
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,004
I could...

305
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,547
...set them up for you.

306
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,298
No, you stay clear.

307
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:05,553
Their future is about to become very dark.

308
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,347
You're still following me.

309
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,015
Aren't you?

310
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,727
It's gotten so I can feel you.

311
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:15,604
It's all part of the work.

312
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,981
Do you think about me?

313
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,566
I think about you.

314
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,361
My own personal ghost.

315
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,613
Or angel maybe.

316
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,700
-We could meet.
-You're a beautiful woman.

317
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,243
But, I don't meet.

318
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:33,872
-When this is over, I should leave.
-When are you gonna do it?

319
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,207
Soon.

320
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,667
Very soon.

321
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,384
Trent, you know the Chief of Police.

322
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,846
Trent is going to work with us
on this problem.

323
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,641
He was a former employee of the...

324
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,226
...CIA.

325
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,355
He is an explosives expert,
and I think he can be a big help.

326
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,898
I don't know.

327
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:04,485
This has become very public.
I'm sure you want a low profile.

328
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,405
Yeah, please.

329
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,908
It would be hard for Ned to go unnoticed.

330
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,412
I think there's more involved here
than keeping a low profile.

331
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:22,628
I'd say that I'm the one you can trust,
which is the main word here...trust.

332
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,296
To take him out clean.

333
00:40:24,379 --> 00:40:26,340
Our bomb boys are the best.

334
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:29,468
I hope that's true.
They better be fucking magicians...

335
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,720
...because this man's impressive.

336
00:40:31,803 --> 00:40:33,722
What are you, a fucking fan?

337
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,725
Come on! Stop that, this is serious, right?

338
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,393
Don't you two start!

339
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,772
We're here to find a way to protect
the business. Don't forget that.

340
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:44,691
Is that understood?

341
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:48,987
I must tell you...

342
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:51,489
...that this one is not negotiable.

343
00:40:51,573 --> 00:40:54,075
I'll do what I can. Put him on as a fed.

344
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,002
Chief, always a pleasure.

345
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:07,380
Good to see you again.

346
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,469
OK, Danny, help me up.

347
00:41:15,346 --> 00:41:17,681
Oh, boy. I hate that deep couch.

348
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:22,811
Now, listen. Danny, you'll do me a favor.

349
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,232
Do your best to make
this thing look official.

350
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:30,778
No, please. You do that,
and I promise you...

351
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:32,821
...l will not forget you.

352
00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:41,913
A man's got to eat.

353
00:41:48,545 --> 00:41:50,088
Idiota.

354
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,229
Where's the bomb squad?

355
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:20,660
Come on, boys and girls,
what are we doing? Look alive.

356
00:42:20,743 --> 00:42:22,119
What've you got?

357
00:42:22,662 --> 00:42:26,832
We're doing a complete background
check on everybody at the party.

358
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,084
Give me the next one.

359
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:44,558
Listen, I'll handle the biographies.
You trace the C-4. OK, Ace?

360
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:49,855
Chief says you're on this. Fine.

361
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:53,525
But I don't take orders
from any ex-anything.

362
00:42:53,608 --> 00:42:54,734
OK, Ace?

363
00:42:56,278 --> 00:42:59,531
I must tell you. I'm sorry,
I thought your chief said...

364
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:02,617
...the fullest cooperation
would be forthcoming.

365
00:43:02,742 --> 00:43:04,536
I must tell you something.

366
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:07,122
This doesn't feel like full cooperation.

367
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:09,791
Look at this shit. What's this?
This is, uh....

368
00:43:09,874 --> 00:43:11,834
Shouldn't this be in the lock-up?

369
00:43:11,918 --> 00:43:13,294
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

370
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:16,255
You guys are the experts.
Maybe you don't need me.

371
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:18,800
I mean, like what is this? This is....

372
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:21,719
This is Semtex.

373
00:43:21,803 --> 00:43:23,888
Am I right? Plastique.

374
00:43:24,222 --> 00:43:25,181
Plastic explosive.

375
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:27,141
Am I right? You're the expert.

376
00:43:27,225 --> 00:43:30,645
This could blow up this whole area,
and if this area goes...

377
00:43:30,728 --> 00:43:32,980
...the whole building could go up.
Am I right?

378
00:43:33,064 --> 00:43:34,857
I don't know.

379
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:37,610
Maybe if I put this in here....

380
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,405
What else do we have here?

381
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:45,659
This is a plunger detonator, right?
And that's a little mini-receiver.

382
00:43:46,243 --> 00:43:49,872
This looks like American circuitry to me.
Call me a patriot...

383
00:43:49,955 --> 00:43:53,292
...but American craftsmanship
is the greatest.

384
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:54,876
Watch.

385
00:43:55,252 --> 00:43:57,087
Here we go.

386
00:43:57,212 --> 00:43:58,380
Let's see.

387
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,342
Perfect fit, first time...

388
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:04,386
...every time. Screw it on.

389
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:06,096
One little twist.

390
00:44:06,846 --> 00:44:07,973
And, voilà.

391
00:44:08,056 --> 00:44:10,433
A perfect receiver bomb.

392
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,310
Which of course is...

393
00:44:12,394 --> 00:44:14,646
...absolutely worthless without a...

394
00:44:16,022 --> 00:44:17,440
...transmitter.

395
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:27,158
Twenty seconds, and...

396
00:44:27,241 --> 00:44:28,493
...we're hot.

397
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,039
Deactivate it, you sanctimonious prick!

398
00:44:33,748 --> 00:44:35,333
Cut that shit!

399
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:38,711
OK, you made your point!

400
00:44:38,794 --> 00:44:39,879
Have l?

401
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:43,048
-That's enough!
-What do you mean?

402
00:44:43,132 --> 00:44:45,217
You think I give a shit
if the whole block goes up?

403
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:46,177
I don't!

404
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,095
You've had enough. Is that it?

405
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:50,139
Yes, enough is enough!

406
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:53,517
-I can't do it.
-Twelve.

407
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,769
What the hell, are you crazy?

408
00:44:56,228 --> 00:44:59,356
I'm the craziest person
you'll ever meet in your life.

409
00:44:59,982 --> 00:45:01,149
Six.

410
00:45:01,275 --> 00:45:02,276
Five.

411
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,278
Four.

412
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:06,405
-Three.
-Please!

413
00:45:15,997 --> 00:45:17,540
Now, here's a tip...

414
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:19,834
...you take care of the shit work.

415
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:23,088
And leave the fox at the party to me. OK?

416
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,924
We on the same page?

417
00:45:29,177 --> 00:45:30,345
Ace?

418
00:46:10,217 --> 00:46:12,386
Do you like it? Those go upstairs.

419
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:14,137
I like where I live.

420
00:46:15,722 --> 00:46:17,516
I like you where I live.

421
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:19,434
Thanks.

422
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,395
Close the doors. Leave.

423
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:38,661
Better than you're used to?

424
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:43,333
Next time you order a hit you might
consider taking out your decorator.

425
00:46:47,837 --> 00:46:49,797
You like to live dangerously?

426
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,509
A little danger never killed anyone.

427
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:54,927
Right, baby?

428
00:46:56,345 --> 00:46:57,930
Sometimes.

429
00:47:12,111 --> 00:47:13,278
You know...

430
00:47:13,946 --> 00:47:15,697
...when I look at you...

431
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:19,952
...l see something I like very much.

432
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,996
Know what it is?

433
00:47:23,121 --> 00:47:25,457
I'm breathless with anticipation.

434
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:28,627
I see me.

435
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:43,016
Let's get this over with.

436
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,205
Wait a minute.

437
00:48:07,581 --> 00:48:09,834
You're the Mob's accountant, Bill.

438
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,086
Is that all you've got for me?

439
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:14,380
No. I have something else for you.

440
00:48:21,512 --> 00:48:22,846
See you later.

441
00:48:22,971 --> 00:48:26,141
Don't touch that! It could be a bomb!

442
00:48:29,144 --> 00:48:30,479
Very funny.

443
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,050
Son of a bitch!

444
00:50:01,484 --> 00:50:02,318
Kid!

445
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:07,573
Look at the way you parked
my fucking car.

446
00:50:08,574 --> 00:50:10,993
Sir, I didn't park your car.

447
00:50:13,412 --> 00:50:14,580
Sorry.

448
00:50:15,122 --> 00:50:16,707
I'll get it for you.

449
00:50:54,161 --> 00:50:55,787
Here's your tip.

450
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,842
Some ride that must have been.

451
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,511
Is this the decoy?

452
00:52:38,512 --> 00:52:40,514
Who was this supposed to fool?

453
00:52:42,892 --> 00:52:44,226
Any witnesses?

454
00:52:45,978 --> 00:52:47,229
The kid?

455
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,819
Nice one, Ray.

456
00:52:54,403 --> 00:52:55,737
Clever boy.

457
00:53:04,871 --> 00:53:06,373
'"Bye-bye.'"

458
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:10,168
At least he hasn't lost his sense of humor.

459
00:53:15,465 --> 00:53:17,634
Who gave you permission to smile?

460
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:19,260
Shut up.

461
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:45,745
Quite a step up for you, isn't it?

462
00:53:45,911 --> 00:53:47,997
Depends on how you look at it.

463
00:53:49,206 --> 00:53:51,250
-Tomas is on his way--
-Shut up!

464
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:53,252
Who are you?

465
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:56,380
I said, '"Who are you?'"

466
00:53:57,006 --> 00:53:58,215
Who are you?

467
00:53:58,299 --> 00:53:59,800
I'll tell you who you are.

468
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:01,510
You are nobody.

469
00:54:01,593 --> 00:54:03,303
I created Adrian Hastings.

470
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:04,888
I got you inside.

471
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,975
You work for me.
Don't you ever fucking forget it.

472
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:12,396
You should have him
out in the open by now.

473
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,148
You get your three corpses,
I get Ray Quick.

474
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:17,734
That was the deal. What happened?

475
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:20,987
I can't keep him on the line
long enough to get a trace.

476
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:23,240
He doesn't want to take a meeting.

477
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:26,284
What should I do?
Wish him out of hiding?

478
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:28,203
You're in over your head.

479
00:54:28,453 --> 00:54:31,623
Maybe you've outlived your usefulness.
Is that possible?

480
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,041
You need me.

481
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:36,169
I studied him, I drew him out.

482
00:54:37,837 --> 00:54:41,174
With my voice, with my ads. He trusts me.

483
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:43,801
Why do I need you?

484
00:54:44,177 --> 00:54:47,680
Why don't I just grab him
before he brings Tomas down?

485
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:49,432
Why do you even need...

486
00:54:49,682 --> 00:54:51,309
...to live at all?

487
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:55,354
Maybe he's not interested in a big-mouth,
hotshot asshole like you.

488
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:01,152
You know what I love about you?

489
00:55:02,987 --> 00:55:04,697
It's not just this...

490
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,990
...poetry.

491
00:55:08,492 --> 00:55:10,160
It's your heart.
