1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000

2
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,682
Well, the thing I've been 
asking myself is ...

3
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:03,537
What kinda sick individual names
 a street Edgewood Way ...

4
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,259
and then put it half a mile away 
from Edgewood Lane?

5
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,533
Crazy.

6
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:17,398
Got me out in this creepy, 
confusing-ass suburb.

7
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,770
Serious though. I feel here like 
a sore thumb out here.

8
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:29,549
Alright man, alright, 
talk to you soon. See ya.

9
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,826
Okay, so this is the Rhine Ave.

10
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,881
It's like a fucking hedge maze out here.

11
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,309
Okay, let's see, east ...

12
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:47,598
Keep going straight, and then ...

13
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:52,056
I think he said the left on, 
what was that, Peacock?

14
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:57,162
Go straight, then left on ...

15
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:18,874
I just keep on walking. 
I don't do nothing stupid. Just keep on...

16
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,246
Fuck this, I'm going fucking go 
the other way I came.

17
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:27,228
Not today. Not me.

18
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:31,594
You know how they like to do 
motherfuckers out here. Man, I'm gone.

19
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,007
Come on. This is ... Help.

20
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:50,091
Quality over Quantity (QoQ) Releases
Get Out (2016)

21
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:41,033
You're so cute. How is it going over there?

22
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:44,116
Good.

23
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:48,082
You've got your toothbrush? - Yes.

24
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,797
Do you have your deodorant? - Check.

25
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:55,917
Do you have your cozy clothes? - Got that.

26
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:02,962
Can you give me a minute, Sid? 
We gotta pry something out of your dad.

27
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,585
What?

28
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:17,657
Do they know... Do they know I'm black?

29
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:21,328
No.

30
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:24,703
Should they?

31
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,047
It seems like...

32
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,979
something you might want to know ...

33
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:36,028
Mention.

34
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:41,066
"Mom and Dad, my uh, my black boyfriend 
will be coming up this weekend ...

35
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:46,367
and I just don't want you to be shocked because he's a blackman. "Black ...

36
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,755
You said I was the first black guy you ever dated? Yeah, so what?

37
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:51,969
Yeah, so this is uncharted territory for them.

38
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,553
You know I don't want to be chased  off the lawn with a shotgun.

39
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:59,618
You're not going to. First of all, my dad would have voted for Obama a third time if he could have.

40
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:01,910
Like, the love is so real.

41
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:05,246
I'm only telling you that because he is definitely going to want to talk to you about that...

42
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:07,689
and it will definitely fucking suck.

43
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:11,424
But that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else.

44
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:14,240
They are not racist.

45
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,413
I would have told you.

46
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,331
I wouldn't be bringing you home to them. 
Think about that for just two seconds.

47
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,560
I'm thinking.Yeah, yeah, yeah good.

48
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,294
I'm a grown man ... - No way.

49
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:44,569
You broke my cigarette.

50
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,518
Really? You just threw it out. - Not really.

51
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:49,622
That was a dollar. You basically threw a dollar out the window.

52
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,022
Well, that was a dollar you decided to spend on nicotine and tobacco.

53
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,842
Hold on, I've got to call Rod.

54
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:58,467
Don't, don't, don't do that.

55
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,105
Whasup?

56
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,624
Yo, you at work? - Yeah, yeah, I'm at work.

57
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,305
Look, look Chris, tell me this okay?

58
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:12,095
How can I get in trouble for patting 
down an old lady?  It's standard procedure.

59
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:16,987
Gary just thinks if an elderly bitch is elderly, 
she can't hijack no motherfucking plane.

60
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,777
See, wait, wait, now, 
I know you're laughing.

61
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,918
I'm serious, man. The next 9/11 is going 
to be on some geriatric shit.

62
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:27,295
Look man thanks for looking after Sid this weekend.
 Remember no human food.

63
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:30,498
He's go, he's got IBS. - Damn, 
see give me some type of credit.

64
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:32,675
Okay, I don't forget shit. You do.

65
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,855
No, I accept your apology. It's all good.

66
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:40,479
How's little Miss Rosie? 
- It's okay. She rides.

67
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:41,767
Let me talk to him. - No.

68
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,510
I'd like to talk to him please?

69
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,488
Hold on, hold on.

70
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:49,367
Hi, Rod. - Look here, 
you know you picked the wrong guy, right?

71
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,258
Oh yeah of course I know that.
 This is all just a ploy to get you.

72
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:54,850
It's not too late for us.
 - Okay, okay, get your own girl.

73
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:57,272
It don't matter, 
because you never take my advice.

74
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:58,380
At what?

75
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:00,664
Like don't go to a white 
girl parents house.

76
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,964
What she doing,
 licking your balls or something?

77
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,489
Goodbye. - You know what I'm saying, Chris?

78
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,013
That bastard hung up on me.

79
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,831
You're jealous. - I'm not jealous.

80
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,785
I made you jealous. It's Rod.
 - I'm not jealous of Rod.

81
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:38,301
You okay? - Yeah, that scared
 the shit out of me, and you?

82
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,724
Yes.

83
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:04,077
Stay here. - What? What are you doing?

84
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:08,490
I don't know. I...

85
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:11,975
Well maybe it's gone you know...

86
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:11,783
So in the future, the number to 
call is Animal Control Services.

87
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:15,971
Yes sorry. I was just disoriented.

88
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:18,492
So you guys, uh, come out from the city?

89
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,707
Yeah, yeah. My parents are from the Lake Pontaco area. 
We're just heading up there for the weekend.

90
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:27,337
Sir, can I see your license, please?
 - Wait, why?

91
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,839
Yeah... I have a state ID.

92
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:31,953
No, no, no.  He wasn't driving.

93
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:35,100
I didn't ask who was driving. 
I asked to see his ID.

94
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:38,134
Yeah, why? That doesn't make any sense.
 - Here.

95
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,857
No, no, no. Fuck that. You don't have to give him
 your ID because you haven't done anything wrong.

96
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,236
Baby, baby, it's okay. Come on.

97
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:48,058
Anytime there is an incident we have every 
right to ask... - That's bullshit.

98
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,612
Ma'am, the ...

99
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,213
Everything alright, Ryan?

100
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:01,371
Yeah, I'm good.

101
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,260
Get that headlight fixed. And that mirror.

102
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:11,532
Thank you officer.

103
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:23,464
What? - That was hot.

104
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,465
I'm not, I'm not going to let 
anyone fuck with my man.

105
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:28,691
I see that.

106
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:32,440
We're here.

107
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:52,140
That's the groundskeeper.

108
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,179
Are you ready?

109
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:14,781
Hi. - There's my little girl. Come here.

110
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:18,563
How are you? - I love you too.
 I've missed you.

111
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,321
This is my Dad, Dean. This is Chris.

112
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,600
Call me Mr. Armitage. - Of course. I...

113
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:26,100
I'm kidding. You call me Dean 
and you hug me, my man.

114
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,677
How are you? - Good. How are you?

115
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,058
We're huggers. - Yes.

116
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,689
This is my Mom. This is Chris.

117
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:31,968
Welcome.

118
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:34,785
Nice to meet you.

119
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:39,516
Your father is very excited. 
Anyway, yeah, Missy.

120
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:43,169
Come on in, please. Welcome to our house.

121
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:50,967
How was your drive in? - It was fine.

122
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,678
We actually hit a deer.
 - What? - Oh, nooo...

123
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,365
Was it dead? - Yeah.

124
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:57,894
Oh, that's horrible. Are you guys alright?

125
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,646
Yeah, it just shook us up. - Really?

126
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,901
Yeah, it came out of nowhere.
 We got it pretty good.

127
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:05,064
Yeah, it must have frucked you out.

128
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,766
Shit, frucking weird.
 But you know what I say?

129
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:12,299
I say, one down, 
a couple hundred thousand to go.

130
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:17,085
No, I don't mean to get on my high horse, 
but I'm telling you I do not like the deer.

131
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:19,886
I'm sick of it. They're taking over.
 They're like rats.

132
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:24,744
They're destroy the ecosystem. If I see a dead deer on 
the side of the road, I think to myself that's a start.

133
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:28,058
I don't even understand that. I'm sorry.
 - I'm just saying.

134
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:32,257
You know what? I am grateful for what you
 have done today. I don't like them.

135
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:34,121
We got that.

136
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,410
Yeah ... - You guys look so wiped out.

137
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,091
Yeah, yeah, a little.

138
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:45,417
so how long has this been going on? 
This, this thing?

139
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,295
How long?

140
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,938
Four months. - Four months.

141
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,231
Uh, five months, actually.

142
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:57,236
She's right. -No problem.

143
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:59,763
That a boy. Better get used to saying that.

144
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:03,458
I ... Please. I'm so sorry.

145
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,398
Oh yeah, I'm sorry. She's right. I'm wrong.

146
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,322
See?

147
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:09,906
Does he have an off button?
 This is exhausting.

148
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,607
No. I want to give you a tour.

149
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,326
They just ... - Can we unpack first?

150
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:15,873
You want to unpack? Before the tour?

151
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,113
This is Missy's office. 
She takes appointments in there.

152
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:23,720
She's a therapist, right?
 - Psychiatrist, yeah.

153
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:27,779
Yeah, it turns out people up here are just as
 messed up in the head as they are in the city.

154
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:30,844
This is Jeremy. 
This is Rose's little brother.

155
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:32,317
I've heard stories.

156
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:37,561
Yeah, I bet you have. He's studying medicine now.
 Wants to be just like his old man.

157
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,465
You'll meet him. - Alright, cool.

158
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:42,890
Picked these up in Bali.

159
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:47,251
That's pretty eclectic. I'm a...

160
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:53,372
I'm a traveler and I can't help it.
 I keep bringing souvenirs back.

161
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:59,200
It's such a privilege to be able to experience 
another person's culture. Know what I'm saying?

162
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:04,323
Here, you're going to love this. 
My Dad's claim to fame.

163
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:09,734
He was beat by Jesse Owens in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

164
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,868
Those were the ones where ... - Owens won in front of Hitler.

165
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:18,096
Yes, what a moment, what a moment. I mean, Hitler's up there with all his perfect Aryan race bullshit.

166
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:22,550
This black dude comes along and proves him wrong in front of the entire whole world. Amazing.

167
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:27,689
Not great for your dad, though. - Yeah. He almost got over it.

168
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:34,680
Uh, that's the basement. We had to seal it up. There's some black mold down there.

169
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:39,140
My mother loved her kitchen, so we keep a piece of her in here.

170
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:43,165
Georgina, this is Chris. This is Rose's boyfriend.

171
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:46,165
Hi. - Hello.

172
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:52,139
The garbage goes under the sinks. And now for the ...

173
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:55,007
piece de resistance.

174
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:01,325
The field of play

175
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:07,241
I love it. The nearest house is across the lake.

176
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:09,926
Total privacy.

177
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:20,342
I know what you're thinking. - What?

178
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:22,007
Come on, I get it.

179
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:27,765
White family, black servants. It's a total cliché.

180
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:30,590
I wasn't going to take it there. - Well you didn't have to, believe me.

181
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:38,098
Now, we hired Georgina and Walter to help care for my parents.

182
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:43,374
When they died I just couldn't bare to let them go.

183
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:48,411
But boy, I hate how it looks.

184
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:50,595
Yeah, I know what you mean.

185
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:57,893
By the way, I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could.

186
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:00,249
Best president in my lifetime. Hands down.

187
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:03,046
I agree. - Yeah.

188
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:12,093
So what do your parents do, Chris?

189
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:17,717
Uh, my Dad wasn't really in the picture.  My mom passed away when I was like eleven.

190
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,134
Oh, I'm sorry. How did she die? - A hit and run.

191
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:22,431
That's horrible.

192
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:24,807
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. - You were young.

193
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,921
Actually I don't remember a lot from that time, so ...

194
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,643
Well that's okay, we don't have to talk about that.

195
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:39,184
You smoke you, Chris?

196
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:44,089
You Jonesing a little bit over there? - I'm quitting.

197
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:47,066
Dad, this is why I don't bring people to the house anymore.

198
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:51,134
That's okay, we're not judging. - But it's a nasty habit though.

199
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:57,143
You should have Missy take care of that for you.  - How?

200
00:19:57,146 --> 00:20:01,767
Hypnosis. She developed a method and I'm telling you it works like a charm.

201
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,042
Some people don't want strangers messing around in their heads, guys.

202
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:10,706
Listen, Chris, I thought it was total bullshit.

203
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:15,425
I smoked cigarettes for fifteen years and I loved every goddamn puff I took.

204
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:19,608
She puts me under once, the sight of a cigarette makes me want to vomit.

205
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:25,150
Okay fall back, Dean. - It's a service we provide.

206
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,282
I'm good actually, thank you.

207
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:33,760
Well, smoker or not, we're thrilled to have you up here for the get together.

208
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:36,616
Wait, holy shit that's this weekend? - Yeah.

209
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:38,584
What get together? - Ohhhh God.

210
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:43,543
Thanks Georg. It's a ... Rose's grandfathers .. party.

211
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:48,069
My Dad would throw a shin dig once a year.  Get all his friends together...

212
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,860
bocce ball , badminton ...

213
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:52,991
Wait, why didn't you guys tell me about this?

214
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:56,560
Well, it's the same day every year, sweetheart. - No it's not.

215
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:59,150
Um, actually it is. - Yes.

216
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,189
Is it really? - Yeah, that is completely wrong.

217
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:07,589
We just kept it up, because after they died, it felt like we'd keep them close to us.

218
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:08,866
They are still with us.

219
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:12,374
I just wanted a quick chill weekend. - Lots of fun.

220
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,585
Sorry. - Georgina?

221
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:19,379
I am so sorry. Look what I ... - That's okay.

222
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:22,289
Why don't you go lay down, just get some rest?

223
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:29,864
Yes. I think I will. - Good.

224
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:39,015
Oh, must be very ... - What's up, fam.?

225
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:40,702
Hey, Jer-bear.

226
00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:42,638
Hi darling. - Hey, buddy.

227
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,251
Nobody answers the door around here?

228
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:47,599
Hey Rosie.

229
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:50,222
Why would I lie? - Love it.

230
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:55,386
Has she told you about her toenail collection?

231
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:57,102
What? - Oh my God.

232
00:21:57,105 --> 00:22:00,336
She used to bite them off, suck on them and then save them in a jewelry box.

233
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:05,828
No I didn't, I do not know what you're talking about. - That is really disgusting.

234
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:07,924
I fucking hate you. - Okay, here's a good one.

235
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,976
Let me set the scene, it was our junior year.

236
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:15,045
Rose has a crush on this guy Conner Garfield. - No.

237
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:17,338
Conner Garfield.  - No. Mom.

238
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:19,627
No, Jeremy, stop.

239
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,724
No. These are good, these are good. We got to ... I want to hear them. - Rose, where are your manners?

240
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:27,589
Our guest wants to hear the stories. Please. - Thank you.

241
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:31,821
So Conner is from my lacrosse team. Huge kid, like 6' 3". He's pretty dumb, right.

242
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:34,852
So we through this party ... - You through a party.

243
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:38,118
I think my parents were in Greece or something.

244
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:41,719
We raided their liquor cabinet, and we were all shit-faced, like fifteen of us.

245
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:44,231
Oh my god, tell me this isn't true, Rose.

246
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,235
I filled the liquor bottles with water ... let me finish

247
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:55,796
Go ahead. I'm curious. - Okay so I'm upstairs ...

248
00:22:56,204 --> 00:23:00,440
hooking up with the hottest girl in the class, Jan Deely.

249
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:04,609
Do you realize you're coming off as like the world's biggest douchebag, right now, right?

250
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,955
So Conner starts banging on the bathroom door, right. So I open it ...

251
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,042
and blood's gushing from his mouth and he's screaming: "Your sister bite my fucking tongue off," right.

252
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:18,065
You bit him?

253
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:23,252
Okay, okay, to be fair, it was my first kiss and he slipped some tongue...

254
00:23:23,255 --> 00:23:27,623
and I was not expecting it. It was a reflex. I'm sorry!

255
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:29,776
A reflex that I' have since gotten rid of.

256
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:33,459
Yeah, you better be careful. - Yeah, I'm going to be very careful now.

257
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:40,076
I'm going to get dessert. And Dean, maybe clean it up just a little bit?

258
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:51,480
So Chris, what's your sport? Football? Baseball? - Basketball, mostly ...

259
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:53,110
Are you an MMA fan?

260
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,906
Dude. - Dude, what?

261
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:57,867
What?

262
00:23:57,884 --> 00:24:01,760
Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone else have the floor for a second?

263
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:06,088
You're dating my sister, right?

264
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,712
He's dating my sister. You had your chance.

265
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:12,887
I can't get to know the guy?

266
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:18,545
You mean like UFC?

267
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,932
Yes. - Yeah, no too brutal for me.

268
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:27,970
Have you ever gotten into street fights as a kid?

269
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:32,498
I did judo after school, first grade. You should have seen me.

270
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:33,807
Judo?

271
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:39,466
Because with your frame and your genetic makeup ...

272
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:42,720
if you really pushed your body ...

273
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:48,875
And I mean really train.  No pussyfooting around. You'd be a fucking beast.

274
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,886
Carrotcake.

275
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:55,796
Carrotcake.

276
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,545
What have I missed?

277
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:03,492
A whole bunch of nothing. - We just talking about sports.

278
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:06,108
Right? - Yeah.

279
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:07,605
That sounds good.

280
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:11,628
So the thing about jiujitsu is...

281
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:14,656
that strength does not matter.

282
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,426
It's all about this.

283
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:21,687
It is a strategic game, like chess.

284
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:26,107
It's all about getting  two, three, four moves ahead.

285
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:30,957
Cool.

286
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:38,069
Stand up.

287
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:41,729
Jeremy, no karate at the dinner table. - It is not karate, Mom.

288
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:44,134
Yo, I've got a rule: no play fighting with drunk people.

289
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:46,277
Not going to play? I just want to...

290
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,555
I wasn't going to hurt him.

291
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:10,869
He was going to put you in a fucking headlock.

292
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,745
What is his problem? He has never treated any of my boyfriends that way. Ever, ever, ever.

293
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,784
Oh my god and then my Dad, with his those "my man" stuff.

294
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,568
My man, my man. I don't think he's ever heard that or said it...

295
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:26,676
and now that is all he says.

296
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:33,348
Yep.  -Oh, and my mom being rude to Georgina? What the fuck was that about? That was so crazy.

297
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:40,018
I mean how are they different than that cop?

298
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,985
That's the fucking bummer of it all.

299
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:52,107
Anything, anything more you'd like to add.

300
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:57,141
I told you so.

301
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:05,517
I didn't want to say, I didn't want  to say it, I didn't want to say it. I didn't want to say it.

302
00:27:05,688 --> 00:27:07,455
I don't like being wrong.

303
00:27:07,616 --> 00:27:09,921
I've noticed that. - I am sorry.

304
00:27:09,924 --> 00:27:14,681
No, no, no. Wait. Come here. - Sorry. This sucks.

305
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:16,204
What? Why do you say you're sorry?

306
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:20,240
Because I brought you here and I'm related to all of them.

307
00:27:20,243 --> 00:27:22,162
No, it's fine.

308
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:27,314
Why are you so calm? - Honestly, this is nothing.

309
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:30,259
I like you and your racial flow

310
00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:33,592
Is this a racial flow? - Racial.

311
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:36,827
Are you feeling a racial flow. - Yes, you feel racial flowing.

312
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,049
What? - The party.

313
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,898
How bad can that be? - They're so white.

314
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:58,578
Like so white. - It's all good.

315
00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:08,107
You know, with my genetic makeup the shit goes down. I'm a beast.

316
00:30:58,113 --> 00:31:00,836
Do you realize how dangerous smoking is?

317
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:07,263
Yeah.

318
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,958
Come in and sit with me, please.

319
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,601
Just for a moment, please.

320
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:15,299
Thank you.

321
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,412
So you're comfortable enough, right? - It's perfect. Thanks.

322
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:26,515
Sure.

323
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,216
Want to know how it works?

324
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:46,255
You dangle a pocket watch in front of people's faces? Is that it?

325
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:51,476
You watch a lot of TV. - When I was a kid.

326
00:31:52,365 --> 00:31:54,909
Now you're feeling very sleepy.

327
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:59,154
We do use focal points sometimes to...

328
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:03,163
guide someone into a state of heightened suggestibility.

329
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,902
Heightened suggestibility? - That's right, that's right.

330
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:14,229
Do you smoke in front of my daughter?

331
00:32:16,444 --> 00:32:20,307
I'm going to quit, I promise. - That's my kid, that is my kid.

332
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,381
Are you interested?

333
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,126
What about your mother?

334
00:32:32,003 --> 00:32:33,139
What about her?

335
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:35,814
Wait, are we ... - Where were you when she died?

336
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,357
I don't to think about that.

337
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:56,822
Home ... watching TV.

338
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,545
can you hear the TV?

339
00:32:58,827 --> 00:32:59,942
What do you hear?

340
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:03,407
Rain. - Rain. It was raining.

341
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:07,888
Can you hear the rain?

342
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,518
Do you hear it? Find it.

343
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,604
Tell me when you've found it.

344
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:34,180
Come here, Chris, look at me.

345
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:40,744
I found it. - Where was your mom?

346
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:48,668
She uh...

347
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,698
She was coming home. She wasn't home.

348
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,973
From her work?

349
00:34:03,147 --> 00:34:04,677
And what did you do?

350
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,410
Nothing.

351
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:13,898
Nothing?

352
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,128
I just sat there.

353
00:34:17,712 --> 00:34:20,003
You Didn't call anyone? - No.

354
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:21,044
Why not?

355
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,550
I don't know, I just...

356
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:31,290
thought that if I did, it would make it real.

357
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,890
You're so scared.

358
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,361
Do you think it was your fault?

359
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:52,091
How do you feel now?

360
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:55,670
I can't move.

361
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:00,564
You can't move. - Why can't I move?

362
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:02,756
You're paralyzed.

363
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:06,857
Just Like that day when you did nothing. You did nothing.

364
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:12,725
Now...

365
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,974
sink into the floor.

366
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:17,710
Wait, wait, wait. - Sink.

367
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,749
Now you're in the Sunken place.

368
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,784
What's up man?

369
00:38:46,797 --> 00:38:48,585
They working you good out here, huh?

370
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:59,640
Nothing I don't want to be doing.

371
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,216
I didn't get to meet you yet, up close. I'm Chris.

372
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,901
I know who you are.

373
00:39:13,175 --> 00:39:15,102
She is lovely isn't she?

374
00:39:16,568 --> 00:39:17,658
Rose?

375
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:24,189
Yes, she is. - One of a kind. Top of the line.

376
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:27,923
A real doggone keeper.

377
00:39:30,898 --> 00:39:32,006
Right.

378
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:37,766
I'm sorry about last night. - What?

379
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,792
My exercise. I did not mean to scare you.

380
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,784
And did it work? - Did What work?

381
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:52,433
You were in Mrs Armitage's office for quite some time.

382
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:02,684
I guess I had too much of that wine last night.  I can't really remember...

383
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:09,180
Well, I should get back to work and mind my own business.

384
00:40:29,918 --> 00:40:32,341
I think your mom hypnotized me last night.

385
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:36,805
What? When?

386
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:41,394
I went out for, I went out for some air last night and I run into her...

387
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:47,131
and I can barely remember any of it but now the thought of a cigarette makes me want to throw up.

388
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:50,280
Oh my God.

389
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:55,111
I'm Sorry. I can't believe she did that to you.

390
00:40:55,114 --> 00:40:58,441
And I had some fucked up dreams. - What did you dream?

391
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:02,639
I was in a hole or something and I could not move. It was like ...

392
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:06,077
God, That sounds terrible. I'm Sorry.

393
00:41:08,877 --> 00:41:10,681
What's Walter's deal?

394
00:41:11,364 --> 00:41:12,809
What do you mean his deal?

395
00:41:12,812 --> 00:41:16,926
I just talked to the dude and his whole vibe is hostile.  - Did he say something?

396
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:22,009
It's not what he says it's how he says it.

397
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:29,024
Maybe he likes you.

398
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:32,990
Maybe he's jealous or something. I...

399
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,354
Are you fucking with me? - No.

400
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:41,508
So you think I've got a chance?

401
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:44,912
Okay, you find that funny. - Do you have a good word?

402
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:48,773
Great, no, fine. - I will, I'm going to talk with my Dad about that.  That is not...

403
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:50,942
No, don't talk to your Dad.  It's fine.   - No, that's not it.

404
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:55,444
It's fine, it's not a big deal. Forget about it.  It's done.

405
00:41:58,588 --> 00:41:59,699
Oh boy.

406
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:09,029
Oh man.

407
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:12,439
It begins. Are you ready for it?

408
00:42:12,854 --> 00:42:15,352
Yeah, yeah. - Not me.

409
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:19,251
There they are. Marcia.

410
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:20,963
So nice.

411
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,875
Just laugh. - Laugh? Okay. How do you do that again?

412
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:29,900
Just smile all the time. Yeah, there you go. There it is.

413
00:42:31,777 --> 00:42:34,067
oh Look, it's the Greene's.

414
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,445
Gordon and Emily, this is Chris. Chris, this is Gordon and Emily Greene.

415
00:42:37,448 --> 00:42:39,536
Nice to meet you, Chris.

416
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:41,223
Nice to meet you indeed. - Also.

417
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,350
Boy That's quite a grip. - Thank you. You too.

418
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,100
Do you ever play golf?

419
00:42:45,103 --> 00:42:47,880
Once, a few years ago. I wasn't very good.

420
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:52,292
Gordon was a professional golfer for years. - Are you kidding?

421
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:58,499
Well I can't quite swing the hips like I used to though. But I do know Tiger.

422
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,585
Isn't That's great. - Super.

423
00:43:01,588 --> 00:43:06,705
Gordon loves Tiger. - The best I've ever seen, ever hands down.

424
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:09,674
So Chris. Let's see your form.

425
00:43:10,843 --> 00:43:13,678
This is Nelson and Alisa. - How are you doing?

426
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,704
Oh, How handsome is he?

427
00:43:17,707 --> 00:43:19,352
Are you handsome?

428
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:27,447
Not bad, huh Nelson?

429
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:32,190
So, Is it true?

430
00:43:34,574 --> 00:43:36,024
Is it better?

431
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:42,898
Fair skin has been in favor for the past what, couple of hundreds of years...

432
00:43:42,901 --> 00:43:47,743
But now the pendulum has swung back. Black is in fashion.

433
00:43:51,456 --> 00:43:55,159
Pardon me. I'm going to take some pictures. - Of course.

434
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,401
There he is.

435
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,239
Good to see another brother around here.

436
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:08,499
Hi. Yes of course it is.

437
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:12,033
Is something wrong?

438
00:45:13,223 --> 00:45:17,708
There you are. Can you do something with this.

439
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:22,969
Hey. I'm Philomena. And you are?

440
00:45:23,873 --> 00:45:25,978
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.

441
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:30,193
Fantastic. You two make a lovely couple.

442
00:45:31,045 --> 00:45:36,013
Thanks. - Where are my manners? Logan. Logan King.

443
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:40,917
Chris just told me that he felt much more comfortable with my being here.

444
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:43,318
That's nice.

445
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:50,707
Logan, I hate to tear you away dear, but the Wincott's were asking about you.

446
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:55,544
Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris.

447
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,921
Goodbye.

448
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,334
What the fuck?

449
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:39,582
Ignorance.

450
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,567
Who? - All of them.

451
00:46:43,642 --> 00:46:47,843
They mean well, but they have no idea what real people go through.

452
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:52,395
Jim Hudson.
- Chris.

453
00:46:52,398 --> 00:46:53,978
I know who you are.

454
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:58,324
I am an admirer of your work. You have a great eye.

455
00:46:58,327 --> 00:47:02,723
Wait. Jim Hudson? Hudson Galleries?

456
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:07,495
Believe me, the irony of being a blind art dealer, isn't lost on me.

457
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:09,472
How'd you do it?

458
00:47:10,646 --> 00:47:15,177
My assistants describes the work to me in great detail.

459
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:17,527
You've got something.

460
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,945
The images you capture are so brutal, so melancholic.

461
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:25,416
Powerful stuff. I think.

462
00:47:25,915 --> 00:47:26,931
Thank you.

463
00:47:27,798 --> 00:47:31,987
I used to dabble myself.  Wilderness mostly.

464
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:37,828
I have submitted to "Nat Geo" 14 times before I realizing I didn't have the eye.

465
00:47:37,912 --> 00:47:41,769
I began dealing and then of course my vision went to shit.

466
00:47:43,788 --> 00:47:47,445
I know. Life can be a sick joke.

467
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:53,143
One day you're developing prints in the dark room, the next day you wake up in the dark.

468
00:47:54,048 --> 00:47:55,571
Genetic disease.

469
00:47:56,032 --> 00:48:00,373
Shit ain't fair, man.  -  Oh you've got that right, shit ain't fair.

470
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:01,445
Come here.

471
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:06,498
What the fuck? You left me out there.
 - Look at this.

472
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:12,034
She unplugged my phone.
- Who?

473
00:49:12,037 --> 00:49:14,998
Georgina. I came here to talk to Rod and now I got no juice.

474
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,396
So you think she did that because...?
- Maybe she doesn't like ...

475
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,897
the fact that I'm with you

476
00:49:27,453 --> 00:49:28,683
Really?

477
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:30,759
It's a thing.

478
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:35,227
So, you are so sexy that people are just unplugging your phone?

479
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:40,168
Forget it.  Never mind.
- No, no stop. Don't ...

480
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:45,344
Don't  do that. Don't ...
- It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry. It's all good, right?

481
00:49:59,562 --> 00:50:01,651
ah, they got you on display now, huh?

482
00:50:01,654 --> 00:50:04,103
It's weird, man. And the people here too.

483
00:50:04,106 --> 00:50:06,622
It's Like they haven't met a black person that doesn't work for them.

484
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:08,055
yep you're in it

485
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:12,559
All full of shit, I didn't even want to tell you. - What?

486
00:50:14,273 --> 00:50:18,252
I got hypnotized last night.
- Man get the fuck out of here.

487
00:50:18,255 --> 00:50:23,033
No. Yo, yo, yeah it's to quit smoking. But Rose's mom's a psychiatrist, so ...

488
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:25,878
Bro I don't care if the bitch is Iyanla Vanzant, okay?

489
00:50:25,881 --> 00:50:28,548
She can't fix my motherfucking life.  You ain't getting in my head.

490
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:32,915
I know. She caught me off guard right, but it's cool because ...

491
00:50:34,018 --> 00:50:38,189
I'm cured. It worked.
- Bro, Why are not you scared of this, man?

492
00:50:38,192 --> 00:50:42,997
They could of had you doing all types of stupid shit. They could of had you barking like a dog...

493
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,761
flying around like you're a fucking pigeon, looking ridiculous, okay. Or...

494
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,700
I don't know if you know this. White people love making people sex slaves and shit.

495
00:50:51,702 --> 00:50:54,284
Yeah I'm pretty sure they are not a kinky sex family, dog

496
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:59,749
Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating the shit our of niggers heads.
Okay? But that was after he fucked the heads.

497
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:03,675
Do you think they saw that shit coming? Hell no, okay?

498
00:51:03,678 --> 00:51:07,976
They were coming over there like "I'm a suck a little dick, maybe jiggle some balls or shit

499
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:11,661
No. They didn't get a chance to jiggle shit because their heads was off their bodies.

500
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:15,836
Yeah they still sucked the dick, but without their heads. It was weird detached heads shit.

501
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,243
That was Jeffrey Dahmer.

502
00:51:18,426 --> 00:51:20,296
Thanks for that image.

503
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:23,366
Hey man, I'm not making this shit up. I saw it on A & E.
That is real life.

504
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:26,563
Yo, and the black people out here too. It seems like they all missed the movement.

505
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:28,586
It's because they probably hypnotized.

506
00:51:31,066 --> 00:51:35,963
Look bro, all I'm doing is just connecting the dots. I taking what you presented to me, okay?

507
00:51:35,966 --> 00:51:40,899
I'm a tell you this. I think that mom is putting everybody in a trance and she's fucking the shit out of them.

508
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:42,193
Thanks, Rod. Bye.

509
00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:45,470
Hello.
 Fuck, hi.

510
00:51:48,946 --> 00:51:51,760
I owe you an apology.

511
00:51:52,058 --> 00:51:55,214
How rude of me to have touched your belongings without asking.

512
00:51:56,998 --> 00:51:59,810
Ah, No, it's cool. I was just confused.

513
00:51:59,813 --> 00:52:04,570
Well, I can assure you there was no funny business.

514
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,777
Allow me to explain.

515
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:11,343
I lifted your cellular phone to wipe down the dresser...

516
00:52:11,825 --> 00:52:14,649
and it accidentally came undone.

517
00:52:14,652 --> 00:52:18,764
And rather than meddle with it further, I left it that way.

518
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:21,412
How foolish of me.

519
00:52:23,285 --> 00:52:26,902
It's fine. I wan't trying to snitch.

520
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:31,653
Snitch?
- Rat you out.

521
00:52:33,913 --> 00:52:35,033
Tattle tale.

522
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:41,064
Oh, Don't you worry about that.

523
00:52:42,181 --> 00:52:43,807
I can assure you...

524
00:52:44,986 --> 00:52:46,998
I don't answer to anyone.

525
00:52:48,229 --> 00:52:49,316
Right.

526
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:55,752
All I know is sometimes, if there's too many white people I get nervous, you know?

527
00:53:33,007 --> 00:53:34,916
Aren't you something.

528
00:53:35,998 --> 00:53:39,455
That's not my experience. Not at all.

529
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:45,801
The Armitages are so good to us.

530
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,706
They treat us like family.

531
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,363
This bitch is crazy.

532
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,443
This bitch is crazy.

533
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:21,591
Hey, hang on.  Chris, I want you to introduce you to some friends.

534
00:54:21,594 --> 00:54:25,759
This is David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald and Celia Jeffries ...

535
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,178
Hiroki Tanaka and Jessika and Fredrich Walden.

536
00:54:32,044 --> 00:54:33,974
Too many names to remember, but hi.

537
00:54:35,268 --> 00:54:38,415
Do you find that being  African-American ...

538
00:54:38,418 --> 00:54:44,118
more advantage or disadvantage in the modern world?

539
00:54:46,922 --> 00:54:48,327
A tough one.

540
00:54:51,229 --> 00:54:53,656
Yeah, I don't know, man.

541
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,923
They were asking me about the African American experience. Maybe you can take this one.

542
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:12,057
I find that the African-American experience for me has been for the most part very good.

543
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,386
Although I find  it idifficult to go into detail ...

544
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:18,989
because I haven't had much desire to leave the house in a while.

545
00:55:19,878 --> 00:55:22,193
We have become home bodies.
 Yeah.

546
00:55:22,723 --> 00:55:26,832
Yes, but even when we go into the city, I just have no interest.

547
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:29,702
The chores have become my sanctuary.

548
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:46,919
Get out.

549
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:49,641
Sorry, man.

550
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:51,456
Get out!

551
00:55:52,774 --> 00:55:54,399
Yo chill...

552
00:55:54,402 --> 00:55:57,283
Chill!

553
00:56:06,927 --> 00:56:10,115
Seizures create anxiety, which can trigger aggression.

554
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:13,936
Yeah, but like randomly attacking other people?
 - It's not random.

555
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:17,692
Yeah, It was your flash. That's what set him off.

556
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,471
How is he doing?
- Much better.

557
00:56:25,304 --> 00:56:26,931
I imagine that I...

558
00:56:27,771 --> 00:56:29,586
owe you all an apology.

559
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:33,511
No, no, no we're just very happy that you're yourself again.

560
00:56:33,514 --> 00:56:35,353
Yes, yes I am.

561
00:56:35,356 --> 00:56:38,355
And I thank God for you for calming me down.

562
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:45,224
I know that I must have frightened you all quite a bit.
Especially you, Chris.

563
00:56:46,743 --> 00:56:47,839
I'm sorry.

564
00:56:48,442 --> 00:56:49,999
The flash, I didn't know.

565
00:56:50,396 --> 00:56:52,889
Of course not. How could you have?

566
00:56:52,892 --> 00:56:55,293
But you shouldn't have been drinking either.

567
00:56:56,562 --> 00:57:02,370
Well, I will have to let you all get on the rest of this night without my marvelous wit.

568
00:57:03,263 --> 00:57:06,276
The whole ordeal has made me quite a bit exhausted.

569
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,916
Why don't you just get some rest?

570
00:57:11,914 --> 00:57:14,191
It was nice meeting you, Chris.

571
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:20,296
Something to lighten the mood?

572
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:23,732
Yes. Yeah, Let's get this party back on track.

573
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:26,653
How about sparklers and bingo?

574
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:32,586
We're going go on a walk.
- Are you sure?

575
00:57:35,862 --> 00:57:37,112
Shall we?

576
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:41,669
My cousin's epileptic. That wasn't a seizure.

577
00:57:43,189 --> 00:57:46,202
My Dad is a neurosurgeon and that is what he said it was.

578
00:57:46,205 --> 00:57:48,017
I am inclined to trust ...
- That was not a seizure.

579
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,020
What was it then?

580
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:51,087
How long have you known that guy?

581
00:57:51,758 --> 00:57:54,199
I met him today. Why?

582
00:57:57,496 --> 00:57:59,504
This is going to sound weird, but ...

583
00:58:01,107 --> 00:58:02,744
when he came at me ...

584
00:58:04,223 --> 00:58:05,744
I felt like I knew him.

585
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:12,323
Like you've met Logan before? - No, not Logan, I knew the guy who came at me.

586
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,693
I think your mom got in my head, alright.

587
00:58:25,054 --> 00:58:26,541
I think she got in my head...

588
00:58:26,602 --> 00:58:29,693
Yeah, and it worked I thought.
- No, it did not.

589
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:35,829
She got in my head and now I'm thinking all this fucked up shit that I don't want to think about.

590
00:58:37,571 --> 00:58:38,749
Like what?

591
00:58:52,536 --> 00:58:54,064
I just need to go.

592
00:59:01,926 --> 00:59:03,243
You want to go.
 Hmm, mmm

593
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,097
Without me?

594
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:09,422
Whatever you want.

595
01:00:22,376 --> 01:00:24,735
I told you about that night when my mom died.

596
01:00:25,436 --> 01:00:28,454
When I didn't call 911 and didn't go out looking for her.

597
01:00:31,888 --> 01:00:36,275
One hour went by, then two ... then three ...

598
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,724
and I just sat there.

599
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:43,884
I was just watching TV.

600
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:48,911
There was nothing you could have done.
- I later found out that ...

601
01:00:50,694 --> 01:00:53,243
She had survived the initial hit.

602
01:00:58,124 --> 01:01:03,324
She lay there bleeding by the side of the road, cold and alone.

603
01:01:06,548 --> 01:01:09,656
That's how died in the early morning, cold and alone.

604
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:13,578
And I was watching TV.

605
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:20,432
There was time.
You were just a little kid. - There was time.

606
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,205
There was time.

607
01:01:23,828 --> 01:01:28,899
There was a time when somebody was looking for her. There was time, nobody, nobody, nobody was looking.

608
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:44,182
You're all I've got. I'm not going to leave here without you. I'm not going to abandon you.

609
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:50,535
You're not?
 - No, no I'm not.

610
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:04,517
Oh my God, you scared me.

611
01:02:08,633 --> 01:02:10,041
Let's go home.

612
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:12,664
What?

613
01:02:13,141 --> 01:02:15,990
Let's go home, this sucks.

614
01:02:17,684 --> 01:02:20,587
This sucks. Let's go home. I'll make something up.

615
01:02:22,974 --> 01:02:24,378
I love you.

616
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,384
Love you too baby.

617
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,552
Bye. - Come on, baby.

618
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:52,058
Good night, Chris. It was great to meet you.

619
01:03:57,523 --> 01:03:58,821
Asshole.

620
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:06,261
That's Dre. - Dre ?

621
01:04:06,264 --> 01:04:07,894
Andre Hayworth.

622
01:04:07,897 --> 01:04:10,194
Used to kick it with Veronica? - Veronica from wh...?

623
01:04:10,197 --> 01:04:12,993
Teresa's sister who worked at the movie theater on 8th.

624
01:04:12,996 --> 01:04:17,104
Yeah, that is him. But wait, wait, wait...

625
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:19,505
This is so fucking, fucking crazy...

626
01:04:20,692 --> 01:04:23,144
He's different.
- No shit!

627
01:04:23,147 --> 01:04:26,138
Why is he dressed like that?
- It's not that. It's everything.

628
01:04:26,141 --> 01:04:29,099
He came to the party with a white woman like 30 years older than him.

629
01:04:29,102 --> 01:04:30,247
Sex Slave.

630
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:37,688
Chris, you've got to get the fuck up out of there, man. You are in some " Eyes Wide Shut " situation. Leave the motherfuck...

631
01:04:38,381 --> 01:04:40,092
you gonna be a... Hello?

632
01:04:40,366 --> 01:04:44,244
Chris? His battery must have fucking died.

633
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:49,806
Hey handsome. Are you packing?
- Rose, we've got to go, we got to go now.

634
01:04:52,242 --> 01:04:53,433
Is everything okay?

635
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:56,705
I tell you in the car but we have to go right now. Okay?

636
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:59,763
Okay. Yeah. Let me go get my bag.

637
01:06:39,636 --> 01:06:44,403
Are you ready? - Yeah, I was just looking for my camera.

638
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:49,143
It's right here.

639
01:06:49,146 --> 01:06:52,466
Have you got the keys? I'm gonna put the bags in the trunk real quick.

640
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:57,144
Yeah, They' are in here somewhere. It's just a matter of finding them.

641
01:06:57,863 --> 01:06:58,987
Are you OK?

642
01:07:02,704 --> 01:07:04,392
Take me second.

643
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:09,091
What you can't find those keys?

644
01:07:09,094 --> 01:07:12,002
No. I can never find them.
- Let's do this on the move.

645
01:07:18,945 --> 01:07:21,040
Chris ...
- Let's get the keys.

646
01:07:21,784 --> 01:07:26,293
Yo man. -Where are you going? The party is just starting.
- I just put the bags in the car, man.

647
01:07:26,686 --> 01:07:30,198
Would anyone like tea? - No I'm good. We leaving, actually.

648
01:07:30,201 --> 01:07:32,581
Really? Why? Is there something wrong?

649
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:37,993
His dog got really sick, so he has to be at the vet first thing in the morning.

650
01:07:37,996 --> 01:07:41,117
Sorry. - How terrible.

651
01:07:41,869 --> 01:07:44,498
Rose, the keys.
- I'm looking.

652
01:07:59,486 --> 01:08:02,122
What is your purpose, Chris?

653
01:08:03,396 --> 01:08:04,416
What?

654
01:08:06,764 --> 01:08:09,599
In life. What is your purpose?

655
01:08:10,775 --> 01:08:14,522
Right now it's finding those keys.

656
01:08:16,014 --> 01:08:17,323
Fire.

657
01:08:18,509 --> 01:08:20,965
It is a reflection of our own mortality.

658
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:24,456
We are born, we breathe and then we die.

659
01:08:26,742 --> 01:08:28,121
I'm looking.

660
01:08:28,923 --> 01:08:31,721
Even the sun will die someday.

661
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:34,443
But we are divine.

662
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,322
We are the gods trapped in cocoons.

663
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:43,800
I don't know where they are.

664
01:08:46,007 --> 01:08:49,422
Rose, give me those keys.

665
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:52,810
Give me those keys! Rose, now, now! The keys!

666
01:08:54,706 --> 01:08:57,209
Whoa be careful bro.
- What the fuck?

667
01:08:57,681 --> 01:09:01,479
I didn't do anything.
- What the fuck is going on?

668
01:09:09,682 --> 01:09:11,275
Where are those keys, Rose?

669
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,453
You know I can't give you the keys right babe?

670
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:36,178
Come on.

671
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:50,132
Is he hurt? - Did you see him drop?

672
01:09:50,135 --> 01:09:54,717
Yes I did. Jeremy, grab his legs, please. Take him downstairs. Dean, help him.

673
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,162
I can get him alone.

674
01:09:56,165 --> 01:09:59,720
No, you can't, you've already damaged him enough.
- Okay, fuck.

675
01:10:03,982 --> 01:10:06,169
Are you ready?
- Mind his head.

676
01:10:15,765 --> 01:10:16,941
Careful.

677
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,453
You'll drop him.
- No, I'm not.

678
01:10:19,817 --> 01:10:21,234
You're not get me looking...

679
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,426
Can I help?
- Okay, that was my fault.

680
01:10:27,325 --> 01:10:29,639
You were one of my favorites.

681
01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:32,036
You hear that, Chris?

682
01:10:33,306 --> 01:10:35,265
One of her favorites.

683
01:11:00,019 --> 01:11:04,163
Hey, it's Chris, I'm either away from the phone or I just don't want to talk to you. Peace.

684
01:11:23,329 --> 01:11:27,476
Hey, it's Chris, I'm either away from my phone or I just don't want to talk to you. Peace.

685
01:11:32,282 --> 01:11:35,404
Yeah. Me too.

686
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,518
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

687
01:11:39,521 --> 01:11:43,198
Millions of Americans feel the effects of aging.

688
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:45,908
Every movement puts pressure on your joints.

689
01:11:45,911 --> 01:11:49,041
Over time, this wear can cause discomfort.

690
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:14,115
What happened to Andre Hayworth? He disappeared in Evergreen Hallow

691
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:45,192
Is there anything more beautiful than a sunrise?

692
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:55,410
I am Roman Armitage and if you're watching this, you're probably wondering what's going on.

693
01:13:55,808 --> 01:13:59,424
There's no need to worry. Let's take a walk.

694
01:14:02,749 --> 01:14:09,057
You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you enjoyed your entire lifetime.

695
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:15,262
With your natural gifts and our determination we could both be part of something greater.

696
01:14:15,393 --> 01:14:17,526
Something perfect.

697
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:26,474
The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.

698
01:14:27,385 --> 01:14:31,427
Our order has been developing it for many, many years ...

699
01:14:31,527 --> 01:14:34,830
and it wasn't until recently it was perfected ...

700
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:39,770
by my own flesh and blood.

701
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:47,338
My family and I are honored to offer it as a service to members of our group.

702
01:14:47,341 --> 01:14:52,522
Don't waste your strength. Don't try to fight it. You can't stop the inevitable.

703
01:14:52,694 --> 01:14:54,093
And who knows?

704
01:14:54,969 --> 01:15:01,240
Maybe one day you will enjoy being members of the family.

705
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,351
Behold ...

706
01:15:07,654 --> 01:15:09,258
 a coagula.

707
01:15:22,255 --> 01:15:23,485
Fuck.

708
01:15:38,761 --> 01:15:43,321
Hello, mister...?
- Williams. Rod Williams.

709
01:15:43,324 --> 01:15:45,880
TSA? - Yes Ma'am.

710
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:50,907
Well, You know all TSA issues should be brought up with the authorizing officer.

711
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:53,159
Yes, ma'am, but this is not a TSA business.

712
01:15:53,162 --> 01:15:56,750
Don't the hell call me "ma'am." Because we not going to get along.

713
01:15:57,906 --> 01:16:02,209
How can I help you, Rod Williams from the TSA?
 Alright, here it is.

714
01:16:04,747 --> 01:16:07,351
My boy Chris has been missing for two days.

715
01:16:07,641 --> 01:16:12,926
Your son is missing?
- No. Not my son. My friend. He  26.

716
01:16:12,929 --> 01:16:15,122
His name is Chris, Chris Washington.

717
01:16:18,318 --> 01:16:21,924
He left on Friday with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.

718
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,887
She is white.

719
01:16:27,478 --> 01:16:30,948
Alright, go on.
- Look, Chris was supposed to come back on Sunday, right?

720
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:33,063
And I been watching his dog, Sid.

721
01:16:34,614 --> 01:16:36,700
That's Sid.
- Cute, right?

722
01:16:37,081 --> 01:16:40,817
So Chris sent this to me from his girlfriend's parent's house .

723
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,150
You see? That's Andre Hayworth.

724
01:16:43,424 --> 01:16:45,537
Okay? Someone we knew back in the day.

725
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:49,173
Apparently he has been missing for six months in some affluent suburb.

726
01:16:49,747 --> 01:16:53,862
He don't look so missing to me.
- That's because we found him. Right?

727
01:16:53,865 --> 01:16:56,089
But Chris says he's acting real different.

728
01:16:56,204 --> 01:17:00,798
Different How?
 This dude is from Brooklyn. Huh, He don't dress like this.

729
01:17:00,801 --> 01:17:02,953
I didn't used to dress like this.

730
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:05,587
Plus he is married to a white woman twice his age.

731
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:07,971
And that would explain the clothes. Alright.

732
01:17:10,795 --> 01:17:12,463
Rod Williams, TSA.

733
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:15,558
I know, I know, I know, but I'm trying to work towards this.

734
01:17:16,409 --> 01:17:19,926
Look, What I'm about to tell you going to sound crazy. You ready?

735
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:25,877
Try me.
- I believe they've been abducting black people ...

736
01:17:26,053 --> 01:17:29,788
brainwashing them, making them work for them as sex slaves and shit.

737
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:33,041
Sorry about the shit. Sorry.

738
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,077
Hold on a second.

739
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,394
Then he sent some me some weird picture, and I like, 'Oh man, that's Andre Hayworth. "

740
01:17:44,397 --> 01:17:46,050
This dude been missing for six months, right?

741
01:17:46,053 --> 01:17:50,745
So I do all my research you know because as a TSA agent, you know you guys are detectives, I've got the same training.

742
01:17:50,748 --> 01:17:54,459
We might know more than you all sometimes because we dealing with some terrorist shit, so ...

743
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:58,612
But that's a totally different story. So I go do my detective work, right?

744
01:17:58,615 --> 01:18:01,968
and I start putting pieces together and see this is what I came up with.

745
01:18:01,976 --> 01:18:07,115
They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing them and making them slaves...

746
01:18:07,118 --> 01:18:10,413
or sex slaves, not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit.

747
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:15,577
See I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making them slaves or whatnot...

748
01:18:16,078 --> 01:18:21,843
but all I know is they already got two brothers we know and they could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already.

749
01:18:22,767 --> 01:18:24,067
What's the next move?

750
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:38,656
And don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothing for you.

751
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,157
Oh White girls, oh they get you every time.

752
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,188
Magic ain't real.

753
01:18:55,348 --> 01:18:57,342
None of this shit makes sense.

754
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:12,213
Hello?

755
01:19:15,555 --> 01:19:20,825
Hey, Rose? It's me, Rod.
- Hi.

756
01:19:22,298 --> 01:19:23,656
Where is Chris?

757
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:28,384
He left two days ago.
- He left?

758
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:32,655
Yeah. He got all paranoid and then he freaked out on me.

759
01:19:33,055 --> 01:19:36,424
And then he just got in a cab and left his phone.

760
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:41,332
Wait. You haven't seen him?
- No, he never came back here.

761
01:19:45,195 --> 01:19:49,455
I've been calling his phone a bunch of times.  Matter of fact, I even went to the police.

762
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:53,340
What did you say?
- I just said he was missing.

763
01:19:53,451 --> 01:19:55,991
Oh Good. You ...

764
01:19:57,164 --> 01:19:58,519
Let me ask you something.

765
01:19:59,681 --> 01:20:03,537
What cab company did he use to leave?

766
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,196
Oh gosh, I...

767
01:20:05,846 --> 01:20:12,208
I don't know. I guess maybe a local one or I guess he could have called an Uber.

768
01:20:12,867 --> 01:20:15,688
Wait, I am so confused.

769
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:20,188
oh sh...You confused? oh sh...okay confused, you something know, me too.

770
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:23,832
Could you hold on one second? Hold on.

771
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:29,654
You lying bitch. She is lying like a motherfucker.  I know that...

772
01:20:29,657 --> 01:20:33,502
Whew that TSA shit tingles. This motherfucker is lying.

773
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:37,289
Okay, I got you. I'm going to record your ass.

774
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:41,749
I'm going to record the shit out of you.  You talk too goddamn much. You're gonna say something.

775
01:20:42,924 --> 01:20:44,146
Record.

776
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,248
Speaker.

777
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,022
Unmute.

778
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:56,765
So last time I talked to Chris, he told me your mama hypnotized him.

779
01:20:57,983 --> 01:20:59,580
Rod, just stop.

780
01:21:04,552 --> 01:21:07,871
I know why you're calling.
- Why is that?

781
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,296
It's kind of obvious, don't you think?

782
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:13,209
What?

783
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:16,464
That there is something between us.

784
01:21:16,768 --> 01:21:19,367
No, what you talking about girl? I called you about Chris.

785
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:23,051
No, Rod, whenever we'd go out, I remember you looking at me.

786
01:21:23,054 --> 01:21:25,560
What the fuck? No, Chris is my best friend.

787
01:21:25,563 --> 01:21:29,088
Hey look, If you did something to him ..
- I know you think about fucking me, Rod.

788
01:21:29,091 --> 01:21:32,568
Ain't nobody thought about fucking you. Why would you say some stupid shit  What the...

789
01:21:32,571 --> 01:21:36,075
You ass. I didn't want to fuck you. Bye.

790
01:21:38,795 --> 01:21:43,260
God, she's so ... she's a fucking... She's ... God, She's a genius.

791
01:22:18,393 --> 01:22:20,687
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

792
01:22:23,877 --> 01:22:27,080
Hey, Chris. How's it going, buddy?

793
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:31,756
You can answer, there is an intercom in the room.

794
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:36,983
Where is Rose?
- Oh, You dirty dog.

795
01:22:38,538 --> 01:22:41,158
You're one of the lucky ones, trust me.

796
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:44,877
Jeremy's wrangling method sounds much less pleasant.

797
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:51,297
I'm supposed to answer any outstanding questions or concerns you may have so far.

798
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,088
Apparently our common understanding of the process ...

799
01:22:55,172 --> 01:22:58,686
has a positive impact on the success rate of the procedure.

800
01:23:02,959 --> 01:23:08,680
You could give a shit, right? Okay, just let me just tell you what it is?

801
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:14,881
Phase one was the hypnotism.  That's how they sedate you.

802
01:23:14,884 --> 01:23:20,909
Phase two is this. Mental preparation. It is basically a psychological pre-op.

803
01:23:23,139 --> 01:23:25,880
Pre-op?
- For stage three.

804
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:28,855
Transplantation.

805
01:23:31,803 --> 01:23:33,984
Well, partial, actually.

806
01:23:33,987 --> 01:23:39,298
The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put...

807
01:23:39,301 --> 01:23:43,110
keeping those intricate connections intact.

808
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:46,589
So you won't be gone. At least not completely.

809
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:51,003
A sliver of you will still be in there somewhere. Limited consciousness.

810
01:23:55,381 --> 01:23:58,282
You'll be able to see and hear ...

811
01:23:59,278 --> 01:24:05,515
What your body is doing, but your existence will be as a passenger.

812
01:24:09,828 --> 01:24:14,329
An audience. You will live in ...
- The Sunken Place.

813
01:24:14,802 --> 01:24:16,933
Now you're in the Sunken Place.

814
01:24:21,204 --> 01:24:24,322
Yeah. That's what she calls it.

815
01:24:24,798 --> 01:24:28,873
Now I will control the motor function, so I'll be ...

816
01:24:28,876 --> 01:24:29,908
Me.

817
01:24:31,713 --> 01:24:33,082
You'll be me.

818
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:36,331
Good, good.

819
01:24:36,599 --> 01:24:38,884
You got it quick. Good on you.

820
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:41,609
Why us?

821
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:46,057
Why black people?

822
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,150
Who knows?

823
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:58,389
People want to change. Some people want to be stronger ... faster ... cooler.

824
01:24:58,394 --> 01:25:00,525
Black is in fashion.

825
01:25:00,985 --> 01:25:05,702
But please don't lump me in with that, you know I could give a shit what color you are.

826
01:25:05,705 --> 01:25:09,979
No, what I want is deeper.

827
01:25:11,643 --> 01:25:15,346
I want your eye, man.

828
01:25:17,105 --> 01:25:19,523
I want those things you see through.

829
01:25:21,869 --> 01:25:23,488
This is crazy.

830
01:25:26,391 --> 01:25:27,526
Okay, I'm done.

831
01:31:22,914 --> 01:31:26,038
Asshole.

832
01:31:32,554 --> 01:31:33,573
You ...

833
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:36,951
Come on.

834
01:31:41,069 --> 01:31:44,728
One Mississippi, two Mississippi ...

835
01:31:45,311 --> 01:31:48,794
three Mississippi, four Mississippi ...

836
01:33:18,256 --> 01:33:22,833
911. What is your emergency?
- I'm in the house Armitage. My name is Chris.

837
01:33:22,974 --> 01:33:24,778
I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that?

838
01:33:24,781 --> 01:33:26,952
I'm in ... I'm in the Armitage ...

839
01:33:41,819 --> 01:33:45,865
No, no, no don't do it.  I just wanna go.

840
01:34:08,432 --> 01:34:09,870
Grandma

841
01:34:25,325 --> 01:34:29,203
You ruined my house.

842
01:35:12,424 --> 01:35:14,139
Get him grandpa

843
01:35:52,608 --> 01:35:53,820
Let me do it.

844
01:37:07,235 --> 01:37:08,881
I'm so sorry.

845
01:37:09,862 --> 01:37:11,199
It's me.

846
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,551
I love you.

847
01:37:18,387 --> 01:37:19,885
I love you.

848
01:38:08,496 --> 01:38:12,879
Help.

849
01:38:13,146 --> 01:38:14,651
Help me.

850
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:07,168
I told you not to go in that house.

851
01:39:12,865 --> 01:39:13,920
I mean...

852
01:39:19,853 --> 01:39:21,256
How did you find me?

853
01:39:27,084 --> 01:39:30,760
I'm TS motherfucking A.

854
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:33,163
We handle shit.

855
01:39:33,370 --> 01:39:35,375
That's what we do.

856
01:39:37,785 --> 01:39:39,684
Consider this situation ...

857
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,674
fucking handled.

858
01:40:19,509 --> 01:40:21,909
