1
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,237
- Okay, settle down.

2
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,038
Time to get started.

3
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,079
All right, can anybody tell me,

4
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,048
what are the zeros
of each function?

5
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,385
Come on, we've been learning
this for like a week.

6
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,187
Somebody?

7
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,288
Clair?

8
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,290
- The zeros of a given
function F are the solutions

9
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,725
to the equation F x equals zero.

10
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,461
- Now let's
look at problems

11
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,130
with two pairs of brackets.

12
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:48,169
We can simplify by
regrouping the brackets

13
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,471
and then grouping over here.

14
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,740
- Fuckin' asshole!
- Oh!

15
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,075
- Principal, now!

16
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:57,844
- This is quite a record.

17
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,116
Your very first day in my
school, and here we are.

18
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,422
Transfers from seven
different schools.

19
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,225
And you have no frustrations?

20
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,475
- Here, yes, yes.

21
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,152
- I think
you can do this now.

22
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,186
- I got this.

23
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,188
That goes there.

24
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,089
- You sure about this?

25
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,257
- Yeah, just do it.

26
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,525
- You want small
letters or caps?

27
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,492
- Uh, caps.

28
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:23,830
- You're home?

29
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:24,531
- Hi, Mom.

30
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,136
- How was your
first day at school?

31
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:29,902
- Good.

32
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,872
- It's a farther bus ride
than your other school,

33
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,477
but maybe at this one,
you'll start fresh, hmm,

34
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,412
make some new friends.

35
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,414
- Sure, don't see why not.

36
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,349
Might even try out
for cheerleading.

37
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,520
- Really?

38
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,290
- Sure, and next, I'll go
out for homecoming queen.

39
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,560
- Don't you want to fit in?
- Mom, I fit in.

40
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,597
I just haven't found the
people I fit in with yet.

41
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,399
- Well, honey, maybe if
you didn't look like that,

42
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,401
it would be easier for
you to make friends, huh?

43
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,436
- I don't want these
kids as friends.

44
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,870
- What's wrong with them?

45
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:04,571
- Nothing.

46
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,610
Ma, okay, nothing.

47
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,278
- Don't take that.

48
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,247
- Why?
- It's Bill's.

49
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,348
- Really?

50
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,316
I don't see his name anywhere.

51
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,384
- He likes a Coke, first
think in the morning.

52
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:20,187
- Well, how 'bout I like a
Coke, last thing at night?

53
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,355
- Just put it back, okay?

54
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,256
- Why should I?

55
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,923
- 'Cause I said so.

56
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,896
- How come you always
stick up for him, huh?

57
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:30,930
Why never me?

58
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,300
- Good night.

59
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,535
- What?

60
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,536
You're afraid if he doesn't
have his Coke in the morning,

61
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,204
he'll hit you again?

62
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:41,508
- Casey, who I choose as my
boyfriends is my business.

63
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,011
My business alone!
- Fine, we'll have a big blast

64
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,312
when this one splits.

65
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,413
That is, unless you
have enough money

66
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,648
to keep him fed enough to stay.

67
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,017
Let's just hope we don't
run out of money first!

68
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,555
- Casey.

69
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,023
- Marge!

70
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,624
- I know where
you got that from!

71
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,929
- I want this bitch gone, now.

72
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,565
Her or me, Marge, you
fuckin' choose it,

73
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,301
but I'm not puttin' up
with her shit anymore.

74
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,635
I treat you good.

75
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,903
I don't give a fuck
what that tramp says.

76
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,941
- Bill!

77
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:15,609
Bill.

78
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,453
- What the fuck!

79
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,654
- It means you're cool!

80
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:08,589
- Yeah!

81
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,592
- Only dead is cool!

82
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,115
- Whatever it is, tell her no.

83
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,653
- Hello.

84
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,754
- Mom, I'm leaving.

85
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,490
I'm not coming home.

86
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,460
- I see.

87
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,196
- Ma, I just can't stand
it, Bill or whatever.

88
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,731
I just don't want to come back.

89
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,468
- Well, maybe that's right.

90
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,540
You always said you
wanted to see California.

91
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,611
Honey, I'm sorry.

92
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,680
I, I didn't mean it like that.

93
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,650
It's just things
are so hard here.

94
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:22,696
So I've called your father,

95
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,399
and he'll be at the
station to pick you up.

96
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,501
He says he's excited to see you.

97
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,636
- If he's
so excited to see me,

98
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,438
how come I never came to visit?

99
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,539
He never called.

100
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,507
Never nothing.

101
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,541
- Maybe he did in the beginning.

102
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,442
Who remembers?

103
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,545
I mean, he moved on.

104
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,414
He got his own life,

105
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,583
new family, new
everything, so...

106
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,752
- How many kids again?

107
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:48,755
- Three daughters.

108
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,630
- I love you, Mom.

109
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,864
- Love you, too.

110
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,492
Bye!

111
00:11:58,985 --> 00:11:59,953
- Let's go.

112
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,889
- Dad, I'm hungry.

113
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,758
- Heather, quiet.

114
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,926
I told you we'd be late.

115
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:06,927
See? And the train
already got here.

116
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,295
- We wouldn't have been late

117
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,730
if you took the 5
like I told you.

118
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,599
You, no, but you
had to take the 101,

119
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,036
when any idiot knows that
the 101 takes forever.

120
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,003
- What a dork!

121
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,404
You know she could've
waited for us, at least.

122
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,772
- Now what am I supposed to do?

123
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,307
- Yeah, maybe she
changed her mind.

124
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,875
She decided not to come.

125
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,011
- Dad, I want a cheeseburger!

126
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,779
- I'm so hungry, please.

127
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,348
- 500,000 more calories.

128
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,950
Okay, we're leaving.
This place sucks.

129
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:30,884
- After Marge called me and
all, she's not gonna show?

130
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,386
- Look, they probably
got into a fight.

131
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,921
- Can I go to Eva's
house after, as well?

132
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,690
- She probably threatened
to come see you,

133
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:37,791
and then they patched things
up, and she's still in Ohio.

134
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,727
- You think? Well, I should
at least call, right?

135
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,996
- Eddie, would you
just call from home?

136
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,997
- Okay, you're
right. You're right.

137
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:44,931
She probably didn't come.

138
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,367
- You know, you have
three kids of your own.

139
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,403
Since when did we become a motel
for other women's children?

140
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,940
Eddie, come on, let's go.

141
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,976
You wanted to watch
the game, right?

142
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,910
Come on.

143
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,644
- Oh yeah, her dad
called this morning.

144
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,013
It's on the machine. I forgot.

145
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,514
- Oh, did he say what he wanted?

146
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,449
- I forget.

147
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,818
Probably just to
say she got there.

148
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,754
But you spoke to her,
so you know that, right?

149
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:48,922
- Right.

150
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:49,823
He's blocked well

151
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,092
and tries to cut
through the middle, oh!

152
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:16,870
- Who are you?

153
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:19,939
- Nobody much.

154
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:22,575
My name is Samuel.

155
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:27,747
- Were you watching me?

156
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,083
- I suppose I was.
- Why?

157
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,354
- Well, I said to
myself, look who's here,

158
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,921
a little girl sleeping.

159
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,890
I wonder if she's lost.

160
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,360
Should I awaken her before I go?

161
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,694
No, I don't think so.

162
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,667
Sit your old bones
down and wait.

163
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,668
- Wait for what?

164
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,604
- To learn your name.

165
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:54,774
- That's all you want?

166
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:58,645
- I haven't much interest
in anything else.

167
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,947
- Yeah, I've heard
that shit before.

168
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,983
- Please, please, I don't like
to hear language like that.

169
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:09,689
So tell me, we were
discussing your name.

170
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,025
- Come on, cut the crap!

171
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:13,127
If you're looking for
money, I haven't got any.

172
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,829
- Money is not as
interesting as people think.

173
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,132
- It is when you don't have any.

174
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:19,599
- You don't have any?

175
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,703
But you have a name, no?

176
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,874
- Casey.

177
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,776
- Ah, and
your last name?

178
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,045
- I don't have a last name.

179
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:32,679
- Interesting.

180
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,782
I've never met anyone
who had no last name.

181
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,418
- Well, then I guess you've
never met anyone before

182
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,918
who hates their parents, huh?

183
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,893
- Would you like another?

184
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,195
- You mean fries?

185
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:49,762
- Anything.

186
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,698
- I don't want to be greedy.

187
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,201
- When you are hungry,

188
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,904
there's no such word as greedy.

189
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:02,109
- Um, then can I have
another cheeseburger?

190
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:05,179
- Lena!

191
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:12,453
A repeat, if you wouldn't mind.

192
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,887
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

193
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,023
What a fat ass.

194
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:21,162
- It is generally considered
rude to be insulting

195
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:23,930
to the hand that
brings you your food.

196
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,698
- So? She didn't hear me.

197
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,136
- A thought is as
powerful as a word.

198
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:33,773
It can affect
longer and stronger.

199
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:34,475
- Well, if you don't
care what I have to say,

200
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,476
then don't listen to me.

201
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,710
- What do you care about?

202
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:40,880
- Shit.

203
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,818
- I interpret that to mean
all you care about is feces?

204
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,923
- Don't be an idiot.

205
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,859
- But then I don't understand.

206
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,296
- It means I don't
care about anything.

207
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:58,898
- Well, that's too bad.

208
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,767
- What's so bad about it?

209
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,137
- Well, if one has so
little purpose in life,

210
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,938
there's no reason to live.

211
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:07,174
- What do you care about?

212
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,045
- Possibly less than you.

213
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:12,845
- So why don't you
just kill yourself?

214
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,981
- I never leave a party early.

215
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:16,849
- You call this crap a party?

216
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,188
- Unfortunately, it's
the only party I have.

217
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:24,191
Thank you.

218
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,534
So, where are you off to?

219
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,501
- I don't know.

220
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,903
- You're just going to
go off like that, poof?

221
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,838
- You know, it's not like
I'm following your or shit.

222
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,007
I'm just hanging.

223
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,276
- No, no, no, I'm
not judging you.

224
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,012
- Why you gotta talk like that?

225
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:46,080
- Like what?

226
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,248
- You talk phony-like.

227
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:49,250
- Oh, I beg your pardon.

228
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:50,984
- Are you a foreigner?

229
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:52,752
An illegal immigrant thing?

230
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,991
- I'm a naturalized
American citizen,

231
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,562
just like you.

232
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:05,032
Some people are just
very fortunate, eh?

233
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:07,134
Huh?
- I guess. I don't know.

234
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:11,138
You monster!

235
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:16,577
- What's their problem?
- You be careful.

236
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,012
You be careful what you-
- What the fuck's

237
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:18,945
their problem?
- Stop your pointing at her!

238
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,547
- Why you go here?
- You want something?

239
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,016
You talk to me.
- Go away, you stupid!

240
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:24,351
- Hey, you talk to
me, you hear me!

241
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,990
- What the fuck's their problem?

242
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:34,028
- They were unhappy
about the swastika.

243
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,329
- My what?

244
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,131
- The swastika on your back.

245
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,167
- What about it?

246
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,071
- It's something they
associate with Adolf Hitler.

247
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:46,340
- That sign on my back,
that just means fuck off.

248
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:50,611
- Yeah, there are a lot
of people who disagree

249
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,279
with that interpretation.

250
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,349
- And why do they
wear those beanies?

251
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:56,983
- As a reminder.

252
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:58,419
- A reminder of what?

253
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:02,356
- That God is above all.

254
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,197
- Is this where you live?

255
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,931
- You'll grow accustomed to it.

256
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:15,436
The offer still stands.

257
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:18,639
- You mean I can just take
a bath here, and that's it?

258
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:19,906
- What else would there be?

259
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:20,873
- No monkey stuff?

260
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:28,415
- First, you flatter an old man.

261
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:34,254
Second, I invite you as a
guest, not a prostitute.

262
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:46,133
Let me go get my mail.

263
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:50,270
Where are you?

264
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:04,485
This is home.

265
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:05,419
Come!

266
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:25,439
- Wow, it's nice in here.

267
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,145
How long have you lived here?

268
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:33,046
- A long time.

269
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:36,450
Here.

270
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:40,320
Let me show you the bedroom.

271
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:45,058
There, you can get
yourself cleaned up.

272
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:29,496
Ah.

273
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,300
- Hey.

274
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,836
- You drink coffee, huh?

275
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,605
There's a drawer under the sink.

276
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,475
It's got a new toothbrush.

277
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:43,243
I'll keep your coffee warm.

278
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:33,226
Get a chair, in the closet there

279
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,301
Come on, come on.

280
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:46,173
The food is getting cold.

281
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:54,748
- Was that you in the
picture over the sink?

282
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:55,682
- It is.

283
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,218
- Who's the lady?

284
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,388
- That was Rhea.

285
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:02,289
- Who's that?

286
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:03,223
- My wife.

287
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,327
- Oh yeah, what happened?
You divorce her?

288
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:09,663
- Never.

289
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:12,299
She's dead.

290
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:17,471
- Oh, um, shit, sorry.

291
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:18,839
- Coffee?

292
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:20,307
- Yeah.

293
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:24,711
She, she looked pretty.

294
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:27,247
- Rhea?

295
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,281
Nah, pretty?

296
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:30,617
She was beautiful.

297
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:33,720
- How'd she die?

298
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:36,356
- Step by step.

299
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,359
- Oh.

300
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:45,265
- How did you meet her?

301
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:45,832
- In Germany.

302
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:49,703
- Oh, really, you lived there?

303
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:52,506
- Well, it's not
easy to live there,

304
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:55,876
not as possible
as you may think.

305
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:57,411
- What's that mean?

306
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:02,582
- Nazis make bad company.

307
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,285
- Did you fight with them?

308
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,320
- They fought with me.

309
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,292
What is funny, eh?

310
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:16,396
- The whole six
million dead Jew shit.

311
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,631
- What?

312
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,400
- That's not true.

313
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:22,369
- Oh, really?

314
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:24,838
- They just made it up,
'cause Jews are liars.

315
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:27,774
- How do you know that?

316
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,378
- My mom told me.

317
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:33,613
- Oh, your mom told you.

318
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:36,316
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm, boy.

319
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,317
- When I first heard about it,

320
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,385
I was like how gross, you know?

321
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:39,519
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

322
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:40,654
- Like burning people.

323
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:42,422
- Yeah?
- Making lampshades

324
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:45,325
out of their skin.
- Oh yes, yes!

325
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:46,660
- So then, I thought how gross.

326
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:47,694
- Mm-hmm.
- Right, so I told my mom

327
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,930
what the teacher said.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:52,332
- And she set me straight.

329
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:53,767
- How'd she do that?

330
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,603
- She was like, yeah, some
Jews died, like any war,

331
00:28:56,636 --> 00:28:58,338
but six mil, no way.

332
00:28:58,371 --> 00:28:59,573
- Yeah.

333
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:01,575
Well, I'll tell you
a little something.

334
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:03,777
Your mom is wrong.

335
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:08,482
I was almost one
of the six million.

336
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:12,786
- You're a Jew?

337
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:13,954
- You're so shocked?

338
00:29:15,622 --> 00:29:20,627
- Uh, I've never, I've
never spoken to one before.

339
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:24,731
- So this is a red letter
day for you, isn't it, huh?

340
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:25,899
Whoop-de-doo!

341
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:33,640
- Do you want me to clean up?

342
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,642
- No, no, no, no, you are guest.

343
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:36,877
I'll do the cleaning up.

344
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,545
- Yeah, well, when
people say that,

345
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:39,713
they don't usually mean it.

346
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:42,783
- Well, when I say it,

347
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,751
you could be sure I mean it.

348
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:48,488
- Uh, so I guess I'll split.

349
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:49,689
- Why?

350
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:53,493
- Thanks, you know, for the
bath and the food and stuff.

351
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:56,630
- Hey, anytime you want
a bath, you're welcome.

352
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:02,736
- Were those two babies
in the picture your kids?

353
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,571
- They are.

354
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:05,639
- Where do they live?

355
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:08,675
- They don't.

356
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,679
- You mean they died?

357
00:30:12,712 --> 00:30:13,613
- Yes.

358
00:30:15,682 --> 00:30:17,651
- An accident or something?

359
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:22,689
- Ah, I suppose Jewish twins
could be called an accident,

360
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:29,663
especially if it's during a war.

361
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:41,042
- Well, well,
take it easy, okay.

362
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:42,642
- What?

363
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:43,376
- Take it light.

364
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:45,912
- What does that mean?

365
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,849
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.

366
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:50,584
- Yeah, understood.

367
00:30:53,087 --> 00:30:56,556
Bedbugs bite.

368
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:13,867
- Hey!

369
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:16,103
- Hey.

370
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,804
- Uh, how much?

371
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:20,174
- Uh, 50.

372
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:23,810
- 40?

373
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:24,978
- 45 now, or forget it.

374
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:26,213
- Okay, Jesus.

375
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,718
And turn that shit off.

376
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,698
Oh, of course.

377
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:53,240
And I'll let you
finish this part.

378
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:03,017
Let's get this party
started, right now.

379
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:06,686
Okay.

380
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:33,740
- Hey!

381
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:36,343
Hey!

382
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:40,713
- Oh shit!

383
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:43,350
- Give that back,
you bastards! Hey!

384
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:48,888
- Casey!

385
00:34:49,823 --> 00:34:50,357
Casey!

386
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,932
- Come on!

387
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:00,900
- Fuck you little fuckers.

388
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,374
I mean, it's not like
I like it or anything,

389
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:08,875
the massage stuff
and everything.

390
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,778
It's just that,
'cause of my age,

391
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:13,847
I can't get working papers
without my parents signing off,

392
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,782
and like, since I,
obviously, I can't do that,

393
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:16,950
what else was I supposed to do?

394
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:19,386
I mean, the only jobs they
had are some immigrant crap,

395
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,888
but the guys wanted me
to fuck 'em anyways,

396
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,790
so I figured, hey,
like this is better,

397
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:25,292
and I only have to use my hand.

398
00:35:25,326 --> 00:35:26,960
And the way I look at it,

399
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:28,962
Arabs wipe their ass with
their left hand anyways.

400
00:35:30,364 --> 00:35:33,033
Oh, shit.

401
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:34,401
I know that hurt.

402
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:39,106
- Well, it certainly
didn't feel good.

403
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,774
- I guess we do have
something in common.

404
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:42,909
- Oh?

405
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:44,011
- Hm.

406
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:51,118
- What is the significance
of that slogan?

407
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:56,056
- I always know that
I said it first,

408
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:59,326
even if they think
they said it first.

409
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,227
I know I did.

410
00:36:01,195 --> 00:36:02,096
- Hmm.

411
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:07,401
So how does Christmas in
Los Angeles feel to you?

412
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:10,137
- Um, it sucks.

413
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,305
- Hmm.

414
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:12,373
- Just like every
other Christmas.

415
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:13,374
- Uh-huh.

416
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:14,941
- But I guess it's better here,

417
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:17,178
'cause I don't have
stupid cornball gifts.

418
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:20,181
- Well, who gives you
these cornball gifts?

419
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:21,115
- My mom.

420
00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:22,316
- Ah.

421
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,085
- And whatever stupid ass
boyfriend she has at the time.

422
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,220
Like, one year, I remember,

423
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:29,456
I heard my mom tell her
boyfriend to get me a gift.

424
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,125
She gave him 20 bucks,

425
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:33,394
and he ended up blowing
the money on himself.

426
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:34,827
- Oh.

427
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:36,197
- I opened the
present, next morning,

428
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,132
and it was bubble bath
from her bathroom.

429
00:36:38,165 --> 00:36:39,266
- Oh my God.

430
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:43,404
- You have any cool family
traditions you do for Christmas?

431
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:47,408
- No, it's, uh, a
normal day to me.

432
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:50,244
I have no family.

433
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:51,145
- None?

434
00:36:51,178 --> 00:36:52,112
- None.

435
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:54,981
- They all died on you?

436
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:56,283
- Yeah, yeah.

437
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:58,185
- Left you to carry
this shit alone?

438
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:02,889
- I thought that was
rather rude of them myself.

439
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:04,358
Mm-hmm.

440
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:16,337
- Any kids?

441
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:18,938
- Two.

442
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:21,275
- How old?

443
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:23,410
- Pamela's
your age. She's 21.

444
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:24,478
David's 15.

445
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:29,149
- Why aren't you with
them on Christmas?

446
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:31,318
- Hey, is this a massage
or a therapy session?

447
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:35,055
- I just thought you
might've wanted to talk,

448
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:36,323
for a while, first.
- We're not dating.

449
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:38,058
This is a one-off, right?
- I know.

450
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:39,460
It's just, um, kind of hard

451
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:41,961
for some guys to say
that they want to talk,

452
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:46,467
so then they come here,
but, you know, then-

453
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,402
- I'm not very good
at conversation,

454
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,372
especially not with my kids.

455
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,974
- Have you tried?
- I try.

456
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:57,544
I try at home. I
try with my wife.

457
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,413
I try with my kids.

458
00:38:01,248 --> 00:38:02,216
I try all the time.

459
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,318
I'm sick of trying.

460
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,489
But here I am. I have to try.

461
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:12,293
Merry Christmas.

462
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:17,598
- Uh, yeah, uh, merry Christmas.

463
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:35,516
- SOCO operator.

464
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:37,384
- Collect from Casey.

465
00:38:37,418 --> 00:38:39,153
Unless a guy answers,
then hang up.

466
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,291
- Hello?

467
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:45,092
- Collect
call from Casey.

468
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:45,659
Do you accept?

469
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:48,095
- Yes, yes, yes, I will.

470
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:50,431
Casey?

471
00:38:50,464 --> 00:38:51,365
- Mom.

472
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,269
- Honey, I was
hoping you'd call today.

473
00:38:55,302 --> 00:38:57,338
You know, today's the first
Christmas we ever spent

474
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,206
apart from each other.

475
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,208
- Yeah, I know, oh,
merry Christmas.

476
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:02,309
- You haven't called
in three weeks.

477
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:03,510
Is everything okay?

478
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:05,112
- Yeah, everything is great.

479
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:08,449
Um, Dad, he took me
shopping, to, to The Grove.

480
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:10,517
He said I could get anything.

481
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:11,984
- What'd you get?

482
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,188
- I got, uh, two pairs
of designer jeans,

483
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:17,191
one with rips in 'em,
you know, the cool kind,

484
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:19,460
and one super
skinny and stretchy.

485
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:20,461
- Isn't that great?

486
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:23,197
And school?

487
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,131
- There's no school,
right now, Mom.

488
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:25,466
It's Christmas break.

489
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:26,400
- Right.

490
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:28,135
Did you have midterms?

491
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:29,636
- Yeah, aced them all.

492
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,038
- Casey!

493
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,209
You know, I was, I was worried

494
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:38,278
that maybe this wasn't the right
thing for you, but I think,

495
00:39:38,312 --> 00:39:41,448
I think sending you to Los
Angeles was the right move.

496
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:44,351
- Yeah, uh, sure.

497
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:47,254
Well, um, listen, um,

498
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:49,390
I, I know this is
a lot of money,

499
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:52,159
long distance and
everything, so, um, I just,

500
00:39:52,192 --> 00:39:53,660
and I'm really sorry
about breaking the phone,

501
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:56,063
so I just wanted to
say merry Christmas,

502
00:39:56,096 --> 00:39:58,031
and I'll call you later, okay.

503
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:01,268
- Okay, honey, just,
um, just one more thing.

504
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:02,369
Did you make those, uh,

505
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:05,205
those apple pies like I
taught you to, for dinner?

506
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,143
- Yes, I made all three of them,

507
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:11,245
apple, strawberry, and pumpkin.

508
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:14,415
- Well,
that'll go over big.

509
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:16,617
- Yeah,
um, I love you, Mom.

510
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:19,086
- Love you too.

511
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:22,423
- Bye.

512
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:30,230
- I thought it would be
nice if you had some company

513
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,501
on your first
Christmas Eve in L.A.

514
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:36,603
- Thank you.

515
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,105
- All right.

516
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:39,640
- I didn't get you anything.

517
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:42,176
- Well, if you'll have
dinner with me, tonight,

518
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,378
that will be present enough.

519
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:45,579
- You're cooking?

520
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:48,649
- I don't think the
experts would call it cooking.

521
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:52,119
But I can guarantee
you plenty of food.

522
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:00,461
I hope you like it.

523
00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:01,395
- Yeah.

524
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:04,531
But, um, why'd you
get me something

525
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:07,267
when you knew I didn't
get you anything?

526
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:10,170
- What does one
thing have to do with another?

527
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:12,639
- You think it's just okay

528
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:15,242
to get someone
something, like a gift,

529
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:16,310
and not expect anything from it?

530
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:19,480
- Yes, and that's the
way it should be, always.

531
00:41:19,513 --> 00:41:20,380
- It's cool.

532
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:21,348
- Yeah.

533
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:24,117
- But, um, what is it?

534
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:25,652
- It's a necklace, of course,

535
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:27,354
but it's a heart.

536
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:33,260
- Yeah, but why is it a heart?

537
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:35,395
- Well, you have one, don't you?

538
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,331
- Doesn't everybody?

539
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:38,265
- No.

540
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:40,534
Aren't you going to put it on?

541
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:43,604
- Uh, I think I'm just gonna
hold it for a while, okay?

542
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:45,339
- It certainly is.

543
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:51,712
So you didn't hear
from your father

544
00:41:51,745 --> 00:41:54,414
after you saw him at
the train station?

545
00:41:54,448 --> 00:41:55,616
- Nah.

546
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:56,717
- Hmm.

547
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,285
And your mother still believes

548
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:00,554
that you are living
with your father?

549
00:42:00,587 --> 00:42:01,722
- She pretends she does,

550
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,690
so she doesn't have to deal,

551
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:06,293
so she can pretend
everything's hunky-dorky groovy

552
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:08,395
and just stick to her lame shit.

553
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:10,497
- You know where he lives?

554
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:12,399
- Yeah, some shit
end of The Valley.

555
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,569
- You have the address?

556
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:16,737
- Yeah, so?

557
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:21,508
- Maybe you should
be his Christmas
present, tomorrow, huh?

558
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:27,481
Are you afraid of going?

559
00:42:27,514 --> 00:42:28,582
- I'm not afraid of shit?

560
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:31,318
- Everybody's
afraid of something.

561
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:32,486
- Yeah, well, not me.

562
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,721
- Ah, my goodness.

563
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:37,224
- Okay, so what if I
was scared of going?

564
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:38,225
- Uh-huh.

565
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,727
- Like, scared of how he
would act or something?

566
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:44,765
- Then I would
embrace the tiger.

567
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:46,500
- Huh?

568
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:48,769
- It's a Chinese
saying for learning

569
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:51,238
to love our fears, our demons.

570
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:53,774
- What for?

571
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:55,776
- Taking the tiger within us

572
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,745
and becoming its master

573
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:02,516
so that you are in
control of them,

574
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:03,784
and they, not you.

575
00:43:05,886 --> 00:43:06,820
- What bullshit!

576
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:10,791
- Perhaps, but it works.

577
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:12,793
- So you're saying you're
scared of something,

578
00:43:12,826 --> 00:43:14,761
and then after this
tiger thing, you're not?

579
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:16,763
- Somewhat like that, yes.

580
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:17,664
- Of what?

581
00:43:18,532 --> 00:43:20,467
What could you
possibly be scared of?

582
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,602
- Of you.
- Me?

583
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,605
- Of your ignorance.

584
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,240
And not just your ignorance,

585
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:30,510
but the ignorance all
over in the world.

586
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,750
- I got it!

587
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:21,354
- Is this Eddie Miller's house?

588
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:22,556
- Yeah.

589
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:23,990
- Can you tell him Casey's here?

590
00:45:24,025 --> 00:45:25,392
- Who?

591
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:25,959
- Casey.

592
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:28,562
- Dad!

593
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:29,830
Dad!

594
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:30,797
- What?

595
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:32,566
- Dad, she's here!

596
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,467
- Who's here.

597
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,402
- That girl.

598
00:45:37,704 --> 00:45:38,872
- Hi, can I help you?

599
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:41,942
- I, I would've
brought something.

600
00:45:41,975 --> 00:45:45,479
I didn't know I was coming
until I actually got here.

601
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:46,780
- You sure you're
at the right place?

602
00:45:46,813 --> 00:45:47,948
Who are you looking for?

603
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:49,983
- I'm Casey.

604
00:45:51,518 --> 00:45:52,519
- Eddie!

605
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:54,955
Come on, it's getting cold.

606
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:56,456
- Ah, come on in.

607
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:05,665
Um...

608
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:07,834
Okay.

609
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:17,978
Everyone, this is Casey,
my, uh, my daughter.

610
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:21,448
Casey, this, this
is my wife, Linda.

611
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:23,817
My daughters Zoe, Heather,

612
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,852
and Stephie, who you met before.

613
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:29,556
Are you hungry, Casey?

614
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:32,659
I'll get you a chair.

615
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:37,497
We could, uh, all
just maybe move down.

616
00:46:38,832 --> 00:46:39,733
- Hi.

617
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:42,636
Okay.

618
00:46:47,507 --> 00:46:49,843
Hi.

619
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:50,777
Thanks.

620
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,049
- So how ya been?

621
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:58,985
- Good.

622
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,854
- Uh-huh.
- What grade are you in?

623
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:05,592
- Ninth, maybe.

624
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,028
Mm, the food's real good.

625
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:08,762
- Hmm, thank you.

626
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:14,935
- And, and your mom,
how's she doing?

627
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:16,770
Is she good, too?

628
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:18,839
- Yeah.

629
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:20,874
She's good.

630
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,078
- Do you always dress like that?

631
00:47:25,046 --> 00:47:26,113
- Like what?

632
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:28,648
- Do I have to share
a room with her?

633
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:31,685
- Dad, I just got a new room.

634
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:33,753
I'm not sharing it, and
I'm not giving it up.

635
00:47:33,787 --> 00:47:34,688
- I will.

636
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:35,789
Do you like hide and seek?

637
00:47:35,822 --> 00:47:36,923
- Mom.

638
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:38,892
- Girls, it'll
get handled, okay?

639
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,998
So, Casey, this is quite a
surprise, after all this time.

640
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:48,735
What made you change
your mind about coming?

641
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:49,669
- Um,

642
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:52,106
something about a tiger.

643
00:47:55,842 --> 00:47:58,079
- Hey, looks like we're
having a little slumber party.

644
00:47:58,112 --> 00:48:00,881
- I still get to keep
the top, don't I?

645
00:48:01,915 --> 00:48:03,017
- Uh, no prob.

646
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:06,120
- Uh, so do you want to borrow
a pair of Zoe's pajamas?

647
00:48:08,122 --> 00:48:09,789
- Nah, I'm good, thanks.

648
00:48:09,823 --> 00:48:11,892
- Okay, well, then I will
leave you girls to it.

649
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:13,060
Good night, princess.

650
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:16,063
Good night, Casey.

651
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:19,599
I'll see you in
the morning then.

652
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:38,085
- You know, my mom told me.

653
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,653
- Told you what?

654
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:41,122
- All about your mom,

655
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:43,823
how she's drunk and a weirdo,

656
00:48:43,857 --> 00:48:45,859
also how she got
arrested for DPI.

657
00:48:45,892 --> 00:48:46,826
- DUI.

658
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,928
- Whatever.

659
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:50,664
She also once went
to welfare and-

660
00:48:50,697 --> 00:48:51,198
- How old are you?

661
00:48:51,232 --> 00:48:52,766
- 13.

662
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:56,037
- Oh, too bad, you won't
know until you're 14.

663
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:56,970
- Know what?

664
00:48:57,904 --> 00:48:59,073
- How to shut the fuck up.

665
00:49:06,913 --> 00:49:08,049
- You saw the girl.

666
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:10,750
She's trash.

667
00:49:11,918 --> 00:49:13,120
Do you have any idea what kind

668
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:16,023
of influence she's
gonna have on our girls?

669
00:49:16,057 --> 00:49:16,957
- She's a kid.

670
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,725
- Yes, she's a bad kid.

671
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,695
You can see it
all over her face.

672
00:49:21,728 --> 00:49:23,763
- Oh, come on, you
can't see shit.

673
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:29,736
- Eddie,
there is no way that

674
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:31,738
that girl will fit in
here with our lives,

675
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,640
no way, no how.

676
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:34,342
Besides, you've
never even been sure

677
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:36,043
that she's yours anyway, right?

678
00:49:36,077 --> 00:49:37,877
- Her mother wasn't sure.
- Yeah, well,

679
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:39,046
she doesn't look like you.
- But I think she's mine.

680
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,946
- She doesn't look like you.

681
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,082
- I think she does.

682
00:49:42,782 --> 00:49:44,651
- She's not even cute.

683
00:49:44,684 --> 00:49:45,618
- Oh!

684
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:46,920
- Wait, wait, wait.

685
00:49:46,953 --> 00:49:48,822
Are you gonna tell me
that you think she's cute?

686
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:49,823
- She's my daughter.

687
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:51,192
What am I supposed to think?

688
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:55,162
- If you saw her on the street,

689
00:49:55,196 --> 00:49:56,963
would you think she's cute?

690
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:59,733
- My God.

691
00:49:59,766 --> 00:50:01,768
Maybe, I mean if she cleaned up.

692
00:50:01,801 --> 00:50:03,837
- Just like that
mother was a tramp,

693
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,140
she's got tramp
written all over her.

694
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:10,977
I want you to tell her tomorrow
that she can't live with us.

695
00:50:11,012 --> 00:50:16,017
She's trash.

696
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:22,756
- You think
it's just okay

697
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:25,759
to get someone
something, like a gift,

698
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:26,826
and not expect anything?

699
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,862
- Yes, and that's
the way it should be.

700
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:30,197
- Yeah, but why is it a heart?

701
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:44,811
Open up!

702
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:46,846
Open up!

703
00:50:48,149 --> 00:50:49,816
Open!
- I'm coming!

704
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:51,052
I'm getting dressed.

705
00:50:52,053 --> 00:50:52,986
Wait.

706
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,121
Hold your horses.

707
00:50:55,189 --> 00:50:56,090
Don't be silly.

708
00:50:56,123 --> 00:50:57,024
- Open up!

709
00:50:57,058 --> 00:50:59,060
- I'm opening up.
What's wrong with you?

710
00:50:59,093 --> 00:51:00,261
- I hate you!

711
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:01,228
- What? What did I do?

712
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:02,896
- I hate you! I hate you!

713
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:04,265
I hate you for
making me fucking go!

714
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:06,100
- I didn't make you.
- I hate you!

715
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:07,801
I hate you!
- No, no.

716
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:09,336
- Fuck you, fuck you!
- No, no, no.

717
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,837
- Fuck you!

718
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:13,807
Fuck you, fuck you
for making me go!

719
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,341
Fuck you!

720
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:20,880
- What's wrong with you?

721
00:51:23,883 --> 00:51:25,852
Why are you doing this?

722
00:51:25,885 --> 00:51:27,188
Come here.

723
00:51:27,221 --> 00:51:28,122
Come here.

724
00:51:29,056 --> 00:51:30,291
What's wrong?

725
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:32,059
Come here.

726
00:51:32,093 --> 00:51:32,992
Come here.

727
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:35,262
My poor baby.

728
00:51:35,296 --> 00:51:36,863
- He still doesn't want me.

729
00:51:36,896 --> 00:51:38,865
- Poor little girl.
- She said I was ugly.

730
00:51:38,898 --> 00:51:41,968
- Oh, stop it. You're beautiful.

731
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:45,139
You're the pleasure
in my life, right now.

732
00:51:47,141 --> 00:51:48,242
Don't you know that?

733
00:51:51,312 --> 00:51:54,014
The world will see
your beauty, too.

734
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,198
You're up?

735
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,334
- Uh-huh.

736
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:15,069
- How are you feeling?

737
00:52:16,936 --> 00:52:17,837
- Okay.

738
00:52:19,273 --> 00:52:21,075
- Some nourishment for you.

739
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:23,010
- Thank you.

740
00:52:23,043 --> 00:52:23,943
- Casey,

741
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:29,350
I learned
little from the Nazis,

742
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:32,386
but this I did learn.

743
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:41,428
Sometimes, we get taken
away from our families,

744
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:44,431
as we both are cases,

745
00:52:44,465 --> 00:52:49,836
but then we get opportunities
to pick a new family.

746
00:52:50,371 --> 00:52:51,871
- What's that mean?

747
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:53,907
- We could be family
to each other.

748
00:52:54,908 --> 00:52:56,243
- What for?

749
00:52:56,277 --> 00:52:57,411
- What for?

750
00:52:57,444 --> 00:52:59,180
So, so what happened?

751
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:01,148
You got something better to do?

752
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:05,085
- No, but you can't
just make a family.

753
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,220
- No?

754
00:53:06,253 --> 00:53:08,455
- You're born with
one, like it or not.

755
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:10,090
- And I believe that
if you don't like

756
00:53:10,124 --> 00:53:13,027
what the cards tell you,

757
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,861
you can ask for new cards.

758
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:17,231
- Me?

759
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:20,167
Out of all the cards
in the world, why me?

760
00:53:20,201 --> 00:53:22,969
- I choose you, and
I hope you choose me.

761
00:53:24,004 --> 00:53:25,272
- You're nuts.

762
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:26,273
What for?

763
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:31,045
- 'Cause I never had a
chance to teach either

764
00:53:31,078 --> 00:53:33,180
of my daughters
how to be a lady.

765
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:35,882
- Oh, I get it.

766
00:53:35,915 --> 00:53:37,151
You want me to stop
getting piercings

767
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:40,487
and stop saying fuck and wear
stupid, little white dresses?

768
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:42,056
- Wrong.

769
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:44,958
Even if you did
all those things,

770
00:53:44,991 --> 00:53:48,162
there'd be no guarantee
that you'd be a lady.

771
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:50,964
- If you think you're
gonna change me,

772
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:52,166
you can forget about it,

773
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:54,235
because this is it.

774
00:53:54,268 --> 00:53:55,436
Okay, plenty has
tried before you,

775
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:56,970
and look where it's gotten them.

776
00:53:57,004 --> 00:53:58,072
- Oh, oh.
- Shit.

777
00:53:58,105 --> 00:54:00,174
- Are your bags all packed?

778
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:03,244
Huh?

779
00:54:03,277 --> 00:54:04,378
How many bags you got?

780
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:08,449
- None.

781
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:10,351
- None, huh?

782
00:54:10,384 --> 00:54:11,285
Okay.

783
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:13,320
- Hold on.

784
00:54:14,988 --> 00:54:17,024
If I move in,
what's the strings?

785
00:54:17,057 --> 00:54:18,125
- Only two.

786
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:19,126
- I knew it.

787
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:20,960
Handjobs and blowjobs.

788
00:54:22,196 --> 00:54:24,298
- Don't you ever
talk like that again.

789
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:26,433
Don't you even think it.

790
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:27,334
Do you hear me?

791
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:30,471
- Yeah.

792
00:54:36,143 --> 00:54:37,511
So what are the two things?

793
00:54:38,379 --> 00:54:41,181
- You take the swastika
off your jacket.

794
00:54:41,215 --> 00:54:42,349
You go back to school.

795
00:54:43,317 --> 00:54:45,152
Think of this as your room.

796
00:54:45,185 --> 00:54:47,187
- You're just gonna
give me your bed?

797
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:49,189
- I'll give you time
to think about it.

798
00:54:50,157 --> 00:54:51,158
Think it over.

799
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:23,290
- Yeah?

800
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,227
- Better?

801
00:55:28,995 --> 00:55:30,531
- Yeah. Thank you.

802
00:55:39,073 --> 00:55:40,240
- You okay?

803
00:55:40,274 --> 00:55:41,175
- Yeah.

804
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:52,152
- Come on.

805
00:55:57,424 --> 00:56:00,127
You the lady we're
supposed to talk to?

806
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,261
- Full name, please.

807
00:56:02,296 --> 00:56:03,364
- Casey.

808
00:56:03,397 --> 00:56:04,531
- Last name.

809
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:06,133
- I never use it.

810
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:08,135
- Nonetheless,
it's necessary.

811
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:10,504
- Casey Miller.

812
00:56:12,172 --> 00:56:13,273
- And you're her legal guardian?

813
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:15,376
- Casey is in my care.

814
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:17,111
- So who's
her legal guardian?

815
00:56:17,144 --> 00:56:18,312
- Her mother.

816
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:20,314
- I'm afraid she'll have to
sign you legal guardianship.

817
00:56:20,347 --> 00:56:21,415
- Why the fuck should it matter

818
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:23,050
what that bitch says or thinks?

819
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:24,284
- Casey!

820
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:25,219
Shh!

821
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:28,655
What if she doesn't
sign anything?

822
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:30,391
- Well, Casey is
considered a minor,

823
00:56:30,424 --> 00:56:33,494
and she'll be assigned over
to juvenile authorities.

824
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:34,395
- I see.

825
00:56:34,428 --> 00:56:36,096
- And I fucking don't.

826
00:56:37,164 --> 00:56:38,232
- Casey.

827
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:40,434
Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you.

828
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:41,368
Casey!

829
00:56:43,437 --> 00:56:45,439
- Fine, I won't
fucking go to school.

830
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:46,607
Fine by me!

831
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,409
- That's now what
our agreement was.

832
00:56:48,442 --> 00:56:50,344
- Okay, you heard her.

833
00:56:50,377 --> 00:56:51,678
I'm not the one
saying I can't go.

834
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:52,579
It's her.

835
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:54,081
Fuck her!

836
00:56:54,114 --> 00:56:57,151
- We heard what the
school's terms were.

837
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:59,153
We can meet them.

838
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,321
- Oh, okay, yeah, like how?

839
00:57:04,224 --> 00:57:06,593
- We'll go get permission
from your mother.

840
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:23,710
- That old man gets it up?

841
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:25,379
- Bill, would you shut up?

842
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,714
- Look, she's your daughter.

843
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:28,649
What do I care?
Do what you want.

844
00:57:28,682 --> 00:57:30,717
- I'm asking your opinion.

845
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:31,652
- A Jew?

846
00:57:33,253 --> 00:57:35,489
Sure, if she can't find any
niggers to shack up with,

847
00:57:35,522 --> 00:57:36,457
she'll be fine.

848
00:57:37,524 --> 00:57:38,525
- Hey, I'm sorry.

849
00:57:39,493 --> 00:57:42,162
- For what?
- For the crap they're saying.

850
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:56,210
- Well, it's a pleasure

851
00:57:56,243 --> 00:57:57,211
to meet both of you.

852
00:57:59,513 --> 00:58:03,150
- So, Ma, um, Samuel
wants me to live with him,

853
00:58:03,183 --> 00:58:06,420
and the school just needs
your signature for me to go.

854
00:58:06,453 --> 00:58:09,423
- What?

855
00:58:09,456 --> 00:58:11,391
You get paid or
something for this?

856
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:13,393
Some kind of foster shit thing?

857
00:58:13,427 --> 00:58:16,330
- I, I, I, I am not paid.

858
00:58:16,363 --> 00:58:17,698
- Then what's the deal?

859
00:58:17,731 --> 00:58:18,632
- Well, I,

860
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,170
I enjoy Casey's company.

861
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:27,441
And I believe that
she enjoys mine.

862
00:58:27,474 --> 00:58:28,342
- Yeah.

863
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:31,211
What's the real deal?

864
00:58:31,245 --> 00:58:33,580
- Okay, Bill, I'll
handle this, okay?

865
00:58:35,415 --> 00:58:37,518
As you can imagine,
I was very upset

866
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:38,785
to hear that Casey has not been

867
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,287
with her father.
- Bullshit!

868
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,455
You'd have to be
dead in the water

869
00:58:41,488 --> 00:58:42,523
to know I wasn't living there.

870
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:43,524
- I trusted you.

871
00:58:43,557 --> 00:58:45,192
- Fuck, you trusted me.

872
00:58:45,225 --> 00:58:47,394
You only trust me when it's
what you want to believe,

873
00:58:47,427 --> 00:58:48,562
just like always.

874
00:58:48,595 --> 00:58:49,696
As long as I said I
was going to school,

875
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,697
you didn't fucking
care what I did,

876
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:52,699
as long as I said I was going.

877
00:58:52,733 --> 00:58:54,701
So you could just relax
with it and be all fine.

878
00:58:54,735 --> 00:58:56,303
- Shut that fuckin'
trap of yours,

879
00:58:56,336 --> 00:58:57,337
before I come over there

880
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,606
and fuckin' shut it for you.
- Okay, be quiet.

881
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,642
- You gonna hit me?

882
00:59:01,675 --> 00:59:04,311
You think I'll stand
for it, like my mom?

883
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:05,646
Well, dream on, you fuck!

884
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:08,515
And when you go to sleep,
I'll goddamn kill you.

885
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:10,484
- Walk out of this. Stop that.

886
00:59:11,184 --> 00:59:13,520
- You get 'em out of this house!

887
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:14,454
- Casey!

888
00:59:16,256 --> 00:59:18,458
You want to live with this man?

889
00:59:18,492 --> 00:59:20,360
- You got something
better to offer?

890
00:59:30,537 --> 00:59:31,605
What a raw deal.

891
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:34,775
- There are worse.

892
00:59:36,376 --> 00:59:38,612
- What's the real reason you
want me to live with you?

893
00:59:40,614 --> 00:59:42,349
- A promise I made.

894
00:59:42,382 --> 00:59:43,584
- To who?

895
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:45,352
- My wife.

896
00:59:45,385 --> 00:59:46,453
- What'd you promise?

897
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:49,823
- To stop hating.

898
00:59:51,825 --> 00:59:52,859
- Hating who?

899
00:59:54,394 --> 00:59:56,396
- Everyone but her.

900
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,666
And when she was dead, there
was no one left not to hate.

901
01:00:01,301 --> 01:00:02,803
- How come you didn't hate me?

902
01:00:02,836 --> 01:00:04,471
- I did.

903
01:00:05,405 --> 01:00:06,273
- You did?

904
01:00:06,306 --> 01:00:07,407
- Mm.

905
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:11,678
Believe me, you're not as
easy to like as you may think.

906
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:13,513
- Oh.

907
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:16,383
Well, then what happened?

908
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:20,253
- God presented me
with a challenge,

909
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:21,588
that day at the graveyard.

910
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,526
If I could learn to forgive you,

911
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,296
a child with a swastika,

912
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:32,733
then perhaps I could
learn to forgive all,

913
01:00:32,766 --> 01:00:33,900
before I died.

914
01:00:35,602 --> 01:00:38,338
- Wow, heavy shit, man.

915
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:42,643
- Yeah, heavy shit.

916
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:51,318
- You think your wife
would've liked me?

917
01:00:51,885 --> 01:00:53,720
- What's not to like?

918
01:01:12,906 --> 01:01:13,440
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, that's my fault.

919
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:14,608
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

920
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:18,612
- Uh-
- My fault.

921
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,847
- Uh, thanks.

922
01:01:32,392 --> 01:01:34,661
- Make any friends at school?

923
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:36,963
- No.

924
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:39,766
- Ah, okay.

925
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:44,871
- But I didn't make
any enemies, either.

926
01:01:44,905 --> 01:01:46,406
- Oh, that's good.

927
01:01:47,574 --> 01:01:49,476
What'd you learn
at school, today?

928
01:01:49,509 --> 01:01:51,478
- Uh, algebra.

929
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:52,546
- Ah.
- I hate it.

930
01:01:54,048 --> 01:01:56,683
All these stupid a's and
b's and c's and d's crap,

931
01:01:56,717 --> 01:01:58,652
like where am I gonna use that?

932
01:01:58,685 --> 01:02:00,420
Plus, isn't that what
calculators are for?

933
01:02:00,454 --> 01:02:05,459
- Hmm, algebra doesn't teach
you how to add and subtract.

934
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:07,494
It teaches you how to think.

935
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:12,632
- So in discussing Diane
Arbus' photographs,

936
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:15,402
what can one understand
about her suicide?

937
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,638
I expect more hands
to go up here.

938
01:02:20,674 --> 01:02:21,641
Anybody?

939
01:02:23,443 --> 01:02:24,745
Casey.

940
01:02:24,778 --> 01:02:29,016
- Um, I think Diane
killed herself,

941
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:32,619
'cause God could only
understand her if she was dead.

942
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,888
- Hm, can you expand on that?

943
01:02:36,556 --> 01:02:40,527
- Well, you take a person
like her, like Diane,

944
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,563
and she only likes
people that were ugly,

945
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:46,533
you know, ugly in comparison
to pretty people and stuff.

946
01:02:46,566 --> 01:02:47,501
And because she thought

947
01:02:47,534 --> 01:02:50,037
that the ugly people
were really beautiful,

948
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:52,539
she thought that inside
she was also ugly.

949
01:02:52,572 --> 01:02:54,775
So, you know, since
everyone thinks midgets

950
01:02:54,808 --> 01:02:57,511
and stuff are ugly,
except for God,

951
01:02:57,544 --> 01:02:59,546
Diane wanted to be beautiful,

952
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:00,981
and only God would think so.

953
01:03:03,483 --> 01:03:04,451
- I see.

954
01:03:05,852 --> 01:03:07,487
- Can I ask you something?

955
01:03:08,855 --> 01:03:09,856
- Of course.

956
01:03:11,691 --> 01:03:12,926
- Do you think these people,

957
01:03:14,095 --> 01:03:15,896
these photographers,
are born different?

958
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:18,565
- What do you mean
by born different?

959
01:03:18,598 --> 01:03:19,733
- I don't know.

960
01:03:20,934 --> 01:03:21,868
Like, do you think God gave
them an extra gift or something,

961
01:03:21,902 --> 01:03:24,771
so they can show people
what stuff look like?

962
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:25,705
- No.

963
01:03:26,706 --> 01:03:30,011
I think God gives
everybody the same gifts.

964
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:32,612
Most people just
don't unwrap the gift.

965
01:03:44,524 --> 01:03:45,659
- You headin' to church?

966
01:03:45,692 --> 01:03:47,494
- Yes, to temple.

967
01:03:47,527 --> 01:03:49,663
- Oh yeah, I keep forgetting
the difference.

968
01:03:49,696 --> 01:03:51,932
- Yeah, so should everybody.

969
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:53,667
I left some dollars
on the counter

970
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,869
for you to go to the market.

971
01:03:55,902 --> 01:03:56,770
- These?

972
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:58,638
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

973
01:04:17,058 --> 01:04:17,958
- Hey.

974
01:04:18,959 --> 01:04:19,860
- Hey.

975
01:04:21,095 --> 01:04:23,064
I saw you go in, so I, uh-

976
01:04:24,065 --> 01:04:25,632
- Came in?

977
01:04:25,665 --> 01:04:26,833
- Yeah, but, you know, I,

978
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,936
I also like books
too, so.

979
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:30,871
- I like books.

980
01:04:35,076 --> 01:04:36,543
- Do you, do you
need me to take that?

981
01:04:36,576 --> 01:04:37,777
I can.

982
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:39,080
- Uh, no, I got it.

983
01:04:39,113 --> 01:04:40,647
- Well, probably, but, you know,

984
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,582
I can do it easier, so let me.

985
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:45,619
- Okay.

986
01:04:54,861 --> 01:04:55,762
Thank you.

987
01:04:58,132 --> 01:04:59,033
- Um,

988
01:05:00,034 --> 01:05:01,568
do you, do you like pizza?

989
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:04,005
- I don't know.

990
01:05:04,038 --> 01:05:05,672
- You don't know
if you like pizza?

991
01:05:05,705 --> 01:05:08,942
- I, I don't know.

992
01:05:08,975 --> 01:05:09,876
- Oh.

993
01:05:17,884 --> 01:05:18,785
- I like pizza.

994
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:39,906
- Who was that?

995
01:05:40,907 --> 01:05:41,808
- Nobody.

996
01:05:42,742 --> 01:05:44,011
- He's a good-looking nobody.

997
01:05:45,645 --> 01:05:46,180
- I can't.

998
01:05:47,148 --> 01:05:48,715
- Can't what?

999
01:05:48,748 --> 01:05:50,884
- You know, with, with,
with him, I can't.

1000
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:52,153
- You can't what? Go out?

1001
01:05:52,186 --> 01:05:55,689
- I've never
been on a date before.

1002
01:05:55,722 --> 01:05:56,923
- What about the...

1003
01:05:57,991 --> 01:05:59,060
- You mean the massage thing?

1004
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:00,660
- Yeah.

1005
01:06:01,995 --> 01:06:03,130
- That wasn't a date date.

1006
01:06:03,164 --> 01:06:04,098
That was a job.

1007
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:06,633
- Oh, well then, it
looks like you're about

1008
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:08,169
to go out on your first date.

1009
01:06:08,202 --> 01:06:09,036
- No.

1010
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,670
- Yeah, why not?

1011
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:11,671
- No way.

1012
01:06:11,705 --> 01:06:13,673
No, that is not happening.

1013
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:15,176
- Why not?

1014
01:06:17,278 --> 01:06:19,146
- What if I vomit?

1015
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,182
- Why would you vomit?

1016
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:22,716
- Nerves.

1017
01:06:22,749 --> 01:06:24,818
- What's there to
be nervous about?

1018
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:25,952
- 'Cause of everything.

1019
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:26,920
- Name one thing.

1020
01:06:28,855 --> 01:06:30,057
- I'm ugly.

1021
01:06:32,093 --> 01:06:34,195
- Yeah? Who says you're ugly?

1022
01:06:34,228 --> 01:06:35,762
- Everyone.

1023
01:06:35,795 --> 01:06:37,164
- Well, everyone is wrong.

1024
01:06:37,198 --> 01:06:39,733
- That's stupid.
Everyone can't be wrong.

1025
01:06:39,766 --> 01:06:42,869
- Oh, I can remember
a time in the world

1026
01:06:44,238 --> 01:06:46,806
when everyone was wrong.

1027
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:55,749
How does it look?

1028
01:06:57,218 --> 01:06:59,186
- I don't know.

1029
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,221
- Can I see?

1030
01:07:02,156 --> 01:07:03,057
- Not yet.

1031
01:07:04,824 --> 01:07:07,961
- Will your granddaughter
be taking the dress?

1032
01:07:07,994 --> 01:07:10,697
- She is not my granddaughter.

1033
01:07:15,735 --> 01:07:17,804
What are you doing?

1034
01:07:17,837 --> 01:07:18,705
- Hmm?

1035
01:07:18,738 --> 01:07:20,041
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1036
01:07:20,074 --> 01:07:21,208
I'm just, I'm just
lookin' around.

1037
01:07:21,242 --> 01:07:22,109
- Ah.

1038
01:07:23,244 --> 01:07:24,078
What's your name?

1039
01:07:24,111 --> 01:07:25,678
- Tony.

1040
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:26,780
- Tony, huh?
- Yeah.

1041
01:07:26,813 --> 01:07:28,082
- Sit down!

1042
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:29,183
- Oh.

1043
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:31,118
- What are you
walkin' around for?

1044
01:07:31,152 --> 01:07:32,219
- Just lookin', sorry.

1045
01:07:33,953 --> 01:07:35,256
- Yeah.

1046
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:38,825
- So, um, have you
lived here long?

1047
01:07:38,858 --> 01:07:39,592
- Long.

1048
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:42,829
- Yeah, yeah, it
seems like that.

1049
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:44,964
So, um, you know, do you
think she'll be out soon?

1050
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:46,766
- I don't see why not.

1051
01:07:47,734 --> 01:07:49,002
Yeah.
- Okay, good.

1052
01:07:49,036 --> 01:07:50,737
- She's nervous, you know.

1053
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:52,239
- About what?

1054
01:07:52,273 --> 01:07:53,140
- You.

1055
01:07:56,277 --> 01:07:57,977
- Well, why is that?

1056
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:02,183
- Well, she's not up on all
the so-called social skills.

1057
01:08:03,384 --> 01:08:04,951
- Well, I never thought about
her as socially anything.

1058
01:08:04,984 --> 01:08:08,289
I, I mean, I didn't
think about that.

1059
01:08:08,322 --> 01:08:11,092
- So why you interested in her?

1060
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,895
- I mean, she's weird.

1061
01:08:17,064 --> 01:08:18,099
- That's all?

1062
01:08:20,867 --> 01:08:23,837
- She's weird, and she's cute.

1063
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:24,938
- That's nice.

1064
01:08:24,971 --> 01:08:26,207
- I mean, I think that's as good

1065
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,375
as a reason as any, don't you?

1066
01:08:28,409 --> 01:08:31,112
- Well, I've heard
better reasons.

1067
01:08:31,145 --> 01:08:32,879
I've certainly heard worse.

1068
01:08:32,912 --> 01:08:34,781
- And I've done worse, too.

1069
01:08:34,814 --> 01:08:35,949
- What?

1070
01:08:35,982 --> 01:08:36,883
- Um, I mean, I've
done worse, too,

1071
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,219
but you don't gotta worry.

1072
01:08:38,252 --> 01:08:39,886
- I better not worry.

1073
01:08:39,919 --> 01:08:41,355
- Yeah,
not, not this time.

1074
01:08:43,823 --> 01:08:46,860
- Why don't I go see
what's keeping her?

1075
01:08:46,893 --> 01:08:48,862
What do you think? Help me up.

1076
01:08:48,895 --> 01:08:50,030
- Oh, okay, yes.

1077
01:08:51,365 --> 01:08:52,199
- Take this first.
- You want me to grab

1078
01:08:52,233 --> 01:08:53,100
the cane, okay.

1079
01:08:53,134 --> 01:08:54,368
- Yeah, then help me up.

1080
01:08:54,401 --> 01:08:56,002
- Here, let me put that,

1081
01:08:56,036 --> 01:08:56,903
right here.
- Both hands.

1082
01:08:56,936 --> 01:08:57,371
- Okay.

1083
01:08:57,404 --> 01:08:59,839
One, two, three.

1084
01:09:02,343 --> 01:09:03,310
You good?

1085
01:09:03,344 --> 01:09:04,911
- Not bad.
- Okay.

1086
01:09:04,944 --> 01:09:08,215
- Casey, you must come out.

1087
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,217
- I can't.

1088
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:11,918
- Why not?

1089
01:09:11,951 --> 01:09:14,088
- I look like a freak.

1090
01:09:17,124 --> 01:09:18,825
- You look beautiful.

1091
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:21,328
- You're lying.

1092
01:09:21,362 --> 01:09:23,897
- I'd never lie.

1093
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:26,833
- Okay, just, just,
just give me a few minutes.

1094
01:09:34,275 --> 01:09:36,177
- She's just freshening up.

1095
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,077
- Okay.

1096
01:09:48,155 --> 01:09:49,056
Wow.

1097
01:09:51,392 --> 01:09:52,393
You look, um,

1098
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,864
you look beautiful.

1099
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:03,137
You look great.

1100
01:10:11,178 --> 01:10:12,979
So the bottom line is,

1101
01:10:13,013 --> 01:10:14,081
I've been seeing you
around at school,

1102
01:10:14,114 --> 01:10:15,182
and I know that you're new,

1103
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:17,251
and I see that you don't
have much friends in the way,

1104
01:10:17,284 --> 01:10:21,255
so I figured that makes
my odds pretty good.

1105
01:10:23,023 --> 01:10:24,225
- What do you mean by odds?

1106
01:10:24,258 --> 01:10:27,161
- You know, the chance that
you'll be able to talk to me.

1107
01:10:27,194 --> 01:10:29,330
The less people that
you have to talk to,

1108
01:10:29,363 --> 01:10:32,166
the greater my chances
are of you talking to me.

1109
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:35,269
- You must have
a lot of friends.

1110
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:36,903
- I've got, uh,

1111
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:39,373
I got plenty.

1112
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:43,210
But at the same time,
I kinda got squat.

1113
01:10:44,378 --> 01:10:47,014
- Yeah, friends are
a kinda hard thing.

1114
01:10:47,047 --> 01:10:47,947
- You?

1115
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:51,918
Do you have a best friend?

1116
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:53,020
- Yeah.

1117
01:10:53,053 --> 01:10:53,920
Samuel.

1118
01:10:55,055 --> 01:10:55,989
- Samuel?

1119
01:10:56,523 --> 01:10:57,458
The old guy?

1120
01:10:57,491 --> 01:10:59,159
- Come on, he's not that old.

1121
01:11:00,194 --> 01:11:01,495
He's not.

1122
01:11:01,528 --> 01:11:02,496
- Okay.

1123
01:11:13,507 --> 01:11:14,941
- Good night.

1124
01:11:17,077 --> 01:11:19,113
- He seems like a nice boy.

1125
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:20,447
- Yeah, he's nice.

1126
01:11:20,481 --> 01:11:23,217
- Well, I think we have
to talk about something.

1127
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,052
- Talk about what?

1128
01:11:25,085 --> 01:11:28,355
- We'll talk about it
tomorrow, all right?

1129
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:31,392
Good night.

1130
01:11:31,425 --> 01:11:32,459
- Good night.

1131
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:45,539
- Casey
has some questions.

1132
01:11:45,572 --> 01:11:47,107
- No, I don't.

1133
01:11:47,141 --> 01:11:48,575
- Yes, you do.

1134
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:50,177
Ask the lady.
- No.

1135
01:11:51,445 --> 01:11:54,415
- Hey, she better get
her ass back in here,

1136
01:11:54,448 --> 01:11:56,116
before they shut us down.

1137
01:12:00,354 --> 01:12:01,555
- What was that about?

1138
01:12:01,588 --> 01:12:02,489
- Nothing.

1139
01:12:04,191 --> 01:12:07,027
What makes you think
you know everything?

1140
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:11,565
- Listen, are you capable
of taking care of a child?

1141
01:12:11,598 --> 01:12:14,535
I am not. I am too old
to raise an infant.

1142
01:12:14,568 --> 01:12:16,537
- What makes you think
I'm gonna have a kid?

1143
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:19,506
- I saw the way you
looked at that young man,

1144
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:21,542
and I saw the way
he looked at you.

1145
01:12:22,609 --> 01:12:23,910
- So?

1146
01:12:23,943 --> 01:12:26,613
- So, either you
protect yourself,

1147
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:28,582
or you'll get pregnant.

1148
01:12:28,615 --> 01:12:32,052
- Okay, what if I
just don't do any of,

1149
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:34,887
you know, those things?

1150
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:37,558
- Then that would be very good.

1151
01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:40,294
- Good.
- Good, very good.

1152
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:41,595
- And don't say you're too old.

1153
01:12:41,628 --> 01:12:42,995
I hate that shit.

1154
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,131
- Ah, come on.

1155
01:12:49,336 --> 01:12:50,237
- Do you miss it?

1156
01:12:52,272 --> 01:12:53,207
- What?

1157
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,074
- Sex.

1158
01:12:55,242 --> 01:12:57,544
- Oh, only when I
think of my wife.

1159
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:00,647
- How often is that?

1160
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:01,881
- Not often.

1161
01:13:04,284 --> 01:13:07,020
Just every minute of every hour

1162
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:12,326
of every day, not often.

1163
01:13:22,603 --> 01:13:23,537
My, my, my.

1164
01:13:25,606 --> 01:13:28,041
I've got another smooch here.

1165
01:13:29,443 --> 01:13:30,511
You hear the birds?

1166
01:13:32,813 --> 01:13:35,416
It's spring, and
they're singing my song to you.

1167
01:13:36,517 --> 01:13:37,984
It says I love you.

1168
01:13:39,553 --> 01:13:41,422
I love you so much.

1169
01:13:43,056 --> 01:13:43,956
God love you. I love you.

1170
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:57,604
- How many wars do you
think there have been?

1171
01:13:57,638 --> 01:14:00,541
- What, in history, or
whatever we know of history?

1172
01:14:01,675 --> 01:14:02,509
I don't know.

1173
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:07,047
10,000, maybe
250,000, lots of them.

1174
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,615
- That's stupid.

1175
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:09,982
- Of course.

1176
01:14:10,017 --> 01:14:11,084
- Why don't they
just talk about it

1177
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:13,020
or like flip a
coin or something?

1178
01:14:13,053 --> 01:14:15,189
- You don't understand
mankind, do you?

1179
01:14:16,723 --> 01:14:19,760
- Man is generated by greed.

1180
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:23,630
He makes wars on what
he thinks he needs,

1181
01:14:23,664 --> 01:14:25,998
but actually, it's
what he wants.

1182
01:14:26,033 --> 01:14:30,070
And if he wants them, then
he manufactures the need.

1183
01:14:30,103 --> 01:14:32,573
It's stupid. It's selfish.

1184
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:33,640
It's wrong.

1185
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:36,076
And no matter what kind

1186
01:14:36,109 --> 01:14:40,581
of flowery justification
they may give it,

1187
01:14:41,715 --> 01:14:46,253
it's evil, wars,
holocausts, you name it.

1188
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:49,590
Not like the animals.

1189
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:50,757
Now the elephant,

1190
01:14:52,693 --> 01:14:55,729
he sees a banana grove he
wants, okay, he takes it.

1191
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,565
Yeah, but he doesn't
know anything

1192
01:14:58,599 --> 01:15:03,070
about lines of mark
or demarcation,
ownership, property.

1193
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:08,141
And if I was
creating a new world,

1194
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:11,111
I would say to
hell with this one,

1195
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:13,046
except for the fact that,

1196
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,583
if there's a new world out
there beyond the stars,

1197
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:19,686
what if there's no elephants?

1198
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,522
That would be tragic.

1199
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:46,513
- Wait.

1200
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:48,582
Hey, did I embarrass you?

1201
01:15:54,254 --> 01:15:55,689
I'm a jerk.

1202
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:57,190
- No, you're not.

1203
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:13,206
- I wish
I understood you.

1204
01:17:07,728 --> 01:17:09,329
- So you've never
been to the beach?

1205
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:10,263
- Never.

1206
01:17:11,231 --> 01:17:12,299
- No beach?

1207
01:17:12,332 --> 01:17:13,233
- No.

1208
01:17:15,202 --> 01:17:16,737
- Not even a little bit?

1209
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,672
- They don't have
beaches in Ohio.

1210
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,341
- What do they have?

1211
01:17:22,376 --> 01:17:24,177
- Nothing, really,

1212
01:17:24,211 --> 01:17:25,912
I mean, nothing for me, anyway.

1213
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:33,353
If you had to die, which
way would you choose?

1214
01:17:33,387 --> 01:17:36,657
Drop out of a plane,
drown in the ocean,

1215
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:37,691
or shot in the head?

1216
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:40,460
- Why are you so morbid?

1217
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:41,895
- Beats me.

1218
01:17:41,928 --> 01:17:43,697
So which way would
you rather die?

1219
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:47,801
- If I had to?
- Yup.

1220
01:17:48,769 --> 01:17:49,870
- None of those ways.

1221
01:17:49,903 --> 01:17:51,271
- Then how?

1222
01:17:52,906 --> 01:17:54,808
- By kissing you for so long

1223
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:57,711
that I run out of
breath, and I die.

1224
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:03,383
- I, I, I, I've never,
never been kissed before.

1225
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:05,352
- Can I kiss you
on the forehead?

1226
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,355
- Sure, yeah.

1227
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:13,794
- Ready?

1228
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:14,728
- Yeah.

1229
01:18:44,524 --> 01:18:45,425
- Why?

1230
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:47,928
No, don't, it's fine. It's fine.

1231
01:18:47,961 --> 01:18:48,929
- It's ugly.

1232
01:18:48,962 --> 01:18:51,331
- Well, maybe it was,
but it's not anymore.

1233
01:18:51,364 --> 01:18:52,733
- Okay, and why is that?

1234
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:53,734
- Because it's you.

1235
01:18:58,338 --> 01:18:59,239
Where'd you go?

1236
01:18:59,973 --> 01:19:01,274
- Thinking.

1237
01:19:01,308 --> 01:19:02,442
- Yeah, about what?

1238
01:19:02,476 --> 01:19:03,477
- How long you're
gonna like me for?

1239
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:05,812
- Well, who says I'm gonna stop?

1240
01:19:05,846 --> 01:19:07,314
- You will.

1241
01:19:07,347 --> 01:19:08,982
- Well, why is that?

1242
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:10,550
- Once you find out.

1243
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:11,952
- Find out what?

1244
01:19:11,985 --> 01:19:13,320
- Who I am?

1245
01:19:13,353 --> 01:19:14,454
- Casey, you think
you're the only one

1246
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:15,889
that has shit stuck inside?

1247
01:19:15,922 --> 01:19:17,024
- Maybe.

1248
01:19:17,058 --> 01:19:18,759
- Well, maybe
nothin', all right?

1249
01:19:18,792 --> 01:19:20,927
Most of the people I
know, they're all shit.

1250
01:19:21,928 --> 01:19:23,363
But if you're only half shit,

1251
01:19:23,396 --> 01:19:24,965
then you're doing
aces, in my book.

1252
01:19:24,998 --> 01:19:27,000
- You don't think
I'm mostly shit?

1253
01:19:27,968 --> 01:19:28,969
- On the shit scale,

1254
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:31,838
you're less than half.

1255
01:19:44,551 --> 01:19:45,452
- Hey!

1256
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:49,056
What are you doing down there?

1257
01:19:53,094 --> 01:19:54,895
Has security seen you?

1258
01:19:54,928 --> 01:19:57,031
Oh my God.

1259
01:19:57,064 --> 01:19:59,933
My God, how dare you!

1260
01:19:59,966 --> 01:20:01,802
- What's the matter, Jew?

1261
01:20:01,835 --> 01:20:02,869
You scared?

1262
01:20:04,105 --> 01:20:08,109
- No, no, I've seen your
kind all over the world.

1263
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:10,377
I'm, I'm not scared of you

1264
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:12,345
or you or you.

1265
01:20:12,379 --> 01:20:13,880
You're like children.

1266
01:20:13,914 --> 01:20:16,783
You're like mad,
little children.

1267
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:19,786
How dare you do
this to our school!

1268
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,122
How dare you!

1269
01:20:21,155 --> 01:20:22,789
I'm gonna report you,

1270
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:25,559
and I hope to hell they
throw your asses in jail.

1271
01:20:25,592 --> 01:20:26,827
- Aw!
- I'll see that you'll

1272
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:27,828
never do this again,

1273
01:20:27,861 --> 01:20:28,829
I'll tell you.
- That's right.

1274
01:20:28,862 --> 01:20:29,930
You walk away.
- You'll never do this again.

1275
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:31,098
- You have a great day.

1276
01:20:31,132 --> 01:20:32,066
Walk away, old man.
- Yeah, go to hell.

1277
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:32,966
Security!

1278
01:20:35,102 --> 01:20:35,969
Security!

1279
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:41,608
There are gorillas running
around loose in the streets.

1280
01:20:41,641 --> 01:20:45,046
America, where is your freedom?

1281
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,580
Where is your lack

1282
01:20:46,613 --> 01:20:49,583
of prejudice, intolerance?

1283
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:51,818
America, I'm speaking to you.

1284
01:20:51,852 --> 01:20:52,586
Security!

1285
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:07,868
- This is payback!

1286
01:21:07,901 --> 01:21:08,835
Fuck you!

1287
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:10,503
Get this, baby, get this!

1288
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:12,973
See, see how it goes,
you goddamned Jew

1289
01:21:13,007 --> 01:21:14,075
Fuck you!

1290
01:21:14,108 --> 01:21:14,975
That's right!

1291
01:21:15,009 --> 01:21:16,476
Fuck with us!

1292
01:21:16,509 --> 01:21:18,045
Piece of shit!

1293
01:21:47,174 --> 01:21:49,976
- Fuck you, whoever did this.

1294
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:51,444
Just fuck you!

1295
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:09,096
Go away!

1296
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:11,531
- Casey.

1297
01:22:11,564 --> 01:22:12,732
- Go away!

1298
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,435
- Casey, come on, it's me.

1299
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:17,104
- Go away, I said.

1300
01:22:17,138 --> 01:22:18,471
Just get the fuck away!

1301
01:22:18,505 --> 01:22:19,940
I don't want you here.

1302
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:21,741
- Please, don't shut me out.

1303
01:22:21,775 --> 01:22:23,543
- Get the fuck out! Just go!

1304
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:27,614
- Casey, I'm not your enemy.

1305
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,750
I'm on your side.

1306
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,720
- Get the fuck
out! Just go, okay?

1307
01:22:35,056 --> 01:22:37,091
- Look, Casey, you need me,

1308
01:22:38,992 --> 01:22:40,560
and I need you.

1309
01:22:40,593 --> 01:22:42,063
So just please open up.

1310
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:46,200
- Get the
fuck out! Just go!

1311
01:23:29,243 --> 01:23:30,444
- Well, he's regained
consciousness,

1312
01:23:30,478 --> 01:23:33,680
but with a ruptured spleen,
a fractured fourth vertebrae,

1313
01:23:33,713 --> 01:23:35,815
I don't really hold much hope.

1314
01:23:37,251 --> 01:23:38,585
- What's that mean?

1315
01:23:38,618 --> 01:23:40,021
- Sorry, are you a relative?

1316
01:23:41,022 --> 01:23:43,124
- He's my only family.

1317
01:23:43,157 --> 01:23:44,091
- Well, he comes in and out,

1318
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:45,692
but he can still hear you.

1319
01:24:01,075 --> 01:24:02,143
- I brought her flowers.

1320
01:24:03,777 --> 01:24:05,745
I figured she might know you
were sick and everything,

1321
01:24:05,779 --> 01:24:08,815
so I took the
flowers to her grave.

1322
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:11,651
That way, she'd
think it was you.

1323
01:24:14,288 --> 01:24:15,189
- Casey.

1324
01:24:16,323 --> 01:24:17,224
- Hi.

1325
01:24:18,758 --> 01:24:19,659
- Hi.

1326
01:24:20,627 --> 01:24:21,861
- You hungry?

1327
01:24:21,895 --> 01:24:23,863
I know the food here must suck.

1328
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:26,167
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1329
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,269
Yeah, the food does suck.

1330
01:24:34,175 --> 01:24:35,209
- Make any friends?

1331
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:39,779
- I, I, uh,

1332
01:24:39,813 --> 01:24:44,818
I met a couple of cute nurses.

1333
01:24:48,289 --> 01:24:49,656
- Should've been me.

1334
01:24:49,689 --> 01:24:51,292
- What?

1335
01:24:51,325 --> 01:24:52,859
- Those punks who banged you,

1336
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,329
it should've been me,
once doing the banging

1337
01:24:55,362 --> 01:24:57,697
for no fucking reason
other than to bang.

1338
01:24:58,731 --> 01:24:59,732
- Maybe, but not now.

1339
01:25:03,837 --> 01:25:05,738
- You're going to
die, aren't you?

1340
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:07,308
- With any luck, I do.

1341
01:25:08,842 --> 01:25:10,877
- But you can't,
okay? You can't.

1342
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:15,149
- Well, it's time already.

1343
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:17,851
I want to.

1344
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:20,854
- And what about me?

1345
01:25:20,887 --> 01:25:24,125
- You've been dead
too many years.

1346
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:26,293
Just start to live.

1347
01:25:26,327 --> 01:25:28,362
- I can't do it alone.

1348
01:25:28,395 --> 01:25:29,829
- You can.

1349
01:25:29,863 --> 01:25:31,232
- How?

1350
01:25:38,272 --> 01:25:40,307
- By embracing the tiger.

1351
01:28:17,964 --> 01:28:19,233
- All right, so, uh,

1352
01:28:19,266 --> 01:28:21,201
what are you guys planning
on doing after school?

1353
01:28:21,235 --> 01:28:22,236
- Probably...

1354
01:28:29,176 --> 01:28:30,144
- Can I, can I talk
to you guys later?

1355
01:28:30,177 --> 01:28:31,111
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you go ahead.

1356
01:28:31,145 --> 01:28:32,146
- All right.

1357
01:28:39,253 --> 01:28:40,953
Casey!

1358
01:28:40,987 --> 01:28:43,557
Casey, where the
fuck have you been?

1359
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:44,857
- Around.

1360
01:28:44,891 --> 01:28:46,560
- What kind of answer is that?

1361
01:28:46,593 --> 01:28:47,894
- Samuel's dead.

1362
01:28:49,063 --> 01:28:49,962
- I know.

1363
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:53,067
Okay, and I am so sorry.

1364
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,101
- Easy come, easy go, huh?

1365
01:28:55,902 --> 01:28:57,504
- Why don't you answer
your door when I come by,

1366
01:28:57,538 --> 01:28:58,472
or, or, or the phone?

1367
01:28:58,505 --> 01:28:59,640
- Why bother?

1368
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:02,276
- You know, Casey, Samuel
may be dead, but you're not.

1369
01:29:04,211 --> 01:29:05,112
- Yeah, see ya.

1370
01:29:07,014 --> 01:29:08,082
- You know, watch out
that the shit part

1371
01:29:08,115 --> 01:29:09,949
don't take you over.

1372
01:29:09,982 --> 01:29:11,318
It's got a habit of doing that.

1373
01:29:23,263 --> 01:29:27,067
- Look, if you
want to stay, pay the rent!

1374
01:29:44,318 --> 01:29:46,120
- He said, you know,
when he talked about,

1375
01:29:46,153 --> 01:29:48,055
but, you know, he didn't
talk about it all the time,

1376
01:29:48,088 --> 01:29:50,090
just here and there and stuff,

1377
01:29:50,124 --> 01:29:53,127
but you know what he
said that surprised me,

1378
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,661
really surprised me?

1379
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:56,929
He said that I wasn't
the only one getting hurt

1380
01:29:56,963 --> 01:29:58,198
by this stuff, you know?

1381
01:29:58,232 --> 01:29:59,266
It was also the guy that-

1382
01:30:00,334 --> 01:30:01,268
- Hey, watch it.

1383
01:30:01,301 --> 01:30:03,970
Don't get any oil on my shoes.

1384
01:30:04,003 --> 01:30:04,904
- Sorry.

1385
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:12,012
He would say that it was as
bad for me as it was for you,

1386
01:30:12,045 --> 01:30:14,014
and sometimes, even
worse than you.

1387
01:30:15,315 --> 01:30:16,983
- How 'bout a little
bit less with the mouth

1388
01:30:17,017 --> 01:30:18,285
and a little bit
more with the hand?

1389
01:30:18,318 --> 01:30:20,953
- And he said that
for you to cum,

1390
01:30:20,987 --> 01:30:23,990
you could get over me, but
I could just wash my hands,

1391
01:30:24,024 --> 01:30:25,058
and you would still be there.

1392
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:27,261
You would be full of shame.

1393
01:30:27,294 --> 01:30:29,430
Shame would be on
your mind forever.

1394
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:37,404
- Man!

1395
01:30:37,438 --> 01:30:38,605
- Samuel's watching.

1396
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:42,676
Samuel's watching me.
He's always watching.

1397
01:30:50,017 --> 01:30:51,318
- Oh man.

1398
01:32:50,837 --> 01:32:52,739
- Be brave.

1399
01:32:52,773 --> 01:32:54,408
Embracing the tiger.

1400
01:33:04,585 --> 01:33:09,289
- Through wars, through
famine, through holocaust even,

1401
01:33:09,323 --> 01:33:11,325
art continues, always.

1402
01:33:11,358 --> 01:33:13,160
Art will grow and
always continue.

1403
01:33:13,193 --> 01:33:14,328
Why is this?

1404
01:33:14,361 --> 01:33:15,862
Class?

1405
01:33:15,896 --> 01:33:17,230
Because as human beings,

1406
01:33:17,264 --> 01:33:19,266
we have a powerful
need, don't we?

1407
01:33:19,299 --> 01:33:23,503
A powerful need to create
what we feel, what we touch,

1408
01:33:23,537 --> 01:33:25,505
what we see, what
we hear, what we...

1409
01:33:26,873 --> 01:33:27,774
Casey!

1410
01:33:29,443 --> 01:33:30,877
Hey, won't you come join us?

1411
01:33:38,418 --> 01:33:40,187
- Roar!

1412
01:33:41,822 --> 01:33:43,123
Tiger for yes.
