Today we'll be discussing
how to handle a divorce.

00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:08,923
Yes, separations are very tough.

Difficult, but possible to do
while keeping your head high.

that men hate women
but cannot live without them.

It's possible

Does Broadmoor have facilities

1068
01:06:28,189 --> 01:06:29,959
that people of their age
require?

1069
01:06:30,061 --> 01:06:33,827
It is not,
not usual for persons so young

1070
01:06:33,929 --> 01:06:35,395
to come to Broadmoor.

1071
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:39,300
Uh, however, I think compared
to the remand centre,

1072
01:06:39,402 --> 01:06:42,638
Broadmoor offers a certain
freedom and also therapy.

1073
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,907
Uh, their treatment there

1074
01:06:44,009 --> 01:06:45,668
will consist of teaching them
to speak.

1075
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:47,872
And we maintain a sort
of village-like atmosphere

1076
01:06:47,974 --> 01:06:50,040
at the hospital.

1077
01:06:50,142 --> 01:06:51,373
There are gardens.

1078
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:54,212
Uh, we have, uh, hairdressers,

1079
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:56,152
uh, beautiful bathrooms,

1311

You're the strong one.

Mm-hmm.

1325

They are sensitive girls.

1355
01:29:18,392 --> 01:29:19,721
They are writers. You know that.

1356
01:29:19,957 --> 01:29:22,426
Marjorie, they just can't
help themselves.

1357
01:29:22,528 --> 01:29:24,830
They don't even seem to want to.

1358
01:29:24,932 --> 01:29:27,995
When they can show that they do,
I will happily hand them over.

1359
01:29:28,098 --> 01:29:30,932
