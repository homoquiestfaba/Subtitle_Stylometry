00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,092
Sean:<i> There's a magic that</i>
<i>happens when you dance.</i>

2
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,329
<i>Everything lines up.
The world is in sync.</i>

3
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,197
<i>And for one perfect moment,</i>

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,067
<i>you feel totally alive.</i>

5
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,537
<i>But to make
a living as a dancer</i>

6
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,240
<i>you go through stuff that
doesn't feel so magical.</i>

7
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,208
<i>The rejection.</i>

8
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,476
<i>Crappy pay.</i>

9
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,678
<i>Endless auditions.</i>

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,180
<i>That's when it feels
like your world</i>

11
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,582
<i>shrinks down to
the same cold room.</i>

12
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:54,253
<i>The same fluorescent</i>
<i>lights and the same</i>
<i>indifferent people</i>

13
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,055
<i>day after day.</i>

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,591
<i>That's where my
Hollywood story begins.</i>

15
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,327
All right, thanks
for coming in today.

16
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,595
Uh, you guys know
everybody here.

17
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,264
Woman: Can you
take off, um...

18
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,799
Man: Take your shirts off.

19
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,300
Yeah, just take
your shirts off.

20
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,435
Oh, yeah, no shirts.

21
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:11,703
(Sighing)

22
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,508
Good. That's good.

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,576
That's good.

24
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,180
(Music playing)

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,388
That's great.
Can you come forward?

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,790
Man: And go backwards.

27
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,692
Can you just step
to your left, please?

28
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,393
Just find the light
to your left.

29
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,235
But as you're going left,
you need to go right?

30
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,535
(Grunting)

31
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,442
I want you
to feel the feeling
of feeling the product.

32
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,312
Good. And use the product.

33
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,448
(Grunting)

34
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:37,689
I just want the feeling
that your hose
is your family.

35
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,893
And I want you to, um,
make love to it.

36
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,461
Oh.
But not in a weird way.

37
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,499
That's good.
Oh, yeah. Okay.

38
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,415
Good. More, more!

39
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,718
Less, less!

40
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,857
Yeah, I wasn't
expecting a beard.

41
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,425
I like the beard.

42
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,394
No, we need the beard to go.
Beard's gotta go.

43
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,929
Woman: Beard's not going.
Man: The beard should go now.

44
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,363
Are you willing to
shave your beard?

45
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,765
Yeah, I'll shave it off.
Absolutely.

46
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,600
You'll shave? He'll shave.
Yeah.

47
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,634
Yeah.
Come on, please?

48
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,311
All: Thank you.

49
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,281
(Exhaling)

50
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,384
This is not working.

51
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,889
(Indistinct conversations)

52
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,730
What are you doin'?
What's wrong with you?
Oh.

53
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,734
Mmm.
Oh. That's nice.

54
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,970
Woman: Hey!

55
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,872
You gonna let her
walk past you like that?

56
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,841
Yeah, exactly
what was that?

57
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,344
Dawg, you gotta move on.

58
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,546
Huh?

59
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:11,350
Emily's on tour.
All right? It's over.

60
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:14,786
Hot girl looks at
you like that, man,
you gotta handle it.

61
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,355
Mmm-hmm.
You know better than that.

62
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,323
I know how I'd handle it.

63
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,426
Sorry, everyone,
looks like we found
what we're looking for

64
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,795
and we're out of
time for today,
so thanks again.

65
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:27,266
Are you serious? Come on.
We've been out
here for three hours.

66
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,800
That's how it goes.

67
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,302
Thank you so much, Elizabeth.
Appreciate it.

68
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:31,403
Always a pleasure, Jasper.

69
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,405
Yes, it is.

70
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,773
(Chuckling) Nice hats.

71
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,043
<i>Ole.</i>

72
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,846
<i>Ole?</i>

73
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,882
Eddy: Shit.

74
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,751
Jason: Bad. That was bad.

75
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,519
Sean: I don't get it.

76
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,554
I actually had a good
feeling about this one.

77
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,657
Yeah. That one,
and the one before,

78
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,293
and all the other
ones that we didn't get.

79
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,328
Yeah, I thought LA
was supposed to be

80
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,563
the place where
dreams actually happen.

81
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,532
No, what actually
happens is that

82
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,302
we keep putting on this
stupid shit for nothing.

83
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,804
Where did you find
these anyway?
Actually, I don't wanna know.

84
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,306
In the dumpster
behind El compadre.

85
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,473
(All groaning)

86
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,609
It's called vintage, boo.

87
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,010
Y'all act like we
can afford new ones.

88
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,612
Jason: No, that's
called nasty.

89
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,513
That's gross.
Honestly, I can't
take this anymore.

90
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,548
I really can't. You know?

91
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,751
All right.
Let's just chalk this up
as another crappy audition.

92
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,421
Every audition is
a crappy audition.

93
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,323
I thought we were
on our way.

94
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,825
We move out here.
We do the big nike ad.
Everything's looking good.

95
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,960
And then nothing.

96
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,563
I hate to say it,
but what are we
still doing here?

97
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,565
Jason: I feel you, bro.

98
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,834
Okay, it's been rough.

99
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,956
We gotta blow
off some steam.

100
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,505
I know what we need.

101
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,940
(Indistinct conversations)

102
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,375
(Music playing in club)

103
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,614
Yo, the mob is in the house,
y'all!

104
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,682
What's up, Sean?

105
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,551
Brother, how you
doin', man?

106
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,486
Oh, my man!

107
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,589
That's my man.
How you feelin', man?
All right?

108
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,557
How many of y'all tonight?

109
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,891
The whole mob.

110
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,927
Y'all always roam
in packs, though.

111
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,528
I don't know
why you gotta do
that to a brother.

112
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,397
Told you,
this is what we needed.

113
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,401
Jason: Let's have
a good night, y'all.

114
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,803
Oh. What the...

115
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,906
Hey! It's the mariachi
band from earlier.

116
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,008
You ladies play
us something saucy?

117
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,879
That's cute.
That necklace is cute, too.
You get that at Claire's?

118
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,048
Man, you spend all
day comin' up with that?

119
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,784
You musta had a lotta
free time after
not getting that gig.

120
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,052
Whatever,
man, just get outta here.

121
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,387
We're just tryin'
to have a good time.

122
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,654
Man, we ain't goin' nowhere.

123
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,756
We came here to do
a little dancin'.

124
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:31,990
Unless that's
a problem for you.

125
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,992
It is. So go.

126
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,595
Maybe we should settle it.

127
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,764
(Chuckling) You wanna
battle on the floor?

128
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,966
Please, let's not do
it, all right? Are we
really doing this?

129
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,968
Jason: Right.
Listen, please.

130
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,703
This guy's a douche, man.
And I'm not tryin' to
get all sweaty in this.

131
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:45,904
Battling him is not the move.

132
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,539
Look, what's the problem?

133
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,841
Did the three amigos
forget their sombreros?

134
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,543
Mexican reference?
Good job, man.

135
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,844
This guy's a dick.
Come on. Let's just go.

136
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,980
No, no.

137
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,616
You picked the wrong
night to get in
my face, little man.

138
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,117
Are you having
a tough day?

139
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,119
It must suck to be
hot for five minutes,

140
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,156
then realize that your
flash mob ain't nothin'
but a joke.

141
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,891
Man: Whatever, man,
you're a joke!

142
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,126
Okay, yeah, we got that.
That's awesome.
Thank you, man.

143
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,528
Look, we've been
there and done that.

144
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,663
Let this go. Let's just go.

145
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,633
No, we came here
to dance, right?

146
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,502
Why don't we line it
up for these clowns.
Come on, let's go.

147
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,905
Come on.

148
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,139
(Indistinct shouting)

149
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,513
(Music playing)

150
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,797
(All shouting)

151
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,656
(Crowd cheering)

152
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,036
Whoo!

153
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,802
Oh!

154
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,686
(Music changing)

155
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,011
(Crowd cheering)

156
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,619
(Indistinct shouting)

157
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,101
Yo!

158
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,038
Aah!

159
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,353
(All cheering)

160
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,094
All: (Chanting) Grim knights!
Grim knights! Grim knights!

161
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,400
That's the last time
I make a fool out of
myself for you. That's it.

162
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,482
Jason: Way to look
out for the crew, bro.
Thanks, man.

163
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,204
I'm outta here.

164
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,012
Hey, man, easy come,
easy go, bro.

165
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,781
If everybody could make it,
it wouldn't be Hollywood.

166
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,286
(Cheering continuing)

167
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,099
(Indistinct chatter)

168
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:53,972
What time was lunch?
Like 2:30.

169
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,206
There you are, man.

170
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,841
What is this?

171
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,777
Look, we been
talkin' about it, man,

172
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,880
and it's time
to go home, Sean.

173
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,849
I mean, we've gone hard.
And it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

174
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,153
Then what?
You're just gonna bail?

175
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,855
All of you?

176
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,024
Yo, man, wake up, man!

177
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,493
When are you gonna
stop acting like
everything is just okay?

178
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,929
This crew's not
ready for LA, man.

179
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,864
I don't know how
you don't see that.

180
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,500
Because we made 50
grand off the nike spot.

181
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,235
Yeah. Six months ago.

182
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,204
And split 12 ways.

183
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,373
Dawg, I spend more
money on gas going
to auditions

184
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,841
than most people
do on rent.

185
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,477
I'm over it.
I'm done, man.

186
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,513
So what are you gonna do?

187
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,581
Hmm?

188
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,185
You gonna go back to Miami?

189
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,821
We're just all
tapped out, man.

190
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,856
Dude, we're 40 days
late on our rent.

191
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,858
43.

192
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,141
I've run out of stuff
to sell on ebay, man.
I have nothing.

193
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,098
Man, let's just call it
what it is, all right?
We're ready to go back.

194
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,501
So quit then.
Go crawling back
to Miami. Go ahead.

195
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,102
Eddy: Ain't gotta
be like this.
Yeah, it does.

196
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,871
Sorry, I'm not leavin'.

197
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,307
Really?

198
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,508
Yeah. I'm stayin' here.

199
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,180
All right, peace, man.

200
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,584
Eddy: Hold up.

201
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,207
(People cheering on laptop)

202
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,975

217

(Music playing)

218
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,051
You still got it.

219
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,252
Lookin' good.

220
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,057
Yo, man, you shoulda
called me sooner.

221
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,059
I had no idea
you needed a job.

222
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,228
Yeah. Thank you.
Things have been
a little rough.

223
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,197
Well, this is perfect!

224
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,333
Come on, I'll introduce you.
Glad you came.

225
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,036
How's Camille?
You guys likin' LA?

226
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:48,306
Yeah, she's great. LA's fun.
What's not to like about LA?

227
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,348
Rumba's the dance of love,
miss Nakamura.

228
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,649
It's a courtship ritual.

229
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,184
That's Chad.

230
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,487
Chad: Copy me.
Quick, slow, quick, slow.

231
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,688
<i>Baba!</i>

232
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,625
You must be Sean.

233
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:12,497
Mooski, you didn't tell me
your friend was so cute.

234
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,431
Thanks for letting
me stay here.

235
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,066
You're welcome.

236
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,634
Oh. Finally, you are here.

237
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,370
The women's toilet
is leaking like
a broken faucet.

238
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,639
And faucet is broken, too.
Please fix.

239
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,709
Here. You are sleeping here
in the closets of storage.

240
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,145
Please, drop bag
and get to work.

241
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,947
<i>Opa,</i> he just got in.
Let him settle in first.

242
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,816
Come on, I'll buy
you a smoothie

243
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,084
before you get
your hands dirty.

244
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,186
Go! Have smoothie.
This can wait.

245
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,622
Okay.

246
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,293
Have you heard
of<i> the vortex?</i>

247
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,331
Uh. That's something
on vh1, right?

248
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,302
What? Camille loves vh1.

249
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,504
Hey, nothin'.

250
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,640
No, but you should
totally enter that.
Call the mob.

251
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,711
No, come on, man.
The mob is like
the king of the streets.

252
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,814
I mean, sure,
you and eddy had a little
fallout or whatever.

253
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,483
But you can't enter alone.

254
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,685
I mean, don't get me wrong.

255
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,788
Back in the day,
I woulda tore that thing up.
Y'know what I'm sayin'?

256
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,559
I mean, that's not
a bad idea. You and I
on a crew together.

257
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,527
Come on.

258
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,530
I would love to,
but I have a job now, man.
I'm an engineer.

259
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,767
Come on, man.
You're the moose.
There's only one moose.

260
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,235
My life's totally
different now.

261
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,270
I've got a lot
of responsibility.

262
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,839
Dance competitions
are fun and all,

263
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,307
but they're not really
gonna pay the bills.

264
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,309
No, but that's
the beauty of it, man.

265
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,811
This competition
does pay the bills.
For a while, too.

266
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,413
I get it, man. I just...

267
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,652
I can't, man, I'm sorry.

268
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,489
But you should do it.

269
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,824
Yeah.

270
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,259
All right? See you around.

271
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,261
Later, man.

272
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,311
Hello!
Camille: Hi!

273
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,647
Welcome back.

274
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,485
Good day?
Yeah.

275
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,555
So how's Sean doing?

276
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,391
He's okay.

277
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,494
He's got this
really crazy idea.

278
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,862
What?

279
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,597
It's honestly really crazy.

280
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,702
Remember that ad you saw
about<i> the vortex</i> on vh1?

281
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,604
Yeah. What about it?

282
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,439
Yeah, well, he's
thinking about entering it.

283
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,242
And he can kinda
pull it off.

284
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,478
But the only thing is
he doesn't have
anyone to do it with.

285
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,247
And, so, well...

286
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,216
He kinda asked me to do it.

287
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,384
He asked you?

288
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,718
I know. Crazy, right?

289
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,559
And?
No, no, no, I can't.

290
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,627
It's completely impractical.

291
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,932
So you have no interest
in dancing at all?

292
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:04,635
Nope. Pretty sure that
part of my life is over.

293
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:08,539
Yup. I don't really
even think about it
anymore, really.

294
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,775
Yeah. It was
the right call.

295
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,577
What would you
tell Mr. mcgowan?

296
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,245
And how would you pull
a crew together that fast?

297
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,480
Exactly.

298
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,615
It's not like you've
been keeping up with
training or anything.

299
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,283
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm in shape.

300
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,285
But at that level?

301
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,688
I doubt you'd be able
to pick up where you
left off.

302
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,224
Oh, come on!
The moose does not
lose these skills.

303
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,692
Shout it! (Laughing)

304
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,697
Wait a second.
You just set me up.

305
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:33,864
Maybe.

306
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,705
So you really
want me to do this?

307
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,574
You wanna do this.

308
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,545
And if you want something,
I want it for you.

309
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,414
Really? 'Cause I
thought you would've
thought it was crazy.

310
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,318
Please! Since when
did I become that girl?

311
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,555
So you think I
could swing it?
With my job and everything?

312
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,690
You're the dancing moose.

313
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,326
The dancing moose
figures it out.

314
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,699
(Music playing)

315
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,349
Mr. Alexander.

316
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,417
Mr. mcgowan.

317
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,785
What are you doing?

318
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,987
Um...

319
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:34,325
Oh. It's actually
a focusing exercise, sir.

320
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,460
It gets the blood
flowing faster to
your brain,

321
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:41,565
thus causing an increase
in productivity, sir.

322
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,636
Um. You should
try it sometime.
It's good for your health.

323
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,510
Actually, I was hoping
that we could talk, sir.

324
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,912
Look, my grandma's not
really doing too well,

325
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:58,749
and I'm (Sighing) The only
grandson that she kinda
has out here,

326
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:02,320
and I promised my family
that I'd take care of her.

327
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,790
You have a grandma that
used to bake you cookies

328
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,658
and knit you sweaters.

329
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,061
My grandmother
was a prison warden.

330
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:11,429
Oh, wow.

331
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,730
I didn't know that.

332
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:17,335
She must have been
a very strong, tough woman

333
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,070
who probably did
have a soft side, too.

334
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:21,672
She was a prison warden.

335
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,708
I got that.

336
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,377
So you do understand
that from time to time,

337
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:31,082
if I need to leave
work to, you know,
take her to the doctor.

338
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:33,351
I can admire a man who
puts his family first.

339
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:36,654
As long as he gets
here two hours
early every morning

340
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:38,689
to cover the time
he's missing.

341
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,757
Two hours?

342
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,825
Two hours.

343
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,137
Yes! Work those hips,
miss turnbuckle,
work those hips.

344
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,507
Twerk it, miss turnbuckle.

345
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:59,043
Vegas, baby, Vegas.
We got three weeks to
get ready for Vegas.

346
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,878
You comin' down
from there, or what?

347
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,547
What? Oh, hell, yeah!
You better not be
playin' me, man.

348
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,850
What about your job?

349
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:06,917
Figured it out.

350
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,686
Come on.

351
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,688
What about my job?
Your grandparents?

352
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,822
Oh, they'll be all right.
Chad knows how

353
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,090
to change a light bulb.
Right, Chad?

354
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,659
Yeah.
Moose: I know just
the place to start.

355
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,862
Figure eights.
Work those figure eights.

356
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,430
(Indistinct conversation)

357
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,767
(Bell ringing)

358
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,773
And we're at
a fashion shoot?

359
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,941
Okay.

360
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:38,015
Oh, I get it.
Costumes. Good thinkin'.

361
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,119
Oh, my God,
that looks terrible!

362
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,088
I told you she
would screw this up.

363
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,025
I'm not finished yet.
I just need some more pins.

364
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,760
Pins won't work!
What is wrong with you?

365
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,495
You are making
her look fat.

366
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,563
What did I tell you?

367
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:53,531
You're making me look fat?

368
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,099
You don't look fat.

369
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,101
You need to solve
this right now.
She looks like a whale.

370
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,570
Okay, I am gonna
get some more pins.

371
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,972
I'm calling the designer.

372
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,575
Oh, my God, is this
making me look fat?
(Scoffs)

373
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,677
Moose! (Laughing)
What are you doing here?

374
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,147
We're gonna dance on
live television in Vegas...
Blah blah blah!

375
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,483
Come on, we'll fill
you in in the car.

376
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,652
No. Are you talking
about that<i> vortex</i> thing?
I have work. Can't.

377
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,454
Yo! Think this is
a good look for the crew.

378
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,522
(Laughing)

379
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,859
Who's the pretty boy?

380
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:24,528
This is Sean.
He's an amazing
choreographer.

381
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,564
You've never
heard of the mob?

382
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,932
No.

383
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,533
How have you not
heard of the mob?

384
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:30,835
I don't get out much.

385
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,204
And, ah, who are you?

386
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,173
Hey, guys, relax, okay?

387
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:39,844
Andie, this is Sean.
The mob is totally legit.

388
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,913
And, Sean, Andie
knows what she's doing.
All right?

389
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:46,050
Cool. So she will help
with the costumes then,
right?

390
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:49,053
(Chuckling) This costume
girl could dance
circles around your ass.

391
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,121
(Laughing) Okay, good to know.

392
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,823
Anytime, anyplace.

393
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,695
Okay, guys,
let's just chill,
all right?

394
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,066
Come on.
Can we talk about this?

395
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:12,109
Does it always have to end up
in a big, giant dance battle?

396
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,111
(Music playing)

397
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,009
(Laughing)

398
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,144
What is going on here?

399
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,979
Get me off this thing!

400
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,815
All right, hang on, hang on.
Somebody get her a ladder.

401
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,651
Hang on.
We'll get you down.

402
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,252
Oh, my God, the couture!

403
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,787
What is this?

404
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,257
Clean up this
mess or you're fired.

405
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,294
Fired!

406
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,063
Eh.

407
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,036
Sean:<i> Turns out,</i>
<i>moose was well-connected.</i>

408
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,706
<i>First we found vladd,
the human robot.</i>

409
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,709
<i>And we all know he
can do some crazy stuff.</i>

410
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,744
<i>Speaking of crazy,</i>

411
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,681
<i>we hunted down these two
busted-up sign spinners</i>

412
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,316
<i>who turned out to be...</i>

413
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:26,650
Moose!

414
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:27,718
What are you doing here?

415
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,753
Sean:<i> The Santiago twins.</i>

416
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,889
<i>Two of the most</i>
<i>amazing dancers</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

417
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,361
<i>Next, Andie took
us to meet Violet.</i>

418
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:40,998
This is Violet.
Trust me, we need her.

419
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,667
Sean:<i> She makes a mean</i>
<i>banana split, but, hey...</i>

420
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:47,304
Sean:<i> That's just her day job.</i>
<i>This girl can move.</i>

421
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,741
<i>Then calls went out
to the east coast.</i>

422
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:51,809
(Cellphone ringing)

423
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,345
Hello?

424
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:55,846
Sean:<i> Jenny kido.</i>

425
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:57,681
Does your aunt
still have that van?

426
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,123
Sean:<i> Ditched her</i>
<i>telemarketing job,</i>

427
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,151
<i>grabbed her aunt's van,</i>

428
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,253
(speaking Japanese)

429
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,955
<i>And hit the road.</i>

430
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,162
(Cellphone ringing)

431
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,198
<i>Before heading west,
she picked up monster.</i>

432
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,167
Monster!
Kido!

433
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,003
Road trip! Are you in?

434
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,272
Sean:<i> A sick b-boy</i>
<i>from the Bronx.</i>

435
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:25,909
<i>They swung through Baltimore
and grabbed our buddy, hair,</i>

436
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,912
<i>who refused to come
without his barber.</i>

437
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:32,116
<i>But, that guy could
dance his ass off.</i>

438
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,321
How are you?

439
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:41,025
Sean:<i> Three days later,</i>
<i>we all showed up</i>
<i>at the cha cha palace.</i>

440
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,726
Mr. moose!

441
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,928
Santiagos! Twin killers.

442
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,930
Hey!

443
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,298
Hi, vladd.

444
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,901
Hi! How are you?

445
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,671
Sean:<i> Our crew</i>
<i>was finally complete.</i>

446
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:54,838
Hi!

447
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,407
Sean:<i> Or so we thought.</i>

448
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:57,975
Let's call it a day,
miss vanderblast.

449
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,443
You go take a load
off those bunions.

450
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,912
Thank you.

451
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:05,082
That's Chad, everybody.
He teaches here.

452
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,458
What's up, what's up?

453
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,428
Smooth.
Are we still sayin' that?

454
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,697
Yo. So we're gonna
be training here.

455
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,699
Ana and Boris already
gave us the "all clear."

456
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,261
We'll try and stay
outta your way. Cool?

457
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,304
Cool.

458
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,239
Cool.

459
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:32,810
Okay, junior cotillion.
Today, foxtrot promenade.

460
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,847
Five minutes and
we get started.

461
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,415
All right, all right.

462
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,184
Thank you all for coming out.

463
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,419
Yeah. Everybody
knows why they're here.

464
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,788
This isn't just another
dance competition.

465
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,758
We win this thing and
we get our own show.

466
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,927
For three years.
(All cheering)

467
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:54,198
That means
quitting our day jobs
and dancing full-time.

468
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,101
The first round
of<i> the vortex</i> is
a video submission.

469
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,369
That's right. We got
some really cool ideas.

470
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,272
I work at a lab.
And my boss is at a
conference next week

471
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,476
and if we work fast,
we can shoot our video
there while he's gone.

472
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:07,344
Only the best of
the best get in.

473
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,947
So we need to
give them a show.

474
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,850
So let's get to
work and put our heads
in the same place. Yeah?

475
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:14,218
All right, let's do it.

476
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,919
Yeah, if we rehearse
every single day,

477
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,888
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

478
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,890
No, it wouldn't be.

479
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,493
But we need to think
and breathe as a unit.

480
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:25,295
Thinkin' and breathin'?
No, we need to dance.
We're gonna dance.

481
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:28,265
Well, obviously,
we're gonna dance,
'cause that's why we're here.

482
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,868
So just to be clear,

483
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,870
if we're gonna be a crew,

484
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,238
who's gonna be in charge?

485
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,472
I am.
I am.

486
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,212
What? I'm not doin' that.

487
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,180
What? Go over there!

488
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,281
Where?

489
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,785
(Giggling)

490
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:48,952
Yeah, come on, we're doin' it.

491
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,188
Chad: Okay, cotillion,
ignore those guys.

492
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,224
Eyes right here.
Keep your eyes
on the Chad.

493
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:57,227
Come on.
Everybody up. Let's go.

494
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,862
Okay, take your partners.

495
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,064
Just follow what
I'm doin'. Go.

496
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,270
(Violet laughing)

497
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,941
Violet: So cool.

498
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,144
Guys! Seriously?

499
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,245
(Grunting)

500
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,814
Okay, let's move on.

501
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,184
Hit this hard. Come back.

502
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,418
There you go.

503
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,486
(Clearing throat)

504
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,160
I wanna be in your crew.

505
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,930
(Scoffs)
Dude, no offense, man,

506
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,231
but the cha-cha-cha
doesn't really

507
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,933
mesh with what
we're doin' here.

508
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:38,569
Yeah. So I cha-cha
with cougars?

509
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:41,171
Pays the bills.
Chicks dig it.

510
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:45,142
But I have been known
to get pretty crunk.

511
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:47,511
This competition's gonna
be hard enough as it is.

512
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,247
We don't need any
help from Rico suave
over here.

513
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:53,550
Ooh. Ouch.
Rico suave, huh?

514
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,226
You don't think
I got it, do ya?

515
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,023
Do you wanna
see what I got?

516
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,193
Nope. No, I don't wanna
see what you've got.

517
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,228
Hit the music.

518
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,562
(Music playing)

519
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,331
Watch.

520
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,398
(Laughing)

521
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,548
(All cheering)

522
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,158
Marcos: That was great!

523
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,060
Bravo!

524
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,161
I can't believe it.

525
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,363
Whatever.

526
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,232
(Laughing)

527
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,300
Martin: Fancy pants.

528
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,502
(Music playing)

529
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:46,570
(All cheering)

530
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,263
(Grunting)

531
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,331
(Snoring)

532
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,442
Mooski, take
another meatball.

533
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,411
You need to be strong
tomorrow for your video.

534
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:05,082
I also made veggie loaf
in case anyone wants some.

535
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,483
(Dismissively)
Vegan, vaygan...

536
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,218
Vegan,<i> baba,</i> vegan.

537
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,154
Foo to your vegan!

538
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,024
You need meat. Not grass.
Good for the blood.

539
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,359
Look at how she
eats her balls.

540
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,493
You like the balls?

541
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,395
Yes, thank you.
They're great.

542
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:21,999
I give you recipe.
You make for him.
See how many he eats?

543
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,101
No, they're actually good.

544
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,423
Texture's a little
different than regular
meatballs, though.

545
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,240
Kinda chewier.

546
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,476
That means he
was a tough goat.

547
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,149
Goat?

548
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,517
Goat. You know.
(Imitates goat bleating)

549
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,419
Moose: Yeah, goat balls.

550
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,541
Yeah, they're a total
delicacy back
in the old country.

551
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,657
Mmm.

552
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:50,761
And once again, veggie loaf?
Anyone?

553
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,197
I like the meat.

554
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,106
Are you sure you're
okay with the dishes?

555
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,307
Yeah, we got this.

556
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,742
Yeah, go.
We're almost done.

557
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,145
And next time,
I'm cooking dinner.

558
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:10,514
I do not hate
that idea at all.
(Camille laughing)

559
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:11,515
Camille: Okay. Sounds good.

560
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,350
Bye.
<i>Adios, muchachos.</i>

561
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:16,653
Bye!

562
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:20,157
Those goat balls?
Oh, my God, you shoulda seen
the look on your face.

563
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,758
Hey. I took it like a man.

564
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
(Laughing) Like a man.
Right.

565
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:27,164
I didn't know if you
were gonna cry or puke.

566
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,299
You don't seem
like the crying type.

567
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,567
So I seem like
the puking type?

568
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,768
Well...

569
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,440
God, have you always been
such a perfectionist?

570
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:37,641
I'm not a perfectionist.

571
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,709
(Laughing)

572
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,414
Must have driven
your ex nuts, huh?

573
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,318
She was a dancer,
too, right?

574
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,720
I'm sorry. Moose told me.
I didn't know if it
was a secret or anything.

575
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,856
No, it's not.

576
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,157
It was a while ago.

577
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,693
She was in my crew and...

578
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,663
She left.

579
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,701
I know all about that.
(Laughing)

580
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:08,405
Can be really hard.
Dancing together.
Being together.

581
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,241
Gets intense.

582
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,745
Yeah.

583
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,415
(Ana laughing)

584
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:21,785
(Whispering)
Look, look, look.
Come here.

585
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,298
(Laughing)

586
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,467
It's amazing how long
they've been together.

587
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,438
They still dance.

588
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,150
Sean: Wow. Moose, this
is perfect for the video.

589
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,112
Moose: Wait till you see
what I rigged up in here.

590
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,457
Dude, this place is crazy.
I can't believe you work here.

591
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:03,393
How long till
your boss gets back
from his conference?

592
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,429
Precisely four
hours and nine minutes

593
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:09,266
as long as he doesn't
travel faster than 67
Miles per hour.

594
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,436
Sean: But we gotta
work fast. Ready?

595
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,804
Who's on music? Let's roll.

596
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,208
Hmm.

597
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,992
(Electricity crackling)

598
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:09,994
(Both screaming)

599
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,263
(Laughing)

600
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:52,869
(Grunting)

601
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,499
(All cheering)

602
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,704
Yo. It's so sick!

603
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,008
Sean: All right,
it's official.
We're lmntrix.

604
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,876
All: Lmntrix.

605
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:14,084
All (Chanting)
Lmntrix! Lmntrix! Lmntrix!

606
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:15,086
(All cheering)

607
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,124
Still nothin'
from<i> the vortex?</i>

608
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,396
Nope. Two weeks
and not a thing.

609
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,499
Dude, our video
was great.

610
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,402
I don't get it.

611
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:33,737
(Sighing)

612
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,506
Yeah. I thought
we killed it.

613
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:42,379
I wish things
would just work out
just for once.

614
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,813
How'd your
grandparents do it?

615
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,583
Must have been
easier back in the day.

616
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,086
Was it easier back then?

617
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,821
I had to shovel...
(Speaking other language)

618
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,525
Sheep poop.

619
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:58,428
Yeah. That's how I
paid for our shoes
so we could dance.

620
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,497
Sounds terrible.

621
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,532
Are you kidding?
It was greatest
time of my life.

622
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,868
We dance all night
and forget about everything.

623
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,671
Oh, yeah. The light in
the bathroom, it needs fix.

624
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,573
And one more thing...

625
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,142
Ana!
Ana: What?

626
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:13,543
Where is the package?
The lemon tricks.

627
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:14,811
Ana: The what?

628
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:15,979
Boris: The lemon
tricks thing.

629
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,814
Ana: Oh.

630
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:18,848
Here.

631
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,690
It's from<i> the vortex.</i>

632
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,533
Alexxa:<i> Welcome, team lmntrix.</i>
<i>Your journey to</i>
<i>the vortex begins now.</i>

633
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,002
Vegas, baby!

634
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,437
Oh, yeah!

635
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,440
Vegas!

636
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:44,507
(All cheering)

637
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,096
Sean: Caesars!
You guys, it's caesars!

638
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,232
Stop, stop, stop!

639
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,837
Welcome to Caesars Palace.
You guys here for<i> the vortex?</i>

640
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,573
All right, step right
this way to meet alexxa.

641
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,543
So, Jasper, how did you feel
when you found out that

642
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:55,979
the grim knights
will be competing here?

643
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,114
At Caesars Palace?

644
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,717
Oh, my God. So, so blessed.

645
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,652
When you grow
up like I did,

646
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:05,121
life puts a cage
around your heart.

647
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:08,124
All you hear is the can'ts,
the shouldn'ts, the don'ts.

648
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:11,528
Being in this magical
place and having this
beautiful opportunity?

649
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,664
To me, that is the dream.

650
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:15,765
Women: Aw.

651
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,267
Believe, yo.

652
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:19,068
She's so beautiful.

653
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,303
Yo.

654
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:21,871
That is so inspiring.

655
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,740
Thank you very much.

656
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:24,941
We got it. Cut.

657
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:27,110
Hey. Wait, wait, wait.
Can we do it again?

658
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,145
I want us to do
something with a little
bit more passion.

659
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,981
Maybe talk about how
I was bullied as a kid.
Powder!

660
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,316
Man: Lmntrix? All right,
you'll do. Get up here.

661
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:35,018
So cute! Come here, guys.

662
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,753
Go, go, go!

663
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,059
Oh, hey.

664
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,129
It's the lab rats! Yeah!

665
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,197
I see you got
yourself a new crew.

666
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,766
Y'all come to see
some real dancin'?

667
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,335
Man, let's get outta here.

668
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:53,636
Ooh.

669
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,772
So it begins.

670
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:59,142
The drama!
The passion!<i> The vortex.</i>

671
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,579
How intimidating is it

672
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:06,215
to be going up against
all these tough crews?

673
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,984
No, we're excited.

674
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:11,054
We're a new crew.
But don't let that fool you.
We're ready.

675
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:13,056
We been training
really hard to get here.

676
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:16,159
Now I hear the grim knights
are the crew to beat.

677
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:17,594
(Clicking tongue)

678
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,195
How do you feel about that?

679
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,031
It's news to me.

680
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:23,866
We literally
just arrived, so...

681
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,639
Okay. Thank you, guys.

682
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:31,608
Wait a minute, please!

683
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,977
It is going to be fierce.

684
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:36,779
I'm alexxa brava,
and I am signing off.

685
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:37,947
(Indistinct chatter)

686
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,956
Look at this place.

687
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,057
Chad: Smells great.

688
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,263
After that,
you know what I mean?

689
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:55,898
Jason: Is that Sean?

690
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,834
Look who it is.

691
00:43:57,836 --> 00:43:59,869
What are you guys
doin' here?

692
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,704
What are we...
What are you doing here?

693
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:03,906
Huh?

694
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,676
Man, it was really
nice of you to call

695
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:08,277
your crew before you
entered this thing.

696
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:09,212
I know everybody's
really happy with you.
Celestina: Mmm-hmm.

697
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:11,381
Crew?
Mmm.

698
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:13,182
Oh, you mean my crew.
The crew that didn't
leave me in LA.

699
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:15,685
Look, man, let's just
get one thing straight,
all right?

700
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:18,121
We were done with LA,
but we were never
done with the mob.

701
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:20,423
Yeah. So this is
your new crew?

702
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:22,959
Yeah, well,
they ain't my book club.

703
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:26,896
Yeah, man.
Glad you made some
new friends, bro.

704
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:28,398
They any good?
They look pretty good.

705
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,767
Yeah, they're the best
of the best.

706
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:34,337
The best of the best?
Oh. That's a statement
right there. Yeah.

707
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,072
As long as you believe that.
I believe it.

708
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,441
Guys, we didn't
get that last part.

709
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:40,143
Could you guys just repeat it?

710
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:42,445
What?

711
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:44,080
And could you be
a little bit more hurt?
A little more vulnerable.

712
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:45,181
Sean: Who are you?

713
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,016
Could you maybe step back?

714
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,384
I'm with<i> the vortex.</i>

715
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,691
What's this about?
Wow!

716
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,960
That was Sean's best friend.

717
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,698
Come on, let's go
check out the room.

718
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,904
Welcome to your suite.

719
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,140
Care of<i> the vortex.</i>

720
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,142
(All cheering)

721
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,052
Feel it.

722
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:26,222
I love you, too,
my little munchkin puppy.

723
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,492
Yeah, you're such
a little Fluffy muffin.
You're so cute.

724
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:32,795
We'd have the best
time ever. I wish
you were here. I swear.

725
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:35,031
(Laughing)
I love you, baby.

726
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,766
Camille says, "hi."

727
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:38,267
(Makes whipping sound)

728
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,502
Send it to her.

729
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:06,996
There's a huge
bed upstairs.

730
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,298
(Sniffing)

731
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,434
Wanna check it out?
(Groaning)

732
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,870
Gross.

733
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,938
Please go away.

734
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,173
(Sniffing)

735
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:18,175
(Coughing)

736
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,943
What is that smell?

737
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,412
It's my scent.

738
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:28,785
Real smooth, buddy.
Real smooth.

739
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,253
(Laughing)

740
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:31,255
(Audience cheering)

741
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,166
Jason: Hey, the mob.

742
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:44,467
Anytime, baby. Mob up.

743
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,808
(Cheering continuing)

744
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:16,032
Good evening.
Welcome to<i> the vortex.</i>

745
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:17,034
(All cheering)

746
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:24,207
Tonight, you'll meet
the dancers of tomorrow.

747
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:26,209
Finest in the world.

748
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:29,912
Each vying to be
the lords of Vegas.

749
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:33,416
With a world-class
show of their own

750
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:35,952
at sensational Caesars Palace!

751
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,187
(Cheering)

752
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,457
Wish them luck.

753
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:43,893
They're gonna need it.

754
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:46,963
(Music playing)

755
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:23,432
(Grunting)

756
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,147
(Cheering)

757
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,437
Was that hot enough for you?

758
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,505
(Cheering)

759
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,543
So talented.

760
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:43,679
So full of hope and dreams.

761
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,715
They wish they could all stay.

762
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:49,518
But we only
have room for four.

763
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,556
The crews that will
fight it out in the
battle ring are...

764
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,460
Divine intention.

765
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:58,527
(Cheering)

766
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,104
Shh.

767
00:50:08,106 --> 00:50:10,172
The mob.

768
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,174
(Cheering)

769
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,751
The grim knights.

770
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,627
And lmntrix!

771
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,040
My God!

772
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,643
Andie: Who ate all
the muffins?

773
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,211
Kido: Andie, you did.

774
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,713
Andie: Is there more coffee?

775
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,681
Kido: Coffee.

776
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:55,184
All right, guys,
we gotta start
rehearsal soon.

777
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:56,585
(Sighing)

778
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:58,621
I don't think I can face
those camera crews anymore.

779
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:00,523
(Knocking on door)

780
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:02,591
Maid: Good morning!

781
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:03,759
Housekeeping?

782
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:13,069
This way. This is
the place I told you.

783
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,336
Sean.

784
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:15,338
(Speaking Spanish)

785
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,708
Good luck! Bye-bye!

786
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:23,446
Man! This is what I call
a great rehearsal space.

787
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,149
All right.

788
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:32,788
All right, yo,
yo, listen up.

789
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:36,492
That circus up there,
the cameras,
the people, the drama...

790
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:37,860
That's nothin'
but a distraction.

791
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:39,428
Could keep us from
winnin' this thing.

792
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,697
So let's stay focused,

793
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,165
and let's get to business.

794
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,366
All: Yeah!

795
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,473
(Music playing)

796
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:51,540
Chad: Whoo!

797
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:53,709
Go!

798
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,886
All: And one, and two...

799
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,529
Go like this. Follow me.

800
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,668
Five, six, seven, eight.

801
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:25,241
Okay.

802
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:28,811
Okay. Ready?
Let's go, come on.

803
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,147
Five, six, seven, eight.

804
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:34,517
One and two and three
and four and five and six
and seven and eight.

805
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,719
Make sure these are clean.

806
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:42,224
One and two and three
and four and five and six
and seven and eight.

807
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:44,193
Again, right away, let's go.

808
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:47,563
One and two and three and...
Stop! Stop! Stop!

809
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:50,199
He needs to catch on.
He's not doin' it right.
Let's do it again.

810
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:52,868
Five, six, seven, eight.

811
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:57,439
One and two and three
and four and five and
six, seven, eight.

812
00:52:58,608 --> 00:52:59,675
No!

813
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,744
Come on,
that was good, man.

814
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:04,680
Not good enough.
You wanna win?

815
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,248
I know you want
this as bad as I do.

816
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,650
We're tired, man.

817
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:09,618
Please, help me help
you guys, all right?

818
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,188
Andie: All right, I think
we've all had it for today.

819
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:15,424
Why don't you guys just
head out. We'll meet you
upstairs.

820
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:16,926
See you upstairs.
Yeah.

821
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:22,531
(Grunting)

822
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,207
Look, I wanna try
this thing with you

823
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,741
that I've been
imagining in my head.

824
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,276
(Chuckling)

825
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:35,744
Better be the dancing
you're talking about.

826
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:37,246
Easy.

827
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:40,382
(Panting)

828
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,385
All right.
You're gonna put
that leg right here,

829
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,787
that leg in my hand,

830
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,255
and hold on to
my neck, okay?

831
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:47,856
And then what?

832
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:49,625
Just trust me. Okay?

833
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,628
(Laughing)

834
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,630
You're so sweaty.

835
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:57,700
Come on, be serious. Okay?

836
00:53:57,702 --> 00:53:59,735
So, I'm gonna jump
into your other hand?

837
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:00,869
Yeah.

838
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,238
Okay.

839
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,608
Three, two... go ahead.

840
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,309
There we go.
Oh, my God.

841
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,011
Oh.
We got it.
We got it.

842
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:10,412
All right.
I'm gonna toss you up.

843
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,580
Now what? No!

844
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:12,615
And you're gonna
go into a layout.

845
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:14,483
No, put me down. Stop it.

846
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:17,886
Stop it. Put me down.

847
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,822
You gotta trust me.
You gotta let go.

848
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:21,890
Okay, I know that
you want some big,

849
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:23,993
cool move,
but you can't force it.

850
00:54:23,995 --> 00:54:26,028
Sounds like an excuse.

851
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,910
You saying I take
the easy way out,
or something?

852
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:32,001
You don't know
anything about me.

853
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:35,771
Do you know why I
was primping those
models when we met?

854
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,973
You know why
I was doing that?
No.

855
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,509
I was a part of this
amazing dance group.

856
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:43,045
We pushed ourselves so hard
that I blew out my knee.

857
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:44,813
Thought I'd never
dance again.

858
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,515
Yeah, really messed me up.

859
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:49,418
So, now, every time
I come down hard,

860
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,720
I'm just waiting to
hear that pop again.

861
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:57,726
Okay. Look, I get it.

862
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:02,498
But if you push past it
and get outta your head...
(Scoffs)

863
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,000
Oh, my gosh.

864
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,769
I can get over
an old knee injury, okay?

865
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:07,970
I'm not scared
to dance again.

866
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,806
What I don't want
to risk is this.

867
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,841
I love that I'm
a part of something again.

868
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,910
It's the closest
thing I know to family.

869
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,581
Sure, winning,
it's cool, it's great.

870
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,917
Hanging out with you guys,
though, being here.

871
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,553
Doing what I love.

872
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:27,856
It's all I care about.

873
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,798
Yeah, well,
it's not enough for me.

874
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,626
Honey, I was
looking for you.

875
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,099
What's wrong?

876
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:13,802
Sean. He's so frustrating.
He drives me crazy.

877
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,040
Do you know that he was
wearing ladies' underwear
on his head

878
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,742
when I first met him?

879
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:23,412
That's pretty funny.
You like him.

880
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:24,646
No, I don't.

881
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,716
He drives me nuts.

882
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,485
Yeah, that means
you like him.

883
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:30,519
Stop it.

884
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,756
Oh.

885
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:36,759
What I would like
is a night off. Okay?

886
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:38,894
Come on, we're in Vegas,
let's do something.

887
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,897
No, Sean will be
mad if we go out.

888
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,866
Whatever.

889
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:45,401
Let's get the crew.

890
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,670
Hmm?

891
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:50,839
Yeah? We go out?
Yeah.

892
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,975
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay. Let's go.

893
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:53,977
(Indistinct chatter)

894
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:58,647
We just gotta
get there, okay?

895
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,652
Vladd, what's up?

896
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:05,888
I think they're in love.
Kinda like us.

897
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,056
Oh.

898
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,468
Poor robot bastard.

899
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,116
Hey.

900
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,487
We're going out.

901
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:40,589
I know hanging out with us
isn't enough for you,

902
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:43,492
but the rest of us wanna
have some fun
while we're here.

903
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,030
(Scoffs)

904
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,735
Wait up.

905
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:55,938
(Music playing)

906
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,081
All: Whoa!

907
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:12,988
Ow!

908
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,847
Ha!

909
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,940
You wanna get out of here?
Take a walk?

910
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:05,942
Yeah.

911
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,648
Sean: Hey. You were right.
This was a great idea.

912
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,289
Come on.

913
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,763
Oh, yeah. (Laughing)

914
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:28,997
Welcome to the Clark inn.

915
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:30,732
Well, thank you.

916
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:31,967
(Both laughing)

917
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:33,201
What is this place?

918
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,305
Vintage...

919
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:38,240
Vintage park?
Vintage Vegas park.

920
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:39,341
Yeah.

921
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,713
So, you nervous about
going up against
the mob tomorrow?

922
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,818
Moose told me you
and eddy go way back.

923
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:54,923
We grew up together.
We were like brothers.

924
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,828
What about you?

925
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:02,130
What happened
between you and your ex?

926
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:05,200
Oh. Well, moose
must have told
you about chase.

927
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:07,035
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

928
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:09,805
I don't know.
Long distance
thing was kinda hard.

929
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,908
We were on tour,
so we were always

930
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,677
on different schedules,
different cities.

931
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:16,912
You know, it just
never seemed to work.

932
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:19,348
But that was
a really long time ago.

933
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,786
Dancing was the only
important thing to him.

934
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,724
He's an idiot.

935
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,193
(Music playing)

936
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,330
Oh, my God.

937
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:36,698
You kidding me?
(Laughing)

938
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,173
Thank you.

939
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,112
Old school Bobby brown.

940
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:51,279
Yeah.

941
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,827
(Both laughing)

942
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:10,786
(Indistinct chatter)

943
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:18,493
How come pot stickers taste
so much better in Vegas?

944
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:21,163
Because they're eggrolls.

945
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:23,165
Right? Go with this guy.

946
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:25,333
Give me one.
Try it.

947
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:26,968
Violet: You like it?
I liked it.

948
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:30,071
Monster: Ew!

949
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:32,140
Monster: Don't want your
stinky, goopy mess.

950
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:34,309
Gauge: Come on, bro.
Let it go, man.

951
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,877
No. No.

952
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:37,546
Monster: This guy's the worst.

953
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:41,082
Ugh!
Tries so hard, man.
Just so hard.

954
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:43,852
Yo. Mooski,
this is your song.
Yeah.

955
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:44,953
Come on,
moose, you gotta dance.

956
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,121
Nah.
Come on, moose.

957
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:47,422
Come on.
Do it! Do it!

958
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:49,090
Give us a little sump'n.

959
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,492
Go, go, go.

960
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,566
Let's go, man.

961
01:03:57,568 --> 01:03:58,834
(All cheering)

962
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:21,890
What?

963
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,262
All: Whoa!

964
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,020
(Laughing)

965
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,053
Oh, no.

966
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,239
Andie: Moose, I heard.

967
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:47,008
You okay?

968
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,176
What happened to Camille?

969
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,046
I don't know,
I can't find her.

970
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,981
I've called her
a million times.

971
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:56,484
I'm sure she's somewhere, man.
People don't just
disappear in Vegas.

972
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:58,687
Actually, it happens
all the time.

973
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:01,156
I watched on TV.<i> 20/20.</i>

974
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:02,223
Scary.

975
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:04,659
Kido.

976
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:07,996
Oh. My bad.
Sorry, mooski. Sorry.

977
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:10,598
She's probably
halfway to LA by now.

978
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,035
Come on, man.
There's no way she
went all the way back.

979
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:16,738
I had no idea that
girl was gonna kiss me.

980
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,507
Those moves?
I guess you were
just too irresistible.

981
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:24,179
Look, guys, I'm sorry.
All right.

982
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:25,580
I shouldn't be here.

983
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:27,515
It was all innocent fun.

984
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:29,284
I guess she didn't
know that, but...

985
01:06:29,286 --> 01:06:31,753
I just...
I need to go home.

986
01:06:31,755 --> 01:06:34,322
I mean, I love you guys.
This has all been great
and fun and all, but...

987
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,557
I mean, I love Camille.

988
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:40,261
Wait. Can't this wait?
We need you here.

989
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:42,130
We battle the mob tomorrow.

990
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:44,199
You can't just
abandon us now.

991
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:45,433
Yes, you can.

992
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:46,435
Are you kidding me?

993
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:47,569
No, I'm not kidding.

994
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,238
Get outta here.

995
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,707
Go do what you gotta do.

996
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,275
Sorry to let you guys down.

997
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,315
It's all good, bro.

998
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:01,449
(Sighing)

999
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:10,091
Alexxa: (Through speaker)
<i>And the winner is...</i>

1002
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,631
Yo. Divine intention
just got destroyed
by the grim knights.

1003
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:20,201
Monster: How we gonna
do this without moose?

1004
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:23,538
Hey, guys, come on.
Just stay focused, okay?

1005
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,607
We'll be just
fine without moose.

1006
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,776
Alexxa:<i> Stay tuned.</i>
<i>Up after the break,</i>

1007

1011
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,828
<i>I know I am.</i>

1012
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,197

<i>What about lmntrix?</i>

1016
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,244
This is crazy, man.

1017
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,712
I never thought
that me and you

1018
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:05,954
would end up
against each other.

1019
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:12,320
Are you seriously
ignoring me right now?
Because I swear to God, man...

1020
01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:14,522
Jason: Don't even
worry about it.
It's not even worth it.

1046
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:53,027
Alexxa:<i> In this fight to win</i>
<i>a three-year contract</i>

1047
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:54,996

1048
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,701
<i>A clash between lmntrix,</i>

1049
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:02,804
<i>who barely made
the qualifying rounds,</i>

1050
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:05,907

their way into the finals,</i>

1051
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:08,142

1052
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:09,844

1053
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:10,846
(All cheering)

1054
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:18,786
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

1055
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,822
<i>There will be blood
on the dance floor.</i>

1056
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:29,597
Hey. Hey. Hey!

1057
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:30,932
What happened out there?

1058
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:33,067
What happened out there?
Are you serious?

1059
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:35,670
You tried to pull me
into a dangerous trick
that I wasn't ready for.

1060
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:36,971
We were not ready for it.

1061
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,474
But we won. We made
it to the final round.

1062
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:40,675
That's all that matters?

1063
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,912
Ah. I should've
known better.

1064
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,918
Alexxa brava.

1065
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,488
You guys.
Cheers.

1066
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,890
Man: (On TV)<i> Next up on vh1,</i>

1067
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:58,259
<i>with an alexxa

1068
01:14:58,261 --> 01:15:00,194
<i>Sweat sugar dance voodoo!</i>

1069
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:03,598
<i>¶ You want my sweat
sugar dancing voodoo</i>

1070
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,533
<i>¶ you want the magic that I do</i>

1071
01:15:05,535 --> 01:15:09,136

1072
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:11,539
<i>¶ you want my sweat
sugar dancing voodoo ¶</i>

1073
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:12,940
Martin: That's the guy.
Marcos: That's
the grim knights guy.

1074
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:14,008
Hair: What guy?

1075
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,711
Martin: That ass clown Jasper.

1076
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:19,046
I knew I'd seen
that damn face before.
I knew it.

1077
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,748
Oh, my God, is he
wearing a sparkle thong?

1078
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:23,851
Monster: He looks
like a dead baby.

1079
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:26,053
Violet: Wait till Sean
hears about this.

1080
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:28,189
Oh. Where's Sean and Andie?

1081
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:30,191
I don't know,
but she was super pissed
after the battle.

1082
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:31,726
Hair: I don't know.
Her knee's been
bothering her.

1083
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:36,163
Wait, ice. We need ice.
We gotta keep
these babies chilled.

1084
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:37,965
Where's the bucket?

1085
01:15:37,967 --> 01:15:40,868
I think monster use
it to soak his foot.

1086
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,169
Ew!

1087
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:43,237
Come on, man.

1088
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:44,672
That's nasty.

1089
01:15:44,674 --> 01:15:46,040
Blisters.
You're nasty, bro.

1090
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,208
Dancers, blisters.
I do a lotta footwork.

1091
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,309
Hey, Andie.

1092
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:50,177
Hey. There she is.
There she is.

1093
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,247
Damn, gangster.

1094
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:56,150
I think I go
get ice, too.

1095
01:15:56,152 --> 01:16:00,655
All right. Okay, fill it up.
I'll fill that back up.

1096
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:02,256
What was up with Andie?

1097
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:03,958
Something happened to her.
I don't know.
She's really upset.

1098
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,793
Alexxa: You're being
so paranoid.

1099
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:07,895
Jasper: You said it
was gonna be the mob.

1100
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:11,866
Relax. It was a last-minute
creative decision.

1101
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:13,801
Lmntrix really
brought it last night,

1102
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,870
so we changed up
the plan a little.

1103
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:17,238
(Chuckling)

1104
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,040
Hmm.

1105
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:21,042
You guys duking it out

1106
01:16:21,044 --> 01:16:23,110
is gonna make for a much
more compelling storyline.

1107
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:24,979
Jasper: Yo, just don't
make a fool outta me.

1108
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:28,082
Don't worry, baby,
it's in the bag.

1109
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,617
This is gonna be
some killer TV.

1110
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:31,819
What?

1111
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:32,920
Alexxa: You don't trust me?

1112
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,722
Shh.
Jasper: You know I do.

1113
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:36,090
Oh. You do?

1114
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,224
Yeah.

1115
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:40,928
Then shut that

1116
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,966
pouty little mouth of yours.

1117
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:59,046
Holy balls.

1118
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:02,149
We just saw Jasper
and alexxa mackin' on each
other in the hallway.

1119
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:04,118
What? You sure?

1120
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,786
Who else dress like a zebra?

1121
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:10,157
We heard them talking,
and this whole <i> vortex</i>
<i>thing is scripted.</i>

1122
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,892
It's been planned.

1123
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:14,762
She said it was
gonna be killer TV
when we all went down.

1124
01:17:14,764 --> 01:17:16,364
So they had it
rigged from the beginning?

1125
01:17:16,366 --> 01:17:18,299
We never had a chance?

1126
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:20,134
The grim knights
were always gonna win.

1127
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,336
No, but America vote for us.

1128
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:24,672
Maybe they just thought
they were voting for us.

1129
01:17:24,674 --> 01:17:26,307
I don't believe this.

1130
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,109
Connect the dots, sister.

1131
01:17:28,111 --> 01:17:30,211
Jasper was her
backup dancer.

1132
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:31,979
Now he's her private dancer.

1133
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,115
Jasper was her
backup dancer?

1134
01:17:34,117 --> 01:17:36,217
Yeah. We just saw him on TV

1135
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:39,253
shaking his nasty ass
in alexxa brava's video.

1136
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,155
We gotta tell someone.

1137
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:45,059
Who we gonna tell?
The producers?
They're in on it, too.

1138
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:48,663
Of course it's rigged.
It's reality TV.
Nothing's real.

1139
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:50,865
I can't go back to
the sucky phone job.

1140
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:53,000
What about us?
We spin those
stupid sign for living.

1141
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,902
Man, this sucks.

1142
01:17:54,904 --> 01:17:56,384
For a second,
I thought we had a shot.

1143
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:01,342
Hard to go back to
our old lives now, huh?

1144
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:03,911
Okay, hang on.
We're still going
out there, okay?

1145
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:05,179
We've worked so hard.

1146
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,247
This is gonna
be an opportunity

1147
01:18:06,249 --> 01:18:08,015
for us to just go
out there and...

1148
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,984
What's the point? Huh?

1149
01:18:09,986 --> 01:18:11,352
We're not gonna
win this thing.
And I'm not going out there

1150
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:13,354
and humiliating myself
in front of the whole world.

1151
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:17,391
The point is that
we're an awesome crew
and amazing dancers.

1152
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,460
So, we're gonna go out
there and still show
them what we've got.

1153
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:21,362
This isn't about
winning some contest

1154
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:23,698
or some silly little prize.

1155
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,232
This was about
booking a job.

1156
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:27,034
Everyone in this
room is sick of

1157
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,103
scraping around
to pay their rent.

1158
01:18:29,105 --> 01:18:32,239
I live in a freakin'
little storage closet.

1159
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:35,843
This was about
all our hard work
finally paying off,

1160
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:38,245
so we can have
some actual stability.

1161
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:40,314
(Sighing)

1162
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:45,152
It was far more
than that for me.

1163
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,288
Moose: Camille?

1164
01:19:57,826 --> 01:19:59,059
You home?

1165
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,376
(Sirens blaring in distance)

1166
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:25,853
I knew I'd find you up here.

1167
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:32,326
Look, I know that
you're probably, like,

1168
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:35,596
super uber galactically
pissed at me right now,

1169
01:20:35,598 --> 01:20:38,032
but I'm really sorry.
And I don't know
how I let that happen.

1170
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:45,539
Seeing you and that girl,

1171
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,174
I wasn't just
jealous of her,

1172
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,946
but also of you.

1173
01:20:51,948 --> 01:20:57,017
You were just
having the best time,

1174
01:20:57,019 --> 01:21:00,521
and I didn't belong.

1175
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:03,324
I couldn't get out
of there fast enough.

1176
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:05,459
It felt gross.

1177
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:08,095
I just wanted to come home.

1178
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:11,632
But home doesn't feel
like home without you.

1179
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,536
Does this feel
like home to you?

1180
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,205
(Chuckling)

1181
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,540
Are you kidding me?

1182
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,243
I love my life with you,

1183
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:24,945
and I wouldn't trade it for
anything else in the world.

1184
01:21:24,947 --> 01:21:28,949
But being in the spotlight,
that's a big part
of who you are,

1185
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:31,585
and I feel like
I'm holding you back.

1186
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:35,222
I found the person
I wanna dance with,
all right?

1187
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:38,559
Yeah, we have jobs
and, yeah, we have
a nice apartment,

1188
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:41,328
but, I mean,
we're more than that.

1189
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:42,596
Can't we have it both ways?

1190
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,299
Yeah.

1191
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:46,634
That's what you want?

1192
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:48,903
Yeah.

1193
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,438
Are you sure?

1194
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:03,651
I'm sure.

1195
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,057
(Indistinct conversations)

1196
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:12,626
Ana: Sean!

1197
01:22:12,628 --> 01:22:15,562
Sean. Come.
Eat and drink
with us. Yes?

1198
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:18,465
This is so good.
I'm going to eat
the whole thing, I don't care.

1199
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:19,934
No worries.
So good.

1200
01:22:19,936 --> 01:22:22,069
She love it here, Sean.

1201
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:24,471
We're moving here.
Mmm.

1202
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:27,608
Oh. You have
to try this. So good.

1203
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,511
So, you guys didn't
take off with moose.

1204
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:33,647
Mooski, he knows
what's important.
He doesn't need us.

1205
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:36,050
And we would
never miss finale.

1206
01:22:36,052 --> 01:22:37,418
What time tomorrow
you dance, huh?

1207
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,619
We're not.

1208
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:43,057
Whole contest is rigged.

1209
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:44,699
This whole thing was
just a waste of time.

1210
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:49,630
The mob hates me.
Andie hates me.

1211
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,632
Viva Las Vegas, everybody.

1212
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:56,737
So you give up?

1213
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:01,508
Yeah.

1214
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:04,011
Better to quit now.
That's okay. We go back,
you clean toilets.

1215
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:06,046
I think the one in
the back is clogged, no?

1216
01:23:06,048 --> 01:23:08,749
Take it easy on him.
Can't you see his
heart is broken?

1217
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:13,554
You remember how we feel,
European championship?

1218
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:15,222
Boris: (Scoffs) That one.

1219
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,025
Sean...

1220
01:23:18,027 --> 01:23:20,561
European championship
dance final.

1221
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,598
I step on her foot.

1222
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,500
I break her foot.

1223
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:29,136
Boom. We lose.

1224
01:23:29,138 --> 01:23:32,373
I feel terrible,
but she forgive me.

1225
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,574
I'm not perfect.

1226
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:36,377
Ana: Who is perfect?

1227
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:40,280
Where is perfect?

1228
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:42,783
(Boris speaking
other language)

1229
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,186
Sheep poop, remember?

1230
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,325
Sean,

1231
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:55,763
sometime you just have
to shovel through it.
That's all.

1232
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,566
Ana: Yes, you have problems.

1233
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:02,503
You think winning is
all there is to life?

1234
01:24:02,505 --> 01:24:06,407
Is this the only
reason you work so hard

1235
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:10,377
and give up so
much to be here?

1236
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:21,188
(Speaking other language)

1237
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,145
You know what
you need to do.

1238
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:48,348
You do it.

1239
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:05,232
Wait, wait, wait.

1240
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:14,741
I'm sorry.

1241
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:18,712
I thought I could
fix everything.

1242
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:26,353
I thought I could figure
everything out, but...

1243
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:30,157
Okay, stop, stop,
stop, dude.

1244
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,860
You look absolutely
ridiculous when you cry.

1245
01:25:32,862 --> 01:25:35,696
Sorry. I just really
need a friend right now.

1246
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:38,465
Look, man,
you're my best friend.

1247
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:40,601
You're family.
Families fight. It's cool.

1248
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:44,471
You've been there
for me when I was
at my worst and,

1249
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:47,641
from the looks of it,
you could probably
use someone in your corner.

1250
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:51,845
But first you gotta
come and apologize to
the rest of the family

1251
01:25:51,847 --> 01:25:53,580
'cause they still
hate your guts.

1252
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:55,482
Come on. Get in here.

1253
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:56,850
Don't you dare
tell 'em I cried.

1254
01:25:56,852 --> 01:25:58,485
You look crazy when you cry.

1255
01:25:58,487 --> 01:25:59,887
I know. I didn't cry,
all right?

1256
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:08,929
Hey.

1257
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:12,399
Hold up.

1258
01:26:12,401 --> 01:26:14,801
Yo, please. I've got
a plan, okay?

1259
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:18,605
We can't go down
like this, guys.

1260
01:26:18,607 --> 01:26:20,507
Look...

1261
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:21,775
Where's Andie?

1262
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:23,777
She took off already.

1263
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:25,179
You said we were
all going home,

1264
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:27,181
and she didn't wanna
ride in the van with

1265
01:26:27,183 --> 01:26:28,749
everybody.

1266
01:26:28,751 --> 01:26:29,751
Yeah.

1267
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,655
Listen, drop your
bags, please,

1268
01:26:34,657 --> 01:26:36,757
and meet me in the basement
in 10 minutes, okay?

1269
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:38,759
(All mumbling)

1270
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,936
Andie: (Recording)
<i>Hey. It's Andie. Leave a</i>
<i>message after the beep.</i>

1271
01:26:48,938 --> 01:26:50,270
(Phone beeping)

1272
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:52,306
Hey. It's me.

1273
01:26:52,308 --> 01:26:56,910
Me and the crew have a plan
and we really need you.

1274
01:26:56,912 --> 01:27:00,214
So, if you get
this message in time,

1275
01:27:00,216 --> 01:27:01,949
we'll be in the basement.

1276
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:03,417
(Hushed talking)

1277
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,659
Thanks for coming, guys.

1278
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:18,332
This all started
out so simple.

1279
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:19,700
I love dancing.

1280
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:24,538
But everyone here knows
that it's not that easy

1281
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:27,674
when you're trying to
make a living out of it.

1282
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:29,977
Every day is a battle,

1283
01:27:29,979 --> 01:27:33,714
and we work so hard just
to be unappreciated
by some pop artist

1284
01:27:33,716 --> 01:27:36,350
or win some
little competition

1285
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:37,417
that everyone's
gonna forget about

1286
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:38,852
in a couple months.

1287
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:43,523
The thing is,

1288
01:27:43,525 --> 01:27:46,593
I wanted to win so bad that

1289
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:50,397
I didn't realize
what I was losing.

1290
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:55,569
Our lifestyle
isn't that easy.

1291
01:27:55,571 --> 01:27:58,505
But it's the one
we chose.

1292
01:27:58,507 --> 01:28:00,807
So I say we choose to
make the best of it.

1293
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:05,579
Tonight.

1294
01:28:05,581 --> 01:28:09,916
Not for the show,
for the people watching,
but for us.

1295
01:28:09,918 --> 01:28:12,953
This is what matters.
And I see that now.

1296
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,055
Nice.

1297
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,560
I thought you were gone.

1298
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:23,697
Well, I'm back.

1299
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:25,732
Lmntrix is dancing,
so am I.

1300
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:27,401
I'm not letting
my crew down.

1301
01:28:27,403 --> 01:28:28,535
Thanks for coming in.

1302
01:28:28,537 --> 01:28:29,870
I'm not doing this for you.

1303
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,707
So, you guys
wanna do this?

1304
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:34,941
Somebody got the music?

1305
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:38,078
What, you thought
I'd let you guys down?

1306
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,046
Moose!

1307
01:28:39,048 --> 01:28:40,814
Moose!

1308
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:42,382
And we're back!

1309
01:28:42,384 --> 01:28:44,017
We started this thing, right?
Let's finish it.

1310
01:28:44,019 --> 01:28:45,939
Yo. Hold up.
You're not going
anywhere without us.

1311
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:47,854
Yo.

1312
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:50,891
Thanks for coming, man.

1313
01:28:50,893 --> 01:28:52,392
Gauge: Really?

1314
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:56,463
Everybody, this is my family.

1315
01:28:56,465 --> 01:28:58,765
New family,
meet the old family.

1316
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:01,735
Y'all get along, okay?

1317
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:04,338
Yo.

1318
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:05,872
Okay. Let's try.

1319
01:29:05,874 --> 01:29:08,475
What's up, man?
Nice to meet you.

1320
01:29:08,477 --> 01:29:11,411
All right, so, guys,
what's the plan?

1321
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:15,515
They rigged this thing?

1322
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:17,451
We'll give 'em a taste
of their own medicine.

1323
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,687
We bring the fuckin'
house down.

1324
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:21,755
(Cheering)

1325
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:24,624
(Audience cheering)

1326
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,967
Good evening,
children of<i> the vortex.</i>

1327
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:36,036
(Cheering)

1328
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:43,710
We are at
Caesars Palace tonight,

1329
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,913
and we are ready
to settle the score.

1330
01:29:46,915 --> 01:29:51,885
One team will leave here
the champions of<i> the vortex,</i>

1331
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,154
with a three-year
Vegas contract.

1332
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:56,523
And one team will just

1333
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:59,626
leave.

1334
01:29:59,628 --> 01:30:01,828
(All laughing)

1335
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:05,866
Remember to text your votes.
And be merciless.

1336
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:09,503
And now,

1337
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:11,772
the moment we've
all been waiting for.

1338
01:30:11,774 --> 01:30:16,410
The grim knights
versus lmntrix.

1339
01:30:16,412 --> 01:30:17,412
(All cheering)

1340
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:25,952
(Music playing)

1341
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:39,132
Whoo!

1342
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:48,775
Come on.

1343
01:30:58,453 --> 01:30:59,453
(All grunting)

1344
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:02,275
Come on. Come on.

1345
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:07,247
Let's go.

1346
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:10,216
You want some of me?
You want some? Let's go!

1347
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:12,278
(All cheering)

1348
01:34:17,184 --> 01:34:20,987
Y'all know what it is!
Let's go! Grim knights!

1349
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:26,126
Weren't the grim
knights amazing?

1350
01:34:26,128 --> 01:34:28,094
(Cheering)

1351
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,829
So hot.

1352
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:34,134
They're gonna be
very hard to beat.

1353
01:34:34,136 --> 01:34:36,903
Next up, lmntrix.

1354
01:34:36,905 --> 01:34:37,905
(All cheering)

1355
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:46,179
Sean: Thank you. Thank you.

1356
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:50,684
I just wanna say how
much we've enjoyed
being a part of this contest.

1357
01:34:50,686 --> 01:34:55,989
And, uh, it's been
a life-changing ride.

1358
01:34:55,991 --> 01:35:00,126
And to be going up
against the grim knights.
What an honor.

1359
01:35:00,128 --> 01:35:02,328
And what
a compelling storyline.

1360
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:05,832
It's gonna make
for some killer TV.

1361
01:35:08,803 --> 01:35:13,073
You know, I came here to
win, but I'm okay if that
doesn't happen.

1362
01:35:13,075 --> 01:35:15,075
Tomorrow, we might be
back to our day jobs.

1363
01:35:15,077 --> 01:35:19,479
But tonight, we're
living the dream together!

1364
01:35:19,481 --> 01:35:24,050
Because I'm up
here on this stage
with the best dancers...

1365
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,151
No.

1366
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:27,954
The best of friends.

1367
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:34,461
And a phenomenal woman

1368
01:35:34,463 --> 01:35:37,864
who's taught me
what really matters.

1369
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:46,072
So what do you say
we all just forget
about this winning or losing,

1370
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:47,373
and just enjoy the show?

1371
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:48,441
(All applauding)

1372
01:35:58,285 --> 01:35:59,886
(Music playing)

1373
01:36:30,518 --> 01:36:31,785
(All cheering)

1374
01:38:02,309 --> 01:38:03,943
Yeah!

1375
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:09,182
Is that fire?

1376
01:38:09,184 --> 01:38:10,617
No, no, no.

1377
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,250
What the hell's goin' on?

1378
01:39:17,252 --> 01:39:20,053
Yo, I don't know.
This is some horseshit.

1379
01:39:20,055 --> 01:39:21,487
The mob can't dance.
This is cheating.

1380
01:39:21,489 --> 01:39:22,689
I know.

1381
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:09,702
Ah-ha!

1382
01:40:28,722 --> 01:40:30,556
Yo, this is crazy.

1383
01:40:30,558 --> 01:40:31,624
I know!

1384
01:41:40,561 --> 01:41:41,627
(All cheering)

1385
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:49,662
Hey.

1386
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:52,932
Let's do it.

1387
01:42:52,934 --> 01:42:54,333
Let's do the move.

1388
01:42:54,335 --> 01:42:56,469
Yeah?

1389
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:57,503
You better catch me.

1390
01:42:57,505 --> 01:42:58,671
Trust me.

1391
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:11,584
(All cheering)

1392
01:43:11,586 --> 01:43:12,652
Oh!

1393
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:35,274
(Audience cheering)

1394
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:04,971
What?

1395
01:44:04,973 --> 01:44:07,974
But I haven't even
tallied the votes yet.

1396
01:44:07,976 --> 01:44:10,876
Did you see the stuff
on the chandeliers?

1397
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:15,448
I understand.

1398
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,584
Yes.

1399
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:21,520
This crew will make
a fabulous show at
the hotel.

1400
01:44:21,522 --> 01:44:22,588
Mmm-hmm.

1401
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:25,291
They got the show?

1402
01:44:25,293 --> 01:44:26,692
Yes, they got the show.

1403
01:44:26,694 --> 01:44:29,528
Go pack my bags.
I need a week in Cancun.

1404
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:31,731
Dancer: What just happened?
Lmntrix just won?

1405
01:45:19,646 --> 01:45:23,382
Sean:<i> Like I said, the life</i>
<i>of a dancer is not easy.</i>

1406
01:45:23,384 --> 01:45:25,618
<i>But sometimes
everything lines up.</i>

1407
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:27,586
<i>The world is in sync,</i>

1408
01:45:27,588 --> 01:45:31,624
<i>and for one perfect moment
you feel totally alive.</i>

1409
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:11,030
(Both laughing)

1410
01:46:14,101 --> 01:46:15,901
(Laughing)

1411
01:46:15,903 --> 01:46:17,036
B mark!

1412
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:27,680
Man: One, and two, and...
(Splashing)

1413
01:46:27,682 --> 01:46:30,042
One, and two, and three,
and four, and five.
(Glass breaking)

1414
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:32,585
You have a tag here.
Oops.

1415
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:36,455
(Grunting)

1416
01:46:36,457 --> 01:46:37,523
(All laughing)

1417
01:46:40,961 --> 01:46:41,994
There it is!

1418
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:45,398
A mark!

1419
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,400
Pot sticker?

1420
01:46:48,835 --> 01:46:49,835
(Laughing)

1421
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,809
Just shut that
pouty little mouth.

1422
01:47:31,545 --> 01:47:33,045
Yeah.

1423
01:47:33,047 --> 01:47:33,979
Pot sticker?

1424
01:47:33,981 --> 01:47:35,047
Spring roll!

1425
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:38,651
Man: Egg roll!
One more time.
Here we go.

1426
01:47:38,653 --> 01:47:41,520
Egg roll, right?

1427
01:47:41,522 --> 01:47:43,789
I'm going to shove
my mane in your mouth.

1428
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:46,692
Bite it! Bite it!
Bite it!

1429
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:51,931
Man: One more time.
Ready, and...

1430
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:55,868
Put me down.
Put me down.
Put me down.

1431
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:58,771
You gotta trust me.

1432
01:47:58,773 --> 01:48:00,105
I'm sorry,
that was a bit weird
at the end for me.

1433
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:01,240
(Laughing)

1434
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:04,176
You gotta...

1435
01:48:04,178 --> 01:48:05,244
(Laughing)

1436
01:48:42,115 --> 01:48:43,182
Bye, guys.

1437
01:48:43,184 --> 01:48:44,184
(All laughing)

1438
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:00,933
(Laughing)

1439
01:49:02,636 --> 01:49:04,837
How long do you
want me to hold this?
