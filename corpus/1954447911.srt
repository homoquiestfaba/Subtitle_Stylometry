1
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:28,766
<i>I think that there's
something wrong with me.</i>

2
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:33,004
For some reason I find that
the girls that I like as human beings,

3
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:34,772
I'm not sexually attracted to,

4
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,808
and the ones that I am
sexually attracted to,

5
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,810
I don't particularly
like as human beings...

6
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,778
and on the rare occasion when
one falls in both categories,

7
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:43,715
they usually have a
boyfriend or a husband...

8
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:45,650
and Lord knows I've got
enough of that bad karma

9
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:47,251
to last me a lifetime.

10
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:52,090
These are classic Freudian
symptoms, Conrad.

11
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:55,931
Haven't you ever read
about defense mechanisms?

12
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:59,998
Actually I've always considered myself

13
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:01,367
more of a Jungian.

14
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:28,853
Your phone is ringing again.

15
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,421
Please stop talking.

16
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:32,423
You stop talking.

17
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:33,424
All right.

18
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:39,297
Morning.

19
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,298
<i>It's 1 p.m.</i>

20
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:41,332
Afternoon.

21
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,767
<i>Conrad Valmont?</i>

22
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:44,802
Yes, it's Conrad Valmont.

23
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,804
<i>Oh, yes, Security will be there</i>

24
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:50,073
<i>within the hour to escort
you from the premises.</i>

25
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:51,310
What?

26
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:55,223
<i>But I've lived here since birth.</i>

27
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:07,092
<i>This is Conrad Valmont.</i>

28
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:10,828
<i>Conrad was the son of a
Grecian entrepreneur</i>

29
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,197
<i>and a Caledonian debutante.</i>

30
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:17,802
<i>His father, Jean-Louis Valmont,
owned The Valmont Hotel</i>

31
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:20,775
<i>as had his father and
his father before him.</i>

32
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,174
<i>Their country home in Great Neck</i>

33
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:26,978
<i>was the pantheon of summer gatherings.</i>

34
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,180
<i>On the eve of his 51st year,</i>

35
00:03:29,181 --> 00:03:30,882
<i>Jean-Louis took Conrad's mother</i>

36
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:32,350
<i>to the south of France</i>

37
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,186
<i>on what was to be a weekend excursion.</i>

38
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:37,421
<i>It had since turned into a lavish escapade</i>

39
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:41,292
<i>around the world, lasting
nearly three decades.</i>

40
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:42,960
<i>Over he subsequent years,</i>

41
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:45,496
<i>Conrad was raised by The Valmont's staff.</i>

42
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:47,498
<i>His chauffeur, Bernard,</i>

43
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,466
<i>had taken Conrad to a Parisian brothel</i>

44
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,435
<i>for his 13th birthday</i>

45
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:56,306
<i>as a sort of rite of passage
into polite society.</i>

46
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,311
<i>It was a family tradition.</i>

47
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:02,847
<i>At present, he was working
on his magnum opus,</i>

48
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:04,149
<i>a great New York novel</i>

49
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,052
<i>in the tradition of
Fitzgerald and Edith Wharton.</i>

50
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:10,121
<i>It was widely speculated as to where he was</i>

51
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:11,856
<i>in the process of writing it.</i>

52
00:04:11,857 --> 00:04:14,058
<i>When asked, he would simply reply,</i>

53
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:15,559
I'm in the gathering stages.

54
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,129
<i>Conrad had been in the gathering stages</i>

55
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,232
<i>for several years now.</i>

56
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:24,602
<i>Last week Thursday, Conrad's
parents had capsized</i>

57
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:26,970
<i>and had become stranded on a small island</i>

58
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,272
<i>in the Mediterranean.</i>

59
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:30,241
<i>Having to spend numerous days together</i>

60
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:32,076
<i>without the distractions of wealth</i>

61
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:33,477
<i>and a transient lifestyle,</i>

62
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:36,080
<i>they've come to a simple realization,</i>

63
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,616
<i>they didn't particularly like one another.</i>

64
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,852
<i>Conrad's parents were to
divorce by the week's end</i>

65
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:43,487
<i>and neither wanted to continue paying</i>

66
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:46,857
<i>for Conrad's extravagant lifestyle.</i>

67
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:49,359
<i>Hence, the Valmont board of trustees</i>

68
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,229
<i>had requested hotel security</i>

69
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,066
<i>to escort Conrad from
the premises by 2 p.m.</i>

70
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:56,299
<i>Bunny, please make yourself useful.</i>

71
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,869
<i>Get some more cigarettes, please.</i>

72
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,973
- Hey!
- What?

73
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:02,206
I'm hungry.

74
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:05,376
I'll be right there!

75
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:06,376
Wha... I don't understand.

76
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:07,311
What do you mean they
won't accept the charges?

77
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:09,347
Did you tell them it was Conrad Valmont?

78
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:10,617
Hello.

79
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,354
What are you smiling at?

80
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:18,955
Uh, nothing.

81
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:19,957
Come on, Bunny.

82
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,393
Bernard, please take us
to the Belleville Café.

83
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,629
<i>Uh, I'm sorry.</i>

84
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,935
I-I can't.

85
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:30,869
Hey, it's me.

86
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,903
I'm going to have this
sorted out in no time.

87
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:35,507
I can't. I mean, it's orders from the boss.

88
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:37,509
I'm sorry, Connie.

89
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:41,179
- Can you do me a favor?
- Name it.

90
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,347
Can you take care of
Napoleon while I'm gone?

91
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:44,355
Of course.

92
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:46,417
<i>This is lame!</i>

93
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:47,652
I'm going to go.

94
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:49,320
No, Bunny.

95
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,111
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

96
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,126
Listen.

97
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:57,461
Can I borrow some cash for a cab?

98
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:00,264
No?

99
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:06,237
I'll be in touch.

100
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:14,477
<i>Conrad chose to ride the subway,</i>

101
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,246
<i>a convention he rarely took up</i>

102
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:18,015
<i>since he had learned how to hail a cab</i>

103
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:20,350
<i>at the age of seven.</i>

104
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:21,986
<i>But it was on this rare occasion</i>

105
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,054
<i>that he first saw Beatrice.</i>

106
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,161
<i>Her unassuming beauty struck him at once,</i>

107
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:29,660
<i>and as his eyes gazed down,
he couldn't help but notice</i>

108
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:32,595
<i>she was reading</i> Sense and Sensibility.

109
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:34,665
<i>Immediately, Conrad had reasoned</i>

110
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,734
<i>she could be no older than 19</i>

111
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:41,172
<i>and would easily be molded
into a girl of his liking.</i>

112
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:43,273
<i>Of course, there was
always the outside chance</i>

113
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:46,744
<i>that she was merely a Jane Austin fan,</i>

114
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:50,317
<i>but Conrad quickly ruled
that out on a hunch.</i>

115
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:54,618
<i>Herein lies the eternal question,</i>

116
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,156
<i>is it a grocery list...</i>

117
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,593
<i>or her phone number?</i>

118
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:06,597
<i>It was at that moment Conrad realized</i>

119
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:09,670
<i>he was going to see her naked.</i>

120
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,239
<i>I think I'm in love.</i>

121
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,741
Conrad, you've only just met her.

122
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:19,410
I know.

123
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:20,908
<i>Is she attractive?</i>

124
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:21,946
Yes.

125
00:07:21,947 --> 00:07:24,248
You know, you have an unhealthy obsession

126
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:26,116
with female beauty.

127
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:27,085
I don't care.

128
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:29,653
Maybe you should try
dating more homely women.

129
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:30,787
I don't think so.

130
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:31,789
Take it from me,

131
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,059
someone who's been married
for 25 years, Conrad,

132
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,162
<i>inner beauty doesn't age.</i>

133
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,701
You're just saying that
because your wife is unattractive.

134
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,135
- Conrad...
- Yes...

135
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:45,602
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

136
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:47,571
You have no home.

137
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:49,407
Move in with Dylan, of course.

138
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:50,573
How about money?

139
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:53,376
I'd need some, thank you, yes.

140
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:56,112
Conrad, I'm not your accountant.

141
00:07:56,113 --> 00:07:57,113
I'm your analyst.

142
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,383
Well, I'm certainly not
going to travel downtown

143
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:00,818
and work for ten hours a day

144
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,321
for the best 20 years of my life

145
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:04,422
doing some dull, unimaginative work,

146
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:07,391
certainly non-altruistic work,

147
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,392
no thanks.

148
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:13,330
Conrad, there's an interesting case study

149
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:15,665
a colleague of mine did a few years back.

150
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,169
The subject was a young German woman

151
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,272
who had been diagnosed with a brain tumor.

152
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:24,708
It rendered her witty, charming,

153
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,110
and quite likeable to most.

154
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,375
You trying to set me up?

155
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:32,816
Though she possessed all the
aforementioned attributes,

156
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:36,119
her life was actually
completely artificial.

157
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,690
<i>She had no meaning, no emotion,</i>

158
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:41,459
<i>not a care in the world.</i>

159
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,393
Hm.

160
00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:44,795
She seemed utterly blissful to an outsider,

161
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:49,834
but her family and friends
were worried, even horrified.

162
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:54,370
German neurologists called it witzelsucht,

163
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:57,141
the joking disease.

164
00:08:57,142 --> 00:09:00,878
But eventually, a dissolution set in

165
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,452
and her life was left empty.

166
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:11,388
Are you saying that I have a brain tumor?

167
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,456
<i>Conrad's analyst had given Conrad</i>

168
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:18,829
<i>a low-interest loan in
the amount of $217.33,</i>

169
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,500
<i>the entirety of his wallet's remains.</i>

170
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,468
<i>Conrad's ego was in no position</i>

171
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:28,538
<i>to admit the reality of his impoverishment.</i>

172
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:31,774
<i>Consequently, he had decided
not to tell Dylan...</i>

173
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:32,843
Ding-dong.

174
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:34,411
...<i> Or anyone, for that matter,</i>

175
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:35,716
<i>of his financial woes.</i>

176
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:39,883
Bonjour, comrade.

177
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:41,284
Bonjour.

178
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:43,620
<i>This is Dylan Tate.</i>

179
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,223
<i>Dylan was an antisocial socialist,</i>

180
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:50,326
<i>a closet conversationalist,
a clinical neurotic.</i>

181
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:53,430
<i>Possessing an inimitable
talent for the arts,</i>

182
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,266
<i>Dylan had been afforded the opportunity</i>

183
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:57,801
<i>to travel the world and live
a comfortable lifestyle</i>

184
00:09:57,802 --> 00:10:00,303
<i>at his own expense,</i>

185
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:02,508
<i>something Conrad knew nothing about.</i>

186
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,341
<i>Dylan Tate was the only personage</i>

187
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:08,745
<i>of all Conrad's acquaintances
whom he admired,</i>

188
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:10,648
<i>and to a bigger extent</i>

189
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:15,451
<i>than he liked to admit to himself and me.</i>

190
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:16,553
How was Greece?

191
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:18,888
- You mean Bhutan.
- Semantics.

192
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,324
I got back a couple of days ago.

193
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:22,459
Uh-hm.

194
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,394
Do you mind if I stay with you for a while?

195
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:26,870
Sure, come on in.

196
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,471
<i>So, what happened?</i>

197
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:38,709
We are remodeling at The Valmont again.

198
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,643
<i>Where's Jocelyn?</i>

199
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:41,644
I don't know.

200
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:43,747
<i>Ugh, it's been a couple of weeks.</i>

201
00:10:43,748 --> 00:10:46,316
What I first perceived
as cute and endearing

202
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:49,586
was actually quite exhausting,

203
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:52,455
her episodic hysteria, her
chronic dissatisfaction,

204
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:53,856
<i>her endless pragmatism.</i>

205
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:55,426
You know you two always do this, right?

206
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:57,427
One of you screams,
the other one comes running back.

207
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:58,829
I-I bought her a Volvo.

208
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,700
You bought her a Vol,
why, why do you always buy them a Volvo?

209
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,497
I don't know.

210
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:05,569
It's like a free ticket to leave.

211
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,673
How can I feel guilty, you know?

212
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:11,244
I bought her a Volvo.

213
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:13,310
You know what really pisses me off

214
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,945
about this whole thing is that I'm the one

215
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:17,547
who funded her entire vegan fashion line,

216
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,749
and now that every socialite in St. Bart's

217
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,720
thinks it's fashionable,
I get the swift kick.

218
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:25,195
Swift kick? I thought you
broke it off with her.

219
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,326
I did but still.

220
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:32,763
So, Henri, over at the gallery,

221
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:34,731
he set me up on a date last week.

222
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:35,800
That bad, huh?

223
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,433
You can always tell what
somebody thinks of you

224
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:39,802
by who they set you up with.

225
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:42,751
Is it wrong to be aroused by
a bunch of 17-year-old girls

226
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:46,643
<i>running around with knee-high
socks and polyester shorts?</i>

227
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:47,778
Well, I guess that's a decision

228
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,479
every man has to make for himself,

229
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,282
but yes, obviously yes.

230
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:53,584
Conrad needs a girlfriend.

231
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:55,319
No, no, no. We don't need girlfriends.

232
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,653
This is not the time for girlfriends.

233
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:58,821
This is a time for us to read and to write

234
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:02,692
and to have deviant fetishistic
sex with prostitutes.

235
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:04,994
Please, this from a serial monogamist.

236
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,464
You've never even been with a prostitute.

237
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,399
I understand that, if you'll indulge me.

238
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,566
I'm going through a rough break-up.

239
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:12,069
I need to have certain...

240
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,872
reassurances about the
prospect of bachelorhood.

241
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:15,973
Look alive, look alive.

242
00:12:15,974 --> 00:12:17,574
<i>Need a new goalie?</i>

243
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:18,675
Don't make eye contact.

244
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:20,610
<i>Hey, mister, give us back our ball.</i>

245
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:22,312
Interaction is inappropriate.

246
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:23,980
I can play.

247
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:24,981
Hm. We should move.

248
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:28,855
Like little veal.

249
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:32,755
<i>So, I met a woman a couple weeks ago.</i>

250
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:35,058
<i>I don't know, I can't
get her out of my head.</i>

251
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,759
What happened to the
prospects of bachelorhood?

252
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,062
I know. I just find it completely

253
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:40,958
overwhelmingly tedious and unnerving.

254
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:44,335
So, tell me about the girl.

255
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,202
What are the details?

256
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,604
She's like an ingenue in a Chekov play.

257
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:49,940
You know, one of those awfully
romantic virtuous types,

258
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:52,475
completely self-inhibited, doesn't drink.

259
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,513
Didn't have sex until she was 21,

260
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,580
read the bulk of the Victorian classics.

261
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,416
Jesus, sounds like a real keeper.

262
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,718
Oh, she is, she really is.

263
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,952
I'm... I'm way over my head.

264
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:05,055
Is she attractive?

265
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:07,358
Hm, she's a model.

266
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:10,728
<i>If I ever lost my fortune</i>

267
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:14,031
<i>and was completely disinherited,
could you ever see me</i>

268
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:16,933
as a struggling bohemian artist type,

269
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,724
hypothetically speaking, of course?

270
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:21,638
That reminds me,

271
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,040
do you want to come with
me to the cocktail benefit

272
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,642
at the Woodruff Modern tonight?

273
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,009
- Nope.
- Come on.

274
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,144
You know I don't like those things.

275
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:29,146
It'll be fun. You can...

276
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:30,013
Probably not.

277
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:32,449
Then you can, uh, meet the ingenue.

278
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,550
Is it a date?

279
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:34,651
Not exactly.

280
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,920
We do this thing where we
don't really go out together.

281
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:37,720
We just call each other

282
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:38,654
to make sure the other is going to be

283
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:40,990
at a certain place at a preordained time,

284
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,255
- and then...
- Adorable.

285
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,495
...we just happen to bump into one another.

286
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:47,130
It's less pressure.

287
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:49,399
So do you want to come
to the cocktail party?

288
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,639
Well, I'll need a cocktail first.

289
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,007
Are you wearing perfume?

290
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:59,542
No, it's a new cologne that
I'm wearing for my date.

291
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:00,701
Why? What do you think?

292
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:04,114
Well, I think it smells like perfume.

293
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:06,888
No, the woman at Bergdorf's
told me that it's unisex.

294
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:12,099
And you wanted to smell sexually ambiguous?

295
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:19,532
Good evening and welcome
to this evening's benefit.

296
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,599
I must say I'm more than thrilled

297
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,201
to see so many familiar faces.

298
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:28,739
Enjoy the complimentary hors
d'oeuvres and champagne,

299
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,675
and remember, make a donation.

300
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:33,615
Cheers!

301
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:40,153
<i>This is Beatrice Fairbanks.</i>

302
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,888
<i>Beatrice had attended a rather
strict etiquette school</i>

303
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,757
<i>on a bi-weekly basis.</i>

304
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:49,893
<i>In doing so, Beatrice had
been quietly instilled</i>

305
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:53,095
<i>with a certain Victorian idolatry,</i>

306
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:56,667
<i>a paragon of virtue.</i>

307
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:58,701
<i>Beatrice had been forced at a young age</i>

308
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:01,037
<i>to learn the works of Bach, Chopin,</i>

309
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:04,074
<i>and other masters of classical music,</i>

310
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:07,677
<i>though secretly she'd
always wanted to play jazz.</i>

311
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:11,816
<i>Oddly, Beatrice had opted to
become and editorial model...</i>

312
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:17,186
<i>...an occupation that only
heightened her insecurities.</i>

313
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:18,187
<i>C'est magnifique!</i>

314
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:19,657
<i>Un petite oiseau.</i>

315
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:25,829
<i>Beatrice was a firm believer</i>

316
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,798
<i>in mystics, psychics, and the occult,</i>

317
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,201
<i>which ran counter to the debutante norm</i>

318
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:35,272
<i>which favored incessant psychoanalysis.</i>

319
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:36,940
What does it mean?

320
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:40,076
So what do you think of my cologne?

321
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:42,045
Oh, that's you.

322
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:43,880
You probably didn't get a good...

323
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,615
It's a little feminine.

324
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:48,085
The woman at Bergdorf's
told me it was unisex.

325
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:50,119
<i>Hi, she was clearly lying.</i>

326
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,754
He smells pretty, doesn't he?

327
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:56,627
Um, Beatrice, this is my friend Conrad.

328
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:58,629
Conrad, Beatrice.

329
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,596
- We've met.
- Just briefly.

330
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:02,666
<i>- On the subway.</i>
- Subway?

331
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,634
Uh-hm. I gave him my, um...

332
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:07,604
Scarf, she gave me her scarf. It was cold.

333
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:08,971
<i>I'm going to need that back from you.</i>

334
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:11,774
Okay. I'll give it to you.

335
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,975
Uh-hm.

336
00:16:12,976 --> 00:16:14,043
I can get it...

337
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:16,312
from you... to give to her.

338
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:20,117
I think I see foie gras.

339
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:21,918
Want some... duck?

340
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,322
No. Take your time.

341
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:27,824
He's... That's so nice of you.

342
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,292
Obviously I've got a target on my back.

343
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:31,795
I didn't even know it,
I didn't even know it,

344
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:33,095
and listen to this,

345
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:35,965
my mistress says she
doesn't want to have sex

346
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,633
because she's afraid she'll get pregnant.

347
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:39,635
I told her at the rate we have intercourse,

348
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:40,637
the only way that's going to happen

349
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:42,572
<i>is through immaculate conception.</i>

350
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:43,773
Hm-hm.

351
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:45,242
Didn't you say she was on the pill?

352
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:46,042
Yeah, yeah, she is,

353
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:47,911
but she says she's afraid of the 1%,

354
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,047
and besides, she wants to get off.

355
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:51,614
<i>It gives her mood swings.</i>

356
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:52,648
Awful, just awful.

357
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,318
You already have a wife

358
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:55,819
that doesn't want to sleep with you.

359
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,155
Touché.

360
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:04,060
Don't you find that the virtuous ideals

361
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,262
of the Victorian authors
is somewhat unrealistic

362
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:07,230
and sentimental?

363
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:10,701
No, not at all, and as the century went on,

364
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:13,604
<i>the scope of the genre
became far more complex.</i>

365
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:16,206
You do realize that the monicker
of Victorian literature

366
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:19,675
ranges from the Bronte sisters to Kipling?

367
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:21,243
Yes.

368
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:23,913
Have you ever actually
read any of their books?

369
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:26,216
No, but I'm...

370
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:28,819
I'm heavily considering it.

371
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:32,789
She wouldn't have left...

372
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,700
There she is.

373
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,933
Hey.

374
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:45,335
Hi.

375
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:48,070
So, where... where you heading now?

376
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:49,772
I have to go to bed. I
have work in the morning.

377
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:51,141
Yeah, me too.

378
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:54,044
So, what are you working on these days?

379
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:55,778
Nothing in particular.

380
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:56,880
I'm open to new ideas.

381
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:58,382
You sound very ambitious.

382
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:00,984
Actually I am in the
gathering stages of a novel.

383
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:06,088
It is to be one of the
great New York novels

384
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:09,925
in the tradition of
Fitzgerald, Edith Wharton.

385
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:11,961
He's been in the gathering
stages for over a decade.

386
00:18:11,962 --> 00:18:13,396
Well, all good things take time.

387
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:15,065
I rushed my first novel,

388
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:16,767
I don't want to suffer the same pitfalls

389
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:19,870
as my predecessors with
my sophomore effort.

390
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:21,337
I don't think you finished your first novel

391
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:22,806
and I'm pretty sure it can't qualify

392
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:23,940
as a sophomore effort

393
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,008
if you don't finish your first book.

394
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,277
Finish it.

395
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:30,814
Nonetheless, everybody knows
that there are certain pitfalls

396
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:32,149
associated with a sophomore effort

397
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,752
that I simply want to avoid, period.

398
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:37,854
Avoid it by not doing it.

399
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,389
Dylan.

400
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,093
Well, good night.

401
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:44,102
Good night.

402
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:52,313
Don't you try anything.

403
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:55,739
I won't.

404
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,375
Don't try anything.

405
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,815
I won't.

406
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:04,815
- Don't.
- I...

407
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:13,890
<i>Nearly 30 minutes had passed,</i>

408
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:15,459
<i>and Beatrice could still feel the rush</i>

409
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,864
<i>from Conrad's flirtation.</i>

410
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:21,797
Don't try anything.

411
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:24,133
I won't.

412
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,802
Not this one.

413
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:30,442
Dylan... I won't.

414
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:42,885
Don't try anything.

415
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:45,090
I won't!

416
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,092
<i>The two friends' competitive nature</i>

417
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:51,995
<i>which had spanned nearly three decades</i>

418
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:53,797
<i>stemmed from the simple fact</i>

419
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:56,165
<i>that they each not only envied the other</i>

420
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,471
<i>but wanted secretly to be the other.</i>

421
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:04,211
<i>Neither one ever spoke of this.</i>

422
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:10,012
You know, just because you're almost 40

423
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:12,181
and still getting a weekly
allowance from your parents

424
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:14,084
doesn't mean you can just do nothing

425
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,023
for the rest of your life.

426
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:24,161
First of all, I'm writing a
novel, as you well know.

427
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:26,896
Secondly, your statement
is completely subjective

428
00:20:26,897 --> 00:20:29,199
and lacking any substantive facts.

429
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,368
You're walking down a very
dangerous road, my friend.

430
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:33,903
What road is that?

431
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:37,039
The road to fantasyland,

432
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,941
and when you take a trip to fantasyland,

433
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:41,377
you should always have a return ticket.

434
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:42,945
I don't even know what that means.

435
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:44,114
At some point you're going to have to come

436
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:47,150
to the same realization I did.

437
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:48,218
What's that?

438
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:51,488
The rest of the world is
never going to love you

439
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:53,160
as much as your parents do.

440
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,894
Weren't you adopted?

441
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:01,498
I don't understand why you're
interested in this guy.

442
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,934
He's just another
philandering affluent type

443
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:08,104
doomed to chronic alcoholism,
perpetual adolescence,

444
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:10,074
and death by syphilis.

445
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:13,309
He probably sits around all
day drinking Tom Collins

446
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,345
and just performing acts
of mental masturbation.

447
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,294
That is such an unfair generalization.

448
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:19,317
He's not like that.

449
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:21,852
For your information,
he is writing a novel.

450
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:24,387
Oh. Aren't we all?

451
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:28,057
So, I'm thinking about
taking it to the next level

452
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:29,093
with Beatrice,

453
00:21:29,094 --> 00:21:31,228
and actually asking her
out to dinner tonight.

454
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:33,630
Hm, bad move.

455
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:35,565
- Why?
- You just saw her last night.

456
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:38,034
You don't want to crowd her,
make her think you're too eager.

457
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:39,970
Definitely wait.

458
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:42,204
How long?

459
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:43,306
I don't know, Dylan.

460
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,441
A day at least.

461
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:45,706
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

462
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:48,647
Beatrice...

463
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:51,951
yes, that's my plane.

464
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:56,052
I never understood why someone
would want to be a vegetarian.

465
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:58,321
I mean, do you, do you really
love animals that much.

466
00:21:58,521 --> 00:22:00,191
No, no, no. I just hate plants.

467
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:03,460
You eat fish though, right?

468
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:04,460
Why?

469
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:06,095
All the vegetarians eat fish.

470
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:07,663
Well, I'm a Pisces.

471
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:09,365
What's that got to do with it?

472
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:11,170
I don't eat my own kind.

473
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,639
Beatrice, tell me, what
is it like being a model,

474
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,473
all those people staring at you?

475
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:20,643
It's like any other job,
innocuous and demoralizing,

476
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:21,324
but it pays well.

477
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:22,579
I'm serious. Tell me about yourself.

478
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,915
All I know is that you, you,
you do frequent the subway,

479
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,249
and, and you read Victorian

480
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,920
and pre-Victorian literature, right?

481
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:32,055
Come on, I want to know, I
want to know your fears.

482
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,422
I'd like to know your hopes.

483
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:35,392
I want to know political ideologies

484
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:36,327
and sexual preference.

485
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:37,760
I don't care what order.

486
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:40,195
That's a lot of information
for a first date.

487
00:22:40,196 --> 00:22:41,264
That's true.

488
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:42,531
How about you?

489
00:22:42,532 --> 00:22:45,235
What is it like being born with
the proverbial silver spoon?

490
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:46,202
All right.

491
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:49,271
Well, you know, it, it
is like any other job,

492
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:52,409
it's innocuous and demoralizing,
but it pays really well.

493
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,243
<i>Beatrice was different.</i>

494
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,345
<i>As their conversation continued,</i>

495
00:22:56,346 --> 00:23:00,383
<i>the two spoke of French cinema
and classic literature.</i>

496
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:03,252
<i>He tried to be witty, to make her laugh,</i>

497
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:06,155
<i>and for a moment she resembled a statue,</i>

498
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:07,556
<i>a bust of an Aphrodite</i>

499
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:10,993
<i>that he could only remember its gentle eyes</i>

500
00:23:10,994 --> 00:23:15,065
<i>but not where the status itself had been.</i>

501
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,466
Shall we go have a cigarette?

502
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:18,535
Okay, yeah.

503
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,170
<i>Conrad often became attached</i>

504
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:23,105
<i>to the idea of something</i>

505
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:26,710
<i>and not to the actual thing itself.</i>

506
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:30,012
So what is your novel about?

507
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:30,814
I'm not so sure.

508
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:32,015
I'm still figuring that part out.

509
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:33,682
I want you to try this.

510
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:34,323
Why? What is it?

511
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:38,488
This is, it's a Valmont Executive.

512
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:40,190
It is my family's brand.

513
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:41,658
It is, it is only the rarest

514
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:44,995
and most exquisite cigarette in existence.

515
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:46,632
It is pretty great, isn't it?

516
00:23:48,632 --> 00:23:51,104
Sort of tastes like any other cigarette.

517
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:54,537
How about the smell, right?

518
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:56,405
Smell?

519
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:58,141
Smells like any other too.

520
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:01,277
- I mean, maybe I'm missing...
- ...something.

521
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:03,113
You don't get it. You just don't get it.

522
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:05,047
I'm going to take two then.

523
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:06,649
Oh, that's good.

524
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,650
That's healthy.

525
00:24:09,252 --> 00:24:10,754
<i>As the day wore on,</i>

526
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:12,523
<i>Beatrice was playing hard to get.</i>

527
00:24:13,523 --> 00:24:18,260
<i>Conrad's pseudo-intellectual
banter was wearing thin,</i>

528
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:20,665
<i>and so he decided to proceed to plan B,</i>

529
00:24:22,665 --> 00:24:24,566
<i>get her drunk.</i>

530
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:25,768
Well, I know you don't drink,

531
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:28,138
but they make an incredible
Tom Collins, okay?

532
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:30,105
How often do you come here?

533
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:32,107
Uh, every once in a while.

534
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:34,115
<i>Here you go, Mr. Valmont.</i>

535
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:40,182
Lucky.

536
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:41,183
Cheers.

537
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:42,184
Cheers.

538
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:55,065
Weird how nobody dances anymore, you know?

539
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:58,471
That's funny coming from
someone who is not dancing.

540
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,105
I don't dance.

541
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:26,355
<i>You know, you're nothing
like Dylan described.</i>

542
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:27,325
Why? What did he say?

543
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:28,557
He said you were self-inhibited

544
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:29,593
and that you didn't drink.

545
00:26:29,594 --> 00:26:34,297
Well, a woman can wear many hats.

546
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:35,797
Oh yeah, what does that mean?

547
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:37,267
It means a woman can be

548
00:26:37,268 --> 00:26:39,402
inhibited and conservative with one man

549
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:43,806
and virtually the opposite with another.

550
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:47,442
Oh boy, even socialist regimes
wait until their demise

551
00:26:47,443 --> 00:26:50,646
before they admit such insincerity.

552
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:55,354
Well, I'm not a socialist
regime, I'm a woman.

553
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:58,587
<i>You play that thing?</i>

554
00:26:58,588 --> 00:26:59,922
<i>A little bit.</i>

555
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:00,923
Will you play me a song?

556
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:01,924
- No.
- Come on.

557
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:02,925
- Uh-uh.
- Please!

558
00:27:04,627 --> 00:27:06,530
- Beatrice.
- I'm not in the mood.

559
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,331
Are you going to make me beg?

560
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:10,600
No. Maybe.

561
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:11,934
Come on, please?

562
00:27:11,935 --> 00:27:14,704
Just one.

563
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:10,692
<i>Beatrice loved the way</i>

564
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:13,863
<i>Conrad walked into a room,</i>

565
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:15,832
<i>the way he waved his hands in the air</i>

566
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:19,469
<i>every time he heard Bach, the
way he read her excerpts</i>

567
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,604
<i>of Fitzgerald's short fiction before bed,</i>

568
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:25,575
<i>the precision with which
he made a Tom Collins</i>

569
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:29,278
<i>and a single Windsor knot,</i>

570
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,847
<i>his infallible wit and charm</i>

571
00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:35,585
<i>and the way he used words
like haberdashery,</i>

572
00:28:35,586 --> 00:28:37,819
<i>but most importantly,</i>

573
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,859
<i>Beatrice loved the way he looked at her.</i>

574
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:46,328
<i>Conrad loved the way
Beatrice walked into a room,</i>

575
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:47,489
<i>how she laughed at his jokes</i>

576
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,501
<i>no matter how convoluted
or juvenile they seemed,</i>

577
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:52,635
<i>the way she bit her lip</i>

578
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:55,305
<i>the moment before she played the piano,</i>

579
00:28:55,306 --> 00:28:59,308
<i>the softness of her skin,
the yellow in her eyes,</i>

580
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:04,079
<i>the mole on her thigh,
but most importantly,</i>

581
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,719
<i>Conrad loved to look at her.</i>

582
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:13,556
<i>Unfortunately, there were still
two unavoidable problems,</i>

583
00:29:13,557 --> 00:29:18,594
<i>Dylan, and that Conrad was broke,</i>

584
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:24,566
<i>but most importantly that he
was lying concerning both.</i>

585
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:25,934
Did you ever notice that
when people become happy,

586
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:28,570
they pack on a few extra pounds?

587
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:30,373
What are you trying to say?

588
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:32,107
No, no, no, nothing about you, Angel.

589
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:34,410
No, no, no.
I'm just, I'm making an observation.

590
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:35,644
Oh.

591
00:29:35,645 --> 00:29:38,547
Are you saying that all
fat people are happy?

592
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:40,048
Not at all, no.

593
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:41,049
I'm merely stating

594
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,919
that there are two
categories of fat people,

595
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:48,558
there is happy fat and there is just fat.

596
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:51,493
- No, no, no. Please.
- Just one.

597
00:29:51,494 --> 00:29:52,562
Just give me a little space.

598
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:54,730
I'm trying to cook, you
know, it's not natural.

599
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:56,431
Hey. That water is brown.

600
00:29:56,432 --> 00:29:58,101
That can't be healthy.

601
00:29:58,102 --> 00:29:59,208
That's how I like it.

602
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:00,442
- Really?
- Yep.

603
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:03,005
- Want me to get that?
- Nope.

604
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:05,040
Well, how am I supposed to wash my hands?

605
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,075
There's egg all over them.

606
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:07,076
Hey, Dylan.

607
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:11,681
Uh, no, not doing anything.

608
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:13,415
Oh, tonight?

609
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:18,921
Uh, oh, oh, can you hang on one second?

610
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:20,487
He wants to take me to the theater tonight

611
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:22,177
and he wants me to bring a date for you.

612
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:24,393
I'm, I'm not that good of a liar.

613
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:26,129
I sincerely doubt that.

614
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,066
No, I'm sorry, we can't... I can't.

615
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:32,567
<i>You did?</i>
Oh, that's so nice of you.

616
00:30:32,568 --> 00:30:35,438
Okay, well then, I'll see you at 7.

617
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:37,038
Okay, bye.

618
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,909
There was nothing I could do.

619
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,980
This is a bad idea.

620
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:47,850
<i>I don't understand why you and Dylan</i>

621
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:51,687
always have to get into these
prepubescent competitions

622
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:53,722
of which he always loses.

623
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:55,289
I resent that.
You know, I make a conscious effort

624
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:56,558
to stay out of all forms
of competition with him.

625
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,462
Well, you're uh, track
record proves otherwise.

626
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:04,467
Well, this girl is important.

627
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:08,004
Let me know if there's
anything I can, um, I can do.

628
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:10,739
Have you heard anything?
I can't get anyone to return my calls.

629
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,297
There are rumors, just rumors.

630
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,210
I don't want to get into details,

631
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:17,680
but I've only got 36 hours
of clean underwear left.

632
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,147
I've got no idea what to do, you know?

633
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:22,218
I feel like Napoleon after Waterloo,

634
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:25,020
dying in exile on the coast of St. Helena.

635
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:26,823
It's going to be all right, Connie.

636
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:27,790
You think?

637
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:30,559
I promise you. It's going to be all right.

638
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,095
All right.

639
00:31:45,443 --> 00:31:46,747
Listen, I need to take the antiques.

640
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,178
You don't need to take everything.

641
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,979
They were in my family,
and they belong to me.

642
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,747
Your family, your family, I paid...

643
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:53,915
That desk was from Marie Antoinette!

644
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:54,916
Oh, please!

645
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:56,919
Yes, it was.

646
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,622
<i>I'm sorry, sir. No one picked up.</i>

647
00:31:59,623 --> 00:32:01,781
<i>Is there another number you'd like to try?</i>

648
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:07,662
Um, no, no, that's okay.

649
00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:09,836
That's fine. Thank you.

650
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:15,037
I think that's a pretty
good parent over there.

651
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:16,037
Uh-hmm.

652
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:19,510
She's very uh, opinionated
and judgmental...

653
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:26,949
I told you this was a bad idea.

654
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,950
Shut up, shut up!

655
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,653
Well then, tell me about it.

656
00:33:03,654 --> 00:33:04,987
<i>Seriously?</i>

657
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:06,588
<i>Yes, seriously, of course!</i>

658
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:08,958
<i>Here I am, I'm leaving.</i>

659
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,893
<i>Is this a joke?</i>

660
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:12,894
<i>What a pitiful advocate you are!</i>

661
00:33:12,895 --> 00:33:16,031
<i>Speak, whether it's a joke or not.</i>

662
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,666
<i>Uh, uh, why are you looking</i>

663
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:20,036
<i>all around the room like that?</i>

664
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:23,605
<i>Oh, you, you really are in a temper.</i>

665
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:25,740
<i>I wish to take a lover,</i>

666
00:33:25,741 --> 00:33:27,242
<i>or if not a lover, at least a cavalier.</i>

667
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:28,278
<i>Whom do you suggest?</i>

668
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,579
<i>I shall abide by your choice from,</i>

669
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,847
<i>from tomorrow, from this evening,</i>

670
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:33,915
<i>whoever has the fancy to
sing beneath my window</i>

671
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:35,785
<i>will find my door ajar.</i>

672
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:36,752
<i>Well...</i>

673
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:38,954
<i>Well, nothing to say?</i>

674
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:40,656
Marry me!

675
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:58,641
I sure don't like the way you're
looking at Dylan tonight.

676
00:33:58,642 --> 00:33:59,941
I am not doing anything.

677
00:33:59,942 --> 00:34:02,845
Okay, maybe it's me, but I don't know.

678
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:03,846
Just stop it!

679
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:10,620
I didn't even understand any
of the Parisian speech.

680
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:12,889
I think they were Canadian.

681
00:34:14,943 --> 00:34:17,259
- Bonsoir, Monsieur Valmont.
- Hello, Didier.

682
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,660
Your usual table is waiting.

683
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:19,828
Great, thank you.

684
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:23,198
Will you be paying tonight
or putting it on the books?

685
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,634
It will be on the books,

686
00:34:24,635 --> 00:34:26,636
and that goes for the whole table.

687
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:28,203
- So...
- Ah, very well.

688
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:30,376
Please, right this way.

689
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:33,880
Bonsoir.

690
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:40,149
No, it's just a little bit,
I'll just have a little.

691
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,051
What did you think?

692
00:34:42,052 --> 00:34:44,053
I don't know.
I felt that it was sort of pretentious.

693
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:45,087
Uh-hm.

694
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:48,089
It seemed like everyone who was
in the theater was just there to be seen.

695
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,725
There to be seen?

696
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:51,926
It was a theater, it was
pitch black in there.

697
00:34:51,927 --> 00:34:55,196
How am I supposed to care

698
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:57,933
<i>about a group of over
privileged, affluent types</i>

699
00:34:57,934 --> 00:34:59,134
who go gallivanting around

700
00:34:59,135 --> 00:35:00,970
without any sort of a moral compass.

701
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:02,303
Yeah, affluent have plenty of problems.

702
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:03,705
I'm a mess.

703
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:05,774
I'm sorry, but I'm very sensitive

704
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:08,343
to an audience's reaction,
and I couldn't get into it.

705
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:09,444
If they all jumped off a bridge,

706
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:10,446
would you join them?

707
00:35:10,447 --> 00:35:13,181
I hate that analogy, I
really do, but maybe.

708
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:15,017
Maybe there's a reason for
why they're all doing that.

709
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:17,285
Maybe the bridge is about to explode
and no one told me.

710
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:18,553
That's a good point.

711
00:35:18,554 --> 00:35:22,325
<i>And just how am I supposed to sympathize
with these characters?</i>

712
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:24,926
<i>No one suffers any consequences
for their actions,</i>

713
00:35:24,927 --> 00:35:28,897
no one learns anything, and nobody changes.

714
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:31,901
It was a satire.

715
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:34,136
I didn't get that at all.

716
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:35,837
I love this place.

717
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:37,806
It's so chic.

718
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,808
Wait, I thought you said
that the door policy

719
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:43,011
was discriminatory and
this place was insipid.

720
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:44,779
Well, I did say that,

721
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:49,185
but that was before I came inside.

722
00:35:49,186 --> 00:35:50,419
I'm going to go.

723
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,492
Count to five and then follow me.

724
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:57,326
<i>Oh, are you wearing perfume?</i>

725
00:35:57,327 --> 00:35:58,493
<i>Excuse me?</i>

726
00:35:58,494 --> 00:36:00,428
<i>Don't you feel a little bit strange
about being an artist in a world</i>

727
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:02,931
<i>that's already so full of art?</i>

728
00:36:02,932 --> 00:36:04,433
<i>Isn't that sort of a waste?</i>

729
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:06,435
<i>I forget, what do you do?</i>

730
00:36:06,436 --> 00:36:08,203
<i>I'm getting a doctorate at Columbia</i>

731
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:10,004
<i>in postmodern criticism.</i>

732
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:12,107
<i>Ugh, for me I think that
people who are creative</i>

733
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:14,042
<i>are really just indulgent.</i>

734
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:15,745
There's only so much, and we don't,

735
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:16,846
we don't need any more,

736
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:18,113
and there are so many people
who are without, you know,

737
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:22,151
you should just be a farmer.

738
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:23,816
You can always tell what
someone thinks of you

739
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,088
by who they set you up with.

740
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,493
The only reason that I'm dancing with you

741
00:36:31,494 --> 00:36:34,462
is because I'm incredibly drunk.

742
00:36:34,463 --> 00:36:37,799
I despise you and everything
that you stand for.

743
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,234
Where are Conrad and Beatrice?

744
00:36:39,235 --> 00:36:40,770
I don't know.

745
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:42,350
You want to get another drink?

746
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:47,181
You're a bit of a philistine, aren't you?

747
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:52,848
I'm sorry, wait, tell me your name again.

748
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:53,982
Jocelyn.

749
00:36:53,983 --> 00:36:55,218
Are you kidding me?

750
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:57,540
I just got out of a three-year
relationship with a Jocelyn.

751
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,821
Do you want to sleep over?

752
00:36:58,822 --> 00:37:00,823
Hm. Your place or mine?

753
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:01,860
I live in a dorm.

754
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,496
Definitely mine.

755
00:37:13,302 --> 00:37:15,837
You know, I realized
something the other day.

756
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:18,808
Usually the women that I
like as human beings,

757
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:20,375
I'm not sexually attracted to,

758
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:22,912
and the ones that I'm
sexually attracted to,

759
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:26,181
I don't particularly like as human beings.

760
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:27,582
On the rare occasion

761
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,951
when one of them falls
into both categories,

762
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:33,221
they usually have a boyfriend or a husband.

763
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:35,357
What are you trying to say?

764
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,227
I'm trying to say,

765
00:37:38,228 --> 00:37:40,596
what I'm trying to say
is, you know, it's great

766
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:42,832
that you don't have a boyfriend.

767
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:46,835
Oh, but I am married. Is that a problem?

768
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:47,903
You're a cheater though.

769
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,335
- Oh, uh-huh, yeah.
- Right?

770
00:38:23,405 --> 00:38:24,958
I've got to tell Dylan.

771
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:45,127
I've got to tell him, right?

772
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:46,194
You tell him,

773
00:38:46,195 --> 00:38:50,064
you just come right out and
you just let him know,

774
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:51,533
you just tell him.

775
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:53,067
You've got to tell him.

776
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:55,121
You've got to tell him, got to tell him.

777
00:38:58,507 --> 00:38:59,718
You've got to tell him.

778
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:04,349
Oh God!

779
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:08,651
<i>This was it.</i>

780
00:39:08,652 --> 00:39:12,020
<i>This was the moment Conrad
would right his wrongs.</i>

781
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:13,355
Hey.

782
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:15,323
<i>This was the moment he would bare his soul</i>

783
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:16,591
<i>to his only friend.</i>

784
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:17,627
What's going on?

785
00:39:17,628 --> 00:39:20,361
<i>And tell him of his betrayal.</i>

786
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:23,670
<i>This was the moment Conrad
would ask for forgiveness.</i>

787
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:30,205
Nothing, nothing, nothing at all.

788
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:33,575
What? Does something
seem like it's going on?

789
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:35,477
Yeah, seemed like you were
about to say something.

790
00:39:35,478 --> 00:39:37,645
No, uh-uh, no, no, not at all.

791
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:38,980
Where's uh, friend?

792
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,518
Oh, you mean Jocelyn?

793
00:39:41,518 --> 00:39:42,618
<i>No, the friend.</i>

794
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:45,287
Yeah, the friend's name is Jocelyn.

795
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:47,323
Oh, really? Ironic.

796
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:49,158
I don't want to talk about it.

797
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,259
<i>Didn't have sex with her, huh?</i>

798
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,660
No, I didn't have sex with her.

799
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:53,095
I had to talk to her all night.

800
00:39:53,096 --> 00:39:55,564
<i>She only left half an hour ago.</i>

801
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:56,733
It was horrible.

802
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:00,669
So what happened last night?

803
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,604
<i>What happened was that it was amazing,</i>

804
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:05,274
<i>and we talked until the sun came up!</i>

805
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:06,275
That's amazing!

806
00:40:09,512 --> 00:40:11,647
<i>I have something I have to ask you.</i>

807
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:13,415
Yes.

808
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:15,584
Are you sleeping with Beatrice?

809
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:20,327
Uh...

810
00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:28,464
No, no, no.

811
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:32,433
Good. Good man.

812
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:35,104
Something I'd like to ask you.

813
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:37,105
May I sleep with Beatrice?

814
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:39,741
Definitely not!

815
00:40:39,742 --> 00:40:41,542
No!

816
00:40:41,543 --> 00:40:43,178
Got something I'd like to tell you.

817
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,747
- What is it now?
- Beatrice and I are already together.

818
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:46,749
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan!

819
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,051
- I'll kill you!
- Easy, easy!

820
00:40:49,052 --> 00:40:50,151
Now as we ease into adulthood,

821
00:40:50,152 --> 00:40:52,120
sometimes a good stiff drink
is the only excuse we have

822
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:55,223
- for committing the atrocities...
- Ease into adulthood?

823
00:40:55,224 --> 00:40:56,290
Yes. Now come on.

824
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:57,625
We're nearly 40!

825
00:40:57,626 --> 00:40:59,395
I said I was sorry. Okay?

826
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:02,464
- I was going to...
- You're a selfish asshole.

827
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:04,137
Now hang on.

828
00:41:07,137 --> 00:41:08,404
Selfish?

829
00:41:08,405 --> 00:41:10,138
Dylan, you're the one that's selfish.

830
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:12,774
I might actually have a
shot with her, okay?

831
00:41:12,775 --> 00:41:16,210
She could be the one.

832
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:18,379
The one!

833
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,580
What are you, 14?

834
00:41:19,581 --> 00:41:21,350
It's not charming anymore, Conrad.

835
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:23,285
I need you to sleep somewhere else tonight.

836
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:24,444
You're kicking me out?

837
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:32,460
And you realize by kicking me out,

838
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:34,304
I'll probably move in with Beatrice?

839
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:43,146
Sometimes you're your own worst enemy.

840
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:52,814
<i>Conrad's ability to trust</i>

841
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:56,685
<i>had been marred by years
of betrayal and deceit,</i>

842
00:41:56,686 --> 00:41:59,354
<i>for others had only dated or befriended him</i>

843
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:02,357
<i>to gain access to his wealth.</i>

844
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:04,426
<i>He had been quoted on numerous occasions</i>

845
00:42:04,427 --> 00:42:07,796
<i>as saying that no one could be trusted.</i>

846
00:42:07,797 --> 00:42:12,811
<i>What he forgot to add was
that included himself.</i>

847
00:42:22,756 --> 00:42:24,546
Well, I feel very, very conflicted.

848
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:27,381
I-I like the idea of living
up at the summer home,

849
00:42:27,382 --> 00:42:29,584
you know, upstate, the life
of a reclusive writer.

850
00:42:29,585 --> 00:42:30,653
I really do,

851
00:42:30,654 --> 00:42:33,421
but I'm allergic to the
grass and the clean air,

852
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:35,756
the bees, the ticks, the badgers,

853
00:42:35,757 --> 00:42:36,757
bunch of wildlife.

854
00:42:39,528 --> 00:42:41,497
What are you trying to say, Conrad?

855
00:42:41,498 --> 00:42:43,332
I'm going to move in with Beatrice.

856
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,167
Oh, oh, that's great news.

857
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:47,169
Thank you.

858
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,303
Does she know that you're broke

859
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:49,831
and have no place else to go?

860
00:42:55,144 --> 00:42:56,278
Yes.

861
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:58,379
Don't you feel guilty about Dylan?

862
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,547
Obviously, but you know,

863
00:42:59,548 --> 00:43:02,817
this is actually a very small city,
and if you meet an attractive girl,

864
00:43:02,818 --> 00:43:04,720
the chances are great
that one of your friends

865
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:07,221
has already slept with her or wants to.

866
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:08,489
Hm.

867
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,593
You're lying to yourself, Conrad.

868
00:43:11,594 --> 00:43:13,629
I know.

869
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,302
I'm okay with it.

870
00:43:20,302 --> 00:43:21,907
Ding-dong.

871
00:43:24,907 --> 00:43:26,575
Hi.

872
00:43:26,576 --> 00:43:28,643
Bonjour, mon amour.

873
00:43:28,644 --> 00:43:29,745
What's going on?

874
00:43:29,746 --> 00:43:32,247
I'm moving in.

875
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:34,283
What happen to Dylan's?

876
00:43:34,284 --> 00:43:37,886
I was allergic to his
sheets, Egyptian cotton.

877
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:39,523
I have Egyptian cotton.

878
00:43:40,523 --> 00:43:42,787
Well, we'll have to do
something about that.

879
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:53,834
I think I'm in love with you.

880
00:43:53,835 --> 00:43:55,907
How? It's only been two days.

881
00:43:57,907 --> 00:44:00,576
Then I'm in love with the idea of you.

882
00:44:00,577 --> 00:44:01,577
Not the actual me?

883
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:05,416
Well the idea of someone is always better.

884
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:09,585
You can't have sex with an idea.

885
00:44:53,596 --> 00:44:56,698
I'm telling you, don't put a scratch on it.

886
00:44:56,699 --> 00:44:57,732
I won't.

887
00:44:57,733 --> 00:44:59,701
Your father is going to kill me.

888
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:01,036
She's waiting.

889
00:45:46,581 --> 00:45:48,884
Oh, there it is.

890
00:45:48,885 --> 00:45:50,685
Yeah, what do you see there?

891
00:45:50,686 --> 00:45:53,788
Well, I mean it's obvious, kind of.

892
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:54,589
Right.

893
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:58,993
Explosive, it's explosive.

894
00:45:58,994 --> 00:46:01,465
A car, right?

895
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:05,369
<i>And do you see just the headlights?</i>

896
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:09,004
It's a female orgasm.

897
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:10,738
I think it's kind of clear. I don't...

898
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,115
That the driver is having?

899
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:22,084
What's wrong?

900
00:46:22,085 --> 00:46:23,085
Um,

901
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:26,021
nothing.

902
00:46:56,085 --> 00:46:58,453
<i>Sitting at Beatrice's piano,</i>

903
00:46:58,454 --> 00:47:01,022
<i>Conrad quietly read Dylan's note.</i>

904
00:47:01,023 --> 00:47:03,924
<i>In lieu of unnecessary explanations,</i>

905
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:06,530
<i>please enjoy this Volvo.</i>

906
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,698
<i>Conrad began to feel an odd sensation,</i>

907
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,868
<i>one of guilt.</i>

908
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:14,764
<i>He had never felt the emotion before.</i>

909
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:23,179
I think I have a brain tumor.

910
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:25,179
What?

911
00:47:28,751 --> 00:47:30,097
Nothing.

912
00:47:42,097 --> 00:47:44,665
I'm not, I'm not in the mood.

913
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,469
I'm sorry.

914
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,770
Sorry. Sorry.

915
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:54,875
You're never in the mood anymore.

916
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:56,578
We had sex last night.

917
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:57,946
<i>Yeah.</i>

918
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:01,019
You seemed a little distant.

919
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:06,187
Oh, we're just going through a dry spell.

920
00:48:06,188 --> 00:48:07,888
<i>Dry spell?</i>

921
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:08,992
<i>That's all.</i>

922
00:48:09,992 --> 00:48:11,459
Okay.

923
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,793
It's only been a week.

924
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:46,495
<i>Watching Beatrice</i>

925
00:48:46,496 --> 00:48:48,497
<i>as she delicately played the piano,</i>

926
00:48:48,498 --> 00:48:51,765
<i>Conrad felt horrible for
his ceaseless deception.</i>

927
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:56,904
<i>For a moment he contemplated
admitting his impoverishment.</i>

928
00:48:56,905 --> 00:48:59,148
<i>Then the moment passed.</i>

929
00:49:06,766 --> 00:49:08,082
How can I be with someone

930
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:11,118
that doesn't appreciate Bach or a Valmont.

931
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,989
This is a classic story, Conrad.

932
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,091
<i>Pygmalion</i>.

933
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:18,192
Have you even read <i>Pygmalion</i>.

934
00:49:18,193 --> 00:49:20,995
This has nothing to do with <i>Pygmalion</i>.

935
00:49:20,996 --> 00:49:23,899
<i>You should revisit that.</i>

936
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,637
Or get the notes or I'll read it to you.

937
00:49:27,637 --> 00:49:28,848
<i>I've seen My Fair Lady.</i>

938
00:49:30,773 --> 00:49:32,640
<i>Okay, Beatrice, stop right there.</i>

939
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:33,674
<i>Don't move, okay?</i>

940
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:35,843
<i>Don't move. Like that.</i>

941
00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:37,044
<i>Beautiful, you're beautiful.</i>

942
00:49:37,045 --> 00:49:38,047
<i>She's magnifique.</i>

943
00:49:40,983 --> 00:49:42,405
<i>Give me love, give me love.</i>

944
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:44,718
<i>You love me?</i>

945
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:45,720
<i>Smile.</i>

946
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:47,087
<i>Ah, voilà.</i>

947
00:49:47,088 --> 00:49:48,723
You love me, you love me.

948
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:49,924
Okay. Show me, show me.

949
00:49:49,925 --> 00:49:50,926
Show me you love me.

950
00:49:50,927 --> 00:49:52,928
Show me.
Okay.

951
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:53,928
<i>Love.</i>

952
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:56,064
<i>Hate, now, like that.</i>

953
00:49:56,065 --> 00:49:57,064
<i>Beautiful, beautiful.</i>

954
00:49:57,065 --> 00:49:58,966
Love...

955
00:49:58,967 --> 00:50:00,701
...hate.

956
00:50:00,702 --> 00:50:01,970
Love.

957
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:03,608
Voilà, one more?

958
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:07,311
Chapter one.

959
00:50:08,311 --> 00:50:12,113
Greece is a place he had visited
many times in his mind,

960
00:50:12,114 --> 00:50:13,114
but on this day...

961
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:21,927
Jumping forward, chapter three.

962
00:50:25,927 --> 00:50:26,927
Chapter four.

963
00:50:36,706 --> 00:50:40,177
So how long are they going to
be remodeling the Valmont?

964
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:43,979
Uh, a couple months maybe, I think.

965
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,879
What?

966
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,147
Sometimes they take a couple months.
Yeah.

967
00:50:46,148 --> 00:50:47,649
Months? You said weeks.

968
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,783
Well...

969
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:51,118
Oh.

970
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,654
- Hey.
- Hey.

971
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:55,022
I got your gift.

972
00:50:55,023 --> 00:50:56,023
Hm.

973
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:06,033
Well, as good as it is
to bump into you guys,

974
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:08,192
I have to go. I've got my opening tonight.

975
00:51:09,345 --> 00:51:11,806
- What part of town is that in?
- Whitman Gallery.

976
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:13,808
<i>Maybe we'll see you there.</i>

977
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:16,048
Don't know the time.

978
00:51:20,048 --> 00:51:21,048
Who's that girl?

979
00:51:22,985 --> 00:51:25,687
- Jocelyn.
- That's not Jocelyn.

980
00:51:25,688 --> 00:51:27,822
I know, the uh, the other Jocelyn.

981
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:31,693
Let's get in this car, come on.

982
00:52:27,248 --> 00:52:29,338
I've got to go.

983
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:53,000
<i>Conrad had often professed</i>

984
00:53:53,001 --> 00:53:56,337
<i>that he led a life of the mind.</i>

985
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:58,205
<i>Unfortunately for him,</i>

986
00:53:58,206 --> 00:54:01,576
<i>his mind had been damaged
by years of abandonment,</i>

987
00:54:01,577 --> 00:54:04,412
<i>philandering, Tom Collins,</i>

988
00:54:04,413 --> 00:54:07,415
<i>and a two-pack-per-day nicotine habit,</i>

989
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:10,951
<i>not to mention an unhealthy
Oedipal complex.</i>

990
00:54:10,952 --> 00:54:14,221
<i>The weight of his guilt had
finally become too heavy.</i>

991
00:54:14,222 --> 00:54:17,469
<i>The incessant charade
could go on no longer.</i>

992
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:29,662
What's wrong?

993
00:54:29,862 --> 00:54:31,605
Where were you?

994
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:33,274
You left me in the concert.

995
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:35,243
You stayed, huh?

996
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:36,845
Actually, I did.

997
00:54:36,846 --> 00:54:37,916
It was beautiful.

998
00:54:44,586 --> 00:54:45,850
We're out of cigarettes.

999
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:50,994
Where are we going?

1000
00:54:52,994 --> 00:54:54,395
To The Valmont.

1001
00:54:54,396 --> 00:54:56,430
Why are we hiding behind the bushes?

1002
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:57,931
I need you to follow me
on the count of three...

1003
00:54:57,932 --> 00:54:59,070
- What?
- Ready? Go!

1004
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,071
Timothy.

1005
00:55:03,072 --> 00:55:05,835
Frederick.
I don't believe you're supposed to...

1006
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:08,942
Hello.

1007
00:55:08,943 --> 00:55:09,944
Mr. Valmont...

1008
00:55:09,945 --> 00:55:11,479
Mr. Valmont.

1009
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,583
Stop them!

1010
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,084
What is going on?

1011
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:17,152
This is crazy.

1012
00:55:17,352 --> 00:55:18,953
I know. Isn't it fun?

1013
00:55:18,954 --> 00:55:21,055
Where are we going?

1014
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:22,189
Why are we...

1015
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,394
Sh-h-h-h!

1016
00:55:26,394 --> 00:55:27,394
<i>Come on!</i>

1017
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:33,935
<i>Please turn on the lights.</i>

1018
00:55:33,936 --> 00:55:35,169
<i>What is happening?</i>

1019
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,370
<i>It's a game.</i>

1020
00:55:36,371 --> 00:55:38,171
<i>Hey, if you see my mother's
jewels, get those.</i>

1021
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,241
<i>What? No, we should not do that.</i>

1022
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:41,242
<i>Sh-h-h-h!</i>

1023
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,580
Uh.

1024
00:55:45,581 --> 00:55:48,250
I showed her, that washed-up debutante.

1025
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,189
Shit!

1026
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,326
Really, really good work, Timothy.

1027
00:55:58,327 --> 00:55:59,694
It's Frederick, sir.

1028
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:01,261
Yes, Frederick. Sorry.

1029
00:56:01,262 --> 00:56:02,330
Yeah, I know.

1030
00:56:02,331 --> 00:56:03,663
I thank you a lot in really
picking up the pace.

1031
00:56:03,863 --> 00:56:05,366
Now you know where to return
Mother's jewels, right.

1032
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:07,567
That's the penthouse, the East wing,

1033
00:56:07,568 --> 00:56:10,104
the Rhodesian cabinet, third drawer.

1034
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:13,573
I've got my cigarettes.

1035
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:15,627
Please tell Bernard that I'm very sorry.

1036
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,601
I'll be right there, Honey.

1037
00:56:23,585 --> 00:56:25,352
What was all that about?

1038
00:56:25,353 --> 00:56:27,455
I'm not sure I even know anymore.

1039
00:56:27,456 --> 00:56:29,489
Conrad, what is going on?

1040
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,392
You know, Beatrice,

1041
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:33,026
I only moved in with you

1042
00:56:33,027 --> 00:56:34,261
because I've got no place else to go.

1043
00:56:34,262 --> 00:56:35,263
Okay? I'm broke.

1044
00:56:35,264 --> 00:56:36,698
What do you mean?

1045
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:38,031
I have nothing.

1046
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:39,433
I was kicked out of The Valmont.

1047
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:41,268
My parents cut me off.

1048
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:43,104
Conrad, you're nearly 40 years old.

1049
00:56:43,105 --> 00:56:44,671
Well, that's completely irrelevant.

1050
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:47,008
I've got separation anxiety,
abandonment issues.

1051
00:56:47,009 --> 00:56:49,977
Are you saying you've been
lying to me this entire time?

1052
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:53,982
Yes, but I'm not the only liar.

1053
00:56:53,983 --> 00:56:56,216
I saw you with Dylan earlier today.

1054
00:56:56,217 --> 00:56:57,317
What?

1055
00:56:57,318 --> 00:57:00,221
You've been following me now?

1056
00:57:00,222 --> 00:57:03,658
I-I was trying to patch
things up between you.

1057
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,125
God, grow up!

1058
00:57:05,126 --> 00:57:08,129
No, you are not honest with yourself.
That's your problem.

1059
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,997
Okay? You're always acting so virtuous,

1060
00:57:09,998 --> 00:57:11,031
you're always talking
about how you want to be

1061
00:57:11,032 --> 00:57:12,533
a bohemian musician.

1062
00:57:12,534 --> 00:57:16,270
In the end, you're just a model.

1063
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:18,705
But at least I have a job.

1064
00:57:18,706 --> 00:57:21,576
You have just managed to coast through life
without worrying about money

1065
00:57:21,577 --> 00:57:23,678
or anything else pertaining to reality.

1066
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:26,147
You are just a philandering narcissist

1067
00:57:26,148 --> 00:57:28,348
who is so afraid of being alone
because when you are alone,

1068
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:30,551
you are going to realize
how empty your life is,

1069
00:57:30,552 --> 00:57:32,185
and you know what, I should
have gone with Dylan

1070
00:57:32,186 --> 00:57:34,154
because between the two of
you, he was the nice one.

1071
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:36,624
You are insufferable!

1072
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,327
Didn't seem to bother you
when I was flipping the bill.

1073
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:41,129
All right. You're just
like the rest of them.

1074
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,163
You are only with me for the money.

1075
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:45,366
I am the only girl you have ever been with

1076
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:46,667
who wasn't just in it for the money,

1077
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:48,142
and besides, you were broke.

1078
00:57:51,606 --> 00:57:54,280
Well, you didn't know that.

1079
00:59:36,612 --> 00:59:39,379
<i>Staring into the grill of a bread truck,</i>

1080
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,848
<i>Conrad couldn't help but
think of the poor woman</i>

1081
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:47,388
<i>who had been diagnosed with
witzelsucht, the joking disease.</i>

1082
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:51,591
<i>In a daze, he suddenly began
to speak fluent German,</i>

1083
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:54,286
<i>though he had never studied the language.</i>

1084
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:04,572
<i>He promptly lost consciousness.</i>

1085
01:00:16,451 --> 01:00:17,817
Where does it hurt?

1086
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:22,890
Uh, uberall.

1087
01:00:22,891 --> 01:00:26,928
<i>Conrad's worst fear had come true.</i>

1088
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:29,331
<i>He was all alone.</i>

1089
01:00:34,436 --> 01:00:35,835
Hello?

1090
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:36,836
<i>Who's this?</i>

1091
01:00:37,505 --> 01:00:39,439
It's your son, Conrad. Hi.

1092
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,274
<i>- Connie.</i>
- What's the... Where are you?

1093
01:00:41,275 --> 01:00:42,375
What's that noise?

1094
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:43,955
<i>Can't you see I'm preoccupied.</i>

1095
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,317
When are you coming home?

1096
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:50,318
<i>I don't know, Darling.</i>

1097
01:00:50,518 --> 01:00:53,322
<i>Divorce of this stature can take some time.</i>

1098
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:00,361
How long do you think?

1099
01:01:00,362 --> 01:01:01,681
<i>Look, I have to go.</i>

1100
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:22,260
Maybe this will all blow over.

1101
01:01:23,938 --> 01:01:26,254
<i>I just saw the most
amazing performance piece</i>

1102
01:01:26,255 --> 01:01:28,288
<i>where a husband and wife
tied themselves together</i>

1103
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:30,825
<i>with a 10-foot rope for an entire year.</i>

1104
01:01:30,826 --> 01:01:33,861
<i>It was a commentary on
the modern relationship.</i>

1105
01:01:33,862 --> 01:01:35,462
<i>That is the most beautiful metaphor</i>

1106
01:01:35,463 --> 01:01:39,966
<i>I've ever heard. What happened to them?</i>

1107
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,535
They got a divorce.

1108
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:42,775
Hm.

1109
01:01:47,398 --> 01:01:49,609
I heard you went out with Beatrice earlier.

1110
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:52,610
She was trying to get me to do
what we're doing right now.

1111
01:01:56,385 --> 01:01:58,653
Dylan, I guess you were right.

1112
01:01:58,654 --> 01:01:59,854
About what?

1113
01:01:59,855 --> 01:02:02,829
Sometimes I am my own worst enemy.

1114
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:10,251
What happened to your face?

1115
01:02:13,802 --> 01:02:15,602
I got hit by a truck.

1116
01:02:15,603 --> 01:02:16,603
Uh-hm.

1117
01:02:17,505 --> 01:02:18,641
Zeus is dead.

1118
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:22,410
You could fetter my leg,

1119
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:26,483
but Zeus himself cannot get
the better of my free will.

1120
01:02:28,483 --> 01:02:31,487
And I want my Volvo back,
that was just a joke.

1121
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:34,455
So how are things with Jocelyn?

1122
01:02:34,456 --> 01:02:36,924
Oh, we broke up again.

1123
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:39,444
This time it's for good.
I think she was stealing from me.

1124
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:43,017
That's rough.

1125
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,866
How are things with Beatrice?

1126
01:02:45,867 --> 01:02:46,933
Not so good.

1127
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:48,368
No?

1128
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:49,636
Well, it's not a surprise

1129
01:02:49,637 --> 01:02:52,342
considering what an asshole you are.

1130
01:02:53,342 --> 01:02:54,642
I resent that.

1131
01:02:54,643 --> 01:02:56,813
Well, you should. It was an insult.

1132
01:02:57,813 --> 01:03:00,013
You're not still mad at me, are you?

1133
01:03:00,014 --> 01:03:01,119
Not at all...

1134
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,119
Maybe a little.

1135
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:11,427
I really thought Beatrice
and I were going to last.

1136
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:14,427
What is it?

1137
01:03:16,731 --> 01:03:18,031
- Hi.
- Hello.

1138
01:03:18,032 --> 01:03:23,671
Now, you two seem like fans of literature.

1139
01:03:23,672 --> 01:03:28,475
I have got a very impressive
library at my apartment.

1140
01:03:28,476 --> 01:03:30,745
- Really?
- Uh-hm.

1141
01:03:30,746 --> 01:03:32,849
Do you want to see my Balzac collection?

1142
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:36,450
You sure you don't want to do anything?

1143
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:37,951
I can't, sorry.

1144
01:03:37,952 --> 01:03:41,958
It would be a misrepresentation
of how I feel inside.

1145
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:45,695
I don't even know what that means.

1146
01:03:47,628 --> 01:03:49,965
Well, that's exactly the problem.

1147
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:05,771
You can, uh, keep the Volvo.

1148
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:44,685
Beatrice, it's Conrad.

1149
01:04:44,686 --> 01:04:46,020
Give me a call.

1150
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:47,021
Call me back.

1151
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:58,064
<i>What do you see, Conrad?</i>

1152
01:04:58,065 --> 01:04:59,065
<i>Sex.</i>

1153
01:05:01,203 --> 01:05:02,271
<i>And now?</i>

1154
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:05,038
<i>Beatrice. I mean, sex.</i>

1155
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,646
<i>I mean, wait, Beatrice.</i>

1156
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:13,148
<i>Now?</i>

1157
01:05:14,148 --> 01:05:15,219
Sex.

1158
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:19,822
This isn't healthy, Conrad.

1159
01:05:21,822 --> 01:05:22,822
I know that.

1160
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:26,826
<i>Meanwhile, Beatrice visited</i>

1161
01:05:26,827 --> 01:05:28,729
<i>her Upper West Side mystic</i>

1162
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:31,869
<i>in an attempt to find similar
answers to her quandary.</i>

1163
01:05:33,869 --> 01:05:34,938
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

1164
01:05:36,938 --> 01:05:39,175
<i>her prospects were less than ideal.</i>

1165
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,877
<i>I mean, I-I've only just moved in.</i>

1166
01:05:42,878 --> 01:05:44,352
<i>She's already kicked me out.</i>

1167
01:05:45,246 --> 01:05:46,849
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

1168
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:50,116
<i>Sometimes we have to make sacrifices</i>

1169
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:52,018
<i>for the ones we love.</i>

1170
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:53,553
<i>This literary moral code of yours</i>

1171
01:05:53,554 --> 01:05:54,888
<i>is completely unrealistic.</i>

1172
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:56,790
<i>This isn't a Jane Austin novel,</i>

1173
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:58,896
<i>and I'm certainly not Emily Post.</i>

1174
01:06:00,896 --> 01:06:04,931
<i>You have the moral code
of a Bolshevik, Conrad.</i>

1175
01:06:04,932 --> 01:06:07,767
<i>I mean, I'm, I'm having an
existential crisis here.</i>

1176
01:06:07,768 --> 01:06:09,261
<i>I can't stop thinking about her.</i>

1177
01:06:09,461 --> 01:06:10,907
<i>I think I need to see a doctor.</i>

1178
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:16,650
<i>Conrad, I am a doctor.</i>

1179
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,184
Beatrice?

1180
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:25,260
Beatrice?

1181
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,993
Note to self,

1182
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:36,830
upon a second reading,
my analyst was correct.

1183
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:40,192
It has everything to do with <i>Pygmalion.</i>

1184
01:07:06,061 --> 01:07:07,595
<i>Dylan?</i>

1185
01:07:07,596 --> 01:07:09,263
<i>Wake up!</i>

1186
01:07:09,264 --> 01:07:10,797
What? What is it?

1187
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:13,034
I need Jocelyn's phone number.

1188
01:07:17,005 --> 01:07:18,005
<i>Magnifique.</i>

1189
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:25,044
<i>Love, hate.</i>

1190
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:27,247
<i>Stop! Don't move. Voilà.</i>

1191
01:07:27,248 --> 01:07:29,217
<i>Superb, superb.</i>

1192
01:07:35,824 --> 01:07:37,156
Huh.

1193
01:07:37,157 --> 01:07:39,940
Okay, let's uh, let's take a break. Hm.

1194
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,642
Hi.

1195
01:07:54,643 --> 01:07:56,776
What happened to your head?

1196
01:07:56,777 --> 01:07:58,846
I got hit by a truck.

1197
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,083
Yeah.

1198
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:04,118
I like this music selection.

1199
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:05,685
Whose is it?

1200
01:08:05,686 --> 01:08:07,224
What are you doing here?

1201
01:08:09,224 --> 01:08:12,091
I'm quitting.

1202
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:13,092
The whole act.

1203
01:08:15,697 --> 01:08:18,732
Well, it wasn't the act that bothered me.

1204
01:08:18,733 --> 01:08:20,368
It was the cover-up.

1205
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:23,336
Well, the act was the cover-up.

1206
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:24,904
I have to go back to work.

1207
01:08:24,905 --> 01:08:26,005
Can I have one hour?

1208
01:08:26,006 --> 01:08:28,242
I just need one hour.

1209
01:08:28,243 --> 01:08:29,876
Okay. One hour.

1210
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:32,287
Yeah, thanks. I'll be right here.

1211
01:08:46,994 --> 01:08:48,461
I hate surprises.

1212
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:50,041
You're going to like this one.

1213
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:56,069
I don't understand.

1214
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:58,130
<i>It's for both of us. Don't get too excited.</i>

1215
01:08:58,330 --> 01:08:59,440
<i>It's just a rental.</i>

1216
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,076
You didn't.

1217
01:09:02,077 --> 01:09:03,253
<i>I did.</i>

1218
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:14,253
How?

1219
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:24,883
There's no leaks in the ceiling.

1220
01:09:27,135 --> 01:09:29,206
<i>Got his and her bathrooms.</i>

1221
01:09:31,206 --> 01:09:33,012
<i>This water is not brown.</i>

1222
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:40,012
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1223
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:45,221
Nothing.

1224
01:09:47,221 --> 01:09:49,288
So, did you actually go

1225
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,959
<i>to the Picasso retrospective last week?</i>

1226
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,126
<i>It was horrid.</i>

1227
01:09:53,127 --> 01:09:54,161
<i>I know.</i>

1228
01:09:54,162 --> 01:09:57,096
<i>I'm, I'm sorry, but I like his work,</i>

1229
01:09:57,097 --> 01:09:59,465
pretentious and adolescent.

1230
01:09:59,466 --> 01:10:04,371
<i>You know, if he would just take a step back
and have someone...</i>

1231
01:10:04,372 --> 01:10:05,698
Have you ever noticed that the people

1232
01:10:05,898 --> 01:10:07,474
who make fun of people for being pretentious

1233
01:10:07,475 --> 01:10:10,145
are usually the pretentious ones?

1234
01:10:15,115 --> 01:10:19,118
Have you ever noticed how
people only lash out on others

1235
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:22,355
because they're afraid of what they see

1236
01:10:22,356 --> 01:10:23,962
if they see themselves?

1237
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:29,295
What if I tell you I love you?

1238
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:31,244
Does that mean I actually love myself?

1239
01:10:34,034 --> 01:10:35,034
Exactly.

1240
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:37,871
I love you.

1241
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:43,454
I love you, too.

1242
01:10:54,454 --> 01:10:56,156
<i>It was at that moment,</i>

1243
01:10:56,157 --> 01:10:59,827
<i>Conrad and Beatrice knew that it was over.</i>

1244
01:10:59,828 --> 01:11:03,162
<i>Beatrice couldn't help but
feel sympathy for Conrad,</i>

1245
01:11:03,163 --> 01:11:06,335
<i>not love, but sympathy.</i>

1246
01:11:07,335 --> 01:11:09,573
<i>One can often get confused for the other.</i>

1247
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:15,408
<i>As the two exited the station,</i>

1248
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:18,448
<i>they waved good-bye to
one another as usual.</i>

1249
01:11:20,448 --> 01:11:24,363
<i>It would be the last time they
would ever see each other.</i>

1250
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:40,533
<i>It seemed there was an
unavoidable distinction</i>

1251
01:11:40,534 --> 01:11:42,435
<i>between Conrad and Beatrice</i>

1252
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:45,104
<i>that had rendered them incompatible.</i>

1253
01:11:45,105 --> 01:11:47,374
<i>She was a hopeless romantic,</i>

1254
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:49,545
<i>and he was romantically hopeless.</i>

1255
01:11:50,545 --> 01:11:51,978
<i>By the week's end,</i>

1256
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:53,613
<i>Conrad had received a telegram</i>

1257
01:11:53,614 --> 01:11:57,117
<i>informing him of his
parents' reconciliation.</i>

1258
01:11:57,118 --> 01:11:59,987
<i>Their week-long divorce had grown tiresome,</i>

1259
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:03,425
<i>and they were to return
home in two days' time.</i>

1260
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:07,059
<i>As much as Beatrice had tried,</i>

1261
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:10,100
<i>she was unable to forget Conrad's actions.</i>

1262
01:12:23,077 --> 01:12:23,943
Note to self,

1263
01:12:23,944 --> 01:12:27,046
see doctor about possible brain tumor.

1264
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:29,148
<i>Conrad went on to keep the empty apartment</i>

1265
01:12:29,149 --> 01:12:32,655
<i>as a sort of metaphor for
the void left by Beatrice.</i>

1266
01:12:34,655 --> 01:12:36,961
<i>He told no one of its existence.</i>

1267
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:43,196
<i>It wasn't until years later
that Conrad would realize</i>

1268
01:12:43,197 --> 01:12:45,398
<i>love was just like communism,</i>

1269
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:49,403
<i>it was a great idea but
never quite worked out.</i>

1270
01:12:49,404 --> 01:12:51,237
<i>Conrad may have told others</i>

1271
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:53,072
<i>that he was in search of a girlfriend,</i>

1272
01:12:53,073 --> 01:12:56,576
<i>a future wife, but it was merely rhetoric.</i>

1273
01:12:56,577 --> 01:12:59,179
<i>Conrad's search was for an idyllic beauty</i>

1274
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:01,281
<i>he would never attain.</i>

1275
01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:05,585
<i>Conrad often became attached
to the idea of something</i>

1276
01:13:05,586 --> 01:13:08,356
<i>and not the actual thing itself.</i>

1277
01:13:09,356 --> 01:13:10,491
<i>Back in The Valmont</i>

1278
01:13:10,492 --> 01:13:13,093
<i>with his credit cards once again active,</i>

1279
01:13:13,094 --> 01:13:15,779
<i>Conrad resumed the life he
was accustomed to living,</i>

1280
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,331
<i>but something was different.</i>

1281
01:13:18,332 --> 01:13:20,438
Like this one, right there. Get that one.

1282
01:13:22,002 --> 01:13:23,172
I missed it.

1283
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:28,064
Tell me why the hell are
we fishing with spears?

1284
01:13:50,064 --> 01:13:51,104
What's wrong?

1285
01:13:56,104 --> 01:13:57,262
It's been a long week.

1286
01:13:58,228 --> 01:14:00,439
<i>With the matriarch of The Valmont household</i>

1287
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,541
<i>once again home,</i>

1288
01:14:02,542 --> 01:14:07,647
<i>Conrad was able to let out a
decade of emotions and fears,</i>

1289
01:14:07,648 --> 01:14:09,683
<i>for she had long been the only person</i>

1290
01:14:09,684 --> 01:14:12,090
<i>he would truly confide in.</i>

1291
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:18,143
I think there's something wrong with me.

1292
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,760
<i>In an attempt to change his ways...</i>

1293
01:14:20,761 --> 01:14:22,095
Ding dong!

1294
01:14:22,096 --> 01:14:24,108
<i>...Conrad started down
the road to redemption</i>

1295
01:14:24,308 --> 01:14:26,502
<i>with the simple gesture
of quitting cigarettes,</i>

1296
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:31,203
<i>of getting his father's
Austin-Healey out of hock,</i>

1297
01:14:31,204 --> 01:14:34,608
<i>and on one spring afternoon
while Dylan was out,</i>

1298
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:36,710
<i>Conrad snuck into his friend's apartment</i>

1299
01:14:36,711 --> 01:14:38,678
<i>to finally repay him.</i>

1300
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:41,081
<i>He not only monetarily compensated Dylan</i>

1301
01:14:41,082 --> 01:14:42,549
<i>for his loan,</i>

1302
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,419
<i>but also included the keys to his Volvo</i>

1303
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:49,490
<i>and an inflation-adjusted interest of 20%.</i>

1304
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:52,291
These are classic symptoms.

1305
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:54,135
I think you're a closet agoraphobic.

1306
01:14:55,796 --> 01:14:57,565
I'm terminating our sessions.

1307
01:14:58,504 --> 01:15:00,399
Conrad, can we talk about this later?

1308
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,169
I'm in the middle of a session.

1309
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,536
<i>I don't care.</i>

1310
01:15:03,537 --> 01:15:05,104
<i>I'm getting worse.</i>

1311
01:15:05,105 --> 01:15:07,382
Beatrice broke up with me
and I got hit by a truck.

1312
01:15:07,582 --> 01:15:08,675
Look at me, I'm a mess.

1313
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:10,343
Why do you think that is?

1314
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:11,812
Your bad advice.

1315
01:15:11,813 --> 01:15:13,846
Conrad, I've been your therapist

1316
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:15,816
since you were nine years old.

1317
01:15:15,817 --> 01:15:17,684
Indeed, I think it's all that bad advice

1318
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:20,120
that made me the bad person I am today.

1319
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:22,322
<i>It's going to take a very long
time to recover from this.</i>

1320
01:15:22,323 --> 01:15:23,323
Farewell.

1321
01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:31,516
Perhaps he had the wrong office.

1322
01:15:34,202 --> 01:15:35,602
Hypothetically speaking,

1323
01:15:35,603 --> 01:15:38,138
do you think someone could
have a Napoleonic complex

1324
01:15:38,139 --> 01:15:41,707
without being particularly short?

1325
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,777
I don't believe so.

1326
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:46,679
What would you call this
hypothetical person then?

1327
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,680
An egoist?

1328
01:15:48,515 --> 01:15:50,850
Egoist.

1329
01:15:50,851 --> 01:15:53,421
I think I'm an egoist.

1330
01:15:54,421 --> 01:15:56,421
I've never told you this before, but...

1331
01:15:58,792 --> 01:16:01,134
you're a horrible writer.

1332
01:16:06,134 --> 01:16:07,136
I know.

1333
01:16:11,171 --> 01:16:12,272
<i>After several years</i>

1334
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:15,308
<i>of deliberation and public speculation,</i>

1335
01:16:15,309 --> 01:16:17,836
<i>Conrad had finally finished
his sophomore effort.</i>

1336
01:16:19,814 --> 01:16:21,747
<i>His inability to complete the novel</i>

1337
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:24,718
<i>had simply stemmed from
his lack of understanding</i>

1338
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,554
<i>its central character, of course.</i>

1339
01:16:27,555 --> 01:16:30,559
<i>The central character was himself.</i>

1340
01:16:31,516 --> 01:16:33,359
<i>The book was published in the spring</i>

1341
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,430
<i>and received mixed reviews.</i>

1342
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,532
He proceeded to wave good-bye
to Abigail as if routine,

1343
01:16:39,533 --> 01:16:43,370
for he was convinced that
this was not the last time

1344
01:16:43,371 --> 01:16:45,304
that they would ever see each other.

1345
01:16:45,305 --> 01:16:47,206
<i>Harold went on to keep the empty apartment</i>

1346
01:16:47,207 --> 01:16:51,377
as sort of a metaphor for
the void left by Abigail.

1347
01:16:51,378 --> 01:16:55,317
He told no one of its existence.

1348
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:00,894
Thank you.

1349
01:17:06,638 --> 01:17:08,428
<i>How do you respond to the criticism</i>

1350
01:17:08,429 --> 01:17:10,663
<i>that your novel is inherently derivative</i>

1351
01:17:10,664 --> 01:17:13,737
of the works of Fitzgerald
and Edith Wharton?

1352
01:17:16,737 --> 01:17:18,006
Thank you.

1353
01:17:19,006 --> 01:17:21,273
<i>Mr. Valmont, I'm sorry,
but I found the book</i>

1354
01:17:21,274 --> 01:17:23,276
<i>and the central character adolescent</i>

1355
01:17:23,277 --> 01:17:25,711
<i>and his problems grossly inconsequential</i>

1356
01:17:25,712 --> 01:17:27,581
<i>by modern social standards.</i>

1357
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:28,814
Don't you find his change at the end

1358
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:32,452
slightly contrived and frankly, sophomoric.

1359
01:17:32,453 --> 01:17:34,587
I completely disagree.
I find him quite likable

1360
01:17:34,588 --> 01:17:36,895
and his change rather significant.

1361
01:17:40,839 --> 01:17:42,261
<i>At a matinee performance of</i>

1362
01:17:42,262 --> 01:17:43,578
Les Caprices de Marianne,

1363
01:17:44,408 --> 01:17:46,566
<i>the play which the once tightly knit group</i>

1364
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:49,368
<i>had all seen together,
Dylan ran into Beatrice</i>

1365
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:52,706
<i>for the first time since
her split with Conrad.</i>

1366
01:17:52,707 --> 01:17:55,875
<i>This was not a coincidence,
however, for each had</i>

1367
01:17:55,876 --> 01:17:59,446
<i>mysteriously received a
ticket two days prior.</i>

1368
01:17:59,447 --> 01:18:02,314
<i>Conrad had sent the tickets
in an attempt to pay penance</i>

1369
01:18:02,315 --> 01:18:04,783
<i>for his actions the previous week.</i>

1370
01:18:04,784 --> 01:18:07,586
<i>The two then went to a small
bar in the West Village</i>

1371
01:18:07,587 --> 01:18:09,788
<i>to speak about the play.</i>

1372
01:18:09,789 --> 01:18:12,459
<i>They both enjoyed it and had
seen it with a nostalgia</i>

1373
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,827
<i>for their old times together.</i>

1374
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:16,996
<i>They made love that night</i>

1375
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:20,433
<i>and have been together ever since.</i>

1376
01:18:20,434 --> 01:18:21,934
<i>Dylan finally read</i>

1377
01:18:21,935 --> 01:18:25,705
<i>Jane Austin's pre-Victorian
classic</i> Sense and Sensibility<i>.</i>

1378
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:28,841
<i>He found it neither
sentimental nor unrealistic,</i>

1379
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:30,613
<i>but actually quite relatable.</i>

1380
01:18:32,613 --> 01:18:35,715
<i>Soon after their encounter
outside the Hudson Playhouse,</i>

1381
01:18:35,716 --> 01:18:37,817
<i>Beatrice gave up her modeling exploits</i>

1382
01:18:37,818 --> 01:18:41,054
<i>and formed a jazz ensemble with Dylan.</i>

1383
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:44,390
<i>They achieved moderate
success and were happy.</i>

1384
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:47,596
<i>Consequently, they both put on 15 pounds.</i>

1385
01:18:49,596 --> 01:18:52,564
<i>Conrad and Dylan continued
their weekly conversations</i>

1386
01:18:52,565 --> 01:18:54,634
<i>over squash,</i>

1387
01:18:54,635 --> 01:18:57,372
<i>and for the first time, Dylan won.</i>

1388
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:01,707
<i>Conrad saw this as a sign of change.</i>

1389
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:05,548
<i>Dylan, however, merely felt
a sense of satisfaction.</i>

1390
01:19:08,548 --> 01:19:12,085
<i>Conrad would go on to donate a
large portion of his wealth</i>

1391
01:19:12,086 --> 01:19:15,822
<i>to various charities and
philanthropic endeavors.</i>

1392
01:19:15,823 --> 01:19:18,758
<i>Unfortunately, it took losing everything</i>

1393
01:19:18,759 --> 01:19:20,593
<i>for Conrad to finally appreciate</i>

1394
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:23,897
<i>the economic stability he once had.</i>

1395
01:19:23,898 --> 01:19:27,104
<i>He wasn't going to take
it for granted this time.</i>

1396
01:19:29,739 --> 01:19:31,371
<i>I really despise the whole idea</i>

1397
01:19:31,372 --> 01:19:34,541
<i>that by being over privileged
and well educated,</i>

1398
01:19:34,542 --> 01:19:37,010
<i>that one has to live up to
certain lofty expectations.</i>

1399
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:39,946
For one, you have to live
under the proverbial shadow

1400
01:19:39,947 --> 01:19:42,014
of said father and-or namesake.

1401
01:19:42,015 --> 01:19:45,984
Two, lofty expectations can
only lead to failure, hm?

1402
01:19:45,985 --> 01:19:49,755
And three, more scientifically
and mathematically speaking,

1403
01:19:49,756 --> 01:19:51,491
if your parents were a great success,

1404
01:19:51,492 --> 01:19:55,561
I think a betting man would say that the
chances of lightning striking twice,

1405
01:19:55,761 --> 01:19:58,598
especially in consecutive generations,
is very slim.

1406
01:19:58,599 --> 01:20:02,069
You do realize you're
talking to your chauffeur.

1407
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:04,069
Touché.

1408
01:20:05,499 --> 01:20:06,973
<i>After the lukewarm reception</i>

1409
01:20:06,974 --> 01:20:08,073
<i>of his second novel,</i>

1410
01:20:08,074 --> 01:20:12,144
<i>Conrad began to spend
more time in the country,</i>

1411
01:20:12,145 --> 01:20:15,482
<i>to focus on the work,</i>

1412
01:20:15,483 --> 01:20:19,385
<i>for it was only there that he felt at ease.</i>

1413
01:20:19,386 --> 01:20:22,154
<i>It appeared Conrad's allergies
to grass and clean air</i>

1414
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:25,157
<i>had been completely psychosomatic.</i>

01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:28,495
<i>He began to reflect back
on his week with Beatrice</i>

1416
01:20:28,496 --> 01:20:30,095
<i>and thought of the old adage</i>

1417
01:20:30,096 --> 01:20:32,398
<i>"Tis better to have loved and lost</i>

1418
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:35,635
<i>"than to have never loved at all."</i>

01:20:35,636 --> 01:20:38,071
<i>Conrad reluctantly agreed,</i>

1420
01:20:38,072 --> 01:20:41,474
<i>for he still thought of Beatrice often.</i>

1421
01:20:41,475 --> 01:20:45,044
<i>At the ripe age of 42,</i>

1422
01:20:45,045 --> 01:20:48,500
<i>Conrad Valmont was finally growing up.</i>
