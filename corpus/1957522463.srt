2
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,907
{\an8}<i>Oh, my God, I just,
I just don't think I can go on.</i>

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,325
{\an8}<i>Patricia, listen to my voice.</i>

4
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,702
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

5
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>Now, let's just breathe
and weigh our options.</i>

6
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,628
{\an8}<i>What difference would options make?
After 20 years, he left me.</i>

7
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,047
{\an8}<i>Twenty long years, bastard.</i>

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,800
We've talked about him already, okay?

9
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,386
He hurt you, he tore your heart out,
and Patricia,

10
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,056
that thing with the border collie,
damn it, Patricia, I was in tears for you.

11
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,851
But what do we really know?

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,063
We know that it's okay to hurt sometimes.

13
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:08,318
We also know that he's making
no more decisions for you.

14
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,612
<i>I made up my mind, I'm hanging up.</i>

15
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,865
Patricia, you wait.
You don't hang up that phone.

16
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,616
Patricia, just stay with me.

17
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:16,702
Please.

18
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,662
Please.

19
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,252
-Patricia?
<i>-I'm still here.</i>

20
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,296
Okay, that's good.

21
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,090
Patricia, that's real good, okay?

22
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,550
I'm already seeing some growth.

23
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:37,347
Now here's the thing, Patricia.
I'm offering help, if you want it.

24
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,516
Because we all need help sometimes.

25
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,729
<i>You know what, fuck it.
Give me the full package.</i>

26
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,441
<i>Platinum Triple Play, HBO,
Starz, phone, Internet, all of it.</i>

27
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,198
I am so proud of you.

28
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,575
You've already shown so much growth.

29
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,453
{\an8}I'm gonna go ahead,
I'll put those numbers in.

30
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,164
{\an8}<i>-Great. Are you ready for my card number?
</i>-Absolutely.

31
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,075
{\an8}We will be in touch.

32
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,536
<i>-Oh, well I really appreciate--
</i>-All right now.

33
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,456
That is what you call a first ballot
hall of fame performance.

34
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,460
-Let's get another one, Big Fred.
-I understand, Ms. Wise.

35
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,629
These times are hard on all of us.

36
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,840
Internet and cable
are kind of expensive bills,

37
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,383
-especially when you have--
-No.

38
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,846
Like my mama say,
I shall keep you in my prayers, Mrs.--

39
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:46,226
Mrs. Wise. And I pray that you recognise
your freely-given faith.

40
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,937
And right here, right now,

41
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:53,233
start living in a life of abundance,
and enjoying a life of prosperity.

42
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:58,906
And the best way to exorcise that almighty
faith is to try my service today.

43
00:03:58,989 --> 00:03:59,823
God bless you.

44
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,537
You like porn? We got porn.

45
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,375
-What kind of porn we talking about?
-Oh, my corporate number, yeah.

46
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,879
It's 1-800-FUCK-YOU.

47
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,507
You want me to add you
to the do not call list?

48
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,009
Shit. I mean, shit, I mean, please.

49
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,719
I just don't think that's a good idea.

50
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,723
Kasey. Thanks.

51
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,101
But that lady might not be able
to afford our package.

52
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,395
We should do no evil.

53
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:38,779
Man, you know what? That is so crazy that
you think that I care, because I don't.

54
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,365
After the sale, bro, it's out of my hands.

55
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,824
Can't say I disagree there.

56
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,537
Yeah, unless she wants
that private dick-stillation.

57
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,705
-Bow, bow, bow--
-Get it, get it, get it.

58
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,041
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.

59
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,293
Yeah, I hurt myself a little bit.

60
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,337
Her home's in foreclosure.

61
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,799
That's unfortunate for her.

62
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,261
You know, because what they're gonna do
is they're gonna remove her from her home

63
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,807
and leave all that good entertainment
in the house for somebody else, you know?

64
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,436
All right.
Last day of the sales period, shit-heads.

65
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,523
Let's focus on the three
necessities of life.

66
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,358
Phone, cable, Internet.

67
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,776
It's just that simple.

68
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,404
Nice work.

69
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,283
But that Patricia lady, 22 minutes.

70
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,993
You going soft on me, king?

71
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:26,994
I got the sale.

72
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,245
And her life story.

73
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,123
And the sale. Listen, Liz,
your boys are running out of gas,

74
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,332
it's embarrassing, really.

75
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,505
May I remind you, 3 grand is at stake.

76
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,425
Six hours until end of business.

77
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,552
Still anyone's ballgame.

78
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,512
All right, let's see where we're at.

79
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,891
-Call them out.
-Almost had a triple.

80
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,394
And I almost cared.
Who else besides Kasey?

81
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,063
Double play. Cable and Internet.

82
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:59,818
Yeah. I hate to be that guy,
but I closed that one, Liz,

83
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,905
so go ahead and add that to mine,
plus two other triple plays.

84
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,157
-Love it.
-Yeah, sorry rookie,

85
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,450
it's the law of the land.

86
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,829
Remember, winner not only takes
our largest commission to date,

87
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,581
but also the throne chair.

88
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:17,169
-And whoever ends up in last place...
-Justin.

89
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,129
-Fuck off.
-Eat shit, asshole.

90
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,507
That means you are the lowlife loser

91
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,176
who will be given the shittiest sales list
you've ever seen.

92
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,054
Hell, if it were legal,
I'd give you the worst list.

93
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,722
The do not call list.

94
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:34,478
And for anyone whose target asks
to be put on the do not call list,

95
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,315
I'll subtract one of their miserable,
sorry ass sales.

96
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,693
Now, has anyone asked
to be put on that list?

97
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,871
Because I don't lie, okay? I never lie.

98
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,458
I'm a good person, I visit my grandma.

99
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,751
Shut up.

100
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,559
Now everyone can
just shut their pie-holes,

101
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,477
because I got a call
from corporate earlier.

102
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:20,023
They're on their way here as we speak
for an all-hands-on-deck meeting.

103
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:24,778
I have a very comfortable lead,
so I'm gonna take this as my cue to leave.

104
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,865
The meeting's kind of a big deal,
got some suits flying in from Houston.

105
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,741
Oh, Houston, lovely city,
love the Rockets.

106
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,994
-Tell them I said what up.
-Kasey.

107
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,954
I can't hear you.

108
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,551
Ladies, ladies, please.

109
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,637
No, don't get up,
I couldn't trouble you to do so.

110
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,140
I was just on my lunch break
in the neighbourhood,

111
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:58,478
and I thought to myself, huh,
who could use some roses?

112
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,357
Oh, I know.
The ladies at the Wave Hair Salon.

113
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,276
-Here you go.
-Is he crazy?

114
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,319
-For you.
-Crazy.

115
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,654
-Anyway, that's for you.
-Thank you.

116
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,073
Yeah. Shelly, Shelly, Shelly.

117
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,076
I'm just surprised it's not dripping
in snake oil.

118
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,706
You'll kill these flowers.

119
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,460
And one final rose
for a very special lady.

120
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:29,343
Two years of emotional torture,
a single rose doesn't seem quite right.

121
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,136
Well, I got two, technically.

122
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,515
So it's one step closer
to getting you back.

123
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,267
Look, is there any way
we can talk in private now?

124
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,854
Just a minute, without inmate number one.

125
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,232
Okay, Ms. Gordon?

126
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,609
I'm gonna give him his minute,
or else he won't leave.

127
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,861
Trust me, it's just better for everyone,
and I'll...

128
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,530
Okay, I understand.

129
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,699
But if you need some backup, just holler.

130
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,954
Because baby, I don't mind taking off
the earrings to put some Vaseline on you.

131
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,164
Don't have flashbacks
of your strip club days.

132
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,124
-What?
-I love you.

133
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,254
-I love you.
-I love you too, sugar.

134
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,302
Honestly, I don't wanna be
the one to say it,

135
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,056
but I don't think this
is the environment for you.

136
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:20,519
Look, I'm almost done with my master's
in psych, and unlike you,

137
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,437
I don't have a father footing the bill.

138
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,190
In there is real life,

139
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,192
and I've been waiting
for you to join me here.

140
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,195
Like, in the salon?
Baby, I can't work here.

141
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,489
-Don't be stupid.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

142
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,450
But, you know,
I'm trying here, I really am.

143
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,661
Do you want a cookie
for being a smooth talker?

144
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,706
It depends on the type of cookie.
Okay, seriously.

145
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,874
That was the last joke.

146
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,209
But I'm serious, that's why I'm here.

147
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,545
Okay? I want what you want,
I want what we want.

148
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:52,426
You always say the right thing,
but I'm not your customer, okay?

149
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,888
If you can't be open and honest
with me all of the time,

150
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,306
then there is no "we."

151
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,641
Hell, I haven't even met
all of your family yet.

152
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,186
I keep saying,
you don't want to meet my dad.

153
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,563
-I'm a family person.
-Hey, I am too.

154
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,274
Very important to me,
and I'm being for real about that.

155
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,567
Well then, prove it.

156
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,736
And don't you dare try to sell me.

157
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,154
Well, let me, okay.

158
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,699
Let me just sell you one last time
on dinner tonight.

159
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:21,288
All right, no hustles, no pickup lines,
just you, me, two fine steaks.

160
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,458
We gave up red meat.

161
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,295
We did, and I know, I remember.

162
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,631
I didn't know if you had gone back
since the breakup,

163
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,801
which is why I chose a place
with very fine aquatic selections.

164
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,680
You know what I mean? Salmon, right?
God invented that. Leafy greens?

165
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,476
Gotta have my fibre intake, you know,
because I stay backed up sometimes.

166
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,854
-Stop.
-Really gotta keep it moving, you know?

167
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:55,030
Look, there is this new French place
on 5th I've been wanting to try, so...

168
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,659
Boom. I'm gonna leave right now
before you change your mind.

169
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,369
-I can't hear.
-You can read my lips.

170
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,412
-I can read your lips.
-What am I saying?

171
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,831
-Salmon and sex?
-What time...

172
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,209
-That's not what I said.
-That's what it sounds like.

173
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,002
-Sex and salmon.
-Goodbye.

174
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,212
And not in that order.

175
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,641
Right, so, okay.

176
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:27,646
Just to clarify, 8 p.m.,
a quiet table, with a view.

177
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,107
Right. Thanks, Dana.

178
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,901
Hey, let me ask you something.
I'm not doing too much, am I?

179
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,487
You know, I mean,
there's a lot riding on this date.

180
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,741
Oh, no, I trust your taste,
it was, you know...

181
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,536
Right. All right, thanks, Dana.

182
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:52,921
Showtime.

183
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,220
-Fats, my man.
-Hey, Kasey.

184
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,181
How's that Sunday Ticket treating you?

185
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,141
Man, I ain't miss a game
all preseason, baby.

186
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,560
Hey, call me when you want
that landline, all right?

187
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,439
Cell phones for the bros, landlines...

188
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,693
Is for the other bros, because we both
know you ain't getting no bitches.

189
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,613
This is the only bitch I need, playa.

190
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:18,739
My man.

191
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,867
-Yes, I can! You're the shittiest...
-I ain't messing with that,

192
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,993
that's all you.

193
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,329
-That chick is a wild one.
-Oh, my God.

194
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,290
That's good.

195
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,292
You just have it out for me
because I'm short.

196
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,294
-Oh, because you're short?
-Yeah.

197
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,338
No, because you don't know how to sell.

198
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,672
You are useless, go!

199
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,675
-Can you get him out of here?
-You know what? You can suck my shit.

200
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,346
I am gonna come back here
and bite everybody's dick off.

201
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,890
Okay, go back to Jersey,
Justin, make your mama happy.

202
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,225
Yeah, you come to New Jersey,

203
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,726
-you see what we do to you.
-Okay.

204
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,145
I'll bury you in the sand in the shore!

205
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,105
Yup. You, my office.

206
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,275
<i>You know, Mrs. Hanks, what it is,</i>

207
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,237
<i>Russia's gonna start tapping
all American cell phones very soon.</i>

208
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,239
<i>-My Lord.
-Do yourself a favour</i>

209
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:04,243
<i>and add our phone package today.
It's the only way to stay safe from Putin.</i>

210
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,411
I'm listening, but that's not me.

211
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:10,207
I know it sounds like me,
but that's not me, you know.

212
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,667
-No?
-A lot of people...

213
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,420
Russian spyware, you know what I mean?
They can make you sound like anybody.

214
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,589
You listen to Joe Rogan podcasts?

215
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,800
-No.
-Oh, you'll see,

216
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,635
maybe you should start, educate yourself.

217
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,346
You know, before you bring
on these accusations.

218
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,074
Sorry, Justin.

219
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,662
{\an8}<i>We must show patriotism
by honouring a true American icon.</i>

220
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:53,041
I told a deception.
I shouldn't have told a deception.

221
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,879
I know, and I've learned from it,
and I've grown, really.

222
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,505
-I've grown from it. Yeah.
-You have?

223
00:13:58,589 --> 00:13:59,631
I've learned my lesson.

224
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,717
-Today is a new day. For me.
-Okay.

225
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,760
{\an8}<i>Any idea who that man might be?</i>

226
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,263
{\an8}<i>-Mr. Rogers?
-Not Rogers, ma'am.</i>

227
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,432
{\an8}<i>-James, Rick James.
-Rick James?</i>

228
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,100
{\an8}<i>That's right, Rick James.</i>

229
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,686
<i>The one and only founding father
of "Super Freaks."</i>

230
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,605
<i>-Super what?
</i>-It sounds like I haven't grown

231
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,356
when you play it back.

232
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,026
-Yeah.
<i>-Our wonderful Triple Play package.</i>

233
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,778
<i>Someone will personally hand-deliver
a one of a kind</i>

234
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,198
<i>Rick James wig right to your doorstep.</i>

235
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:27,743
<i>Oh, my, that would be nice.
I bet my granddaughter would want one too.</i>

236
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,871
-Rick James.
-Kinda funny.

237
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,209
I'd been listening to some "Super Freak"
on the car ride.

238
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,960
-Creative.
-Yeah.

239
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:41,757
Already over 100,000 views,
and you've mentioned the company's name.

240
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,053
Corporate fucking loved it.

241
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,222
Wait, so they're not upset?

242
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,767
Upset? They nearly jizzed
their double-pleated slacks

243
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,561
at the social media exposure
and potential revenue.

244
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,105
-And with you being top salesman.
-I am.

245
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:01,068
They demanded that the entire floor adopts
the Kasey Method.

246
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:02,903
The Kasey Method.

247
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:04,696
Yeah.

248
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,074
Check out the front row.

249
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,873
Hi, yes, this is Barry calling you
from TeleWin.

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,835
Yeah.

251
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:23,006
Actually, you know, when my pastor was 20,
he cared what everybody thought about him.

252
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,844
When he turned 40, he didn't care
what nobody thought about him.

253
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,096
But when he turned 60,

254
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,307
he realised nobody cared
what they thought about him.

255
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,727
So, what I'm trying to say is,
ma'am, you shouldn't care,

256
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,396
you should buy one of these packages.

257
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,773
Yes, okay.

258
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,989
I like my coffee like I like my men.

259
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,533
I don't, because I like girls.

260
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,494
And everybody around here knows it.
Why are you in my chair?

261
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,205
I'm sorry,
I just thought you wouldn't mind--

262
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,291
"Sorry, Kasey."
You thought I wouldn't mind?

263
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,793
Is that bow tie cutting off
the circulation to your brain?

264
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,838
I guess I just wanted to channel
the master, that's all.

265
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,840
-But hey--
-Hey, hey, hey.

266
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,801
It's not about the chair.

267
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,136
The chair don't make the man.

268
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,263
Because no matter how long you sit
in this chair,

269
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:15,392
you will always be second place.

270
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,021
But not just to me, God hates you.

271
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,903
I like how you got my chair,
but couldn't...

272
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,197
Couldn't make the switch, could you?

273
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,741
This is something
you can relate to, Barry?

274
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:35,787
You know what I mean? Everybody standing
around watching like this is a music show.

275
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,211
Is that my mocha choca king sitting
in a regular ass chair?

276
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,922
Well, I'm just feeling
generous today, gentlemen, that's it.

277
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,549
Then why the Payday Loan?

278
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,469
What, they called you?

279
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,013
Asked a bunch of weird questions.
Like your nipple shape.

280
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,890
I said Africa, I kept it safe.

281
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,767
-That's accurate.
-Right there.

282
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,353
My man.
You told them I was a good dude?

283
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,438
Of course I did.
You know what I'm saying?

284
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:04,983
-Right there.
-I said you had great taste in music.

285
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,734
You said that? Look, anyway,

286
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:09,488
I just have a very special purchase
I had to make.

287
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,698
These loan companies
don't fuck around though, man.

288
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,953
My uncle, he almost lost his left nut
because he defaulted on a payment.

289
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,205
Bro, could you imagine making
a <i>Sophie's Choice</i> with your nutsack?

290
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,125
It's like left truffle, right truffle.

291
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,838
As long as I cash out
by tonight as planned,

292
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,341
me and my truffles are perfectly fine.

293
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,718
I love truffles.

294
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,179
Y'all thought process puzzles me.

295
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,391
I'll sign you up
for the package right now.

296
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,935
Holy shit.
Man, look at the scoreboard.

297
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,939
-Yes, ma'am.
-That's real cute.

298
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,732
Real cute, rookie.

299
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,693
Let's go get another one, Big Fred.

300
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,863
This is Barry calling from TeleWin,
and I'm trying to upgrade you now.

301
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,700
I like to shoot straight.

302
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,370
Better cable service while he's gone,
fucking all those other women.

303
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,247
I was born and raised in Texas like you.

304
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,709
Sometimes I like to grab the bull by
its horns and do you know what to them.

305
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,878
I can sign you up right now.

306
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,046
-Hello?
-One for Barry.

307
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,342
Whatever, dude.
Even a broken clock's right twice a day.

308
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,887
Absolutely, sir, I'm from fucking Boston.

309
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,515
-Yeah. Fucking Boston, I went to BU.
-Clock's ticking.

310
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,766
Two banger for Barry.

311
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,061
He's having a little lucky streak.
That's all good.

312
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:26,023
-Triple play for Barry.
-Shit, Barry.

313
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,319
You can learn from your failures.

314
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,405
Hey, our phones, anybody's phone,
Debra, is your phone messed up?

315
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,574
That last company failed you,
but we won't.

316
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:39,328
Kasey still has a clear lead,
but he's clearly under pressure.

317
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,330
The same pressure he faced in law school.

318
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,582
The same pressure that caused him
to flunk out.

319
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,499
Dropped out.

320
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,213
All right, choir boy, I got you.

321
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,465
Another single play for Barry.

322
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,091
Fucking is it hot?

323
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:56,553
-Two banger for Barry.
-Debra, can you turn the a.c. up?

324
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,807
-Another one for Barry.
-Debra, you're way behind.

325
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,684
So don't even look at me
with judging eyes.

326
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,394
Yeah, you've reached Kasey.

327
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,730
Fuck.

328
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,943
-Fuck.
-How's this for a bonus?

329
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,488
24-carat gold-plated iPad.

330
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:19,451
Can I get a word in? No, I called you,
so you have to wonder what I'm--

331
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,286
As soon as I called, you started yelling.

332
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,498
-Hello?
<i>-It's Christine.</i>

333
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,044
Oh, hey. Hey, babe.

334
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,089
<i>Hey, I'm just checking
if you made the reservation.</i>

335
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,092
Did I make the reservations?

336
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,762
Yes, oh, sorry.
Of course I made the reservation.

337
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:40,973
I'm writing you down right now.

338
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,349
<i>Are you okay? You sound off.</i>

339
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,143
No, no, I sound weird? You know...

340
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,228
Fuck you.

341
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,398
I don't sound weird,
you're the one who sounds weird.

342
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,776
I'm just at work making deals
like Gordon Gekko.

343
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,695
<i>Oh, I bet you are.</i>

344
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,698
<i>I bet Gordon Gekko
would be making money right now</i>

345
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:01,326
<i>and probably would be allowed
personal calls from his very own office.</i>

346
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,038
Get off the damn phone, Liz.
Hey, babe, listen, I gotta go.

347
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:10,085
Okay? I have to--
I will talk to you later.

348
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,086
All right, bye.

349
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,088
Time.

350
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,136
Huddle up.

351
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,807
Looks like Kasey's got it again.

352
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,310
-How many more you got, king?
-What, what?

353
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,396
-My man.
-How many more you got?

354
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,815
-How many do I...
-Yeah, how many more do you got?

355
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,861
-Oh, no, that's it right there.
-That's it?

356
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,489
I'm saying when you put all
the numbers together combined, yeah.

357
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,783
Anybody else got anything?

358
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:42,701
Just one.

359
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,746
Yeah, well, sorry,
single play's not enough.

360
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,165
Just one triple play.

361
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,210
Yes.

362
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,340
Holy shit. That's...

363
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,884
You win by one.

364
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,970
Oh, that's major.

365
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,430
Good shit, Barry.

366
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,182
I demand a recount on that.

367
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,894
Single but stable family home.
I got her to go for the triple.

368
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:12,856
Easy, easy, okay?

369
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,484
I mean, I just had a lucky day,
I'm not sure how it happened.

370
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,403
You used the Kasey Method,
I bet that's what happened.

371
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,864
Actually, I used my own method.

372
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,327
And don't forget my smile.

373
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,455
I mean, they may not see it,
but they can feel it.

374
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,417
Looks like the king
and his method is dead.

375
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,836
Barry, take the chair.

376
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:39,800
Hey, but listen...

377
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,804
They just give you a chair
and they snatch it right back.

378
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,640
-I know, every once in a while...
-Have a great weekend.

379
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:51,812
You leave it out in the sun.

380
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,734
Barry, dude, you, oh my, don't do that.

381
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,778
You do that, you could've been a victim.

382
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,197
-I'm sorry, Kase.
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

383
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:06,034
I just came over here because
I feel like you should have this.

384
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:11,039
-You deserve it.
-Honestly, bro, I wasn't really trying.

385
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:15,127
You know what I mean? I had an
off day and it was a lot going on,

386
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,088
so you deserve that, you keep it, man.

387
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,175
Have a blessed day, Kasey.

388
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,262
Fuck, man.

389
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,182
Thirty minutes.

390
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:32,186
I just need 30 minutes, I need to get
this bonus for the weekend, please.

391
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,355
You already get the best leads
on the floor, what more do you want?

392
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:38,525
I can't tell.
The way I'm striking out out there.

393
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,611
There's something going on
with my sheets.

394
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:41,570
You had a bad day.

395
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,407
Liz, Liz.

396
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:52,164
Liz, I'm rather sure this wouldn't be
your first "adjustment."

397
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,042
You know what I'm talking about.
Latrice, last year,

398
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,003
I'm pretty sure
you helped her make quota, right?

399
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,838
Her kid had leukaemia.

400
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,840
Damn it, Liz, I got leukaemia!

401
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,427
I don't have leukaemia,
I don't have leukaemia.

402
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,971
You know, but I got something worse
than leukaemia, right?

403
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:09,890
I have a gigantic loan I gotta pay back,

404
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:15,062
or else I may lose something...
that I may never get back.

405
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,689
Liz, look at me, look at me.
Hey, hey, hey.

406
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:21,860
Right, I make one bundle sale, boom,
it'll put me over the top, and we're good.

407
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:24,029
No handouts,
let me go out there and do my thing.

408
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:25,948
Please.

409
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,201
-Sorry, Kasey.
-Fuck!

410
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,763
<i>-Hey.
</i>-Hey, hey babe, listen.

411
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,808
You're never gonna believe this, but,

412
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,810
the restaurant bumped
our reservation to 8:30.

413
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,688
<i>Oh, damn. I was just leaving my place.</i>

414
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,315
Yeah, I know, I know, that sucks.

415
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,401
But hey, look, when we get there,

416
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,611
I'm gonna give the manager
a stern talking-to.

417
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,613
Maybe they'll give us...

418
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,907
Maybe they'll comp dessert
or something like that.

419
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,034
<i>It's cool, it's just 30 minutes,
we'll survive.</i>

420
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,079
<i>You know,
I've got a good feeling about this dinner.</i>

421
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,956
-Oh, you do?
<i>-I do.</i>

422
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,249
<i>So don't mess it up.</i>

423
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:18,834
Come on, babe.

424
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:19,751
You know me.

425
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:23,255
<i>Okay, you used to quit talking
before I could change my mind.</i>

426
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,757
I can't hear a word you're saying
because I gotta go, bye.

427
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:33,932
Showtime.

428
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,358
Come on.
Where's those fucking call sheets?

429
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,032
Come on.

430
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:57,748
Oh, shit.

431
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,977
I swear to God,
don't you ever leave me again.

432
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:21,730
I missed you.

433
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,274
What do we got?

434
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,694
Okay. Let's get another one, Big Fred.

435
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:35,619
Time to get creative.

436
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:40,165
{\an8}I know somebody forgot
they're on this stupid list.

437
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:50,259
Hello there. Oh, is this Kate Carpenter?

438
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,970
Yeah, this is Kasey at TeleWin.

439
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,097
Hello? Hello?

440
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,015
Fuck.

441
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,853
Shit, come on.

442
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:10,028
Hello, Reef. Reef, yeah.
I got a deal for you, man.

443
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:12,155
I shouldn't be calling you this late,
but, hello?

444
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,033
Shit, maybe a little too pervy.

445
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,582
Bingo. Instagram.

446
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:26,253
No, you strike me
as a Facebook type of individual

447
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,797
due to your advanced age.

448
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,761
Phil French. Bingo.

449
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,683
Phil French, Phil French.

450
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,393
Phil, Phil, Phil.

451
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,606
Phil, Phil, yeah, Phil French.

452
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,318
<i>Hello?</i>

453
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,486
Hey there, Asa.

454
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,365
Yeah, it's a voice out of the past.

455
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:58,327
Phil French from marching band,
how you doing, buddy?

456
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,954
<i>Phil? Phil, is that really you?</i>

457
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,497
Yeah, it's me.

458
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:04,625
Long time, eh?

459
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,502
<i>You bet you it's been a while.</i>

460
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,463
<i>-Well, how are you, my man?
</i>-Oh, me?

461
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,090
Well, I'm in the Valley.

462
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,801
Yeah, I'm in the Valley, you know.

463
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,430
I was thinking about old times,
and I thought I'd look you up.

464
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,307
<i>You still playing that horn?</i>

465
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,017
Oh, you damn right I am.

466
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:25,312
You can't pull my mouth off
of that horn if you tried.

467
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:28,106
I suck, I blow, I do it all.

468
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,025
I'm in the big band now.

469
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:34,488
You know, weddings, bar mitzvahs,
assisted suicides, the whole thing.

470
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:37,282
<i>-Hey, don't I know it.
</i>-Yeah.

471
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:38,700
<i>Well, haven't you retired?</i>

472
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,327
Well, I'll tell you this.

473
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,248
You know, I didn't work enough quarters
to get my Social Security,

474
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:48,043
then the bursitis started flaring up
again along with the gout

475
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,962
and what have you, and such, and so forth.

476
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:52,506
And so, now I'm over here selling cable.

477
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,678
Say, you wouldn't happen to be
in the marketplace for cable,

478
00:27:58,512 --> 00:27:59,680
Internet, or phone?

479
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,266
Hell, the entire bundle.
I tell you what, you know,

480
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,977
I could hook you up
with a pretty sweet deal.

481
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,312
First three months,
hell, four months for free.

482
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,564
<i>Oh, I'd love that.</i>

483
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,608
<i>You know, I've got a son who's looking
to break into your business,</i>

484
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:15,320
<i>that telemarketing thing that y'all do.</i>

485
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:16,947
<i>Which one do you work for?</i>

486
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,323
TeleWin, Northridge.

487
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:21,326
Right up the block
from Tarzana, small town.

488
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,037
You know? But tell your son
he can call me here anytime.

489
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,999
<i>I see. You know,
I'm still in the Valley myself.</i>

490
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:27,958
<i>Well, my son and I.</i>

491
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,043
Like I said before, that's great,

492
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,421
he can call me here
whenever he feels the need to.

493
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:35,966
But let me take care of you.

494
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,428
Let's get you set up, huh?

495
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,889
We can go out and get that drink
and talk about old times

496
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,974
and all the loose women you used
to run through.

497
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,058
<i>Now, Phil.</i>

498
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:48,061
<i>Let me ask you a question now.</i>

499
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:52,733
<i>How do they pay your commissions,
halos or Hail Marys?</i>

500
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,611
-Come again?
<i>-Maybe harps, asshole,</i>

501
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,154
<i>because Phil French,</i>

502
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:00,866
<i>you died five years ago
from alcoholic poisoning.</i>

503
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:05,287
<i>Buried in a rainstorm at Forest Lawn
like God was crying.</i>

504
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,039
Like God was crying.

505
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,208
Yeah, I know, that was a sad time.

506
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,672
<i>First off, asshole,
I'm on the do not fucking call list.</i>

507
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:18,926
<i>I've got a particular set of skills.</i>

508
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,552
-Blah, blah, blah.
<i>-Wherever you are.</i>

509
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,763
Take it easy, cowboy, pull the saddle out.

510
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,556
Gotta go. Motherfucker.

511
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,308
God. Okay.

512
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:31,188
We're good, we're good, we're good.

513
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,358
Zachary Morris.

514
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,526
Zachary Morris.

515
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,362
Hello, Zachary Morris?
How you doing, mate?

516
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:39,947
Yeah, this is Kasey, over at...

517
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,366
Fuck, dumb ass.

518
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,371
Hello, you want cable? No? Fuck you. Shit.

519
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:48,914
I'm all of those things, yeah.

520
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:53,085
No, I cannot send you a videotape
of me shoving my hand up my own asshole.

521
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,002
Hello?

522
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,839
Hello, you like Internet? No?
Suck my dick.

523
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:01,885
{\an8}Come on, Big Fred.
What the fuck is going on?

524
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,971
I got this, this is nothing, dude.

525
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:05,931
This is nothing, bro.

526
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,020
Hello, Genevieve?
It's that time of the month again.

527
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:13,897
Well, not like that, I mean...

528
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,067
Fuck, man. You've got to be kidding me.

529
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:23,198
I am a swan, and this is my pond.

530
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,495
I am a swan, and this is my pond.

531
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:31,456
Oh, my God, you look so stupid right now,
wow, this is amazing.

532
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,041
I'm channelling my chi.

533
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,043
-Jesus Christ.
-What are you still doing here?

534
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:39,339
Catching up on some late work,
but the power's out on our floor, so...

535
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:40,966
Well, it's a shit building, brother.

536
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,760
But maintenance is coming,
they'll be here in a minute.

537
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,846
That's good. I'm glad you're on it.

538
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:47,472
Self-love, baby.

539
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:48,640
Try it sometime.

540
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,768
Good, thank you.

541
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:53,687
Jesus Christ.

542
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:55,898
Hey, man, you Jim?

543
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:57,232
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

544
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,152
So you got your stuff?

545
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,570
-Yeah.
-Follow me.

546
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:02,529
Following.

547
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,660
Hey, man. I'm a security enforcement
specialist, not a valet.

548
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:09,786
I can't hear you.

549
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:19,004
I am beautiful, I am kind, I am smart.

550
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,178
Hey, what is it you guys
do around here anyway?

551
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,889
-Telemarketing.
-No shit?

552
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,141
This is where they sell me Viagra.

553
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:35,354
Yeah, no Viagra here.
Well, not yet at least.

554
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:38,982
-Just, cable, Internet, phone, you know.
-Not that I need it.

555
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,277
Oh, fuck.

556
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:43,237
Oh, boy.

557
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:48,200
-Say, Jim, is it?
-Yes, sir.

558
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,661
Let me ask you something,
how's your Internet connection?

559
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:52,412
So-so.

560
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:54,373
So-so? That's not good.

561
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,625
TV, phone?

562
00:31:56,708 --> 00:32:00,671
-Oh, I see what you're doing.
-It depends on if you're buying.

563
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:05,425
No, I don't really have time for the tube.
I'm just kind of tied up with this stuff.

564
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,720
Right. Speaking of which, how we looking?

565
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:09,638
You know...

566
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:14,351
I brought the wrong tool bag,
I'm gonna have to run back out to the van.

567
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,561
Okay, all right.

568
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:24,194
So, I mean, how long is that gonna be?
I have...

569
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:25,779
I got a date tonight.

570
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:27,573
-Oh, lucky fucker.
-Yeah.

571
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,158
About 10-15 minutes tops.

572
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:31,368
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

573
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,495
10-15, 10-15.

574
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,247
Shit.

575
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,459
What the fuck?

576
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,461
Come on, dude...

577
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:53,849
Fuck.

578
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:57,311
Jesus.

579
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:07,738
What the fuck?

580
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:10,908
Big Fred?

581
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:14,411
No. Rise and shine.

582
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:17,664
Oh, shit.

583
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,666
Are you from the Payday Loan?

584
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:21,418
Hey.

585
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,880
Hey, man, look.

586
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:27,049
I can get you your money, I swear.

587
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:29,635
Just don't cut off my dick.

588
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:33,931
I'm Asa.

589
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,141
Asa Ellenbogen.

590
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,311
How you doing, Kasey Miller?

591
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:43,440
Or should I say, Phil French?

592
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,610
Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

593
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,820
No, I'm not kidding you.

594
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,615
Where's the electrician?

595
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:57,829
Well, let's just say,
he probably won't be coming back.

596
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,373
Fuck.

597
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,960
Okay, give me my phone, dude.

598
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,462
-Where's my phone?
-Looking for this?

599
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:07,756
Shit!

600
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:13,762
More like a big old brick with a computer,
camera, Interwebs, what have you.

601
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:15,597
I'm gonna keep this in my pocket for you.

602
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,014
Okay.

603
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,684
Okay, man.

604
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,478
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing here,

605
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:25,774
but let's just call it even
and go our separate ways.

606
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,193
Go our separate ways?

607
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,612
We was just getting to know each other.

608
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:37,703
Unlike you, I'm a man of my word.

609
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:40,789
-Hey, look man, just listen.
-I wish I could say the same for you.

610
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:45,710
Look, I get it, I tried to sell you,
and that's on me, I'm so sorry about that.

611
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,839
But I was in a real bad position.
I was in a fucked-up spot.

612
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,800
I had to pay back this
Payday loan because I lost a contest.

613
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:53,677
Oh, well, that's a shame.

614
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,766
How about if you was to hook me up
with the cable-Internet-phone bundle,

615
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,436
free for life, would you win?

616
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,897
With the NFL Sunday Ticket included?

617
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:10,152
-I can't--
-Of course you can't!

618
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,490
You know, while you were sleeping,

619
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,580
I was thinking of all the fun ways
I could lay you off.

620
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,666
You know, when you hang around
this place long enough,

621
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,919
-you develop quite the active imagination.
-Yeah.

622
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:30,005
You ever imagine you'd be tied
to your office chair

623
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:33,884
with some old coot on disability
with a fucking gun to your head?

624
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:39,223
To be fair, death threats happen
all the time, it's a part of the job.

625
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:42,809
But no, this is the first time
that it actually--

626
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:45,229
Oh, first time someone actually did it?

627
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:47,648
Yeah. That about sums it up.

628
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:52,694
Hey, look, man, listen. About this
whole pretending to be your friend thing.

629
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:55,531
-My dead friend.
-Yeah.

630
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:56,990
Yup, because he's dead,

631
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:59,409
your dead friend thing
with the funny name.

632
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:02,829
-Phil French.
-Oh, he was adopted, jackass.

633
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:08,085
Yeah, I know, and for that I am so sorry,
about the adoption and everything.

634
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,963
I had nothing to do with the adoption,
but I'm sorry anyway.

635
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,090
-Are you now?
-Yeah, truly.

636
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,925
You know, my grandfather, he used to say,

637
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:18,512
this country was not built on--

638
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:21,974
Stop selling for once
in your goddamn life.

639
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:25,644
Do you know
how to have a normal conversation?

640
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:28,105
Well, damn it, Asa,
under normal circumstances, yes.

641
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,982
But this ain't exactly normal now, is it?

642
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:33,026
In fact, I'll have you know,
that people around this office,

643
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,237
they call me the king at conversations.

644
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,698
Yeah. Words are my tools.

645
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:38,907
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

646
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:40,617
Words are your sales tools.

647
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:42,619
I'm talking about real talk.

648
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,580
Here, now.

649
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,248
Let's start with a simple question.

650
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:50,169
-Why?
-Why what?

651
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:51,879
Why'd you do it, Kasey?

652
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,298
Look, I told you already. Come on, man.

653
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,508
I told you, I had to pay back
a debt, you know?

654
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:57,426
For what?

655
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,722
For a ring. An engagement ring.

656
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,725
This girl, she's the love of my life.

657
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:09,313
Am I supposed to feel all warm
and squishy inside?

658
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,815
Look, I tell you what,
let me just go to my car and I'll--

659
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,066
You ain't going nowhere.

660
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:16,945
Liar, liar.

661
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:19,740
Okay, hey. Hey, hey, look.

662
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,909
My monitor, my Instagram is up.

663
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,368
Just no B.S., no lies.

664
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:26,330
-Right there.
-Just hit a key? Where do I see it?

665
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,624
It's right there,
on the top corner right there.

666
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:29,958
Well, what am I looking at?

667
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:32,169
That's her. That's her, right there.

668
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:34,755
Well, ain't no mention of you.

669
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,883
Well, you know,
we like to keep our relationship low.

670
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:39,051
Like Jay-Z and Beyoncé.

671
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,553
Bet when you found out they were together
you were amazed.

672
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:45,015
Well, lookie here.
In her status, it says she's single.

673
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:48,435
-Dang, is that what that says?
-That's what that says.

674
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,939
Single, ready to mingle.
Yeah, you see my point, though?

675
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,734
-I do. It's bullshit, that's the point.
-You see my point?

676
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:57,903
I don't know what that is.

677
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:01,532
Look, let's play a game.

678
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:04,284
-You like contests, Kasey?
-Fuck.

679
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,453
What kind of contests we talking?

680
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:14,086
Now, I'm gonna give you one hour
to apologise on behalf of yourself

681
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:18,423
and, well, all you wretched scum-sucking
telemarketing sales leeches,

682
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:22,719
to apologise to as many
of these people as you can.

683
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:26,974
You want me to call the people
on the do not call list

684
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:31,728
and apologise on behalf of the people
who made them want to be put

685
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:34,064
on the do not call list
in the first place?

686
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,066
And you didn't even take a note.

687
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:38,861
I don't think they'll be too receptive.

688
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:42,239
Which can be a problem
for people seeking forgiveness,

689
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:45,284
it's true, but that doesn't mean
you don't need to be forgiven, Kasey.

690
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:47,160
I guess.

691
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,454
You guess.

692
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,918
Well, don't you think that if you wronged
someone and you know it,

693
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:59,089
that you have to seek forgiveness?
That you have a responsibility?

694
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:02,134
Okay, man, now this is starting
to sound a lot like Sunday School,

695
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,886
and I hate Sunday School.

696
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,929
Sister Johnson was my teacher,
she had no legs,

697
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,223
she used to make me carry her around
like a backpack.

698
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,103
This is the night
of your redemption, Kasey.

699
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:19,026
If you can get just one person
to accept your apology...

700
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,696
then you can go home.

701
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:27,993
Now, you see, the choice is all yours.

702
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,663
Okay, what if they don't accept?

703
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:36,793
Well, then you can give my very best
to Phil French.

704
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:39,880
Let's get to dialling.

705
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,426
Oh, I'm so fucked.

706
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,385
I'm so fucked.

707
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:46,887
-Now.
-Okay, all right.

708
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:48,931
Oh, shit!

709
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:50,724
Goddamn it, man!

710
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,061
You son of a bitch, you shot Big Fred.

711
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:57,564
Apologies to Fred.
At least now he knows it's loaded.

712
00:39:58,774 --> 00:39:59,691
All right, man.

713
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:01,985
-Speakerphone.
-Okay, okay.

714
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:07,699
Give it your best.

715
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:09,243
<i>Yeah, who this?</i>

716
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,494
Congratulations.

717
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:16,583
You have been personally selected
to receive a once-in-a-lifetime apology.

718
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:24,091
On behalf of myself as well as
all telemarketers around the whole globe.

719
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:29,972
We are deeply sorry
for all of our past transgressions.

720
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:33,058
<i>-You tripping.
</i>-So that's your approach?

721
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:36,645
Maybe I should just shoot you now,
put you out of your misery.

722
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:37,980
No, no, look, look.

723
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,942
To be fair, I'm not in my element.
And RIP Big Fred, you know what I mean?

724
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:45,279
I miss you, my nigga. I gotta get focused.

725
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:48,699
It's showtime, you motherfucker.
You ain't shit, yes I am.

726
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:50,909
-Dial.
-Okay, okay.

727
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:57,040
Hey, how you doing there Mrs. Goldfarb,
how's this evening treating you?

728
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,626
<i>Fine. What is this about?</i>

729
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,213
I want to apologise on behalf of myself
and all the telemarketers that

730
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:07,467
may have contacted you and called your
mobile or your home phone in the past.

731
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:10,929
Do you accept our apology?

732
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:14,099
<i>-You've got to be kidding me.
</i>-No, okay.

733
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:17,144
I'm not kidding you. Let's start there.
This is a very serious thing.

734
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:20,105
-Do you accept our apology?
<i>-I'm hanging up now.</i>

735
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:23,108
No, no, please, don't hang up.
Okay, I'm losing my thread here.

736
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:25,611
I want to give you something deep
and personal.

737
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,030
<i>William, there's a creep on the phone.</i>

738
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:30,240
<i>You're in big trouble now, mister.</i>

739
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:32,201
<i>-Look here, you piece of shit.
</i>-Fuck me.

740
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:33,952
<i>I advise you to hang up now,</i>

741
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:37,289
<i>or I'm gonna shove my shotgun
down your throat and make an omelette</i>

742
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:40,167
<i>with your goddamn tonsils, you freak.</i>

743
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,668
And I deserve that, sir.

744
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,838
I truly do deserve that.
You have yourself a blessed evening.

745
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:49,176
You know, my wife used
to get these kinds of calls,

746
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:53,388
but she was kinder than me.
She was too kind.

747
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:57,184
You know, she used to think about you kids

748
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:59,937
in places like this
trying to make ends meet.

749
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:05,234
Kind of made her a perfect prey
for the vultures.

750
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:09,821
You'd call her house,
you'd call her cell phone.

751
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:16,453
You'd sell, sell, sell and she'd
buy, buy, buy, and then we'd fight.

752
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,249
I'm sorry about that, sir.

753
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:21,875
No, you aren't.

754
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:27,422
What's your girlfriend's name again?
The one that says she's single?

755
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:30,509
That was just a misunderstanding,

756
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,220
we're actually together,
I just want to let you know that.

757
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,681
-Yeah? Christine.
-Her name is Christine.

758
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:39,726
Let's say a miracle were to happen,
and the two of you were to get hitched.

759
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:44,648
Now, if she bought a load of crap
every day on the phone,

760
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:47,568
would that be good for your marriage?

761
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:51,655
To be fair, she is her own woman,
and I wouldn't have a say in the matter.

762
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,657
But if she spent all your money.

763
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:59,621
Well, you know, psychologists
in this town makes a lot of money, so...

764
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:02,749
Now, I'm gonna give you one more chance
to answer my question.

765
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:05,335
Would you want your future wife

766
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:08,714
to buy a load of crap
from people like you?

767
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,758
No, sir, I would not.

768
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:17,097
Well, that's the first honest thing
you've said all night.

769
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,442
Goddamn it.

770
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:31,445
Listen, you're gonna get rid of this guy.

771
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:36,283
-Go get, get, get.
-Okay. Okay.

772
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,958
I swear to Christ,
if you fucking make a run for it,

773
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,085
I'll follow you down,

774
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:48,962
and I'll blow a hole
in your fucking spine.

775
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,216
If that cop comes this way,
I'll blow a hole in his spine.

776
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,843
Okay, fine,
so what should I tell him then?

777
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,763
Just tap into that active imagination.

778
00:43:58,514 --> 00:43:59,723
Okay, I'll just lie to him.

779
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,235
Good evening.
I didn't see you there, this glass door.

780
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:17,324
We got a report about
a shot fired in the area. Heard anything?

781
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:18,909
-A shot fired?
-Yeah.

782
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:20,410
In this building?

783
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:22,746
Wow, it's such a peaceful
community building.

784
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,289
You know, no.

785
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:26,542
Oh, now I understand.

786
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:30,087
It must've been the cherry bomb.
Was it the cherry bomb?

787
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,923
-Cherry bomb?
-It was a cherry bomb, yeah.

788
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,550
You know it's not the 4th of July?

789
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:38,011
It's not the 4th of July, and I know that.

790
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:40,973
You know, we're telemarketers, right?

791
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:44,017
We work late sometimes,

792
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:49,022
and we play pranks on each other to build
the morale around the office, you know?

793
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:51,233
Yeah, we know.

794
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:55,863
-So who else is here?
-Oh, just me. I know what you're thinking.

795
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:58,740
I'm the team leader,
so they look up to me,

796
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:02,160
so when I'm here alone,
I still do the pranks to keep up.

797
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:03,495
You know what I mean?

798
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:04,955
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

799
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,293
-All right.
-Yeah.

800
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:11,503
Well, no more cherry bombs.

801
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:13,672
You got it. You know?

802
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:18,844
Hey, you guys sell Internet here, right?

803
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:20,304
Yes, we do.

804
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:24,766
My two teens are just obsessed
with goddamn online gaming.

805
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:27,144
Killing my bandwidth.

806
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:29,605
Think I need one of those fibre optics.

807
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:32,691
-Fibre optics.
-You guys got any special deals or...

808
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:36,236
I'm so sorry, sir,
your timing could not have been worse.

809
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:39,865
But you know something?

810
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:42,534
I'm sorry for that.

811
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:44,161
I'm sorry for your inconvenience.

812
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:49,041
In fact, I want to apologise on behalf
of all telemarketers, all over the world.

813
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,418
So do you forgive us?

814
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:57,591
-Sure. Sure whatever.
-All right.

815
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:59,885
-That is so great to hear.
-No more cherry bombs.

816
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:01,887
-No more cherry bombs.
-No more cherry bombs.

817
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,597
-I love you.
-That's weird.

818
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:09,728
-You heard, right?
-Yes, I did.

819
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:13,690
Okay, I apologised on behalf
of all telemarketers and he accepted.

820
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:16,401
Yeah, but it wasn't on the phone.

821
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:18,737
That's our arrangement.

822
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,073
-Come on, man.
-You wreak havoc on the phone,

823
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:23,367
-you make things right on the phone.
-Shit.

824
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,910
Excuse me?

825
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,747
I'm saying I gotta take a shit.

826
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:33,126
I've been backed up lately
and trying to eat my carrots...

827
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,258
Four minutes.

828
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:41,718
Really? You're timing my poops?

829
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,053
Three minutes.

830
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:46,265
Come on, dude, I'm backed up,
I don't know how long it's gonna...

831
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:50,477
This is some unconstitutional shit,
literally. Okay?

832
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,106
Hey, mind if I use your phone?

833
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:57,150
Oh, yeah, go ahead, man.
Just dial 9 at the desk.

834
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:59,820
You can't call Mexico,
sometimes it gets a little wonky.

835
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:01,780
I mean the one in your pocket.

836
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:03,782
My pocket?

837
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:05,951
What?

838
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:10,622
Oh, my God, that's crazy.

839
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:13,166
Two minutes, 45 seconds.

840
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,084
Shit, okay.

841
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,547
Okay. Okay.

842
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,469
What would Bruce Willis do?

843
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:28,307
Oh, shit.

844
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,309
Clock's ticking, Kasey!

845
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:34,855
Yeah, I'm... It's something I ate, man.

846
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:37,316
Fuck, Kasey.

847
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:41,028
Don't make me come in there
and shoot you while you're shitting!

848
00:47:58,337 --> 00:47:59,171
Kasey!

849
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:05,677
Yeah.

850
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,554
Okay.

851
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:14,478
It's bad in there.

852
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,105
-Get.
-I had to wipe from front to back.

853
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:18,190
Oh, good for you.

854
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:27,366
What you looking at?

855
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:29,076
This bullshit.

856
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:33,789
Looks like you all want to be
the next Big Red, don't you?

857
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:35,666
Fred, it's Big Fred.

858
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:37,292
Was he good?

859
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,838
They say he sold
the downtown Marriott, so...

860
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:42,673
Well, that must've been some commission.

861
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:45,217
Yeah, and they didn't pay him
in halos either.

862
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:49,805
-Looks like Barry is the next Fred.
-No.

863
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:54,351
That's beginner's luck, unfortunately.

864
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:55,686
Well, now,

865
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:01,942
if it had have happened like that,
we'd have never met.

866
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:16,874
Hello, Ms. Daniels.

867
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:19,877
{\an8}She hung up.

868
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:22,129
All right, loser, dial another.

869
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:25,507
Come on, Asa.
Really? How much longer we doing this for?

870
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:27,551
That attitude will get you fired.

871
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:28,677
You don't get it, man.

872
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:32,347
-This isn't me, I don't really do this.
-Do what?

873
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:35,934
You know, call up people
and pretend to be their dead friend,

874
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:38,979
-you don't understand.
-No, I understand perfectly.

875
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:41,607
You want to buy a ring for a girl
who doesn't want to put

876
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,901
your goddamn name on her Snapperface.

877
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:47,613
Now, oh, and keep it on speakerphone.

878
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:50,157
No more gimmicks, no more lies. Come on.

879
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:54,494
Dial. Wait.

880
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:01,335
-Message from Christine.
-Really?

881
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:06,882
"You are the worst person ever
for not calling me back.

882
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,301
Never call me again.

883
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:13,347
In fact, you can erase my number."

884
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:17,809
Snap, crackle, pop.

885
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:20,187
She said-- She wrote all that?

886
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:24,274
Indeed. I guess Bey-Z 2.0 ended after all.

887
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:27,778
Okay, look.
Keep me locked up. That's fine.

888
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:30,405
I need to text her back,
because if I don't text her back,

889
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:34,034
she'll think something's wrong, and it is,
you're trying to kill me, you know, so...

890
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:38,038
We'll probably just
prolong the inevitable, you know.

891
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:40,999
Seen it all too often,
see how guys like you end up.

892
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:45,504
Alone, nothing but your lies.

893
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,257
Why don't you go ahead and dial?

894
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:50,843
Put a smile on.

895
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:07,276
<i>-Hello?
</i>-Hello, ma'am.

896
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:10,946
I'm calling on behalf
of telemarketers everywhere.

897
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,073
<i>Kasey, is that you?</i>

898
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:15,033
Yes, it is.

899
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:19,705
<i>Your voice sounds different,
but I recognised the number.</i>

900
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:22,291
<i>I never did get my Rick James wig.</i>

901
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:26,587
Mrs. Hanks, hi.

902
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:30,799
Yeah, about that, I am so sorry.

903
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:31,800
<i>Sorry?</i>

904
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:36,096
<i>Young man, I think I owe you an apology
for that video that's been going around.</i>

905
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,516
<i>That granddaughter of mine
is too darn overprotective,</i>

906
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,809
<i>watches me like a hawk.</i>

907
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:44,605
<i>Hell, I'm surprised you were
able to call me on this old line</i>

908
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:47,191
<i>since you put me on that,
what's it called?</i>

909
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:48,734
The do not call list.

910
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:50,402
<i>Yeah, that's the one.</i>

911
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,238
<i>I'm glad you did anyways.</i>

912
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,741
<i>You're helping to keep America safe.</i>

913
00:51:55,824 --> 00:51:59,578
<i>Such a sweet young man.
I was hoping to get a chance to see you.</i>

914
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:02,873
Thank you, you're sweet too.
Listen, I...

915
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:07,794
The reason I'm calling is because I...

916
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:14,426
The reason I'm calling is...

917
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:21,558
Actually, ma'am,
I'm just calling to say hi.

918
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:23,727
<i>Well, thank you, Kasey.</i>

919
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:27,231
Thank you, ma'am.
You have a good night.

920
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:30,526
<i>Well, you have a great night too.
Okay, bye-bye.</i>

921
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:32,569
Bye.

922
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:39,368
Well, ain't that something, Kasey Miller.

923
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:45,123
I have never witnessed
something so genuinely touching.

924
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:48,168
So genuinely heartfelt.

925
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:53,632
And yet somehow so thoroughly disgusting.

926
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:58,637
In all my days, I mean,
taking advantage of a little old lady?

927
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,014
You are some piece of work.

928
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:04,226
I'm hungry, where the hell's the kitchen?

929
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:06,228
In the back.

930
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:09,481
I hope you like Red Vines and Kit Kats.

931
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:10,858
Yeah, whatever.

932
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:13,861
No funny business, I'll be right back.

933
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,154
Can you bring me back a Fresca?

934
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:20,325
Well, there.

935
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:31,545
Fuck.

936
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:37,509
Shit.

937
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:53,066
Fuck.

938
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,861
Fats! They're trying to assassinate me!

939
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:02,951
Found another tool.

940
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:09,249
Wild guess.
You're not the maintenance guy.

941
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,834
Gold star for you.

942
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,419
My dad texted you.

943
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:14,630
Said he was gonna kill you?

944
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:18,050
You didn't text back, that's rude.

945
00:54:18,884 --> 00:54:22,304
-Now you're running off on him?
-Is it too late to text him back now?

946
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:23,931
Oh, yeah, come on.

947
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:24,973
-Okay.
-U-turn.

948
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:27,768
I can hit him back right now.
I'll hit him back right now.

949
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:33,065
I'll send like funny emojis,
I got a few gifs.

950
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:35,400
-Is it gifs or is it jifs?
-The time for that is gone.

951
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:42,866
Now, you shouldn't
have run off like that, Kasey.

952
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,202
Just when I was warming up to you.

953
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:47,412
I see you met my son.

954
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:48,330
Yeah.

955
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:52,251
You said he can get a job here.
Remember that, Phil French?

956
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:54,169
Right.

957
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:56,755
I say we go big on this one, Dad.

958
00:54:57,548 --> 00:55:01,552
Let's take him to the boat.
Gut him like a fish, dump him in the bay.

959
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:03,262
He's a telemarketer.

960
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:06,348
Yeah, maybe that's where we end up at.

961
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:08,016
I don't know.

962
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:12,938
I say we give him
one last chance at redemption.

963
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,566
Redemption?

964
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:18,861
Yes, redemption.
To show us he's learned his lesson.

965
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:21,864
Now, that sounds like
a get out of jail free card.

966
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:24,992
Where was my redemption last month
when I was locked up in county?

967
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:27,327
Remember, parole violation?
You wouldn't bail me out!

968
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,246
No, no, no!

969
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:32,332
You needed to be taught a lesson,
just like Kasey,

970
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,918
and that's what we call deterrence theory.

971
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:40,924
Fear of extreme measures taken to prevent
the reoccurrence of a particular offence.

972
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,635
But if we kill him now,

973
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:46,555
wouldn't that prevent
a recurrence of an offence?

974
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:52,519
Well, yes it would,
but if we take his life,

975
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:54,688
I want to be sure we had no choice.

976
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:57,441
Okay, I'm so sorry about this,

977
00:55:57,524 --> 00:56:00,861
I hate to interrupt such a strong
and warm family moment.

978
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:03,363
However, Dean, if you kill me,

979
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,033
that is in direct violation
of your parole.

980
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,245
-You saying you gonna snitch me out?
-Man, I can't snitch if I'm dead.

981
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:12,706
-Now, son, son, son.
-Okay.

982
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,958
What'd you do that for?

983
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:18,128
You're a fucking hothead
with nothing but bricks for brains.

984
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,755
That's how you got caught.

985
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,757
I got caught
because of that bitch ass snitch!

986
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,759
A snitch you aligned yourself with--

987
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:26,553
Yeah, I aligned this
to his fucking dome, bam!

988
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:30,390
-Allegedly.
-I didn't hear nothing.

989
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:32,100
-Hold the phone.
-That's right.

990
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:33,769
What? What?

991
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:36,188
What's this here, on the Face what's its?

992
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:38,649
-What is it? The Face what's it?
-Who's calling you?

993
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:47,699
<i>Yo, what's up bitches?</i>

994
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:53,664
Drunkards.

995
00:56:54,373 --> 00:56:56,083
-Drunkards.
-And naked womens.

996
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,751
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

997
00:56:57,835 --> 00:56:59,878
-That's a labia, right there.
<i>-Where are you?</i>

998
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:01,338
Yeah, that's definitely a labia.

999
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,424
<i>-Barry wants an encore!
-Oh, no.</i>

1000
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,553
<i>I'm practically engaged.</i>

1001
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:11,723
He leads a Sunday School choir
when he's not at the strip club

1002
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,517
and slapping them cheeks.

1003
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,686
<i>Come back when you're practically married.</i>

1004
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:19,731
<i>-Yeah!
-Yeah!</i>

1005
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:22,025
That brings back some memories.

1006
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:24,570
Yeah, you mean the time you was banned?

1007
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:27,739
Come on, like I'm the first guy to use
a counterfeit 20 for a lap dance?

1008
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:29,616
That's actually pretty genius.

1009
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,743
-Yeah, you like that?
-Enough!

1010
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:35,664
Keep your eye on him,
my blood sugar's going to shit.

1011
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:36,582
Pretty good.

1012
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:41,753
Let me ask you. Are you up to speed
with what your dad's doing?

1013
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:43,297
-Totally.
-Really?

1014
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,383
Because all of this for a damn apology
seems a bit much, right?

1015
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,510
-I can hear you.
-Shit.

1016
00:57:48,594 --> 00:57:50,095
I suggest you make calls.

1017
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:54,099
-Dad, how long am I supposed to give him?
-30 minutes!

1018
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:56,977
So better start dialling.

1019
00:57:57,644 --> 00:58:00,314
My hands are tied, literally, so...

1020
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:04,193
Just one hand.

1021
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:07,988
-Don't try anything.
-I won't, I just... Come on.

1022
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:09,907
All right. Jesus.

1023
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:11,783
Son of a bitch.

1024
00:58:12,743 --> 00:58:14,953
Okay, now cut the other one loose.

1025
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:17,581
-No? All right, that's fair.
-You think I'm stupid?

1026
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:19,458
Is that a trick question?

1027
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:25,172
I'm so-- It's really hard.

1028
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:28,425
-As you can see, this is such...
-Yeah, you have to figure it out.

1029
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:31,929
You're supposed to be good at this.

1030
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:33,639
There we go, let me just...

1031
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:36,642
-There you go, perfect.
-You're making this complicated for us.

1032
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:38,936
-You look good though.
-Thank you.

1033
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:42,105
That gun is making me
very nervous, man, I'm just saying.

1034
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:45,651
-Dial faster. Go.
-Okay.

1035
00:58:57,496 --> 00:58:59,998
My pops really knows how to hold a grudge.

1036
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:01,291
I'm right there with you.

1037
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,545
-I survived my dad, and phew, yeah.
-He a hard ass?

1038
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:06,171
Oh, you have no idea.

1039
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:10,676
You know, he started out as a prosecutor,
and now he's a judge, you know.

1040
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:13,303
If I even blink in the wrong direction,
I'm sweating bullets.

1041
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:15,013
-No shit?
-No shit.

1042
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:16,932
And he wants you
to follow in his footsteps?

1043
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:19,560
Well, I don't think
I'd do too well in court.

1044
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:21,478
Neither would I.

1045
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:24,898
Yeah, I didn't.

1046
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:27,484
-I know. You've made some mistakes.
-Yeah.

1047
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:29,528
-Just a couple.
-Yeah.

1048
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:32,281
You know, for me,
telemarketing is just a job.

1049
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:36,618
I'm good at it, so... Law school
didn't work out, and now here I am.

1050
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:38,829
You know, look, I get it.

1051
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:42,875
You got a job to do here.
So I'm willing to bet

1052
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:49,381
that we can overlook all of your
past transgressions, all the felonies,

1053
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:50,966
the murders,

1054
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:55,220
the rapes probably I'm assuming,
the kidnaps, things like that.

1055
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,181
-You know what I'm saying?
-I don't know.

1056
00:59:57,264 --> 01:00:00,100
Yeah, me either.
Hell, you can be an axe murderer.

1057
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:02,561
As long as you can sell, you're hired.

1058
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:05,606
Shit, I'll help you hide the axe.
What axe?

1059
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:08,400
I know. I ain't seen shit.

1060
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:09,860
You are good.

1061
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:12,613
And I'm no salesman.

1062
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,949
You sure ain't the maintenance,
but you could've fooled me.

1063
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,660
I hate telemarketers.

1064
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,246
-I want to kill telemarketers.
-Is that right?

1065
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,958
If I was a telemarketer,
I'd have to kill myself.

1066
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:28,337
And I don't want to kill myself. Not yet.

1067
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,048
When the time comes.

1068
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:34,259
-You'll be ready. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1069
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:47,648
You know I was this close to becoming
top salesman of the month tonight?

1070
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:48,565
This close.

1071
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:51,693
And I was gonna take
my girl out and celebrate,

1072
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:55,572
and pretend to like salmon
as much as I like steak,

1073
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:58,158
and she would call me out
because she's the only one

1074
01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:00,244
that can see through my bullshit.

1075
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:05,415
Then we'd laugh, and then I'd propose.

1076
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:08,377
Does she know?

1077
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,632
Kasey, if you just told my dad the truth,
he would've bought the stupid triple play.

1078
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:15,759
He's a romantic at heart.

1079
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:23,934
He would've understood.

1080
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:26,854
She would've gotten that ring,
you would've gotten that bonus,

1081
01:01:26,937 --> 01:01:29,898
and dad would've cancelled after a month,
so everybody would've won.

1082
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:33,026
Woulda, shoulda, coulda.

1083
01:01:35,237 --> 01:01:36,572
You got a picture of that lady?

1084
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:39,408
Yeah, actually on my phone.

1085
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,244
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1086
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:45,247
-You better do that.
-Be careful, now.

1087
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:48,959
One look at her, premature ejaculation.

1088
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:51,461
-It happens to me all the time.
-Let's put it to the test.

1089
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:53,630
Oh, Kasey.

1090
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,842
-She's a hottie.
-Yes, sir.

1091
01:01:56,925 --> 01:01:59,678
-You need a towel?
-Yeah, in a couple minutes.

1092
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,514
You love her?

1093
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:04,308
More than anything.

1094
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:06,101
You know what?

1095
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:11,148
I'm gonna show this to my dad,
and talk to him about this.

1096
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:12,524
You serious?

1097
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:13,942
Yeah, he loved my mom.

1098
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:16,028
He might understand this.

1099
01:02:16,111 --> 01:02:18,780
-Fuck, man, that would be great.
-Your little love story.

1100
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:20,449
-Oh, come on. This is great.
-Yeah.

1101
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:21,366
Great, yeah.

1102
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:25,662
Just gotta promise me one thing.
Don't try and escape.

1103
01:02:25,746 --> 01:02:26,997
Really?

1104
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,668
How about this.
There's a headset, right over there.

1105
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:35,506
Grab that, I'll still make calls,
you can listen the whole time.

1106
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:37,132
-This one?
-That right there.

1107
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:39,384
That's the only one there,
so it had to be that one.

1108
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,806
Oh, my God.
When did Superman become a telemarketer?

1109
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,433
Damn it, you look natural.

1110
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:48,143
You look good.

1111
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:49,561
-Right.
-This is your desk here.

1112
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:51,730
-I'm gonna go talk to my dad.
-Talk to your daddy.

1113
01:02:52,773 --> 01:02:53,941
Talk to that motherfucker.

1114
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:56,485
Fuck being a telemarketer,
you're about to be a model, huh?

1115
01:02:57,528 --> 01:02:58,362
Pops.

1116
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:00,572
Check this out.

1117
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:02,241
That's his girlfriend.

1118
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:04,743
What are you doing
with his goddamn phone?

1119
01:03:04,826 --> 01:03:05,869
He gave it to me.

1120
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:11,542
Looking all good.

1121
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:16,505
I don't know who I like more,
my girl or you, you pretty motherfucker.

1122
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:20,759
Blue eyes, looking all coloniser and shit.

1123
01:03:21,844 --> 01:03:23,053
Oh, shit.

1124
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,141
Yeah, there's more.

1125
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:30,561
Hold on.

1126
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:32,896
-Hey!
-Yeah?

1127
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,189
-Keep dialling!
-Yeah!

1128
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:36,358
-Work the phones, Kasey!
-Gotcha!

1129
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:39,987
Just out here trying to save my life, man!

1130
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:43,574
Y'all know how it is.
It's a Thursday for y'all, you know.

1131
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:51,707
<i>-Hello?
</i>-Good evening, Mr. Wilson.

1132
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:53,166
<i>Who is this?</i>

1133
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:58,964
Sir, you don't know me,
but I work for TeleWin.

1134
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:00,424
<i>Are you a telemarketer?</i>

1135
01:04:00,966 --> 01:04:02,009
Yes, sir, I am.

1136
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:06,263
I am. But, I know it's late,
but please don't hang up.

1137
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:09,057
Now first, I just want to say I'm sorry

1138
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:12,978
for my conduct
on behalf of all the telemarketers.

1139
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:14,521
I might get a photo.

1140
01:04:17,482 --> 01:04:20,068
-Mr. Wilson?
<i>-Is this some kind of a joke?</i>

1141
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:22,779
No, sir, I assure you, this is no joke.

1142
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:25,073
In fact, I'm not trying
to sell you anything.

1143
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,826
-Get one with me in it.
-Okay, yeah.

1144
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:32,247
Sir, I've been a shit person, okay?

1145
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:36,335
Now, I ask that you
please accept my apology.

1146
01:04:37,044 --> 01:04:37,878
Please.

1147
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:40,589
I swear, if I ever dropped
a fake 20 on a lap dance with her,

1148
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:43,509
you have permission to shoot me. What?

1149
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:46,512
You shouldn't be
dropping fake 20s on no one.

1150
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:48,096
<i>You gotta be shitting me.</i>

1151
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:49,848
No, sir, I'm not shitting you, I'm not.

1152
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:51,683
<i>You're not shitting me.</i>

1153
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:54,686
<i>Okay, I guess.</i>

1154
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:58,273
Okay? I'm so sorry, sir,
can you please repeat that?

1155
01:04:58,357 --> 01:04:59,816
<i>Are you deaf? I just said okay.</i>

1156
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,903
Yes! Yes, you hear that?

1157
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,404
He said okay!

1158
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:05,322
He said okay!

1159
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:06,490
Fuck, yes, sir.

1160
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:09,117
<i>-What the hell is going on here?
</i>-Thank you.

1161
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:10,410
God bless you, sir.

1162
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:12,538
God bless your kids,
God bless your grandkids.

1163
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:16,333
Even if they have fucking weird names
like Sunflower and Woody,

1164
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:19,628
or some bullshit like that. Thank you!

1165
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:20,963
Suck my dick!

1166
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:27,928
-They don't call me the king for nothing.
-What?

1167
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:30,973
"What?" The fuck you mean what?

1168
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:32,349
You were listening.

1169
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:34,476
I didn't hear anything.

1170
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,521
On the fucking-- I gave you the headset!

1171
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:39,857
I didn't hear a damn thing!
Are you calling me a liar?

1172
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:43,068
No, well, fuck it, give it to me.

1173
01:05:43,944 --> 01:05:45,487
What do you mean you didn't hear it?

1174
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:50,492
You didn't turn it on, man.

1175
01:05:51,493 --> 01:05:52,494
I fucking had it.

1176
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:57,958
I fucking had it, man! I fucking had it!

1177
01:05:59,126 --> 01:05:59,960
Well...

1178
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:04,381
I mean, if an apology's made in the forest
and there's no one to hear it,

1179
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:06,925
-then...
-We're not in the forest, pops.

1180
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:09,887
I'll explain it to you later, son.

1181
01:06:11,722 --> 01:06:13,265
Go on, do another.

1182
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:18,770
Oh, now, don't tell me you's a quitter.

1183
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:24,401
Where's that relentless bravado,
that mighty perseverance?

1184
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:27,571
I have no idea, man, out to lunch.

1185
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:29,364
Fucking gone.

1186
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:34,286
Come on, now.

1187
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:35,746
Fuck.

1188
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:37,164
Dean likes you.

1189
01:06:38,498 --> 01:06:40,709
I want you to make a good impression.

1190
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:42,753
Now, go on, give it another go.

1191
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:50,010
I'm gonna be paying
for that stripper's dry cleaning.

1192
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:53,931
And the $150 room bill,
but you know, happens to the best of us.

1193
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:57,935
What the hell, Kasey?

1194
01:06:58,018 --> 01:07:02,231
What in the H-E double hockey sticks
are you still doing here, buddy?

1195
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:03,398
Barry, Christine.

1196
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:06,985
It's so good to see you both. What's up?

1197
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:12,407
What's up is,
I met this sweet little tenderoni outside.

1198
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:15,077
At the strip club?

1199
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,662
-Yeah.
-No.

1200
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:17,663
Outside.

1201
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:20,457
You bailed on dinner, and didn't text me.

1202
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:21,667
It's not like you.

1203
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,878
Oh, you know,
I've just kind of been tied up.

1204
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:29,967
Oh, well, I would say you left her hanging
like an iguana in the Sahara Desert.

1205
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:30,884
No.

1206
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:34,680
Okay, well, you're not dead or cheating.

1207
01:07:34,763 --> 01:07:36,890
So, what's up?

1208
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:43,438
Barry, man, what are you doing here?
You should probably go.

1209
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:49,236
-I want you to have this.
-Barry, come on, bro.

1210
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:50,904
-Barry.
-No, no, listen.

1211
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:53,407
It's only right, okay?

1212
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,617
I came all the way here,

1213
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,870
and I was gonna put
a nice little sticky note on it.

1214
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:04,918
But here you are. So, I mean, I guess
the surprise factor is kind of kaput.

1215
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:08,714
Yeah, I guess you can say
I'm done with surprises for tonight.

1216
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,883
-Aren't we all?
-Babe, I messed up.

1217
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:13,135
I came to work today,
I'll catch up on some sales,

1218
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,888
and then I guess
I got caught up, I messed up.

1219
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:16,971
As usual.

1220
01:08:19,015 --> 01:08:20,475
Baby, you should go.

1221
01:08:20,559 --> 01:08:24,270
You know, this ain't for me anymore,
I'm an asshole, so...

1222
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:25,606
No, you're not an asshole.

1223
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:28,317
You treat everything in your life
like it's a sale to be made,

1224
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,738
which is really fucking annoying.
But you always call, okay?

1225
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:35,157
That's what I love about you,
you always call.

1226
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:52,466
Okay, we're gonna go. Yeah.

1227
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:56,178
-No. Barry, let's go.
-Wait, no.

1228
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:57,845
I want to leave this for the guru.

1229
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,015
Barry, we need to go. Barry!

1230
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:03,018
Hey. Hey, don't you
fucking touch her, man!

1231
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,062
-Oh, my God!
-Hey!

1232
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:10,234
Asa. Hey, hey.
This is going way too far, man.

1233
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:14,279
Oh, says the man who spews bullshit
all day to innocent people.

1234
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:17,991
The man who pretends to be my dead friend
in order to sell a triple play!

1235
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:20,202
Yeah, sure, Asa.

1236
01:09:20,285 --> 01:09:24,206
I pretended to be
your dead friend to make a sale.

1237
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:27,125
Have you never been lied to before?

1238
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:29,670
Let me ask you something, Asa.

1239
01:09:29,752 --> 01:09:32,840
You remember watching
TV commercials as a kid, right?

1240
01:09:33,631 --> 01:09:37,301
You don't think they lied
to get you to buy the toy you wanted?

1241
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:41,430
You get home,
and you get your Rock'em Sock'em Robot

1242
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:43,100
or whatever it is, fresh out the box.

1243
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:45,727
And you look at it,
and it don't quite look,

1244
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:49,564
or feel, or work the way it does on TV.

1245
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:53,694
I'm pretty sure you didn't go
to Mattel headquarters with a .44

1246
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:55,404
and light up the customer service rep.

1247
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:57,990
How about a little perspective here, Asa?

1248
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:01,994
This is the free market at work, man!
This is what our country was founded on!

1249
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:05,455
-Damn it, this is America!
-Sit the fuck down.

1250
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:11,879
Just so I'm clear,
this is over some silly sales call?

1251
01:10:11,962 --> 01:10:15,132
-Shut up.
-A silly sales call?

1252
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,718
I don't think so.

1253
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:20,470
I think we have some idea, Asa.

1254
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:22,848
Your wife used to get
called by telemarketers,

1255
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:25,559
and then you two would fight about it,
and it made you mad.

1256
01:10:29,146 --> 01:10:30,981
My wife died because of it.

1257
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:34,568
I told her...

1258
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:38,989
Don't ever talk and drive.
But she wouldn't listen.

1259
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:43,452
The last call she ever took
was from one of you guys.

1260
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:47,122
She lost control of the wheel.

1261
01:10:48,832 --> 01:10:50,584
When some asshole like you...

1262
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:55,005
was selling her car insurance!

1263
01:10:57,758 --> 01:11:02,346
I asked the FDC
to put me on the do not call list

1264
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:03,889
out of respect for her memory.

1265
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:05,557
-Right, son?
-That's right.

1266
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:09,311
You know, the head of the agency,

1267
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:14,441
the woman appointed by the goddamn
president of the United States,

1268
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:16,026
she called me personally.

1269
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:21,031
Personally, she swore to me,
up and down, left and right.

1270
01:11:22,241 --> 01:11:25,953
"They will never call you again.
Not once, not twice, not ever."

1271
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:32,876
Guess I shoulda known better.

1272
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,753
Shouldn't have used
that DNC list, asshole.

1273
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:40,968
Dang it.

1274
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:44,054
Must've dozed off there.

1275
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:45,931
Oh, my God, I've never had to shit so bad.

1276
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:52,604
Wait. Did I miss something?

1277
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:57,568
-Quite a lot. Join our discussion.
-What's going on?

1278
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:00,988
You two work together, right?

1279
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:03,574
-Yeah.
-Know why he's here?

1280
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:08,495
I figured he stayed behind
to try to make another call.

1281
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:09,788
And if he made it,

1282
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:13,041
he would report it
to corporate claiming...

1283
01:12:14,835 --> 01:12:17,421
-he won the $3,000.
-Bingo.

1284
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:21,091
Must make your blood boil, right?

1285
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:25,179
-No.
-No?

1286
01:12:26,597 --> 01:12:31,185
No. Actually, I feel relieved.

1287
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:35,564
I don't feel so bad about
switching his call sheet with Justin's.

1288
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:39,026
You did what?

1289
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:42,654
Hold on. So let me get this straight.

1290
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:46,116
You cheat, and then all this happens?

1291
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:49,536
You have no idea
what I've been through today!

1292
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:54,333
Law of the land. Remember?
All I did was level the playing field.

1293
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:58,795
And you have no position to be
calling anybody in here unethical

1294
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:02,007
when you're the one who got kicked out
of USC's law school for cheating.

1295
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:04,301
Oh, my God,
I've been wanting to say that all day.

1296
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:05,886
Oh, my God.

1297
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:08,639
Say it isn't so.

1298
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:11,725
I mean, he's drunk.

1299
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:13,435
I know all about it, okay?

1300
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:16,647
Your assistant dean, she told me about it.
We're in the same church choir.

1301
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,565
And the church says amen.

1302
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:22,194
-You told me you dropped out.
-Baby, I'm-- Thank you.

1303
01:13:22,986 --> 01:13:24,279
Thank you very much, Barry.

1304
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:27,741
Kasey, your buddy just sold you out.

1305
01:13:29,326 --> 01:13:31,245
-Hey, pops.
-Yeah, son?

1306
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:33,872
What were you telling me about deterrence?

1307
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:35,541
Deterrence theory.

1308
01:13:35,624 --> 01:13:37,042
Deterrence theory, yeah.

1309
01:13:38,418 --> 01:13:41,505
Barry, I learned something today.

1310
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:46,176
The use of extreme actions to prevent
the reoccurrence of a specific action.

1311
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,262
-Spot-on, son.
-Yeah.

1312
01:13:48,762 --> 01:13:52,099
Kasey, do you know the one thing
I detest more than telemarketers?

1313
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:54,768
A snitch?

1314
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:57,396
Gold star for you.

1315
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:00,983
Fuck me!

1316
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:02,609
What the fuck, man!

1317
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:04,570
Oh, my God!

1318
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:08,240
You know, that's a clean hole.

1319
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:13,078
Would you go clean that up for us?

1320
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,122
-Me?
-Yes, please.

1321
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,584
Go on over. Go on, clean it up.

1322
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:23,046
Grab the...

1323
01:14:23,964 --> 01:14:24,965
Yeah, grab the...

1324
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:32,431
How long do you think he's got?

1325
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:36,560
I don't know. I mean, I'm trying to be
a psychologist, not a doctor.

1326
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:40,189
-Put your hands on it. Yeah.
-Isn't this perfect?

1327
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:43,358
Now, his life is in your hands.

1328
01:14:43,442 --> 01:14:46,695
Okay, look,
just let Barry and Christine go. Okay?

1329
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:50,532
You can lock me in your basement,
give me your phone.

1330
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:53,285
I'll make as many calls as you want,
apologise to as many people

1331
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:57,664
-as you want for the rest of my life.
-Now, that would be going too far.

1332
01:14:57,748 --> 01:15:02,044
I mean, plus the train set's down there,
and Dean's man cave.

1333
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:05,422
-Yeah.
-All we need is one apology accepted.

1334
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:09,051
Here, now, for all to hear. Now, come on.

1335
01:15:10,093 --> 01:15:13,430
Go on, just get your do not call list,

1336
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:18,602
and you best get to dialling
before you all get clocked out.

1337
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:20,062
Okay.

1338
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:23,482
Seeing as how this
could potentially be my very last call...

1339
01:15:25,317 --> 01:15:27,986
-I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.
-No.

1340
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:31,865
Hey, now.
It's my pre last call ritual, you know.

1341
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:34,493
Every time I make my final call,

1342
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:40,457
I need to have one cup of coffee
from my signature toilet bowl mug.

1343
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,001
Ain't that right, rookie?

1344
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:45,087
Yeah, as long as I've been here.

1345
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:47,005
-Oh, Christ.
-Stop.

1346
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:48,340
Jesus Christ.

1347
01:15:48,423 --> 01:15:49,258
Yeah.

1348
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:52,803
Why don't you get the fucking coffee?

1349
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:57,558
You don't strike me as someone
who would drink out of the toilet.

1350
01:15:58,267 --> 01:16:00,435
I mean, he's full of shit, so...

1351
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:03,647
You know, I tried it once,
sold a triple play,

1352
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,607
so I'm not one to argue with success.

1353
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:09,987
Here's your goddamn coffee.
Go ahead, take your ritualistic sip.

1354
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:15,909
This here is your last call.

1355
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:21,665
If this doesn't work, you're going
on a boat ride with me and Dean.

1356
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:24,168
Dial.

1357
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:43,270
<i>Yes?</i>

1358
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:46,064
Hello, sir, it's Kasey.

1359
01:16:48,358 --> 01:16:49,234
<i>Yes, Kasey?</i>

1360
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:52,321
It's late, I'm surprised you're still up.

1361
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:56,450
<i>-Just reading some motions.
</i>-Of course you are.

1362
01:16:58,744 --> 01:16:59,745
<i>Did you need something?</i>

1363
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:03,415
Yeah, I was just...

1364
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:06,752
You know, I've been...

1365
01:17:08,045 --> 01:17:10,547
just been meaning
to talk to you, you know.

1366
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:13,884
<i>I already got Internet, thank you.</i>

1367
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,011
Okay, yeah, I guess I deserve that.

1368
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:20,641
But no, there's something I've been
meaning to speak with you about.

1369
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:23,602
<i>I got cable and phone too.</i>

1370
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:26,730
I'm not... Look, sir, I'm not selling.

1371
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:28,815
<i>I didn't know that was possible.</i>

1372
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:33,654
Sir, please, I just wanted to apologise.

1373
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:37,741
<i>-I didn't know that was possible either.
</i>-Come on.

1374
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:40,994
<i>Go on, I'm listening.</i>

1375
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:42,621
I just wanted to say...

1376
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:47,042
I'm sorry.

1377
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:51,296
I'm sorry for this dirty business I'm in.

1378
01:17:52,965 --> 01:17:55,175
And the pain it must cause people.

1379
01:17:57,135 --> 01:17:58,136
And that includes you.

1380
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:01,682
I guess when you think about it, I just,

1381
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:04,226
was never really good
at anything, you know?

1382
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,689
Sports, school, none of it.

1383
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:12,234
But here, I'm good.

1384
01:18:13,277 --> 01:18:14,695
I'm real good, you know?

1385
01:18:15,946 --> 01:18:17,197
I can do what I want,

1386
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:20,409
can come and go as I please,
and nobody calls me out on it.

1387
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:23,287
Almost no one.

1388
01:18:24,538 --> 01:18:26,498
Compared to law school,
this place is amazing.

1389
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:28,375
You see, in class...

1390
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:32,379
In class I would just lie
and cheat my way through everything.

1391
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:36,508
And it worked for a little while,
but then you get kicked out.

1392
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:39,970
And then you end up here.

1393
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:46,351
You see, here I can meet people,

1394
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:48,979
I get to know them,

1395
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:52,900
and right when I got them
where I want them, I sell them.

1396
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:55,736
And I sell them, and I sell them.

1397
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,988
The bullshit works.

1398
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:01,074
It works here.
In fact, they encourage it, you know?

1399
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:02,868
So much so that corporate, you know,

1400
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:05,120
corporate is starting
to call it the Kasey Method.

1401
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:06,205
Can you believe that?

1402
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:09,082
They named something after me,
the Kasey Method.

1403
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,962
I lie and I cheat people,
and they pat me on the back for it.

1404
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:17,049
I don't like me because of it.

1405
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:21,553
And I know
I'm not the man you want me to be,

1406
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:24,890
I didn't go down the path
you wanted me to go down.

1407
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:30,354
For that, I'm sorry.

1408
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,190
I truly am, I am very sorry.

1409
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:38,153
So...

1410
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:40,989
what do you say?

1411
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:46,078
Do you accept my apology, Dad?

1412
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:54,795
Oh, and there's somebody
I would really like for you to meet.

1413
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:57,714
So, depending on your answer,
I think we should all hang out.

1414
01:19:57,798 --> 01:19:59,633
I think you would
really like her, you know?

1415
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:09,268
<i>You know, son,
I'm really happy you called.</i>

1416
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:13,105
<i>Of course I forgive you.</i>

1417
01:20:22,614 --> 01:20:23,448
No!

1418
01:20:43,635 --> 01:20:45,762
Baby, call 911. Call 911, right now!

1419
01:20:45,846 --> 01:20:47,472
No!

1420
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:49,183
I'm not going back to jail!

1421
01:20:50,142 --> 01:20:51,643
Shut up, you goddamn...

1422
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:56,607
-Thanks for the mug, rookie.
-I try.

1423
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,693
Since we're in apologies mode,

1424
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:02,029
I'm sorry there's a hole
in your leg right now.

1425
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,116
It's not your fault, it's his.

1426
01:21:07,492 --> 01:21:09,703
Oh, no, please, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

1427
01:21:11,705 --> 01:21:12,664
Oh, shit!

1428
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:15,667
Apology accepted.

1429
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,924
Baby, I'm sorry I'm an asshole.
I'm sorry I stood you up, you know?

1430
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:23,967
-I'm sorry.
-We can do this later.

1431
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:26,845
Apologies all around.
Everybody gets an apology.

1432
01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:30,474
I too am sorry for not
shooting you in the goddamn head

1433
01:21:30,557 --> 01:21:33,018
when I first laid eyes on you.

1434
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:38,273
Hold this.

1435
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:42,528
Asa.

1436
01:21:43,987 --> 01:21:45,572
I know you got a raw deal.

1437
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:47,699
Losing the love of your life,

1438
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:51,662
and how that must be
affecting you and Dean.

1439
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:55,791
I'm not gonna pretend to imagine
what that must feel like.

1440
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:57,918
And if I could go back in time,

1441
01:21:58,001 --> 01:22:00,546
I would really change
your circumstance, man, I really would.

1442
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:04,508
I'm sad about your wife, Asa,

1443
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:08,804
and the role this fucked-up
telemarketing culture played in it.

1444
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:13,767
Damn it, Asa, I'm sorry, man. I really am.

1445
01:22:16,144 --> 01:22:17,271
Kasey Miller.

1446
01:22:18,355 --> 01:22:20,357
That's all I ever wanted from you.

1447
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:26,196
Was for you to take a good,
deep, long look at yourself.

1448
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:29,950
I know it wasn't easy.

1449
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:33,453
I'm proud of you.

1450
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:37,165
I'm gonna accept your apology.

1451
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,042
I do.

1452
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:44,131
It still wasn't on the phone though.

1453
01:22:45,716 --> 01:22:48,218
-You've got to be kidding me.
-Come on, I'm dying over here.

1454
01:22:48,302 --> 01:22:50,846
-Let's get you taken care of.
-Take this, I don't want this.

1455
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:51,972
-You sure?
-Yes.

1456
01:22:52,055 --> 01:22:54,725
-Because I can kill them right now.
-What? No.

1457
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:57,102
I'm just saying,
he's been talking so much shit.

1458
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:13,285
That's a pretty house.

1459
01:23:15,287 --> 01:23:16,121
Are you okay?

1460
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:20,459
No, I'm good. I just...

1461
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:22,836
I just...

1462
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:26,215
It doesn't feel right, you know?

1463
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:30,427
-Yeah, but you wanted to do this.
-No, I do, I just...

1464
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:33,889
I can't help but feel silly.

1465
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:37,017
But you'll feel better.

1466
01:23:39,269 --> 01:23:41,605
And besides, silly is your middle name.

1467
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,106
Silly is my middle name.

1468
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:46,151
So wise.

1469
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:49,696
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1470
01:24:13,345 --> 01:24:14,179
Mrs. Hanks!

1471
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,557
Bring your ass outside!
