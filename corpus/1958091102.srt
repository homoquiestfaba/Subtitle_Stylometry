1
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,112
My name is Jimi,
and I'm 21 years old.

2
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,615
And there you have it,
the answers to my two

3
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,825
most frequently
asked questions.

4
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:17,534
Number one--

5
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,493
Jenny?

6
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,579
Jimi, as in Hendrix.

7
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,538
And number two--

8
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,914
How old are you?

9
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,374
Here's what I want to say--

10
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,210
I'm nine.

11
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,920
Child labor laws.

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,339
Instead, I just laugh
it off and say,

13
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,091
Oh I'm actually 21.

14
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,259
I'm 21.

15
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,095
Maybe I look younger
because I'm 5 foot 1,

16
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,931
or because I ride a bike,
and don't drive a car.

17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,644
Or could be that I don't wear
much makeup, I don't know.

18
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:48,231
Truth is I'm an old soul,
and I think that counts.

19
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,234
I love quality and authenticity.

20
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:55,155
I work at a thrift store
aptly named Second Chances.

21
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,074
See, I even use grownup
words like aptly.

22
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,912
Every day I'm surrounded by all
of these beautiful authentic

23
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,665
items, and they
all have a story.

24
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,042
And this may sound
silly, but I actually

25
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,545
belive each item has
a little bit of hope,

26
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,797
that they'll get
another chapter.

27
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,924
And that we have in common.

28
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,615
You're never going to
believe what I found.

29
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,200
Who sold us this bag?

30
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,493
That bag?

31
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,454
The one that's perfect for me.

32
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,248
Is that a ransom note?

33
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,333
Right up your alley Junie Mae.

34
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,586
The woman who wrote it never
gave it to her boyfriend,

35
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,545
so they broke up.

36
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,296
And he doesn't know that she
didn't actually cheat on him,

37
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,007
it was just some guy friend
that he saw her with.

38
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,800
So we need to find him
and give this to him

39
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,093
so they can get back together.

40
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,887
Why didn't she give it
to him, or tell him?

41
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,890
Why can't people
just communicate?

42
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,559
Well, I can save you the time.

43
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,435
Her name is Liz Brewer.

44
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,689
And her ex, who also sold
us some of that stuff right

45
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,400
over there, is Steve Wade.

46
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:03,033
Hey guys, can I help
you find anything?

47
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,703
No, we're just looking around.

48
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:18,256
She hated to keep that
bag, he gave it to her.

49
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,383
Well, she should have it back,
and they should be together.

50
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,385
I mean, simple
solution, communicate.

51
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,974
Oh, Aiden.

52
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,977
Yeah, I checked on
that Game Boy for you.

53
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,313
You know it, nothing's
come in yet.

54
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,397
Okay.

55
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,440
Hi, Aiden.

56
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,441
Yeah.

57
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,985
Oh Jimi, this is Aiden

58
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,780
Yeah, he's on the lookout
for an old school Game Boy.

59
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,073
Oh fun.

60
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,407
It's nice to meet you Jenny.

61
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,536
Oh, it's Jimi, like Hendrix.

62
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,830
My grandparents, Woodstock.

63
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:53,041
Woodstock, wow.

64
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,668
Um, you know, we'll
definitely be in touch.

65
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,128
We, we could text you too.

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,089
You just put your
cell number down there

67
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,674
with all your other info.

68
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,884
Write down your
street address on there

69
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,053
and we'll ship it
straight to you.

70
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,974
Or just drop in when
you're in the neighborhood.

71
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,642
Thank you Miss Davis.

72
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,811
Uh, that's Junie May to you.

73
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,770
Got it.

74
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,522
So nice to meet you Jimi.

75
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:15,899
Same.

76
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,250
Not a good communicator.

77
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,067
Hi, just one?

78
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,151
Um, oh, hey.

79
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:43,777
Hey, what's up?

80
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:44,611
Hi.

81
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,032
I'll just --thank you.

82
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,913
No, I'm not stalking you.

83
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,998
Okay, just let me know when
you're ready to order.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,585
Thank you.

85
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,713
I was um, riding home
and I was so hungry.

86
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:06,552
Yeah, the uh, food
here is good.

87
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,973
So um, how's life on campus?

88
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:13,890
Um, it's pretty good.

89
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,768
I'm meeting a lot
of new people.

90
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,144
Anyone interesting?

91
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,607
Yeah, I mean, I got
a new roommate,

92
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:22,818
my campus housing site.

93
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,901
Oh cool, yeah.

94
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,737
I met you.

95
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,989
Okay, ready to order?

96
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:33,034
Uh, yes. Um, I, I will have
the chicken salad with ranch

97
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,119
on the side please.

98
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:34,786
Thank you.

99
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,632
Well, it doesn't have to be.

100
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:51,905
It's back, the pioneer days at
Second Chances thrift store.

101
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:56,494
Oh-hoh, pioneer days
at Second Chances.

102
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,456
Howdy.

103
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,667
What you doing Boomer?

104
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,711
It's called marketing.

105
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:11,592
And this is Sara, our
new marketing intern.

106
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:12,300
Howdy.

107
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,427
Hello Sara.

108
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,429
Well, I'll meet you
guys inside.

109
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:21,810
I'll go get ready
for the stampede.

110
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:25,396
Howdy, all our tacky
stuff, 80% off.

111
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,940
No, 20% off.

112
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,610
20% off.

113
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:33,614
Should I go rescue
the new girl?

114
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:37,283
Do you want him in here?

115
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,244
I finished season 3 last night.

116
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,872
Ooh, I told you
it was addicting.

117
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,582
Yeah.

118
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,876
I'm going to hold on to the
DVD player a little longer.

119
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,378
Oh, well, just make
sure you bring it back

120
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,796
before we sell out.

121
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,425
I'm thinking of
becoming a profiler.

122
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,972
Wow, they started a new
semester down at the college.

123
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,181
Yeah, no.

124
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:05,228
Or, or you could use all of
those as semester class.

125
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,649
Or maybe I can find a way to
get these guys back together.

126
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:11,317
Ooh, you don't want
to be a profiler,

127
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,779
you want to be a
little matchmaker.

128
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,031
It's kind of the same thing.

129
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,366
I mean, they're
already a match,

130
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,576
if they just
communicated then

131
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,702
they'd still be together.

132
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,789
Maybe they just
need a little nudge.

133
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,292
You know my favorite
episode?

134
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:31,630
Season 4, episode 6.

135
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,465
Thank you.

136
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,303
Why, yes ma'am.

137
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:42,599
We do have a limited
selection of Barry Manilow.

138
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,019
Marketing.

139
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,981
I will keep him on track,

140
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,360
he just needs a
little direction.

141
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,653
God, you're an angel.

142
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,737
An angel.

143
00:10:55,739 --> 00:11:02,202
I told him there is
no "The" in Twitter.

144
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,080
Straight from heaven.

145
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:09,375
Does he know about TikTok?

146
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,045
He doesn't.

147
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,926
He won't.

148
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,597
He must never know.

149
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,654
You catch more
flies with honey.

150
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,824
You're on a dating app?

151
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:41,825
No.

152
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,661
Then how do you know
about this stuff?

153
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm a detective.

154
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,125
No, no Boomer, that's it.

155
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,169
Let me see these.

156
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,339
That's a lot on a
single piece of paper.

157
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,465
Like I'm getting dizzy.

158
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,969
You didn't even
finish this one.

159
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,849
Just not photogenic.

160
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,393
Is that makeup?

161
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,144
I mean

162
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,983
Mascara, eye shadow?

163
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,443
Who are those for?

164
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:40,904
No one.

165
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,408
I watched that episode that
you told me about, so good.

166
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,579
The one where they set
up the fake dating app.

167
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:51,204
Yeah.

168
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:55,876
Yeah, and then you take
selfies, with makeup.

169
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,172
Hey Miss Davis, hi Jimi.

170
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,341
You better start
calling me Junie Mae.

171
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,760
Yes ma'am, Junie Mae.

172
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,595
I, I'm going to check
on that Game Boy.

173
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:15,521
Hey Aiden.

174
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:16,187
Hey.

175
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,106
I saw your car outside.

176
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:18,857
Yeah.

177
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,110
Wait, you parked
outside again?

178
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,028
Yeah.

179
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,990
Um, this is Jimi,
and Junie Mae.

180
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,117
Sara.

181
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,577
Nice to meet you.

182
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,204
Junie Mae, Sara, Jenny.

183
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,956
It's Jimi.

184
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,084
Oh, like a boy's name?

185
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:42,213
Her, her grandparents,
they live at Woodstock.

186
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,381
Fun story.

187
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,216
So I'm Wren.

188
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,428
Oh, like psychotic chihuahua?

189
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,306
No, like the bird.

190
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:57,521
We've actually met on
campus a few times.

191
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:01,858
So you are coming to the
press party this weekend.

192
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,483
All right.

193
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,069
If you have any plans
literally cancel

194
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,361
because it's going to be epic.

195
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,824
So text me really quick.

196
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,660
Like the bird.

197
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,327
Right?

198
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:12,871
Right.

199
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,626
And I will text you back.

200
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,591
All right Wren, got it.

201
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,468
Going to be a soup spun.

202
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,596
Well, thanks Wren.

203
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,848
I will try to stop by.

204
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,768
I'll literally be devastated
if you don't show up.

205
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,438
Okay, bye.

206
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,398
Bye.

207
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:48,446
It is my firm belief that
she is still talking.

208
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,074
Literally.

209
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:53,662
Really?

210
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,001
All right, well, I got to
go, I am late for class.

211
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,335
So see you guys.

212
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,044
Bye.

213
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,630
Watch out for cuckoo birds.

214
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:10,677
How do I do that?

215
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,388
Say the things
you want to say?

216
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,305
Yeah, like that.

217
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,306
Well, I was a preemie.

218
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:19,144
So my filters never
fully developed.

219
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,896
I mean, don't you get scared?

220
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,105
Scared, me?

221
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,398
No.

222
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,526
Yes, 100%.

223
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,068
But you got to put
yourself out there

224
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,781
because honestly,
everyone is scared.

225
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:32,157
That girl wasn't scared.

226
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,535
Trust me, she's a
fraidy a cat.

227
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,286
Plus I'm having a
good hair day, so--

228
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,972
Rob, I think we've
got something.

229
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,686
Like a fly all ready.

230
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,242
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

231
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,536
No, thank you, I'm just looking.

232
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:00,621
I'll catch up on that.

233
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,167
I'll wait here, see
how everything is.

234
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,460
And then I'm going to
take her to her house

235
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,921
and then I'll come home.

236
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,549
I can't believe that
I didn't see her.

237
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:56,760
I'll text you or call
you and let you know.

238
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,263
I don't know how
I didn't see her.

239
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,324
Scooch out of the way.

240
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:46,452
I have our new
YouTube channel.

241
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,956
Mm-hmm, he set it
up last night.

242
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:55,420
Uh, you binge watching
our show all night?

243
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,255
What?

244
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,341
Oh, yeah, uh, so great.

245
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,137
Um, I'm going to take the
rest of the day off.

246
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,638
Sure.

247
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,098
Bye.

248
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:13,231
So carly.

249
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,158
I shouldn't have
suggested that episode.

250
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,659
Which?

251
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,495
The one with the dating app.

252
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,002
Is Jimi here?

253
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,421
No, she's not.

254
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,427
Help you boys
or something?

255
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,639
Uh, no, just looking around.

256
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,559
We have a BOGO in
our boring section.

257
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,561
Come on, I'll show you.

258
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:59,568
Size wise, I'm going
to guess extra basic.

259
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,321
Let's try that, come ne.

260
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:11,496
Uh, you want some
unsolicited advice?

261
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,082
Actually, yes,
I would love that.

262
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:19,004
Well, with that girl,
you have to communicate.

263
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,508
I just, I never really know
what to say to her.

264
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,677
Like, just got so much stuff
going on in my life

265
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,556
it feels like it's kind of
all over the road.

266
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:34,060
Sometimes saying
nothing is Okay, you just

267
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,647
have to communicate
with your actions.

268
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:38,982
I mean, Jimi listens
to what people say,

269
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:42,694
but she believes what
they actually do.

270
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,196
You should market yourself.

271
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,740
Got it.

272
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:49,117
It isn't always what you say,

273
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,327
sometimes it's what you do.

274
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,220
So what's with the leg?

275
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,472
Oh, uh, I, I just had a
mishap on my bike.

276
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,891
And I went to the
Doctor's and they

277
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:13,892
said that it's
just my knee,

278
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,310
I'll be fine in a
couple of days.

279
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,269
A couple of days, huj?

280
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,020
Hmm.

281
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,147
So this is the property I
was texting you about.

282
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,231
You bought this?

283
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:20,899
I did.

284
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,818
Best real estate out there.

285
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,111
Wow, the family farm.

286
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,533
That's the real real.

287
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,618
So where's mom?

288
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,161
Colorado.

289
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:36,790
Dad and company
tomorrow night.

290
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:37,874
I want your life.

291
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,793
I'm heading that way if
you want to come with,

292
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,713
mom would love to see you.

293
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:44,965
It's tempting.

294
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,884
You guys amaze me.

295
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:52,180
So what about you?

296
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,265
What's the dude situation?

297
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,642
College boys are back in town.

298
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,604
Yeah, no.

299
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,438
He has no idea how
to communicate.

300
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,149
He?

301
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:03,734
Yeah.

302
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:07,237
Well, I mean, no, you know,
like no one communicate.

303
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,866
Some people communicate,

304
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,201
some people are
putting off a vibe.

305
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:16,788
And if you care
about someone,

306
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,501
you can hear them even
when they're quiet.

307
00:24:20,503 --> 00:24:23,336
That is the real real.

308
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:23,920
You got it.

309
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,132
I got it.

310
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:40,145
We need better SEO
for our website.

311
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:44,525
If Junie Mae is the CEO,
I can be the SEO.

312
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:45,400
Okay, look at me.

313
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,778
Yeah, Vulcan mind meld.

314
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,114
Okay, SEO is not a person.

315
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,992
I miss that Star Trek.

316
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,243
Trek?

317
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,872
OK, Vulcan mind meld
is from Star Trek.

318
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,124
Isn't that what I said?

319
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:02,252
You have your car, right?

320
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:09,049
Let's go on a trip.

321
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,302
I'll go grab my stuff.

322
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:20,936
So how was the
motorcycle ride?

323
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:21,479
Amazing.

324
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:27,150
You being careful?

325
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,485
Yeah, I wear a helmet.

326
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,781
I meant the biker.

327
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:38,244
He may be a little
old for me.

328
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:41,416
Yeah, I didn't see
his face, but--

329
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,211
That guy is one of the
most successful real estate

330
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,796
investors in the country.

331
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,715
So he's got money?

332
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:51,967
He still seems to be a little--

333
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,428
Like he could be my dad?

334
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,101
That was John Whyte?

335
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,478
The one and only.

336
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,147
Just crisscrossing the
country, living life.

337
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,065
Oh,

338
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,150
Okay.

339
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:13,822
Wow, I mean, I thought--

340
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:17,534
So the dating app,
you are not on--

341
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,035
No, I am.

342
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:22,831
I set it up like the
Profilers did, one for Liz,

343
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,082
one for Steve.

344
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:28,211
The Real Real
millionaire.

345
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,005
Nice looking beard.

346
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,590
Oh, Okay.

347
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:32,966
Well,

348
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,968
Oh God.

349
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,971
So how's it going?

350
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,598
I think I'm going to
have to figure out

351
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,767
what made them want to be
together in the beginning.

352
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:42,809
I don't know.

353
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:46,688
There are always clues.

354
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,106
You'll find them.

355
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,525
Alrighty.

356
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:52,611
Boomer, come on.

357
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,738
We are going on a CBD run.

358
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,951
You guys need anything for
aches, pains, comprehension?

359
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:02,370
No thanks, I'm good.

360
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,542
OK, he'll be in
around noon tomorrow.

361
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,088
Or so.

362
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,089
My phone.

363
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,050
Will you see who that is?

364

Thank you.

366
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,139
You're on a dating app?

367
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,140

00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:31,191

Don't click on it,
that's how they get you.

373
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,700
Unwrap the possibility.

374
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:41,159
The last thing I need.

375
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,662
No, it's exactly what you need.

376
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:47,457
Look, so you answer
like 10 questions

377
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,793
and you don't even get to see
their pictures or anything

378
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,419
until you've chatted with them.

379
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,672
Just will you please
unsubscribe me or whatever?

380
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:56,592
I don't, I don't want to
be on there.

381
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:59,094
Thank you.

382
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,887

You love what you do.

00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:34,630
Um, I was out for a ride,
and I and I saw your car.

390
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:39,676
Just thought I'd say, hello,
I have your DoorDash delivery

391
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:42,387
in my car.

392
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,555
Hi, Hi Aiden.

393
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,891

394
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:46,683
Hey.

395
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:47,269
Hey.

396
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:37,150
Oh, question, are these
glasses too quirky or does

397
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,861
it give like,
a Clark Kent vibe?

398
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:42,363
I think I have the
wrong house, I'm sorry.

399
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:45,617
No, I mean, who are
you looking for?

400
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,410

00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,247
Aiden, no he's um--

402
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,249
He's not here.

403
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:57,380
He's like um, he's gone.

404
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:59,214
Well, I'm Jimi.

talky retro chick, Okay.

00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:11,560
Um, my-- I'm Connor,

409
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:13,269

00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,399
Um, but you could text him.

412
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:21,903
I mean, he said that
he left you his number?

413
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:24,114
Well, yeah, um, he gave it
to the store, he's been

414
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:25,701
waiting for a
Game Boy to come in.

415
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:33,624
So do you want to,
do you want to come in, or?

416
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:36,209

00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:39,588
Um, no, I'll just,
I'll just text him.

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,634
Or would you have him
text me when he gets back?

419
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:45,135
Yeah.

420
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,845
He doesn't have
your number though.

421
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:47,222
So--

422
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:53,309
Would you mind
giving it to him?

423
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,936
Sure, yeah.

424
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:55,313
What is it?

425
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:00,692
Do you want to like write
it down or something?

426
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:01,359
No, it's cool.

427
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,944
I have a, I have a
photogenic memory.

428
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:05,280
Photographic.

429
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:05,866
Yeah.

430
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:11,038
Do I need to see like a
photograph for that to work?

431
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:18,334
Touché Jimi, touché.

432
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:21,129
Grab my phone.

433
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,839

00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,787
Great, I got it.

00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:54,705
All right. Um--

452
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:56,497
Cut. Cool?

Well, it was nice to
meet you, Con-man.

454
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,796
Interesting to meet you, Jimi.

455
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:09,094
Okay.

456
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:09,471
Okay.

457
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:21,314
Hey?

458
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:24,275
Good morning sunshine.

459
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,820
Any Game Boys come in?

460
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:27,696
No.

461
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:30,281
But when it does, you'll
be the third to know.

462
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:33,284
I'm going to let you text.

463
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,746
Thanks.

464
00:32:35,748 --> 00:32:38,039
Has he even been in lately?

465
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,876
I haven't seen it
for a few days.

466
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:42,503
Wait, when?

467
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:45,338
Uh, the day after the press
opening, the day your dad

468
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,048
came to see you.

469
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,008
So what did he say?

470
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,593
Was, was he looking
for his game?

471
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:52,470
You know he doesn't say much.

472
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:58,852
Asked if you were here,
didn't bring up the Game Boy.

473
00:32:58,854 --> 00:32:59,520
Oh, really?

474
00:32:59,522 --> 00:33:00,105
Mm-hmm.

475
00:33:09,782 --> 00:33:10,405
Cool.

476
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:48,211
What do you think
of her records?

477
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,213
Not much, a little
childhood trauma.

478
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,297
Where did she grow up?

479
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:51,675
Denver.

480
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,595
She went back.

481
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,013
That's the closure?

482
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:58,974
It's where she feels safe.

483
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:15,781
He has no social media.

484
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:19,409
He has no Snapchat, his
roommate hasn't seen him.

485
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,537
He doesn't even
have his phone.

486
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:25,918
Wait, his roommate?

487
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:32,130
Con-man.

488
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:35,008
Jimi, wasn't going
to see you there.

489
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:38,887
What are you-- how are you?

490
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:43,975
I'm Connor,
I'm a uh, shopaholic.

491
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:44,687
Hi Connor.

492
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:48,980
Um, no, I came, I came
by to tell you that

493
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,734
uh, Aiden's phone died.

494
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,443
Oh.

495
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:56,321
My hair, being one of
my better qualities,

496
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:59,991
I always have trouble
figuring out what kind of hats

497
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,159
I need to wear.

498
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:05,205
What, what are your
thoughts on this?

499
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,666
Uh, you do have a
great head of hair.

500
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,209
So no hat?

501
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,628
I say just let the
hair do its thing.

502
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,130
My hair is very independent.

503
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:17,801
You know, sometimes
I look in the mirror,

504
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:23,599
and I think, wow, the
hair is wearing me.

505
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:24,725
Hey dude?

506
00:36:24,727 --> 00:36:27,143
Sara, are you stalking me?

507
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:27,978
Yes.

508
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,105
You know I actually got
this internship just

509
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,357
hoping that randomly one
day you would stroll in,

510
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,358
looking for hats.

511
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,070
Oh, right, right, right,
Um, the marketing thing.

512
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:40,490
Thing, major.

513
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:43,619
Hey, uh, what's the sitch
on your roommate?

514
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:44,204
Yeah.

515
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,458
His dad passed when
he was a little dude,

516
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,422
and um, his mom started
tripping, lots of drugs.

517
00:36:56,424 --> 00:37:00,426
He's kind of the parent,
you know.

518
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,387
No, I didn't know that.

519
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,305
I think I'm going
to get these shades.

520
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:06,016
Just going to have
you plug-in your info.

521
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:09,686
Part of our new marketing
initiative, like my major.

522
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:13,231
I look forward to the spam mail.

523
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,065
Absolutely.

524
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:15,817
Oh, I can take those from you.

525
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,655
We can go bring you up front.

526
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:20,699
Thank you Jimi.

527
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:27,540
All right, keep the change.

528
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:32,918
All right Jimi.

529
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,587
Well, I'm going to
skedaddle, but let

530
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:38,549
me know if you hear
from Aiden, all right?

531
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:42,511
Oh hey, maybe, maybe that
hot blonde that

532
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:45,847
picked him up the other
day knows where he is.

533
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,223
Wait, what? What hot blonde?

534
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,685
Yeah, she drove
up the other day,

535
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:52,437
he ran to the street
corner and hopped in,

536
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,523
hopped in her car
with her.

537
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:57,233
I mean, she's not like
you're kind of hot,

538
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:58,486

539
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:02,238
She, she works it.

540
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,365
I'm not working it.

541
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:08,369
Well, I'm going to,

Stock me later serendipity do.

544
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:12,918
You know it Con-man.

545
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,965
The legendary Con-man.

546
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,299
You know the Con-man?

547
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:22,175
Oh yeah.

548
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,177
Everybody on campus
knows the Con-man.

549
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,804
Okay, he's been there
like eight years.

550
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:27,848
He changes his major
every year, gets

551
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,015
all the scholarship offers

552
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,517
so he can live in the
same apartment,

553
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,936
stay on campus, and then
he gets a new roommate

554
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:35,480
from the campus housing
website every year.

555
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:38,149
Con-man, I get it now.

556
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,526
He likes you.

557
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:40,026
Me?

558
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:40,736
Mm-hmm.

559
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:42,696
He wouldn't have come in
here if he didn't want

560
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:45,240
to help you with your dude.

561
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:46,617
Candidate.

562
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:47,576
Candidate.

563
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:50,829
Candidate.

564
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:53,289
Okay, so you need
to decompress.

565
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,542
I know this kick ass
place, it's called the sea.

566
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,586
It's like an 8 minute
bike ride from here.

567
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:59,337
I'll text you the
directions, Okay?

568
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,964
Now go, decompress.

569
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,337
Hi.

570
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,881
Hi.

571
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,091
Can I help you find anything?

572
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,052
Bags maybe.

573
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:50,221
Well, I actually brought
one in a few months ago,

574
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:51,973
but I don't see it.

575
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,892
Are you looking for
that bag in particular

576
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:55,393
or something different?

577
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:58,148
I kind of liked that one, and
I've been missing it lately.

578
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,611
Well, we might have sold it.

579
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:09,240
That bag needed a second
chance after my luck.

580
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:10,327
Something new might be fun.

581
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,371
Is it for a special occasion?

582
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:16,041
Possibly.

583
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:20,877
Hey girl.

584
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,420
Oh, it's so good to see you.

585
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:25,090
Oh, likewise.

586
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:27,217
Hey, that bag that I brought in.

587
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:31,054
Oh gosh, a lovely young lady
took that a few weeks ago.

588
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:33,016
Seemed like the
perfect fit for her.

589
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:40,271
So, are things getting better?

590
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:42,148
I've been on a dating app.

591
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,651
Eno signed me up.

592
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:48,446
Well, I never pegged you
for the online dating type.

593
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,741
Me neither.

594
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:53,619
I've met a few
interesting guys on there.

595
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,746
The app won't let you
see their profile picture

596
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:58,373
until you chat first.

597
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,834
Any front runner?

598
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:02,961
I think so.

599
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,462
I could use some new in my life.

600
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:09,175
Oh, well, like I always say,
with a fresh set of eyes,

601
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:11,595
all of it can become new.

602
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:15,181
True, very true.

603
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:16,975
I'm not feeling
any of these bags.

604
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:19,144
Oh, check back in a day or two.

605
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,813
Oh I will, I love this place.

606
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:25,316
It was really good
to see you Junie Mae.

607
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:26,777
You too Liz.

608
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,047
There are some people
who can't live alone.

609
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:54,968
They crave that
human connection.

610
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:00,724
Our mom was that way.

611
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:06,603
Aiden and I are both that way.

612
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:11,525
And she taught us about
that human connection.

613
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:14,277
Someone told me recently
that it's not what you say,

614
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:16,655
but it's what you
do that counts.

615
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:20,116
Our mom lived her life that way.

616
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:23,369
All of us were better for it.

617
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:27,250
She loved us, she
loved all of you.

618
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,124
I'm at your house.

619
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:52,252
It's me again--

620
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:27,828
Hey, are you Liz?

621
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,622
No, I'm, I'm not.

622
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:32,334
Well, hi, I'm not Will.

623
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:43,053
You don't look anything
like your pictures.

624
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:46,597
Just two?

625
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:47,432
Two, yes.

626
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:51,560
Please.

627
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:53,019
It's Okay.

628
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:08,368
Thank you for calling
me, I--today's just--

629
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,745
I have no idea
what's going on.

630
00:47:09,747 --> 00:47:13,582
Well, it appears
you and I are fired,

631
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:19,004
and that your internship
has been revoked.

632
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:20,547
What happened?

633
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:24,009
She gives most of her
profits to a women's shelter

634
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:27,137
to help them keep the
doors open because

635
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:30,306
of what she went through.

636
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:32,350
Oh my God.

637
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:34,895
More heart than
business sense.

638
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:37,355
But they can't just put a vape
shop in there, that's just--

639
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:40,358
The bank has it tentatively
sold to some people

640
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,863
from the college, rich
kids, daddy's money.

641
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:48,241
I'm sure it'll be closed
again in a couple of months.

642
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:50,037
It's those two basic
dudes, with a camera.

643
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:55,541
So what's going to
happen to our stuff?

644
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:57,959
It says we only have
a week to get it out.

645
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:01,963
Got a van coming, going to
get us some storage spaces.

646
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:03,339
We can't just let this happen.

647
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:05,383
It's a lot harder on Junie Mae.

648
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:06,802
So where even is she?

649
00:48:06,804 --> 00:48:09,137
She left the day
before they came,

650
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:13,224
she just couldn't stand to
watch them lock the doors.

651
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:16,394
She's gone to see her
family in Fort Smith.

652
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:19,189
So everyone's just disappearing.

653
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:20,108
Did you ever find Aiden?

654
00:48:24,154 --> 00:48:26,865
He'll be back, and
Junie Mae will too.

655
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:41,211
Oh my God.

656
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:43,171
Boomer, when did
you do all this?

657
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,340
We have been working
on it a little bit

658
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:46,800
every day since I started.

659
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:48,552
So how's it going?

660
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:53,181
Well, we've got sales from
Facebook, from the Twitter,

661
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:56,727
from YouTube, and the Gram.

662
00:48:56,729 --> 00:49:01,690
And it deposits in our
account in two days.

663
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:03,066
I can't believe it.

664
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,943
And it covers some of
the cash that we've

665
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:07,320
been short on our deposits.

666
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:09,114
Is it enough to
stop foreclosure.

667
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:11,783
We're $8,000 behind
at the bank,

668
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:14,494
and this will get
us halfway there.

669
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:16,246
And our projections
will show them

670
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:19,124
that we're capable
of catching up.

671
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,834
What do you mean that
we're short on cash

672
00:49:20,836 --> 00:49:21,920
on our deposits?

673
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:24,838
Everything hasn't added
up between our sales

674
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,133
and our deposits in
the last few weeks.

675
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:30,301
I'm sure it's Junie
Mae's accounting system.

676
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:32,638
I have a meeting at
the bank tomorrow,

677
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,474
and this should
get our store back.

678
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:40,061
You are a marketing genius.

679
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:40,731
Finally.

680
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:45,776
Thank you.

681
00:49:45,778 --> 00:49:47,443
No promises.

682
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:48,695
Can we call Junie Mae?

683
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:52,448
See how it goes at the
bank, then we'll call her.

684
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:52,991
Agreed.

685
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:44,543
Mr. Anderson is
ready for you now.

686
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:46,712
Okay.

687
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:47,590
Just follow me
up these stairs.

688
00:51:16,744 --> 00:51:18,493
He's just inside the door.

689
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:19,329
Thank you.

690
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:31,507
Boomer, how the hell are you?

691
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:33,133
You'll see.

692
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:34,760
What you got for me today?

693
00:51:34,762 --> 00:51:37,262
Actually some good news.

694
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:38,639
Anything I can
get you gentlemen?

695
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:40,223
No, we're fine, thank you.

696
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:40,851
Alrighty.

697
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:48,774
We've been doing a
little online sales,

698
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:51,735
and the numbers
look pretty good.

699
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:54,195
That amount deposits
in the bank tonight

700
00:51:54,197 --> 00:51:57,115
which will get us
about halfway there.

701
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:59,743
And our projections
for the fourth quarter

702
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:03,539
show us catching up, and
even a little bit ahead.

703
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:07,584
All we need is to get the
lease back in Junie Mae's name,

704
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,503
and get these
payments caught up.

705
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:16,802
Well, I don't think we
can help you on this

706
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:17,761
one at this point Boomer.

707
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:21,014
Our projections are made on
the last 60 days of selling.

708
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:24,475
And we have Black Friday
and Cyber Monday next month,

709
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:27,521
and that should put
us over the top.

710
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:30,190
It just doesn't
work that simple.

711
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:31,858
What do you mean?

712
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:37,739
You see, the new owners,
big contributors here,

713
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:41,076
on the Board of Regents at
the school, you understand.

714
00:52:41,078 --> 00:52:43,078
Oh.

715
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,706
They want to do
this for their kids.

716
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,415
Get them in business
for themselves,

717
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:50,335
give them an opportunity
to learn something,

718
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:52,420
you've probably seen them
around, they've been in,

719
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:53,338
take a few pictures.

720
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,299
Well, we'll be
hiring pretty soon.

721
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:58,760
Yeah, Boomer it's just
not going to happen.

722
00:52:58,762 --> 00:53:00,929
I mean, I could call,

723
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:03,056
but I know exactly what
he's going to say.

724
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:05,391
Would you?

725
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:06,476
Call him?

726
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,606
It's important to
a lot of people.

727
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:27,247
Bill?

728
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:29,374
Nate over at the bank.

729
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:31,710
Yeah, I've got Boomer from
second chances sitting

730
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:33,419
across the table
from me right now,

731
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:37,173
he's got a financial proposal.

732
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:40,636
No, I realize that.

733
00:53:40,638 --> 00:53:46,642
It's already been signed, but
there are a few days to remedy.

734
00:53:46,644 --> 00:53:48,184
No.

735
00:53:48,186 --> 00:53:48,727
No.

736
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:54,024
No we don't need to do that.

737
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:54,900
We'll, move forward.

738
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:56,403
All right, we appreciate
your business.

739
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,494
Like I said Boomer,
there's nothing I can do.

740
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:08,040
Well, if you change
your mind--

741
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:28,644
Hey, how'd it go?

742
00:54:31,689 --> 00:54:35,190
I gave it my best shot,
I even knew the banker.

743
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:38,819
I made a very, very
reasonable presentation,

744
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:41,321
and it just didn't go.

745
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:43,657
You showed them like everything
you showed me last night

746
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:44,240
though, right?

747
00:54:44,242 --> 00:54:45,576
Yes I did.

748
00:54:45,578 --> 00:54:48,119
I laid it out all
in front of him,

749
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,915
and he just didn't get it.

750
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:53,875
But we had the money.

751
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:57,255
We still do, it just
didn't add up to him.

752
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:02,427
Okay, so what are
we going to do?

753
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:10,559
Lessons of love
to learn yourself.

754
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:13,019
You know, a lot of
magic can come out

755
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:14,437
of one of these things.

756
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:31,804
Come right in, here.

757
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:39,935
Thirsty?

758
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:40,604
Um, some water.

759
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:56,745
Thanks.

760
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:14,553
I know Boomer told you
everything, what was going on.

761
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:23,105
I'm really sorry for leaving
you hanging for a few days.

762
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:29,862
I just had to get out of there.

763
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:34,906
I just couldn't stand
to see them come in

764
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:35,909
and take everything away.

765
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:45,250
I just wish you would have
told me, about everything.

766
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:47,295
Remember all of our talks
about communication.

767
00:59:55,888 --> 00:59:56,764
Yeah, it's been hard.

768
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:03,521
So many people
rely on that store.

769
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:13,695
I have let so many
people down.

770
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:17,407
No, you haven't.

771
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:21,953
You've, you've been there
for so many people for

772
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:29,920
so many years, including me.

773
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:30,714
You're my best friend.

774
01:00:38,305 --> 01:00:45,646
I pray every night that
there would be some way.

775
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:53,028
So how are you?

776
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:56,824
Any Aiden updates?

777
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:02,661
I don't know what's
going on honestly.

778
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:05,080
I have no idea.

779
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:10,376
But um, my dad rode into town
this week and surprised me.

780
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:13,046
He said if I'm just
spinning my wheels,

781
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:14,590
I might as well make it count.

782
01:01:14,592 --> 01:01:19,302
So he invited me to go on
the road with him and mom.

783
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:23,724
He says it might help to
see new places and faces.

784
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:26,434
Oh, oh no.

785
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:29,730
No, no, you are not
leaving me here.

786
01:01:29,732 --> 01:01:35,360
No, either you stay or he's
going to need a sidecar.

787
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:42,325
What will I do without you?

788
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:44,913
What you always
do, be incredible.

789
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:53,589
Well, get dressed,
we're going out tonight.

790
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:57,758
Okay.

791
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,926
I'm going to go
home and get ready,

792
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,804
and you'll swing by and
pick me up at 7:00 PM.

793
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:04,973
And wear something vintage.

794
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,207
I'm always over drunk.

795
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:33,585
Nice party.

796
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,504
Well, look who it is.

797
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:37,923
Hey guys, I'm going
to go get a drink.

798
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:39,591
So glad they're reopening.

799
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:44,638
Yeah, I was literally lost
when I heard they were closing.

800
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,306
So um, what have
you been up to?

801
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:48,767
Work, you know,
not much else.

802
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:49,601
You?

803
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:54,397
You know me, I'm always full
tilt. TV, plate of spaghetti,

804
01:02:54,399 --> 01:02:55,566
sweatpants.

805
01:02:55,568 --> 01:02:57,233
I haven't been able
to master spaghetti,

806
01:02:57,235 --> 01:02:59,986
but I got the sweat pants-TV
thing down real good

807
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:00,739
How's your girl?

808
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:10,874
I love her.

809
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:22,219
What in God's name?

810
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:37,359
My dear old friend.

811
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:44,823
I don't even know
what to ask first.

812
01:03:44,825 --> 01:03:48,326
We found a way for us to get
our store back and all of this.

813
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:49,371
Found us a new investor.

814
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:57,460
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr White.

815
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:59,172
Welcome to Oklahoma
Commerce Bank.

816
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:09,848
No more lease, both
spaces paid for,

817
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:13,061
these two are all ours.

818
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:16,522
I don't have the words.

819
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:21,401
And all these people are
friends and customers.

820
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:22,946
How did you get
everyone here?

821
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:33,664
I'm going to need someone
to run the new space.

822
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:36,792
Will you stay?

823
01:04:36,794 --> 01:04:38,502
Hey mama.

824
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:42,047
And you can bring on
your own marketer.

825
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:42,631
Deal.

826
01:04:49,682 --> 01:04:53,058
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

827
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:57,312
Oh my pleasure.

828
01:04:57,314 --> 01:04:59,022
It does my heart
good my one.

829
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:01,567
Oh, your donations
to this shelter

830
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:04,194
means so much to everyone.

831
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:06,279
Some months we couldn't
even have stayed open

832
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:08,031
if it wasn't for
your generosity.

833
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:12,661
Oh, the credit goes
to these angels here.

834
01:05:12,663 --> 01:05:14,663
Thank you, we wouldn't
have been able to help

835
01:05:14,665 --> 01:05:16,957
so many people
without your support,

836
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:20,376
it means so much
to these ladies.

837
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,929
Jimi, Con-man, Connor.

838
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,430
So yeah, I just
wanted to give you

839
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:34,766
the score on that hot blonde.

840
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:38,353
Was just chatting with Aiden
and dude, that's his sister.

841
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:42,941
Their mom died, funeral
and stuff, you know, so--

842
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:44,400
That sucks.

843
01:05:44,402 --> 01:05:44,987
Later.

844
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:50,784
Hey.

845
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:57,163
I, I just got a voicemail
from your roommate

846
01:05:57,165 --> 01:05:59,877
about your mom and your
sister, I'm so sorry.

847
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:04,420
We can talk about that later.

848
01:06:04,422 --> 01:06:07,591
I really just wanted
to come ask if you

849
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:08,967
want to go on a date with me.

850
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:13,805
You know, like an actual date.

851
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:16,850
Yeah, yeah, Okay.

852
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:19,728
When were you thinking?

853
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,187
Now.

854
01:06:21,189 --> 01:06:22,438
Now?

855
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,273
Now.

856
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:59,893
These are the three key
elements of marketing--

857
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:01,146
Look who's here.

858
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:04,650
Oh, hello?

859
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:09,110
Wren, is it?

860
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:12,781
I would like to introduce
you to my niece,

861
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:16,579
Wren She's an actor.

862
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:18,995
It's nice to meet
you Junie Mae.

863
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:22,708
I've heard so much about
you from Uncle Boom.

864
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:27,796
Oh, you're just
full of surprises.

865
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:29,380
I fly back to LA today,

866
01:07:29,382 --> 01:07:30,381
so I wanted to come
in and meet you

867
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:32,217
for real this time.

868
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:33,760
She's good, isn't she?

869
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:34,553
I'll say.

870
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:38,724
Now, you know Junie Mae
used to live in Hollywood.

871
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:41,560
Boomer, don't go
telling stories.

872
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:43,353
Were you an actor?

873
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:45,689
She was a writer.

874
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:46,189
Really?

875
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:46,940
What'd you write?

876
01:07:46,942 --> 01:07:51,945
She was the lead writer
on Criminal Profiles.

877
01:07:51,947 --> 01:07:53,029
You wrote that?

878
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:54,405
I love that show.

879
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:58,535
Well, there were a lot
of writers on that show.

880
01:07:58,537 --> 01:08:02,956
She's been working on a new
episode for next season.

881
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,415
Well, I'm sure
they'll love it.

882
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:06,960
Oh, and she writes
love letters.

883
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:10,463
I found an early draft
when I was carrying out

884
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:12,342
the trash several weeks ago.

885
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:20,015
You should write more, that
show is so binge worthy.

886
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:20,974
Thank you Wren--

887
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:21,600
You're welcome.

888
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:23,059
--so nice of you.

889
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:26,772
Thanks again uncle Boomer
for the acting job.

890
01:08:26,774 --> 01:08:28,481
And I hope things
work out with Jimi.

891
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:30,692
That guy Aiden
really likes her.

892
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:33,403
I'll walk you out.

893
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:34,237
Bye.

894
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:55,420
My dad told me he got
our buildings back for us

895
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:58,048
because he wanted our store
to be a beacon of light,

896
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:02,678
a constant reminder that second
chances happen every day.

897
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,638
And then he leaned
