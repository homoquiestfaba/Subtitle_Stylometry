1
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:47,582
The principle, Your Honor,
is informed waiver,

2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,854
a concept deeply embedded
in the black-letter law of this state.

3
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:56,388
This is a simple case of a contract
willingly and completely executed.

4
00:01:56,466 --> 00:02:00,300
Appeals to the contrary, based on emotion,
have no place in a court of law.

5
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,110
- Objection!
- Order, order!

6
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:13,911
This is not a court of law.
You did not enter through a doorway.

7
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:17,919
That, ladies and gentlemen, is the rabbit hole
and we, like so many Alices,

8
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:23,391
have plunged through it
directly into Wonderland.

9
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,260
Behold the Queen of Hearts,
Carraghan Chemical.

10
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:34,065
A company that has spewed its bile
into the Leffingwell River for 17 years.

11
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:37,231
Plants wither. Children die.

12
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:40,799
And there isn't a court in the land
that can stop them.

13
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,346
Finally, one man has had enough.

14
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:51,314
Frustrated, desperate, he slams
his truck into the plant manager's office

15
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,415
and for one bright, shining day,
that hellhole of a factory shuts down.

16
00:02:56,492 --> 00:03:00,326
Do we honor him?
Do we throw him a parade?

17
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,365
Do we even say thank you?

18
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:07,800
No. He is put on trial.

19
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,363
- Welcome to the Mad Hatter's tea party.
- Objection!

20
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:13,772
Objection? Why not "Off with their heads"?

21
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:16,209
...paid him fully, according to the contract.

22
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:19,839
But now he wants more and he intends
to get it by harassing my client.

23
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,474
Yes, the plaintiff is
a man of moderate means.

24
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:25,612
Yes, Xydex is a very successful corporation.

25
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:29,021
But the law, not charity,
must dictate our course today.

26
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,719
Yes, yes.

27
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,957
He rammed through that wall.

28
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:40,799
And, yes, he did shut
that hellish factory down for one day.

29
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,638
And, yes, he is responsible
for damages in the amount of $427,000.

30
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,475
How high a price is that to pay
if he saved just one single life?

31
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:55,210
Madam, I will give you $427,000
for your child. Deal?

32
00:03:56,352 --> 00:04:00,413
And you, madam.
Same price for your husband.

33
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:04,550
And you, counselor. How about half
a million bucks for your precious hide?

34
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,221
- Objection!
- Order!

35
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,493
- The counsel is out of line.
- Sustained.

36
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,659
Mr Ward, sit down.

37
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:15,226
Order, order!

38
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,772
Defense is prepared to mount its case.

39
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:20,775
We have witnesses,

40
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:24,506
depositions and evidence
to prove my client acted fairly.

41
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,573
But to what end? The plaintiff has
put no viable case before this court.

42
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,678
Defense moves for nonsuit.
Submitted, Your Honor.

43
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:37,556
Would you go next door and remind them
thatjustice is blind, and not deaf?

44
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:41,719
As to your motion, counsel...

45
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,566
12 minutes.
12 minutes!

46
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,763
Eight and a half days
it took those idiots to mount their case!

47
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:54,468
- Too bad you mispronounced "harassing. "
- It's too bad you didn't get a chance to.

48
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:57,705
Counselor, where will you be
spending your vacation?

49
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,240
- I have no vacation.
- Maggie! You must have three or four weeks.

50
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:05,981
No. I hear something big's
happening on Argo Motors.

51
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,557
- Do you know anything about it?
- No.

52
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,251
Have you?
I haven't heard.

53
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:13,386
You guys wanna be big-time lawyers,
learn to lie better.

54
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,556
Maggie! Lawyers never lie.

55
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:20,500
We just tell the truth judiciously
to guarantee utter confusion.

56
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:25,063
Damn, you could lose your hand
in one of this things.

57
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:38,818
Mr Ward, excuse me.
Howard Crayhill.

58
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,357
<i>I've read all your books.
I've read Civil Rights on Trial twice.</i>

59
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:46,622
Congratulations.
You found a copy they hadn't burned.

60
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,689
Grateful client?

61
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,531
No, it's a present for your mother.
Anniversary.

62
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:58,004
Hard to believe we've been together 34 years.

63
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,938
35.

64
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,817
You're biting your fingernails again, Margaret.

65
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,380
Don't.

66
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:17,990
Minor flesh wound.
He didn't even draw blood.

67
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,655
Brian, my father always draws blood.

68
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,641
I was getting ready to make a left.
I had the blinker on.

69
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:40,842
I saw the other car coming towards me,
in the rearview mirror.

70
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,511
And I couldn't move.
I couldn't get out of the way.

71
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:46,714
I just watched him, in slow motion.

72
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,987
At first, I couldn't believe it was happening.

73
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,360
It was like watching TV or something.

74
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,025
And then the guy hit me.

75
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:03,698
The carjust... Itjust exploded.

76
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,901
There was fire everywhere.

77
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:10,512
My wife started screaming,

78
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,673
and my baby boy...

79
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,781
- Son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry.

80
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,953
You have nothing to apologize for.

81
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,115
What happened to you...

82
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:30,457
I'm so goddamned tired of this.

83
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:33,729
Those bastards think
they can do anything they want.

84
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:38,206
Lie, kill, destroy whatever
they touch and get away with it.

85
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:42,142
Let me tell you something, Steven.
They don't always get away with it.

86
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:46,045
Once in a while, people like us,
this law firm, we stop them.

87
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,549
This is going to be one of those times.

88
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,882
Mr Ward, I'm very grateful.

89
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:55,117
I just wish that I had been
with your firm from the beginning.

90
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,886
We're here now.

91
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,427
Good afternoon.
Quinn Califan and Lunt.

92
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:12,964
I'm sorry, he's away from his desk right now.
May I take a message?

93
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,099
Hold on one second.

94
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,303
Maggie!

95
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:20,144
- Maggie, Mr Grazier wants to see you.
- Now?

96
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:25,480
OK, tell me what you know
about Argo Motors.

97
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,523
They're our biggest client.
21% of last year's billing.

98
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:33,687
26. They're headed up by Eugene Forrest.
He came aboard two years ago...

99
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:38,028
In a hostile takeover. Thinks the future
of automobiles is in computerization.

100
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:41,934
Rumor is now that he's looking
to merge with a Silicon Valley type.

101
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:46,168
Wrong. He found it.
LorCoTron Electronics.

102
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,505
Jeez. Big time.

103
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,014
But there's a catch.
And this is where we come in.

104
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,516
Three years ago, a class action suit
was filed against Argo,

105
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:01,056
claiming that their 1985 station wagon,
the Meridian, blew up on impact.

106
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,785
- So? Lawsuits are a dime a dozen.
- Did they have a case?

107
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:10,287
No. I've handled Argo since that car was
still on the drawing boards. It's totally clean.

108
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:14,166
We persuaded the other side's attorneys
that they couldn't win.

109
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,866
But now another firm has re-filed.
A much more aggressive firm.

110
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:22,536
The new American way.
Find the guy who built it, then rob him blind.

111
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:26,509
- So what do we do, guys?
- Settle, for chump change.

112
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:31,042
- Confidentiality clause, don't tell the papers.
- No, we have to win in public.

113
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,884
LorCoTron is a very conscientious
company, very consumer-oriented.

114
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,824
This LorCoTron thing is time-critical.
You can't...

115
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:40,657
OK, OK!

116
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,665
If I decide we fight it,
one of you will be on point.

117
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,099
It's good input.

118
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,695
Thanks for your time.

119
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:54,508
My hobby is rebuilding American cars...

120
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,670
Get outta here!

121
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,132
Michael.

122
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:25,797
You have to give me this case.

123
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,544
I know Argo backwards and forwards.

124
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:33,138
I'm a better litigator
than any other associate

125
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:36,082
and you're too busy to go to court
on all the prep work.

126
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:39,451
Bernstein has a lot going for him.
He's a team player.

127
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,785
Second team.

128
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,153
Maggie!

129
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,059
Please! This is the partnership express.
I deserve this.

130
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:51,793
- Why are you throwing lightweights at me?
- Look. OK. OK!

131
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:54,928
I want you on this one.

132
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:57,564
There's no question.

133
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,167
- There's a problem.
- What?

134
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:06,074
Plaintiff's attorney's your father.

135
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:14,252
Yeah? What's wrong?

136
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:19,784
- We got no case.
- Sure we have a case. Look at the facts.

137
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:24,265
I've looked. Looked at the probability charts
backwards and forwards, Jed.

138
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,531
The facts are that Argo built a half a million
Meridians and a few of them blew up.

139
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:32,134
132 cars?

140
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,802
On a half a million built,
that's only a few cars.

141
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:38,779
That's not that many more
than would have blown up no matter what.

142
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:44,980
Maybe Argo designed it wrong, maybe they
didn't. But that doesn't make a case.

143
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:49,457
Hey, I got a car that blows up, people
like Steven who almost died in 'em.

144
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:54,155
I got a car company that doesn't give a shit.
To me that makes a case.

145
00:11:54,230 --> 00:12:00,032
Rosenberg Blittman had everything
that we have. They had it for three years.

146
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,696
They dropped the case.
Couldn't find anything.

147
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,968
Billy Blittman couldn't find
his butt with both hands.

148
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,542
That's true, but it's a contingency case, Jed.

149
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,914
Even if we win, we see no money for years.
Can we afford that?

150
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:21,012
Hey, I know it's not a slam dunk, Nick.

151
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:26,757
Once in a while, you just gotta go
with your gut, the passion.

152
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:30,059
I got a real feeling about this one.
Network news-time.

153
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,193
- Jed, I like seeing you on TV. Really...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

154
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:38,272
It's not about my ego.
It's about us. What we stand for.

155
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:42,401
This firm was built on David and Goliath
cases. They're not around any more.

156
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:46,208
All these fascist Reagan judges
hear you're after a big corporation,

157
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:49,046
they throw your ass right out of court.

158
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,018
It's too discouraging.

159
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:54,749
Something like this comes along.
Good plaintiffs, decent evidence.

160
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,087
Ajudge who'll listen.

161
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,220
I gotta tell you,
I've gone to war with a lot less.

162
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:06,728
It would be fun
to nail those Argo bastards to the wall.

163
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:14,534
- Wanna kick their asses?
- I believe so.

164
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:38,490
Just once, I'd like to see you
sleep through the night.

165
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:42,059
- Miss these great movies?
- They are on cassette.

166
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:45,072
No, it's not the same.

167
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,233
You're freezing.

168
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,471
Michael.

169
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,848
- Do you like me?
- What?

170
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:00,012
- Do I like you?
- Yeah.

171
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:03,319
- What kind of a question's that? Of course.
- Surprise.

172
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,586
How can you not know that?

173
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:09,529
How can I know that?
How can anybody?

174
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:15,264
Tomorrow, if I did something you
really hated, would you still be here?

175
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:17,430
Listen. Come here.

176
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,308
Listen to me.
That's not the way these things work.

177
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:24,778
I'm not your father.

178
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:28,476
- This has nothing to do with him.
- Yes, it does.

179
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:33,215
Maggie. I want this to work.
I really do.

180
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:36,553
I trust you. And you want
to know if you can trust me.

181
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:40,628
All right.

182
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:45,360
Give this place up.
Live with me. Mm?

183
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:49,961
No, Michael. We said we'd talk
about that after I make partner.

184
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,475
- Maybe we need to talk about it now.
- No.

185
00:14:55,844 --> 00:15:00,747
It might help
but I'm just not ready to go public yet.

186
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:04,546
You don't think they suspect?

187
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,679
Suspecting is different
from being on the mailing list.

188
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:10,486
- Who cares what they think?
- I do.

189
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,325
- Why?
- Because it's different for a woman.

190
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:21,996
I don't want them saying I made partner
for anything other than my work.

191
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,529
Maybe I should be the one
asking how much you like me.

192
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,842
No.

193
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,376
Oh, no!

194
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:34,712
No, come on.
One anxiety attack at a time.

195
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,944
Your turn, is it?

196
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:39,111
Oh, OK.

197
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:17,125
- Who's Cyd Charisse?
- Deborah, your dad's new intern.

198
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,888
- She's really great.
- Aren't they all?

199
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:22,055
Ah, come on!

200
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,470
Good luck with the school board.

201
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,343
Luck I got. Votes I need. Thanks a lot.

202
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,440
Mom! Hiya.

203
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:47,512
Mom, come on. You're the bride. You're
supposed to be having a good time. Relax.

204
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:51,855
- It's my petition. Are you having fun?
- Yeah, I haven't talked to Dad all evening.

205
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,986
- Maggie!
- Maggie, be nice.

206
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:59,090
- Maggie, I got one for you.
- Stop that.

207
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:02,365
<i>Weems versus United States, 1910.
What was the issue?</i>

208
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:05,167
Damn, a pop quiz
and me without a blue book.

209
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,538
These are the easy ones. Come on!

210
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:10,476
Cruel and unusual punishment.

211
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:14,038
- They put a guy in chains for 15 years.
- That's absolutely right.

212
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,676
- OK, so you do know everything.
- That's right also.

213
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,313
Terrific, everybody's right.
Jed, why don't you and Maggie dance?

214
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,987
You promised! Excuse me, but rumor
has it this used to be a party.

215
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:29,223
- Come on, Nick, dance with me.
- All right.

216
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:32,698
- Jed, dance with Maggie.
- All right, but you're a party pooper.

217
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,632
- One more, one more.
- What?

218
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:38,036
<i>1941. Kemper v Walden. Issue?</i>

219
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,471
- Come on, issue!
- All right, all right.

220
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:48,345
- Issue!
- All right, all right, wait!

221
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:51,682
- I haven't the vaguest idea.
- The court ruled

222
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:58,592
that children have the right
to sue their parents for nonperformance.

223
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:12,499
The guy in the peach trunks, Nature Boy
Rick Flair, I represented him once.

224
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,668
- He used to wrestle under the name of...
- Son of Satan.

225
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:17,769
Son of Satan. Right.

226
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,680
He had the horns, he had the pitch fork,
the whole shot.

227
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,776
He had a great thing going
with a guy named the Angel of God.

228
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:28,584
One morning, Satan wakes up
and he sees the light.

229
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,023
Becomes a Born Again Christian.
Blows the whole rivalry.

230
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:35,393
- What happened?
- Son of God goes berserk.

231
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:39,264
- He sues my client for breach of contract.
- Did they have a contract?

232
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,895
- He was imposing on my client's...
- Religious freedoms.

233
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,871
- Can I talk to you?
- Just a minute.

234
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,636
- Did you win?
- The judge threw us out of court.

235
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:51,235
He thought it was a publicity stunt
and that we should go to hell.

236
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:52,575
- Dad.
- What?

237
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,639
- I need to talk to you.
- OK.

238
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,446
- See you guys.
- Sorry. Thanks.

239
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,553
<i>This Walden versus Kemper.
Did you make that up?</i>

240
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,818
Look it up, counselor.

241
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:08,386
I wanted to ask you
about something about work.

242
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:11,626
- You want to ask me about something?
- Yeah. I know.

243
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:15,601
- You want my advice?
- It shocked the hell out of me.

244
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:19,664
I've been offered a case.
A good case. Partnership time.

245
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:24,337
- Why would you want to be a partner there?
- Dad, please! Don't make me sorry I asked.

246
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:29,474
- Go ahead, ask. What's the problem?
- I get this look in your eye. For God's sake.

247
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:36,082
OK. Anyway, it's a great case.
I know I could try the hell out of it.

248
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:41,824
But I wonder if I should pass it up because
there's a pretty extreme conflict involved.

249
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,831
- How extreme?
- They want me on Meridian.

250
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:52,497
- So what's the problem?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

251
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,135
It's obvious there's no problem.
You're not taking it.

252
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:57,974
Oh, really? Just like that?

253
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:01,675
Margaret, don't you see?
They're using you as a parlor trick.

254
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,944
They think I'll see my precious daughter

255
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,681
- and go all soft inside.
- It's a bit more than that.

256
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,383
Will you think, Margaret?
You're an associate at Quinn Califan.

257
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:16,158
They pop out baby lawyers like you, like
a shark grows teeth, row after row, forever.

258
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:19,632
When it comes to the crunch,
they'll send in the big boys.

259
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:23,728
They already did.

260
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,397
You mean you?

261
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,300
Did it ever occur to you
that I might be a very good attorney?

262
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:34,372
- You damn well better be. I raised you.
- No! Mother raised me!

263
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,576
You had a date.

264
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:37,913
Sorry.

265
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,493
I'm looking forward to it.
It's kinda funny.

266
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:55,695
I don't see the humor.

267
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:01,274
Fred Quinn thinks
he can rattle me with my daughter.

268
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:04,504
What if she wins?

269
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:09,380
Some day, maybe, but please
don't force me to be immodest.

270
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:12,249
No one ever had to before.

271
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:17,417
- Whose side are you on, anyway?
- Oh, Jed. Don't be an ass.

272
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:32,399
- Absolute nonsense!
- What do you mean?

273
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:37,411
You don't know what you're talking about!
What do you want me to do, buy her flowers?

274
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:41,745
- She hates me!
- She doesn't hate you.

275
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:44,445
She hates me, goddamnit.

276
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,619
- I see it every time I look in her eyes.
- Oh, yeah?

277
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,955
Yeah. I don't hate her
and I have every right to.

278
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:56,820
Does it matter to her
that these cars are blowing up? No.

279
00:21:56,932 --> 00:22:01,665
Does it matter her that people...
babies are being killed? No.

280
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,833
Does she care that she's in bed
with the vilest kind of corporate vermin?

281
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:11,606
- I'm talking to you!
- No, you're not. You're talking to the jury.

282
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,982
Listen, Jed. I love you dearly
but you are a superior, self-righteous bastard

283
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,020
who's never satisfied
with anybody or anything.

284
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:23,990
If I were Maggie,
I wouldn't want you to be my father either.

285
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:31,026
- So I'm the bad guy here?
- Oh, I don't know.

286
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:34,591
I should have locked
the two of you in a room years ago

287
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,298
and not let you get out
until you'd kissed and made up.

288
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:43,037
But I thought, in time,
you'd come to your senses.

289
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:45,705
Boy, was I wrong.

290
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:49,682
So now I spend my life
between two bickering children,

291
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,812
both of whom are old enough to know better.

292
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,982
Especially you.

293
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,455
Margaret, I can take.

294
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:09,061
A swine like Frederick Quinn,
no problem at all. But you...

295
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:11,230
you rattle me.

296
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:15,903
Stelli, I love you.

297
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:21,745
You know me for the old codger that I am,
and you still hang around.

298
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,377
I can't for the life of me understand why.

299
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,425
Jed...

300
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:37,487
this case will eventually go away.

301
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:46,433
Please, please don't make her go away with it.

302
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:18,797
Hi!

303
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,374
Hi, how are you?

304
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,808
Are you ready?

305
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,546
Maggie, are you taking one for a test drive?

306
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:37,888
I don't even have a learner's permit!

307
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:41,592
You don't need one! On-the-job training.

308
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,223
Very funny. Very funny.

309
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:49,963
- So what's wrong?
- I didn't say a word.

310
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,562
I know. And very loudly.

311
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:55,109
OK.

312
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:57,475
I'm worried, Maggie.

313
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,070
I'd like you to drop the case.

314
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,013
- Tell him to drop it. I dare you.
- He won't.

315
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:10,091
- I dare you!
- You know he won't.

316
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:16,025
This is the first time I have him
somewhere he doesn't make the rules,

317
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:17,996
before ajudge in a courtroom.

318
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,158
Someplace I can beat him.

319
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,362
"Beat him"? He's your father, Maggie.

320
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,270
So what?

321
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:29,139
I am sick and tired of being afraid of him.

322
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:35,144
All my life he's made me feel like
I wasn't good enough. Never mind if he was.

323
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:38,675
He made some mistakes.
Thatjust makes him human.

324
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,846
Too human.

325
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:44,984
You of all people should know that.

326
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,156
All of those women.
Were those mistakes?

327
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:53,065
What happened between
your father and me is our concern.

328
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:55,728
I think if I can put it behind me,
you should too.

329
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:59,364
Well, I've tried. And I can't.

330
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:03,376
Mom, I was there.
I saw how much he hurt you.

331
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,038
Why didn't you just leave him?

332
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:09,713
Come on, talk to me.

333
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,686
About what you choose?
What about what I want?

334
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:16,883
I won't drop this case. I won't!

335
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,984
Somebody has to fight him. You didn't.

336
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:23,053
Oh, Maggie, you never understood.

337
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,359
Maybe that's my fault.

338
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,768
Look, I had to make a choice with your father.

339
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:34,000
It was a very hard choice.

340
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:38,535
Sure I could have left.
God knows I thought about it.

341
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:41,207
But I still love him.

342
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:44,719
So I decided to stay and try to make it work.

343
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:49,416
It took a long time,
but we got through it.

344
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,087
And I honestly feel that I got
a lot more than I gave up by staying.

345
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:00,531
And I still do,
whether you believe it or not.

346
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,930
It's fine, Mom.

347
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:08,371
You forgive him.

348
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:11,310
You have a right to your choice.

349
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:13,574
And I have a right to mine.

350
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:21,583
We'll just be following you around
for a couple of days, videotaping you.

351
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:26,059
The boat, the docks, trying to show what
your life has been like since the accident.

352
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:28,891
My life, it is not so very interesting.

353
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:32,592
When we show the jury the tape,
we think they'll find it very interesting.

354
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:36,125
We want them to see what you've lost,
what you can't do any more.

355
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,797
I cannot fish is what I cannot do.

356
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,068
- It's good.
- It's good I cannot fish?

357
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:44,737
No, no, Mr Minh. It's a terrible thing.

358
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:48,579
We need to hear the stories
from all the Meridian owners who got hurt.

359
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:53,087
- Mr Minh, I'd like to thank you...
- Who is this man with Mr Ward?

360
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:55,247
That's Jack Tagallini.

361
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:58,087
Mr Ward helped him,
just like he's gonna help you.

362
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,650
Mr Ward, he must be very great man.

363
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,458
A very great man.

364
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:06,989
Now, listen.
You take care. We'll be in touch.

365
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,161
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

366
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:14,306
- Pretty severe burns.
- But his English! The jury won't understand.

367
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:18,107
So we shoot the video.
If it doesn't play, we lose him.

368
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,168
Who's next?

369
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:27,778
We'll go right to the summary proceedings.

370
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,652
- How do I look?
- Nervous.

371
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:34,957
- Why?
- You have Pepto-Bismol on your mouth.

372
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:38,521
- Maggie!
- Hi. Hi.

373
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:44,228
Are we still friends?

374
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:47,069
What do you think?

375
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:51,509
Don't worry about me, Margaret.
I'm just your old decrepit father.

376
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:53,137
Be strong. Come on.

377
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:58,213
Your Honor, it's about evidence.
Plaintiff doesn't have any.

378
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,722
The only reasonable course of action
is to grant my client summary judgment.

379
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,816
- Denied.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

380
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:09,688
Next case.

381
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:17,599
Case no. 861947,

382
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:21,163
<i>Kellen et al. versus Argo Motors.</i>

383
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,741
For the plaintiffs, Jedediah Tucker Ward.

384
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,906
For the defense, Margaret Eleanor Ward.

385
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,747
I'm glad I'm not going to be
at your house for the holidays.

386
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:38,888
I presume the proper waivers
have been signed here.

387
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:43,352
- They have, Your Honor.
- OK, what have you got for me?

388
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:46,093
The court has before it a discovery motion

389
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,898
compelling the defendant to supply
the names and current addresses

390
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:55,739
of all Argo employees involved in designing
the Meridian model, between 1980 and 1985.

391
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,402
Response, Miss Ward.

392
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:02,280
It doesn't deserve one.
This is a bald-faced fishing expedition.

393
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:08,288
People who worked on the car design might
have something interesting to say about it.

394
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:13,383
Your Honor, if my esteemed colleague
had the vaguest idea what he was looking for,

395
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:17,591
he could narrow his discovery
to something smaller than the phone book.

396
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:20,896
Miss Ward, I think he deserves something.

397
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:23,961
What he's asking for is out of the question.

398
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:29,635
Some of the people haven't worked for Argo
for years. They've scattered to the four winds.

399
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:33,271
Generating a current address list
could take thousands of hours.

400
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:40,686
- We will give him the names.
- Mr Ward?

401
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,619
That's a start, Your Honor.

402
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:50,119
The job descriptions and the names are not
of much value without the current addresses.

403
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:53,998
Mr Ward, in all fairness,
I think Miss Ward has proved

404
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,868
that supplying the addresses
would put an undue burden on the defense.

405
00:30:57,972 --> 00:31:02,807
I was concerned about that, too, Your Honor,
so I called the pension department at Argo.

406
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:06,313
Told them I had a former friend
I was looking for named John Smith.

407
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:09,942
Did they have anybody by that name
who worked for the company? They did.

408
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:13,283
Called him up on the computer
and gave me his current address.

409
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,057
- Really?
- An illegal invasion of privacy!

410
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,958
They keep an updated record
of all former employees

411
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,193
- to send them their pension statements.
- Your Honor...

412
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,293
They asked me if I worked with him
at Argo and where did I live,

413
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,897
and then they sent me this current newsletter.

414
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:37,033
It wasn't hard at all, Your Honor.

415
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,204
I want those addresses.

416
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:43,711
- A cheap sideshow trick.
- It worked.

417
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:48,152
- Because Symes is a sucker for your antics.
- Lighten up. I'll buy you an ice cream.

418
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:50,486
- Oh, Jed, cut it out.
- Estelle, shush.

419
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:52,719
No! Now, listen. No more.

420
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:54,919
No. There's a lot more.

421
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,395
This is just the beginning.

422
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,567
- She used to like ice cream.
- She used to like you.

423
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,569
I know.

424
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,778
I know, Michael. You don't have
to try to make me feel better.

425
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:20,945
It's just this thing
is gonna slow us up so much.

426
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:30,192
Maggie.

427
00:32:30,264 --> 00:32:32,960
Maggie! Maggie!

428
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,037
One, two, three, four, five.

429
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,904
One, two, three, four, five.

430
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,242
Mom.

431
00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:53,478
Is there a doctor? Call the doctor!

432
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:55,980
Mom!

433
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:15,367
1954, I was watching the McCarthy
hearings on television.

434
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:23,002
I had trouble keeping my mind
on the testimony.

435
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:27,878
There was this beautiful young woman
sitting in the first row of the gallery.

436
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:34,512
Every time the camera would catch her
in the background, she was doing this.

437
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,585
I was fascinated.

438
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:44,665
I watched for hours,
trying to catch sight of her.

439
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:49,692
Finally, I couldn't stand it any longer.
I called the hearing room.

440
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:51,864
Had the guard...

441
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:56,541
ask her if she would call me during recess.

442
00:34:56,611 --> 00:35:02,345
Amazingly enough, she did. I introduced
myself and asked her what she was doing.

443
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:07,854
She said she was mouthing the words
"McCarthy is a weasel. "

444
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:15,094
Subliminal advertising, she called it.

445
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:21,795
She said it would stick in people's minds
forever and no matter what, she claimed,

446
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:23,962
it would sway the deaf vote.

447
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:31,775
I got on the next plane
and we were married a month later.

448
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:43,383
I'm sure wherever Stelli is now, there are
12 guys better than me chasing her around.

449
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:49,157
But if you have a moment,
I just have this to say.

450
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:51,925
Remember please forever that I love you.

451
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:10,909
Don't be late for work.

452
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:23,688
You OK?

453
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:29,428
I've been better.

454
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,932
- How's it going in there?
- It's going OK.

455
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,707
- People have started to leave.
- Good.

456
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:43,108
You need something?

457
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:49,151
- A priest.
- Yeah.

458
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:53,319
Somebody I could confess to.
Somebody who'd tell me it wasn't my fault.

459
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:56,386
It wasn't your fault.

460
00:36:56,497 --> 00:37:00,558
Maggie, she shot an embolism.
These things take years.

461
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:03,398
They build up...

462
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:05,995
No, but then I took this case.

463
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:12,979
You know, Nick, all my life,
whatever I wanted, she was always there.

464
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:17,211
She's always been there for us and
the one time she asked me to do something...

465
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,377
No, no, no. Come on.

466
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,380
You can't blame yourself for that.

467
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:29,087
That's not what she would have wanted.

468
00:37:29,196 --> 00:37:31,528
OK?

469
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,658
Yeah.

470
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,329
- I gotta go home.
- No.

471
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:41,740
I think what you gotta do is stay here
and be here with your father.

472
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,572
He'll be fine, Nick.
He's got you.

473
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,171
He's got me, yeah, but he needs you.

474
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:50,615
He needs you, Maggie.

475
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:52,515
Nick!

476
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:57,550
Laura's looking for you.

477
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:03,358
Take your dish.

478
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:07,961
Thanks for coming.

479
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:10,128
See you.

480
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:23,945
I never knew she kept this.

481
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,215
My jelly-jar glass.

482
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:33,883
Do you remember when she boycotted grape
jelly in sympathy with the farm workers?

483
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:39,062
Yeah. And all I'd eat was peanut butter
and grape jelly sandwiches.

484
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,401
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

485
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,633
I solved the problem, though.
Or at least I thought I did.

486
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,733
I found a grape jelly without
any grapes in it. All chemicals.

487
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:55,746
- She'd never let you eat that.
- No. But it put her in a moral dilemma.

488
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:59,308
Should she satisfy a demanding child
with an affront to human rights

489
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,354
or cop out to toxic sludge?

490
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:06,452
- What did she do?
- She introduced me to marmalade.

491
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:10,528
Hey, Jed. Give a call.

492
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:12,861
OK. Thanks.

493
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:20,465
What a mess.

494
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:26,207
Your mom was always
in charge of organization.

495
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:52,829
She had a dental appointment today?

496
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,766
- How fast was that, Dr Getchell?
- 30mph.

497
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:30,738
That's amazing.
Just amazing.

498
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:37,450
Isn't that amazing, Maggie?
All that damage forjust going 30.

499
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:39,416
Yeah.

500
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,084
Well, there's gonna be damage till
we can figure out a way to make cars bounce.

501
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:57,794
- Do you test every model this way?
- Every model, every year.

502
00:40:57,905 --> 00:40:59,930
Feds say we got to.

503
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,443
Course, this is only one test.
We do 77 others.

504
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,604
Don't want no surprises.

505
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:10,583
That's what gets my goat
about this damn lawsuit.

506
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:14,143
What you got here is just about
the safest damn car on the road.

507
00:41:14,255 --> 00:41:16,587
- You'll say that on the stand?
- Hell, yes.

508
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:18,750
But don't stop with me.

509
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:23,294
- What's this?
- Meridian performance charts.

510
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:28,232
The '85 model exceeded
every federal standard that year.

511
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:30,395
- Plus...
- Plus?

512
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:33,596
- Plus Rowena.
- Who's Rowena?

513
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:35,574
Not who. What.

514
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:39,340
An independent research facility.
The car passed every test.

515
00:41:47,854 --> 00:41:53,121
- I can't find my keys.
- You're late. I need you to chop ze onions.

516
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:57,527
- Aren't we going out for dinner?
- No, I'm making your mom's menudo.

517
00:41:57,631 --> 00:41:59,690
You're cooking?

518
00:42:02,836 --> 00:42:07,102
- How many tablespoons in a teaspoon?
- Do I look like a calculator?

519
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:11,337
- Maybe I should make something.
- Oh ho ho! No, thank you.

520
00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:13,503
I prefer to die in ze bed.

521
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:19,777
Is this supposed to look like this?

522
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:22,151
- Jesus!
- What?

523
00:42:22,222 --> 00:42:24,656
No, nothing.

524
00:42:24,724 --> 00:42:28,125
So I just left everything the way it was.

525
00:42:28,228 --> 00:42:30,662
- Have you finished?
- Yeah.

526
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:36,635
- Not bad for a couple of lawyers.
- Yeah, it wasn't your mother's but...

527
00:42:36,703 --> 00:42:41,367
- It was great.
- I just wanted some of her smell around.

528
00:42:44,077 --> 00:42:47,808
I got some of your mom's things packed up.
I figured you might like 'em.

529
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:50,179
- Yes. Yes.
- Wanna see 'em?

530
00:42:52,485 --> 00:42:55,318
Oh, no. Oh my God!

531
00:42:55,388 --> 00:42:57,982
Look at all your hair!

532
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,826
You had a beautiful mother, Magpie.
Look at that. My God.

533
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:08,599
Magpie?

534
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:11,899
You haven't called me that since...
I must have been 12.

535
00:43:12,005 --> 00:43:14,701
Yeah.

536
00:43:14,774 --> 00:43:17,174
- The prettiest, smartest...
- Yeah.

537
00:43:17,243 --> 00:43:20,269
...mouthiest kid.

538
00:43:25,085 --> 00:43:29,454
- Ah, the People's Park Festival.
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:31,387
- 1967, '68.
- Yeah.

540
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,738
They don't make marches like they used to.

541
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:49,036
Do you remember this?

542
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:55,446
No, only what I read in the paper.
You left Mom and me at home. Of course.

543
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:57,641
I'd just turned 13.

544
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:02,385
My first boyfriend had dumped me.
And I could have used you.

545
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:06,492
Young love was always
your mother's line, Margaret.

546
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:09,926
I was busy trying to keep
the planet in one piece.

547
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:11,964
Burning a few bras in the process.

548
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:14,556
I was more interested
in burning draft cards.

549
00:44:14,634 --> 00:44:18,331
Really? I thought you were more
interested in the women's movement.

550
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,436
Relationships were more casual
in those days. It was just more open.

551
00:44:25,512 --> 00:44:29,278
Oh, please!
I'm so tired of the '60s crap.

552
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:32,147
I was on the road for six,
nine months at a time.

553
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,585
None of this ever meant anything to me.

554
00:44:38,024 --> 00:44:41,255
Not even Alice Worth?

555
00:44:53,006 --> 00:44:55,941
So that's it? Case dismissed?

556
00:44:56,009 --> 00:45:01,504
- You're out of order, counselor.
- And you are guilty as charged.

557
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,050
Alice Worth was my law partner.

558
00:45:06,152 --> 00:45:10,714
Oh, please, Dad!
You think I didn't know?

559
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:15,659
- This is none of your business, goddamnit!
- Alice Worth was very much my business!

560
00:45:15,728 --> 00:45:19,824
She wasn'tjust some nameless one-nighter.

561
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:24,734
Alice was a friend.
She was Mom's friend. Mine.

562
00:45:25,405 --> 00:45:30,809
She was everything I wanted to be.
She was smart and beautiful and a lawyer.

563
00:45:30,877 --> 00:45:36,042
I used to follow her around in here, to watch
how she'd cross her legs or hold her drink,

564
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:38,344
and then Mom finds her letters to you.

565
00:45:43,389 --> 00:45:47,257
She never cried in front of me.
She wouldn't do that.

566
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,022
But when she thought I was asleep,
I could hear her.

567
00:45:50,096 --> 00:45:53,190
Alone in her room,
sometimes three, four in the morning.

568
00:45:54,067 --> 00:46:00,836
- I'm really tired of this ancient history.
- She was never the same after that!

569
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,204
Something in her eyes went dead.

570
00:46:03,276 --> 00:46:07,372
Margaret, you have to know
that I was committed to your mother.

571
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:12,749
No. In one fell swoop,
you took away the woman I admired,

572
00:46:12,852 --> 00:46:15,878
the mother I knew
and the father I believed in.

573
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:20,348
The conscience of America.
Defender of the huddled masses!

574
00:46:20,426 --> 00:46:23,190
The only thing you cared
about the huddled masses

575
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:25,925
was how tall you could stand
on their shoulders!

576
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:29,058
- Wait a minute. There's more to this...
- I'm going.

577
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:32,036
- Wait. I spent my life trying to help people.
- Oh, yeah?

578
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:36,371
Got any thank-you notes
from Jack Tagallini recently?

579
00:46:36,442 --> 00:46:39,377
Margaret! I had nothing to do with that.

580
00:46:39,445 --> 00:46:42,209
Oh, yeah?
I think you're being a little modest.

581
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:45,149
Before you met Jack Tagallini,
he was just a nice guy,

582
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:47,879
pissed off at the cost
overruns at Zembella Air.

583
00:46:47,954 --> 00:46:52,220
- It never occurred to him to go public.
- He didn't know how. I had to show him how.

584
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:57,389
<i>You forced him! Or conned him! Or whatever
it is you do to get on the cover of Newsweek.</i>

585
00:46:57,463 --> 00:47:00,398
Oh, Jesus Christ!

586
00:47:00,466 --> 00:47:05,301
<i>I was on the cover of Newsweek
because I was right. Goddamnit!</i>

587
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:10,240
Thatjury was out for two hours and 27
minutes. They gave us every single point.

588
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:13,074
But what about Jack Tagallini?

589
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:17,242
You turned him into a whistle-blower
without telling him what it would cost.

590
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:20,480
He lost his job, all of his friends,
his professional life.

591
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:25,650
That case changed the law! It affects
every single person who gets on an airplane.

592
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:28,454
- You stopped taking his calls.
- I helped him.

593
00:47:28,528 --> 00:47:30,996
- No, you dumped him!
- The world keeps turning.

594
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:33,361
I had other people to help.

595
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:34,865
You dumped him!

596
00:47:36,536 --> 00:47:38,800
I couldn't hold his fucking hand, OK?

597
00:47:38,871 --> 00:47:42,932
No, you didn't hold a hand unless
it was young, female and attractive!

598
00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:46,206
You're a user, Dad.
You used Tagallini and all those women

599
00:47:46,312 --> 00:47:48,837
and you used Mom!

600
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:51,877
Goddamned hypocrite.

601
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,178
How dare you question my behavior?

602
00:47:55,288 --> 00:47:59,122
You, whose claim to fame is being
one of Quinn Califan's young Nazis.

603
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:01,353
My clients don't blow their brains out.

604
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:05,227
- If your mother could hear you now...
- She can't, can she?

605
00:48:05,331 --> 00:48:09,859
She got outta here. Wherever she is, she's
gotta be happier than when she was with you.

606
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:19,468
So, finally... words fail
the great Jedediah Tucker Ward.

607
00:48:19,545 --> 00:48:21,638
You get...

608
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,229
Maggie!

609
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:48,932
Maggie.

610
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:07,116
I heard you were having dinner with
your father. I figured you could use a friend.

611
00:49:07,226 --> 00:49:09,285
Oh, Michael.

612
00:49:29,982 --> 00:49:32,143
Mr Quinn is ready for you.

613
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:35,280
Thank you, Sally.

614
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,717
Maggie. Come in.

615
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:40,884
Thank you.

616
00:49:42,095 --> 00:49:44,427
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you, sir.

617
00:49:44,497 --> 00:49:48,991
- You look tired.
- No, well, I'm fine.

618
00:49:49,102 --> 00:49:54,438
When my mother died... Well, I know
how long it can take to get over.

619
00:49:54,507 --> 00:49:57,806
- With the workload you're carrying...
- I'll manage.

620
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,472
I want to believe that.
But in looking over this transcript,

621
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,915
I'm worried about
the Steven Kellen deposition.

622
00:50:05,985 --> 00:50:10,752
No. It's all completely under control.
He's wearing down.

623
00:50:10,823 --> 00:50:16,784
If he gets into court in that wheelchair
with this story, he'll be far too sympathetic.

624
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:21,357
- I understand that, Mr Quinn.
- I can't put this in strong enough terms.

625
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:24,766
I want him eliminated
as an effective witness.

626
00:50:24,837 --> 00:50:26,031
Yes, sir.

627
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:30,798
- Are you prepared to do that?
- Absolutely.

628
00:50:36,949 --> 00:50:38,974
Then you won't mind if I sit in?

629
00:50:39,485 --> 00:50:41,817
No. No.

630
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:44,521
Great.

631
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:50,387
Now, Mr Kellen, when the paramedics
were pulling you out of the vehicle,

632
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,130
how did it feel to be on fire?

633
00:50:53,299 --> 00:50:56,029
For Godsakes,
you just asked me that question.

634
00:50:56,135 --> 00:50:59,662
No, sir, I believe I asked you
if you remembered being on fire.

635
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:02,674
And I asked you,
when did you know you were on fire?

636
00:51:02,742 --> 00:51:07,008
And now I'm asking,
how did it feel to be on fire?

637
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,011
It was...

638
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,743
Maggie, I'm warning you,
we are already halfway out the door here.

639
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:17,812
Mr Kellen, were you ever a patient
of a Dr Maxwell Chastain?

640
00:51:19,992 --> 00:51:22,051
Maybe. So?

641
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:24,921
Yes or no, please.

642
00:51:25,031 --> 00:51:26,089
Yes.

643
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,000
Is Dr Chastain a psychologist
specializing in car phobias?

644
00:51:32,038 --> 00:51:34,529
- Is he, Mr Kellen?
- Yes.

645
00:51:35,274 --> 00:51:38,607
As I understand it, a car phobia
means you're afraid of driving. True?

646
00:51:40,012 --> 00:51:42,776
It's not as simple as that.

647
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:45,578
What's not simple?
Whether it's true or it's false?

648
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:48,077
I guess it's true.

649
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:50,747
Which makes you cautious,
maybe too cautious?

650
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,849
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Noted.

651
00:51:53,926 --> 00:51:56,417
The car blew up.
How can you be too cautious?

652
00:51:56,529 --> 00:51:59,623
Technically, it burst into flames.

653
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:07,202
Prior to the accident, how many times
have you been cited for driving too slow?

654
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:10,970
- Twice.
- Are you sure it wasn't three times?

655
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:14,945
Here we have December of '81,
August of '83, then again in October.

656
00:52:15,047 --> 00:52:17,140
Objection. This is beyond the scope...

657
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,583
Have you had any other accidents
in the last five years?

658
00:52:20,653 --> 00:52:24,248
- Don't answer that.
- If he doesn't, he answers in front of ajury.

659
00:52:24,323 --> 00:52:27,952
Look, they weren't my fault.
Other people hit me.

660
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,086
- I wonder why.
- Do you really?

661
00:52:31,163 --> 00:52:34,997
- Do you even care what happened?
- I know what happened, Mr Kellen.

662
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:39,094
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no. My God.

663
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:41,935
And so do you.

664
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:46,069
I don't believe this, I don't believe this.

665
00:52:46,145 --> 00:52:48,170
We're out of here. Come on.

666
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:51,614
Who the hell do you think you are?
This wasn't my fault.

667
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:54,744
- This deposition is finished.
- Are you fucking human?

668
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,947
Do you care, Miss Ward, about anybody?

669
00:52:57,023 --> 00:52:59,321
Nick, please.

670
00:53:07,033 --> 00:53:09,126
Nice pictures. Real nice.

671
00:53:14,307 --> 00:53:18,266
What's a good set of 8"x 10"s cost
these days? 10, 15 bucks?

672
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:23,346
This is important, Fred.

673
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:26,316
What's the going rate
for a man's dignity, huh?

674
00:53:26,385 --> 00:53:29,479
You stole his wife, his kid, his body.

675
00:53:29,555 --> 00:53:34,219
Now I guess you spend another 10 or 15
dollars and get the whole package?

676
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:39,060
That's what this is about, money. He's after
your money and you're out to protect it.

677
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:42,328
Well, you hold onto it real tight

678
00:53:42,401 --> 00:53:47,134
because without a heart and soul,
that's all you'll ever have.

679
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:55,178
Jed, we have angles like this
on all your people.

680
00:53:55,247 --> 00:53:59,081
Bottom line, you don't want to try this case.

681
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:08,418
Kellen had me out there,
buck naked in a hailstorm.

682
00:54:08,527 --> 00:54:12,327
I need better information from you.
We got four weeks before the trial.

683
00:54:12,398 --> 00:54:15,925
- 242 people worked on the design of that car.
- I know this.

684
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:20,233
So there are 242 chances
for you people to do something right.

685
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:25,709
- Most of them don't wanna talk with us.
- That's just excuses.

686
00:54:25,778 --> 00:54:29,874
Hold on a second. You always go on about
the great David and Goliath cases.

687
00:54:29,949 --> 00:54:32,782
It seems you've forgotten
how hard the David work is.

688
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:39,051
We have worked very hard. If you cannot
see that, maybe we aren't the problem here.
