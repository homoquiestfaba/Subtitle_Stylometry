her daughter was missing.

early for a statewide ATL.

175

to all the other officers

00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,450
and police are now asking
for your help.

181
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,360
Jennifer Richards was
shopping with her mother

182
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,130
in a local department
store when she disappeared.

183
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,400
She is 7 years old,4'2",
Weighs about 65 pounds

184
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,370
and has long brown hair...

185
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,500
We're gonna find her.

186
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,850
[soft music playing]

187
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,380
Has anything, that you know,
occurred at home?

188
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
Like a fight
with her sister,

189
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,380
or maybe some trouble
at school.

190
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,680
I'm sorry, Mrs. Richards

191
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,650
we think it's possible
your daughter ran away.

192
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,860
This is ridiculous.

193
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,060
You don't know her.

194
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,960
You don't know us!

195
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,230
I'm not trying to pass judgment
on you and your family,

196
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,760
Mrs. Richards, but,
given the circumstances

197
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,700
it's the most plausible
explanation.

198
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,770
Get out!

199
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,770
Now Wait a minute...

200
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,640
Both of you get out!

201
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,410
I'm going to call the police
chief and get someone

202
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,010
on this case who
can find my daughter!

203
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,240
You are Wasting Mme!

204
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,480
Wasting time!

205
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,050
Look, there's a reason
Why We're thinking this.

206
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,110
Don't you Wanna know?

207
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,790
(Weber)
Come on, Temple, let's go.

208
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,790
Wait! Wait.

209
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,220
Anything you know
I Want to hear?

210
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,730
I'M come right
to the point.

211
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,390
We've got a Witness.

212
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,100
We talked to a clerk
in the store who saw

213
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,500
a little girl walk into
the woods behind the mall.

214
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,770
Are you absolutely sure
it was her?

215
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,100
No, but the time frame fits,

216
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,470
and, frankly, he's the only
Witness we've got.

217
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,510
Look, if somebody took
your daughter out of the store,

218
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,210
against her Will,
nobody saw anything unusual.

219
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,410
No yelling, no screaming.

220
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,820
Just her dress on the floor
like she dropped it and ran off.

221
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,020
I can see why you might
think that, but,

222
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,690
believe me, I'm her mother,
she would not have run away.

223
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,360
She was excited
to be there.

224
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,130
She was picking out a dress.

225
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,370
I mean, she was happy.

226
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,510
I'm gonna keep
every possibility open.

227
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:49,040
Every cop on the street's
got his eye out for her.

228
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,050
And We'll search everywhere,
including the Woods.

229
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,210
(Searchers)
Jennifer! Jennifer!

230
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,880
(Dad) Thanks, mom, I just feel like
Gods really with us right now.

231
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,920
I've never really
felt that Way before.

232
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,970
I know.

233
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,840
You Know what I think
We should do right now.

234
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,580
I think We should pray.

235
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,380
I don't know if I can pray.

236
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,080
Why not?

237
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,180
I love her morn
I really do.

238
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,150
I prayed that I'd get
more of the attention,

239
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,120
but I didn't want
this to happen.

240
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,720
Oh, honey, this didn't
happen because of you.

241
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,830
It's not your fault.

242
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,140
Cara, put your hand,
right over your heart,

243
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,400
and I want you to feel
deep down inside.

244
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,080
I just Know she's
going to be back.

245
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,680
And she's going
to be up here

246
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,050
and she's going to be
singing and laughing,

247
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,180
and telling stones.

248
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,020
We're going to be
one big happy family.

249
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,090
I promise you.

250
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,290
But Mom...

251
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,020
I promise you.

252
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,660
I miss her.

253
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,110
I miss her, too.

254
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,390
Well?

255
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,820
I talked to search
and rescue.

256
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,360
They're going to send
the dogs up over that ridge

257
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,460
about a mile back.

258
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,630
Are We gonna go
join them then'?

259
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,930
The Guards going
to be here soon.

260
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,260
Let's Wait for them.

261
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,770
Hey, did you see
the paper this morning?

262
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,830
I got quoted.

263
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,330
If We don't find her soon,

264
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,840
We'll have to assume
the Worst"?

265
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,210
I'm sure that made
everybody feel better.

266
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,610
Well, What should
I have said'?

267
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,580
Don't Worry folks,
We'll find her"?

268
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,810
You could have said
something hopeful, at least.

269
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,080
Like What?

270
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,120
I don't know.

271
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,420
I wish we had something
The kid just vanished.

272
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,920
Vanished into thin air.
Now there's your quote

273
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,990
We've been out here for days
searching these woods,

274
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,490
and We haven't
found a thing.

275
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,290
Ya Know that
was a false lead.

276
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,400
It's the only lead
We've got.

277
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,260
Besides, if We don: cover
this ground with the dogs-..

278
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,730
That's the easy Way out.

279
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,700
Ya know, nobody Wants
to face up to the truth.

280
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,200
And that is that a little
girl was abducted

281
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,070
from Rapid City,
South Dakota.

282
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,670
Now if we don't start
facing those facts

283
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,270
and start looking
in that direction,

284
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,680
then We're just
Wasting our time.

285
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,180
But if you want to keep
looking out here,

286
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,380
I guess that's What
We're going to do.

287
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,880
If this was
a stranger abduction

288
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,690
she was dead the night
she disappeared.

289
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,290
Come on, Man,
you Know the statistics.

290
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,430
That's why I keep
hoping she ran away

291
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,000
At least that Way
she has a chance.

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,740
I refuse to give up.

293
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,870
I've seen some incredible
things on this job.

294
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,010
And We can always Keep
praying for a miracle.

295
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,780
(Pastor) Dear Lord, please
give us the strength

296
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,450
to make it through every day,
and the faith to Know

297
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,860
that you're with us,
and with our Jennifer.

298
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,730
Through all the pain
and the doubts.

299
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,960
In Jesus name We pray,
Amen.

300
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,700
(AH) Amen.

301
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,910
We Know she's
going to be back.

302
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,220
Our faith is strong.

303
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,750
(Women) Hi Shana.

304
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,620
Hi.

305
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,020
We just stopped
by to let you know

306
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,750
that We're thinking about you
and We wanted to bring you

307
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,490
a few things to share-
just to let you Know

308
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,160
that you're in our thoughts
and in our prayers,

309
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,530
and if there's anything
at all that we can do,

310
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,890
please don:
hesitate to call.

311
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,430
Thanks.
I appreciate that.

312
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,000
Why don: you
all come on in'?

313
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,940
Hey Billy.

314
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,470
Ya got a minute?

315
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,470
Oh, hey buddy.

316
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,780
I was Wondering
if you don't mind

317
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,380
if you could hang
some of these fliers up

318
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,310
for me at the plant.

319
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,410
Well sure, absolutely.

320
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,420
I really
appreciate your help.

321
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,320
Would you like to come in
and sit down for a little bit'?

322
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,090
Well, I better not.
I've got to get going.

323
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,760
Hey, thanks again.

324
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,500
Glad to do it.

325
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,500
Shana!

326
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,140
Hi.

327
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,910
Gosh, I didn't know
you'd be out.

328
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,750
I picked up some
groceries for you.

329
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,080
But since you're here

330
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,550
Why don't you just
open up your trunk,

331
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,920
and We'll put them right in.

332
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,280
Look, that's really
sweet of you,

333
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,190
but you can't afford this.

334
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,060
Sharia, I'm your friend.

335
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,420
I'm not going
to have you spending

336
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,690
your entire check
on my family.

337
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,000
Now, how much
do I owe you?

338
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,700
Bren,
I'm sorry it's just...

339
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,970
It's alright.

340
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,010
I Know what it's like
to lose someone you love.

341
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,150
She's not dead, Bren.

342
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,480
MUST Want you to know

343
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,260
that if you need someone
to talk to, I'm here.

344
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,300
Okay, thank you.
Good bye.

345
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,710
I don't suppose they have
any new leads yet?

346
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,540
No. Nothing.

347
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,310
At least they're
still looking.

348
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,780
Too bad you Weren't.

349
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,620
What?

350
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,190
Looking!
Watching her!

351
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,320
Watching Jennifer?

352
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,990
Would it have been
too much to walk with her

353
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,330
to the dressing room'?

354
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,590
What were you thinking

355
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,330
letting her go off
by herself like that'?!

356
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,370
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:00,440
Oh please, dear God,
please bring her back

358
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,680
I can: live Without her.

359
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,810
Don: make her pay
for my mistake.

360
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,790
Oh God, please
God, please.

361
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,310
Do you want me
to go in with you'?

362
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,980
Sure.

363
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,160
Okay kids, in our fifth rule
in stranger danger,

364
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,860
to help you keep
from being abducted

365
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,100
is to learn to say "no,"
loud and dear.

366
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,760
When We say "no"
to a stranger,

367
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,530
We don't just say
no, (Whisper)

368
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,840
We need to say
NO! (shout)

369
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,540
Okay, We're going
to practice that.

370
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,640
Okay, on three I Want you
to give me your best "no,"

371
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,840
your loudest "no. "

372
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,810
Okay?

373
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,910
One, two, three.

374
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,650
(Kids shout) NO!

375
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,050
Very good. I bet everybody
on the block could hear you.

376
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,350
That's the Way
you Want to say "no"

377
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,650
when you say "no"
to a stranger.

378
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,560
Okay? Thanks.

379
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,330
Tough habit to break, huh'?

380
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,830
I sure picked
the worst time to try.

381
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,200
I haven't touched one
of these in three months.

382
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,310
Right now, one of them
would taste so good.

383
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,410
I didnt come
out here to bug ya.

384
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,980
Actually, I Wanted to bring
you the list you Wanted.

385
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,650
Pedophiles and sex offenders.

386
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,450
My favorite kind
of criminals.

387
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,990
Start from the top.

388
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,420
Simple interviews.

389
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,160
If somebody squirms,
We dig deeper.

390
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,630
That's What we're
going to go off of'?

391
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,860
If somebody squirms?

392
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,230
How are you
supposed to know

393
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,730
if the guy is telling
the truth or hot'?

394
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,970
What if he's a good actor'?

395
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,700
Couldn't he act his Way
through a lie detector test'?

396
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,040
That's pretty scary.

397
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,840
No, the scariest criminal
is one who doesn't need to act

398
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,270
and doesn't think he's guilty.

399
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,450
[phone ringing]

400
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,620
Detective Weber.

401
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,520
Okay, thank you, good bye.

402
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,460
Who was that?

403
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:27,650
Who was that?

404
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,960
She said the cheekbones need
to be a little higher.

405
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,730
We can fix that.

406
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,970
Miss Sampson,
would you have Mrs. Sampson

407
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,470
tell us What she saw?

408
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,510
(Translating)
Okay, I Went to the mall

409
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:55,650
and I was looking at some
material for my craft mass.

410
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,450
And I was for looking
at all the different sales

411
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,090
and I was trying
to save some money.

412
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,230
They don't Want to hear
all that, get to the point.

413
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,570
I know. Okay.

414
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,040
(Continue translating)
I went into a store,

415
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,910
and I was looking
at some sweaters

416
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:25,010
and I saw a little girl

417
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,120
leading a blind man
to the door.

418
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,360
I Wish I could have known
that man was going to take

419
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,930
the little girl.

420
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,940
There's no Way
you could have Known.

421
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,500
L-low's it going, Jim'?

422
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,850
Well, let's see.

423
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,410
That's him, that's him!

424
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,350
(Translating) That's a
good picture of the man

425
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,020
that took the little girt.

426
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,360
Very scary.

427
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,960
Do you recognize
the face'?

428
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,060
We have a woman who
believes she saw this man

429
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,070
with your daughter
on the day she disappeared.

430
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,300
We also believe he
is pretending to be blind.

431
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,010
Do you recognize him?

432
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,690
No, I-I've never
seen this man before.

433
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,110
[dreaming]
See ya later, alligator.

434
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,780
After awhile, crocodile.

435
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:32,950
Need some help'?

436
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,360
Jennifer?

437
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:00,640
(gasping)

438
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,550
So, how long We gonna
hang around here, anyway?

439
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,750
Huh, maybe stay
the rest of the day.

440
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,990
It's a good place
to people Watch.

441
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,760
We might even come
back tomorrow.

442
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,890
Why?

443
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,990
Don't you just think
We're Wasting our time?

444
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,430
I mean,
What are the odds

445
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,230
he's going to try
the same stunt again?

446
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't know, but I'm not
going to be the one

447
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,710
to give him
another chance.

448
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,210
I don't understand how
a human being can be so sick.

449
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,040
Satan rules, partner.

450
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,710
This guy's just business
as usual for that old boy.

451
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,350
Sorry, I don: believe
in the devil.

452
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,320
Oh, you don't believe the dew
Walks the streets, huh?

453
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,990
Especially not in
a little town like Rapid'?

454
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,790
Tell ya what, I'll give you
a few more years on this job.

455
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,560
The next time you scrape
some poor, drunk,

456
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,460
dead teenager
out of the inside of a car,

457
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,630
or Watch some guy
blow his Wife away?

458
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,230
Well, son, you just
tripped over him.

459
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,400
Well, son, you just
tripped over him.

460
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,540
Personally, I just think people
control their own lives.

461
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,940
I don't see a guy
with horns and a tail

462
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,870
controlling people's lives.

463
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,640
Ya know What I mean?

464
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,620
Temple...

465
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,840
I couldn't find him
Is he outside'?

466
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,480
Nowhere.

467
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,650
There!

468
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,170
Stop, police!

469
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,630
Take him, Temple!

470
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,100
(Blind Man)
Emily! Emily!

471
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,950
(Emily)
Daddy!

472
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,380
This is pathetic!

473
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,750
Mr. Blake,
you have to understand,

474
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,720
this has been frustrating
for us as well.

475
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,890
We have a Witness who
gives us a composite drawing

476
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,360
that looks like you exactly.

477
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,660
You guys have me confused
with somebody else.

478
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,830
Possibly...

479
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,300
but that's why I want to talk
to you for a little while.

480
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,000
That is alright
isn't it'?

481
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,030
Yeah, sure.

482
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,470
He checks out.

483
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,400
Turns out he's been
blind since childhood.

484
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,240
That's his little
daughter, Emily.

485
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,540
He has a Wife, Cynthia.

486
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,040
She's pretty mad.

487
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,740
She's coming
over right now.

488
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,980
Ya know, I think we're
missing something here.

489
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,780
I think we have got the guy
in the composite drawing.

490
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,620
How so?

491
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,590
Mr. Blake, do you ever come
shopping by yourself?

492
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,790
No.

493
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,630
I always go with my wife
or a friend,

494
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,000
or sometimes my daughter
and I take the bus.

495
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,700
Was there a time when you got
separated, recently,

496
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,940
and needed help
getting out of the store'?

497
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,840
Specifically
Allen's Clothing Store

498
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,410
on the afternoon of Friday,
August 8th'?

499
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:35,010
I can't remember the date
or the store, but, yeah.

500
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:40,190
Yeah, I got turned around
a couple of Weeks ago.

501
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,290
I was with my daughter,
Emily.

502
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,260
She left me
for some reason

503
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,900
and, I thought I could find
my Way to the front door,

504
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,270
but I just got
turned around.

505
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,800
But finally,
I found my Way out

506
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,140
and that was it.

507
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,480
How did you get back'?
Did someone help you'?

508
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,210
Yeah,yeah
a little girl.

509
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,250
She helped me
find the exit.

510
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,080
That's all I know.

511
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,250
Can I go now?

512
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,620
Listen, I Want to thank you
and your daughter both

513
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,690
for your cooperation
this afternoon.

514
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,900
And I apologize for
the misunderstandings.

515
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,030
Come on, honey,
let's go.

516
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,110
Let's go meet mom.

517
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,240
Wait a minute.

518
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,010
I just remembered something.

519
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,820
When We got to the door.

520
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,290
She said hello
to somebody.

521
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,350
Somebody she recognized.

522
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:51,930
She said "Hi"...

523
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,930
[thinking]

524
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:08,320
I can't remember--
sorry.

525
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:23,990
[dramatic music]

526
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,250
[whistle blows]

527
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,720
[dramatic music]

528
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,100
[thinking]
Well, look who's here.

529
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:55,180
(baby crying)

530
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,620
(Pastor) I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

531
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:08,690
and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

532
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,370
May God bless
and protect this baby.

533
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,690
May God bless
and protect this baby.

534
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,710
(crying) God, I had to bury
my beautiful baby today.

535
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,340
That is the hardest thing
I have ever had to do.

536
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,950
And I don't understand.

537
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,180
I prayed to you.

538
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,620
I believed in you.

539
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,190
I believed you'd
protect her.

540
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,790
(shouting) Don't you have
anything to say to me now?

541
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:46,010
[dramatic music]

542
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,310
Ready to go?

543
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,540
Yeah, let's go.

544
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,810
This place gives me
the creeps.

545
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,680
I can: close this case.

546
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,820
Not yet.

547
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,320
What are you looking for?

548
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,620
Answers, resolution,
a reason Why a 7 year-old girl

549
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,130
was found dead in the middle
of the Woods.

550
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,960
I didn't think
that was still a question.

551
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,070
She fell 13' from that ledge
and broke her neck.

552
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,170
Yes.

553
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,510
She was running. Why?

554
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,580
She was scared.
It was getting dark.

555
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,850
We don't know the reasons
Why she was out here,

556
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,150
but it Wasn't because
she was abducted.

557
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,550
No one was chasing her.

558
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,920
How do you know?

559
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,490
The autopsy report.

560
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,230
There were no signs
of abuse.

561
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,760
And Why are you changing
your mind anyway?

562
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,330
From the very beginning
of this case,

563
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,000
The blind man
she helped in the mall,

564
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,710
the person
she recognized outside...

565
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,210
There's more places to this
than We've put together.

566
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,680
We close this case now,

567
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,710
we could be letting
a murderer go free.

568
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,820
Gary...

569
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,850
What about her necklace?

570
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,580
A Mme gold cross.

571
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,050
It Wasn't on her body,

572
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,990
and it hasn't been found
anywhere since.

573
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,190
Look, Gary,
just hold it.

574
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,560
There's no conflict here.

575
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,900
There's two miles
from the mall to here.

576
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,940
It could have
fallen off anywhere.

577
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,100
The person she met
outside of the mall,

578
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,110
the one she recognized,
it could have been a friend.

579
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,550
Someone who egged
her on to run away.

580
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,810
We don't Know
all the details,

581
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:32,590
but We know enough.

582
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,290
Don't drag this out.

583
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,330
If you start
chasing phantoms

584
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,260
it's going
to hurt everyone.

585
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,330
Let it go.

586
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,780
[dramatic music]

587
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,200
Hi. It's been awhile.

588
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,430
It's good
to see you again.

589
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:57,500
I'm sorry about
What happened.

590
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,580
I guess God just needed
a little girl in heaven.

591
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,110
So Where's your wife
is she corn--

592
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,060
She didnt come today.

593
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:19,550
[dramatic music]

594
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,310
How do you do it, Bren?

595
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,120
How do you get
through each day?

596
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:20,720
Oh, it's not
always easy.

597
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,290
I pray a lot.

598
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,230
Sometimes when I'm
really missing them,

599
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:33,330
I hold their picture
to my heart

600
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:36,170
and I pretend that
We're still together,

601
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,700
we're still a family,
and you Know What?

602
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,480
We still are.

603
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,010
I will never forget them.

604
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,750
You don't have
to forget about them

605
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,050
to get over the pain.

606
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,390
There's some pain
that will never go away.

607
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,390
That's just
the Way it is.

608
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:04,330
Sometimes I hurt so bad,

609
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,970
I think my heart's just going
to break right in two,

610
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,740
and that's when
I ask God for comfort,

611
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,510
and He's there for me.

612
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,370
He puts his arms
around me,

613
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:19,050
and He comforts me.

614
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:24,650
I'm not too happy
with God right now.

615
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,390
To tell you the truth,
my faith is shattered.

616
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,060
I'm not even
sure He exists.

617
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,400
I was angry with God
for a long time.

618
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,430
I couldn't understand
how He could-

619
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,870
how He could let
the accident happen.

620
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,040
Why didnt He give my husband
the strength to steer away.

621
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,340
Why didnt He
protect my son

622
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,150
when that car
sideswiped them?

623
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,750
I was angry
with myself, too.

624
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,820
See, they had gone out
for pizza that night,

625
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,020
and I Wanted some stamps.

626
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,190
So I asked them to swing by
the supermarket

627
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,760
and to pick
them up for me.

628
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,030
It Wasn't urgent,

629
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,030
I didnt need those
stupid stamps.

630
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,330
Oh, Bren.

631
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:19,000
Ya Know
that drunk driver'?

632
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,940
He was killed
in the accident, too.

633
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,510
I was so angry with him.

634
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:28,950
Death was too good
for him.

635
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:32,220
I envisioned his soul
burning in hell.

636
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,690
That's Where he belongs.

637
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,160
No, I felt that Way, too,

638
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,660
for almost two years
after the accident,

639
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,670
Something I'll
never forget.

640
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,700
I was sitting
in the park one day

641
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:57,340
just listening to the wind blow
through the trees.

642
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,050
I realized someone
was sitting down next to me.

643
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,460
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it.

644
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:15,360
The sun feels good
on my face.

645
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,370
You're happy, then?

646
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:24,010
I'm okay.

647
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,020
Something Wrong?

648
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,020
A few years back,

649
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,160
a young man was killed
in a czar wreck.

650
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,900
He'd been drinking.

651
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:56,800
His czar hit another,
and two people were killed

652
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,980
a father and a son.

653
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:08,980
That young man was my son.
I'm Charles's mother.

654
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,860
My name is Anne.

655
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,360
I don't--maybe I--
maybe I raised him Wrong,

656
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,100
and I wasn't enough
of a mother for him,

657
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,270
but ever since that day,
I've carried this pain

658
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:37,210
that somehow I was
responsible for those deaths.

659
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:41,950
It saddens me to Know how
much hurt you feel,

660
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,450
how much you've
been through.

661
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:51,450
But please, he was a good kid,
and I loved him very much.

662
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,800
It's been a weight on my heart
for so very long.

663
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,670
I need for you to know
how sorry I am

664
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:11,380
for everything that's
happened to you.

665
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,280
Can you please forgive me

666
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,780
for not being
the greatest mom,

667
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,790
but more important can you
please forgive my son.

668
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:26,330
If he was here right now

669
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:33,240
he would Want to Know
that he was forgiven.

670
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,780
(Bren off screen) Something
inside me lifted that day.

671
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,750
Anger Id been carrying
around with me for two years

672
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,720
started to disappear.

673
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,590
And I forgave that Woman,
and I forgave her son.

674
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:04,900
That's when the healing
really began.

675
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:10,970
Forgiving him allowed me
to rebuild my faith in God,

676
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,040
and lime by little

677
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,320
I started to pick up
the pieces.

678
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:53,850
Hi, sweetheart.

679
00:48:53,850 --> 00:49:00,820
I don't think Springs
ever going to come.

680
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,020
I miss you.

681
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:08,160
We all miss you so much.

682
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:16,400
I can't make myself
understand What happened.

683
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,210
It makes no sense
to me Why you're gone.

684
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:24,810
You should be here.

685
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:27,950
I Want to check
on you at night,

686
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:32,080
and make sure you're
sleeping safely in your bed.

687
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,390
I Want to tuck you in.

688
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:39,560
I Want to read
you stones.

689
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,070
We should be building
a snowman today.

690
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,940
I'm just probably
being selfish.

691
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,910
I can: even begin to imagine
what you went through.

692
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:03,720
How scared
you must have been.

693
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,750
I'm sorry.

694
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:12,930
Mommy's so sorry.

695
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:22,400
Oh God, how am I supposed
to deal with all this hurt'?

696
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,540
[dramatic music]

697
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,090
Gary, there you are.

698
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,960
You wanted to see me
what's going on'?

699
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,300
I'm thinking about
closing the Richards case.

700
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,500
Well good.

701
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,300
Is there a reason
We kept it open this long'?

702
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,900
I don't know.
Nothing specific.

703
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,370
My gut's just
bothering me.

704
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,870
Take something for it.
It's time to get over this.

705
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,280
I just find it

I think it's time We
blindfolded you, young lady.

884
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:19,150
Okay, you wait here
alright?

885
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,020
[sound of tape peeling]

886
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,630
Billy, what was that'?

887
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,400
Wait!

888
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:49,480
Jennifer--wait!
Jennifer!

889
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:20,170
[dramatic music]

890
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:12,260
Step back!
Stay back!

891
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:17,670
Go on,
go to your mother. Go!

892
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,980
Lay down on the ground!

893
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,850
Mom, it was Billy.

894
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,160
What?

895
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:48,000
Put your left
hand behind your back!

896
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:55,630
Ma'am, stay back!
Stay back!

897
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:57,500
Stay--no, no!

898
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,700
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

899
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,440
How could he do that?

900
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,950
I already
submitted my report.

901
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:18,360
The Department's not
gonna give you more than

902
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,860
a slap on the Wrist.

903
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,360
Not that you don't
deserve more.

904
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:26,000
I'm real disappointed in
the guy I asked for a partner.

905
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,240
So how long they gonna
keep ya in here for'?

906
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,570
I don't know.

907
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:37,110
I bruised my spine,
so it could be a couple days.

908
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,750
Looks like you bruised
your ego, too.

909
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,980
Where'd We go Wrong?

910
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,390
What?

911
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:48,590
It's just stupid.

912
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:51,260
The guy tried the same thing
twice with the family.

913
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,620
I mean, how come We
didnt see it coming?

914
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:56,900
It was a real tough case
Lots of emotion.

915
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:01,400
Some false leads
real complicated.

916
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,570
We didn't catch it

917
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:09,480
because sometimes these
things don't make any sense.

918
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,540
If you try to get
inside Billy's head,

919
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,550
to figure out
What he was thinking,

920
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:21,720
and Why he did what he did
you'd get lost.

921
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,190
Both times
he acted on impulse.

922
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:27,460
He didnt follow Jennifer
out to the mall.

923
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,400
It was just blind chance
that he saw her there.

924
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,530
He saw the opportunity
and he took it,

925
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:35,800
no thought
to the consequences.

926
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,340
Then he hid behind
that friendly face.

927
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,240
And not just
from those around him

928
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,210
but from himself, too.

929
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:50,850
Just don: tell me
the Devil made him do it.

930
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:56,860
Influenced or not,
Billy made a choice.

931
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:01,330
Deep down inside himself,
he Knew what he was doing

932
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,860
and he'll be
judged for that.

933
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,700
Folks, if you could
just back up a minute.

934
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,940
The Richards family
has asked me to request

935
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,440
that the press not ask them
any questions this afternoon.

936
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,810
They do not intend to make
a statement at this time.

937
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:22,380
On behalf of the State's
Attorney's Office, though

938
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,980
We're pleased
with the plea bargain

939
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,050
Mr. Anderson has made.

940
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,950
He's going to be
sentenced in about a month.

941
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:29,760
We are going to seek the
maximum sentence available.

942
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,220
Now if you have any
additional questions

943
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:32,790
I'll try to take them
at this time.

944
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,330
Mrs. Richards,
do you feel more at peace now

945
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:36,600
that your daughter's
killer has been convicted?

946
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,900
(State' Attorney) Folks, I asked
for no questions for the family.

947
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,330
Now, if you have any more

948
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:43,000
I'll try to handle them
for you, okay'?

949
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,470
(Reporter)
Do you feel justice is served?

950
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:46,100
(State' Attorney) Yeah, I think
We got a fair plea bargain.

951
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,940
I think there's
a strong likelihood

952
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,870
for a real severe sentence
in the case,

953
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:51,910
and We obviously
saved the family

954
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:55,050
from having to go through
a long, traumatic trial.

955
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:12,830
What am I doing here.

956
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:15,640
What am I holding onto'?

957
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:39,120
She was MST a baby.

958
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:45,730
She had her whole life
ahead of her.

959
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:48,070
You're supposed to be
a father who loves and cares

960
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:51,470
for his children.

961
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:55,710
You didn't have to let him
take her away.

962
01:09:55,710 --> 01:10:01,250
Why did you?

963
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:07,420
Why did she have to die
frightened and alone?

964
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:21,930
Didn't you love my daughter?

965
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:26,250
Why didnt you love her?

966
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:40,080
[soft, piano music]

967
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,680
[Thinking]
Oh, Lord.

968
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,380
Please forgive me
for my foolishness.

969
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:47,080
I thought she
was mine forever.

970
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,760
She was always yours.

971
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,430
Thank you,
thank you for showing me

972
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,360
that she's alive with you

973
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:01,570
and for the promise that one
day We'll be together again.

974
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:04,000
You better take off,
big shot--Give me a kiss.

975
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,440
Bye, Dad.

976
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,600
Good bye.

977
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,640
Bye, sweetheart.

978
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,710
Bye, mom.

979
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:09,680
See ya when you
get home.

980
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,480
Hi.

981
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,580
Hi.

982
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,780
It's so lucky we have
Mrs. Batchelder this year.

983
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:17,890
I know.

984
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:22,120
Well, I'm
out of here too.

985
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,290
Hold it.
Wait a minute.

986
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:24,390
Do you have
your homework?

987
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,420
Do you have
your recess pass?

988
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,490
Do you have
your lunch ticket?

989
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:28,860
Do you have
all your pencils?

990
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,360
I love you.

991
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,800
I love you, too.

992
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,530
Good bye.

993
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:35,310
See you later.

994
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,810
[Thinking of Jennifer's voice]

995
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:47,350
Those are Gods hands
reaching down from heaven

996
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:50,090
to give us all
a great big hug.

997
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:58,360
[Thinking her own thoughts]

998
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,590
I Know the journey
ahead of me will not be easy.

999
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:05,460
I am not sure
if I'm ready to forgive.

1000
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,500
But, have mercy on me.

1001
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:12,570
On Lord, lead my heart
to understanding.

1002
01:13:12,570 --> 01:15:18,100
Help me to rest in the comfort
of your loving arms.

1003
