1
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,707
<i>There's the roof I put on...</i>

2
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:42,309
<i>...end of the summer.</i>

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,548
<i>And finally, after ten years,</i>
<i>capped off the peak.</i>

4
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:48,650
<i>Did you get that, Daddy?</i>

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,763
<i>It's Mason's birthday!</i>

6
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,698
<i>Turn out the light, Mas!</i>

7
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,365
<i>Mason.</i>

8
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,701
<i>How ya been, bud?</i>

9
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,135
<i>Missed ya, man.</i>

10
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,473
<i>I hope you're not</i>
<i>suffering too bad.</i>

11
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,313
<i>Copy of this tape</i>
<i>is going out to you...</i>

12
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,448
<i>...and your brothers.</i>

13
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:23,250
<i>And...</i>

14
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,554
<i>...basically a year</i>
<i>after my passing...</i>

15
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,356
...the house
is gonna be torn down.

16
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:32,125
<i>Look at me.</i>

17
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,528
<i>I already arranged for it.</i>

18
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,730
<i>It's already been paid for.</i>

19
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,198
<i>Are you excited?</i>

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,134
<i>If you wanna get</i>
<i>anything out of the house,</i>

21
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,807
<i>you need to get there soon</i>
<i>and get everything you want.</i>

22
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:53,514
When they're done,
they're gonna haul

23
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:54,682
everything to the dump.

24
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,317
And that's gonna be it.

25
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,252
Go ahead, Mas.

26
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,588
- Squirt ya?
- Shoot some.

27
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,691
Mas, can I try it?

28
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,928
No, don't get it on the lens.

29
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,396
<i>You and your brothers,</i>
<i>I hope you can agree</i>

30
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,466
<i>and maybe do something great</i>
<i>with the property.</i>

31
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,170
Good one.

32
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,576
<i>I'm sure you guys can</i>
<i>come up with something.</i>

33
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,655
<i>Other than that,</i>
<i>I just wanna say</i>

34
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:37,324
<i>I really had a good time</i>
<i>with all you guys.</i>

35
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,426
<i>We had a great thing going here.</i>

36
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,697
And...

37
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,499
...made my life great.

38
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:23,945
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you,

39
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,746
but I heard they were
tearing down this house

40
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,515
and I actually grew up here.

41
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,651
I was wondering if I could
just take a little walk around?

42
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:31,819
Uh, yeah, sure.

43
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:32,753
Thanks.

44
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,155
But the window was the door

45
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,023
and next to it was a window.

46
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:37,191
Wow.

47
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,726
- And then next to it--
- Was that porch still there?

48
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,994
Yeah, the porch was there.

49
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,896
So that was the way in before
the kitchen was there, I guess?

50
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,998
Maybe. That was
probably the original way in

51
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:47,034
because the kitchen
was an add-on years later.

52
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:49,537
So that was probably--
This was probably your kitchen

53
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,539
and that was the door
to the kitchen.

54
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,875
And we used to sit out here in
the evening in our chairs and...

55
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,611
...watch the traffic go by.

56
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:15,296
Yeah, this used to be
my bedroom.

57
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,765
When I was a little girl
I always wanted to be a teacher

58
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,633
and I would set up
all of my dolls

59
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,136
and my stuffed animals on my bed

60
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,071
and I would stand here
and I had a--

61
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:26,307
a desk that my dad
bought me.

62
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,176
And I used to pretend
that I was a teacher and...

63
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,745
...I had my books in my hand,

64
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,980
and I would teach
my dolls and my...

65
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,517
...my stuffed animals
how to read and write.

66
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:39,220
And my sister and I...

67
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,655
...always used to play
hide and seek in here, too.

68
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,690
There was...

69
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,158
...a closet in the wall.

70
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,061
Oh, there's a bee over here.

71
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:54,802
It goes back really far.

72
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,137
We used to...

73
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,205
crawl back in there and...

74
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,206
...and hide.

75
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,776
Sometimes we would hide
from our parents too,

76
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,010
if we were in trouble.

77
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,617
Looks so small now.

78
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,119
I thought it was much bigger
when I was a little girl.

79
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,059
Hey.

80
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,468
- How are you doing?
- Good.

81
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,271
- Door was locked.
- Scared me.

82
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,317
It's gonna be
happening next week.

83
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,452
You know, when they actually,
like, tear it down.

84
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:06,387
So...

85
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:16,964
I mean, it's falling apart
anyway, you know?

86
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,111
I don't know,
maybe in the future.

87
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,147
But she can hire
any one of the interns,

88
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,316
so I don't know
if it'll be me or not.

89
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,152
But I don't know if I'd
even want to work there anyway.

90
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,855
It's just, like,
really terrible to...

91
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,092
...work with artists,

92
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,228
they are just super nit-picky
about everything.

93
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,365
Like: "This isn't--
This isn't hung right."

94
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,067
Well, I mean, it makes sense.

95
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,636
- It needs to be perfect, but...
- Yeah.

96
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,103
When it's--

97
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,971
Like, I'd spend like
three hours hanging this

98
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,407
and it's like
half an inch off.

99
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:02,343
It's, like:
"Just live with it."

100
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,912
How's your work going?

101
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,247
We are not talking about that.

102
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,995
<i>It's weird dad not being here.</i>

103
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,600
I guess it's your
first time back in a while.

104
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,101
Yeah.

105
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,446
Do you want any more of this?

106
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,648
No, I'm good.

107
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,307
<i>Here it comes, Paul!</i>

108
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,510
<i>Kick it in.</i>

109
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,715
<i>He scores!</i>

110
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:41,849
<i>Yes!</i>

111
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,383
- <i>Your ball.</i>
- <i>My ball.</i>

112
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,756
<i>Here it comes, Paul!</i>

113
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,224
<i>My ball.</i>

114
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,259
<i>Your ball.</i>

115
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,895
<i>Off the wall.</i>
<i>Get it, Ryan.</i>

116
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,396
<i>Into the bushes.</i>

117
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,835
- You can play.
- Huh?

118
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,335
Go ahead,
I'll let you play.

119
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:06,273
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

120
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,518
<i>Stay right there, Paul.</i>
<i>Coming to ya.</i>

121
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:22,623
<i>Kick it in, Paul!</i>
<i>Kick it in!</i>

122
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:23,691
<i>Oh!</i>

123
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,526
<i>Score!</i>

124
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:27,662
<i>Good play, Paul!</i>

125
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,669
<i>Off the wall!</i>

126
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:56,711
<i>I got five dollars!</i>
<i>Oh, man!</i>

127
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:09,056
<i>Five dollars, put it</i>
<i>back in your envelope, Mas.</i>

128
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,758
<i>Put it back in the envelope.</i>

129
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,596
<i>Careful, you're gonna</i>
<i>break something.</i>

130
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:08,649
<i>Mason!</i>

131
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:56,998
<i>Okay, here you go.</i>
<i>Hard-boiled egg.</i>

132
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:59,499

Well, we fixed
the bathroom though.

Cool it the fuck out, man!

160
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,096
Hey, where you wanna put this?

161
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:50,497
You're holding it now.

162
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:51,699
I hate him.

163
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,635
I'm not even
eligible to vote, man.

164
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:55,537
I never registered or nothin',
you know.

165
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,105
This is it for me, man.

166
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:00,374
I just live here
and I pay my taxes.

167
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:02,744
And that's all I gotta do
is the way I see it.

168
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:05,445
<i>There is a rumor going</i>
<i>around that this is the last...</i>

169
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,748
There is a rumor
going around?

170
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:08,415
<i>Yes, there is!</i>
<i>There is a rumor that says</i>

171
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:10,384
<i>this is the last</i>
<i>of the circle J parties.</i>

172
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:13,821
<i>No, I'm trying my best</i>
<i>not to let it end.</i>

173
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,426
<i>This is a tradition.</i>

174
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:21,395
<i>And I'm a traditional kinda guy.</i>

175
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:30,464

- <i>Hey, let me play.</i>

176
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:35,903
<i>Watch.</i>

177
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:38,640
<i>I can see the thing</i>
<i>when I push the button.</i>

178
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,708
<i>See that ball right there?</i>

179
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:11,506
<i>Yo, dad's filming us fighting.</i>

180
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:15,442
<i>I got the ball!</i>

181
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,344
<i>I've got evidence now.</i>

182
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:20,715
<i>Hey, Seth...</i>

183
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:23,250
<i>Do I got the ball, Daddy?</i>

184
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:53,514
<i>Paul got it!</i>

185
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:55,248
- <i>Good job, Paul.</i>
- <i>Good try, Paul.</i>

186
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,818
<i>Come on, Sether.</i>

187
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,654
<i>Hey, what did Mom say?</i>

188
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:02,724
<i>No crying or there won't be</i>
<i>anymore Easter egg hunt.</i>

189
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,826
<i>Let's get this on tape.</i>

190
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,034
Seth.

191
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,235
<i>Same thing happened last year.</i>

192
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:04,484
- Hey.
- What's up, man?

193
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:06,353
- How are you doing?
- What's going on?

194
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,656
Not much.

195
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:15,295
That's a lot of mouse shit.

196
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,431
Yeah, can't leave it here.

197
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:19,767
What do you think?

198
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:22,003
I mean,
how are you gonna get it moving?

199
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,839
Battery. Breaks.

200
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:25,873
Just go from there.

201
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:27,575
Get it started,
see what happens.

202
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:28,509
Yeah.

203
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:30,511
I'd hate to use a tow truck.

204
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:31,779
You know?

205
00:38:31,813 --> 00:38:33,648
Can't tow it with the Ranger.

206
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:37,652
Look at the windows.
They have, like, lichen on them.

207
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:39,554
That's crazy.

208
00:38:39,587 --> 00:38:40,822
Ten years without moving.

209
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:41,756
Yeah.

210
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,737
- Yeah, nothing happens.
- Nothing.

211
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,340
kIt's gonna take some work.

212
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:03,343
We'll get there.

213
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,952
There is no, uh...

214
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:13,020
What do you call that...
tachometer.

215
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:15,089
- What's that?
- Tachometer?

216
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,658
- Nah, you don't need one.
- Yeah.

217
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:19,093
Hm.

218
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:34,742
Want to go around
and open the hood?

219
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:35,676
Sure.

220
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:44,384
Wow.

221
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:49,489
This doesn't look
like anything, like,

222
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:50,691
from a modern car.

223
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:51,792
No.

224
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:55,162
Let me know if you want--

225
00:39:56,864 --> 00:39:57,832
What was that?

226
00:39:57,865 --> 00:40:00,500
Let me know if you want
me to hold something.

227
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:03,170
Wow.

228
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:06,807
Hm.

229
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:12,146
Hey, I wanted to ask
what happened that day.

230
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:14,181
Like, when--
What happened?

231
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:16,117
Like, were you here?
Or...

232
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,085
...did you j--

233
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:24,892
I was at work.

234
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:27,795
Mm.

235
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:32,099
Did you just come home
and he was...

236
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:34,602
...on the ground there?

237
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,839
Yeah... I mean, I don't
really wanna talk about it.

238
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:43,577
Watch yourself.

239
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,721
What are you gonna do
for the rest of the day?

240
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:58,125
Get some parts.

241
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,193
Oh.

242
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:02,229
Can I tag along?

243
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:03,197
Sure.

244
00:42:21,142 --> 00:42:22,877
Are you okay with
them tearing down the house?

245
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:27,882
Yeah.

246
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,880
That looked like
the Walking Man.

247
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,250
I thought he was dead.

248
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:04,785
He is dead.

249
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:06,687
This road's haunted.

250
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,545
This was my dad's house.

251
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:20,582
Bye, Dad.

252
00:53:35,783 --> 00:53:37,852
<i>...made my life great.</i>

253
00:53:42,957 --> 00:53:44,826
[Mason screams]

254
00:58:07,688 --> 00:58:08,856
Shadow died.

255
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:12,560
Right after Mason was born.

256
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:19,133
<i>And we had to...</i>

257
00:58:19,934 --> 00:58:22,103
...a lot of videos...

258
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,805
...of Mason...

259
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:30,678
...when he was born.

260
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:35,583
Got his...

261
00:58:36,617 --> 00:58:37,918
...first steps...

262
00:58:40,287 --> 00:58:42,156
<i>...on video.</i>

263
00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:47,261
<i>Do you remember?</i>

264
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,331
<i>Were you there?</i>

265
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:52,600
<i>I was there, I remember.</i>

266
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:55,102
<i>Where were we?</i>

267
00:58:55,136 --> 00:58:56,137
Florida.

268
00:59:41,382 --> 00:59:42,917
Sorry.

269
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,228
<i>You're a moron, Seth.</i>

270
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:12,079
<i>Somebody's been back here.</i>

271
01:03:52,466 --> 01:03:53,834
Paul?

272
01:03:55,202 --> 01:03:56,303
Seth?

273
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:04,878
Hello?

274
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,585
Anyone here?

275
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:21,995
<i>Paul?</i>

276
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:24,365
<i>Seth?</i>

277
01:04:35,008 --> 01:04:36,110
Paul?

278
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:38,278
Seth?

279
01:06:17,044 --> 01:06:18,445
<i>He is so cute.</i>
<i>Here he goes.</i>

280
01:06:18,479 --> 01:06:20,147
<i>He's crawling! He's crawling!</i>

281
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,619
<i>Ah, look at this.</i>
<i>Right back into the worm.</i>

282
01:06:27,488 --> 01:06:29,456
<i>Go get Daddy.</i>
<i>Go get him.</i>

283
01:06:29,824 --> 01:06:31,291
<i>Go grab him by the leg.</i>

284
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:34,995
<i>His pants are falling down.</i>

285
01:08:54,535 --> 01:08:56,436
<i>A batman figure.</i>

286
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:59,239
<i>The second batman</i>
<i>figure of the day.</i>

287
01:08:59,272 --> 01:09:00,407
Paul.

288
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:02,677
Paul!

289
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,319
<i>Hello, Mason.</i>

290
01:10:52,352 --> 01:10:53,721
<i>How ya doing, guy?</i>

291
01:10:57,692 --> 01:11:00,427
<i>This is Mason William Owens.</i>

01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:10,538
<i>...at 6:41.</i>

296
01:11:10,571 --> 01:11:12,607
<i>Six pounds, two ounces.</i>

01:11:14,474 --> 01:11:16,309
<i>Nineteen inches long.</i>

01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:21,883
<i>Say "hi", Mas.</i>

300
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,352
<i>Can you wave for the camera?</i>

301
01:11:26,587 --> 01:11:28,055
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>
<i>That's it!</i>

302
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:30,892
<i>Say 'hi', wave to the camera.</i>

303
01:11:30,925 --> 01:11:31,926
<i>"Hi!"</i>

304
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:35,930
<i>I think he is gonna be</i>
<i>an actor when he grows up.</i>

305
01:11:35,963 --> 01:11:38,431
<i>A movie star.</i>
<i>Look at this, what a ham.</i>

306
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:39,667
<i>He is hamming it up already.</i>

307
01:11:40,535 --> 01:11:42,402
<i>Look back over this way!</i>

I think they are
tearing down the house.

316
