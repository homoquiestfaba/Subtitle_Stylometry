1
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,485
God, grant me the serenity

2
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,455
to accept the things
that I cannot change...

3
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,558
Nah, man. Back off.
I'm about to be there.

4
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,827
Yo, she's not feeling you
like that, dude.

5
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,432
The courage to change
the things that I can...

6
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:07,766
Nah, it's Stephon.
You know what I'm saying?

7
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:11,303
Just tell her I said I'm coming,
and everything's gonna be all good.
 


9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,615
And the wisdom to know the difference.

10
00:01:56,182 --> 00:02:02,121
I'm gonna return Ben's dish.
And he said he'll take me to school.
 


12
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,623
He said he'd take me the rest of
the week so you could rest, okay?

 


14
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:10,529
Okay.
Mom.
 


16
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,832
You should take this. Wear it.
No. No, no, Justin.

 

18
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:18,203
You don't have to do that.
I promise it will help. Justin, no.

 

20
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:22,341
You go to school. It's okay.
It's okay.

 

22
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:53,272
Please, help me.

23
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:57,543
And before you eat another piece
of cake, open your brother's gift.

 
 

26
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,315
Nice wrapping, Justin.
Cool, right? 
 


28
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,797
Well, you did use a lot of tape, dude.

29
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,591
A new watch?

30
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:20,899
What do I need with 
a new... it's real nice.

 


32
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,802
It's real shiny.
Mom helped pick it out.

33
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,305
It's kind of
from the both of us.

34
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:29,575
Okay, I get it.
I was late again, so a new watch.
 

36
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,377
That's not it. Open my gift.

37
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,382
Okay.

38
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,919
No. Good looking out, ma.
Look again. Look again.
 


40
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,531
Oh, man!

 

42
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:57,302
Come on! The city got new ones,
so I got a really good one second-hand.
 

44
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,939
Stop playing. Come on, now.
Oh, man. This is great.
 

46
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,576
It has a little camera, too.

47
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,245
So when you go off to college,
Mom will get us another computer

48
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,547
so we can see you and talk to you.
I thought you might like it.
 


50
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,383
And we could put it right here.
Here?
 


 

53
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,988
I thought you got it just for me.
I did get it for you.
 


55
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,291
Yeah, but it's like I got to sign for it
before I can use it or something.
 


57
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,361
Dude, come on now.

58
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,306
All I'm saying is I'm a man now.

59
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,486
I feel good.

60
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:48,587
Well...

61
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,890
Not exactly good, I guess.

62
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:58,063
I ran into this old picture
of Charles in the back of a drawer.

 


64
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:04,503
It felt good, the memory,
instead of painful.

65
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,807
He's a cutie.

66
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,611
If you want the truth, that is one sweet face.

67
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:20,018
So I feel like I'm getting there.
I'm getting to accept God's will.
 
 


69
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,889
Oh, and I brought y'all some of
my lemon squares for the break.

70
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,825
They were his favorite.
Thank you, Patrice.
 
 


72
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:34,466
Go ahead, girl.
So, we're mothers.

 

74
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,769
Our maternal instinct
is to protect our child.

75
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:43,608
And when the worst happens,
when that child is murdered,
 

77
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,848
we feel guilt, depression,
we feel we failed.
 


79
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,087
We lose our homes, our minds,
and sometimes our lives.

80
00:05:55,089 --> 00:06:02,928
So get a sponsor.
Find someone that you can talk to,
 


82
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:09,901
get out, get a hobby,
get to acceptance somehow
 


84
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,505
so that you can get on
to living, right?

85
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,445
Now, I think I see a new face.

86
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,757
I'm Lila Walcott. I'm... here.

87
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:38,530
I work for the city.
I was a clerk in public records.
 


89
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:44,669
I w... now I'm on leave.

 


91
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,139
My son Stephon was m...

92
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:53,165
Step back, please, ma'am. Ma'am?
My... I need you...
 


94
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,749
It's all right.
You don't have to say it.

95
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,187
You take your time. Stephon?
Stephon, are you with us?

 


97
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,689
Can you hear me?
Stephon!
 

99
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:11,022
I'm not gonna say that word.
You shouldn't say it. It's okay.
 


101
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:20,071
I hear y'all, but, um...
Stephon is dead, and I...

102
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,706
I want to...

103
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,812
You want him back.

104
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:34,453
Finish, Lila. You want... what?

105
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,224
To thank y'all for inviting me.

106
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,861
You're welcome.

107
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,116
Did you get a hobby yet?

108
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,489
Your son's dead, and they tell you
to start collecting stamps or something.

 


110
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,857
Well, they're just trying
to help.

111
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:16,027
Yeah, it's funny how everyone wants to
help when there's nothing they can do.

 


113
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,800
I keep getting cards, you know?
First from the detective and the reverend.
 


115
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,502
Just got another one in there.

116
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,838
Maybe that could be your hobby,
collecting cards.

117
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,576
Or getting advice.
Oh, yeah.
 
 


119
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,678
I had this interior-design job.

120
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,084
And my boss said to me, real nice,
"you can have another kid."

 


122
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:43,588
I think I heard that one.
"Well, at least you have another son."
 


124
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,925
Like I had one to spare.
Telling you, man.
 


126
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,060
Talk is meaningless.

127
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:56,301
Tell me about yours.
Then I'd be talking.
 


129
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,537
You know,
they said to get a sponsor,

130
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,072
someone to talk to,
and, uh, if you're interested...

131
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,874
In being yours?

132
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:11,816
That's sweet, but not smart.
This whole thing is not my scene.
 

134
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,219
Just being here makes me feel
fucking useless.

135
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,121
Well, wait a minute.
Maybe give it a chance.

136
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,189
I really feel like
I can talk to you.

137
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,305
Here's my number, but it's not me
you should be calling.

 


139
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,974
Well, I've called the police,
but... what about you?

140
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,276
Did they find the person...
They barely even looked.

141
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:43,748
My little girl,
she wasn't real to them.

142
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,318
So you know how it is.

143
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,587
We think about her all the time,
but nobody else does.

144
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,058
They don't think about us.
Hell, they don't even see us.
 
 

146
00:09:54,894 --> 00:10:00,506
I'll keep on it. I'll keep calling.
Yeah. Good luck with that.
 

148
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,824
Ma'am?

149
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,325
You know what? I've had a seat.
Now I've had enough.

150
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,028
I've been waiting for an hour.
Is detective Holliston even here?
 


152
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,631
Ma'am, I paged him.
Would you like to leave a message?
 

154
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,366
Detective Holliston!

155
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:37,869
Can I help you?
I called about my son's case,

 

157
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,238
and no one got back to me,
so I thought I'd come down.

158
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,074
What case is it again?

159
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,845
Y-you don't...
you don't remember me?

160
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,213
Sure, I do.

161
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,681
It's just I've got
a lot to keep track of.

162
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,317
Tell me again.
Ms. Walcott. Yeah.
 


164
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,219
You're here for an update.
If you wouldn't mind.

165
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,987
Uh, we canvassed the neighborhood,
but, sorry to say, nothing yet.

166
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,690
We're just gonna have to keep looking
till we get the break we need, ma'am.

 


168
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,692
My son was just walking
down the street.

169
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,327
I have another son.
What am I supposed to do?

170
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,862
If it were me, I'd move.

171
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,732
Ms. Walcott. Ms. Walcott, listen.

172
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,843
There's more. Just, can 
I speak to you for a minute?

 

174
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,107
Here's what we know.
We attained a lot.

175
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,944
Essentially, every corner
is a piece of property.

176
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,746
And every piece of property
has a landlord.

177
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:24,816
You work the corner, you pay rent.
We see it a lot.
  


179
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:28,319
This guy ray,
he was freelancing.

180
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,456
They warned him, they didn't
warn him, we don't know.

 


182
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,958
What we do know is
that somebody driving by

183
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,395
in a black s.u.v. took him out.
Who did? Who... who are they?

 

185
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:41,466
Nobody will tell us anything.
We see it a lot, too.
 


187
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:47,172
We need evidence.
One lead, one name.
 


189
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:50,442
Without that... you'll
forget all about it.

190
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,756
So, I went to the police.

191
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:10,161
And they don't know anything, and
they're not trying to know anything.

 


193
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:14,432
I can't stop thinking about it,
you know?

194
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,468
I mean, this is something
that goes way past

195
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,806
any kind of pain I ever felt
or experienced.

196
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,043
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

197
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:28,046
I just...

198
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,521
I want to...
We all know what you want.
 

 

200
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,991
You want to hold him again.
Yeah. You want your son back.
 


202
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,261
That's right.
You want the ones responsible.
 
 

204
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,864
You want peace.
You want to hear his voice.
 


206
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:50,902
You want a good night's sleep.
You want them to know how it feels.
 


208
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,406
I mean, we all live here, right?
And we shut it out somehow.

209
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,776
But I can't anymore.

210
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:03,848
Can you?
God, grant me the serenity
 


212
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,118
to accept the things
that I cannot change,

213
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,221
the courage to change
the things that I can,

214
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,390
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

215
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:16,027
Wisdom to know the difference.

216
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,046
Age doesn't make a man,
Stephon.

217
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,881
Well, you treat me like
I'm 8 years old.

218
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,050
A... a real man keeps his word

219
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,286
and he is where
he's supposed to be

220
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,087
when he's supposed to be.

221
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,490
That's what I know.

222
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,593
Fine.

223
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,035
I'll call next time
if you want.

224
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,431
I do want.

225
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,933
Because I know
you don't want me

226
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,267
to go out there
looking for you.

227
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,836
Like that would ever happen.

228
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,404
Yeah.

229
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,840
Yeah, and wipe your mouth,
Jay-z.

230
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,142
Wipe all the cake
off your mouth.

231
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,311
Jay-z.

232
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,382
Thank you.

233
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,918
Thanks, ma.

234
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,004
♪ After this time ♪

235
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,646
♪ I feel you ♪

236
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:45,950
Here I am,
reporting for sponsor duty.

237
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,886
Thanks for coming.

238
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:48,887
Uh-huh.

239
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,422
I mean it.

240
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,192
Just came to see
if you're okay.

241
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,427
Yeah. no.

242
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,464
I-I don't know what I am.

243
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,302
Well, it's like
a hospital in here.

244
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,304
Mm.

245
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:10,408
You need to cheer this place up
with some color, strength.

246
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,911
Like Tina Turner strength.

247
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,514
Although that sister did put up
with some serious bullshit.

248
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,016
Mm. You seen Ike?

249
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,417
Girl,
he's a little, skinny man.

250
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,219
Like Somalia skinny.

251
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,555
I mean, the first time
he raised his hand,

252
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,224
she should have
just broke him in two.

253
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,661
Used them legs on him.

254
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,101
So, you went to see the police?

255
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,337
Mm-hmm.

256
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,706
Feel better?

257
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:47,045
I feel... forgotten.

258
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:50,214
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

259
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,716
Well, I'll give you a tip.

260
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,954
Stop cleaning.

261
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,689
Oh, well, that goes back
to when I was a little girl

262
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,357
and I would hear
my folks fighting.

263
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,359
I'd straighten up and clean

264
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,328
as a way
of making things better,

265
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,462
feeling in control.

266
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,164
You know what they said?
Get a hobby.

267
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,332
Why don't you fix the place up?

268
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,267
Shit, give it a facelift.

269
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,702
You know, I used to be
an interior decorator.

270
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:14,038
I could help you.

271
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,340
I don't know.

272
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,442
I'm going back to work next week
part time.

273
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,243
I don't know if I want
to be spending money

274
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,678
fixing this place up.
Oh, please.

275
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,647
It won't cost nothing
to pull up this nasty-ass carpet

276
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,482
and burn it with the trash.

277
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,585
It was here when I moved in.
I never much liked it, but...

278
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,654
Let's pull it up.

279
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,990
You know, sometimes,
they got some real nice

280
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,458
hardwood floor underneath here.

281
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,059
Right here in the corner.

282
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:38,029
I don't know why Justin
keeps his bookbag...

283
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,036
See? It's already peeling up
here in the corner.

284
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,545
Oh, my god.

285
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,251
Oh, my god.

286
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:04,255
You know, maybe he was...
maybe he was scared.

287
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,324
Maybe he was angry.

288
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,293
Maybe he just wanted
to protect you.

289
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,064
Why... why would...

290
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,333
why... why would he do...
do something like that?

291
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,468
What is he supposed to do?

292
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,304
His big brother gets killed,

293
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,706
and the guys who did it,
they're still out there.

294
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,609
Well, I can't do anything
about that.

295
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,177
But what if you could?

296
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,280
Would you?

297
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,559
Of course I would.
Who wouldn't?

298
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,359
You know, with my little girl,
it was just like you.

299
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:46,364
They told me I couldn't
do anything, to wait.

300
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:51,235
So I waited.

301
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,503
And nothing happened.

302
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,581
Come on.

303
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,583
What?

304
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,684
Trust me.

305
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,753
Justin's asleep in his bed.
He's safe.

306
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,756
Let's go for a ride.
I want to show you something.

307
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,833
It's over there, right?

308
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,206
That's where Stephon was...

309
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,409
And they got another dealer
out there just like that.

310
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:35,113
He's got to be working
for somebody.

311
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,850
Denzel's on the trail
of a kidnapper in this one.

312
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,618
I got my own movie to go to.

313
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,420
Who are these friends?

314
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,621
You met them before.

315
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,623
There's some I haven't met.

316
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,425
Oh, and you're never
gonna meet those.

317
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,559
Yeah.

318
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,194
They'd call this house
day and night

319
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,363
when you were in eighth grade.

320
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,566
Hi.
Can I please speak to Stephon?

321
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,902
So, what's up with you
and that neighbor Ben, huh?

322
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,237
The plumber man.

323
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,404
All right. All righty.

324
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,806
These friends
you're meeting tonight,

325
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,808
is any of them
your regular girl?

326
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,877
Nah. They all know
who my regular girl is.

327
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,578
Oh, please.
I'm not falling for that one.

328
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,447
That's just so whack.

329
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,315
Whack? You...

330
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,651
Whack. Please don't
start using my words.

331
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,586
All right. Have fun.
What time is it?

332
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,255
Please. I'm 18. Come on.

333
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,458
I don't care if your 18.
11:00, please, Stephon.

334
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,494
Peace, just.

335
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,662
See you, Stephon.

336
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,763
All right.

337
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,199
You, me, and Denzel, baby.

338
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,834
Yeah. Like always.

339
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:34,338
Detective said he needs a name.

340
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,808
Let's get one.

341
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,244
"Let's get one"? Let's go home.

342
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,646
No.

343
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:45,316
At the meeting, you started
to say what you wanted.

344
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,792
I just want justice
for the ones who took my son.

345
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,630
So let's get it.

346
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,537
I just can't go over there
and ask.

347
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,573
It's a street. It's crowded.

348
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,742
You know what?

349
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,745
Everyone goes home sometime.

350
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,795
That's him.

351
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,432
Hey. The twins ain't here.

352
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,767
I got the food.
I'm coming home.

353
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,637
What makes you think
he'll tell us anything?

354
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,507
No. No. What if someone...

355
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,243
We can't! We won't.

356
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,378
Not unless we have to.

357
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,680
If I want to eat my french fries
on the way home, I'm gonna.

358
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,816
No. What are you gonna do?

359
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,318
I guess I'll get my Tina on.

360
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,362
Can I talk to you for a minute?

361
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,863
Yo, yo.

362
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,798
Don't come up on nobody
like that.

363
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,834
Just got a question.

364
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,302
I know you?

365
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,737
No, but you know Ray.

366
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:15,506
What's it to you if I do?

367
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,674
What you want from me, huh?

368
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,409
A name.

369
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,512
The corner that you work,
there was a drive-by last month.

370
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,314
Someone's responsible.
That name.

371
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,582
Look. Get the fuck out my face.

372
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,317
I want a name!

373
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,520
Is this a joke?

374
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,355
I want a name!

375
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,657
Give me that name right now
or I swear I'm gonna shoot...

376
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:33,758
Oh!

377
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,863
What did you do?

378
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,598
What was I supposed to do?

379
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,366
You saw. He came right at me.

380
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,802
He's somebody's child.

381
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,939
He tried to kill us!

382
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,875
Come on. Let's go.

383
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,311
Go!

384
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,383
All we wanted was a name.

385
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,885
But we did get one, didn't we?

386
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,553
Donelle Peete.

387
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,056
I mean, it's not the right name,
but it's a lead.

388
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,691
And his phone.

389
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,426
His phone's gonna have
more names.

390
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,528
We can leave a tip
for that detective.

391
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,662
He'll know my voice.

392
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,963
He didn't know your face.

393
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,465
He won't know your voice.

394
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:17,535
Look. I know
you're freaked out right now.

395
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,504
But I know you feel lighter.

396
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,886
Stephon.

397
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,090
Wake up.

398
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,728
Wake up.

399
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,996
Don't leave me yet.

400
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,599
You hear me?
You don't leave me yet.

401
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,601
You don't leave your mama yet.

402
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,737
Okay?

403
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,973
Now wake up.

404
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,378
You wake up, Stephon.

405
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,913
You hear me?

406
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,649
You hear me?

407
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,486
Breathe.

408
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,590
Wallet's gone, watch isn't.

409
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:15,726
Rolex.

410
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,927
The shooter left a Rolex?

411
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,829
The dummy also left
a pocketful of pills

412
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,498
containing
a felonious substance.

413
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,433
Felonious?

414
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,535
I catch you with that
big-word dictionary again,

415
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,103
I'm gonna beat you to death
with it.

416
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,872
Where the hell's forensics?

417
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,974
You know the drill.
It's the ghetto.

418
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:32,543
That means they get here
when they feel like it.

419
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:35,045
Can't blame them.
It's a simple atm case.

420
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,615
Insert gun, pop, pop, pop,
extract cash.

421
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,683
He took a cellphone
and left the drugs?

422
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,052
And no shell casings anywhere.

423
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,688
Got to be a revolver.
No, I got it.

424
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,524
It's the conductor
of the symphony orchestra,

425
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,192
and he hid the casings
in his opera cape.

426
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,960
Smartass.

427
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,495
Columbo got it done.

428
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,930
Yeah, Columbo's old as shit.

429
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,932
No. That's what
he wants you to think.

430
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,100
So while you're busy
making fun of him,

431
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,101
he's solving the crime.

432
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,469
No, no, no.

433
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:59,703
I-I get the whole theme of it,

434
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:00,938
but I'll be the first one
to tell you,

435
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,106
the shit don't hold up.

436
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,507
Saw it on TV Land last night.

437
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,875
Lots of, uh,
guys in plaid jackets

438
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,477
and wide-ass ties.

439
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,045
Is that what you do
when you're not on the job?

440
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,647
TV Land?

441
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:10,915
Don't act like you don't know.

442
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,850
You know the married life.

443
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,619
Like a broken record.
Where the hell's forensics?

444
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,695
I'm headed out to school.

445
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,564
I know you're angry
about your brother.

446
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,065
And I am, too.

447
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:32,069
But, Justin, you will not ever
put your hand on a gun.

448
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:33,938
You hear me?

449
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,139
I hear you. But...

450
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,807
I want your word.

451
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,876
It's like I told Stephon,
a man keeps his word.

452
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,678
You got it. But I don't
know... just go.

453
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,012
And bring home lots of books
in your backpack

454
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,514
because other than school,

455
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,797
you won't be leaving home
for awhile.

456
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,663
Got to stay calm.

457
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,665
What about the cash?

458
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,668
I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

459
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,170
Me neither.

460
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:11,008
Maybe slip it in the
donation box at the meetings.

461
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,144
I guess we shouldn't waste it.

462
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,746
You don't have to worry.

463
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:16,914
There was nothing
in the papers.

464
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,282
They're not looking for us,
Lila.

465
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:19,683
But the gun, it's still...

466
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,918
I told you.

467
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,219
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

468
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:25,155
I got it.

469
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:33,097
Did you see
who that call was from?

470
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,965
It was a text.

471
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,100
What did it say?

472
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,968
It said, "We said J.J.'s."

473
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,738
Usual time. Saturday. Leo."

474
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,773
Well, that's from
whoever he works for.

475
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:45,843
So, if we go this Saturday at
the same time Donelle was there,

476
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:48,579
we might find
the one who killed Stephon.

477
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,590
Mm. Off.

478
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,796
Shit.

479
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,353
You have a moment, ma'am?

480
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,270
Sorry. Do you have company?

481
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:16,974
Uh, I just haven't picked up.

482
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:19,109
Come on in.

483
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,611
Doing some work
on the house, huh?

484
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:23,147
Yeah. "Get a hobby," they said.

485
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,883
Assholes.

486
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:27,318
Look. I won't keep you long.

487
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,087
I-I just need to take a look
in Stephon's room.

488
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,122
Standard procedure.

489
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,524
Oh, come on.
It's right in there.

490
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,862
Right here. Okay. Okay.

491
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,034
Like I said, I usually
pick up better than this.

492
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,637
Eh, it's okay.
I was a teenager once.

493
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,138
Albeit, a long time ago.

494
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,707
Mm.

495
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,109
Can I get you
something to drink? Coffee?

496
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,111
No, thanks. I'm fine.

497
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,046
Well, I have something
on the stove.

498
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,081
I'll be right back.

499
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,650
Okay.

500
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,927
Thank you, ma'am.

501
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,898
You know, I... I saw he liked
to play Splinter Cell.

502
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,700
I play that with my nephew
sometimes.

503
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:50,868
I just got it for him.

504
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,670
He never had a chance
to play it.

505
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,407
All right.

506
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,842
Well, we'll be in touch if
there are any developments.

507
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,310
What were you looking for?

508
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:03,247
You... said it was about
the corner and the rent?

509
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:07,017
Well, there's certain
evidence-gathering protocol.

510
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,153
Like I said, procedure.

511
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,022
That's it?

512
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,825
You didn't come here to
investigate anything for real?

513
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:18,128
You're just here to check off
a box by his name?

514
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,697
No, ma'am.

515
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,699
I treat every case they give me
the same.

516
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,901
That's why I follow
the same protocol.

517
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,469
Make sure nothing important
gets missed.

518
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,471
Next time, call first.

519
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:30,874
Don't just show up
to a person's house.

520
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,316
I like that. "Call first."

521
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,385
You got potential.

522
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,488
Let's get to work.

523
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,292

524
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,260

532
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:21,458
First, I got pregnant.
Then he wanted to marry me.

533
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,026
And by the time
Stephon rolled around,

534
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,388
he didn't even know my name.

535
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,097
Home design didn't even matter
after that.

536
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,332
You know what I mean?

537
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:30,000
Same type of thing
happened to me.

538
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,035
Except the first time he told me
he didn't want my baby,

539
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,071
I told him to go fuck himself,

540
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:36,440
wasn't his anyway,

541
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,975
then I went and had a pizza.

542
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,890
Hey, Ben.

543
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,091
You feeling all right?

544
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,392
Mm-hmm.

545
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,227
Justin said
this would be a good time

546
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,329
to come for my chairs.

547
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:00,998
Hungry? We got plenty.

548
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,440
Are you sure?
I've seen you eat.

549
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,303
Is it okay?

550
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,372
Uh, yeah. It's fine.
I'll fix you a plate.

551
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,873
All right, then.

552
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,877
Justin, how you doing?

553
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,379
I've got an art project
to work on.

554
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:18,382
What? You just gonna leave?

555
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,851
Oh, all right.

556
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:23,821
Boy. Mm-mm-mmm.

557
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:26,824
This looks good,
if I do say so.

558
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:27,991
Well, I didn't make it.

559
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,960
Um... oh.

560
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,362
This is one of your dishes.

561
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,833
My mother taught me this.

562
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,301
Since it's just me,

563
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,937
I don't usually want
to make a whole pot.

564
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,039
Well, it's very nice of you.

565
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,408
I haven't felt much
like cooking, so...

566
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,211
Mm, well, it looks like

567
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:50,347
you've been pretty busy
working hard on this house.

568
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,082
Just let me know
if you need a hand.

569
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:55,385
I can manage just fine.

570
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:58,288
I didn't mean anything, Lila.

571
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:04,194
I'm sorry.
My nerves are just shot.

572
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,029
I just...

573
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,531
I'm gonna go back to group
tomorrow.

574
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:11,235
I don't know what else to do.

575
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,403
I don't know why
things are like they are,

576
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,072
why people do what they do.

577
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:19,376
All I know is,
is you'll find your way.

578
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:23,413
Till then, remember to eat.

579
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,449
I'm gonna cut this...

580
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:29,219
and give you
a piece of this to eat.

581
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,055
There.

582
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,056
You got to eat.

583
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,558
Mm. See?

584
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,059
Feel better?

585
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,701
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

586
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,132
Guess we finally had that dinner
I've been nagging you about.

587
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,567
Mm-hmm.

588
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:47,905
I kept asking 'cause...
Maybe I shouldn't say.

589
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,640
No, no. No, go ahead.

590
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:53,477
I kept asking 'cause
Stephon told me to.

591
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,548
He said your thing with Denzel,
it wasn't gonna last.

592
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,157
Oh.

593
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,492
Thanks for that.

594
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,527
Mm-hmm.

595
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,130
Yeah.

596
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:18,936
And for helping with Justin,
for everything, 'cause...

597
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,441
I work out in the yard a lot.
They're kind of rough.

598
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,179
No, they're not.

599
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:32,649
Okay. Well, you take care.

600
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,085
Okay.

601
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,987
See you soon.

602
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,262
Hey, Lila. Can I ask you something?
Mm-hmm.

603
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:47,030
Now, did you find a sponsor?

604
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,365
Oh, Patrice said
she was interested.

605
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,367
But I have someone.
Eve. That's okay.

606
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,202
Look. Um, hey, Patrice?

607
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,670
Lila just wanted to let you know
that she found...

608
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,439
hey, I'm sorry.
I can't talk right now.

609
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,074
I got to get home and get
to making my lemon squares.

610
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,508
What's your hurry, Patrice?

611
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,978
Charles is coming home.

612
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,714
He was coming home earlier,
but you know how boys are.

613
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,349
Out there with his friends.

614
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,351
So, I got to get home,
and I got to get ready.

615
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,319
Well, did you stop taking
your medicine?

616
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,521
Yeah. I didn't need it anymore.

617
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:13,657
I found the answer.

618
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,259
I found it
right here in the bible.

619
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:20,731
Who raised up his only son
in three days?

620
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:23,033
That's what got me.

621
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:25,569
'Cause if he could raise up
his son,

622
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,571
he could raise up mine.

623
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:29,740
So, that's when I started
to pray.

624
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:33,443
And I knew
my prayer would be answered.

625
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,765
Three days, three years. Mm-hmm.

626
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,550
I got to let the others know.

627
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:43,020
Charles is coming home.

628
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:46,089
Charles was, uh, at a barbecue,

629
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,657
and he was trying
to break up a fight,

630
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,159
and he got killed

631
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,028
three years ago today.

632
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,031
Birthdays, anniversaries,
they're the worst.

633
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,565
Oh, I'm good today.

634
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,633
Patrice, do you think
you can stay for the meeting?

635
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,035
No. You know what?

636
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,270
This has happened to her
before?

637
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:04,341
Not just her.
No, we all have our bad times.

638
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:06,076
So we look in on each other,

639
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:10,080
we, um, we stay over
if we have to.

640
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:12,182
So I'm gonna make sure
that she gets home tonight.

641
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:14,518
And tomorrow,
I will take her...

642
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,523
If I lost it,
would I even know it?

643
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,295
Am I gonna end up just like her?

644
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,730
If you stay inside

645
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,599
and you keep it all in
like her,

646
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:34,304
it festers.

647
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,606
You got to do something
about your feelings.

648
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:41,178
I try to sleep, but...

649
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:46,083
My mind keeps going back
to that corner every time.

650
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,660
You been thinking about this?

651
00:34:56,662 --> 00:35:00,464
I never stop thinking
about it...

652
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:03,867
About that damn diner
and who he was gonna see there.

653
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:10,107
I want to see him,

654
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,542
see if he's the one
that took my son.

655
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,278
It's Saturday.

656
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,685
In two hours,
it's the usual time.

657
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,488
I think you have to go.

658
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,725
It wouldn't just be for me.

659
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:33,163
I need it
just as much as you do.

660
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:38,635
Then maybe
we can help each other.

661
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,213
I guess this is a stakeout.

662
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:53,316
What do cops do
during stakeouts?

663
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,718
Sleep.

664
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,453
Hmm.

665
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,658
In the movies, they talk
about their families.

666
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,695
Is that my cue?

667
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:16,506
My boyfriend's name is Mello.

668
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,808
He comes

00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:49,506
So, your mom taught you that,
too, huh?

680
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:51,708
Yeah. Mm.

681
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,345
Your little girl
used to do that?

682
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,281
Yeah.

683
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,984
I never told anyone,

684
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,587
but I always wanted
a little girl.

685
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,333
Well, there they are.

686
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,479
Think they killed anybody?

687
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,281
I think they killed Stephon.

688
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,749
We don't know that.

689
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,487
You know how I feel.

690
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,689
We just talk to them.

691
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:42,592
Now, last time...
last time, you messed up.

692
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,730
That's what I was gonna say,
okay?

693
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,331
Last time, I messed up.

694
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,267
So, this time, it's all you.

695
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,601
If you want to go, we'll go.

696
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,036
If you want to talk to them,
we'll talk to them.

697
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:54,537
If we get a name for that cop,

698
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:55,772
I'll... I'll leave the tip.

699
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,841
But it's all you.

700
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,609
I'm going home.

701
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,419
You think  they're going home?

702
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,548
Yeah! Hey, bro.

703
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,917
I'm whupping the shit out
this motherfucking game, dawg.

704
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,053
Ain't nobody fucking with me.

705
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:45,655
I'm about to get the last cherry
and shit.

706
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,358
Hey, I know
he been talking to you, boy.

707
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,593
Shit. I'm the greatest, cuz.

708
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,862
Got to level 180 on candy crush.

709
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:53,963
Beat that shit.

710
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,398
I only see one of them.

711
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,760
Maybe the other one's
in the car.

712
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:03,373
Better call Saul, bitch.
Get the fuck over there.

713
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,443
Hey, bro, I told you
we was being followed.

714
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,844
Look at this shit.

715
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,846
All right, bro.

716
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,716
What you want, a scooby snack
or some shit, man?

717
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:13,917
Bro, I'm just saying.

718
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,618
You always trying to act like

719
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,454
I'm not paying attention
and shit.

720
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,956
Bah! Call it correct.

721
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,458
We saw you at the diner.

722
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,827
Saw you following us and shit.

723
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,962
You have fun?

724
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,931
What the fuck do you want, man?

725
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:31,501
I want to know who did the
drive-by on one of your corners.

726
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:34,971
Oh, you do, huh?

727
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,740
Is that all?

728
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,642
I mean, that's why you came
all the way down here for?

729
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,911
Nah. Nah, you see?

730
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:45,482
There's something
you ain't telling me.

731
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:49,419
You know something about
who shot Donelle, bitch?

732
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,521
Who's Donelle to you?!

733
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:54,657
Answer the motherfucking
question.

734
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:55,780
You first.

735
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,837
Yo, yo.

736
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,905
What the fuck
is wrong with you, bro?

737
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,106
Sorry.

738
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:13,977
The greek party was so sick,
son.

739
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:17,113
I had to make another run.
Who we got here?

740
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,848
We got a fucking procedure,
Bradley.

741
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,017
I told you don't be rolling up
all quick like that.

742
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,552
All right, chill, man.
Why you always sweating me, man?

743
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:23,887
All the business I bring you.

744
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:26,089
Dude, I bring you
all the campus green, son.

745
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,971
You keep plenty for yourself.

746
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,592
Oh, shit!

747
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,994
No, no, no, no! Aah!

748
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,495
Give it to me. Let's go.

749
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,864
No! No! Let's ask. Let's ask.

750
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,566
You got it. But hurry.

751
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:37,700
Tell us what we want to know,

752
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:38,835
and your brother gets a doctor.

753
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,670
Fuck you.
Get him one right now.

754
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,139
Donelle's corner.
The drive-by. That name.

755
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,141
Was it you, or was it him?
Don't say, shit, man.

756
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,876
Better say something or you're
gonna hear his last breath.

757
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,511
It's a sound
you never stop hearing.

758
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:49,746
Fuck! All right!

759
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:51,448
It was Alonzo T.

760
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,684
He runs the south side
for Handro and them.

761
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:55,952
Teo!

762
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,724
Fucking bitch.

763
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,470
Come on. We got to go
if we're gonna make it.

764
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,739
Let's go!

765
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,011
You know,
maybe you found the serenity

766
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,147
to accept the things
you cannot change,

767
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:28,151
and maybe you gained the courage
to change the things you can.

768
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:31,921
But finding the wisdom
to know the difference

769
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,790
is the real challenge

770
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:37,560
because the grief of your loss
can be so debilitating,

771
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:41,130
it can cloud your judgment.

772
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,174
And that goes
for the Olsen twins.

773
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,910
Ashley here has no wallet,
no cash, no cellphone.

774
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,712
Unlike Mary-Kate, here.

775
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:56,880
And what should we call
the one down here?

776
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,249
Humpty Dumpty? Opie?

777
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:02,752
I'm gonna ask for overtime.

778
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,287
If they're gonna task us
and keep sending us out,

779
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,688
I mean, that's unfair.

780
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,056
They didn't send us.

781
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:10,226
I heard it was a revolver.
Something about it.

782
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,694
I called in and asked for it.

783
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,196
I knew it. I knew it.

784
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,797
What are you doing?
You volunteering us now?

785
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,266
That's not procedure.

786
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:18,902
Since when have you stopped
following procedure?

787
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:22,005
Revolver again,
no cellphone again.

788
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,840
Kid have any drugs on him? Yeah.

789
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,842
Enough to make it
the best fucking prom ever.

790
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:28,011
So what?

791
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,579
Ballistics comes back,

792
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:30,680
it's gonna be the same shooter
as Donelle.

793
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:31,881
We're gonna be ready.

794
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,283
They won't give a shit
upstairs.

795
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:35,218
Our task force
is not gonna get another task

796
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,319
for these motherfuckers.

797
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:38,087
A series of related shootings.

798
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,789
They're gonna give a shit.

799
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,225
Yeah. Of course they will.

800
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,826
Somebody just killed Opie.

801
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,566
Justin?

802
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:50,667
Yeah?

803
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,902
Justin?

804
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,337
I'm in the bedroom.

805
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,646
What do you...
what do you think you're doing?

806
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,014
I cleared out his stuff.

807
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,583
Where... where is everything?

808
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:07,650
In the attic.

809
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:08,952
Who said you could do this?

810
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:10,853
This is my room. And I can't...

811
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,323
no. No. This is my house.

812
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:14,891
All right?

813
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,726
So you bring it all back now.

814
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:19,095
Now! No!

815
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,863
I can't look at his stuff
every day!

816
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:23,766
I'm sick of it!
He is not coming back, mom!

817
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,970
He's...

818
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,949
Lila, I'll send him home
if you want.

819
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,351
But he wants to stay
on my couch.

820
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:48,257
All right, um, tell him...

821
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:53,262
Tell him all right,
and tell him I'm sorry.

822
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,372
Here I am,
hurting over memories,

823
00:44:02,374 --> 00:44:04,874
and he's having to look at it
every night.

824
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,845
Look... don't blame
yourself too much.

825
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:11,948
It was like he was trying to put
his brother away for good.

826
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,182
No. Unh-unh. no.

827
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:16,953
He kept Stephon's watch
as a reminder.

828
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:19,122
You ever keep anything?

829
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:25,161
Of course.

830
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:30,833
I kept some clothes,
some pictures.

831
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,339
And on my phone, I... I
know what you're gonna say.

832
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,142
I know what you're gonna say
'cause I do the same thing.

833
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:41,411
I even paid the bill
so I could.

834
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,782
Yo, it's Stephon.
You know what to do.

835
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:48,284
Hear how
he's trying to be cool?

836
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:49,385
Yo, it's Stephon.

837
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,386
You know what to do.

838
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,089
It sounds to me like

839
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,451
he's trying
to tell us something.

840
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,898
We already have a name.

841
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,233
Exactly.

842
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:10,840
And I know to find him.

843
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,877
Look what they did!

844
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,487
You don't think
I know who you are?

845
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:03,793
You think you can just show up
like no one would know?

846
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,864
We said no reporters.

847
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:11,100
Oh. I'm not a reporter.

848
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,336
Then who are you?

849
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:18,174
I'm from a grief support group
for mothers.

850
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:21,911
And, um...

851
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:26,115
I just wanted
to leave a card, just in case.

852
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,950
Oh.

853
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,355
Thank you.

854
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,163
The family wanted
to send along a thank-you card,

855
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:42,031
and he didn't leave an address.

856
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:44,267
So we decided
to call the florist.

857
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,404
Alonzo, yes.

858
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:51,207
Business address is fine.

859
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:53,943
Promiseland Atlanta?

860
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:56,846
What's that?

861
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:59,015
Oh, a night club.

862
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:00,883
Okay.

863
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:05,488
We're going to a night club.

864
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,858
Ugh. It's been so long.

865
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,027
I almost forgot how to do this.

866
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:12,161
You're stepping out.

867
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,863
Might as well
step out in style.

868
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:15,331
What do you think?

869
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,100
You look good!

870
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,404
Almost as good as me.
Almost is good enough

871
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:23,039
'cause I don't want to look
like no hoochie.

872
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,561
Oh! Really? It's like that?

873
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,276
Your hair looks good.

874
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:28,477
You like it? Really?

875
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:29,579
Mm-hmm.

876
00:47:29,581 --> 00:47:31,147
Chopped it myself.

877
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:33,382
Used to be down to my ass,
but...

878
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,885
After my girl passed,
I just took a scissor to it.

879
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:37,053
Now I kind of like it.

880
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,454
Looks good.

881
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,423
All right.

882
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:41,557
Let's take a picture. Okay.

883
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,092
All right. Ready?

884
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:44,594
Mm-hmm.

885
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,935
Oh!

886
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:54,203
That's a good one.

887
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,338
Okay. Do another one.

888
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,606
Okay, okay. Different pose.

889
00:47:56,608 --> 00:47:57,940

We don't.

906
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,186

But there's a Zo.

910
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,540
Yo.

911
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:07,143

on Teo's phone?

912
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:09,445
Hello?

913
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,714
That song.

914
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:14,016
You're in my club.

915
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,584

920
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:02,531
Look at her.

921
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:05,267
Lila, don't worry.

922
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,636
I got this covered.

923
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,672
Trust me.

924
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,278
Excuse me. Excuse me.

925
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,080
Excuse me.

926
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,252
Mm, god. How far along are you?

927
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:24,754
Oh, six months.

928
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,422
Six months?

929
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:29,725
You know what I remember about
being six months pregnant?

930
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:31,394
I wanted it all the time.

931
00:50:33,097 --> 00:50:34,263
My hormones are jumping.

932
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:36,465
Oh, nope. Don't Bend.

933
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:38,867
Do not Bend.
We got you covered.

934
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,204
There you go.

935
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,372
Did you ever
go out to dinner...

936
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,207
I know what you're gonna say.

937
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,442
Before I even opened the menu,

938
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:48,077
I would be dragging him
back home.

939
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,745
Where do you think
I'm going now?

940
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,414
I know what you're gonna say.

941
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,315
You look great.

942
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:55,151
I know.

943
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:58,187
I know you got responsibilities,
but you can take a night off.

944
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:00,623
Where am I? I'm at your place.

945
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:03,192
That is such a typical answer.

946
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:05,694
Ah, it's such
a typical question.

947
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:08,697
Have you thought about a name
for the baby yet?

948
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,399
No.

949
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,235
'Cause when the time come,
you gonna look up at me,

950
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,571
and I'm gonna just go
with whatever name you say.

951
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,673
Mm.

952
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,779
What about you?

953
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,514
Of course I have.

954
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:28,751
Y'all be obsessing
over that shit.

955
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:32,188
Ain't like... ain't like it
matter what I think no way.

956
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:39,595
I want
to name the baby Worthington.

957
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,164
You hear me?

958
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,533
Baby, come on, now.
Stop ignoring me.

959
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:48,404
Baby, come on, now.
That was funny.

960
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:50,339
Ba...

961
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,176
Hey, what's this all about?

962
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:58,114
Just another drive-by,
just another two people dead.

963
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:00,783
One named Ray.
And one named Stephon.

964
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,219
Stephon was my son, and...

965
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:04,520
I want the one responsible.

966
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:06,322
It was you, Leo said.

967
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,591
Leo?

968
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:10,226
Teo and Donelle? That was you?

969
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:11,427
I'm the one
asking the questions.

970
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:12,595
I want to know.

971
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:15,297
Fuck what you want to know,
bitch.

972
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,700
You come up in here a...
fuck you.

973
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:19,168
Did you kill my son? Tell me.

974
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,402
I ain't telling you shit.
Kill him!

975
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:21,670
Tell me what I want to know.

976
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,539
Maybe I got something
I can tell you.

977
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,708
Maybe I can make it over there
and snap your fucking neck

978
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,876
before you pull the trigger.

979
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:28,244
Maybe I'll ask Maya.

980
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:30,146
Remember Maya? Yeah.

981
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:32,848
Didn't even cross
your selfish-ass mind, huh?

982
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,651
Where is she?

983
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:36,919
She's in the closet.
She's fine.

984
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:38,854
She's carrying my baby.

985
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,256
You killed my baby.

986
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:41,657
You think I fucking care
about yours?

987
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,726
Oh, you not
getting out of here alive.

988
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:47,363
You think I care
about getting out alive?

989
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:51,467
All right. You want to hear?

990
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,202
I'll tell you.

991
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,840
Ray was working
one of my corners

992
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,808
without doing what was right.

993
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,379
So, told Teo and Leo
to go tell him what was what,

994
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,281
but they ain't never
get around to it.

995
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:09,285
Then Donelle sends me word
that Ray's out there dissing me.

996
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,620
I was in the neighborhood.

997
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:13,756
I decided
I'd take care of it myself.

998
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:16,926
I warned the motherfucker.

999
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,531
Everything's gonna be
all good. You know?

1000
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:26,235
Tell her to chill.
Stephon's gonna be there.

1001
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:28,337
But you start letting shit go,

1002
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:30,372
pretty soon
it will all be gone.

1003
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,412
I wasn't exactly looking
for your son,

1004
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:37,613
but he was there.

1005
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,816
He's right there.

1006
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:44,954
So you ask me who's responsible

1007
00:53:44,956 --> 00:53:48,691
for that shit on the corner...

1008
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:49,858
It's you.

1009
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,827
What are you... you motherf...

1010
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:53,796
you let him run the streets.

1011
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:54,897
He shouldn't have been there.

1012
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:55,998
Shoot him.

1013
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,499
He... he got in the way.

1014
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:58,601
That shit's gonna happen
when you somewhere

1015
00:53:58,603 --> 00:53:59,635
you ain't supposed to be.

1016
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:00,970
Finish him right now.

1017
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:02,771
So, it's you, it's me,

1018
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,540
it's... it's...
it's my man Handro in Mayfield.

1019
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,308
It's the world.

1020
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,509
Same shit's gonna happen tomorrow.
Kill him. Kill him.

1021
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:09,245
World's gonna keep on turning.

1022
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:11,647
Do you think you can stop it?

1023
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:15,251
Man, who are you?

1024
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:17,486
I'm just a mother.

1025
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,358
Ow!

1026
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:25,995
Are you okay?

1027
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:27,796
Come on.

1028
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,574
Let's go. No!

1029
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:39,808
Let's go.

1030
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,485
It's terrible. That poor girl.

1031
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:50,653
Poor girl?

1032
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:52,288
She knew how he got his money.

1033
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,490
And she knew what he did
to get it,

1034
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:55,691
and she fucked him anyway.

1035
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:56,892
Fucked him because of it,
probably.

1036
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:58,327
She didn't deserve to get shot.

1037
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:00,462
We didn't shoot her!

1038
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,698
And that shit's gonna happen if
you're where you shouldn't be.

1039
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,534
Isn't that what Zo said?
Fucking asshole.

1040
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,303
You wanted justice, you got it.

1041
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:09,004
I don't feel better.

1042
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,573
That's because it's not over.

1043
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,510
Alonzo said his man in Mayfield

1044
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:15,744
was the one
who ordered that hit.

1045
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:17,813
I don't care
about the man in Mayfield.

1046
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:18,947
Well, you have to.

1047
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,617
Because it's all connected.

1048
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:22,951
You don't see that?

1049
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:27,056
No. No, I don't see.

1050
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,659
I'm sorry, eve, but I'm done.

1051
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:34,897
This wasn't just about you,
remember?

1052
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:36,932
We were supposed to be helping
each other here.

1053
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,636
What? So, what?

1054
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:43,505
Now we just go back to our lives
like nothing ever happened?

1055
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,408
After all we've been through
and all that we've done,

1056
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,577
you really think
that we can go back?

1057
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,917
I went into the closet
to change.

1058
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:57,720
Someone grabbed me from behind.

1059
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:59,388
And I heard a voice real low

1060
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:02,591
said I'd be dead
if I made one sound.

1061
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:04,460
Can you give us
any description?

1062
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:06,729
I didn't see.
I didn't want to see.

1063
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:09,064
All I can say...

1064
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:11,400
Is that she sounded real mad.

1065
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:13,162
She? Did you say she?

1066
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,773
Only a few crews
got women running with them.

1067
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:19,376
Someone's moving in.
I'm telling you.

1068
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:21,009
All we got to do now
is start running names, records.

1069
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,745
What are you talking...
this isn't a turf war.

1070
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:23,912
"She sounded real mad."====

1071
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:26,648
That ain't turf. It's personal.
You always say, "Work the evidence."
 


1073
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,198
So where you getting that?
Call it a working theory.
 


1075
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:42,865
What's this all about?
We're having a little outing.
 


 

1078
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:52,941
Well, this is a really good idea.
Well, I am so glad that you're enjoying it.
 


1080
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:56,845
Oh. Yeah. Ooh, and I know 
someone else who would, too.
 


 

1083
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,017
Excuse me.

1084
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,820
All right, I know you're still mad at me...
What about tomatoes?

1085
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:07,856
But some of us from the group
are out to dinner.

1086
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:11,493
And going to a movie, too.
Dinner and a movie.
 


1088
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:15,130
I know it's not your thing, but
I thought I'd just let you know.

 


1090
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,498
So, holla back.

 

1092
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:19,668
"Holla back"?

1093
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:23,005
Well, I know y'all still say that.

1094
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:28,444
No. no.
Lila, was that your friend Eve?
 


 

1097
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:33,015
Any luck with getting her to come back?
I tried, but you know how she is.
 


1099
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:36,018
I-I-i've heard you mention her,
but I must have missed meeting her.
 


1101
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,853
Is she that new woman
from Decatur?

1102
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:43,859
No. She lives in Midtown.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

 

1104
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:49,665
I know we're here to celebrate getting
this lovely lady out of the house.

 


1106
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:55,737
But I also want to make a toast to her
son, Mr. Justin, the award-winning artiste.


 

 

1109
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:59,575
Award? Cheers.
Wait a minute. Award-winning?
 


1111
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:03,078
What award?
Nothing. It's just a school thing.
 


1113
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,015
My art project won a contest.
Why didn't you tell her?
 

1115
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:09,885
I couldn't. I mean,
I couldn't find the time to.

1116
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:11,753
What do you mean,
you couldn't find the time to?

1117
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:16,158
You could just say it. How hard is that?
Real hard lately. I never see you.
 


1119
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,994
You're either working
on the house or with them.

1120
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,565
So, when you get home...

1121
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:27,669
I'd like to see it, please.
Show your mama.
 


1123
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:34,209
I wasn't sure how you'd feel.

1124
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:37,913
Do you like it?

1125
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:48,190
I love it.

1126
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,631
I love you.

1127
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,870
I love you, too, mom.
I love you so much.
 

 

1130
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:17,953
Hey.
The mailman left me some of yours.

 


1132
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:34,603
I had nothing to... got 
the forensics. No prints.

 

1134
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:38,006
Zo's phone was gone.
I got the records.

1135
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:40,075
Guess who his last call ever
was from?

1136
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,810
Teo Corlone.

1137
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,846
Teo's got a pretty good alibi,
what with being dead and all.

1138
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:47,282
So, the shooter has Zo's phone,
Teo, and Donelle...

1139
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:49,017
What are you doing?
Don't touch my shit.

1140
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:51,019
Yeah, you better put on
your jacket.

1141
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:56,792
Oh, you finally got a case big enough
to get you face time upstairs, huh?

 


1143
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:59,995
Pretty-boy college kid getting
killed got his attention.

1144
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:02,631
So, what's the latest with
the Bradley Tipton case?

1145
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:05,701
Well, we do know it's the same
gun for all the shootings.

1146
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:07,302
Phone records link them all.

1147
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:11,273
Alonzo to Leo, Alonzo to Teo,
Leo and Teo to Donelle, Donelle...
 


1149
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:15,711
all the varied permutations.
He's been waiting to use that $10 word.
 


1151
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:19,314
Like I was saying, they all worked
together, now they're all dead.
 
 


1153
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:22,250
The Alejandro organization
supplies the neighborhood,

1154
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,853
but, uh, but these guys,
they're local.

1155
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:27,789
It all points to a turf war.
What? No.
  


1157
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,691
The physical evidence doesn't,
the crime scenes sure don't.

1158
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:31,026
I don't know
what else it could be.

1159
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:33,895
And I got the D.A. calling me.
I got the press up my ass.
 

1161
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:35,631
What would you have me
tell them, Holliston?

1162
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,733
Well, you can tell them no comment.
It's still under investigation.
 

1164
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:41,770
That your heart
goes out to the families.
 

1166
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:45,073
Turf war's our working theory.
Help me out, Scaketti.
 
 
1168
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:49,044
I got it narrowed down to two crews...
Quincy Corners and 16th street.
 


1170
01:00:49,046 --> 01:00:50,979
They're the ones who've had
women running with them.

1171
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:55,124
Okay. That's good.
Keep me informed.
 


1173
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,122
Inform me on how your theories
fit the details.

1174
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:02,157
Say, with the wild shooting.

1175
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,226
And with taking the phone
and leaving the drugs

1176
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:05,794
and leaving a fucking witness.

1177
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:07,729
You got a better fucking theory?
Yeah.

1178
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:10,265
Somebody's trying to climb up the ladder,
but not for reasons you think.

 

1180
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:15,404
Let's try climbing back down.
It's Alonzo's neighborhood, right?
 


1182
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:20,442
He gives a franchise to Leo and Teo.
Bradley, not-so-innocent bystander.
 


1184
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:24,446
Leo and Teo bring on Donelle,
who replaces Ray.

1185
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:27,015
And Stephon, wrong place
at the wrong time.

1186
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:30,986
And it's a woman.

1187
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:35,123
So, what woman?
Jesus Christ.
 


1189
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:40,095
Oh, shit.
Holliston, yo.
 

1191
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:42,297
You heard what the chief said
just now.

1192
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:46,735
Turf war's our working theory.
Go home, man.
 

1194
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:52,974
So, don't forget that we have
that fundraiser for tomorrow.

1195
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:59,881
If I can get a couple volunteers to maybe
make some lemon squares or some muffins...

 


1197
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,149
Muffins.

1198
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:04,853
Thank you. It'd be great.
Thank you, guys. Hi, Lila.
 


1200
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:09,758
I think I see a new face.
Was it Nita?  
 


1202
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,226
- Welcome.
- Welcome, Nita.

1203
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:14,196
You're welcome to share if you'd like.

1204
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:27,743
I lost my two sons, Leo and Teo.

1205
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:33,949
They would tease each other,
but you could see the love.

1206
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:36,818
They would come and see me
every sunday.

1207
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:41,189
That's nice. I'm just a cashier,
but they bought me a house.


 

1209
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:43,225
But they... they loved
working with their hands.

1210
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:47,642
They... they were in construction.
They were dealers, the news said.
 


1212
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:55,103
We're here to support each other.
Oh, we've suffered too much to lie.
 


1214
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,839
You don't think I've suffered?

1215
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:01,877
Yeah.
Yeah, you've suffered.
 

1217
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:04,112
I... you deserve
our love and comfort.

1218
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:07,048
I... if you need any help,
I'll be glad to...

1219
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:14,022
I know we... we have rules and all.
And I want to do the right thing,
 


1221
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:20,195
but if you knew what your boys were into,
if you took one dime from them, knowing,

 


1223
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:22,998
and you didn't do everything
you could to stop them...

1224
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,267
Patrice.

1225
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:30,872
She may deserve comfort and support.
She doesn't deserve it from us.
 


1227
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:33,408
I'm sorry, but I agree
with Patrice. No.

1228
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,345
She's a mother, too.

1229
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:42,317
She's in pain just like us.
I'm not sure we should judge.
 
 

1231
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,555
We shouldn't.

1232
01:03:56,299 --> 01:04:01,403
Ms. Walcott, you got a few minutes?
Talk about the case?
 


1234
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:06,241
There's a place nearby... J.J.'s.
Sure. I'll meet you there.
 


1236
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,226
Miguel Alejandro's crew
runs the whole south side.

1237
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:28,563
In your area, he had a guy named
Alonzo Troys running things.

1238
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:33,401
Alonzo leads to Leo and Teo.
They lead to Donelle.

 

1240
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:36,571
They all worked together,
and they're all dead.

1241
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:39,541
Bradley, the white frat boy, he's
just big into dealing on campus.

 


1243
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,877
We think it was a wrong place,
wrong time situation.

1244
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,546
That's been known to happen.

1245
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:49,484
Anyway,
Donelle takes over for Ray.

1246
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:54,222
So it all leads back to the corner
where Stephon was killed.

 


1248
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:02,197
Now, there's something I got to ask.
Did Stephon know these guys?
 

1250
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,268
Who the hell you think you are,
asking me that?

1251
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,904
Bringing me here
to ask me that?

1252
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:11,273
That white cheerleader
you got posted up on your board

1253
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:13,556
and Bradley...
you ask their mothers that?

1254
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,212
He never knew them,
never met them,

1255
01:05:17,214 --> 01:05:20,982
never had one thing to do with them
till the day they murdered him.

 


1257
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:22,450
I'm just trying
to make sense of it.

1258
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:24,219
You have no idea what it's like
to lose a child.

1259
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:29,124
No idea.
I'm afraid I do.
 


1261
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,497
I'm sorry about that.

1262
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,235
Well, if you have
nothing else to tell me,

1263
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:45,507
I'm gonna go home.
But, you know, there is one other thing.
 


1265
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:56,952
Alonzo's girl, Maya, she, identified
the shooter as a woman.

 
 
1267
01:05:56,954 --> 01:06:02,223
Said she sounded real mad.
No one's gonna believe that.
 

1269
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:08,396
So, what's gonna happen
to the case now?

1270
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:11,032
If it stops now,
nothing, probably.

1271
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:18,406
If it happens again, I'm gonna find
the one responsible.

 


1273
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:22,243
I'm gonna have to.
Leave more than that.
 


1275
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:26,514
What? It's 15%.
We took up a booth.

 
1277
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:28,183
You ever think about
what women go through?

1278
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:32,187
Yeah.
Quite a bit lately.
 
 


1280
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,444
You're under arrest. Oh.

1281
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:58,380
Oh, that's not funny.
Put it away!

1282
01:06:58,382 --> 01:07:01,116
It's kind of funny.

1283
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:04,486
I wanted to see how you'd feel
if I didn't show.

1284
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:06,154
You were so scared.

1285
01:07:06,156 --> 01:07:08,323
Hell, yeah, I was scared.
That detective knows.

1286
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:09,491
That man don't know shit.

1287
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:13,194
What you need to be worried
about is our man in Mayfield, Alonzo's boss.

 

1289
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,130
It's time for me and Justin
to move away.

1290
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:17,599
Oh, jesus.
You with the running.

1291
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:21,302
I need to think about Justin, and the 
girls in the support group will understand.

 

1293
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:25,306
The girls in the group
don't give a fuck about you.

1294
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:27,075
I do.

1295
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,512
You want to run away?

1296
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:32,480
Fine.

1297
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:38,286
But we got to finish
what we started or they're gonna finish us.

 


1299
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,534
Hey, you.
Hey, you.
 

1301
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:55,437
You know, I think that once
we finish the renovation,

1302
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:58,339
that, uh, we're gonna move.

1303
01:07:58,341 --> 01:08:00,775
Really?
Yeah.
 

1305
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:05,146
I think it's something we've got to do.
I understand.
 


1307
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:13,288
What about Ben?
That's a good question.
 


1309
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:16,224
I like him.
I like him, too.
 

1311
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,361
Stay down!

 

1313
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:42,817
Justin?

1314
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,821
Somebody call an ambulance!

1315
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:54,229
Are you all right?

1316
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,617
Oh, Justin.
Justin. oh.
 


1318
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:20,155
Oh, Justin. Justin.

 


1320
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:22,524
Justin. Oh, here, ma'am.
Back here.

1321
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:24,192
Justin.

1322
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:27,629
Hey, Mom.

1323
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,600
Ms. Walcott? About your son.

1324
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:34,903
He's got a broken kneecap,
but he's gonna be just fine.

1325
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:36,638
Okay. Okay.

1326
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,506
- What's up, big man?
- Hey.

1327
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,908
What'd I tell you
about driving?

1328
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:44,412
Thanks for coming.
Come on, now. No need for that.
 


1330
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:47,482
Let me get you and Justin home.

1331
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:51,586
You both can stay with me until you can
get things straight.

 


1333
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:54,822
Justin, you good?

1334
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:57,358
Yeah.
All right.

 

1336
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,662
We gonna get you out of here,
get you home.

1337
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:04,766
One child dead, and then he threatens
the other child.

 


1339
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:08,236
I mean, everyone's children, really.
Really.
 

1341
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:13,741
I am not going back
to feeling helpless.

1342
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:21,716
You know how you told me
you always like to clean house
 

1344
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:25,853
whenever something bad happens?
Your way of making it better, right?

 

1346
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:28,790
Yeah. Being in control.
Yeah.
 

1348
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:32,427
Well, let's finish the house...

1349
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:34,590
In a way that will finish off
Alejandro.

1350
01:10:35,664 --> 01:11:31,019
Okay. Where do we begin?
Hey, it's me. The trap is set.
 
 

1352
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:34,622
Cheese is in place.
All we need is the rat.

1353
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,691
Pick me up tonight.

1354
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,075
You got Patrice's ride, huh?

 

1356
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:04,452
I got the address, maps, everything.
Where'd you get this?
 


1358
01:12:04,454 --> 01:12:07,922
You know where I got it.
You were in my office?
 


1360
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:12,527
Duh. It's the office of public records.
Did someone help you?
 
 

1362
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,028
No, I did it myself.
It was easy.

1363
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:15,950
I mean, the computer did
most of the work, but...

1364
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:25,807
Come on. We got to go.
2121 Dogwood.
 


1366
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:34,816
I want you to look down
at Alejandro's house

1367
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:39,487
and tell me what you see.
A party.

 

1369
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:42,090
Alejandro's out there,
and we're over here,

1370
01:12:42,092 --> 01:12:45,893
and he doesn't even think
about what he does to us.

1371
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:50,431
And that's what I mean.
It's not you.
 


1373
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,101
It's the world
that's lost its mind.
