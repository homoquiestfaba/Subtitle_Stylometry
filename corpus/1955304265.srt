<i>Welcome, shoppers...</i>

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,009
Ketchup, mustard...

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,094
Oh! Sausages and buns!

5
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,066
Demonstrate, boys!
Hey, look at this! We've got one!

6
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,901
Over here!
Yes! We're chosen!

7
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,570
Yes!

8
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,435
Frank!
We've been chosen together!

9
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,827
Hey, Brenda, you and me...

10
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,229
I'm so happy that God's
put our packages together!

11
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,625
- It's because we belong together.
- It's like we were made for each other!

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,337
- Get ready, boys!
- It feels amazing!

13
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,425
Oh, oh, yes!
I'm the first to enter eternity!

14
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,719
Potato!
Way to go, buddy!

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,394
Oh, Jesus fuck!

16
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:02,896
Oh, fuck! Me skin!

17
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:05,649
- She's peeling me fucking skin!
- What the fuck?!

18
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:11,238
For the love of shit, run!
Run!

19
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,077
I want my mommy!

20
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:22,762
They're eating children!

21
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:24,876
Fucking children!

22
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,634
So, you've learned
the terrible truth?

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,928
- I've got to tell everyone!
- No one will believe you.

24
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,012
I have to try!

25
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:38,765
Everyone will die, otherwise!

26
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:42,436
Oh, yeah! That's a good point!
Fuck me, right?

27
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:45,397
Run for your fucking lives!

28
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:53,321
Once you see that shit...

29
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:01,663
it will fuck you up for life.

30
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:04,499
Good luck! Have fun!
