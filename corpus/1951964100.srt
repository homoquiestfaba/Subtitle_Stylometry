We found a female skull last week.

Look. Here.

452
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:21,701
We know that she stood
at just over 5 feet...

453

...and that she died around the age of 35.

454
00:35:25,673 --> 00:35:29,871
The shape of the pelvic bones
rules out childbirth as the cause...

455
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,411
...so it was most likely due
to an illness of some kind.

Wow. Uh...

00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:41,915

I remember it now.

1025

There was a storm, just like this one,
and she left me.

1026
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:49,948
Even then she didn't care about me.

- Then why didn't she stay alive for me?
