is?

It's sanskrit, it
means vital life.

There are Yogis in India
who rarely eat.

188

"prana" from the air

203

I think her husband's out late,
and she's wondering
where he is.

204

She's worried he's with someone
else, but she's also glad to
have the down time...

I'm gonna tell you a story...

208

and then I'm gonna ask you
a question. Okay?

209
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,838
There's this girl about your
age at her mother's funeral.

210
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,142
At the funeral, she sees this
guy she's never seen before.

211
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,044
She gets to meet him, briefly.

212
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:03,648
And she thinks he's amazing.
He's everything she's
ever wanted.

213
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,684
She falls in love with him,
right there and then.

214
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:10,054
But, in the crowds at the
funeral, she gets separated...

215
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:14,792
from him before she has a
chance to ask for his number.

216
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:19,163
And two days later... this
girl... kills her own sister.

217
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,801
What's her motive for
killing her sister?

218
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,676
Her motive is she wants to
meet the guy again.

219
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,982
Did I get it right?

220
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:42,120
Huh? Oh, there's no
right answer.

221
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,191
Depends on what
you're looking for.

222
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,993
Why is that?

223
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:53,231
You're testing me to see if I
think like a sociopath.

224
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:56,467
Sociopaths sometimes have
trouble reading
facial expressions.

225
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,737
With the second test, I gave
you the answer you were
looking for...

226
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,473
but, the fact is, that story
has a flawed set up.

227
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,409
The more logical outcome would
be for the girl to
kill her father.

228
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,081
Why?

229
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,317
If the girl didn't know the
man, it's unlikely her
sister would.

230
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,854
And it was her mother's funeral
where she met this guy...

231
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,556
so it would make more sense for
her to kill her father.

232
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,392
There would be a higher
probability that the...

233
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:25,062

her father's funeral.

234
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,101
That's probably true.

something to her?

a case, if I was guilty
of something?

867

accusing me of...

868

you're accusing.

869
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:20,702
They wanted to hire
Peter Lundgren.

870
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:23,838
You brought me in, because I
was down, and I was weak...

871
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,941
and I was easy to manipulate.
Right?

872
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:30,445

that file until you
absolutely had to.

have the file!

You wanted me to drop the case.

877

878
01:12:43,293 --> 01:12:45,893
Now... I know what you didn't
want me to find out.

879

JOHN (O.S.): Due to Anna's
early overt sexualization...

889
01:13:21,097 --> 01:13:22,730
she has a need for control...

890

891
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,936

difficulty...

892
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:33,775
in forming and maintaining
long-term
relationships with others.

893
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:36,110
Basically, she has developed a
protective shell...

894

out the pain...

895

It's great.

896

than the way we do.

897

possible thing you could do.

It's not your fault, John.

Anna was able to study our
protocols during your
time with her...

1038

and she eventually became
strong enough to control and
manipulate the sessions.

that water triggered the
