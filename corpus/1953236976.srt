1
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,325
Breathe, my love.

2
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,201
Don't be afraid.
I'm right here with you.

3
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,006
Another deep, cleansing
breath, my love.

4
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,201
And now a little push.

5
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,691
We did it! An egg!

6
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,451
MY EGG

7
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,011
Our egg.

8
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,009
And what a perfect egg it is.

9
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,329
With a perfect child inside.

10
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,645
Just a little look, ko-hoh,
at my new arrivals.

11
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,611
No, no, my dear.
They need warmth for survival.

12
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,043
- Just a little peak, ko-hoh.
- Move your nosy beak, ko-no.

13
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,607
Oh, this waiting, this anticipating...

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,485
...the birth of my perfect baby swan.

15
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,284
Our swans, dear.

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,409
Oh, yeah.

17
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,005
<i>Three perfect eggs
Won't my kids be super</i>

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,686
<i>Wish that I could look inside
And see their future</i>

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,321
<i>Will you be leaders
The pride of the flock</i>

20
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,002
<i>Three little chips
Off of my old block</i>

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,010
<i>Well an apple doesn't fall
Too far from the tree</i>

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,964
<i>You'll be the spittin' image of me</i>

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,686
<i>- Spittin' image of him, spittin' image
- That's right</i>

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,048
<i>- Spittin' image of him
- Oh, boy.</i>

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,005
<i>All I ask is perfection
From my sons and daughters</i>

26
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,124
<i>Like my humble self
And all the swans before us</i>

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,601
<i>We're gonna ko-hoh best of them all</i>

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,127
<i>Everyone will listen
When our trumpets call</i>

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,886
<i>You'll be my reflection
Everyone will see</i>

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,043
<i>You'll be the spittin' image of...</i>

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,203
<i>-...me
- Spittin' image of him, spittin' image</i>

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,124
<i>- Indeed
- Spittin' image of him</i>

33
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,806
<i>Do you remember when we courted?</i>

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,844
<i>- How we were dancing beak to beak</i>
- I do

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,731
<i>I entranced you with my call</i>

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,884
<i>- And I made your life complete
- Here, let me take a seat.</i>

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,323
<i>He can't wait till he sings
So the world will know</i>

38
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,404
<i>We're the best ko-hohers
In the whole ko-hoh so</i>

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,881
<i>Hush, dear mama, I'm in ecstasy</i>

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,600
<i>They'll be the spittin' image of me</i>

41
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,486
<i>The apple can't fall
Too far from the tree</i>

42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,291
<i>They'll be the spittin' image of me</i>

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,727
<i>Be the spittin' image of him</i>

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,440
Shoo-doop
The spittin' image of her

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,406
<i>Shoo-doop
The spittin' image of him</i>

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,486
<i>An apple doesn't fall
Too far from the tree</i>

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,611
<i>- You'll be the spittin' image of me
- You'll be the spittin' image of me</i>

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,361
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,207
- You're on my foot.
- Oh, no.

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,808
At last, I am a father
with all the pleasant duties...

51
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,884
...and awesome responsibilities
of fatherhood.

52
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,329
Welcome, my children,
to this magnificent pond...

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,685
...and the swamp adjacent.

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,286
Oh, you have chops, my little one.

55
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,966
I shall call you Ella.

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,367
Ko-hoh, my mama done and hatched me.

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,130
You have good pipes...

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,603
...and bad grammar.

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,890
I shall call you Billie.

60
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,006
A son.

61
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,481
My own blessed son!

62
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,691
Welcome, my child,
to wind and weather.

63
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,048
I'll... I'll...
I'll name you Louie...

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,806
...after my father, Louie,
and his father, Louie-Louie.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,483
In the tradition of the great
swans before you...

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,206
...let me hear your ko-hoh!

67
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,405
<i>Louie'?</i>

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,006
Perhaps he's shy, dear.

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,249
No need to be shy, son.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,049
We are all waiting to hear
your ko-hoh, Louie.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,721
There, there...
There must be a mistake.

72
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,764
This child cannot be ours!
Someone must have switched the eggs.

73
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,849
Of course he's ours.

74
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,090
He's our Louie.

75
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,246
But my son is destined to be
the greatest of all the trumpeters.

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,960
Why, just look
at his superior parentage.

77
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,847
How will he ever speak
to his friends?

78
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,611
Or attract a mate'?

79
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,203
After all, what made you fall in love
with me was my...

80
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,450
...deep, powerful, resonant voice.

81
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,527
A father wants so much
for his children...

82
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,489
...and now this.

83
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,011
Oh, a tragedy. What despair!

84
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,003
- What is it'?
- It's a boy.

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,281
Another son'?

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,885
No, no, darling.

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,847
We are being watched by a human boy.

88
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,930
And with such big eyes.

89
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,643
- Marco'?
- Polo.

90
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,610
- Marco'?
- Polo.

91
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,804
- Marco'?
- Polo.

92
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,051
No fair. Louie didn't say "Polo."

93
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,965
Well, he can't talk.

94
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,800
Can't talk'?

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,241
And he calls himself a trumpeter swan?

96
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,801
I don't think so.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,650
Louie can't help it.

98
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,609
Father says he's...

99
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,609
...you know, defective.

100
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,602
Well, defective one,
Marco Polo is a talking game.

101
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,849
And if you can't talk,
you can't play.

102
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,401
Those are the rules, buddy.

103
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,449
Hey! If you can't talk,
you can't play.

104
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,247
You're out of here, duckie.

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,086
A trumpeter swan who can't trumpet?

106
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,001
Oh, man, breaks my heart.

107
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,009
Okay, here we go.

108
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,006
My swan dive!

109
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,007
And now, Serena's all-time,
world famous cannonball!

110
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,851
One, two, three...

111
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,445
...here I go!

112
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,571
Hi. You want a slice of pond weed?

113
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,610
I'm Serena. What's your name?

114
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,170
That's your name? No way!

115
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,681
Hey!

116
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,001
You could say goodbye, Mr...

117
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,049
It's not fair.

118
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,567
Everyone has a voice but me.

119
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,282
You got the beat, honey.
Want to join in'?

120
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,002
If only they knew how much.

121
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,601
- Sorry.
- Now see what you did?

122
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,484
Well, I said I was sorry.

123
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,684
It's not my fault he's, you know...

124
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,328
The fox! I've gotta warn them.

125
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,482
Billie! Ella! Look out!

126
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,046
Please let them hear me!

127
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,243
Thank goodness you are safe,
my precious daughters.

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,164
Oh, how my heart trembled.

129
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,601
Look!

130
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,408
That human boy...

131
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,728
...saved the lives of our children.

132
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,403
He has my eternal gratitude.

133
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,723
When I think of what could have
happened with Louie unable...

134
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,766
...to cry out a warning. Although
I'm sure you did your best, son.

135
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,366
I did try.

136
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,609
Can't he see how hard I tried'?

137
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,204
Everyone okay? That was close.

138
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,801
Hey, no problem.

139
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,002
<i>Okay, campers, lights out, please.</i>

140
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,806
I could spend the whole day
watching the baby swans.

141
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,644
There are three cygnets.
Two of them said, "Beep."

142
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,890
The third one didn't.

143
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,202
I like him the best.

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,210
I wonder why baby birds beep?

145
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,566
"Why do baby birds beep?"

146
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,884
Is that all you can
think about, bird boy'?

147
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,408
What's it to you, A.G.?

148
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,611
Swans are fowl!

149
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,409
Besides, some of us are trying
to sleep. So get a life, will you!

150
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,204
<i>She's so fine
She blows my mind, yeah</i>

151
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,447
Hey, little guy.

152
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,806
I'm Sam Beaver.

153
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,168
You like music. Me too.

154
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,003
<i>Everybody sing along</i>

155
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,602
<i>We're gonna rock, baby
All night long</i>

156
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,481
Now you try it.

157
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,046
You can't sing?

158
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,170
So what? Not everybody
can do everything.

159
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,809
But I bet you're
a better swimmer than me.

160
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,207
Wait till he sees this!

161
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,481
I'm not really big on pond shrubbery.

162
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,410
Something stinks out here!

163
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,002
And your feathered friend
doesn't smell too good either.

164
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,601
You're pathetic, Beaver.

165
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,721
Thanks.

166
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,004
Hey, I like you too, little guy.

167
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,801
<i>I got the freezin', breezin'
Low-down blues</i>

168
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,649
The chill you feel is the result
of the onset of autumn...

169
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,521
...a subject about which
I have a few timely remarks.

170
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,201
Have you ever wondered, children...

171
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,968
...why we swans have wings attached
to our rather handsome torsos?

172
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,202
Not really, Father.

173
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,927
These mighty wings allow us to migrate
to more temperate waters.

174
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,206
Fly south to a warmer lake.

175
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,444
Oh, gotcha!

176
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,849
But we don't know how to fly.

177
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,129
As your father, I shall teach you.

178
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,843
First, I extend my long, elegant neck.

179
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,281
Then I retract my muscular feet.

180
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,088
Then I pump my glorious wings.

181
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,845
And finally, I call out
a mighty ko-hoh...

182
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,401
...when I take to the sky.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,809
I have to ko-hoh?

184
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,401
Now I'll never be able to fly.

185
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,961
Come on.

186
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,807
Well, I'm gonna try.

187
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,605
Amazing!

188
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,127
Those guys down there look like ants.

189
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,608
Those are ants, silly.
You haven't left the ground yet.

190
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,481
That's it, Ella.

191
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,729
You're getting it, Billie.

192
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,003
Louie, I can't help but notice
you're not in the air.

193
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,169
You must try, son.

194
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,605
Look at us, Father.

195
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,449
Coming, girls.
You sound marvellous!

196
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,963
Okay, I'll try.

197
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,401
Hey, I'm flying.
I can do it!

198
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,005
Whoa!

199
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,651
Look at me, Father.
Oh, please, look at me.

200
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,129
Stay in your own lane, buster.
You should have honked.

201
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,802
That kid's a menace!

202
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,801
You must keep your eye
on the sky, my boy.

203
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,927
And I must find my son a voice.

204
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,324
I remember you.
You're the one who can't talk.

205
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,730
<i>How does it feel'? Is it weird'?</i>

206
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,804
You know, I bet it makes you
a great listener.

207
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,002
Hey, want to see my triple gainer'?

208
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,604
Did you like that?

209
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,648
Boy, am I silly.

210
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,327
You can't talk,
and I'm asking you questions.

211
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,085
I'm the one who's weird.

212
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,811
She's not weird. She's great!

213
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,524
This sounds crazy, but I think
that little swan really understood me.

214
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,611
I wonder if I'll ever see him again.

215
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,406
There you are.

216
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,201
Good luck, little guy.
Have a nice winter!

217
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,404
I wonder how birds know
which way is south?

218
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,685
Do they follow the stars'?

219
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,410
How do they know which way is south?

220
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,285
There it is, my children.

221
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,561
Our new home.

222
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,411
Red Rock Lake, Montana.

223
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,202
Last one there's a rotten egg.

224
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,887
Come on, Louie, let's explore.

225
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,208
She's inviting me.

226
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,809
I have good news for you, darling.

227
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,766
Before you know it, your son, Louie,
will be in love.

228
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,409
Why... Why...
Why this is terrible news.

229
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,245
Love isn't terrible.

230
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,525
It is if you can't say ko-hoh
to the female of your choice.

231
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,970
And you have to spend the rest
of your life in loneliness and misery.

232
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,528
Oh, you do have a point, my love.

233
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,729
I have many points...

234
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,850
...but I am Louie's devoted father.

235
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,244
I shall act.

236
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,448
I hear there are man-made devices...

237
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,923
...that produce sound similar
to our wild trumpeting.

238
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,050
Similar but inferior, of course.

239
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,002
I shall search
for such a device for our son.

240
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,647
Even if I have to go
to the ends of the earth.

241
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,602
If I may make a suggestion, dear,
just got to Billings, Montana.

242
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,609
It's a lot closer.

243
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,205
All right. Very well, without
further ado, I will go to Billings.

244
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,362
Goodbye, my love. Ko-hoh!

245
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,891
What a swan. I just hope
he knows what he's doing.

246
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,483
How do human females put up
with these annoying love calls?

247
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,444
Oh, my. Who would want to mate
after hearing that?

248
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,607
Aha. Now that is the sound
of romance.

249
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,406
Aha. Now is my time to act.

250
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,642
May luck go with me.

251
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,443
Correction. May good luck go with me.

252
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,205
Here I go!

253
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,609
Somebody help me!

254
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,087
Help, I've been robbed
by a swan thief.

255
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,403
I'll get you, you miserable thief.

256
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,769
Thief? Me'? A lowly thief.

257
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,804
I did it for my son.

258
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,651
I only did it for my son, Louie!

259
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,603
Okay, mister, let's stop what we're
doing and hand over that weapon.

260
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,400
All right, I'm issuing you
a citation, little man.

261
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,291
It is illegal to shoot here.
Oh, yes.

262
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,842
This happens to be a bird refuge.
Can you read, sir'? Can you'?

263
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,891
Right there, there is a sign.
It says, "no hunting."

264
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,924
Right here. Black and white.
"N-O H-U-N ting."

265
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,805
What would that be'?
Say, no hunting, perhaps.

266
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,411
It is illegal to shoot.

267
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,011
The coast is clear.

268
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,567
Saved by the written word.

269
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,565
Oh, hey there.
I'm Sweets. Who are you'?

270
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,884
Hey, now I remember you.

271
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,128
The one who can't talk.

272
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,527
Oh, baby, don't feel bad.

273
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,609
Everybody's got something.

274
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,450
You like those words, baby?

275
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,728
Look. Humans have words...

276
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,610
...all over the place.

277
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,001
On their food.

278
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,568
On their tails.

279
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,241
Even on their mountains.

280
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,809
They can communicate
without even speaking.

281
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,004
Wow! This is great news!

282
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,565
What did I do?

283
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,280
Wait a minute, little fella,
where you going?

284
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,480
This is so exciting.

285
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,802
I have to try to tell him.

286
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,683
There's this thing
called reading and writing.

287
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,570
And I have this human friend...

288
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,684
...who can show me how.

289
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,764
What? You're not making
yourself clear, my boy.

290
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,802
Then I won't be, you know,
defective anymore.

291
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,807
I wish you could speak to me, Louie.

292
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,765
What wonderful things you would say.

293
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,006
He can't understand me now,
but one day he will.

294
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,044
What? What? What? What?
Louie? Louie? Wait, Louie?

295
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,289
Come back, son! Look!

296
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,484
I brought you a voice!

297
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,926
<i>Another chilly day here in Billings.</i>

298
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,569
<i>So bundle up, stay home,
and get out the hot cocoa.</i>

299
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,247
<i>Cinderella dressed in yellow
Went upstairs to kiss her fellow</i>

300
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,730
What?

301
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,402
Whoa! It's you.

302
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,404
It can't be.

303
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,805
It is you.

304
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,562
Well, little guy,
how did you find me'?

305
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,722
What? You stepped
in bear droppings?

306
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,642
"No hunting."

307
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,247
I agree.

308
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,686
Why shoot animals?

309
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,922
Wait a minute. Did you just write?

310
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,205
No way!

311
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,642
You want to learn to write more stuff'?

312
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,204
<i>And read too'?</i>

313
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,851
So you can have a voice.

314
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,407
You're some swan, little guy.

315
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,201
He's gone.

316
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,125
He's... He's really, really gone.

317
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,680
It's her fault.

318
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,843
She wouldn't let him play Marco Polo.

319
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,686
And she wouldn't let him play
Duck, Duck, Goose.

320
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,247
It doesn't matter whose fault it is.

321
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,606
What matters is...

322
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,966
...is that he's gone.

323
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,170
I must leave this idyllic lake
and look for him.

324
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,605
Darling, darling, there's just
one little matter to consider.

325
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,246
We have no idea where Louie went.

326
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,445
Well, my birdly instincts
tell me he has gone...

327
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,809
-...south.
- Uh-huh. Well, what about north?

328
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,087
Or <i>east'?</i>

329
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,321
Or west?

330
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,006
Or northeast? Or the southeast?

331
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,090
Or southwest and northwest?

332
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,648
Oh, there are too many directions!

333
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,520
We'll just have to hope
that Louie comes back.

334
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,201
If he ever does come back.

335
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,008
But who will I dive with
if he doesn't come back?

336
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,323
Congratulations, children.

337
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,367
Our special fern is finally ready
for the science fair.

338
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,724
I know we're all looking
forward to the fair.

339
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,128
Aren't we, Mr. Fern'?

340
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,930
That's Mrs. Hammerbotham. She taught
me to read when I was in first grade.

341
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,360
Now remember, boys and girls,
plants have feelings too.

342
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,450
Hello, Sammy.

343
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,207
Did you come to share
your special pet'?

344
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,447
He's not my pet. He has to learn how
to read and write as soon as possible.

345
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,406
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.

346
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,682
I like the way Sammy
uses his imagination.

347
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,202
Don't you, children?

348
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,242
I'm sorry, Sammy,
but I've never taught a swan.

349
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,207
Oh, he's very well-behaved.
And he won't mess up the room.

350
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,205
He'll even raise his wing
when he has to go to the--

351
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,085
Oh, dear! Now look what's happened!

352
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,964
Oh, Sammy, don't you see.

353
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,801
We can't have this swan in class.

354
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,448
But you were the one
who taught me to respect...

355
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,206
-...the differences of others.
- Well, yes, dear.

356
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,891
You said the world
is a rainbow...

357
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,043
-...of different colours.
- Different colours.

358
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,447
- Different races.
- Different races.

359
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,881
- Different creeds.
- Different creeds.

360
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,528
- Different species.
- Different species!

361
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,605
Different species?

362
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,007
Did I say that?

363
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,324
Sammy, sometimes Mrs. Hammerbotham
says what she thinks she means...

364
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,487
...but that she doesn't actually mean
to mean. Do you know what I mean?

365
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,170
Please. You can't discriminate
against him just because he's poultry.

366
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,849
Oh, what a little darling.

367
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,805
Well...

368
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,927
Now, I guess we do need
a new science project.

369
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,124
What do you say, children?

370
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,402
Yes!

371
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,691
I'm in first grade.

372
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,606
This will be your seat.

373
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,765
Let's remember to keep
our wings to ourselves.

374
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,611
We must work on our fine motor skills.

375
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,045
Is it time for recess?

376
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,241
Oh, dear.

377
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,202
If only our eyes weren't
on the opposite sides of our head.

378
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,370
But I like the way
you're trying, little guy.

379
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,327
"One fine morning in the month of May,
Stuart arose early."

380
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,605
<i>That's you'?</i>

381
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,121
Wow! You have a name.

382
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,089
All right, little guy.

383
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,970
I mean, all right, Louie.

384
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,845
Well done, Louie.
Oh, what a special day this is.

385
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,004
- All right, Louie.
- Oh, you see, children...

386
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,084
...if we try our very, very best...

387
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,483
...we can do anything
we set our minds to.

388
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,802
Good luck, Louie.
I'll be counting the days till camp.

389
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,245
Wow! "Honour Swan
at Billings Elementary School."

390
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,926
That's me.

391
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,286
Thanks a million.

392
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,130
Hey, I got it covered.

393
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,891
Here comes the great one.

394
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,645
- Hey!
- You snooze you lose.

395
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,608
Got it! Open, I'm open!

396
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,606
- Oops.
- Butterfingers.

397
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,723
She scores.

398
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,208
Victory dance.

399
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,125
Ko... Ko...

400
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,646
Ko-hoh! Look!

401
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,527
Look! Can it be'?

402
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,207
Miracle of miracles, it's Louie!

403
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,246
Louie, my Louie, oh, you're so big.

404
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,448
But so thin.

405
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,529
Have you been getting enough to eat'?

406
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,042
Louie, my son...

407
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,207
...no one can imagine the extent
of our joy at seeing you again.

408
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm sure I speak for everyone here--

409
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,283
Perhaps, you could speak
for everyone later, darling.

410
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,051
What's that weird thing
on your neck, Louie'?

411
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,804
Wait until they see this.

412
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,606
"Hi there."

413
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,766
Wha--'? Do you think Louie
has gone cuckoo, Mother'?

414
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,809
Well, he was always a creep.

415
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,607
Now he's a creep
with a little baby bib.

416
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,406
- What is he doing?
- Hi there.

417
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,564
Hear me, Serena. I did this for you.

418
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,282
What are you trying to say, Louie'?

419
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,890
Nothing's changed.

420
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,600
They still can't understand me.

421
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,127
How could I have been so stupid?

422
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,606
This, my son, is your trumpet.

423
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,808
If you learn to play it, Louie...

424
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,800
...you will be able to ko-hoh
like every other swan.

425
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,048
May the hills echo...

426
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,602
...with your new voice, my son.

427
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,410
Man, even for a rodent
this is tough on the ears.

428
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,400
I'll never learn to play this thing.

429
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,010
Now come on, try it again.

430
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,646
Man, there's a voice inside of you...

431
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,928
...that is dying to come out.

432
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,409
Now come on, give me
some of that sweet, sweet music.

433
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,321
Oh, man, anybody got earplugs?

434
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,082
Oh, yeah.

435
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,769
<i>Hey, hey</i>

436
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,288
<i>- Everybody's shakin' 'em
- Come on, let's jam</i>

437
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,041
<i>And groove to the beat
You gotta find your feet and swing</i>

438
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,563
<i>- I got to say
- I got to say</i>

439
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,644
<i>- How in love I am
- She's in love</i>

440
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,731
<i>With the music I hear
Everybody's here and sing</i>

441
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,088
<i>Join us girls and boys</i>

442
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,800
<i>Screamin' and making noise</i>

443
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,446
<i>The music goes like this</i>

444
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,567
<i>- I'm going, I'm going
- Come on in</i>

445
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,881
Join, come on

446
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,444
<i>Make a big line now
Come, come, come on, sing</i>

447
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,524
I have to find my voice too.

448
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,842
I just have to.

449
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,850
Yes.

450
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,844
- Yes.
- Wow! Louie'?

451
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,247
Are you the one making that sound?

452
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,245
I like it.

453
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,044
Play some more.

454
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,651
Thank you, Louie.

455
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,851
I don't know what it is,
but it's really sweet.

456
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,851
Serena!

457
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,520
Hi, Daddy.

458
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,490
Oh, there's Boyd.

459
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,563
Boyd! Maurice here!

460
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,086
Serena!

461
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,080
Serena, say hello to Boyd.

462
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,401
Hi, Boyd.

463
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,451
Well, hello, Serena.

464
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,407
You know, Boyd just happens to be
the best trumpeter in Montana.

465
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,130
Boyd, how about it, huh'?

466
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,489
Let's hear those vocal cords vibrate.

467
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,531
Ko-hoh!

468
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,843
Incredible.

469
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,526
Serena, Serena,
come along, come along.

470
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,444
Boyd is joining us for dinner.

471
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,121
<i>Attention units.</i>

472
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,045
Be on the lookout for a swan thief.

473
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,962
That's him. That's the one.

474
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,401
I'll get you!

475
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,643
Stop, thief!

476
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,088
<i>Swan thief spotted downtown.</i>

477
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,727
<i>You are surrounded.
Stop where you are.</i>

478
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,644
It's that swan thief!

479
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,560
They're pursuing me!

480
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,644
They're pursuing me with a vengeance!

481
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,329
They're going to lock me up!

482
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,006
Darling, it was just a dream.

483
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,051
No! Nonsense, no!
They were after me!

484
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,490
With shotguns and footcuffs
and wingwhoppers and...

485
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,563
What's got into you, darling?

486
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,243
Oh, my dear, my dear, my dear,
I am nothing but a common criminal.

487
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,845
A thief!

488
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,084
You see, I procured the trumpet
without paying for it.

489
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,250
You mean you... You...

490
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,566
<i>You stole it'?</i>

491
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,122
It is deplorable, but true.

492
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,362
But you did it for love.

493
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,248
But I sacrificed my honour.

494
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,490
Now I will never sleep in peace again.

495
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,202
There, there, dear.
You did it for Louie.

496
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,122
I'm sorry, Father.

497
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,249
I'll get your honour back.

498
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,646
I will.

499
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,041
This is the heart
I never got to give you, Serena.

500
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,291
Goodbye.

501
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,521
I'll miss you.

502
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,042
<i>Welcome, campers.</i>

503
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,082
<i>- Please unpack all your things.
- It's great to be back.</i>

504
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,243
<i>So I don't have to.</i>

505
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,245
I want to see the girls' cabins.

506
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,251
Louie!

507
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,244
"Need to talk. Urgent."

508
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,208
"My father stole the trumpet."

509
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,842
Your father stole that trumpet'?

510
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,771
Hey, he didn't know.
It was a mistake.

511
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,850
"But now they're after him."

512
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,769
I know, all he needs to do
is pay back the store.

513
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,243
You can get a job and earn
the money to pay for the trumpet.

514
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,845
- A job.
- Now, what are you qualified to do'?

515
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,129
Can you actually play that thing?

516
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,051
That's it!

517
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,769
Hey, hey. hey!

518
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,968
HEY. hey, hey, hey!

519
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,001
Get over there! Put that back!
Hey, you!

520
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,448
Okay, let's go. Put that--
Hey, hey! You, stop that!

521
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,684
That's my foot!
Oh, I need a vacation!

522
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,968
- He's super, isn't he'?
- He can't play the bugle.

523
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,201
He's a waterfowl!

524
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,690
Come on, chief.
Hire him as our camp bugler.

525
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,366
I tell you, it's lousy pay.

526
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,762
That's okay.
He'll take the job anyway.

527
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,889
Okay, he can have the job.

528
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,651
No problem, chief.

529
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,043
Our last bugler left because
he got a rash on his lips.

530
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,050
But don't worry,
you don't have lips.

531
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,246
<i>Louie's music blows everyone</i> away.

532
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,044
<i>When I think of that tiny swan
who pulled my shoelace...</i>

533
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,641
<i>...Louie seems so grown-up now.</i>

534
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,960
<i>I wonder what I'm gonna be
when I grow up.</i>

535
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,441
<i>I wonder what I'm gonna be.</i>

536
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,441
Wormeater!

537
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,050
You call that a spike, feather breath?

538
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,486
I quit!

539
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,643
All this outdoors!

540
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,042
You all stink too!

541
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,841
Camp!

542
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,162
What a stupid place!

543
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,403
I want my TV.

544
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,448
Oh, no!

545
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,844
Whoa!

546
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,044
Help, I'm drowning!

547
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,289
Help! Help me!

548
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,441
Man overboard!

549
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,040
Help! Somebody help!

550
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,361
Help! I'm drowning!

551
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,049
Great save, Louie!

552
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,250
Hey, swan.

553
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,444
You did okay...

554
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,450
...for a bird.

555
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,845
You're a hero!

556
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,766
Louie! Louie! Louie! Louie!

557
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,443
Louie! Louie! Louie! Louie!

558
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,730
I never knew someone like me
could be a hero.

559
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,649
Oh, man, now that's music.

560
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,284
Sweet, sweet music.

561
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,044
Kum ba yah.

562
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,324
<i>Kum ba yah, my Lord, kum ba yah</i>

563
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,642
Chief asked me to give you this.

564
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,444
It's your salary.

565
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,768
Is it enough to pay for my trumpet?

566
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,287
Maybe, but not for all the damage
to the store.

567
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,923
You need to earn some big money
for that.

568
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,483
You can't do it around here,
that's for sure.

569
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,728
Big money is in big cities.

570
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,331
Then that's where I'll go.

571
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,563
Okay, campers, see you next summer.

572
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,765
Now, remember what I told you.
Head east.

573
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,882
Check out Chicago...

574
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,765
...or Philadelphia or even Boston.

575
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,008
And go easy on the baked beans.

576
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,843
You're gonna make it, big guy.
You're gonna be somebody.

577
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,689
Look at them!

578
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,042
Isn't spring romantic?!

579
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,449
Get a grip, Apathy. They're crickets.

580
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,490
<i>Love on the lake, love me, babe</i>

581
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,126
Oh, that voice!

582
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,206
Every time he sings, I can
feel it in my wishbones.

583
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,849
Oh, you're so lucky, Serena!
He's nuts about you!

584
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,170
Hey, hey, chicks, please, back up.
Gotta talk to the gal here.

585
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,045
Hey, Serena, how about it'?

586
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,925
You, me, doing that wedding thing?

587
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,441
Marriage? Wow.

588
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,251
- Will you excuse me, Boyd'?
- Huh'?

589
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,847
She'd better stop that silly diving
bit and make up her mind.

590
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,730
I'm in demand, you know'?

591
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,930
Oh, you'd be a fool to pass him up.

592
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,491
Oh, yeah, right.

593
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,250
He doesn't even like to dive.

594
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,407
- Are you still hung up on that loser'?
- The one who's never coming back?

595
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,603
He might. You don't know.

596
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,848
Marry Boyd.

597
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,728
Of course she's going to marry Boyd.

598
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,649
But Daddy, I'm not sure--

599
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,965
Show the world that you've something
in your head between your feathers.

600
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,249
But Daddy, shouldn't I be
feeling something more'?

601
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,442
Love grows on you.

602
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,449
That sounds like a fungus.

603
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,051
Serena...

604
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,127
...goto him.

605
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,005
Okay, Boyd-

606
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,201
I'll do it.

607
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,728
I'm yours or you're mine or whatever.

608
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,962
Hey, good call, babe.

609
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,762
Your prince is gonna sing to you
every morning and every single night.

610
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,209
- It'll be bliss.
- I can't wait.

611
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,689
<i>I'm your morning and evening star</i>

612
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,522
<i>From my side you'll never go far</i>

613
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,643
Oh! It's gonna be beautiful.

614
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,928
Oh, no, she accepts!

615
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,924
Man, this is a disaster!

616
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,848
--Getting married!
Get that on the Internut.

617
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,121
Just because we're squirrels doesn't
mean we have no infrastructure.

618
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,245
- Getting married.
- Married.

619
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,405
Getting married.

620
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,250
She's getting married?!

621
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,840
Heartbreak!

622
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,050
Message, message!

623
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,041
Oh!

624
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,321
But first...

625
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,568
...a little snack for the road, maybe?

626
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,445
Acorns!

627
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,444
My favourite!

628
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,569
There it is: Boston.

629
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,049
Oh, hi there, Louie.

630
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,446
I am the senator.

631
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,483
Your grassroots rodent.

632
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,321
My constituents have informed
me of your arrival.

633
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,007
If you need anything, do not
hesitate to contact my aides.

634
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,044
He's nice! For a politician.

635
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,808
What do you say'? Double or nothing?

636
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,525
Hey, that's okay. Plenty more suckers
where you came from.

637
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,963
Forget it, buddy. We got swans up
the wazoo here. Try Philadelphia.

638
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,241
A horn-playing swan!

639
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,289
This I like.

640
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,244
I smell...

641
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,808
...cash. Oh, yes, the green goddess.

642
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,728
Let me introduce myself.
Name is Monty.

643
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,361
I am a highly successful
entrepreneur...

644
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,086
...recently relocated to these parts.

645
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,043
Oh, yeah, this card thing.
That's just a hobby.

646
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,530
You might have some real earnings
potential with that horn there.

647
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,087
Have you considered working
with a manager?

648
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,410
I can help you reel in some big bucks.
For a small fee.

649
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,170
I wish I knew what a manager was.

650
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,331
I get you a gig in one of them swan
boats there. Trust me, swanny.

651
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,643
Be back in half a honk.

652
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,651
Yes, he's a horn-playing swan.
Think about it.

653
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,724
He'll have the tourists flocking
to see this thing.

654
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,962
This is an opportunity
you should not pass.

655
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,450
You got a deal.

656
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,530
We're in, swanny.

657
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,442
We're talking dough for me--
Do Re Mi, pal. Let's go.

658
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,844
WOW!

659
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,529
Taught him everything he knows.

660
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,521
- Incredible!
- The swan's gonna be a star!

661
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,044
<i>Have you heard the music
Across the Boston Lake</i>

662
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,123
<i>Spread the word
There's a brand-new bird</i>

663
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,368
<i>And oh, how he can play</i>

664
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,851
<i>When he blew that trumpet
Everybody came</i>

665
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,085
<i>Now let's cheer, you can't hear
That the people all shout his name</i>

666
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,408
<i>Everybody say
Louie, Louie, Louie</i>

667
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,165
<i>Stand and take a bow</i>

668
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,889
<i>You hit the thing
Baby you're the king</i>

669
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,287
<i>And nothing's gonna stop you now
Everybody sing</i>

670
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,369
<i>Louie, Louie, Louie</i>

671
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,449
<i>A brand-new star is born</i>

672
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,682
<i>And the people all shout
But you better watch out</i>

673
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,247
<i>When Louie starts blowing that horn
Blow it, Louie!</i>

674
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,126
<i>Everybody sing
Louie, Louie, Louie</i>

675
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,204
<i>Look what you've became</i>

676
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,607
<i>You're a hit for real
Tell me how it feels</i>

677
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,848
<i>When everybody knows your name</i>

678
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,287
<i>Louie, you're the bomb
Louie, you're the whiz</i>

679
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,369
<i>The leader and the champ
And the best there is</i>

680
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,568
<i>Listen to the people
And the chatter of the birds</i>

681
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,649
<i>Everyone's together
And the reason is because</i>

682
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,883
<i>Louie, Louie, Louie</i>

683
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,809
There's no one else the same

684
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,049
<i>- It's the final stop
- Cause you've reached the top.</i>

685
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,282
<i>Everybody's gonna know your name</i>

686
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,848
Everybody's gonna know your name,
Louie!

687
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,923
<i>Louie, Louie, Louie</i>

688
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,849
<i>Look what you became</i>

689
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,084
<i>You're a hit for real
Tell me, how does it feel</i>

690
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,487
<i>When everybody knows your name</i>

691
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,569
<i>All the way from New York to St. Louis</i>

692
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,649
<i>Everybody knows the tune</i>

693
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,048
<i>You're the bomb, the whiz
The best there is</i>

694
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,282
<i>'Cause no one plays like you</i>

695
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,523
No one plays like you, Louie!

696
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,929
<i>Listen to the sound of the rhythm
And the beat</i>

697
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,010
<i>Everybody's singing
And dancing in the street</i>

698
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,562
<i>Louie, Louie, Louie</i>

699
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,244
They love you, Lou. You and me,
we're gonna go far.

700
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,727
One day you'll be on-stage with
the whole darn-tooting Boston Pops!

701
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,443
And I'll be sitting pretty
on a mountain of money.

702
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,651
Lou, where you planning on
spending the night?

703
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,880
Here, on the lake.

704
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,368
I don't think so.

705
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,127
As your agent-slash-manager,
I'm here to protect you too.

706
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,041
Nothing to it.

707
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,607
I got a lot riding on this swan.

708
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,281
This hotel looks pretty fancy.

709
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,850
I don't see any other swans.

710
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,411
Excuse me, monsieur, I'd like a
single room for my client here.

711
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,850
A swan in a hotel? Preposterous!

712
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,249
What are you talking about?
My client's a famous musician!

713
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,731
Nonetheless, we haven't had
great luck with musicians.

714
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,040
What if he trashes the room'?
Or molts in the bed?

715
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,647
And then there's the delicate
matter of...

716
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,644
...lice.

717
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,087
- I think I got a cure for that.
- Oh, I couldn't possibly!

718
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,965
There he is! There's Louie!

719
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,206
Can we have your autograph?

720
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,882
Will you look at that, is this
swan a celebrity or what?

721
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,321
Well...

722
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,487
- Just sign the register, please.
- That's more like it.

723
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,045
Very impressive.

724
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,049
This way, sir.

725
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,642
What's this?

726
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,247
Numbers.

727
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,887
They sure have fizzy pond water here.

728
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,489
This is fun. Serena would love this.

729
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,051
Ah, here we are. Your room service
order, sir.

730
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,608
The kitchen was out of the pond
weeds you requested...

731
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,089
...so our brilliant chef took
the liberty of substituting...

732
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,207
...twelve watercress sandwiches,
hold the bread. Mmm, yummy.

733
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,450
Perhaps you'd like to dine
alfresco, yes?

734
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,247
- He talks funny.
- On the terrace?

735
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,246
Thank you, sir. You are very kind.

736
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,245
Um, extra pillow, sir'?

737
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,645
Oh, dear.

738
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,762
But of course.

739
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,685
You're feather sensitive.

740
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,283
I'll have housekeeping send up a
king-size synthetic straight away.

741
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,606
Very good, sir.

742
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,043
Where are the stars'?

743
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,046
Don't they even have
stars in the city?

744
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,203
Serena

745
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,806
<i>Wish you could hear me now</i>

746
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,206
<i>Hear me Serena</i>

747
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,247
<i>I need you near me now</i>

748
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,644
Serena, this is the best
wedding shower.

749
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,080
We're having so much fun.

750
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,521
This is such a lovely twig.

751
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,769
You really shouldn't have.

752
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,447
Wow, muck. Oh, you can never have
enough muck, can you, girls?

753
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,041
Thanks.

754
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,282
Thank you, thank you, not necessary.

755
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,562
Oh, yeah, muck. That's nice too.

756
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,841
Poor Louie.

757
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,970
Oh, I cannot bear to watch this,
my love.

758
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,367
I have sacrificed my honour...

759
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,806
...for naught.

760
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,921
Here we are, Lou. The big show.

761
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,283
I told you I'd take you
right to the top.

762
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,323
Whoa. Before you go out there, Lou...

763
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,882
...I have a little contract drawn up
that I need you to sign.

764
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,890
It's no big deal. You're exclusive
to me for a billion years...

765
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,607
...in this or any other galaxy yet to
be discovered, yada-yada-yada.

766
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,167
Just your standard
gentleman's agreement.

767
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,562
- Should I'?
- Come on, come on, come on.

768
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,047
With the cash you'll rake in,
you'll have enough...

769
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,686
...to buy a shiny new trumpet
and anything else you want.

770
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,680
Enough to repay the music store'?
How can I say no'?

771
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,244
Oh. yes!

772
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,644
Ladies and gentlemen...

773
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,767
...put your hands together for
Louie the trumpeter swan.

774
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,444
Go, Louie!

775
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,200
Bravo, Lou! They loved you. I got you
booked in the stadium on Saturday...

776
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,880
...and I'm very close to
a major network deal.

777
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,645
Here's your salary, kid.

778
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,250
Payday!

779
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,280
<i>There's a new bird in Boston
and his name is Louie.</i>

780
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,689
<i>He's a trumpeter swan that
really plays the trumpet.</i>

781
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,881
Louie!

782
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,050
<i>Tonight, the music of this amazing--</i>

783
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,801
You did it, Louie! You did it!
You're famous!

784
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,405
You've got a high approval rating,
my friend.

785
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,568
Well done.

786
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,644
Message from the Internut.

787
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,365
- This is terrible news!
- What could it be'?

788
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,800
The message is this:

789
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,402
Your girlfriend is gonna marry
the crooner...

790
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,491
...with the greasy feathers. Right,
tomorrow. I got it! I did it!

791
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,201
Serena and Boyd'?

792
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,640
Why didn't you come sooner?

793
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,406
So blame me. I made
a few nut stops, okay?

794
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,769
Go to her, youngster.

795
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,645
You might be behind in the polls...

796
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,890
...but remember, it's not over until
election day!

797
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,081
Good luck, Louie.

798
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,521
Lou, did you see the--'?

799
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,525
Not so fast, you fern-eating ingrate!

800
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,009
You, Lou, are my property!
You're not going nowhere.

801
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,726
I'll clip those wings
so you'll never fly again!

802
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,122
- He's got scissors!
- I hate scissors!

803
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,324
Hate to do it to you, Louie,
but money is money!

804
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,761
Stop, you!

805
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,404
Hey, you, over here! Hey, me!

806
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,002
Call my aides, I'm going in!

807
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,843
That's all right. I'm unharmed.

808
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,246
Take this!

809
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,727
Get away from me!

810
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,490
Free that swan!

811
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,051
Go, Louie! Fly like the wind!

812
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,047
- Are we nice and comfy there?
- Come on!

813
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,801
Quiet, it's about to start.
Serena, here she comes.

814
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,441
Oh, no!

815
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,841
Traffic!

816
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,043
Whoa! Sorry Mr. Presidents.
I've got to hurry.

817
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,683
Oh, heaven knows...

818
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,531
...I have known sadness
in my lifetime.

819
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,849
But never a sorrow such as this.

820
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,042
Louie will be so...

821
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,651
...heartbroken.

822
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,045
Oh, no, not now.

823
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,490
Do you, Boyd...

824
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,205
...take Serena...

825
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,165
...to be your lifelong mate'?

826
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,241
I do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

827
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,368
And do you, Serena...

828
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,766
...take Boyd...

829
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,203
...to be your lifelong mate'?

830
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,607
Whoever you are, wait your turn.

831
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,645
I haven't gotten to the part
about objections.

832
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,283
- Louie!
- Louie!

833
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,050
Oh. yeah!

834
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,891
That's beautiful.

835
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,721
- Okay, okay, what does it say'?
- It says that...

836
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,843
...Louie is mine...

837
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,244
...and I am his...

838
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,561
...forever.

839
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,089
So you can talk now, huh'?

840
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,090
Let's see what you have to say
without your stupid horn!

841
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,406
Oh, no, my voice!

842
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,362
There goes your love call, songbird.

843
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,848
Now get off my lake!
And don't come back!

844
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,964
Dangerous curves ahead.

845
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,731
Too bad old Boyd
never learned to read.

846
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,082
Help!

847
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,850
Somebody, help!

848
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,242
Daddy, I love Louie.

849
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,646
And he loves me.

850
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,086
I know, Serena.
I heard him loud and clear.

851
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,410
<i>When the moon would rise
I'd close my eyes</i>

852
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,082
<i>And dream of you and me</i>

853
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,365
<i>And tomorrow's when
I'd dream again</i>

854
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,404
<i>And in my dreams I'd see</i>

855
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,682
<i>We'd fly</i> away

856
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,721
<i>To a wondrous brand-new day</i>

857
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,841
<i>And we'd sail up there so high</i>

858
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,564
<i>We could touch the sky</i>

859
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,883
<i>We'd fly, we'd soar</i>

860
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,807
<i>Just you forevermore</i>

861
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,483
<i>And the stars shine in your eyes</i>

862
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,921
<i>We can touch the sky</i>

863
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,170
<i>You and me</i>

864
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,249
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

865
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,281
<i>And we'll dance upon the clouds</i>

866
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,890
<i>And I'll love you till I die</i>

867
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,041
<i>We could touch the sky</i>

868
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,121
<i>You and me</i>

869
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,884
I never heard your music
until today, son.

870
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,209
Now I feel your voice in my heart.

871
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,241
To think I once thought you were...

872
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,362
...defective.

873
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,406
Forgive me, Louie.
How little I knew.

874
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,570
It seems so long ago, that day
in the music store...

875
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,242
...when I took... When I--

876
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,041
Money?

877
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,445
Why are you giving me money'?

878
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,966
To pay for the trumpet.

879
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,170
Oh, Louie, this is the gift
of a lifetime!

880
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,008
Onward, my son...

881
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,123
...to Billings!

882
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,723
Ah, here is Billings.

883
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,649
The scene of my crime.

884
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,365
Thank you, Louie, for giving me
the chance to redeem my honour.

885
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,329
It's that swan thief!

886
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,522
No!

887
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,001
- He's got a gun!
- No! Don't shoot!

888
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,288
Father!

889
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,369
The end is near.

890
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,168
Man, in his folly,
has given me a mortal wound.

891
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,731
Oh, goodbye, beautiful world.

892
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,447
Farewell, sweet springtimes
I have known.

893
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,243
Adieu, loyal wife and loving children.

894
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,049
Now I die.

895
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,480
Gracefully...

896
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,045
...as really...

897
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,242
only a swan...

898
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,762
...can.

899
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,605
He's dead. The bird is dead.

900
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,486
Father.

901
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,650
Oh, Father.

902
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,047
I'm so sorry, Louie.

903
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,486
Look what you've done.
You killed a trumpeter swan.

904
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,208
These birds are endangered!

905
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,641
This endangered bird...

906
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,127
...swiped a trumpet from my store.

907
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,248
"To the storekeeper of Billings...

908
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,490
...enclosed please find
a whole lot of money.

909
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,684
This will be more than enough
to pay for the trumpet...

910
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,360
...and the damage to the store.

911
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,450
I am an honourable swan."

912
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,487
Looks like you made
a big mistake, buddy.

913
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,684
All right, people, stand back.

914
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,690
Could you let us through here,
please? We have an emergency.

915
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,484
It's just a superficial wound.

916
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,806
It is'? What's that? Say what?

917
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,405
He must've just fainted.

918
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,842
I have been at death's door...

919
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,166
...and now...

920
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,169
...I am reviving.

921
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,284
I shall once again glide gracefully...

922
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,562
...on the ponds of the world.

923
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,165
I want this money used to help save...

924
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,967
...the trumpeters.

925
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,362
That's what I'm gonna do
when I grow up.

926
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,961
I promise you, Louie.

927
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,891
I'll protect you.

928
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,442
You're a friend forever.

929
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:45,606
Darling, you're back.
You're back! How did it go'?

930
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,644
How did it go'?

931
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,768
"How did it go?" you ask.

932
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,930
There was gunfire! There was blood!

933
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,481
No, no, not Louie!

934
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,047
Not to worry, Serena.
It was I who died.

935
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,446
- Serena.
- Louie!

936
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,287
At first, I felt an agonizing pain
in my left shoulder...

937
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,485
...which I've always considered the
more beautiful of my two shoulders.

938
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,048
Blood gushed from my wound
in torrents...

939
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,403
...and I sank gracefully
to the sidewalk.

940
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,171
The police arrived. Dozens of them.

941
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,170
How did you know all this
if you were unconscious?

942
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,009
I wish you wouldn't interrupt when
I'm telling the story of my death.

943
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,330
Oh, of course. But I'm glad to
see you home safe.

944
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,251
I always miss you when you're gone.

945
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,481
Although I was faint,
I passed out with dignity.

946
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,284
My life flashed before me:

947
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,290
The ponds I have known, the winters
I have weathered...

948
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,211
...the summers of my wanton youth.

949
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,562
I was certain my time had come...

950
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,042
...when, suddenly...

951
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,250
...eggs!

952
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,690
My goodness.

953
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,564
Eggs!

954
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,285
That's right, my love.

955
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,891
Louie and Serena...

956
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,560
...are going to have a family.

957
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,721
Octuplets.

958
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,167
- I'm speechless!
- It's about time.

959
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,360
There's nothing in this world
I like more...

960
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,689
...than the sound of the trumpet
of the swan.

961
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,081
How lucky we are to inhabit
this beautiful earth.

962
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,285
How incredible it is to look forward
to another night of sleep...

963
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,211
...and the light that
returns with the day.

964
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,487
I wonder why the sun comes up
every morning after the darkness.

965
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,647
Welcome, my children.

966
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,241
