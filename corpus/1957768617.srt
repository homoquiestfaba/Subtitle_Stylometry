00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:24,300
These were the words 
of the police investigators

722
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:27,165
on hand today when 
questioned at City Hall

723
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,822
at a press conference.

724
00:42:28,856 --> 00:42:30,340
Police said that...

725
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:33,205
[crowd chatter]

726
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:38,141
I want these people
out of here now.

727
00:42:38,176 --> 00:42:40,281
No! No more questions.
We said everything

728
00:42:40,316 --> 00:42:41,800
we're going to say.
Thank you.
No more questions.

729
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:43,768
[Radio] We cannot catch a guy

730
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:46,943
running around with wires and plastic explosives,

731
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:48,600
crawling under you car.

732
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:49,877
Come on, people.

733
00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:53,122
Don't worry, Daddy,
I didn't tell Mom anything.

734
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:55,227
[Dad] 
I want it to be 
a surprise.

735
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:58,472
As far as she knows, my party
is a complete surprise.

736
00:42:58,506 --> 00:43:00,336
Okay. Well, get here 
as soon as you can.

737
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,027
I will. I'll hurry.

738
00:43:02,062 --> 00:43:03,891
I love you. 
I love you,
too, Daddy.

739
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:12,003
[ominous wordless choir]

740
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:22,082
[explosion]

741
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,435
I'm tellin' you,
this whole thing is nuts.

742
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:31,919
I agree with you.

743
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:35,095
Releasing Haflin,
a convicted felon.

744
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:36,303
So what?

745
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:37,649
He only has two months to go.

746
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:39,893
This woman's name
was Sandra.

747
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:41,619
Okay, it's
just like he said.

748
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:45,036
Sandra. How the hell
does he know that?

749
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,694
That's pretty thin,
don't you think?

750
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:50,524
When I was there, he never
had a single visitor.

751
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,322
He hasn't had
a visitor in 7 years.

752
00:43:57,704 --> 00:43:59,257
His cell is searched
daily.

753
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:00,430
Mail's clean.

754
00:44:00,465 --> 00:44:03,399
Never calls anybody,
and nobody calls him.

755
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,503
You talked to him
twice.

756
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:06,264
I think you qualify
as his best friend.

757
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:07,506
I'm flattered.

758
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:10,820
Captain Waters says we gotta
give him what he wants.

759
00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:12,235
Oh, he does,
does he?

760
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,685
Yeah.

761
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,894
He says, "What do we
threaten him with?

762
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:18,310
He's already
on Death Row."

763
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:21,555
What the hell is
the connection between
Haflin and Winston?

764
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:24,282
Haflin is
a small-time con artist.

765
00:44:24,316 --> 00:44:25,973
His father knew Winston.

766
00:44:26,008 --> 00:44:27,837
Well, you know now
that Haflin's out,

767
00:44:27,872 --> 00:44:29,425
he's gonna do
somethin' for Winston.

768
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,840
We're on him.

769
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:35,258
What I need you to do is take
another run at the daughter.

770
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:37,536
She hates me as much
as she hates her father.

771
00:44:37,571 --> 00:44:39,021
I hated my father
at times growing up,

772
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:40,229
but I still loved him.

773
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:42,645
How many women did
your father kill?

774
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,652
[police siren]

775
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,698
[car door closes]

776
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,392
[starts motor]

777
00:45:40,876 --> 00:45:43,464
[chatting]

778
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:48,228
[Guard]
Open number 2.

779
00:45:53,198 --> 00:45:55,580
Haflin, let's go.
You're out of here.

780
00:45:57,927 --> 00:45:58,928
[buzzer]

781
00:46:08,627 --> 00:46:09,836
The Attorney General
stuck his neck out,

782
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,389
but it's our head
that's in the noose.

783
00:46:11,423 --> 00:46:12,942
I wanna know where
Haflin is every second--

784
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:14,461
what he eats,
when he sleeps.

785
00:46:14,495 --> 00:46:17,153
This guy could shed some
light on the bombings.

786
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:18,361
I hope.
Okay.

787
00:46:18,396 --> 00:46:20,847
[Higgs]
Mr. Burton,
I'm very sorry

788
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,503
about what happened
to your daughter.

789
00:46:22,538 --> 00:46:24,954
They give the beginning
detectives the grief
counseling, huh?

790
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:27,301
Listen, I will do
everything possible

791
00:46:27,336 --> 00:46:29,510
to make sure that
justice is served.

792
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:30,546
You know how I see it?

793
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,410
Justice?

794
00:46:32,444 --> 00:46:36,379
It would have been just
if my daughter could have
lived her whole life out.

795
00:46:38,968 --> 00:46:40,452
I'd feel a lot
better, detective,

796
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:42,696
if you had a little
less shoe leather.

797
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:55,191
Grief counseling!

798
00:46:56,675 --> 00:46:57,953
Shoe leather!

799
00:46:57,987 --> 00:47:00,196
What the hell is that supposed
to mean, "shoe leather"?

800
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:02,474
I think he's right.

801
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:05,132
He didn't come here
to see a preacher, you know.

802
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,548
He's lookin'
for a bad-ass cop.

803
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,240
Like you were?
Yeah.

804
00:47:09,274 --> 00:47:10,724
Well, look where
it got you.

805
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:14,210
I always hated this office.

806
00:47:25,152 --> 00:47:26,844
[knock at door]

807
00:47:29,777 --> 00:47:31,434
[knocking]Dee, open up!

808
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:36,439
Come on, I know
you're in there.[pounding]

809
00:47:36,474 --> 00:47:37,440
Let's go!

810
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:38,994
Ernie, is that you?

811
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:40,719
Who else are
you expecting?

812
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,171
You never know!

813
00:47:44,206 --> 00:47:45,793
You gonna let
your brother in?

814
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:51,627
You alone?

815
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,180
I doubt it.

816
00:47:54,285 --> 00:47:55,631
You look good.

817
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:56,632
[stuttering]
You-- You-- You--

818
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:57,702
You look like crap.

819
00:47:57,736 --> 00:47:59,048
[mocking]
You-- You-- You-- You.

820
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:02,189
You spend five years
in a crap hole,
you look like crap.

821
00:48:06,228 --> 00:48:08,333
Winston r-really
got you out, huh?

822
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:10,059
When are you gonna grow up?

823
00:48:12,027 --> 00:48:13,131
How is the old man?

824
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:14,857
How's he supposed to be?

825
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,411
He's lookin'
at the needle
in a few days.

826
00:48:17,446 --> 00:48:19,379
H-He say anything about me?

827
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:23,624
You? Yeah, he
sends his regards.

828
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:25,143
That's it?

829
00:48:25,178 --> 00:48:27,835
His regards?
Nice fish.

830
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,941
That's what he said?
He sends his "regards"?

831
00:48:29,976 --> 00:48:31,253
Nothin' else?

832
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:33,911
Nothin' else what?

833
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,222
Winston. Nothin'
else about me?

834
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:37,397
No.

835
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:39,192
What's he supposed
to say? I mean,

836
00:48:39,226 --> 00:48:41,090
it's hard enough
for him to get a message
to me, you know?

837
00:48:43,368 --> 00:48:44,507
What'd he get you out for?

838
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:46,406
He's got an errand 
he wants done.

839
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,511
I guess
I'm the only guy
he trusts.

840
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:49,927
What?

841
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:52,826
Just a little something.

842
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,793
That doesn't concern you.

843
00:48:57,175 --> 00:48:59,971
The department's profiler
thinks Winston's daughter

844
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:03,078
fits the psychological M.O.
for a serial killer.

845
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:06,667
Let me ask you a question.

846
00:49:06,702 --> 00:49:08,531
Where Janice works,

847
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:09,981
does she have
access to chemicals,

848
00:49:10,016 --> 00:49:11,431
stuff to put
together a bomb?

849
00:49:11,465 --> 00:49:13,088
She not only
has access,

850
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:14,503
she has the expertise
to use it.

851
00:49:18,024 --> 00:49:19,957
You fight southpaw?
Yeah.

852
00:49:21,682 --> 00:49:23,339
But you're right-handed.

853
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:24,754
Yeah.

854
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:27,516
Yeah, I've-- I've never
boxed a southpaw before.

855
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,069
Nothin' to it.

856
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:38,768
Now, see how I made you
move to your left?

857
00:49:38,803 --> 00:49:40,529
Yeah.
What am I doin'?

858
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:41,599
I'm making you
go left.

859
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:42,669
Yeah?
You know why?

860
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:43,670
Why?

861
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:45,051
Ohh!

862
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:46,604
You don't wanna come
into that hook, see?

863
00:49:46,638 --> 00:49:47,674
Yeah.

864
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:50,332
So, you wanna keep
circling this way, right?

865
00:49:50,366 --> 00:49:52,748
Ah! Uh-oh. A punch.

866
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:55,233
Yeah?
I'm not as fast
as I used to be.

867
00:49:55,268 --> 00:49:57,960
Mm-hmm.I lead with my right,
you just come over the top.

868
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,272
Like this!

869
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:04,208
Or like that?

870
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:08,039
Yeah.

871
00:50:09,075 --> 00:50:10,110
Felt good.

872
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:14,563
Thinking maybe, uh...

873
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:17,186
I should ask Janice 
a couple of questions.

874
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:21,673
Well...do yourself
a favor.

875
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:23,744
Stay away from Janice.
Yeah?

876
00:50:23,779 --> 00:50:26,195
Sounds more like you're
doing yourself a favor.

877
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,369
Really?
Yeah!

878
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:29,336
Ohh!
[Man] Ohh! Ohh!

879
00:50:29,371 --> 00:50:30,820
Listen, kid...

880
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:32,788
I don't do anybody favors.

881
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:36,033
[breathlessly]
That was a good punch.

882
00:50:41,866 --> 00:50:43,316
Hi.

883
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:47,906
Flowers are the earth's
way of smiling.

884
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:49,805
You read that in a book?

885
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,910
A book by Tibetan monks.

886
00:50:51,945 --> 00:50:54,051
And what's so special
about them?

887
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:58,710
Because they give
their lives to God?

888
00:50:58,745 --> 00:51:00,057
Can I come in for a second?

889
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:02,576
I'll leave, you know.

890
00:51:02,611 --> 00:51:04,889
I mean, all you gotta do
is just say go, and...

891
00:51:04,923 --> 00:51:06,960
I'm outta here. Okay?

892
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:11,309
You're a cop?

893
00:51:11,344 --> 00:51:12,897
Well, I used to be,
yeah.

894
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,831
My name is Logan McQueen.

895
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:18,627
I don't have
all day, Mr. McQueen.

896
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:21,008
Yeah, I can see

no psychic. He's psycho.

asking for forgiveness.

01:23:11,641 --> 01:23:15,024
I b-b-bet you can't
catch me. [laughs]

1424
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,440
Come on, Logan!

1425
01:23:19,753 --> 01:23:20,788
Oh, yeah!

1426
01:23:30,729 --> 01:23:33,732
[grunting]

1427
01:23:33,767 --> 01:23:36,908
[crashing]

1428
01:23:36,942 --> 01:23:39,876
Oh, you lost your gun.

1429
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:43,190
You can't come up here
without your gun.

1430
01:23:43,225 --> 01:23:45,123
The hell I can't.

1431
01:23:55,099 --> 01:23:56,893
[clinking]

1432
01:24:08,008 --> 01:24:10,631
Kaboom!
Ha ha ha ha!

1433
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:12,219
Ha ha ha ha![clattering]

1434
01:24:12,254 --> 01:24:13,772
Where's the ball?
Where's the ball?

1435
01:24:13,807 --> 01:24:15,119
Ha ha ha ha!

1436
01:24:15,153 --> 01:24:17,638
[clattering]Oh! Run!

1437
01:24:17,673 --> 01:24:19,882
[giggling maniacally]

1438
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:22,919
No, don't.
Don't come up.

1439
01:24:22,954 --> 01:24:25,025
Don't. No, no, no.

1440
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,440
Don't-- Don't come up!

1441
01:24:31,307 --> 01:24:32,619
Aaah! Aaahh!
Aaahh! Aah!

1442
01:24:32,653 --> 01:24:33,896
Aah! Aaahh!

1443
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:34,931
Aaaahhh!

1444
01:24:37,693 --> 01:24:39,074
Get away!

1445
01:24:39,108 --> 01:24:40,351
Get away from me.

1446
01:24:40,385 --> 01:24:41,938
Get away from me!

1447
01:24:45,804 --> 01:24:47,427
No! No!

1448
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:50,637
Uuhh! Ohh!

1449
01:25:13,246 --> 01:25:15,662
I, uh...

1450
01:25:15,696 --> 01:25:17,215
wrote this for her.

1451
01:25:19,562 --> 01:25:20,770
I tried to...

1452
01:25:24,981 --> 01:25:27,052
...I don't know,
write it all down.

1453
01:25:29,469 --> 01:25:32,782
Tried to explain it. I--
I don't know that I even...

1454
01:25:32,817 --> 01:25:35,371
can explain it
to myself.

1455
01:25:44,277 --> 01:25:46,969
You know
I can't take that.

1456
01:25:47,003 --> 01:25:48,350
[indistinct prisoner shouting]

1457
01:25:55,633 --> 01:25:57,359
I just, uh...

1458
01:25:59,706 --> 01:26:02,295
I'd like her to know
that I loved her.

1459
01:26:04,331 --> 01:26:05,401
That's all.

1460
01:26:07,921 --> 01:26:11,131
I'm afraid it's...
late.

1461
01:26:14,445 --> 01:26:16,309
I'm goin' down soon.

1462
01:26:20,589 --> 01:26:22,349
There are, uh...

1463
01:26:22,384 --> 01:26:26,767
are not gonna be
any friendly faces.

1464
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:32,394
I wonder...

1465
01:26:32,428 --> 01:26:37,088
would you...please
be there for me?

1466
01:26:45,545 --> 01:26:46,787
Yes.

1467
01:26:56,003 --> 01:26:58,765
[buzzer]

1468
01:26:58,799 --> 01:27:01,768
[Woman on radio] 
And according to a spokesman 
for the Mayor's Office,

1469
01:27:01,802 --> 01:27:04,322
a vote will be forthcoming.

1470
01:27:04,357 --> 01:27:05,979
And in other news...

1471
01:27:06,013 --> 01:27:08,361
He came in drunk
while I was closin'.

1472
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:10,363
I watered his
drinks, but, uh...

1473
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:12,606
smells like
a long-term bender
to me.

1474
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:15,264
[Radio] 
...was executed 
at 12:01 this morning.

1475
01:27:15,299 --> 01:27:18,163
Ray Earl Winston had been 
on Death Row for over...

1476
01:27:18,198 --> 01:27:19,855
Come on, guy.

1477
01:27:19,889 --> 01:27:21,270
Oh, Logan.
Come on.

1478
01:27:21,305 --> 01:27:23,893
Logan...you
gotta talk to me.

1479
01:27:23,928 --> 01:27:26,931
You gotta.
I can't stand it.

1480
01:27:31,901 --> 01:27:33,075
All right, Bo.

1481
01:27:36,181 --> 01:27:37,321
Here you go.

1482
01:27:39,323 --> 01:27:42,395
[panting heavily]

1483
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:43,430
Logan?

1484
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:45,570
Logan.

1485
01:27:47,745 --> 01:27:49,885
You gotta forgive me.

1486
01:27:49,919 --> 01:27:51,887
[tearfully]
I can't stand it.

1487
01:27:52,888 --> 01:27:54,890
Uh...Logan?

1488
01:27:54,924 --> 01:27:56,409
Are you out
of breath, Logan?

1489
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:01,034
[mumbling]

1490
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:03,312
Oh. You're
there, Logan.

1491
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:14,841
Well, Sebastian.

1492
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:17,464
I've read the book
four times now.

1493
01:28:18,776 --> 01:28:21,330
I'm doing
all right on balance.

1494
01:28:22,607 --> 01:28:25,748
But I'm still working 
on forgiveness.

1495
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:26,956
Thank you.

1496
01:28:30,512 --> 01:28:32,341
That's just what
I wanted to say.

1497
01:28:34,274 --> 01:28:36,552
[seagulls squawking]

1498
01:28:39,141 --> 01:28:40,418
Well.

1499
01:28:41,799 --> 01:28:44,629
What a fantastic job
you've done of healing.

1500
01:28:44,664 --> 01:28:45,872
[laughs]

1501
01:28:55,399 --> 01:28:57,780
You sure know how
to flatter a girl.

1502
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:06,720
The prison sent, um...

1503
01:29:06,755 --> 01:29:09,205
sent me a letter
from my father.

1504
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,414
Yes.

1505
01:29:12,105 --> 01:29:15,142
No, I can't forget what
he was or what he did.

1506
01:29:17,697 --> 01:29:21,908
Forgetting and forgiveness
are very far apart.

1507
01:29:27,292 --> 01:29:28,639
Should I read it?

1508
01:29:30,226 --> 01:29:31,227
Well...

1509
01:29:32,505 --> 01:29:34,265
I think that's
something that

1510
01:29:34,299 --> 01:29:35,991
you'll have to decide

1511
01:29:36,025 --> 01:29:37,786
all by yourself.

1512
01:29:42,446 --> 01:29:45,000
[tearing paper]

1513
01:29:47,692 --> 01:29:48,728
[chuckles]

1514
01:29:49,867 --> 01:29:50,868
[sigh]

1515
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,423
[Sebastian] 
Perhaps someday

1516
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:57,012
that will resonate within.

1517
01:29:57,046 --> 01:29:59,566
When it does,

1518
01:29:59,601 --> 01:30:04,191
touch one so that 
others may be touched.
