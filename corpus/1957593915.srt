[car horns honking]

8
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,698
- Could you spare some
money for the tooth fairy?

9
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,942
Well thank you, thank you
so much, you're so sweet.

10
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,495
Hello there, I know
what you're thinking.

11
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:06,703
You think I'm gonna
ask you for money

12
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:07,601
and well I am,

13
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,327
but it's not for what you think.

14
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:11,156
You see, I am the tooth fairy
and I need your spare change

15
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:13,123
to give to the deserving
children of the neighborhood.

16
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:14,573
- Sh.
- No?

17
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,265
Well, hello, do you
have any spare change

18
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:17,162
for the tooth fairy?

19
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,336
Thank you.

20
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,096
Thank you very much.

21
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:20,959
Oh jeez.

22
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:21,753
- Yo, Briefcase.

23
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:26,551
Spare some change for Santa's
hippest helper? [laughing]

24
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,967
Gotta give back to the North
Pole before the big day.

25
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:30,900
- You still going
with the elf bit?

26
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:32,971
- Well Christmas is
only a few months away.

27
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,456
Any brother or sister
with holiday cheer

28
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:37,562
be giving their change to me.

29
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,011
Check out my new elf dance.

30
00:03:41,497 --> 00:03:42,532
- Oh yeah.

31
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:45,777
Whoa, whoa big fella.

32
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,503
Originality is what
made this country great.

33
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:48,952
Remember I said that.

34
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,953
- [Muskat] I'll write it down.

35
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:51,610
- You better.

36
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:52,818
Could you spare some change
for the tooth fairy fund?

37
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:56,581
[air whooshing]

38
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:02,587
Oh excuse me.

39
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:06,246
Home sweet home, yes sir.

40
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:10,388
[groans] Oh, that's
getting pretty ripe.

41
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:12,873
Where's my girls?

42
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,773
Hey, girls where you gone?

43
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:19,535
Ah, here's my girls.

44
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,022
Yeah, here's my girls.

45
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:26,369
Hi girls.

46
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,164
Me?

47
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,717
I had a pretty good day.

48
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:33,583
Yeah, everybody at the
office says hi. [chuckles]

49
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:38,864
[gentle music]
[girl laughing]

50
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,626
[Briefcase sobbing]

51
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,499
There's my love.

52
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:59,575
[upbeat music]

53
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:01,439
Oh hey little girl, hello, hi,

54
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:02,957
I'd like to introduce myself.

55
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,375
My name is Briefcase
and I am a tooth fairy.

56
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:10,517
- So, why do they
call you Briefcase?

57
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:12,070
- Well 'cause when
I first moved here

58
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,072
I used to carry a briefcase.

59
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,522
What's your name?

60
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,489
- Mary Elizabeth, but
no one calls me that

61
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:18,663
except my mother.

62
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:20,078
Everybody calls me Lizbeth.

63
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:23,392
- Well, it's nice to
meet you, Lizbeth.

64
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,015
- Well, bye.

65
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:27,292
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Lizbeth, Lizbeth,

66
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,501
did you happen to lose a tooth?

67
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,192
- Sure, lots of times.

68
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,263
- [Briefcase] And didn't the
tooth fairy give you money?

69
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:34,299
- No.

70
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:35,990
- No?

71
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,406
Oh well that must have been
before I was the tooth fairy

72
00:05:37,544 --> 00:05:39,062
in this territory.

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,651
I guarantee that the next
time that you lose a tooth,

74
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,412
the tooth fairy is
gonna give you money,

75
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,585
how's that sound?

76
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:45,621
- Well I won't hold my breath.

77
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,174
- Hey, hey, you know,

78
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:48,693
you're about the oldest
little girl I ever met.

79
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:50,108
Who told you not believe
in the tooth fairy?

80
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,558
- Too old to believe
in stuff like that.

81
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:52,662
- No, you ain't never too old

82
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,732
to believe in stuff like that.

83
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,389
- My mum said you people who ask

84
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:58,703
for change in streets are
winos and no-account drunks.

85
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,188
- Oh, well your mum is right,

86
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:04,433
but you know, sometimes people
can be two things at once.

87
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:05,882
Take me for example,

88
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,230
I am a wino, but I'm
also the tooth fairy.

89
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,991
Hey, look at this.

90
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,994
Last night I had to visit a
little girl just like you.

91
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:16,721
I went into her house
and I found that

92
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,308
and I put some money
under her pillow.

93
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:20,518
See, see, that's how it works.

94
00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:22,209
- You could have
gotten that anywhere.

95
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:23,555
- Well of course I could.

96
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:25,005
You kids lose your teeth
everywhere you know,

97
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:26,834
but I gotta find
'em just the same.

98
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:28,560
You know, sometimes it takes
me a couple of extra days

99
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:30,182
but I always get there.

100
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,667
You just have to have faith.

101
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,323
You know what faith is?

102
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,119
- Yeah, it's what you
need to believe in stuff,

103
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:39,191
like God, even though
you never see Him.

104
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:41,228
Bad things always happen.

105
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,024
- Well yeah, I mean I guess
that's one way to define it,

106
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:46,544
but I mean it's
a bad way for you

107
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:48,787
because, you know,
you're so young and all.

108
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:51,307
- Ho, ho, ho.

109
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,343
- Give it a rest
will ya, Muskat?

110
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:55,622
See, faith is like that Lizbeth,

111
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,763
but if you lose your
faith in everything,

112
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,628
like God and the
tooth fairy, well,

113
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,044
then you're gonna
be sad all the time.

114
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:06,391
You don't wanna be sad
all the time do ya?

115
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,220
- No.

116
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:11,327
My mommy said it's not nice
for little girls to cry.

117
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,640
- Well your mom is
certainly right about that.

118
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:15,227
Especially on airplanes.

119
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:18,092
Never, ever cry on airplanes.

120
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,233
- Mary Elizabeth, get
over here right now!

121
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:22,580
What are you doing?

122
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,374
- [Lizbeth] I have
to go now, bye.

123
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:25,514
- Bye.

124
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:33,211
Boy, that is one
mixed up little girl.

125
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:36,076
Could you imagine her not
having faith in God or anything?

126
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:39,182
- You don't.

127
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,806
- We are talking about
the little girl, Muskat.

128
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,194
- Two, I thought it was four.

129
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:53,956
Oh man.

130
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:56,545
[door thuds]

131
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:01,032
Mary Elizabeth, is that you?

132
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:03,552
I have a surprise.

133
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,520
- It's just me, baby. [laughs]

134
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:09,834
What are you up to?

135
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,698
- What are you up to?

136
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:14,010
- Nothing, just calm down, baby.

137
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:16,426
- Don't you baby me.

138
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:18,118
I don't want that in the house.

139
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:20,500
Mary Elizabeth is
gonna be home soon.

140
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:21,742
She could find it.

141
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,812
- Will you be cool,

142
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,882
I'm gonna hide it in a place

143
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,298
where she'll never find it.

144
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:30,268
- I want you and that
thing out of my house.

145
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:32,995
[dramatic music]

146
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,169
- [sighs] Home sweet...

147
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:37,413
[somber music]

148
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,414
Oh no.

149
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,313
Oh no, no.

150
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:44,558
Baby, baby [sobbing].

151
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:46,146
No, no, please, no!

152
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:54,810
I got you, I got you.

153
00:08:56,846 --> 00:09:00,022
[Briefcase sobbing]

154
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:09,583
- Ho, ho, ho.

155
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,791
Ho, ho, ho.

156
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,449
- Briefcase, Briefcase.

157
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,624
My friend Resa said she got
visited by the tooth fairy.

158
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,349
- Yeah, well look kid, you know,

159
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,006
now is not a really good time.

160
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:21,284
- Did you really give her
that 10 bucks for her tooth?

161
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:23,252
- [snickers] 10 bucks, $10,

162
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,772
yeah, sure, I mean
yeah, you know I mean,

163
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,912
she's a good kid you know

164
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,292
and she went through
a lot of pain,

165
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,915
so she gets the big bucks.

166
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,537
- Resa thinks it was her father

167
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:34,263
who put the $10
under her pillow.

168
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:36,921
- Well, you know, usually I
let the daddy do the leg work.

169
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,337
See, that way the
dad and the kid,

170
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:41,270
they get some quality
time together.

171
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:43,272
Any more questions
before you go?

172
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,102
- What if you
don't have a daddy?

173
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:51,729
- Oh.

174
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:57,769
Well, well, then I guess I
have to do that by myself.

175
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:01,497
You know, with my tooth
fairy magic. [laughs]

176
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,360
- [Lizbeth] Really?

177
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:03,257
- Yeah.

178
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:03,948
[Muskat laughing]

179
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:04,845
What?

180
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:06,260
- Yeah B, why don't you show us

181
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,918
a little of your
tooth fairy magic?

182
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:10,782
- Well you know I'm still
trying to recharge myself

183
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,266
from last night,

184
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,235
but I'm sure I can
muster up a little power,

185
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:16,754
you know what I'm saying?
- Can you?

186
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:17,720
- Give me a quarter.
- What?

187
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,411
- Give me a quarter.

188
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:22,000
[bright music]

189
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:26,418
There's your magic trick.

190
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:27,488
Ready?

191
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,111
Watching, ready, watch closely.

192
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:34,841
[breath blowing]

193
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:37,982
[Briefcase laughing]

194
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,708
- You really must
be the tooth fairy.

195
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,019
- See now you're getting it.

196
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:42,711
- Oh yeah, now I'm
Santa's helper.

197
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:44,367
- There is no Santa Claus.

198
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:45,334
- [Briefcase] Sure there is.

199
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:46,853
Well did your mom tell you that?

200
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:48,648
- No, it's just he
didn't come last year

201
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:49,925
or the year before that.

202
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:51,340
So what good is he?

203
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:55,275
- Well you know, Santa's
had a couple of problems

204
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:56,517
over the last couple
of Christmases,

205
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,312
you know I mean, last year,

206
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,452
last year he had that
reindeer, broke a hoof,

207
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,971
you know and then
they had to shoot him

208
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:03,283
in the head over Greenland.

209
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,010
- Santa shoots his reindeer?

210
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:07,908
- Oh no, no, no,
not Santa, no, no,

211
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:10,980
it was this mean dwarf.

212
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:11,912
- Elf.

213
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,913
- Elf, yeah, it was a mean elf.

214
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:13,776
Yeah.
- Stinky.

215
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:14,743
- Yeah, Stinky,

216
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,434
Stinky the Elf, yeah.

217
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:17,953
- I don't like Stinky the Elf.

218
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:21,163
- So, Lizbeth, come sit down.

219
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:25,339
You know being a tooth
fairy in this area,

220
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,996
you know I was
looking in my records

221
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:30,759
and well I noticed that well,

222
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:31,898
that you haven't put any money

223
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:34,417
into the tooth fairy fund.

224
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:36,419
- The tooth fairy fund?

225
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:37,766
- Well yeah you see,

226
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:38,974
well Santa Claus,
he works pro bono,

227
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:40,976
that means for free,

228
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:42,356
but the tooth fairy you see,

229
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,634
they can only operate
if you put money

230
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:45,808
into the tooth fairy fund.

231
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:47,016
- Oh man.

232
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:48,742
- Hey hey, those
aren't my rules.

233
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,399
Right, it's the head
tooth fairy's rules

234
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:51,572
and you know, I'm
telling you, Lizbeth,

235
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,057
he is a hard case.

236
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,679
- Is he part wino too?

237
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:56,336
- No, no, no, no.

238
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:58,994
To be head tooth fairy you
gotta be all tooth fairy.

239
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,617
I mean and some day I might
become head tooth fairy,

240
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,343
but now I gotta follow the rules

241
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,655
and what, what was
your friend's name?

242
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:07,140
- Resa.

243
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:08,589
- Resa, well see Resa
looking at my records,

244
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,488
I saw that Resa had
already put money in.

245
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,801
See, being a member of
the tooth fairy fund,

246
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:16,494
well it's like being
in social security.

247
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:19,186
You gotta put money in before
you can take money out.

248
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:20,153
- Hatcha matcha.

249
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:22,672
- Put in?

250
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:23,812
- Put that money in.

251
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:26,918
Before you can get any out.

252
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,057
You understand?

253
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:33,718
[Muskat laughing]

254
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:35,582
- And then Briefcase,
he tells her

255
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,653
that the tooth fairy operates

256
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,414
the same way as social security.

257
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:44,108
You gotta put money
in to take some out.

258
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:45,523
- I had the heebie jeebies,

259
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:46,766
you know, you guys
know, I'm sweating it.

260
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:48,112
I'm itching and stuff.

261
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,390
- And then this little girl,

262
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:54,083
I mean the sweetest little
girl you ever wanted to see,

263
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,120
she looks up at
him and she says,

264
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:59,123
"I wanna put in to
the tooth fairy fund.

265
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,711
"Will you take these
cans?" [laughing]

266
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,094
- All right, all right, that's
enough I say, enough, enough!

267
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,647
- [Muskat] You're
the king, Briefcase.

268
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,720
You are the freakin' tooth
fairy king. [guffaws]

269
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:14,552
See, he knows how to deal with
them kids, 'cause he had one.

270
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,934
- Hey, hey, hey you would
have done the same thing.

271
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:20,903
The same [gasping]

272
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,872
- [Man] Briefcase you all right?

273
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,012
- Jimmy, Jimmy, help me.

274
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,291
- Briefcase, Briefcase.

275
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:32,052
[somber music]

276
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:36,056
[monitor beeping]

277
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:38,162
[Briefcase snores]

278
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,751
[Briefcase gasping]

279
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,306
- Hey, hey, take it easy now.

280
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:45,686
- I'm not dead?

281
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,136
- Take it easy, go slow.

282
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:50,968
- Oh, Preacher. [sighs]

283
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:56,559
Oh, don't tell me I'm in
that lousy clinic of yours.

284
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:58,113
- The very same.

285
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:01,012
- [sighs] Any port
in a storm I guess.

286
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:04,257
- You're lucky to be alive.

287
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:07,260
- Yeah, maybe I should
buy a lottery ticket.

288
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:10,332
Couldn't hurt, right.

289
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:13,473
- I'm gonna read this to you.

290
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:17,063
Myocardial infarction,
that's a heart attack.

291
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:19,928
Based on your echo cardiogram,

292
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:22,137
your heart's in
pretty dismal shape

293
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,035
and your liver enzymes are high.

294
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,451
So on the verge of failure.

295
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:28,902
- What are you a doctor now?

296
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,974
- It doesn't take a doctor
to see what a mess you're in.

297
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:33,596
- I did see a white light.

298
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:36,530
No, no, that was Sinatra
singing at the Sands.

299
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,085
No, no, maybe that
was just a paramedic

300
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:42,467
shocking me back to
life, huh? [laughs]

301
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,607
- You know the lack of
oxygen to your brain

302
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:46,471
has not affected your sarcasm.

303
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:49,129
What it is with you Briefcase,

304
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,682
how can you be so smart

305
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,720
and not see how bad
your situation is?

306
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:57,517
- I guess it's the same way
you call shrimp jumbo. [laughs]

307
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,760
- I don't know how
to tell you this.

308
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,729
But in Dr. Thompson's opinion,

309
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,213
you only have a year to live,

310
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:06,008
two at the most if you're lucky.

311
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:07,699
- Is that a joke?

312
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:09,287
'Cause if you're joking,

313
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,669
you better work on your
bedside manner, Preacher.

314
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:15,535
Are you joking or are you
just trying to trick me?

315
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:18,262
- We're not the Mayo
Clinic, we could be wrong.

316
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,573
Maybe you'll live 10 years

317
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,161
if you just take
care of yourself.

318
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,749
- Or I could die next week,

319
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,164
is that what you're sayin'?

320
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,097
That I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die alone

321
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,478
in a filthy gutter?

322
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:28,997
- I mean how could
you expect to live

323
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,999
the way you were living,
and not have a bad--

324
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,690
- I don't need you
preaching at me.

325
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:36,487
I'm sorry.

326
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,076
I'm sorry, but

327
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,392
what I meant was, this is a
lot to take in in five minutes.

328
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:48,085
I just wanna be alone.

329
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:50,880
[gentle music]

330
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,296
- Stay as long as you like.

331
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:59,406
[monitor beeping]

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,796
[traffic whooshing]

333
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:12,592
[chips crunching]

334
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,700
- [Clerk] Rummie,
how you doing today?

335
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:19,944
- Can't believe it, it's
like I'm on autopilot.

336
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:22,740
- You know I was just reading
about you in the newspaper.

337
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:25,329
Did you know that 10%
of the boozers out there

338
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:28,815
account for 99% of
all the alcohol sales.

339
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:31,680
- You're full of all sorts of
fun facts today, aren't ya?

340
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:34,717
- [Clerk] Hey, if it wasn't for
you, I'd be out of business.

341
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:35,649
What'll it be today?

342
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,791
- Is this stuff supposed
to be good for ya?

343
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,105
- Well it's the healthiest
of the jerky family.

344
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,832
99% fat free.

345
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,903
But Olympians don't train on it.

346
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,078
- Well, I'll take one.

347
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:53,081
- And?

348
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:58,189
- And, hey two years
is a long time,

349
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:00,536
wouldn't you say?

350
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,368
- [laughs] Yeah, especially
if somebody is poking ya

351
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:06,059
in the butt with a sharp stick.

352
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:09,269
[both laughing]

353
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:13,549
- Yeah, ah heck, give
me a pint of penicillin.

354
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:14,412
- Huh?

355
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,275
- Vodka.

356
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,105
- Oh, okay, yeah.

357
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,247
- Hey, how much is this?

358
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,320
- Not enough, you don't
have enough money.

359
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,737
- Make it a half pint then.

360
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,877
- There is nothing
in there to drink.

361
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,258
- Yeah, I know.

362
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:33,328
- [Clerk] It's a pinwheel.

363
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:34,329
- I know, I want it anyway.

364
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,364
- You can't drink this.

365
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:36,814
- Hey, look what is this?

366
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:38,609
Can't a guy buy a pinwheel?

367
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:40,404
- I'm willing to go along
with you on the jerky thing,

368
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:41,819
'cause a man's gotta eat.

369
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:43,821
But the rest of the
10% of the boozers

370
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,720
are gonna be very
disappointed in you, Rummie.

371
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,791
You're not maximizing your
alcohol purchase here.

372
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:50,690
- Look, just ring me up.

373
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:53,072
- Okay.

374
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,077
Change.

375
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:01,149
- Thanks a lot.

376
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:07,016
- Briefcase, I'm
telling you, [laughs]

377
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:09,018
you really scared me there.

378
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:11,987
- Who needs extreme sports
when we got extreme living.

379
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:16,164
- Yeah, [chuckles] so, you
gonna do anything different?

380
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:19,857
- I don't think so,
I don't know, maybe.

381
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,171
- Well that was quick.

382
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:24,931
[bright music]

383
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:29,038
Hey, here comes your little
ray of sunshine. [chuckles]

384
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:32,249
You know, she looks kinda irate,

385
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:35,148
I'll see you back in a bit.

386
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:36,115
- Yeah.

387
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:42,914
- Resa said she didn't put money

388
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:44,468
into the tooth fairy fund.

389
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:46,677
And neither did her father.

390
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,575
- Well, I never
tell the daddies.

391
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:51,751
You know, daddies have to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

392
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:53,753
Hey, come on up here and
sit with me, come on.

393
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:56,687
Now, I was looking
in my records,

394
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:59,379
and well I noticed that
you're owed some back gifts

395
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:01,347
from both Santa and
the tooth fairy.

396
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:05,385
So, here we go,
nothing up my sleeves.

397
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:07,422
A little tooth fairy magic.

398
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,908
Then, surprise.

399
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,361
[Briefcase laughs]

400
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:16,776
It's a pinwheel.

401
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:19,848
- Well, what does it do?

402
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:21,608
- Well you know, you
run along with it

403
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,507
and the wind blows through
it and it spins around.

404
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,854
- It looks kinda lame to me.

405
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:28,650
- Oh.

406
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:31,515
Well, well, you know
Santa always gives

407
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,344
the lamest back presents first,

408
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:34,863
but you know, they get better.

409
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:37,383
Here, why don't
you give it a try.

410
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:39,385
[bright music]

411
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:41,559
Well, get up and
move around with it.

412
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:42,526
Yeah.

413
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,081
Back and forth.

414
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,945
Here, you know, let me
show you, let me show you.

415
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,533
- Like that.
- Yeah, hold it out like that

416
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:51,535
and let it catch
the wind, there.

417
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:56,264
Try running with it, see
what what happens, yeah.

418
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:57,541
Run, run, run.

419
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,784
Run, run with it, yeah.

420
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:03,512
Look at it spinning,
huh? [chuckles]

421
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:06,343
Lizbeth?

422
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,345
Lizbeth?

423
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,418
Lizbeth, Lizbeth?

424
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:13,764
[Lizbeth sobbing]

425
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:14,903
You're not supposed
to fall with it,

426
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:15,938
you're supposed to run with it.

427
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:17,975
Don't cry, don't cry.

428
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:20,391
Remember little girls
who cry aren't pretty.

429
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,497
Think of happy things
like puppy dogs

430
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:24,844
and dollies and stuff like that.

431
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:32,231
What?

432
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,578
- Look at this.

433
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:35,958
- Well, that's great.

434
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:37,443
Now the tooth fairy's
gonna give ya--

435
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,447
- And Resa only got $10 dollars

436
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:44,243
and I went through more
pain than her, huh?

437
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:45,002
- Well.

438
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:50,387
- Good thing I just to put money

439
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:51,698
into the tooth fairy fund, huh?

440
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,114
- Well, that's
always a good thing.

441
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,220
- What was that thing,
you know that thing

442
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:58,464
that I have to do before I
get my tooth fairy money?

443
00:20:58,602 --> 00:20:59,879
- Be fully vested.

444
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,365
- Fully vested, well I am.

445
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:07,473
[Briefcase chuckles]

446
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:08,853
Are you still the tooth fairy

447
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,166
or are you gonna
change your story now?

448
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:14,618
- Lizbeth, I am the tooth fairy.

449
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:16,758
- Okay then, this will
be waiting for you

450
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:18,484
under my pillow.

451
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:19,968
Bye, Briefcase.

452
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:23,765
- [groans] $10.

453
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:27,907
[bright upbeat music]

454
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:39,090
- Yeah, here you go.

455
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:40,506
- No, sorry.

456
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:41,610
- [Man] Here.

457
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:43,509
- [Woman] Get away.

458
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:45,994
- [Man] I don't have anything.

459
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:49,308
- [Man] No, no.

460
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:56,107
- No, no, stop,
sorry, sorry, don't.

461
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:57,385
- [Clerk] Get outta here.

462
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:58,765
- Hey, hey, hey.

463
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,253
$11.

464
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:06,083
I need 11 one dollar bills.

465
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,120
- That's some real money there.

466
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,364
Special occasion, birthday?

467
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,953
- [Briefcase] $11, please.

468
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:16,611
- Yeah, I heard you the first
time, now what do you want?

469
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:21,581
Man could have himself a
real party on $11, Rummie.

470
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,997
- No, I didn't come in for that,

471
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,999
you know, I gotta
do something else.

472
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,864
I just want 11
bills for my change.

473
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:31,419
- Look, this ain't
Bank of America,

474
00:22:31,557 --> 00:22:33,006
you gotta buy something.

475
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,699
- Look, I just need the
money, okay, please.

476
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:38,149
- How about this bottle of rum?

477
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:39,599
Ronrico, huh.

478
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:43,431
$15 marked down to 9.95.

479
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:44,604
I drink this stuff.

480
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:47,296
- [Briefcase] No, no.

481
00:22:47,435 --> 00:22:49,126
Here, I'll take this gum.

482
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:56,236
- I can tell you really
got something going there.

483
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,306
Sure that's $11.

484
00:22:57,445 --> 00:22:58,446
- Yeah, man, I'm sure, I'm sure.

485
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:02,450
- All right, one, two, three.

486
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:05,107
[horns honking]

487
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:11,390
- Oh, Lizbeth, Lizbeth.

488
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:14,669
[gasps] There you are. [laughs]

489
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:19,467
And here you are, from
the tooth fairy to you.

490
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:21,054
It's yours and then we're done.

491
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,746
- That's not the way
the tooth fairy does it.

492
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:25,024
- Look kid I gotta get a,

493
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:27,578
I got bigger things
to worry about.

494
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:30,167
- The tooth fairy puts
money under the pillow.

495
00:23:30,305 --> 00:23:31,824
- Well, that's the way the
tooth fairy used to do it,

496
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:33,342
but now we do all sorts
of different things,

497
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:35,344
like sometimes we wire the money

498
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:36,760
right into your bank account,

499
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:38,106
but since you don't
have a bank account,

500
00:23:38,244 --> 00:23:39,141
you don't have a
bank account do ya?

501
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,453
- No.

502
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:41,661
- No, well then we
do it like this.

503
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:44,353
Go on, take it.

504
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,770
- Yeah, but I didn't
even give you my tooth.

505
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,461
- Well, you can owe it to me.

506
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:51,188
- If you're the tooth fairy,

507
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:54,053
you put money under my
pillow where my tooth is.

508
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:56,193
- [groans] Nothing's
gonna be easy is it?

509
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:58,747
I suppose it's all my fault.

510
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,612
Another big joke at my expense.

511
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:06,168
Okay, okay, fine, we'll
do it the old way.

512
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:07,722
The old out of date,

513
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,207
the old I'll put it under
the pillow way, okay.

514
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,589
Fine, all right,
then you'll have

515
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:16,247
to believe in the tooth
fairy and Santa, and God

516
00:24:16,385 --> 00:24:18,767
and you'll have to have a
little faith then, right?

517
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:21,805
Okay then, just a little
bit of faith, okay?

518
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:23,151
Okay.
- Okay.

519
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:25,325
- It's settled,
where do you live?

520
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,257
- What?

521
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:27,155
- Where do you live?

522
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:28,225
- You don't know?

523
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:30,503
- Well I, I, you live here.

524
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:31,400
- [Lizbeth] Which apartment?

525
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:32,712
- Which apartment?

526
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,748
Well I, I've got
that written down

527
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:35,232
in my tooth fairy records.

528
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,716
You know, Lizbeth,
I can't be expected

529
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:39,581
to remember everything. [laughs]

530
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,549
- [Cyril] Is there
a problem here?

531
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:42,066
- Hey just buzz off..

532
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,486
Oh, no, no, no, no, no problem.

533
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:49,488
No problem at all.

534
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:52,076

[Muskat groaning]

539
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:51,929
- What happened?

540
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:52,999
- A flash flood,
now wake up,

541
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:54,760
I told you what I wanted
to do, do you remember?

542
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:56,624
I told you this afternoon.

543
00:25:56,762 --> 00:25:57,659
- Yeah, yeah I remember.

544
00:25:57,797 --> 00:25:58,764
You said,

545
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:03,734
oh no, no, no, are you crazy?

546
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:05,322
Briefcase!

547
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:07,635
Do you know what will happen

548
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:09,326
if the police catch you sneaking

549
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:11,328
into some little girl's window

550
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:13,123
to put money under her pillow?

551
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:15,884
- You make it sound sick.

552
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:19,819
- Oh boy, just go on and
give the girl the money.

553
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:21,925
It's a good thing
you're doing, Briefcase,

554
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:25,273
what does it matter if she
believes your hatchy matchy,

555
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:28,069
you hate it when the
preacher does that.

556
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,829
- Yeah, when he does it
that's totally different.

557
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,556
I mean, when he's
doing, he's trying,

558
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:34,247
you see what I'm
trying to do is...

559
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:37,354
Nevermind the freakin'
logic of the situation,

560
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:39,356
that little girl needs
to believe in stuff

561
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:41,323
like the tooth fairies
actually exist.

562
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:46,121
- Oh boy, you better
get home, let me sleep.

563
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:51,092
- [Briefcase] Don't make
me fill up this bottle.

564
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:51,989
- Okay, I'm up.

565
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:53,197
- [Briefcase] All right come on.

566
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:54,164
- I'm up.
- [Muskat] Get up.

567
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:55,061
- Shoes on.

568
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:58,893
- Come on!
- All right,

569
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:00,895
all right, all right.

570
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,482
- [Briefcase] Got it?

571
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,761
- [Muskat] Oh man you have
really let yourself go.

572
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:05,969
- Okay.
- I'm just saying,

573
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:08,178
maybe light beer from now on.

574
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:09,835
- [Briefcase] You're
buying the beer.

575
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:10,974
You wait for me here.

576
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:11,940
Wait.
- All right.

577
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:13,114
I'll wait, I'll wait.

578
00:27:14,943 --> 00:27:18,188
[dogs distant barking]

583
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:57,917

[door creaking]
[distant TV chattering]

589
00:29:54,654 --> 00:29:57,105
- He said wait, I'm gonna wait.

590
00:29:58,003 --> 00:30:00,522
He's my buddy so I'm gonna wait.

591
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,042
Wish I had a watch.

592
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,499
Okay, okay, okay.

593
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:15,572

[Briefcase groaning]

598
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,837
We gotta go, we gotta go.

599
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,323
- [Briefcase] You
got me, catch me.

600
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:45,119
[body thudding]

601
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:52,505
- [Muskat] No wait,
let's go, come on.

602
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,059
- [Briefcase] I thought
you were gonna catch me.

603
00:30:54,231 --> 00:30:56,855
- [Muskat] I thought
you was gonna wait.

604
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,067
- Wow.

605
00:31:03,482 --> 00:31:06,174
[both panting]

606
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:11,041
$11, I got more than Resa, yes.

607
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:17,082
[both laughing]

608
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,222
- Oh man, I would
have peed my pants

609
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,224
if I'd seen Cyril
standing there.

610
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:26,505
Ooh very scary. [laughs]

611
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:29,784
[wagon rattling]

612
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:32,200
- [Lizbeth] It's true, what
you said is really true.

613
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:33,753
- [laughs] Oh course it is.

614
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,272
- I can't wait to tell
all my friends and mommy.

615
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,136
- Well no, that's
not the best idea.

616
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:38,551
You know a better idea

617
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,312
would be to keep it
a secret, all right.

618
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,902
Especially from mommy and well,
whoever else she talks to.

619
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,662
- Why?

620
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,976
- Well, see we tooth fairies
we act like a secret club,

621
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:51,254
you know, and
without our secrets,

622
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:53,463
well, we couldn't do
our job half as well.

623
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:55,016
Because, you know, and
then all the people

624
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:57,639
would know are
aforementioned secrets.

625
00:31:57,777 --> 00:32:00,194
So, you think you can
keep all this a secret?

626
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:04,060
- Well yeah, I think so,
but I have to tell Resa,

627
00:32:04,198 --> 00:32:05,682
'cause she only got $10.

628
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,890
- [Briefcase] Well,
okay you can tell Resa,

629
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:07,995
but that's it, all right.

630
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:09,306
Now, look I wanna talk to you

631
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:10,859
about something
really important.

632
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:12,068
- I can't right now, I
gotta go home for dinner.

633
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:13,690
Mom gets mad if I'm late.

634
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:15,554
- [Briefcase] Yeah, but
it'll just take two seconds.

635
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:17,866
- [Lizbeth] Later, then I'll
show you my secret hideout.

636
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,697
- Ah yeah [sighs].

637
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:24,977
[sirens wailing]

638
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,914
Oh jeez, couldn't
your secret place

639
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:32,674
be a little easier to get to?

640
00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:34,607
- Well, then everyone
would be here.

641
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,713
- Yeah, well, yeah
I guess overcrowding

642
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:40,165
could ruin a place
like this. [groaning]

643
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:42,305
Hey, isn't kind of
late for you to be out,

644
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:43,616
especially on a school night.

645
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,308
- Yeah, but my
homework's all done.

646
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:47,068
- What about your mom,
won't she be worried?

647
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:49,036
- She's gonna be
at Cyril's tonight.

648
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,040
- Oh, you know,
speaking of Cyril.

649
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:54,524
I saw you yesterday doing,

650
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:57,665
doing what you might
call an errand for him.

651
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,187
- [Lizbeth] He gives me
money to run errands.

652
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:08,469
- You know, Lizbeth, those
errands aren't really good.

653
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:11,299
- I know but mommy
and I need the money.

654
00:33:11,437 --> 00:33:13,025
- Mommy and you need the money.

655
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:14,199
- [Lizbeth] Mm-hmm.

656
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:17,616
- Yeah, there it is. [laughs]

657
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:20,274
- Briefcase.
- Lizbeth, slow down.

658
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:22,172
I told you you shouldn't
be running like that.

659
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,933
- [laughing]
Especially in airports.

660
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:25,727
Ever.

661
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:30,077
- I have to tell my mommy about
you being the tooth fairy.

662
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:33,149
- Oh, no, no, no, no,

663
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:34,978
remember what we talked about?

664
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:36,462
Remember what I said?

665
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,085
It's best that mommy--
- And her boyfriends.

666
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:39,465
- That's right, they
don't know our...

667
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,295
- Yes, yes.
- My true identity, right?

668
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,675
We talked about this.

669
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,815
- I know but today
I was telling Gina,

670
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:46,265
that's Resa's friend,

671
00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:48,888
about you being the
tooth fairy and a wino

672
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,338
and they didn't believe me.

673
00:33:50,476 --> 00:33:52,030
- Oh he's gonna find out.

674
00:33:52,168 --> 00:33:53,962
He can't find out, you
know who I'm talking about.

675
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:55,619
He cannot find out.

676
00:33:57,173 --> 00:33:58,691
- Then what happened?

677
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,624
- And then I told them about
how I got into the system

678
00:34:00,762 --> 00:34:02,730
by putting money into
the tooth fairy fund,

679
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:04,490
but they didn't
believe that either.

680
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:06,182
- Well you know, Lizbeth,
some kids are like that,

681
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,115
you know I mean, well in
the tooth fairy business

682
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:09,426
we call those kids--
- Idiots.

683
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:11,049
- We call those
kids idiots, yeah.

684
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:13,292
You know, so what's
the problem, huh?

685
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,812
- Then when she said that
you were a dirty old wino,

686
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,919
and not the tooth fairy I hit
her, pow, right in the nose.

687
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,231
[Briefcase laughs]

688
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:22,888
- You did that for me?

689
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:25,994
- Yeah, but then she told
our teacher, Mr. Rady,

690
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,824
who told our
Principal Miss Blake,

691
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:30,275
and now I have to get my
mom to come to school.

692
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,277
- Oh, this is not good.

693
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:34,141
This isn't even related to good.

694
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,352
- Never been in
trouble before, never.

695
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,113
- I got it, I got it.

696
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:43,736
Just don't tell
your mom anything.

697
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,704
- Now Principal Blake
says I have to get my mom

698
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:48,016
to come tomorrow
at school at noon,

699
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:49,880
otherwise I'll be suspended.

700
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:52,435
- Well there you go, being
suspended is like, well,

701
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:54,816
it's like being on vacation.

702
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:56,508

What are you doing here?

882
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:57,505
- Charles Herschler,
ma'am, accountant.

883
00:42:57,644 --> 00:42:59,853
- For what, the
trees in the park?

884
00:42:59,991 --> 00:43:02,338
- Well, before I came
to your attention

885
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:06,756
as a bum, I was a
CPA for 13 years.

886
00:43:06,894 --> 00:43:08,240
- Look, I told--

887
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,863

that you're being asked

888
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:11,450
to pay money that you
don't think you owe.

889
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,073
- Elizabeth.

890
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:14,315
- [Briefcase] What, no,
no, no, it's not her fault.

891
00:43:14,453 --> 00:43:15,385

And why are you still here?

to you with this?

I kept putting it off

me feel stupid when I called.

- So why did you
quit accounting?

928
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:51,343
- I need to look at this.

929
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,932
You know, it seems
they sent you a bill

930
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,485
based on the interest income

931
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:58,834
and yeah, then they
charged you double for it.

932
00:45:00,007 --> 00:45:01,457
But you know, that's okay,

933
00:45:01,595 --> 00:45:03,321
as long as you paid the
original interest income,

934
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:04,943
we can just get a
statement from the bank.

935
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:06,634
- I mean I paid
it, it's just that

936
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:09,051

has gone out of business.

937
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:12,330

we'll just file a 604B

938
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:14,332
and a 5204 addendum
and I'll type up

939
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,403

explaining all that.

940

- And you know how
to do all of that?

941
00:45:18,474 --> 00:45:21,926
- Sure, there's a guy in my
building with a typewriter,

942
00:45:22,064 --> 00:45:23,582
so I'll work on it this weekend

943
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,688
and then on Monday I'll go
with you to the IRS office.

get her report card?

exceeds expectations?

wanted to take us camping.

And there's something
about Elizabeth.

questions all the time

00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:25,781
Now you guys sit down,
sit down, sit down,

1053
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,127
I'm gonna fix everything up,

1054
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:28,611
just sit down and
watch, here we go.

1055
00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:30,234
Oh yeah, look at this
we got warm blankets,

1056
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:32,926
warm blankets,
pillows and lemonade.

1057
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:35,342
Look at this, this is just food.

1058
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,723
Look at all that food,

1059
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:38,380
and I'm gonna put
the tent right here.

1060
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:41,900
And then I'm gonna,
well I forgot the rope.

1061
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,869
I can't, I can't put the
tent up without the rope.

1062
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:45,697
I've forgotten it.

1063
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:47,803
I've forgotten it all.

1064
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:49,701
- [Shari] Why don't we
help while you rest?

1065
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,325
- Yeah we wanna
try, let us, please.

1066
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:53,912
- Oh I should have
got a better tent.

1067
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,397
Maybe we should just go back.

1068
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:58,331
- No, we don't need a tent.

1069
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:00,747
We could sleep outside,
it won't hurt us.

1070
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:02,680
- Sure, why not, I
mean it's a nice night.

1071
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:04,302
We can just put the
tent out on the ground,

1072
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,064
and sleep on it that way
we don't have to worry

1073
00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:08,858
about the snakes and the bugs.

1074
00:51:08,996 --> 00:51:09,721
- Yeah.

1075
00:51:09,928 --> 00:51:10,998
- You really wanna stay?

1076
00:51:11,137 --> 00:51:12,345
- Mm-hmm.

1077
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:14,278
- Like you said, it
would be nice to get out

1078
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:16,142
of the city for a few days.

1079
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:18,351
- Okay, then.

1080
00:51:19,283 --> 00:51:21,043
Let's set up camp, we'll stay.

1081
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:22,976
- [Girls] Yes.

1082
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:24,840
- I need some help.

1083
00:51:24,978 --> 00:51:26,013
- Help up.
- Oh, gosh.

1084

- [Briefcase]
Having a good time?

1088
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:43,100
- [Shari] Yeah this is so nice.

1089
00:51:43,238 --> 00:51:44,618
- [laughs] You seem surprised.

1090
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,898
- [sighs] Maybe I'm
just not used to nice.

1091
00:51:49,036 --> 00:51:50,555
- Yeah, you can say that again.

1092
00:51:51,867 --> 00:51:53,731
I'm sorry, I'm not
talking about Cyril.

1093
00:51:56,043 --> 00:51:57,355
- Cyril is a big baby, okay.

1094
00:51:57,493 --> 00:51:59,219
Unless you owe him money,

1095
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:01,463
you have nothing to worry about.

1096
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:02,843
- How can you allow him

1097
00:52:02,981 --> 00:52:04,845
to be in the same
house as Elizabeth?

1098
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:07,331
- When I was young
I did some things

1099
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:09,195
that I'm not proud of.

1100
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,920
But then I had Mary Elizabeth

1101
00:52:11,058 --> 00:52:12,819
and I turned myself around.

1102
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:17,375
I mean, I went back to junior
college and I got a job.

1103
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:20,516
Cyril helped me out then.

1104
00:52:20,654 --> 00:52:21,517
I owe him.

1105
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:24,693
But he knows about my past

1106
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:26,281
and he threatens to
tell Mary Elizabeth

1107
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:28,386
every single time that
he gets mad at me.

1108
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:29,767
But only when he's mad.

1109
00:52:29,905 --> 00:52:32,942
- He uses Lizbeth
to make drug runs.

1110
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,187
- Look, I try my best.

1111
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:38,431
Do you want me to say it?

1112
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:40,605
I'm a bad person, okay.

1113
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:41,986
I'm a bad mom.

1114
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:43,298
- I'm not saying that.

1115
00:52:43,436 --> 00:52:45,783
Honest, I mean no
one has a right

1116
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:47,509
to tell somebody how
to run their life,

1117
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:51,858
it's me, I mean, what
am I, I'm a drunk

1118
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:56,725
who pretends to be the
tooth fairy. [laughs]

1119
00:52:56,863 --> 00:52:58,761
I'm not trying to make
you feel bad, Shari.

1120
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:02,800
Heck, I'm just thankful
to know you and Lizbeth.

1121
00:53:04,595 --> 00:53:06,044

1122
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,081
come help me find some crickets.

1123
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:12,534
- [chuckles] Should, you wanna
go get some crickets with us?

1124
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:13,914
- No, nah, I'm exhausted.

1125
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:16,710
I'm gonna have
another marshmallow.

shifty looking kid.

1131
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:35,384
- He was all I could find.

1132
00:53:35,522 --> 00:53:36,903
By the way do--

1133
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:39,354
- No one has seen him,
or Shari or Lizbeth.

1134
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,980
This isn't gonna turn out well.

1135
00:53:45,118 --> 00:53:47,948
- Positive attitude,
positive result, so shut up.

1136
00:53:48,673 --> 00:53:51,538
Be cool, be cool.

1137
00:53:51,676 --> 00:53:54,231
Jeez, who just ratted on me?

1138
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:55,749
Who?

1139
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:57,406
- Oh, come on now.

1140
00:53:57,544 --> 00:53:59,339
- There's a million
kids out on the streets,

1141
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:01,134
why are the cops picking on me?

we made it. [laughs]

- Yeah.

1147
00:54:18,772 --> 00:54:20,740
- I was wrong
about you, Charles.

1148
00:54:20,878 --> 00:54:22,051
I'm sorry.

1149
00:54:22,189 --> 00:54:22,845
- That's okay.

1150
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:26,021
- So, what are you
doing after this?

1151
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:29,611
- Well, I gotta get the
truck back like I promised.

1152
00:54:29,749 --> 00:54:31,682
You know, do the
responsible thing.

1153
00:54:32,993 --> 00:54:34,547
And then I guess
I'll just go home.

1154
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:41,105
Hm, home, haven't said that
to anybody in a long time.

1155
00:54:41,726 --> 00:54:43,072
Sounds pretty good.

1156
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,041
- I meant what are
you doing after this.

1157
00:54:49,734 --> 00:54:51,460
- I'm just taking it
one day at a time.

1158
00:54:51,598 --> 00:54:52,737
That's all I can do.

1159
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:56,776
- If anybody deserves a second
chance, Charles, it's you.

1160
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:03,610
- Jeez, here.

1161
00:55:04,749 --> 00:55:07,856
- Hey kiddo. [groans]

1162
00:55:07,994 --> 00:55:09,996
So, would you like to
come in for some coffee?

1163
00:55:10,134 --> 00:55:13,931
- No, you know, I better
get going, ya know.

1164
00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:15,760
Matter of fact it's
probably a good idea

1165
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:17,417
if I don't show up around
here for a couple of weeks.

1166
00:55:17,555 --> 00:55:19,108
- How was camping?

1167
00:55:21,214 --> 00:55:24,044
- Listen, Cyril. [groans]

1168
00:55:24,182 --> 00:55:25,770
- Don't speak out
of turn, Briefcase.

1169
00:55:25,908 --> 00:55:26,530
It's rude.

1170
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:28,670
You are a piece of work.

1171
00:55:28,808 --> 00:55:29,774
There are drunks out there

1172
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:31,258
but you're the whole package.

1173
00:55:31,397 --> 00:55:33,399
And the name, that's great too.

1174
00:55:33,537 --> 00:55:34,676
- I'm glad you approve.

1175
00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:38,680
- It all stopped when you
started costing me money.

1176
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:40,095
- [Shari] Cyril, stop it.

1177
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:41,441
- Will you shut up,

1178
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:42,408
you wanna wake up
your little girl?

1179
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,101
This is gonna be a
lesson, Briefcase,

1180
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:48,206
that you will never forget.

1181
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:52,452
- I can make it so the cops
never bust you guys again.

1182
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,143
- [Cyril] What are
you talking about?

1183
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:58,631
- All those winos out there,
they're not all winos.

1184
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:01,772
Some of them are
undercover cops.

1185
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:04,568
And they've been watching you.

1186
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:08,088
I mean, you probably can't
tell the difference, but I can.

1187
00:56:09,227 --> 00:56:10,919
- And I suppose
you don't want me

1188
00:56:11,057 --> 00:56:12,852
to use Lizbeth to
make deliveries?

1189
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:15,406
- I can take her place.

1190
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:20,860
So I have a weak spot, shoot me.

1191
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:26,797

- On a scale of one to 10,
this is the stupidest--

1195
00:56:46,748 --> 00:56:47,749
- Sh, watch.

1196
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:56,551
- Are you gonna trust that fool?

1197
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:59,692
- Of course not, but I'm
gonna use him though.

1198
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:14,189
Perfect.

1199
00:57:23,405 --> 00:57:24,613
- What's the matter with you,

1200
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:26,235
thought you said
you wanted a drink?

1201
00:57:29,273 --> 00:57:31,137
- Taken all the fun
out of it for me.

1202
00:57:32,276 --> 00:57:34,416
- Taken all the fun
out of it for me.

1203
00:57:34,554 --> 00:57:35,590
- You know Briefcase,

1204
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:39,801
you were kinda impressing
me for a while, you know.

1205
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,321
Cleaning yourself up,
getting that place and all.

1206
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,255
What happened to your
job at the grocery store?

1207
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:47,049
- Fired.

1208
00:57:48,775 --> 00:57:50,467
It was idiot work anyway.

1209
00:57:50,605 --> 00:57:52,641
- Yeah, but you was doing it.

1210
00:57:52,779 --> 00:57:55,748
- I was throwing rotten
produce in the garbage.

1211
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:57,681
Big bucks, look
out Donald Trump.

1212
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:05,309
- Talked to Lizbeth yesterday.

1213
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:08,519
- She didn't lose
another tooth, did she?

1214
00:58:09,762 --> 00:58:11,936
Boy, that come back and
bite me in the butt.

1215
00:58:13,697 --> 00:58:15,043
- She misses you, Briefcase.

1216
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:18,287
- She'll get over it.

1217
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:19,737
Kids they bounce back.

1218
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:23,741
- Briefcase, what the
is the matter with you?

1219
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:26,261
You were almost there.

1220
00:58:26,399 --> 00:58:30,023
I mean, yeah you still
drank, but not like before.

1221
00:58:30,161 --> 00:58:31,197
Not like now.

1222
00:58:32,647 --> 00:58:34,856
Why you wanna throw it all away?

1223
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:36,892
- I decided I was
too old for change.

1224
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,310
Maybe I didn't wanna change,
you ever think about that?

1225
00:58:42,657 --> 00:58:46,695
You, you just remember,
no more tips to the cops.

1226
00:58:48,386 --> 00:58:51,010
Or Cyril and his goons are
gonna pound on me again.

1227
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:55,739
- You gonna end up
in jail or dead.

1228
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:56,602
Is that what you want?

1229
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,327
- Who cares?

1230
00:58:58,465 --> 00:59:00,537
- [Muskat] Cyril ain't
worth this man, he ain't.

1231
00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:07,578
Yeah.

1232
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:13,170
[door thudding]
[Briefcase yelling]

1233
00:59:13,308 --> 00:59:14,723
- Is that any way to
greet your guests?

1234
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:16,035
- What do you want?

1235
00:59:16,173 --> 00:59:17,001
- What a dump.

1236
00:59:17,899 --> 00:59:19,797
- With a capital D.

1237
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,350
- [Cyril] You been
crying, Briefcase?

1238
00:59:21,488 --> 00:59:22,144
- No.

1239
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:24,906
- I can be real sympathetic
when I need to be.

1240
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:27,184
Makes people work harder for me.

1241
00:59:27,322 --> 00:59:28,772
That's what it says in
the books I read anyway.

1242
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,774
- Get to the point, Cyril.

1243
00:59:30,912 --> 00:59:32,741
Just tell me when and where.

1244
00:59:32,879 --> 00:59:34,294
- You see, all business.

1245
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:38,367
All right, tomorrow
you pick up from me

1246
00:59:39,506 --> 00:59:42,786
but you drop off to
707 Placer Street,

1247
00:59:42,924 --> 00:59:44,201
entrance in the alley.

1248
00:59:45,478 --> 00:59:46,928
- That's not the usual way.

1249
00:59:47,066 --> 00:59:48,861
[body thudding]
[Briefcase groaning]

1250
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:51,657
- Don't you worry about
what's usual and what isn't.

1251
00:59:53,072 --> 00:59:56,247
[chuckles] I just want to
spice things up for you.

1252
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:58,698
Wouldn't want you
to get in a rut.

1253
00:59:58,836 --> 00:59:59,975
- You're too good to me.

1254
01:00:00,113 --> 01:00:02,944
[blow thuds]
[Briefcase groaning]

1255
01:00:03,082 --> 01:00:05,325
- [Cyril] And after the
delivery you come back

1256
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:06,741
to my place with the package,

1257
01:00:06,879 --> 01:00:10,814
and I'll give you a
$100 bonus, old man.

1258
01:00:15,508 --> 01:00:18,787
[suspenseful music]

1259
01:00:18,925 --> 01:00:21,963
[mysterious music]

1260
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:33,526
[brakes screeching]

1261
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:36,633
[Briefcase gasping]

1262
01:00:42,535 --> 01:00:45,124
[door squeaking]

1263
01:00:48,714 --> 01:00:49,680
[door thudding]

1264
01:00:49,818 --> 01:00:50,785
- Oh.

1265
01:00:51,786 --> 01:00:52,752
Hi.

1266
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,893
You know even the stuff
they use on television

1267
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,274
wouldn't work on this.

1268
01:00:58,482 --> 01:01:00,242
You would think that
cleanliness is easier

1269
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,935
than godliness, but not when
you're dealing with this junk.

1270
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,698
- I couldn't think of
anyplace else to go.

1271
01:01:07,836 --> 01:01:09,424
So I came here.

1272
01:01:09,562 --> 01:01:12,013
- Oh well listen, I'll leave
and let you pray in peace.

1273
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:17,156
- Oh no, no, actually, actually
I was hoping to talk to you.

1274
01:01:18,398 --> 01:01:20,021
You being the only
clergy I know.

1275
01:01:20,262 --> 01:01:22,679
- Whoa now this is beginning
to sound like a lost sheep.

1276
01:01:22,817 --> 01:01:24,750
Here, sit down, take a load off.

1277
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:33,828
- I've been blaming God

1278
01:01:33,966 --> 01:01:36,037
for the bad things that
have happened in my life

1279
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:37,279
and I've hated Him.

1280
01:01:39,316 --> 01:01:40,489
And now--

1281
01:01:40,627 --> 01:01:41,490
- And now you need His help?

1282
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:44,528
- I was hoping He
could do me a favor.

1283
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:46,116
Maybe help me do something

1284
01:01:46,254 --> 01:01:48,325
that I don't have the
strength to do it by myself.

1285
01:01:48,463 --> 01:01:50,776
- You know what I've
discovered, Briefcase?

1286
01:01:50,914 --> 01:01:52,053
God is not a slot machine.

1287
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:53,468
You don't just put a quarter in

1288
01:01:53,606 --> 01:01:55,573
and hope for lucky
sevens to come out.

1289
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,230
- I know that Preacher, I,

1290
01:01:57,368 --> 01:01:58,749
[gentle music]

1291
01:01:58,887 --> 01:02:00,130
I guess what I'm asking is,

1292
01:02:01,027 --> 01:02:02,166
do you think maybe,

1293
01:02:03,616 --> 01:02:08,172
maybe a guy like me could
get a second chance?

1294
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:13,522
- I was a doctor once,
Briefcase, believe it or not.

1295
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:14,661
- So that's why the clinic.

1296
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,387
- Yep.

1297
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:19,356
I performed miracles, I
brought people back to life.

1298
01:02:19,494 --> 01:02:21,703
These people for
any reason, science,

1299
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:23,084
they should have been dead.

1300
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:26,225
But I didn't think that
I was God's vessel.

1301
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:28,952
I thought I was God.

1302
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:29,815
What a prideful I was.

1303
01:02:31,023 --> 01:02:32,645
Anyway, my ego made me think

1304
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:35,924
that I was not addicted to
these drugs that I prescribed.

1305
01:02:36,062 --> 01:02:37,926
It would be a problem
for a lessor person,

1306
01:02:38,064 --> 01:02:39,445
but not for me, not for God.

1307
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:43,552
Anyway that attitude
killed somebody.

1308
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:47,039
They made me stop
doing what I loved

1309
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:48,972
more than anything else forever.

1310
01:02:51,008 --> 01:02:53,252
I was out on the
streets too, Briefcase.

1311
01:02:55,495 --> 01:02:59,534
But then one day,
I heard Him call.

1312
01:03:00,915 --> 01:03:01,985
He forgave me.

1313
01:03:03,745 --> 01:03:05,574
What do you say, Charles?

1314
01:03:05,712 --> 01:03:06,852
Do you wanna be forgiven?

1315
01:03:09,716 --> 01:03:11,995
- You haven't lost your
touch there, Preacher.

1316
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,414
[gentle music]

1317
01:03:27,873 --> 01:03:31,428
Hey you, you know there's no
loitering round these parts.

1318
01:03:31,566 --> 01:03:36,398
- Hey, hey, hey, look who
it is, hey, Briefcase.

1319
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,575
- You drinking water?

1320
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:44,544
- Oh well you know, thought
I'd, time for a little change.

1321
01:03:45,269 --> 01:03:46,892
Enjoy the day for a while.

1322
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,102
- [Briefcase] But paying
for bottled water?

1323
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,104
- Oh get real, I found
this bottle a week ago,

1324
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:54,347
been refilling it ever since.

1325
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:57,247
[both chuckling]

1326
01:03:58,213 --> 01:03:59,352
- So how you been doing?

1327
01:04:01,078 --> 01:04:02,183
- Saved up $48,

1328
01:04:03,805 --> 01:04:05,980
thought I might get me a
place when I get enough.

1329
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:06,912
- Slow going though, huh?

1330
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,051
- You know it is.

1331
01:04:08,948 --> 01:04:10,467
Tough keeping money saved.

1332
01:04:10,605 --> 01:04:13,159
- Unless you have a
whole bunch of it.

1333
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:15,161
- Well that would be
a different story.

1334
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:18,544
But the lottery, that
like a tax for the stupid.

1335
01:04:18,682 --> 01:04:23,480
- No, no, no, you'd
have a sure thing.

1336
01:04:24,619 --> 01:04:26,552
- Oh, a sure thing
sure would be nice.

1337
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:32,834
What exactly are we talking
about here, Briefcase?

1338
01:04:32,972 --> 01:04:36,907
- Oh, just talking about
getting out of this city,

1339
01:04:37,045 --> 01:04:38,046
you know, both of us.

1340
01:04:38,184 --> 01:04:38,633
- Me and you?
- Mm-hmm.

1341
01:04:40,186 --> 01:04:41,498
- Mm, by ripping off Cyril?

1342
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:46,917
No, no, no, no, my momma didn't
raise no fool, he'd kill us.

1343
01:04:47,055 --> 01:04:48,436
- Don't you think I know that?

1344
01:04:49,747 --> 01:04:53,648
Look, I gotta make a
pick up this evening

1345
01:04:53,786 --> 01:04:56,099
and well all the signs
are pointing to it being,

1346
01:04:57,755 --> 01:04:58,584
being really big.

1347
01:04:58,825 --> 01:04:59,930
- What's so big about both of us

1348
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:01,449
getting a bullet in our head?

1349
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:03,969
- Well there are risks involved,
there always is Muskat.

1350
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:07,973
Look, all right if you don't
wanna help me with this,

1351
01:05:08,111 --> 01:05:10,527
that's fine, you know, I
mean I'll respect that.

1352
01:05:12,978 --> 01:05:14,496
Can you honestly tell me

1353
01:05:14,634 --> 01:05:16,533
that anything is gonna change
with $48 in your pocket?

1354
01:05:18,362 --> 01:05:21,779
And if everything goes
the way I think it should,

1355
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,990
Cyril won't even know what
we did until we're all gone.

1356
01:05:25,128 --> 01:05:27,199
You, me, Elizabeth
and her mother.

1357
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:28,786
- You got them helping?

1358
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,098
- No, no, no, no.

1359
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:31,548
I don't want them
involved at all.

1360
01:05:31,686 --> 01:05:32,756
I don't want them to
know anything about it

1361
01:05:32,894 --> 01:05:33,515
unless it all goes right.

1362
01:05:34,689 --> 01:05:37,934
We're talking about
40 or $50,000 here.

1363
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:39,970
- How do you know that?

1364
01:05:40,108 --> 01:05:41,144
- I just do.

1365
01:05:42,662 --> 01:05:44,733
I'll call it all off
if it goes wrong,

1366
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:47,564
but I can't do this alone.

1367
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:50,877
I need you on that phone.

1368
01:05:51,016 --> 01:05:52,431
I need you watching Cyril

1369
01:05:52,569 --> 01:05:54,674
and I need you to get
Elizabeth and her mom away

1370
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:56,711
if everything goes smooth.

1371
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:58,747
- What if it don't go right?

1372
01:05:58,885 --> 01:05:59,576
- I don't know.

1373
01:06:02,682 --> 01:06:05,340
Muskat, it's like
someone just told me.

1374
01:06:08,412 --> 01:06:10,138
You just gotta have faith.

1375
01:06:10,276 --> 01:06:13,038
[gentle music]

1376
01:06:13,176 --> 01:06:14,280
- Okay.

1377
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:15,488
- Okay?
- Okay, I'm in.

1378
01:06:15,626 --> 01:06:17,180
- You're in?

1379
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:19,216
Yeah, yeah.
[both laughing]

1380
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:24,325
- Yeah.
[both grunting]

1381
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:26,120
- [Salesman] It's almost new.

1382
01:06:26,258 --> 01:06:28,881
- Hi, how much is this?

1383
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:32,298
- That ones, well I can let you
have that one for about $15.

1384
01:06:32,436 --> 01:06:33,713
- $10.

1385
01:06:33,851 --> 01:06:34,783
- You've gotta be joking, $10.

1386
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:36,509
- Come on, $10.

1387
01:06:36,647 --> 01:06:38,270
- Like 12, 12, 12.

1388
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:39,202
- 10 bucks, 10 bucks.

1389
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,134
- Okay, okay, okay.

1390
01:06:55,908 --> 01:06:59,360
- What are you doing, leave
the phone alone, go, go, go.

1391
01:07:00,085 --> 01:07:01,086
Jeez.

1392
