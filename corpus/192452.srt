talk with you about Stafford.

480
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,759
<i>Stafford?</i>
<i>Who's Stafford?</i>

481
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:45,700
Oh, this boy I met at camp.
I just wanted your advice
on something.

482
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,863
Yes? On what?

483
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,907
Well, uh...

484
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:55,674
I wanted you to tell me
how long you waited
before you got married.

485
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,750
Sharon.

486
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,355
- Oh, Lockness.
<i>- Yes</i>, <i>Miss Margaret?</i>

487
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,959
Please tell my mother that I
won't be able to meet her, and
cancel all of my appointments.

488
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:21,493
- Cancel them?
- Yes. Something very
important has come up.

489
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,665
Yes, Miss Margaret.

490
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:32,415
Sharon, what
I'm trying to say is that
the decision to marry...

491
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,919
is something best considered
after you've lived
a little bit longer.

492
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:40,481
Mother, you're perfectly right.
Stafford was much
too juvenile for me.

493
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,118
Well, thank goodness
for that.

494
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:48,188
- To be perfectly frank with you,
the old zing just wasn't there.
- Zing?

495
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:53,465
You know, the charge that shoots
up your spine when you meet
the one man you wanna marry.

496
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:57,007
Like when you met Daddy.

497
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,475
[ Sighs ]
What was Daddy like?

498
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:05,845
Well... I don't know how
we got around to him.

499
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,908
Is it terribly painful for you
to talk about Daddy?

500
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,648
No. Why should it be?

501
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,747
I don't know.

502
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:18,158
Well, I thought, maybe
when you've been in love
with somebody once,

503
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:23,064
well, the recollection
and memory might be bitter--
bitterly painful.

504
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,161
Oh, Sharon, that was
many, many years ago.
Don't dramatize it.

505
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,206
Where did he take you
on your very first date?

506
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,334
He-- He took me to dinner.

507
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:37,210
It was an Italian restaurant.
One of those down in those
old basements in New York.

508
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,681
It was called Mar--
Martinelli's.

509
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,150

<i>- Yes,</i>

510

511
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,050
- You said there was music.
- Uh-huh.

512
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,321
- What song did they play?
- Song?

513
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:55,923
Oh, there must've been a song.
You know, the old ''They're
playing our song'' type of thing.

514
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,867
Oh. Well, if there was,
I wouldn't remember it.

515

think of me as being
just your father.
