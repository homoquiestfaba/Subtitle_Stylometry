1
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:45,045
Well, this was supposed
to be a surprise.

2
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,986
- It is.
- Yeah. For me.

3
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:51,060
- I thought you were sound asleep.
- You must be feeling guilty.

4
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,200
Thank you so much.

5
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:55,794
Happy birthday, Abby.

6
00:02:57,273 --> 00:03:01,232
- Mmm.
- Mmm. We are being watched.

7
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,638
Aww, sweetheart.

8
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,841
- Did we wake you up?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,765
- We did? I'm sorry.
- Red bunny.

10
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:10,033
- I'm sorry, baby.
- Sorry, girls. What can I say?

11
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,654
Come here, little girl. Ah.

12
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,277
- Ok. Group hug.
- Mmm. Group hug.

13
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:17,453
Mmm.

14
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,700
Back to bed.

15
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,731
- Aw, baby. Did I wake you?
- Come on, you guys, to bed.

16
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:32,615
Ahh!

17
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,274
Somebody.

18
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,566
- Hi.
- Hello, birthday girl.

19
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,844
- How are you?
- I'm well.

20
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,789
- Are we still 29?
- And a half.

21
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:53,021
- Ooh, let me see. Let me see.
- Look what he got me.

22
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:56,095
- Can you stand it?
- Oh, my God. You make me sick.

23
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:57,475
Ooh, you know what?
I brought something, too.

24
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,875
- Thank you.
- Yes, indeed. It's your birthday.

25
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,941
Yeah. It could be with that bracelet.

26
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,596
Bye, Sophie.

27
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:09,950
Just kidding.

28
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,893
Ahh!

29
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:14,649
Patriotic man.

30
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,574
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a little pregnant.

31
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,972
- looks like your ex-boyfriend.
- Yeah, it does.

32
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:21,591
Oh, look at this, babe.
look what she got for me.

33
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,352
Mmm. Nice touch.

34
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,202
Now...Iadies,

35
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:29,169
make sure you have that
girls' day out tomorrow, OK?

36
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:31,795
- Just leave the platinum card, Neil.
- I will.

37
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:34,004
You know, I think your sitter
is gonna have a hell of a long day.

38
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,015
- Yeah, we're gonna go wild.
- Yeah!

39
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:38,128
- Well, then. Gotta go.
- Bye.

40
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:40,720
- See you tonight.
- OK.

41
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:43,441
- Diane, I will see you later.
- See you, Neil.

42
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,969
You know, you have
the greatest husband ever.

43
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:51,280
I think you might be right.

44
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,331
Aw, you're beautiful.

45
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,505
You really, you really, really are.

46
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,595
- Big launch on Monday, huh?
- Yeah. Big launch.

47
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:28,904
2 years.
2 years I spent trying to get that--

48
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,222
(Indistinct) account.

49
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:33,705
I just about bust my jaw
smiling at those shitheads.

50
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:37,159
Then, the old man gives it to you
and it gets done overnight.

51
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,679
- What is your secret, Neil? Tell me.
- OK. Tell you what I'm gonna do.

52
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:44,994
Today, 4 P.M., we got the Ronsin pitch.

53
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,979
I will hang back...

54
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,842
and leave it all to you.

55
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:50,501
How's that sound?

56
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,888
I'm not so hot on electrical appliances.
So what do you say?

57
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,832
Does--does Abby know
that you're not perfect?

58
00:06:56,873 --> 00:07:00,766
- I won't go that far.
- You're gonna go far, all right.

59
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:31,390
- I think you'd derail this account.
- The TV spots--it's nationwide.

60
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,869
- I think you'd derail this account.
- The TV spots--it's nationwide.

61
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:39,217
The awareness on this thing--People
are going crazy for it. I'm telling you.

62
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,553
- It's gonna destroy our competition.
- Sad bastards.

63
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:46,356
Anyway, Neil, it's outstanding work.
It's really terrific.

64
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:49,359
- These--(Indistinct) trails are genius.
- Thanks.

65
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,643
Those boys in the white room at Magris

66
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,140
are gonna piss themselves
they never got it.

67
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:57,360
- No chance of a spoiler, right?
- No. Not at all.

68
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:01,904
Good. OK.

69
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,255
You're not gonna need me this afternoon,
so I'll see you all at 5.

70
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,786
That's nice.

71
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:10,247
Oh, uh, Karl.

72
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,255
About that Ronsin pitch.

73
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:14,724
Yeah? What about it?

74
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:18,563
Well, I was just thinking
it might be better if, uh,

75
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:20,329
maybe just one of us dealt with it.

76
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:23,681
You know, they're not really the kind
to go for that hard sell.

77
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:26,724
OK. Well, which one of you wants to do it?

78
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:29,480
You know. I'm easy. I don't know.
Jerry, what do you say? You wanna do it?

79
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:31,401
Yeah. I do. Absolutely.

80
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,686
No. You do it, Neil.

81
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,469
You don't sit on the bench
when you're batting a thousand.

82
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:41,121
Wow. Well...if you're sure.

83
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:43,807
I don't know. Is that OK with you, Jerry?

84
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:47,675
- But we did the heavy lifting on that.
- No. It's fine.

85
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:50,334
Good. Ah.

86
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:52,542
Just keep passing every test.

87
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,488
Big plans for you, Neil.

88
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,733
Big plans. You have a second?

89
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:12,506
- Neil Randall's office.
- Hey, Judy. It's Abby.

90
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,019
- Hi, Mrs. Randall. Happy birthday.
- Thank you so much.

91
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,164
Is Neil around?

92
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:21,845
Uh, he's just finishing up with Karl.
Do you want to hold?

93
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:24,433
Ah-ha! They're planning their little weekend
adventure, are they?

94
00:09:24,472 --> 00:09:26,032
Something like that.

95
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,959
Listen, do you think he'll want to keep him
late again tonight or what?

96
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:29,398
Uh, no. I don't think so.

97
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,285
Good. 'Cause I got
something special planned.

98
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:32,943
Listen, Judy.
Can I ask you something?

99
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:34,061
- Mm-hmm.
- Between you and me,

100
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:35,475
do you think this means a promotion?

101
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,323
Well, let's just say it's looking good.

102
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:41,420
Oh!

103
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,240
You did it again, Neil.

104
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:46,248
Hey, what can I say?

105
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:50,030
You just gotta raise your game.
That's all. Be on him more.

106
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:52,202
Come on. It's nothing personal.
You know that.

107
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:55,822
- But that's what it takes, right?
- I don't know. Does it?

108
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,415
- But that's what it takes, right?
- I don't know. Does it?

109
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:59,819
I feel bad for him,
but what am I supposed to do?

110
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:02,754
- All right, all right.
- So how was your day?

111
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:04,005
- Eh.
- Yeah?

112
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:05,799
Hmm.

113
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:08,321
Well, that was fantastic.

114
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,996
Tastes even better since I quit the smokes.

115
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:15,104
Mmm.

116
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:17,763
Our song.

117
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:20,219
# Here's what I'll do #

118
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:23,458
# I'll take care of you #

119
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:24,954
What are you thinking?

120
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:28,476
# I love and lost #

121
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:32,984
# The same as you #

122
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:34,618
Oh, you devil.

123
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:37,504
# So you see, I know #

124
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,285
# Just what
you've been through #

125
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,279
# So if you let me #

126
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:47,513
# Here's what I'll do #

127
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:52,184
# Oh, I'll take care of you #

128
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,739
What if I asked you to stay this weekend?

129
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:01,589
Abby, you know I want to.

130
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:03,958
Stop. I was just kidding.

131
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:05,747
Just kidding.

132
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,473
I know how much this means to you.

133
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,054
I mean, how often does he invite
an executive to his country estate?

134
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:15,564
- No. Important for both of us, honey.
- For both of us.

135
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:19,912
# Dry your weeping eyes #

136
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:24,328
# Oh, darling, tell me #

137
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:26,953
Sophie. Sophie. Give me.
Sophie. Sophie!

138
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:29,260
- You ready?
- I'm packed.

139
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:30,723
I love that one, honey.

140
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:36,067
- I'm not trying to seduce him, babe.
- Well, it will remind you of me.

141
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:38,083
It might bring you luck.

142
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:39,072
- I got it.
- That's almost sweet.

143
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,765
We'd better get going if you want
to get to Diane's in time.

144
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:43,999
- Hello.
- Hello.

145
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:47,456
- I'm Helen Schriver. The agency sent me.
- Come in.

146
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:50,431
- I'm a little early.
- It's OK. This is my husband Neil.

147
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:52,927
- Hey, Helen.
- Hello.

148
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:56,195
Oh, look at you. You must be Sophie.

149
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,979
This is Helen, the lady that I told you about
that's gonna sit for you tonight.

150
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:01,249
- Hey.
- Who's that?

151
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,772
Her name's Sherry. We're playing a game.

152
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:05,851
- Could I play, too?
- OK.

153
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,118
Why don't you go show Helen
the swimming pool you built for Sherry?

154
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:10,615
Thanks.

155
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:18,007
Oh, that's a really cool swimming pool.

156
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,828
Do you want to put
a diving board on the end of it?

157
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:23,708
- What? What's wrong?
- She seems a bit old, don't you think?

158
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:25,682
I thought the agency
would send someone younger.

159
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:28,179
Oh, yeah. That's right.
Someone who could spend all night

160
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:31,033
on the phone with her boyfriend
while the house burns down.

161
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,343
Fine.

162
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,392
Ouch.

163
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:36,848
Oh, babe. Could you get my black Prada
pressed while I'm gone?

164
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,776
It'll make my whole weekend, honey.

165
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:41,971
This is Rabbit.
We watch TV together.

166
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:44,144
I love you, sweetie.
I'll see you tonight, OK?

167
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:45,425
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, honey.

168
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:47,022
Here you go, baby.

169
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,962
Daddy's gonna miss you. Bye-bye.

170
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,225
- Don't tell Mom.
- OK.

171
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,502
Shh.

172
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:57,512
Mwah!

173
00:12:57,554 --> 00:13:01,197
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye. Oh, Helen...

174
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:05,028
If my wife gets back before midnight,
do not let her in.

175
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:07,438
She's under strict instructions
to have a good time.

176
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,633
- OK.
- Baby, did I pack my razors?

177
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:13,035
No, you didn't. I did.

178
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:14,977
What would I do without you, huh?

179
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:19,810
- Bye, baby.
- Miss you.

180
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,304
I love you.

181
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:38,465
I'll be there in 20, Diane. OK?

182
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:40,668
Neil's got a promotion to get, remember?

183
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:42,591
OK. Bye.

184
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:44,827
Baby, let's not get
carried away with this, ok?

185
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:48,855
I mean, we don't know if he's gonna offer
me a partnership. We just don't.

186
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,780
I mean, he may just want
to bond, talk business.

187
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,682
That's if I can even find this place.
It's in the middle of nowhere.

188
00:13:56,956 --> 00:14:02,453
- OK. What's on your mind?
- Just thinking about how far we've come.

189
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,528
Yeah, we have.

190
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,608
Didn't I promise you it'd be worth it?

191
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:08,982
Come on. We were leading
separate lives in Denver.

192
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,535
Now, look at us.

193
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,297
You know what I'm also thinking?

194
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,188
I'm gonna start calling around
to some of the agencies.

195
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,983
- No. What, get back into photography?
- Yes. Just locally.

196
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,874
I mean, I think my days of cruising
the freeways are long gone.

197
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:27,117
Yeah. Why don't you go for it?

198
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:31,429
- You don't mind?
- Mind? I think it's a great idea.

199
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,551
Me, too.

200
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,249
Oh, my God!

201
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,967
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get your hands on the wheel!

202
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,695
Keep your hands on the goddamn wheel!

203
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:44,454
- What do you want?
- Huh?

204
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:49,193
- What do you want?
- I've got what I want. Right here.

205
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,113
- What do you mean?
- Nice and easy.

206
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:53,414
- Please, don't do anything stupid, OK?
- Nice and easy. Nice and steady.

207
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:57,440
- OK, I'm steady. I'm steady.
- (Indistinct)

208
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,129
Here you go. It's for you.

209
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,410
Take it. Take it.

210
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,059
It's Sophie.

211
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,659
- Oh, Christ, no!
- Don't you--

212
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,389
- Don't you want to talk?
- What are you--

213
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:14,741
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

214
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,062
Please, don't!

215
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:17,373
- Talk. Talk!
- OK!

216
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:20,061
Talk.

217
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,910
Sophie--Hi, sweetheart.
It's Mommy.

218
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:26,356
Listen to me. It's just a game.
It's just a game, baby, OK?

219
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:29,299
Listen, do whatever
the lady says. All right?

220
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:31,674
That's a good--yeah.
Daddy's right here.

221
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,944
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough. That's enough.

222
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:36,018
- Give it to me.
- No! Let me speak to my daughter!

223
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,619
That's enough! That's enough!

224
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:52,972
God.

225
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,707
I swear to God,
if you hurt our daughter--

226
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,535
I don't give a shit about your daughter.

227
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:05,352
- How much do you want?
- How much you got?

228
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,213
90, 95 grand. I don't know exactly.

229
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:15,174
$142,367.

230
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:19,684
Exactly.

231
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,790
Just you.

232
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:48,735
Wait. Any withdrawal over 20 grand
needs my signature, too.

233
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:58,740
Fine. Fine.

234
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,279
Just remember why we're here.

235
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:13,526
I make one phone call to my lady friend,
and you'll never see your daughter again.

236
00:17:13,562 --> 00:17:16,179
Keep an eye on him, Abby.

237
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:17,678
Run along now.

238
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,517
- You OK?
- No, I'm good.

239
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,437
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.

240
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:27,316
- You were right about that woman!
- Don't--don't stop. She's going to be fine.

241
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:28,973
But what if they've done something to her?

242
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:30,538
She's going to be all right!

243
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:32,008
Made a call already.

244
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:44,105
Hi, Abby. How've you been?

245
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:46,214
Suzanne. I'm good. How are you?

246
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:48,522
Good, good. And your daughter--
She must be starting school--

247
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:52,101
She's good. I'm so sorry.
I'm in such a rush. I'll see you later, ok?

248
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,633
Sure, sure. Have a good day now.

249
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:03,965
What are you doing? Huh?

250
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:06,593
- I'm calling the cops.
- No! You cannot call the cops.

251
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:10,208
- Babe, babe, he's right there. He's--
- We have to do exactly what he says.

252
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:12,416
- But I just thought--
- No, listen to me.

253
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:16,227
Just calm down. Let's go.

254
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,032
- Is that everything?
- Yes, of course it's everything.

255
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:27,828
What, you think I'm going to risk Sophie's
life for the sake of a few bucks?

256
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:33,052
- You just did.
- Oh, Jesus Christ. Abby.

257
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:34,580
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,066
Let's just get it over with.

259
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,841
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

260
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:43,377
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

261
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,726
Um... I'm going to need some I.D.

262
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,484
Sure.

263
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,188
What do you need him for?

264
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:57,044
Well, it's just that it's a very large amount--

265
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:59,019
Yeah, it's a large amount,
but it's our money, isn't it?

266
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:01,711
- Of course, sir.
- Then just do it!

267
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:05,392
Stop it. Listen to me. You're going
to blow this whole thing, all right?

268
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:08,460
Just for Sophie.
Just go back to the car.

269
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,598
OK?

270
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,465
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:23,494
I'm sorry. My husband's under
a lot of pressure right now, so...

272
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,871
You're not too good
in a crisis, are you, Neil?

273
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,501
Shit!

274
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,344
Is there a problem here?

275
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:14,387
Uh...

276
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:20,247
- No, officer....
- OK, then move it.

277
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:22,289
- Yeah, I'm just waiting--
- Move it now.

278
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:23,539
Excuse me. Sorry.

279
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,454
Cash and cards now.

280
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:40,361
- Chop, chop. Give us your purse.
- Wallet.

281
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,672
Straight across here.
Straight across right here.

282
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:48,266
It's over now, OK?
You've got what you want.

283
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:50,857
- Now give us back our daughter.
- That's every cent we have.

284
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:55,721
Well, let's just check it, shall we? Eh?

285
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:56,706
Uhh.

286
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:10,025
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

287
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:11,715
You could say...

288
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:14,306
I've got money to burn.

289
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:16,253
Neil! Why are you doing this?

290
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:17,343
- Jesus!
- Please don't! Stop!

291
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:20,611
- Christ, what are you, crazy?
- Stop it! Stop it!

292
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,751
My money! What the hell are you doing?

293
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,985
Please stop! Please! Please!

294
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,678
That's our money burning!

295
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:33,313
- Stop it!
- For Christ's sake!

296
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,232
- Neil.
- God!

297
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:41,597
- Left. Go left.
- Oh, my God.

298
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:53,746
Oh, my God.

299
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,614
Oh, my God.

300
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,265
People are going to be wondering
where you are right now, so...

301
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:11,182
why don't you call your boss
and tell him you're going to be late?

302
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:14,068
- Late?
- You still might make it, Neil.

303
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:25,388
Karl. Hey, it's Neil.

304
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:27,147
Yeah, I got delayed.

305
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:31,241
Abby wasn't feeling so great,
But I'll be there as soon as I can.

306
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,922
No, no. You can give me directions
when I get closer, OK?

307
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:38,305
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Bye.

308
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,848
So what more do you want?

309
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,826
You.

310
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:53,252
You.

311
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,913
Westside. Now.

312
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:09,345
Dan, hi. It's Abby.
I don't think I'm going to make it.

313
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:32,279
Neil, That place over there.

314
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:34,485
They know me.
I've taken clients there.

315
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:38,516
Well, now you're taking a new client.

316
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,685
Hi, uh...Mr. Randall.

317
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:46,862
Good afternoon, sir.

318
00:23:46,902 --> 00:23:48,690
Pleasure to see you again.

319
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:53,131
Now, um, we have a table for three,
please?

320
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:55,822
- Right this way.
- May I take your coats?

321
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:58,182
It's all right.

322
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,112
What can I get you to drink?

323
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:05,518
Nothing, thank you.

324
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:08,617
Ahh, good bottle of wine. Red.

325
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:11,719
- Something around, uh, 200 bucks.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:14,530
And these prices--

327
00:24:14,572 --> 00:24:16,197
What would you recommend, Neil?

328
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:19,113
Who do you think you are?

329
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:21,416
Oh, that's easy.

330
00:24:23,018 --> 00:24:24,806
Right now,

331
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:27,110
I'm God.

332
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:29,510
Please just tell us
what you want us to do.

333
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:34,914
You know, people are always saying
they'd do anything for their kids.

334
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,858
Anything.

335
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:39,809
So I'm going to put that to the test.

336
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:43,160
For the next 24 hours, you're mine,
then you get her back, you got it?

337
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:44,413
Hmm.

338
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:48,185
- Can I take your order?
- Yeah, I guess--

339
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:50,199
I guess you got steak in here.

340
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:52,891
Yes, sir. Steak Dauphinoise.

341
00:24:52,928 --> 00:24:54,520
OK. That'll do. Yeah.

342
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,875
- Um, rare. Thank you.
- Sir?

343
00:24:59,134 --> 00:25:01,238
Oh, they're not eating.

344
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:05,978
Yeah, that's right.

345
00:25:06,012 --> 00:25:08,182
- You gotta run.
- That's right.

346
00:25:09,754 --> 00:25:11,314
Ahem.

347
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:13,142
Excuse me.

348
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:15,184
What do you mean, we've gotta run?

349
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:18,223
Well, we gotta pay for this somehow.

350
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:19,408
And I'm all out of cash.

351
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:20,876
So what are we supposed
to do about that?

352
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,412
You're going to walk
out of here right now.

353
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,340
You're not going to talk
to your buddy on the door,

354
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:25,321
and you're going to go get some.

355
00:25:27,637 --> 00:25:32,075
and if you're not back here by 5:30
with, say, 300 bucks,

356
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:35,496
well, you know what they say.

357
00:25:35,537 --> 00:25:38,286
Never pick a fight with someone
who's got nothing to lose.

358
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:45,124
Run along.

359
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,369
That's good.

360
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:56,866
- Who you calling?
- Kristin. That designer I met last month.

361
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:58,531
- Who?
- Kristin.

362
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,903
Will you ever listen to anything I say?
She's 4 blocks from here.

363
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:02,180
Voicemail. No answer.

364
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:04,191
There's gotta be someone else
we know around here.

365
00:26:04,232 --> 00:26:05,180
We don't know anyone on this side of town.

366
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:07,459
How does he know about our lives?
What have we done to him?

367
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:10,364
We haven't done anything, babe.
Ok? He's just crazy. That's what it is.

368
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:11,715
Do you know him from work? Tell me.

369
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:13,091
Is it from accounts?
Somebody you pissed off?

370
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,572
No. What, enough that he'd take our kid?
I don't think so. No way.

371
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:17,855
We've only got 15 minutes.

372
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:19,452
- Oh, God.
- Listen to me.

373
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:21,313
Listen to me.
He's got to get the money.

374
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:25,371
- Please. Uh, this is important. It's--
- Neil!

375
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:29,499
- Neil!
- We really need your help.

376
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:30,550
Please listen to us.

377
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:34,583
My name is Neil Randall. And, uh,
this is my card. This is my wife.

378
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:36,312
OK, we need--we need money.

379
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:38,356
We're not begging.
OK, if you could just--

380
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,022
Oh, I'm late for a meeting.

381
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,002
No. No, you get back.

382
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:43,604
Our daughter could--

383
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,104
No, don't!

384
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,251
Our daughter could die
if you don't help us.

385
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:50,743
If you don't take your hands off of me
in the next 2 seconds--

386
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,205
Neil, let him go. Let's go.

387
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:54,036
I have an idea. I have an idea!

388
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:02,253
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.

389
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:03,722
We need to sell this bracelet.

390
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:08,208
- I paid 2 grand for that.
- We only need 300.

391
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:09,191
- Yeah.
- OK.

392
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,750
Come on. We gotta go.

393
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:16,400
It's a fake. Give you 20 bucks.

394
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,659
What? It's not a fake.

395
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:21,996
- Are you kidding me?
- Baby, I paid 2 grand for it, OK?

396
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,655
Stop.

397
00:27:23,694 --> 00:27:26,857
I was kidding. Kidding.
I'll give you 200, OK?

398
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:30,754
- Funny. 300.
- Oh, forget it.

399
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:36,127
Yeah. Well, there's just one little thing.

400
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:39,974
I can't forget it.

401
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:42,211
300. Now.

402
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,753
Come on. We got 2 minutes.

403
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,365
This way.

404
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:51,386
Aah!

405
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:06,332
- Where'd he go?
- S-sir?

406
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,603
Where did he go?
He was sitting right there.

407
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:10,394
I--I'm sorry, sir. I didn't see, um...

408
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:13,496
- The man, he was sitting right there.
- Uh, I'm sorry, I--

409
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:15,540
- Come on. You must have!
- Hey.

410
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:19,764
Dead on time.

411
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:23,576
Now this place ain't bad.

412
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,781
I might bring the good wife here, huh?

413
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:28,402
Settle this up, would you, Neil?

414
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,228
'Scuse us.

415
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,909
- So you got it?
- Yeah.

416
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,258
Quite a performance.

417
00:28:38,293 --> 00:28:41,194
Let's see if you can
get to South Frank within 20 from here.

418
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:43,821
- I need this delivered in person.
- What's this?

419
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,004
- What's going on?
- Go and check the station after it's done.

420
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:47,594
Just a little errand for Abby, Neil.
Calm down.

421
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:49,226
- What is it?
- I don't know.

422
00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:49,361
- (Indistinct)
- Easy, hey.

423
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,630
- (Indistinct)
- Easy, hey.

424
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,354
I want to get to know you a little better.

425
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:54,820
We might have something
in common--

426
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:56,008
For Christ's sake.

427
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:58,980
It's all right. Neil. I can do it.

428
00:28:59,022 --> 00:29:00,549
I can deliver a letter, OK?

429
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:04,106
OK, OK. You go.

430
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,601
Take care, OK?

431
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,831
You're not worried, are you?

432
00:29:12,873 --> 00:29:16,036
She might see a cop.
Start getting ideas.

433
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:17,119
No, she'll do it.

434
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:21,435
- Uhh.
- Abby!

435
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:23,201
Wait. Leave it. Leave it.

436
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:26,237
- You son of a bitch!
- Just leave it, OK?

437
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:27,771
All right?

438
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:30,681
Anger's good, Neil.

439
00:29:30,724 --> 00:29:32,512
Come on.

440
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:33,757
Come on. Let's go.

441
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:35,070
Let's go.

442
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,859
Hey!

443
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:43,478
Hey!

444
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,739
Hey.

445
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:54,362
One word and your daughter's dead.

446
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:57,267
- Hey.
- Dad.

447
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:01,105
It's good to see you, son.
How are you?

448
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:04,406
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, well, I just, uh...

449
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,603
had to come in for work, and, uh...

450
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,719
Well, what about you?

451
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,646
I mean, I wouldn't expect to see you
on the Westside.

452
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,947
Kory, that girl I met in social studies.

453
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:15,053
She lives just down the street, so.

454
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:16,337
Good.

455
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:17,898
Good.

456
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,101
Is, uh, everything OK?

457
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:22,415
Yeah, I'm fine.

458
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,167
Oh, just work, job.

459
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,859
I got a lot on my mind and stuff.

460
00:30:26,897 --> 00:30:29,263
Listen, we gotta run.

461
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:31,684
- I'll catch you later on, OK?
- Yeah, sure.

462
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:36,199
Could you--
uh, use a ride, or...

463
00:30:36,238 --> 00:30:37,895
- Yeah.
- Neil.

464
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:40,420
Have you forgotten something?

465
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,314
If you're late?

466
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:44,486
Huh?

467
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:45,952
Your wife'll kill you.

468
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:47,336
Yeah, I forgot.

469
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:51,491
I'm sorry, son. We're pushed for time.
I'll talk to you later, OK?

470
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:52,641
Sure.

471
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:23,034
So you got a child of your own
and you put us through this.

472
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:28,025
What's he going to think
of the two of you when this comes out?

473
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:39,535
Have you thought about that?

474
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:52,332
Hey, what's he going to think, huh?

475
00:31:52,373 --> 00:31:55,372
Tell me. Come on.

476
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:56,621
What's he going to think?

477
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:59,658
What's he going to tell Kory when mom
and dad are on the evening news?

478
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:01,487
Have you thought about that?

479
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,211
Well, have you?

480
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,547
What the hell are you doing?

481
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,544
Uhh.

482
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:22,569
How's everything going at work?

483
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,428
I hear advertising's a cutthroat business.

484
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:32,870
A lot of pressure.

485
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,080
Is that why you screw up
so many people's lives?

486
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:40,484
What are you talking about?

487
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:42,424
Recognize that place?

488
00:32:44,227 --> 00:32:46,332
Fifth floor. Straight ahead.

489
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:49,627
That's the head office
of Magris Industries.

490
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:52,031
You've heard of them?

491
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:54,301
Of course you have.

492
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:56,757
And with this million dollar launch
coming up,

493
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,962
I'm sure this is something
you'd want to keep under wraps.

494
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:03,674
What do you get for hacking into
corporate information these days?

495
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:09,106
- Where'd you get this?
- Ah, don't panic. It's only a copy.

496
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:12,624
Abby has the original.

497
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,119
Yeah, it's all down there
in black and white.

498
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:20,817
Times, places.

499
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:23,221
How you bought your way
into getting that account.

500
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:26,798
What would the competition do
with something like that?

501
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:29,519
Your company's reputation
will be ruined.

502
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:34,159
But Karl won't blame you, Neil.
Will he?

503
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,950
Well, Mr. Carver's due back any minute,
but I can give it to him for you.

504
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,373
No, it's OK. I've got to really give it
to him myself, thank you.

505
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:43,845
Sure. Have a seat.

506
00:33:54,124 --> 00:33:56,709
You just want to destroy
everything we've got, don't you?

507
00:33:56,747 --> 00:33:58,885
Look, I don't want
to destroy you, Neil.

508
00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:00,777
I'll prove it.

509
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,239
I'll give you one shot.

510
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:06,215
- Stop her.
- You serious?

511
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:07,327
Stop her.

512
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:17,245
Uhh. Come on. Come on. Shit!

513
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,063
Hello?

514
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:31,129
Abby? It's--It's Neil.

515
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:33,884
Abby, don't hand over that envelope.

516
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,885
- What?
- Look, I--I don't have time to explain.

517
00:34:36,926 --> 00:34:38,452
Just walk out of the office, OK?

518
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,500
We have to do what he says, Neil.

519
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:41,685
Think about Sophie.

520
00:34:41,725 --> 00:34:43,579
Get out of there, Abby, please.

521
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:45,204
No, listen to me.
We have to do what he said.

522
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:47,414
Get out of there!
Look, he says it's all right.

523
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,595
All right.

524
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:49,878
Time's up.

525
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:06,189
Oh, no. Abby, no!

526
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:12,939
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Carver?

527
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:16,076
No! Abby, for Christ's sake, no!

528
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,069
No! Don't!

529
00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:22,828
Abby, for Christ's sake! I said don't!

530
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:27,553
Shit!

531
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:45,637
Go on. You know you're dying for one.

532
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,753
Been thinking about something
you said in that restaurant.

533
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,109
Do you know what it was?

534
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:59,200
"I'm Mr. Randall," you said.

535
00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:01,405
Maybe it's just me, but there's
something about you,

536
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:03,612
or anyone, calling themselves mister

537
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:08,569
that makes me feel
kind of...sick.

538
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,577
You know what I mean?

539
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:25,937
Yeah.

540
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,701
You think you can rely on someone,

541
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:29,591
And then she just...

542
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,374
You're pathetic.

543
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:40,427
By comparison to you, Neil,
of course I'm pathetic.

544
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:45,869
I mean, you've got everything.
Great job, nice...house.

545
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,565
Terrific wife.

546
00:36:47,603 --> 00:36:49,228
Shit.

547
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:51,687
I was going to say lovely daughter.

548
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:57,453
Hey. Let's see how she's doing.

549
00:37:05,548 --> 00:37:06,977
8-2-7.

550
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:13,413
Hey. It's me.

551
00:37:14,474 --> 00:37:16,229
Any problems?

552
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:20,289
Good.

553
00:37:20,328 --> 00:37:22,782
Right. She's watching cartoons.

554
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:26,018
- Let me speak to my daughter!
- All right. I'll check in later.

555
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:27,395
Keep the door locked.

556
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:30,202
Here you go.

557
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,204
She's an attractive woman, Neil.

558
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:35,704
Don't be hard on her.

559
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:39,872
I'm so sorry. I had to do it.

560
00:37:39,905 --> 00:37:41,465
- No. I know.
- I didn't know what to do.

561
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,959
Listen, I've got to pick something up.

562
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,493
You stay here.

563
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:51,923
Why didn't you do what I--

564
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:53,971
What I told you?

565
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:56,467
Because I do what he tells me
to do until he says otherwise.

566
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,408
You know what? It doesn't matter.

567
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:01,173
I wasn't going to put Sophie in danger.

568
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,380
Not in danger. He told me to stop you.

569
00:38:03,418 --> 00:38:05,937
Yes, but if I had done that,
who knows what he would have said?

570
00:38:05,977 --> 00:38:08,016
Abby, he's playing with us.
Don't you get that?

571
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:10,030
- Yes, I get that.
- Well, that's a good girl.

572
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:12,045
Don't patronize me.

573
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:14,955
And don't stand there pretending that
your precious career doesn't matter.

574
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:16,404
Oh, you mean the thing
that keeps you in luxury?

575
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:19,054
Yeah, playing blocks with Sophie
for the past 6 years has been luxury.

576
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:21,611
Well, I'm real sorry, babe,
if bringing up your child

577
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:22,764
has been such a pain in the ass to you.

578
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:25,104
I didn't say that,
and by the way, Neil, honey,

579
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:26,511
she's our child!

580
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,731
This is what he wants.

581
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,710
- Oh, screw you.
- No, this is what he wants.

582
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:33,700
- Stop.
- Listen to me.

583
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:37,058
I have been listening
to you my whole life.

584
00:38:37,102 --> 00:38:39,851
Do you get it? My whole life!

585
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:42,438
No, you listen to me! You listen to me.

586
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:52,068
Why don't you just go back to Denver?

587
00:38:54,856 --> 00:38:59,328
It's a really great time
to bring that up, baby.

588
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,188
Really great.

589
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:08,800
I'm sorry.

590
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,685
Neil, his phone.

591
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:23,253
He just called the sitter.

592
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:24,636
We can get the number, quick!

593
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:29,404
Hurry up. Hurry up.

594
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:32,021
555-1215.

595
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,882
He's coming, he's coming.

596
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:36,086
I'm not going to let that asshole--

597
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:37,977
Put it down, put it down!

598
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,068
I want this delivered.

599
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,019
There will be a nice
surprise waiting for you.

600
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:52,555
Take the train.

601
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:54,898
One hour there and back.

602
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,754
What is it?

603
00:39:56,788 --> 00:39:59,536
I'll wait here.

604
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:01,131
No.

605
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,415
What did you say?

606
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:06,569
I think you heard me.

607
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:08,015
Neil, come on.

608
00:40:10,096 --> 00:40:11,044
Don't worry about it, Abby.

609
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:14,348
I think, underneath it all,
he's really quite the family man.

610
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:16,748
You're really beginning
to annoy me, Neil.

611
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,438
But anger is good, right?

612
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:20,069
Really beginning to piss me off.

613
00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:21,481
What exactly are you
going to do about that--

614
00:40:21,515 --> 00:40:22,725
(Indistinct)

615
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:24,453
Stop!

616
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:26,691
Please, get off.

617
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:28,965
Please, stop.

618
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:31,421
Will this do you, boyo, huh?

619
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:34,180
- Will this do you?
- Please, no!

620
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:36,516
He'll do it.

621
00:40:38,693 --> 00:40:40,929
That box. One hour.

622
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,637
It's OK...

623
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:45,984
Are you OK, baby?

624
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,960
Are you OK? It's OK.

625
00:40:48,003 --> 00:40:49,944
I'm OK, I'm OK.

626
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:50,178
Final boarding call
for the express to New York City...

627
00:40:50,178 --> 00:40:54,137
Final boarding call
for the express to New York City...

628
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:56,543
Baby, we can't, it's too dangerous. Please.

629
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:00,382
Yeah.

630
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:03,796
What's he trying to do to us, huh?

631
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,863
He's wiping out our lives. Bit by bit.

632
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,758
- I'm calling that number.
- No. Are you crazy--

633
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,995
After he dialed, the first thing
he said was "827."

634
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:26,991
Now, why would he say that?
It's gotta be a hotel room.

635
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:29,330
What if he's watching?

636
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:44,365
It's a hotel, Allerton Crowne Plaza.
I knew it.

637
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,676
This could be the only chance we get.

638
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,400
It's 8 blocks from here.

639
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:53,193
May I help you?

640
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:57,320
We've got an hour.

641
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:01,888
Excuse me.

642
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,068
- I'm sorry, this is an emergency.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

643
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,722
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, come on, are you serious?

644
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:09,662
Oh, God, what's next?

645
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:12,572
Abby, I'm not going to wait
to find out what's next. I'm opening it.

646
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,615
Neil...

647
00:42:15,654 --> 00:42:17,214
I gotta do it, baby,

648
00:42:17,253 --> 00:42:18,562
I gotta find out.

649
00:42:45,211 --> 00:42:47,120
The whole thing's
a mind game, Abby.

650
00:42:49,306 --> 00:42:52,272
Don't worry. We'll get her back.

651
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:56,207
Come on.

652
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,077
Good evening. Welcome
to the Allerton Crowne Plaza.

653
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,149
- Can I help you?
- Have you seen...

654
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:19,405
They're here. Dark haired, 40-year-old
woman with a little girl in a pink sweatsuit.

655
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:22,309
- They checked in today.
- All right.

656
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,925
They said that the little
girl seemed really quiet.

657
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:37,956
Keep her talking.

658
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:49,346
Is there a dry cleaning service here?

659
00:43:49,382 --> 00:43:51,291
- Yes, ma'am, there is.
- Oh, good.

660
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:56,761
Honey.

661
00:43:56,804 --> 00:44:00,152
Honey, we really ought to get going.

662
00:44:00,195 --> 00:44:01,340
Thank you so much.

663
00:44:04,065 --> 00:44:05,723
We'll take the stairs.

664
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:16,954
825. It's the next one.

665
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:20,177
It's going to be on that side.

666
00:44:24,314 --> 00:44:25,907
Shh.

667
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:40,591
It's a TV.

668
00:44:42,837 --> 00:44:44,724
- Wait here.
- No.

669
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:48,017
- You need to wait here.
- Be careful.

670
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,668
I'm calling the cops
if anything happens, OK?

671
00:45:01,806 --> 00:45:03,845
The space
beneath the rock is vacant,

672
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:05,446
She who gives--
(Indistinct)

673
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:08,582
I want my diary!

674
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:13,386
Speaking of vacant,

675
00:45:13,418 --> 00:45:16,265
anybody seen Dork, Dorkk, and Dorky?

676
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:20,420
Wow! Good thing that problem cleared up,
huh, Edd?

677
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:22,016
Enough is enough, Eddy.

678
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:25,316
My mind is riddled with
unpleasant images.

679
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:29,146
I implore you. Please,
I could use some help here!

680
00:45:29,189 --> 00:45:31,076
(Indistinct)

681
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:34,271
That's it! I suggest
we sneak back to the house,

682
00:45:34,308 --> 00:45:36,511
we bury the book
within its boundaries,

683
00:45:36,546 --> 00:45:38,750
and deceptively plead amnesia.

684
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:40,509
I like that!

685
00:45:40,545 --> 00:45:42,911
Double D, that's so underhanded!

686
00:45:42,945 --> 00:45:44,537
Oh, yeah. You're right.

687
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,947
Oh.

688
00:45:51,422 --> 00:45:54,236
You think you can
get away with anything

689
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:57,017
because you're just that bit smarter
than the rest of us.

690
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,223
Huh?

691
00:46:00,603 --> 00:46:02,228
Tell me something, Neil.

692
00:46:03,865 --> 00:46:07,213
How does it feel
to be played, huh?

693
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,733
We're just trying
to save our daughter.

694
00:46:14,198 --> 00:46:15,408
Abby!

695
00:46:19,157 --> 00:46:21,327
Where is she? Where is she?

696
00:46:21,364 --> 00:46:22,738
How come you didn't
have another one, Abby?

697
00:46:22,771 --> 00:46:25,137
Hmm?

698
00:46:25,171 --> 00:46:28,017
I'm not sure you're the perfect wife
you'd like to think you are.

699
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:31,823
Hmm? I'm not sure
you even any better--

700
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:33,033
Bastard!

701
00:46:33,072 --> 00:46:35,013
Leave her alone!
Don't you touch her.

702
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:40,805
Look at me. Are you OK?

703
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:42,274
Here you go.

704
00:46:43,628 --> 00:46:47,107
Put it on, Abby. See, huh?

705
00:46:47,148 --> 00:46:49,798
- Want to put this on?
- No.

706
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:51,011
Come on, Abby, put it on.

707
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,416
Put it on. Take it.

708
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:54,496
- You'll pay for this.
- Put it on.

709
00:46:54,537 --> 00:46:56,675
- She's not doing it.
- Why not, huh?

710
00:46:56,712 --> 00:46:59,973
- I said she's not doing it!
- Why not? She might like it.

711
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:01,436
I said she's not doing it!

712
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:03,867
No, Neil.

713
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:10,459
You're not putting your big dick pride
before your kid, are you?

714
00:47:10,499 --> 00:47:12,441
Please, stop. Don't...

715
00:47:12,483 --> 00:47:14,424
I'll do it.

716
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:16,353
I'll do it, I'll do it.

717
00:47:28,414 --> 00:47:30,868
Come on, Abby.

718
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,383
Come on.

719
00:47:45,591 --> 00:47:47,631
Come here, come here.

720
00:47:47,671 --> 00:47:50,256
Stay there, now.

721
00:48:04,402 --> 00:48:06,310
I think she's enjoying this.

722
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,793
Danger.

723
00:48:10,832 --> 00:48:12,325
Yeah.

724
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:21,381
Acting out the victim.

725
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:27,204
This is the most alive she's felt in years.

726
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,556
Yeah, let's put the dress on.

727
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,532
Oh, yeah, that's it.

728
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:50,395
She smells good.

729
00:48:52,706 --> 00:48:54,942
Smells real good.

730
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,466
When this is over, I will kill you.

731
00:49:13,499 --> 00:49:17,807
Yeah, yeah, but it isn't over,
is it, Neil?

732
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:19,572
No.

733
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:21,812
You be there at 8:00.

734
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:23,670
Otherwise, you'll never see
either of them again.

735
00:49:23,703 --> 00:49:25,645
Be where? Be where at 8:00?

736
00:49:25,687 --> 00:49:27,410
The answer's right here, Neil,

737
00:49:27,446 --> 00:49:29,617
Staring you in the face.

738
00:49:29,653 --> 00:49:31,595
You're hitting the big time, now.

739
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:34,254
Let's see if you can make it to the top.

740
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:35,633
What are you talking about?

741
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:38,634
Why don't you have a Scotch
while you figure it out?

742
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,657
Neil!

743
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,788
Tell me where, for Christ's sake!
Be where?

744
00:49:43,825 --> 00:49:45,417
Prick!

745
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:55,016
Come on. Hurry up.

746
00:49:55,053 --> 00:49:56,296
Unh!

747
00:50:02,282 --> 00:50:03,329
Come on!

748
00:50:49,531 --> 00:50:51,767
You just want your life back.

749
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:54,223
What do you think?

750
00:50:54,265 --> 00:50:57,559
Well, get out of the car then.

751
00:51:04,086 --> 00:51:05,515
Shit.

752
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:14,764
Hit the big time...

753
00:51:52,198 --> 00:51:53,245
Shit.

754
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:34,833
Oh, oh, shit.

755
00:52:47,508 --> 00:52:48,456
Yeah?

756
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,440
Missing you already.

757
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:53,199
I made it. I'm at the clock tower.

758
00:52:53,234 --> 00:52:54,663
Too late.

759
00:52:54,706 --> 00:52:58,414
No, no, no, I did what you asked.
I--I--I got here.

760
00:52:58,448 --> 00:53:00,269
You're too late.

761
00:53:00,304 --> 00:53:02,986
Jesus Christ.
What do you want from me?

762
00:53:03,023 --> 00:53:05,389
It's not all bad.
I'll let you say good-bye.

763
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:07,493
What? No, wait.

764
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:11,979
- Neil? Neil?
- Baby, listen.

765
00:53:12,012 --> 00:53:14,945
- Neil, listen, he's got--
- Time's up.

766
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:17,287
W-where are you?

767
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:20,004
W-what are you going to do?

768
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:21,950
Come and take a look, Neil.

769
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,588
- Where?
- The edge, Neil.

770
00:53:26,631 --> 00:53:29,314
Just step up to the edge
and look down.

771
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:43,230
OK...OK...

772
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:46,046
You're not scared, are you?

773
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,981
A little bird told me
you're not crazy about heights.

774
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:51,739
I'm at the edge.
I'm at the goddamn edge!

775
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:53,781
Abby really wanted one last look.

776
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:56,025
- No, wait, wait.
- But if you haven't got the balls--

777
00:53:56,061 --> 00:53:57,883
I can't even see you.

778
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:00,566
You're not at the edge, Neil,
or we'd see you.

779
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,970
- I want to see you standing.
- Wait, wait!

780
00:54:08,185 --> 00:54:10,094
OK, OK, I--

781
00:54:10,136 --> 00:54:13,037
- I see you.
- Stand up, Neil.

782
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:14,159
No...

783
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:15,792
- Get up.
- No.

784
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:18,163
- Neil, get up.
- Please, don't do this.

785
00:54:20,021 --> 00:54:21,875
Be a real man for once in your life.

786
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:26,855
Unh...

787
00:54:37,711 --> 00:54:38,888
I'm here.

788
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:41,992
I'm...

789
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,590
Tell him to move back.
It's too dangerous.

790
00:54:43,629 --> 00:54:45,832
- I'm on the edge.
- (Indistinct)

791
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,526
Tell him to move back. That's enough!

792
00:54:47,564 --> 00:54:49,286
No, please, he'll kill himself.

793
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:50,632
That's enough! Listen to me!

794
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:52,554
No!

795
00:54:52,586 --> 00:54:54,887
- Don't you touch her!
- Get in the car.

796
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:58,270
Stay in here. Stay in there.

797
00:55:00,616 --> 00:55:03,615
Listen, it doesn't matter
that you were late.

798
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:05,476
I was going to have her anyway.

799
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,095
Only she doesn't know that yet.

800
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:14,592
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this to me?

801
00:55:14,626 --> 00:55:17,473
Why? Why...

802
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:21,081
Haven't you seen it yet?

803
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:22,527
Huh, Neil?

804
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,021
What are you talking about?

805
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:25,624
The answer is up there.

806
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:31,255
Ah, it's right there. Look around.

807
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:34,391
- Where?
- It's under your nose.

808
00:55:34,428 --> 00:55:38,005
Come on, you want
to know why, don't you?

809
00:55:42,777 --> 00:55:44,151
Aah!

810
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,768
What does it mean?

811
00:55:54,806 --> 00:55:57,107
I'll tell you what it means.

812
00:55:57,141 --> 00:56:00,042
It means stamping out a problem.

813
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,806
Crushing it.

814
00:56:01,844 --> 00:56:04,232
So, now I've got
your daughter and your wife.

815
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:11,213
And you're just a tiny dot in the sky
worth nothing.

816
00:56:11,248 --> 00:56:15,524
Please, no, I'm begging you, don't.

817
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:18,533
And what exactly am I going to do?

818
00:56:18,573 --> 00:56:21,606
I'll leave that to your imagination, Neil.

819
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:24,295
Don't you hang up! Don't you hang up!

820
00:56:24,331 --> 00:56:26,720
Sweet dreams.

821
00:56:30,537 --> 00:56:32,871
A-Abby!

822
00:56:32,905 --> 00:56:34,083
Abby!

823
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:27,343
- Hey, whoa!
- I need help.

824
00:57:27,383 --> 00:57:29,870
- Yeah, the line's back there, sir.
- No, this is an emergency.

825
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:32,560
My--my wife and child
have been kidnapped.

826
00:57:32,597 --> 00:57:34,123
There's a psycho out there,

827
00:57:34,165 --> 00:57:37,425
OK, he--he's taken
my wife and my little girl.

828
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,720
You got my car, he's driving my car.
He--it's a Range Rover,

829
00:57:40,754 --> 00:57:44,233
"R"-"U", uh, 83--83 "A."

830
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:47,120
And there--he's got
a woman who's helping him. She's--

831
00:57:47,153 --> 00:57:48,559
Pretending to be a sitter?

832
00:57:48,592 --> 00:57:51,078
Randall, right?
Your name is Neil Randall?

833
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,151
- Yeah.
- I just spoke to your wife.

834
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,328
- She was here.
- What?

835
00:57:58,221 --> 00:58:01,035
- W-wait, when?
- About half an hour ago.

836
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:06,208
You spoke--
you spoke to my wife?

837
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,559
- Yeah.
- She's OK?

838
00:58:07,593 --> 00:58:10,048
- She explained the whole thing.
- OK.

839
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:13,023
She said that
you might show up with this story.

840
00:58:13,064 --> 00:58:15,551
At the state you're in,
you'll try anything to stop her.

841
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,935
Stop her doing what?

842
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:21,566
Leaving you.

843
00:58:22,852 --> 00:58:26,081
No, you don't understand.

844
00:58:26,115 --> 00:58:28,286
No, she's not leaving me.

845
00:58:28,323 --> 00:58:30,232
No, he made her say that.

846
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:31,768
OK? He's got
the whole thing planned.

847
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,526
He's smart. Oh, he--
he's smart, all right.

848
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,861
He, uh--he's got our daughter.

849
00:58:36,896 --> 00:58:41,335
And he's made us--
forced us to do everything he says.

850
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:41,501
Look, I get it. I know how you feel.

851
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:43,639
Look, I get it. I know how you feel.

852
00:58:43,675 --> 00:58:45,976
My wife left me a year ago.

853
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:48,311
I went a bit--crazy myself.

854
00:58:48,346 --> 00:58:50,287
I'm not some
jealous husband, all right?

855
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:53,111
I'm the victim of a crime!

856
00:58:56,055 --> 00:58:58,901
Look, you've been drinking.

857
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:03,602
I'm not drunk. He did this to me.

858
00:59:03,637 --> 00:59:07,596
Do yourself a favor.
Go home, sober up.

859
00:59:07,635 --> 00:59:10,351
Try and accept it, all right?

860
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:14,477
Nothing for me to do. Can't help you.
All right?

861
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:17,546
Let's go, I'll walk you out.

862
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:43,411
It's all right. Oh!

863
01:00:43,443 --> 01:00:44,458
- Oh, baby.
- It's OK!

864
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:45,513
- It's OK.
- Are you OK?

865
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:47,943
- He didn't touch me.
- You promise me?

866
01:00:47,986 --> 01:00:49,163
Yes, I promise.

867
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:57,929
He made me lie to that cop.

868
01:00:57,967 --> 01:00:59,876
I thought you were going
to fall off the building.

869
01:00:59,918 --> 01:01:02,022
I thought you were going to die.

870
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:03,044
Oh, baby.

871
01:01:03,085 --> 01:01:04,328
Oh, baby I thought I'd lost you.

872
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:06,698
I thought--

873
01:01:06,732 --> 01:01:08,870
- I thought I'd lost everything.
- It's OK.

874
01:01:08,907 --> 01:01:10,216
Remember that feeling!

875
01:01:12,362 --> 01:01:15,525
'Cause the next time I tell you to do
something you're going to do it, right?

876
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,361
Right, Mr. Randall?

877
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:23,489
Good, now we understand
each other.

878
01:01:23,527 --> 01:01:25,348
Get in the back.

879
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:39,807
Why don't we just do it?
Whatever it is.

880
01:01:42,112 --> 01:01:43,225
Yeah.

881
01:02:09,815 --> 01:02:11,407
I love you, Abby.

882
01:02:13,014 --> 01:02:14,606
You know that, right?

883
01:02:19,828 --> 01:02:22,412
Look what it takes
for us to get this close.

884
01:02:26,866 --> 01:02:30,028
You guess where you're going yet?

885
01:02:30,064 --> 01:02:32,583
Just tell us.

886
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,445
We're going where you
were going all along.

887
01:02:36,942 --> 01:02:38,534
We're going to meet the boss.

888
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:41,609
The top man.

889
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,776
Karl Granger.

890
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:55,043
I knew it had something
to do with work.

891
01:02:57,255 --> 01:02:59,710
Maybe.

892
01:02:59,751 --> 01:03:03,263
Jesus. I don't know anything, anymore.

893
01:03:05,316 --> 01:03:07,225
Home sweet home.

894
01:03:28,765 --> 01:03:30,520
You first, now.

895
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,149
Just ease the way.

896
01:03:34,427 --> 01:03:36,248
What do I tell him?

897
01:03:36,282 --> 01:03:38,550
Just tell him the truth.

898
01:03:40,537 --> 01:03:41,518
Get out.

899
01:03:41,561 --> 01:03:43,415
Just do it.

900
01:04:08,112 --> 01:04:09,158
Hey, Neil.

901
01:04:15,693 --> 01:04:17,318
There something
I forgot to ask you.

902
01:04:17,356 --> 01:04:18,785
What?

903
01:04:18,828 --> 01:04:20,584
How far would you go?

904
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,205
What?

905
01:04:23,243 --> 01:04:25,631
To save the things
most important to you.

906
01:04:25,673 --> 01:04:26,720
How far?

907
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:30,109
I would do whatever it takes
to protect my family.

908
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:32,094
Yeah, I can understand that.

909
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:34,274
And that's a great thing.

910
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:36,481
There's this one last thing
I want you to do.

911
01:04:44,388 --> 01:04:45,631
Go on.

912
01:04:50,785 --> 01:04:52,857
I want you to kill, Neil.

913
01:04:54,464 --> 01:04:56,318
You wanted to know
what this was all about.

914
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:59,133
Well, this is it.

915
01:05:01,502 --> 01:05:05,178
No. You are crazy. I can't do that.

916
01:05:05,213 --> 01:05:06,554
You don't have to.

917
01:05:08,507 --> 01:05:10,776
But if you don't...

918
01:05:10,811 --> 01:05:12,436
You'll never see Sophie again.

919
01:05:13,594 --> 01:05:15,481
Because believe one thing,

920
01:05:15,514 --> 01:05:19,571
I don't give a damn
what happens to me.

921
01:05:21,143 --> 01:05:22,255
I can't--I can't--

922
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:23,636
Neil, there's no debate here, OK?

923
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:27,084
There's one person in that house and if
they're not dead in the next 10 minutes,

924
01:05:27,126 --> 01:05:28,270
someone else will be.

925
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,016
Have you forgotten
that feeling already?

926
01:05:39,121 --> 01:05:40,714
10 minutes.

927
01:08:08,608 --> 01:08:10,811
Oh, Jesus.

928
01:08:10,847 --> 01:08:12,602
You scared the life out of me.

929
01:08:14,334 --> 01:08:15,413
Judy?

930
01:08:15,453 --> 01:08:17,656
I just took a shower.

931
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:19,699
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to make it.

932
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,892
Mmm.

933
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:26,643
God, Neil, you look awful.

934
01:08:26,682 --> 01:08:28,023
What happened?

935
01:08:29,785 --> 01:08:31,956
You were stuck with Abby
when you called, weren't you?

936
01:08:31,992 --> 01:08:33,585
Is she OK?

937
01:08:36,183 --> 01:08:39,793
Yeah. She's OK.

938
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:43,920
Well, she bought all that stuff
about going to Karl's, didn't she?

939
01:08:43,956 --> 01:08:46,476
Yeah, she trusts me.

940
01:08:48,626 --> 01:08:50,219
Yeah.

941
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:53,708
Anyways, let's get this jacket off.

942
01:08:53,745 --> 01:08:54,857
No, no.

943
01:08:57,104 --> 01:08:58,510
It's cold out there.

944
01:08:59,983 --> 01:09:01,509
OK.

945
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:03,339
Well, come in by the fire, then.

946
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:07,653
The usual?

947
01:09:08,972 --> 01:09:11,208
Yeah--yeah, thanks.

948
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:18,848
So, how did you find the place?

949
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:20,448
I thought you were going to call.

950
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:24,832
I know what's wrong.

951
01:09:24,871 --> 01:09:26,757
It's a long drive,

952
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:28,993
plenty of time
to discover a conscience.

953
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:34,975
Look, Neil, don't you
think I felt guilty, too?

954
01:09:35,011 --> 01:09:39,614
But we've had all these months
of watching our backs.

955
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:43,194
Going to our little French restaurant,
in the afternoons.

956
01:09:43,232 --> 01:09:46,711
Now, finally, we can just relax
and enjoy each other.

957
01:09:46,752 --> 01:09:47,864
Right?

958
01:09:49,535 --> 01:09:51,127
I don't know.

959
01:09:51,165 --> 01:09:52,278
Neil.

960
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,212
Neil?

961
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,390
- Look, have I done something wrong?
- No.

962
01:10:03,706 --> 01:10:05,909
- Well, then, what is it?
- It's nothing.

963
01:10:05,945 --> 01:10:07,984
Well, it's got to be something.

964
01:10:17,525 --> 01:10:19,117
Who is that?

965
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:22,505
That's my husband Tom.

966
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:27,654
I guess now you can put a face
to the name.

967
01:10:31,505 --> 01:10:32,879
Where is he right now?

968
01:10:32,912 --> 01:10:36,042
You know where he is.
He's on that hunting trip.

969
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:37,671
That's why we're here.

970
01:10:39,245 --> 01:10:42,790
God, anyway, what's
with the sudden interest in Tom?

971
01:10:42,828 --> 01:10:43,842
You've never given a damn before--

972
01:10:43,885 --> 01:10:45,793
What do you think
he would do, if he found out?

973
01:10:45,836 --> 01:10:47,624
He's not going to find out.

974
01:10:47,659 --> 01:10:49,219
Answer me!
Just what would Tom do?

975
01:10:49,258 --> 01:10:51,330
I don't know what he'd do.

976
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:53,638
It would destroy him.

977
01:10:53,673 --> 01:10:55,233
Christ!

978
01:10:55,272 --> 01:10:57,410
Why are we even talking about this?

979
01:10:57,448 --> 01:10:59,935
He's got Sophie.

980
01:10:59,975 --> 01:11:01,349
What?!

981
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:04,131
Your husband has my child!

982
01:11:04,165 --> 01:11:05,957
Why would Tom have Sophie? What--

983
01:11:05,957 --> 01:11:07,167
Why would Tom have Sophie? What--

984
01:11:07,205 --> 01:11:09,440
Because he knows about us!

985
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,630
- What?
- He knows everything, Judy.

986
01:11:15,457 --> 01:11:17,180
Tom knows.

987
01:11:17,218 --> 01:11:18,810
Baby.

988
01:11:18,848 --> 01:11:20,441
He's going to kill her.

989
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,367
- What?
- If I don't...

990
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:25,715
If you--if you don't what? What?

991
01:11:25,759 --> 01:11:28,147
Baby, you're scaring me.

992
01:11:29,405 --> 01:11:32,665
He says, he's going to kill her--

993
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,976
- What are you--
- If I don't--

994
01:11:34,011 --> 01:11:35,124
Doing with a...

995
01:11:35,163 --> 01:11:36,689
No!

996
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:38,257
No!

997
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:39,607
Neil, don't!

998
01:11:39,642 --> 01:11:42,325
Get off of me!

999
01:11:42,361 --> 01:11:44,564
No! No!

1000
01:11:54,613 --> 01:11:56,717
I can't. I can't.

1001
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:07,081
Do it!

1002
01:12:09,264 --> 01:12:10,572
Tom!

1003
01:12:10,608 --> 01:12:12,811
Do it, Neil.

1004
01:12:12,846 --> 01:12:14,820
I can't!

1005
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:19,011
- No?
- I can't.

1006
01:12:20,301 --> 01:12:23,616
- Well, I can.
- No!

1007
01:12:23,659 --> 01:12:24,968
A life for a life.

1008
01:12:25,003 --> 01:12:27,075
Just one little number.

1009
01:12:30,441 --> 01:12:32,262
Do it, now. Do it, now.

1010
01:12:32,296 --> 01:12:34,084
- Tom!
- No!

1011
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,581
Now! Do it!

1012
01:12:38,982 --> 01:12:40,476
No!

1013
01:12:42,053 --> 01:12:47,037
- I'm sorry.
- No, Neil!

1014
01:12:48,003 --> 01:12:50,555
No.

1015
01:13:11,611 --> 01:13:14,545
Now you see? Huh?

1016
01:13:17,786 --> 01:13:19,378
How much he really loves you.

1017
01:13:22,072 --> 01:13:23,926
- You piece of shit!
- Tom!

1018
01:13:23,959 --> 01:13:25,714
You piece of shit!

1019
01:13:29,173 --> 01:13:32,020
- It was just--
- Just?

1020
01:13:32,052 --> 01:13:34,440
That's a great word, isn't it?

1021
01:13:34,484 --> 01:13:37,417
It was just one of those office things.
Just fooling around.

1022
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:39,498
Just an affair.

1023
01:13:39,538 --> 01:13:41,163
Just your cock in her mouth!

1024
01:13:42,737 --> 01:13:44,330
The mouth that kisses me
good-bye in the morning.

1025
01:13:44,368 --> 01:13:46,985
But hey! It's no big deal.

1026
01:13:47,024 --> 01:13:49,162
It's not a matter of life and death.

1027
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:53,289
But then, you tell me,
what the fuck ever is? Get up.

1028
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:57,121
Well, hmm, you're not
such a bad guy, Neil.

1029
01:13:57,164 --> 01:13:59,945
I mean, you go to work,
you go to the gym, you go home,

1030
01:13:59,979 --> 01:14:01,124
you pat your kid on the head.

1031
01:14:01,163 --> 01:14:02,853
You screw your wife.
Then you screw mine.

1032
01:14:02,891 --> 01:14:05,410
The end of a perfect day.

1033
01:14:11,624 --> 01:14:14,143
It wasn't her you were screwing,

1034
01:14:14,182 --> 01:14:16,549
Was it? No.

1035
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:18,785
It was me.

1036
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:21,340
Me you got inside.

1037
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:24,227
Huh? So, come on, Neil.

1038
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,680
Kiss me, huh? Come on, kiss me!

1039
01:14:28,257 --> 01:14:30,940
- Oh, you piece of shit!
- No!

1040
01:14:30,977 --> 01:14:34,010
Tom! No!

1041
01:14:34,048 --> 01:14:36,895
Please. Stop.

1042
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:41,114
Oh.

1043
01:14:43,004 --> 01:14:45,459
I will.

1044
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,580
I will.

1045
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,507
Please.

1046
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:15,949
Oh, God.

1047
01:15:37,259 --> 01:15:39,167
Where's my daughter?

1048
01:15:46,216 --> 01:15:48,288
She's at home, where she belongs.

1049
01:16:25,819 --> 01:16:26,898
What's going on?

1050
01:16:26,939 --> 01:16:28,345
Huh, baby? Are you all right?

1051
01:16:28,378 --> 01:16:30,035
We're getting out of here.

1052
01:16:30,074 --> 01:16:31,829
- Where is he?
- It's over.

1053
01:16:33,592 --> 01:16:38,511
- Please tell me what's going on, Neil.
- You were right.

1054
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:40,557
It was work.
He had a grudge against Karl.

1055
01:16:40,598 --> 01:16:44,393
- So, what was Judy doing in there?
- What?

1056
01:16:44,436 --> 01:16:46,061
I thought I saw Judy at the window!

1057
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,587
Look, I told you, didn't I?
OK, it was work.

1058
01:16:48,627 --> 01:16:50,731
Yes, but what was Judy doing there?

1059
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:52,297
Look, it's complicated!

1060
01:16:53,265 --> 01:16:56,613
This could cause a lot of trouble
for the company--

1061
01:16:56,656 --> 01:16:57,866
The company--Karl--

1062
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:58,984
Are you kidding me?
You've got to be--

1063
01:16:59,023 --> 01:17:04,204
- No, I'm not kidding!
- Just tell me what's going on, please.

1064
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:07,238
- You really want to know the truth?
- Yes.

1065
01:17:07,277 --> 01:17:10,342
- You want to know why he did it?
- Yes! Just tell me!

1066
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:24,450
It was me he was after.

1067
01:17:26,566 --> 01:17:27,842
Why?

1068
01:17:29,285 --> 01:17:32,001
He's Judy's husband.

1069
01:17:32,037 --> 01:17:33,313
And?

1070
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,671
She's been having an affair--

1071
01:17:42,562 --> 01:17:44,055
With Karl.

1072
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:49,082
Only that maniac
thought it was with me.

1073
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:52,565
Can you believe it?

1074
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:55,921
No, what matters right now is Sophie.

1075
01:17:55,965 --> 01:17:58,746
He said she's at home.
We just gotta get back.

1076
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:00,306
- Uh-huh.
- Make sure she's OK.

1077
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:02,680
- OK.
- Yeah. OK.

1078
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:08,047
What are you doing--
what are you doing?

1079
01:18:08,089 --> 01:18:10,324
- I need a cigarette.
- I'll get it--I'll get it.

1080
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:03,871
Look down here,
I'll check upstairs.

1081
01:19:15,587 --> 01:19:16,699
Sophie?

1082
01:19:18,722 --> 01:19:20,248
Sophie?

1083
01:19:25,631 --> 01:19:28,380
Sophie. Sophie.

1084
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:33,463
Oh, God, baby
come here, come here.

1085
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,474
Oh, baby.

1086
01:19:37,403 --> 01:19:38,483
Are you OK?

1087
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,083
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

1088
01:19:40,122 --> 01:19:41,529
Did she hurt you?

1089
01:19:41,562 --> 01:19:44,692
- What?
- The woman--who took you.

1090
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,228
- Did she hurt you?
- We played hide-and-go-seek.

1091
01:19:49,271 --> 01:19:52,270
Oh, come here, baby.

1092
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:54,415
Mommy and Daddy...

1093
01:19:54,453 --> 01:19:56,275
are going to be here for you now.

1094
01:19:56,309 --> 01:19:58,065
- OK.
- OK.

1095
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,212
OK.

1096
01:20:07,889 --> 01:20:09,481
Abby, she's fine.

1097
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:16,007
Abby?

1098
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:28,074
Abby?

1099
01:20:28,106 --> 01:20:29,535
I know.

1100
01:20:43,685 --> 01:20:44,863
I know.

1101
01:20:50,115 --> 01:20:51,707
Abby...

1102
01:20:53,634 --> 01:20:56,415
Baby. I never...

1103
01:20:58,177 --> 01:20:59,769
You know it.

1104
01:21:00,927 --> 01:21:03,512
Abby--

1105
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:06,778
Go on. Look me in the eyes
and lie to me again.

1106
01:21:06,814 --> 01:21:09,333
- Oh, no. Lying. I'm not lying--
- Tell me you love me.

1107
01:21:09,373 --> 01:21:14,041
I do love you, Abby.
Listen to me, Abby. OK?

1108
01:21:14,075 --> 01:21:17,238
You and I, we--we can
work this out together.

1109
01:21:17,274 --> 01:21:20,208
We can get through this
and I'll make it up to you.

1110
01:21:20,249 --> 01:21:23,892
But we--we almost lost
our daughter today.

1111
01:21:23,928 --> 01:21:26,644
And we have her back.
They took Sophie.

1112
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:28,466
- And we--
- Did they?

1113
01:21:31,062 --> 01:21:32,971
But you know--

1114
01:21:34,644 --> 01:21:36,204
Well, you know they did.

1115
01:21:36,244 --> 01:21:37,323
We're sorry.

1116
01:21:37,363 --> 01:21:39,250
Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

1117
01:21:39,283 --> 01:21:42,577
Please check the number
and dial again.

1118
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:44,431
We know it's just a game, honey.

1119
01:21:44,465 --> 01:21:47,049
OK, just do whatever
the lady says, all right?

1120
01:21:51,726 --> 01:21:53,514
Oh, Neil.

1121
01:21:55,693 --> 01:21:57,580
She never left the house.

1122
01:22:06,537 --> 01:22:11,009
She had a nice day--
with a lovely sitter.

1123
01:22:12,456 --> 01:22:14,724
I made sure that I got the best.

1124
01:22:14,758 --> 01:22:16,645
Only the best.

1125
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:18,532
You set me up.

1126
01:22:18,565 --> 01:22:21,085
You set me up from the start.

1127
01:22:21,124 --> 01:22:23,033
Little old me.

1128
01:22:24,324 --> 01:22:25,752
Can you believe it?

1129
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:31,392
And you...

1130
01:22:31,426 --> 01:22:33,149
And you put me through all of that?

1131
01:22:33,185 --> 01:22:34,362
How about this, Neil?

1132
01:22:34,401 --> 01:22:38,709
How about weeks and months of knowing
you're not good enough? Try that!

1133
01:22:40,798 --> 01:22:42,074
Abby!

1134
01:22:43,357 --> 01:22:46,073
It didn't mean anything!

1135
01:22:46,109 --> 01:22:49,620
- You gotta believe me.
- I do believe you.

1136
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:52,342
I believe you.

1137
01:22:52,379 --> 01:22:55,061
But it meant something to me.

1138
01:22:55,098 --> 01:22:56,820
And it meant something to him.

1139
01:22:56,857 --> 01:22:59,223
Enough that you
would let him destroy

1140
01:22:59,257 --> 01:23:01,296
every cent we've worked for?

1141
01:23:01,335 --> 01:23:02,829
No, Neil. Not every cent.

1142
01:23:14,931 --> 01:23:19,686
- So, you just ruined my career.
- Did I?

1143
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:21,289
Yes, I saw you do that one, Abby.

1144
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:23,336
And what did you see, Neil?

1145
01:23:34,605 --> 01:23:36,131
None of it happened.

1146
01:23:36,172 --> 01:23:38,692
- So you got it?
- Yeah.

1147
01:23:38,731 --> 01:23:40,159
Quite a performance.

1148
01:23:50,631 --> 01:23:52,517
I found you out, Neil.

1149
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:54,459
Just like I did in Denver.

1150
01:23:57,893 --> 01:24:00,609
I have been in so much pain.

1151
01:24:02,723 --> 01:24:04,632
Do you know how that feels?

1152
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:12,320
Watching you sleep at night,
watching you dream.

1153
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:15,924
And knowing that
she watches you, too.

1154
01:24:22,716 --> 01:24:24,145
I'm done.

1155
01:24:25,595 --> 01:24:27,983
I get you. I understand you.

1156
01:24:29,722 --> 01:24:31,063
But I don't want you.

1157
01:24:33,912 --> 01:24:35,472
Look, you still have everything.

1158
01:24:35,512 --> 01:24:38,162
You still have your house,
you still have your career,

1159
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,148
you'll always have Sophie.

1160
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:41,524
Everything's exactly as it was.

1161
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:46,381
Except for one thing.

1162
01:24:47,892 --> 01:24:50,128
Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?

1163
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:54,215
I do, Neil.

1164
01:24:58,512 --> 01:25:02,635
I just wanted to share those feelings
with you, if only for a few hours.

1165
01:25:02,671 --> 01:25:06,467
Despair, loss,

1166
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:09,705
abandonment,

1167
01:25:09,741 --> 01:25:11,017
betrayal.

1168
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:14,916
Are they there, Neil?

1169
01:25:17,674 --> 01:25:19,266
Are they, baby?

1170
01:25:22,793 --> 01:25:24,385
Are they?
