1
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,590
-Your shoulder flaring?
-No.

2
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:39,864
-You winced.
-I didn't wince.

3
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,552
You grimaced.

4
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,984
My shoulder doesn't hurt, Gus.

5
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:52,626
How long has it been hurting?

6
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:58,984
Perry wants me to start tomorrow.

7
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,026
You got to be kidding.

8
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:07,342
You're not doing it. No way.
It's the end of a shitty season.

9
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:10,742
-I'm gonna talk to Perry.
-Sit down.

10
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:12,829
Relax.

11
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:19,031
It's a throwaway, Billy. It means nothing.

12
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,192
Not to the Red Sox.

13
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:27,382
If I see you wince even one time....

14
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,223
Oh, God.

15
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:35,187
I've got the ugliest wife in the league.

16
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,663
That hurts. It hurt my feeling.

17
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,310
Buckle your seat belt.

18
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:58,908
Are we expecting Ms. Aubrey this evening?

19
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:00,663
We are.

20
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:04,153
-What name am I registered under?
-Mike Nelson.

21
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:07,391
-The Sea Hunt fellow, you know.
-All right.

22
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:12,146
Tell the desk that I don't want to talk
to anybody except her, all right?

23
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:14,072
Fitch, tonight...

24
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,829
...everything has to be perfect.

25
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:19,350
Have I ever let you down, Mr. Chapel?

26
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:51,706
This is Mr. Chapel.
Have there been any messages?

27
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:53,702
No?

28
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:56,903
Thanks.

29
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:19,512
This is Jane. Leave a message
and I'll get back to you. Thanks. 'Bye.

30
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:23,307
Jane, it's Billy. I'm worried now, so...

31
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:25,148
...please call.

32
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,547
Are you there?

33
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,586
Jesus. I've been banging out here forever.

34
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:38,105
What the hell happened to you?

35
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:41,944
You weren't at the gym.

36
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:45,790
-Is Jane here?
-No.

37
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:51,588
Jesus.

38
00:07:57,274 --> 00:08:00,310
Chap, a lot of little bottles
makes a big bottle.

39
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:02,346
That could be her.

40
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:06,790
-You got to throw today.
-Gus, do me a favor.

41
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,353
Get the door.

42
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:14,389
Throw some water on your hair.
It might look like you took a shower.

43
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:22,913
No, not at all.
He's in the bathroom back there.

44
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:30,550
-Mr. Wheeler.
-Good morning, Billy. Got a minute?

45
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:32,993
Yeah, sure.

46
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:36,865
Not easy to get up here.

47
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:40,831
-They treat me right.
-They didn't have you on the register.

48
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:43,826
I can't remember all your names.
Price of fame, huh?

49
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:48,230
-Can I get you something?
-No.

50
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:50,592
Let's just sit.

51
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:56,426
It's been a rough season.

52
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:01,750
-Always next year.
-Not for me.

53
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:05,902
It's one of those secrets everybody knows.

54
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,984
What you don't know is it's official.

55
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,272
Billy, I sold the Tigers.

56
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:22,427
Well, that's great.

57
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:23,828
Is it?

58
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:33,226
You've been the heart and soul
of this team.

59
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,113
Like family.

60
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:40,590
All the negotiations,
the bastards never said a word.

61
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:45,148
Said what?

62
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:50,110
They want to trade you to the Giants.

63
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:08,230
-Is that why you're here?
-No.

64
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:11,230
I don't know how to say this.

65
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:15,067
You know, I've been watching you
for 18 years.

66
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,461
Nothing...

67
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:20,389
...nothing has given me more pleasure.

68
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,826
You're like the old boys.

69
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:24,427
They were golden.

70
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:26,985
They had that special pride.

71
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,144
When they were done, they were done.

72
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,504
Nobody had to show them the door.

73
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:41,153
-Are you saying I should retire?
-Why not?

74
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:46,552
It wouldn't hurt the negotiations,
and it'd serve those sons of bitches right.

75
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:54,990
I don't know what to say.

76
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,714
You can't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

77
00:10:57,793 --> 00:11:00,182
And you've been smart with money, right?

78
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:02,269
Right?

79
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,066
I've always been a Tiger.

80
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:11,513
I know, son.

81
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:14,504
That's why this is killing me.

82
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:21,392
You know, my dad bought this team
when I was seven.

83
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:24,184
I grew up watching the Tigers.

84
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:28,229
I was gonna leave the team to my kids,
but they don't even like baseball.

85
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,144
Everything's changed, Billy.

86
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:33,988
The players, the fans,
TV rights and arbitrations.

87
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:37,187
It isn't the same. The game stinks, and l...

88
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:40,583
...l can't be a part of it anymore.

89
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,666
Billy, you want me to....

90
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:02,230
Hello? Jane.

91
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:04,386
Where are you?

92
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:06,706
You're downstairs?

93
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:11,032
Just stay where you're at.
I'm on my way down.

94
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,183
What do you want me to tell them?

95
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:16,270
I need more time.

96
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,144
The game doesn't stink, Mr. Wheeler.

97
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,427
It's a great game.

98
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,792
Billy, what's up?

99
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:43,062
I tried to get her in a cab, Mr. Chapel,
but she said she wanted to...

100
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,110
...just go and walk in Central Park.

101
00:12:45,193 --> 00:12:47,105
Go easy on our boys today, Billy.

102
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:15,831
Jane, why didn't you wait?

103
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:19,432
Are you crying?

104
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,342
What's the matter?

105
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,312
They didn't have any Kleenex
in the hotel bathroom.

106
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:33,831
What's going on, Jane?

107
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:37,150
I've been sitting in the lobby
for the last two hours.

108
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:39,232
Doing what?

109
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:43,429
I'm sorry I didn't call last night.

110
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,630
I could tell that you were worried--

111
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:49,070
If something's wrong, just say it, Jane.
I mean, we don't....

112
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,625
We never had to fake it.

113
00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:57,307
I'm leaving.

114
00:13:57,874 --> 00:13:59,546
I'm going to London.

115
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,102
London?

116
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,470
There's a job. A good job.

117
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,625
An editor's position.

118
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:17,144
I've been trying to figure out a way
to tell you but everything sounds so....

119
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:20,621
What can I say?

120
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,505
Tell me what to say.

121
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:29,105
I can't tell you, Billy.

122
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:32,908
It's all right.

123
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:34,913
I knew it...

124
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:37,823
...the day I met you five years ago.

125
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,462
-You knew what?
-You don't need me.

126
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:47,591
You and the ball and the diamond,
you're perfect. A perfectly beautiful thing.

127
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,746
You can win or lose the game
all by yourself.

128
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:55,988
I'm sorry.

129
00:14:57,754 --> 00:14:59,232
I'm so sorry.

130
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:03,422
Have dinner tonight with me
after the game.

131
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:08,546
-We'll go to Mario's.
-I have a 6:00 plane.

132
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,907
They wanted me there a week ago
when you called, and I wanted to see you.

133
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:17,105
I wanted to say good-bye.

134
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:20,951
Good-bye, Billy.

135
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,472
Welcome to New York
and to Yankee Stadium...

136
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,307
...on a crisp and glorious fall afternoon...

137
00:15:56,953 --> 00:16:01,027
...where the Yankees try to win
the divisional title against the Tigers.

138
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,346
Hi, everybody. I'm Vin Scully,
along with Steve Lyons...

139
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,426
...and welcome to our final telecast
of the regular season.

140
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:09,865
You can smell the fall.

141
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:12,751
The World Series isjust around the corner.

142
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:20,513
Mr. Chapel?

143
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:27,830
Ken Strout. I was your batboy
a long time ago.

144
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:29,985
My dad was a Tiger.

145
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,113
Joe Strout.

146
00:16:34,274 --> 00:16:35,548
I remember.

147
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:37,708
How's he doing?

148
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:41,706
Good. He and Ma are living in Florida.
He doesn't move around too easy, though.

149
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,831
He's got bad knees.
You know, a little arthritis.

150
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,625
-You playing today?
-Don't think so. They just called me up.

151
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,830
Good. Well, good luck to you.

152
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:55,431
Give your dad my best.
He was a great player.

153
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:57,750
Thanks. I'll tell him.

154
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:10,228
Live from Yankee Stadium in New York,
it's New York Yankees baseball.

155
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:12,749
Today, on the next to last day of the year...

156
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,347
...the Yankees have a chance
to clinch the pennant.

157
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,993
To do it they'll have to beat
Billy Chapel and the--

158
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:20,269
-Excuse me.
-Good afternoon, everyone.

159
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,992
Excuse me.
Could you turn that off, please?

160
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:25,991
-The Yankees are set to clinch it.
-No.

161
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:29,863
But standing in their way is the great
veteran right-hander of the Tigers....

162
00:17:29,953 --> 00:17:31,147
...Billy Chapel.

163
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:33,705
Does anybody else know?

164
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:38,510
Nobody knows nothing. Not even Perry.

165
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:42,027
If they knew,
that's all they'd be talking about.

166
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,152
What does Jane say?

167
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,832
Jane's moving to London.

168
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:53,750
Moving to London? What the....

169
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:57,431
-How are you gonna manage that?
-We're not.

170
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:05,746
This ain't your day.

171
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:11,872
What are you gonna do?

172
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:16,313
I don't know.

173
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:22,352
That's Wheeler's nephew.

174
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:26,509
He sent him down to get your answer.

175
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:30,384
Guess he's gonna sit
through the whole game if he has to.

176
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:32,032
Poor kid.

177
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,587
He doesn't even know
what he's doing here.

178
00:19:12,473 --> 00:19:15,510
Throw the ball to the glove, son.
Just play catch.

179
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:28,788
Since you're throwing bullets,
I won't mention you were an hour late...

180
00:19:28,874 --> 00:19:32,946
...and I've been trying to figure out who
my pitcher would be if you didn't show up.

181
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,625
Have I ever not showed?

182
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:39,471
I mean, in 19 years,
have I ever not showed?

183
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,824
That's true of everyone
till the first time they don't show.

184
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:47,547
Billy, I had an idea.

185
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:51,501
I've pretty much made up my mind,
but I wanted to run it by you first.

186
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:53,505
I want Jimmy to catch today.

187
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:55,825
I know how you feel about Gus but...

188
00:19:55,913 --> 00:19:58,711
...he ain't hitting.
He ain't hit for a while now.

189
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:06,752
I haven't said anything
but we need the left-handed bat.

190
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:07,903
I want Gus.

191
00:20:07,993 --> 00:20:11,144
I know. And I'd love to take
one of these goddamn games.

192
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:15,506
We're not laying down. We're not gonna
be a red carpet to the Series for them.

193
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:18,903
Gus catches or I don't pitch.

194
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,428
Me and Gus.

195
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:23,113
Nobody else.

196
00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:26,626
I hope you hear me.

197
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,825
Are you telling me how to run this team?

198
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:31,108
No. But today...

199
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:35,903
...it's me and Gus.
I've never asked you any other time, okay?

200
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,229
Good.

201
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:41,028
Glad you agree. Can't argue about this
right now. Got to warm up.

202
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,348
I'm sorry. We have a bit of a delay.

203
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:49,663
We're correcting a bit
of a maintenance problem.

204
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:51,949
So we don't have a bit of a crash?

205
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:54,984
Is there someplace I can stay?

206
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:57,792
The Premier Lounge is down there
on your right.

207
00:20:58,153 --> 00:20:59,303
Thanks.

208
00:20:59,913 --> 00:21:03,111
As the sun goes down,
it'll be an easier time to hit for both teams.

209
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:05,344
And now talking about shadows
and sunlight...

210
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,584
...that might very well sum up Billy Chapel.

211
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:10,313
Long has he stood
in the brilliant sunshine...

212
00:21:10,513 --> 00:21:12,549
...in his great 19-year career...

213
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:16,229
...but now, battling back
from an 8 and 11 record this year...

214
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:19,863
...trying to find his way out
of the shadows, back into the sunlight.

215
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:23,105
He'll be facing Mike Robinson,
followed by Jonathan Warble...

216
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:24,547
...and then Sam Tuttle.

217
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:27,865
Bottom of the first inning,
no score, and the Yankees coming up.

218
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,551
What's he looking at?

219
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,512
He's looking...

220
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,146
...at the clouds.

221
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:58,833
You okay, Chap?

222
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:02,862
You okay?

223
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:11,905
Catching, Number 27...

224
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:15,228
...Gus Sinski. Number 27.

225
00:22:16,114 --> 00:22:18,150
At shortstop, Number 7....

226
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:21,623
-Trying to take my hand off?
-Sorry.

227
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:24,951
Just let me set for that juice.
Warn me or something.

228
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,346
I'm gonna throw a little harder
than usual today.

229
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:30,307
There's your warning.

230
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,867
Chap, don't throw it away too early.

231
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:37,625
Today I'm throwing hard.

232
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:41,749
You and me? One more time?

233
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:45,702
Why not?

234
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:00,269
We got you, Chapel! You're done!

235
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:04,383
We're gonna stick a fork in you!
You're finished!

236
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:09,750
The Tigers are done! You're done!
You're finished!

237
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:10,823
Get out of town!

238
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,942
I can always tell when I'm in New York.

239
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:20,667
You suck!

240
00:23:22,074 --> 00:23:23,632
You stink on ice!

241
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:26,069
You couldn't pitch a tent!

242
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:41,352
Clear the mechanism.

243
00:23:52,594 --> 00:23:53,946
Hello, Mike.

244
00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:00,144
Strike one!

245
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:08,147
Chapel working on Robinson.
Bottom of the first inning, no score.

246
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:14,432
And there's a little looper to José Garcia.
One away.

247
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:18,103
This is my lucky day. How are you?

248
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:20,230
Fine. What'll you have?

249
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,546
The Bud on tap is good.

250
00:24:22,874 --> 00:24:26,344
This is a beautiful day
for the big ballpark in the Bronx.

251
00:24:33,594 --> 00:24:36,313
Two solid years,
and now a third with the Yankees.

252
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:37,906
Pretty good breaking ball.

253
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:41,191
A lot of guys would be upset
about missing their flight...

254
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:44,310
...delay this and that
but this works out beautiful for me.

255
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:48,028
Chapel trying to derail the Yankees...

256
00:24:48,273 --> 00:24:50,741
...and the Yankees trying to end a season...

257
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:53,472
...that has long been finished by Detroit.

258
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,509
They pushed this guy up
to pitch this game...

259
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:08,269
...so basically we clinch today
and I get to see it. Beautiful.

260
00:25:11,874 --> 00:25:14,342
-What can I get for you?
-Chivas and water.

261
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:16,511
Here we go.

262
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:19,586
Everything is.... Look at that. It's early.

263
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,625
You got nuts, chips?

264
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:25,864
-Got those pretzels.
-I can make do.

265
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:27,228
Thank you.

266
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:31,108
Good fastball with some movement on it.

267
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:34,266
-Down goes Warble.
-He swung at that? He's got nothing now.

268
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:38,344
If I was Boston, I'd be worried
that they were throwing the game.

269
00:25:39,753 --> 00:25:43,269
This guy used to be a monster.
When he first came up, unhittable.

270
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:46,148
Now he's a junker.

271
00:25:46,794 --> 00:25:49,626
...three years in a row.
In baseball circles we all know...

272
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:53,593
...there's no love lost between these two.
They don't like each other too much.

273
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:58,393
At third base, Number 13, Sam Tuttle.

274
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:02,032
Sam Tuttle.

275
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:06,351
I can't think of a better reason
not to be a Yankee.

276
00:26:07,394 --> 00:26:09,782
Sam Tuttle hit .625.

277
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:12,428
He went 5 for 8 against Chapel this year.

278
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:15,506
-That would make me not like a guy.
-I would think so.

279
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,392
Fastball on the inside corner. Strike one.

280
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,267
Wasn't that inside?

281
00:26:40,273 --> 00:26:42,913
Never do swing at the first pitch,
do you, Sam?

282
00:26:50,513 --> 00:26:52,788
No. We're off the page now, Gus.

283
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,144
This is between me and Ugly.

284
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:57,346
Straight heat.

285
00:26:58,193 --> 00:26:59,512
Thatta boy.

286
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,587
-Strike two!
-That shit's outside.

287
00:27:05,953 --> 00:27:09,469
No wonder nobody likes you.
Everything's a goddamn debate.

288
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:12,704
Fastball, and it runs right on
that outside corner.

289
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:15,583
So 0 and 2 the count to Sam Tuttle.

290
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:19,027
I saw that shitty little Hollywood movie
you did.

291
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:28,749
-Ball!
-Sinski wanted that one.

292
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,909
So did Chap.
You see the reaction on his face.

293
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:33,984
That's a good pitch on the outside corner.

294
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:37,827
Tuttle didn't like the first two calls,
and now he gets a break on that one.

295
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:42,624
That's not the kind ofpitch that Chapel's
gonna like being called a ball all day long.

296
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:48,665
Don't crowd me, Sam.

297
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,551
I hate being crowded.

298
00:27:55,953 --> 00:27:59,344
One and two the count, and Tuttle
has really moved up on the plate.

299
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:01,470
He's all over the plate now.

300
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,986
Now you got the idea.

301
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:17,227
Down goes Tuttle.
What a knockdown pitch that was.

302
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:19,349
There's a message being delivered.

303
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,503
Yankee Stadium is like a schoolyard...

304
00:28:21,594 --> 00:28:24,869
...and Bill Murdie looks like a teacher
who sees trouble.

305
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:30,390
They say in every great athlete there's
a mean streak and Chapel's no different....

306
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:33,553
Bill Murdie goes from umpire to referee.

307
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:38,471
When I played against this guy,
if he had good stuff he'd flip you like this.

308
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:40,710
He'd throw a ball right over your head...

309
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:43,786
...just to let you know,
"I can throw the ball anywhere I want. "

310
00:28:43,874 --> 00:28:46,342
You know,
I've been a Yankee fan since 1958.

311
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:49,102
I can name a Yankee for every number.

312
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:51,105
Oh, God. Please don't.

313
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:53,630
Number One: Billy Martin,
Bobby Richardson.

314
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:57,388
Two: Frank "The Crow" Crosetti
and Bobby Murcer.

315
00:28:57,554 --> 00:28:59,545
Three: The Babe. Four: Gehrig.

316
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:01,743
-Five: DiMaggio. Six--
-Excuse me.

317
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:04,472
-Steve Boyer, Roy White.
-Would you mind?

318
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:09,943
You can't smoke in a bar.
What, now you can't talk in a bar?

319
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,832
This ain't church, lady.

320
00:29:12,273 --> 00:29:14,741
-Tuttle back up to the plate.
-Two and two!

321
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:16,984
Same shit, different day?

322
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:20,663
I'd throw it at you again,
but I'm afraid Murdie'd run me.

323
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:28,622
-Strike three!
-Good breaking ball.

324
00:29:28,913 --> 00:29:32,030
-Got him looking.
-Greatjob setting up the hitter.

325
00:29:32,953 --> 00:29:35,387
Tuttle looks like a deer
caught in the headlights.

326
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,987
Chapeljelly-legged him.

327
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:40,145
So at the end of one,
Tigers nothing, Yankees nothing.

328
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:43,982
Here we go now. Four, five, six.
Let's get something started.

329
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:47,550
José, atta-baby. It's all about positioning.

330
00:29:48,993 --> 00:29:50,665
You got to wait on this guy.

331
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:53,790
-Mike, can I have some water?
-Sure thing, Billy.

332
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:55,268
You all right?

333
00:29:58,993 --> 00:30:00,984
You got it going good out there.

334
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,111
Make sure you save something.

335
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,943
Birch wants to play golf tomorrow.

336
00:30:15,993 --> 00:30:18,986
You know, I played golf with Birch
the day I met Jane.

337
00:30:20,673 --> 00:30:22,346
You doing all right?

338
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:29,028
I'm not hearing them at all out there.

339
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:01,746
Yeah, that'll fix it.

340
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:31,912
I don't need any help.

341
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:38,545
I can see that. I can see you got your car
kicked completely into submission.

342
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:40,465
I mean it. Just go away.

343
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:44,823
I can always tell when I'm in New York.

344
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,423
Do you really know anything about cars?

345
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:00,306
-Want me to have a look at it?
-Okay.

346
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:02,827
It's not mine. It's just a trashy rental.

347
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:05,782
Yeah. Mine, too.

348
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:14,034
Try the key, see if we can't get it started.

349
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:21,143
I should've paid attention in auto shop.

350
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:37,589
-What did you do?
-Well, I was....

351
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:40,633
I have no idea. I don't....

352
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:45,631
I don't know anything about cars.
I was just trying to be manly.

353
00:32:46,074 --> 00:32:48,872
That was great, thank you.
You saved my day.

354
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:50,426
'Course I did.

355
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:52,472
I said I would.

356
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:55,353
Where you headed?

357
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:56,981
I'm not sure.

358
00:32:57,953 --> 00:32:59,147
Bear Mountain, maybe.

359
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:02,782
I just threw my stuff in the car
and took off. Had to get out of the city.

360
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:05,547
-How come?
-'Cause summer's over and I missed it.

361
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:09,711
I work all the time. It makes me feel old.
I don't know.

362
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,385
Thanks again.

363
00:33:24,673 --> 00:33:27,586
-What's the problem?
-My problem seems to be solved.

364
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,423
Oh, no.

365
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:31,664
Wait a sec. The car's fine.

366
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:35,627
Listen, honey. I gave up on four calls
hauling my ass out to you.

367
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:39,269
That's $100 to me,
so if nothing's wrong with this car now...

368
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:41,948
...there will be when I bring it down
to the city.

369
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:44,832
-Everything all right?
-Everything's peaches, mac.

370
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:54,673
You're Billy Chapel.

371
00:33:54,753 --> 00:33:57,393
I can't believe it.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

372
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:58,987
I can't believe this.

373
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,107
I'm sorry.

374
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:05,992
You're the greatest freaking ballplayer
out there.

375
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:08,065
I'm sorry. But you really are.

376
00:34:08,273 --> 00:34:11,391
I'm gonna go get that.
You stay right here, okay?

377
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,586
Billy Chapel.

378
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:18,228
Nice to meet you. Jane Aubrey.

379
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:22,384
You know, I got this problem.

380
00:34:23,914 --> 00:34:26,711
I'd like to keep talking with you
but I got to...

381
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:28,313
...go to work.

382
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:33,032
Just a sec.

383
00:34:35,193 --> 00:34:37,070
I'll get there when I get there.

384
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:39,065
-Can you do me a favor?
-Anything.

385
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:42,304
We got a bum deal on this rental here,
so if you could...

386
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:46,030
...if you could haul this back to town for us,
I'd really appreciate it.

387
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:47,706
I can't take that.

388
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:50,302
Wait a second. What are you doing?

389
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:53,351
-You like baseball?
-What?

390
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:55,429
-Baseball.
-No, not really.

391
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:58,547
-You ever been?
-No.

392
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:00,472
Would you like to go?

393
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:05,833
Would you like to go
to a baseball game with me?

394
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:08,309
If she don't want to go, I'll go.

395
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:11,911
Don't let that happen.

396
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:34,112
Lady, you can't just stand
in the middle like that.

397
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:36,949
-Sorry.
-Let me see your ticket.

398
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:40,266
You're with the players' wives. Follow me.

399
00:35:47,114 --> 00:35:48,262
Thanks.

400
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:49,708
Excuse me.

401
00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:51,588
Sorry.

402
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:58,467
-Who are you here with, honey?
-Billy Chapel.

403
00:35:59,153 --> 00:36:00,507
How nice.

404
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:05,626
This week's blonde.

405
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:17,384
No, stay. You're cool.
Trust me. I've been there.

406
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,664
-I'm Kisha Birch.
-Hi.

407
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:24,146
-Jane Aubrey. Nice to meet you.
-Strike three!

408
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:35,505
-You got a ball?
-Yeah.

409
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:46,625
You don't lose much, do you?

410
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:48,985
I lose. I've lost.

411
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:54,670
About 134 times.

412
00:36:57,034 --> 00:36:59,389
That's over 15 years, okay?

413
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,547
You count them?

414
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:07,465
We count everything in baseball.
I mean, God, that's all we do.

415
00:37:09,273 --> 00:37:11,309
All right, quit stalling.

416
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:12,789
What?

417
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:15,871
You haven't told me anything about you.
Nothing.

418
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:21,224
I figured if I kept my mouth shut
I could pass for elegant and mysterious.

419
00:37:21,713 --> 00:37:23,864
You're forgetting I saw you
on the highway...

420
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:26,228
...kicking the hell out of your car.

421
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:32,702
-Where are you from?
-Oh, God.

422
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:37,427
Three questions.

423
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:40,070
Syracuse, New York. That's one.

424
00:37:44,994 --> 00:37:46,791
What are the pads for?

425
00:37:47,313 --> 00:37:50,510
This one is my article on lip gloss
for Elle magazine...

426
00:37:50,793 --> 00:37:53,706
...this one is on skin peels,
and my grocery list.

427
00:37:57,434 --> 00:37:58,867
Last question.

428
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,744
How do you like to be kissed?

429
00:38:12,153 --> 00:38:14,543
You know, I've always thought...

430
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,905
...that men and women
should just carry around signs.

431
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:21,590
If you're poor and you can't afford it
you would make yours out of...

432
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:26,304
...cardboard and string. And if you're rich,
you could have it lettered in gold leaf...

433
00:38:26,393 --> 00:38:29,545
...pounded out of tin by Mexican craftsmen,
it doesn't matter...

434
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:31,864
...but you wear them around your neck.

435
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:36,266
And they say things
like "shallow" or "horny."

436
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,947
It just would be a hell of a lot easier.

437
00:38:42,313 --> 00:38:44,032
What would yours say?

438
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,782
-Isn't this your floor?
-I think so.

439
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:16,585
We've been here twice before.

440
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:34,786
Good morning.

441
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:39,228
Got to go.

442
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:43,905
Sleep as long as you want.
You can take a shower, anything you want.

443
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:46,952
Nobody'll bother you
till you take the sign off the door.

444
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:48,467
Okay. Thanks.

445
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:51,625
What's this? A souvenir?

446
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,266
It's my number.

447
00:39:57,954 --> 00:39:59,672
You don't have to give me this.

448
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:01,983
I know I don't have to do this, but...

449
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,547
...l wanted to.

450
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:13,266
-When will you be back?
-I already checked.

451
00:40:13,753 --> 00:40:16,826
Four weeks from Thursday
I'll be back in New York, so...

452
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:20,106
...that Thursday night...

453
00:40:20,673 --> 00:40:23,507
...meet me in the bar downstairs
at 10:00, okay?

454
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,784
I'll be there waiting for you.

455
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:32,110
If you don't show up, if you leave me
standing in that bar, it'll ruin this.

456
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,186
Well, then I guess I'll just have to show up.

457
00:40:35,353 --> 00:40:36,833
I'm serious.

458
00:40:38,114 --> 00:40:40,070
I'll be there, Jane, okay?

459
00:40:41,353 --> 00:40:43,025
Okay, Billy Chapel.

460
00:41:05,873 --> 00:41:10,311
Birch, baby! Kiss that bitch good-bye!
Take it over!

461
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,186
Clear the mechanism.

462
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:29,905
You look old, Davis.

463
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:33,067
Are we that old?

464
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:44,152
And the fastball sinks at the knees,
and the count 0 and 1.

465
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:46,425
Don't smile at me, Davis. I hate that.

466
00:41:46,514 --> 00:41:49,186
It was a sad day in Detroit
when Gary Wheeler...

467
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,983
...the owner of the Tigers
and a somewhat beleaguered franchise...

468
00:41:53,074 --> 00:41:56,190
...was forced to trade Davis Birch,
who was a free agent.

469
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,226
Detroit could not come up
with his monetary demands.

470
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:02,943
The Yankees were waiting
with open arms and an open wallet.

471
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:05,311
It was your team, too.

472
00:42:07,353 --> 00:42:09,184
How much money we got to make?

473
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:11,186
You want to see my team?

474
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:16,393
-That's my team over there.
-You got it. I'll be out in a second, okay?

475
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,992
Billy, are you gonna just sit there
and mope or are you gonna help?

476
00:42:26,954 --> 00:42:28,864
I ain't carrying no books.

477
00:42:28,994 --> 00:42:30,666
Where's the pillows?

478
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,784
You're the best, kiddo.

479
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:41,827
The best around. The worthy opponent.

480
00:42:45,393 --> 00:42:49,103
The 0-1 pitch, and the bottom
just drops out of it. Strike two.

481
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:51,628
Look at Birch staring out at Chapel saying:

482
00:42:51,713 --> 00:42:55,150
"Where's that curveball coming from?
He never had that before. "

483
00:43:02,434 --> 00:43:05,744
It don't happen that often,
but I got you mixed up, don't l?

484
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:10,864
You're guessing now, aren't you?

485
00:43:12,954 --> 00:43:14,592
Here's your fastball...

486
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:19,869
...right down the pipe so you don't leave
thinking I was afraid to give it to you.

487
00:43:21,713 --> 00:43:22,782
Strike!

488
00:43:22,873 --> 00:43:26,230
Fastball runs on the inside corner.
Strike three called.

489
00:43:27,554 --> 00:43:29,067
I could've hit that.

490
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:32,668
Billy Chapel all business,
taking care of Birch on three pitches.

491
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:34,704
Kenny Howell will follow.

492
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:40,746
Ifyou don't show up, ifyou leave me
standing in that bar, it'll ruin this.

493
00:43:58,753 --> 00:44:00,266
Cab, Mr. Chapel?

494
00:44:05,193 --> 00:44:06,512
You leaving?

495
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:10,067
I was supposed to meet someone,
but they....

496
00:44:10,873 --> 00:44:13,103
I'm sorry. I wasn't gonna come.

497
00:44:13,514 --> 00:44:17,826
I sat in my apartment waiting till the time
when I was not gonna show up here...

498
00:44:18,273 --> 00:44:19,992
...and then I just....

499
00:44:20,753 --> 00:44:22,027
Oh, God.

500
00:44:24,193 --> 00:44:25,592
Billy Chapel.

501
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:28,668
Why do you always use both my names?

502
00:44:29,074 --> 00:44:30,951
So I know what I'm up against.

503
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:34,992
I had a great time with you last month.
It's not that. Don't get me wrong.

504
00:44:35,074 --> 00:44:37,143
It's just that....

505
00:44:37,793 --> 00:44:40,865
I don't mean to sound
like anything or anything....

506
00:44:41,954 --> 00:44:43,909
I don't do that.

507
00:44:44,554 --> 00:44:46,226
-I won't say anything about it.
-What?

508
00:44:46,313 --> 00:44:49,545
-I just don't do it, not since college.
-What don't you do?

509
00:44:50,914 --> 00:44:52,869
-I think I should go home.
-Why?

510
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:55,864
Because I just don't screw like that!

511
00:44:57,634 --> 00:44:59,032
And I hate that word.

512
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:02,072
-You want the cab, Mr. Chapel?
-Give it to somebody else.

513
00:45:02,153 --> 00:45:05,543
I don't go to hotel rooms
with men I don't know.

514
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,514
-I can't be a groupie.
-You're not a groupie.

515
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:12,347
You don't look like one or act like one.
I didn't treat you like one.

516
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:19,153
-Wasn't I a gentleman?
-Yes, I know.

517
00:45:19,393 --> 00:45:25,708
You pull up out of nowhere, start my car
make me laugh and the next thing I know...

518
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:30,311
...l'm at a baseball game that you win!
I mean, it's so surreal.

519
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:34,472
Little boys buy cards
with your picture on them.

520
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,269
They buy those for the gum.

521
00:45:40,793 --> 00:45:43,387
-Goddamn it!
-What?

522
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:46,507
Goddamn what?

523
00:45:47,673 --> 00:45:48,992
I like you.

524
00:45:51,193 --> 00:45:52,945
So what's the problem?

525
00:45:53,273 --> 00:45:56,346
I'm really not at all
the person you think I am.

526
00:45:56,833 --> 00:46:01,510
And I think it would just be more fair
for both of us for me to just leave.

527
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:07,547
Forget it.

528
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:13,143
What's the difference? I mean....

529
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:17,826
Give me the thing.

530
00:46:18,393 --> 00:46:22,864
What's the difference between
the real you and this other you?

531
00:46:23,434 --> 00:46:24,992
The real me is....

532
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:30,034
The real me is plain, uninteresting...

533
00:46:31,114 --> 00:46:34,663
...and hates sexy underwear
because it's really uncomfortable.

534
00:46:39,153 --> 00:46:41,110
The real you is a bummer.

535
00:46:41,193 --> 00:46:44,425
This can't be what you were looking for
from this evening.

536
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:47,070
Be totally honest with me.

537
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,068
That day I fixed your car, I got lucky.

538
00:46:51,114 --> 00:46:53,264
Maybe you got lucky, too.

539
00:46:55,514 --> 00:46:58,027
I know we don't know each other so well...

540
00:46:58,114 --> 00:47:00,833
...but that's what I was hoping.

541
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:04,393
I mean, we don't have to....
We could like....

542
00:47:05,273 --> 00:47:08,505
Like walk, I mean.... We could just walk.

543
00:47:09,474 --> 00:47:10,543
Walk?

544
00:47:12,514 --> 00:47:13,947
I could walk.

545
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:19,903
We don't have to talk so much either.

546
00:47:45,954 --> 00:47:47,512
Border collie.

547
00:47:49,514 --> 00:47:51,391
My dad loved the blue heelers.

548
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:53,152
Is he still alive?

549
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,630
No, they're both gone.

550
00:47:56,753 --> 00:47:59,313
Him first, and then her within a year.

551
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:04,025
He was a good man.

552
00:48:04,594 --> 00:48:06,789
Very tall. Very reserved.

553
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:10,063
Passionately in love with two things:

554
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,148
My mother and baseball.

555
00:48:14,554 --> 00:48:16,431
Then he was a lucky man.

556
00:48:30,753 --> 00:48:33,826
How do we do this?
How does this work, Billy?

557
00:48:34,554 --> 00:48:37,943
I told you, I have to be here next month
for a couple of days.

558
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:41,067
-I want to see you.
-Okay.

559
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:50,224
When you're away...

560
00:48:50,313 --> 00:48:53,623
...l'll live my life and you'll live yours.

561
00:48:53,994 --> 00:48:57,509
And none of this stupid, bullshit,
why-didn't-you-call-me crap.

562
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:01,990
And what you do when you're not with me
has nothing to do with me, and vice versa.

563
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:03,586
No questions asked.

564
00:49:03,713 --> 00:49:05,670
No worrying.

565
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,505
No obsessing.

566
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:12,351
That sounded perfect.

567
00:49:14,753 --> 00:49:16,425
-Good night.
-Good night.

568
00:49:46,994 --> 00:49:49,063
My back keeps breaking out.

569
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:51,391
Candy says it's gross.

570
00:49:52,153 --> 00:49:53,586
Use the loofah.

571
00:49:54,914 --> 00:49:56,108
The what?

572
00:49:57,074 --> 00:49:59,065
The loofah. It exfoliates.

573
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:02,864
You're losing it over this girl.

574
00:50:07,914 --> 00:50:09,824
I met this woman in New York.

575
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:13,105
I'm thinking of asking her down.

576
00:50:14,434 --> 00:50:17,231
-Call her.
-No, it's not....

577
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:19,072
It's casual.

578
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:23,911
I've seen her a few times over the winter
in New York when I happened to be there.

579
00:50:25,514 --> 00:50:26,742
Call her.

580
00:50:35,193 --> 00:50:36,182
Hello?

581
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:40,503
I'm having this problem with my skin peel.

582
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:44,347
-I was just thinking about you.
-What were you thinking?

583
00:50:44,634 --> 00:50:47,864
I was wondering when you play
your first series against the Yankees.

584
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:50,148
-Come down here.
-What?

585
00:50:50,793 --> 00:50:53,387
Come spend the weekend.
Meet my friends.

586
00:50:53,554 --> 00:50:55,112
I don't know, Billy.

587
00:50:55,434 --> 00:50:57,503
What do you mean, you don't know?

588
00:50:58,114 --> 00:51:02,471
I've got a ton of work to do,
and I can't afford to be running off--

589
00:51:02,554 --> 00:51:04,623
-So I'll pay.
-No.

590
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:07,626
It's not that.

591
00:51:09,514 --> 00:51:12,027
We made the rules.
I think we should stick to them.

592
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:14,713
There's no rules about having fun.
That's bullshit.

593
00:51:14,793 --> 00:51:16,306
Why is it bullshit?

594
00:51:16,434 --> 00:51:20,188
Because if you just want to have fun,
come down here 'cause this is fun.

595
00:51:20,954 --> 00:51:23,184
You know who sat
in the bleachers last Sunday?

596
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:24,262
Who?

597
00:51:25,273 --> 00:51:26,342
Sandy Koufax.

598
00:51:26,954 --> 00:51:28,228
You are such--

599
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:31,588
You are like the ultimate guy.

600
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:32,822
You don't like guys?

601
00:51:32,914 --> 00:51:36,030
I need a regular guy,
not the guy on the Old Spice commercial.

602
00:51:36,114 --> 00:51:38,070
-It was Right Guard.
-What?

603
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:41,983
It was Right Guard, that commercial.

604
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:44,505
I was being metaphorical, Billy.

605
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:48,152
Look, this is crazy.
What am I supposed to do?

606
00:51:48,353 --> 00:51:50,992
I'm supposed to run down there
and meet Sandy Koufax...

607
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,793
...get his autograph
and sleep with Mr. Right Guard?

608
00:51:54,393 --> 00:51:56,862
-What are you so afraid of?
-I'm not afraid.

609
00:51:58,873 --> 00:52:00,387
I can't be a groupie.

610
00:52:02,393 --> 00:52:04,907
That's the second time
you used that word to me...

611
00:52:04,994 --> 00:52:07,871
...and it didn't really
go down that well the first time.

612
00:52:07,954 --> 00:52:09,023
Now you're mad.

613
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:10,592
No, I'm not mad. I'm just...

614
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:13,391
-...pissed off.
-That's not fair.

615
00:52:13,474 --> 00:52:15,543
-I'm gonna hang up now.
-Let's start from--

616
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:16,862
I'll call you another time.

617
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:21,550
-No. When will you call me?
-When I don't feel like killing you.

618
00:52:27,713 --> 00:52:29,032
I told her.

619
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,509
I haven't seen you around much lately.

620
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:36,992
I've been working hard.

621
00:52:38,793 --> 00:52:41,148
All work and no play....

622
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:10,032
All I've got is my toothbrush
and a bathing suit I bought at the airport.

623
00:53:13,434 --> 00:53:15,072
You're not smiling.

624
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:17,869
You're annoyed. I'm an idiot.

625
00:53:18,313 --> 00:53:19,985
No, I'm an idiot.

626
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:22,472
Jane, listen to me.

627
00:53:22,554 --> 00:53:25,351
No matter what happens
in the next five minutes...

628
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:29,630
...l want you to know
that when I opened this door...

629
00:53:30,514 --> 00:53:33,391
...l was so happy to see you
that my heart leapt.

630
00:53:34,554 --> 00:53:36,670
It leapt in my chest.

631
00:53:41,634 --> 00:53:43,704
Billy, can I borrow your...

632
00:53:44,634 --> 00:53:45,952
...blow dryer?

633
00:53:56,793 --> 00:53:58,021
Don't go.

634
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:04,581
It's not your....

635
00:54:07,353 --> 00:54:10,744
I have terrible timing. I've always had it.

636
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:15,903
That's why I failed at acting
and skiing and table tennis.

637
00:54:16,393 --> 00:54:21,309
I should have known when the only flight
to Lauderdale was at 6:10 a.m...

638
00:54:22,153 --> 00:54:25,782
...and the only rental car I could get
was this ridiculous Lincoln.

639
00:54:25,873 --> 00:54:27,670
The car is perfect.

640
00:54:27,994 --> 00:54:29,143
It's perfect.

641
00:54:29,994 --> 00:54:31,188
That girl....

642
00:54:31,594 --> 00:54:36,907
Don't explain. I'm not angry or hurt.
We're not anything. You're fine.

643
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:39,389
-You can do whatever you want.
-I know I can....

644
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:42,431
-I don't want her.
-Then what is she doing here?

645
00:54:43,954 --> 00:54:46,514
I like her. She's my masseuse.

646
00:54:52,634 --> 00:54:55,626
It's never quite how you play it
in your head.

647
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,985
What about the whole deal thing?

648
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:01,668
What deal?

649
00:55:01,873 --> 00:55:04,706
You know, you do what you do,
I do what I do.

650
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:07,103
You believed that? I was lying.

651
00:55:07,313 --> 00:55:08,871
I was trying to be the man.

652
00:55:08,954 --> 00:55:13,027
And I was doing a damn good job of it
until you invited me down here.

653
00:55:16,074 --> 00:55:17,302
You were right.

654
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,382
I was afraid.

655
00:55:21,994 --> 00:55:25,588
I was afraid you were gonna break
my heart into 1,000 pieces.

656
00:55:27,514 --> 00:55:29,072
I'm sorry. Jane.

657
00:55:36,273 --> 00:55:38,389
I've been thinking about you, Jane.

658
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:42,702
I don't know what I was.... That was a....

659
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:48,067
All right, tell me what I can say
so you'll believe me.

660
00:55:48,153 --> 00:55:49,347
I believe you.

661
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,833
Then stay.

662
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:57,306
-Please, Jane. I want you to stay.
-This can only end bloody for me, Billy.

663
00:55:59,434 --> 00:56:02,152
I saved the sign. You know the "yes" sign?

664
00:56:02,434 --> 00:56:05,505
I pinned it on the wall in my locker.
Goddamn it!

665
00:56:07,074 --> 00:56:08,507
It was stupid!

666
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,106
Strike three called.

667
00:56:13,353 --> 00:56:14,503
On the corner.

668
00:56:16,434 --> 00:56:18,311
-Strike!
-Fastball, got him looking.

669
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:20,702
That's strikeout number five
for Billy Chapel...

670
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:22,784
...and he is really on a roll now.

671
00:56:22,873 --> 00:56:25,990
Franklin, obviously annoyed
at what he thinks is a bad call...

672
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:28,588
...is muttering as he goes up
the first base line.

673
00:56:28,673 --> 00:56:32,507
Bill Murdie showing some patience,
but right back at him, ready to bite.

674
00:56:32,793 --> 00:56:36,911
Here's that pitch again. It looked like
it was in the heart of the strike zone.

675
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:39,952
It's a little surprising
that Franklin was so annoyed.

676
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:44,186
And it looks like for Bill Murdie,
the pot is about ready to boil over.

677
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:48,862
A dominant inning for Billy Chapel,
striking out the side.

678
00:56:55,994 --> 00:56:57,393
You're in the zone.

679
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:59,347
-Number 24.
-Feels good.

680
00:56:59,434 --> 00:57:03,222
Here's Mickey Hart, 0 for 1.
No score, fourth inning.

681
00:57:03,393 --> 00:57:06,943
Jack Spellman doing well.
Has allowed only two hits to the Tigers...

682
00:57:07,034 --> 00:57:10,184
...and meanwhile,
Billy Chapel in perfect control.

683
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:14,224
Mickey'll be gone next year, too.

684
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:17,793
Poor guy. Never could get a break.

685
00:57:21,713 --> 00:57:24,989
Where was that catch he missed?
The one that hit him?

686
00:57:25,554 --> 00:57:28,068
They still play that on Diamond Vision
all the time....

687
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,827
"There goes another rubber tree plant."

688
00:57:36,434 --> 00:57:37,583
Fenway.

689
00:58:00,074 --> 00:58:02,110
Everything's all right, man.

690
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:10,873
Guess that looked pretty funny
out there today?

691
00:58:13,554 --> 00:58:15,784
Probably end up on ESPN or something.

692
00:58:15,914 --> 00:58:19,190
Lot of shit ends up on ESPN
I don't think is very funny, Mick.

693
00:58:19,273 --> 00:58:21,070
Phone call, Mr. Chapel.

694
00:58:22,434 --> 00:58:25,903
There's a bunch of cameras out there,
waiting to make a joke of this.

695
00:58:25,994 --> 00:58:29,782
You can either stop,
give them the sound bite, do the dance...

696
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:34,349
...or you hold your head up and walk by,
and the next time we're in Boston...

697
00:58:34,434 --> 00:58:37,471
...we'll go out there
and we'll work the wall together.

698
00:58:38,634 --> 00:58:40,943
Don't help them make a joke out of you.

699
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,992
Old school, baby. He's right.

700
00:58:50,313 --> 00:58:51,463
-Chapel.
-It's Jane.

701
00:58:51,554 --> 00:58:53,545
I got your number from the front office.

702
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:56,228
-I hope that it's okay.
-No, that's all right.

703
00:58:56,313 --> 00:58:58,748
Don't worry about it. What's wrong?

704
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:02,269
Something's happened.
It's my daughter. She ran away.

705
00:59:02,753 --> 00:59:05,268
-Your daughter?
-I don't have time to tell you now.

706
00:59:05,353 --> 00:59:07,663
But she's there in Boston.
Her father lives there.

707
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,063
-Oh, God. We had a fight and she--
-All right.

708
00:59:10,153 --> 00:59:13,112
Jane, just slow down, all right?
Just slow down.

709
00:59:13,193 --> 00:59:16,106
She climbed down the fire escape
and went to Penn Station...

710
00:59:16,193 --> 00:59:18,867
...got on a train to go to her father,
but he's not there.

711
00:59:18,954 --> 00:59:20,592
What's the address?

712
00:59:20,994 --> 00:59:24,144
-8245 Clackton.
-What's her name?

713
00:59:24,634 --> 00:59:26,465
-Freedom.
-Freedom?

714
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:29,786
Scared you, didn't l?
Heather. It's Heather.

715
00:59:46,114 --> 00:59:47,467
It's okay.

716
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:50,672
I'm the guy your mom said
was coming to get you.

717
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:58,552
Let's get out of here before we get
our asses kicked twice in one night.

718
01:00:06,554 --> 01:00:07,873
You're Heather.

719
01:00:08,793 --> 01:00:10,750
And you're the baseball player.

720
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:18,349
My mom can do nothing normal.

721
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:35,708
Shut up.

722
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,032
Do you want something?

723
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:47,507
I'll have a V-8.

724
01:00:48,994 --> 01:00:51,632
What is it with single men and V-8 Juice?

725
01:00:52,313 --> 01:00:55,510
I mean, my dad's fridge has nothing
but mustard in it...

726
01:00:55,594 --> 01:00:57,789
...but when I come to visit,
it has mustard...

727
01:00:57,873 --> 01:01:01,309
...fish sticks, and this big jug of V-8 Juice.

728
01:01:01,393 --> 01:01:05,706
Like, if he makes me choke down a glass,
he's being healthy and fatherly.

729
01:01:08,554 --> 01:01:10,943
I like V-8. It's...

730
01:01:12,313 --> 01:01:13,632
...nutritious.

731
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:22,990
Are you my mom's boyfriend?

732
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,952
I'm not sure.

733
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:29,469
But you've slept with her.

734
01:01:36,873 --> 01:01:40,070
V-8. It's a refreshing blend of eight...

735
01:01:40,514 --> 01:01:42,106
...vegetable juices.

736
01:01:53,554 --> 01:01:55,987
What did you and your mother fight about?

737
01:02:02,673 --> 01:02:06,030
I didn't come home from school
when I was supposed to...

738
01:02:06,594 --> 01:02:08,869
...because I was with Mark Elton and...

739
01:02:10,114 --> 01:02:15,108
...she freaked out because he has
facial hair and his parents are never home.

740
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:19,509
And I said, "We didn't do anything."
And she said, "You could have."

741
01:02:20,193 --> 01:02:22,867
I said, "Well, I might love him."

742
01:02:23,514 --> 01:02:25,744
And she said,
"You don't know what love is."

743
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:27,983
And I said,
"I'm gonna do what I want to do."

744
01:02:28,074 --> 01:02:30,507
And she said, "Not in this house."

745
01:02:32,474 --> 01:02:34,704
So I went to my dad's because...

746
01:02:36,554 --> 01:02:38,510
...he doesn't care what I do...

747
01:02:39,434 --> 01:02:42,027
...'cause he's stoned 90 percent of the time.

748
01:02:50,594 --> 01:02:52,027
She doesn't...

749
01:02:53,114 --> 01:02:57,266
...want me to make the same mistakes
that she did.

750
01:02:57,873 --> 01:03:00,262
I mean, she had me when she was 16.

751
01:03:02,673 --> 01:03:04,186
She never had...

752
01:03:05,193 --> 01:03:06,592
...a love story.

753
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:12,505
And now she doesn't believe in it.

754
01:03:28,393 --> 01:03:30,954
-Honey, I'm so sorry.
-I'm sorry, too.

755
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:38,867
Thank you.

756
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:43,708
Come up.

757
01:03:48,713 --> 01:03:51,148
-Don't ever do that again, okay?
-Okay.

758
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:54,431
We can always work it out, all right?
Just talk to me.
