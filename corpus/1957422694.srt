1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,270
Whoops, sorry.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,620
Oh, geeze.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,910
What's this one called?

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,610
I lost my (indistinct).

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,620
Ridiculous.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,250
(group laughs)

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,460
We're healthy, but
we're desperately unhappy.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,660
Right, okay.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,930
Orlando, are you going to do it?

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,290
I guess. Oh yeah.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,600
We must do our exercises.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,980
Oh shoot.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,270
What's this called?

14
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,940
Stretching the muscles.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,430
Stretching the muscles, okay great.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,140
Oh yeah, this is good,
really important.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,240
Now you have to sit down again, sorry.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, sorry, Helen,
you got to go back down.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,910
I gotta sit down?

20
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,320
- Yes.
- I just got up.

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,000
Could you just say your
name and how old you are?

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,300
Ziggy Susser 71.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,800
Barbara Bova 72, soon to be 73.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,800
My name's Alix Elias.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,720
And Richard Marshall.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,100
She tells, she says to me-

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,060
- Don't tell your age.

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,970
Don't tell anybody.

29
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,180
Don't tell your age.

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,930
Tom Padovano 66.

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,900
Helaine Witt.

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,810
My age? 71.

33
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,360
- [Jo] 71.
- And a half.

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,690
- Oh?
- In the few months.

35
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,280
Like a kindergartner.

36
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,160
You could say, generally speaking.

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,120
Yeah, generally speaking.

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,410
Generally speaking, a hundred.

39
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,360
My name is Evana Lewis
and I am 73 years old.

40
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,040
My name is Teresa Hommel and I'm 76.

41
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,420
And you are, you're wearing a mask.

42
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,920
I'm wearing three masks.

43
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,920
Hi, I'm Helen Yalof and
I am, ew, 86 years old.

44
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,970
My name is Nicki Cochrane.

45
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,760
My date of birth is May 10th, 1938.

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,100
My name is Bill Burke
and I'm 68 years old.

47
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,190
Will you tell me your
name and if you want to,

48
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,090
you could tell me how old you are.

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
(laughs)

50
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,320
I'm Rebecca Dole, I'm 75.

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm Orlando Dole, not 75.

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,450
Lynne Fetch, I will be 71.

53
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,370
And I'm still playing singles.

54
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,870
How do you like them apples?

55
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,870
Oh, I'm Bibi Elvers.

56
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,000
And am I comfortable saying my age?

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,670
Of course, I'm proud of it.

58
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,870
I'm 88 and a half and going strong.

59
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,630
So this is pretty much like

60
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,930
the comedy workshop we do on Zoom

61
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,680
but it's going to be in person.

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,640
And we're gonna do some
exercises to get material going

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,850
and then we'll do a show in four days.

64
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,730
No big deal.

65
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,730
We're going to do a quick
just a roundup of ideas

66
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,070
for what's the worst thing
to have on a T-shirt?

67
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,030
- Bill.
- Cream cheese.

68
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,410
I love me, not you.

69
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,030
A naked baby on a
T-shirt trying to wee wee.

70
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,540
What? A naked baby on
a T-shirt trying to shoot?

71
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,170
Holding his little
wee-wee. (Laughs)

72
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,920
[Jo] Yeah, that's a really bad T-shirt.

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,920
I saw this T-shirt yesterday

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,620
Eat pussy, it's organic.

75
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,180
I couldn't hear. What was it?

76
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,890
Eat pussy, it's organic.

77
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,760
Eat what?

78
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,310
[Group] Pussy.

79
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,770
Come on Barbara, make her say it again.

80
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,640
(group laughs)

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,510
Everybody make her say it again.

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,610
[Jo] Did you have you done like

83
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,690
- performing arts or anything?
- No.

84
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,030
So, what got you to
sign up for the class?

85
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,740
Oh, I saw that and I said right away,

86
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,410
"I just, I would love to do that".

87
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,950
And you've never done it before?

88
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,660
No. In elementary school
I was always the one

89
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,630
who like laughed and said funny things.

90
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,870
Got in trouble for
laughing all the time.

91
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,840
Once the teacher wrote "giggles"

92
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,880
on my report card or whatever.

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,180
So, what do you like
about the comedy class?

94
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,140
I just like that we're all together.

95
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,810
We all contribute.

96
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,310
It's just fantastic.

97
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,360
Sometimes I am so awed by
the answers that people give.

98
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,400
Really, they're fantastic.

99
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,740
I love those bar jokes, oh God.

100
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,900
Who do you think would
play you in a movie?

101
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,070
(laughs) Oh, you know
who just came into my mind?

102
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,120
I don't know if it was
because I thought of it

103
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,070
or I just got it, Sandra Bullock.

104
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,750
She funny?

105
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,710
So what does everybody
prefer if you had the choice

106
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,130
food jokes or sex jokes?

107
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,760
- Food, did you say food?
- Yeah.

108
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,890
- Food.
- Okay.

109
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,760
- Sex.
- [Jo] Okay.

110
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,130
- Food,
- Food.

111
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,100
Sex.

112
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,060
[Jo] Orlando, you have not voted.

113
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,140
No, I go for sex jokes.

114
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,310
Barbara, you got one?

115
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,110
I got one a quick one

116
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,820
and then I need help with the second.

117
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,110
Two peanuts were in a
bar, one was a salted.

118
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,240
- One was a what?
- A salted.

119
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,150
- Two penises?
- Peanuts. Peanuts.

120
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,110
So, the other one is that
if you get lox in the morning,

121
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,080
a pop will freeze you at night.

122
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,420
Soda pop lox bagel in the
morning freezer pop at night.

123
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,430
I told you it needs work.

124
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,220
[Jo] (laughs) Okay.

125
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,260
Well. Anybody has
any anything to add

126
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,020
about bagels and lox or freezer pops?

127
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,060
Oh well, I said, "I tried to
push it up, to get the lip

128
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,440
"but it went back down".

129
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,650
Oh that is good.

130
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,650
That's how it's supposed to be.

131
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,650
Whoa.

132
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,360
The cook made a cheeseburger.

133
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,150
I told him, "I
needed a hamburger."

134
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,360
And he said, "Do something
with the cheeseburger."

135
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,700
So, I threw it at him.

136
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,240
Is that a glad to
see me in your pocket?

137
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,120
Making sex on a Sunday is a bad choice.

138
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,120
Sex makes my hair curly.

139
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,530
A good pastrami sandwich
is as good as an orgasm.

140
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,460
I worked for a few jobs,

141
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,380
but my biggest, longest
job was a social security.

142
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,800
I was a claims representative.

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,180
I interviewed people to
see if they qualified

144
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,510
for like an SSI program,
things like that.

145
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,720
And the best, the best
story I have from work is

146
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,270
that I interviewed a woman
who told me she worked

147
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,690
at a Whole Foods and I said,

148
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,520
"I used to go to the
one on Houston Street.

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,020
I loved their bread pudding."

150
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,610
And she said, "Oh my God, I
made their bread pudding".

151
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,280
35 years at work and that's
the most exciting thing

152
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,780
that ever happened to me.

153
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,490
Meeting a person who makes
bread pudding at a Whole Foods.

154
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,160
Why did you decide to
take this comedy class?

155
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,200
I've always been funny,
like my whole life kind of,

156
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,540
but you know, never formally funny.

157
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,080
I would always crack people up,

158
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,210
make jokes with friends or
whatnot, but I never pursued it.

159
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,420
Like I thought of it, but
I was too scared, you know.

160
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,590
Like you really have to
give up a lot to pursue it,

161
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,510
to really make a career
of it and everything.

162
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,600
I used to have a dream to
end up on TV, you know,

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,180
like the big thing, you know,

164
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,020
to be on the "Tonight Show"

165
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,800
blah, blah, blah.

166
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,190
Umm, now I know that
it'll never happen.

167
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,900
You know, it it it's a fulfillment.

168
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,940
It's part of me that
I can tap into now.

169
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,990
And it's great that I have
that opportunity to do it.

170
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,990
Alix, you got one?

171
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,200
Is it food or sex?

172
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,660
Well, I was trying to do both,

173
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,790
but tomatoes having sex equals ketchup.

174
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,040
[group Laughs]

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,500
Let's see, Lynn, you got one?

176
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,170
Is this okay from when
Mayor Lindsay was mayor?

177
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,670
That's when I heard it.

178
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,880
I do have an encyclopedic
memory for jokes.

179
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,800
Something will trigger it off

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,430
and it's just in the
back in the Rolodex.

181
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,590
So, do you know what joke about a cat?

182
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,310
The one about the little boy
goes to school and he's late.

183
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,860
So, the teacher says,
"Why are you late?"

184
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,690
He says, "I stopped
to look at a dead cat

185
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,530
by the side of the road".

186
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,860
She said, "Well, how'd,
you know, it was dead?".

187
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,410
He says, "I pissed in its
ear and it didn't move".

188
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,780
"You did what?"

189
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,910
"You know, I went psst
and it didn't move".

190
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,200
Dinosaurs.

191
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,870
Two dinosaurs were
on the edge of a cliff

192
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,250
and they see Noah's Ark sailing
away with all the animals.

193
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,120
So, one says to the other,
"Oh, is that today?".

194
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,550
Can you tell me the
dirtiest joke, you've heard?

195
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,050
The man goes to the doctor
for his annual physical.

196
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,310
And he says, "You know, you
have to stop masturbating".

197
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,560
He goes, "Why?".

198
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,770
He says, "Cause I'm
trying to examine you.".

199
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,180
(Jo Laughs)

200
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,900
- 30 wow.
- Wow.

201
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,310
For other ways to describe dog feces.

202
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,580
Poodle noodles.

203
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,700
[Jo] (laughs) Poodle noodles.

204
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,200
Oh that's cute.

205
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,540
Digestive ex-cremation.

206
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,420
Pet extrusions?

207
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,540
What to smell?

208
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,590
Autumn color display.

209
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,510
Think of something.

210
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,300
Doggie gift?

211
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,680
Doggie do do do.

212
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,050
We met as children.

213
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,510
- I was 12 and he was like 15.
- 35.

214
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,560
(all laugh)

215
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,140
Our fathers were friends.

216
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,980
Our fathers were friends
in college for God's sake.

217
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,690
In college.

218
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,940
Isn't that crazy?

219
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,150
So, we both ended up being actors.

220
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,860
And Richard found out
through his father.

221
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,320
My father called me and said,

222
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,660
"Alix Elias is coming to
New York to be an actress".

223
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,780
Anyway we ended up
briefly dating at the time.

224
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,450
Which was broken up
by my evil roommate.

225
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,450
I won't tell that story.

226
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,290
Don't tell that story.

227
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,830
Bad story.

228
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,460
So, then we didn't see each
other for about 25 or 30 years.

229
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,090
And then we ran into each
other at Jefferson Market.

230
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,380
Jefferson Market.

231
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,090
And then so, he sneaked up behind me

232
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,260
in line and goosed me and I was so mad.

233
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,090
She wouldn't talk to me.

234
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:29,970
What is goosing?

235
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,100
Well, we were standing in line

236
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,890
and she wouldn't talk
to me I went plbh.

237
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,640
And the next day we ran
into each other on 5th Avenue,

238
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,930
- right near where I live.
- Right.

239
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,640
And he burst into tears.

240
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,690
He was sobbing on 5th Avenue.

241
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,860
So, we have not been separated since.

242
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,240
It was kind of like...

243
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,820
And everyday I sob.

244
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,240
It's like, same thing, you know?

245
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,200
She likes it and I don't care.

246
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,160
[Jo] Who here's single?

247
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,040
Single.

248
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Who here's married?

249
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,830
We're married.

250
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,670
I'm married but I'm kind of single.

251
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,210
(Alix laughs).

252
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,960
Anyone have observations

253
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,010
about being single or being married?

254
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,920
What it's like?

255
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,130
Yeah what is being single like?

256
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,050
It's you look at
these guys and you say,

257
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,800
"Do I want a Anthony
Hopkins type or do you want

258
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,270
a Harry Styles type?"

259
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,560
My father used to say,
"I've been happily married

260
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,650
for 30 years. 30
out of 50 ain't bad."

261
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,980
Any other observations

262
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,360
about being married or being single?

263
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,860
What it's like?

264
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,410
Well, I was never any good
at dating or anything like that

265
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,450
so I just um you know.

266
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,080
(phone ringing)

267
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,660
[Jo] I think we have
somebody's cell phone ringing.

268
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,120
We have music here, coming?

269
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,000
I hear that.

270
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,790
Is that me?

271
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,040
I think it's a hearing aid.

272
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,420
[Jo] No, I think it's
a cell phone, maybe.

273
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,290
Oh, I hear it now.

274
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,130
[Jo] We have a popular crowd.

275
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,750
Rebecca.

276
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,260
Who would you say laughs
more between the two of you?

277
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,380
I do.

278
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,430
(all laugh)

279
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,100
No sense of humor.

280
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,180
That's what she's always
laughing at everything.

281
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,890
Becky, there's nothing
to laugh about, you know.

282
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,180
(Rebecca and Orlando laugh)

283
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,520
Do you remember your first date?

284
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,020
No. She needed
someone to fix her...

285
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,280
Handyman to fix her-A loft bed.

286
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
A loft bed.

287
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,030
You know, eventually he fixed it.

288
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,530
And he told me a joke
and it made me laugh.

289
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,490
And that's when I fell
in love with him.(laughs)

290
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,120
Do you remember the joke?

291
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,910
He said, you know, "Was
I still doing acting?"

292
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,210
And I said, "Yeah, sometimes."

293
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,380
And he said, "Well, you
know, I go to auditions,

294
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,130
"but you know, they say,
you know, you're too tall,

295
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,840
"you're too short, you're
too fat, you're too thin.

296
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,010
"But what they really
mean is you're too old."

297
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:34,720
(Jo laughs)

298
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,170
I started laughing.

299
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,550
We looked into each other's
eyes and that was it.

300
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,100
I'm just going to say words.

301
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,730
And you just say whether
it's funny or not funny.

302
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,520
By itself, okay?

303
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,020
Ready?

304
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,940
Peanuts.

305
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,520
- [Group] Funny.
- And salt.

306
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,700
Okay, how about treadmills?

307
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,330
Not at all.

308
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,700
Very serious.

309
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,080
Gerbils?

310
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,000
- Definitely funny.
- Gerbils?

311
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,210
[Jo] Gerbils are funny?

312
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,330
With Richard Gere.

313
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,880
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

314
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,340
How about band-aids?

315
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,340
I loved them when I was a kid.

316
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,220
I used to put them on all
the time, I loved them.

317
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,970
Really did.

318
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,500
And they were hilarious.

319
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,550
Pumpkins?

320
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,430
I don't think so.

321
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,520
Pumpkin's are not funny?

322
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,190
- Neutral.
- Pumpkins are neutral.

323
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,980
Neutral, yeah.

324
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,230
Okay what about ghosts?

325
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,400
- Goats?
- Yes.

326
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,560
- Goats.
- Ghosts.

327
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,730
- Goats.
- Oh the greatest of all time.

328
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,530
No, no ghosts.

329
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,740
Goats G-O-A-T-S?

330
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,650
No ghosts.

331
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,700
Goats are funny.

332
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,030
Honey, have you seen my goat?

333
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,780
Okay, how about milk.

334
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,190
Is milk funny?

335
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,740
Milk is white.

336
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,040
I think what we're
going to do right now is

337
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,710
now, that you have your pen and paper,

338
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,840
you're gonna write down
three to five things

339
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,750
that you think about every day.

340
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,260
Tequila, do you have a list of
things you're thinking about?

341
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,760
Do I get up now?

342
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,050
Then do I go to the
diet app on my phone?

343
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,350
And the only other
thing I can think of is

344
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,310
do I kill those roaches
with a sponge or my hand?

345
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,890
(group moans)

346
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,110
So, you are, you are
still working as a reporter?

347
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,690
- Yep.
- And a photographer?

348
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,030
Yeah, I am.

349
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,150
It's important to note that you are,

350
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,450
I would say somewhat New York famous.

351
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,700
- No.
- [Jo] Yes.

352
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,700
- No.
- Yes.

353
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,530
In a very small circle.

354
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,080
A very minute.

355
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,700
My dog Walker said, "You
know, Tequila Minsky?"

356
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,870
But she doesn't know me.

357
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,870
She just saw my byline.

358
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,420
That's fame.

359
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,880
(Tequila laughs)

360
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,370
You're famous.

361
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,090
Renown, but not quite famous.

362
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,040
Do you have a plan for the show?

363
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,550
You know gripes.

364
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,750
You have gripes?

365
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,510
Is my name Tequila Minsky?

366
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,730
Well, life is a performance,
but to be on this stage.

367
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,940
This is the stage?

368
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,070
I don't, the performing
doesn't bother me.

369
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,030
It's like the material,
having good material,

370
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,240
my own good material that's
what makes me extremely anxious.

371
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,120
Barbara what are your
things you think about?

372
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,130
I have walk Morgan, study,
monkey yo-yo on YouTube,

373
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,800
I love him and his
family. Eating food

374
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,880
and feeling only good.

375
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,680
Okay, how about you Nicki?

376
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,050
Every day I watch the
colossal failure of our world

377
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,180
become more and more irreparable.

378
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,690
Every day, I wonder
why ignorance rather

379
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,240
than its opposite is on the increase.

380
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,610
Every day, I lose all hope for mankind.

381
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,160
Wow.

382
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,610
Every day, I wonder when the
world, as we know it, will end.

383
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,790
Thank you, Nicki.

384
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,830
Thank you.

385
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,660
(group laughs)

386
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,070
Quite uplifting.

387
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,800
That's great, thank you.

388
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,670
I love comedy.

389
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,170
It is a true gift.

390
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,840
I think it's like taking
medicine for your health.

391
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,220
What's the end goal?

392
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,810
Do you want to make theater?

393
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,560
Do you want to make comedy?

394
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,020
I just want to learn.

395
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,640
I thrive on edification.

396
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,020
I have to learn a hundred
new things every day.

397
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,980
You had mentioned
that comedy is a gift.

398
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,860
Oh, absolute a gift.

399
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,320
I know now, I know it sounds strange

400
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,030
because I don't believe in rel...

401
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,530
I would like to abolish all
religions from the world

402
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,280
and all gender from the...

403
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,700
I think gender is such
a terrible concept

404
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,460
and it creates so much harm.

405
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,290
And you know, I dunno
this human impulse

406
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,500
to put us in boxes all the time.

407
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,130
Now the Nazis were famous for that.

408
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,930
By the way, I'm very, very
obsessed with the Holocaust.

409
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,050
You can't believe that
it actually happened.

410
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,470
You think that you're going to wake up

411
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,560
from this nightmare
that it never happened.

412
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,390
Germany hasn't learned anything.

413
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,770
Do you know what they're
doing in Germany, now?

414
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,190
Nicki, I just I think the question -

415
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,810
- They're wiping out
the hundred year old

416
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,980
thousand year old villages
to make way for coal mines.

417
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,360
It's awful.

418
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,610
But I think the question
was if comedy is a gift.

419
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,400
Oh yes it is, yes.

420
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,950
But I would like to be funny,
but not in an artificial way.

421
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,080
You know, genuinely funny.

422
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,000
I think that you are genuinely funny.

423
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,250
- You do?
- [Jo] Yeah.

424
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,790
- Really?
- [Jo] Yes.

425
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,130
You're the first person
who's ever told me that.

426
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,460
Ziggy, what are your five things?

427
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
Well, I'm obsessed with my bird.

428
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,380
So, where's the bird?

429
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,050
Look, I don't know where he is.

430
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,010
Does he have to poop?

431
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,890
Did he eat enough?

432
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,640
Does he want his head scratched?

433
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,480
You know, what's the bird doing?

434
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,480
[Jo] How do you get the bird to poop?

435
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,650
Well, I can tell
when he's about to poop

436
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,230
cause he starts to back up.

437
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,780
So, I put my finger under his...

438
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,110
This is true.

439
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,200
I put my finger under his stomach,

440
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,740
he goes on my finger

441
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,410
and I put him on the edge
of the little garbage pail.

442
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,700
And if he's facing the right way,

443
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,240
the poop falls in the garbage pail.

444
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,660
If he's not, it's outside.

445
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,870
But at least it's getting close.

446
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,370
That's fantastic.

447
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,250
You have such contact with such
a closeness with your bird.

448
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,460
Okay, Bibi, how bout you?

449
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,170
What are you things, you think about?

450
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,460
One of the things I think
about is what time is it?

451
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,010
"Where did I put" is a constant
thing, no matter what

452
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,510
because I'm a hoarder in my apartment.

453
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,640
It's beyond upside down.

454
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,850
I have stuff going
back to report cards.

455
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,940
Hair that was removed
from my head during

456
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,150
some surgery 30 years ago.

457
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,650
But I still have the hair.

458
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,030
When do you find yourself
looking for this stuff?

459
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,820
(Bibi laughs)

460
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,870
So what do you think you're
going to do for the show?

461
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,330
I thought I might bring

462
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,670
a very limited number of actual items

463
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,040
that I was telling you about.

464
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,300
My husband's knee bone

465
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,880
when he had his total knee replacement.

466
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,180
They're not supposed to give it to you,

467
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,180
but he was, he was one
who would never let go.

468
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,180
He was lots of fun.

469
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,350
He should be in this class.

470
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,480
Well, he died two years ago.

471
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,730
But other than that, he should be

472
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,110
in your comedy workshop.

473
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,440
What makes you laugh?

474
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,940
Oh, just about anything.

475
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,740
Because I love to see the
funny in things for myself.

476
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,860
Do you just kind of...

477
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,870
You just see humor in every day?

478
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,700
You know, you have to.

479
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,660
In some ways it's a survival strategy.

480
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,790
If you can't find humor
in life, that's very sad.

481
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,710
And you have been just great.

482
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,720
And I envy your grandparents
to have somebody, I'm serious.

483
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,930
There's no decades between us,

484
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,270
even though there should be.

485
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,940
But the decades don't
exist when you're here.

486
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,560
And there's so many things
you don't know about me.

487
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,940
Yeah?

488
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,610
Spent many, many years
working, on site, digging

489
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,740
for dinosaur bones and...
It's very serious stuff.

490
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,830
I understand, I just did not hear...

491
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,500
I didn't expect you to say that.

492
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,580
So what else, what else
do I not know about you?

493
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,630
Mammoth bones too.

494
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,750
In South Dakota, there is a huge place

495
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,710
with lots of mammoth bones.

496
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,050
So, what we're going to
do is we're going to break

497
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,390
for lunch pretty soon.

498
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,850
But what I want you to do is,

499
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,600
so you have an assignment
for this afternoon.

500
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,800
You have to write a three to
four line poem that rhymes.

501
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,690
On any subject?

502
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,110
On any subject.

503
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,940
It can be maybe inspired by
what we talked about today.

504
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,240
If you want to do it all

505
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,980
about grapefruits or
intercourse or gerbils

506
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,530
but a three to four line poem.

507
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,160
Gluten-free bagel,

508
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,620
anybody want half of
a gluten-free bagel?

509
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,460
I'll take half if you
don't want it, thank you.

510
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,880
And help yourself to
bagels or coffee or.

511
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,420
Oh, you want just an egg.

512
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,380
A ham sandwich walks into a bar

513
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,510
and the bartender says, "I'm
sorry, you can't come in here".

514
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,720
The sandwich says, "Why not?".

515
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,730
"Cause didn't you
see that sign on the door?

516
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,150
"We don't serve food".

517
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,810
(Jo laughs) Okay.

518
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,150
Thank you, Teresa.

519
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,860
Thank you for sharing that with me.

520
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,070
- Beautiful.
- But I didn't make it up.

521
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,360
It's okay.

522
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,490
But I did laugh for
at least 20 minutes.

523
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,200
- I'm very paranoid.
- I understand.

524
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,490
It's okay.

525
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,450
And I tape them because I don't want

526
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,360
any COVID sneaking in the side.

527
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,880
Okay. Great.

528
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,000
And what, what inspired you
to take the comedy class?

529
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,760
I'm ready to laugh.

530
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,380
So, you weren't ready to laugh until.

531
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,510
Well, I have, I was very serious.

532
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,350
You know, I was very
serious corporate trainer.

533
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,680
Until when?

534
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,730
Until the pandemic and
I didn't have any work.

535
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,190
Really?

536
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,520
You were very serious
until the pandemic.

537
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,940
Yeah.

538
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,360
And then I'm like, "Hey,
let's have more fun here".

539
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,450
And then you signed
up for a comedy class?

540
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,450
Immediately. Yes.

541
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,700
And do you think that you
have a goal with comedy?

542
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,160
You know, I think
people need to laugh more.

543
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,910
I think I need to laugh more.

544
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,250
I may be late, but it's not too late.

545
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,920
And this is veggie cream cheese?

546
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,840
Oh, this is plain cream cheese.

547
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,710
This is lactose free cream cheese.

548
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,220
You're more inspired
by Joan Rivers or...

549
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,510
- Yeah.
- Joan Rivers?

550
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,300
Yeah, because I used to
listen in the eighties

551
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,390
and channel her through me.

552
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,560
Like, I would think like her

553
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,100
and then I'd send jokes to
her because she had an album.

554
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,060
You'd send jokes to her?

555
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,140
She said them on Johnny Carson.

556
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
I have a video.

557
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,610
- Of her telling two of my jokes.
- Really?

558
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,860
One bomb, she said it three times.

559
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,570
In the eighties, there was
a song by Olivia Newton John.

560
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,030
Let's get physical, physical.

561
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,450
So, she comes out and she
goes, "Today is income tax day.

562
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,580
"And my accountant is dancing
around the office singing,

563
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,080
"Let's get fiscal
fiscal.", like fiscal year.

564
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,210
Let's get fiscal.

565
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,130
Let's get fiscal fiscal.

566
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,000
And then she said it again.

567
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,800
Let's get fiscal fiscal.

568
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,340
And then she said that the third time.

569
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,210
Let's get fiscal fiscal.

570
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,010
She was angry that they
weren't laughing loud enough.

571
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,270
More than that, she was
just singing it three times.

572
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,560
I thought it was gonna be a hot joke.

573
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,390
And what did you do before this?

574
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,400
Well, I'm a retired teacher.

575
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,270
And now I dabble in stand up comedy.

576
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,150
And what is your goal with comedy?

577
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,610
- You know what my goal is?
- What?

578
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,280
That I make people laugh.

579
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,910
What I want is just to be so funny.

580
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,000
So, you've done comedy
like for a long time.

581
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,920
What do you think was one of
the greatest days of your life?

582
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,130
Oh the day I got a pink
envelope from Joan Rivers.

583
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,300
That was a thrill.

584
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,630
What did it say?

585
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,840
These are the jokes
we're buying from you.

586
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,300
How much did you get paid per joke?

587
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,300
Only $10, but let me defend her.

588
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,890
Had to be brand new every day.

589
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,520
Should she give everybody so much money

590
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,390
for five or 10 minutes
worth of material?

591
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,900
How much money would
you pay for a joke?

592
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,020
Hmm. I don't
know, Jo that's...

593
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,900
You're asking me really
provocative challenging ques...

594
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,570
Larry King, you
shouldn't know from this.

595
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,860
You should really hear Jo.

596
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,240
These are, I don't know.

597
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,830
I don't know.

598
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,030
Rest in peace.

599
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,620
How would you like to be
in this head, Jo? (Laughs)

600
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,300
I've never eaten
yogurt with a fork before

601
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,620
but there's no spoon.

602
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,120
Let me get you a spoon.

603
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,550
Okay, so are we ready?

604
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,680
Evana, would you like
to share your poem?

605
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,760
Sure.

606
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,770
Standing in the dark shadow,

607
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,350
watching my reflection on the wall.

608
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,310
As I gazed on my shadow,

609
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,690
I thought, what a wonderful sight.

610
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,190
Maybe I imagined the reflection,

611
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,200
but to my surprise, I saw it again.

612
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,660
What a wonderful sight to see
as I step outside of my shade,

613
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,120
I know it was great to be in that spot,

614
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,870
but to my acknowledgement,

615
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,740
it was reflection of my own self.

616
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,880
Wow.

617
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,750
Evana, where did this come from?

618
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,550
You wrote that in like 30 seconds.

619
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,220
What did you do before
this, professionally?

620
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,560
Okay, I work for the

621
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,390
New York City Human
Resource Administration.

622
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,140
So, what do you do when
you're not in this class?

623
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,610
I take a maybe about three
or four classes a day on Zoom.

624
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,150
- Three or four?
- Everyday.

625
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:25,320
I take exercise, Tai-Chi,
group session, yoga exercise.

626
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,650
And then, in the evening I be
on prayer line with my church.

627
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,410
You know, I do ministry.

628
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,000
- I preach.
- You do?

629
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,780
Yes I do, I do preach.

630
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,840
So, sometimes I maybe I'll sit down

631
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,090
and write a little sermon.

632
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,260
Who makes you laugh?

633
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,420
You know, depends on, it.

634
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,800
Could be anybody depends
on what they say.

635
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,670
I love to laugh, you know
because laughing is very good
for you.

636
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,890
What, what is your laugh sound like?

637
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,640
(Evana laughs)

638
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,440
Oh a laugh that make you feel so good?

639
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,530
You know, it open up everything.

640
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,690
And what would you say
is your outlook on life?

641
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,450
Well, my outlook is,
I'm enjoying my retirement

642
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,820
and I love it.

643
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,950
I do what I want to do,

644
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,370
get up when I want to get up,

645
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,740
wear what I want to wear and
I say what I want to say.

646
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,920
Evana. I, I I'm sorry
that she went first.

647
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,300
I'm sorry, but yeah, you
really set the bar very high.

648
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Okay. Bill.

649
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,490
It gets easier now for everyone.

650
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,310
Set the bar low.

651
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,640
That bar was way up there,

652
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,520
we gotta bring it back down to earth.

653
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,980
Thank you.

654
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,770
There was a whale who
never failed during a gale.

655
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,270
Wouldn't shut up about the holy grail.

656
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,570
(group laughs)

657
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,940
Thank you, Bill.

658
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,490
What did you do
professionally before this?

659
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,570
Stagehand, I was a stagehand.

660
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,070
Local One stagehand.

661
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,780
Did you do comedy before this class?

662
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,830
No.

663
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,240
Did you ever want to?

664
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,000
Sure.

665
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,040
Yeah. It just never crossed
my mind as a possibility.

666
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,090
And then you came along.

667
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,800
And do you think like you
have the same sense of humor

668
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,510
as most of the people in the class?

669
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,890
I don't think we have
the same sense of humor,

670
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,060
but different people in
the class do crack me up

671
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,980
and are hilarious.

672
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,060
Bibi is one who, who is so dry

673
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,650
and if you're not
paying attention, you're
liable to miss it.

674
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,570
But I think she's hilarious.

675
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,360
Does your wife think you're funny?

676
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,950
The question's kind of broad.

677
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,240
(Jo laughs)

678
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,320
But is she coming to the show?

679
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,530
Yes.

680
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,620
Are you nervous for the show?

681
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,870
I'm scared to death.

682
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,540
- Really?
- Absolutely.

683
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,040
What are you scared of?

684
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,210
Never having done this in
front of a live audience before.

685
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,920
You're pretty vulnerable.

686
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,130
And you know, just telling
the joke is one thing,

687
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,510
having them judge...

688
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,510
Now throw in the lions.

689
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,770
Yeah, okay.

690
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,020
Ziggy, you got one?

691
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,940
As I trickle, I hold my pickle.

692
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,400
I was circumcised with a sickle.

693
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,320
I hope you're not fickle.

694
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,490
Okay, thank you so much.

695
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,360
Okay, let's see.

696
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,660
Nicki, you have one?

697
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,780
Ode to my best friend,
Esteemed iPhone 8,

698
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,200
ever present and ready to
fulfill my limitless quest

699
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,920
for unquenchable edification.

700
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,920
All I can say in,
grateful appreciation, is

701
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,000
forever Merci Beaucoup.

702
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,010
And that was about your iPhone?

703
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,220
Yes.

704
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,890
It's an ode to my
iPhone, my best friend.

705
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,470
Can we see it one more time?

706
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,940
Oh, of course, I love it.

707
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,770
Richard.

708
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,400
The Lord is my shepherd.

709
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,360
(group laughs)

710
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,270
No, that's not right, I'm sorry.

711
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,360
Today is hot and sweaty.

712
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,020
My girlfriend's name is Betty.

713
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,660
I'd like to get her clothes
off, so she'd be cool and ready.

714
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,780
(group laughs)

715
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,040
So, you have some time,
cause the show's on Friday,

716
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,710
- Friday?
- Friday.

717
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,840
You have to do a three
to four minute set.

718
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,470
That's a long time.

719
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,760
Is that based on what
we said today or anything?

720
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,930
It could be anything.

721
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,850
You can all do something
for three minutes.

722
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,720
Like I said, if you're
waiting for the laughs,

723
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,980
it'll be a little more.

724
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,190
Lynne, might go over a little bit,

725
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,310
but everyone else might go under.

726
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,810
And who knows?

727
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,940
So, think about the stuff
that you came up with today.

728
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,320
And also maybe things
that you'd like to joke

729
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,860
about in class, so far
for the whole year.

730
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,070
Should it be cohesive?

731
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,450
Or could it be things strung together

732
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,740
or it should be...?

733
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,080
You know, you can
always use the, "anyway".

734
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,830
Anyway.

735
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,540
- Okay.
- Yeah.

736
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,370
Could I do a bar jokes?

737
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,500
Walked into a bar?

738
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,330
Yes, definitely.

739
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,000
What's the set up gonna be?

740
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,500
- A stage.
- A real stage?

741
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,630
There's gonna be a microphone.

742
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,840
- Like this?
- Yeah.

743
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,340
You guys are doing... this is
great.

744
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,510
And you did a great class.

745
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,640
So, give it up for yourself.

746
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,590
(group applause)

747
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,270
I'm gonna bring up an
old show business joke.

748
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,320
A fellow was complaining
to his friend. He said,

749
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,890
"Oh, I have this terrible job,
terrible, terrible job".

750
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,030
"What is it?"

751
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,450
"Well, I go behind the
elephants in a circus

752
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,330
"when they go around the circus
ring and I sweep behind him.

753
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,410
"And the dung falls all
over me, all over my face,

754
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,290
"all over my body.

755
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,210
"It smells awful.

756
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,420
"It smells terrible.

757
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,960
"And even when I go home
afterwards and shower,

758
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,840
"it doesn't come off.

759
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,550
"It doesn't come off."

760
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,550
So his friend says, "Well, why don't

761
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,470
"you just leave that job"?

762
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:39,500
He says, "What, and
leave show business?".

763
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,180
When I used to do singing, I
worked comedy into my act

764
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,810
and to my introductions and so forth.

765
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,650
And usually I got good
at handling people,

766
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,610
that would...

767
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,400
- What's the word?
- Heckle?

768
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,320
Heckle you.

769
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,860
- Start singing.
- What?

770
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,940
I'm gonna heckle you.

771
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,110
You gotta shut me down.

772
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,450

Wow, that was beautiful.

Good enough? Good enough?

781
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,970
Well, I wrote the song.

782
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,430
When did you write it

783
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,640
and are there other lyrics
besides toy balloon?

784
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,230
It was one of my first songs I wrote.

785
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,650
I did a play called
Aladdin Lived in Brooklyn.

786
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,270
And I stuck it in the play

787
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,110
as the song with the princess song.

788
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,360

Hi Elaine.

796
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,840
Here's the booze.

797
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,720
I don't drink.

798
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,800
Rebecca, come sit.

799
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,640
Who else would like one?

800
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
It's non alcoholic.

801
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,050
It's also warm.

802
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,890
L'Chaim, everybody.

803
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,980
Break a leg everybody.

804
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,140
What was the thing she said to you?

805
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,900
"You got a pencil in your pocket,

806
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,810
were you happy to see
me?" is that the one?

807
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,860
Welcome everybody to the party bus.

808
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,770
(group applause)

809
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,280
We're gonna get pumped up.

810
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,530
We got a show in about
two and a half hours.

811
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,160
Who can do a pump up?

812
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,540
Who can pump everybody up?

813
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,170
Yeah okay, go for it.

814
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,270
You can either meditate or
take some Quaaludes and relax.

815
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,260
She said, "Do you
have a pump up for us?".

816
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,840
Oh, well I'd love some more champagne.

817
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,350
Evana, can you pump everybody up?

818
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,520
You could either keep your
mouth shut or open it wide.

819
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,140
(group laughs)

820
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,520
Tom, you gotta pump up?

821
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,850
We're going out there.

822
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,560
We're gonna slay them with jokes.

823
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,020
We're gonna kill them.

824
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,020
Ain't gonna have nothing left.

825
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,570
We're gonna lay them lying
in the aisles laughing

826
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,070
and gasping for air.

827
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,700
One two three, jokes!

828
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,530
(group cheers)

829
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,870
One two three, jokes!

830
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,410
[Group] One two three, jokes!

831
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,870
So, Tom, I couldn't help but notice

832
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,070
that you were not at the class.

833
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,710
Can you account for your whereabouts?

834
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,960
I was at my 9,
8:30 to 4:30 job.

835
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,960
What's that?

836
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,710
That is HR.

837
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,050
- You work in HR?
- Yeah.

838
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,220
And they don't know
about my, this life.

839
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,010
- They don't?
- No.

840
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,010
It's like seriously is a secret.

841
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,270
- Wow.
- Yeah.

842
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,430
- Secret.
- I know.

843
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,680
Well it's safe with me, I won't tell.

844
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,230
Thank you.

845
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,150
And so, so you're kind of
at this other level though.

846
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,150
You're, you're doing comedy.

847
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,440
You've been doing comedy
professionally for a long time.

848
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,940
What does it feel like being in a group

849
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,490
where these people are doing
comedy maybe for the first
time?

850
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,240
I realize this is not their background.

851
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,580
They might've been professional
people and all that.

852
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,370
But it's one of the
things I enjoy the most.

853
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,120
Actually, when they give
somebody their answer, they go,

854
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,970
"Oh, what's going
to happen next?"

855
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,750
Who would play you in a movie?

856
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,080
Al Pacino.

857
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,750
Who do you like to make laugh the most?

858
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,130
The senior citizens

859
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,090
because they're not
the usual comedy crowd.

860
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,260
I think they take more
of a liking to me.

861
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,010
Well, a few don't and
they throw things.

862
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,350
But other than that.

863
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,060
But then again, how far
can they throw things,

864
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,310
you know, at that age?

865
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,850
You know, I can't either.

866
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,480
I'm not making fun of them,
you know, I, you know.

867
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,020
But anywhere I could get
a laugh, I'm fine with.

868
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,110
Ah, I'm doing jokes.

869
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,900
So you better get this party started.

870
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,030
[Jo] Helen, you got one?

871
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,150

872
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,700
My first song I wrote.

873
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,490
No, I wrote another
song before that called

874
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,700

you guys have the rest

885
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,890
of your nights to take the party
bus, you know, around town.

886
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,970
What about lunch?

887
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,320
So, what you're gonna do is

888
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,990
you're gonna, someone's
gonna open the curtain

889
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,830
when your name is called.

890
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,950
You're gonna go through the curtain

891
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,830
and you're going to
grab this microphone.

892
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,910
And this is my other joke.

893
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,170
And it just became three minutes.

894
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,460
Everybody see?

895
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,210
Raise your hand if
you see the red light.

896
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,300
I'm just gonna announce you
and then you'll come up.

897
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,800
And if you need familiarity,

898
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,840
if you're good on the
mic don't worry about it.

899
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,890
I'd like to try.

900
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:29,840
Okay, we'll go in order.

901
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,140
How about that?

902
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,140
I've never spoken in a mic before.

903
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,740
- Just speak into it?
- Yeah.

904
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,680
Good evening.

905
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,890
Good afternoon everybody.

906
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,850
Tom comes up to the stage.

907
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,690
- Oh.
- Thank you.

908
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,520
Smooth.

909
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm Richard.

910
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,360
And and a bar walked into...

911
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,070
No wait.

912
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,030
A guy walked into...

913
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,950
A bartender went into the zoo.

914
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,030
Barbara Bova.

915
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,030
Yeah. Hi everyone.

916
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,620
- Ugh.
- There you go.

917
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,290
Hello I'm Helen Yalof.

918
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,820
Okay, coming up to the
stage next it's Evana Lewis.

919
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,830
Hello. My name is Evana Lewis.

920
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,090
I love to dance.

921
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,670
Is there any tables in this audience?

922
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,710
Okay.

923
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,170
Hello there.

924
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,970
New York New York wonderful town.

925
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,050
Thank you.

926
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,260
Yay. Hello everybody.

927
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,350
Coming to our performance.

928
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,600
And then you just want to make sure

929
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,100
that mic stays right
in front of your mouth.

930
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,730
- Oh.
- Yeah.

931
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,310
Hello, mic.

932
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,850
And hi, everybody else.

933
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,650
I wanna thank you all for
coming to my bar mitzvah.

934
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,780
I can say you're
an actress and a singer?

935
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,940
I actually am a producer,
entertainer, playwright.

936
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,200
You hate me.

937
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,080
I don't hate you.

938
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,160
Sometimes I hate you.

939
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,290
Sometimes you hate me.

940
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,000
That's so great.

941
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,380
How'd you make this?

942
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,000
Wanting to be a playwright,

943
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,920
my advice to you is
to drop this for now

944
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,260
and do something else.

945
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,710
Are you gonna be doing the curtain?

946
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,440
(general chit chat)

947
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Hi.

948
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,640
Blah blah blah blah blah.

949
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,530
Honey.

950
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,200
- Okay okay.
- Okay.

951
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,730
Okay okay.

952
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,370
Hi everybody.

953
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,660
(audience applause)

954
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,960
Thank you all for being here.

955
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,420
You're a beautiful crowd.

956
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,890
These people are very odd.

957
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,670
I don't think there's a
regular one amongst them.

958
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,810
Has anyone been to a 2:00
PM comedy show before?

959
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:42,940
(audience laughs)

960
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,900
Oh, you have.

961
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,730
Okay, so you got the vibe.

962
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,360
The vibe is nasty.

963
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,060
I'm constantly shocked by what
everybody says in this group.

964
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,950
But I'm excited to start the show.

965
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,530
(audience applause)

966
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,740
He's an incredible comedian.

967
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,530
It's Tom Petavano.

968
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,660
I come from a poor family,
but let me tell you something.

969
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:08,870
Every night my mother
had food on the table.

970
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,010
I wish we had plates.

971
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,380
(audience laughs)

972
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,220
And then I'll never forget this saying,

973
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,930
"Mommy, I wanted a toy
truck for my birthday.

974
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,180
"I didn't get one, I'm upset."

975
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,520
She goes, "Shut up
you're 40 years old."

976
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,150
I love getting older.

977
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,020
You know, I'm losing my hair,

978
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,480
but I know where it's going.

979
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,690
It's going to my knuckles.

980
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,320
I love getting older.

981
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,530
You know, at Wendy's I
get my coffee for free.

982
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,200
Give it up for getting older.

983
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,200
(audience applause)

984
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,410
My name is Helen Yalof.

985
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,280
And if you ever meet me,
you can remind me of that.

986
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,700
Jo, are you sure the
doors are locked, now?

987
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,890
I have been an aspiring
actress for the past 15 years

988
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,180
and I'm still aspiring, so.

989
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,470
(audience applause)

990
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,560
This next comedian coming
to the stage would like

991
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,400
for me to tell you that
she is a great dancer.

992
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Put your hands together
for Evana Lewis.

993
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,110
So, I went into the dentist he said,

994
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,650
"How are you doing Ms. Lewis?"

995
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,660
I said, "Doc, can you
give me implant instead

996
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,580
of putting back my partial?

997
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,120
He said, "No, you have
to make an appointment".

998
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,660
"I was so disappointment".

999
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,960
My boss ever sees this, I'm dead.

1000
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,080
(audience applause)

1001
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,580
Now I get to eat.

1002
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,260
You know, I had my thing under notes.

1003
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,760
Now I can't find it.

1004
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,630
It's called Justice.

1005
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,100
Oh, you found it.

1006
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,480
Nicki Cochrane.

1007
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,190
(audience applause)

1008
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,940
Well, good afternoon and welcome.

1009
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,280
I'm so delighted that
you all came to watch us.

1010
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,950
There are people, millions of people

1011
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,660
who say they believe
every word of the Bible.

1012
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,990
Okay, fine.

1013
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,620
But then I want them to
be logical and be aware

1014
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,790
of the consequences of their belief.

1015
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,840
The Bible says an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth.

1016
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,130
So, I want you to follow
those consequences.

1017
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,140
The Bible advocates that.

1018
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,180
Our legal system today has
no connection to justice,

1019
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,770
but in the ancient world,

1020
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,310
they really, they really
cared about justice.

1021
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,150
I was on a plane and I overheard

1022
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,650
the conversation behind me.

1023
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,440
It was a southern girl
asking a northern girl,

1024
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,150
"So, where you all from?".

1025
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,030
And the snooty northern girl says,

1026
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,660
"Well, I'm from a place
where they know better than

1027
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,540
to end the sentence in a preposition".

1028
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,500
She goes, "So where
are y'all from, bitch?"

1029
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,960
(audience applause)

1030
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,420
Actually, that was
from Playboy magazine.

1031
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,710
Lynne, that was great.

1032
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,350
My mother, my mother was a saint.

1033
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,720
I brought you inside and I raised you.

1034
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,560
I fed you, you little son of a bitch.

1035
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,480
Oh, I can't say that.

1036
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,310
I mean you little shit ass.

1037
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,070
Thank you.

1038
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,490
That little shit ass.

1039
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,360
Coming up next to the stage,

1040
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,280
he's ridiculous but we love him.

1041
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,040
It is Bill Burke everybody, Bill Burke.

1042
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,200
Oh my god.

1043
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,320
(audience applause)

1044
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,200
My wife left me recently.

1045
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I was really sad.

1046
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,090
I was depressed.

1047
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,600
I went out and I bought a puppy.

1048
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,560
I bought a new motorcycle.

1049
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,880
Spent a lot of money
on drugs and alcohol.

1050
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,770
She's going to be really pissed

1051
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,980
when she gets home from work.

1052
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,060
(audience applause)

1053
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,820
My new thesaurus is terrible.

1054
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,770
Not only that, it's terrible.

1055
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,360
What's red and bad for your teeth?

1056
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,250
A brick.

1057
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,960
(audience laughs)

1058
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,790
My name is Bill.

1059
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,340
This has been my Ted Talk.

1060
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,540
Thank you.

1061
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,340
(audience applause)

1062
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,910
He's so naughty.

1063
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,710
It's just terrific.

1064
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,930
This next comedian coming to the stage.

1065
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,230
She's the Seamus at her synagogue.

1066
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,260
It is Barbara Bova.

1067
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,190
Two jumper cables walk
in and the bartender says,

1068
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:46,070
"Hey, you two, don't you
start anything in here".

1069
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,190
Julius Cesar walks in and
he asks for a martinez.

1070
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:54,410
The bartender says, "Don't
you mean a martini?"

1071
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,870
And he said, "No.

1072
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,880
"If I would have wanted two,

1073
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,710
"I would have asked
for a double.".

1074
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,590
I was debating, how do
I kill these cockroaches?

1075
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,630
Do I use a sponge?

1076
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,800
Or do I use my hand?

1077
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,930
Now, yeah, I know it's disgusting.

1078
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,380
I forgot to give the trigger warning.

1079
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,980
If I go for the sponge,

1080
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,230
it takes like one second
to go for the sponge

1081
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,650
before I go for the kill.

1082
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,150
That one second is a
really important second.

1083
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,400
You could lose ground
in that one second.

1084
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,740
Oh my God I'm dead.

1085
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,950
The world is crazy, you know.

1086
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,740
No one knows what's happening anymore.

1087
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,240
You know, everybody's done sending.

1088
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,830
Nobody in the woods, you know,

1089
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,540
who is going, who is coming.

1090
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,870
And then everything goes, but
it's great, you know. (Laughs)

1091
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,340
Cause I don't know where I'm
going or coming either, so.

1092
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,090
(audience applause)

1093
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,330
Orlando Dole

1094
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:51,140
If you asked me to describe my figure,

1095
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,970
I wouldn't say that I
was an apple or a pear.

1096
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,350
I'd say I was a soft boiled
egg with breasts and...

1097
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,060
(audience laughs)

1098
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,690
Say you're on a date with a
guy you don't know.

1099
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,740
This is what he expects
you to be wearing. Okay?

1100
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,070
I mean, look at this.

1101
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,110
These are what I actually am wearing.

1102
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,370
No, I'll show you.

1103
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,740
They're great. They're good.

1104
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,070
(audience applause)

1105
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,070
Alix Elias!

1106
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,500
They liked you a lot.

1107
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,800
They liked you too.

1108
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,380
This next comedian
would like you to know

1109
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,970
that she's been retired for 30 years

1110
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,960
and she's never been busier.

1111
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,090
The one and only Bibi Elvers.

1112
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,650
I am a hoarder.

1113
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,400
And I don't know how
to get rid of my stuff.

1114
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,150
And I can never find anything.

1115
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,770
This is just some.

1116
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,990
My favorite, absolute
favorite toy, when I was a kid

1117
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,950
when I was very young, is this.

1118
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,950
And he has a little zipper pocket.

1119
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,280
His name is Dog Do.

1120
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,130
I didn't speak English at the time

1121
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,380
but I had heard a few words
and Dog Do sounded just right.

1122
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,930
When, when my husband was
having his knee replaced,

1123
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:18,600
he begged the doctor to
give him his real bone

1124
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,880
after the operation.

1125
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,100
Well, they're not allowed to do that,

1126
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,440
but he was a very persistent
man, my husband was.

1127
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,810
And that's what this is.

1128
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,440
These are his bones.

1129
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,980
Then there was my head surgery.

1130
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:41,160
Oh, I can't find it.

1131
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,710
Well, I'll finish down here.

1132
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:50,630
I'm fine.

1133
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,920
(audience applause)

1134
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,840
Two days after the surgery...

1135
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,880
(audience applause)

1136
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,400
This was on my bed table.

1137
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,230
And what it is is the hair

1138
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,990
that they had shaved
off me 30 years ago.

1139
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,570
I think, I think I'm a
little bit lighter now.

1140
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,870
Thanks for being so wonderful.

1141
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,200
(audience applause)

1142
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,670
Bibi Elvers

1143
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,590
A true, a true champion.

1144
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,800
Incredible.

1145
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,310
Was that on purpose?

1146
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,220
What?

1147
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,520
Were you falling on purpose?

1148
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,190
Put your hands together
for Ziggy Susser.

1149
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,360
(audience applause)

1150
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,190
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1151
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:51,860
It was an absolutely soft landing.

1152
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,400
We have a pet bird at
home, a small parrot.

1153
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,660
We called him Charlie.

1154
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,700
Bout a year ago,

1155
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,200
my wife was getting up off the couch

1156
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,200
and she accidentally stepped on him,

1157
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,250
flattened him out like a pancake.

1158
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,210
He was okay but they
brought me to the vet

1159
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,790
and she said, "He doesn't
have any brain damage.

1160
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,000
"He doesn't have any broken bones".

1161
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,250
I said, "How do you know?".

1162
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,630
She said, "He answered
all our questions."

1163
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,630
"We asked him who
brought you here?".

1164
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:17,300
He said, "Big foot".

1165
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,550
We asked him, "How did
the universe start?".

1166
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,010
He said, "Big bang".

1167
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,890
We asked him who's
your favorite character

1168
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,430
on Sesame Street?".

1169
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,340
He said, "Cookie Monster".

1170
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,680
I thought he would say Big Bird too.

1171
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:33,900
I'm Ziggy Susser.

1172
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,400
Thanks, you've been great.

1173
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,520
(audience applause)

1174
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,030
Ziggy Susser everybody.

1175
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,660
Okay and if you could just give

1176
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,750
a big round of applause to
everybody you saw tonight.

1177
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,580
If we could see everybody take a bow.

1178
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:54,710
(audience applause)

1179
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:02,710
(light piano music)

1180
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,230
I just wanted to say
how great everybody was.

1181
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,900
And it was really a great
experience working with you.

1182
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,110
And I just wanted to give everybody

1183
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:18,280
a rose like we're
on The Bachelor. Ok?

1184
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,480
Wonderful.

1185
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,250
Where did they wire the mic?

1186
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,620
They did not.

1187
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,320
Honey. I'll see you at home.

1188
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:32,790
How would you like some pictures

1189
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:34,880
from the back showing all the seats?

1190
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,920
But it's empty.

1191
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,260
Even though it's empty?

1192
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,760
But it shows you how
many seats were here.

1193
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,210
It's still cool.

1194
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,510
Did you guys help each
other write your sets

1195
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,560
or did you write them yourselves?

1196
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,640
We sort of fought over it.

1197
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,010
We had a fight?

1198
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,650
I think we're doing a group photo.

1199
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:51,520
Oh that'd be great.

1200
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,180
I'd like to be in that.

1201
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,440
I think what would
be Kind of funny is if

1202
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,530
you lied down in the front,
you know what I mean,

1203
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,570
with the rose maybe.

1204
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,770
Exactly.

1205
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,370
When I get up in the
morning, you smile, you laugh

1206
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,580
because that's a beginning of the day

1207
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,160
and that will help you
go through the day.

1208
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,200
Because the start off
with that energy in you

1209
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,500
and that laugh.

1210
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,550
And then you go on to
share it with someone else.

1211
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:18,950
And you keep them happy.

1212
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,260
It doesn't matter they
might have a bad day,

1213
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,760
but you give them a joke
and they start laughing.

1214
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,340
You feel good.

1215
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:31,340
Laughter it's like food
you put in your body.

1216
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,900
It keeps you going.

1217
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,520
It energize you.

1218
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,770
It keep you happy.

1219
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,700
And you know that you
go through the day,

1220
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,150
it's love and joy.

1221
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,580
You're not supposed to let
anybody take away your joy,

1222
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,400
just keep on smiling.

1223
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:53,910
I love it.

1224
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,010
I'm gonna ask you to finish the joke.

1225
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:01,050
Guy walks into a bar.

1226
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,800
And he's not an alcoholic.

1227
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,050
They throw him out.

1228
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,260
Say, "I want a tequila on the rocks".

1229
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,420
A guy walks into the bar,

1230
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,140
"Have you seen my
friend Phoebe?"

1231
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,350
"Phoebe who's to hell's Phoebe.

1232
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:18,570
"That's what I like to know
where the hell is Phoebe?"

1233
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:19,570
That's a joke?

1234
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:20,150
No, that's not exactly.

1235
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,320
That's not it.

1236
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,950
He ordered a beer on the rocks

1237
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,990
and the bartender said,
"You're not old enough.

1238
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,990
"And besides we don't have any."

1239
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,740
Two friends are sitting on a bus.

1240
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,940
One throws up.

1241
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,500
Two friends are sitting on a bus and...

1242
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:41,760
One says, move to the
rear and the other leaves.

1243
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,960
Then what happens?

1244
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,930
That's a good question.

1245
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,140
Two friends are sitting on a bus.

1246
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:48,930
And they didn't pay their fare.

1247
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:49,850
They're thrown off.

1248
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,470
