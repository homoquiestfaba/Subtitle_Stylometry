1
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,113
- Bit early for you, isn't it?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

2
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,215
<i>I wanted to see</i>
<i>what it felt like to be you.</i>

3
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,315
And?

4
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,585
<i>It's overrated.</i>

5
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,452
You'll get used to it.

6
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,287
<i>How about I just live</i>
<i>vicariously through you</i>
<i>instead?</i>

7
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,591
<i>Hmm?</i>

8
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:20,595
<i>Listen, I need you to give</i>
<i>Karl at STB Capital</i>
<i>a call on your way in.</i>

9
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,196
- Oh, yeah?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

10
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,098
<i>I woke up</i>
<i>to an email from him.</i>

11
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:26,333
<i>I think he's got</i>
<i>buyer's remorse.</i>

12
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,070
He likes the returns.

13
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,005
<i>Yeah, but still,</i>

14
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,373
<i>I think something spooked him.</i>
<i>I need you to do your thing.</i>

15
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,408
I'll talk to him.
He'll be fine.

16
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:38,713
<i>Good. You're a credit</i>
<i>to capitalism.</i>

17
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,347
<i>Say hello to Heather for me.</i>

18
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,016
Not a good idea.

19
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:44,484
<i>You're an asshole.</i>

20
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,373
Morning.

21
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:09,143
Anders says hello.
Going somewhere?

22
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:10,578
I...

23
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,613
I'm meeting Christina
this morning.

24
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,381
Uh-huh?

25
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,623
After that, I thought
I'd pick up the kids

26
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:25,092
and maybe move
to the Moon.

27
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:26,527
Oh.

28
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,362
Matt!

29
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,366
I'm sorry, honey.
It-it's work.

30
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,270
Right.

31
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,872
I'm meeting Christina.

32
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,407
You said you'd
take them today.

33
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,877
Oh, God. I really need
to make this call.

34
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,879
I can't have them
playing in the back,

35
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,848
making noise
while I'm on the call...

36
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,749
- Matt, I need to see her.
- ...with an important client.

37
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:50,084
Can't you see her this weekend?

38
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,586
I asked you

39
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,454
to help out just one day.

40
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,061
Okay, okay. Fine.
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,900
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-mm.

42
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,574
Heather...

43
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,017
<i>Congratulations.</i>

44
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,053
<i>This actually helps...</i>

45
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:37,531
- Where's your brother?
- On his phone.

46
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:40,301
Tell him to come down.
We're leaving now.

47
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,303
Zach, we're leaving!

48
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,206
- <i>So, um,</i>
<i>I think you'll be...</i>

49
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,308
I was
watching that.

50
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,977
Go and get
your brother. Now.

51
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,647
Ugh! Zach!

52
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,823
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

53
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,395
What now?

54
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,097
Nothing. It's fine.

55
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,837
Hey.

56
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,542
Get them to school
on time, okay?

57
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,346
Yeah... Lov-love you.

58
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,848
- Hey, we're leaving.
- Hey, get out!

59
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:29,951
- Hey, get out!
- Let me come in!

60
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,886
Just get out!

61
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,988
- I told you last time...
- Oh, for the love of God.

62
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,057
- Get out! Get out! Get out!
- Zach!

63
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,959
- Hey, get out!
- Zach!

64
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:39,727
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

65
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,196
Hey, hey, hey!
What's happening here?

66
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,598
- He slammed the door on me.
- You don't come in here!

67
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,133
Don't speak
to your sister like that.

68
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,902
Then don't let her
in my room, Matt.

69
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:51,339
Hey, I am your father.

70
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,640
I'm not Matt.

71
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,810
- Why is she crying?
- 'Cause she knows
you'll fall for it.

72
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,646
- He's gonna skip school
with her.
- Shut up, Em!

73
00:07:58,779 --> 00:07:59,947
I don't have time
for this.

74
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,549
Go and get
your things ready.

75
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,917
Dad, he broke my finger!

76
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,318
Go!

77
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:06,988
We'll be down in a sec.

78
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:11,926
Okay.

79
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,395
If this is gonna be
one of your talks, I don't
have time for it if it is.

80
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,397
Zach, what is this?

81
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,965
Can I just go now, Dad?

82
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,969
- You're skipping school?
- Why would I skip school?

83
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,738
You have
a girlfriend, yeah?

84
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,239
Do you even care
if I do?

85
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:27,174
If you're skipping school,
yeah, I care.

86
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:33,147
Get in the car.
We're going! Now!

87
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,356
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.
He was walking.

88
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,858
Oh, jeez.

89
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,947
Careful, careful.
What is that?

90
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,383
For practice.
I have a match today.

91
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:45,686
Well, don't bounce it,
honey. I need to focus.

92
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,823
Are you coming?

93
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,661
Uh...

94
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:58,332
Um, I can't.

95
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,335
You don't even know
when it is.

96
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,803
Work is busy.

97
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:08,809
Next one, I promise.

98
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:41,809
Zach, get in.

99
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,378
Zach.

100
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:47,414
Can you just listen
for once?

101
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:49,984
I can hear you.

102
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,685
Zach, get in the car.

103
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,689
- Or what?
- Get in the car right now!

104
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,794
Zach, get in the car
this second!

105
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,063
Please!

106
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:15,142
Please. Come on.

107
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:27,955
Thank you.

108
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,658
I think I can see my bone.

109
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,225
- Shut up.
- Hey.

110
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,308
Call Unger.

111
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:54,181
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Karl, it's Matt.

112
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:56,183
How's Katherine?

113
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,352
<i>Telling me not to waste</i>
<i>any more of our children's</i>
<i>inheritance.</i>

114
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,523
I heard.
When did you get
so sensitive?

115
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,991
<i>When my stock dropped</i>
<i>17% overnight.</i>

116
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,561
See it
as an opportunity.

117
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:10,565
<i>I see it as a trend.</i>
<i>Not in the right direction.</i>

118
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:11,865
<i>I want out.</i>

119
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,968
What have I always
told you?

120
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,470
"Predicting the rain
doesn't count."

121
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,439
<i>"Building the Ark does."</i>

122
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:20,374
<i>I thought that was</i>
<i>Warren Buffett.</i>

123
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:21,909
So listen to him, then.

124
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,911
Turbulence is inevitable.

125
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,647
When everyone runs
from the fire,

126
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,848
you run to it.

127
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:32,419
Karl, you're investing in me.
That's the deal.

128
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:35,289
<i>Maybe you've lost</i>
<i>your touch.</i>

129
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,861
Hey, how long
have we known each other?

130
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:44,131
- <i>Eighteen years.</i>
- Eighteen years.

131
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,900
Do you remember what you said
to me the first time we met?

132
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,870
<i>That was</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

133
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:51,338
Well, I remember.

134
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:54,743
You told me you were tired
of playing it safe.

135
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,511
That you wanted
to be someone else.

136
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,179
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>that was a long time ago.</i>

137
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:02,216
The man you are now,
I know you.

138
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,252
You don't run
from a challenge.
You take it on.

139
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:08,122
You take on the uncertainty,
the risks,

140
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,693
so you can give Katherine
everything she's ever
dreamed of.

141
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,327
You provide.

142
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,995
Just look in the mirror
and ask,

143
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:18,566
how you've provided
everything. How?

144
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,368
Where you've come from
to get where we are?

145
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:23,772
You've climbed up
that ladder.

146
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,306
You can't let go.

147
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,710
I know you, Karl.
We're the same.

148
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,110
You walk away from me

149
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,313
and you're walking back
to that old life.

150
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:35,382
And at our age,
you don't come back
from that.

151
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,454
Karl, are you looking
in that mirror?

152
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:41,556
Hmm?

153
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:49,463
<i>All right. I'm in.</i>

154
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,600
<i>Is this why Anders</i>
<i>likes you so much?</i>

155
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:54,569
<i>You make people feel good</i>

156
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:58,038
<i>about losing three million</i>
<i>euros in 24 hours?</i>

157
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,709
You'll have to ask him, pal.

158
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,150
Did you win, Daddy?

159
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,318
Yeah.

160
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,588
How?

161
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,590
Eh, it's complicated.

162
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:19,259
It's like I caught a fish.

163
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:23,297
You use a nice big fat worm
and you dangle a hook and--

164
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,532
You lie.

165
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,401
It's pretty easy.

166
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,445
Someone important?

167
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,315
- Her name's Mila.
- Shut up.

168
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,450
I wasn't talking
to you, Zach.

169
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:44,985
Well, you are right now.

170
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,655
Hey, that's enough.

171
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:03,036
- Are you gonna answer that?
- What?

172
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,939
Are you gonna answer that?

173
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,374
It's not mine.

174
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,681
- Is it Mom's?
- No.

175
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:16,383
Emily?

176
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:18,118
It's not mine.

177
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:51,886
Hello?

178
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,220
<i>Hello, Matt.</i>

179
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,590
Hello. Yes. Who's this?

180
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,293
<i>I like your car.</i>

181
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,262
Sorry, who is this?

182
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:05,299
<i>You keep asking</i>
<i>the same question.</i>

183
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,301
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>you'll get an answer?</i>

184
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,904
- Sylvain?
- <i>Not Sylvain.</i>

185
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:12,072
<i>Just me. And you.</i>

186
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:13,842
I'm hanging up now.

187
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,476
<i>I wouldn't do that.</i>

188
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:22,149
<i>I said I like</i>
<i>your nice leather seats.</i>

189
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:27,254
<i>But I wouldn't really want</i>
<i>to be in that seat right now.</i>

190
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,022
All right, that's enough.

191
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,291
<i>You hang up on me,</i>

192
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:34,394
<i>they'll be picking your guts</i>
<i>out of the trees</i>
<i>from here to Austria.</i>

193
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:41,034
<i>Do I have</i>
<i>your attention?</i>

194
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,403
<i>Matt Turner,</i>

195
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:46,139
<i>there is a bomb</i>
<i>under your seat.</i>

196
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:49,511
<i>You armed it</i>
<i>the second you sat down.</i>

197
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,680
<i>If you--</i>

198
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,319
Who was that?

199
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:02,089
Um, no one.
No one, honey.

200
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:12,232
Dad?

201
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,102
- Dad? Dad, stop!
- Dad!

202
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:21,709
Are you crazy?
You just missed the turn.

203
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:40,595
Right here.

204
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,089
You sure
this isn't Mom's?

205
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,692
Pretty sure.

206
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,668
Where are we?

207
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:56,804
Um...

208
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,742
Just, uh,

209
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,810
checking the car, sweetie.

210
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:07,247
Your brand-freaking-new

211
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,216
100,000-euro car's
breaking down?

212
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,019
- Great. I'll walk.
- Wait.

213
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,587
Wait.

214
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,501
What is it?

215
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,457
Dad, what's wrong?

216
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:55,830
Dad, who is that?

217
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:00,568
- Dad.
- Huh?

218
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:04,404
No one.

219
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,317
<i>Hang up on me again</i>
<i>and I detonate.</i>

220
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,653
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yes.

221
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:54,055
<i>Drive.</i>

222
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:55,556
<i>Don't stop driving.</i>

223
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,892
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yes.

224
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,797
<i>I didn't hear you.</i>

225
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,966
Yes, I'm driving.

226
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:07,434
<i>Good. Now that I have</i>
<i>your attention,</i>

227
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:09,336
<i>listen very carefully.</i>

228
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,939
<i>The device is connected</i>
<i>to a pressure plate.</i>

229
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:15,375
<i>If you get out of your seat,</i>
<i>the bomb will detonate.</i>

230
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,410
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yes.

231
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:19,247
<i>There is a secondary trigger,</i>

232
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:22,650
<i>a remote switch</i>
<i>that I am holding as we speak.</i>

233
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,619
<i>If you try to call the police,</i>

234
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,453
<i>if you try to get help...</i>

235
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:28,923
<i>...I will detonate.</i>

236
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:30,858
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

237
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:33,661
<i>If you go somewhere</i>
<i>I don't like,</i>
<i>I will detonate.</i>

238
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:36,264
<i>Do you understand</i>
<i>everything I have said to you?</i>

239
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,465
Yes. What do you want?

240
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,802
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>We'll get to that.</i>

241
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:43,137
Look, I have
my children in the car.

242
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:44,972
<i>That's interesting.</i>

243
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:46,674
- Let me get them out
and you and I can...
- <i>No.</i>

244
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,276
<i>Remember the first rule.</i>

245
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,777
<i>The pressure plates, Matt.</i>

246
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:52,479
<i>Wouldn't want</i>
<i>to change the pressure.</i>

247
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:55,016
<i>Keep it nice and heavy.</i>

248
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:58,653
<i>You do exactly what I say,</i>
<i>when I say it,</i>

249
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:01,556
<i>maybe you'll get out of this</i>
<i>in one piece.</i>

250
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,892
<i>And so will they.</i>

251
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:11,199
<i>Think of this day</i>
<i>as a profound</i>
<i>life experience.</i>

252
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,602
Did I-- did I do
something to you?

253
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:19,006
If I did, I'm sorry,
just... just tell me.

254
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,908
<i>You sound so... guilty.</i>

255
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,443
<i>What have you done, Matt?</i>

256
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,583
Whatever it is, I'm sorry.

257
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,718
- Dad?
- <i>I'm not convinced.</i>

258
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,220
Dad, you're going
the wrong way.

259
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,688
Zach, please.

260
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,723
Jesus.

261
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,962
<i>Don't you turn around.</i>

262
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,734
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

263
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:54,809
Look.

264
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:03,818
<i>Drive.</i>

265
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:16,330
<i>Don't stop driving.</i>

266
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,199
<i>Do exactly what I say.</i>

267
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:35,149
<i>I said I'm watching.</i>

268
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:38,853
Why does he keep going
the wrong way?

269
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:40,621
<i>Take your kids' phones.</i>

270
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:42,390
Th-their phones?
What am I supposed to say?

271
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:43,858
<i>Say whatever you want.</i>

272
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,059
And my phone?

273
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,528
<i>Keep it.</i>
<i>You're going to need it.</i>

274
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,266
- I don't think my children
are gonna like--
- <i>Now!</i>

275
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,834
Zach.

276
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:55,670
Zach!

277
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,039
What?

278
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:01,142
<i>The kids' phones,</i>
<i>I want them out of the car.</i>

279
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,345
Give me your phone.

280
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,414
- Em, you too.
- What?

281
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:07,815
Now!

282
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:09,550
- Are you psycho? Why?
- Yeah. Why?

283
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:11,519
<i>I have no patience, Matt.</i>

284
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:14,422
I'm your father.
I said give me your phones.

285
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,623
Why? What did I do?

286
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,124
You almost took my finger off.

287
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:18,259
Zach!

288
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,962
<i>Throw the phones out</i>

289
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:23,664
- <i>or kiss your kids goodbye.</i>
- Now!

290
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,369
- Zach!
- What the hell, Dad?

291
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:30,371
<i>I told you</i>
<i>to get their phones.</i>

292
00:24:30,504 --> 00:24:31,505
<i>I'm counting now.</i>

293
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:32,673
I hear you.

294
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:34,542
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

295
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:37,211
<i>...eight, seven...</i>

296
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:39,347
<i>...six,</i>

297
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,815
- <i>five...</i>
- I hear you.

298
00:24:40,948 --> 00:24:42,817
<i>...four, three...</i>

299
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,585
- Hang on, kids!
- <i>...two...</i>

300
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,726
- What was that?
- Dad!

301
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,271
Oh, my God. You just hit
Zach's girlfriend!

302
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:07,541
Hey, what is wrong with you?
You could've killed me!

303
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,243
I told you they were
skipping school.

304
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:11,379
- What are you doing?
- <i>Accidents happen, Matt.</i>

305
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:12,880
- I'm... I'm getting out.
- No!

306
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:14,215
- Zach!
<i>- Now drive.</i>

307
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,716
No, no, no, no.

308
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,918
- I'm leaving.
- Stay in your seats!

309
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,653
What the hell's wrong
with you?

310
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:21,122
Zach...

311
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:24,091
Are you out of your mind?

312
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,362
- Are you crazy?
You just hit her!
- Dad, stop it!

313
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:30,164
What are you doing?

314
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:31,932
Give me your phone, Zach.

315
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,035
- What are you doing?
- Give me your phone! Now!

316
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,836
No! Stop the car!

317
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:38,572
There's a bomb in this car!

318
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:48,949
There's a bomb in this car.

319
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:52,486
If any of us get out,
the car blows up.

320
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,588
If you don't get rid
of your phone,

321
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:56,157
the car blows up.

322
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:59,126
A bomb?

323
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,694
<i>Now.</i>

324
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:02,163
- <i>Get rid of them.</i>
- Give me your phone.

325
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,000
Thank you.

326
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,217
<i>Number one dad.</i>

327
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,219
<i>Your kids really listen,</i>
<i>don't they?</i>

328
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:27,054
I did what you asked.

329
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:31,625
<i>Good. Now drive</i>
<i>to this location.</i>

330
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:36,397
Where are we going?

331
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:43,204
Why does he
want to hurt us?

332
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:45,306
I don't know, sweetie.

333
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,341
Dad, what did you do?

334
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:56,016
<i>Answer that.</i>

335
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:59,920
- <i>I don't know</i>
<i>what you're saying.</i>
- Sylvain!

336
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:02,022
- Sylvain, who is that?
- <i>Wait, hold this. Matt?</i>

337
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:04,425
I'm freaking out
here. Okay?

338
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,061
There's a guy that called
and said that there's a bomb
underneath the car.

339
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:09,063
And if we get help,
it'll blow up.

340
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:11,065
<i>Stop! Just stop doing that!</i>

341
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,100
No! I don't understand.

342
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:14,401
Matt,

343
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:16,036
he said we're gonna die
because of you.

344
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,005
No. Hey! Stop! Stop!

345
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:20,975
- What else did he say?
- Wait, you know him?

346
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,677
Just stop!
Would you stop doing that?

347
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,246
Please, please.

348
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,948
Sylvain, steady on.
What else did he say?

349
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:30,217
<i>I don't know. Stop.</i>
<i>He said to wait for you</i>

350
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:32,253
until you arrived.
That's it.

351
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:33,854
So there you are.

352
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:35,489
No! No, don't touch that.
Don't touch that. Stop it.

353
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:37,124
Just stop it for one second.

354
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:38,826
<i>Please, I don't know</i>
<i>what you're saying.</i>

355
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,227
<i>Can you please be quiet</i>
<i>for one second?</i>

356
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:45,799
Matt, please?
I'm freaking out here, man.

357
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,668
I know you are. Me too.

358
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:49,870
But it's important
that you stay calm.

359
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:51,839
It's easy for you to say,
"stay calm". There's a bomb
underneath the car!

360
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:56,443
Listen to me.

361
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,812
Listen to me. Listen to me.
He called me too.

362
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:00,714
Which means
we're in this together.

363
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:02,316
<i>We're in what together?</i>

364
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:03,652
<i>Sylvain...</i>

365
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,452
Okay, well,
what did you do to him?

366
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,054
I didn't do anything.

367
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:09,624
I need you to focus.
Did he say anything else?

368
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:11,959
No, no, no.
I don't want to die.

369
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:13,662
Matt, I have a family.

370
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:15,229
No. What are you doing?

371
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,097
He said no phones.
Give me the fucking phone.

372
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:19,266
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

373
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,203
- <i>I don't want to die, Matt.</i>
- You're not going to die.

374
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:24,772
You just need
to stay calm and think.

375
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,608
I am going to die
if you don't...

376
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,842
<i>Don't make</i>
<i>promises you can't keep.</i>

377
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,978
Sylvain, there's a police
officer walking towards you
right now.

378
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:33,781
- Help! Help!
- Shh! Don't say another word!

379
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:36,150
- Help! No!
- No! No! Stop!

380
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:37,519
Calm down now.

381
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:42,790
Just be calm.

382
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:44,959
Just be quiet.
Just be calm.

383
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:18,926
No! No!

384
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:21,328
No!

385
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:36,711
Zach, Em, are you okay?

386
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:38,245
Answer me. Answer me.
Are you okay?

387
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:40,047
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay.

388
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,901
Zach, Emily, are you hurt?

389
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:02,604
I'm good. I'm okay.

390
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:04,204
Check her.
Check she's okay.

391
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,807
- She's good. She's good.
- I'm good.

392
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,744
<i>She should've listened.</i>
You didn't have to do that!

393
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:11,478
- <i>She broke the rules.</i>
- Rules?

394
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:13,782
You just killed three people.

395
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:16,984
<i>They weren't the first.</i>
<i>But they can be the last.</i>

396
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:18,385
<i>That's entirely up to you.</i>

397
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,354
Why did you want me
to see that?

398
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,923
<i>So you won't have any doubts</i>
<i>about my sincerity.</i>

399
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:25,926
Then take it out on me.
Just let my children go.

400
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:31,700
- Who was that?
- Someone from work.

401
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,067
Is that what
this is all about?

402
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,935
I told you,
I don't know.

403
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,406
I'm... I'm sorry, Zach.

404
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,842
it's okay.

405
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:01,696
Just tell me
what it is you want.

406
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,464
I'm sure I can get it.

407
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:07,401
I'm s-I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for whatever happened to you.

408
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:08,837
I'm sorry.

409
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,938
<i>I want you</i>
<i>to call Heather.</i>

410
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:13,407
What? Why?

411
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:17,344
<i>You have a safety box</i>
<i>at the AIG bank</i>
<i>in Tiergarten.</i>

412
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:19,514
<i>Heather is going</i>
<i>to retrieve it.</i>

413
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:21,683
This is about money?

414
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:23,150
You can get someone else.

415
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:25,285
She doesn't deserve
to be mixed up in this.

416
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:27,254
- What's going on?
- Not now, Zach.

417
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,691
<i>You don't have the luxury</i>
<i>of time to debate me.</i>

418
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:31,291
<i>Call Heather.</i>

419
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:32,493
Call Heather.

420
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:34,361
<i>And put her on speaker.</i>

421
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:41,335
<i>This is Heather. I'm not here.</i>
<i>So say something nice.</i>

422
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:44,271
Heather, it's me.

423
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:47,575
Call me back immediately.
It's urgent.

424
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,076
She's not answering.

425
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,780
<i>You're an industrious man.</i>

426
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:53,947
<i>Get ahold of her.</i>
<i>And quickly.</i>

427
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,554
Call Christina.

428
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:04,726
<i>Hello?</i>

429
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:07,629
Christina, it's Matt.
I need to speak to Heather.

430
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:10,565
<i>Heather?</i>
<i>Have you tried her phone?</i>

431
00:32:10,698 --> 00:32:12,232
She's not answering.

432
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,934
I know she's with you,
and I need to speak to her.

433
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,469
- <i>She's not with me.</i>
- Where is she?

434
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,938
I need to get
ahold of her right now.

435
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,340
- <i>Matt...</i>
- Tell me where she is.

436
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:22,610
It's a matter
of life and death.

437
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:24,378
<i>What's happened?</i>

438
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:26,947
Christina, I don't have
time to explain.

439
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,884
I need to speak
to my wife right now.

440
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:34,354
<i>She's at a divorce attorney.</i>

441
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:37,592
<i>You haven't been there</i>
<i>for her, Matt.</i>

442
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,962
What does that mean?

443
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,242
- Which one?
- <i>It's in Lichtenberg.</i>

444
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,545
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Webber something.</i>

445
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,414
<i>Matt... you didn't--</i>

446
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:09,256
<i>You have</i>
<i>two minutes to find her.</i>

447
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:11,358
<i>Then you know what happens.</i>

448
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:15,597
I found her.

449
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,599
No.

450
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:32,312
<i>Webber and Babel.</i>

451
00:33:32,446 --> 00:33:35,650
Um, I need to speak
to Heather Turner, please.

452
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:38,485
<i>I'm sorry. There's</i>
<i>no Heather Turner here.</i>

453
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,420
This is Matt Turner speaking.

454
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:43,190
I'm her husband.
This is an emergency.

455
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:45,960
I need to speak to her now.

456
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,829
<i>Well, I'm sorry, I...</i>

457
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:50,330
Our children are in trouble.

458
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,099
<i>One moment, please.</i>

459
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,638
<i>Are the kids okay?</i>

460
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:59,339
They're fine.
I had to get you on the phone.

461
00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:02,710
Listen to me.
Something's happened.

462
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,712
I need you to stay calm.

463
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:06,213
<i>You're scaring me, Matt.</i>

464
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:08,448
Just listen, please.

465
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:12,152
There's a man... there's...

466
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:16,490
There's a man
who's put a bomb in the car.

467
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:17,692
<i>What?</i>

468
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,994
We have to do
everything he says.

469
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,763
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

470
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:23,731
Heather, please.
Just listen
to what I tell you.

471
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:26,300
<i>Emily?</i>
<i>Sweetheart, are you okay?</i>

472
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,302
Heather, she's fine.
They're both fine.

473
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,772
- <i>Is Zach okay?</i>
- Yes. Yes, he's fine.

474
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:34,474
- <i>Have you called the police?</i>
- No. No, we can't.

475
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:36,143
<i>Then I'm calling them.</i>

476
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:37,645
Heather, please.

477
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:39,112
Just listen
to what I have to tell you.

478
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,114
If you call the police,
he will...

479
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:43,718
He...

480
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:46,654
Do you understand?

481
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:48,556
<i>No. I don't</i>
<i>understand, Matt.</i>

482
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,592
<i>What you're saying</i>
<i>doesn't make any sense.</i>

483
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:51,826
<i>Who is he?</i>

484
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:54,062
I don't know.

485
00:34:54,194 --> 00:34:56,296
Right now, we just
have to do what he says.

486
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,133
And everything will be
fi-fine. Okay.

487
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,870
<i>Oh, my God, Matt. What?</i>

488
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:07,307
I need you to go
to the AIG bank
in Tiergarten.

489
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:10,110
There's a safety
deposit box in my name.

490
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:11,779
<i>What?</i>

491
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:15,683
When you get there,
they will ask to speak to me.

492
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,685
You call me, okay?

493
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:19,219
<i>Then what?</i>

494
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:22,255
I don't know.

495
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:25,225
Heather, I'm...

496
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:28,796
Look, if...

497
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,033
If I wasn't
enough for you, I'm...

498
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:38,640
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

499
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:00,427
It's gonna be okay, Dad.

500
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:03,163
You bet.

501
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:07,401
Yeah.

502
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:14,341
<i>There's</i>
<i>that number-one dad again.</i>

503
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,644
<i>You better find</i>
<i>somewhere to lay low</i>

504
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:19,312
<i>until she's at your big bank.</i>

505
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,650
<i>Remember, Matt.</i>
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

506
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:25,218
<i>Don't do anything stupid.</i>

507
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:02,222
I'm waiting.

508
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,926
Hello? I'm waiting.

509
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:07,595
Hello?

510
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:49,103
<i>We've just begun</i>
<i>our investigation.</i>

511
00:37:49,237 --> 00:37:52,840
<i>Any speculation at this time</i>
<i>is just that, speculation.</i>

512
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:55,209
<i>Can you at least say</i>

513
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:56,944
<i>whether you're looking</i>
<i>for one suspect</i>
<i>or multiple suspects?</i>

514
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:59,013
<i>Everything's</i>
<i>on the table.</i>

515
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:00,982
<i>Because of the protests,</i>
<i>will you shut down the city?</i>

516
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:02,517
<i>No, not at this time.</i>

517
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,152
<i>Thank you.</i> Danke.

518
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:23,738
You worked with him too.

519
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:25,973
The first guy.
That's your company.

520
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,811
It is. Yeah.

521
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:32,580
Dad, what did you do?

522
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:35,783
Nothing.

523
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,119
Stop lying.

524
00:38:38,252 --> 00:38:39,787
This guy is trying to kill us
because of something you did.

525
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:43,090
- Look.
- I didn't do anything.

526
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:45,458
Nothing to deserve this.

527
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:49,797
Are you and Mom
getting a divorce?

528
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:52,667
What?

529
00:38:54,235 --> 00:38:55,503
No.

530
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:58,606
See? You lie.
It's what you do every day.

531
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:00,875
To Mom. To them. To us.

532
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,812
- No. I promise.
- You promise what?

533
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,815
You made me get in this car.
You made me.

534
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:12,352
I promise I will get you out.
Both of you.

535
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:15,223
Zach.

536
00:39:15,388 --> 00:39:17,124
Listen to me. I promise.

537
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:19,627
Okay.

538
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:36,577
- She's calling.
- <i>Pick up.</i>

539
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:38,980
<i>Tell her you'll meet her</i>
<i>outside the bank.</i>

540
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:42,149
<i>She hands you the money</i>
<i>and then leaves.</i>

541
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:44,719
<i>No conversation. Nothing.</i>

542
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,627
<i>I'm here at the bank.</i>
<i>They want to speak to you.</i>

543
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,729
Good. Put them on.

544
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:57,598
- <i>Mr. Turner?</i>
- Yes.

545
00:39:57,732 --> 00:39:59,267
<i>I understand your wife</i>
<i>would like to access</i>

546
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:01,535
<i>your safe deposit box</i>
<i>on your behalf?</i>

547
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:03,204
That's correct.

548
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:08,009
- The password is "Siena."
- <i>Thank you, sir.</i>

549
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:10,745
<i>What's in the box, Matt?</i>
My passport,

550
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:14,414
uh, some personal items
and 50,000 euros.

551
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:16,617
Heather, just call me
when you get out.

552
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,586
I'll be waiting
for you outside.

553
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,521
Put the money
in the passenger seat

554
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:22,556
- and walk away.
- <i>I...</i>

555
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,991
- I'm serious.
- <i>Okay.</i>

556
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:27,695
And Heather...
listen to me.

557
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,765
The kids are going to be okay.
I promise you.

558
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:35,403
What's Siena?

559
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:37,838
It's where I met
your mom, sweetie.

560
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:41,542
Are we gonna see Mom?

561
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:43,277
Yes, love.

562
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:46,814
But you won't be able to talk
to her right now. Okay?

563
00:40:57,525 --> 00:40:59,293
Matt, I'm coming out.

564
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:03,664
Look down the street.

565
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:05,465
<i>Do you see us?</i>

566
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:07,201
Uh...

567
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:15,242
Yes.

568
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:19,680
Mom. Mom.

569
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:23,517
I've got it.

570
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:25,386
<i>Change of plan.</i>

571
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,824
<i>There's a man in a blue suit</i>
<i>sitting alone on a bench.</i>

572
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:32,827
<i>Tell her to go to him</i>
<i>and give him the bag.</i>

573
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,895
That's not what you said.

574
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,430
<i>I give the instructions.</i>

575
00:41:36,564 --> 00:41:38,065
She does that
and she walks free?

576
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,166
You give me your word?

577
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,002
<i>Of course.</i>

578
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:42,770
Heather.

579
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:44,438
<i>There's a man sitting</i>
<i>on a bench in the square.</i>

580
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:46,941
<i>He's wearing a blue suit.</i>
<i>Do you see him?</i>

581
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:48,175
Yes.

582
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:50,177
Give him the money.
Then walk away.

583
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:51,912
<i>What about you</i>
<i>and the kids?</i>

584
00:41:52,046 --> 00:41:54,482
We'll be fine.
Just... just do it, please.

585
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:57,551
Okay.

586
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:04,558
It's all...
it's all there.

587
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:05,826
Excuse me?

588
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,661
The money,
it's all there.

589
00:42:07,795 --> 00:42:09,130
What...
what money?

590
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:16,837
What? What? What?

591
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,374
No.

592
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:23,110
- Dad, why are they
doing that? Dad, help her!
- No, no. No!

593
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:25,546
Wait. Wait.

594
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:28,015
<i>Drive!</i>

595
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:45,299
I didn't call them, I swear.
Please believe me.

596
00:42:45,433 --> 00:42:46,901
<i>I called them.</i>

597
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:51,806
- Why?
- <i>There is no why.</i>

598
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:54,208
You didn't want me
to see Sylvain die.

599
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:57,144
You wanted me
to be seen there.

600
00:42:57,278 --> 00:42:59,180
My car. Me.

601
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:01,115
<i>Trust me, Matt,</i>
<i>you're not as smart</i>
<i>as you think you are,</i>

602
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:03,250
<i>or your escape plan</i>
<i>would involve</i>

603
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:06,387
<i>more than a safety</i>
<i>deposit box</i>
<i>at a local bank.</i>

604
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:09,657
- What escape plan?
- <i>Take your money and run.</i>

605
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,992
<i>Your investors' money.</i>
<i>Dubai.</i>

606
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:13,562
Dubai?

607
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:15,996
<i>The little slush fund</i>
<i>that you and Anders have,</i>

608
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,099
<i>safe and tucked away</i>
<i>in the desert.</i>

609
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:21,702
<i>208 million euros</i>
<i>emergency collateral.</i>

610
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:31,145
What is this?

611
00:43:32,514 --> 00:43:34,849
Hey, I asked you a question.

612
00:43:34,982 --> 00:43:37,519
<i>I think we should</i>
<i>talk to your boss.</i>

613
00:43:38,786 --> 00:43:40,921
Anders? Why?

614
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:43,724
<i>If you can't help me,</i>
<i>maybe he can.</i>

615
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,561
I don't think this is a--

616
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:49,096
<i>This is no time</i>
<i>to start playing games, Matt.</i>

617
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,333
<i>He's already</i>
<i>waiting for you. Drive.</i>

618
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:17,291
Hey, asshole.
Can you hear me?

619
00:44:19,894 --> 00:44:22,329
Zach, look at this photo.

620
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:23,697
Am I seeing it right?

621
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:25,900
Does that look
like a phone to you?

622
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,204
Yeah, I think so.

623
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,139
Good. Good.

624
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:35,309
- A phone.
- Is that good?

625
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:38,746
Yeah. It might be.

626
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:41,448
Great. More phones.

627
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,919
- Dad?
- Yes, baby?

628
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:46,387
You called him an asshole.

629
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,158
Good.

630
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:56,197
- Shit. Dad?
- Yeah?

631
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:00,100
You're on TV.

632
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:17,051
Hello? Hello?

633
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:22,456
- Heather.
- <i>Mr. Turner,</i>

634
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:25,627
<i>this is Angela Brickmann</i>
<i>with Europol.</i>

635
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:27,027
Europol?

636
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:29,063
<i>I'm with your wife.</i>

637
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:31,031
<i>I've got to say, we're all</i>
<i>very concerned about you.</i>

638
00:45:31,165 --> 00:45:33,234
I'm not responsible
for all this.

639
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:35,570
<i>That's good to hear.</i>
<i>I believe you.</i>

640
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:37,171
Do not patronize me.

641
00:45:37,304 --> 00:45:38,939
I'm telling you,
I'm innocent.

642
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:41,342
<i>If that's the case,</i>
<i>letting your children go</i>

643
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:42,910
<i>would be a great way</i>
<i>to demonstrate that.</i>

644
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:45,846
- I can't.
- <i>And why is that?</i>

645
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,649
This isn't
what it looks like.

646
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:50,417
<i>Tell me what it looks like.</i>

647
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,152
There's a bomb in my car.

648
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:55,055
- <i>Like the others?</i>
- Yes.

649
00:45:55,189 --> 00:45:58,325
<i>Matt, you can</i>
<i>let your children go.</i>

650
00:45:58,459 --> 00:45:59,728
It's not me.

651
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,630
You have to believe me.
There's a man--

652
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:04,431
<i>Who called you, your wife says</i>
<i>that's what you told her.</i>

653
00:46:04,566 --> 00:46:06,467
<i>It's not my job</i>
<i>to believe you,</i>
<i>Mr. Turner.</i>

654
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:08,536
<i>It's my job to stop</i>
<i>people from dying,</i>

655
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,038
<i>and to get</i>
<i>your children out safely.</i>

656
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,074
<i>I have to trust you.</i>

657
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,644
God damn it,
listen to me.

658
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:17,344
<i>I'm listening.</i>

659
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:19,913
Can you stop cell phones
from working?

660
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:23,384
<i>Now, why would I do that</i>
<i>if I could? We wouldn't</i>
<i>be able to talk.</i>

661
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:27,756
Because the bomb appears
to have cell phone failsafe.

662
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:30,324
A pressure plate
and cell phone, okay?

663
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:33,460
- <i>And?</i>
- Then he can't detonate it.

664
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:37,031
- <i>Who is he?</i>
- Listen to me.
Shut off the phones!

665
00:46:37,164 --> 00:46:39,199
<i>I want to help you, Matt,</i>
<i>but I can't do that.</i>

666
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,536
- <i>Emergency services, police...</i>
<i>- Matt?</i>

667
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,237
- ... <i>you aren't the only man...</i>
- <i>Answer me.</i>

668
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,239
You hung up?

669
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,108
- What if they could've
helped us?
- <i>Ten,</i>

670
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:50,277
- <i>nine, eight...</i>
- I'm here.

671
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:52,580
I'm here.
What do you want?

672
00:46:52,714 --> 00:46:54,114
<i>You think I'm stupid?</i>

673
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:55,617
<i>Taking your time?</i>

674
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,052
<i>You better drive faster.</i>

675
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:01,656
Two minutes.

676
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,660
The police come to help us
and he finds out,

677
00:47:05,794 --> 00:47:06,960
you know what he'll do.

678
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:09,496
- Will he kill us?
- Oh, God.

679
00:47:10,632 --> 00:47:11,865
No, honey.

680
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:14,335
No. I'm... just...

681
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:18,138
I can't risk you.
You understand?

682
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:21,375
I won't risk you.

683
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:23,712
I can help us.

684
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:25,879
I can help us.

685
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:43,290
- We're here.
- <i>Patience, Matt.</i>

686
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:03,444
<i>Put him on speaker.</i>

687
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:09,016
Call Anders.

688
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:18,626
Matt...

689
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,329
Why are you doing this?

690
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,833
<i>Anders.</i>

691
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:26,568
What have I ever done to you?

692
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:34,074
Nothing, nothing. Listen...

693
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,409
What kind of fucking psycho

694
00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:37,311
does this to his own
best friend?

695
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:40,113
<i>And you brought your kids!</i>

696
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:43,551
Anders, it's gonna be
okay. Just...

697
00:49:43,685 --> 00:49:44,953
<i>just look at me.</i>

698
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:47,020
- <i>Hey. Hey.</i>
- Jesus.

699
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,957
Matt, why?

700
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:52,059
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

701
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:56,263
<i>Tell him to authorize</i>
<i>liquidating</i>
<i>your collateral account.</i>

702
00:49:58,098 --> 00:50:02,169
That isn't my money.
I didn't steal it.
It's the clients'.

703
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:04,539
If you're punishing me,
you should know that.

704
00:50:04,672 --> 00:50:08,375
<i>Matt, just...</i>
<i>tell me what you want.</i>

705
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,513
If I did something
to piss you off, I'm sorry.

706
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:13,781
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Did you hear me?

707
00:50:13,915 --> 00:50:16,951
<i>Tell him to authorize.</i>
<i>Matt.</i>

708
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:19,019
I said I'm sorry, Matt.

709
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:22,757
Anders, listen.

710
00:50:22,891 --> 00:50:24,526
<i>I need you to authorize</i>

711
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:28,028
<i>liquidating the emergency</i>
<i>collateral account.</i>

712
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:29,697
The Dubai fund. All of it.

713
00:50:30,899 --> 00:50:31,833
Jesus Christ.

714
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:34,034
That's what this is about?

715
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:35,537
You did this for money?

716
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:39,139
<i>Tell him if he doesn't,</i>

717
00:50:39,273 --> 00:50:41,141
<i>you'll kill him.</i>

718
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,012
You killed them for money?

719
00:50:44,144 --> 00:50:48,583
<i>Tell him to do it,</i>
<i>or I kill you</i>
<i>and your kids.</i>

720
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:55,389
Anders...

721
00:50:57,992 --> 00:50:59,293
do it.

722
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:04,799
Authorize liquidation,
or I will...

723
00:51:04,933 --> 00:51:06,501
<i>Now.</i>

724
00:51:08,302 --> 00:51:09,904
<i>Authorize liquidation</i>

725
00:51:10,038 --> 00:51:13,173
or I will...
kill you.

726
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:21,181
I will kill you.

727
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:23,685
Okay.

728
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:26,486
Okay. I'm doing
what you want,
all right?

729
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:30,490
<i>I'm calling, Matt.</i>
<i>Just... hold on.</i>

730
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:31,526
Do it.

731
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:36,864
<i>Once he authorizes,</i>
<i>you'll do the same</i>

732
00:51:36,998 --> 00:51:39,333
<i>and you'll transfer me</i>
<i>the money.</i>

733
00:51:39,466 --> 00:51:40,668
<i>It's that simple.</i>

734
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:45,573
As soon as he does it,
you'll let him go. Yes?

735
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:50,344
Are you listening?
He's doing what you want.

736
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:53,615
Okay, okay. It's done.

737
00:51:53,748 --> 00:51:56,450
<i>Matt, I said</i>
<i>it's all done, okay?</i>

738
00:51:56,584 --> 00:51:58,519
He did what you wanted.
It's over.

739
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:01,756
Once I confirm
the authorization,

740
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:03,024
you get it all.

741
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,892
All the money you want.

742
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:06,493
208 million euros.

743
00:52:06,628 --> 00:52:09,129
You'll let us all go, yes?

744
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:10,999
Just tell me
where you want the money.

745
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,233
I'll authorize,
I'll send it.

746
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:15,069
Dad, it's over?

747
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,438
<i>Open the glove box.</i>

748
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:19,974
What?

749
00:52:20,108 --> 00:52:22,175
<i>Open the glove box.</i>

750
00:52:23,077 --> 00:52:24,646
Oh, Jesus.

751
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:31,485
<i>You see what's inside?</i>

752
00:52:32,787 --> 00:52:33,888
<i>Take it.</i>

753
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,564
<i>Shoot him.</i>

754
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:45,667
Dad?

755
00:52:49,202 --> 00:52:50,805
What...

756
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:52,907
I'm not doing this.

757
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,878
<i>His life or yours.</i>

758
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:58,946
<i>Matt!</i>

759
00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:01,616
I did what you wanted!

760
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:02,950
Dad.

761
00:53:03,084 --> 00:53:06,954
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

762
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,958
- Dad, don't.
- May God forgive me.

763
00:53:11,092 --> 00:53:13,360
<i>Matt, let me go.</i>

764
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:14,729
Dad, what are you doing?

765
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:15,997
<i>...seven...</i>

766
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,330
<i>...six...</i>

767
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:18,933
- Shit!
- Dad, don't do this.

768
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:21,502
- <i>...five...</i>
<i>- Please!</i>

769
00:53:21,636 --> 00:53:23,270
- Dad, don't.
- <i>...four...</i>

770
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:25,106
Dad, don't do this, okay?
He's your friend.

771
00:53:25,238 --> 00:53:27,175
- <i>Matt, let me get out.</i>
- Dad, he's your friend.

772
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:29,342
- Don't do this!
- <i>...three...</i>

773
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:32,613
God... God forgive me.

774
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:36,184
- Please. God forgive me.
- Matt! Let me go!

775
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:38,485
- <i>...two...</i>
- Dad! Dad,
he's your friend!

776
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:40,253
What are you doing?

777
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:41,622
Dad, don't!

778
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:45,459
- <i>Shoot him. Now.</i>
- I can't.

779
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:38,478
Are you okay?

780
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:40,214
Yeah, I'm good.

781
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:42,984
Emily? Em, are you okay?

782
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:45,653
Emily?

783
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:47,287
Em! Em!

784
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,091
Oh, shit.
Shit! Shit! Shit!

785
00:54:50,224 --> 00:54:51,526
It's her leg.
Dad, it's her leg.

786
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:54,361
- Here. Here.
- It's bleeding.

787
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:57,031
Oh, God.
Here, here, here.

788
00:54:57,165 --> 00:54:58,800
Use this.
Tie it, tie it.

789
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:00,701
What?

790
00:55:00,835 --> 00:55:03,671
Her leg. Tie it.
Tie it above the wound.

791
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:05,206
- Dad, I'm okay.
- Tie it tight.

792
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:06,707
- It has to be tight.
- Okay.

793
00:55:08,242 --> 00:55:09,409
Zach, I'm okay.

794
00:55:09,544 --> 00:55:10,745
- Em.
- Dad, I'm okay.

795
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:13,413
- Em, baby. Look at me.
- I'm okay.

796
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:15,149
- Tight! Tight!
- Are you ready?

797
00:55:15,283 --> 00:55:17,185
I'm sorry.

798
00:55:20,188 --> 00:55:21,556
Hang on, baby.

799
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:23,691
- Hang on, baby. Okay, okay.
- I'm okay.

800
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:25,726
- I'm fine.
- Hang on, baby.

801
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,460
We're gonna get you
some help.

802
00:55:27,595 --> 00:55:29,130
I'm fine.

803
00:55:29,263 --> 00:55:31,532
<i>You're a murderer now, Matt.</i>

804
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:55,990
<i>Make the phone call, Matt.</i>

805
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:58,526
<i>Your half of the liquidation</i>
<i>authorization.</i>

806
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,262
Son of a bitch.
I will kill you.

807
00:56:01,394 --> 00:56:02,864
<i>Really?</i>

808
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:07,301
<i>Well, Matt,</i>
<i>that'll make four people</i>

809
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:08,936
<i>that you've killed today.</i>

810
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,872
No. Just the one.

811
00:56:16,244 --> 00:56:17,645
Dad.

812
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:31,225
- <i>Make the call. Now.</i>
- Fuck you.

813
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:03,925
It's gonna be okay.
I promise.

814
00:57:05,026 --> 00:57:07,561
- Em, look at me.
It's gonna be okay.
- Hold on, Em. Okay?

815
00:57:07,695 --> 00:57:10,765
- <i>Make the call or you die.</i>
- No.

816
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,934
You hurt my daughter,
you scumbag.

817
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:15,736
You want that money?
You need me.

818
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,676
I meet you face to face.
When I'm ready.

819
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,386
First, I help my child.

820
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,057
- Then you get your money.
- <i>I'm in control here.</i>

821
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,591
No, you're not.

822
00:57:38,426 --> 00:57:41,461
Em. Em, hold on,
okay? Hold on.

823
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:57,144
<i>You do what I say or...</i>

824
00:57:58,612 --> 00:58:00,514
<i>...or I will kill you...</i>

825
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,912
Come on.
Come on. God damn it.

826
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:42,890
Come on.

827
00:58:58,272 --> 00:58:59,707
Come on.

828
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:26,100
Shit.

829
01:00:12,547 --> 01:00:13,481
Em, Em.

830
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:14,682
Stay awake, sweetie.

831
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:16,150
It's almost over.

832
01:00:17,118 --> 01:00:18,252
I'm tired.

833
01:00:18,385 --> 01:00:20,589
I know you are, baby,
but you have to try.

834
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:23,324
You have to try it.
Please, please.

835
01:00:42,511 --> 01:00:44,678
Oh, my God.

836
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:46,680
Oh.

837
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:49,750
It's my family.

838
01:00:49,884 --> 01:00:52,453
It's Mom.
What are they waiting for?

839
01:00:52,587 --> 01:00:54,288
They think I'm the bomber.

840
01:00:54,421 --> 01:00:56,390
Then tell them you're not.
Tell them about the guy
on the phone.

841
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:58,192
I'll try.

842
01:00:58,325 --> 01:00:59,561
Try? I'll tell them.

843
01:00:59,693 --> 01:01:00,895
Hey! Help us!

844
01:01:01,028 --> 01:01:03,330
My sister!
My Dad didn't do it!

845
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:07,968
Zach, no one else
has heard this guy.

846
01:01:08,102 --> 01:01:09,770
Turn off your engine!

847
01:01:09,904 --> 01:01:13,240
My daughter needs help!

848
01:01:13,374 --> 01:01:14,609
She's bleeding!

849
01:01:14,742 --> 01:01:17,912
<i>Hilfe!</i> Help!
Anyone!

850
01:01:57,918 --> 01:02:01,222
It's not there.
It's under our seats.

851
01:02:01,355 --> 01:02:02,990
It's under our seats!

852
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:05,726
We have no time.

853
01:02:16,837 --> 01:02:19,240
This is going to take
way too long.

854
01:02:19,373 --> 01:02:21,208
No, we haven't got
the time for this.

855
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:28,983
Please.

856
01:03:22,504 --> 01:03:23,738
Everyone okay?

857
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:27,408
My daughter's hurt.
She's lost a lot of blood.

858
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:30,110
We need help. Now.

859
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:33,347
How you doing,
sweetheart?

860
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:36,718
Good girl.

861
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:40,588
We have EMTs right here.
We'll get her seen to
real soon.

862
01:03:40,722 --> 01:03:42,524
Then bring them in now.

863
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:50,264
You've got
everybody's attention, Matt.

864
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:54,368
A lot of people here
are worried about you.

865
01:03:54,502 --> 01:03:55,869
Especially Heather.

866
01:03:57,104 --> 01:03:58,939
She just wants
to see her family again,

867
01:03:59,073 --> 01:04:00,542
and I want
to make sure she does.

868
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,911
I'm here to help you.

869
01:04:06,113 --> 01:04:08,148
I just need to know
you're not gonna,

870
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:10,685
you know,
do something crazy.

871
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:13,487
I mean, you go, I go.

872
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:21,995
- And I have a family too.
- Hey...

873
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:24,998
My Dad didn't do
any of this, okay?

874
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:26,433
There's this psycho
on the phone

875
01:04:26,568 --> 01:04:28,969
- talking into his ear.
- Zach...

876
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:32,306
You see all that?

877
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:35,275
I have a lot going on here.

878
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:37,978
I'm just gonna
talk to your dad here
for a minute, okay?

879
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:40,881
I promise
I'll talk to you too.

880
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:44,918
Zach, it's okay.
I... I didn't do this.

881
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,387
I wouldn't.

882
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:49,256
Matt. Can I call you Matt,
Mr. Turner?

883
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,891
Call me whatever you want.

884
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:53,227
Just get us out of this car.

885
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,262
Your children
can get out right now

886
01:04:55,396 --> 01:04:57,665
if that's all right, Matt.

887
01:04:57,799 --> 01:04:59,601
The car will explode.

888
01:05:00,702 --> 01:05:02,970
I see. If they get out,
the car explodes.

889
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:15,717
Under our seats,
there are pressure triggers.

890
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:18,452
Well, our friends here
are looking into that,
aren't they?

891
01:05:18,586 --> 01:05:21,455
You turned off the phones,
yeah?

892
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,201
We've jammed cell signal
for five blocks.
You should be honored.

893
01:05:34,334 --> 01:05:35,770
They haven't interrupted

894
01:05:35,904 --> 01:05:39,339
the telephone service
in Berlin since 1945.

895
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,610
Nice to unplug for a minute.

896
01:05:54,722 --> 01:05:57,559
You say that he
called you on that?

897
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:00,461
Do you know who he is?

898
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:02,864
If I knew that,
I would tell you.

899
01:06:02,996 --> 01:06:04,866
Just get them out.

900
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:06,668
Look at my daughter, please.

901
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:12,105
Okay.

902
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:15,710
They think
the doors are clear.

903
01:06:15,844 --> 01:06:17,211
We'd like to open them.

904
01:06:45,974 --> 01:06:48,141
So, three colleagues
from your company

905
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:50,043
die in one day,
but not you.

906
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:53,681
I didn't do this.
I didn't set off
those bombs.

907
01:06:53,815 --> 01:06:55,382
Okay. Understood.

908
01:06:58,553 --> 01:07:00,220
It's gonna be okay, okay?

909
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:02,089
But why would
someone do this to you?

910
01:07:02,222 --> 01:07:03,725
- I'll have a look
under your seat now.
- Why you, Matt?

911
01:07:03,858 --> 01:07:05,627
To punish you?

912
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,595
- Money.
 - You can get money robbing a bank...

913
01:07:07,729 --> 01:07:12,734
...or working
a fancy job like yours.

914
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:14,167
Not this kind of money.

915
01:07:16,103 --> 01:07:17,639
What kind of money?

916
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:26,446
Trust, Matt.
I need trust.

917
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:30,518
You've had a lot of losses
for your clients,

918
01:07:30,652 --> 01:07:32,085
but you still have
a nice car.

919
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:34,221
Do I?

920
01:07:36,323 --> 01:07:38,292
Well, I guess
you've had a tough day.

921
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:40,662
A tough week?
A tough year?

922
01:07:41,996 --> 01:07:44,732
How much did your clients
lose this year?

923
01:07:44,866 --> 01:07:47,200
We all lost this year.

924
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:51,405
Well, I know that you
and your recent colleagues

925
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:53,841
lost a lot of money
for your trusting clients

926
01:07:53,975 --> 01:07:55,810
who invested in your fund,

927
01:07:55,944 --> 01:07:58,713
yet you kept
making promises.

928
01:07:58,846 --> 01:08:02,349
Promises
that profits would appear.

929
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:05,352
Maybe he's an angry client.

930
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:07,487
"An angry client." Mm.

931
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:10,792
What kind of money
did you say he wanted?

932
01:08:10,925 --> 01:08:12,627
Just hurry up, please.

933
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,828
What kind of money?

934
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:17,765
208 million euros.

935
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:22,804
All Nanite Capital accounts
have been frozen.

936
01:08:22,937 --> 01:08:26,507
So, how does he plan
to access this money?

937
01:08:26,641 --> 01:08:29,343
The account's based
in Dubai.

938
01:08:29,476 --> 01:08:32,212
It's outside
your jurisdiction.

939
01:08:32,346 --> 01:08:34,214
Who knows
about this account?

940
01:08:35,148 --> 01:08:36,884
Partners in the firm.

941
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:38,553
How many are still alive?

942
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:44,124
Just me.

943
01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:46,060
It's clear
back here. No device.

944
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:47,862
No pressure plates
in the back.

945
01:08:47,996 --> 01:08:49,797
He said it was
under our seats.

946
01:08:52,533 --> 01:08:53,901
What are you waiting for?

947
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:03,343
We're getting your children
out now, but...

948
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:04,879
Please, hurry.

949
01:09:05,013 --> 01:09:06,648
But the bomb under your seat

950
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:09,550
is hardwired
to the seat sensors.

951
01:09:09,684 --> 01:09:11,151
Even if we take out
the car battery,

952
01:09:11,284 --> 01:09:12,954
shut down the car's CPI,

953
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:16,323
you get up, it will
still trigger the bomb.

954
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:17,759
Grab my shoulder.

955
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:20,728
There you go, Em.
Em, go. It's okay.

956
01:09:22,063 --> 01:09:24,364
Baby, it's okay.
It's okay, baby.

957
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:26,801
It's okay. I love you.

958
01:09:31,304 --> 01:09:32,740
Dad.

959
01:09:35,977 --> 01:09:38,513
Dad, I'm not gonna
leave you.

960
01:09:40,447 --> 01:09:43,283
- Uh, I'll be fine.
- If you stay, I stay.

961
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:45,586
- Go with your sister.
- Dad...

962
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,690
You just tell that girlfriend
of yours, um, Mila,

963
01:09:48,823 --> 01:09:51,893
I hope I can still meet her.
Yeah?

964
01:09:52,026 --> 01:09:53,360
- I hope so too.
- Yeah.

965
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:55,830
I made a promise
I'd get you out.

966
01:09:57,165 --> 01:09:59,232
I love you, Zach.
Go on.

967
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:00,868
Love you too.

968
01:10:01,002 --> 01:10:02,737
I'm gonna fix this.

969
01:10:04,972 --> 01:10:06,273
Good boy.

970
01:10:15,683 --> 01:10:17,552
Mom.

971
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:20,988
- I'm okay.
- Oh, sweetie.

972
01:10:29,597 --> 01:10:31,465
Can it be deactivated?

973
01:10:31,599 --> 01:10:32,967
We're still working on it.

974
01:10:33,101 --> 01:10:34,736
Can I talk to my wife?

975
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:38,005
You will.
When we get you out.

976
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:42,110
I need to talk
to her. Please.

977
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,450
Okay.

978
01:10:56,657 --> 01:10:59,392
- Ma'am?
- Oh. Oh.

979
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:02,329
Thank you.

980
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:05,499
Matt?

981
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:08,002
Honey...

982
01:11:08,136 --> 01:11:09,137
Are you okay?

983
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:12,240
Uh, I've had better days.

984
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:18,946
I didn't do this.
I want you to know that.

985
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,583
Matt, just do whatever
the police say.

986
01:11:22,717 --> 01:11:25,318
<i>Just listen to them</i>
<i>and they'll get you out,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

987
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:27,822
You have to do as they say.

988
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:33,393
<i>Matt?</i>

989
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:35,930
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about everything.

990
01:11:37,165 --> 01:11:38,966
<i>I-I should've</i>
<i>been there for you.</i>

991
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,468
For all of you.

992
01:11:43,271 --> 01:11:44,972
Don't say that.

993
01:11:46,641 --> 01:11:48,776
I love you, baby.

994
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,077
I always have.

995
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,781
Just come home.

996
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:58,586
- <i>We'll be okay.</i>
- I will.

997
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,621
- Okay.
- Come on.

998
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:19,507
You're all here
focused on me.

999
01:12:20,675 --> 01:12:22,543
And he is still out there.

1000
01:12:22,677 --> 01:12:24,444
He's the one
that did this to me.

1001
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:26,747
You don't have
to worry about that.

1002
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:28,115
We'll find him.

1003
01:12:30,718 --> 01:12:32,553
You don't believe me.

1004
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:36,958
What I believe right now
is irrelevant.

1005
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:38,526
I can find him.

1006
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:43,030
Matt, you go into custody.
We'll work through this.

1007
01:12:43,164 --> 01:12:46,433
We'll walk through
every possibility.

1008
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:48,069
You have my word on that.

1009
01:12:50,304 --> 01:12:51,672
No.

1010
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:55,710
He set me up
and you all bought it.

1011
01:12:57,444 --> 01:13:00,014
Right now, we're trying
to get you out of this car.

1012
01:13:00,147 --> 01:13:02,149
That is my only objective.

1013
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,021
You have your objective,
and I have mine.

1014
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:11,292
If you can't find him,
I will.

1015
01:13:11,424 --> 01:13:12,360
Matt...

1016
01:13:12,526 --> 01:13:14,595
Tell them to stand down.

1017
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:20,635
Tell them to stand down.

1018
01:13:20,768 --> 01:13:23,304
Matt, if you leave,
I cannot protect you.

1019
01:13:23,436 --> 01:13:24,639
I want to be clear
about that.

1020
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:26,274
Matt! Matt!

1021
01:13:26,406 --> 01:13:28,643
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1022
01:13:30,011 --> 01:13:32,980
No!

1023
01:14:01,075 --> 01:14:03,476
You hearing this?

1024
01:14:06,814 --> 01:14:10,318
You want your money.
I want my life back.

1025
01:14:15,389 --> 01:14:18,159
<i>Transfer the money. Now!</i>

1026
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:29,403
Face to face.
Or you get nothing.

1027
01:14:29,537 --> 01:14:31,639
<i>I could end this right now.</i>

1028
01:14:39,347 --> 01:14:41,816
So, what's it gonna be?

1029
01:14:43,017 --> 01:14:44,018
End it!

1030
01:14:45,586 --> 01:14:47,788
End it! End it!

1031
01:14:49,457 --> 01:14:52,093
<i>I choose the address.</i>
<i>Not you.</i>

1032
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:51,045
<i>Hello, Matt.</i>

1033
01:16:52,313 --> 01:16:55,816
<i>I just need to press send</i>
<i>and we both go up,</i>

1034
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:58,853
<i>along with a lot</i>
<i>of innocent people.</i>

1035
01:17:04,825 --> 01:17:06,127
<i>Now drive.</i>

1036
01:17:08,696 --> 01:17:10,698
<i>I said drive.</i>

1037
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:13,602
Where?

1038
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:15,836
<i>How about someplace</i>
<i>a little more quiet?</i>

1039
01:17:39,927 --> 01:17:42,229
Surprise.

1040
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,798
I told you, Matt.

1041
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:47,234
You're not as smart
as you think.

1042
01:17:49,638 --> 01:17:52,072
Jesus Christ.

1043
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:55,709
Well,
not quite water into wine,

1044
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:59,346
but I did just manage
to turn a few bodies

1045
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,482
into 208 million euros.

1046
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:07,188
I...

1047
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:12,259
I watched you die
in that explosion.

1048
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:16,764
Misdirection is at the heart
of all great magic tricks.

1049
01:18:16,897 --> 01:18:19,166
I just needed
a little distraction.

1050
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:22,169
Thankfully,
German trains run on time.

1051
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:27,408
You know, that last blast
had a little more kick

1052
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:29,310
than I expected.

1053
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:30,945
But with all that money...

1054
01:18:33,781 --> 01:18:36,083
I'll just get myself
a new face.

1055
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:40,020
You did this all for money?

1056
01:18:40,154 --> 01:18:41,623
Survival.

1057
01:18:41,755 --> 01:18:44,124
Prison's no place
for a man with my taste.

1058
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,231
I gave you
18 years of my life,

1059
01:18:50,364 --> 01:18:52,701
you son of a bitch!

1060
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:57,338
This was all inevitable, Matt.
Don't take it personally.

1061
01:18:57,471 --> 01:18:58,939
Inevitable?

1062
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:03,645
If Cinderella's slipper
fit so perfectly,

1063
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:05,913
then why did it fall off?

1064
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:09,950
Huh?

1065
01:19:11,185 --> 01:19:14,589
Anders, what happened to you?

1066
01:19:14,723 --> 01:19:16,658
You know the business
we're in, Matt.

1067
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:20,461
It's kill or be killed.
Your words.

1068
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:24,198
Don't go thinking
you're different than me.

1069
01:19:24,331 --> 01:19:26,834
You're the murderer,
not me.

1070
01:19:30,672 --> 01:19:32,072
You really think so?

1071
01:19:34,576 --> 01:19:36,110
Are you sure about that?

1072
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:39,913
<i>Anders, authorize liquidation,</i>

1073
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:41,448
<i>or I will...</i>

1074
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:44,985
<i>Authorize liquidation,</i>
<i>or I will...</i>

1075
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:46,554
<i>kill you.</i>

1076
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:50,891
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

1077
01:19:51,025 --> 01:19:52,960
<i>I'm doing what you want,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

1078
01:19:53,093 --> 01:19:56,030
<i>I'm calling, Matt.</i>
<i>Just... hold on.</i>

1079
01:19:56,163 --> 01:19:58,332
<i>Do it.</i>

1080
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:04,038
<i>Anders, I will kill you.</i>

1081
01:20:09,877 --> 01:20:12,946
All sounds
pretty convincing to me.

1082
01:20:14,882 --> 01:20:18,952
The bombs, the money.
It all points to you.

1083
01:20:20,387 --> 01:20:22,657
You know what was
the easiest thing?

1084
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:24,391
Setting up the bombs.

1085
01:20:26,393 --> 01:20:28,929
You know
there's a bomb-making service
on the dark web?

1086
01:20:29,063 --> 01:20:30,765
If you pay them a premium,

1087
01:20:30,898 --> 01:20:33,434
they'll even install it
in the car.

1088
01:20:35,936 --> 01:20:38,272
I'm five steps ahead
of everyone, Matt.

1089
01:20:38,405 --> 01:20:39,574
Make no mistake.

1090
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:46,013
Now, if you'd be so kind
and complete the transaction.

1091
01:20:46,146 --> 01:20:47,848
Transfer the money, Matt.

1092
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:54,421
The minute you try to withdraw
one cent of that money,

1093
01:20:54,556 --> 01:20:56,056
they'll know you're alive.

1094
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:58,626
It's in a crypto account.

1095
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,628
Untraceable. Impregnable.

1096
01:21:00,762 --> 01:21:01,995
You really think
I haven't thought

1097
01:21:02,129 --> 01:21:04,599
of every single
possible permutation?

1098
01:21:06,501 --> 01:21:09,504
When your kids
got in the car this morning,

1099
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:10,938
do you think I panicked?

1100
01:21:11,706 --> 01:21:14,375
The one day that you decide
to be a good daddy

1101
01:21:14,509 --> 01:21:17,645
and drive your kids
to school? No.

1102
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:20,981
I adapted. I overcame.

1103
01:21:21,115 --> 01:21:22,550
Just like I did
when Pils Kroger

1104
01:21:22,684 --> 01:21:25,085
was going to pull the rug
out from under us.

1105
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:28,055
He was going to destroy us.

1106
01:21:28,188 --> 01:21:30,090
I wasn't gonna
let that happen.

1107
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:34,428
He found out
you were siphoning money
from the offshore account.

1108
01:21:34,562 --> 01:21:37,498
The FCA doesn't look kindly
on embezzlement.

1109
01:21:37,632 --> 01:21:39,567
He...

1110
01:21:39,701 --> 01:21:42,002
he did nothing to you.

1111
01:21:43,337 --> 01:21:47,107
And what did you do
when you found out? Hmm?

1112
01:21:48,442 --> 01:21:50,512
You did nothing.

1113
01:21:50,645 --> 01:21:54,047
- You looked the other way.
- I didn't know
what you were doing.

1114
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:55,916
Don't be naive!

1115
01:21:57,217 --> 01:21:58,986
It's always been about
the bottom line for us.

1116
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:02,256
Bullshit! Everything I did
was above board.

1117
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:04,726
You really do think
you're different, don't you?

1118
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:07,762
At least I accept who I am.

1119
01:22:07,896 --> 01:22:10,230
You just lie to yourself
every day.

1120
01:22:10,364 --> 01:22:12,466
You just let it
eat away at you

1121
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,302
until your own family
doesn't recognize you.

1122
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:18,907
I'm not surprised
Heather wants to leave you.

1123
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:22,242
I'm just surprised
it took this long to do it.

1124
01:22:22,376 --> 01:22:26,146
Now stop wasting time.
Call the bank!

1125
01:22:28,148 --> 01:22:31,753
I said call the bank.
This is your last chance.

1126
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,123
I said call them.

1127
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:42,396
Call them!

1128
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:48,202
There's one thing
you didn't think of, Anders.

1129
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:55,777
What a man will do
when he's got nothing to lose.

1130
01:23:12,226 --> 01:23:13,327
Pull over, Matt.

1131
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,128
Stop!

1132
01:23:15,964 --> 01:23:17,732
- Stop!
- No, no.

1133
01:23:17,866 --> 01:23:19,166
- I said stop!
- No.

1134
01:23:19,299 --> 01:23:21,034
Pull over
or I'll kill us both!

1135
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,771
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Heather.

1136
01:23:23,905 --> 01:23:25,138
Pull over!

1137
01:24:03,678 --> 01:24:05,547
Come here. Come here.

1138
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:57,992
<i>The city</i>
<i>woke up to an explosion</i>

1139
01:25:58,126 --> 01:26:00,528
- <i>in Tiergarten this morning.</i>
<i>- By the time it was over...</i>

1140
01:26:00,662 --> 01:26:03,296
<i>...a total</i>
<i>of four bombs rocked the city</i>
<i>in as many hours.</i>

1141
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,932
<i>Initially thought to be</i>

1142
01:26:05,066 --> 01:26:06,868
<i>...the elaborate</i>
<i>money heist</i>

1143
01:26:07,001 --> 01:26:09,604
<i>involved Nanite Capital's</i>
<i>CEO Anders Muller.</i>

1144
01:26:09,737 --> 01:26:12,372
<i>The money was to be</i>
<i>transferred through crypto</i>
<i>accounts to avoid detection.</i>

1145
01:26:12,507 --> 01:26:14,842
<i>Now a new</i>
<i>development regarding</i>

1146
