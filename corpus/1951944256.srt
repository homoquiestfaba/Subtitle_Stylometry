1
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,057
I know, Soren.
You don't have to say it.

2
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,333
We're behind schedule,
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,099
I need your signature
on these,

4
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,336
there are some RSVPs
you need to accept or decline,

5
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,344
and I'm a little concerned
about the calendar on your return.

6
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,606
Soren...

7
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,214
where is the queen?

8
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,116
Conveniently, she too
is behind schedule.

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,850
Move the interview to noon.
I visit the orphanage at nine...

10
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,359
I'm not changing that...
and I'll be back on Monday.

11
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,656
Still no word
from Copenhagen Hospital?

12
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,368
Queen Paige.

13
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,803
King Edvard.

14
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,075
I feel as if
I haven't seen you in ages.

15
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,707
You haven't.

16
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,718
You've been a very busy king.

17
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,047
And a terrible husband,

18
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,454
making you wait this long
for your honeymoon.

19
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,718
I should be ashamed.

20
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,123
You should.

21
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,785
I am.

22
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,989
Couldn't get government
to shut down for me.

23
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,766
Then what good is it being king?

24
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:16,995
Precisely.

25
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,875
Pardon the interruption,
Your Majesties,

26
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,275
but if you do intend
to go on your honeymoon,

27
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,644
you might want
to catch your plane.

28
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,663
I don't think I've ever had
a Christmas without snow.

29
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,224
I think I'm going to miss it.

30
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,530
What, on a secluded island?

31
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,633
Ohh!
Eddie, I can't wait. Really.

32
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,703
It's just different. I've...
I've always had a white Christmas.

33
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,545
But the island's going to be great,
as long as I'm with you.

34
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,681
Personally...

35
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,223
I don't like the sun.

36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm fair, you see.

37
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,098
Yes, we see, Soren.
Thank you.

38
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,850
Oh, dear.

39
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,820
Is that the prime minister?

40
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,862
What is he doing here?

41
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,372
Taking advantage
of a photo opportunity.

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,237
Probably wants
to come along.

43
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,140
Queen Paige, give us a smile.

44
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,705
- Your Majesty.
- John. How was your trip?

45
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,307
Exhilarating, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,716
Where did you go?

47
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,949
- On a tour of the north country.
- Sounds lovely.

48
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,787
But I'm delaying you. I only wanted
to wish you well on your honeymoon,

49
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:57,421
and to present my queen
with an early Christmas gift.

50
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,897
Oh, that's very sweet.
What is it?

51
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,298
It's a little guide to royal protocol:

52
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,303
tips, notes, suggestions.

53
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,935
Thought I was doing pretty good
for a farm girl from Wisconsin.

54
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,637
I think the queen is doing
a wonderful job.

55
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,478
Yes, well, we all have room
for improvement, don't we?

56
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,747
Goodness knows your schedule
will be busy enough when you get back.

57
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,254
I'm hoping to start
at Copenhagen Hospital.

58
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,086
Oh.

59
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,117
I just assumed that your medical career
would be put on hold.

60
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,756
Being queen is not
a part-time position.

61
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,926
Well, it's lucky for us, then,
that the queen is so talented

62
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,629
and versatile.

63
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,002
Mm, we are lucky.

64
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,667
Well, Your Majesties.

65
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,445
If I may, Your Majesty,

66
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,174
at no point in the last six months

67
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,773
did I believe
you would benefit from a...

68
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,115
"how to be a queen" manual.

69
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,347
Thank you, Soren.

70
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,814
Your Majesty!

71
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,620
Your Majesty, how did you choose
the Caribbean for your honeymoon?

72
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,888
Will you be making
any other stops, Your Majesty?

73
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,960
Soren, who else knows
where we're going?

74
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,397
Apart from everyone?

75
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,698
I'm afraid the royal honeymoon
is rather big news.

76
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,629
What is it, Paige?

77
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,866
Eddie...

78
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,907
I just want to be alone with you.

79
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,409
Then I have an idea.

80
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,643
Soren.

81
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,990
Well, but, sir, what about
all my arrangements?

82
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,051
- Eddie?
- Shh. Surprise.

83
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,064
Very well, sir.

84
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,433
I'll alert the pilot.

85
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,733
Of course I got the monarch
to sign it. He had no choice.

86
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,340
The royal couple
suspects nothing.

87
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,179
<i>They're off on their honeymoon,</i>
<i>and by the time they return,</i>

88
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,684
<i>it will be too late.</i>

89
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,912
Good.

90
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,012
The equipment
is already arriving.

91
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,522
When you give the word,

92
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,423
my men will be ready
to take it all down.

93
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,586
<i>Excellent.</i>

94
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,525
Hello.

95
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,127
Shoo!

96
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,861
Shoo!

97
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,808
It's a small gem of a country,
buried in the mountains,

98
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,821
under the protection of the Crown
for 350 years now.

99
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:41,883
A little behind the times,
but beautiful, remote, as you can see.

100
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,329
I haven't been here since I was young.

101
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,559
Oh, it looks perfect.
I can't wait!

102
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,979
Belavia.

103
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,413
Oh, Eddie!

104
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,349
It's beautiful!

105
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,464
Well, it's, uh... desolate.

106
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,834
Secluded.

107
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,272
Hmm. Perhaps we should have
landed at the main airport,

108
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,038
or at least arranged a... car.

109
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,670
I like the adventure of it all.

110
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,011
Do you know this is
the first time in years

111
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,482
that I've arrived somewhere

112
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,645
and wasn't greeted
by a parade or a band...

113
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,655
not counting Wisconsin,
of course.

114
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,712
How does it feel?

115
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,052
Well, kind of...

116
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,387
liberating.

117
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,724
No paparazzi.

118
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,991
No politicians.

119
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,692
No one to see me do this!

120
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,693
No one to hear me do this!

121
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,705
Hello, Belavia!

122
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,539
Except for the pilot,

123
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,238
about whom I completely forgot.

124
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,846
Oh, Queen Paige,

125
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,352
you've done it now.

126
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,264
So, tell me again
why we sent that plane back.

127
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,536
No luck?

128
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,046
Well, they're all gone in there.
Early Christmas vacation, I guess.

129
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,446
And this... is useless.

130
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,911
Someone will be along.

131
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,511
We could literally
freeze to death before then.

132
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,457
Speaking of which, I'm not sure we've
brought the right attire for Belavia.

133
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,961
Those new bikinis of yours,
for instance.

134
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,922
Did you know that
no one will shake my hand

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,763
unless I extend it first?

136
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,860
I don't know why you're
reading that thing.

137
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,370
Just learning how to be a queen.

138
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,339
Complicated stuff.

139
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,069
Look. Look! We're rescued.

140
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,542
You must be joking.

141
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,112
You're not joking.

142
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,475
Okay.

143
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,653
Hello.

144
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,525
Are you going into town?

145
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,760
I don't think he speaks English.

146
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,132
Hello!

147
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,273
Hotel? Belavia... you take us?

148
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,901
Yes.

149
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,943
Don't look so pleased
with yourself, Miss Translator.

150
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,509
What'll we do about the bags?

151
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:58,580
Uh, the bags...
can you take the bags?

152
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,028
Okay.

153
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,665
Okay, okay.
He seems to think it's okay.

154
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,106
Yeah, well, I got that part.

155
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,542
I suppose we could send someone
for them when we get to the hotel.

156
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,850
Um...

157
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,260
Could we, uh... slow down a bit?

158
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,566
What's the international sign for

159
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,967
"Please don't kill us
in your small, brown cart?"

160
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,369
Eddie, look,
there's a wild goat.

161
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,406
We must be near
the nature preserve.

162
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,571
Ho!

163
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,905
Ho!

164
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,544
Thank you.

165
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,779
This is great!

166
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,719
That was, uh...

167
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,949
Goodbye!

168
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,581
That was... that was fun.

169
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,787
Bye-bye.

170
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,262
Brrr!

171
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,237
- Oh, wow, this is nice.
- Great!

172
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,772
Look at all the decorations.

173
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,303
Hello?

174
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,472
Hey.

175
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,809
That...

176
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,444
is my great-great-great...

177
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,080
great-grandfather.

178
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,751
He was the one who put Belavia
under the protection of the Crown.

179
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:18,627
And that is the Belavian monarch,
Prince Georgiev.

180
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,633
I'm sorry. You startled me.

181
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,264
Oh, English!
I think you give me heart attack!

182
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,501
I'm sorry. We were just
looking at the portrait.

183
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,975
And you yell in my ear.

184
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,306
I know.

185
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,812
I mean, I'm sorry.

186
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,042
Do I know you?

187
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,140
Um...

188
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,780
Uh... I don't believe so.

189
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,846
We actually
just need a room.

190
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,689
Yes, I do.

191
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,988
I know you.

192
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,529
Oh, my king and queen!

193
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,007
I'm sorry I did not recognize you.

194
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,806
And I said I'm having a heart attack!

195
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,471
I'm feeling much better now.

196
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,038
How could I not know
you are gracing my hotel?

197
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,481
Nobody knows.

198
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,145
Yeah, our being here
is a bit of a secret.

199
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,212
Just avoiding the paparazzi,
you understand.

200
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,450
- Ah. Nosy people.
- Yes.

201
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,959
Marcellus understands.
You have come to the right place.

202
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,654
No one will bother you here.

203
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,664
So, what can Marcellus do
for his king and queen?

204
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,461
Well, actually, there is one thing.

205
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,527
We had to leave our bags
at the side of the road by the airport.

206
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,301
- Airstrip.
- Right. Airstrip.

207
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,399
See, there wasn't
enough room in the cart.

208
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,842
You leave your bags
on the road?

209
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,937
On the side of the road.

210
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,006
Yes, seemed like
a really good idea at the time.

211
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,279
Do not worry.
I will send someone for them.

212
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,845
If the wild dogs or bears did not get
to them, everything will be fine.

213
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,618
Wild dogs?

214
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,586
Sorry, bears?

215
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,926
And it's your honeymoon!

216
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,298
How romantic!

217
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,163
I read all about it
in the magazines.

218
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,364
Now, I'll put you in the best room
in all of Belavia.

219
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,134
Come, follow me.
We have many facilities.

220
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,835
We have restaurant.

221
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,502
We have skis.

222
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,068
We have snowmobiles.

223
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,341
Um... what
was this about the bears?

224
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,246
Is that just a rumor, or?

225
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,648
Oh, dear.

226
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,250
Our honeymoon suite.

227
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:27,849
Wow.

228
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,155
Nice, yes?

229
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,254
Yes, yes.
It's, um... really...

230
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,061
There's certainly a lot of...

231
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,226
nature.

232
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,896
Yes. Belavia is full of nature.

233
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,701
It's our national treasure.

234
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,844
And now for you,

235
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,574
our local specialty...

236
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,013
Brekikka.

237
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,051
Ah.

238
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,244
Thank you.

239
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,280
Thank you. It's very kind.

240
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,551
You're welcome.

241
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,922
I leave you now.

242
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,459
Strong.

243
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,299
Sweet.

244
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,142
Uh, I forgot to say...

245
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,316
Thank you, King and Queen,
for staying at my hotel.

246
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,817
You're welcome.

247
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,700
What do you mean,
they're in Belavia?

248
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,927
How could this be?

249
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,493
I've been trying
to reach you for hours!

250
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,337
I saw them with my very own
eyes at my very own hotel!

251
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,309
But they're supposed
to be on an island!

252
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,778
<i>I guess they</i>
<i>changed their minds.</i>

253
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,678
<i>They must know something!</i>

254
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,842
- But how could they?
- Well, how could they?

255
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,580
<i>Ohh! I deeply,</i>
<i>deeply dislike them.</i>

256
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,521
I am, on the whole, displeased.

257
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,252
Oh, I too, sir.

258
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,624
I'm displeased to my very soul.

259
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,026
Well, what can they do?

260
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,358
Nothing.

261
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,557
Nothing?

262
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,294
I have the prince's signature.

263
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,929
<i>I'm going to call an emergency</i>
<i>session of Parliament.</i>

264
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,031
They will clearly see
the value of these oil reserves.

265
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,440
Um... with all due respect, sir,

266
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,844
you're talking about our dashing
young king and his charming bride,

267
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,472
<i>the same beautiful couple</i>

268
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,676
<i>that makes headlines</i>
<i>on a daily basis.</i>

269
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,710
If they discover what is going on,
we could have a problem.

270
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,813
Oh, no!

271
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,152
Oh, yes, sir!

272
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,555
Well, then, do something!

273
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,854
What are you suggesting?

274
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,225
I don't know! Keep them busy!

275
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,027
Perhaps I could distract them.

276
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,966
Yes. Distract them.

277
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,400
W-wait.

278
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,699
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

279
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,002
I have just the thing.

280
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,754
It feels like Christmas, doesn't it?

281
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,024
It does, yes.

282
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,501
And considering it's a good
two degrees above freezing,

283
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,560
I believe a toast is in order.

284
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,430
My. How fancy.

285
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,032
Oh, quite fancy.

286
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,578
- I am a king, you know.
- Right.

287
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,876
To my gorgeous, brilliant wife,

288
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,280
who is quite the trouper

289
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,217
for putting up with her
sometimes cranky husband

290
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,720
and for finding us
some warmer clothes.

291
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,279
I don't deserve you.

292
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,951
I guess you're just lucky.

293
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,354
Scott?

294
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,523
Sorry?

295
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,930
Scott?

296
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:56,690
Paige?

297
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,464
Holy cow!

298
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,563
Paige Morgan!

299
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,904
Hey!

300
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,279
- Scott! How are you?
- Good. Really great.

301
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,611
I'd ask how you are, but it'd be
kind of a dumb question...

302
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:11,842
Your Majesty.

303
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,612
Scott, this is my husband,

304
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,845
King Edvard.

305
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,217
Eddie, this is Scott Alberson.

306
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,619
King Edvard!

307
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,749
Just, um, Eddie.

308
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,383
Scott, nice to meet you.

309
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,950
We went to high school together.

310
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,427
Yeah, like, a million years ago.

311
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,054
It wasn't that long ago.

312
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,621
Well, let's see now.

313
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,691
Since high school, she's gone
to college, med school...

314
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,499
Oh! And become
queen of Denmark!

315
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,264
Scott, what are you doing here?

316
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,071
You mean, what am I doing
in a tiny little country,

317
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,135
middle of nowhere,
no one's ever even heard of?

318
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,874
Yes, that's what I mean.

319
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,779
Well, you know
I'm a journalist now.

320
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,410
I was in Lithuania
doing a travel piece.

321
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,080
Someone told me about
this amazing nature preserve.

322
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,952
Thought I'd check it out.

323
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,454
Scott, can you do us a favor
and not tell anyone we're here?

324
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,428
We kind of just want to be alone.

325
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,158
Right. Of course not.

326
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,462
The... the press, you know.

327
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,435
Right! Alone!

328
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,937
Okay, yeah, I'm gone.

329
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,269
Seriously, I'm gone.
Nice to meet you.

330
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,831
- Eh, Eddie!
- Yo!

331
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,171
Good night, Paige.

332
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,404
By the way...

333
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,575
is it Dr. Paige now,
or Queen Paige?

334
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,349
It's... Paige.
It's still... just Paige.

335
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,160
Wow.

336
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,968
Try to change
the subject.

337
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,971
- Whoops!
- Bags.

338
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,870
I guess
the wild dogs got to them.

339
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,135
Or the bears.

340
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,836
I'm so sorry.

341
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,778
We'll deal with it later.
Thank you, Marcellus. Good night.

342
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,315
- Good night, Your Majesties.
- Good night.

343
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,216
So, this Scott fellow...

344
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,811
was he, um,
a very good friend?

345
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,721
He was. I haven't seen him
since graduation.

346
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,457
Were you... did you...
date at all?

347
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,225
Eddie, are you jealous?

348
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,891
Jeal...? No!

349
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,366
- Should I be?
- Yes.

350
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,096
We dated in high school.

351
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,036
Right.

352
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,634
But you broke up.

353
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,236
I wanted to go to med school.

354
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,714
He wanted me to be
someone else.

355
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,239
Oh.

356
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,580
I think he's over it.

357
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,646
Mmm. Don't know.
Bet you're quite hard to get over.

358
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,248
Well, between you and me...

359
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,623
Mmm?

360
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,061
I like you a lot more
than I ever liked him.

361
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,460
Yeah?

362
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,334
Yeah.

363
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:19,263
No, l... I'm just saying
that I don't look very dignified.

364
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,965
Maybe I should go back.

365
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,234
Oh, Eddie, don't be silly.

366
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,175
It's the only outfit I could find
that would fit you.

367
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,144
Besides,
you're not a king right now.

368
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,976
You're just a guy
on his honeymoon.

369
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,516
Yeah, a very silly-looking guy
on his honeymoon.

370
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,744
Wow.

371
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,387
He looks pretty good.

372
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,352
Hey, guys.

373
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,658
Scott! Um...

374
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,323
Hi.

375
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,061
Whoa, Eddie, that is some outfit!

376
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,500
All right, that's it.
I'm going back.

377
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,559
I'm just kidding.

378
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,468
Come on,
what are you guys doing?

379
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,870
You up for a little boarding?

380
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,806
Oh, no. I'm just a skier.

381
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,707
I've actually never tried it.

382
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,746
Better not. Wouldn't want
to kill the king.

383
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,478
Well, actually,
I'm a pretty good skier.

384
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,814
- It's not that different, is it?
- No.

385
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,013
Oh... I don't know.

386
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,715
Aw, you don't mind, do you?

387
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,223
You can follow on your skis.

388
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,691
- Okay.
- Cool!

389
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,161
Let's go get you some gear!

390
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,697
Well... here we are.

391
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:28,933
This is it?

392
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,599
It's nice.

393
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,040
Looks easy enough.

394
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,509
You'll be just fine.

395
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,183
Now, uh, remember...

396
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,221
keep your weight forward
and use your hands.

397
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,281
Right. We'll see you
at the bottom.

398
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,917
Yeah.

399
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,622
And, uh, be careful.

400
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,960
Oh, I could do that.

401
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,804
Or maybe not.

402
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,973
Oh, boy.

403
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,932
Eddie?

404
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,497
Are you okay?

405
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,269
Ow.

406
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,176
Hey, come on!

407
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,365
Yeah, baby!

408
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,117
You sure you want to do this one?

409
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,051
I mean, we could always go back in.

410
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,983
First one down.

411
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,524
Ha ha!

412
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,249
Come on, come on!

413
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,692
What was that?

414
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,689
What's the matter?

415
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,825
I'm coming, I'm coming!

416
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,171
Come on, come on, come on!

417
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,579
Where, where, where, where?
What? Through here?

418
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,410
- Mama! Mama!
- Okay, that's okay!

419
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,960
No, no, no, no. Stay.
It's all right.

420
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,187
Don't move.

421
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,460
It's okay.

422
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,260
It's okay. I got it.

423
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,267
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

424
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,570
Wait.

425
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,638
Paige! Paige!

426
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,545
- Got you.
- Careful, Paige.

427
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,518
Come on.

428
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,068
You okay?
Let me see your wrist.

429
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,340
You were, uh...

430
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,284
That was, uh...
that was, uh... really...

431
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,513
...cool, what you did back there.

432
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,513
Well, it's just what anyone
would have done.

433
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,853
Not anyone.

434
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,997
He's going to be okay...
just a few scrapes and bruises.

435
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,965
You okay, Eddie?

436
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:53,027
Yeah. I think
a little respite is in order.

437
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,971
Yeah, I think we've had
enough excitement for today.

438
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,668
We'll see you, Scott.

439
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,642
Okay.

440
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,474
Oh, thanks for the lesson.

441
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,706
Yeah.

442
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,839
Anytime.

443
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,026
Oh, Eddie. A wolverine.

444
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,296
They're everywhere here.

445
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,167
This place is wonderful.

446
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,399
You said it covers half the country?

447
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,566
Yes.

448
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,701
Oh, wow, look.

449
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,711
Imperial eagle.

450
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,376
Why don't more people
know about this,

451
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,475
this preserve?

452
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,181
Well, Belavia's
an undeveloped country.

453
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,416
It's to their advantage,
in many ways.

454
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,359
Maybe we could help them.

455
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,362
You know,
promote some eco-tourism.

456
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,954
It's a brilliant idea.

457
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,729
Eddie, look.

458
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,999
A deer. Do you think
it'll let us get closer?

459
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,233
I'm sure it wouldn't mind,
if you asked it politely.

460
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,748
Shh. She's onto us.

461
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,477
Where'd she go?

462
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,545
Outwitted by a deer.

463
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,089
She was right here.

464
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,623
What are those doing here?

465
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,399
I don't know.

466
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,957
I'm going to find out.

467
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,430
I want it razed to the ground.

468
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,942
Not a tree trunk, not a twig,
not a little furry creature left.

469
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,499
Translate that.

470
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:40,737
- Excuse me.
- What?

471
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,713
Your Majesty.

472
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,409
Your Majesties.

473
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,951
You're Danish.
Who are you, sir?

474
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,147
Oliver Laertes, Foreign Ministry.

475
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:54,817
I wish I had known you were coming.
I would have arranged a greeting.

476
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,952
What are you
and all these men doing here?

477
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,695
I'm here to make sure
everything is proceeding as planned.

478
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,998
You must be here
for a surprise inspection.

479
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,061
Inspection of what?

480
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,006
Um... the clearing of the forest.

481
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,406
For what?

482
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,945
To make room for the pipeline.

483
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,879
An <i>oil</i> pipeline?

484
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,540
Who ordered this,
and by what right?

485
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,917
Um... I believe
Prime Minister Polonius has obtained

486
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,081
all rights to the local oil reserves,

487
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,422
with the signed agreement
of the Belavian monarch, of course.

488
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,553
This must be
where he went on his trip.

489
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,222
Let me be clear, Mr. Laertes.

490
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,632
Please. Oliver, Your Majesty.

491
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,999
Oliver.

492
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,561
This endeavor is not the will
of Denmark.

493
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,607
I don't know what
the prime minister thinks he's doing,

494
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,734
but he does not have
the blessing of Parliament,

495
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,175
nor mine.

496
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,142
Where can I get a land line?

497
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,082
Um... the nearest one's in town.

498
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,482
Thank you.

499
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,820
- Oh, and Oliver.
- Yes, Your Majesty?

500
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,289
Don't cut anything down.

501
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,519
Of course not, Your Majesty.

502
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,400
Yes! Put him on immediately!

503
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,038
Tell him it's Oliver!

504
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:25,742
Your Majesty,
all day he has been calling... Mr. Soren.

505
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,581
Soren. Talk to me.

506
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,420
Yes. Yes, I understand.

507
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:35,852
What?

508
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,394
Um, thank you, Soren.

509
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,695
Patch me through
to the prime minister, will you?

510
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,866
- Well?
- It's true.

511
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,998
Polonius is attempting to seize
the land by eminent domain

512
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,043
and has proposed an amendment
to the Conservation Act

513
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,579
in order to allow him to drill for oil.

514
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,005
Can he just do that?

515
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:02,519
Not just that, he's called an emergency
session in Parliament to vote on it,

516
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,521
three days from now.

517
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,216
But that's Christmas Eve.

518
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,920
He doesn't care.
He... he's running for reelection.

519
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,394
He thinks that this travesty
will clinch it for him.

520
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,294
<i>- Your Majesty.</i>
- What was that?

521
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,401
Oh, he is, is he? Um...

522
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,730
No, that'll be all.

523
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,330
Let me know
if you hear anything else.

524
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,672
He's tied up.

525
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,541
We need to go home, Eddie.

526
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,014
You'll talk to Parliament.

527
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,246
Yes. I need to speak
to the prince first.

528
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,153
Mr. Soren says that the jet
is standing by.

529
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,185
Unless...

530
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,386
Unless we fight Polonius from here,

531
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,088
right here from Belavia.

532
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,528
We bring the media here,

533
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,623
to the very land
this proposal would destroy.

534
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,690
They would love it.

535
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,032
"Royal couple takes up cause
on honeymoon."

536
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,799
That would also give you
time to see the prince.

537
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,636
But what about your honeymoon?

538
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,569
Paige, I'm sorry.

539
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,637
Eddie, we have the rest of
our lives to be together.

540
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,445
Are we going
to save Belavia or what?

541
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,950
You are an amazing woman.

542
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,452
Let's do it!

543
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,147
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

544
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,241
The prince is not available.

545
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,513
Not available?

546
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,148
This is urgent business.

547
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,522
Yes, Your Majesty,
but he was not expecting you.

548
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,825
Are you telling me
he will not see me?

549
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:56,424
No. No, Your Majesty,
it's simply... he's busy.

550
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,494
But he did instruct me
to invite you and your queen

551
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,562
to our holiday ball tonight.

552
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,734
Holiday ball.

553
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,972
All right. Fine.

554
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,313
Please tell the prince we accept.

555
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,375
I look forward
to speaking to him tonight.

556
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

557
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,085
Thank you.

558
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,658
No, that's great, Scott.
As soon as you can, okay?

559
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,596
- Please.
- Of course.

560
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,941
- Paige?
- Eddie.

561
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,811
- How'd it go?
- Was that Scott?

562
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,872
Yes! I ran into him again.

563
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,918
Great news. Soren said that
all the major papers

564
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,351
and television stations
are on their way,

565
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,753
and Scott's been helping out,
making calls to smaller outfits.

566
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,155
That's good news.

567
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,216
What happened?
What did the prince say?

568
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,058
He didn't.
He wouldn't see me.

569
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,155
What? He wouldn't
see you? Why?

570
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,530
I don't know. It's quite clear
something's going on.

571
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,502
You know, I haven't been
refused an audience since...

572
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,237
well, ever.
I've never been refused.

573
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,506
Does he know we only have
two days to stop this thing?

574
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,911
I assume so, but maybe not.

575
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,506
He's invited us to his
holiday ball tonight.

576
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,074
- Have you not heard from Polonius?
- No.

577
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:26,250
Excuse me, Your Majesties, um,
but I couldn't help overhearing.

578
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,518
If I may.

579
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,290
I am told the prince can be
a rather difficult man.

580
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,524
In what way?

581
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:37,762
Perhaps a little senile.
It's hard to say.

582
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:42,363
He does seem to have
a special dislike for the Crown.

583
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,103
Really?

584
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,202
But you will see for yourself.
If there's anything I can do to...

585
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,612
No, Oliver, you can do your part
by staying those bulldozers, okay?

586
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,946
Of course, Your Majesty.
Good day.

587
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,380
What do we do now?

588
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,785
The prince will be here very soon.

589
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,880
I can't wait any longer.
I need to start talking to Parliament.

590
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,255
I've no doubt Polonius
is doing exactly the same.

591
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,452
Marcellus!

592
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,723
I don't care if his phones are busy.

593
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,627
This is my fourth call.

594
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,632
Put me through to him now!

595
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,827
Well, yes, Madame Chairman,
that is exactly the case.

596
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,168
You have my deepest gratitude
for your support.

597
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,467
Good day.

598
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,537
Yes?

599
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:23,839
Mr. Prime Minister.

600
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,145
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

601
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,152
what exactly are you doing
in Belavia?

602
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,346
Well, it's a funny thing.

603
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,788
I, uh, discovered that you
intended to demolish

604
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,349
one of my kingdom's
national treasures

605
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,792
<i>while I was out of town.</i>

606
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,955
Merely a coincidence.

607
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,829
That I doubt,
because I know your tactics.

608
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,767
<i>Do you really think this little</i>
<i>publicity stunt of yours</i>

609
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,701
<i>is going to stop me?</i>

610
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,000
I do, yes.

611
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,104
Don't go to battle
with me, Your Majesty.

612
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,611
You don't have
the stomach for it.

613
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,172
Belavia is under
the protection of the Crown.

614
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,879
You will not destroy it
for political gain.

615
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,387
I will not allow it.

616
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,947
Do you think the people
will thank you

617
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,958
<i>for higher gas prices?</i>

618
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,722
My people care about
more than just gas prices.

619
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,127
Oh, do they?

620
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,892
We'll see about that.

621
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,867
<i>Enjoy your honeymoon,</i>
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

622
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,400
Polonius?

623
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,434
Yes.

624
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,640
You know, I don't believe
he's very fond of me.

625
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:31,809
He's been busy

626
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,146
lobbying the legislators
to vote for his measure.

627
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,480
How are we doing?

628
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:37,885
Well, the Speaker seems inclined.

629
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,685
Some are shortsighted, but...

630
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,919
once we have the prince behind us,
Parliament will fall in line.

631
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:46,122
Speaking of which,
look what Marcellus found for you.

632
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,158
Great.

633
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,061
Let's go and talk to the prince.

634
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,641
Bravo!

635
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:45,148
- Merry Christmas!
- Happy holidays!

636
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:50,482
Wait. Stay there
and don't move your muscles.

637
00:38:54,365 --> 00:39:00,133
Their Royal Majesties,
King Edvard and Queen Paige.

638
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,004
It's going to be a great party.

639
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,444
Hey, guys.

640
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,743
Wow. You look... gorgeous.

641
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,408
Just like prom, huh?

642
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,486
You'll be happy to hear,
I called in all my chips,

643
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,852
even saw one of my friends
from BBC Nature checking in already.

644
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,187
Thank you, Scott.
Your help is appreciated.

645
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:25,160
Your Majesties, Prince Georgiev
would like you to join him at his table.

646
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,662
Of course, Oliver, thank you.

647
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,290
Would you excuse us, Scott.

648
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,493
Oh, yeah.

649
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:35,028
Actually, Your Majesty, I have arranged it
so that your friend can join us.

650
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,601
Cool!

651
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,006
Thanks.

652
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,675
Lovely.

653
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:43,907
Scott.

654
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,508
Okay. Sure.

655
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,745
What was that?

656
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,684
I was just saying
that tonight is off the record.

657
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:51,881
You know, no reporting.

658
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,150
Good thinking.

659
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,749
So, you went to the prom
with this guy.

660
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,786
Forget about Scott.
Focus on the prince.

661
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,353
Yeah, but prom, isn't that...

662
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,696
sig... significant?

663
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:03,825
The prince.

664
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,368
We need his support.

665
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,563
Right. Later we'll talk
about this prom business.

666
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:08,696
Yes.

667
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,732
May I present King Edvard
and Queen Paige of Denmark.

668
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,938
The Honorable
Prince Georgiev III of Belavia.

669
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,384
My Queen, a word of caution.

670
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,482
Local custom requires that women
avert their eyes from the prince.

671
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,719
Why?

672
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,126
It's a custom hundreds
of years old. Protocol.

673
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,243
Your Highness, I need to speak
to you about the nature preserve.

674
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:50,807
We love...

675
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,682
We love Belavia, Your Highness.

676
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,516
The people have made us
feel very welcome.

677
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,054
Prince Georgiev,

678
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,757
you signed an agreement

679
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:11,461
with the Danish prime minister
regarding oil rights. Why?

680
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,264
I had no choice.

681
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,805
You gave me no choice.

682
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,400
Sorry. I don't understand.

683
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:25,381
It is your will,
so Polonius said.

684
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,041
You pretend to be a friend to us.

685
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,277
You're no friend.

686
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,251
You send here
people like that one,

687
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,623
with bulldozers to destroy
what is best about Belavia.

688
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,719
And what do we get in return?

689
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,161
A pittance.

690
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,462
I give you my word.

691
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,128
I knew nothing about this
before this week.

692
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,832
Yes, of course. You don't know what
your own government is planning.

693
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,268
Are you calling me a liar?

694
00:41:55,412 --> 00:42:00,042
And am I too a liar sent here
to destroy your country?

695
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,514
I didn't mean to offend Your Majesty.

696
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,681
You didn't offend me.

697
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,453
I understand your position.

698
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,428
My father often dealt with men
who made promises.

699
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,293
They tried to take our farm.

700
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,128
They almost did.

701
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,760
But you are wrong about us.

702
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:22,272
The king and I have taken on
your cause on our honeymoon,

703
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,933
and if you value your kingdom,
you will listen to him,

704
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,534
because right now he's
the only one who can help you.

705
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,718
- If what you say is true...
- It is.

706
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,951
Then I will listen.

707
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,693
She's a good wife. Smart.

708
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:48,993
Brilliant.

709
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,294
Yes.

710
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:54,326
I will be very careful
not to make her angry in the future.

711
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,599
That's probably wise.

712
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:01,802
I was rude.
Please accept my apology.

713
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,278
I accept.

714
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,882
Perhaps you can
make it up to me with a dance.

715
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,545
It will be an honor, my queen.

716
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,724
So, here it is...

717
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:27,787
tomorrow I will hold a press
conference in the preserve

718
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,332
and show the world

719
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,164
what everyone would be losing
if the forest were razed.

720
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:33,965
You think they'll listen?

721
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:37,337
The people will,
and so will Parliament.

722
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,638
You have much faith
in your people.

723
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,768
And yours.

724
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,439
Which is why I'd like you standing
next to me at the press conference.

725
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,380
I would be honored.

726
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,844
Thank you, Scott,
for all your help.

727
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,319
No problem.

728
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,380
He's done it. He's going
to save the preserve.

729
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:01,163
You, um... you really love him,
don't you?

730
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,493
I do.

731
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:04,659
More than I ever
thought possible.

732
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,267
I should go.

733
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,671
Oh. Okay.

734
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,539
Good night. Thank you.

735
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,237
- Sure.
- For everything.

736
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,951
- Hello.
- Whoa.

737
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,362
What are you doing
in my room, man?

738
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,438
- Sorry for the fright, Scott.
- What are you doing here?

739
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,874
How was the party?
Fun time?

740
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:51,904
From what my aide tells me,
things didn't go all that well.

741
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:56,817
So tell me, what happened tonight
that was not part of our plan?

742
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,549
What is going on? Hmm?

743
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,091
You told me this was just
about Paige and the king.

744
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,525
My business is not your concern.

745
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,063
You were instructed
to distract them,

746
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,224
to sabotage their
so-called honeymoon.

747
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,267
That's what I paid you for.

748
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:14,532
That's why I pulled you
out of that small-town paper.

749
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,268
And this...
is the best you can do?

750
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:23,973
Ahh.

751
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,744
"The king and queen of Denmark
save the life of an 8-year-old."

752
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,809
Yes, I've read it.

753
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,514
Everyone's read it.

754
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,079
It made headlines
all over the world.

755
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:38,026
And what do you counter
this hero story with, Scott?

756
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,757
Oh. Here it is.

757
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,398
I don't care if he looks silly
on a bloody snowboard.

758
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,870
I'm trying to ruin a man,
not make him blush.

759
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,736
Well, you know what?
I'm not up for this anymore, so...

760
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,345
That was a mistake.

761
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,574
Let me ask you
a question, Scott.

762
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,311
Do I look like a man
to be trifled with?

763
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,684
You have no idea what I've
done to reach my position,

764
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,693
or what I will do to maintain it.

765
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:14,959
Let me tell you what the consequences
of you reneging on our deal would be.

766
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,870
The queen will learn that
you are in fact not her friend,

767
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,772
but an opportunist

768
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,276
after monetary gain.

769
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,905
I would then make it my business
to destroy any hopes you may have

770
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,541
of becoming an important writer.

771
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:37,053
And last, but certainly
not least, my friend,

772
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,384
is that note on your mother's farm.

773
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,981
You promised! You promised!

774
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,623
Do you understand what I'm saying?

775
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,027
Do you understand what I'm saying?

776
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,335
Do you understand what I'm saying?

777
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,135
Yeah.

778
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,139
Good.

779
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:12,112
Then tomorrow
we up the stakes.

780
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:16,286
Tomorrow, nothing goes right
for this boy-king.

781
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,922
We must show the world
his incompetence.

782
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,596
Good night.

783
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,843
You will tell no one
that the prime minister is here.

784
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,639
Understood?

785
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,381
Understood?

786
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,628
Yes?

787
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,539
Good morning, Your Majesty.

788
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,874
Is, um, the king available?

789
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,847
Um... no, he's getting ready.

790
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,075
Can I help you?

791
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,417
Um... no.

792
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,790
Yes. I've arranged your
transportation to the conference.

793
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,451
Whenever you're ready,
Your Majesty.

794
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,018
Thank you, Oliver.

795
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,548
Aaah! Ohhh!

796
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,641
Eddie?

797
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,380
Ohh! Aah!

798
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,887
Are you okay?

799
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,447
Ow.

800
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:57,652
There they are.
Here they come.

801
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,492
Your Majesties, will you
be spending Christmas in Belavia?

802
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,096
Will you really do battle
with Prime Minister Polonius?

803
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,658
I will explain everything
at the press conference. Thank you.

804
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,471
Your Majesty, what happened?

805
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,340
He slipped in the shower.

806
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,939
I didn't slip. I was scalded
by some extremely hot water,

807
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,109
and so I leapt out.

808
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,515
You leapt?

809
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:23,848
Doesn't matter, does it?

810
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,514
I've got a very,
very good feeling about today,

811
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,490
and I don't want anything to ruin it.

812
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,386
What's the itinerary?

813
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,485
When you arrive
at the nature preserve,

814
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:35,190
the press and Prince Georgiev
will be waiting.

815
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:38,962
And here is your transportation...
very environmentally friendly.

816
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,129
- Great.
- Eddie, look who it is.

817
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,368
Thank you, Oliver.

818
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,436
Hello!

819
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,206
Who's this guy?

820
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,347
Okay!

821
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,849
Don't know if I like
the look of this fellow.

822
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,415
Kind of looks like a Mob guy.

823
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,455
- Okay?
- Great. Okay.

824
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,526
Good luck,
Your Majesties. See you there!

825
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,796
Bye!

826
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,802
Have fun.

827
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,060
Well, I flew straight from Frankfurt.
Couldn't miss this.

828
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,592
Yeah. Yeah,
it's a big deal, I guess.

829
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:48,263
It is... not every day a king goes up
against his prime minister.

830
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,724
It's definitely his brother.

831
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,318
Or his cousin.

832
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,420
I think he said it was his dad.

833
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:16,893
His dad?

834
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,457
Or his son.

835
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,230
Or his son!

836
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,534
It's his dad <i>or</i> his son.

837
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,537
Are we nearly there?

838
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,380
I wonder where they are.

839
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,251
I hope they didn't have an accident.

840
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,482
There.

841
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,357
Oh!

842
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:46,622
Brilliant.

843
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,792
Is King Edvard riding in a sleigh?

844
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,060
Apparently.

845
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,399
Excuse me, won't you?

846
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,840
The queen! The queen!

847
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,180
Go! Go!

848
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,879
Oliver, what are you doing?

849
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,417
- Why are we getting off here?
- Excuse me!

850
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,551
I thought it might be better,
Your Majesty. You see...

851
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,527
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

852
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:21,856
the monarch...

853
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,192
Aah!

854
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:28,962
Eddie!

855
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,203
Eddie!

856
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,134
- Eddie!
- Paige!

857
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,409
Somebody help! Eddie!

858
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,273
Eddie!

859
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,580
- Oh, no! Eddie!
- Look out!

860
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,249
Eddie!

861
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,089
Look out!

862
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,196
Eddie, oh!

863
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,280
Eddie! Eddie.

864
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:26,553
He got some good distance.

865
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,325
Eddie, are you okay?

866
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,293
Yes.

867
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:33,896
I'm f...

868
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,569
Scott, help me.

869
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,670
People! People!

870
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:42,905
May I please have your attention.

871
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:49,183
Regretfully,
under the circumstances,

872
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,914
we're obliged to cancel
today's press conference.

873
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:55,446
We look forward to seeing you
once the king recovers.

874
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,119
- We're coming, Eddie.
- Face in the snow.

875
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,856
I did not tell you to cancel
the press conference.

876
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,629
You were buried in snow, sir.

877
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,001
I apologize for any misunderstanding.

878
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,168
In less than 18 hours,
Parliament will vote,

879
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:16,303
and unless Prince Georgiev and I
get in front of those cameras,

880
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:19,280
this fight is done.
You understand?

881
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,477
I'll get on it right away, sir.

882
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:28,255
Here. Eddie,
do you want to talk?

883
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,123
No. No, I don't want
to talk about it.

884
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,220
Not now, okay?
Maybe not ever.

885
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,795
Enter.

886
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:39,892
Hey, guys.

887
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,335
I just, uh...

888
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,271
I just wanted to check up
on Edvard.

889
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,604
You all right?

890
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,665
Yeah.

891
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:48,870
No!

892
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,742
Pretty far from all right, actually.

893
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:51,974
Do you know why?

894
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,845
My shower
attacked me this morning,

895
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,977
I've just been
in a sleigh-riding accident,

896
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,180
and, unless something
drastic happens,

897
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,280
tomorrow afternoon
Parliament will vote

898
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,327
to destroy this country's
nature preserve.

899
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:05,986
So, nope,

900
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,087
all right is what I am not.

901
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,290
Eddie.

902
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,563
And am I somehow
responsible for all that?

903
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:17,905
I don't know, are you?

904
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,703
What are you talking about?

905
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,176
I don't know.

906
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,637
You seem to be around
an awful lot, I know that.

907
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,184
Every time I turn around,

908
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:31,846
there's my wife's
good pal Scotty.

909
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:35,015
Now, why is that, hmm?

910
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,388
I mean, this is...

911
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,794
<i>my</i> honeymoon, isn't it?

912
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:42,388
Or at least it's supposed to be.

913
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:47,459
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

914
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,765
I'm gonna take off.

915
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,272
- Yeah.
- Bye.

916
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:01,383
Are you... happy now?

917
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:05,387
You were just incredibly rude
to my good friend for no reason.

918
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,717
Oh, no reason?

919
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:07,848
Look at me!

920
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,619
Scott didn't knock you out.

921
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,216
He didn't burn you in the shower.

922
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:12,886
He didn't wreck the sleigh.

923
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,760
Just because you're having a bad day
doesn't mean you need to... blah!

924
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,197
Sorry, "bad day"?

925
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,395
Bad...? This isn't a bad day, Paige,

926
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,370
this is a public relations nightmare!

927
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,704
Well, I'm sorry you were
so miserable on our honeymoon!

928
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,005
Well, then maybe
you shouldn't have been spending

929
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,704
so much time with your boyfriend!

930
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:33,374
Boyfriend? That's...
that's really mature, Eddie.

931
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,385
And just for the record, I wanted
to spend yesterday with my husband,

932
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,944
but you stupid boys
wouldn't stop competing

933
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:40,284
even though you've already won!

934
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:48,759
I need a drink.

935
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,874
Thank you.

936
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,643
My pleasure, Your Majesty.

937
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:12,284
I spoke to Prince Georgiev,
per your instructions.

938
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,323
He would like to sit
down with you in one hour

939
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,358
to discuss the rescheduled
news conference.

940
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,987
Um...

941
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,654
Great.

942
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:25,326
Excuse me, Your Majesty,
but is something bothering you?

943
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,801
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

944
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,871
Here's the thing, right?

945
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:36,206
Why is he <i>always</i> hanging around?

946
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,406
Whom are we talking about, sir?

947
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,142
You know, <i>him.</i>

948
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,547
"Eh, Scott!"

949
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,643
The queen's schoolmate.

950
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,321
I know what you're going to say.
I'm jealous.

951
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,521
That is ridiculous.

952
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,223
I mean, what do I have
to be jealous of?

953
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,100
She's with me!

954
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,566
I mean, we're married.

955
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,532
We live in a castle.

956
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,932
And I'm... I'm...
I'm a good catch, hmm?

957
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,443
Hmm?

958
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,676
For some reason... shh...

959
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,846
this trip, I can't seem
to do anything right.

960
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,555
These beers are strong,
aren't they?

961
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,225
Maybe...

962
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:29,265
the queen has given you
reason to be jealous?

963
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,798
She'd never do anything to hurt me.
I trust her implicitly.

964
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,770
Such a funny word, isn't it?

965
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,933
What word is that, sir?

966
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:41,408
"Implicitly."

967
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:46,108
Perhaps...

968
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:51,212
the relationship they had
is troubling you.

969
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,413
Exactly!

970
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:59,091
He knows things about her
that I will never know.

971
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,458
What made her laugh as a girl...

972
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,462
what it was like to be her first kiss.

973
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,576
But she's mine now, right?

974
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,305
That's right, Your Majesty.

975
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,974
I'm being so foolish.

976
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,574
I'm going to find her,

977
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,745
and I'm going to tell her
how lucky I am that she's mine.

978
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:30,123
I'm going to do that...
right now.

979
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,124
Ah.

980
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,859
Melancholy Dane.

981
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,436
Check, please.

982
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:48,867
You look pretty out here.

983
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,277
Scott. You scared me.

984
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:52,473
Sorry.

985
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,812
So I guess I caused you
a lot of trouble, huh?

986
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:57,352
It's not your fault, um, but...

987
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,116
I don't think we should spend
any more time together.

988
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,455
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait.

989
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:04,853
I don't know, you know...

990
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,360
seeing you again
after all these years...

991
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,894
reminds me of that last
Christmas we spent together.

992
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,128
Scott.

993
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:14,499
Remember?

994
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,739
I remember it was freezing,

995
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,970
and you had to put
your arms around me.

996
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,377
- Yeah.
- No, Scott.

997
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,750
Paige, come on, okay?

998
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,311
Letting you go,
biggest mistake of my life.

999
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,380
I lost you...

1000
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,493
and now you're...

1001
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:41,724
now you're married to a king.
What am I supposed to do with that?

1002
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,134
You're not supposed
to do anything with it.

1003
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:50,263
You're living
a little girl's dream, Paige.

1004
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:53,604
It's not your dream.
You never wanted any of this.

1005
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,303
You wanted to be a doctor,

1006
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,006
and now you've given it up
for some fantasy.

1007
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,515
- It's not you.
- I haven't given anything up.

1008
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,349
Wait a minute.

1009
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:09,084
Is that... is that... what this
whole thing has been about,

1010
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,420
winning me back?

1011
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:15,230
I thought you were my friend,

1012
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:18,131
and you came here
to try and wreck my marriage.

1013
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:22,363
Scott... why are you here?

1014
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,429
I'm here for you, Paige.

1015
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:27,869
I love you.

1016
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,377
Leave me alone.

1017
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,879
Aah!
Jeez, Paige!

1018
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,179
What's wrong with you?

1019
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,742
You don't understand.

1020
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:41,278
No, no. You need
to stay away from me.

1021
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,626
Paige! Paige, I'm sorry!

1022
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,960
Well done.

1023
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,738
Hey, I'm done.
That's all you're getting from me.

1024
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,735
That's all I need.

1025
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,468
It's all I need.

1026
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,406
Don't catch cold.

1027
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,613
Oliver?

1028
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,451
Just be a moment, madam.

1029
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:17,857
Oliver, what happened?

1030
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:26,100
I believe the king had a few too many...
"mind erasers," I believe they're called.

1031
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,796
I just had a beer.

1032
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,198
He missed his meeting
with the prince.

1033
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,833
The prince was not happy.

1034
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,434
That's not like Eddie at all.

1035
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:37,839
Thank you for bringing him home.

1036
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,906
It was a pleasure to carry
the leader of my homeland...

1037
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,451
over my shoulder.

1038
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,993
Paige, are you cross with me?

1039
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,192
No, honey.

1040
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,199
That would be terrible.

1041
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:04,537
I love you so much, it hurts.

1042
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:11,703
I love you too.

1043
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:18,679
Eddie, there's something
I need to tell you.

1044
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,085
Eddie?

1045
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,169
Thank you.

1046
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,006
Hi.

1047
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,414
Merry Christmas Eve.

1048
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:53,685
Paige, why does my head hurt?

1049
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,621
You drank too much last night.

1050
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,090
You want to sit?

1051
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,254
Yes.

1052
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:11,599
I'm sorry.

1053
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,267
Me too.

1054
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:14,502
No, it's my fault.

1055
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,374
I shouldn't have gone off on
your friend like that.

1056
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,436
I was stupid and...

1057
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,643
jealous.

1058
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,917
Eddie, I have
to tell you something,

1059
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,582
and you're not going to like it.

1060
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,086
Okay.

1061
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,122
This is kind of awkward.

1062
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,325
Bad awkward?

1063
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:37,832
Not good.

1064
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,458
Maybe bad.

1065
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:42,970
Good morning, Your Majesties.

1066
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,439
Oliver, will you just
give us a minute, please?

1067
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,533
Sir, the prime minister's here.

1068
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,738
Here? In Belavia here?

1069
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:53,577
Yes, and he would like to speak
to you at your earliest convenience.

1070
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:59,287
Fine. Could you tell him that
I'll meet him in the hotel library

1071
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,380
in 15 minutes.

1072
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:05,286
Paige, I'm really sorry.
I'm going to have to go and see him.

1073
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,329
Who knows what he's up to.

1074
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,762
Can we talk about this later?

1075
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,459
Yeah. Yeah.

1076
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:12,694
Okay.

1077
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,131
It's not...

1078
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:20,205
<i>bad</i> bad, is it?

1079
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,273
Well, we'll talk later.

1080
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,756
Thank you for seeing me,
Your Majesty.

1081
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,158
John, I hope you're not here to try
and make me change my mind.

1082
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:43,221
I've already persuaded a number
of the legislators to join my cause.

1083
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,789
Yes, I'm well aware,

1084
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:48,166
but there may be other factors
you might want to consider.

1085
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:49,670
May I sit?

1086
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:00,640
- What is this?
- It's a book.

1087
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:02,877
A tell-all, I believe they call it.

1088
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,084
It doesn't paint your young bride
in the best light.

1089
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,359
How did you get this?

1090
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,795
You should read it, really.

1091
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,664
We just added an especially juicy
chapter following last night's events.

1092
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,326
It's great stuff,

1093
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,371
complete with pictures too.

1094
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:25,839
There's even a great one of you
asleep on a barroom floor.

1095
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,239
But this one...

1096
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,542
is my favorite.

1097
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:45,190
What do you want?

1098
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,230
Drop this issue.

1099
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,993
Go honeymoon
in the tropics as planned,

1100
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:55,060
or your dirty laundry will become
a number-one bestseller.

1101
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,298
Are you ready for that?

1102
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,034
Is your queen?

1103
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:20,591
Uh, it's over. We're leaving.

1104
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,222
Why?

1105
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,063
We lost the fight.

1106
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:27,963
Eddie, what happened?

1107
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:35,637
Better question...

1108
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,738
What happened
with Scott last night?

1109
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,983
He... kissed me.

1110
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,490
For the record, Paige...

1111
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,553
someone kissing you

1112
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,088
falls under the category of <i>bad</i> bad.

1113
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,232
Eddie, you don't think that l...

1114
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,463
What?

1115
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,940
Kissed him back? Did you?

1116
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,942
No.

1117
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,841
No, of course not.

1118
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:13,508
So it was a...

1119
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,579
a one-way kiss?

1120
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,185
Yeah, I would say so.

1121
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:23,919
I slapped him.

1122
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:28,022
He's, um...

1123
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:31,795
he's written a book, Paige.

1124
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:38,798
A tell-all about the two of you,

1125
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:42,366
complete with a picture
of him kissing you...

1126
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,039
on our honeymoon.

1127
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,480
That's... this is why
we've got to go...

1128
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,816
before this book comes out,
courtesy of Polonius.

1129
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:54,716
Polonius.

1130
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,487
Eddie, we didn't
do anything wrong.

1131
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,497
Oh, that's not how it looks.

1132
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:03,725
This book would...

1133
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,559
embarrass the Crown.

1134
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:11,331
No. It would embarrass me.

1135
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,808
You are the Crown.

1136
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,509
Paige, you are
the queen of Denmark.

1137
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:22,744
Yes.

1138
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:28,519
And as queen, I will not run away
from slander, and neither should you.

1139
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,183
It's not me I'm worried about.

1140
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,056
I'm not going anywhere.

1141
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:34,589
Excuse me?

1142
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:35,789
You heard me.

1143
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,758
I haven't done anything wrong.

1144
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:45,604
In fact, I have been wronged
by someone I thought was a friend.

1145
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,675
I won't back down.

1146
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,370
I can't.

1147
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:52,278
I'm not going to pretend
to be someone I'm not.

1148
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:54,408
What do you mean?

1149
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:57,179
Just because Scott and Polonius
say something is true,

1150
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,585
you think people will believe it.

1151
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,716
Well, I don't.

1152
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:05,157
People know me better than that,

1153
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:08,219
and they should know that
somebody's trying to blackmail us.

1154
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,132
Sit down.

1155
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,435
Hey, hey.

1156
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:24,105
Never for a moment believe
that I would want you to change.

1157
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,310
You're the woman I married.

1158
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:33,417
You're the girl I want,
and you will be...

1159
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,256
You <i>are</i> a brilliant queen.

1160
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,495
Then let's go forward.

1161
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:51,439
I can take a little
embarrassment if you can,

1162
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,532
if I know it's the right thing.

1163
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,235
It is the right thing, isn't it?

1164
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,711
Yes.

1165
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:00,512
I love you...

1166
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,144
Paige Morgan.

1167
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:05,811
I love you.

1168
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:18,799
Three hours till the vote.

1169
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:22,363
There he is.

1170
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,966
Scott!

1171
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,605
You and I need to talk.

1172
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:29,803
Uh...

1173
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:33,010
I got a plane to catch.

1174
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,674
- Call the prince.
- A press conference. I'm on it!

1175
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,051
Hey!

1176
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,727
You don't mind, do you?

1177
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:51,693
Thank you.

1178
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,002
Now...

1179
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:58,403
driving I <i>can</i> do.

1180
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:57,731
All right!

1181
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,234
Now, I didn't want it
to have to come to this,

1182
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:03,931
but I'm going to have to show you
how we take care of things back home.

1183
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,530
Ugh!

1184
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,438
Aaahhh!

1185
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:10,444
Actually, we Danes
are quite fond of pugilism.

1186
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,183
The conference
is at the castle in an hour.

1187
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:19,584
The reporters are on their way.

1188
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,481
I am really sorry.

1189
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:28,926
I don't want to hear you
say you're sorry.

1190
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,965
Was this Polonius' idea
or yours?

1191
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,060
A bit of both.

1192
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,627
I've been writing it for a while.

1193
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,109
It was just about Paige
and me at high school.

1194
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,042
I needed the money.

1195
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,872
But then the prime minister
contacted me.

1196
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:52,352
I guess he was,
uh, fishing for dirt.

1197
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:57,382
On you, Paige.

1198
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:58,721
On me?

1199
01:14:58,794 --> 01:14:59,988
Yeah.

1200
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,324
I, uh...

1201
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:04,726
I told him about the book.

1202
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,234
He said he could get it published...

1203
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:10,194
if I just, um...

1204
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,364
embellished things...

1205
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:15,468
a little bit.

1206
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,312
If you lied, you mean.

1207
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,508
Hey, I told you,
I needed the money, okay?

1208
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,380
Paige...

1209
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,391
my family's farm is going under.

1210
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:37,154
So, anyway, then he says, uh,

1211
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,666
"Oh, we're probably going to need
some pictures to go with the book."

1212
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:42,102
When you guys came to Belavia,

1213
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,468
he gave me the scoop
and flew me out here.

1214
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,538
I <i>was</i> in Lithuania,

1215
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,600
but I had no idea
it involved this oil thing,

1216
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:53,170
and I certainly didn't know that
that Oliver creep was involved until...

1217
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:57,643
Well, uh, until I did.

1218
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,555
Well, he fooled us too.

1219
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,228
So what are we going to do
about this?

1220
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:21,034
You're sure
the prince understands?

1221
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:23,475
I've explained everything.
You'll speak first, then Scott.

1222
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,877
Never been on this end
of a press conference before.

1223
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:27,313
Just tell the truth, okay,

1224
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,373
that Polonius brought you here,
he told you what to do,

1225
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,715
and then paid you to write
a salacious expos on the queen.

1226
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:35,052
Hey! It's my family's farm, okay?
It's all we've got.

1227
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,921
Scott! We've been friends
for a long time.

1228
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,517
Our parents are friends.

1229
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,563
We cared a lot
about each other at one point.

1230
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:45,066
If that means anything to you,
you need to make this right.

1231
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,760
We will do everything
we can for your family,

1232
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,599
but right now, this
country's future is at stake.

1233
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,376
Your Majesty.

1234
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,812
You're supposed
to be on a plane.

1235
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:01,911
Change of plans.

1236
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:05,112
We're not running away
because of your lies.

1237
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:08,781
So you call a press conference
and have Mr. All-American

1238
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:12,224
spill his guts about
the evil prime minister.

1239
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:13,989
Is that about right?

1240
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:16,794
Something like that, yes.

1241
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:18,457
Now, if you'll excuse us,

1242
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,091
the reporters are waiting,

1243
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,193
as is our Parliament.

1244
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:32,743
You don't expect me to allow you
to tarnish my reputation, do you?

1245
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,714
You'd draw a sword on your king?

1246
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:35,977
Well...

1247
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,988
you will not pass.

1248
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:42,182
The reporters are right inside.

1249
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:46,791
Yes, and Oliver has his instructions.

1250
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:48,489
Eddie!

1251
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,462
You will not be attending
this press conference.

1252
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:56,895
Like hell he won't!

1253
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,872
Aah!

1254
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:05,176
Paige... go to the press conference.

1255
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,009
Eddie.

1256
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:08,212
Go.

1257
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:09,409
I've got it.

1258
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,152
You're a young fool.

1259
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,050
And you, sir...

1260
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:19,186
are an old fool.

1261
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:28,833
You have no idea
what it takes to govern a country.

1262
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:31,395
What? With lies and deceit?

1263
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:45,212
My people will believe
what I tell them to believe.

1264
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:06,331
The people will believe the truth.

1265
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,466
Aah!

1266
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,115
Gentlemen. Ladies.

1267
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,214
Quiet, please.

1268
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:27,022
In 20 minutes, we shall adjourn
to the chamber for the vote.

1269
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:30,087
Thank you all for attending
this special session of the Folketing

1270
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,496
during your holidays.

1271
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:37,832
Come on, it's this way.

1272
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:39,396
No, it's this way.

1273
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:48,142
I'm not done yet.

1274
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,722
I run this country.

1275
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,195
You are a figurehead.

1276
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:06,092
I am the head of state.

1277
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:29,686
The monarch is leaving.

1278
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,248
There's something going on.

1279
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,817
The king had better not be
standing him up again.

1280
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,329
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.

1281
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,468
As you know, King Edvard
and Queen Paige of Denmark

1282
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:42,833
came to Belavia to impede progress,

1283
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:47,398
to stop what could be a great
economic boon for both our countries.

1284
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,641
You cannot defeat me!

1285
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,011
I can, and I will.

1286
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,818
Information has come to our attention.

1287
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:04,347
I warn you that this material
is sordid in nature.

1288
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:05,757
Stop!

1289
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,157
It's the king...

1290
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,164
and the prime minister?

1291
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,358
Eddie!

1292
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:12,957
Wait, I have this manuscript.

1293
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:14,865
It's really very saucy!

1294
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,673
Enough!

1295
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:34,084
Do you yield?

1296
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:43,453
Your Majesty,
a question for the <i>Post.</i>

1297
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:49,192
That was impressive.

1298
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:51,432
Don't act so surprised.
We're on TV.

1299
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,331
I'm not surprised.

1300
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:57,377
You're my hero.

1301
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,307
May I have your attention, please.

1302
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:49,220
Attention, please.

1303
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,094
His Majesty is speaking.

1304
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,964
The prime minister
has attempted to coerce

1305
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:55,764
and blackmail us,

1306
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,203
even tarnish the queen's good name,

1307
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:02,972
all in an effort to steal and destroy
the resources of Belavia.

1308
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,877
<i>I speak directly to Parliament</i>

1309
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:09,508
<i>when I ask you to vote down</i>
<i>the measure before you.</i>

1310
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:13,715
This kingdom
and its natural resources

1311
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:17,280
belong to its own people...

1312
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,190
and any attempt
to usurp them is a crime.

1313
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,824
<i>Denmark will help Belavia,</i>

1314
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,561
<i>but not by taking... by giving,</i>

1315
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:31,196
<i>by developing</i>
<i>its greatest assets, its people,</i>

1316
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:32,671
its vast forests,

1317
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:34,732
<i>and the unique wildlife they harbor.</i>

1318
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:41,714
Queen Paige and I will work tirelessly
to promote the wonders of this country.

1319
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:42,977
And so...

1320
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:46,078
<i>on this Christmas Eve...</i>

1321
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:51,348
<i>I urge you to remember what is</i>
<i>important to the Belavian people</i>

1322
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:52,859
<i>and to Denmark.</i>

1323
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:57,491
I urge you to vote
with your heads...

1324
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,497
and with your hearts.

1325
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:03,895
Thank you, sir.

1326
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:13,737
And now, Scott Alberson
would like to say a few words.

1327
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:14,941
Scott?

1328
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:25,886
Hi.

1329
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,325
Scott Alberson.

1330
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:30,758
I wrote this book.

1331
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:34,001
None of it is true.

1332
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:37,028
Oh, yeah, and I'm a big jerk.

1333
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,232
Questions?

1334
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:42,371
Thank you.

1335
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,172
Soren?

1336
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:48,340
Pardon me, Your Majesty,
I didn't mean to interrupt your...

1337
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:51,078
<i>relaxing holiday.</i>
<i>I thought you should know</i>

1338
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:52,449
that Parliament has voted.

1339
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:57,617
It's a landslide.
Belavia is safe.

1340
01:24:58,626 --> 01:24:59,684
Eddie!

1341
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:01,228
- What?
- We did it.

1342
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:02,456
- We did it?
- We won.

1343
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:05,695
- We did it?
- We did it.

1344
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,997
- <i></i>
- Hello?

1345
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:12,299
Hello?

1346
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,340
<i>I'm still here.</i>

1347
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:22,041
Yes?

1348
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,779
<i>Yes, if I may, I wanted to say</i>
<i>something poignant,</i>

1349
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:26,343
and here it is...

1350
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:29,646
you did this, the two of you...

1351
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:32,159
<i>and I'm very proud of you.</i>

1352
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,922
Thank you, Soren.

1353
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:35,155
You're welcome.

1354
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:37,858
Now...

1355
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,661
may I speak with the king, please?

1356
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:40,860
Yes.

1357
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,803
Hello, Soren?

1358
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:45,632
Really?

1359
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,334
Well, I will let her know.

1360
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:49,674
Thank you, Soren.

1361
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:52,612
Let me know what?

1362
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,547
Nothing. Just got
your Christmas present.

1363
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:56,777
Oh.

1364
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:03,115
So, uh, I'm going to take off.

1365
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,624
I'm sorry.

1366
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:06,159
Really.

1367
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:08,819
Okay.

1368
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:11,991
Scott, you did the right thing...
eventually.

1369
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:16,500
You're a good guy.
You just need to remember that.

1370
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,868
Quite a girl you got there.

1371
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,399
Yeah. I know.

1372
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:25,537
Oh, by the way, I spoke
to the governor of Wisconsin...

1373
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,205
who spoke to your mother's bank.

1374
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:30,649
You did? You did that?

1375
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:34,449
They're going to help you work out
a more reasonable payment plan.

1376
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,649
Everything's going to be fine.

1377
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:39,124
Thank you.
Thank you. I'm, uh...

1378
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,889
I'm going to try and earn this.

1379
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:42,054
Good.

1380
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:43,654
Thank you.

1381
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:45,221
Come here, you.

1382
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:02,678
Okay.

1383
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:13,917
Merry Christmas.

1384
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,690
Look at you, Mr. Romance.

1385
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:19,221
Well, this is Christmas Eve,
and a particularly special one.

1386
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,494
What do you mean?

1387
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:27,035
Your Christmas present.

1388
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,946
I figured you'd need a new one...

1389
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:35,374
for your new job.

1390
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:36,712
What?

1391
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,718
Soren took a call
from the chief resident

1392
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,720
at Copenhagen Hospital
this afternoon.

1393
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:45,759
I hear doctors have
a very exhausting first year.

1394
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,126
But do you think I should?

1395
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:54,294
I could put it off...
you know, focus on being a queen.

1396
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:55,893
Is that what you want?

1397
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:00,640
No.

1398
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:06,947
I don't think there's
only one way to be a queen.

1399
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:08,846
This is my way.

1400
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:13,580
Well, at least we had a relaxing
break before you start work.

1401
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:17,318
I had a wonderful time,
a wonderful honeymoon.

1402
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:22,887
Merry Christmas, Paige.

1403
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,007
Merry Christmas,
Eddie.

1404
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:52,418
Shall we?

1405
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:54,688
I think so.

1406
