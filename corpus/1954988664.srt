1
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:07,908
**...

2
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:14,915
Hi, tiny.

3
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,884
I think it's time I told you

4
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,619
How you came into this world.

5
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,852
And even though you're way too

6
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:20,853
Young to hear this, you should

7
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:21,822
Hear it from me instead of

8
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,423
Someone else.

9
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,991
Your mom was once

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,993
The girl next door.

11
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,497
But I love sex, and some

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,565
People thought it was

13
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:32,399
A bad thing.

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,866
( Moaning )

15
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:35,236
People have called me a slut,

16
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,737
But I have learned that a slut

17
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:37,770
Is just a woman with

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,240
The morals of a man.

19
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,773
Good boy!

20
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:43,711
Ah!

21
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,179
Oh...

22
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,748
Aaah! Whoo-hoo!

23
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,050
Ha ha ha!

24
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,385
Who's your big mama?

25
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,555
You're my big mama.

26
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,690
Now it's your turn.

27
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,192
Um, what?

28
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,060
Come here.

29
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,431
Daddy, I've been a bad girl.

30
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,833
( Chuckling ) Excuse me?

31
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,534
Spank me.

32
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,202
Okay.

33
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:11,872
Harder.

34
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,642
( Laughing )

35
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:17,910
Most guys can't

36
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,248
Hang with me.

37
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,116
"Most" guys?

38
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,617
I wonder what the record is

39
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,085
For the most times anyone's ever

40
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,388
Had sex in one night?

41
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,789
Mmm...

42
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,126
I don't know, but... I think

43
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,294
It's safe to say we broke

44
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,962
The north American record.

45
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,598
Wouldn't garlic ice cream

46
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,733
Be perfect right now?

47
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,534
Mmm. I could go for

48
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,536
Some corn ice cream.

49
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,405
I think you can mix anything

50
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,506
With ice cream and it'd

51
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,709
Still be good.

52
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,879
What about kimchi?

53
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,515
That actually sounds yummy.

54
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,917
So tell me more about yourself.

55
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,120
What do you do?

56
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,623
Oh...

57
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,957
Why don't we just lie here

58
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,527
And think about ice cream?

59
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:08,996
Wait.

60
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,535
Don't move. I want to take

61
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,103
Your picture just like that.

62
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,239
No...

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,106
I create one every time

64
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,809
I have sex with someone

65
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,811
To remind me where I've been.

66
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,314
Kind of like postcards.

67
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,080
( Laughs )

68
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,753
Oh, you.

69
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,746
( Vomiting )

70
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,604
Hmm. Good morning.

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,341
I didn't, uh...

72
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,711
Know you were so into cooking.

73
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,713
I'm not. I'm an eater.

74
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,748
I like looking at the pictures.

75
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,717
It's my porn.

76
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,319
( Laughs )

77
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,520
I like that.

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,256
But you know what?

79
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,191
I'd really like to see your art.

80
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,133
Ah.

81
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,370
He's my supermodel.

82
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,338
I can't quite seem to

83
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:58,906
Get him right, though.

84
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,072
I've been working on him

85
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:01,709
For a year.

86
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,577
Chalamushi.

87
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,680
You didn't think I'd know?

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,082
You never struck me

89
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:09,750
As a foodie.

90
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,683
Ah.

91
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,172
( Ringtones play )

92
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,719
Angela: Gabriel?

93
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,422
Hello, Gabriel, are you there?

94
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,890
Hello, Angela.

95
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,591
Oh, thank God. I need you

96
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,759
To go to the store right now

97
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,494
And buy me three

98
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,795
Home pregnancy tests.

99
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,663
Okay, but...

100
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,264
What are they gonna think

101
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,699
If they see me buying

102
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,368
A home pregnancy test?

103
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,036
Oh, my God, you're gay...

104
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,604
No one's gonna think anything!

105
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,405
Okay, okay, okay.

106
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,374
Just one last thing

107
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:07,341
I need from you,

108
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,609
One last favor.

109
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,009
Please? Please!

110
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:10,943
Okay, I'll be there

111
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,613
In half a minute.

112
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:13,913
Okay.

113
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,417
Okay, wait. Maybe ten.

114
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,367
He's a hottie.

115
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,935
Mister hottie.

116
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:38,038
Yeah. So, the cute checker

117
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,271
Finally gave me his

118
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:40,573
Phone number.

119
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,641
It's ironic he only talked to me

120
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,411
After he thought I was straight.

121
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,112
Didn't he think it was a bad

122
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,380
Sign you were buying three

123
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,147
Home pregnancy tests?

124
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:48,882
I told him they were

125
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,117
For my mom.

126
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,985
She's a regular at the store.

127
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,523
So, I would not stress.

128
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,925
I'm not stressed.

129
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,225
I know for a fact that

130
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,360
You are not pregnant.

131
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,062
Thank God, but how

132
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,330
Would you know that?

133
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,597
Well, your horoscope didn't

134
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,798
Say anything about surprises

135
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,900
This morning.

136
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,638
Check again.

137
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,606
How accurate can

138
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,241
Those things be?

139
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,045
Ninety-nine point eight

140
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,747
Percent of the time.

141
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:20,681
Have you ever heard

142
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,715
Of the pill?

143
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,384
It makes me feel bloated.

144
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,553
Oh. And this is so much

145
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,086
Better.

146
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,121
You're the one that told me

147
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,557
To relax and have fun.

148
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,590
I never told you to have

149
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,560
Unprotected sex.

150
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,199
Do you have any idea

151
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,769
Who the daddy could be?

152
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,605
Could be anyone.

153
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,239
How many people could you

154
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,340
Have slept with in the last

155
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,577
Two months?

156
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,314
Where are your cards?

157
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,618
All right. Pick out the people

158
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,718
You slept with in the last

159
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,420
Two months.

160
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,693
Damn, girl!

161
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,296
All right. Pick out the people

162
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,531
You didn't use protection with.

163
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,006
All right, well, that's better.

164
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,108
5-second guy...

165
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,676
Nice-but-boring...

166
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,944
Mystery man...

167
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,779
Oh, and Mr. hottie.

168
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,315
( Knock on door )

169
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,415
Woman: Angela?

170
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,850
Ohh!

171
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,352
Angela, open this door!

172
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,155
We were supposed to meet

173
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,255
For dinner last night.

174
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,124
I don't even want to know

175
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,791
What you were doing instead.

176
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,192
So what were you doing?

177
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,294
Where were you?

178
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,096
I thought you said

179
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,032
You don't want to know.

180
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,571
Congratulate me!

181
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,506
I think I'm pregnant.

182
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,206
Who's the father?

183
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,810
Angela, how can you not know

184
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,980
Who the father is?

185
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,248
I... Know who the father is.

186
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,551
Kind of.

187
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,785
Well, what are those?

188
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,487
They're like...

189
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,255
Baseball cards.

190
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,124
But so much better.

191
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,961
Angela, I'm really

192
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,595
Disappointed in you.

193
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,732
All right...

194
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,933
Do you want my sisterly advice?

195
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,268
No.

196
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,336
Maybe this is God's way of

197
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:27,206
Saying settle down, grow up,

198
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,275
And be truly happy for once

199
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,578
In your life.

200
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,146
You must be joking!

201
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,148
Look, I will go to

202
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,584
The clinic with you.

203
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,218
My irresponsible single mom

204
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,620
Really fucked me up.

205
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,088
Abortion is murder.

206
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,289
Really?

207
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,422
Yeah.

208
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,191
Angela cannot take care

209
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,526
Of this baby on her own.

210
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,795
Would you stay out of

211
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,428
Our family business?

212
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,931
He's right. I can't take

213
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,067
Care of myself, let alone

214
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,935
Another person.

215
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:56,936
You are not that young

216
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,270
Anymore.

217
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,573
And even if you found the right

218
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,540
Guy, it is going to be harder

219
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,142
And harder for you to

220
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,011
Have a baby.

221
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,277
You'd be surprised how hard it

222
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:06,478
Was for me to have the twins

223
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:08,849
Because I waited too long.

224
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,551
Congratulations.

225
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,086
You're pregnant.

226
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,455
How long?

227
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:16,590
Seven weeks.

228
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,725
I mean, how much longer

229
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:18,691
Do I have?

230
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,560
Well, it usually takes

231
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,930
About 40 weeks, but the baby

232
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,963
Will let you know when

233
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,165
It's ready.

234
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,498
What if I'm not ready?

235
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:27,567
Is there some way to

236
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,502
Slow it down?

237
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,805
Would you like to see it?

238
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,845
It looks like a peanut.

239
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,581
Okay.

240
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,150
Maybe we can get married.

241
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,950
Ha ha ha!

242
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,852
We can raise the kid

243
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:45,985
Together.

244
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,920
I'd rather die.

245
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,623
It's not you, it's just the idea

246
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,692
Of being with you...

247
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,492
Forever.

248
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,526
Anyway, I thought we decided

249
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:55,362
You were gonna get it

250
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,097
Taken care of.

251
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,530
I was just thinking

252
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,966
Out loud.

253
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,202
Hmm.

254
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,171
What are you doing?

255
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,340
Lawrence from the

256
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,710
Convenience store?

257
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,979
Uh-huh.

258
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,580
I've seen him every day

259
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,514
This week.

260
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,683
He's young.

261
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,516
I know.

262
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,451
Does he know what kind

263
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,354
Of guy you are?

264
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,189
What is that supposed

265
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,290
To mean?

266
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,023
Does he know about

267
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,257
All your issues?

268
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,392
Oh, now I have issues?

269
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,427
Yeah.

270
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,327
Yeah, I told him.

271
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,095
And you're still gonna

272
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,029
Go to Las Vegas with him

273
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,098
And visit your grandparents?

274
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,834
And?

275
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,367
He's young and Canadian.

276
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,837
He's gonna get the wrong idea.

277
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,206
Hey!

278
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,106
Jesus, you already

279
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,107
Sold him to me.

280
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,275
Shut up.

281
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,744
Hey, you.

282
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,847
Angela.

283
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,014
So you're the one

284
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,818
That makes the cards.

285
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,118
Yeah.

286
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,385
Has Gabriel made one

287
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:54,386
For me yet?

288
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,159
No.

289
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,592
Good. Why don't we

290
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:02,662
Keep it that way?

291
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,864
Okay.

292
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,131
Okay?

293
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,266
Oh, God, I think

294
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,502
I'm gonna be sick.

295
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,870
No, seriously.

296
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,572
Oh...!

297
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,909
* nine-inch remedy

298
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:19,713
* I need a nine-inch remedy

299
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:23,550
* I need a nine-inch remedy

300
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,087
* I need a nine-inch remedy

301
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,923
( music continues )

302
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,861
Hi, Angela.

303
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,127
I didn't know you

304
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,029
Worked here.

305
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,798
I'm actually about to

306
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,833
Go on break.

307
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,795
( Baby crying )

308
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,529
Did you hear that?

309
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,997
Hear what?

310
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,602
I... I'm sorry.

311
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,669
I can't.

312
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,286
You can't even smoke anymore.

313
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,423
Candy cigs. You want one?

314
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,690
Do I want candy cigs?

315
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,625
Uh-huh.

316
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,592
No.

317
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,262
No smoking, no drinking,

318
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,063
No coffee. Getting knocked up

319
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,066
Is the worst std ever.

320
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,035
That guy gave me some coke.

321
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,135
You want some?

322
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,205
What? It's not like

323
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,942
You're gonna keep it.

324
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,444
I'm too old for this.

325
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,778
You're not too old.

326
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,980
I found another white

327
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,780
Pubic hair this morning!

328
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,535
Hello.

329
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,804
Is anyone home?

330
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,440
Angela: I never quite got

331
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,910
Along with your aunt.

332
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,777
I was the rebel, and she was

333
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,080
The good girl with the perfect

334
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,613
Husband and two kids straight

335
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,583
Out of the gap catalogue.

336
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,951
I wouldn't have admitted it

337
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,920
Then, but part of me wanted

338
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,154
That life.

339
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,191
So, how was your trip, dad?

340
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,997
Both: It was amazing!

341
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,098
Everyone should try peyote

342
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,631
At least once.

343
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,634
It totally frees the mind.

344
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,702
And you know what

345
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,570
We found out? We have

346
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,407
The same animal spirit.

347
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,842
We have wolves watching over us.

348
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,512
( Both howl )

349
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:12,118
I'm ready for dessert.

350
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:19,325
Well, I think she's

351
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,894
Handling it pretty good.

352
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,429
Could have been much worse.

353
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,695
Much worse.

354
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:24,531
At least you've turned out

355
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,631
Pretty well.

356
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,400
Thanks, dad.

357
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,081
Did you see how young she is?

358
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,348
I mean, she's younger than us.

359
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,951
It's like dad is dating one of

360
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,886
Our friends' younger sisters.

361
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,254
Good for dad. He deserves

362
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,389
To have a little fun after

363
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,557
Everything he's gone through,

364
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,291
Don't you think?

365
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,792
Or maybe not.

366
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,428
She seemed a little young.

367
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,164
Let's talk about... You.

368
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,764
How are you doing?

369
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,765
Have you started looking

370
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,900
For the father yet?

371
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,269
I'm tired. I don't want

372
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,335
To talk about me.

373
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,670
Angela, if you are not

374
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,106
Careful, this could be

375
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,275
Your future.

376
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,377
Who's your mama?!

377
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,077
( Whip cracks )

378
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,544
Who's your mama?!

379
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,280
( Whip cracks )

380
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,447
Who's your grandmama?

381
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,762
We need to talk.

382
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,333
Sometimes it takes an

383
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,735
Unexpected mistake...

384
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,106
I mean miracle...

385
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,574
To wake people up.

386
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,044
You're my miracle.

387
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,445
Do you understand what

388
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,679
I'm trying to say?

389
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,419
I should figure out

390
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,622
Who the father is.

391
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,623
You're serious about

392
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,491
Having this baby?

393
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,891
Is that crazy?

394
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:00,960
You want the truth?

395
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,994
Of course.

396
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,930
It's insane.

397
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,197
Oh! Oh, oh!

398
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,499
Oh! Oh!

399
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,867
You should sell it!

400
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,401
Yeah! People are paying

401
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,403
Like $40,000 to adopt babies

402
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,439
From China.

403
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,773
Don't say that. I don't want

404
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:14,740
The baby to hear anything

405
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,741
Negative.

406
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:16,543
You're the one who said you

407
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:17,644
Didn't want to have kids.

408
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,645
Now that it's happening,

409
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,246
I'm gonna go with it.

410
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,015
So shut up and help me

411
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,217
Figure out who the father is.

412
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:27,354
I put my money on

413
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:28,920
5-second guy.

414
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,358
It's always the quick ones.

415
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,040
( Music plays )

416
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,517
Come on, you're

417
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,152
Ruining my buzz.

418
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,728
Whoo!

419
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,997
Whoo!

420
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,234
Hey.

421
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,269
Hey.

422
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,404
You look familiar.

423
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:18,771
Have me ever met before?

424
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:22,409
( Both laugh )

425
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,410
You know, if I was as pretty

426
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,911
As you are...

427
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,178
I don't think I'd be here

428
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,547
All alone.

429
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,217
Oh. ( Giggles )

430
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,250
I know what you need.

431
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,285
Hmm?

432
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,021
Ooh. ( Laughs )

433
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,324
Okay, close your eyes.

434
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,891
Close your eyes, all right?

435
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,927
Now... I'm gonna kiss you.

436
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,795
Okay?

437
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:44,996
Really?

438
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:46,031
I'm gonna kiss you, though,

439
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,600
Like I'm going down on you.

440
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,967
Oh...

441
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,036
Mmm... Mmm.

442
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,939
Oh... Mmm...

443
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,745
( Both panting )

444
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,213
Well, come on.

445
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,348
Just... just let me...

446
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,349
Just let me put it in

447
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,516
And wiggle it around

448
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,918
A little bit, okay?

449
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,553
Okay. I... uh...

450
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,889
Unh! Unh!

451
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,959
Unh! Unnhh! Unhh!

452
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:16,429
Oh... Oh... Oh...

453
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,604
I can go again.

454
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,039
Say "cheese."

455
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,378
And you want to see him

456
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,614
Again because?

457
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,783
He could be the father.

458
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,417
Okay.

459
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,519
Will you cover for me?

460
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,454
Uh-huh.

461
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,989
Thanks.

462
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,926
Crazy.

463
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,468
Hi.

464
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,637
Hey.

465
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,239
Um, have you seen this guy

466
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,140
Around here?

467
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,175
Oh, yeah.

468
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,676
( Laughs )

469
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,745
Isn't this senor quickie?

470
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,348
Yep. I know him.

471
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,982
Mr. minute man.

472
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,350
Comes in here all the time.

473
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,519
Mr. oops.

474
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,387
Mr. premature ejaculator.

475
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,587
Look, if you're gonna

476
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,056
Shoot him, can we watch?

477
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,459
In fact, you can have him.

478
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:21,328
I'll give you his address.

479
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,682
He knock you up too?

480
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,117
I swear, my brother could

481
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,854
Impregnate by sight.

482
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:48,788
He had the strongest

483
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,956
Little swimmers.

484
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,090
Come on in.

485
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:05,037
He died a couple of days ago.

486
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,638
Suicide. Drug overdose.

487
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,341
No one knows for sure.

488
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,342
I'm...

489
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,142
Oh, don't be sorry.

490
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,045
He was a jackal.

491
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,915
Are they all...

492
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,785
Mm-hmm. He was a regular

493
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,020
Johnny bastard seed.

494
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,490
How do they all know

495
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,593
That he's... The...

496
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:27,460
You don't know who

497
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,895
The father is, do you?

498
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:29,829
( Cell phone rings )

499
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,731
I know who the father is.

500
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,733
Marissa? Your phone.

501
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,634
Excuse me.

502
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,706
Angela: Okay, okay, okay.

503
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,275
I know it's extremely

504
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,576
Disrespectful...

505
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,346
But I had to know.

506
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,459
Gabriel: I don't know

507
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,260
What the big deal is.

508
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,795
It was just a bee-Jay.

509
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,298
I hope I'm just not

510
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,100
Some fuck-buddy to you.

511
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,469
No, that's...

512
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,439
That's not what I meant.

513
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,273
Then why don't you say

514
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,307
What you mean?

515
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,143
It's not a big deal.

516
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,078
You know, I really liked you.

517
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:22,782
But you're just some

518
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,416
Gay cliche.

519
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,389
No, look. I just...

520
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:45,805
Why is that you don't know

521
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,238
What you have until he yells

522
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:48,239
At you and swears he never

523
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:50,041
Wants to see you again?

524
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:50,943
There's a lot of fish

525
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:51,944
In the sea.

526
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:52,744
But he's the only one

527
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,313
I want to mount now.

528
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,348
You do realize you always

529
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,349
Liked him but were too afraid

530
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,351
To admit it yourself?

531
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,386
Why didn't you say

532
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:00,453
Anything to me?

533
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:01,320
I did.

534
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,694
I have an idea.

535
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,729
Let's get out of here.

536
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:28,747
You don't even know

537
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,583
Who the father is yet.

538
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,550
If I plan it,

539
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,219
The groom will come.

540
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,688
You're completely insane.

541
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,091
Hey...

542
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:43,396
Can I plan my wedding too?

543
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,932
Why not? Let's do it.

544
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:46,765
Right?

545
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,299
Okay.

546
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,103
How do I look?

547
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:53,540
Tell me the truth.

548
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,706
You look...

549
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,174
Better than me.

550
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,944
Ha ha ha ha!

551
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,345
I know.

552
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,312
And the tiara's

553
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:01,380
A nice touch.

554
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,483
I know, right?

555
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,718
It's cute.

556
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:06,485
Angela: Does he look

557
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,754
Familiar?

558
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,522
What about him?

559
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,124
Hello, baby.

560
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,059
No?

561
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,326
Please tell me

562
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,863
It's not this guy.

563
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,899
Not familiar?

564
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,571
Honesty is the key

565
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,372
To all relationships.

566
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,475
But if you can fake it,

567
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,042
You're in.

568
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,378
Nobody dies a virgin.

569
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,048
Life screws us all.

570
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,282
So, what do I do

571
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,350
About Lawrence?

572
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,152
Men are like roses...

573
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:43,422
Watch out for the pricks.

574
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,255
Where are you getting

575
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:45,525
These one-liners from anyways?

576
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:47,026
The Internet?

577
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,860
How'd you know?

578
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,161
What?! You finally learned

579
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:51,964
How to use the Internet, dad?

580
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:55,034
Becky taught me.

581
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,536
You're like the dog carrying

582
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,104
The bone over the bridge.

583
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,206
As he was crossing the bridge,

584
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,440
He saw this reflection.

585
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,576
He thought it was another dog

586
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,544
With a bone.

587
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,178
So he reached for the other

588
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:10,649
Bone. He lost both bones.

589
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,618
You're the dog,

590
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,120
Lawrence is the bone.

591
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,656
Okay, so what do I do?

592
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,924
You jump in and fetch

593
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,192
The bone.

594
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:20,960
But what if the bone

595
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,160
Doesn't want to be found?

596
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,462
You keep looking.

597
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,198
A good bone is hard to find.

598
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,300
Ha ha ha ha!

599
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,004
You should put that

600
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,372
On a fortune cookie!

601
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:39,579
Angela: I want you

602
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,880
To know I've changed.

603
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,082
I'm gonna be a different

604
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,216
Person now, okay?

605
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,488
You need some serious help.

606
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,322
She can hear you.

607
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:57,263
Go away from the light!

608
00:24:57,263 --> 00:25:00,499
Weirdo.

609
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,703
All right, who's next?

610
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,170
Mystery man.

611
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,437
Hmm.

612
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,273
You know, the one

613
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,473
I keep hooking up with.

614
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,708
Yes.

615
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,811
Mm-hmm. Hot.

616
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:12,944
Mm-hmm.

617
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,422
( Stops laughing abruptly )

618
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,992
Oh.

619
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,628
Okay, hot or not?

620
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:29,861
Hot.

621
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,296
Yeah, definitely.

622
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,230
But more importantly,

623
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,566
Gay or straight?

624
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,234
Straight.

625
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,736
How do you know?

626
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:37,869
My straight-dar

627
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,171
Is tingling.

628
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,640
Hmm.

629
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:50,982
See? I told you.

630
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,350
And there it is.

631
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,552
All right, off you go, girl.

632
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,687
Shoot for happy days to make

633
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:55,722
For happy nights.

634
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:56,555
( Slap )

635
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,690
Oh! Okay.

636
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,625
Good one.

637
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:05,997
It's supposed to be a girl

638
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,367
And her dog at the park.

639
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:12,738
What does it look like to you?

640
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,807
I see courage.

641
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,442
Those lines are painted with

642
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:19,510
Such aggressive intention,

643
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,846
It makes me think the artist

644
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:21,948
Doesn't care what you think

645
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,249
About her.

646
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,117
You're on crack.

647
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,754
Honesty. Nice.

648
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,155
Honest Angela.

649
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:31,723
Crackhead Jefferson.

650
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,291
Nice to meet you.

651
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,627
Nice to meet you, too.

652
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:37,664
Do you want to come?

653
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:40,431
No. Do you?

654
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:41,267
Just pull out

655
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,068
Before you come.

656
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,205
( Both panting, moaning )

657
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,651
( Dialing )

658
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,021
Sorry.

659
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,023
I need your signature here.

660
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,760
Yeah. Okay.

661
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,860
Hey, don't forget, we have

662
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,862
Dinner with the kengs

663
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,262
At six-thirty tonight.

664
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,831
Okay, great. Thanks.

665
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,565
Okay, so...

666
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:16,835
Hey, do you have a minute?

667
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,505
Yeah. What's up?

668
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,140
Um...

669
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,407
( Cell phone rings )

670
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,474
I was thinking...

671
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:25,712
Hold on.

672
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:27,379
Hi.

673
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,115
No, of course I have a second.

674
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,752
What are you doing?

675
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,385
Unbelievable.

676
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,389
What are you doing tonight?

677
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:39,958
Well, I'm hanging out

678
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,626
With you.

679
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,495
Okay, then. I'll call you later.

680
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:46,365
Bye.

681
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,867
Okay.

682
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,634
The mayor cancelled.

683
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,103
His mom had a heart attack.

684
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,808
Why are you smiling?

685
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,545
Could you do me a favor?

686
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,810
We're closed.

687
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,045
( Laughs ) I'm kidding.

688
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,524
Chalamushi.

689
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:50,095
Because flowers are so cliche.

690
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,665
I had them close for us tonight.

691
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:56,567
I know the owner.

692
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,271
He let me use the kitchen.

693
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,740
And I thought...

694
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,975
The real thing would

695
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,276
Inspire you.

696
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,113
Who are you?

697
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:09,081
What exactly do you do,

698
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,381
Mr. Lee?

699
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,250
He's running for

700
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,450
City council.

701
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,852
Thanks.

702
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,121
Why didn't you tell me

703
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,687
You were a politician?

704
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:18,124
I liked the fact

705
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,826
That you didn't know.

706
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:20,927
Thank you.

707
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,196
You really made all this

708
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,265
For me?

709
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,800
It was nothin'.

710
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,735
Don't be Asian.

711
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,271
So...

712
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,873
How long you been drawing?

713
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:35,541
Oh, my life is boring.

714
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,742
Let's talk about you.

715
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,311
How does it feel to be

716
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,079
A big-time politician?

717
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,247
Well, I'm not a big-time

718
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,415
Politician.

719
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,749
I'd vote for you.

720
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,084
Really? You don't even know

721
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,618
What I stand for.

722
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:50,688
Okay, Hitler: Bad or good?

723
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:51,924
Bad.

724
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:52,723
See? I'd vote for you

725
00:29:52,723 --> 00:29:54,659
Already.

726
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,227
Okay. Family values

727
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,595
Are important to me.

728
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,729
I'm pro-business...

729
00:29:58,729 --> 00:29:59,530
Okay, maybe I wouldn't

730
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,698
Vote for you after all.

731
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:01,800
But my sister would.

732
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,469
Really? What's she

733
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,569
Doing right now?

734
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,504
She sounds like

735
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,673
The better sibling.

736
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,040
I'm just kidding.

737
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,210
Ha ha. You're funny.

738
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,144
That's a good thing. I didn't

739
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:12,944
Think conservatives had

740
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,146
A sense of humor.

741
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,681
Wow.

742
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:16,682
Okay, where do you see

743
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:19,351
Yourself in five years?

744
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,585
What is this,

745
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,287
A job interview?

746
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,990
I'm just curious.

747
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,456
I see myself running for

748
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,158
The State Senate,

749
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,194
And I'd be married,

750
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,929
With two kids.

751
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,397
And we'd have a big house

752
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:32,964
With a big yard,

753
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:36,502
A dog and an s.U.V.

754
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,404
What about you? Where do you

755
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,805
See yourself in five years?

756
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,375
I like your answer.

757
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,283
Garlic ice cream,

758
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,053
Corn ice cream,

759
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,322
And kimchi ice cream.

760
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,190
How about, um, we just

761
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,692
Go back to my place?

762
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,947
What if I don't tell him

763
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:56,314
I'm pregnant right away?

764
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,715
Get him to fall in love with me

765
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,051
And convince him he's the

766
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,686
Baby's dad.

767
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:01,652
What if the baby doesn't

768
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:03,022
Look anything like him?

769
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,189
You're missing the point.

770
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:07,059
He likes me, and I like him.

771
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,794
Dad: Hey! If you two

772
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,396
Slowpokes keep talkin',

773
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:12,630
You'll never keep up with us!

774
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,966
Honey, he's gonna find out.

775
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,567
You have a better plan?

776
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,070
No. And what do I know?

777
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,871
Lawrence still hasn't called me.

778
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:24,310
You're pathetic.

779
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,477
Can I tell you something?

780
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,113
You promise you won't laugh?

781
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:27,946
You know I can't

782
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,780
Promise you that.

783
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,985
I'm, uh...

784
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:35,386
Thinking about re-virginizing.

785
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,156
And I want you to do it with me.

786
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,724
I found a group that'll

787
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:41,392
Help us start over.

788
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,860
We can wear white to

789
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,031
Our wedding.

790
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:47,499
And it'll mean something.

791
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,003
Virgins are happier,

792
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,771
Healthier, and more intelligent

793
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,241
Than those who engage in

794
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:58,010
Pre-marital sexual intercourse.

795
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,345
But more importantly, the

796
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:06,451
Fornicators will go to hell...

797
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,453
While the righteous virgins

798
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,422
Live eternally in heaven.

799
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,191
(Whispers) This is weird.

800
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,394
Who wants to go to hell?

801
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:16,995
All: Hell, no!

802
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,530
Both: Uh, hell, no.

803
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,531
Please raise your right hand

804
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,132
And repeat after me.

805
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,236
I swear that I will no longer

806
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,504
Engage...

807
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,971
All: I swear that

808
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,274
I will no longer engage...

809
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,841
In deviant bodily

810
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,910
Temptations of any kind...

811
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,745
In deviant bodily

812
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:37,415
Temptations of any kind...

813
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,118
Until I get married.

814
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:41,653
Until I get married.

815
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,123
That means even

816
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:47,693
Sinful self-pleasure.

817
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:48,727
Now, if everyone can stand

818
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,828
In line...

819
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,497
That's it?

820
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,235
Oh!

821
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,878
Okay, so, we just have to get

822
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,580
Cleansed and sign the virginity

823
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,315
Pledge and not engage in any

824
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,351
Sex, and we get our purity back.

825
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:13,452
This is easier than

826
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,421
Getting a driver's license.

827
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:17,188
Really?

828
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,095
Becky: Do you think dad

829
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,762
Is losing his mind?

830
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,497
He seems happy.

831
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,566
How can you say that?

832
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,101
He's miserable!

833
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:30,068
That is exactly why

834
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,737
He's acting like you.

835
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:32,571
You know, it is time that

836
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,872
You both learn to settle down

837
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,208
And take a deep breath,

838
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,375
You know?

839
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,212
( Inhales, exhales )

840
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,213
I'm already searching

841
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,513
For the father, and I really

842
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,981
Like one of them.

843
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,316
Marry him!

844
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,652
I'm working on it.

845
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:47,818
What's his name?

846
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:49,320
Jefferson Lee.

847
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,421
Like the guy running

848
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,889
For city council?

849
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,693
I see his signs everywhere.

850
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,100
Flour...

851
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,070
Put your hand on the corner...

852
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,338
Okay. Move it forward...

853
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:36,867
You know, you really should

854
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,936
Show your art.

855
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:39,870
Who wants to look

856
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,208
At crayon food?

857
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,475
Trust yourself.

858
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:49,580
He thought I could sell them.

859
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,749
I know. What do you think

860
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:51,482
I've been saying this

861
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,352
Whole time?

862
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:55,187
You should get rid of

863
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:56,053
These pledges.

864
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,423
It's kind of creepy.

865
00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:58,790
Oh, that reminds me.

866
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,592
I got you a gift.

867
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,795
Look, we can be twins.

868
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,531
Thanks.

869
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,699
So ungrateful.

870
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,835
( Doorbell rings )

871
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,770
( Gasps, laughs )

872
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,241
The wedding planner!

873
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:16,575
Here you go.

874
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:17,808
Woman: Thank you.

875
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,545
You're welcome.

876
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:20,811
So...

877
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,580
When do you two plan on

878
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,114
Getting married?

879
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,254
Uh, no. Ha ha!

880
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:30,655
Who's the lucky one, then?

881
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,890
Uh...

882
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,559
You're both getting married?

883
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,660
Yeah.

884
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,927
To different people?

885
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:38,864
Yeah.

886
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,165
But they don't know it yet.

887
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,567
Right.

888
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,634
See, if we plan it,

889
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:44,903
They will come.

890
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,305
Yeah.

891
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,505
So, do you think we can

892
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,541
Get a 2-for-1 discount?

893
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,643
Well, the meeting went well.

894
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,679
( Laughs )

895
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,318
She looked at us like

896
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,752
We were gonna kill her and put

897
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,220
Her head in the freezer.

898
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,889
Until we gave her

899
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,490
The cash deposit.

900
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,092
Ha ha ha ha!

901
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,795
Ha ha ha ha ha!

902
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,429
You're drunk!

903
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,067
Oh...

904
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,934
Oh, maybe I should

905
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,270
Call Lawrence.

906
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,038
Unh-unh. Drunk dialing

907
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,507
Is so unattractive.

908
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:24,109
No.

909
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,644
Come on. Go to bed.

910
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,246
Upsy-Daisy.

911
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,888
That's disturbing.

912
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:37,923
Don't tell me you're

913
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,291
Stalking him now.

914
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,926
Everybody has a stalker

915
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,059
Nowadays.

916
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,561
I don't have a stalker.

917
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,695
That's 'cause you are

918
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,897
The stalker.

919
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,498
I'm not stalking him.

920
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,034
Okay.

921
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:51,569
When's the last time

922
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,805
You went out?

923
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,105
I just don't feel like it

924
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:56,607
Anymore.

925
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,876
You need to go out

926
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,911
And have some fun.

927
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,547
Fun?

928
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,280
How am I supposed to

929
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,283
Have any fun?

930
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:09,587
No, no, no, don't, don't.

931
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,693
What is it about him?

932
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:18,629
He makes me want to be

933
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,466
A better guy.

934
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,803
( Cash register beeping )

935
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,545
Hey.

936
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,245
Hi.

937
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:38,850
Gabriel's a good guy.

938
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,050
He's a little slutty, but

939
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,619
Slutty's better than insane,

940
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,153
Right?

941
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:45,055
A dollar five.

942
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:45,957
At least he doesn't

943
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,325
Hear voices. I dated

944
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,360
A couple of guys who

945
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,428
Heard voices, one who

946
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,061
Even heard God.

947
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,368
It was good to see you.

948
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,819
Look, he's sorry.

949
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:16,286
Absolutely repentant.

950
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,256
Seventy-five cents.

951
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,357
For whatever it's worth,

952
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,392
I've never seen him this

953
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,259
Pathetic before.

954
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,296
Next.

955
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:28,867
Lawrence: Hi.

956
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,436
Woman: A pack of cigarettes.

957
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:32,404
Four ninety.

958
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:34,172
He even became

959
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:36,975
A born-again virgin for you!

960
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,309
That's just... Weird.

961
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:40,412
People do the weirdest things

962
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,913
When they're in love.

963
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,781
I've known Gabriel forever.

964
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:44,815
I've never seen him

965
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,519
Like this before.

966
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,954
I'm gonna do it!

967
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:51,221
Don't try and stop me!

968
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,962
He hates my guts.

969
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:58,029
Maybe if you just apologize

970
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,130
To him he'll take you back.

971
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,002
Really?

972
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:07,004
What would I say?

973
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,372
How about that you're sorry

974
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,642
And that you're an asshole?

975
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,076
Yeah, that's good.

976
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,880
I need to write that down.

977
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,881
Hey, I thought you were gonna

978
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,181
Get mystery man to fall in love

979
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,082
With you and convince him

980
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,349
It's his kid.

981
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:20,618
I was joking.

982
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:21,752
Uh, no you weren't.

983
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,853
I need to figure out who the

984
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,354
Father is no matter what.

985
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:25,355
Oh, really? 'Cause I have

986
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:26,992
An idea. Why don't we just, um,

987
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,759
Eenie-meenie-minee-mo, catch

988
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,462
A baby daddy by the toe.

989
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:31,730
Here he is. Here's the daddy.

990
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,665
Can we talk about me now?

991
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:42,941
Huge!

992
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,846
So my sister tells me

993
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,915
You sell boxes.

994
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,416
Uh...

995
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,123
Um...

996
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,558
Yeah, i...

997
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:01,826
I'm just...

998
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,262
Relax. I don't bite.

999
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:05,664
Well, there was that one guy.

1000
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,165
Never mind.

1001
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,299
( Chuckles nervously )

1002
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,502
Um...

1003
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,504
I'm just, uh...

1004
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,673
I'm not used to dating

1005
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,376
Beautiful girls like you.

1006
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,579
You're nice.

1007
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,747
Yeah, that's what girls say

1008
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:25,050
When they don't like someone.

1009
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,018
Which is fine, i...

1010
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,520
Let's just bypass all the

1011
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,920
Drama that comes with dating,

1012
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,991
Okay? And just be friends?

1013
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,396
Well, um, so long.

1014
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,066
It was nice meeting you.

1015
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,681
Uh, I thought we were

1016
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,215
Just friends.

1017
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:00,185
Haven't you heard of fwb?

1018
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,153
Uh, no.

1019
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,489
Friends with benefits.

1020
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,960
( Unzips zipper )

1021
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,162
Oh, my God! You're hung

1022
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,565
Like a dinosaur!

1023
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,300
Yeah.

1024
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,436
Wow! Wow!

1025
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:20,437
Ohh! Wow!

1026
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,074
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1027
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,710
Oh no what?

1028
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,178
Uh, I think the condom broke.

1029
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,986
So, I asked you to come today

1030
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,557
Because... I'm pregnant,

1031
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,459
And you might be the father.

1032
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:47,699
Pregnant?

1033
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:51,435
I'm gonna be a father!

1034
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,970
Ha ha! I'm gonna be

1035
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,106
A father!

1036
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:58,375
I'm gonna be a father!

1037
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,476
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1038
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,878
It's not for sure though.

1039
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,347
No, it's for sure.

1040
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:02,580
How do you know

1041
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,215
It's for sure?

1042
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:05,150
Because you're the only one

1043
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,884
I've been with.

1044
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,552
Ha ha ha!

1045
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:09,788
I'm gonna be a father!

1046
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:10,989
I told you that already. Sorry.

1047
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,192
I love you!

1048
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,561
Sorry, i... I'm sorry.

1049
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,063
I do, but I shouldn't have...

1050
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:18,796
No, I should have.

1051
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:19,698
I love you. I love you.

1052
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:22,133
I do. I love you.

1053
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:22,867
* taking a trip

1054
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,434
* to forget where I live

1055
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:27,872
* off the Avenue

1056
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,641
* and I wanna go

1057
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:31,342
* where the people...

1058
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,944
( Song continues )

1059
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,564
Hey.

1060
00:43:54,564 --> 00:43:55,300
I thought you were

1061
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,134
In Sacramento.

1062
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:56,934
Ah, you know,

1063
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:57,736
I came back early.

1064
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:59,337
Wanted to see you.

1065
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:00,638
Oh...

1066
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,109
Hey. Let's get

1067
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:05,276
Some ice cream.

1068
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:06,443
Oh, my God! What are you,

1069
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,779
Twelve? Ice cream?

1070
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,781
Get a room! Ohh!

1071
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:11,216
Ohh!

1072
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:18,588
Smile. Stand up straight.

1073
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:20,090
( Knocks on door )

1074
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:25,295
Hi.

1075
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,865
I, uh, I feel badly about

1076
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,701
The way it ended.

1077
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:32,302
Those are nice flowers.

1078
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,339
They're for a nice guy.

1079
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,374
Take them.

1080
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:39,711
That's so romantic.

1081
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:42,612
They'll make you feel better.

1082
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:48,954
( Exhales )

1083
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:50,956
You know, you're right.

1084
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:55,293
I feel much better now.

1085
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,661
( Mouthing words )

1086
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:59,297
Oh, um...

1087
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:01,366
I, uh,

1088
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,700
I wanted to apologize,

1089
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,436
And I wanted to tell you that

1090
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,805
I'm an asshole...

1091
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,574
And, uh, I won't drop

1092
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,841
The bone again.

1093
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,376
The bone? What are you

1094
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,377
Talking about?

1095
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,780
What?!

1096
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,346
Is Angela out there?

1097
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:19,250
Um... For moral support.

1098
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,051
Look, can I come in?

1099
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:26,690
Nod your head if someone

1100
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,459
Else is in there.

1101
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,330
Nod again if he's more

1102
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,498
Fabulous than me.

1103
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,836
Nod if he's way more

1104
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:39,270
Fabulous than me.

1105
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,204
Angela: Gabriel,

1106
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,307
We should get going.

1107
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:43,374
It was good to see you

1108
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,708
Again, Lawrence.

1109
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,377
This way. Come on.

1110
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:50,448
Why aren't you working on

1111
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,182
Your invitation list?

1112
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,355
There's no point.

1113
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:59,324
Suit yourself.

1114
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:00,624
Do you really believe

1115
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,293
He's gonna marry you?

1116
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:02,760
I do.

1117
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,629
Does he know about

1118
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:06,131
Your condition?

1119
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:07,398
Not yet.

1120
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:08,333
I hope you're planning on

1121
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,499
Telling him soon.

1122
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:10,700
I am.

1123
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:12,970
I am.

1124
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:13,738
You don't even know

1125
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,073
Anything about this guy.

1126
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:15,973
I googled him and

1127
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,374
Nothing too bad came up.

1128
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,743
You know he's a republican,

1129
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:20,610
Right?

1130
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,880
No one's perfect.

1131
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,480
They hate gay people.

1132
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,748
There are gay Republicans,

1133
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,017
Too.

1134
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:26,750
All right, what's his

1135
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,853
Favorite color, then?

1136
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:29,354
I've been in a relationship

1137
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:31,055
For years and not known that.

1138
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:33,291
You're just jealous.

1139
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,124
I found my man. I know what

1140
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,159
His favorite color is.

1141
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,361
It's orange.

1142
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:39,965
Do you know Fred's

1143
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,098
Favorite color?

1144
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,232
Blue.

1145
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,739
She's... Tiny.

1146
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:52,077
It's a he.

1147
00:46:52,077 --> 00:46:53,110
Do you have a name

1148
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,212
Picked out already?

1149
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,247
Tiny.

1150
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,817
( Laughs ) She's kidding.

1151
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,251
You're kidding.

1152
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,332
The best thing about being

1153
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,033
Pregnant is that it's an excuse

1154
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,937
To buy a whole new wardrobe.

1155
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:20,405
You don't have to do this.

1156
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:21,639
This is already the happiest

1157
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,508
Day of my life.

1158
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,610
Listen to me.

1159
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,279
Get married to Carlton.

1160
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,516
Carlton?

1161
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,450
Isn't that why you

1162
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,284
Brought him along?

1163
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,957
No!

1164
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,657
He's my newest stalker.

1165
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,896
Well, look, it doesn't matter

1166
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:47,132
If he's the father or not.

1167
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:49,766
Desperate times call

1168
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,070
For desperate measures.

1169
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,378
Can I borrow a quarter?

1170
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,918
What are you doing?

1171
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,862
( Mouths words )

1172
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:21,933
( Romantic French song )

1173
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,503
Mmm.

1174
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:29,173
You really should have

1175
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:30,540
Been a chef.

1176
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,842
Hmm. ( Chuckles )

1177
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:36,213
How'd you get in politics?

1178
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,183
Ah, well, my father

1179
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:40,085
Was a politician.

1180
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:43,054
And his father before him.

1181
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:45,155
And his father.

1182
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,125
Was in politics?

1183
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,560
Do you even like it?

1184
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:54,231
You should quit.

1185
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,332
I could see you on

1186
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,301
Iron chef America.

1187
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:04,175
It's not that easy.

1188
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,981
Can I ask you some questions?

1189
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:10,880
Only if it's not about

1190
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,051
My choice of careers.

1191
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:17,221
What's your favorite color?

1192
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:19,057
Green.

1193
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,225
Mine is red.

1194
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:22,426
If you get to an intersection

1195
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:23,328
And you don't know which way

1196
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:24,928
To turn, do you go left

1197
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,532
Or right?

1198
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:29,267
Left. Is that

1199
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,101
The right answer?

1200
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,237
I would go left, too.

1201
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,272
How many more questions

1202
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:35,905
Do you have?

1203
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,011
One more question.

1204
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:43,313
What if I told you

1205
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,215
I was pregnant?

1206
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,283
Would you make an honest

1207
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,718
Woman out of me?

1208
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,164
I thought you'd be happy.

1209
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:00,897
( Clears throat )

1210
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,832
I am.

1211
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:06,704
So...

1212
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:09,507
Is that a yes?

1213
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,750
I'm already engaged.

1214
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,058
Go.

1215
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:31,428
Okay, look, Angela...

1216
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,297
Go!

1217
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,909
( Door opens, closes )

1218
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,821
I can't believe he wouldn't

1219
00:50:56,821 --> 00:51:00,258
Tell me something like that.

1220
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:01,458
Weren't you kind of keeping

1221
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,959
Something important from him,

1222
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,662
Too?

1223
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:06,764
I'm just sayin'.

1224
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,602
What am I gonna do now?

1225
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,841
Fuck it. I'll marry you.

1226
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,810
We can be virginal and married.

1227
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:20,977
That oughta make us eligible

1228
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:23,080
For sainthood.

1229
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,214
What about your

1230
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,683
Commitment issues?

1231
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:26,550
We bicker all the time

1232
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,452
Anyway. We're practically

1233
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,887
Married already.

1234
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,055
That is true.

1235
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,626
I'm kinda cute.

1236
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,595
You're very cute.

1237
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:40,530
In fact, you're very hot.

1238
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,099
It's gonna be all right.

1239
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,533
Promise?

1240
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,303
Yep. We'll figure it out.

1241
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:47,305
Okay.

1242
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:49,207
I hear you got dumped.

1243
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,007
No more Internet advice.

1244
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,042
I'm not in the mood.

1245
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:54,712
Well, it wouldn't have

1246
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:56,214
Worked out anyway.

1247
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,080
What's that supposed

1248
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,249
To mean?

1249
00:51:58,249 --> 00:51:59,217
I'm tired of seeing you get

1250
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:00,450
Into these relationships and

1251
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,085
Watching them all end

1252
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:04,822
The same way.

1253
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:06,957
And how long have you known him?

1254
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,293
Almost four months.

1255
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,495
You can't expect to

1256
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:12,463
Know someone that soon.

1257
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,199
You'll meet someone else.

1258
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:16,501
Easy for you to say.

1259
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:17,602
You're young.

1260
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:19,036
What's the rush?

1261
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:20,738
I'm ready to share my life

1262
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:23,007
With somebody.

1263
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:25,074
And someday you'll meet

1264
00:52:25,074 --> 00:52:26,476
Someone who'll make you...

1265
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,045
I can't wait that long.

1266
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,815
Why?

1267
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:33,818
Because I'm pregnant.

1268
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,254
Is he the father?

1269
00:52:43,228 --> 00:52:45,230
Can you help me?

1270
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,534
( Grunting )

1271
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,702
Lord.

1272
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:53,503
( Panting )

1273
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,173
You think I'm fat, huh?

1274
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,709
I didn't say anything.

1275
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:03,180
God, who's gonna want to

1276
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,350
Marry a whale?

1277
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,018
It's gonna be okay.

1278
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,986
Get away from me!

1279
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,621
I'm sorry.

1280
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,096
Say something.

1281
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:19,797
You look like

1282
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:21,665
One of those cute whales...

1283
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,801
From seaworld.

1284
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,007
Let me get a look at you.

1285
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:34,945
Oh, God.

1286
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:38,249
(Romantic music on boombox)

1287
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:39,817
What the hell is that?

1288
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,618
Nice-but-boring guy.

1289
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,520
He turned into stalker guy

1290
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,588
Ever since I told him he could

1291
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,491
Be tiny's dad.

1292
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:48,157
Mm-mm-mm.

1293
00:53:48,157 --> 00:53:50,328
Baby papa drama.

1294
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,463
Don't change yet.

1295
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:54,664
Why?

1296
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,934
Trust me.

1297
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,970
Hey.

1298
00:54:03,172 --> 00:54:04,441
Is that for you?

1299
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,409
Don't ask.

1300
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,676
Hey.

1301
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,813
You look beautiful.

1302
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,915
( Turns off music )

1303
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,756
I invited him.

1304
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:19,723
Thought he should see you

1305
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:20,524
Before you're forced

1306
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,259
To marry me.

1307
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,828
This was a mistake.

1308
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:24,495
No.

1309
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,095
If abba can get back together,

1310
00:54:26,095 --> 00:54:27,697
I'm sure you two can work out

1311
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,066
Your differences.

1312
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:31,769
Abba never got back together.

1313
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,670
Hey.

1314
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,809
Look, I messed up...

1315
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,811
And I'm sorry.

1316
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:44,415
It's just...

1317
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,082
I'm 30 years old and I've

1318
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:48,353
Never done this before.

1319
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:51,389
And I got scared.

1320
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,058
Tell me something

1321
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:57,126
I don't know.

1322
00:54:57,126 --> 00:54:58,161
You're the only one

1323
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,530
I want to be with...

1324
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,466
And I'm ready to make

1325
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,232
A commitment to you.

1326
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:10,774
No ring?

1327
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,543
( Laughs )

1328
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:20,149
What is that?

1329
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:21,718
Steak fat sandwich with Mayo,

1330
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,354
Sirochi sauce, velveeta cheese

1331
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:24,788
And pickles. Can't get enough

1332
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,056
Of these.

1333
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:28,125
That looks good.

1334
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,494
Yeah?

1335
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:34,699
Mmm!

1336
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:36,666
Mmm!

1337
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,267
So this is the last

1338
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:39,470
Candidate, huh?

1339
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,738
Hmm. Mr. hottie.

1340
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,275
Can we just fuck?

1341
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:21,277
( Angela panting )

1342
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,115
Ohh!

1343
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,585
Whoo!

1344
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:35,692
I can't believe

1345
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,694
You just faked that.

1346
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:38,762
( Clears throat )

1347
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,363
I...

1348
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,099
I came a little.

1349
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,299
I've been on the other side

1350
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:46,036
Of that face before.

1351
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:46,937
What can I do to make you

1352
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:50,074
Feel more... Satisfied?

1353
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,420
Fuck me in the ass with this

1354
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,955
While I masturbate?

1355
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,960
And no, I-I'm not gay.

1356
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,399
Okay.

1357
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:18,568
Do you want us

1358
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,505
To go with you?

1359
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:22,772
No. I got this.

1360
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,776
Bye, mommy.

1361
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,344
I've been thinking a lot

1362
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,515
About you since that night.

1363
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:33,149
By the way, what...

1364
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,217
What happened to you?

1365
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,285
You're fat.

1366
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,388
I'm pregnant, retard.

1367
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,126
Congratulations. You're one

1368
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,528
Of the contenders.

1369
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:44,761
I'm gonna need a sample

1370
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:46,463
From you.

1371
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:48,465
Fuck me with your fingers

1372
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,867
While I jizz into it?

1373
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,710
* I wanna fight in the night

1374
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,079
* fight, run a red light

1375
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,480
* drink cyanide

1376
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,149
* get fucked tonight

1377
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:06,249
* I wanna get high

1378
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,284
* get a white line, drink wine

1379
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:09,019
* smoke, nice time

1380
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:11,087
* I wanna get wasted

1381
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,457
* I'll do what I want

1382
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:16,192
* I'll do it better

1383
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,062
* than you do...

1384
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:19,896
( Turns on shower )

1385
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,375
You know I'll take care

1386
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,276
Of the baby.

1387
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,083
I wish things were

1388
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,750
Different, too.

1389
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,553
It's okay. I wouldn't have

1390
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:44,453
Chosen me either.

1391
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,224
Let's just pretend

1392
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:48,758
We never met.

1393
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:49,959
Okay?

1394
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:54,463
That's the saddest thing

1395
00:58:54,463 --> 00:58:55,999
I've ever heard.

1396
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,367
Excuse me.

1397
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,540
Nikki: And I have a town

1398
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,109
Meeting on Friday, but I think

1399
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:06,744
It would be advantageous to meet

1400
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,045
With the business owners first,

1401
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,379
Get their points of interest,

1402
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,648
And then meet with the mayor.

1403
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:14,984
What do you think?

1404
00:59:18,623 --> 00:59:20,523
I can't marry you.

1405
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,929
I'm in love with another woman.

1406
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,701
I am so glad you said that.

1407
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,303
You've always been like

1408
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:36,305
A brother to me, and so sex

1409
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:38,609
Is a little icky, but...

1410
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:42,246
Who's gonna tell our parents?

1411
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,715
I'll tell 'em.

1412
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,285
I still haven't given up yet.

1413
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:51,255
Are you talking to

1414
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:53,022
Your stomach again?

1415
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:56,325
So, um...

1416
00:59:56,325 --> 00:59:57,594
What if none of them

1417
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,596
Are the father?

1418
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,799
One of them has to be.

1419
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:12,109
I meant to give you that

1420
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,844
Earlier.

1421
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,222
According to him, anyway.

1422
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:28,958
( Indistinct chatter )

1423
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,593
( Slurring ): Here's to the

1424
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:31,961
Best fuckin' people I ever

1425
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,164
Met in my life!

1426
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:35,199
Woman: I love you,

1427
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,034
You are my best friend.

1428
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,569
( Drunken chatter )

1429
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:41,938
What are you looking at?

1430
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,407
You're looking at my

1431
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:46,143
Best friend ever. I love you.

1432
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,779
I... Remember that.

1433
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:50,546
Really?

1434
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:51,782
Do you remember what

1435
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:53,918
Happened next?

1436
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,554
( Kissing, panting )

1437
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:03,427
Oh...

1438
01:01:05,629 --> 01:01:07,297
( Unzips zipper )

1439
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:08,264
God, I thought

1440
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:10,067
It was a dream.

1441
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:13,102
How was I?

1442
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:16,406
Ha ha ha ha!

1443
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,075
Uh...

1444
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:19,744
Let's just say I'm not

1445
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:21,278
Gonna switch teams

1446
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:23,547
Anytime soon.

1447
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:35,760
Blood would have been fine.

1448
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,032
How long is this gonna take?

1449
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,334
Well, I don't advise you

1450
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:45,970
Having a paternity test until

1451
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:48,137
After the baby is born.

1452
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,874
There's an increased risk of

1453
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,809
Miscarriage.

1454
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:53,277
Do you know what I had to go

1455
01:01:53,277 --> 01:01:54,912
Through to get these?

1456
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:56,847
It's safer for the baby

1457
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:57,915
This way.

1458
01:01:57,915 --> 01:01:58,749
Can't you just give me

1459
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:00,985
A hint? A little one?

1460
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:16,600
I'm so sorry.

1461
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:19,303
I wish I had told you

1462
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:21,704
Everything.

1463
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,308
I broke up with my fiancee.

1464
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,212
Angela...

1465
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:30,379
Would you do me the honor

1466
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,882
Of marrying me?

1467
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,251
No!!!

1468
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,253
Marry me!

1469
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,889
Angela, marry me!

1470
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,592
( Bottle clatters to floor )

1471
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:44,895
Your ex?

1472
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:46,964
Something like that.

1473
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:55,906
Angela!

1474
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:57,606
I want to do the right thing!

1475
01:02:57,606 --> 01:02:59,242
Will you marry...

1476
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:01,879
( vomiting )

1477
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,780
( Coughing )

1478
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,251
Oh, my God.

1479
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,087
Did you really break up

1480
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:12,555
With her?

1481
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,406
I hope that's a yes.

1482
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:31,976
That's a definite yes.

1483
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,911
This is the ring my father

1484
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:35,578
Gave my mother.

1485
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:39,215
So what do you say?

1486
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,852
No. No, you say no,

1487
01:03:41,852 --> 01:03:43,552
Angela, you say no...

1488
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:45,389
"No, I will not marry you.

1489
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:48,893
"I will not." You say no, okay?

1490
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:51,727
I...I love you.

1491
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:57,233
But first... Who's Nikki?

1492
01:03:58,402 --> 01:04:00,104
( Chuckles )

1493
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:02,571
Nikki is...

1494
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:03,507
She's practically

1495
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,342
A sister to me.

1496
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,977
We've both always known

1497
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:09,113
It wasn't right.

1498
01:04:09,113 --> 01:04:10,079
Our parents practically

1499
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,615
Set the whole thing up.

1500
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:17,386
I've never loved her.

1501
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,256
I love you.

1502
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,659
That's good enough for me.

1503
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:27,898
Wait.

1504
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:35,739
I have your ring, too.

1505
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:37,340
Give me your hand.

1506
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:39,576
I haven't had a chance

1507
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:40,877
To re-size it yet.

1508
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,612
It'll fit on your pinkie.

1509
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:49,386
Spit it out.

1510
01:04:50,955 --> 01:04:51,720
My parents are

1511
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,490
Really traditional.

1512
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,823
They'd want us to get married

1513
01:04:54,823 --> 01:04:56,692
Before we had the baby.

1514
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,528
No problem. Gabriel and I

1515
01:04:58,528 --> 01:04:59,795
Already planned the whole

1516
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:00,763
Thing out.

1517
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,566
How about next week?

1518
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:03,900
Yeah, right.

1519
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,169
I'm serious.

1520
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,471
Really?

1521
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,906
Uh-huh.

1522
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,140
Okay.

1523
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,809
Okay.

1524
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:16,746
Aaaah!

1525
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,316
Oh! I always knew

1526
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:20,917
You could do it!

1527
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,519
I'm gonna go tell Fred

1528
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:24,253
The good news.

1529
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,793
Are you in love with him?

1530
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:31,028
What do you think?

1531
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:32,761
You have no idea what

1532
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:34,830
You're getting yourself into.

1533
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,332
Everything's just starting to

1534
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:37,434
Come together the way it's

1535
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,268
Supposed to.

1536
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,438
Look, all relationships

1537
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:45,075
Are marathons, not a sprint.

1538
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:46,710
I'm a sprinter.

1539
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,212
All I'm asking is that

1540
01:05:48,212 --> 01:05:49,778
You slow it down...

1541
01:05:49,778 --> 01:05:51,414
For once.

1542
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,092
Mmm.

1543
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:06,862
Hello, tiny.

1544
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:08,098
Hello, mommy

1545
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:09,432
And future wife.

1546
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,834
Mmm.

1547
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:13,837
I told my parents

1548
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:15,772
The good news.

1549
01:06:15,772 --> 01:06:17,106
They invited you and your family

1550
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:19,809
Over for brunch.

1551
01:06:58,447 --> 01:06:59,848
Jefferson.

1552
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:01,685
Why don't you show our guests

1553
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:04,020
Around the house, huh?

1554
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:07,357
Jefferson.

1555
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,693
Angela, do you mind

1556
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,229
Keeping us company?

1557
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:25,275
Please watch your step.

1558
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:28,010
So, uh, welcome to

1559
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,914
Our humble abode.

1560
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:32,282
Jefferson...

1561
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:36,220
Look, a jacuzzi!

1562
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,190
You think we're making

1563
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,924
A mistake, I know.

1564
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:44,860
My parents think the same thing.

1565
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,163
It really doesn't matter

1566
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:48,698
What I think.

1567
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:50,334
You know, I was almost your age

1568
01:07:50,334 --> 01:07:52,435
When I married Angela's mother.

1569
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,703
I always wished that somebody

1570
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,106
Had sat me down and talked to me

1571
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:58,807
About the birds and the bees.

1572
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,846
Mr. Yang, with all due

1573
01:08:02,846 --> 01:08:05,249
Respect, Angela and I already

1574
01:08:05,249 --> 01:08:06,349
Know about the birds

1575
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:07,684
And the bees.

1576
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:09,419
Okay...

1577
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:12,656
Let's just talk bees, then.

1578
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:14,623
One bee.

1579
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:16,393
A bee is devoted to a single

1580
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:19,396
Queen its whole life.

1581
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:21,165
Its very existence depends on

1582
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:24,401
Keeping her alive.

1583
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:25,669
I don't plan on pollinating

1584
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:28,104
Any other flowers, sir.

1585
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:28,972
What I'm really trying

1586
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:30,974
To say is...

1587
01:08:30,974 --> 01:08:33,041
I want you...

1588
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:35,378
To love my daughter.

1589
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,715
Sir, I love Angela in

1590
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:41,885
More ways than she knows.

1591
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:45,354
Then welcome to the hive!

1592
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:48,090
Thank you.

1593
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,426
Jefferson never wanted to be

1594
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,861
A policeman or fireman like

1595
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:55,131
The other boys.

1596
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,134
He always wanted to be a mayor...

1597
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,803
Like his grandfather

1598
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,905
Back in Taiwan.

1599
01:09:01,905 --> 01:09:03,071
And when he found out that

1600
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:04,140
The president is higher than

1601
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,510
The mayor, he wanted to be

1602
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:07,611
President!

1603
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:10,613
Ha ha ha ha!

1604
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,281
I think he'd make

1605
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:12,915
A great chef.

1606
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,487
Ha ha ha ha!

1607
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,623
Jefferson can't cook! No!

1608
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,991
( Mother crying )

1609
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,360
Oh. Oh... oh, dear.

1610
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,495
Oh, no, no, dear, dear.

1611
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,996
Angela, she doesn't mean

1612
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:29,533
Anything by this.

1613
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:31,066
It's just that this all came

1614
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,635
As a shock to us.

1615
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:36,206
I think we will all feel better

1616
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:39,107
If you took a paternity test.

1617
01:09:39,107 --> 01:09:40,877
That way there'd be no question

1618
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:43,213
As to who the father is.

1619
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:44,913
Yes dear, yes dear.

1620
01:09:44,913 --> 01:09:47,049
Kleenex.

1621
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,453
It's all right. It's okay.

1622
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:53,223
( Music blares )

1623
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:57,193
This is gonna be

1624
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,594
Your father, tiny.

1625
01:09:58,594 --> 01:09:59,528
Try your best to look

1626
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,331
Like him, okay?

1627
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,135
Hey.

1628
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:08,272
I can't go through

1629
01:10:08,272 --> 01:10:09,473
With this.

1630
01:10:09,473 --> 01:10:10,407
Oh, I know, I know.

1631
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:13,309
I'm nervous too.

1632
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:14,877
I can't believe we found people

1633
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,013
Who would actually marry us.

1634
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:20,016
Can I get you anything else?

1635
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:21,751
It's your bachelor party.

1636
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:24,254
Go. Have some fun.

1637
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:26,256
Okay. All right, I'll check

1638
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:27,724
On you in a bit.

1639
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,526
Eee!

1640
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:30,960
Oh... oh!

1641
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,396
Oh!

1642
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:34,497
Big!

1643
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:44,039
What do you think it'll be

1644
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,174
Like when you two grow old?

1645
01:10:46,174 --> 01:10:49,612
Will you still be in love?

1646
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:52,180
Will you have sex?

1647
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,483
Will you bicker?

1648
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:57,287
We'll be wrinkled.

1649
01:10:57,287 --> 01:11:00,457
That's all I'm sure of.

1650
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:03,091
And that doesn't bother you?

1651
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:04,027
I'm pretty sure we'll be

1652
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:06,129
Wrinkled together.

1653
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:09,333
Knowing that, it's enough.

1654
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,901
And hopefully by then Gabriel's

1655
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:14,571
Too senile to fight and has his

1656
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:17,006
Hands on a lot of Viagra.

1657
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:20,344
( Knock on door )

1658
01:11:20,344 --> 01:11:22,646
You wanted to see me?

1659
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:25,213
I'll be back.

1660
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:26,149
Okay.

1661
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:31,388
I feel awful.

1662
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:32,688
Oh, well,

1663
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,958
You look beautiful.

1664
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,361
Thank you.

1665
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:39,127
You know, your mother and I

1666
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:40,529
Lived our entire lives as

1667
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:42,399
Strangers, only because we

1668
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:44,300
Couldn't trust each other

1669
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,035
Enough to tell the truth.

1670
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:48,071
But you both seemed

1671
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:49,171
So happy.

1672
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:50,840
Well, she was...

1673
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,174
She was good at pretending

1674
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,543
That everything was okay.

1675
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,513
But she was bitter and angry

1676
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:58,681
When... When she realized

1677
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:03,086
That her fantasy was not real.

1678
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:04,320
Your sister is about ten years

1679
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,657
Away from that realization.

1680
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,325
Please...

1681
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,426
Don't make the same mistakes

1682
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:13,095
We did.

1683
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,831
Be honest.

1684
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,032
You owe it to Jefferson,

1685
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,703
And you owe it to yourself.

1686
01:12:21,405 --> 01:12:22,538
Angela?

1687
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:24,374
It's time.

1688
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:10,486
Where are you parents?

1689
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,722
They couldn't make it.

1690
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:15,591
Man: Now, if the grooms will

1691
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:18,294
Please begin their vows.

1692
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:19,094
I want to marry you

1693
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,765
Because...

1694
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,700
I want to wake up in the morning

1695
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:27,637
And see your face next to mine.

1696
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,237
Because...

1697
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:31,207
I knew you were the one before

1698
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:33,910
I even met you.

1699
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:34,877
Because I want to grow old

1700
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,779
With you...

1701
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:40,749
And sit on a porch swing...

1702
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,318
And laugh about how foolish

1703
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,654
I sound right now.

1704
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,023
Well, what if when we grow

1705
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:50,392
Old we don't to share a porch

1706
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,962
Swing and laugh?

1707
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:56,032
I don't know.

1708
01:13:56,032 --> 01:13:58,366
Maybe, then, we can cry

1709
01:13:58,366 --> 01:14:00,669
Instead of laugh...

1710
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,170
About how it wasn't exactly

1711
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:04,440
How we thought it would be.

1712
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,842
And maybe after all those tears

1713
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,744
It will be the way we wanted

1714
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,480
It to be.

1715
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,949
Maybe.

1716
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,216
All I'm asking for is

1717
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:16,786
Complete and total honesty,

1718
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,255
No matter what.

1719
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,528
You promise?

1720
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:26,329
I do.

1721
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:30,098
( Applause )

1722
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,175
Wow.

1723
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:47,183
I, uh... ( Clears throat )

1724
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:48,652
I...

1725
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,655
I'm not followin' that!

1726
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:53,089
( Laughter )

1727
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:54,023
Um...

1728
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:57,160
I promise everything they said.

1729
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:00,428
You don't even know me.

1730
01:15:00,428 --> 01:15:02,364
How can you promise that?

1731
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:03,899
Uh...

1732
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,469
What are you talking about?

1733
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:08,604
There's a one-in-five chance

1734
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,373
You could be the father.

1735
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:12,008
I won't know until after

1736
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:15,043
Tiny's born.

1737
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:20,649
I'm not the father?

1738
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,318
I don't know right now.

1739
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:24,187
And I wouldn't blame you if you

1740
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:26,255
Turned around and walked away.

1741
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,128
I'm a slut.

1742
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:35,497
How's that fit into

1743
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:37,966
Your perfect life?

1744
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:40,203
( Crying softly )

1745
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:52,548
Angela!

1746
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,685
Angela!

1747
01:15:59,623 --> 01:16:01,356
So maybe you're not perfect.

1748
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,358
I know I'm not.

1749
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:04,560
All I've ever really been good

1750
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,362
At in my life is following

1751
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:08,264
Orders.

1752
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:10,634
I've just always been scared...

1753
01:16:10,634 --> 01:16:14,070
Scared of disappointing people.

1754
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:17,773
I choked under the pressure,

1755
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:20,175
And... The only reason I even

1756
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,543
Got into law school was because

1757
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:23,813
My dad had to buy me in.

1758
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:25,248
Don't you see?

1759
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:28,416
We're both perfectly imperfect.

1760
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:38,393
But I still can't marry you.

1761
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:39,629
I thought I wanted what

1762
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:41,463
You can offer me...

1763
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:42,497
The perfect family with

1764
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:45,433
The perfect life.

1765
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:49,071
But I don't want that anymore.

1766
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,976
I'm sorry.

1767
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:56,979
I need some time by myself.

1768
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:24,741
Lawrence: Those are valuable.

1769
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,148
For what it's worth, I think

1770
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,684
You're doing the right thing.

1771
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:41,089
So, um, does this mean you're

1772
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,358
Not looking for the sperm donor

1773
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:44,459
Anymore?

1774
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,463
We'll be okay.

1775
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:50,767
But I wanted to ask you two

1776
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:53,837
If you would be his fathers.

1777
01:17:58,573 --> 01:17:59,743
Can I name him?

1778
01:17:59,743 --> 01:18:00,608
No.

1779
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:01,543
No.

1780
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:02,911
(Knock on door )

1781
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:04,680
Sister: Angela! Angela!

1782
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,382
Oh, God.

1783
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:08,017
Angela, I can hear you!

1784
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,852
Open this door!

1785
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:13,189
Are you... are you crazy?

1786
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:15,524
What were you thinking?!

1787
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,794
This is my life, not yours.

1788
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:23,299
I'll do what I need to

1789
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:25,834
To take care of tiny.

1790
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:26,870
And as far as living your

1791
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:30,206
Life... You can have it.

1792
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,475
It's not me.

1793
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:52,594
* I like boys from Africa

1794
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,899
* South America and Asia

1795
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,400
* I like boys from...

1796
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,168
So, what do you think?

1797
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,137
These are really good.

1798
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:03,038
Why didn't you show me

1799
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:04,472
These earlier?

1800
01:19:04,472 --> 01:19:06,309
Oh, good. I was starting to

1801
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:07,376
Wonder if we were gonna be able

1802
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:09,645
To afford to raise this kid.

1803
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:11,614
So seriously, how much?

1804
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:12,748
Let's see what the buyers

1805
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:13,482
Think.

1806
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:14,917
Okay. 'Cause we just

1807
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,418
Want him to eat.

1808
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,654
( Rhythmic breathing )

1809
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:23,191
Shut up! You're disinvited

1810
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,828
From the birth.

1811
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:28,064
Fine. You're doing it wrong.

1812
01:19:29,697 --> 01:19:30,732
Go wait in the car.

1813
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,435
( TV on )

1814
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:35,805
Guys...

1815
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:37,040
I think I'm having a baby.

1816
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,739
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1817
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:38,706
We know, we know.

1818
01:19:38,706 --> 01:19:39,976
No, right now.

1819
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:41,143
Hmm?

1820
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,210
Yeah.

1821
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,312
Okay, we want to call

1822
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:44,447
Dr. Richards.

1823
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:47,483
We want to call your dad.

1824
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,217
We're going! We're gonna go

1825
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,685
Right now!

1826
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,358
She's gonna have a baby!

1827
01:19:55,358 --> 01:19:58,427
Oh, my God! Oh, my God...

1828
01:19:58,427 --> 01:19:59,462
Angela: I thought I'd spare

1829
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,096
You the icky details.

1830
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:03,967
After fourteen hours of labor,

1831
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:06,835
And an eternity of pushing...

1832
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:09,338
You were born.

1833
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:11,374
Before that point, I've never

1834
01:20:11,374 --> 01:20:12,641
Been sure of anything

1835
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,977
In my life.

1836
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:18,080
Now I'm sure of one thing...

1837
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,817
No matter who the father is...

1838
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,920
You're all mine.

1839
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:33,930
It's nice to finally meet you

1840
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,065
Face-to-face.

1841
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:37,833
I love you.

1842
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,035
Here are the results

1843
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:41,837
Of the paternity test.

1844
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:46,574
I knew it.

1845
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:55,650
Hi.

1846
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:00,856
He looks just like me.

1847
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,491
He looks nothing like you.

1848
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:03,725
No?

1849
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,995
No.

1850
01:21:05,995 --> 01:21:08,731
Come... Meet your new nephew

1851
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:11,634
Tupac.

1852
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:13,468
I'm just messing with you.

1853
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:15,271
Oh. Right.

1854
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:16,872
Hi, little mother.

1855
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,341
( Baby cooing )

1856
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:20,475
Hello, grandson.

1857
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:23,046
( Laughing )

1858
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:25,013
Gabriel: So, um...

1859
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:26,514
Did you ever find out

1860
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,216
Who the father was?

1861
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:29,552
Yep.

1862
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:34,156
Is it me?

1863
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:36,658
No.

1864
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:40,096
So who is it?

1865
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,431
It doesn't matter anymore.

1866
01:21:42,431 --> 01:21:44,266
How'd you figure it out?

1867
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:45,733
( Gabriel laughs )

1868
01:21:45,733 --> 01:21:48,071
You don't want to know.

1869
01:21:49,973 --> 01:21:51,440
I'm sorry, Carlton.

1870
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,943
He's not yours.

1871
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:02,817
**...

1872
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:17,599
He seemed like

1873
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,134
Such a nice guy.

1874
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:20,068
Oh, he'll be fine.

1875
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:21,537
He's got a huge...

1876
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:23,071
Gabriel.

1877
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:24,240
Huge.

1878
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,041
I didn't know that

1879
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:27,443
They came in that size.

1880
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,025
Here, let me hold him.

1881
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:43,191
No.

1882
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:44,460
Angela and I decided that

1883
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,728
You shouldn't hold the baby

1884
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:47,096
Anymore.

1885
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:49,431
I didn't mean to drop him.

1886
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,038
( Baby cooing )

1887
01:22:58,574 --> 01:22:59,707
Great, baby.

1888
01:22:59,707 --> 01:23:02,478
Thank you, dad.

1889
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,047
Thank you.

1890
01:23:04,047 --> 01:23:06,082
Congratulations.

1891
01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:07,583
Oh! I love you!

1892
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,352
Congratulations, Angela.

1893
01:23:09,352 --> 01:23:10,686
Thank you so much.

1894
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:12,355
Thank you.

1895
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:15,824
Hey.

1896
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,961
Hey.

1897
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:20,762
Glad you came.

1898
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:23,831
Well, um... Congratulations.

1899
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:26,268
I, um, well, I was surprised

1900
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:27,370
You invited me.

1901
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,936
I wanted to call you and i...

1902
01:23:28,936 --> 01:23:31,740
No, no. No.

1903
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,010
Let's start over.

1904
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,745
Jefferson Lee.

1905
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,147
Former politician

1906
01:23:38,147 --> 01:23:39,981
Turned struggling cook.

1907
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:42,250
Almost married twice...

1908
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,986
In love once.

1909
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:47,656
And you are?

1910
01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:49,625
Happy to see you.

1911
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:53,361
Angela: And then we all

1912
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,698
Lived happily ever after.

1913
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:57,066
Or that's what everyone

1914
01:23:57,066 --> 01:23:58,701
Wants to hear.

1915
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:01,002
Really, tiny, it doesn't matter

1916
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,738
Who I end up with.

1917
01:24:02,738 --> 01:24:04,240
The most important thing is

1918
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,209
That you do what you want,

1919
01:24:06,209 --> 01:24:07,442
No matter what other people

1920
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:08,877
Think.

1921
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,145
And I'll always support you

1922
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:11,880
No matter what.

1923
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,282
But you should do everything

1924
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:15,017
I say, all the time, at least

1925
01:24:15,017 --> 01:24:16,084
Until you're eighteen

1926
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,386
Or in college, and then you can

1927
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,122
Do whatever you want.

1928
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:21,290
God knows I did.

1929
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:24,093
But that's another story.

1930
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:28,330
