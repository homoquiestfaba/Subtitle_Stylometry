00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:04,504
♪

2
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,454
You know Michael and I 
are on an eternal quest

3
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,023
for many perfect things.

4
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,092
One of them is perfect 
corned beef hash in a diner.

5
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:29,429
We have found something about 
as close to perfect

6
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,997
as I've eaten 
in the last ten years,

7
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,866
not far from our house in 
Grafton, Connecticut

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,800
at the Laurel Diner.

9
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,436
I think there's something 
to be said about Zen

10
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,204
and the art of 
the perfect corned beef hash.

11
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,640
(laughing) 
Oh, there's a lot to be said.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,642
Because so many 
gourmet-style restaurants

13
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,310
screw up corned beef hash 
by adding

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,779
the most god-awful 
ingredients.

15
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,215
The Laurel Diner serves 
the classic workman-style

16
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,217
corned beef hash 
made from scratch.

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,920
And it's fantastic. 
In fact...

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,090
(woman narrating) 
That's us, 
Jane and Michael Stern.

19
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,126
You may know us from 
the magazine column we write

20
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,895
or from the books 
we've written together--

21
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:07,133
35 and counting-- or from 
our radio show, or from TV.

22
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,603
Everywhere we went, 
people would always say,

23
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,173
"God, I wish I had your life.

24
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,910
"You got a great job, 
a great-looking husband.

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,478
"You get to eat what you want.

26
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:22,115
"You get to travel 
to all these fabulous places.

27
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,050
You've got the perfect life."

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,018
And I did.

29
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,654
Would you like 
to sign the book? 
I would love to.

30
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,223
Kind of... but not exactly.

31
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,725
(woman on TV) 
And I let you in 
because, well,

32
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:36,062
housewives can get 
awfully bored sometimes.

33
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,864
(man on TV) 
You're too smooth, honey.

34
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,365
(phone ringing) 
You're much too smooth.

35
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,000
Of all the primates...

36
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,069
(Michael) 
Jane?

37
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,171
(parrot squawking)

38
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,539
Jane!

39
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,575
...wide variety of habitats...

40
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,512
(Jane) 
The fact was that I was having

41
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:56,316
a sort of midlife event.

42
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,418
That was the producer 
in Minneapolis on the phone.

43
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,453
We fly out there 
on the 10th,

44
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,754
in case you're interested.

45
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,223
And the flames quickly spread,

46
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,859
burning the entire house 
to the ground.

47
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,695
You know, the station's 
arranged a bus trip

48
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,297
for us with listeners 
to a little restaurant

49
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,832
that's about three hours 
into the country.

50
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,302
So, uh, what have 
you been doing?

51
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,204
Watching TV.

52
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,672
(parrot squawks) 
Oh, Jane!

53
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,475
(man on TV) 
Don't go away, 
we'll be taking your calls

54
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,612
as our canine fashion show 
continues.

55
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,114
Hm.

56
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,483
Well, I'm going to the barn.

57
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,419
(Jane narrating) 
Michael had been sober 
for a little over a year,

58
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,621
and now he had started spending

59
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,923
more and more time 
at AA meetings

60
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,993
or out at High Lonesome Stables 
with his horse.

61
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,995
I didn't have to take 
care of him anymore,

62
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,096
not the way I had.

63
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,232
After you ride, are you 
coming straight home?

64
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,368
I think.

65
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,569
Kirby, come.

66
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,471
Well, be careful.

67
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,907
If K.T. starts 
acting spooked...

68
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,110
Jane, I'll be okay.

69
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,778
(door closes)

70
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,882
(horse whinnies)

71
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,784
Easy! Whoa! Whoa!

72
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,688
Michael, wear a helmet!

73
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,060
What's that Jane girl 
up to today?

74
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,330
Sitting in front of the TV 
in her bathrobe.

75
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:18,898
She sick?

76
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,933
Not exactly.

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,569
More like impossible 
to be around right now.

78
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,774
You know, there's-- 
there's a saying in AA, Pete.

79
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,511
Spouses get better 
much slower than we do.

80
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,484
(Jane narrating) 
I knew Michael 
had reached a point

81
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,454
where he was frustrated 
with me and my phobias.

82
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,524
I've always had fears about 
just about everything.

83
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,358
You name it.

84
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,095
Now, fear was taking 
hold of my life

85
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,764
and I just couldn't 
do anything about it.

86
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,739
Jane?

87
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,840
Oh! 
Hi!

88
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,911
I haven't seen you in a while. 
What have you been up to?

89
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,414
Oh, work. Working. 
Some new projects.

90
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,749
Have you seen 
the display?

91
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,851
Well, make sure you do.

92
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,859
Ha-ha!

93
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,594
Working?

94
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,030
You're working on trying to get 
out of bed in the mornings.

95
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,632
Why don't you tell her that?

96
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,606
(man) 
Can I get a picture, please?

97
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,208
(overlapping chatter)

98
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,010
Welcome to Minneapolis!

99
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,679
Bye! 
We're really glad to be here!

100
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,647
Michael, I can't do this.

101
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,349
Jane, Jane. 
The idea of being trapped

102
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,551
with a group of strangers 
for three hours

103
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,387
on a bus going 
who knows where

104
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,187
driven by somebody 
I don't even know.

105
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,656
Hi. 
I mean, does he look like

106
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,591
the kind of bus driver 
that would stop the bus

107
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,292
if I asked him to? 
Jane.

108
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,561
These people paid 100 bucks 
apiece to meet us.

109
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,930
You think they'd 
let me drive the bus?

110
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,765
No.

111
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,703
You? 
No.

112
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,407
Jane, you said you might 
wanna ride in the car with me.

113
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,375
Yes!

114
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,376
It'll be okay.

115
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,913
I'll talk to all the listeners 
when we get to the restaurant.

116
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,686
Let's go.

117
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,622
(man on PA) 
This is the final boarding call

118
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,057
for Flight 387...

119
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,692
They loved the food.

120
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,594
Excuse me.

121
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,366
They loved the tote bags.

122
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,170
I don't know why 
we couldn't have eaten

123
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,871
someplace in Minneapolis.

124
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,640
They live in Minneapolis.

125
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,276
Well, there are plenty of 
great restaurants in town

126
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,877
we wouldn't have 
to take a bus to.

127
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,446
Well, the point 
for them was to go

128
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,414
on an adventure 
somewhere new.

129
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,616
I think that's stupid.

130
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,390
(Jane narrating) 
Some days I'd be 
so down in the dumps,

131
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,392
I could barely leave the house.

132
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,230
Michael told me about 
the sign that was always up

133
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,167
at his AA meetings-- 
"You are not alone."

134
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,236
But I was.

135
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,739
(groans, grunts)

136
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,842
(bell dings)

137
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,579
Being a writer was not like 
having a job-job.

138
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,148
It's a weird, 
unstructured life.

139
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:26,419
Stretches of time went by now 
when I saw no one but Michael.

140
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,222
It was hard to find the energy 
to get dressed.

141
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,092
Why get dressed? 
There was no pressing need to.

142
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,995
No pun intended.

143
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,904
Oh.

144
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,272
Oh, oh.

145
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,174
Jane?

146
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,942
Jane, what's the matter?

147
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,949
No... I'm okay.

148
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,592
(sighing)

149
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,496
Okay.

150
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,600
Oh, oh, oh!

151
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,672
(whimpering)

152
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,184
I don't know what's with me.

153
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,519
I got all panicky 
and couldn't do it,

154
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,353
I couldn't ride.

155
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,722
So, you got off 
and you walked.

156
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,757
It's no big deal.

157
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,426
Pete, you know me, 
I love to ride.

158
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,628
I've ridden since 
I was a little girl.

159
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,470
Michael's changed.

160
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,206
Every day, he gets up, 
works two hours,

161
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,207
goes to his meeting at 7:00.

162
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,309
Some days he goes 
to three meetings.

163
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:01,080
And then he comes out here, 
just to get away from me.

164
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,747
I know it.

165
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,451
Oh... I don't think 
that that's the case.

166
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,787
Has he said anything to you?

167
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,425
No, I guess he wouldn't.

168
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,760
Michael's still Michael.

169
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,762
Look, if you want, 
I'll go out there with you

170
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,030
on the trail next time.

171
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,634
I'll walk ahead of you 
and Piegan, I'll lead you.

172
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,503
You would, wouldn't you?

173
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,539
Well, I said I would.

174
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,387
(woman) 
I'm just thrilled to be 
working with you guys.

175
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,488
Us too.

176
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,258
You know, we really like 
the region by region idea

177
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,058
for the new edition.

178
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,294
Aren't you in Chicago 
next week?

179
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,729
Uh, yeah, we're gonna try 
that new steak place

180
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,530
that you mentioned.

181
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,833
You will love it! 
Oh, you'll love it.

182
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:54,834
Anyway, the book.

183
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,836
Yeah, it just seems 
to make more sense

184
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,870
to break it down that way

185
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,172
in case somebody's 
using it on a road trip,

186
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,841
you know, instead of 
state by state.

187
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,809
Mm, this meatloaf rocks.

188
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,112
So, how do you guys work?

189
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,715
Well, in the old days 
we'd sit down together.

190
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,884
Mm, in the old days, 
we did everything together.

191
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,853
But now, I pretty much 
do a draft,

192
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,855
and then Jane takes it 
and she does a draft,

193
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,891
and then we-- 
we look at it together.

194
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,893
Mm.

195
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,595
Because we'd like to have 
this for our spring list.

196
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,663
Shouldn't be a problem.

197
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,297
Shouldn't be.

198
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,337
Michael, where are you going?

199
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,872
I'm just gonna get 
something to drink.

200
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:33,839
Jane, please.

201
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,375
Please what? 
You just...

202
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,077
You're so needy.

203
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:38,978
I am not!

204
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,714
You know, you've become 
this anxiety-riddled recluse

205
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,883
because you don't have anybody 
to micromanage anymore.

206
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,451
Okay, let's just...

207
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,719
Can you get me 
a Danish or something?

208
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,654
You know, you've micromanaged 
me all these years,

209
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,056
you wanna know the truth. 
Would you stop it

210
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,991
with that word? 
I hate those words,

211
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,993
it's like "empower" 
or "proactive".

212
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,529
Jane, it sucks 
being the center

213
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,064
of somebody else's life.

214
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,968
I'll be right back.

215
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,873
(man) 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
the tower has just directed us

216
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:08,808
to a different runway.

217
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,578
Please remain seated 
with your seatbelts fastened.

218
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,913
We should be airborne shortly.

219
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,381
Are you okay?

220
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,249
Yeah...

221
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,452
as long as it's moving 
in the direction

222
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,020
it's supposed to be going.

223
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,757
(ding)

224
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,959
(man) 
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

225
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,829
it looks we're gonna be 
sitting here for a while.

226
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:34,734
The tower seems to be having 
some traffic control problems.

227
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,403
I'll let you know when 
we're cleared for takeoff.

228
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,006
(scoffs)

229
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,680
This thing is like 
an MRI machine with wings.

230
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,953
(breathing deeply)

231
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,491
Why isn't there 
an update from the pilot?

232
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,260
It's been, like, two hours.

233
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,166
(sighing) 
Oh, God.

234
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,769
(boy) 
Do you have any snacks?

235
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,371
Sorry, there's nothing 
to eat on this plane.

236
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,141
I need something 
to eat, man.

237
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,876
(boy) 
I don't know 
what we're gonna do.

238
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,844
Last time, he passed out.

239
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,055
It's an emergency.

240
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,962
Would you like this? 
It might help.

241
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,098
Thanks.

242
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,112
(boys chuckling)

243
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,480
You should've... 
No, seriously, seriously.

244
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,582
You should have seen 
your face, man.

245
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,750
Oh, man.

246
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,691
It looks like 
you saved the day.

247
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,226
I guess I did.

248
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,241
(Jane narrating) 
I couldn't stop thinking 
about the boy on the plane.

249
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,044
It made me look at everything 
I knew about myself

250
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,479
that I wanted to be different.

251
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,615
So, right then and there, 
I made a decision.

252
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,518
I decided to take 
control of my life.

253
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,452
You?

254
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,489
Lady, I don't think 
this is for you.

255
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,657
Oh, well, I sure would 
like to give it a try, yeah.

256
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,960
You're talking 
car accidents.

257
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,928
You have to be 
prepared to deal

258
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,298
with all sorts of 
unpleasant sights.

259
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,435
And I mean some pretty damn 
grisly ones.

260
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,937
Oh, oof, well, I-- 
I would imagine.

261
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,739
Death and disfigurement?

262
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,742
I mean, some of us end up 
heaving our guts out.

263
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:57,843
You can't help it.

264
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,844
Oh, I hate vomit.

265
00:12:58,844 --> 00:12:59,879
Loads of vomit.

266
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,647
I try-- I try 
never to vomit.

267
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,550
They'll vomit all over you, 
I guarantee you.

268
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,652
Cooped up in the back 
of an ambulance.

269
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:07,219
Cooped?

270
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,823
Racing down some bumpy road.

271
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:13,526
If you haven't 
kept in shape...

272
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,660
I understand.

273
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,531
Thanks, though, 
for your time.

274
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,401
(chuckles) 
Yeah, sure.

275
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,074
Hey. 
(car starting up)

276
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,455
(banging)

277
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,095
Oh.

278
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,699
Just trying to get 
a feel for it in here.

279
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,468
What it feels like 
for the horses.

280
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,304
You know, all cooped up?

281
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,273
Is this a writer's thing?

282
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,243
R-right. 
Research.

283
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,846
(horse whinnies in distance)

284
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,490
Piece of... cake.

285
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,934
Can I look inside 
the ambulance?

286
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,478
Do these doors open 
from the inside?

287
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,046
Yeah.

288
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,382
Oh.

289
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,951
What is it exactly that 
you're, uh, looking for?

290
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:46,886
Oh, nothing.

291
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,057
Really, I've just never been 
inside an ambulance before.

292
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,066
Huh.

293
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,503
(sighing)

294
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,779
Good.

295
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,416
I mean, you're not 
trapped in here...

296
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,920
with the sick 
vomiting person.

297
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,961
You know what?

298
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,198
I really wanna sign up 
for that class.

299
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,669
Brother.

300
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,475
Hey. 
Where were you?

301
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,812
The Grafton firehouse. 
Mm!

302
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,614
Guess what? 
What?

303
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,249
I'm gonna be an EMT.

304
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,116
(chuckling)

305
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,285
I'm not kidding, Michael!

306
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,021
Who said you were? 
What do you do as an EMT?

307
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,925
Well, you pull dying people 
from car wrecks,

308
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,994
stuff like that.

309
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,696
Jane, you're 52 years old,

310
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,497
you're not gonna be 
a fireman.

311
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,466
EMT. 
EMT.

312
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,070
You know, the other day, 
helping that kid on the plane,

313
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,305
that was one time in my life 
when I didn't feel

314
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,074
like the whole world 
was collapsing around me.

315
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,041
Yeah, but come on, Jane,

316
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,278
I mean, you're not 
gonna be an EMT.

317
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,781
Every twinge you get is like 
a brain tumor or MS.

318
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,682
Well... 
Or stroke.

319
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,618
Look at my family, I mean, 
every one of 'em, they...

320
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,154
they wouldn't fly, 
they wouldn't take boats,

321
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,489
they wouldn't talk on 
public telephones.

322
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,890
They wouldn't eat in restaurants

323
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,726
'cause they were afraid 
they would be poisoned.

324
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,027
I mean, I'm just like 'em.

325
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,198
My whole life, I've just been 
paralyzed by my fears.

326
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,400
Well, number one is admitting 
that you're powerless.

327
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,803
I know, I know. 
12 steps.

328
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,739
But this is not like that.

329
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,611
(sighs) 
I've done powerless.

330
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,715
Just doesn't cut it. 
Not anymore.

331
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,293
(microphone feedback) 
Don't loiter in the lobby!

332
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,065
Don't park in the spaces 
in the parking lot

333
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,334
reserved for police cars.

334
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,118
Okay, people! 
Listen up.

335
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,222
Let's get started.

336
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,526
Now, you will be volunteers.

337
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,997
Your training will be the same 
as the paid professionals.

338
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,198
(man whispering) 
I'd like to assist her.

339
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,467
You will know how 
to insert airways

340
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,803
to allow the patient 
to breathe.

341
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,938
You will assist paramedics.

342
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,607
You must insert needles 
into chest cavities.

343
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,843
If the patient's 
lungs collapse...

344
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,144
(whispering) 
Hi, I'm Jane.

345
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,579
Dot.

346
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,151
When the paramedic has to 
administer morphine,

347
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,720
you will spike the bag 
and set it up,

348
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,689
so that instead of 
a bone-jarring ride

349
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,557
to the hospital,

350
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,793
the patient will feel 
like they're a baby...

351
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,796
in its mother's arms.

352
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,837
As an EMT-B, you will 
be smack in the middle

353
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,272
of the emergency care 
hierarchy.

354
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,275
This is the most 
stressful job of all.

355
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,644
Know the warning signs 
of stress, people.

356
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:37,282
Anxiety, guilt, 
indecisiveness, insomnia.

357
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,784
I already have 
all of those.

358
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,953
How will I know when 
the job's getting to me?

359
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,588
(woman chuckle)

360
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,400
BSI-- Body Substance Isolation.

361
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,237
BSI, 
I'm number one!

362
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,073
(all) 
BSI, I'm number one!

363
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,574
You are an EMT.

364
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,245
You do not even think 
about touching a patient

365
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,947
without at least 
a barrier of rubber

366
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:09,982
between you and them.

367
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,983
I'm number one!

368
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,317
(all) 
I'm number one!

369
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,120
You are important 
to yourself

370
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,889
and to the rescue unit!

371
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,591
If you arrive 
on a scene and someone

372
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,828
is pointing a gun at you, 
the house is burning down,

373
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,330
toxic fumes are 
clouding the air,

374
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,600
or some psychotic is telling 
you the Martians

375
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,702
have ordered him 
to kill you now,

376
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:35,340
you do not 
attempt to be a hero.

377
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,177
You run for cover 
and get help.

378
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,814
That's what being 
number one is all about.

379
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,083
BSI! I'm number one!

380
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,253
(all) 
BSI! I'm number one!

381
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,588
Louder!

382
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,257
(all) 
BSI! I'm number one!

383
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,325
Louder!

384
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,461
(all) 
BSI! I'm number one!

385
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,277
(sighs)

386
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,481
Jane?

387
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,252
Are you all right?

388
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,055
Michael, this is it.

389
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,890
This is the other side 
of what happens

390
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,992
if you ever 
have to call 911.

391
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,061
I won't ever have to.

392
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,463
Yeah, but if you do.

393
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,832
Ed-- he's our teacher--

394
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,735
he's this professional EMT 
from over in Bridgeport.

395
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,737
You wouldn't believe 
some of the stuff he's seen.

396
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,639
And next time, 
he's gonna teach us

397
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,408
how to cut people's clothing 
off really fast

398
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,843
and look 'em over 
for bullet wounds

399
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,211
that have entered 
and exited.

400
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,313
Honey, are you 
gonna get undressed?

401
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,215
When there's an emergency, 
you gotta be able to jump

402
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,316
in your clothes 
and get out the door

403
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,318
in a split second, 
day or night.

404
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,553
Oh, boy.

405
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,288
(groans) 
Mwah!

406
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,856
This stuff is amazing!

407
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,626
Good, good, let's just-- 
let's go to sleep.

408
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:14,306
Scapula, maxilla-- 
I love these words.

409
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,576
"Cyanotic" means blue 
from lack of oxygen.

410
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,045
Huh, I didn't know that.

411
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,580
Oh, my God.

412
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,783
You have to look at this. 
I'll pass, thanks.

413
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,219
No, you-- you have 
to look at this.

414
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,488
His-- his...

415
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,923
The skin's been 
peeled off like a glove.

416
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,596
I can't do this.

417
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,699
Oh, they're probably just 
showing the worst case scenario.

418
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,338
Huh.

419
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,913
(Ed) 
Save it from choking.

420
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,319
(doll head popping)

421
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,491
You killed him.

422
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,545
Maybe mine's defective.

423
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,580
Mm-hmm.

424
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,856
(air pumping)

425
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,093
And go.

426
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,095
Oh!

427
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,063
Wait a minute. 
Lift!

428
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,431
Oh!

429
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,400
(women laughing)

430
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,241
(Jane) 
Lift, lift.

431
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,442
(gasps)

432
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,778
Stern?

433
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,680
You've killed him.

434
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,249
He had a heart attack 
and now...

435
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,651
he has fatal head trauma.

436
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:11,556
Stern?

437
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,791
Huh?

438
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,228
Rescue Randy is not 
a bean-bag chair.

439
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,764
(panting)

440
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,973
Michael, slow down!

441
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,175
This is a metal cage 
waiting to kill us

442
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,577
in a dozen ways 
I never even knew about.

443
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,713
Oh, great.

444
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,782
You can get trapped 
inside underwater,

445
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,618
seat belt could crush 
my intestines.

446
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,853
Oh, here we go. 
A little bit of knowledge

447
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,488
of something else 
to get nuts about.

448
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,957
You can hit your head 
on the dashboard,

449
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,826
send your brain bouncing 
around inside your skull.

450
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,496
You know, it's not 
just cars, Jane.

451
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,367
Dogs have big teeth and cause 
severe puncture wounds.

452
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,035
(Michael laughs) 
Oh, just shut up.

453
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,470
Bees can sting ya,

454
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,806
you can go into 
anaphylactic shock.

455
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,174
Stop!

456
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,417
I take this horse 
and I walk him around back,

457
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,985
and I stand there for a minute.

458
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:14,920
(chuckling)

459
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,755
And then I bring him out again.

460
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,323
Same horse? 
Oh, sure.

461
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,624
Same damn horse.

462
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,427
(laughter)

463
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,996
And he looks it up and down.

464
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,099
"How much?" 
I tell him 20,000.

465
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,069
And Joey starts 
peeling off the bills.

466
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,771
(laughter)

467
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,439
Ahh. I gotta go.

468
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,207
I'm gonna be late.

469
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,709
You go get 'em, 
ambulance girl.

470
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,545
(horse whinnying)

471
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,080
See you guys.

472
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,654
Hey, Pete, listen. 
I told Jane

473
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,122
that the next time we 
go out to Wyoming

474
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,891
or the Dakotas 
on a research trip,

475
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,459
I want you to come 
with us too.

476
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,294
Oh, I'd love to see 
that country.

477
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,497
Yeah. 
Yeah, just the two of us,

478
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,700
we'd, uh... we'd go out 
there for a couple days

479
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,970
and ride out 
and get lost.

480
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,473
You remind me to tell Jane 
about the mare in heat,

481
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,610
and my stallion 
going right at it

482
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,145
with me hanging on 
for dear life.

483
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,248
Yeah, that's her 
kind of story.

484
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,119
That Jane's a great girl.

485
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,593
(Ed) 
Listen up, people.

486
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,862
We need to walk 
through this together.

487
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,698
One out of 20 of you 
has a main artery

488
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,300
that is congenitally faulty,

489
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,636
and will at some time 
hemorrhage.

490
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,405
If you're lucky 
and it is found in time,

491
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,873
you will not die.

492
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,843
Stern, take your hand off 
your carotid artery.

493
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,078
You are stopping 
blood supply to the brain.

494
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,622
Ah... ah-ah.

495
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,358
O-o-ow! Ow! Ow! 
Stop it, you're hurting me.

496
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,560
Ah!

497
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,728
Machinery's not my strong suit.

498
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,697
Clearly.

499
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:21,947
Your... your blood pressure's 
very high.

500
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,024
It's true.

501
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,193
(woman on TV) 
"P" is for provocation--

502
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,128
what makes the condition 
better or worse.

503
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,230
I can't for the life of me 
remember how many liters

504
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,033
of oxygen are in 
an M-sized O2 tank.

505
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,902
That's important? 
Yes!

506
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,103
Sometimes I think 
I'm too stupid

507
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,706
for this class, 
and other times...

508
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,008
Some of the lectures 
are like,

509
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,377
"Do not try to replace 
someone's organs

510
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,379
if they are hanging 
from their body."

511
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,581
They say this 
with a straight face.

512
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,750
Who would do these things? 
(laughing)

513
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,285
What's that?

514
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:01,853
It's called "Pass EMT".

515
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,924
(man) 
If there is an impaled object 
in the neck, do not remove it.

516
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,026
I'm gonna watch it twice 
a day until it soaks in

517
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,961
and I pass my boards. 
Well, just be careful.

518
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,129
You're not exactly 
Lance Armstrong.

519
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,398
I have to start 
working out every day.

520
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,400
I'm gonna do this, Michael. 
I think it's good, Jane.

521
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,134
You do? 
Well, yeah.

522
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,603
You're doing your own thing, 
it's good to see.

523
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,139
(man on TV) 
Looking at the eyes, 
do they respond to light?

524
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,176
Are they equal? 
Do they move symmetrically?

525
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,712
Without moving his head, 
we'll have the patient

526
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,715
follow our index finger 
as we move it side to side

527
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:31,650
and up and down.

528
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,419
If eye movement 
is restricted...

529
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,088
On almost every call, 
you will be responsible

530
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,791
for lifting and moving patients 
without aggravating...

531
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,261
I may be more than twice 
his age, but I don't care.

532
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,964
...knowledgeable about proper 
methods of lifting and moving

533
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,565
to prevent injury to yourself.

534
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:51,069
So, flex at the knees, 
using your legs like this

535
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,370
to save your back.

536
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:01,046
Straight up. 
And right back down.

537
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,785
Well, who wants to help 
me out up here?

538
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,219
Uh...

539
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,324
(Ed) 
Spencer and I will now 
hoist the patient in the air

540
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,960
and place her in 
the stair chair.

541
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,764
How much 
do you weigh, Stern?

542
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,866
I never volunteer that.

543
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,940
(chuckles)

544
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,743
You're unconscious, Stern.

545
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,520
(sighs)

546
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,755
(tango music playing)

547
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,758
Hi. I'm Jane.

548
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,227
I'm an EMT.

549
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,163
Hi, Jane.

550
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,899
(tango music continues)

551
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,952
(radio chatter)

552
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,020
Do not touch anything.

553
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,922
Do not talk 
to the firemen.

554
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,291
Do not ask them questions.

555
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,728
I feel like a second grader 
going to a museum.

556
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:24,729
Stern!

557
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:25,930
Yes, sir!

558
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,737
Stair chair-- a folding chair 
used for carrying someone

559
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,406
in a sitting position 
down the stairs.

560
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,407
You be the patient.

561
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,516
(sighs) 
Come on.

562
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,850
Yeah.

563
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,386
Don't worry, 
I'm really strong.

564
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:53,525
On my count of three. 
One, two, three.

565
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,199
(Jane panting)

566
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,967
I have to stop.

567
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,838
Stern, maybe you should take

568
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:07,939
the foot part, 
it's a little lighter.

569
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,308
I don't do backward, 
even at home.

570
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,042
Stern!

571
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,249
(Ed) 
I'll tell you 
when to step off.

572
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,285
Lift. 
(straining)

573
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,586
Step.

574
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,888
Step, just don't 
let him hang in the air.

575
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:24,789
Uh...

576
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,124
(grunts)

577
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,426
Keep both hands on the chair 
or you will drop him.

578
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,930
(grunting)

579
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,898
(people groaning)

580
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,700
(man) 
Oh, that hurt.

581
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,702
Fail.

582
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,137
Stern? 
Huh?

583
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,340
See me after class.

584
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,976
(panting)

585
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,892
Can't call 911. 
You're all here.

586
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,594
(laughs)

587
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,197
I couldn't even walk 
down a flight of stairs

588
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,365
without holding on.

589
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,700
I'd trust you 
to carry me.

590
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,368
Well, you'd really 
have to be out of it.

591
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,837
Besides, that's what the cops 
and firemen are there for,

592
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,405
to help you lift people.

593
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,176
Ooh, big hunky men 
at my command?

594
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,844
Now, I feel better.

595
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,646
(both chuckle, 
cat meows)

596
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,115
You're sure you don't mind 
if I use you as a guinea pig?

597
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,951
I love playing 
doctor with you.

598
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,520
(both chuckle, 
horse whinnying)

599
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,957
Normal.

600
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,936
(cat meows)

601
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,804
That's a gorgeous saddle.

602
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,806
There's nothing 
you can't do.

603
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,976
Michael and I wish 
you had been our father.

604
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,012
That would've made you 
some kind of perverts.

605
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,413
(chuckles) 
Okay, then.

606
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,415
You can be Michael's father.

607
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,985
My father... my father had 
a steel plate in his skull.

608
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,553
Did I ever tell you that? 
No.

609
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,689
He... he'd just 
go off, you know,

610
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,458
on these uncontrollable rages. 
It was something about him

611
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,694
playing on the trolley tracks 
when he was a kid.

612
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,696
His forehead caved in 
and then came out again

613
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,032
kinda weird I guess 
where the plate was.

614
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,100
I used to have 
these nightmares

615
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,571
about Frankenstein's 
monster chasing me.

616
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,473
When I was eight, 
my mother packed me up

617
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,209
and ran away with me while 
he was out walking our dog.

618
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,378
She studied to be 
a concert pianist,

619
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,213
and when we finally 
found a place,

620
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,848
the only thing she brought 
was her grand piano.

621
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,052
So, we ate our meals on top 
and then we slept underneath.

622
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,754
That's a vision. 
Yeah.

623
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,424
Well, he never 
forgave her for leaving.

624
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,029
He threatened 
to kill us both.

625
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,333
I was-- I was afraid 
to leave the house.

626
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:52,704
(clears throat) 
When was this?

627
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,038
How long ago?

628
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,108
Well, it was when I...

629
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,310
it was a long time ago.

630
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,678
Yeah. 
Long time ago.

631
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,823
Let me see if I can find 
my old binoculars

632
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,725
so I can see back that far.

633
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,536
Suppose I should wait 
until I even pass my boards.

634
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,106
Of course, I'm gonna 
pass my boards.

635
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,508
They have all these 
cool websites

636
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,977
where you can order 
this EMT stuff.

637
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,712
(glass breaking) 
Oh! Damn it!

638
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,449
Apply pressure! 
I'll call 911.

639
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,486
No, you won't. 
It's not that bad.

640
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,688
What are you so happy about? 
I'm not!

641
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,324
Well, you don't exactly 
inspire confidence.

642
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,428
Apply more pressure! 
Yeah, I got it.

643
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,763
Do you want me to do that? 
No.

644
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,631
Here. 
No-- Jane.

645
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,566
Jane, please, stop.

646
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,201
Elevate it. 
Look, easy.

647
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,269
I'm not exactly 
Rescue Randy.

648
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,872
I know, Rescue Randy 
lets me help him.

649
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,808
Please.

650
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,878
Oh... ooh, I think 
you should go to the ER.

651
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,845
Let me drive you.

652
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,014
No, I'm gonna go out 
to see K.T.

653
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,783
What?

654
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,217
Keep applying pressure!

655
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,153
(Michael) 
Heel.

656
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:18,156
Michael, at least let me 
take a look at it!

657
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,891
No, this EMT stuff 
is making you

658
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,692
even more of a control freak!

659
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,228
Kirby, up!

660
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,333
(car starting up)

661
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,205
(horses whinnying)

662
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,321
Hey.

663
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,490
You should get some 
stitches in that, boy.

664
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,592
You need to get 
to a doctor.

665
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,827
What...

666
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,972
What?

667
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,741
(woman on PA) 
Dr. Leeds, please report 
to Physical Therapy.

668
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,710
Oh... 
(winces)

669
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,046
Ooh! 
Shh.

670
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,881
Oof! 
(whimpering)

671
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,584
Jane, why don't you 
just go wait outside?

672
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,520
Oh... 
Just go wait outside.

673
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,088
Okay. 
You gonna be okay?

674
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,690
I'll be fine. 
Okay.

675
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,392
(exhales sharply)

676
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:31,129
(breathing deeply)

677
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,407
(Jane narrating) 
Sometimes life 
is a waiting game.

678
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,044
Now, all I had to do 
was pass my boards.

679
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:50,014
I'd have to wait 
six long, agonizing weeks

680
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,316
until the National Registry 
of EMTs

681
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,819
gave me a thumbs up or down.

682
00:35:54,819 --> 00:36:00,124
Those weeks crawled by, 
and then one day, I heard.

683
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,094
Oh, my gosh.

684
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,762
Oh, God.

685
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,936
"Congratulations!" 
I got it!

686
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,339
Michael? 
Hey.

687
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,242
I passed! 
Michael!

688
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,044
Way to go, Jane!

689
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,079
I passed the National Board!

690
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,515
I more than passed, 
I did exceptionally well.

691
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,619
Look! 
My EMT certification.

692
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,453
And my wallet cards and...

693
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:33,357
Look, patches 
I can sew on.

694
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,694
Aw, I'm-- I'm proud 
of you, honey.

695
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,429
(sighing)

696
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,466
Wow.

or burgers, ladies?

873
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,025
Donuts? 
Donuts.

874
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,528
How scary can this be if you 
get to have donuts afterwards?

875
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:12,396
(laughing)

876
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,699
These guys! 
I love them.

877
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:18,902
It's like their favorite 
things to do are smoke, drink.

878
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,270
Eat pizza. 
Curse.

879
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,638
Put out fires. 
What else is there?

880
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,006
What else is there?

881
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,409
(laughs) 
And they have no idea

882
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:26,844
what I do in my other life.

883
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,113
Yeah, they do, 
in a vague sort of way.

884
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,582
But they don't care!

885
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,150
(both laugh)

886
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,386
I never used to pay attention 
to the Milnik brothers.

887
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,155
They were always 
just mechanics.

888
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,123
Filled my gas tank, 
took my credit card.

889
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,793
Well, on a one-to-ten scale 
of gregarious,

890
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,328
they're about a two.

891
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,730
But they're the best.

892
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,999
(sighs)

893
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,703
It's so soothing here.

894
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,239
(laughs loudly)

895
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,307
What?

896
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,176
(Jane) 
I did it.

897
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:03,146
I was able to sit in the back 
of an ambulance and not freak.

898
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,649
That's great. 
It was really good.

899
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,585
'Cause his leg was, like, 
snapped like a chicken leg,

900
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,753
and twisted. 
I got it.

901
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,422
But I was so busy with what 
I was supposed to do,

902
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,958
I-- I didn't have time 
to utz about my own stuff.

903
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,194
Well, I stopped by 
the vet's today

904
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,629
to pick up Kirby's pills.

905
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,530
Oh.

906
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,666
Jim Maguire says 
the Milnik brothers like you.

907
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,735
They do?

908
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,671
God, Vince Milnik. 
He's incredible.

909
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,340
You should've seen the way 
he got the area secured,

910
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,175
the two of 'em 
off to the hospital.

911
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,444
Guess I'm not 
your type anymore, huh?

912
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:36,280
Oh, silly!

913
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,149
The book.

914
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,518
Remember our book 
"Roadfood"?

915
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:46,323
Great. Great.

916
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,295
They like me?

917
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,065
When it comes to fried chicken,

918
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,834
which might be the universal 
all-American food,

919
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:01,538
Stroud's Restaurant in 
Kansas City, Missouri is truly

920
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:02,506
head and shoulders 
above the rest.

921
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,840
Here's why it's great.

922
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,110
Basically, you can't screw up 
fried chicken that much.

923
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,680
I mean, even the worst 
fast food fried chicken,

924
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,815
I can eat a bucketful of, 
no problem.

925
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:15,018
However, what makes Stroud's 
fried chicken perfect

926
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:15,919
is that the crust is...

927
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,054
(air hissing, 
Jane gasps)

928
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:20,991
Don't worry. 
You can't hurt him now.

929
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,568
(Michael) 
See, this is my idea 
of chicken heaven.

930
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,640
It started as an old roadhouse 
dating back to the 1930s.

931
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,209
Helen Stroud started it 
as a fireworks stand.

932
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,611
Then she decided 
the fireworks business

933
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,381
isn't so good, "I'm gonna 
start frying chicken."

934
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:47,284
(Jane) 
God bless her. 
God bless her, she did.

935
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,720
And since the '30s, 
Stroud's has been known

936
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,389
as the 
fried chicken place 
in Kansas City,

937
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,692
which is a very serious 
fried chicken town in general.

938
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,862
(sirens blaring)

939
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:02,599
(men shouting)

940
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,851
Have a look at Blanche 
and Bill's Pancake House.

941
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,587
I made a couple of changes 
in that one too.

942
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,555
(walkie chiming)

943
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,457
(woman) 
Grafton ambulance personnel,

944
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:31,228
crisis intervention, 
2946 Ridgefield Avenue.

945
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,629
Please respond.

946
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,967
G-65, G-65 responding.

947
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

948
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,003
What are-- 
whoa, Jane, Jane.

949
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:41,505
What are-- what are you doing?

950
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,373
I'll be right back. 
We'll finish.

951
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,043
We have a deadline, we got-- 
we got a trip coming up.

952
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,011
You resent this, don't you?

953
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:49,479
Oh, okay. 
No, you do.

954
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,715
The intrusion of other 
people's emergencies.

955
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,651
Well, yeah... when we sort of 
have one of our own, right.

956
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,254
This isn't just about 
you anymore, Michael.

957
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,288
Thank God.

958
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,992
No, it's about our work, 
which is us,

959
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,094
which you aren't 
doing anymore,

960
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,229
because being an EMT is...

961
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,131
I mean, how can saving lives 
even begin to compare

962
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,699
with writing about chili?

963
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,936
Go ahead. 
Go ahead, Jane.

964
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,805
Go be a hero.

965
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,840
This is so idiotic.

966
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,543
What are you 
even talking about?

967
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,779
I can't even tell what 
you're talking about!

968
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,782
I know you can't.

969
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,785
(Jane groans) 
God!

970
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:29,920
(parrot) 
Oh, Jane!

971
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,822
(tweets)

972
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,498
(Jane narrating) 
In the beginning, 
when the radio tone

973
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,633
would go off, 
I'd get terrified

974
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:48,405
before I'd pull it together 
and say, "I'm okay, it's okay,"

975
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,540
because you never know 
what horrors you'll find

976
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,309
behind those strange doors.

977
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:56,279
This time, 
it was my own guest room.

978
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:04,121
Michael?

979
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,492
Think I'm coming down 
with something.

980
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,464
Well, I'll keep 
the radio on low.

981
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,300
No, I just need to...

982
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,302
I just need 
a good night's sleep.

983
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:24,107
I'll be okay.

984
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,510
(Michael sighs)

985
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:34,184
♪

986
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,207
(whimpers lightly)

987
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,558
Are you feeling any better?

988
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,793
Yeah.

989
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,562
I'm gonna go 
to my meeting.

990
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,231
See you around noon.

991
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,903
(door opens and closes)

992
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,584
(parrot) 
Oh, Jane.

993
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,538
(horse neighing)

994
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,876
Has Michael been here?

995
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,512
He came and he went. 
You missed him.

996
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:14,784
You two haven't been 
around here much lately.

997
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,753
Not together.

998
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,122
Whoa!

999
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:22,292
I haven't been able to keep 
much of a schedule these days.

1000
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,899
Yeah, horses need that.

1001
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,269
Yeah, people too.

1002
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:36,439
Well, everybody's different. 
They need different things.

1003
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,577
Sometimes, they just 
don't know it.

1004
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,981
Seems like you lucked out.

1005
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,685
(chuckles) 
Yeah.

1006
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,388
I always dreamed 
of having a big family.

1007
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,323
Now, I feel like I do.

1008
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:57,794
Whole firehouse 
full of 'em.

1009
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,467
Vince, hey!

1010
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,835
There's Vince and Rosemary. 
Hi.

1011
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,337
Jules, this was 
pretty terrific.

1012
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,238
I'm glad I saw you.

1013
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,040
Grant and Audrey 
say they'll take care

1014
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,909
of the photocopying for 
the training session on Monday

1015
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,277
if we buy the pizza.

1016
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,379
Sounds good to me.

1017
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,448
Jane. 
Hm?

1018
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,419
The fish stew was perfection, 
I loved it.

1019
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,586
Oh... 
She really did like it.

1020
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,155
I mean, the mussels 
and the clams

1021
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:26,523
and the shrimp 
and the scallops,

1022
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,825
I mean, there was, like, 
every kind of fish in there.

1023
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,161
It was absolutely amazing. 
And the stock!

1024
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,829
It's an old family recipe.

1025
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:36,066
Its secret... at the end, 
a stir of brandy.

1026
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,200
Brandy? 
Ah.

1027
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,070
I am in the restaurant 
business all my life,

1028
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,873
and I believe our fish stew 
beats any fish stew anywhere.

1029
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:45,542
Great with French bread 
there, Jules.

1030
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,143
Michael's a big dunker.

1031
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,845
(chuckles) 
Thanks.

1032
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,613
Merci.

1033
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:53,350
(ship horn blowing)

1034
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,652
Great place, huh?

1035
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,620
I'd like to stop 
at that firehouse

1036
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,222
we passed coming into town.

1037
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:01,658
Why, do you know them? 
No.

1038
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,894
I just wanna get 
a picture out front.

1039
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,130
Wherever we travel to 
across the country,

1040
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,532
you always have to 
check out all the AA meetings.

1041
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,167
That's different. 
Yeah?

1042
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,403
How? 
Look, we have some revisions

1043
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:14,504
we have to make 
this afternoon.

1044
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:17,340
Jane, we're seeing Sarah 
in New York on Thursday.

1045
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,308
We need to reschedule that.

1046
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,276
She thinks 
she's getting the book.

1047
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:21,811
You-- you've been working 
on it, haven't you?

1048
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,413
It's gonna be ready, isn't it? 
I hope.

1049
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,715
Wait, wait, wait. 
Jane, look.

1050
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,916
Why don't you just 
give me what you've done

1051
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,017
and I'll finish the rest?

1052
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,053
No! 
I'm doing all the work anyway

1053
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,921
while you're out 
on the fire truck.

1054
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,590
That's not exactly fair.

1055
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:34,758
You bet it isn't.

1056
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,161
I can do this, Jane. 
Let me just do this,

1057
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,230
and let's just stop 
all this pretending.

1058
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,564
You pompous...

1059
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,233
I don't need you anymore.

1060
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,602
Not like this.

1061
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,271
It's like pulling teeth 
to get you to pay attention.

1062
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:51,074
Oh, get over yourself. 
You are so full of yourself.

1063
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,509
Oh, I... where do you 
think you're going?

1064
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,245
I'm not getting 
in the car with you. 
Oh, come on, come on, Jane.

1065
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,679
Poor Michael.

1066
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,048
All these years 
I've been on your back.

1067
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,950
(scoffs) 
Nothing but this 
huge neurotic weight

1068
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,253
around your neck. 
No, no, not all these years.

1069
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,487
Just since I've been sober.

1070
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,657
And now that I'm not, 
you can't handle it.

1071
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,326
Now you know 
what it feels like.

1072
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,761
This is about 
getting back at me?

1073
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:15,732
You can't handle that I don't 
need you like that anymore.

1074
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,734
No! What I can't handle 
is the fact

1075
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,202
that I've lost 
my partner,

1076
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,604
and not just 
my writing partner.

1077
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,909
You're right, 
I can't handle that.

1078
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,992
(walkie chiming)

1079
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,661
(woman) 
Grafton ambulance personnel,

1080
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,763
woman needs transport 
to hospital,

1081
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,498
number six, 
Gordon Road.

1082
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,533
(parrot) 
Oh, Jane!

1083
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:56,639
The AIDS hospice. 
I have to go.

1084
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,879
Yeah, I guess you do.

1085
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,750
(doorbell ringing)

1086
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,620
She had a seizure?

1087
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,595
You don't need that, 
nobody here is gonna hurt you.

1088
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,998
Well, it's for the protection 
of the patients as well as us.

1089
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,967
Whatever.

1090
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:28,471
AIDS, TB, thrush, hepatitis.

1091
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,106
Brain surgery?

1092
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,044
She should be dead 
ten times over.

1093
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,779
Up here.

1094
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:47,123
(Jane) 
Mavis, Mavis Cotter, 33.

1095
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,791
(chuckles)

1096
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:54,564
It's just, uh... 
they put hobbies on here.

1097
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,602
(sighs) 
Sewing, gospel singing.

1098
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,810
I really like Shirley Caesar.

1099
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,282
I like her too.

1100
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:18,087
My husband, he likes 
the Clark Sisters.

1101
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:26,729
His name is Michael. 
We're writers.

1102
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,966
Both of you are?

1103
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:33,002
We write together, yeah.

1104
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:35,872
What about? 
Food.

1105
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,507
We've always loved food.

1106
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:43,746
Discussing it is like 
this primal thing with us.

1107
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,982
He's the smartest man 
I've ever met.

1108
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,852
I'm very fortunate.

1109
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,527
One of my top-ten wishes 
would be to sing

1110
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,995
like Mahalia Jackson.

1111
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,199
(chuckles, coughs)

1112
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,006
(singing)

(door opens)

1126
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:39,896
You were up late.

1127
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:43,032
I, uh, left the sections 
I finished on your desk.

1128
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,402
I'll wrap up the Great Plains 
this afternoon.

1129
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,438
They called from Nicky Rivers.

1130
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,307
They want us in Chicago 
on the Fifth for the taping.

1131
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,150
What?

1132
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,752
So, what's the deal?

1133
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,455
Are you staying in there?

1134
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,325
Uh... for now.

1135
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:15,898
I really think 
we should see someone...

1136
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:19,102
talk to somebody professional.

1137
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,772
Michael.

1138
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,240
This is important.

1139
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:30,480
I think we should too.

1140
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,388
Here, sweet boy.

1141
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,158
You want a little something? 
There you go.

1142
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,299
(walkie chimes)

1143
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,601
(woman) 
Grafton ambulance personnel,

1144
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:54,604
baby floating face-down 
in swimming pool,

1145
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,672
145 Columbia Heights.

1146
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,442
G-65, G-65 responding.

1147
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,844
Baby floating 
in swimming pool.

1148
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,746
(parrot) 
Oh, Jane.

1149
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:06,015
(man) 
It's terrible.

1150
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,487
(splashing)

1151
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,823
My baby.

1152
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,325
What the hell? 
A dog?

1153
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,426
Please save him!

1154
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:20,396
Called 911, said his baby 
fell in the pool.

1155
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:22,665
This mutt weighs a ton.

1156
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,333
When we got here, 
he was floundering around.

1157
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,735
He probably had a heart attack.

1158
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,670
I don't know what 
we're supposed to do with it.

1159
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,438
We're not gonna put him 
in the ambulance.

1160
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,741
Jane, come on, 
we called the animal warden.

1161
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,310
(Jane grunts) 
Aah!

1162
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:40,183
(laughs) 
You okay?

1163
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:43,052
Winston!

1164
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,999
What's wrong 
with the doggy?

1165
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,901
He's asleep. 
He's dead.

1166
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,011
Oh, my God.

1167
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,279
Oh, my God.

1168
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:11,681
Jane, what are you doing?

1169
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,115
He's alive.

1170
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,787
He's alive.

1171
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:19,155
He's alive!

1172
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,456
(man) 
My baby!

1173
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:21,824
Winston!

1174
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:24,360
(dog panting)

1175
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:32,401
(man) 
Oh, no, it's Rhonda 
from animal control.

1176
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:33,870
False alarm.

1177
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,415
You sure you don't want 
to put something else on?

1178
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,252
No, I'm fine. 
It's drying.

1179
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,420
Quite an episode.

1180
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:55,324
Yeah, there have been many. 
Jane saves lives.

1181
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,927
My own.

1182
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,897
I saved my own life 
when I became an EMT.

1183
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,633
Michael's angry because 
I don't need him

1184
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,101
to prop me up anymore.

1185
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:06,936
(woman) 
Is that right, Michael?

1186
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,072
Well, I don't really 
have this need to have

1187
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,874
someone to take care of, 
I never have,

1188
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,109
if that's where 
you're headed.

1189
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,443
Where are you headed?

1190
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:18,681
He doesn't need me anymore. 
He thinks I don't need him.

1191
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,683
That's not exactly 
how I'd put it.

1192
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,319
Don't you begin 
to hate the person

1193
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,988
that you cling to the most, 
isn't that true?

1194
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,223
Go to hell!

1195
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,258
You go to hell!

1196
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,661
I hate you so much.

1197
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,036
(sighs)

1198
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,338
You know something?

1199
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:46,275
You would never talk 
to Vince Milnik like that.

1200
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,210
You'd treat him with respect.

1201
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:52,748
And just because we're married, 
it doesn't give us license

1202
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,450
to muck all over 
each other.

1203
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:07,730
I first saw Michael 
when we were in college.

1204
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,800
I said, "Are you a Scorpio?"

1205
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,002
I knew he was 
a Scorpio too.

1206
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,873
We were born one day apart.

1207
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,076
We went to Kenosha, 
Wisconsin once

1208
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,945
and had matching Scorpios 
tattooed on our legs

1209
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:25,281
by these Hells Angels guys.

1210
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,018
We've been incredibly close.

1211
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,753
(Jane) 
Married 33 years.

1212
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,388
We're acting like we don't 
know each other.

1213
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,623
Incredibly close.

1214
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,258
Ever since we started 
writing together,

1215
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,861
we've always been a foot away 
from each other in the car,

1216
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:40,496
we have a double byline.

1217
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:42,832
That constant...

1218
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,266
Michael.

1219
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,637
We don't have any kids,

1220
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:53,109
and uh... we just have 
each other, and the animals.

1221
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:58,247
And the work... 
and I love that.

1222
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:01,650
I love it too.

1223
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,754
But I don't love it now.

1224
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:12,261
I don't love it now.

1225
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,571
I got an extra room here.

1226
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:26,108
(sighs)

1227
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,544
I'm just saying, 
in a pinch.

1228
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,915
For either of you.

1229
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:36,419
Yeah. 
Thanks, Pete.

1230
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,021
Just might take 
you up on that.

1231
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,489
(horse neighing)

1232
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,224
I don't know, Pete.

1233
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:47,496
I try to be...

1234
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:51,967
you know, encouraging about 
all this EMT stuff.

1235
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,637
I just keep coming off 
looking like the bad guy.

1236
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,606
If I was you, I'd be 
into the scotch by now.

1237
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:57,873
(Michael laughs)

1238
01:07:58,607 --> 01:07:59,742
Yeah, well, that's just it.

1239
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:02,178
It was good 
for all those years.

1240
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,881
It was good for her too 'cause 
she knew exactly where I was--

1241
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,951
passed out in the chair.

1242
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,920
But then, I got sober,

1243
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,156
and I wasn't 
in the chair anymore.

1244
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:19,428
I wake up every morning, 
I wonder where I've been

1245
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,263
for the last 30 years.

1246
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,616
Jane? 
Huh?

1247
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,817
Let me.

1248
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:42,751
(man) 
Got enough room?

1249
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,290
(man) 
Yeah, I got it.

1250
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:58,067
You're gonna be fine.

1251
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:58,868
Take it easy.

1252
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:03,272
That's it, 
you'll be fine.

1253
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,674
Here we go, 
you'll be fine. 
You're all right.

1254
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:07,176
(man) 
Yeah, we're gonna 
get you to the hospital.

1255
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,211
Sir, I'm just gonna 
buckle you in here, okay?

1256
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:11,180
Okay.

1257
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,422
(phone ringing)

1258
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,227
Hello?

1259
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,496
Jane, it's Audrey.

1260
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:30,232
You seemed a little 
out of it.

1261
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:34,570
I'm sorry, I just had 
to come home and lie down.

1262
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,906
I was feeling 
a little w-weird.

1263
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,874
Jane, are you okay?

1264
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,678
No.

1265
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:46,715
Careful... 
'cause I will burn you.

1266
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:49,585
I know a good EMT.

1267
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,358
I cry all the time.

1268
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,966
In the car, 
Michael drives and I cry.

1269
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:09,071
I cry every time I see 
couples our age together.

1270
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:14,376
Every restaurant we go into, 
every motel room...

1271
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:16,579
I'm crying.

1272
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,282
Every couple 
goes through this.

1273
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,418
I mean, you stay together 
this long...

1274
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,520
Yeah, yeah, 
I know all that.

1275
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,855
I've seen those movies too.

1276
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,626
It's just that 
Michael and I...

1277
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:36,265
I love him, and he says 
he loves me too.

1278
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,503
We just don't like each other.

1279
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:48,744
God, I hope this is nerves 
and not Parkinson's.

1280
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,557
(applause)

1281
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,530
And we're back with Jane 
and Michael Stern.

1282
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:11,333
Okay, Jane, Michael, tell me, 
do you ever have time

1283
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,935
to just stay home and cook?

1284
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,237
Yeah, people think we live 
out of doggy bags,

1285
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:18,240
but when we're not on the road, 
we're very passionate cooks,

1286
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,875
and we're passionate 
about kitchenware as well.

1287
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:23,045
Oh, are there pieces 
you just can't live without?

1288
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:25,247
Well, my favorite thing 
I have to have

1289
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:27,049
is a really good 
cheese grater.

1290
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,917
Okay, tell me, 
what kind do you like?

1291
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,719
Well, Jane and I actually 
have a battle royal

1292
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,788
going on about cheese graters, 
we each have our own.

1293
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,490
Yeah, Michael hides 
his cheese grater.

1294
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:35,924
That's because you don't 
clean yours properly.

1295
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:36,358
Really?

1296
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,927
Jane prefers 
the boxy type.

1297
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,729
(laughter) 
I'm so humiliated!

1298
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:43,165
I have this great 
fabulous flat one.

1299
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,567
It's old, I love it, I know 
exactly how to hold the cheese.

1300
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:46,268
Yeah, Michael is anal retentive.

1301
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:48,404
He hides 
his cheese grater.

1302
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,838
He thinks I don't know this,

1303
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:51,874
but the cheese grater 
and his coffee beans... 
Uh-uh, not true.

1304
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:53,475
...are hidden somewhere where 
he thinks I don't know

1305
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,243
where they are.

1306
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,145
Oh, I think I've struck 
a nerve here!

1307
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:57,046
Yeah, this naturally 
leads me to talking

1308
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,347
about the knives that we own.

1309
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:00,049
Yes, well, I don't 
like you thinking

1310
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:01,750
about knives, Michael, 
when you're annoyed

1311
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,052
with my kitchen habits.

1312
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:06,155
I think I'm gonna have to see 
about getting a group rate

1313
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,489
on a marriage counselor.

1314
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,857
I think so too.

1315
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:11,427
(chef) 
Oh!

1316
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,829
(crowd gasps, applause)

1317
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:14,797
Whoo!

1318
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,969
(Michael) 
Nicky? 
(Jane) 
Tristan...

1319
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:22,738
That was great. 
You're terrific.

1320
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:23,839
(Tristan) 
I had a ball. 
I know.

1321
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,307
Thank you very much. 
Good to see you.

1322
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:26,342
Appreciate it.

1323
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,746
God, that was... 
that was amazing.

1324
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,381
I know. 
Yeah.

1325
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,750
Even now, hm?

1326
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,652
(man) 
Michael? 
Hi.

1327
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:39,388
I've got the information 
on that barbecue place.

1328
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,863
What time is the flight?

1329
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:49,665
3:16.

1330
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:52,868
Why can't they just call it 
3:15 or 3:20?

1331
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:57,239
Is there a stop? 
Non-stop.

1332
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,874
What time do we get home?

1333
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:01,877
5:30.

1334
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,413
What did you mean 
when you said "even now?"

1335
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,616
It was amazing, "even now."

1336
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,120
With everything falling apart.

1337
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,991
I'm so afraid.

1338
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:19,561
Jane, we're only gonna 
be in the air for an hour.

1339
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,430
(sighs)

1340
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,334
I'm afraid nothing 
can be the same again...

1341
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:31,140
that we aren't gonna be Jane 
and Michael Stern anymore.

1342
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,010
♪

1343
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:58,200
With everything that gets 
splattered or sneezed on me,

1344
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,504
I could get AIDS or 
SARS or the flu or...

1345
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:05,741
This is 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week.

1346
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,776
There are times 
when I ask myself why,

1347
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,344
why am I doing this?

1348
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,980
I mean, I became an EMT 
because I thought

1349
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,382
it would be a way 
to get out of my head

1350
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:15,784
and force me to think about 
other people's problems.

1351
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,953
But it's not working anymore,

1352
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:21,290
and-- and I'm-- 
I'm letting Michael down.

1353
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,724
The better I get at this...

1354
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:25,294
I don't know what 
to do except quit.

1355
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,996
You exhaust the hell 
out of me.

1356
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,299
Mm.

1357
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,701
I exhaust me too sometimes.

1358
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:34,603
Just ease up.

1359
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,939
You don't have to go out 
on every call.

1360
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:37,940
(sighs)

1361
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,442
You know, when I first 
met you, I thought, oh,

1362
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:43,946
here we go, 
another damn do-gooder.

1363
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,315
I was so scared of you.

1364
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:49,785
You mean, 
you're not anymore?

1365
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,287
I thought that you'd be 
the last person on Earth

1366
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,656
to stick it out. 
Me too.

1367
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:58,494
But you did. 
I know one thing.

1368
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,263
If I was ever trapped 
in a burning building,

1369
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:06,668
I could count on you to run 
in there and get me.

1370
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,810
(footsteps approaching)

1371
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:19,348
Did I wake you?

1372
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,049
No, no. 
No, I was awake.

1373
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:27,890
What you're saying is you don't 
wanna be married to me anymore.

1374
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:31,426
I love you, Jane.

1375
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,262
I'll always love you.

1376
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,765
But you don't wanna be 
married to me anymore.

1377
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:44,840
Okay.

1378
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:46,575
Jane. 
Enough.

1379
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,045
What do we do?

1380
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:52,414
I mean, I know what we do,

1381
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:55,017
but what do we do 
about our work?

1382
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:03,191
Michael... if we're 
that miserable...

with each other,

about asking Michael

at the chili cook-off.

Ah. 
Um...

he was in the barn

the stalls.

1453

No, it... 
what I meant was...

1481
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:48,957
I saw myself as the same, 
as not a bad person.

1482
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:54,095
And... I know that 
you're not a bad person.

You know, I-- I guess 
what I had...

were these feelings 
for our relationship.

I wish my mother 
had cooked like this.

1501

My mother unfortunately 
was not a soul food cook,

1502
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:04,632
and this is great New Orleans 
soul food at its best.

1503
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:07,402
Which means 
red beans and rice,

1504

Since I was a little girl,

1506
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,642
I'd been afraid 
of losing people.

1507
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:17,445
The fact is, 
one way or the other,

1508
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:18,913
eventually, you just do.

1509
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:19,447
As a working person's café...

1510
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:23,451
The thought of losing Michael 
frightened me so much

1511
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:25,153
that I almost did lose him.

1512
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:28,656
But in the end, 
figuring out how to be together

1513
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:31,960
and still allow each other 
our own separate lives

1514
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,728
made us even closer.

1515

Grafton Volunteer Fire Company,

1517
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:45,340

something else.

1518
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:48,743
Becoming part of 
a firehouse and working

1519

of the Grafton Volunteer 
Fire Department

1521
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,884

I've ever done,

1522
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:57,752
and the most rewarding.

1523
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,256
And it helped me figure out

1524
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:04,526
something really interesting 
about fear.

1525
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:07,996
Fear is like a hologram.

It seems real, 
filled with substance.

And then, when you go 
beyond it,

1528

you realize 
it's just an illusion.
