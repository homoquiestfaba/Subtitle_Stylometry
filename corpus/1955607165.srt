Okay, mind blown with
this last episode.

it would end like this?

- No.
- Some of us did.

I think, Troian, you've
known for a while.

40
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:22,932
You knew for a while, right?

41
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,834
- We didn't know.
- Mm-mm.

some of us go to Marlene and
we're like "So, tell us."

44

- Marlene did not tell me.
- Yeah.

45
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:31,474
Marlene would not tell
me this time though.

46
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:32,642
I did not know anything.

from another castmate and
I didn't want to know.

49
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:38,414
- What?
- I genuinely did not want

50
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,082
- to know until the end and so...
- What do you mean?

51
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,517
Like you're walking by the
water cooler and somebody...

52
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,818
- Who was it?
- Drew Van Acker.

53
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,387
- What?
- Oh, come on.

54

55

Drew ruined it for me, but I loved it.

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,359
Okay, so you found out through Drew?

57
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,727
- Yeah.
- And then, Shay,

58
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,196
you were saying somebody
else knew before you?

59
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,463
Yeah, I mean, I think sometimes

60
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:55,765
throughout the years, you know,

61
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,700
some of us will go and ask the writers

62
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,368
<i>to kind of explain to
us what's gonna happen,</i>

63
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,803
<i>but for this one, yeah, I think Troian,</i>

64
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:02,338
you were the first one out of us

65
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,773
to know what was gonna happen.

66
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:05,208
- Which makes sense.
- That's so true to you,

67
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,876
even on your character on the show,

68
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,277
<i>like, of course Troian would
be the first to know.</i>

69
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:09,912
How did you find out?

70
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:13,516
I found out because I'm A.D.

71
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:14,884
- Yeah, she's A.D.
- I had to know.

72
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:17,153
I understand. When I
was watching, you know,

73
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:19,889
it all go down after it was revealed,

74
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,525
you, Alex, the whole thing,
I literally was like,

75
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:24,493
"I don't think I can still
talk about this yet

76
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:25,695
because it's still so unreal."

77
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:28,164
This is seven years of not knowing.

78
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,465
- Yeah.
- So how did you find out?

79
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:30,833
Was it a script you read, like...

80
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:32,535
No, no, no, I was always somebody

81
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:33,836
- who really liked to know...
- Okay. Yeah.

82
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:35,471
And I like to know what was coming up

83
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:38,341
and I was constantly just
asking Marlene like,

84
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:40,409
"Please tell me, please
tell me, please tell me."

85
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,713
Finally she sort of pulled
me aside privately.

86
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:46,549
I think that was two years ago now.

87
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:48,150
- What?
- Wow! Wait.

88
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:49,585
- Yeah.
- It was that long ago?

89
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,354
Well, she was thinking
in terms of the end game.

90
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:52,688
Oh, it's just so nerve-racking

91
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,523
because I feel like that's

92
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,525
the biggest responsibility
for "Pretty Little Liars"

93
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:59,362
is who carries out the
final "dun-dun-dun."

94
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:01,130
So that's an honor for you to be...

95
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:02,531
- I's a total honor...
- Yeah.

96
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,166
But at the same time,
like, it was so much fun

97
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:07,670
to get to play Alex and
Spencer in the finale,

98
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:10,539
but also, like, every scene
that we got to share,

99
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,774
you know, together, like,

100
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,076
just us closing out our storylines

101
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:15,778
with, you know, watching the two of you

102
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,246
close out your storyline

103
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,515
and watching, like, the Ezria wedding,

104
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:21,751
<i>which I still get so scared
talking about these things.</i>

105
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:23,085
I feel like I'm spoiling things.

106
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,520
You guys have seen everything.

107
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,122
- There's nothing I can spoil.
- Oh, my gosh.

108
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,824
Now you mentioned about
emotional moments

109
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:30,359
watching the girls in
the finale episode.

110
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:32,261
What was epic to you guys?

111
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:33,729
What was hard to shoot?

112
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,231
What was the mood like?

113
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:38,401
Our good-bye scene in the script,

114
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:39,869
<i>we didn't shoot it on the last day</i>

115
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:43,873
<i>but the dialogue was
just even hard to say.</i>

116
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,708
<i>I think they only got,
like, one good take</i>

117
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,143
<i>because my voice was cracking</i>

118
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:50,513
and I, like, couldn't
actually get the words out.

119
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,381
Yeah, it was weird
to get the direction.

120
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,649
Marlene had to come in and be like,

121
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,184
"Could you be less emotional?"

122
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:56,185
- It was sad.
- Yeah.

123
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,020
All right, Shay, Sasha,

124
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:59,822
fans have been all about Emison

125
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,857
since, like, day one.

126
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:03,259
Did you guys ever think

127
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,694
that these two would get
their happy ending?

128
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:06,429
- Kind of.
- Kind of, yeah, I don't know.

129
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:07,663
Emily's had so many girlfriends.

130
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,098
I think I've had more relationships

131
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,333
<i>on this show than anybody.</i>

132
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,134
<i>So it's been a revolving door</i>

133
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:13,669
<i>of, like, girlfriends for Emily,</i>

134
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,304
but I think, I mean,

135
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,006
that's definitely what
the fans wanted and,

136
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,342
you know, we've worked
together since the beginning.

137
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:21,544
And Alison had so many
terrible relationships,

138
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:22,778
and Emily I think was the only one that,

139
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,513
like, truly loved her in that way.

140
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,415
- Right.
- So, her recognizing that

141
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,284
I think was really sweet and important.

142
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:29,719
- Yeah.
- Right.

143
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:32,121
What was it like shooting
the proposal scene?

144
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:33,723
It was funny, yeah.

145
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:36,292
I think it was very fitting
that it wast smooth,

146
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:37,960
- like we were in an argument.
- Yeah.

147
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:39,362
We're not going to sleep

148
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,996
until you tell me what's in that purse.

149
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:43,332
You make me a better woman
because you searched for one.

150
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,301
Do you promise to do that every day

151
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:47,737
- for the rest of our lives?
- I love you too.

152
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:50,206
Shooting the scenes with
our daughters was very fun

153
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,474
- 'cause you had one...
- Yeah.

154
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:53,175
- I know!
- Twin that was crying

155
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,410
the whole time, and one that was happy.

156
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:55,478
So we'd have to kind of switch.

157
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,479
- Yeah.
- And then in, like,

158
00:04:56,481 --> 00:04:57,780
a couple of our takes even

159
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,248
I'm pretending to have one in this arm,

160
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,549
but they would only show this baby...

161
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,851
Yeah, 'cause the other one was crying.

162
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:03,719
But I'm still moving this arm, yeah.

163
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,588
<i>But not only that, they
actually do look identical.</i>

164
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,189
<i>And the only way that we
could really tell them apart</i>

165
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,791
<i>was their earrings, yeah.</i>

166
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:10,159
<i>One had pink flowers,
the other one had blue.</i>

167
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:11,427
It was really cute, yeah.

168
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:13,162
Oh, my gosh, and Lucy for you, too.

169
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:14,864
Ezria was the only relationship

170
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,999
<i>that started way back
in the pilot episode.</i>

171
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:18,834
<i>So how did it feel to
have something that,</i>

172
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:20,903
like, lasted for so long?

173
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:25,007
You know what, the fans of
Ezria, they deserved that.

174
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,710
It felt right, like, I mean, it was...
the strangest thing

175
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:30,179
was reciting those vows though.

176
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:31,247
I don't know, it just felt very real.

177
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,848
I don't know, it was weird.

178
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,617
<i>But I can't image them
not being together.</i>

179
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:36,819
I mean, they've been
through everything, so.

180
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,355
Right, wait I just
have to rewind you to

181
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:41,323
when you were saying it felt so real.
What do you mean?

182
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:42,958
No I was just... not
that I want to marry Ian

183
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,293
in real life,

184
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:45,895
but that having to say that in real life

185
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:47,530
would feel very strange, yeah.

186
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,832
Yes, it actually takes you
through what it's like to say

187
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:51,333
that to somebody, and look
into their eyes and...

188
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,002
Nerve-racking, and in that moment

189
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,403
we could never break eye contact

190
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:55,805
- for the whole scene.
- Right.

191
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:58,007
And I could tell
internally he was laughing,

192
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,375
and I internally was laughing

193
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:01,043
'cause he does this
thing with his mouth.

194
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:02,478
<i>I was like, "Just don't do this to me."</i>

195
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,146
<i>- I know.
- Because usually it's just</i>

196
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:05,548
hard to get through scenes with him,

197
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,615
so it was funny.

198
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,818
And the fans appreciated it much.

199
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,352
So, Ashley, I have to ask you,

200
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:12,888
Hannah was the closest to
Mona throughout the series

201
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,857
<i>and I want to know at the very end,</i>

202
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:17,860
<i>did Hannah suspect Mona was Team A.D.</i>

203
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,161
or did she think she was playing

204
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:20,729
the game the whole time?
What do you think?

205
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,465
Even when Mona... I mean,
after she tried to kill me,

206
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,900
like, running me over with a car, like,

207
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:28,704
Hannah still wanted to be by
her side and stick up for her.

208
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:31,507
Why would you bring her
to my rehearsal dinner?

209
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,576
I'm sorry, okay? I didn't
know what else to do.

210
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:35,244
The last time we saw Mona she tried

211
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:36,645
to push you off the bell tower.

212
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,781
Yeah, and she feels bad about that.

213
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:41,584
Is Mona a good person?
Like, is Mona bad?

214
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,252
<i>No, I think she's good.</i>

215
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:45,054
<i>You know, the game was a very big thing</i>

216
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,756
<i>and it's a huge secret
between me and the girls,</i>

217
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:50,893
and when Hannah broke that trust

218
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:52,161
and introduced the game

219
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:53,629
to Mona she needed Mon's help.

220
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,932
She knew that Mon's
mind could get them to

221
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,801
where they had to be
to finish the game...

222
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:00,102
- Right.
- So Mona really

223
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,437
helped them out.

224
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,072
And how did you feel
when you found out

225
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,340
that Haleb was pregnant?

226
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:05,508
I always told Marlene

227
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,842
I wanted to have kids on the show.

228
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,211
So that was her little
way of sneaking in

229
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:10,813
that I was gonna have a kid.

230
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:12,381
- [laughter]
- Oh!

231
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,216
There's so much juiciness here.
I love this.

232
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,318
Okay, well, we have to sneak
into a break right now,

233
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,786
but we'll have more of the cast

234

behind-the-scenes look at the finale.

236
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,858
But first, we gave each of our liars

237
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,793
a little time to think
about what they've done

238
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:27,429
and to come clean in our
photo booth confessions.

239
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,697
You'll be seeing their confessions

240
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,932
all through the night.

241
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,133
Don't even think about
leaving this party.

wrapping up the show after
seven life-changing seasons.

No, this isn't about money.

00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,761
I's about having a home, and parents,

278
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:01,297
and friends who risk their
lives for each other.

279
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:04,501
Knowing it never really ends.
[applause]

280
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,669
Even the grown men
executives were crying.

281
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,937
No way.

<i>in that room that day.</i>

290
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,787
I think it sunk in, like,
this is the last time

291
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:26,456
I will ever play this character

292
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,526
and I feel like Aria
became part of my identity

293
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,328
because like I said we
spent our 20s on the show.

294
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,730
That's when you're growing up

295

<i>and figuring yourself out and...</i>

296
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,366
Yeah, and we also remember that room

297
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,667
when we had our first table read,

298
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,035
like, I know what
everybody was wearing...

299
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,470
- Yeah, I know.
- I remember that so vividly.

300
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:41,704
It was the same room we had our first

301
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,239
and last table read in the same...

302
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:44,407
Yeah, that wasn't hard.

303
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:45,975
- Hey, that's awesome.
- Yeah.

304
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:47,977
All right, if you weren't
casted your character

305
00:09:47,979 --> 00:09:50,013
and you could be casted
another character,

306
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:51,881
who would you want to be?

307
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,583
- I've always said Mona.
- Really?

308
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,118
<i>I really like Mona. Yeah, just because</i>

309
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,453
she's been, like, eight
different characters.

310
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,822
<i>There's kind of a little
Mona in all of us I feel like.</i>

311
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:03,192
Yeah, split personality?
Yeah, totally.

312
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:05,628
I've always said Spencer
because I love the character,

313
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,730
but I think it's because it's Troian.

314
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,599
There could be no other Spencer.

315
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:10,567
Right.

316
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,634
That actually kind of reminds me

317
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,169
of we were doing a scene together

318
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,238
and I was looking at Sasha
playing Alison and, like,

319
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,574
we were all, like, lovey-dovey
and, like, we're all friends

320
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,908
and I was thinking that she was, like,

321
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,743
gonna marry Emily and I was like,

322
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,079
"Remember when you were
a total bitch to us?"

323
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,280
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

324
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:25,548
- Yes.
- What are you doing here?

325
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,517
- What a change!
- All right, Troian,

326
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,085
tell us about your role.

327
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,720
I mean, with the Alex and
being a different character

328
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:32,989
but looking the same,
and the British accent.

329
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:35,625
It was just a total
blast and the crew, like,

330
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:37,427
joined in with me doing the accent.

331
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,962
It was, like, almost, like, British Day

332
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:40,930
whenever I would come and
everybody would... everybody

333
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,665
just kept on talking to
me in a British accent

334
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,400
and I was like, "Well, this
makes it easier for me

335
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:45,602
to continue, I guess."

336
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,903
But yeah, it was a total blast.

337
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:50,139
Doing scenes with yourself is insane

338
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,908
<i>because I would come in and
Marlene would be like,</i>

339
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,376
"Okay, who do you want
to rehearse as first?

340
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:54,477
Do you want to be Alex or Spencer?"

341
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,945
And I would say, "All right,

342
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,614
"well, I want to be Alex
because she's the one

343
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,982
"who has the freedom to
move around in the scene

344
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:00,583
because Spencer's chained to the bed."

345
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:06,089
- Who are you?
- [laughs] Really?

346
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:07,824
How hard did Mona hit you?

347
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,560
I'm just a girl who met a man
when he came in from the rain.

348
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:11,928
That's really cool to picture now,

349
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,630
now that we've seen how it played out

350
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,565
to see what you were actually
doing behind the scenes.

351
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:16,699
Yeah.

352
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:18,301
Who did you channel to get that Alex?

353
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,003
Were there any inspirations
or any moments in your life

354
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:22,171
that you needed to get to
get that grit and that?

355
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:24,641
Actually I watched a lot
of, like, Sid Vicious.

356
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,975
- I wanted her to feel...
- Oh, my gosh.

357
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,977
Very, very punk and Sid Vicious just,

358
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,279
like, didn't care at all about the way

359
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:31,481
that he was coming across.

360
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,649
He just did whatever he wanted.

361
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,484
That to me was Alex, especially

362
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,252
because it's such a contrast

363
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:37,920
to I think the way Alex views Spencer

364
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,589
which is so strung up,

365
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,124
and tight, and, like, all of this.

366
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:42,825
So whenever I wanted to be
Alex I wanted to just be,

367
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,329
like, a mess and, like, spit
and yell and everything.

368
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,997
Alex looked like a hot ball of fun.

369
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,799
I wouldn't have minded,
like, meeting Alex...

370
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:51,834
- She's a hot mess, yeah.
- In a pub somewhere.

371
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,605
How does it feel now after
a long seven-year journey

372
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:58,775
to, I mean, literally
after this wrap party

373
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:00,777
know that you're not going to come back,

374
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,311
and you're not going to work together...

375
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:03,446
- Don't say that.
- And you're not gonna see

376
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:04,814
a lot of this crew.

377
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,015
How does that feel?

378
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,216
I think I'm gonna miss
the people the most,

379
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:08,751
that's the thing.

380
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:10,386
<i>I's like, our crew is hands down</i>

381
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:12,789
<i>the most amazing people
I've ever worked with,</i>

382
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,257
and they're not all gonna be

383
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,558
in the same place at the same time.

384
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,893
But it is a small world.

385
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,628
Like, I'm sure one day down the line

386
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,597
I'll work with Jill who
does sound, or Carlos...

387
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,066
- Yes.
- Who does B-camera, like,

388
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,701
I'm stoked to see what everyone does

389
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,269
'cause I know we're all gonna go off

390
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:28,304
and do really cool things

391
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:29,872
and take these fans from the show.

392
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,908
I know they're gonna support
us in whatever we do.

393
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,444
- What about for you, Ashley?
- I think that the show ended

394
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:37,146
at the time that it was
supposed to and I think

395
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:38,414
that we're all very proud

396
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,783
of how successful the show has been

397
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:43,686
and just knowing that we've
touched so many people's lives

398
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:47,457
and the last episode was
truly our best episode ever.

399
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,792
I mean, we're always
going to be a family.

400
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:51,861
This is not the end for any of us,

401
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:53,863
so tonight our wrap
party, it's not like,

402
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:55,531
"Oh, my God, I'm never
gonna see you again."

403
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,266
I's, "I can't wait to see you again,

404
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:58,801
or work with you or whatever," you know?

405
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:00,703
- Really, really cool.
- I's just kind of crazy

406
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:02,038
'cause, like, growing up
with, like, "Dawson's Creek"

407
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,740
or "The O.C." and when those shows ended

408
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,209
I remember how, like, heartbroken I was,

409
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:07,744
- and now that's, like, our show.
- Yeah.

410
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,379
The last day of shooting
was such an emotional day,

411
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:11,681
not only because of what
you guys are sharing,

412
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,182
but your fans knew this too.

413
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:16,252
I mean, Ashley, you shared
on Snapchat you were crying

414
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,720
and I felt it through your emotions

415
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:19,622
that you were really...
things come to the end.

416
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,858
I know, Shay, for you too,
you were getting emotional.

417
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,227
What was that like for you
guys shooting the ending,

418
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:25,795
getting emotional,

419
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:27,597
and then also how are you
conveying this to your fans?

420
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,899
I Snapchatted just because
I thought it was really cool

421
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,601
for the fans to see,
like, our last moments

422
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,636
together and, like, how
we are with our crew

423
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:35,438
and the relationships that we've built

424
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,473
and, you know, it was all, like,

425
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,976
just a very genuine feeling
that we were just, like,

426
00:13:39,978 --> 00:13:43,579
leaving something that's been
so much a part of our lives

427
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:45,414
for the last seven years and
I think it was really cool

428
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,850
for the fans to know, like,

429
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:50,419
this is our last day,
her's what it looks like,

430
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:52,221
her's what we're going through and...

431
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:53,456
How much we care about everyone.

432
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,690
Yeah, I think it was really cool

433
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:57,393
for them to see our last day

434
00:13:57,395 --> 00:13:58,494
because we share it with them...

435
00:13:58,496 --> 00:13:59,896
Right, they've been

436
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:01,430
a part of our journey
for the entire way...

437
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:02,598
We share every... yeah,
for the seven years.

438
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,866
So, like, when the final moments

439
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,334
you also want to share it with them,

440
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:06,769
even if our eyelashes are coming off

441
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:08,137
and we're crying our eyes out, you know?

442
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,172
Right, I cried, it was so hard.

443
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:10,239
Since we know this was going

444
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,741
to be a monumental occasion

445
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:14,343
we sent a camera crew to
the set for the last day

446
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:15,878
of shooting for the final episode.

447
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,947
We wanted to see what that
was like for all of you,

448
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:20,249
and of course share it
with all your fans.

449
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,084
So let's take a look at it right now.

450
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:23,920
That's what those cameras were for.

451
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:27,990
- All right, now we know.
- Now we know.

452
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,725
Rolling sound.

00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:31,093

I just remember being like...
[gasping sobs]

466
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,786
Like, not being able to breathe.

467
00:14:56,788 --> 00:14:59,121
I just remember being
totally punch-drunk.

468
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:04,193
I was shooting in every scene
twice, fighting with myself.

469
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,795
Well, I am Spencer now!

470
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,864
It was just completely overwhelming.

471
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,600
Every time we saw someone we
couldn't look them in the eye

472
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:14,604
because we would literally
automatically start crying.

473
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:17,340

474

518
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,843

520

Everybody has said to me...
everyone on this couch

521
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:10,686
has said to me that they wanted
to be "A" at some point in time.

522
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:11,687
No way!

523

And now the party can
really get started

524

because we have the mastermind
behind "Pretty Little Liars"

525
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,629
with us, the woman who
developed the series

526
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,566
and directed the finale along
with so many other episodes,

527
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:35,969
Marlene King is in the house!

528
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,704
[cheers and applause]

529
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:40,006

530
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:42,675
Thank you, well, these guys
taught me everything I know.

531
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:45,712
So we all just watched
the most epic finale ever.

532
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:48,348
Did you have this ending in mind?

533
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,583
And how long have you been planning it?

534
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:52,018
Well, definitely for years.

535
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,920
I didn't know sort of
scene by scene by scene

536
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:56,222
what it was going to be
like until a few months

537
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:58,024
before we started shooting it,

538
00:17:58,026 --> 00:17:59,726
<i>even a few weeks for some things,</i>

539
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:03,096
but we knew who A.D. was, and who A.D.
was going to be,

540
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,999
and what the connections to all
the dots were going to be.

541
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,133
So for years, really.

542
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:08,601
I see, and for you, ladies,

543
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:11,404
what was your favorite
plot twist in the finale?

544
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:12,572
I would say Alex, yeah.

545
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:13,973
That was the ultimate plot twist.

546
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:15,708
<i>That was the biggest plot twist.</i>

547
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,944
As a writer, some of the fun
was convincing the audience

548
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:19,779
that Spencer was A.D.

549
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:22,348
for I think several acts
before then we realize

550
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,484
that wasn't Spencer at
all, that was Alex.

551
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,653
Did you guys ever, you know,

552
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:29,155
try to give her ideas with who A.D.
should be or...

553
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:31,758
Everybody has said to me...
everyone on this couch...

554
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,126
I don't know if Shay has said it,

555
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:34,594
but everybody else has said

556
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:35,995
that they wanted to be "A"
at some point in time.

557
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:37,430
- I think everyone wanted...
- No way!

558
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:39,465
I think every character...

559
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:41,067
- Brendan...
- Brendan.

560
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:42,268
<i>Everybody on the
show wanted to be "A."</i>

561
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,636
<i>Oh, Brendan.</i>

562
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:45,371
I's sort of the most
coveted role on the show.

563
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,140
Everybody wants to be either bad,

564
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:49,442
or A.D., or a combination of both.

565
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:51,110
- Right.
- And Lucy got to really have

566
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:52,445
a turn this year too

567
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:54,047
which I thought was really fun.

568
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,016
Marlene was so amazing and
gave me the best storyline

569
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:58,551
<i>I could have asked for so it was fun</i>

570
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:00,353
<i>to go to the bad side for a little bit,</i>

571
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:01,988
but she came around in the end, so.

572
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,189
- You got to wear the hoodie.
- I got to wear the hoodie.

573
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:04,657
That's all I wanted, yeah.

574
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:06,693
Also, can I just say
that was really fun?

575
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:08,895
Because I got to direct the episode.

576
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,897
- After, okay.
- Then you just come in after.

577
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,033
And then once he kind of
starts to chip away at that...

578
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:15,168
Just have him cross this out.

579
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,903
Yeah, and action.

580
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,705
It was so clear that I
guess you had been, like,

581
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:20,406
thinking about it for a while

582
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:22,775
because the second that I
put, like, the camera on her

583
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,344
<i>and I was like, "All right, go nuts,</i>

584
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:25,578
<i>I want to see what you do with this,"</i>

585
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,814
it was like she had made every choice.

586
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:29,515
I'd been preparing for many years.

587
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:30,683
And I've also never seen you so evil,

588
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:32,652
and I was like, "Yup, you got it."

589
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:35,722
Looking over the last seven
seasons, "Pretty Little Liars"

590
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:37,757
has tackled a lot of social issues.

591
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,394
Which do you think had the
most impact on your audience?

592
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:42,795
I think two... one of them

593
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:45,565
is just the whole idea of bullying.

594
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,433
Bullying online, and bullying at school.

595
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,502
I's so prevalent in society,

596
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:52,071
and the show tackles it
literally every episode.

597
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:55,541
And also sexuality,
Emily's coming out story.

598
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:59,012
People forget, seven years
ago it was still...

599
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,713
<i>and I think it still is now a big deal.</i>

600
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:01,881
<i>- It still is.
- If you don't live</i>

601
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:03,149
on the East Coast or the West Coast,

602
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,550
you know, you're struggling.

603
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:06,686
And so I think we're all extremely proud

604
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:10,156
of giving a face to a young woman

605
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:11,858
who came out to her friends

606
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,961
<i>and was unconditionally
accepted by everyone.</i>

607
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,996
Have you had any stories
where fans have come up to you

608
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:20,099
and told you what "Pretty Little
Liars" has done for them?

609
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:21,601
- Oh, my God, all the time.
- Yeah, all the time.

610
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:23,236
- All the time.
- I've had older women

611
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:24,437
come up to me and saying

612
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,838
that they wished that the show was on

613
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,674
when they were in school,
you know, so that

614
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:29,208
they could've had somebody
that they would relate to

615
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,476
<i>and it's just really nice to know</i>

616
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:32,645
that as entertaining as our show is,

617
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,547
it also has that impact on their lives

618
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:35,782
in a very important way, yeah.

619
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,617
And I had... somebody sent me a letter

620
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,886
that I kept on my desk,
and I shared with you...

621
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,788
- You brought it to me, yeah.
- And everyone.

622
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,956
It was a transgender college student

623
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,925
who had tried to commit suicide

624
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:49,262
and when she came out of the hospital

625
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:50,730
all she had was "Pretty Little Liars"

626
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,533
and she binge-watched it and
came out of her depression.

627
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:56,035
Those kind of things are
so meaningful to us.

628
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,737
Wow, I know as a fan myself,

629
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,639
when I get to bond with other people

630
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,541
who have watched "Pretty Little Liars"

631
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,676
it brings you into this in-crowd

632
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,712
where you just understand
that it's a bond,

633
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:08,281
it's a sisterhood, it's a relatability

634
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:09,916
and it's an empathy for everybody

635
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:11,417
and what they're going through out there

636
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:12,618
and I love that "Pretty Little Liars"

637
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,953
brought that to everybody.

638
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:15,822
'Cause crazy as it is, I always say,

639
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:18,491

a story about friendship.

A-List Wrap Party."

669
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:37,531
The series has come to an end,

670
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:39,633

what was it like for you guys

<i>Like first impressions compared</i>

<i>to what you know of each other today?</i>

677
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:54,081
I remember thinking about Shay,

678
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,649
she's really glamorous and beautiful

679
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:57,617
and she's got great hair.
And she's so smart.

680
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,186
I don't know if a lot of
people know that about Shay.

681
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:00,754
She's so smart, and
worldly, and cultured.

682
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:04,257
And what I remember about
Troian is at the table read,

683
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,360
I was like, "I love her voice."

684
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:08,628
It was so, like, husky, and raspy.

685
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,697
And so that was my
first, initial reaction.

686
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:13,200
And she's just one of those
people that whatever she does,

687
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,801
she does it really well.

688
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:17,003
I's, like, annoying, but
awesome at the same time.

689
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:19,106
But Ashley and I go way back.

690
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:21,208
We met on MySpace when we were 15.

691
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,210
- Get out!
- Oh, my God, my mermaid hair.

692
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:24,344
- What?
- Your mermaid hair.

693
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:25,812
It was a beautiful photo.

694
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:27,681
- And that horrible bikini.
- You looked great.

695
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:29,316
Oh, my gosh, that's crazy.
What about for you, Troian?

696
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:31,251
What was your first
impression of the ladies?

697
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:34,287
My favorite actually
embarrassing story

698
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,391
about the first time
that I experienced Sasha

699
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:40,260
was we were in the bathroom
together and I assumed

700
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:42,629
that she was my age at the
time which was like...

701
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,031
- I assumed she was a young 20s.
- Yeah.

702
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,334
<i>I was, like, washing my
hand and I was like "God,</i>

703
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:49,870
"the way that you play Alison,

704
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:51,471
"you got that, like, mean girl,

705
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,839
that, like, middle school mean girl."

706
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,574
I was like, "You just
brought me back to,

707
00:23:54,576 --> 00:23:58,044
like, being, like, 12, or
13 or something like that."

708
00:23:58,046 --> 00:23:59,913
And I had no idea that
she was actually...

709
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:01,081
- 12.
- Only 12.

710
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,150
- It was 12.
- Just turned 12.

711
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:04,851
And she was very polite about it

712
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:06,653
and she was like, "Oh,
thank you, I'm so..."

713
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,221
- Wait.
- But I just remember, like,

714
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:09,990
looking at her and being
like, yeah, like,

715
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,858
you've got this character down
and I didn't realize that

716
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,461
there was a 10-year age
difference between us.

717
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:16,096
- That's crazy.
- That's insane.

718
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:19,032
There's nobody else who
could've played Alison.

719
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:20,300
- How?
- Literally nobody.

720
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:22,102
We had the best Alison under the sun.

721
00:24:22,104 --> 00:24:24,671
- Aw, that's so sweet.
- Thanks.

722
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:27,007
All right, so for you, Shay,
what's a funny memory you have

723
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:28,608
of these ladies when you first met them?

724
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,610
Funny memory I have is when
we shot the pilot in Vancouver.

725
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:33,213
I'm Canadian so I'm used to
the cold, and I just remember

726
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:35,415
looking at all of them with,
like, massive jackets on

727
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,250
<i>and to me I was like, "This
is a nice fall day."</i>

728
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:38,151
<i>- It was December.
- I know it was,</i>

729
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:39,352
but for me it wast...

730
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,021
- It was freezing cold.
- That cold.

731
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,889
- It was so cold.
- Yes, it was.

732
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:44,591
We were outside fighting,

733
00:24:44,593 --> 00:24:46,226
and it started snowing
and we were in bikinis.

734
00:24:46,228 --> 00:24:47,794
No, for that scene, but I wast there.

735
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:49,830
She's asking my first impression
when I first saw you guys,

736
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:51,031
and we were walking to
Thanksgiving dinner.

737
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:52,399
So in my mind...

738
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,667
It was look at these
California bitches.

739
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:55,001
I was like, yeah,

740
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:56,903
they all have big jackets on and...

741
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:59,039
All right, so I want to
know, what would you guys do

742
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,507
if the things that happened

743
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:03,276
to your characters happened
to you in real life?

744
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:05,178
I would change my phone number,

745
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,713
<i>and I would've gone to the police.</i>

746
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:09,382
<i>And your parents. I
would've told my parents.</i>

747
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:12,419
If someone was harassing
me like that, I would 100%

748
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:13,820
tell my parents before it got that bad.

749
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:15,622
Sasha, for real, at
that young of an age...

750
00:25:15,624 --> 00:25:17,123
For reals.

751
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,692
When you're getting random
text messages and somebody...

752
00:25:18,694 --> 00:25:20,393
Totally, but I have
a close relationship

753
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:21,828
with my parents so maybe that's why.

754
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,397
I think anybody would
call the police ASAP.

755
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,665
Yeah, but, no, think about it.

756
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,067
At that age, when you're that young,

757
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:28,602
you're like 15 and someone says

758
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:30,237
they want to kill you? Like,
I would tell my parents.

759
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,539
And also, "A" was always
threatening to kill you.

760
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,807
Yeah, regular.

761
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,308
Like, those are the
messages to you is, like...

762
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,776
- Totally.
- They were really violent.

763
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:38,778
Or, like, Lucy, when
you were stuck in a box.

764
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,715
[panting and whimpering]

765
00:25:44,785 --> 00:25:46,353
[screams]

766
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:48,154
What would you do in real life?

767
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:50,724
I'm 100% certain I
could take anyone out.

768
00:25:50,726 --> 00:25:52,459
I know I'm small, but I
feel like I could've...

769
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:54,528
<i>whoever put me in that box,</i>

770
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,296
<i>I feel like I could knock
them out in real life.</i>

771
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:57,797
- I would find a way.
- See?

772
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,533
I would never be put
in that position...

773
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:01,501
- Well, it's true.
- Because it would just never...

774
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:02,669
I also think we wouldn't have gone

775
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:04,437
in the forest as often as we did.

776
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,672
- Yes, stop going in the woods.
- You know, like, I think

777
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:07,207
I would've learned my lesson, yeah.

778
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:08,508
And stop going to the woods in heels.

779
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,410
In heels, like, quit
wearing your heels

780
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:12,212
- running through the woods.
- That's my new Instagram bio,

781
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:15,448
"Stop going into the woods with heels."

782
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,184
Now, with so many characters
being murdered in the show,

783
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:20,587
what was the most surprising death?

784
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,789
Which was something you
guys didn't expect?

785
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,625
In order to actually
surprise me on the show

786
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:29,996
it would have to be somebody
like Toby, or like Caleb,

787
00:26:29,998 --> 00:26:31,932
or like Spencer, you know what I mean?

788
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:33,733
That would be actually shocking.

789
00:26:33,735 --> 00:26:36,236
Is that the same for
all of you ladies, too?

790
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:38,104
I think I was still
shocked when my dad died,

791
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:39,839
- that was kind of...
- Yeah.

792
00:26:39,841 --> 00:26:41,741
Oh, yeah I forgot your dad died.
That was sad.

793
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:43,209
Well, it happened in the jump, right?

794
00:26:43,211 --> 00:26:44,578
- Yeah, yeah.
- What'd you say?

795
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,580
- I forgot her dad died.
- Ashle's like,

796
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:47,881
"Oh, yeah, I forgot your dad died."

797
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:49,349
Your dad died, yeah, yeah.

798
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:50,817
I think that was also the
thing, why it was never

799
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,452
so surprising whenever
anybody died on our show,

800
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:54,721
because they would just
come back for flashbacks.

801
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,222
- Right.
- Right.

802
00:26:56,224 --> 00:26:57,257
You know what I mean? So
you knew when somebody died

803
00:26:57,259 --> 00:26:58,792
you'd be talking to Ashley

804
00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:00,427
and be like, "Oh, man, it
sucks that you're dying

805
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:01,895
but, like, now I'll
probably see you more."

806
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:04,130
Like, we saw Andrea way
more after Jessica died.

807
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:05,932
<i>- Totally, yeah.
- You know?</i>

808
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,534
- Yeah.
- Because we did lose

809
00:27:07,536 --> 00:27:08,735
so many beloved

810
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:10,737
and not so beloved
characters over the years,

811
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:12,772
we thought we should
take one last look back

812
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:15,375
at those who didn't make
it out of Rosewood alive.

813
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:18,645

00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,493
There's boob grabbing on the set?

858
00:29:57,952 --> 00:30:00,819
Welcome back, guys, we
were just talking about you.

859
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:03,655
Well, not you personally
but you fans in general

860
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:05,047
'cause "Pretty Little Liars" fans

861
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:06,751
are among the most passionate

862
00:30:06,753 --> 00:30:09,187
and like to get very personal,
wouldn't you guys say?

863
00:30:09,189 --> 00:30:10,688
- Yeah.
- So let's find out

864
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,156
what's some of their
most burning questions.

865
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:13,658
- You guys ready for this?
- both: Sure.

866
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,460
Okay, if you could've
changed one thing

867
00:30:15,462 --> 00:30:17,362
about your characters what would it be,

868
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:18,896
and why would you change it?

869
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:20,465
- Shay, you can go.
- Yeah.

870
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,967
They all think that I'm
gonna say her wardrobe.

871
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:25,570
<i>- I'm not like Emily style-wise.
- I think we know this.</i>

872
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:28,473
Seeing on Instagram you love a
good, pretty piece of fashion.

873
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:30,775
Definitely do. I don't really know

874
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:32,543
if there is much I would
change about Emily.

875
00:30:32,545 --> 00:30:33,978
- Really?
- No.

876
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,347
I really do like how she was.

877
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:38,549
So if you were gonna
pick one item of clothing

878
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:41,319
that Emily could start
wearing, what would it be?

879
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:43,988
- Heels.
- Yeah, probably heels.

880
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,223
- Yeah.
- Okay, nice.

881
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:46,457
What about for you, Ashley?

882
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,326
- Nothing.
- Nothing at all?

883
00:30:48,328 --> 00:30:49,761
- No.
- You loved your character

884
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:51,529
- just the way she was?
- Mm-hmm.

885
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:53,498
But that's, like, being
an actor, like, for me,

886
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,067
like, Acting 101 is not
judging the character.

887
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:58,403
I think when you judge and be
like, "Why was she doing that?"

888
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:00,405
you get... that's the wrong thing.

889
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:01,773
Ari's not me.

890
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:03,141
Although I would not act like Aria,

891
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:04,776
or do the decisions she made,

892
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:06,144
that's who she is, that's
how she's written.

893
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:07,745
You have to accept that, you know?

894
00:31:07,747 --> 00:31:11,582
Troian, I feel like you're
very similar to Spencer

895
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:13,184
because Spencer is very intelligent

896
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:14,786
and I mean, those sides are the same.

897
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:16,254
Is there anything you would
have changed about Spencer?

898
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:17,422
No, I agree.

899
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:19,223
I really, I mean, there's...

900
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:21,392
I could not have said
it better than Lucy

901
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:22,927
- and they are who they are...
- Right.

902
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:24,762
And we feel lucky to
have portrayed them

903
00:31:24,764 --> 00:31:26,030
for as long as we did.

904
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:30,134
Yeah, now who was your
favorite villain on "PLL"?

905
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:31,502
I mean, I love some old school Ali.

906
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:33,037
I was just gonna say the same thing.

907
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,172
<i>I really do.</i>

908
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:35,506
I think Ali's my favorite villain.

909
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:37,975
But Mona too, like, I love dark Mona.

910
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:39,977
<i>I love Mona and Radley,
you know, she's crazy.</i>

911
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:42,280
- Yes.
- And I love Alex.

912
00:31:42,282 --> 00:31:44,582
I love Alex. I also love

913
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:46,884
when we thought that Spencer
was bad for a second,

914
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:49,387
and when she was in the insane
asylum that was interesting.

915
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:51,589
<i>Ooh, that was juicy.</i>

916
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:52,557
<i>You weren't really a villain.</i>

917
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,958
Felt very much "Girl Interrupted"

918
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
- for you in those moments.
- Yeah, I loved that.

919
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:59,464
What's one thing you ladies
will miss about one another?

920
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:01,499
One thing. I know there's a lot.

921
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,000
You guys have covered some
but what's the one thing?

922
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:04,569
- For each person?
- Yeah.

923
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:06,504
I would say, well, for
Troian she's the advice,

924
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:09,807
you know, go to her, and
also she explains words.

925
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:12,310
Like, we'd read a word and Ashley

926
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:14,479
and I would be like,
"Troian, what does it mean?"

927
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:15,880
- No, you wouldn't.
- She's the dictionary.

928
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:17,682
You guys would get
into a competition...

929
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:19,283
- We would argue, we would.
- About who was right about it,

930
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:20,651
and then you'd be like,
"Troian, what is that?"

931
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,186
And then all of a sudden
you guys would start,

932
00:32:22,188 --> 00:32:23,688
- like, hitting each other.
- Yeah, I know.

933
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,523
You'd be like, "Got it
right, got it right."

934
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:27,225
- Yeah, we would do that.
- Troian's you're human Siri.

935
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:28,659
- Yeah.
- Ashley, I'm gonna miss

936
00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:30,495
the uncomfortable
moments she puts you in

937
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:33,197
when she does her pranks and
jokes with the crew and cast.

938
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:36,868
I mean, one time she actually
made our hair person think

939
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,603
that she burned Ashley on the arm...

940
00:32:38,605 --> 00:32:40,138
- Oh, my God!
- And I had to sit in it.

941
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,572
- That's so wrong!
- And I was so uncomfortable

942
00:32:41,574 --> 00:32:42,874
because I knew she was joking

943
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:45,476
but, like, she just lets you sit in it

944
00:32:45,478 --> 00:32:46,811
until it's uncomfortable.

945
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:48,780
And I'm like, "Okay, we need to tell her

946
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:51,549
that you're joking," you
know, and she just doesn't.

947
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:53,551
- Ashley, that's evil.
- Yeah.

948
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:55,953
- I love it.
- Luce,

949
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:57,321
I'm gonna miss your little...

950
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:59,590
she's, like, the most, best gift giver,

951
00:32:59,592 --> 00:33:01,225
best, like, arts and crafts,

952
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:02,493
so, like, I always see her working

953
00:33:02,495 --> 00:33:03,761
on something and every sing... you know,

954
00:33:03,763 --> 00:33:05,596
she really does give the best gifts.

955
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:08,699
- Aw, thanks.
- And Sash, I mean,

956
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:10,468
my partner in this.

957
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,437
<i>We've had a lot of funny
moments, you know?</i>

958
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,671
<i>We have a lot of... a lot of laughs.</i>

959
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:15,440
A lot of laughs, a lot of, like...

960
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:17,575
- A lot of boob grabbing.
- Boob grabbing, nipple grazing.

961
00:33:17,577 --> 00:33:20,478
Protecting each other. Yeah.

962
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,146
There's boob grabbing on the set?

963
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:23,648
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, in scenes.

964
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,916
In, like, our sex scenes and...

965
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:26,517
Oh, got it.

966
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,752
You know I'm here for you, right?

967
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:29,387
Why are you getting so sentimental?

968
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:30,755
I'm trying to create a vibe here,

969
00:33:30,757 --> 00:33:32,824
and it definitely is not sweet.

970
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:38,196
I was just actually thinking,
like, the thing that

971
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:39,931
I'm gonna miss the most
is that on our set

972
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:43,701
I don't think I've ever laughed harder.

973
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:46,471
Like, there were just so
many moments at 3:00 a.m.

974
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:49,440
when I thought I was going to pass out

975
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:50,575
<i>if I had to run through the woods</i>

976
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:52,777
in my heels one more
time and then, like,

977
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:54,512
Ashley would say something
and I would literally just,

978
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:56,280
like, fall to the ground
in the wood chips

979
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:58,883
of the Warner Brothers back lot.

980
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:00,485
And I just don't... I don't feel like

981
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:03,054
I've ever had that much consistent fun.

982
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:06,424
I'm gonna miss going to work
and everyone has a good time,

983
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:09,393
but the second that camera rolls
everyone knows their lines.

984
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:12,196
Like, this is the most
fun group of girls,

985
00:34:12,198 --> 00:34:13,498
<i>but also the most professional.</i>

986
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,466
There was never a moment where
I was like, "Oh, my God!

987
00:34:15,468 --> 00:34:17,068
Why don't they know their lines?"

988
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,603
Or, "Why aren't they..." and
then the second someone

989
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:20,104
yells cut it's back to being goofy.

990
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:22,473
So it was the equal
amount of work and fun.

991
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:24,509
I can actually see
that here even today.

992
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:26,177
There's so much glam, obviously you guys

993
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,812
have to get dressed for the wrap party.

994
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:30,381
You ladies were on time.
Glam was wrapped,

995
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:31,949
outfits together, everybody in position.

996
00:34:31,951 --> 00:34:34,852
I mean, you're very, very professional

997
00:34:34,854 --> 00:34:36,287
and you guys know the drill.

998
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:37,788
You're amazing.

999
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,725
Which brings me to ask, do
you think you would be open

1000
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:43,661
to a reunion years from
now, let's say, like,

1001
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:46,597
a 10-year reunion show
or anything like that?

1002
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,499
I would definitely
be open to a reunion

1003
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:50,368
just 'cause I would
want to see everybody

1004
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:53,170
and it would very much
depend on what it was for,

1005
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:54,705
and what the characters

1006
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:56,674
were gonna be doing next
and why we were doing it.

1007
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:59,844
I mean, I would never want
to pass up an opportunity

1008
00:34:59,846 --> 00:35:01,512
to do that, you know what I mean?

1009
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:03,314
But I think the great thing
about our friendship

1010
00:35:03,316 --> 00:35:06,183
is that I feel like I can
have that with the girls

1011
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:08,352
with or without a reunion.

1012
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:09,620
So I think the reunion
will have to be...

1013
00:35:09,622 --> 00:35:11,188
it would have to be pretty special

1014
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,390
and I think we would all really want it

1015
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:13,591
to be something that would be...

1016
00:35:13,593 --> 00:35:15,493
- Yeah, meaningful.
- Do it justice.

1017
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:17,228
- Yeah, to do it justice.
- Right.

1018
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,530
I don't feel like you ladies
would lose much touch anyway.

1019
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:21,699
I can see that when you
guys have children,

1020
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:24,201
or start a new company
I feel like you guys

1021
00:35:24,203 --> 00:35:25,636
would be there to support one another.

1022
00:35:25,638 --> 00:35:27,138
- Yeah.
- Well, don't kick off

1023
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,439
your party shoes just yet

1024
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:30,207

that you could finally let out now?

1051

- Dirty secrets.
- Right.

Was there a moment that you
guys had to keep a secret

1055
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,790
and it was so hard

1056
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,525
whether it was your family asking you,

1057
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,594
bothering you, your fans,
that you were like,

1058
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:57,830
"Oh, I can't wait till
this just gets free"?

1059
00:36:57,832 --> 00:37:00,332
My family, like, learned
to quit asking me I think,

1060
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:01,733
like, season two because...

1061
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:03,402
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, they just quit asking

1062
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:05,838
- because they knew I couldn't.
- Yeah, I mean,

1063
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,906
and I think now everyone
knows the storyline

1064
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:09,842
so we... it's been nice to
not have to keep anything.

1065
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:11,610
- Right.
- What are secrets from the set

1066
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:12,978
that most fans wouldn't know?

1067
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,613
- We hide our phones...
- Insane asylum... yeah.

1068
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:16,148
Like, we always...
like, they're all...

1069
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,583
- There's always a phone...
- Around us right now.

1070
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:19,051
We all have our phones here but, like...

1071
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:20,152
Where's your phone, you guys?

1072
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,820
Show it, where's your phone?

1073
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,722
Mine is actually downstairs, so.

1074
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:24,823
Really funny.

1075
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,259
- So, we hide them always.

You could have your real phone but...

1077
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,895
Real phone in the scene,

1078
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:31,196
<i>it's just our character's case.</i>

1079
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:32,431
<i>Not mine.</i>

1080
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:34,299
I had this, like, old 1999 cell phone

1081
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:35,834
for the longest time.

All right, who is the
highest maintenance on set?

1083
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:41,640
Who takes the longest to get ready?

1084
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:44,476
- Ian Harding.
- The boys take forever.

1085
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:46,178
<i>Wait, seriously?</i>

1086
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,546
<i>They take forever to come
down, like, dressed...</i>

1087
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:48,714
- Yes.
- What?

1088
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:50,115
They take the longest to change.

1089
00:37:50,117 --> 00:37:51,116
They've got hair and socks

1090
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:52,651
to worry about, what?

1091
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:55,053
You'd be shocked.

1092
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:56,655
And out of you guys here,

1093
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:59,191
who would you say is gonna
be the most on time?

1094
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,527
- I'm always late.
- I'm always five minutes late

1095
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,562
because I always have to get coffee.

1096
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:05,230
And who's lowest maintenance

1097
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:06,999
if there wasn't glam, God forbid?

1098
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,634
Who would be like, "That's
fine, let's shoot"?

1099
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:10,269
Probably Troian. Or Ashley, yeah.

1100
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:11,670
Oh, for real?

1101
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:13,005
Oh, but you need your
coffee and you're good?

1102
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,574
- Mm-hmm.
- So over the last seven years

1103
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:18,076
what has fan support meant to you?

1104
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,745
You guys have seen it change

1105
00:38:19,747 --> 00:38:23,916
and grow to a huge,
unbelievable amount today.

1106
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:25,684
What has it meant for you
in your personal life?

1107
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:28,921
I think because it's been
so huge internationally

1108
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:31,023
it's cool for me cause my
family's in South Africa

1109
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:32,691
and so that's how my family

1110
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:35,394
sees me is, you know, through the show.

1111
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,262
And just the fact... I
saw the other day, like,

1112
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:39,364
our show is in the top five shows

1113
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:41,166
almost in every country.

1114
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:42,568
- Yeah, that's crazy.
- Wow.

1115
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,403
Which is mind-blowing. Mind-blowing.

1116
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,671
- Yeah.
- And I think you only

1117
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:47,206
kind of realize that when you get out

1118
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,640
because we're always
shooting on a sound stage.

1119
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:49,942
You don't really know

1120
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:51,443
how other people are
reacting to the show,

1121
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:52,811
and you really notice
that when you travel

1122
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,613
and you go abroad and you realize

1123
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:56,014
that it's really globally successful.

1124
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:57,282
- I's crazy.
- Yeah.

1125
00:38:57,284 --> 00:38:58,984
- Wow.
- And they're so into it.

1126
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,686
They're little investigators
and, like, they know more...

1127
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:02,721
- Brazil. Brazil?
- About our show than we do.

1128
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:04,623
- When we went to Brazil?
- Oh, my gosh, yes.

1129
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,792
My favorite story about
Shay is, you know,

1130
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:08,460
this was very... this
was, like, season two.

1131
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:10,028
- Season two.
- We got off the plane

1132
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,730
and there were hundreds
of little girls there

1133
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:13,632
and I was like, "Oh,
my God, who is here?

1134
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:14,967
Like, someone really famous is here."

1135
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:16,401
both: We were so excited.

1136
00:39:16,403 --> 00:39:17,836
- Someone here is, like...
- And then we realized,

1137
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:19,471
oh, like, they were there to see us

1138
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:21,607
and I had never experienced that.

1139
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,874
I still haven't experienced anything

1140
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:25,277
- like that since then, so.
- No, no.

1141
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,679
Both: Lucy, Shay, come down!

1142
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:29,948
That's... they would
yell that from the hotel.

1143
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,416
- Oh!
- It was funny.

1144
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:33,518
- That was a fun trip.
- That's so sweet, aw.

1145
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,855
Any memorable fan gifts that
you've gotten, or letters?

1146
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:39,024
- I think tattoos on bodies.
- Yes.

1147
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:40,892
I think there's a guy that
has all of our faces tattooed.

1148
00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:42,394
There's a guy that
has all of our faces.

1149
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:43,829
- Who we met.
- Yeah, who we met.

1150
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:45,664
I met in Germany and
he had my face first...

1151
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,165
- Yeah, I met him...
- And then slowly but surely.

1152
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,400
At a Beyoncé concert
and he has everybody's

1153
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:50,202
And he has all of our faces.

1154
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:51,870
- Yeah.
- That's some dedication.

1155
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:52,971
Yeah.

1156
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,172
I don't know who the artist was,

1157
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,540
but they actually are great.

1158
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:56,575
- They look pretty good.
- They did a good job?

1159
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:57,976
They did a really good job.

1160
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,745
Yeah, you wouldn't want your bad side

1161
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:01,013
- on this person's arm forever.
- No, right.

1162
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:02,614
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1163
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:03,849
They're just amazing,
they're really supportive.

1164
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:05,884
Well, because you fans are so special

1165
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:08,587
we wanted to give you one
last chance to say good-bye,

1166
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:12,524
so let's take a look
at our fan farewells.

1167
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:15,927
All: We're "Pretty Little
Liars" biggest fans!

1168
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:17,963
There's so much that I'm
gonna miss about the show.

1169
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:19,431
The girls' fashion,

1170
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,566
all the friendships, being
a little bit afraid

1171
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:23,035
every time I got a text message

1172
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:24,569
because what if it was from "A"?

1173
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:26,872
What we're gonna miss most
of all is live tweeting

1174
00:40:26,874 --> 00:40:29,508
with all the other "Pretty
Little Liars" fans.

1175
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,878
Thank you for seven years
of just pure enjoyment,

1176
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,315
and laughter, and hysterical crying.

1177
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:39,584
Emily's coming out was one
of my favorite storylines

1178
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:42,254
because it helped me deal
with my own struggles.

1179
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:44,523
How lucky am I to have a show

1180
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,092
that makes saying good-bye so hard?

1181
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:48,360
This is Anne from Mexico,

1182
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,861
and I have the most amazing memories

1183
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:52,097
from live-tweeting with the cast,

1184

1185
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:56,168
Through all seven seasons
there's never a dull moment.

1186
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,602
As dedicated fans,

1187
00:40:57,604 --> 00:40:59,071
we'll miss seeing you
all on the screens.

1188
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,539
I's so hard to make
something so special

1189
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,940
to so many people, but you did it,

1190
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:03,709
and it was awesome, so congratulations.

1191
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,244
Thank you to the cast and
crew of "Pretty Little Liars"

1219
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:08,073
This has been a great
night, and I'm sorry to say

1220
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:11,376
that the party and the
series really is over.

1221
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:13,044
I can't believe I'm saying that.

1222
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:15,147
Now it's time for all of us
to say good-bye to the show

1223
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:17,849
that has kept us guessing,
and gasping, and texting,

1224
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:21,153
and tweeting for seven
unforgettable seasons.

1225
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:23,555
From the cast and crew of
"Pretty Little Liars,"

1226
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:25,957
thanks for coming to our
"A-List Wrap Party,"

1227
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:28,460
and remember, two can keep a secret

1228
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,162
if one of them is dead.

1229
00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:31,396
Good night, everybody,

1230
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:33,965
