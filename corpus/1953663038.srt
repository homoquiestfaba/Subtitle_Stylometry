Oh, come with me.
Come with me. Are you ready?

173
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,880
-Almost.
-Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

174

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,840
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing. Nothing.

177
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,400
-I'm--Unh.

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,080
Are you with me?
I'm close. I'm close.

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,320
Unh! Oh! Oh, God!

182
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,240
-Ready?
-Now?

183
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,160
Now! Ohh!

184
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
Ohh.

Ohhhh!

Ohhhh!

Ohh.

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,680
[Sighs] Ahh.

192
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
What the fuck was that?

193
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,320
W-what?

194
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,560
-Did you come?
-Yeah.

195
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,320
No, you didn't. You faked it.

196
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,920
No, no, no. Guys don't fake it.
I don't even think that we can.

197
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
-You faked it.
-Hey.

198
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,920
Hey. Hey.

200
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
Let go!

201
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,840
-Show me.
-Show you what?

202
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,280
You know. The stuff.

203
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,520
This is ridiculous.

204
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,280
What are you hiding?

205
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,800
Nothing.
Just give me second, OK?

-What's going on?
-I need something.

210
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,400
Anything that looks
like semen. OK?

Something
that looks like semen?

-Hey, Duncan.

-Thanks a lot, man.
-What's up, Matt?

-What's up, man?
-Chris.

218
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,840
Heard you tried to leave one
in the chamber last night.

219
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,520
-Where'd you hear that?
-Internet.

220
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,280
It's all on the internet
nowadays, you know.

221
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,840
This is an internet company.

222
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,440
And Ryan has a big mouth, huh?

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,240
-Morning, ladies.
-Hmm.

224
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,320
So, you in on
the basketball pool or what?

225
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,520
What's the line
on that game anyway?

226
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,520
I'll talk to the bagel guy
when he gets here.

227
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,840
What does the bagel guy
have to do with this?

228
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,600
The bagel guy knows everything.
The dude's incredible.

229
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Then how come can't he get here
on time with the bagels?

230
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,320
-Appreciate it.
-Is that what I think it is?

231
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,520
-Don't worry.
-Can I see it?

{y:i}of those days, you know?

"MATT.: Yes, I do".

234
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,240
I got held up at this import-
export place in Chinatown.

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
Some party.

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,280
-Golden Spear?
-That's the one.

237
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,800
Their mimosas they make there
are strong.

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,680
Go straight to your head.
Blbbh.

239
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,520
I used to know someone
who worked there.

240
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,440
You know Tatiana?

241
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,080
Yeah, I know Tatiana.
She's nice.

242
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,360
No, she's not nice.
She's hot.

243
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I'd hit that.
And how about Merj?

244
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,880
Yeah, I know Merj.

245
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,280
And what about that really
hot chick that got engaged?

246
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,000
"That was funny".

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,400
What really hot chick
got engaged?

248
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,440
The expediter chick.
You know, real slinky.

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,640
-What's her name?
-Nicole?

250
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,840
Nicole. That's it.

Man, she knows the guy,
like, two weeks.

252
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,120
She goes to France,
she comes back, she's engaged.

253
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,400
Now, she is
spontaneous combustion hot.

-I would definitely hit that.

N-Nicole that got engaged?

00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,320

said at the party.

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
''Congratulations Nicole.''

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,120

"even Iook right at her".

those eclipse-watching things...

just to look directly at her,
she's so radiantly hot!

262
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,560
It makes me want to just
throw her down, you know...

263
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
and just--[Bang]
You know what I mean?

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,760
Yeah.

265
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm glad we can connect on that.

266
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,480
Later, pimp.

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,880
-Later.
-Rrr!

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,600
Matt?

270
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,560

[Horn honks]

272
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
-Unh!
-Oh! Oh!

273
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,800
-Oh, God. I am so sorry.
-It's OK. It's OK.

274
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,720
-Are you OK?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

275
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,000
Is there anything I can do
to make it better?

276
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,320
Um...

277
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,880
anything?

278
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,880
Again?
Another girl already?

279
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,960
-It's not even the weekend.
-I know, I know.

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
"She met someone".
"NicoIe's getting married".

281
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,960
I mean, what can I do?

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,440
-Tell me what I can do.
-I don't know what to tell you.

284
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,240
This isn't really a problem
I know much about.

285
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,880
Listen, isn't
part of the priestly thing...

286
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
giving relationship advice?

287
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,400
Relationship advice, yes.

288
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,480
Sex advice, no.

289
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,120
Part of the priestly thing,
and stop calling it that...

290
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,480
is not to have sex, remember?

291
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,880
It's funny.
I didn't say a thing about sex.

292
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,000
-Sure you did.
-No, I didn't.

293
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,840
I guess thinking about sex
is part of the priestly thing.

294
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,920
At least for some.

295
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,840
-Get out.
-Fine.

296
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,120
-Good morning, Matt.
-Morning, father.

297
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,840
What's with the purple banners?

298
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,560
Lent. Starts today.

299
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
Going to be a long forty days
this year.

300
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm giving up my one vice--

301
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,920
those precious little
madeleine cookies...

302
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,360
dipped in a starbucks mocha.

303
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,440
It's so hard giving up
what you love the most.

304
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,480
I've got it! Jesus Christ,
John, I've got an answer!

305
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,760
And the question is?

306
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,080
-Nicole.
-Again?

307
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,920
No sex for Lent--
for forty days.

308
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,880
If I can do that,
then everything will be OK.

309
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,080
That isn't what Lent is.

310
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,200
Lent is about sacrifice
and growth through self-denial.

311
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,320
Lent is to remember--

312
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,200
How Christ felt
during the fast in the desert.

313
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
I grew up in the same house
as you, moron.

314
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,240
But when it comes down to it,
that's exactly what this is.

315
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,320
This is growth,
this is self-denial...

316
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,440
and this is sacrifice.

317
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,520
Dude!

318
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,240
It's not that simple, Matt.
Trust me.

319
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,400
It is that...

320
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,360
You're right.

321
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,600
You're totally right.

322
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,240
Sex alone is not enough.

323
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,640
It has to be sex
and all things sex-like.

324
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,600
You'll never be able to do that.

325
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,240
Just listen, here's the plan.

326
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,920
One--no sex.

327
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,640
Two--
no sexual intimacy of any kind.

328
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,000
No nibbling, no biting,
no scratching.

329
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,600
"No sucking, no fondIing".
"None of that".

330
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,280
"And three"...

331
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
no masturbation.

332
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,640
You won't last a week.

333
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,400
Oh, you're wrong, brother.

334
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,720
I'm gonna go the distance.

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,080

341

687
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,560

I should know about right now?

to regain the power
in my relationship.

See, I take the vow.

830
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,120
I tell her I'm gonna do without
for a few months.

831
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,480

going to be begging for it.

What do you think?

I think you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

get you in trouble around here.

-So go home.

855
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,600
what would you think about?

856
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,480
Sex.

857
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,040
[Laughs]

858
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,000
OK, so we're both sitting here
thinking about sex...

859
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,520
because
we can't think about sex...

860
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,960
{y:i}because
"we can't taIk about sex"...

861
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,880
and we certainly cannot
have sex.

862
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,280
It's like,
so what are we doing here?

863
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,880
You know, if I didn't have
this vow thing...

864
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,680
I'd kiss you right now.

865
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,200
[Both sigh]

866
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,920

868
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,800
You OK?

869
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,000
[Coughs] I'm fine.

870
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,440
-Are you sure?
-I'll be right back.

871
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,280
-Are you--
-Yeah.

872

881
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,520
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm OK. Thank you.

00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,680

-I'm OK.

883
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,360
Hi.

884
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,760
Nicole. How are you?

885
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,280
Well, better than you
at the moment.

886
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,760

-Yeah. Yeah.

887

David Brokaw. Hi.

891
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,240
I'm Matt. I'm Matt.

892
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,280
"Oh, yes. Yes, of course".

893
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,760
Matt, you work at one
of those dot coms, don't you?

894
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,720
Yes. Yes, I do.

895
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,880
David's the youngest
executive vice president...

896
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,800
at Morgan Stanley.

897
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,720
Yeah, well, I'm the youngest--

898
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,800
{y:i}Yeah, hey,
"It's aII good, Matt".

899
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,600
Listen, honey, you want
to give it one more try?

900
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,760
It's good to see you.

901
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,520
Yeah, you, too.

902
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,080
Bye.

903
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,160
She's the real reason
you took that vow.

904
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,600
[Sighs] No.
She's just an ex.

905
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,640
The vow is something
completely separate from her.

906
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,200
You're a really bad liar.

907
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,960
I get that a lot.

908
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,280
Look, I know I should've
told you about her.

909
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,440
Yeah, you should've.

910
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,240
But I guess it's hard for you
to get the truth out.

911
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,880
Shit.

912
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,000
Hey, how about I quit the vow?

913
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,960
I mean, honestly,
I don't care about the vow.

914
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,600
Oh, sure, now
St. Matt wants a piece.

915
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,120
-No, that's not it at all.
-You don't want me?

916
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,800
No, of course I want you.
It's just--

917
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,400
[Sighs]

918
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,800
I care about the vow, and--

919
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,360
-You do?
-Yeah, I do.

920
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,040
And her?

921
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,320
I don't know.

922
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,760
[Sighs]

923
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,360
I'll tell you what.
You want me?

924
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,840
Yeah.

925
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,880
Then finish your stupid vow.

926
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,000
And if you finish it...

927
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,600
then maybe we can talk
about being together. Maybe.

928
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,640
[Engine starts]

929
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,760
I've given up sex,
because I just...

930
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,520
I just want to connect
with people on a deeper level.

931
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,800
-Really?
-Yeah.

932
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,920
Is it working?

933
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,280
Working?
Of course it's working!

934
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,320
It's like this incredible high.
Can you not feel that?

935
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,760
Just sitting here
talking with you...

936
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,320
I'm mind orgasmic right now.

937
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,760
Mind orgasmic.

938
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,240
Yeah.

939
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,520
Hmm.

943
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,800
We need to talk.

944
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,080
I can't. I gotta go.

945
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,800
I--I understand
what you're doing, Matt.

946
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,400
-You do?
-Mm-hmm.

947
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,640
Women have been doing this
since, well, forever...

948
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,680
so we know all about the power.

949
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,920
See, us having the power,
that's part of the system...

950
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,480
and by you taking the power,
you're fucking with the system.

951
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,960
And I think you see why
we can't let that happen.

952
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,440
You bet on today.
This is about money.

953
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,360
Ah-ah. Signed and
notarized commitment...

954
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,320
to donate all proceeds
to charity.

955
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,400
So you want to have sex with me
to regain ''the power''?

956
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,600
We're willing to do
whatever is necessary...

957
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,120
to get the job done.

958
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,760
Why do you keep saying ''we''?

959
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,520
Oh, fuck.

960
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,240
Now, we think that this offer
is more than fair.

961
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,120
Can I talk to you for a second?

962
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,080
-Excuse me. What?
-I don't think I can do this.

963
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,000
Andie, we talked about this
already, OK?

964
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,520
I know, but just look at him.

965
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,960
I mean, he used to be
kind of cute...

966
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,480
but now he's just twitchy.

967
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,040
Shh. It'll be over
in, like, two seconds, OK?

968
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,440
Would you care to join us, hmm?

969

Oh, my God. I gotta go.

972
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,520
Yesterday was fine.

973
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,400
I mean, physically speaking,
I was fine.

974
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,040
But today...I'm not fine.

975
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,400
This morning
at the coffee shop...

976
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,920

I know this phase. It passes.

986
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,200
But why does this
have to happen now?

987
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,440
I mean, yesterday Erica tells
me I have to finish the vow...

988
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
and today I'm slammed by sex.
Why?

989
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,960
-Look, you've gone 26 days?
-Mm-hmm.

990
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,280
-That's very admirable.
-Yeah, thanks.

But you can't come
to mom and dad's tonight.

992
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,040
If I don't go, they'll kill me.

993
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,320
You don't want them
to see you like this.

994

I don't want me
to see me like this...

995
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,800
but if there's one place
I'm safe it's at home, right?

will it be like normal?

999

Yeah, pretty much.
I can golf, ride a bike.

1001

It's amazing
the things you can do now.

Oh, they don't want
to hear about that.

1006
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,920

to see what effect...

Why not talk about it? I think
a good sexual appetite...

1014
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,360
is a real, normal,
healthy part of being a man.

01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,360
Hi.

1200
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,920
I know
I shouldn't be here...

1201
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,920
but I've been thinking
about you a lot...

1202
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,640
and I had to see you.

1203
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,560
What are those,
like some kind of a bribe?

1204
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,840
More like...gentle persuasion.

1205
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,640
{y:i}ERICA.: Is this going to get
{y:i}worse before it gets better?

1206
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,360
Probably, but I got
to get this out...

1207
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,920
before I lose
my train of thought.

1208
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,360
See...

1209
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,400
Nicole had this...

1210
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,520
special status.

1211
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,640
More like a special power.

1212
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,960
And I couldn't match it...

1213
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,920
and I couldn't find anybody
to replace it.

1214
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,800
-I think I get it.
-You do?

1215
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,080
It's very easy to confuse
a physical attraction...

1216
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,760
with a real connection.

1217
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,880
Yeah.
Sometimes you just can't tell.

1218
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,680
Well, you can tell.

1219
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,720
You can tell by the kiss.

1220
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,960
You know, the other stuff--
the sex, ''Is he hot?''

1221
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,480
It doesn't matter.

1222
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,120
All that matters is the kiss.

1223
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,920
How do you know about me?

1224
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,560
I don't.

1225
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,040
{y:i}I don't even know
"If you can feeI that".

1226
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,400
I can feel that.

1227
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,640
Is this against the rules?

1228
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,840
I'll let you be
the judge of that.

1229
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,080
-I'm thinking now.
-I'm thinking now, too.

1230
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,240

Huh? Huh?

Mmm.

Good night, sweetie.

1259
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,360
Oh, no. Don't go to sleep yet,
because...

1260
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,640
we should talk about something.

-Mm-hmm.
-We could talk about anything.

we could talk about stickers.

From a flower?

Like, a vibrating flower?

1286

No. No, just a flower.

And he didn't touch you once?

He didn't even try
to touch you?

No, and I so wanted him to...

was so perfect.

too committed to it.

want to hurt your feelings.

on the other side, even hotter.

I set the whole thing up.

1544
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,400
I'll say that I handcuffed you
to the bed--which is true--

1545
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,080
that I sent her over here.

1546
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,680
She was here to see me.

1547
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,000
No.

1548
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,240
No? I'll tell her something
less idiotic, obviously, but...

1549
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,160
No.

1550
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,720
No more lies.

1551
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,240
This doesn't seem like
one of those...

1552
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,120
''truth will set you free''
situations.

1553
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,400
No, it doesn't.

1554
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,680
Hey.

1555
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,040
Guess who dropped by.

1556
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,640
He left hours ago.

1557
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,880
He brought you this.

1558
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,600
Personally,
I prefer the telegram...

1559
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,560
but I did get to talk to him
for a little bit.

1560
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,480
So?
I don't want to hear about it.

1561
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,360
-OK.
-But now you're on his side?

1562
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,200
Yeah, Erica.
He melted my heart.

1563
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,600
He's a real mess about you.
It was a little pathetic.

1564
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,760
That's not good enough.

1565
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,080
Don't be stupid, Erica.

1566
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,520
He's crazy about you.
What else do you want?

1567
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:40,200
// "She wouIdn't Iet me,"
"and I Iove her for that" //

1568
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,280
// "Ooh, oh" //

1569
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,920
// "And though" //

1570
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,960
// "You steaI her" //

1571
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,120
// "You Iove her"
"and deceive her" //

1572
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:03,160
// "She did nothing" //

1573
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,040
// "So wrong" //

1574
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:12,000
// "So wrong" //

1575
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,000
// "Oh" //

1576
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,120
Helps with static cling.

1577
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:39,440
// "And I Iove her for that" //

1578
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,400
[Sighs]

1579
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,120
Where's your laundry?

1580
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,840
I've been here
every day this week.

1581
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,920
All my laundry's clean.

1582
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,840
[Both laugh]

1583
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,320
I know I screwed up with you--

1584
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,720
over and over and over.

1585
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,600
It just took me a long time
to realize what I was doing.

1586
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,160
Yes, it did.

1587
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:13,480
I was trying to take a part
of me and make it go away.

1588
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:19,520
And I closed my world off, and
I put myself in a little box.

1589
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,920
And for a while,
everything seemed clear.

1590
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,000
But then you came along...

1591
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,800
and that didn't help anything.

1592
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,520
Remember when you said
that you could never tell...

1593
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,800
about someone
until you kiss them?

1594
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,080
Well...

1595
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:45,160
I screwed up.
I--I should've just done this.

1596
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,440
Are you done talking now?

1597
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,280
Thirty eight hours exactly.

1598
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,520
-Son of a bitch.
-Damn it.

1599
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,760
The pot's up to 140. Anybody
else want in on hour 39?

1600
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,520
"DUNCAN.: Hey, hey".

1601
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,840
{y:i}How do we even know that
{y:i}they're stiII even in there?

1602
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:35,520
They could've put the CD player
on repeat or shuffle.

1603
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,200
-That's a good point.
-It is a good point...

1604
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,720
because they could've
snuck out the back window...

1605
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,680
and we're still sitting around
here like a bunch of chimps.

1606
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,960
-Chimps.
-You know what? Look at me.

1607
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,680
I've been here the whole time.
Believe it.

1608
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,520
[Music stops]

1609
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,040
[Music playing]

1610
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,000
Oh, put me in for a tenner.

1611
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:05,640
He'll keep going.
Two dollars, please.

1612
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,760
[Door slams]

1613
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,200
-[Chattering stops]
-Uhh.

1614
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:21,200
-Hey, Matt.
-What's up, Matt?

1615
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,320
Hey, Matt.

1616
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,200
All right, you guys. Come on,
get out. Get out of my house.

1617
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,680
[All chattering]

1618
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,400
No, no. You know what?

1619
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,800
Come on, come on.
Get out of my house.

1620
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,160
I'll just take this.

1621
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,880
Bye.

1622
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,400
-Later, stud.
-See you later.

1623
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:37,000
Thanks for the fish, Matt.

1624
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,040
Looking good. How long
are you going to be in there?

1625
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,440
-Let's go.
-Hey, I'm going.

1626
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,280
Chris, I'm going to call you
tomorrow, all right?

1627
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,440
-What are you doing?
-You, too.

1628
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,360
-I don't have my keys on me.
-Good.

1629
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,760
Wait, this is my house, dude.

1630
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,560
Not for the next
twenty four hours, it's not.

1631
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,520
And you all should be
ashamed of yourselves.

1632
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,360
You're kidding.
Don't have sex on my bed.

1633
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,480
He can't last in there
another 24 hours. He'll die.

1634
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,560
How much you want to bet?

1635
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,240
How much do I want to bet
that he'll actually die?

1636
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,840
-I'll put ten bucks on it.
-Another ten.

1637
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,160
I don't have a life.
