<i> What is running through</i> <i> that brain of yours?</i>

560

What if the laws of physics applied to people as well?

561
00:25:58,783 --> 00:25:59,948
Action.

562
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,784
Equal and opposite reaction?

563
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:03,619
<i> I don't think</i>

564
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:07,639
<i> That's what newton meant.</i>

565
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:09,141
My aunt wants to send me to a boarding school.

566
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:10,717

567
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:11,885
<i> And just for the record,</i>

568
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:15,055
<i> I've heard that school</i> <i> is outstanding.</i>

569

Ivy leagues all across the country.

571
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,468
I'm aware.

572
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,203
I've read the brochure. Twice.

573
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,748
<i> Most girls in your shoes</i> <i> would be thrilled.</i>

574
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:28,234
Robert wants me out of the house.

575
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,545
<i> And why would he want that?</i>

576
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,923
<i> Did you behave in such a way</i>

577
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,651
<i> That might have precipitated</i> <i> his decision?</i>

578
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:38,095
<i> Did your action</i> <i> cause a reaction?</i>

579
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,156
Maybe.

580
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:45,327
<i> So you created a problem.</i>

581
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:49,832
<i>And what is the proper response</i> <i>to a problem of our own making?</i>

582
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,941
Solving it.

583
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:57,189
<i> And you are good</i> <i> at solving problems,</i>

584
00:26:57,341 --> 00:26:58,115
Aren't you?

00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:01,285
Yes.

586
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:02,620
I'm very good at solving problems.

00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,106
Thank you, dr. March.

I wanted to apologize...

594
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,966
Uncle robert...

595
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,318
I just wanted to apologize...

Hi.

597
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:46,312
Hey.

598
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:47,331
I thought you might be thirsty.

599
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:50,668
Can we talk?

600
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:55,822
Uncle robert...

601
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,007
I just wanted to apologize

602
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,569
For forgetting to give you back your knife.

603
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:02,012
I found it next to all the pool equipment

604
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:05,349
And it just slipped my mind to give it back to you, so...

605
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,351
I'm sorry.

606
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,520
Thank you.

607
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:12,247
You know,

608

Change is hard for everyone.

[emma] mm-hmm.

610
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:19,679
For me...

611
00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:21,273
After my dad, you know,

612
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:23,942
It's just...

613
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:25,185
I guess, sometimes, something gets in my head...

614
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,704
And...

615
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:28,947
Maybe I'll do something I shouldn't have.

616
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,450
I understand.

617
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:33,860
Maybe this is good for us, huh?

618
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:35,528
Maybe we could start over.

619
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,714
Yeah.

620
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,549
And who knows,

621
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:39,791
Maybe st. Crispin's will be good for me.

622
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:40,718
Really?

623
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:44,129
Yeah. 90% of their grads go ivy.

624
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,222
I want to go ivy,

625
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:47,057
So I'd say those are pretty good odds.

626
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,469
Yeah.

627
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,637
Besides, you're doing what's best for your family

628
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:53,897

No, steph's is right around the corner.

I still don't see why you guys had to invite her.

Because she's your friend.

I've been dancing with you girls for the past couple years now,

932
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:39,674
And I just feel like we have so much fun together.

933
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:41,008
I just really want to make sure

934
00:43:41,027 --> 00:43:43,344
That we make good memories together,

935
00:43:43,363 --> 00:43:44,454
Because I want to be able to look back on them

936
00:43:44,605 --> 00:43:48,107
When we're all old and gray, I guess,

937
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,684
And be able to say...

938
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:52,128
"damn, dance team was really sick."

939
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:54,964
And I just...

940
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,426
You know...

941
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:01,954
Like I said,

942
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,214
I just really want

943
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:05,383
To keep on making great memories with you guys.

944
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:06,625
I love you all,

945
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:07,885
And...

946
00:44:08,037 --> 00:44:09,812
I don't know, I guess that's my "speech".

947
00:44:11,298 --> 00:44:12,798
Please vote for me as dance captain.

948
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,299
If you don't, no hard feelings,

949
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,226

950
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,544

957

I just have to sort out this room for him.

958
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:39,750
Because of his wheelchair.

959
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,010
That's great.

960
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,681
And you have an interview with st. Crispin's this weekend.

961
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:47,258

962

963
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:50,520
Mm-hmm. I can't wait.

964

966
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,341

967
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,485
I am so happy for her.

968
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,863
Emma, do you want to talk about it?

969
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:02,606
No. No, I don't.

970
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,515
Sorry. Excuse me.

The medicine cabinet

982

Must remain locked at all times.

983
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:13,661
Okay.

984
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,513
Take one key and keep it on your person,

985

Always,

Come in, princesa. Don't be shy.

It's nice to have you back inside the house.

1004

Yeah, the point is to get you weened off,

1010
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:01,133
Not get you hooked.

1011
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,301
Right.

1012
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,653
Can you tell that to my hips and my legs?

1013
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,229
Robert--

1014
00:47:05,381 --> 00:47:06,280
I'm fine.

What?

1026
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:45,177
Nothing.

1027
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,863
I, um...

1028
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:50,107
I brought you this.

1029
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:51,868
That way, you can always feel close to him.

1030
00:47:54,113 --> 00:47:55,538
That's very thoughtful, emma. Thank you.

1031
