1
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,671
Good.
Do you want to know how to win?

2
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,035
Be the only one with a sword.

3
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,511
Easy.

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,878
Give him a hand! He fought well!

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,468
Well done. John.

6
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,036
Winner takes all, my friends!
One more challenger and I'll leave.

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,117
Once in a lifetime, you meet a man
so fearless. No man can touch him.

8
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,151
While you're waiting for him,
you can practice on me.

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,553
As sure as the sun will rise.
There's a man who's better than me.

10
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,189
He could be here. It could be today.

11
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,430
Yeah!

12
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,671
It could be you.

13
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,676
- He looks strong. Is he good?
- Try him and see!

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,714
Go on. Mark. But don't hurt him.

15
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,717
So, you're Mark, are you?
I'm Lancelot.

16
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,719
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

17
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,871
You don't have to kill me to win.

18
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,316
- Got tight hold of your sword?
- Don't you worry about that!

19
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,635
Can I give you some advice?
Don't drop your sword.

20
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,350
Is this your sword?
Give him a hand!

21
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,719
- Well done. Mark!
- How did you do that?

22
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,998
- Was that a trick?
- No. That's the way I fight.

23
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,233
Could I do it?
Tell me. I can learn.

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,993
Study your opponent, so you know
what he'll do before he does it.

25
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:08,350
- I can do that.
- And wait for the critical moment.

26
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,995
- I can do that.
- You can't care about your life.

27
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
Come on! Quickly!

28
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,072
Shut the doors!

29
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
Where's Daddy?

30
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,550
Burn it down.

31
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,710
We'll be burnt alive!

32
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,872
We need water! Get water!

33
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,996
- No! Wait till they've gone!
- We'll be dead by then!

34
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,393
Malagant.

35
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,233
Last night, men from this village
killed three of my people.

36
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,109
In reprisal,
I have destroyed your village.

37
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,750
The borderlands have been lawless
long enough.

38
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,471
Know now. That I am the law!

39
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,439
Come on!

40
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,236
There she is.

41
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,270
Mind the dog!

42
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,798
- Come here, milady.
- Wait.

43
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,317
- Milady...
- I won't be much longer.

44
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,634
There's been another attack.
Another border village burnt.

45
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,917
Anne, take my place.

46
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,953
- Is it Malagant again?
- Yes. A small group got away.

47
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,636
- Are they being looked after?
- They want to see you first.

48
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,795
No, no, please. You poor people,
after such a terrible journey.

49
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,590
We didn't know
where else to turn, milady.

50
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,958
They say we're outlaws.
They say we crossed the border.

51
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,240
I know. It's all lies. He means
to frighten us into submission.

52
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,669
- Don't give in to him. We'll fight.
- I'm not the yielding kind.

53
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,834
Jacob. Take these good people in
and give them food and drink.

54
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,028
When you've rested, we shall pray
for your village and for Leonesse.

55
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,318
- God keep you safe, milady.
- And you. Now, go.

56
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,753
- It's the third village he's burnt.
- Does he want to destroy us all?

57
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,756
- He wants us to sign his treaty.
- He thinks we won't challenge him.

58
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,270
If he doesn't get what he asks,
he has the power to take it.

59
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,711
Oswald...
You say nothing.

60
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,113
- You know what I think. Child.
- Yes, I suppose I do.

61
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,389
- Prince Malagant must be answered.
- He will be. I shall decide today.

62
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,950
Now leave me.
Oswald, stay.

63
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,915
- I had hoped to have more time.
- Don't you know your own heart?

64
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,197
I know what I want.
I want to marry.

65
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,875
I want to live and die in Leonesse.

66
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,794
But I can't have everything I want,
can I?

67
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,830
Forgive me, but an offer of marriage
from Arthur of Camelot...

68
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,993
Yes. I know.
You're right, of course.

69
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,473
No more words. Let it be done.

70
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,634
- You accept the offer?
- I shall marry Arthur of Camelot.

71
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,954
I was so proud to hold you
in my arms at your birth.

72
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,477
I shall be prouder still
to see you wed.

73
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,590
Poor Arthur. The only dowry
I bring him is a land in danger.

74
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,998
- But I shall love him. Oswald.
- You should. Child.

75
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,796
I could never marry a man
without love.

76
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,635
Arthur wears his power so lightly.

77
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,190
He has such gentleness in his eyes.

78
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,750
I've never known anyone like him.

79
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,390
How could I love anyone more?

80
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,716
Halt!

81
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,188
It could be an ambush.
Look to the trees!

82
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,558
Protect the carriage!

83
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,828
Don't break the line.

84
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,038
Wait! Wait!

85
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,517
Now!

86
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,837
Follow! Follow!

87
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,672
It's all right.

88
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,872
They're going.

89
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,514
Wait!

90
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,594
Watch your flank!

91
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,999
We've got to jump!
Come on. Elise!

92
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,672
Roll when you hit the ground!

93
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,554
Petronella. Come on!

94
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,553
You have to!

95
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,473
Hurry!

96
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,110
Save yourself!
It's me they'll follow!

97
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,557
She must have gone to ground.

98
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,111
She can't be far.

99
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,194
There!

100
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,590
Don't move.

101
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,837
- Who are you?
- Who cares?

102
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,229
Kill him!

103
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,796
- What is it?
- There were three.

104
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,472
Don't even breathe.
You... drop the sword.

105
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,197
- Can I have her when you're done?
- You were after the woman?

106
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,036
Of course. Have you ever seen
anything so beautiful?

107
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,513
- I don't know about that.
- You don't want her?

108
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,708
Her soft skin, sweet lips...
young, firm body.

109
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,590
- I have my orders.
- Who's to know?

110
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,197
- I should take her back.
- I'll hold her for you.

111
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,273
- It won't take long.
- I don't want any trouble.

112
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,911
This one's no trouble.
Look at her. She wants it.

113
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,868
- What's she doing?
- See for yourself. Turn her around.

114
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,079
Look into her eyes.
See what she's got for you.

115
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,232
Hello, pretty.

116
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,037
Now... what have you got for me?

117
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,830
Come on.

118
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,230
Come on.

119
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,392
Let's go.

120
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,994
Why did you risk your life for me?
They could have killed you.

121
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,152
I'm not that easy to kill.

122
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,149
Do you know who I am?
Guinevere. I'm the Lady of Leonesse.

123
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:34,192
Well? Doesn't it please you to know
you saved the life of a lady?

124
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,992
- I'd be happy to save a dairy maid.
- She couldn't reward you.

125
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,919
If she were as pretty as you,
she could.

126
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,390
- What did I do?
- You insulted me.

127
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,630
Now I've insulted you.

128
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,828
How dare you treat me like this?

129
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,560
I take it you know no better.

130
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,669
You have done me a good service
and I shall forget the matter.

131
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,311
- Which way?
- I've never been here before.

132
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,749
- How do you know where the road is?
- I'm guessing.

133
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,310
See the scavenger birds?

134
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,600
They're looking for small animals
crushed by the passing wagons.

135
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,749
- About this reward...
- My man will pay you.

136
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,710
- I don't want money.
- I'm on my way to be married.

137
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,237
Then you're not married yet.
You're free.

138
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,552
- I've given my word.
- I don't want your word.

139
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,998
- I want you.
- I'm not to be had for the wanting.

140
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,150
Why not? If you want me.

141
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,475
- You may impress servant girls...
- I can tell when a woman wants me.

142
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,350
- I can see it in her eyes.
- Not in my eyes.

143
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,237
- You're afraid, aren't you?
- I have nothing to hide.

144
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,278
Then look at me.

145
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,918
If there is any honour in you,
promise me never to do that again.

146
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,036
I don't know about honour.

147
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,757
But I promise you... I won't
kiss you again until you ask me to.

148
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,071
And that I never will.

149
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,913
- When do you get married?
- On Midsummer's Day.

150
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,358
Before Midsummer's Day dawns,
you'll ask me to kiss you again.

151
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,640
- You insult me. Then abandon me?
- That's the road ahead.

152
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,350
And that, I presume,
is your brave escort.

153
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,678
- My child... Thank the Lord.
- Are my ladies safe?

154
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,470
- Were you followed, milady?
- No.

155
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,632
No. There's no one there.

156
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,955
Your new country awaits you.

157
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,039
- If anything should happen...
- I'll send word. Never fear.

158
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,513
Send Jacob. I want to know at once.
Good news or bad. Promise me.

159
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,400
I promise you.

160
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,355
I promise you.

161
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,472
Lady Guinevere of Leonesse.
Welcome to Camelot.

162
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,593
God be praised, you're safe.
Nothing shall ever harm you again.

163
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,116
My Lord honours me
with his kindness.

164
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,798
Your coming brings me a happiness
I had not dared hope for.

165
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,829
My Lord must not think too highly
of me, lest he'll be disappointed.

166
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,314
Then I'll take you as I find you,
if you'll do as much for me.

167
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,716
Leonesse awaits news of your safety.
John will send any message you want.

168
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,190
My Lord grants my wishes
before I speak them.

169
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,995
Tell my people I'm come safe
into my new country.

170
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,950
Tell them you saw my eyes
filled with tears of joy.

171
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,510
Already a queen.

172
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,759
- Agravaine, what happened?
- Ambush. Sire.

173
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,196
- Malagant?
- It has to be.

174
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,831
- Was Lady Guinevere in danger?
- We were all in danger, sire.

175
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,992
There were two separate forces.

176
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:27,198
- Lady Guinevere was in danger.
- You weren't prepared for them?

177
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,397
So many fell in the first strike.

178
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,597
How could we guess
they had a second force?

179
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,595
Malagant doesn't care how many men
he loses, so long as he wins.

180
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,313
- I'll not fail you again, sire.
- We both know no one is perfect.

181
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,156
- But I need to know everything.
- Sire.

182
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,078
Come.

183
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,438
I first climbed this hill as a boy
and saw what was to become my city.

184
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,670
I named it Camelot.

185
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,235
- It's so beautiful it frightens me.
- Why do you say that?

186
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,949
I was brought up
to set no faith in finery.

187
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,112
"Beauty doesn't last",
my father said.

188
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,034
I remember the way he looked at you.
I remember him saying, -

189
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,239
- "Do all fathers think
their daughters are so beautiful?"

190
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,154
He never said that to me.

191
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,351
Camelot.

192
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,469
Good girl...

193
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,679
Thank you!

194
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,914
You saved me from a long ride.
God knows when she'd have stopped.

195
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,438
- She's a fine animal.
- Fit for a queen.

196
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,428
- I'm Peter. King's stableman.
- Lancelot. Which king?

197
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:26,869
The King. Arthur of Camelot.
This beauty is a gift for his bride.

198
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,149
People swore he would never marry,
but I knew better.

199
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,838
He was just waiting
for the right one. Like we all do.

200
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:50,356
There'll be some feasting today!
Come on! The party's started!

201
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,435
Beat the gauntlet and meet the King!
Who's got the heart of a lion?

202
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,797
Be the first
to get through the gauntlet, -

203
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,033
- and you'll be up there drinking,
as if he's your brother!

204
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,955
Get up here! Get padded up
and beat the gauntlet!

205
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,510
What about you boys out there?

206
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,478
Give your support
to this brave, young man!

207
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,913
Beat the gauntlet
and meet our lovely queen!

208
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,959
Will you give the victor a kiss,
milady?

209
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,114
Howw's that? Beat the gauntlet and
win a kiss from Lady Guinevere, -

210
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,239
- soon to be our lovely queen!

211
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,756
Who will it be?

212
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,113
Not like that. Idiot!
Come and get padded up first!

213
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,232
Get down! You're mad!
You'll kill yourself!

214
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,596
Go on!

215
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,192
Yes!

216
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,911
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

217
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,756
- Extraordinary. What's your name?
- Lancelot.

218
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,515
Lancelot.
We won't forget that name.

219
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,154
Your prize...

220
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,794
- Ask me.
- No.

221
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,198
Ask me.

222
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,392
Never.

223
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,592
I dare not kiss so lovely a lady.
I only have one heart to lose.

224
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,590
Come.

225
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,718
Well done.

226
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,072
- Have you run the gauntlet before?
- No. Never.

227
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,792
- How did you do it?
- You have to see the danger coming.

228
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,080
Others have found it very hard.
You're the first one to do it.

229
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,672
Perhaps fear made them go back
instead of forward.

230
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,030
- And you felt no fear?
- No. I have nothing to lose.

231
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,399
No home... family?
Do you have a profession?

232
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,352
- I live by my sword.
- You fight for pay.

233
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,593
Nobody paid you to run the gauntlet.

234
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,150
I knew I could do it. So I did it.

235
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,352
Well. Lancelot...
you're an unusual man.

236
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,116
I've never seen such a display of
courage, skill, -

237
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,909
- nerve, grace and... stupidity.

238
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,314
Come.

239
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,711
Here, every life is precious,
even the lives of strangers.

240
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,000
If you must die, die serving
something greater than yourself.

241
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:20,075
Better still.
Live... and serve.

242
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,477
- The Round Table.
- Yes.

243
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,519
The High Council meets here.

244
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:36,395
No head. No foot.
Everyone equal... even the King.

245
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,869
"In serving each other,
we become free."

246
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,589
That is the very heart of Camelot.

247
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,435
Not these stones. Timbers.
Towers, palaces.

248
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,673
Burn them all...
and Camelot lives on.

249
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,960
Because it lives in us.
It's a belief we hold in our hearts.

250
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,796
Well. No matter.

251
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,238
- Stay in Camelot. I invite you.
- I'll be on the road again soon.

252
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,518
- What road?
- Wherever chance takes me.

253
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,071
Do you believe that what you do
is a matter of chance?

254
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,517
- Yes.
- In that hallway are two doors.

255
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,235
- How will you choose between them?
- It won't matter. It's all chance.

256
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,997
I hope chance leads you to the left.
It's the only way out.

257
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,430
Lancelot!
Just a thought...

258
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,798
A man who fears nothing
is a man who loves nothing.

259
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,317
And if you love nothing,
what joy is there in your life?

260
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,075
I may be wrong.

261
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,917
Peter!
Show us how she goes.

262
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,077
- She's yours.
- She's beautiful.

263
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,153
Peter thinks
she's not suitable for a lady.

264
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,154
- I would have chosen her myself.
- I know.

265
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:04,873
- How do you know?
- Remember when you joined our hunt?

266
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,795
- You were fearless.
- My father's word was "reckless".

267
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,270
He was always sparing with praise.

268
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,713
Come.

269
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,795
- We could almost be alone here.
- Do you have secrets to tell me?

270
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,830
No. No secrets.
Just a question to ask.

271
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,356
Do you want to marry me?

272
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,640
You don't have to marry me
because your father wanted it.

273
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,590
Camelot will protect Leonesse,
whether you marry me or not.

274
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,116
Thank you.

275
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,037
You don't know what it means to me
to hear you say that.

276
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,350
Do you want to be released
from the engagement?

277
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,550
No. I want to marry you.

278
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:15,159
Not your crown or your army
or your golden city. Just you.

279
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:20,269
- Just me?
- Yes. If you love me.

280
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,800
- Do you remember this?
- You hurt it in the hunt.

281
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,798
- I didn't think you'd get a scar.
- Just a scratch.

282
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,674
You wiped the blood away
with a sleeve of your dress.

283
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,549
The sleeve still carries the stain.

284
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,398
I never thought until then how sweet
it must be to be loved by one woman.

285
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,873
And for the first time in my life,
I wanted...

286
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:09,268
- What?
- What wise men say doesn't last.

287
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,310
What cannot be promised, or made
to linger any more than sunlight.

288
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,999
But I don't want to die. Without
having felt its warmth on my face.

289
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,111
Marry the King, Guinevere,
but love the man.

290
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,470
I only know one way to love.

291
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,589
And that is body... and heart...
and soul.

292
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,876
I kiss the hurt
that brought me your love.

293
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,072
Try her.

294
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,920
- Shall I fetch a lady's saddle?
- No need.

295
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,831
- She's a rare beauty, sire.
- Yes. She is.

296
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,992
So is the mare.

297
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,357
May God grant us the wisdom
to discover the right, -

298
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,469
- and the strength
to make it endure.

299
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,835
As you all know,
I am soon to be married.

300
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,833
- And about time. Too.
- Hear!

301
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,030
We have had our share of war.
Now, I look forward to quieter days.

302
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,954
But first, admit our guest.

303
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,235
- Malagant...
- Malagant is here at my invitation.

304
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,235
May I congratulate the King
on his forthcoming marriage.

305
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,796
I see my place
hasn't been taken yet.

306
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,712
- I was first among your knights.
- You left of your own free will.

307
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,873
We each of us
must follow our own road.

308
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:17,160
Where does your road take you?
To Leonesse?

309
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:24,032
Leonesse is my neighbour. I offered
the lady a treaty of friendship.

310
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,716
- Is burning villages friendship?
- Yes, My Lady...

311
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,115
Your land is becoming lawless.
Were you not just attacked?

312
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,319
- You know who attacked me.
- I made it my business to know.

313
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,271
- Justice has been done.
- You know no law above yourself!

314
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,958
"Armed forces to be given access
to all Leonesse."

315
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:57,753
"Troops to assist in the enforcement
of law... in all Leonesse."

316
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,198
- Do you want to sign this?
- I'll never sign it.

317
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:07,912
She's very brave...
now she's to be married.

318
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,873
- Will Camelot protect Leonesse?
- Is Leonesse in need of protection?

319
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:20,954
Come. Arthur.
I'm here to settle this business.

320
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,557
Leonesse is too weak to stand alone.
Let's say half each.

321
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,714
The lesser gives way to the greater.
What nation is greater than Camelot?

322
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,758
The land of justice.

323
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,552
Come... your hand on it.
We'II all live together as friends.

324
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,713
You offer me
what isn't yours to give.

325
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:52,078
You all know me.
You know I'm a man of my word.

326
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,312
Don't make an enemy of me.

327
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:02,033
- I mean no harm to Camelot.
- You know the law we live by.

328
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,352
Where is it written.
Beyond Camelot live lesser people?

329
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,229
People too weak
to protect themselves, let them die?

330
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,839
Other people live by other laws.
Or does your law rule the world?

331
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,232
There are laws that enslave men.
And laws that set them free.

332
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,949
Either what we hold to be right
and good and true -

333
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,399
- is right and good and true
for all mankind under God. - 

334
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,472
- or we're just a robber tribe.

335
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,108
Your words are talking you
out of peace and into war.

336
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,397
There's a peace you only find
after war.

337
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,599
If that battle must come.
I will fight it!

338
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,036
- And I!
- And I!

339
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,952
The great Arthur...
and his great dream.

340
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,876
No dream lasts forever.

341
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,431
- What is the status of the army?
- Four battalions. Two in reserve.

342
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,276
- I'll double the watch.
- I don't think Malagant wants war.

343
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,149
Arm the reserves.
He wants war.

344
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,394
- He wants Leonesse as a buffer.
- He wants Camelot.

345
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:27,111
- How soon could he attack?
- His army is five days' march away.

346
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,990
So much for my quieter days.

347
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,396
Who approaches there?

348
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,314
I come with a message
for Lady Guinevere!

349
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,550
Enter.

350
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,076
- My Lady, it's Jacob.
- Where?

351
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,677
- Coming to the north gate.
- Leonesse...
