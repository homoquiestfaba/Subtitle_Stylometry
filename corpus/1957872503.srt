553
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,718

554
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,492

So I had to stop the game cause technically,

582
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,155

00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:17,969
- Cedrick!

897
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,203
- Hi!

898
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,339
What's up Ro? You join the nation?

899
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,675
- Sho enough my brother, the most positive move

900
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,843
I have ever made in my life.

901
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,278
Looky here.

902
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,315
I want to give you your props on the shindig that you

903
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,618
have put together today my brother.

904
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,889
Black folk coming together united, it's beautiful!

905
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,691
- Thanks man.

906
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,826
- My only concern is the menu.

907
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,996
Say it isn't so that you're serving barbecued pork ribs.

908
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:49,801
Don't you know pork is like a drug killing the black man?

909
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:54,405
Heart attacks, high blood pressure, impulse tense,

910
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,074
pre-ejaculation,

911
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,675
car jacking,

912
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,710
gang violence

913
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,346
black on black crime.

914
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,982
All a result of eating pork.

915
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,018
So Cedrick, are you gonna contribute to

916
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,754
the conspiracy by the white man

917
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:13,591
to bring down the black man by serving this

918
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,960
shit the blue-eyed-devil call pork?

919
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,196
- Yeah, well actually I was

920
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,764
just in charge of inviting the peoples.

921
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,299
Now Geeter, he's in charge of the menu.

922
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,669
He's the chef today, so you might wanna holler at him.

923
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,137
And you know,

924
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:30,508
he's right over there at the barbecue grill brother Shabazz.

If you are eating pork, you must stop it.

1113
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,151
It's not what it looks like.

1114
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,153
- Do it look like I'm boo boo the fool?

1115
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,554
- Look, nothing happened.

1116
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,256
- That's why Shea ain't got no clothes on?

1117
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,959
And it smells like ass all up and down this hallway.

1118
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,827

1128
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,146

1129
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,748
