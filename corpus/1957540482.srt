00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:31,378
That's two.

183
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:32,446
But, Dad, if he's
more jacked than me-

184
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,548
- That's three.

185
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,215
Rakowski's gonna give him
the mascot gig for sure.

186
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,283
Four.

187
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,285
Stop him, Dad.

188
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,119
Five.

189
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,890
[tense music]

190
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,827
Boom, Brody's so lit!

191
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,229
- All right, all right.
- Shut up.

192
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:51,165
[Brody shouts]

193
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,299
Miller.

194
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,901
[student speaks indistinctly]

195
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,337
Does anyone actually know
what's in Rakowski's mug?

196
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:58,673
Whisky.

197
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,275
[Rakowski speaks indistinctly]

198
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,043
[Rakowski] French.

199
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,945
Don't fail me
now, testosterone.

200
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,215
Go wreck 'em, Frenchy boy.

201
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,985
[expectant music]

202
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,954
[French grunts]

203
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,989
[Student] Whisky, really?

204
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,293
Brody said he saw eight
bottles in her desk drawer.

205
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,995
Then he invited me
to his hot tub again.

206
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,263
Eight bottles?

207
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,999
We gotta raid,
like this weekend.

208
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,268
Yeah, can't.

209
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:31,038
[French] I can
do it, I can do it.

210
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,206
I can do it!

211
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,474
Why can't you?

212
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:36,210
Because once Cathy
sees my calculus test,

213
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:39,279
she's gonna nail my labia
to the dining room floor.

214
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,715
I can do it!

215
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:43,450
No, I can't. [pants]

216
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:46,721
Hey, when I was your age,
I could do 15 of those,

217
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,790
and I had carpal
tunnel in both wrists.

218
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:49,591
Get up.

219
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,794
[French] I can't, I can't.

220
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:55,996
[light music]

221
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,231
[Brody] Boo!

222
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,434
[clay thumps]

223
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,703
[pulsing synth music]

224
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,170
Jane, you almost
got a pull-up.

225
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,005
What's your secret sauce?

226
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,040
God, the wifi
here is such shit.

227
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,210
Well, it's all about leverage,
as well as strength, right?

228
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:13,347
It's not about bis and tris?

229
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,186
Okay, so your latissimus
dorsi, your lats,

230
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,220
they're actually-

231
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,856
- Have you blown Aunspach?

232
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,091
What?

233
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,495
She hasn't blown him.

234
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:30,899
Maybe you should.

235
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,133
Take the edge off
him and make him

236
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,870
less of a walking human penis.

237
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,306
What?

238
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,242
[clay thumps]

239
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,277
[French] Geez, dude.

240
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:44,913
[brain squishes]

241
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,413
Kinda cuts like chicken.

242
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,282
[Merritt] Ew!

243
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,283
Nice!

244
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,351
[Merritt] Oh my god!

245
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,987
Since when do you
care about your grades?

246
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,925
Since I need a 3.0
to stay on the team.

247
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,460
Oh, the team, the team.

248
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,062
Don't act like you
don't care, pinko.

249
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,832
Douche-box's work is
beyond college level,

250
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:06,300
but now we have to do
it because she can.

251
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:09,804
Erik's right, this is bullshit.

252
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:13,073
Shipley, I swear to
God, if I can't play

253
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,275
next Friday because of math,

254
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,045
I will microwave
your TV dinner ass.

255
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,583
Ew!

256
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:24,251
[ticking music]

257
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:30,224
I really didn't study
or do the reading.

258
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,292
[ticking music]

259
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,327
I swear.

260
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,196
It's fine, no one
should give a shit,

261
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,398
so can we stop
talking about school,

262
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,803
and put our considerable
free-thinking brains to good use?

263
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,171
Like raiding Rakowski's
whisky stash.

264
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,807
Rakowski's got a whisky stash?

265
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,407
Son, Father will provide.

266
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,845
Thanks, Pops.

267
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,413
So raid on Friday night
before Brody gets here first?

268
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,281
Yeah, I'm down.

269
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,519
Well, what about
the new cameras?

270
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,020
[Student] What new cameras?

271
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,191
[fluttering music]

272
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,092
Those fascists.

273
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,695
It doesn't matter,
we'll get around them.

274
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,329
Friday night it is.

275
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,532
[Merritt] Ellis, do you recall

276
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:12,499
what Cathy said
about my genitals?

277
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,234
[Ellis] Okay, so sneak out.

278
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,870
The athletic wing will be open.

279
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,071
It's Nadia's home game.

280
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,541
[Nadia] If I play.

281
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:21,776
Hey, Hoover, why'd you
fuck me at practice

282
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,477
- the other day?
- Where is she going?

283
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:25,178
[French] Oh, this
is gonna be good.

284
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,714
I can't even.

285
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,883
How are we gonna get
around the security cameras

286
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,450
on every single corner?

287
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,953
Wow, that was violent.

288
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,254
You can hack them.

289
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,157
You can?

290
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,425
Is no one else seeing this?

291
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,129
Well, I only know
the theory, but, yeah.

292
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,397
[Nadia and student grunting]

293
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,566
Damn.

294
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,968
Coach should probably
be seeing this.

295
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,069
Cool, awesome, we'll do it.

296
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,404
[Nadia and student grunting]

297
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,506
She might kill her, guys.

298
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,107
Nadi, for shit's
sake, put her down.

299
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:54,909
[student whimpering]

300
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,877
Raid!

301
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,678
[student whimpering]

302
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:57,512
[Merritt] Nadi.

303
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:58,278
[camera clicks]

304
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,547
Nadi, just get off her.

305
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,956
[Jane sighs]

306
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,724
[bell rings]

307
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:14,762
[students chatter]
[soft music]

308
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,397
[PA Announcer]
Attention, students,

309
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,199
as a reminder, flight
school and drama club

310
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,703
are canceled this afternoon
for the installation

311
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:24,505
of polycore security windows.

312
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,508
Also, please, be aware
that the new security gate

313
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:29,677
will be activated in 20 minutes.

314
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,881
[slow, pulsing music]

315
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:44,458
Hello?

316
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:49,229
[clock ticks]

317
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,958
[Jane chuckles]

318
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:19,527
[Aunspach] Hi.

319
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,630
- Hi.
- Jane, good to see ya.

320
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:26,534
[door clicks]

321
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,907
So I wanted to ask
you about that retake.

322
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:36,511
[blinds buzz]

323
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,249
[friends chatter]

324
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,418
[Aunspach sighs]

325
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,820
Look, Mr. Aunspach.

326
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,690
[friends chatter]

327
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,628
Mr. Aunspach, did you hear me?

328
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:56,396
You ever feel like you're
living in the wrong time?

329
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,667
Like someone mixed up
when you were born?

330
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,870
[Jane] Um-

331
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:06,206
- I always thought I should
be on the great frontier,

332
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,777
back when the railroads
were being built,

333
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:13,581
when there were new
towns, cities, sheriffs.

334
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:20,588
No plastics, no
screens, no wifi.

335
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:27,995
Like our mascot, Anvil Al,
working with his tools,

336
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,363
forging things of
substance, potential.

337
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:35,536
I mean, I always thought
he looked kind of silly,

338
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:40,541
you know, with all
that hair. [chuckles]

339
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,408
Number nine.

340
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:45,412
You got it wrong on your test.

341
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:49,584
Oh, yeah, I must've-

342
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:53,554
- It's odd to me because,
given your understanding

343
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:56,256
of the concepts, I don't
see why that 96 wasn't 100.

344
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,096
Well, there's been a lot
to study for the semester.

345
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:04,599
How long did you study?

346
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:08,736
Hours?

347
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,303
- I'm not sure.
- Not at all?

348
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,339
No, no, I did study, and-

349
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,808
- Don't lie.

350
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:15,810
I see how you are in my class.

351
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:18,613
You don't listen,
you don't take notes.

352
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,249
It's because of them, isn't it?

353
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,950
Because of what they'll think.

354
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:27,755
I thought I told you,
don't feel ashamed.

355
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:30,958
No, no, I'm not ashamed,

356
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:34,629
and I do listen, I
do take notes, I do.

357
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,430
Hey, wait.

358
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:40,635
Can you stop?

359
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:43,671
[pencils clatter]

360
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,245
[Aunspach sighs]

361
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,249
Okay, so I'm
already doing better

362
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:56,617
than everybody else here.

363
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:59,253
Better than who,
a bunch of morons?

364
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:02,590
There are two kinds
of people, Jane.

365
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:04,826
Fiddle people, hammer people.

366
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:07,327
Fiddle people, they can't
build, they can't make.

367
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,462
They play, they drive
their convertibles,

368
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:13,400
and then, after a while, summer
ends, and what happens then?

369
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,570
They take from
the hammer people,

370
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:17,238
the people that have been
working month after month,

371
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:18,673
who don't trash their gifts.

372
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:20,942
They use them to make things.

373
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:23,010
Fiddle people, hammer people,

374
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:26,647
and it's my job to make
you pick up the hammer.

375
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:29,784
But all I see is you hanging
out with the fiddlers,

376
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:32,987
trying to get them to like
you, and you know what?

377
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,989
It's not cute, Jane.

378
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:35,857
It's pathetic.

379
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,493
This, this is a waste.

380
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,865
They are a waste.

381
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:47,568
That, that is a gift.

382
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,705
Don't you dare throw it away.

383
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:53,341
[clock ticks]

384
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:58,212
[droning ambient music]

385
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,591
Okay.

386
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:18,599
[fast, fluttering music]

387
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,172
Fuck you!

388
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:30,211
[fast, fluttering music]
[Jane pants]

389
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:38,719
[fast, fluttering music]

390
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:49,764
[ticking music]

391
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:07,581
Hey, Merritt.

392
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:10,918
[fast, fluttering music]

393
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:17,258
[crow caws]

394
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,694
[birds tweet]

395
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,670
[bell rings]

396
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:39,914
[jagged, lush music]

397
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:57,331
Do you think he'll do something?

398
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:58,165
Sure.

399
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:04,972
Okay, but I really don't want

400
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,173
to make it a big deal, Merritt.

401
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:08,175
Really, really,
'cause I just wanna

402
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:10,478
tell what happened,
and maybe he'll talk

403
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,546
to him about it and that's
it, and then we can go, so.

404
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,381
Jane.

405
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:15,316
Chill your clit.

406
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:20,554
[Secretary] Ladies.

407
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:31,999
Mr. Lawson.

408
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:34,802
So, you approached him-

409
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:40,374
- Oh, no, no, no,
he approached me.

410
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:45,546
And he grabbed my backpack,
he took out my notebook,

411
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:47,214
and he get got really angry.

412
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:49,216
So he was angry
you had a notebook?

413
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:53,988
No, he was mad that the
notebook had drawings in it.

414
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:56,891
So your calculus notebook
was full of drawings?

415
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,728
That's not the point.

416
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:06,434
He got really close to me,
and he got really angry.

417
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,369
Angry you weren't
applying yourself.

418
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,871
Yeah, makes sense to me.

419
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:13,374
Sir, this isn't the first time

420
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:16,911
I felt really
uncomfortable around him,

421
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,880
but this time he did more.

422
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:23,851
He reached out at me and
grabbed me and shook me-

423
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:26,754
- Do you prefer to
always feel comfortable,

424
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:29,924
never be told how to
improve, how to get better?

425
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:33,394
That's not what I'm saying.

426
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:35,930
That's what a good
teacher does, Miss Shipley.

427
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:38,232
[Jane] I understand, but this-

428
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,800
- I don't like how
this is being handled.

429
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:45,272
I'm sorry?

430
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:46,874
And, more importantly,
I don't think

431
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:48,476
my father would, either.

432
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,281
Miss Sinclair-

433
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:57,051
- Mr. Lawson, the
school board's opinion

434
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,453
does matter to you, doesn't it?

435
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:01,922
How much do your wife's
medical bills run a month?

436
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:08,629
Let's try this again.

437
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:11,098
And this time, you'll
let Jane finish,

438
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,134
and, when she does, you'll think

439
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,035
very hard about that opinion

440
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:18,172
and exactly what you'll do
with your staff to preserve it.

441
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:28,349
[piercing, droning music]

442
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:30,585
Go on.

443
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:36,525
[piercing, droning music]
[clock ticks]

00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:38,759
[person knocks]

445
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,161
[Woman] Mr. Aunspach.

446
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:41,462
[piercing, droning music]

447
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:43,063

448
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:44,198
Mr. Aunspach.

[droning music]
[people cheering]

451
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:00,080
[Announcer] Wow, what
a nail-biter, folks.

452
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:01,448
[Spectators] Let's go, Anvils!

453
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:03,083
[Announcer] We're all tied up.

454
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:05,587
With only minutes left in
penalty for either team

455
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,721
to seal the deal.

456
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:09,356
Today's game has
been brought to you

457
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,993
by Paul's Polycore
Security Glass.

458
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:15,396
Here comes Paul
himself for a test.

459
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:18,032
[people cheer]

460
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:21,035
[hammer thunks]

461
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:23,037
Look, folks, not even
Anvil Al can break

462
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,372
the patented polycore pane.

463
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:27,841
Yeah, that's right,
Brody can't even break it!

464
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:28,776
Boo!

465
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,811
Brody sucks, Brody sucks!

466
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:33,180
[Announcer] Paul's
Polycore, protecting property,

467
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:34,616
protecting people.

468
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:35,983
Go, Nadia, woo!

469
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,987
I hate you, Brody, I hate you!

470
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,590
[Ellis] Hey, look
who's over there.

471
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:44,425
Hey, Miss Rakowski, you
picked the wrong mascot.

472
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,994
You made the biggest
mistake of your entire life!

473
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:48,162
Sure told her, didn't I, Dad?

474
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:49,664
[Ellis] I'm proud of you, son.

475
00:28:49,698 --> 00:28:51,131
[Announcer] And,
now, back to the field.

476
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:52,066
Let's go!

477
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:54,969
What if he does something?

478
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:56,003
He won't.

479
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:57,838
Why not?

480
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,141
Stop freaking
your shit and think.

481
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:03,010
Why do you think the
school kept it quiet?

482
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:05,946
He leaves, no one talks,
neither side gets screwed.

483
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:08,916
[Announcer] Parker
receives the pass.

484
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:11,051
Now it's this whole thing.

485
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:12,253
[Announcer]
Parker's got the ball.

486
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:13,387
[French] You got it, Nadi!

487
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,755
And I told you I didn't
want anyone to know.

488
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:16,056
Oh, shut up!

489
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,058
You won't ever see him again.

490
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,093
[Announcer]
Parker's still going.

491
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:20,294
But that's not what I wanted.

492
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:22,997
Jane, do you really
think men lay off

493
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,298
because you ask them nicely?

494
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,270
[Announcer]
Anvils lose control.

495
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,437
[people cheer]

496
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:32,273
Grow a uterus.

497
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:35,209
[French] Come on, Nadi!

498
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:37,311
[Announcer] Williams
gets the ball.

499
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:38,245
[Merritt] Goddamn it!

500
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,080
[people cheer]

501
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:44,218
[Announcer] Williams
shoots and she scores!

502
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:46,987
Point goes to the Eagles.

503
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,088
And that's the game, folks.

504
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:50,457
The Eagles take
it over the Anvils

505
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:52,393
in a nail-biting
four to three finish.

506
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,296
The Anvils would like
to thank everybody

507
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,998
for coming out to
witness this final game

508
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:00,200
between the Eagles
and the Anvils.

509
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:03,470
[tense, ominous music]

510
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:09,678
And that Polycore Pane.

511
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:12,212
Paul's Polycore Security Glass.

512
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:14,982
And, while you're
there, don't forget

513
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:18,620
to take a selfie with Paul's
Polycore Security Camera.

514
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:21,656
[people chattering]

515
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:26,695
- Why don't you fuck off,
- Brody?

516
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:27,796
Oh, shit.

517
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,129
- Hey!
- Yo, get off her,

518
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:31,198
- you piece of shit!
- French, French!

519
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:33,300

[insects chirrup]

522
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,173
[French] No, don't do this.

523
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:41,643
[Nadia] It's not
covering enough.

524
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:42,976
[French] Ow!

525
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,179
[Nadia] This is
more me than you.

526
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:47,181
[pulsing music]

527
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:48,783
[Ellis] Dude, I'm
pretty sure he grew

528
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:50,184
facial hair in fourth grade.

529
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:51,952
[French] No, I mean like
he's obviously on steroids.

530
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:53,887
No one can just
do five pull-ups.

531
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:56,290
He's been held back
like four times.

532

537
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,061
- Just go.

and the things that they
can do and say to us

better than everybody else

00:51:27,755 --> 00:51:29,356
We have to think.

904
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,491
There's no service, no wifi.

905
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:33,061
No fire alarms,
no fire detectors.

906
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:34,328
I was gonna say that.

907
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:35,228
[Jane] And the
landlines are down.

908
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:37,197
Wait, what about the vents?

909
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,198
We could use those.

910
00:51:41,069 --> 00:51:43,370
Do you really think you're
gonna fit in there, dickhead?

911
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:44,606
And how would that actually
get us out of here?

912
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:46,273
Where do you think we
are, Jurassic Park?

913
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:47,441
Right, 'cause you're
just pouring forth

914
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:49,443
such incredibly
intelligent strategies

915
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:51,445
to get us out of here,
aren't you, Nadia?

916
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:53,380
You just think you're so
fucking smart, don't you?

917
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:54,949
You just think you're
above everybody else!

918
00:51:54,983 --> 00:51:56,316
Now is not-

919
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,619
- Well, maybe you should
just bust down that wall

920
00:51:57,652 --> 00:51:59,186
over there with your
massive, chiseled biceps,

921
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:00,521
like you always do?

922
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:01,556
Why don't you
just mind-blast it

923
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:02,590
with your incredible
mental powers

924
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:04,092
and masculine superiority?

925
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:05,425
Yeah, well, maybe if
you didn't get French

926
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:07,260
so fucked up, none of
this would've happened!

927
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:09,396
Maybe if you didn't
fucking bring us here,

928
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:10,430
he wouldn't be dead!

929
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:11,866
Shut the fuck up!

930
00:52:15,202 --> 00:52:17,404
We don't know if all
the doors are locked.

931
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:19,107
Maybe one isn't.

932
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,942
It's midnight, so
the cleaning people,

933
00:52:20,975 --> 00:52:22,409
they come in on
Saturday's right?

934
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:23,511
Not until eight.

935
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,446
This is such bullshit.

936
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,949
We're stuck inside of a school

937
00:52:27,982 --> 00:52:30,518
made of millions of dollars
of bulletproof glass,

938
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:33,588
locks, and cameras, to what?

939
00:52:33,621 --> 00:52:35,255
To keep us safe?

Screw this.

942
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:42,195
Brody has to have a key, so
everybody grab something.

943
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:44,999
We'll fuck him up, get
the keys, and get out.

944
00:52:45,033 --> 00:52:46,433
Wouldn't it be
safer if we stay

945
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:47,669
and just wait for janitors?

946
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:53,173
If you wanna hide like a
rat, be my fucking guest.

947
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:54,542

953
00:53:05,485 --> 00:53:07,287
I killed the
system for 12 hours.

954
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,422

Suck my tits.

956
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:14,327
If we find an open
door, I'm taking it

957
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,130
and driving the
hell out of here.

958
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:18,700
I'm not revenging or
waiting for anyone.

959

Got it?

960
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:23,504

What if it's not Brody?

975
00:56:24,552 --> 00:56:25,519
What if it's Rakowski?

976
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:26,654
- What the fuck?
- Listen to me,

977
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:28,723
Frenchy, he found
her diary earlier,

978
00:56:28,756 --> 00:56:30,224
and it said some
really weird shit.

979
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:32,226
She's in charge of the
mascot, and she's into axes.

980
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,261
Ellis, it's Brody.

981
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:35,763

982
00:56:35,796 --> 00:56:36,831
[Merritt] Guys, let's go.

986
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:44,772

987

have a phone we can use?

991
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,388

got something else.

992

I found this note in my locker.

1002

Listen, I think, I really think

1003
00:58:22,636 --> 00:58:24,705
it's not Rakowski or Brody.

1004
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:27,875
You need to stop.

1005
00:58:27,908 --> 00:58:30,144
Merritt, he's the only
one who would do this.

1006

I don't give a
shit who it is, okay?

01:04:09,883 --> 01:04:10,685
It's fine.

1081
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:23,364
So, I think about that
camping trip all the time.

1082
01:04:29,403 --> 01:04:31,271
It's like I can see us there,

1083
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:38,212
and we're with my mom,

1084
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:48,122
and I'm looking up at all
of those really tall trees.

1085
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,561
I wish we could go back there.

1086
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:57,231
- Merritt-
- Stop.

1087
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:02,302
- Please, don't shut me-
- Just stop.

[door clicks]

1093
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:02,196
Look up, Jane, look up.

1094
01:06:11,573 --> 01:06:12,372
See her?

1095
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:19,279
That girl there, I've seen
what she's really about.

1096
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:22,884
I think you should see it, too.

1097
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,186
[Jane] I should've just...

1098
01:06:29,223 --> 01:06:30,224
I don't know.

[pulsing, foreboding music]

1100
01:06:34,529 --> 01:06:36,163

[tense, pulsing music]

1102
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,503

[dark, skittering music]

1112
01:07:23,343 --> 01:07:24,344
Where's Ellis?

[dark, skittering music]

1114
01:07:28,783 --> 01:07:30,150
[Jane] Come on.

1115
01:07:30,183 --> 01:07:31,385
Where's Ellis?

1116
01:07:31,418 --> 01:07:32,419

Let's go!

1120
01:07:36,925 --> 01:07:38,492
[Merritt] Where are we going?

1121
01:07:38,526 --> 01:07:39,694
We have to go faster.

1122
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:40,528
[Merritt] Ow!

[throbbing, tense music]

1124
01:07:41,461 --> 01:07:42,496
Oh my God!

1125
01:07:44,097 --> 01:07:45,399
Just a little further.

1126
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:47,167
- I can't, Jane!
- Yes, you can!

1127

[throbbing, tense music]

1128
01:07:58,813 --> 01:07:59,581
We have to go.

1129

Jane. [pants]

1135
01:08:58,438 --> 01:09:01,509
So, what, we just
wait until he pops

1136
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:03,477
out again and pulverizes us?

1137
01:09:05,445 --> 01:09:06,246
Hello?

1138
01:09:08,616 --> 01:09:12,620
Ow! [grunts]

1139
01:09:27,802 --> 01:09:30,470
Jane, where's Ellis?

1140
01:09:32,674 --> 01:09:33,841
Tell me.

1141
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,511
[droning music]

1142
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:45,318
This is all because of you.

1143
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:54,162
- Because of me?
- Oh, shut up.

1144
01:09:55,563 --> 01:09:56,496
You know what you did,

1145
01:09:57,699 --> 01:10:00,168
acting all helpless
with Aunspach.

1146
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,235
"Oh, Merritt, I don't
know what to do.

1147
01:10:02,269 --> 01:10:03,671
"Merritt, help me, Merritt.

1148
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:05,472
"Oh, Merritt, oh, I'm so weak."

1149
01:10:05,506 --> 01:10:06,974
[Jane] He touched me.

1150
01:10:07,008 --> 01:10:11,612
Oh, you loved it, right
until he got too close.

1151
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:15,717
So I saved the day,
even though you made

1152
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:19,286
me look like the asshole
when I told you not to.

1153
01:10:20,621 --> 01:10:22,523
[Jane] I told you
not to tell anyone.

1154
01:10:22,557 --> 01:10:25,693
Even though you stole
the only guy I ever liked.

1155
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:26,594
[Jane] I didn't!

1156
01:10:26,627 --> 01:10:29,063
Even though I'm the one, me,

1157
01:10:29,097 --> 01:10:32,365
who got Aunspach's
dick out of your face.

1158
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:34,468
[Jane] Because you
want to go to Princeton,

1159
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:35,737
you wanted that trust fund.

1160
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,872
Because I was your new mom!

1161
01:10:41,441 --> 01:10:44,478
I got you friends
and play dates.

1162
01:10:46,047 --> 01:10:49,550
I protected you, I
stood up for you.

1163
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:51,919
I cleaned your clothes,

1164
01:10:51,953 --> 01:10:56,057
while you got to be the
little wonder-ass genius.

1165
01:11:00,393 --> 01:11:02,797
"Why can't you be more
like Jane, Merritt?

1166

Well, guess what?

I'm the cool one.

1176
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:31,225
I'm pretty and rich.

1177
01:11:31,259 --> 01:11:34,695
Everyone wants to be my
friend and hook up with me,

1178
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:38,266
and you're not
better than me, okay?

1179
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:40,768
Nothing about you
is better than me.

1180
01:11:41,936 --> 01:11:43,805
- Not your clothes.
- Stop, please.

1181
01:11:43,838 --> 01:11:46,541
Or your voice or your hair.

1182
01:11:46,574 --> 01:11:49,043
- Stop it!
- Or your body or your face.

1183
01:11:49,076 --> 01:11:53,346
You're just sad,
small, and pathetic.

Snickerdoodle?

1195
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:51,966
Miss Taylor baked these.

1196
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:55,202
They're very good.

1197
01:14:02,743 --> 01:14:03,711
What do you want?

1198
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:11,619
You know, I thought that
our last talk was enough,

1199
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:16,891
but you needed something more,
so that's what I gave you.

1200
01:14:18,491 --> 01:14:20,795
I didn't need
anything from you.

1201
01:14:28,936 --> 01:14:31,572
How did you feel when
you pushed Miss Sinclair?

1202
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:35,977
Do you think you could've
done that before?

1203
01:14:38,946 --> 01:14:40,247
They held you back, Jane.

1204
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:44,852
They lowered you to their level.

1205
01:14:44,885 --> 01:14:47,989
Anyone could see that,
except for yourself.

1206
01:14:48,022 --> 01:14:51,459
But, tonight, that all changed.

1207
01:14:53,127 --> 01:14:56,496
You outlasted every single
one of those fiddlers,

1208
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:59,867
and, now, you are free of them.

1209
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:03,337
You picked up the hammer.

1210
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,176
And you will accomplish every
exceptional piece of work

1211
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,745
that I know you're capable of,

1212

that I know you were born to do,

1213
01:15:13,848 --> 01:15:18,786
because, my dearest
Jane, you are special.

1214
01:15:27,828 --> 01:15:31,399
Oh, I forgot.

1215
01:15:33,234 --> 01:15:34,235

You dropped this the other day,

1219
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:52,920
so I held onto it for you.

1220
01:16:01,262 --> 01:16:06,267
I'll give it back
if you thank me.

as much as I have,
