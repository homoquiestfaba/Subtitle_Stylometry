1
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,772
Oh, disc it.

2
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:14,785
Task it a buiscuit, hold Dr. Ceci.
Stop your plan it.

3
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:17,196
Almost.

4
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,006
There.

5
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:22,166
We'll be shadow puppets.

6
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:28,075
Why haven't got me breakfast yet, either?

7
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:30,023
Catou!

8
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,034
Shadow puppets?

9
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,034
Seriously mate. You are one
kidney short of a meat pie.

10
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,234
I was..

11
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:03,042
Give me.

12
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,044
Go!

13
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,219
Get off of me,
you good for nothing feline, cat!

14
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:15,131
Say you can't even get a nice
sleep without some fleery, limey?

15
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,048
Signal fire off the starboard bow!

16
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:20,410
Signal fire!
Starboard bow!

17
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,224
Captain, captain!
Wake up!

18
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:28,897
You waky, waky!

19
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:31,514
Attack! Board the ship!

20
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,262
Here, swashbucklirus, and what is it!

21
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,351
Bosun, is you?

22
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:37,421
Sorry to wake you, captain.

23
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:42,021
But there's a signal fire on the small
Island off the starboard side.

24
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:44,102
What course of action shall we be taking.

25
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:45,797
Let me have a look.

26
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,272
Some sort of house on fire.

27
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:54,250
What's this?

28
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:57,160
Fire abroad side!

29
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:59,353
Drive those bloody beasts off.

30
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,565
Aye, aye Captain!

31
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:03,806
Then go and bring back whoever he is.

32
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:09,106
And Bosun, make sure they leave
nothing behind of any value.

33
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,712
Will do, captain.

34
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,307
Humans?

35
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,079
What you go by fellow?

36
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:30,218
Crusoe, Robinson Crusoe.

37
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:33,833
Looks like them wild beasts
nearly had you for dinner.

38
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:36,133
Lucky we found you when we did.

39
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:39,110
Oh, they are my.
Hold on a second mate.

40
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,308
Let's have a look in there.

41
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:47,050
Not a single gold tooth in his head.

42
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:49,024
Pity.
Pirates!

43
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:56,937
Hey, ye've been one lucky bloke.

44
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:58,773
Crusoe, isn't?

45
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,100
I'm in your debt, Captain.

46
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:04,787
Ney! Plus me eagle eye
night watch then saved yer hide.

47
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:12,741
Well, let me tell ye, blasterd bird!

48
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,901
No captain, he's with me.
No captain.

49
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,255
He's with me.

50
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,624
A talking parrot.

51
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:24,025
What skull duggery is this?

52
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,125
Trying to talk yerself, did ya?

53
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,607
Yes captain.

54
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,607
Drink up, that'll start yer stump smith.

55
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:36,058
Now, tell me more about this island of yarn.

56
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:40,758
Is there anything of...
shall we say. value on it?

57
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,175
All I can say is that.

58
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,218
I was shipwrecked, marooned.

59
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,418
Fending for myself with nothing
but time and very few skills to survive.

60
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:57,822
Sorry about that.

61
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,629
I see the bird has taught
ye how to drink as well.

62
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:03,410
That's not very polite Tuesday,

63
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:05,970
you'll have to wait outside, I'm afraid.

64
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,856
Fending for myself?

65
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:12,724
Really?

66
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:20,614
Listen. You two wanna hear the
true tale of Robinson Crusoe?

67
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:23,138
Of sure,

68
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:24,218
we're all ears,

69
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:26,504
or at least Cecil here is.

70
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,042
Hey, come on, Ruf.

71
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:32,438
It all begin like every other day
before Crusoe came to my island.

72
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,819
Just another day in paradise,

73
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:37,942
every day was the same.

74
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,141
Beautiful turquoise water,

75
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:43,170
blue skies and lots of delicious fruit.

76
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:45,267
Sounds perfect right?

77
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:49,267
Boring if you ask me.

78
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:51,237
How much paradise can a bird take.

79
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:53,474
I really wanted to get off this island.

80
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:59,323
Let's see what's been washed up today?

81
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,241
Of course, more of these.

82
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,241
What's this?

83
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,312
This can be promising.

84
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,563
Hey guys, it is lool out time

85
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:33,216
Hey... be right there.

86
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,406
Hi Rosie, check out these delicious traits.

87
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:44,503
Gorgeous, just gorgeous.

88
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,818
Just look at all those bugs.

89
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:49,949
The beetles are the best.

90
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:54,330
Crunchy on the outside,
with a soft gooey center.

91
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:56,159
Hey, where did it go?

92
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:59,255
My kind of vermin.
You thief.

93
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,614
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.

94
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:06,112
Aren't you joining us for
a lool out today Mac?

95
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:07,513
We're all here.

96
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,757
Yeah, I'll be right there,

97
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:11,754
do we really need to lool out every day?

98
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:15,463
So, what did you bring today?

99
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:19,811
I'm not sure what it is.

100
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,889
I meant food for the lool out.

101
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,518
Of course he didn't bring
anything for the lool out.

102
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,071
This is beautiful.

103
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:32,005
Hey, guys, guys,

104
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:34,838
I think I really found
something important this time.

105
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,738
Check this out!

106
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:39,330
Where?
What?

107
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:41,824
Scrubby, you're really going blind.

108
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,317
Over here!

109
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:45,715
Smells delicious.

110
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:47,597
No, no, is not food.

111
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,543
It's proof that there's more
to the world than just our island.

112
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,380
Here we go again.

113
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:54,375
It's true.

114
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:56,548
Can't we just eat in peace for once.

115
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:58,296
Sure, no problem,

116
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:01,745
just as long as you can tell
me where this came from.

117
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:04,094
From the water.

118
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:06,003
I vote for Carmello.

119
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,003
I too vote for Carmello.

120
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,001
I too vote for Carmello.
Oh, come on, this isn't election.

121
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:14,093
The thing in the bobble is... is...

122
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:15,411
Is what?

123
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:18,057
You know what I think, Mac?

124
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:20,657
That thingy is whatever
you want to believe it is.

125
00:08:20,894 --> 00:08:21,622
Exactly.

126
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,991
You are one hopeless dreamer.

127
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,811
Did you forget you
almost died of exhaustion.

128
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,081
Flying across the ocean, looking
for this other world of yours.

129
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:33,658
My dear macaw, you must wake up,

130
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,858
and smell the papaya.

131
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,558
For this is the world.

132
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:39,502
I don't care what you guys say,

133
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:43,302
there's a bigger world out there
and I intend to find it.

134
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:48,518
♪ <i>I ply my trade from the Union Jack!</i> ♪

135
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,664
♪ <i>Upon the seven seas</i> ♪

136
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:56,667
♪ <i>And unless I eat some rancid meat</i> ♪

137
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,901
♪ <i>Bury me soul where the mermaid please</i> ♪

138
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:07,785
I wanna be mat makers
of that green around the gills.

139
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:11,928
We ain't anchoring to be sharing
your lunch with you, lad.

140
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,604
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.

141
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:16,204
You're there right.

142
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,635
If you're fixing the up jock
find your way down we.

143
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:22,892
My hat, don't...

144
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:26,289
Your poor stomach,

145
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,602
you see wait till you get
to them strange islands,

146
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:31,978
and you meet your first cannibals.

147
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,053
Cannibals?

148
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:45,301
We made our choice to go
to sea, right, easy old pal?

149
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,439
And I swear, I'll not regret it.

150
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:53,254
Alright, go and bring me something to eat.

151
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,519
Right May, I wont fail you.

152
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:12,414
Good day, you lucky clucks
will you join me for a little snack?

153
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,504
Come on now.

154
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,404
No need to be shy.

155
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:21,637
I'll chop you.

156
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:26,616
What business might you
be having above decks?

157
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:31,524
I was just making sure my chicken food.

158
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:34,297
Friends.

159
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:36,997
Were fresh.

160
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,597
No, warm.

161
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:40,197
Warm and confy.

162
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:46,619
Get your fur over there.
not!

163
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:55,610
So, then, where were we?

164
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:56,774
Knock it off

165
00:10:57,304 --> 00:11:01,550
You cats belong down below,
and stay away from our chickens.

166
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:11,042
That goes for you as well!

167
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:16,050
Who does that green gill
land lover thinks he is?

168
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,719
The huminus, threw us into the haul?

169
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:23,690
This is our ship wretched as it is, it's home.

170
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:28,010
Mark my word now, someday, somehow,

171
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:30,810
that canine and his human will pay.

172
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,311
I'm with you there mate, they'll pay alright.

173
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,492
How much exactly we're charging them?

174
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:44,630
That should teach them to mess
with our egg supply, old boy!

175
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:45,654
Eggs.

176
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,477
Oh, no, not again.

177
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,957
Buck up, boy yo?

178
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,455
Looks like we got one
Tuesday of a storm brewing.

179
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,020
So much for a peaceful meal.

180
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:11,786
Oh, nobody saw that one coming,
hang on Carmello!

181
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,612
Perhaps it would be wise
to move this far east to the cave.

182
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:18,309
Let's get moving,
this is gonna be a nasty one.

183
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,305
I'm with you on that call.

184
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:23,344
Hey, Mac, grab the pineapple.

185
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:30,726
Like we really needed this pineapple.

186
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:37,501
All hands on deck, and get those sails down.

187
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:45,054
Hey you self homemade,
mister ride up the storm there.

188
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:12,511
Aynsley!

189
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:15,285
I got you.

190
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:24,333
Hey, hey!

191
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:26,738
Help!

192
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:28,738
Help!

193
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,922
Look out, flying away pineapple!

194
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:45,038
Sorry Pango.

195
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:48,077
Careful Rosie.
I got it!

196
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,160
Scrubby!

197
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,811
Help!

198
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:55,839
Quick Rosie, the tree!

199
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,606
Easy Scrubby, don't panic.

200
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:01,341
Ok, I got you now.

201
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,241
Well, come on you old goat,
get your hooves moving.

202
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,448
We ain't got all day.

203
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:07,802
That's it!

204
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:11,602
Easy. Don't be afraid.

205
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:13,502
One step at a time.

206
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,802
Scrubby!
Help!

207
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:19,217
He's not going to make it, do something!

208
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:20,817
Carmello, grab him.

209
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:23,987
I got him.

210
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:30,932
Help!

211
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:44,555
Help! we're in here!
Someone help!

212
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:46,305
Help!

213
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:11,250
Away!

214
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,797
Payback time!

215
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:29,618
I can't hold on Carmello,
this is the end little buddy?

216
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:31,835
There's not much time, they're gonna fall.

217
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:34,758
Keep steady, I'm coming mates.

218
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:39,004
Pango, what are you doing?

219
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,106
How's it going mate?

220
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:59,106
Nice try Pango, but is hopeless,
I'm a goner.

221
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:00,813
Mac!

222
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:03,382
Hold on!
Hold on!

223
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:08,990
Come on, come on, come on!
I'll get you guys out of there!

224
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:11,565
We have to do something!

225
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:17,150
Mac!

226
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:21,934
This just went from bad to worse.

227
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:26,023
Hey, don't worry guys,
that branch looks pretty solid to me.

228
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:29,204
Right, but how do we get down?

229
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,172
You got me there.

230
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:53,518
Oh, I can't believe it.

231
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,137
They're alive!

232
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:56,527
It's a miracle.

233
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:59,798
Hey, anybody wants some pineapple?

234
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:45,526
Do you hear that sound?

235
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:48,126
What's out there, Mac?

236
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:49,932
I have no idea.

237
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:52,105
Never heard a sound like that before.

238
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,309
Can you see anything?

239
00:17:56,939 --> 00:18:01,800
Not a thing, unfortunately, we're
gonna have to wait until morning.

240
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:08,000
Same old stuff.

241
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,264
Shells and more shells.

242
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,772
Swollen.
Begones.

243
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:20,900
That's a new taste.
Earthy, with a slight touch of salt.

244
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:24,569
Come on, come tu papa!

245
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,806
Hey Scrubs, what'd you find?

246
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,926
What is it you're eating?

247
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:34,186
I don't know, but it's delicious.

248
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:37,086
Oh, Scrubs.
You don't collect stuff like this.

249
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:42,737
My nose tells me there's
more goodies at that rocky point.

250
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:47,034
Look at that?

251
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,142
Wooden Ca... terpillars.

252
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:50,961
See, I was right.

253
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:55,861
This is the most incredible proof
that there's another world out there.

254
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:58,907
No, look behind you?

255
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:01,043
What are you talking about, behind me?

256
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,000
I can't believe it.

257
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:07,611
Is the thing we heard dying last night.

258
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,055
What do you think it is?

259
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,663
The other world.

260
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:16,036
I have to get a closer look.
Mac don't, we have no idea what it is.

261
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:17,936
If it's dangerous, Mac?

262
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:21,240
This is amazing, I was right!

263
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,119
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

264
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:29,119
This is from the other world!

265
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:31,200
I've never seen anything like this.

266
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:32,237
Incredible!

267
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,300
Mac should be more careful.

268
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,300
Pango is right! we should
keep our distance.

269
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,143
What's going on?

270
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:32,148
Easy now, whatever you are.
I just want to talk.

271
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:39,495
See monsters?

272
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,641
Look at this.

273
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,128
This heart makes me shoot leftings.

274
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:55,205
Hello!

275
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,070
Is anyone out there?

276
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,111
Hey, can anybody hear me?

277
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:01,018
Look at it!

278
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,581
Captain? Bosen? Anyone?

279
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,681
It's hideous!

280
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:12,136
Where did they all go.

281
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:14,936
I can't believe everyone is really gone.

282
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,923
Looks like there's just the two of us.

283
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,743
Let's go to shore.

284
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:23,014
Hang on Aynsley.
The current is really strong.

285
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:49,337
Land, sweet land!

286
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:52,502
Is so good to be alive Aynsley.

287
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,717
Pot your uncle,
sea monsters walking on land?

288
00:21:57,795 --> 00:22:00,227
We're in big trouble.

289
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:02,932
Only one thing has two legs.

290
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:04,032
A bird!

291
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,332
That ain't no bird I've ever seen.

292
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,582
Yeah, he can't even fly.

293
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:27,410
That monster is going to eat Carmello.

294
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,446
What's going on Aynsley?

295
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,850
We gotta do something, now!

296
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:35,295
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.

297
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,295
We have to scare those sea monsters off.

298
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:39,924
Come back here Aynsley.

299
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:41,064
Stay close together,

300
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:42,398
we don't know what's out there.

301
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:43,774
What was that?

302
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,002
Aynsley? Aynsley what's that noise?

303
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,422
Cannibals!
Aynsley cannibals!

304
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:54,297
We have to get off this island.

305
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:55,497
Sailor warned us.

306
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,169
They'll skin us alive and eat us.

307
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:01,203
Hurry old boy, they're coming for us!

308
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:05,992
Get inside Aynsley, go boy, go, there.

309
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:10,094
Guys, guys, guys, what are you doing?

310
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:13,004
Scaring off the sea monsters,
thank you very much.

311
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:15,010
And what if they aren't sea mosnters.

312
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:17,308
Did you see the furry one's teeth?

313
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:18,414
He'll reap us to shreds.

314
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:22,517
Everybody calm down, we're safe here.
Are we?

315
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,399
We really don't know what
those creatures are capable of.

316
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:29,205
I know one thing they are capable of.
Leaving the island.

317
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:30,304
What?

318
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:35,042
Oh, no, come on,
this can't be happening to me.

319
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:37,449
He's actualy leaving.

320
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:40,390
We did it.

321
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:42,461
We got rid of him.

322
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,171
Yeah, we scared them big time.

323
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:47,421
Will somebody tell me what's happening?

324
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,020
I'll tell you what's going on.

325
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:53,620
You guys have ruined my chance
to get off this island and see the world.

326
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:55,415
You really don't get it, do you?

327
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:58,511
You think this is paradise, well, it is not.

328
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:01,037
It meant so much to me.

329
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,334
He's back.

330
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:09,651
Oh no, here we go again.

331
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:11,803
Back? Are you serious?

332
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:13,242
Let me see.

333
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:17,700
Here's what we're gonna do,
we stay out of sight.

334
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:19,600
And, we keep an eye on them.

335
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,500
To see what they end up doing, ok?

336
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:25,147
Ok, then, nobody goes on the beach,

337
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,479
that goes for you too Scrubby.

338
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:30,161
He, yeah, I heard you.

339
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:34,531
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.

340
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:58,319
All of those new smells
are driving me crazy.

341
00:24:58,468 --> 00:25:00,259
I gotta go check it out.

342
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:02,520
Where are you going Scrubby?

343
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:06,532
Come back!
It's not safe out there.

344
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:11,411
Can't let all those tasty mussels
get washed away.

345
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:15,349
If I recall correctly didn't
Mac say we should all stay out of sight.

346
00:25:15,536 --> 00:25:16,349
He did.

347
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:18,719
Speaking of which, where is Mac?

348
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:29,134
Sorry about today old friend,
that was a pretty inactive attempt.

349
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:31,700
What was I thinking?

350
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:34,350
I haven't the foggiest idea where we are.

351
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:36,131
All for that matter,

352
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:39,490
the slightest inkling in
which direction to set sail.

353
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:42,534
Someone is bound
to come and save us old boy.

354
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:43,834
I'm sure of it.

355
00:25:44,602 --> 00:25:47,448
If those cannibals come back,
we'll be ready for them.

356
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,391
Who's out there?

357
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:56,124
Show yourselves!

358
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,541
I don't want to tear you to shreds.

359
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:04,447
And I have a musket.

360
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:07,699
A goat?

361
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,807
It´s just a goat.

362
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,352
A bird?

363
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:16,663
Maybe there aren't hunters
and cannibals after all.

364
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:23,500
Mac, what were you doing
out there all by yourself?

365
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:24,748
I thought you said we should stay hidden.

366
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:25,968
I was just...

367
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:27,564
checking things out, that's all.

368
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:29,528
What's all the commotion about anyway.

369
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:31,946
Well, Epi just made a good point.

370
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,803
I just suggested,

371
00:26:34,104 --> 00:26:35,159
hypothetically,

372
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:38,510
that possibly the sea monster
lost that thing that Mac jiffy found.

373
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:42,081
And maybe he's come to get it back.
Along with us.

374
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:44,617
Is one of two things for sure.

375
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:47,681
A coincidence, or a bad omen.

376
00:26:48,294 --> 00:26:50,410
In a way you need to get rid of it.

377
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:52,939
Why not just give it back
to the sea monsters.

378
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,914
A "G" idea.
No way!

379
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,049
You're kidding!

380
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,412
You're so selfish.
Selfish?

381
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,103
Ok.

382
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:03,620
Maybe.

383
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:05,525
Just give me time to think about it.

384
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:08,001
But if I do give it back,

385
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,332
you're all coming with me.

386
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:36,522
Well.

387
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,731
We're right there Aynsley.

388
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:40,559
We got some work to do.

389
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:44,069
Let's save all we can before
is all lost to the sea.

390
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:57,701
How is he looking mate?

391
00:27:57,732 --> 00:27:59,613
They're taking over our beach.

392
00:27:59,732 --> 00:28:02,513
He's pulling strange stuff out from the sea.

393
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:06,019
I suppose this means they're not
leaving anytime soon, then.

394
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,319
Looks that way.

395
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,659
Do you see how the furry one sleeps
all day while the big one does the work.

396
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:27,500
No, but I'll take your word for it.

397
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:30,098
I bet the sleeping one is the boss.

398
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:43,591
Look, he stripped off his skin.

399
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,099
I'm going to be sick.

400
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:54,616
<font color="#00ffff"><i>None of us knew it at the time,</i></font>

401
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:59,486
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but we were being watched
by the real monsters on the island</i></font>

402
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,000
Some luck May.

403
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:13,722
Their green gill human and his
manking mock mating safety here.

404
00:29:13,811 --> 00:29:15,767
How are we gonna deal with him,

405
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:17,723
he might be a problem for us.

406
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:18,737
Don't you worry,

407
00:29:18,962 --> 00:29:21,473
I'll figure out a way to get
rid of them quick enough.

408
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,220
For the time being we sit,

409
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:26,340
watch and wait.

410
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:28,933
Come on May,

411
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,180
I'm starving here.

412
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:33,890
And cut to what I just say!

413
00:29:33,923 --> 00:29:38,716
Sit, watch and wait.

414
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,982
That's right, now stay focused.

415
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:43,682
We got the upper claw.

416
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,260
No one knows we're here,

417
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,553
which means we take our time.

418
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:55,037
And we pick them off one by one.

419
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:07,899
Look Aynsley,

420
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:09,908
this can come in very handy.

421
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:13,898
I gotta to practice before we venture
out there to get our dinner, right boy!

422
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:18,855
♪ <i>I ply my trade from the Union Jack!</i> ♪

423
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,793

426
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,052
Steady!

427
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:36,591
What's he doing?

428
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:39,889
Back your hammer, and.

429
00:30:43,862 --> 00:30:45,813
I don't know about you Scrubby,

430
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:49,813
but I'm planning on stayting as far
away from that monster as possible.

431
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:52,195
What was that all about?

432
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,174
I have absolutely no idea.

433
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:59,332
What we need to find out, is what
these newcomers intentions are,

434
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:02,073
From the sound of it,
they're up to no good

435
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:05,778
Obviously they're trying to kill us.
Maybe, but maybe not.

436
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:08,780
The truth of the matter
is that these new comers,

437
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:11,979
have brought nothing but
trouble to our paradise,

438
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,412
that is a fact.

439
00:31:13,823 --> 00:31:17,734
Fine, then do like I ask,
and stay out of sight.

440
00:31:17,823 --> 00:31:20,014
They're proof that there's
another world out there

441
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:23,034
and I'm going to find out
whether they're friend or foe.

442
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:25,246
You really don't get it, do you?

443
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:48,830
That was close!

444
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,376
Ok, let's give this a go, one last time.

445
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:00,241
Did you see that Aynsley!

446
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:02,375
I did it, I hit the mark!

447
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,467
Let's go fix something to eat, old boy.

448
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:09,767
That was a miracle,
I'd never thought I'd hit it.

449
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:12,067
Well. I can hit something after all.

450
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:16,986
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I was starting to wonder
if everyone wasn't right,</i></font>

451
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:19,148
<font color="#00ffff"><i>the new world was finally here,</i></font>

452
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:22,510
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and I had no idea if
I was ready for it or not.</i></font>

453
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:35,922
Tapir's ready as I've ever seen.

454
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:38,492
Go for the throat, let's make this quick.

455
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,192
Wait, the human!

456
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:06,922
I can't do it boy.

457
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:08,648
Go on!

458
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:10,173
Go!

459
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:12,023
What now?

460
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:16,505
Sorry pal.

461
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,705
I've never shot anything before,
why don't we try fishing.

462
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,383
What's burning?

463
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:28,825
That would be me.

464
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,728
You smell like bump biscuits.

465
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:33,935
Something is coming.

466
00:33:39,913 --> 00:33:41,714
Looks like Rosie was here, that's strange,

467
00:33:41,793 --> 00:33:44,124
Rosie never leaves any food behind.

468
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:55,981
Would you prefer light or dark
meat for lunch, darling?

469
00:33:56,011 --> 00:33:57,557
I prefer... Dog!

470
00:33:57,748 --> 00:33:59,948
Ready to get even, ratter!

471
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:11,553
Hold Aynsley, I'm coming,

472
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:15,253
those blasted ratters,
they did survive after all.

473
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm hit!

474
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:20,130
Run for it!

475
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:26,110
Good dog!

476
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:27,910
You're alright old boy?

477
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:31,191
Did you I hear that?

478
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:32,954
Over there!

479
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,704
It's a bird, a beautiful parrot.

480
00:34:37,193 --> 00:34:40,205
Strangely, that's what all the fuss was about.

481
00:34:41,193 --> 00:34:42,905
The ratters went after the bird.

482
00:34:42,937 --> 00:34:47,281
You did good old boy, and you,
we're gonna fix you up straight away.

483
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:52,038
Look Aynsley, a ring!

484
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:54,423
That can only mean one thing,

485
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:56,711
sailors have sail for this island before.

486
00:34:56,966 --> 00:34:58,906
I believe there's hope for us after all.

487
00:35:04,982 --> 00:35:07,333
You can come out guys,
there's no one around.

488
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,033
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.

489
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,579
This is the very spot where
that sea monster attack me.

490
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,979
Well, sort of.

491
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:23,221
I've almost.

492
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,190
We shouldn't have let him go alone.

493
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:27,402
Maybe he's molting.

494
00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:30,039
That's a bit of a stretch Pango.

495
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:33,271
Just wait 'till I get my hooves on them!

496
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:37,316
Anyway you look at it, this is not good.

497
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:39,585
Mac can't be gone.

498
00:35:41,018 --> 00:35:42,189
What's that?

499
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:44,202
And who are you two?

500
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:46,769
Just two homeless castaways,

501
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:50,009
we were held captive
by that human for months

502
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:52,969
with nothing to eat but
the crumbs from his table.

503
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:55,024
What about our friend?

504
00:35:55,148 --> 00:35:56,819
Did you see him by any chance?

505
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:01,098
It's a true tragedy, alright.

506
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:04,432
An unfortunate turn of events.

507
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:06,009
You see we caught.

508
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:11,088
We saw the hosting.

509
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:14,062
Well, come on, let's hear it.

510
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:15,862
What are you waiting for?

511
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:18,261
We'll tell you what
happened to your friend.

512
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:22,100
For I'm warning you, it ain't pretty.

513
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:26,014
You see, the human loves to eat birds,

514
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:28,181
and I'm afraid your friend got...

515
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,017
trapped.

516
00:36:39,102 --> 00:36:43,073
This should only take a minute,
It's just dislocated.

517
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,282
But. it's going to hurt, a bit.

518
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:48,189
Don't worry.

519
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,225
You´ll feel better in a day or two, though
you won't be able to fly right away.

520
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:56,508
Well then, I suppose you'll need name
if you're gonna stay here for a while.

521
00:36:57,138 --> 00:37:01,052
Let's see, by my reckoning today is Tuesday,

522
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,484
that's a good a name as any, mate.

523
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:05,262
Can you say, Tuesday.

524
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:07,002
T u e s d a y

525
00:37:10,197 --> 00:37:13,236
Well, not quite, but that's a start.

526
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:17,119
Take care of our new friend, boy.

527
00:37:17,374 --> 00:37:20,119
I'd better offload as much stuff as I can.

528
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,922
There's no telling how much
the ship will stay in one piece.

529
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,490
They're nothing but cannibals!
Murderers.

530
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:44,328
I say we run him off our island,

531
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:47,315
drive them monsters back into the sea!

532
00:37:47,337 --> 00:37:52,150
Perhaps a plan might be to
force them to live on curse island.

533
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,950
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

534
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:56,021
Curse Island.

535
00:37:57,323 --> 00:37:59,325
What exactly is Curse Island?

536
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:02,040
The end of the earth mate,

537
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:04,000
no one's ever made it back from there.

538
00:38:04,038 --> 00:38:06,579
Yeah, there's nothing there but bugs.

539
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,902
Lots and lots of nasty bugs!

540
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:13,041
Sounds purrrfect,

541
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:15,824
drive them to Curse island.

542
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:17,499
That's not gonna work.

543
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:20,413
You have a better idea?

544
00:38:21,538 --> 00:38:22,449
No.

545
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:26,890
Right, so then, where were we?

546
00:38:30,155 --> 00:38:33,198
Stop your flapping about bird.

547
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:35,698
You need to be resting that wing of yours.

548
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:38,144
What do you want from me?

549
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:39,600
I just want to talk.

550
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:41,135
Me name is Aynsley,

551
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:45,101
and for what I understand,
yours is Tuesday.

552
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:47,324
Call me whatever you want,
except dinner.

553
00:38:47,857 --> 00:38:48,577
Dinner?

554
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:50,762
We're not going to eat you,

555
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:52,207
we saved your life.

556
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,205
Either way, you don't make much
of a meal.

557
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,575
Not like a fat, juicy turkey
sweetheart back at home.

558
00:38:58,612 --> 00:38:59,334
What?

559
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:00,808
Relax.

560
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:02,757
My master likes you.

561
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:04,875
You said, your master?

562
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,157
You did not think that I.

563
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,599
I like you, you're funny.

564
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,240
I've never seen a bird like you in England.

565
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:15,622
England.

566
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:17,482
Tell me more Aynsley.

567
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:21,296
Well buddy, England, my island.

568
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:25,272
Just one fantastic place
in a sea of many lands.

569
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,771
I knew it!

570
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,749
Crusoe wants to explore them all.

571
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,749
If we ever get off this one.

572
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:33,545
You know, you're the first to come
from the outside world.

573
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:34,591
Oh dear,

574
00:39:35,316 --> 00:39:36,644
that's not good news.

575
00:39:45,305 --> 00:39:50,082
Hey, hold on a second,
we're all dress up like this because?

576
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:52,542
Because you look fierce,

577
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,187
now get your heads in the game everyone.

578
00:39:57,262 --> 00:40:01,902
We have the perfect opportunity,
the dog and that bird are still on the ship.

579
00:40:01,994 --> 00:40:02,784
Right.

580
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:04,452
Listen up!

581
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:06,135
Here's the plan,

582
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:08,700
we'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.

583
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:10,500
The rest of you.

584
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:13,724
Go for the human on the beach.

585
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,399
What is sheep?

586
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:18,436
That wooden thing on the beach.

587
00:40:19,306 --> 00:40:22,300
As soon we're on the ship,
"the wooden thing".

588
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:26,000
You attack!
Alright then, fierce, fierce, fierce!

589
00:40:27,388 --> 00:40:30,169
So, I'm a fierce coconut?

590
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:54,488
But I should go tell my
friends that I'm ok.

591
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,888
You better stay put,
you're in no condition to fly.

592
00:40:57,982 --> 00:40:59,982
Well, look at this.

593
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:03,697
We can kill two birds with one stone.

594
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,008
There's two birds now?

595
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:09,215
Oh, shut it, just follow my lead.

596
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:16,427
Look, look! That's him brothers.

597
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:18,367
He's wearing Mac like a trophy.

598
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:20,914
That is so wrong!

599
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:23,310
Attack! Let's get them.

600
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:51,899
Aynsley, we gotta go.

601
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:54,422
What's going on out there.
They've all got mad.

602
00:41:54,961 --> 00:41:58,400
It appears as your friends have
come to avenge your death.

603
00:41:58,424 --> 00:41:59,300
I'm not dead!

604
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:02,600
Oh, we're gonna take care of that
right now.

605
00:42:03,446 --> 00:42:04,751
Aynsley!
Help!

606
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:27,505
Aynsley!

607
00:42:28,496 --> 00:42:29,498
Help!

608
00:42:41,455 --> 00:42:42,960
Come on down there and fight!

609
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:46,928
Aynsley!

610
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,522
Twist it!

611
00:43:05,536 --> 00:43:07,783
Hold on, that sounded like.
Mac!

612
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:09,479
Aynsley!

613
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:12,557
Mac, get out!
Kiki!

614
00:43:14,186 --> 00:43:14,895
Mac!

615
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:16,470
I'm coming boy!

616
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:20,739
Rotten cats!

617
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:23,549
You are to blame for all this!

618
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:26,679
Gotta leave the ship, mate!

619
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:33,760
Aynsley!
Go!

620
00:43:42,543 --> 00:43:44,899
What's happening here?
I thought Mac was dead.

621
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,691
We all did, but I don't
think he made it this time.

622
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:49,493
That would be horrible.

623
00:43:49,653 --> 00:43:52,293
Come on guys,
we better move back now.

624
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:58,581
Oh no, Aynsley, what have I done.

625
00:44:05,689 --> 00:44:06,941
Land.

626
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:08,793
Land!

627
00:44:09,128 --> 00:44:13,141
We're safe mate,
I thought we were goners.

628
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:16,711
Oh, will you just shut up!

629
00:44:17,746 --> 00:44:20,556
What's that noise?
That would be bugs.

630
00:44:20,584 --> 00:44:23,624
Bugs!
Curse Island!

631
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:50,685
Rest in peace old boy.

632
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,474
Tuesday.

633
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,219
Mac!

634
00:45:33,544 --> 00:45:34,497
Kiki!

635
00:45:35,635 --> 00:45:37,706
Mac, you're hurt!

636
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:40,710
I'll be ok.
I'm sure glad to see you.

637
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:42,553
I was worried.
Me too.

638
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:45,413
Come on, now is your chance to get away

639
00:45:45,553 --> 00:45:47,261
I can't.
Well, let me help you.

640
00:45:47,385 --> 00:45:49,201
No, no, no, I, I just...

641
00:45:49,426 --> 00:45:51,815
I don't, want to get away.

642
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:53,020
What?

643
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:55,981
You don't understand,
is all those cats fault.

644
00:45:56,141 --> 00:46:00,520
What do you mean.
They attacked me, he fixed my wing.

645
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,049
And his dog gave his life to save me.

646
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,715
I can't leave him now.

647
00:46:04,858 --> 00:46:06,293
Oh, I see.

648
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,377
So, he's going to take care of you?

649
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,500
Look, he's gonna need my help to survive.

650
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,748
I owe him that.

651
00:46:14,076 --> 00:46:16,277
Exactly, how do you plan on doing that?

652
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:18,272
I mean, look at him.

653
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,071
Tuesday!
Help!

654
00:46:31,646 --> 00:46:32,994
I don't believe it,

655
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:35,619
those cats used us and Mac as well,

656
00:46:35,646 --> 00:46:37,092
and what do we do?

657
00:46:37,317 --> 00:46:39,019
We attacked the human.

658
00:46:39,058 --> 00:46:40,539
Hold on, then.

659
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:44,702
So, what you're saying
is Kiki's debrained fault on this.

660
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,776
Oh, fatal.

661
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:48,676
That's not fair,
we all thought Mac was dead.

662
00:46:48,713 --> 00:46:49,458
Didn't we?

663
00:46:49,483 --> 00:46:51,719
Oh, this is not good, mate.

664
00:46:51,729 --> 00:46:54,600
Yeah, we've made a real mess of things.

665
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:56,208
Looks that way Epi gal.

666
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,004
Where are you going Rosie?

667
00:46:58,029 --> 00:46:59,540
I'm going to clean up our mess.

668
00:46:59,768 --> 00:47:02,800
I'm in!
Let's get cracking then, mate.

669
00:47:02,828 --> 00:47:03,913
Wait a second.

670
00:47:05,145 --> 00:47:08,157
You're going to make an
even bigger mess of things.

671
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,313
Wild beasts, they're
going to get us!

672
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,912
Stay right where you are.

673
00:47:56,815 --> 00:47:58,852
I've got a special treat for all of you.

674
00:48:01,824 --> 00:48:04,829
I just wanted to give you
some biscuits, that's all.

675
00:48:05,899 --> 00:48:07,643
They're quite good.

676
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:21,867
I finished off your dog human,

677
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,931
and I promise one day,

678
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:29,991
you and the rest of
your lot will join him.

679
00:48:33,821 --> 00:48:38,120
Now that, is the taste of desperation.

680
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:41,434
Try to get one, they taste just like chicken.

681
00:49:05,516 --> 00:49:06,753
What, do you want to show me something?

682
00:49:06,754 --> 00:49:08,653
Alright, alright, let's go!

683
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:14,803
Tuesday.

684
00:49:15,638 --> 00:49:17,943
This, this is fantastic.

685
00:49:18,476 --> 00:49:19,655
Fresh water.

686
00:49:20,848 --> 00:49:22,087
Good job Tuesday.

687
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,541
What?
You want me to follow you?

688
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,002
Okay, I'm coming!

689
00:49:34,574 --> 00:49:36,517
Hey guys, look who's here.

690
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,871
Relax. there's nothing to be afraid of.

691
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:49,810
Stay right where you are,
I'll be right back.

692
00:49:51,008 --> 00:49:53,989
What got into him, why is he running away?

693
00:49:54,014 --> 00:49:57,087
Beats me.
Maybe it's your smell.

694
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:09,478
Try one of these, it's really good.

695
00:50:15,957 --> 00:50:17,605
And some for you, and try.

696
00:50:28,115 --> 00:50:30,454
So choosy, where's pretty bird.

697
00:50:30,455 --> 00:50:31,634
I haven't see her yet.

698
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:33,034
Pretty bird.

699
00:50:34,027 --> 00:50:37,607
You don't need to yell Mac,
I mean Tuesday.

700
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,912
I'm right here.
Here you have pretty bird.

701
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:42,119
Here, do you see, I don't hurt you.

702
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:43,926
Come on, don't be afraid.

703
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,493
Come on pretty bird.

704
00:50:48,923 --> 00:50:51,197
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.

705
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,697
Taking one step at a time, right choosy.

706
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,105
One step.

707
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:04,200
I can't May, the current is too strong.

708
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,800
So, you failed again, did you?

709
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:14,000
Would you stop feeling sorry for yourself?

710
00:51:14,273 --> 00:51:16,600
Oh, time will come.

711
00:51:17,013 --> 00:51:20,227
Soon there will be more of us.

712
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:23,797
Revenge will be sweet.

713
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:52,019
That hurt.

714
00:51:52,047 --> 00:51:55,619
Ah, you can't see a bloody thing,
can you old goat?

715
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:59,000
We're gonna have to fix that.

716
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:00,097
There you are.

717
00:52:00,131 --> 00:52:01,868
That should help.

718
00:52:10,184 --> 00:52:12,176
Why Rosie, you're no pig.

719
00:52:12,188 --> 00:52:14,610
Hey, what has gotten into you?

720
00:52:14,655 --> 00:52:16,536
You're gorgeous?

721
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,168
Easy big boy.

722
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,096
No, no.

723
00:52:31,226 --> 00:52:33,038
Oh no.
Tuesday help.

724
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:37,440
Hey guys!

725
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,040
Nevermind.

726
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:47,162
This is hopeless.

727
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:53,447
How am I ever going to survive
in this island?

728
00:53:01,186 --> 00:53:03,699
Yes, of course, that's it!

729
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:06,004
I have to build a tree house!

730
00:53:21,259 --> 00:53:23,473
It's raining tree limbs.

731
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:28,100
Is good enough to eat.

732
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:30,086
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?

733
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,010
Hey snail, what's he doing?

734
00:53:32,081 --> 00:53:36,168
Come on mate, he's just bunkers on us.

735
00:53:36,189 --> 00:53:38,136
He's destroying the tree.

736
00:53:39,161 --> 00:53:41,212
I can't saw more.

737
00:53:41,232 --> 00:53:45,238
Need to finish shelter, we must build.

738
00:53:47,077 --> 00:53:50,253
Yes Sir, a whole porridge please.

739
00:53:53,056 --> 00:53:55,537
<font color="#00ffff"><i>We had no clue what Crusoe was up to.</i></font>

740

00:53:57,462 --> 00:54:01,440
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Yep, as Pango would say,
he was bonkers to the max.</i></font>

742
00:54:05,347 --> 00:54:07,123
Are you coming along May.

743
00:54:08,152 --> 00:54:10,890
Can I have just a little peak?

744
00:54:11,192 --> 00:54:14,234
Can you just wait, I'm cleaning them up.

745
00:54:14,265 --> 00:54:17,411
Well could you at least tell
me how big a litter we have?

746
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:22,144
More than we'll ever
be able to feed, I'm afraid.

747
00:54:26,154 --> 00:54:27,526
You look kittie.

748
00:54:42,653 --> 00:54:43,830
That's smart.

749
00:54:44,257 --> 00:54:47,347
I'm trying to work here,
go eat somewhere else.

750
00:54:47,396 --> 00:54:50,200
At this rate, I'll never get this built.

751
00:54:50,236 --> 00:54:51,715
I told you, go!

752
00:54:53,242 --> 00:54:54,188
Ah, nevermind.

753
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:57,518
What I wouldn't give
for an extra set of hands.

754

<font color="#00ffff"><i>For all his pounding and sawing we</i></font>

755
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:04,168
<font color="#00ffff"><i>couldn't figure what he was actually doing.</i></font>

756
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,275
What is going on?

757
00:55:10,342 --> 00:55:12,344
Really?
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I couldn't blame Rosie.</i></font>

758
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,157
<font color="#00ffff"><i>When you got an itch,
you gotta scatch it.</i></font>

759
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,892
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The poor Crusoe he didn't see it that way.</i></font>

760
00:55:19,227 --> 00:55:20,438
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He has had enough.</i></font>

761
00:55:20,927 --> 00:55:23,838
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And that's when it hit me, a nest.</i></font>

762
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:26,547
Hey, guys.

763
00:55:27,175 --> 00:55:28,612
I've figured out what he was doing.

764
00:55:29,214 --> 00:55:30,215
Making an ass?

765
00:55:30,249 --> 00:55:32,011
No. His building a shelter.

766
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:35,165
We don't follow you mate.
He's building a nest.

767
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:38,135
A nest?
So he is a bird.

768
00:55:38,197 --> 00:55:39,267
Scrubs.

769
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,406
He's building a human nest in the tree.

770
00:55:44,209 --> 00:55:45,611
Pretty clever.

771
00:55:45,779 --> 00:55:48,160
I've never slept in a tree.

772
00:55:48,585 --> 00:55:51,627
If he stocks it with food,
you'll sleep in a tree.

773
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,062
Good point,

774
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,938
so guys, I got an idea,

775
00:55:55,163 --> 00:55:56,774
what do you say we help him out.

776
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,046
Get this nest of his built.

777
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:02,687
I must've been crazy, thinking
I can build all this by my...

778
00:56:03,214 --> 00:56:04,386
self.

779
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:08,299
<font color="#00ffff"><i>We didn't really have any
idea what we were getting into.</i></font>

780
00:56:08,722 --> 00:56:10,197
<font color="#00ffff"><i>We just figure let's help,</i></font>

781
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:13,030
<font color="#00ffff"><i>use whatever abilities we had
and hoped it all worked.</i></font>

782
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:16,417
I'll be gobsmacked.

783
00:56:19,279 --> 00:56:20,440
Slowly, slowly.

784
00:56:20,484 --> 00:56:23,858
Slowly, slowly.

785
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:26,795
That's it, just a little more.

786
00:56:27,462 --> 00:56:31,543
Hi Epi, where are you
headed with all that food?

787
00:56:34,443 --> 00:56:38,001
I need a little help here guys.

788
00:56:39,353 --> 00:56:41,333
Not that kind of help.

789
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,359
It tickles.

790
00:56:43,394 --> 00:56:46,509
Epi hold up, I'm starving.

791
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:49,041
Help.

792
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:54,380
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Things didn't always go smoothly
and we had our ups and downs.</i></font>

793
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:55,363
<font color="#00ffff"><i>That's for sure.</i></font>

794
00:56:55,416 --> 00:56:57,563
<i>But everyone was in fine spirits</i>

795
00:56:57,889 --> 00:57:00,113
<i>and Crusoe seemed.</i>

796
00:57:00,589 --> 00:57:01,993
<i>Well, happy.</i>

797
00:57:01,995 --> 00:57:05,737
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He made a funny little door for Epi
and Pango to get into the nest.</i></font>

798
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:08,000
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It was a pretty good idea.</i></font>

799
00:57:09,378 --> 00:57:12,520
<font color="#00ffff"><i>After a few modifications that is.</i></font>

800
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:21,630
<font color="#00ffff"><i>We became a real team, playing all
these funny games Crusoe came up with.</i></font>

801
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,387
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He had all sorts of crazy ideas
oh, and hide and seek in the ground.</i></font>

802
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:37,335
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Crusoe had a funny way of eating,
he peeled the fruit.</i></font>

803
00:57:37,564 --> 00:57:40,500
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And boy did he eat slow.</i></font>

804
00:57:44,515 --> 00:57:49,665
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It took quite a while but despite
his ackwardness and all of his flaws</i></font>

805
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:53,406
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Crusoe surprised even the
most skeptical among us.</i></font>

806
00:57:53,433 --> 00:57:56,000
That's it, that's it, watch your step.

807
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,782
I've just put the finishing
touches on our new home.

808
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,900
New home, hold it right there,

809
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,006
first thing we must do
is christen the place.

810
00:58:04,586 --> 00:58:05,429
It's good luck you know.

811
00:58:05,457 --> 00:58:07,495
I christen thee.

812
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,307
Oh, nevermind.

813
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:14,318
The preach is for us.

814
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:17,000
Now look at that.

815
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:20,400
It's so beautiful.

816
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,200
Hip, hip, hooray!

817
00:58:42,363 --> 00:58:44,500
What in the world is
that noise he's making?

818
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:47,378
Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food.

819
00:58:47,407 --> 00:58:50,712
It's painful mate, let's get out of here.

820
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:03,306
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.

821
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:10,344
A party and we weren't invited.

822
00:59:10,386 --> 00:59:12,457
Now, could you come here.

823
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:15,270
I'm starving here.
Coming.

824
00:59:20,539 --> 00:59:25,345
You know how difficult it
is in my condition to hunt right now.

825
00:59:25,582 --> 00:59:29,394
Have you tried to make
it to the other island lately.

826
00:59:29,424 --> 00:59:33,901
Oh May, you know the last time
I'd tried I almost drowned.

827
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:38,640
I'm afraid we're just stuck
with just the bugs and spiders.

828
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:41,251
They sound delicious.

829
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:43,604
Now go and hunt some up for me!

830
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:46,022
Right, darling.

831
00:59:46,223 --> 00:59:49,502
I'll wrap them in seeweed
just the way you like them.

832
00:59:54,506 --> 00:59:58,648
<font color="#00ffff"><i>With the nest completed,

836

That human sure has
made life peachy for us.

837
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:29,400
Rosie is sponsor to the max,

838
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:30,657
I tell ye old girl,

839
01:00:30,682 --> 01:00:33,416
if this new world talks about
this cuchie,

840
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:35,576
it might not be that bad after all.

841
01:00:36,524 --> 01:00:40,529
Getting a little plump aren't we,
sitting around all day?

842
01:00:40,565 --> 01:00:44,937
Ain't nothing wrong with
a few curves, Kiki honey.

843
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,720
With Crusoe doing the fishing,

844
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:51,606
it would put the superb in
you too in no time, Kiki.

845
01:00:54,022 --> 01:00:55,307
What do we have here?

846
01:00:56,022 --> 01:01:00,607
Looks like Crusoe is going to put
your fish and scales to shame, Kiki.

<font color="#00ffff"><i>As time passed, life became more

burning every night.</i></font>

851
01:01:23,651 --> 01:01:27,393
Another day and no ship
in sight little fellow.

852
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:29,693
What I wouldn't give to see
the sun set over the Thames.

853
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:30,839
Thames?

854
01:01:35,373 --> 01:01:36,485
Come on partner.

855
01:01:42,755 --> 01:01:43,782
I don't get it,

856
01:01:44,407 --> 01:01:46,926
why does he light this thing every night?

857
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:49,805
In the hope that some
other humans pass by.

858
01:01:50,263 --> 01:01:51,540
If they see the signal,

859
01:01:51,565 --> 01:01:53,129
they'll come and rescue him.

863
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:06,690
More humans on the island,

864
01:02:07,215 --> 01:02:08,605
that's not gonna happen.

865
01:02:17,725 --> 01:02:22,765
And now my friends, like all good
Englishman, a moment of silence.

866
01:02:22,835 --> 01:02:26,349
To give thanks for this bountiful harvest.

867
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:33,409
Mind your manners.

868
01:02:33,734 --> 01:02:35,047
Our host is...

869
01:02:35,092 --> 01:02:39,239
Taking a snooze at the peers.
Ye he, he, or worse.

870
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:45,583
Hey, stop fooling around.

871
01:02:50,757 --> 01:02:53,629
At least we're not out in that weather.

872
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:56,010
It's miserable out there.

873
01:02:56,234 --> 01:02:57,713
Listen you guys,

874
01:02:57,938 --> 01:02:59,785
we're meant to live in the weather,

875
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,750
have you'all gone soft.

876
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:06,083
Kiki, why get so worked up?

877
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:09,197
You haven's seen worked up,
answer me this.

878
01:03:09,627 --> 01:03:12,331
What happens to us when
Crusoe leaves this island?

879
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,006
Have you thought of that.

880
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,736
Kiki, now, now, listen!

881
01:03:15,973 --> 01:03:17,207
I'm listening!

882
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:20,404
I'm listening loud and clear, Mac!

883
01:03:22,787 --> 01:03:24,397
Shall we eat!

884
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,553
If I could just find me some mussels!

885
01:03:36,709 --> 01:03:39,853
One miscel little mussel.

886
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:44,093
It's mine, It's all mine,
mine, mine, mine.

887
01:03:49,874 --> 01:03:51,025
What´s yours!

888
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,335
Nothing.

889
01:03:52,545 --> 01:03:57,708
You wouldn't be depriving your family!
Now, would you sweetheart?

890
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:58,829
Yes.

891
01:03:58,995 --> 01:04:00,300
I mean no.

892
01:04:05,806 --> 01:04:06,808
Come here!

893
01:04:10,883 --> 01:04:12,905
Oh May, that hurts.
Shame on you.

894
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:17,605
Look, the ship is falling apart.

895
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,457
Our luck is turning,

896
01:04:20,682 --> 01:04:23,506
we'll be able to make it back
to the main island after all.

897
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:33,791
Hey, let's say we go outside and
have some fun on the water slide.

898
01:04:34,195 --> 01:04:37,875
Great idea, I love all
the smells after a good rain.

899
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:39,540
I'll catch with you guys later,

900
01:04:39,965 --> 01:04:42,526
I better find Kiki first,
make sure she's alright.

901
01:04:57,876 --> 01:05:00,727
Why didn't that ship
just vanish into the sea.

902
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,427
Our lives are never going
to be the same again.

903
01:05:18,985 --> 01:05:23,764
Show me that snack before
we move on to the main island.

904
01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:30,983
No!

905
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:34,236
Scream all you want little bird.

906
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:36,800
No one is coming to save you now.

907
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,197
I'll be the son of a seacook!

908
01:05:38,622 --> 01:05:40,258
Watch out children, is the human!

909
01:05:40,892 --> 01:05:43,163
Get your filthy paws off my bird.

910
01:05:43,934 --> 01:05:45,225
To the left!

911
01:05:45,326 --> 01:05:46,962
We have to get out of here quick!

912
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:51,000
Come on everyone!
We've got them surrounded!

913
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:52,995
Attack!
kaboom!

914
01:05:53,987 --> 01:05:55,907
Oh no!
He got me!

915
01:06:00,801 --> 01:06:02,245
If this is heaven?

916
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,275
Why are you here?

917
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,509
They're heading for the big island.

918
01:06:13,025 --> 01:06:15,835
They're everywhere!
It's all my fault.

919
01:06:15,864 --> 01:06:17,410
We have to warn the others!

920
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,974
Get to the nest, now!
Hurry!

921
01:06:24,882 --> 01:06:25,661
Predators!

922
01:06:26,086 --> 01:06:28,044
What?
Did he say predators?

923
01:06:29,892 --> 01:06:31,965
No. Hang on everyone, I'll get my musket.

924
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,908
Batten down the hatches!

925
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,298
Batten down the hatches!

926
01:06:48,523 --> 01:06:49,924
Weapons! Gun powder!

927
01:06:50,432 --> 01:06:51,405
Buckshot.

928
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:52,602
That's it juicy!

929
01:06:52,626 --> 01:06:53,626
Close the

930
01:06:58,883 --> 01:06:59,961
They're everwhere!

931
01:07:00,486 --> 01:07:01,488
Get off of me!

932
01:07:09,938 --> 01:07:12,076
You bloody blasterds!

933
01:07:33,484 --> 01:07:34,500
Help!

934
01:07:35,956 --> 01:07:37,900
Get me down from here!

935
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:41,298
I may not know humans,
but they tend to be very angry.

936
01:07:41,335 --> 01:07:43,781
Carmello! Crusoe needs our help.

937
01:07:51,988 --> 01:07:53,025
Look out!

938
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:06,628
Hurry Epi!

939
01:08:29,964 --> 01:08:32,069
Pango, over here!

940
01:08:32,402 --> 01:08:33,122
Jump!

941
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:34,781
Stand back Epi!

942
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:37,579
Hurry!
He's right behind you!

943
01:08:42,088 --> 01:08:43,468
Go! go!

944
01:08:46,197 --> 01:08:48,076
I need my musket!

945
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:53,327
Look what you've done.

946
01:08:53,652 --> 01:08:54,929
You guys stay put!

947
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,341
Oh not again!

948
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:01,587
Stay away you mange cats!

949
01:09:01,663 --> 01:09:03,263
Hang on Crusoe!

950
01:09:10,242 --> 01:09:11,518
Good job buddy.

951
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:30,362
Wasn't so bad!

952
01:09:32,221 --> 01:09:36,101
Keep puching!
I'll take care of these.

953
01:09:44,143 --> 01:09:45,145
Pango!

954
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,653
Is awful high!

955
01:10:02,214 --> 01:10:04,199
Come on, you can make it.

956
01:10:04,424 --> 01:10:05,127
Jump!

957
01:10:05,153 --> 01:10:08,134
Oh my here, here it goes!

958
01:10:14,171 --> 01:10:16,618
Good work!
Now, let's get out of here!

959
01:10:18,313 --> 01:10:19,160
Ok!

960
01:10:20,913 --> 01:10:22,060
So long, furrball!

961
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,287
Hungry hour, well then take that!

962
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:38,219
Hakawa, Matata, banana!

963
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:43,839
So long!

964
01:10:54,015 --> 01:10:55,425
Scrubby, the door!

965
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:03,011
Come on!

966
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:17,432
Hello there!

967
01:11:34,263 --> 01:11:35,834
Very glad Scrubs!

968
01:11:52,332 --> 01:11:55,378
Over here, Epi!
Hide in the bucket!

969
01:11:56,274 --> 01:11:57,753
Going up!

970
01:11:59,146 --> 01:12:00,518
Get off! Get off!

971
01:12:05,225 --> 01:12:07,364
Get off, you mengie cat!

972
01:12:10,435 --> 01:12:12,215
Good Work, Epi!

973
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:15,251
They'll never get me!

974
01:12:17,282 --> 01:12:19,161
We got rid of them, didn't we?

975
01:12:20,322 --> 01:12:22,302
Epi!

976
01:12:22,392 --> 01:12:23,638
Pango!

977
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:36,355
Help me!
Look up behind you, Epi!

978
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:02,801
Let go of me!

979
01:13:22,345 --> 01:13:24,709
The cats are trying
to get in through the hatch!

980
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:28,295
No. Rosie no, that was Crusoe!

981
01:13:29,325 --> 01:13:30,497
Let me get this open.

982
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:33,470
I hope you didn't hurt him.

983
01:13:34,335 --> 01:13:36,907
Everybody ok?
Everybody except Crusoe.

984
01:13:37,441 --> 01:13:40,422
Come on guys, all together, is heavy.

985
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:44,273
Spread out Rosie, we need all
the muscle we can mass bulk. Really?

986
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:45,461
Ok, ok.

987
01:13:45,491 --> 01:13:47,667
One, two, three!

988
01:13:48,497 --> 01:13:50,340
That's a bit of a bummer mate.

989
01:13:50,367 --> 01:13:52,670
We need Crusoe, how's he doing Kiki?

990
01:13:52,671 --> 01:13:55,675
He's alive, but he wont
be of any use to us.

991
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:59,357
We're gonna need a miracle
to hold on these cats back!

992
01:13:59,386 --> 01:14:01,457
Got it, the musket.

993
01:14:01,489 --> 01:14:04,008
Watch out guys, it's gonna be noisy.

994
01:14:04,395 --> 01:14:06,466
Are you sure that's a good idea?

995
01:14:06,499 --> 01:14:09,006
Is worth the try, what else can we do?

996
01:14:15,383 --> 01:14:18,455
This is going to be easier than I thought.

997
01:14:23,466 --> 01:14:26,379
The human's house,
time to make our move.

998
01:14:26,405 --> 01:14:29,333
Hurry, we can't hold them off much longer.

999
01:14:29,378 --> 01:14:31,517
He always pulls that thing to the back first.

1000
01:14:31,549 --> 01:14:33,700
Ok, get ready.

1001
01:14:34,921 --> 01:14:36,092
That's weird.

1002
01:14:37,294 --> 01:14:38,599
What's happening in there?

1003
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:48,470
Hey Tuesday, maybe this
thing has something to do with it.

1004
01:14:48,482 --> 01:14:50,009
What thing?

1005
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:26,400
Now what?
You know they're gonna come back.

1006
01:15:26,411 --> 01:15:29,338
Maybe Crusoe may come to and save us.

1007
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:32,411
I hate to break it to you guys,
we're on our own.

1008
01:15:32,436 --> 01:15:35,411
We have to get out of here.
Hide in some place.

1009
01:15:35,475 --> 01:15:37,352
What about Crusoe?

1010
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:40,451
Pango's right, we can't leave him here.

1011
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,711
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect.

1012
01:15:44,026 --> 01:15:45,822
But I think I got a plan.

1013
01:15:45,863 --> 01:15:49,277
Well you better lay it out
cause we're out of time.

1014
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,500
Alright children, calm down.

1015
01:15:56,519 --> 01:15:58,601
They just got lucky this time,

1016
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:02,558
we're gonna sneak up on
them and make them pay.

1017
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:05,373
Now let's show them what we're made of.

1018
01:16:07,204 --> 01:16:08,607
Oh, yeah.

1019
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:18,903
You got a broken wing, have you?

1020
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:22,600
Don't worry, we'll put you out of your misery.

1021
01:16:22,613 --> 01:16:25,584
Stay back, or I'll shoot!

1022
01:16:25,809 --> 01:16:28,200
Not so brave now, are you?

1023
01:16:31,454 --> 01:16:34,109
Appears your luck has just run out.

1024
01:16:49,557 --> 01:16:53,128
You'll have to be quicker than that, ratter.

1025
01:16:53,665 --> 01:16:56,246
Get him, he can't fly!

1026
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:15,506
That should take care of you quite nicely.

1027
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:19,017
Sweet dreams from your favorite ratter.

1028
01:17:23,657 --> 01:17:24,834
Get ready!

1029
01:17:34,613 --> 01:17:36,211
We gotthem cornered May.

1030
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:40,726
Then let's finish him off once
and for all.

1031
01:17:49,709 --> 01:17:51,689
Catch me if you can, ratter!

1032
01:18:04,316 --> 01:18:05,316
Hold on.

1033
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:08,281
Rosie stop, we have to wait for the signal.

1034
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:15,536
This is it, give it all you have Rosie.

1035
01:18:22,617 --> 01:18:24,017
What's going on?

1036
01:18:24,142 --> 01:18:26,623
They tricked us.
Hold on to your fangs.

1037
01:18:32,561 --> 01:18:35,304
We're not so cocky anymore.
Are we?

1038
01:18:45,753 --> 01:18:47,333
Tuesday is in trouble.

1039
01:19:09,668 --> 01:19:12,600
That was a bossus
plan you had there mate!

1040
01:19:12,607 --> 01:19:14,678
Couldn't have done it without you guys!

1041
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:18,395
The fire!
Crusoe!

1042
01:19:23,763 --> 01:19:25,174
Crusoe!

1043
01:19:26,802 --> 01:19:29,578
Over here!

1044
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:52,511
That must've really hurt.

1045
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:56,760
We boat Crusoe out to
safety unconscious, but alive.

1046
01:19:56,796 --> 01:19:58,673
And then out of the blue,

1047
01:19:59,298 --> 01:20:01,600
we get cannon blasted from your ship.

1048
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:05,110
The captain can be one tough bloke.

1049
01:20:05,612 --> 01:20:08,393
Expect!
They're pirates after all.

1050
01:20:08,618 --> 01:20:09,624
Pirates?

1051
01:20:10,421 --> 01:20:14,668
You know, like them nasty ratchets only worse.

1052
01:20:15,764 --> 01:20:17,739
A pack of crazed cats in my right,

1053
01:20:17,864 --> 01:20:19,600
I was sure I was a goner.

1054
01:20:19,707 --> 01:20:21,890
I took my musket in one hand,

1055
01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:23,402
my sword in the other,

1056
01:20:23,627 --> 01:20:26,243
and carved a swat to the savage hordes.

1057
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,203
It was horrible captain.

1058
01:20:30,696 --> 01:20:34,669
That is the most fantastical
yarn I've heard in all me life.

1059
01:20:35,104 --> 01:20:36,775
This is no yarn, captain?

1060
01:20:37,408 --> 01:20:40,920
So ye say, well then,
just trying to set sail,

1061
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:42,988
you and your bird can take a bunk below.

1062
01:20:43,253 --> 01:20:47,463
Oh, Captain, I cannot tell you
how I love to see England again.

1063
01:20:47,697 --> 01:20:49,000
England!

1064
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,583
We'll not be sailing from them ports,

1065
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:59,383
unless you want me to be
hanging from the gallows.

1066
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:01,534
Right dreamer.

1067
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:05,063
But you see, me... I must...

1068
01:21:05,899 --> 01:21:08,700
Can you at least drop me
from a bit closer to home.

1069
01:21:08,771 --> 01:21:10,508
You're with us now.

1070
01:21:10,842 --> 01:21:13,900
Once a pirate, always a pirate.

1071
01:21:14,315 --> 01:21:16,500
Have you got a problem with that?

1072
01:21:16,754 --> 01:21:18,522
But Captain, if I might.

1073
01:21:18,523 --> 01:21:20,470
Enough talk!
Off with ya!

1074
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,774
Then I'll be expecting
you in the carrier you lad,

1075
01:21:23,896 --> 01:21:29,574
or you will be walking the
plank you will or worse.

1076
01:21:35,008 --> 01:21:37,931
Look!
Is it a mirage May?

1077
01:21:37,996 --> 01:21:40,404
It's not another mirage you idiot.

1078
01:21:40,735 --> 01:21:44,979
It's a ship, children start paddling.

1079
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,700
♪ <i>I ply my trade from the Union Jack!</i> ♪

1080
01:21:51,761 --> 01:21:54,710
♪ <i>Upon the seven seas</i> ♪

1081
01:21:54,861 --> 01:21:58,710
♪ <i>Unless I eat some rancid.</i> ♪

1082
01:22:04,816 --> 01:22:07,797
Hey, give me here,
is my rum you're be drinking!

1083
01:22:07,855 --> 01:22:09,804
Oh! you want some rum! do ya?

1084
01:22:09,855 --> 01:22:12,004
How's me fisting ye instead.

1085
01:22:12,799 --> 01:22:14,522
These are some nasty pirates,

1086
01:22:14,547 --> 01:22:17,397
but it wont end well if
I stay another moment.

1087
01:22:21,052 --> 01:22:24,924
Hey, what you be fixing to do that?

1088
01:22:24,991 --> 01:22:27,320
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.

1089
01:22:27,694 --> 01:22:28,524
Is that right?

1090
01:22:28,749 --> 01:22:31,163
The ingrate we dawn rescue

1091
01:22:31,187 --> 01:22:34,139
from the island is trying
to steal one of our rowboats.

1092
01:22:34,341 --> 01:22:37,145
If pretty boy is going to be
stealing anything, I'd be us!

1093
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:38,660
No, I was just...

1094
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:45,111
Hey, what's going on out here?

1095
01:22:45,463 --> 01:22:47,802
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship!

1096
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:49,639
Get him in throne little prick.

1097
01:22:52,811 --> 01:22:55,654
Alright, let's teach him a lesson, take that.

1098
01:23:04,004 --> 01:23:05,775
He's getting away!
Grab him!

1099
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:08,175
Give me a piece of him!

1100
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:19,271
There's no way out of this ship you fool!

1101
01:23:24,975 --> 01:23:25,952
Get him!

1102
01:23:27,914 --> 01:23:28,984
He's mine!

1103
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:30,930
I'm ready!

1104
01:23:33,024 --> 01:23:34,833
A raft!

1105
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:49,583
Ye fools, shooting the wrong
side of the man, come on men.

1106
01:23:49,584 --> 01:23:51,090
Show me what are ye be made of.

1107
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:52,551
Bosun!

1108
01:23:52,976 --> 01:23:58,000
Get your scurby excuse for a
pirate down to my cabin, now!

1109
01:23:58,208 --> 01:23:59,845
Aye, aye, Captain, right away!

1110
01:24:02,016 --> 01:24:04,022
And the rest of ye fools!

1111
01:24:04,087 --> 01:24:09,093
Back to work, before I give
each ten lashes of me whip.

1112
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:10,678
Disgusting bird!

1113
01:24:14,671 --> 01:24:15,950
He's getting away!

1114
01:24:18,081 --> 01:24:20,118
Shall we send some men after him?

1115
01:24:20,119 --> 01:24:22,895
Neh, let him go.

1116
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:27,896
Oh, Captain, can't we fire a
cannon short blowthem his misery!

1117
01:24:27,933 --> 01:24:30,714
Why waste a good cannonball,

1118
01:24:30,939 --> 01:24:35,081
let'm spend the rest of his life
on that long forgotten island.

1119
01:24:35,983 --> 01:24:39,756
That is if a wild beast doesn´t get him first.

1120
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,067
Aye, aye, Captain!

1121
01:24:50,078 --> 01:24:52,391
It's been noice nawing ya Ruf.

1122
01:24:53,084 --> 01:24:57,032
We did ourselves a good run man,
didn't we Cec.

1123
01:24:59,931 --> 01:25:01,533
Jump!

1124
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:07,016
I wasn't going to let those ratters
get ya, we friends gotta stick together.

1125
01:25:07,078 --> 01:25:09,084
Nice for you to think so.

1126
01:25:09,094 --> 01:25:10,263
Where are we heading off to then?

1127
01:25:10,284 --> 01:25:12,463
