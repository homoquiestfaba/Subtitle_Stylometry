956
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:35,198
The bottom line is,
nothing happened last night.

957
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:37,243
Then why did
Catalina leave, Donald?

958
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:40,246
Apparently, she didn't
stick around for the part
where I said no.

959
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:43,597
<i>Miguel, let Oso get dressed.</i>

960
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:47,732
I will make some coffee
and then we can sit down
and discuss this like adults.

Hmm?

Get dressed.

963
01:08:56,044 --> 01:09:00,092
There's nothin' left to discuss.
I will go to Catalina
and talk some sense into her.

964
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,182
No offense, Miguel.
I think it might
be better if I went.

965
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:05,663
No! You've already caused
enough problems in this family.

966
01:09:05,706 --> 01:09:10,189
Donald is right. He is the
reason Catalina left. He should
be the one to bring her back.

967
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:12,496
No! I no longer trust this man.
He seduced my sister.

968
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:15,063
<i>I never touched her,</i><i>
Miguel.</i>

969
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:17,849
Don't get technical
with me, Donald.
We had a business agreement.

970
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:19,851
Nobody was supposed
to feel anything.

971
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:23,333
But that wasn't good enough
for you, was it? You had
to make her f-feel things.

972
01:09:23,376 --> 01:09:25,509
You planned this
all along.

973
01:09:25,552 --> 01:09:29,600
Ay! <i>Only fools</i><i>
plan to fall in love.</i>

974
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:32,211
Oh, it's true. Donald
can be a very foolish man.

975
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,779
<i>But he did not plan this.</i>

976
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:40,567
If anyone is to be blamed,
it is me. I placed
a curse on him.

977
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:43,440
Don't blame Broom Hilda here.
If anyone's to blame, it's you.

978
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:47,531
- My fault?
- Yes, you and your family.

979
01:09:47,574 --> 01:09:50,969
For reasons that defy
all logic, I've actually come
to like having you around.

980
01:09:51,012 --> 01:09:55,452
You're almost like a family
to me. And your sister,
Catalina, is a big part of that.

981
01:09:55,495 --> 01:09:59,456
- We're not your family, Donald.
- <i>We are all family.</i>

982
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:03,460
Miguel, why would it be so bad
if Donald and Catalina
have truly fallen in love?

983
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:05,897
I'll tell you, baby.
As a businessman,
Donald's got my respect.

984
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:09,509
Fine. I don't think
he's the kind of man
I want my sister to marry.

985
01:10:09,553 --> 01:10:11,511
<i>I hate to point</i><i>
this out, Miguel.</i>

986

You know what I mean.

987
01:10:13,513 --> 01:10:17,082
Married in the eyes of God.
As a true man and wife
by a priest.

988
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:20,128
<i>Why would it be so bad</i><i>
if they did become</i><i>
a real man and wife?</i>

989
01:10:20,172 --> 01:10:23,349
Because this man's
got no honor!
He married for money.

990
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:26,700
There's nothin'
left to discuss!
I'm going to Mexico.

991
01:10:26,744 --> 01:10:29,747
- No, Miguel.
 I forbid you to go.
- You forbid me?

992
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:34,186
Yes, Miguel, I forbid you.
You have been playing <i>el patrón</i>
with all of our friends.

993
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,842
Dictating how they should live
their lives and run their
businesses and I said nada.

994
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:39,583
<i>But no longer.</i>

995
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:43,630
This is our family. <i>Familia.</i>
And I will not keep quiet.

01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:46,851

- How about I bring back

- Okay.

I'll have your Aunt Cat pick out

Oh, Donald?
If you truly wish
to bring Catalina back,

you will have
to face your fear.

1017

to the United States

What? Do you really think of
Catalina as your little sister?
