1
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:40,274
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

2
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:46,053
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

3
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:47,748
I'll help you think this through.

4
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:50,156
I'll find somebody to help you
think it through.

5
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,492
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

6
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,330
Michael, I have great affection for you.

7
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:03,804
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

8
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,240
If you wanted to have me committed...

9
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:10,279
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

10
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:13,110
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

11
00:01:13,284 --> 00:01:15,252
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

12
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,820
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.

13
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:23,523
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

14
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:27,062
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others?

15
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:29,928
You think you got the horses for that?

16
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:32,831
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

17
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:38,235
The last place you want to see me
is in court.

18
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:40,908
I'm not the enemy.

19
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:43,438
Then who are you?

20
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:57,994
We find the seed.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,093
We shape the soil.

22
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,132
We speed the harvest.

23
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,243
We feed the planet.

24
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,718
We find the seed.

25
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,694
We shape the soil.

26
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:37,935
We speed the harvest.

27
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:41,366
We feed the planet.

28
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,454
What the hell is he doing?

29
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,739
We find the seed.

30
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:26,045
You've reached the voicemail of
Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

31
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:28,082
Please leave your message
after the tone.

32
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,047
Yes!

33
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:34,256
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

34
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:37,861
This is the moment you've been waiting for.
A very special piece of paper.

35
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,556
So let's have a big, paranoid,
malignant round of applause...

36
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:47,000
...for United Northfield Culcitate
Internal Research Memorandum 229.

37
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:50,437
June 19th, 1991.

38
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,335
"Conclusion:

39
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,172
The unanticipated market growth
for Culcitate...

40
00:03:55,346 --> 00:04:00,579
...by small farms in colder climates
demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."

41
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:04,421
Would you guys like
a little bit of legal advice?

42
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:07,456
Never let a scientist
use the words "unanticipated"...

43
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,719
...and "immediate"
in the same sentence.

44
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:12,726
Okay? Okay.

45
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:15,331
"In-house field studies
have indicated...

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,233
...that small short-season farms dependent
on well water for human consumption...

47
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:24,569
...are at risk for toxic
particulate concentrations at levels...

48
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:28,644
...significant enough to cause
serious human tissue damage."

49
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:31,213
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

50
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:34,715
...you don't even have to leave your house
to be killed by our product.

51
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:36,945
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.

52
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:40,252
- " Culcitate's great market advantage...
- Give me the phone.

53
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,326
...that it is tasteless, colorless
and does not precipitate...

54
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:46,156
...has the potential
to mask and intensify...

55
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,891
...these potentially lethal exposures."

56
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,864
Now, I love this.

57
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:52,935
Not only is this a great product...

58
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:56,801
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.

59
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:59,705
"Chemical modifications
of the Culcitate product...

60
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:04,076
...the addition of a detector molecule,
such as an odorant or colorant...

61
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:09,118
...would require a top-down redesign
of the Culcitate manufacturing process.

62
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:12,380
These costs,
while assumed to be significant...

63
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:14,354
...were not summarized here."

64
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:16,459
Which, loosely translated, means:

65
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:20,689
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...

66
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:23,993
...so could someone else
please make the decision?"

67
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:27,863
"Clearly, the release of
these internal research documents...

68
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:30,735
...would compromise
the effective marketing of Culcitate...

69
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:34,606
...and must be kept within
the protective confines...

70
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,873
...of United-Northfield's
trade secret language."

71
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:43,779
You don't need me
to tell you what that means.

72
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,352
Goodbye.

73
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,585
- It seemed to warrant my coming to...
- Yes.

74
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,025
You have to contain this.

75
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,998
- Contain?
- Right.

76
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,596
Well, that's my question.

77
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:06,707
What are the?
What's the option that we're looking at?

78
00:06:06,878 --> 00:06:08,709
Along those lines.

79
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,906
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't...

80
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:17,254
Well, I'm wondering
if there is some other option.

81
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:19,287
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

82
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:21,992
We deal in absolutes.

83
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,061
Okay. I understand that. I do.

84
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,667
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.

85
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,666
Well, the other way?

86
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:36,571
Is the other way.

87
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:42,969
- Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
- No.

88
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:46,639
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This is nothing to do with Don.

89
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:55,388
Do you think it's doable?

90
00:06:56,861 --> 00:07:00,126
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.

91
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:03,392
If the ideas don't look so good,
we back off, reassess...

92
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:04,899
Okay.

93
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,432
Is that, "Okay, you understand,"
or "Okay, proceed"?

94
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,978
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?

95
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,278
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?

96
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:24,648
- Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?
- Come on.

97
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:27,256
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!

98
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,991
Come on.

99
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:31,822
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

100
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:33,930
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.

101
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:37,394
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

102
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:39,502
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?

103
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,804
All right, Eddie.

104
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:47,274
Now, I did not make this myself
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.

105
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:48,878
Happy birthday.

106
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:50,810
You have time for cake?

107
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,579
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

108
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:54,740
You going in?

109
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,648
- I'm late already.
- Shit.

110
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:00,222
You're not both running out?

111
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:02,154
I got a situation.

112
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:03,987
- You can't hang?
- You're going in.

113
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:06,528
- Yeah. I got a shift.
- So do I.

114
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:09,666
Come on, man.
You haven't been up here in months.

115
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,769
If you go back now, Mickey,
Henry's staying here.

116
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:15,303
Good. You can drive him home.

117
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:16,906
Just stay for an hour.

118
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,272
The girls did all this stuff.

119
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:21,577
He'll be asleep by then.

120
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,543
Timmy's been calling me.

121
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:33,046
He's afraid to talk to you.

122
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:34,350
He should be.

123
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:37,119
- It closed out bad, right?
- Is that what he told you?

124
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:39,263
The kids are freaking out.

125
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,995
The in-laws are freaking out.

126
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,992
Pammy can't stop crying long enough
to start freaking out.

127
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:48,832
- She took him back.
- So what? Fuck her and the kids?

128
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,634
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's closed, okay?

129
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:55,506
I sold everything and we're still short.
So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.

130
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,738
I got my hands full.

131
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:00,617
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

132
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,911
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

133
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,320
- He's sick. It's a sickness.
- There's a fresh perspective.

134
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:12,759
I've seen a lot of people falling off
the wagon lately. It's going around.

135
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,526
Is that pointed at me?

136
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:20,565
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?

137
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:23,104
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

138
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:25,765
I haven't been in a card room
in 10 months.

139
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:29,003
I gambled on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

140
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,738
That was my big play, all right?

141
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:34,749
I put up my walk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.

142
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,513
Okay. Okay.

143
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,524
Cool down. I hear you.

144
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:47,488
I'd be pissed off too.

145
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:55,398
Just hang for an hour.

146
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,366
- Okay?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:35,075
Ready? And, lift.

148
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:37,576
Ready and go.

149
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,595
Wipe.

150
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,680
You better hit it.

151
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,614
We're good.

152
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,079
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

153
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:28,280
Dr. Mullien.
See if you have any more luck.

154
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,391
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

155
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,653
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.
I can pull the file...

156
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:35,694
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

157
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:38,128
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

158
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,894
- Take a night off, Mickey.
- You look tired.

159
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,061
- I'm okay. See you soon.
- Be good.

160
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:45,468
- All right. Bye.
- Bye, Hen.

161
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,336
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye.

162
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,752
- Uncle Timmy, hey!
- How you doing, Henry?

163
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,253
Henry, get in the car.

164
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,359
Good to see you, Hen.

165
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:10,026
- What do you want?
- I've been sober eight days now.

166
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,696
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

167
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,497
In front of the kid?

168
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:20,164
Mickey, please.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

169
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,771
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's all I think about.

170
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,578
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

171
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,209
Get Stephanie her tires back.

172
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:39,461
- Is he crying?
- I don't know.

173
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:41,459
Because of drugs, right?

174
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,427
That and everything else.

175
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:16,264
What?

176
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:19,899
Your Uncle Timmy...

177
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:26,064
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

178
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:30,272
I'm not talking about crying
or the drugs or anything.

179
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:33,539
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

180
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:38,484
And all his charming bullshit,
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...

181
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:40,849
...and I know you love him,
and I know why.

182
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:42,820
But when you see him like that...

183
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:45,755
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'll be for you.

184
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,488
You're not gonna be someone
that goes through life...

185
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:52,259
...wondering why shit keeps
falling out of the sky around them.

186
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,834
I know that. I know it.

187
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:56,300
Okay?

188
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:04,706
I see it every time I look at you.
I see it right now.

189
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:09,745
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.

190
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,784
Okay?

191
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,298
Hello?

192
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:41,214
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the loft downstairs.

193
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:46,013
They had water flooding from
his bathroom down to their place.

194
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:51,657
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything locked up pretty good.

195
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:56,161
It took our guys 10 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

196
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,100
There's pills all over the place.

197
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:05,966
Just the scene alone is
pretty definitive for suicide.

198
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,075
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

199
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:12,839
...who ran down these problems
he'd been having lately, so...

200
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,346
- Is there a note?
- No. They looked.

201
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:23,483
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

202
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,856
Can I get in there?

203
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,054
His place? Not now. It's sealed.

204
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:33,929
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

205
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:37,230
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

206
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,933
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicology report.

207
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:44,806
That's a couple of weeks at least
that it's gotta stay like that.

208
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:46,612
Sorry.

209
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,117
Sure.

210
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,380
Okay.

211
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,226
I know your brother a little.
My wife works the 190 out in Queens.

212
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,029
I'll tell him hello.

213
00:17:09,204 --> 00:17:11,229
If something comes in,
I'll get back to you.

214
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:13,472
Yeah. I appreciate it.

215
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:15,439
I'm sorry for your loss.

216
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,523
- Michael.
- Jeff.

217
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:38,165
This is tough.

218
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,925
Yeah, it is. He in here?

219
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,675
Dumb son of a bitch.

220
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:55,308
What a thing.

221
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:57,714
- Hold on.
- I don't even know...

222
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:59,786
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. All right.

223
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:03,186
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.

224
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:06,816
That crazy goddamn bastard.

225
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:10,354
What a waste.
What the hell was he thinking?

226
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:12,864
Marty? I gotta set this up.

227
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:14,559
Go. Go.

228
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,634
You okay?

229
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,135
Yeah, I'm fine.

230
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,468
Come on, let's get you a drink.

231
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:29,545
I just keep replaying all this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

232
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:30,946
Not a chance.

233
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,916
I just couldn't get through to him.

234
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:36,251
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a bull.

235
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:40,354
- Never happened.
- Why does he fold, then? Why does he?

236
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:44,262
It's gotta be an accident.

237
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:45,991
No, no. Arthur without a note?

238
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,137
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

239
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:51,568
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

240
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,970
One minute he's gonna
take on the whole world...

241
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:57,168
...and then 12 hours later,
he's sucking down pills. Why?

242
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,744
Why?

243
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,379
Because people are
fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"

244
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:10,713
Thirty years I know Arthur.

245
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,854
Good years.

246
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:18,560
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?

247
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:23,894
I can't even say, it's so awful.

248
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,701
You can say it.

249
00:19:29,244 --> 00:19:31,144
We caught a lucky break.

250
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:36,447
We did, didn't we?

251
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:44,592
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

252
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,488
- They accepted?
- In principle.

253
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:49,494
Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in half an hour.

254
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:52,565
I tried to explain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

255
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,634
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?

256
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:58,864
They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

257
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:03,737
You did what you could, Michael.
We all did.

258
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:06,478
It's...

259
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:08,309
It's what we got.

260
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:12,284
- You need a ride?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

261
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:46,075
Hello.

262
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:48,848
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

263
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:50,116
Who is this?

264
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,784
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

265
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,829
- You have got some nerve.
- Excuse me?

266
00:20:56,998 --> 00:21:00,798
You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?

267
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:02,795
This is not a complicated person.

268
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,804
This is a girl who's never been
farther than Milwaukee.

269
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,965
- Wait a minute. Now, wait.
- No, you wait.

270
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:12,375
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you call here again...

271
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:14,845
Are you telling me she's
in New York right now?

272
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,308
This is a young girl, do you hear me?

273
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,919
She's in the city right now?

274
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:21,646
What kind of people are you?

275
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,849
Listen. You just stay on the phone
one second. One second.

276
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,787
Anna.

277
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,686
Anna?

278
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:06,467
My name's Michael Clayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

279
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:09,297
I spoke with your sister.
She told me you were here.

280
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:12,470
Please open the door, Anna.

281
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:25,480
What are you thinking?

282
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:31,590
I don't know. I'll watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some details.

283
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:37,694
He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.

284
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:43,401
Just that when I got here,
he would pick me up...

285
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,937
...and show me, and I would see...

286
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,775
...that it was something
that would win the whole case.

287
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:54,846
Even this morning...

288
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:56,608
...I mean, I thought:

289
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:02,817
"Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

290
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:08,088
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now."

291
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:15,534
But it was there and he paid,
like, 800 dollars...

292
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:18,366
...for a first-class ticket.

293
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,007
And I just...

294
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,879
I got on the plane.

295
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,584
I believed him.

296
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:40,021
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

297
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:44,855
Let's say that he knew that you
told somebody else about all of this...

298
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:48,469
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

299
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:52,472
- But I didn't.
- You must have told somebody else.

300
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,198
No.

301
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:57,538
He made me promise.

302
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:03,416
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?

303
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:05,951
No.

304
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:13,660
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

305
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:29,275
- You talking about this?
- Let me see.

306
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:32,440
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

307
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:36,441
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

308
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:38,779
Well, nobody's gonna know
where it came from.

309
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,589
- Are you that jammed up?
- What are you talking about?

310
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:45,385
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

311
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,051
One of these guys you owe?
"Get me a seal."

312
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:49,856
You really wanna know?

313
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:09,405
This just gets better and better.

314
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,637
What are we doing?

315
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:15,326
Freeze!

316
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:18,233
Right there, asshole! Don't move!

317
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:20,670
- It's all right, I'm a friend!
- Get your hands up!

318
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:23,367
Get your hands up now! Now!

319
00:28:23,544 --> 00:28:25,478
- What's in your hand?
- It's a book.

320
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:28,514
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

321
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:31,982
- Turn around. Slowly.
- All right. All right. Okay.

322
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:33,984
- Who else is here?
- Nobody.

323
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:36,589
- I said, who else is here?
- Nobody's here!

324
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,157
Check in there.

325
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,259
You move, I'll take your head off.

326
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:16,563
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife...
Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.

327
00:29:16,731 --> 00:29:18,824
- Now I owe them both my balls.
- I'm sorry.

328
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,991
- You know I am.
- "Nobody will know it's me."

329
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,229
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?

330
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:25,770
It's bad. I know it.

331
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm 18 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

332
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:31,145
- You made your point.
- It's not a point!

333
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,678
- Who called 911?
- What?

334
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,916
The building was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very long.

335
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:39,519
Who called it in?
Does that make sense to you...?

336
00:29:39,687 --> 00:29:41,245
This never happened.

337
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:44,582
You got these cops thinking
you're a lawyer.

338
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,818
You got these lawyers thinking
you're a cop.

339
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:51,124
You got everybody fooled, don't you?
Everybody but you.

340
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,392
You know exactly what you are.

341
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,538
We tried calling you six times.

342
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:10,843
But your machine must be
busted or something.

343
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:14,177
We gave it our best shot.

344
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,014
We ran out of red covers.
We only had 2000 in stock...

345
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,057
...so we did the other thousand in blue.

346
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:42,972
Is everything all right?

347
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,379
It's fine, yeah.

348
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:48,146
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there...

349
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:51,382
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

350
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,789
I'll come back and pick everything up
next week.

351
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:56,020
- Seriously? Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

352
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:17,949
Hello.

353
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:26,323
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

354
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:28,191
What?

355
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,764
Do you know Michael Clayton?

356
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,429
Yeah, why?

357
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,370
We have a situation.

358
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:02,720
Hey, did they find you?

359
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:05,923
- Who?
- Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

360
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:15,439
Marty.

361
00:32:15,776 --> 00:32:18,973
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

362
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,137
- I need a minute.
- Yeah, well, we're late...

363
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,942
We never got to finish last night.

364
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:25,244
Did you close the place?
You look like hell.

365
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:28,479
- No, I left right after you left.
- Lf you say so.

366
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,352
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.

367
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:34,790
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

368
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:38,159
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.

369
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:41,267
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probably a mistake.

370
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:44,768
They're gonna pull together a memorial
service by the end of the week.

371
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:47,203
I told them to call you
if they need any help.

372
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:50,472
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

373
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:53,343
So we cut you a check this morning.

374
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:56,813
There's some strings attached.
And Barry...

375
00:32:56,984 --> 00:33:01,114
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.

376
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:07,326
What if Arthur was on to something?

377
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:09,156
What do you mean? On to what?

378
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,197
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

379
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,527
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

380
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:17,136
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.

381
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:20,240
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

382
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:22,399
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

383
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:25,306
What would they do?
What would they do if he went public?

384
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:28,880
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

385
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,484
We don't straighten the settlement out
in 24 hours...

386
00:33:31,652 --> 00:33:33,711
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

387
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:36,857
Then they'll pull out the video of
Arthur doing his flashdance.

388
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,753
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

389
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:42,589
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

390
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:45,425
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.

391
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,595
That's 80.

392
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:49,899
We're calling it a bonus.

393
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,763
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

394
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,567
That's assuming this all works out.

395
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:55,902
You're doing this now?

396
00:33:57,578 --> 00:34:00,911
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

397
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,949
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

398
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:06,211
It's gonna be bulletproof
and retroactive.

399
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:08,116
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

400
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:12,089
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

401
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,819
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

402
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:18,192
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

403
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:21,028
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

404
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:23,796
- Lf I'm wrong, I apologize.
- You're way the fuck wrong.

405
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:25,199
So there you go.

406
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:27,034
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

407
00:34:27,908 --> 00:34:30,069
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

408
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:33,743
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

409
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:37,078
- Don Jeffries is here.
- We're on the way.

410
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:41,981
Call Bob Nast.
Just see if they need help with this thing.

411
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,924
You're welcome.

412
00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:42,180
You said 12. This is 75.

413
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,510
Well, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?

414
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,550
No. I'm working.

415
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:52,516
So we're square, then. No bad blood.

416
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,388
You're just doing your job.

417
00:35:54,562 --> 00:35:56,029
That's right.

418
00:35:56,964 --> 00:35:58,693
Take it easy, Gabe.

419
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,065
Michael.

420
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:14,246
Check.

421
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,345
Check.

422
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:20,415
- Check.
- Half the pot. Two hundred.

423
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:21,885
Two hundred to go.

424
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,023
So, what happened with the bar?

425
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:03,220
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

426
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,483
What are you doing? You just got here.

427
00:37:28,656 --> 00:37:30,590
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.

428
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:34,922
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

429
00:38:10,698 --> 00:38:11,756
Get out.

430
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:15,260
Get out of the car now.

431
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:17,993
- Walter?
- Michael.

432
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,367
- Michael. Thank God you're there.
- Yeah.

433
00:38:24,778 --> 00:38:26,712
You have eight...

434
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:30,345
...six, five...

435
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,849
...four, three...

436
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,647
Get out of the car.

437
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:41,118
- Tell him to stay off the phone.
- All right. But you're on it?

438
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,162
Am I clean?

439
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,558
Just keep walking.

440
00:38:44,732 --> 00:38:46,962
You copy. Am I clean?

441
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:50,159
Just keep moving.
He's walking to the car.

442
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:54,265
- To let him know you're on the way.
I'll get back to you with the details.

443
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:56,875
- Just give me two minutes.
- I'll be in the car.

444
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:04,017
I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.

445
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:35,740
It's loose. I got a pulse.
He's up there somewhere, but...

446
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:39,452
Let's find a way to boost the signal.

447
00:39:47,027 --> 00:39:50,224
- I don't know what Walter promised you...
- A miracle worker!

448
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:53,628
That's Walter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

449
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:55,632
"I'm sending you a miracle worker."

450
00:39:55,803 --> 00:39:57,464
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

451
00:39:57,638 --> 00:40:01,165
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

452
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:08,881
We're up. Just got a signal.

453
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,106
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

454
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:36,469
Maybe he's lost.

455
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,440
- Wait a minute.
- That's him.

456
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:43,010
He was alone, right?

457
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:45,981
- Yeah, I think so.
- Call it, yes or no?

458
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:50,049
We gotta turn around.

459
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:21,914
Talk to me.

460
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:23,647
It's strobing.

461
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:26,224
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

462
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,634
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

463
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,176
- Where?
- He took...

464
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:47,647
- He took a left.
- I don't have a left.

465
00:41:57,624 --> 00:42:00,559
- East. He's southeast.
- What, so we missed it?

466
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,854
- Or the grid is wrong.
- Hang on.

467
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,736
- We gotta go back to one.
- One is what? Where's our one?

468
00:42:15,943 --> 00:42:18,935
Half a mile straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

469
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:28,447
It says we're closing.
But that's west. It can't be west.

470
00:42:28,622 --> 00:42:29,680
The signal or the grid?

471
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:32,587
- It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
- Goddamn it.

472
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,277
Give me the cell.

473
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,509
Our signal's good.

474
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:08,676
What?

475
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:13,013
Thanks, Mickey.

476
00:45:13,186 --> 00:45:14,847
Just get me out of here.

477
00:45:22,562 --> 00:45:26,293
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.

478
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:30,095
I think we should have someone from
the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell...

479
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,760
- Yeah?
- Did you hear?

480
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:34,463
- Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.
- No. Michael Clayton.

481
00:45:34,908 --> 00:45:35,966
What?

482
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:39,044
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was killed.

483
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,104
What?

484
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,614
Holy shit.

485
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:03,736
It has been and it remains
the U/North position...

486
00:46:03,904 --> 00:46:08,000
...that this lawsuit is baseless
and without merit.

487
00:46:08,175 --> 00:46:12,236
Our reluctance to negotiate
was anchored by this belief...

488
00:46:12,412 --> 00:46:17,577
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

489
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:20,311
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

490
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:23,945
The reason that we are
all here today is...

491
00:46:24,124 --> 00:46:27,992
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

492
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:33,432
You all have
a tentative proposal packet...

493
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:37,993
...which outlines the details,
but the bottom line is this:

494
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,935
Over the past several months
we had gotten word...

495
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:44,441
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

496
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:48,445
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

497
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:50,416
We also learned...

498
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:54,520
...that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees
were capped at 32 percent...

499
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:56,781
...up to 400 million dollars...

500
00:46:57,224 --> 00:47:01,456
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

501
00:47:01,628 --> 00:47:06,190
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

502
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:07,697
...in the middle there.

503
00:47:08,468 --> 00:47:10,163
Finally...

504
00:47:10,337 --> 00:47:14,671
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

505
00:47:14,841 --> 00:47:16,672
...and that the tax benefit...

506
00:47:16,843 --> 00:47:20,074
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

507
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:22,681
...and within this fiscal year...

508
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:28,719
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

509
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:33,420
The package that you have before you
represents, in my judgment...

510
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:38,661
...the strongest possible position for
our company under the circumstances.

511
00:47:38,832 --> 00:47:40,527
And, as chief counsel...

512
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,965
...it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.

513
00:47:45,038 --> 00:47:48,565
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.

514
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:51,006
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

515
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:54,402
Well...

516
00:48:17,537 --> 00:48:19,368
How'd it go in there?

517
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:24,604
Pretty freaky, huh?

518
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:27,747
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

519
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,548
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

520
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:38,818
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

521
00:48:41,995 --> 00:48:43,462
Got your heart racing, don't I?

522
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,757
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.

523
00:48:45,932 --> 00:48:47,297
What do you think I'm doing?

524
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:49,264
The suit's over. We have a deal.

525
00:48:49,436 --> 00:48:52,132
Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.

526
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:55,968
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.

527
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,337
I didn't realize you'd signed
all those checks.

528
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:01,810
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

529
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,313
I'm calling Marty.

530
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:05,849
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great place to start.

531
00:49:06,019 --> 00:49:08,817
Let's find out who told him
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

532
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,820
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

533
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:14,791
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt...

534
00:49:14,961 --> 00:49:18,397
- I know what you did to Arthur.
- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

535
00:49:18,565 --> 00:49:21,329
- I know you killed him.
- It's attorney-client privilege.

536
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:25,164
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

537
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:28,034
For such a smart person,
you really are lost, aren't you?

538
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,539
This conversation is over.

539
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:33,145
I'm not the guy that you kill.
I'm the guy that you buy.

540
00:49:33,313 --> 00:49:35,838
Are you so fucking blind
you don't even see what I am?

541
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:39,508
I'm the easiest part of your whole
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

542
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:42,947
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

543
00:49:43,123 --> 00:49:46,524
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

544
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:48,593
...and you're gonna kill me?

545
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:52,362
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

546
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:56,229
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

547
00:49:56,403 --> 00:50:00,237
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

548
00:50:01,741 --> 00:50:03,174
What do you want?

549
00:50:03,343 --> 00:50:04,867
What do I want?

550
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:06,637
I want more.

551
00:50:07,147 --> 00:50:08,910
I want out.

552
00:50:09,082 --> 00:50:11,710
And with this, I want everything.

553
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:14,714
Is there a number?

554
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:16,480
Ten is a number.

555
00:50:16,656 --> 00:50:18,681
Ten? Ten what?

556
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:22,217
Ten million?

557
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:25,831
Where do you think I'm gonna get
10 million dollars?

558
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,299
You know what's great about this?

559
00:50:28,468 --> 00:50:30,766
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

560
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:33,238
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

561
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:36,398
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

562
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,644
This would have to be
a longer conversation...

563
00:50:40,814 --> 00:50:42,941
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.

564
00:50:43,116 --> 00:50:44,606
Where? My car?

565
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:47,210
All right.

566
00:50:48,388 --> 00:50:51,414
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.

567
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,388
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

568
00:50:55,762 --> 00:51:00,529
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

569
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,431
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

570
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:06,697
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

571
00:51:06,873 --> 00:51:09,239
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don...

572
00:51:09,409 --> 00:51:12,003
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

573
00:51:12,178 --> 00:51:13,509
Karen?

574
00:51:14,214 --> 00:51:16,079
- One second.
- Everything okay?

575
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,439
Yes.

576
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:23,252
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. Immediately.

577
00:51:23,423 --> 00:51:24,549
- Yes.
- Say it!

578
00:51:24,724 --> 00:51:28,592
Ten million dollars, your account,
the moment this meeting is through.

579
00:51:28,762 --> 00:51:31,060
- Karen! Everyone's waiting.
- I'm coming, Don.

580
00:51:32,098 --> 00:51:33,463
You have a deal.

581
00:51:34,034 --> 00:51:35,296
You're so fucked.

582
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:36,966
What?

583
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,335
- You're fucked.
- What do you mean?

584
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:41,736
- Take a wild guess.
- Is there a problem?

585
00:51:41,908 --> 00:51:44,604
- I don't understand.
- Let me get a picture while I'm at it.

586
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:47,576
- You don't want the money?
- Keep the money. You'll need it.

587
00:51:47,747 --> 00:51:49,339
Is this fellow bothering you?

588
00:51:49,516 --> 00:51:50,744
Am I bothering you?

589
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:54,944
Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.
What the hell's going on? Who are you?

590
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:56,816
I'm Shiva, the god of death.

591
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,619
Ron! Ronny, I need security
out here immediately.

592
00:52:01,528 --> 00:52:02,790
All right. Here we go.

593
00:52:02,962 --> 00:52:06,159
That guy right there, stop him.
Grab that guy.

594
00:52:07,767 --> 00:52:10,497
- What are you doing?
- We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.

595
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,002
Come back with us
and we'll explain everything.

596
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:16,438
Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need
any medical attention.

597
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:18,770
You guys go into the ballroom.
Nobody leaves.

598
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:20,708
Have your guys cover every exit.

599
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,678
Will you please explain to me
what's going on here?

600
00:52:24,317 --> 00:52:25,682
Did you get all that?

601
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:28,047
Yeah. Got it.

602
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:34,524
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just gotta get some air.

603
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,184
Sure.

604
00:52:36,563 --> 00:52:39,327
Just stay close, okay?

605
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:40,727
Okay.

606
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:53,202
So, what are we doing?

607
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,271
Give me 50 dollars' worth.

608
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,811
Just drive.
