1
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,764
- Christina?

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,567
Is that you, baby?

3
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,541
- We want to play again.

4
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,076
- Give me my daughter back.

5
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:17,910
- No.

6
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,411
- I want her back.

7
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,119
- You invited us,
we want to play.

8
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,757
- I just wanted my
baby to get well.

9
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,126
- Her heart doesn't
work anymore.

10
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:38,864
- Just let me talk to her
and we'll play, please.

11
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,099
- Promise?

12
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,535
- I promise, just let
me, let me talk to her.

13
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,437
- Okay.

14
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,742
Mommy!

15
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:51,944
- Baby.

16
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,545
- Mommy, it hurts so much.

17
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,813
- Come here, baby.

18
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,116
- Why'd you do it to me?

19
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,385
- I just, I wanted
you to get well.

20
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,055
- You killed me, mommy,
they told me you killed me.

21
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,057
- No, no.

22
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,096
- She is dead, now we play.

23
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,205
This is not going to work.

24
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,542
- I love you, baby.

25
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,946
- You are no fun.

26
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,538
- Em.

27
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,174
Emily, Emily, wake up.

28
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,077
- How long was I asleep?

29
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,346
- Zach's acting a little weird.

30
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,747
- Is he okay?

31
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,150
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's
fine, but I think he...

32
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,551
- What's that smell?

33
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,186
- Shut up, woodrow.

34
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,022
- Jesse, how much longer?

35
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,424
- A couple miles,
we're almost there.

36
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,693
- You okay, Zach,
it's gonna be okay.

37
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:48,961
- Yeah, it's okay, buddy.

38
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:50,662
You know, sometimes i
wish I could just relax

39
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,198
and let it all go,
you know, right now,

40
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,934
I feel like I could
probably exploded.

41
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,070
- That's not fucking
funny, woodrow.

42
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,705
Stop being such a dick.

43
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,406
- Oh, come on, don't
be so tense, woman,

44
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,342
I'm just trying to make
it a little less awkward.

45
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,910
- No one finds it awkward.

46
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,044
- Okay, fine.

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,614
- Sorry.

48
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:12,951
- Don't be sorry, em, it's
okay, we're almost there.

49
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,576
- I'll be right back.

50
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,413
- My whole body is numb.

51
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,518
- Can you please help
me out with Zach?

52
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,622
- Hey, you don't need
to hesitate to ask me.

53
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,924
Come on, I'm here with you.

54
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,294
I love you.

55
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,463
We're gonna get
through this together.

56
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,698
- You promise?

57
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,136
- I'll get the wheelchair.

58
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,621
- Hello?

59
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,958
Hello?

60
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,040
What the fuck?

61
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,610
Hey, man.

62
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,648
Are you okay?

63
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:51,917
Whoa!

64
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,954
- Restroom's for customers
only, customers only.

65
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,238
- Dude, it's 10 in the morning.

66
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,874
- Happiness knows no time, son.

67
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,221
- Oh, no, I got it, i
got it, don't worry.

68
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,223
- Okay.

69
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,694
- Here we go, come on, buddy.

70
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:36,696
Come on.

71
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,068
There you are.

72
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,273
Do you need any help?

73
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,541
- No, I think I'm good.

74
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,009
- Good.

75
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,578
- Let's go get you cleaned up.

76
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,091
- What do you want?

77
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:10,095
- I was just wondering
if I could gas up.

78
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,165
- You got cash,
i just take cash.

79
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,867
- Okay, you got an atm?

80
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,771
- Sure, right in the back
next to the teleport.

81
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,474
- Yeah, come in.

82
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,313
- Hi, could we use
your bathroom, please?

83
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,115
- No, it's customers only.

84
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,951
- Just go, he's
drunk, it's fine.

85
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,498
- So, where you kids heading?

86
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,969
- Just a house up here
that my friends bought.

87
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,105
- Must be Dolores's old place.

88
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,740
Why do you wanna come here?

89
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:56,942
- It's a good question.

90
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,777
Listen, I just came
here to help my friends

91
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,745
fix their house,
but we gotta go,

92
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:04,683
so, yeah, if I could buy some
gas and beer, that be great.

93
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:05,685
- Oh, beer?

94
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,419
Yeah.

95
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,890
I got just what
the doctor ordered.

96
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,392
This is the best
homebrew in the state.

97
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,961
Billy's beer, boy.

98
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,875
- Hey, Jess, check it out.

99
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:33,812
So, this is apparently the
best beer in the state.

100
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,146
- Oh, sweet.

101
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,648
- And more great news,

102
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,083
weird guy in there does
this home delivery service

103
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,618
of his beer every Saturday,

104
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,687
today is Friday,
guess who signed up?

105
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,522
- You did.

106
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,689
- I did.

107
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,757
- Cool, man.

108
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,126
- All right, what's up?

109
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,461
- What?

110
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,763
- Come on, how is she?

111
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,431
- What, she's good.

112
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,700
- And you?

113
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,935
- I'm good.

114
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,471
Yeah, you know, ever
since we got Zach,

115
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:03,542
I'm watching a hell of a
lot more Internet porn.

116
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,113
No, she just has no idea
how to take care of him,

117
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,683
you know, so she really
hasn't been herself lately.

118
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,952
- I can't even imagine
what that must feel like.

119
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,454
- Yeah, it must
be awful waking up

120
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:20,392
in the middle of the night just
to check if he's all right.

121
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,893
- Yeah, there's that,

122
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,396
but I was talking about
not having sex for months.

123
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,297
- Fuck you, asshole.

124
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,032
- Oh, what, come on.

125
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,703
- No, it's all gonna
be over soon, so.

126
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,708
- How is she with the
whole institution thing?

127
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,611
- You know, she's
good, we're good.

128
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,314
By the way, guys, thanks for
coming all the way out here

129
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,449
and helping us move in,
we really appreciate it.

130
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:47,953
- Yeah, of course, man,
look, we got some fresh air,

131
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:51,990
we got some cold beer, we got
the birds squawking and shit,

132
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:56,227
you know, I feel like we're
gonna like this place.

133
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,931
- Welcome, welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

134
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,399
- Hey, man.

135
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,001
- Hey, name's Richard,
here on behalf of the city

136
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,004
to bring you the key to
this wonderful house,

137
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,740
that's yours, well, from now on.

138
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,877
- Okay, that's what I call
some small town hospitality.

139
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,647
- Yeah, now is it safe to
say that you are in charge?

140
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,349
- Oh, no, no, no, I can
barely take care of myself,

141
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,584
it's this lady right here.

142
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,551
- Hi.

143
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:56,054
- Come here, we're going in.

144
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:56,955
Good to meet you.

145
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,189
- Nice to meet you, too.

146
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,724
- Yeah, now just a
few little formalities

147
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,359
we have to go over here
before I give you the key

148
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,428
to this stunning palace.

149
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,165
Now, just need an
autograph right there.

150
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,133
- Okay.

151
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,367
- And now by signing that,

152
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,468
that states that you've
been met here by me,

153
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,804
Richard Alonso Jr. III, okay,

154
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,540
and flip it over, we
got part two here.

155
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,841
Okay, now one more
signature there,

156
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,376
and now by signing here,

157
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,679
also states that you've
been given the key

158
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,181
to this wonderful house.

159
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,382
Guys, guys.

160
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,617
- Thanks, Richard.

161
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,318
- Alonso Jr. III

162
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,653
- yeah, he knows it.

163
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,487
- Yeah.

164
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,722
- He already knows it.

165
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,223
And you know what, oh,
and let me be the first

166
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,959
to congratulate you folks
on this marvelous house.

167
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,728
Okay, and I'm not gonna
hold you any longer.

168
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,930
It has been a real
treat, it really has.

169
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,799
It's funny 'cause normally, i
take like one Adderall a day,

170
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,633
I took two today.

171
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,134
- Wow.

172
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,070
- I just, I'm so excited
for you kids, it's great.

173
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,304
- Just take care, bro.

174
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,839
- Yeah, oh, oh, and
guys, before I forget,

175
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,009
the previous owner left in a
hurry for personal reasons,

176
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:51,943
I don't know, I don't care.

177
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,178
I don't ask those questions,

178
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,479
but I just gotta
put it out there,

179
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,980
when the key was handed to us,

180
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,216
we didn't really have a budge
to hire a cleaning company,

181
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,086
so it's just pretty much left
as is which is even better

182
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,054
'cause you might find something
nice and valuable in there,

183
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,725
you never know, you never
know guys, this is awesome.

184
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,959
You guys enjoy, guys, okay?

185
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,394
- See ya.

186
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,296
- Wow, he's something.

187
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,332
- It's beautiful.

188
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,600
- Yeah, it is.

189
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,236
Yeah, everything's
gonna be great.

190
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,754
There you go, bud.

191
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,897
- Can someone check
the circuit breaker?

192
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,465
- Yeah, I'm on it.

193
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,101
- Wait, there's
someone over there.

194
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,170
- What the fuck is that?

195
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,877
- Oh my god, it's so freaky.

196
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,082
- Hey, I love this stuff.

197
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,922
- Stop acting like a kid,
can you go hide that thing?

198
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,757
- Let there be light.

199
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,994
Oh, wow, it's
actually not that bad.

200
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,329
- Not that bad, dude,
this is freaking awesome.

201
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,532
- You go get rid of that thing,

202
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,001
I'm gonna pick us a room out.

203
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,971
- Okay.

204
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,009
It's time to go,
i know, come on.

205
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,345
It's just that she's a
little hormonal at the moment

206
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,147
and I think it's gonna be best

207
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,818
if you two just don't spend
too much time together, okay?

208
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,053
Come on, why the sad face?

209
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:50,795
Okay.

210
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,232
You gonna like it down here.

211
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,407
You're not gonna needle these.

212
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,027
Fuck you, bubbles.

213
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:42,814
- Oh, wow.

214
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,417
Zach, it's your new room.

215
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,853
- Check it out, bud.

216
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:49,855
- So cool.

217
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,163
- Let's see here.

218
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,000
- What is this?

219
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,143
Oh my god.

220
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,579
She had a heart defect.

221
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,147
- Who you talking about?

222
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,149
- The little girl who
must've lived here.

223
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:23,021
- Hey, is everything
okay with you, bud?

224
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,957
- Oh, he's okay, i
think he's just tired.

225
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:26,791
- Okay.

226
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,626
- Let's put him to bed.

227
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,561
- Hey, baby, check it out.

228
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:34,299
I'm gonna knit us the
finest everlasting condom.

229
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,368
- Oh, Jesus, shut
up, come to momma.

230
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,705
- Oh, that's what's happening.

231
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,340
- I so want you right now.

232
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,409
- Okay, oh, yeah, I see.

233
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,611
- You want this right?

234
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,412
- Yeah.

235
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,579
- Yeah, okay.

236
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,050
Of course, you want this.

237
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,119
You know you're not the
only one who wants this.

238
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,054
- I want it.

239
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,188
- You're the only who gets it.

240
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,190
- Oh, good.

241
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,113
- Are you sure
it's okay to do it?

242
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,115
- What?

243
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,516
Of course, we need to do it.

244
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,719
- No, it's just, I don't
wanna damage anything.

245
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,420
- Don't worry, it's too small.

246
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,022
- Yeah, I know it's only small,

247
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,091
but what if it...

248
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,893
You know, what if it
feels me when I'm...

249
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,663
- I wasn't talking
about the baby.

250
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,833
- Oh, I see, you were
talking about my...

251
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,501
That's funny, you need
to watch your mouth.

252
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,170
- You need to watch your mouth.

253
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,444
- One, two, three.

254
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,883
There you go, can you move that?

255
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,787
There you go, buddy.

256
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,228
- Oh my god, they're so dirty.

257
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,899
- You know, I wanna be
a little dirty, too.

258
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,467
- I know, Jesse, I'm sorry,

259
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,702
it's just really
not a good time,

260
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,504
I need to give him
his medication.

261
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,905
- Yeah, it's never been
a good fucking time

262
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:21,739
since we got Zach.

263
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,940
- Jesse.

264
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,276
- What, look at him,
he doesn't mind,

265
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,812
he doesn't fucking mind at all.

266
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,481
- He might not make it
through another seizure, okay?

267
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,716
I don't know why you
think a little sex

268
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,153
is more important than
my brother's health.

269
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,754
You don't need to be here.

270
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,558
- We bought the fucking
house because of him.

271
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,096
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

272
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,600
Fuck, it's just, it's
been a long time.

273
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,938
- I know, I'm just not sure
I'm doing the right thing.

274
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,174
- Hey, of course, you are.

275
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,311
Okay, let's just
stick to the plan.

276
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,947
We'll go see the
doctor on Monday

277
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,850
and he'll show us that he'll
take much better care of him

278
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,118
than we ever could.

279
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,619
- I know, but he's
my responsibility

280
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,855
and he's my brother,
he's my only family.

281
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,657
- I know that, I know,

282
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,092
and that's why we
bought this house,

283
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,593
so we can be close to him

284
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,329
and still get on with our lives.

285
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,634
Oh, fuck!

286
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,839
Come on, you dirty, dirty dogs.

287
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,907
- It is time for a toast

288
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,477
to this house,

289
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,115
to old Billy,

290
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,250
and to you guys, my friends.

291
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,985
- Aww!

292
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:41,819
- Cheers.

293
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,821
- Cheers.

294
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,423
- Come on, em, chill
out a little bit.

295
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,626
- I have to give Zach his
medication, I really can't.

296
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,094
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,630
- Em, he's right, you know,
you need to relax a little bit.

298
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,931
- Yeah, drink with us.

299
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:54,765
- Come on.

300
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,600
- Come on.

301
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:56,834
- Do it.

302
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,803
- All right, just
a little party.

303
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,471
- Yeah, that's the spirit.

304
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,873
- I always wanted to ask you,

305
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,308
you know, how in high school,

306
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,745
girls always have a
crush on the hot teacher,

307
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:44,315
did you ever have any
students hit on you?

308
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,887
- No, no, no, no, no,
they were always too busy

309
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,490
with cool guys from their
class like that dude.

310
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,125
- Ah, yeah.

311
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:58,362
- I think you were the
biggest bully in high school.

312
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,167
- Fuck high school,
let's just drink.

313
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,468
- Cheers.

314
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,881
- I feel really good right now.

315
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,715
- Really?

316
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,883
- This is hot.

317
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,817
- Yeah, shit.

318
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,551
- It is, look at these two.

319
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,586
- Oh my god.

320
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,554
- Well, speaking of being hot,

321
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,156
you gonna keep that
fire going or what?

322
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,826
Well, they don't call me
Woody for nothing, I got it.

323
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,494
There you go, baby.

324
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,299
We're out.

325
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,869
We can use that.

326
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,309
What the fuck is this?

327
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,564
- Duer, buer, what's that?

328
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,871
- It looks like some
kind of religious symbol.

329
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,616
- We can heal.

330
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,620
- What religion, though?

331
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,989
- It's hard to say, I mean,
we don't know who lived here

332
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,524
or what they believed in.

333
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,896
- I believe in this.

334
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,303
- We can save you.

335
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,907
You are Zach, you're
body is useless.

336
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,479
We will.

337
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,783
No need to resist.

338
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,465
- Oh, shit.

339
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:18,035
Hey, guys, we have another
symbol on this board, and...

340
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,037
It says

341
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,305
sabnock.

342
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,775
- Okay, Wikipedia says
that buer is a spirit

343
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,212
that appears in the
16th century book goetia

344
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:32,116
where he is described as
the great president of hell.

345
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,617
- Oh.

346
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:37,555
- And that he's capable
of healing all infirmities

347
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,727
and then there's a list
of 72 different demons.

348
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,962
Yeah, what d'you say
the other name was?

349
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:45,964
- Sabnock.

350
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,700
And this one, this
one says gamory on it.

351
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,237
- Sabnock and gamory, yeah,
they're all listed here.

352
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,640
- All of this is
freaking me out.

353
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,542
- Guys, it's bullshit.

354
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,613
I can heal all
infirmities, with this.

355
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,985
- Man, we got a lot of
stuff to do tomorrow.

356
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,087
- We need to get rid of
all the creepy stuff.

357
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,624
- We'll do it, first thing
in the morning, okay?

358
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,994
- Oh my god, Zach's medication.

359
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:32,877
- Zach?

360
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,718
Hey, Zach.

361
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,165
Remember that prayer
mom taught us?

362
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,738
Now I lay me down to sleep,

363
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,474
I pray the lord my soul to keep,

364
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,812
if I should die before I wake,

365
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:10,548
I pray the lord my soul to take.

366
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,762
I just wish mom was here.

367
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,386
- How is he?

368
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:50,621
- He's really calm.

369
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:51,455
- Yeah?

370
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:52,289
- Yeah.

371
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,123
- Well, that's good.

372
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,125
- Yeah.

373
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,396
- You know what else?

374
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,198
Maybe some fresh air.

375
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,872
Maybe he'll actually get better.

376
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,673
- Jesse, he's not gonna better.

377
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,776
- Oh, I don't
know, you know why?

378
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:13,778
- Why?

379
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,481
- Love makes miracles happen.

380
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:19,917
Seriously.

381
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,418
- That's so cheesy.

382
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,187
- Oh, yeah, you know what
else makes miracles happen?

383
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,021
- What?

384
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,189
- Making love.

385
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,056
- Oh, yeah?

386
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,058
- Yeah.

387
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,623
- Fuck, fuck you, woodrow,

388
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,259
fuck, I'll kick
your fucking ass.

389
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,661
Baby, baby, don't
worry about it,

390
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,296
no, no, no, it's just woodrow
being asshole, please?

391
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:08,699
- Okay, no, I'm sorry,
goodnight, Jesse.

392
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,409
- Goodnight, baby.

393
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,288
- You were right about Zach.

394
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,290
- What?

395
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,628
- I need to take a lot
better care of him.

396
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:56,981
Jesse?

397
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Jesse.

398
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,255
Jesse, wake up.

399
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:19,731
Jesse!

400
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,399
Jesse!

401
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,670
- Oh, oh my god.

402
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:30,040
- You're okay, baby,
you're okay, you're okay.

403
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,042
- Zach?

404
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,954
- I'll be damned.

405
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,356
Hey, buddy, how
are you doing this?

406
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,392
Hey, hey, come on,
let's sit down.

407
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,727
Let's sit down.

408
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,629
- Fuck me.

409
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,966
- Emily, Emily, what
the fuck do we do?

410
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,336
Emily?

411
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,271
- What's going on?

412
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,506
- Go with her.

413
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,276
- Em, what happened?

414
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:08,779
- He...

415
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,518
He walked.

416
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,827
- He's freaking me out.

417
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:28,031
- Oh, that's the doctor.

418
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,568
Hey, how's it going?

419
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,402
- Good.

420
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,505
- Nice to meet you.

421
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:38,609
- Hi, Dr. waisenberg, I'm
Emily, very nice to meet you.

422
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,210
Sorry we had to
bother you today.

423
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,112
- No, this is no bother.

424
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,447
- This is Zach.

425
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,851
- I'm sorry I didn't get a
chance to pull Zach's file.

426
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,353
If I remember correctly,

427
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:52,790
he's suffering from spastic
quadriplegia, am I right?

428
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,424
- Yes.

429
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:58,228
- And you said that he
stood up this morning.

430
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,833
- Yeah.

431
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,104
- Let's have a
look at you, Zach.

432
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,944
Did you notice anything
unusual about his behavior

433
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:17,514
over the last day or
two, anything at all?

434
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,284
- He slept really
calmly last night,

435
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:22,686
but I forgot to give
him his medicine,

436
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,922
so I don't know if that...

437
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,724
- You forgot to give medication

438
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,693
to a patient with
spastic quadriplegia?

439
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,996
- Doc, come on, give
her a break, okay?

440
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:37,868
- Zach.

441
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:43,006
My name is Dr. waisenberg,
can you hear me?

442
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,078
I'm just going to listen
to your heartbeat.

443
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,152
There we go.

444
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,494
- Is everything okay?

445
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,465
- Did you hear that?

446
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,533
- Hear what?

447
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,290
- I've never seen
anything like this before.

448
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:36,994
- Well, what do we do about it?

449
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,228
- I'm gonna ask your permission

450
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,897
to take Zach with me
to the institution

451
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,498
and run a few test right now.

452
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,432
- Okay, I'll come with you.

453
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,334
- No, no, you can stay here,

454
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,169
you might just get in the way.

455
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,572
We'll keep our Monday
appointment as we discussed

456
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,107
and I promise I'll
keep you updated

457
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,075
and you can contact me anytime.

458
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:52,910
- No.

459
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:53,744
- Emily.

460
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:54,912
- What?

461
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,146
- Emily, come on, we've
talked about this.

462
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,581
We don't need to get
in the way, okay?

463
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,883
They're gonna take better
care of him, right?

464
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,184
- That's right.

465
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,454
We should get going.

466
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,031
- Everything's gonna
be all right, okay?

467
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,632
We're gonna go see him soon.

468
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:16,466
- Okay.

469
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,468
- Okay?

470
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,371
- Yeah, let's get to work.

471
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,157
Last one, man.

472
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,359
Looks good, bro.

473
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:46,296
- Yeah, at least I'll be
getting me some of this.

474
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,165
Hey, so where are the girls?

475
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,399
- What are you talking about?

476
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,501
They're doing what
they were made for.

477
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,071
- I wasn't made for this.

478
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,546
Em, it's gonna be okay.

479
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:03,747
- I know, I'm sorry,

480
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,817
I just have a really
bad feeling about this.

481
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,086
I just don't know if I'm
doing the right thing.

482
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,121
- I thought you hated
taking care of Zach.

483
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,957
- I don't hate
taking care of Zach,

484
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,426
I'm not very good at it.

485
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,795
I just feel like
Jesse's been talking me

486
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,597
into doing this stuff
i don't wanna do.

487
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,832
- What are you talking about?

488
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,868
Jesse's here for you,
he quit his job for you.

489
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,471
- Michelle, Jesse didn't
quit his job for me.

490
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,473
- What do you mean?

491
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:31,975
- He's taking an extended leave.

492
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:32,977
- What?

493
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,046
- One of his students,

494
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:38,315
her boyfriend taught
she was cheating on him

495
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,583
with someone from class,

496
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:42,519
and he brought a gun to school.

497
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,621
- And he shot her?

498
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,890
- And then himself.

499
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:48,725
- How did I never
hear about this?

500
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,795
- It's a private school,
they shut down the media.

501
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:52,863
- Oh my god.

502
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,234
- He doesn't like to
talk about, so don't.

503
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,271
- Okay, enough of the bad news,

504
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,706
why don't I finish up here?

505
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,442
- Yeah, I'll just go
start on the basement.

506
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,444
- Yeah.

507
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,714
- What do you think
about all that?

508
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:11,716
About Zach.

509
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,387
- I don't know, man.

510
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,457
I mean, I guess it's
a good thing, right?

511
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:21,291
- Right yeah.

512
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:22,293
- Yeah.

513
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,200
- You know I never
talked about this,

514
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,269
what happened to Emily's mom?

515
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:36,006
- Well, we think that she
fell asleep behind the wheel,

516
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:38,375
hit the center
divider with her car.

517
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,843
- And Zach was in the car?

518
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:40,977
- Yeah, yeah.

519
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,014
- How did he even survive?

520
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,149
- Well, when she
crashed, the car lit up,

521
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,985
this couple pulled over
in time to get Zach out,

522
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:52,389
but they didn't
make it to his mom.

523
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,491
The shitty thing is I think Zach

524
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,026
saw everything that
happened to her.

525
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,494
- Oh.

526
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:58,728
That's fucked.

527
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,264
I guess it's a good thing

528
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,067
that he doesn't understand
anything, you know?

529
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,135
- What are you talking about?

530
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:07,871
He has cp, he's not a vegetable.

531
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,943
Dude, you know nothing about
cerebral palsy, do you?

532
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:13,945
- No.

533
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,549
- All right, he understands
everything he sees and hears,

534
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,351
he just can't respond,

535
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,855
like his brain can't
control his muscles.

536
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,596
- God, you scared
the shit out of me.

537
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:40,598
- Sorry.

538
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,902
Wow, look at all
this creepy stuff.

539
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:49,139
I wonder what kinda
freaks lived here.

540
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,341
- Don't open that.

541
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:52,343
- Why not?

542
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,879
- I don't know, it's not ours.

543
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,014
- I wonder how much
more weird stuff

544
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,650
we're gonna find in this place.

545
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,087
What's that?

546
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,099
Fuck.

547
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:16,933
- Me.

548
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,969
- There you go.

549
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:20,804
- Oh my god, I feel
like such a dick.

550
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:24,140
- Oh, that would be
a first, wouldn't it?

551
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:27,944
- Hey, there's something
you guys should see.

552
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,649
- Look, this is extraordinary,

553
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,552
I've never seen
anything like it before.

554
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,855
This boy is going to
change everything.

555
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,764
- What the...

556
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,378
- I wanna go home.

557
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,247
- Baby, don't
freak out about it,

558
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:08,051
it's just some kids
playing Harry Potter.

559
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:12,088
- No, no, these are too
detailed for just some kids,

560
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,292
whosever doing this knew
what they were doing.

561
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:19,262
- Well, what about the
lady who used to live here?

562
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,597
- I don't know.

563
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,465
I think...

564
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,237
I think she was obsessed
with demonology.

565
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,705
- Demono,

566
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,307
is that a real word?

567
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:31,141
Did...

568
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,375
- shut up, man.

569
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:33,877
What are you talking
about, Emily?

570
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:36,479
- I mean, look around the house,

571
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,782
look at all these
signs that we found

572
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:39,784
and then...

573
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,886
I found this book downstairs

574
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:45,288
that kinda looked
like a spell book.

575
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,222
- Wait.

576
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:47,090
- Are you fucking kidding me?

577
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:47,924
- A spell book?

578
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:48,758
- Yeah.

579
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,427
- For what?

580
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,129
- I don't know, she
had a sick daughter,

581
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:56,132
maybe she thought it
could help with that.

582
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:59,469
- Okay, well, do we know
what happened to them?

583
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:01,104
Why did they leave?

584
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,774
- Maybe the doctor,
maybe he knows.

585
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,576
- Yeah, you know what,
that's a good idea.

586
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,078
I'll give him a call.

587
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,847
- It's okay, I'll call him,
i wanna check on Zach anyway.

588
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,042
There's still no answer.

589
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,310
What if something
happened to them?

590
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:43,546
- Emily, you gotta
relax, he's fine.

591
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,982
Okay, the doctor's probably
just a responsible driver

592
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:49,352
and doesn't wanna
pick up the phone.

593
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:52,188
- I don't get it, your brother
is finally getting better

594
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,591
and all you do is
complain about it.

595
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,126
- Wow, Michelle,
you don't get it?

596
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:57,594
- Yeah.
- That's weird

597
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:58,995
because you've never taken
care of anyone, but yourself.

598
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,130
- Okay, come on.
- Oh, really?

599
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:01,398
- Come on, girls, stop.

600
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,567
- Jesse, I wanna go
see Zach, please.

601
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,171
- There's no need to go.

602
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,514
- Oh my god.

603
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,315
What happened?

604
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,884
Are you all right?

605
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,253
There's blood on his shirt.

606
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,854
- Shit, hey, let's
get you inside.

607
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:27,524
- Come on, Zach,
well clean you up.

608
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:28,526
- Hey

609
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,896
- they're almost here.

610
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,872
- What's wrong with his eyes?

611
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,041
- I don't know.

612
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,446
Michelle, can you
get him some water?

613
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:50,448
- Yeah.

614
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,252
- Zach, you said
someone was coming,

615
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:57,821
who were you talking about?

616
00:40:57,823 --> 00:40:59,355
- What, wait a minute, did
you say he said something?

617
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:02,091
- He said that
somebody was coming.

618
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,827
I don't know what...

619
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,797
- Hey, hey.

620
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,866
- What is it?

621
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,540
- It moves.

622
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,976
So little.

623
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,914
Smaller than the
first one you killed.

624
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,416
- Shut up.

625
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,151
- Hey, you stay away from
her, you fucking freak.

626
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,153
- Zach?

627
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,089
What are you talking about?

628
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,891
- I'm so sorry.

629
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,993
- Hey, you need to
call the doctor again.

630
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,496
- Em, my phone's dead,
where'd you put yours?

631
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,232
- I don't know, it's over there.

632
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,245
- Guys, it goes
straight to voicemail.

633
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:57,413
- Man, there is some
really weird shit

634
00:41:57,415 --> 00:42:00,984
going on with this guy and we
need to do something about it.

635
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:03,219
Hello, what are you doing?

636
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:10,827
- There's somebody out
there, look in the woods.

637
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,696
- They're here.

638
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,665
- Zach, who's here?

639
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:16,799
- Who's that?

640
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:21,671
- There's more.

641
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,676
- Is this a joke?

642
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:29,078
I'm calling the cops.

643
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,513
- Jesse, I'm scared.

644
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:34,350
- Don't worry, honey,
everything's gonna be fine.

645
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,137
- Let's play.

646
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,540
Don't be afraid.

647
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,843
You can trust us.

648
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,312
Get rid of it.

649
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:41,684
Kill it

650
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:43,686
kill it.

651
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,528
- Who is that?

652
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,935
- It's the dude from
the gas station.

653
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:00,670
- Billy, what the...

654
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,074
- Old Billy's homebrew delivery.

655
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,846
Got your beer here.

656
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:12,782
- Oh my god, he brought
my fucking beer.

657
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,117
I'm gonna find out if he knows
about those assholes out...

658
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:14,951
- woodrow, wait.

659
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:15,785
- What?

660
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:16,787
- Look.

661
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,792
- Hey, hey, hey, hey behind
you, look behind you.

662
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:27,764
Holy shit!

663
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,068
- This can't be happening.

664
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,804
- What are those things?

665
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:36,039
- Go to the back, all right,

666
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,473
we need to get the
fuck outta here.

667
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:38,708
- Come on.

668
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,844
- What is that, why
is this happening?

669
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:45,782
- They're everywhere,
they surrounded the house.

670
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:49,118
- What are you doing, man?

671
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,353
- What do you think I'm doing?

672
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,522
I'm gonna break into
the fucking house.

673
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:55,558
- The pets will not come in.

674
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,660
- What did you say?

675
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:00,063
- They obey us, now we play.

676
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,168
- What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

677
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,004
- Your bitch kills babies.

678
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:09,205
- What?

679
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,674
- She's dying,
better go get her.

680
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,446
- Zach.

681
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,748
- Zach's not here.

682
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,417
- Who are you?

683
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:23,386
- We're Zach's friends.

684
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,421
- Oh, god.

685
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:27,423
- Help, help.

686
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,795
Help, help, help.

687
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,467
- Holy shit.
- - Oh my god.

688
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:38,735
- What happened?

689
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:39,969
- Call the fucking
ambulance now, go.

690
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,771
- I'll go get towels.

691
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,477
- Oh my god, baby,
what have you done?

692
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:50,113
Oh, fuck, it's okay, it's okay.

693
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,151
- Where are the phones?

694
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:02,825
Zach?

695
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,228
- They hate fire.

696
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,337
They didn't want
anyone else to come.

697
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,708
- Okay, did she call, did
she call the ambulance,

698
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,909
did she call 'em?

699
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:20,710
- Calm down, she's on it.

700
00:46:20,712 --> 00:46:22,311
- Okay, fuck, oh, fuck.

701
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,848
She was pregnant, she was
fucking pregnant, man.

702
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,383
She's gonna be fine, okay?

703
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:28,818
No, look at me, man,
look at me, man,

704
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,053
she's gonna be fucking fine.

705
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:32,555
- Those things outside

706
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:34,724
and what the fuck
is happening, man?

707
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:35,958
Fuck.

708
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,728
- I don't know, man, all
right, just calm down.

709
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,730
- I...

710
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,100
It's that freak's fault.

711
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:46,269
I'm gonna make him
fix all of this shit,

712
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,470
stay in here with her.

713
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:48,504
- You need to fucking
stay in here, man,

714
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:50,406
I can't fucking do this.

715
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:52,241
- Oh, shit, oh, shit.

716
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,978
Did you call the ambulance?

717
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,980
- No.

718
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,116
I'm sorry, woodrow.

719
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,685
- What are you
talking about, why?

720
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:08,524
Oh, no, no, no, my
Michelle, she's dying.

721
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:11,994
Oh, fuck, I need a first,
where's the first aid kit?

722
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,462
- We don't have one.

723
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:17,200
- Yeah, yeah, we gotta have
something, come on, where is it?

724
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:24,340
- You're okay, it's
okay, you're okay.

725
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,878
Woodrow?

726
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,113
- Please, don't scream.

727
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,329
- Oh, fuck, fuck, oh, shit.

728
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:48,965
I'm gonna take the car.

729
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,433
- No, please, woodrow,
don't go out there.

730
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:51,634
- No, I gotta do something.

731
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:53,102
- If you go out there,
you're gonna die.

732
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:56,505
- If she stays in
here, she's gonna die.

733
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,876
Your fucking brother,

734
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:02,478
your fucking brother
has to make them leave.

735
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,480
- No, no, no, no, please,
please, please don't hurt him.

736
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,449
- Make 'em leave,
you son of a bitch.

737
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:07,984
- Get off him.

738
00:48:10,622 --> 00:48:13,289
- She told us your secret.

739
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,492
- Michelle, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

740
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:20,663
- She told us your cock was
so hard when you were dancing.

741
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,399
- Michelle, shut the fuck up.

742
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,634
- Dirty Jesse.

743
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,071
Do you still want me?

744
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,707
You can have me, I'm all yours.

745
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,313
We will chop your
cock off, Jessie.

746
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,418
- Stay away from me.

747
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,656
- You have no guts, you cunt.

748
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,127
- Oh, fuck.

749
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,169
- You broke my heart.

750
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:02,338
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

751
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,173
- We think you're fun.

752
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:06,809
- Hey, hey, open
the door, Jesse.

753
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:07,810
- Get the fuck in here, man.

754
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:09,312
- Jesse, come on.

755
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:13,082
- Get the fuck in here, man,
just get the fuck in here.

756
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,721
- Kiss me hard before you go.

757
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,127
- Oh, fuck.

758
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:29,098
- Holy what, what did you do?

759
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,600
- She tried to fucking kill
me, man, she tried to fucking...

760
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,135
- Oh, no.
- Oh my god.

761
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,604
- She tried to fucking kill me.

762
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:37,707
I can't fucking see.

763
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:39,075
I can't fucking see,
man, I can't fucking see,

764
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:40,576
why the fuck can't I see?

765
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:43,312
Why can't I see, why, what's
wrong with my fucking eye?

766
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:44,981
What's wrong with
my fucking eye?

767
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:56,692
- Baby?

768
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:05,267
Okay, baby, we need to
take that out of your eye.

769
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,603
- Oh, fuck, it hurts so much.

770
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,105
- I know, I know.

771
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,676
But you still have to do it.

772
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:16,579
- Oh, fuck.

773
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:31,093
All right, let's just fucking
do it, let's fucking do this.

774
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,146
- You know everything,
don't you, you freak?

775
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,658
You made her kill our baby.

776
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,900
You should've died in
that car with your mother.

777
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,940
You're gonna pay for
what you've done.

778
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,714
- Just do it, just
do it, just do it.

779
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,016
- Okay.

780
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,089
- Stop, stop, stop!

781
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:53,142
- You're not gonna
hurt anyone else.

782
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,556
- I'm waiting for you, woodrow.

783
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,024
- What d'you say?

784
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:14,330
- I'm here, woodrow.

785
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:33,816
- Gonna take you to the hospital

786
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,751
and they're gonna take
care of you, okay?

787
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:36,753
- Okay.

788
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,323
- Oh, I'm sorry.

789
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,761
- I think my fucking
brain's damaged.

790
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:46,695
- Okay, okay,

791
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:47,663
- no, it's fucking damaged.

792
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,298
- You're gonna be okay.

793
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,533
- No, I'm not gonna
be okay, okay?

794
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:52,835
I just lost my fucking eye.

795
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:01,410
- Jesse, just tell me
what happened in there.

796
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,916
- I don't know, you know, I...

797
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:10,819
I was trying to stop
the blood, but...

798
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:13,222
You know, she suddenly
stabbed me in the face.

799
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:14,557
It wasn't her, though, you know,

800
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,392
she was all messed up,

801
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:18,327
she was talking different,

802
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:20,196
I didn't understand it.

803
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:22,298
- Well, what did she say?

804
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,867
- I don't know, it doesn't
make any sense, you know,

805
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:28,470
she kept talking like
Zach, she kept saying we.

806
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:32,308
- Okay, did she say why
she did what she did?

807
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,777
- Fuck, I don't fucking
know, all right,

808
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:36,745
I don't have answers to every
fucking question you have.

809
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:37,813
God damn it.

810
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,055
- Why are you acting like this?

811
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,525
Michelle is dead.

812
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:53,729
Woodrow thinks
it's Zach's fault.

813
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:57,967
I just need your support, okay,
please don't push me away.

814
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,705
- I'm sorry, okay, you know,

815
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,142
I'm just scared,
too, okay, you know?

816
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:08,344
- Yeah.

817
00:54:08,346 --> 00:54:11,814
- Hey, look at me, okay,
we're gonna be okay.

818
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,315
- You made me do this?

819
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,154
- No, no, no, no, fuck this.

820
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:53,088
No, I'm...

821
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,224
- I was just a little kid.

822
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,460
Why did you bully me?

823
00:54:58,462 --> 00:54:59,762
- I don't know.

824
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,364
I'm sorry.

825
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:04,099
I've changed.

826
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:06,235
I'm different now.

827
00:55:06,237 --> 00:55:07,703
- Do you know where suicides go?

828
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:08,937
- Oh, please, no.

829
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,506
- That's where I'm
waiting for you.

830
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:12,908
- No, please, stop,
man, I can't, I can't,

831
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,576
I can't take it anymore.

832
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:17,913
- Today will be the day you
pay for your consequences.

833
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:20,416
You condemned me to
burn in hell forever.

834
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:23,018
- No, no, no, no, Dennis.

835
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,788
Dennis, I'm sorry, please.

836
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,389
I, I didn't...

837
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:28,791
It wasn't my fault.

838
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:32,194
- Will pay.

839
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,037
- What the hell was that?

840
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,919
- Woodrow!

841
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:59,755
- Holy shit, what have you done?

842
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:00,757
Oh, fuck.

843
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:02,925
Hold his head.

844
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:05,728
I gotta get this outta you, man,

845
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,063
I gotta get this outta you.

846
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,100
Oh, geez.

847
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:12,334
- Oh my god.

848
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,535
- Hey, no, no, no, no,
don't, don't touch it,

849
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,003
stop, stop that, look
at me, look at me,

850
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:16,538
you're gonna make it worse,
okay, don't touch that.

851
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,475
- Let's put him in here.

852
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:21,310
- Move, I'll get him.

853
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,512
Fuck.

854
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,120
Oh, shit, no, no,
no, I can't move him,

855
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:32,955
look, look, I think
he broke his leg.

856
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:34,189
- Okay.

857
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,858
- Hey, hey, we gotta
get him to the hospital,

858
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,359
he's losing too much blood.

859
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:38,794
- Jesse, we can't go to the
hospital, we can't go outside.

860
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:40,362
Someone's out there.

861
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:42,231
Okay, Zach said they're
not gonna come in here,

862
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,566
so we just need to stay in here.

863
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,702
- Where the fuck is Zach?

864
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:51,273
- Oh my god.

865
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,309
Zach, what happened?

866
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:59,081
- I need them, Emily, they heal.

867
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,719
- They heal.

868
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:06,488
- What did he say?

869
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,624
- He said they heal.

870
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:10,259
- What's that supposed to mean?

871
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:11,794
- All the things on the
windows and the witchcraft

872
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:13,796
and the basement, it
has to do with the book.

873
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:15,330
- What book, Emily?

874
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:16,565
- The goetia, it talks about
being able to summon demons

875
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,467
straight from hell and...

876
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:20,102
People think they can help.

877
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,104
- Help how?

878
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,407
- Take over the
body and heal it.

879
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:28,143
- Come on, that's
fucking bullshit, Emily.

880
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:31,213
- Well, Jesse, that's what i
thought, too, but look around.

881
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:32,681
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

882
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:35,184
there has to be a logical
explanation for this,

883
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:37,119
everything has a
reasonable explanation.

884
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,488
- Okay, there's a
logical explanation

885
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,758
for Michelle ripping her body
open and trying to kill you,

886
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,228
and there's a logical explanation
for those things outside?

887
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,764
- I don't know, maybe it's a
fucking virus or something.

888
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:52,401
- Oh, it's a virus
that's making Zach talk.

889
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:56,271
Look at woodrow for god sakes.

890
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:00,843
- What about god?

891
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,245
- What?

892
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:04,446
- Well, where is he?

893
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:05,948
If all these demons
and hell exists,

894
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,050
that means god's out there
somewhere watching us,

895
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:09,952
well, where the fuck is he?

896
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,293
What d'you say?

897
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,664
- Your god is dead.

898
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,819
- Hit his head.

899
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,627
- Do you think he's...

900
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:53,662
- I don't know, em,
all I do know is that

901
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:55,130
if you're right about
this book and stuff,

902
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:56,932
it's just a matter of time
until one of us becomes that.

903
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,367
- No, just.

904
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:01,270
- They've all been hurt pretty
badly when turned and...

905
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:02,604
Fuck, em, look at me.

906
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:04,373
- No, Jesse, I won't
let them take you.

907
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,275
- No, no, look.

908
00:59:06,277 --> 00:59:08,176
If they get inside me,

909
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:10,445
don't hesitate.

910
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,419
- Jesse, get the pills.

911
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,489
- Emily, come on, i
don't wanna go alone.

912
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:21,890
- Jesse, please.

913
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,193
Okay, you're gonna be okay.

914
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:30,933
- Fuck!

915
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,502
Oh, shit.

916
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:54,923
Sarah?

917
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,695
- I was in love with you.

918
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,099
- No, don't say that,
that's not true.

919
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,235
- I trusted you,
you didn't stop him.

920
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,339
- No, that's not true, there
was nothing I could do,

921
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:12,307
it wasn't my fault.

922
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:14,443
- You let him kill me.

923
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:16,011
- I know, I froze,

924
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,080
I didn't know what to do.

925
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:19,982
I didn't know what
to do, I'm sorry.

926
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:22,050
- You were a coward.

927
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:25,954
You broke my heart, now
I'm gonna break yours.

928
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:33,595
- Zach, please stop, i
can't take it anymore.

929
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,836
Oh, Zach, I'm here with you.

930
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,740
- Jesse.

931
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:46,508
Jesse.

932
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:52,280
- I'm sorry, Sarah, I'm sorry.

933
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,488
- Jesse, no.

934
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,457
- Oh, what, she was just here.

935
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:03,692
- Who?

936
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,496
- Sarah, my student,
the girl that got shot,

937
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,331
sh was just here,
she was just here.

938
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,233
- No, Jesse, nobody was here.
- Yes, she was.

939
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,001
- No, that's just the demons
playing with your mind.

940
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,104
Jesse, none of this is real.

941
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:17,673
- I almost did it.

942
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,742
I couldn't control myself.

943
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:24,146
- Okay, come on, I think
i know how to stop this.

944
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:25,148
- How?

945
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:28,417
- The woman who
used to live here,

946
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:31,219
her spell book's
in the basement.

947
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,324
- All right, if this
lady summoned them,

948
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:38,927
there has to be some way
of sending them back.

949
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:41,596
- Yeah, must be something here.

950
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,811
- What a useless body.

951
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,125
- You promised me.

952
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:48,530
- You will be healed, but
the game's not over yet.

953
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,912
- Wait a minute,
what does it say?

954
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,648
- It says that these
things that are outside

955
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,216
they're called the guardians,

956
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:42,218
and then...

957
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,655
They're descriptions
of all the demons,

958
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:48,890
there's seven of them.

959
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:52,260
- Seven, does it say
how to defeat them?

960
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,965
- No, I don't think so.

961
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,835
- Let me see these.

962
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,475
- What is it?

963
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:42,911
- It says they can
only use your body

964
01:04:42,913 --> 01:04:44,980
if you let them heal it.

965
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:49,851
- That's why they make
you hurt yourself.

966
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:52,254
- Keep the house sealed.

967
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:53,889
- Sealed with what?

968
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,327
- I don't know,
there's nothing else.

969
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,663
- These symbols, Emily,
you've read about them,

970
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:03,565
what do they mean?

971
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,066
- These are from the goetia,

972
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:08,436
and each and every demon
has one of these symbols.

973
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,238
They call 'em sigils.

974
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,376
Oh my god.

975
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:19,781
The house was sealed
when we came here.

976
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:20,916
- The boards.

977
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,386
They're outside.

978
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:26,221
- Okay, well, we have to
make our own seals then.

979
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:27,289
- Okay, how?

980
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,225
- We need to figure out
which of these symbols

981
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:33,495
goes with the
demons she summoned.

982
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:35,330
- I remember the
symbols of the board

983
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,832
and the windows I pulled off.

984
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:41,770
It was sabnock,
yeah, it was sabnock.

985
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,311
- Did you just call us?

986
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:52,847
- Jesse!

987
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:56,751
Sabnock.

988
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:02,290
Please let us go.

989
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,759
- Oh, we can't stop the game.

990
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,230
- But I don't
wanna play anymore.

991
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,003
- You people are so much fun.

992
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:20,041
There is no premise,

993
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:22,677
your filthy nature is the game.

994
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,015
I'll play, please don't tell me.

995
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:30,418
- Each and every one
of you is a sinner.

996
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:36,624
Each and every one of you
will do anything to live.

997
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:42,764
We've played this
game so many times

998
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:49,337
and every time, we see people
killing their loved ones,

999
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,742
mothers slaughtering
their children

1000
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:56,811
and brothers betraying
their sisters

1001
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,280
just like Zach.

1002
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,416
And you?

1003
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:06,121
Well, you're not different,
you selfish bitch.

1004
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:31,946
- Jesse, he's gone.

1005
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:36,918
- I won't let them take me.

1006
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,721
- Oh, I'm so sorry, baby.

1007
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,222
- Zach, he knows.

1008
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,980
- I love you, baby,
I'll fix everything,

1009
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:08,416
just hang in there, okay?

1010
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,418
- Hurry.

1011
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,496
- You made the seals.

1012
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,801
- They told me
they would heal me

1013
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:30,538
- you knew what to do
all along, didn't you?

1014
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:36,911
- I had to watch our mom burn

1015
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:39,681
and I couldn't do anything.

1016
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:41,516
- I'm so sorry, Zach.

1017
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:45,220
I'm so sorry.

1018
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:50,525
- I just wanted to be normal,
i didn't want any of this.

1019
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:58,533
- And these signs, they'll
make the nightmare end?

1020
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:03,505
And what happens to
you when they're gone?

1021
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,674
- I don't care.

1022
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,943
- Okay, okay.

1023
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:42,977
- We told you everything
about us, Zach.

1024
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,885
Been trapped in his own body.

1025
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:56,157
You didn't know what
it's like to be loved.

1026
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:01,329
I thought you
understood what we feel.

1027
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,032
- I know

1028
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,502
what it's like to be loved.

1029
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,605
- Do you really?

1030
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,780
Emily.

1031
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:24,619
Now, we know your
filthy lover's secrets.

1032
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:33,428
Sarah, what a lovely
young cunt she had.

1033
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,898
- You liars.

1034
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,066
- Oh, are we?

1035
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:40,635
Think about it.

1036
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:43,538
He hated taking care
of your brother.

1037
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:47,609
He despised hearing you
whine every fucking day.

1038
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,247
Oh, Jesse, I can't right now,

1039
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:55,250
I have to give Zach
his medication.

1040
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,020
We're gonna get inside you

1041
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:01,256
and rip your fucking soul.

1042
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:08,931
You whore.

1043
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,767
We are the bornless
ones, we are...

1044
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,344
- I'm so sorry, Jesse.

1045
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:55,910
- Now I lay me down to sleep,

1046
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:58,646
I pray the lord my soul to keep,

1047
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:02,650
and if I die before I wake,

1048
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,386
I pray the lord my soul to take.

1049
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,592
You remember that
one, don't you?

1050
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,397
- Mom?

1051
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:23,504
- We were so alone
after you left us,

1052
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,573
just me and my baby boy.

1053
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:31,512
- I wish I was there with you.

1054
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,683
- Oh, I wanted that so
badly, too, but you won't.

1055
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,889
- I'm so sorry, mom.

1056
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:46,461
- It's all fine,
baby, it's all fine.

1057
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:52,066
That day I wanted me and
my boy to go together

1058
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:56,704
to a place where
everyone was happy,

1059
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,840
I wanted him to be happy.

1060
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:03,578
I couldn't watch
him suffer anymore.

1061
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,548
- I was so selfish,
i was so stupid,

1062
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,817
I just wanted a normal life.

1063
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:13,054
- I don't blame you,
i love you, baby.

1064
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:18,059
We can fix everything right now.

1065
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:22,163
We can all be together again.

1066
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,900
- What do you want me to do?

1067
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,338
- You know what to do, darling.

1068
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:40,047
You can end his
suffering right now.

1069
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,018
Be a good sister, just once.

1070
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:51,626
Good girl.

1071
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:56,030
We love you so much.

1072
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:05,039
- Mom, do you remember
what you said to me

1073
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:08,042
the last time we were together?

1074
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:10,111
- Of course, I remember.

1075
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:13,381
I told you how much I love you.

1076
01:14:13,383 --> 01:14:17,618
You and Zach were the best
things that ever happened to me.

1077
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:22,256
- You told me never
to give up on him.

1078
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:26,761
And I did.

1079
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,566
And I'm not gonna do that again.

1080
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:41,175
You're not my mom,
my mom's dead.

1081
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,313
- Don't say that, baby,
you're hurting me.

1082
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,315
- Fuck you.

1083
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,183
- You made me kill myself

1084
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:52,587
and now I burn in hell,
you ungrateful bitch.

1085
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:55,690
- My mom didn't kill
herself, it was an accident.

1086
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:58,292
- You want him to have
this miserable life,

1087
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:02,196
you can't take care of
him, you selfish whore.

1088
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:07,468
You think you're smart,
you stupid bitch,

1089
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:13,574
you're not going anywhere
because we won't let you.

1090
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:15,776
- Try and stop me,
you motherfuckers.

1091
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:19,113
- We can heal your
brother, he needs us.

1092
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,818
- He has me.

1093
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,125
- You are fun.

1094
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,185
- Zach?

1095
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,659
Zach, it's all over.

1096
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,995
They're gone now.

1097
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:08,997
- Emily.

1098
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,800
Emily, please help.

1099
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:13,802
Help me.

1100
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,105
Emily.

1101
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:19,107
Emily.

1102
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:22,743
Emily, please help, help, help.

1103
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:23,945
- Jesse.

1104
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:26,981
- Oh, oh, baby, it hurts so bad.

1105
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:27,983
Oh, oh.

1106
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,687
Oh, why'd you do this to me?

1107
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:35,022
- I'm sorry, I had no choice.

1108
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:36,757
- Oh, are they gone?

1109
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,629
Emily, please, please,
please stay here,

1110
01:16:41,631 --> 01:16:44,031
stay here, take it out of me.

1111
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:47,868
Please, baby, do it,
take it out of me.

1112
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:48,870
Please.

1113
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:57,311
- Oh!

1114
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:05,119
Oh, baby, everything's gonna
be all right, I'm here for you.

1115
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,956
- We need to play.

1116
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,157
- What?

1117
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,159
- We play!

1118
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:17,698
Such a pleasure watching you
creatures killing one another.

1119
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:21,502
So fun giving you the pain.

1120
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:25,072
No, don't be so selfish,

1121
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,808
the game is not over.

1122
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,790
- Zach, I don't feel my legs.

1123
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,344
- Come back.

1124
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,414
Don't leave us.

1125
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:08,816
You need us.

1126
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:11,886
We can heal.
