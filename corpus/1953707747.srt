1
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,788
Joe!

2
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,870
Joe! Joe!

3
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,399
You've been in there
for 54... 55 minutes, Joe!

4
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,554
Masturbation is fun.
I get it.

5
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,994
It's not very green to do it
with the shower running.

6
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,230
Jesus!

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,795
Bring your briefs
in there with you.

8
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,119
You're 1 5 years old.

9
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,350
It's not cute anymore.

10
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,788
Got his mother's fanny.

11
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,151
Your final was due
a week ago, Joe.

12
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,276
I mean, look...
Iook at the board.

13
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,508
School's over.

14
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,590
We're playing hangman here.

15
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,038
There you are.

16
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,716
Hey.

17
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,472
So, are you guys around tonight?

18
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,233
Because you should totally come
to Thirsty Thursdays.

19
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,390
-End-of-school tradition.
-Yeah. Yeah, totally.

20
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,356
-I'll... I'll be there.
-Cool.

21
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,193
So it's at Wolf's Pond,
whenever you...

22
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,997
Oh... my God.

23
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,036
Eat shit, Toy!

24
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,833
I can lend you a shirt.

25
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,512
I've got like five
in my locker.

26
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,556
You know what, actually,
it doesn't look that bad.

27
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,873
So, pregame at Paul's
at like 7:00-ish.

28
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,871
Paul has his own apartment?

29
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,753
What, you're not
going to acknowledge me?

30
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,910
-Hi.
-Mmm. Yeah.

31
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,275
Um, I will see you tonight.

32
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,918
Yes. Yeah, uh...

33
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,239
-Babe.
-Yes?

34
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,468
Let's go get egg bagels.

35
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,959
Okay. All right. Bye.

36
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,155
Paul. God.

37
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,110
I need a shirt.

38
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,678
That's awesome.

39
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,477
That is... that is great.

40
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,074
Actually, I need a picture.
Shit, can I get my phone?

41
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,593
Hey. Mrs. Keenan?

42
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,999
Shh!

43
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,470
Patrick,
why are you running around?

44
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,835
Oh... Grandma,
you remember Joe.

45
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,035
Hi, Mrs. Keenan.

46
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,678
Darling, would you
like a cold washcloth?

47
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,079
What? No. No washcloth.

48
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,832
How about you, Joseph?

49
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,195
Actually, yeah, I would...
I'd love a washcloth.

50
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,998
No, Mom, sit. What the hell?
What the hell is happening?

51
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,598
My mom reminds me of Blanka.

52
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,239
That's the sound I hear
whenever she speaks.

53
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,470
Just the gibberish
of an undisciplined animal.

54
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,959
It's never going to end.
Even when I'm

55
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,599
an adult, she'll find me,
question me.

56
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,033
You're being a little
dramatic, I think.

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,156
Joe, they're giving me hives.

58
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,355
There's no way
that they can give you hives.

59
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,470
Holy shit.

60
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,708
Hey, kiddo.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,310
Round two. Fight!

62
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,749
-What, Dad?
-Should be a stud here.

63
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,636
Oh, what's all this?

64
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,153
Carol's going to be here in 30.

65
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,991
-Go wash up.
-Uh, Dad, you know, um,

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,991
I actually just realized
I have a party tonight,

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,797
so I'm not going to be
able to make it

68
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,153
for dinner and stuff.

69
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,513
Sorry.

70
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,999
Too bad.

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,399
The plans are already made.

72
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,879
Your sister's driving
all the way in.

73
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,108
I'm making lamb stew.

74
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,599
Are we in Beowulf?

75
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,591
Look, after dinner,

76
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,559
I was thinking
we might bring back Game Night.

77
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,790
It'll be fun.

78
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,598
Game... Game Night's
a family thing, Dad.

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,591
I'm not going to play Game Night
with some spider woman

80
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,352
you found in the gutter.

81
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,113
Carol is not a spider woman
that I found in the gutter, Joe.

82
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,157
She's a very nice lady
who happens to like me.

83
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,912
And I like her.

84
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,871
So, we haven't played Game Night

85
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,552
since Mom died, and then,

86
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,472
all of a sudden, you meet
some floozy and expect...

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,357
Enough! Enough, Joe.

88
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,157
This is not a debate.

89
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,957
My house, my rules.

90
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,439
Now, go get ready.

91
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,512
So, Joe, your dad told me

92
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,748
that you go to Tottenville.

93
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,716
Are you on any teams?

94
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,598
Carol, before we go any further,

95
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,033
you should know--

96
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,632
Frank is not my real father.

97
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,471
I love him,
and I owe him a lot.

98
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,436
You know,
he's very special to me,

99
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,635
but he's not my blood.

100
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,039
Is that true, Frank?

101
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,519
That's completely untrue.

102
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,192
I'm taking Ventnor.

103
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,953
Frank, the lamb was delicious.

104
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,918
Just so tender and...

105
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,957
it was like I was
chewing avocado meat.

106
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm not sure I know
what you're saying, Colin.

107
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,397
Avocado meat.

108
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,998
Heather, do you remember
when Dad quit because, um,

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,911
you wouldn't trade him B&O?

110
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,831
-Remember that?
-Oh... oh, do I remember

111
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,718
when my own father called me
a "fear-mongering Chinaman? "

112
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,199
Yeah, I do-- mostly
'cause I'm not a man.

113
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,077
Nor am I Chinese, so...

114
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,593
Oh, my God, what a panic.

115
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,919
That's something
my great-grandfather would say.

116
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,148
He's a racist.

117
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,599
You do that often?

118
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,477
Eat the hamburger
and then the fries?

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,879
You don't...
you don't mix it up?

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,558
I don't know, Dad.

121
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,198
Just asking.

122
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,713
We watched a very good movie

123
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,994
on the cable last night.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,592
-Mmm.
-Oh, honey, what was it called?

125
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,919
It had that guy in it,
that actor...

126
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,955
-What was it?
-What's his name?

127
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,439
Called, uh, Heimlich, the...

128
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,112
Yes, yes! With, uh,
what's-his-name.

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,395
The Prince,
the... the New Prince.

130
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,436
Will Smith?

131
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,158
Will! Yes. Will Prince.

132
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,752
-Will Prince.
-Oh, my gosh, what does he play?

133
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,352
-Superhero? -Oh, he plays
a superhero in this one.

134
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,430
Kind of a supe...
Not a cape, though.

135
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,477
-Yeah, it's called Heimlich.
-The darnedest thing.

136
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,793
Come on.

137
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,279
You want to be my buddy?

138
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,316
Yes. I would love that.

139
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,958
Tennessee for Park Place.

140
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,995
Right now, straight up.

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,831
Done.

142
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,273
You got it.

143
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,350
What? No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

144
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,591
-The men are talking, Joseph.
Pipe down. -Yes. Quiet.

145
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,670
Quiet, everybody,
except for the men.

146
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,912
-We're in command of the room.
-This is bullshit, Dad.

147
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,434
You're pricing me
out of the goddamn game.

148
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,158
Your roll, JoJo.

149
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,434
This is collusion.

150
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,873
Dad, come on.

151
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,393
Yeah, it's kind of cruel, Frank.

152
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,992
No, no.

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,991
He's just mad because he
doesn't want to be here,

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,228
so he's being a little shit.

155
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,794
-Oh, great.
-Oh, no.

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,392
Joe, don't go.

157
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,516
He's quitting.
That's nice work, Dad.

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,919
He'll be all right.

159
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,319
Let him walk it off.

160
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,193
Patrick, have you been
washing that foot every day?

161
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,591
Because moisture can get trapped
in there from the brace.

162
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,033
That's what killed
Jim Henson, you know.

163
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,393
Oh...

164
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,279
What the hell
are we talking about?

165
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,508
Ooh, Patrick, can you whistle?

166
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,515
I like it when you harmonize
with me on the whistling.

167
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,670
-Patty, where you going?
-Got to go potty?

168
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,268
Oh, shit, he's doing it.

169
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,315
Joe!

170
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,156
Joe!

171
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,593
Joe...

172
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,953
Yeah, I'd like
to report a theft.

173
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,949
Goddamn it!

174
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,076
Yeah, his name is Frank Toy.

175
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,958
Brown hair, uh, height unknown.

176
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,996
I'll call you back.

177
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,277
You son of a bitch.

178
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,271
But...

179
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,120
The problem with Joseph's habit

180
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,350
is that one day there will be
an actual emergency

181
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,669
or violent crime
coming from this house.

182
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,717
Yeah, well,
the night is still young.

183
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,429
Uh, Mr. Toy, are you familiar
with "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"?

184
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,433
Yes. I experienced a childhood
on the planet Earth, so...

185
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,351
yes, I've heard of that one.

186
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,954
Do you think you can
apply it to my situation

187
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,791
in an allegorical fashion?

188
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,836
Okay. It's a...

189
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,229
-a story that involves
a boy who... -Ah, ah, ah...

190
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,356
-constantly cries "wolf."
-Stop.

191
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,396
And when the wolf finally
comes... He doesn't know it.

192
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,436
-I'm sorry, "The Boy
Who Cried" what? -Wolf.

193
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,954
-Fuck you.
-Let's go.

194
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,076
-"The Boy Who Cried" what?
-Stop talking.

195
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,718
-Wolf.
-Get the fuck off my porch

196
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,676
before I knock your dick
in the dirt.

197
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,638
-Come on, let's go. -I don't see
what the problem was.

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,631
-Why are you yelling at me?
-What's next? Three Little Pigs?

199
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,397
It gets easier.
Okay? Honest. I swear.

200
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,152
Look at it this way:
I n two years,

201
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,957
he's going to pay
for you to leave.

202
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,713
Yeah.

203
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,632
Uh, look,
this may sound desperate,

204
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,200
but I am 1 00% lucid, okay?

205
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,474
Don't smile, 'cause I'm...

206
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,118
-Don't.
-No, this is very serious.

207
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,270
-I am serious.
-I'm taking you so seriously.

208
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,430
I can be packed in 1 5 minutes.

209
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,079
Just take me with you
to Granville.

210
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,638
Please.

211
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,471
Okay, I would.

212
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,436
Totally would, but...

213
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,398
Dad would want to come
visit us all the time,

214
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,868
and that just
wouldn't work for me.

215
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,677
-You're lame.
-So...

216
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,669
-You're getting so handsome.
-Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,432
-I love you.
-Hey, don't you touch me.

218
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,396
You love it.

219
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,759
Oh, hey. Hey.

220
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,320
-What's up? -Okay, I am
going to get you a beer

221
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,719
so you can catch up.

222
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,551
Okay.

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,274
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

224
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,077
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

225
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,033
-What's up, dude?
-Hey.

226
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,678
How was, uh, fake family night?

227
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,908
Oh, it was great.

228
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,148
Nothing went wrong.

229
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,434
The police didn't come.

230
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,759
I love my father.

231
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,273
Shit.

232
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,270
-Okay, I have beer for you.
-Hey. Thank you.

233
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,998
-Hello. Hello.
-Hello, Kelly.

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,752
-How are you?
-I'm good. How are you?

235
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,512
I'm not as drunk as you are.

236
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,748
I think you are.

237
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,159
-Can I have your beer?
-No.

238
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,230
Hey, sorry, bro.
Keg's almost tapped.

239
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,753
No beer for freshmen.

240
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,591
Oh, but he is
a sophomore now, Paul.

241
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,079
Sorry, babe.

242
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,877
No dice, bro.

243
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,950
Oh, man.

244
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,032
You little fuck-suckers!

245
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,792
We're trying to sleep!

246
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,518
It's public property, bro!

247
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,748
What?

248
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,716
Who told you that?

249
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,711
We assumed!

250
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,992
I don't trust that old guy.

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,594
He has a shadow
behind his eyes.

252
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,114
How long have you
been standing there?

253
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,553
Hello.

254
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,118
That's not an answer.

255
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,194
You little shit dicks!

256
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,790
-Oh, my...
-Jesus! Let's go, let's go.

257
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,830
What the hell
are you doing, guys? Come on!

258
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,115
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Let's go! Let's go!

259
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,429
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

260
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,232
Hey, Joe, do you know we've been
walking for half a mile?

261
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,071
I can tell
by how much we've bonded.

262
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,310
Well, we're lost, and, um...

263
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,880
you haven't said a word
this entire time, so...

264
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,711
How much longer?

265
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,676
I have no idea, Biaggio.

266
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,117
Let's just keep our wits,
and we'll get out of here.

267
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,792
Where are we?

268
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,949
Someplace they won't find you.

269
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,675
What?

270
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,388
Let's go, man.

271
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,153
We got a long walk home.

272
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,919
Hello? Hi.

273
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,194
Hi.

274
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,270
I just wanted to make sure

275
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,396
that you didn't
get shot last night.

276
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,879
No. No, no, no.

277
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,711
I survived.

278
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,075
I, uh, wound up getting stuck
with that kid Biaggio, though.

279
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,310
Oh, yeah, I spoke to him once.

280
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,915
He told me that his uncle died
on the Challenger.

281
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,595
That's the price
of space travel, right?

282
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,192
Uh... yeah, sure.

283
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,988
Um, so get ready for this.

284
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,070
Paul skedaddled on me
last night.

285
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,038
Uh, wow, that's...
that's a dick move.

286
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,472
Tools-- out of the driveway now.

287
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,152
-I'm on the phone.
-Oh.

288
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,718
I don't give a shit.
Right now.

289
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,994
Is everything okay there?

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,070
-No!
-Who is this? Patrick?

291
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,992
-Kelly.
-Kelly. A girl.

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,753
-Jesus, that's
a pleasant surprise. -Dad...

293
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,991
Listen, Kelly, Joe can't talk
right now because he's grounded.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,991
He will call you back sometime

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,434
before his hot new bedtime
of 7: 30.

296
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,998
You have a good night.

297
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,399
Okay.

298
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,277
Tools. Now.

299
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,316
And if they're ruined,
you're going to work

300
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,038
the whole set off
this summer. I mean it.

301
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,678
A paper route.

302
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,159
Big Chief Indian Corn.

303
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,230
Goddamn Ohio Soccer Jazz.
I don't care.

304
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,356
You have your pick.

305
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,157
This bullshit ends today.

306
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,031
Yes, it does.

307
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,834
I can't walk
all day like this, Joe.

308
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,319
Okay.
We're almost there.

309
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,833
Just 50 yards.

310
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,159
Almost where?

311
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,388
What the hell
could you be showing me

312
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,674
in the woods right now?

313
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,399
What is this, Joe?

314
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,311
You want your room
facing sunrise or sunset?

315
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,594
My what?!

316
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,750
This is the site
of our new house, man.

317
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,398
What, like a tree house?

318
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,799
No, like a real house.

319
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,030
I'm moving out.
We're moving out.

320
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,439
What the hell are
you talking about?

321
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,668
My mom won't let me walk

322
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,238
around the house
without socks on.

323
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,639
She's definitely
not going to let us

324
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,993
Iive out here in the woods.

325
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,116
No one will
find us out here, Patrick.

326
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,190
This house,
this land, it's ours!

327
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,758
We make the rules, you know?

328
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,637
Like men!

329
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,631
So we're just going
to move out here

330
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,949
and, uh, build a house
from scratch?

331
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,995
How hard can it be?

332
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,558
Hold on-- what is this kid

333
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,312
doing here?

334
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,833
I don't know.

335
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,558
I'm afraid to tell him to leave.

336
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,835
I don't know
what he's capable of.

337
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,512
Forget him.

338
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,158
Break ground with me, man.

339
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,993
Look, I'm sorry, Joe,
but I can't do this.

340
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,031
Call me when you get home.

341
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,311
Patrick?

342
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,157
So you wore
the blue shirt today?

343
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,798
Not the one with the pocket?

344
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,311
-He's got the blue one on.
-Yeah.

345
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,436
Whoa, rope in
the attitude, mister.

346
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,759
This is your mother
you're speaking to.

347
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,716
-Come on, buddy. Come on.
-Huh? Huh?

348
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,188
-My word. -Sorry, Dad.
-Who is he doing a show for?

349
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,553
Oh, my gosh, I know,
it's like he's on camera.

350
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,993
Are there girls around?

351
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,638
Yeah, there must be. Uh-oh.

352
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,153
Girl check.

353
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,639
Checking for a girl in a bikini.

354
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,394
Nope. I don't see one.

355
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,231
Those hormones are a-ragin'.

356
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,349
Hello?

357
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,237
I'm in.

358
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,992
-What?
-The house.

359
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,115
I'll do it.

360
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,076
Yes! Yes! Holy shit! Yes!

361
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,593
Okay. Awesome.

362
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,397
Well, we'll break ground
tomorrow.

363
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,277
Yeah, right.

364
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,876
Hello?

365
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,153
Joe, what do you tell your dad
when you leave all the time?

366
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,594
If we were talking, I still
wouldn't tell him shit.

367
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,592
Jesus, what happened
between you two?

368
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,670
Nothing.

369
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,875
He's just an old, lonely prick,

370
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,552
and I want to get out of there

371
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,357
before I end up
anything like him.

372
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,351
Joe?

373
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,237
Can I talk to you for a second?

374
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,230
-You made this?
-I did.

375
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,958
Took very little time.

376
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,315
Very few days.

377
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,394
"My name is Jamal Colorado,
and I have kidnapped your son.

378
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,470
"He is unharmed,
and will stay that way

379
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,233
if you abide by
the following rules."

380
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,549
"Jamal Colorado"?

381
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,516
"Anfernee Texas"?

382
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,919
"D'Sean Utah"?

383
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,069
Yeah, I decided on the format

384
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,559
of Denzel Washington:

385
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,869
a black first name,
followed by a state.

386
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,871
Yeah, fuck that.
We're not using those.

387
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,474
Okay, Biaggio, good effort...

388
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,469
although very poorly planned out

389
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,393
and, um... savagely racist.

390
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,709
I just didn't want
to do nothing.

391
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,469
Dad, um...

392
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,869
I'm gonna spend the night
at Patrick's tonight,

393
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,472
if that's okay.

394
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,278
Okay, and make sure
you're in bed by 7:30.

395
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,236
I'll call the Keenans.

396
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,233
Freedom!

397
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,111
Fuck you, Frank!

398
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,912
Honey, I got
the classic ciabatta bread.

399
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,558
-They finally had it.
-You're getting wild.

400
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,993
-Sliced.
-Yeah.

401
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,638
-This is our big day.
-You're crazy.

402
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,675
We usually do rustic ciabatta.

403
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,432
I know it.

404
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,512
Mom, Dad, I'm going to spend
the night at Joe's.

405
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,317
Oh, okay, honey.

406
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,799
Well, I already made
dinner, though,

407
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,360
so take some vegetable soup
for you and Joe.

408
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,873
Uh, no, thanks.

409
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,438
No one likes
vegetable soup, Mom.

410
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,158
Well...

411
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,276
Okay, we're
in Pretendland, I guess.

412
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,032
"Nobody likes
vegetable soup."

413
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,712
-Did you hear this, honey?
-I heard it.

414
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,994
-Oh, my God.
-He's your son.

415
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,353
Listen, tell Mr. Toy

416
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,873
to put some white rice
underneath it.

417
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,029
It'll be delightful.

418
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,234
Mom, no.

419
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,593
No vegetable soup.

420
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,113
We're not eating vegetable soup.

421
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,439
I'm getting a Tupperware.

422
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,192
Here, take this tomato.

423
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,316
Jesus.

424
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,959
You okay, fatty?

425
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,188
No.

426
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,519
No, I'm not.

427
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,714
I-I'm really nervous.

428
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,073
We're really doing this, huh?

429
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,958
Yes, we are.

430
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,871
I've never done
anything like this, Joe.

431
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,233
It's starting to freak me out.

432
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,435
Well, uh, neither have I.

433
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,351
Kind of the point.

434
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,396
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

435
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,197
Just, okay, before I make

436
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,792
a big decision,

437
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,552
I always, you know,
say to myself,

438
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,357
"I'll do it unless God gives me

439
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,396
a definitive omen
in the next 30 seconds."

440
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,958
So, you know,

441
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,552
it's just some
dumb superstition I have.

442
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,835
If you don't want
to do it, that's fine.

443
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,193
But...

444
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,394
Do you want to?

445
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,992
Sure, yeah.

446
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,752
It's...

447
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,832
Yeah, so just like,
close your eyes, and yeah.

448
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,637
You got it.

449
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,398
Oh.

450
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,799
Okay, let's go.

451
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,949
Wait, what?

452
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,757
No, no, that was thunder.

453
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,034
Definitely a bad omen.

454
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,632
No, come on, that was thunder.

455
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,517
That's a tree. This is a rock.

456
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,158
Come on, man, it's nature.

457
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,071
It's not an omen.

458
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,479
Have some common sense.

459
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,959
-"Common sense"?
-It's not like a raven

460
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,393
told us to go away.

461
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,958
Yeah, we're doing this.

462
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,075
Oh, God.

463
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,595
Ready?

464
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,431
All right, let's unpack.

465
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,313
I came early.

466
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,594
Oh, shit.

467
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,716
Dude.

468
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,711
Oh, my God.

469
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,513
Fuck, yeah.

470
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,391
Patrick.

471
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,276
What the f...? Jesus.

472
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,236
-What time is it, man?
-Who cares?

473
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,559
We're out in the woods.

474
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,993
There's no time in the woods.

475
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,149
Let's go exploring.

476
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,798
-What?
-What?

477
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,155
Of course there's time
in the woods.

478
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,957
You go outside
and you look at the...

479
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,235
the sun, and the higher
it is in the sky,

480
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,878
the later it is in the day.

481
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,278
"We do swear,

482
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,396
"under pain of friendship lost,

483
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,072
"to never speak

484
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,275
"of this enterprise
to any adult,

485
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,077
"and to never betray
its location

486
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,594
"or its participants,

487
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,068
"and from this day forthwith

488
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,593
"to boil our own water,

489
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,592
"kill our own food,
build our own shelter

490
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,875
and be our own men."

491
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,080
All right, we need cool names
for everything.

492
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,116
Like, awesome, mythical names.

493
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,633
-No, we don't.
-Or, uh...

494
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,039
The Trees of Destiny.

495
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,792
Oh!

496
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,233
-No.
-No! The map!

497
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,992
Aah!

498
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,476
-So, Patrick's a wrestler?
-Oh, very good one.

499
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,959
-Yes, a good one.
-Very good wrestler.

500
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,315
So what's that,
Greco-Roman or arena?

501
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,548
Don't answer that.

502
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,676
Greco-Roman. What's arena?

503
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,113
Arena is pro.

504
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,190
Do you think
that Joe would run away

505
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,191
-to prove a point?
-Oh, hold on now.

506
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,953
We don't know
that they've run away.

507
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,951
I mean, there is
absolutely no reason

508
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,439
that Patrick would run away.

509
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,589
Not for Patrick to run away, no.

510
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,794
-Okay.
-You're right.

511
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,438
It's a classic kidnapping.

512
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,795
They took our children
and the canned goods and pasta.

513
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,995
All right, look,
I hate to admit it,

514
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,389
but Frank is right.
Right now, we have to assume

515
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,311
that these
are voluntary disappearances.

516
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,869
Wow. What do you know?

517
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,032
The police, always pushing
their pig Irish agendas.

518
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,075
Whoa.

519
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,308
Mrs. Keenan, I assure you,

520
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,594
there is no other agenda

521
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,999
than to find your son right now.

522
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,956
No. The Irish
are the blacks of Europe.

523
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,951
The blacks of Europe.

524
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,439
-Oh, my God.
-Period.

525
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,839
-That's powerful stuff.
-That's not...

526
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,239
Okay, wow.

527
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,071
Sweetheart, I'm Irish, okay?

528
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,911
We're under a lot
of stress, Captain.

529
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,114
I'm sorry about...

530
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,429
You know Patrick
was our only boy.

531
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,953
-"Is."
-Did you know that?

532
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,598
-Yes, I do.
-Did you?

533
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,828
I'm well aware.

534
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,115
Listen, according
to the report,

535
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,759
$80 to $1 00 in food
and housewares is missing.

536
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,355
From the Toy house,
we are down a tool set,

537
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,238
grill utensils
and about $240 in cash.

538
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,435
Now, I presume
we're not pressing charges.

539
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,595
Frank, would you like
to press charges against Joe?

540
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,274
Not at this time.

541
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,793
He took the Monopoly, too.

542
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,313
Obviously to spite me.

543
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,469
Maybe he just wanted

544
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,118
something to remember you by.

545
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,712
No way.

546
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,915
He hates that damn game.
Did you see him the other night?

547
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,195
Well, he used to love it,
you know,

548
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,918
when it was, like,
the four of us.

549
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,037
You're kind of shitting
on his memories, Dad.

550
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,156
Well, what am I
supposed to do, Heather?

551
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,470
You know, if I died, he'd get
over it in about six weeks.

552
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,758
Uh, sir, Chinese food is here,
so I would like to actually...

553
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,637
How much?

554
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,278
Uh, it's $51.

555
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,679
$51?

556
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,477
What the hell did you order?
Heather?

557
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,118
Don't look at me.
I got dumplings.

558
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,189
I'm not even hungry.

559
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,872
Yeah, I actually ordered a...

560
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,440
a large portion of the shrimp
with lobster sauce.

561
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,032
I figured it was pretty neutral.

562
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,519
We can eat it family-style.

563
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,839
-Neutral?
-Mm-hmm.

564
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,034
Shrimp with lobster sauce?

565
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,155
Yeah.

566
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,878
I can't think

567
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,599
of a more marginal dish
in any culture.

568
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,399
-Hi.
-Hey.

569
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,278
What's your name?

570
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,872
My American name is Gary.

571
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,791
You ever have one
of those days, Gary?

572
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,153
What kind of days?

573
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,798
The kind I'm having right now.

574
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,552
I don't know what kind
of day you're having.

575
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,959
Where you feel like somebody

576
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,518
is pissing in your face
all day long.

577
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,635
Is that good or bad?

578
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,468
-Bad.
-Bad.

579
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,155
Gary, every time...

580
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,593
You see those wontons, Gary?

581
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,158
-You see the size of them?
-Mm-hmm.

582
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,355
Those wontons are too big,
my friend.

583
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,396
Everybody loves those.
People ask us for the recipe.

584
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,072
We won't provide it.

585
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,957
It's part of our training--
how to deal with people

586
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,473
who want the recipe too bad.

587
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,072
-Oh? -We have a phrase
we have to repeat.

588
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,071
-What is that?
-"We won't provide it."

589
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,672
I can see the value
of these now.

590
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,671
I can have the kids
from the neighborhood come over

591
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,399
and bounce up and down on them
at a fucking party.

592
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,436
-Oh, sarcasm, I get it.
-It's like a bouncy house.

593
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,839
The poor man's wit.

594
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,751
My question for you, Gary, is:

595
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,469
How do you want me to eat these
with my normal human mouth?

596
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,392
Do you want me to unhinge my jaw
like an anaconda?

597
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,198
Should I put this in my belly
and lay out in the sun

598
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,270
-for two months, digesting it?
-Dad, enough! My God!

599
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,748
-Just pay the poor guy.
-My God. Yeah, and maybe

600
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,398
you should get
some forks in the house

601
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,119
so your dad doesn't have
to unhinge his stupid jaw to...

602
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,758
We're done here, and for
the record, your wontons

603
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,478
are way too big.
Nobody can fucking eat those.

604
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,118
No, I can eat them;
just give them to me.

605
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,839
-Good night, Gary.
-I'd be very happy to eat those.

606
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,115
Your house
has a bad vibe.

607
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,918
No more rice, no more pasta.

608
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,273
It's time to eat an honest meal.

609
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,793
Biaggio?

610
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,950
You and I will take
to the trees.

611
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,032
Patrick, you, uh...

612
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,439
Yeah, yeah, I know.

613
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,193
I-I pick berries and apples
and forage.

614
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,758
And it makes a lot
of sense, yeah.

615
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,157
Oh, what?

616
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,038
You should be the hunter
just because you're stronger?

617
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,155
Yeah.

618
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,556
Oh, don't...

619
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,913
don't drink the water.

620
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,638
Uh-uh,
I shouldn't have done that.

621
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,914
I'm glad you
came out, Biaggio.

622
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,399
I mean, this is...

623
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,072
this is our rite
of passage, goddamn it.

624
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,399
Have you ever felt

625
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,960
this at one with...
with yourself?

626
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,712
With your instincts,
with nature?

627
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,711
This...

628
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,199
this masculine?

629
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,634
I don't know.

630
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,553
I don't really see myself
as having a gender.

631
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,189
Is that a problem?

632
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,191
It's not great.

633
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,351
This way to the bison,
my friend.

634
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,198
When you get up here,
you can see a field of bison

635
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,794
majestically grazing.

636
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,518
Ooh, get your weapon ready.

637
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,511
Yeah.

638
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,509
Let's go, Biaggio.
Come on.

639
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,714
No, but the...

640
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,790
the quarter dark is so good.

641
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,916
Boston Market, that's...

642
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,230
that's from our old life,

643
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,356
our weak life.

644
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,510
Wait here.

645
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,158
What will it attract--
scavengers?

646
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,878
Scavengers? Look at this.

647
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,199
Fit for a goddamn king.

648
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,430
Are there any bears
in these woods?

649
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,159
Hope so.

650
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,958
A bear would feed us
for a month.

651
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,393
Perhaps we can disillusion him.

652
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,833
A bear who doesn't believe
in anything

653
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,035
will be easier to bring down.

654
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,753
I... I guess I agree with that.

655
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,194
Might be a little small.

656
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,680
One, two, three, four, five.

657
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,831
You have a tag on your pants.

658
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,915
Did you buy new clothes
for this?

659
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,990
It comes like that--
it's the style.

660
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,233
Yes!

661
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,798
Okay, come on.

662
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,791
No, the swords.

663
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,314
We got it.

664
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,311
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

665
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,912
Oh, God, okay.

666
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,353
Flip, flip, flip the thing,

667
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,079
and I'll, uh...
I'll take its life.

668
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,638
Strike it at its neck.
Don't compromise the meat.

669
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,631
-I know, I know.
-It may plead; don't listen.

670
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,200
-Be cold, clinical
with the blade. -I will.

671
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,269
It may try to bargain--
this is natural.

672
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,269
-Just turn it!
-Okay!

673
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,479
Yeah, I'm just surprised

674
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,710
you found a live chicken
in these woods.

675
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,915
Yup, yes, sir.

676
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,359
That's amazing.

677
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,070
Biaggio,
your corn pudding is to die for.

678
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,638
I have to know the recipe.

679
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,278
Mmm.

680
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,871
Oh, God.

681
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,632
So smug.

682
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,359
Dude, food attracts mice.

683
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,588
And you know what mice attract?

684
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,431
-Stupid fucking questions?
-No.

685
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,509
They attract snakes.

686
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,238
In Italian, the word for "snake"

687
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,151
means "the demon's cock."

688
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,355
-No, it doesn't. -There's
a chance that it doesn't.

689
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,349
Whatever, dude.

690
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,157
From here on out,

691
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,197
all the food goes either
in the fire or in the ground.

692
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,395
God, man,
you're so doom and gloom

693
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,436
all the time.
Just enjoy this.

694
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,998
It's not doom and gloom, bro.

695
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,958
I just found a copperhead
skin two hours ago.

696
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,269
I read once that animals
see fear as a color.

697
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,918
I thought you can't read.

698
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,911
No, I can read.

699
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,229
I can't cry.

700
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,277
Well, there you go.

701
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,591
Okay, we traced
Joe and Patrick's cell phones

702
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,589
to this bus.

703
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,352
Savanovic, Dietzel,

704
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,749
check under the seats,
see if the bathroom's locked.

705
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,875
This is an artist's projection

706
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,279
of what he might look like now.

707
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,429
The beard may be a little full.

708
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,192
They aren't here.

709
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,599
This is a waste
of real time, Davis.

710
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,433
You can check under
the bus if you want.

711
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,032
There's not a lot of air

712
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,031
that can make it
under there, but...

713
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,315
Listen to me. Our son ran away
about eight years ago.

714
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,276
-I'm sorry. Did he come back?
-So, he came back?

715
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,637
-Well, it was a really hard time
for us. -Uh, thank you.

716
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,596
Jesus, we don't need this
right now, sir. Are you okay?

717
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,158
-Uh, what does he mean?
-He doesn't mean anything.

718
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,752
-You need to lean on each other.
-Sir.

719
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,876
-Oh, my God.
-Get him back on the bus.

720
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,677
-Davis. -No, I don't want
to get on the bus.

721
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,272
I'm a licensed therapist!

722
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,838
This is Joe's bag.

723
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,308
It's empty.

724
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,911
-That's Patrick's phone.
-That's Joe's.

725
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,911
Some dude had a beeper?

726
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,148
That's dope.

727
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,355
W-Wait a minute.

728
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,634
What... what is that?

729
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,914
What does that mean?

730
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,831
It's a Monopoly piece.

731
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,070
My piece.

732
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,277
He's taunting me.

733
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,952
He's like the Zodiac Killer.

734
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,349
Okay, the worst thing you can do
is hope right now.

735
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,793
I'm just letting you know.

736
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,271
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

737
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,794
We have to do this for real.
Ready?

738
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,837
One, two...
a-one, two, three, four!

739
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,432
Cheers.

740
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,479
We have water, shelter.
We can put a balanced meal

741
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,552
on the table.
I mean, we answer to no one.

742
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,074
We're men.

743
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,071
Just now?

744
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,559
Just happened?

745
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,391
Just happened, man.

746
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,391
You don't say.

747
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,755
All I'm saying
is that if anything

748
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,876
was missing from all of this...

749
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,715
...it'd be a woman's touch.

750
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,915
We have Biaggio.

751
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,559
Doesn't count.

752
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,230
-Right here. Hey, hey, hey.
-Oh, what, what?

753
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,514
Hey.

754
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,476
-Hello.
-Got to get my drink on.

755
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,596
Hi. Do you guys want anything?

756
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,113
Uh, I got a Titleist right here.

757
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,918
It's worth like $3.50,
so if I could get

758
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,512
a Sun Chips and a beer
and then 50 cents

759
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,953
in change,
that would be fantastic.

760
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,793
Okay, well, we do not
run on a barter system.

761
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,554
What the fuck
is a "barger" system?

762
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,198
-Barter.
-Barger?

763
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,156
When you use equal goods
or services instead of cash.

764
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,673
So you admit that these
are equal goods

765
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,908
-in your barger system.
-Yeah, but we

766
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,194
do not run on a barter system.

767
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,428
That's not the point.

768
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,470
You're on the news, Joe.
Your dad was on K-1 9.

769
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,072
Okay, please.

770
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,152
My dad is loving
every second of this, okay?

771
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,469
No, Joe, I seriously doubt that.

772
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,879
So, uh...

773
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,234
...does Patrick have a really
big, crazy beard now, too?

774
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,515
Yeah, yeah, his is a little
more serious than mine.

775
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,556
I have... I have thin hair.

776
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,959
You know, you have to groom it.

777
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,279
Oh, right.

778
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,953
Yeah, like Paul's
sick-ass goatee?

779
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,996
Uh...

780
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,753
I guess you wouldn't
have heard--

781
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,194
Paul and I broke up.

782
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,872
Oh.

783
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,552
This isn't over, Kelly.

784
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,917
This isn't over, Kelly!

785
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,591
Uh... uh, no,
I did not catch wind of that.

786
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,513
Um...

787
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,953
I'm sorry, though.

788
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,749
I, uh, came here actually
to invite you to dinner.

789
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,797
Uh, sort of like a...
a housewarming thing.

790
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,438
-If you want.
-Yeah, obviously I want to,

791
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,192
but how do I...
how do I get there?

792
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,428
Do I have to...

793
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,078
be blindfolded or something?

794
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,957
In all seriousness, it's of

795
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,077
absolute vital importance
that you not tell anyone,

796
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,116
-not bring anyone. No one.
-Yes.

797
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,315
-This is life or death, Kelly.
-Okay, okay, okay.

798
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,117
Okay.

799
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,872
Bitch.

800
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,871
Joe.

801
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,236
Dude.

802
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,958
Biaggio.

803
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,030
You're camouflaged horribly.

804
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,678
Dude!

805
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,954
Where's Joe?

806
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,313
What's up, man?

807
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,469
What's up?

808
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,879
Have you seen Joe?

809
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,155
No, I don't know where he is.

810
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,559
But where's Biaggio?

811
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,312
You're right... Oh, God.

812
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,679
Okay, fine, fine.

813
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,999
We bought a few chickens.

814
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,638
Less than 30, more than 25.

815
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,039
But the fact is Biaggio and I

816
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,837
have been hunting and getting

817
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,592
pretty goddamn dangerous
out there.

818
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,238
This is hypocrisy.

819
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,754
Joe, listen to yourself.
How can you sleep at night?

820
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,553
Look, I can deal with the fact

821
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,709
that the chickens
were store-bought.

822
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,994
Okay? I can.

823
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,638
But it really bothers me

824
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,790
that the loaded potato
isn't Biaggio's recipe.

825
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,836
No. No, no, that
actually really is.

826
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,515
I... I honestly have no idea
where he's getting chives.

827
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,268
So, um, can I pass or...?

828
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,237
Judy keeps saying

829
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,595
that wherever they are,
at least they have each other.

830
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,880
I guess that calms me down
sometimes, you know?

831
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,875
I got to wonder
whose idea it all was.

832
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,154
Yeah.

833
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,556
Wait, are you serious?

834
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,879
It could have been
Patrick's idea.

835
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,233
No way. Oh, my gosh.

836
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,912
Joe is the one who drove them

837
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,399
to the movies
when they were nine.

838
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,913
Remember?
Only reason they got caught

839
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,956
is 'cause they went
through a drive-through.

840
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,793
Sunfish. Damn it.

841
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,509
Joe is the one who tied
Patrick's pet turtle to a kite.

842
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,397
Wanted to send him up
into space.

843
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,954
I forgot about that.

844
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,029
Are you laughing?

845
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,758
Are you laughing at that?

846
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,830
It was... it was more
of a laugh of admiration.

847
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,910
For the murder of a turtle?

848
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,229
The turtle died, then?

849
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,276
Yeah, the turtle died, Frank.

850
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,589
I suppose that's a shame.

851
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,478
The problem is
Joe's a mama's boy.

852
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,913
Clarissa was good for him.

853
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,433
She just let him be.

854
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,791
Something about his innate
sense of menace

855
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,392
seemed to charm her.

856
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,715
Now it's just the two of us.

857
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,473
I-I'm afraid I broke him.

858
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,119
I mean, our sons did run away.

859
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,874
They don't... they don't want
to be with us.

860
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,758
They don't want
to live in our houses.

861
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,311
I guess maybe... we did do
something wrong, you know?

862
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,675
What the heck?

863
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,033
Ah.

864
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,952
Patrick is the one
who set up Bicycle Olympics

865
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,030
in my goddamn swimming pool.

866
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,999
That was a nice
$1,300 repair job.

867
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,117
I never called you about that.

868
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,749
Thought we were having
a moment just then, Frank.

869
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,354
And Bicycle Olympics
was Joe's idea.

870
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,955
Goddamn it.

871
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,069
Joe, I love it here.

872
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,629
I want to spend the rest
of my days with you.

873
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,234
That's an emotional fact for me.

874
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,754
Yes, but...

875
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,468
But I worry.

876
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,313
I can't keep my brain
from worrying.

877
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,788
My...

878
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,756
my woman brain.

879
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,752
Ah, my sweet Kelly,

880
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,593
why should we let it
ruin this moment?

881
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,839
Joe!

882
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,432
It's time to come home.

883
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,789
Leave us, Frank.

884
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,756
The forest is ours.

885
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,716
You're out of your depth.

886
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,280
You made a fool of me
in front of the whole town, boy.

887
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,475
A harlequin.

888
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,552
He is a man grown, and his path
is his own to choose.

889
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,073
Silence, land-trunt.

890
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,752
You win.

891
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,352
Perfect.

892
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,590
Joe. Hey, bro, we got company.

893
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,955
Lots of company.

894
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,757
Hi, brother.

895
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,313
All right.

896
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,474
This is so great, Joe.

897
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,920
Yo, bros, what did you guys do
with this chicken?

898
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,512
Melts in your
goddamn mouth, right?

899
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,671
So, um, do you guys eat
the same thing every night?

900
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,159
Yeah, a lot of chicken.

901
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,149
They're everywhere here.

902
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,479
-Right, Joe?
-Oh.

903
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,913
All sorts of them.

904
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,353
Yeah, Patrick, um,

905
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,873
he usually takes care
of the gathering,

906
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,233
you know, berries, roots.

907
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,231
I take care of the meat
and the protein.

908
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,832
And the shopping.

909
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,400
He's a great bargain hunter.

910
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,709
I do the hunting.

911
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,679
So, Biaggio, what do you do?

912
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,273
I met a dog the other day

913
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,599
that taught me how to die.

914
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,715
Yeah, uh, Biaggio here,
he's a...

915
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,994
he's a real renaissance man.

916
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,592
I have incredible focus.

917
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,716
You should see his hands.
So quick.

918
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,836
This cat right here,
he can snatch trout

919
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,034
right out
of the goddamn stream.

920
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,029
Just...

921
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,234
Bullshit.

922
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,912
No, it's true. I've seen it.

923
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,910
I rest my case.

924
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,475
Did you take anything out?

925
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,630
No, he doesn't want your money.

926
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,959
He just does it for sport.

927
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,188
You know, um,

928
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,272
I picked those flowers myself.

929
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,316
Oh, yeah.
They're really pretty.

930
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,351
So what is
this all supposed to be?

931
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,112
This is the den.

932
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,553
Oh, this is the den.

933
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,754
How stupid of me.

934
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,677
Um, and that...

935
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,114
that is the master bedroom.

936
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,669
Wow.

937
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,716
This is really amazing, Joe.

938
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,998
I mean, I had no idea
how talented you were.

939
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,592
I mean, of course,
I suspected, but...

940
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,352
-Of course. Right.
-Of course.

941
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,153
That's horrible.

942
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,751
Yeah. Uh...

943
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,712
Vicki's making eyes at you, man.

944
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,872
Go talk to her. Look at her.

945
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,438
She's so into it.

946
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,876
There's no point
in me talking to her anyways.

947
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,110
Why not?

948
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,111
Joe...

949
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,791
I'm gay.

950
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,918
Are you sure? Um...

951
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,877
Yes.

952
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,872
My lungs fill up with fluid
every time the seasons change.

953
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,831
That's not being gay, Biaggio.

954
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,637
What?

955
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,676
I'm pretty sure
that's cystic fibrosis.

956
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,159
Oh.

957
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,991
Biaggio, I don't know why

958
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,833
you're smiling-- cystic fibrosis
is not a walk in the park.

959
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,398
It's actually
a very serious medical...

960
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,517
Hey, what-what about Kelly?

961
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,717
She's just doing what...
all girls do.

962
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,039
You know?

963
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,190
Pretending like
she doesn't care.

964
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,475
Playing hard to get.
I don't know.

965
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,911
Oh, man.

966
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,431
Hey.

967
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,839
Patrick?

968
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,910
-Yeah?
-Can you sleep?

969
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,558
Um... yeah.

970
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,632
Well, do you want to go
for a walk or something?

971
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,154
'Cause I can't sleep.

972
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,355
-Sure.
-Okay.

973
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,794
Hey, Joe?

974
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,748
Joe, we're leaving.

975
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,751
Are you awake?

976
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,678
Biaggio!

977
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,317
Jesus Christ, dude.

978
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,437
Stay above the surface
where I could see you, okay?

979
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,354
Um...
Look, I'm gonna go for a walk.

980
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,112
Don't wait up.

981
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,715
You should try not
to think about them so much.

982
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,075
Yeah, uh...

983
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,436
I'm sorry I'm not more fun
to be around right now.

984
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,356
Call me with anything.

985
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,590
Okay? Anything. I'm not far.

986
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,750
Yeah. Thanks.

987
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,554
Take care, Colin.

988
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,551
Have fun with... singing.

989
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,154
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

990
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,718
Um, I'm actually part of a...

991
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,269
a cappella band called Mmm.

992
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,633
So long.

993
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,278
Uh, we're actually,
uh, performing

994
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,556
12-part harmony to, uh,
"And the Band Played On."

995
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,391
-Good night.
-Do you know the song?

996
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,868
Uh, I'll just do the chorus,
then, just real fast.

997
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,154
Oh, babe, I don't think it's...

998
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,957
Casey would waltz

999
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,315
With the strawberry blonde

1000
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,390
And the band

1001
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,198
-Played on
-Thank you.

1002
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,634
He'd glide cross the floor
with the girl

1003
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,915
He adored, and the

1004
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,480
Band played on

1005
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,198
Great.

1006
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,953
His brain was so loaded

1007
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,518
It nearly

1008
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,238
-Exploded
-Still going.

1009
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,518
The poor girl
would shake with alarm

1010
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,034
He'd never leave
the girl with the

1011
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,110
Strawberry curls

1012
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,872
And the

1013
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,154
Band

1014
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,718
Played...

1015
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,837
-On...
-Okay. Oh, babe.

1016
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,070
Babe.

1017
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,355
I think I may never get
an erection again.

1018
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,918
Dad! Jesus!

1019
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,878
Well... I mean...

1020
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,952
Uh, it was good
seeing you again.

1021
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,155
All right, drive safe.

1022
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,549
Aw, come on.

1023
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,751
Come on, honey, he just...

1024
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,751
serenaded me-- I can't pretend

1025
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,796
-that's acceptable.
-Right.

1026
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,155
Thanks for giving it
the old college try.

1027
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,798
I appreciate it.
I got to go.

1028
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,279
Shit, I'm sorry.

1029
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,434
Heather.

1030
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,993
I'm not a bastard, am I?

1031
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,752
No, Dad, a bastard would make
everyone around him miserable

1032
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,830
just 'cause he is.

1033
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,917
Hey.

1034
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,751
Hey, uh, we...

1035
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,591
You do your thing. Just...

1036
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,319
I'll see you kids...

1037
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,357
back at the house.

1038
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,598
Look... don't worry.

1039
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,272
He could never be mad at you.

1040
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,793
You guys are like brothers.

1041
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,837
This is different.

1042
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,434
This is way different.

1043
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,237
Did this work?

1044
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,832
Running away?

1045
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,400
I mean, are you
really happy out here?

1046
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,197
Yeah. You know, I'm just...

1047
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,668
I'm happy to be
wherever my parents are not.

1048
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,518
Ah...

1049
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,717
Is anything better
than a good stogie, Biaggio?

1050
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,119
Being in a situation

1051
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,872
where it's easier to lie

1052
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,836
but you choose
to tell the truth.

1053
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,518
Hmm.

1054
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,556
Guess that is better.

1055
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,757
Okay, I will trade
you B&O Railroad

1056
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,079
for both your utilities.

1057
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,269
And this
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

1058
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,872
Deal.

1059
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,598
Deal. That's a good deal.

1060
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,477
That's a good trade.

1061
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,833
What?

1062
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,193
Yeah.

1063
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,077
All four railroads
for the utilities

1064
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,398
Savvy.

1065
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,232
Oh, look at that--

1066
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,753
"Free Parking."

1067
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,553
You know what?

1068
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,120
I think I'm gonna buy
some more houses.

1069
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,839
How many is "more"?

1070
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,432
Give me a second.

1071
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,670
Actually...

1072
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,752
Biaggio, I will give you Baltic,

1073
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,830
Park Place and both my greens

1074
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,150
-for both your oranges.
-I want $1,000.

1075
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,594
-I'll give you $50.
-Okay.

1076
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,751
Pleasure doing
business with you.

1077
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,478
You just went
from $1,000 to $50?

1078
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,913
The men... are talking.

1079
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,115
Yes, Patrick,
the men are talking.

1080
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,031
Realtor, could I please get

1081
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,157
-three hotels?
-Oh, yeah, sure. On what?

1082
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,515
Orange. What I just bought.

1083
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,589
There you go, property manager.

1084
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,438
What's up, Joe?

1085
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,749
Nothing's up.

1086
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,194
It's your roll.

1087
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,113
Look, Joe, if I roll a six,
an eight or a nine,

1088
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,918
things are gonna get
very bad in here.

1089
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,514
I don't know what
to tell you, buddy.

1090
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,318
Just think of all the
other numbers in the world.

1091
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,437
Is everything okay
with you guys?

1092
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah.

1093
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,275
We're golden.

1094
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,718
What was that play, Joe?!

1095
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,757
-Jesus! It is a game!
-That was the lowest,

1096
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,955
shittiest, dickhead move
I've ever seen.

1097
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,428
Second lowest.

1098
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,032
Wow.

1099
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,759
No one was ever trying
to hurt you, Joe.

1100
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,069
It was never about you!

1101
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,752
We just... It just happened!

1102
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,432
-Get over it!
-I'm over it!

1103
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,714
The bitch wants you,
then she's

1104
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,039
not good enough for me anyway!

1105
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,951
Who the fuck are you,
Mary J. Blige?

1106
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,076
-Jesus Christ!
-Joe, I...

1107
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,718
Shut up, Kelly! All right?

1108
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,473
Everything was fine
until you came into the picture.

1109
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,233
You're like...
Jesus, you're like a cancer!

1110
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,872
Uh...

1111
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,711
I'm gonna go.

1112
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,630
What was that, Joe?

1113
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,791
You know what?
Go be with her.

1114
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,633
Go hang with Kelly
and your goddamn mother.

1115
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,916
I don't...
Joe, I don't want to go.

1116
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,831
Joe, I want to stay here.

1117
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,559
-You want to stay here? -This
is the most fun I've ever had.

1118
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,312
We built this house together!

1119
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,470
-Go be with her, man, hmm?
-Joe, I don't want to go.

1120
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,948
-Get out of here, man!
-Come on, man, I didn't...

1121
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,153
Come on!

1122
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,076
I'll get the tools.

1123
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,877
We'll fix it.

1124
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,599
Leave me alone, Biaggio.

1125
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,309
What do you mean?

1126
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,630
I'm saying I want to be alone.

1127
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,279
Go away.

1128
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,033
Don't mince words with me, Joe.

1129
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,474
We've been through too much.

1130
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,597
Just leave.

1131
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,511
Kelly!

1132
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,035
Kelly.

1133
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,758
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

1134
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,557
I didn't want
to come between friends.

1135
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,232
I've just... I've...

1136
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,113
No!

1137
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,232
Damn it!

1138
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,553
God...!

1139
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,069
Fuck!

1140
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,036
We didn't want to wake you.

1141
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,029
Yeah.

1142
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,474
Welcome home, Patrick.

1143
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,434
Stop.

1144
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,556
Yep.

1145
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,994
Glad you're back.

1146
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,997
The report says this boy
was with him the whole week.

1147
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,831
He's given us nothing so far.

1148
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,558
He has a contempt for the law

1149
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,199
I've never seen in a minor.

1150
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,430
Look at him.
He won't sit down.

1151
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,510
He won't deflate the room.

1152
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,909
It's actually
quite sophisticated.

1153
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,997
This kid is in my head.

1154
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,918
If you need to leave, Sergeant,
there's no shame in it.

1155
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,636
Yeah, maybe just to...

1156
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,995
splash a bit of cold water
on my face.

1157
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,632
There is shame in it,
but please leave anyway.

1158
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,751
Oh, God.

1159
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,352
And Patrick?

1160
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,635
He says he hasn't seen Joe

1161
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,108
since they split up.

1162
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,589
No.

1163
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,716
It stays on.

1164
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,672
Oh, my God.

1165
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,432
Dude!

1166
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,715
Hey!

1167
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,870
Dude, this is my spot, man!
You're ruining my spot!

1168
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,791
I thought you said you'd
never been here before.

1169
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,074
I haven't.

1170
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,274
Freak.

1171
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,396
-I'm sorry.
-Come on.

1172
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,994
I got another spot.

1173
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,475
No fear!

1174
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,911
Sorry.

1175
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,199
We were just... hungry.

1176
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,430
I guess we were all just hungry.

1177
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,714
Sorry I yelled.

1178
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,959
Goddamn it.

1179
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,279
"Save the heart and liver
if you wish

1180
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,955
and cut from rectum
to collar bone."

1181
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,276
Well, anyway, if you guys

1182
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,316
are going to go hunting,
you're going to need these.

1183
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,551
Uh, they're masks that you wear
on the back of your head

1184
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,437
to keep the animals
away from you.

1185
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,829
To keep them from stalking you,
essentially.

1186
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,635
This is yours--
on the back of your head.

1187
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,710
This one supposed to be me?

1188
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,716
Yeah.

1189
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,989
Hello?

1190
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,238
Whoa.

1191
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,356
Whoa.

1192
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,437
On now to the story
which has captivated

1193
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,668
much of Tottenville County.

1194
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,636
Where is Joseph Toy?

1195
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,030
It's been more than four weeks
since the 1 5-year-old left home.

1196
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,871
Toy's friend Patrick Keenan

1197
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,394
returned home safely
this past Tuesday

1198
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,790
with his family calling it,
quote, "a miracle."

1199
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,156
Keenan claims
he hasn't seen Toy in weeks.

1200
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,311
Toy is described as
approximately five-foot-seven,

1201
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,709
with straight brown hair
and blue eyes.

1202
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,110
Anyone with information
regarding Joseph Toy should call

1203
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,350
the Tottenville County
Sheriff's Department.

1204
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:12,353
Coming up: Could caffeine
lead to longer, stronger...

1205
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,676
Sure.

1206
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,352
Every man has.

1207
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,350
Well, there's good quitting
and bad quitting, Biaggio.

1208
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,920
Quit drinking soda:
good quitting.

1209
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,276
I quit law school:
bad quitting.

1210
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,872
Do you see?

1211
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,276
You should never quit
on a friend, son.

1212
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,197
Of course you would.

1213
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,395
Yeah, okay.
That's what I thought.

1214
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,671
I-I don't eat cookies.

1215
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,159
I'm sorry to bother you.

1216
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,151
I, uh...

1217
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,110
I can take you to Joe.

1218
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,308
Joe?

1219
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,788
-Dad?
-Joe!

1220
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,756
-Dad! Dad, don't come in here!
-Are you all right?

1221
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,830
-Joe, Joe, I'm not going to
hurt you. -Joe, I'm so sorry.

1222
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,796
Seriously, do not come in.
There's a snake.

1223
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,028
Whoa.

1224
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,712
What do I do?

1225
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,109
Kelly... Iook at me.

1226
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,396
Be cool, all right?

1227
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,277
Be calm.

1228
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,032
-Be still.
-Whoa.

1229
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,349
-Do not move.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1230
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:59,033
It can sense fear, all right?

1231
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,190
Don't move.

1232
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,599
-No, no, no!
-Easy, easy.

1233
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,909
Joe! Joe, don't be an idiot!

1234
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,673
Be calm.

1235
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,228
That's good.

1236
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,673
What the hell is that?

1237
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,792
Biaggio?

1238
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,111
Infamata.

1239
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,716
-Oh, God.
-Oh, my living Christ.

1240
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,434
Holy shit.

1241
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,551
Oh...

1242
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,788
Joe, no! No, no, Joe!

1243
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,518
Fuck you, snake!

1244
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,476
He's awake.

1245
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,391
-You're okay.
-Did it get me, man?

1246
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,755
-Yeah, a little bit. Um...
-Small bite. -Okay.

1247
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,591
Dad, take the head and the body

1248
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,670
and bury them in two separate
holes, do you understand?

1249
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,954
The venom will attract
other snakes.

1250
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,393
Okay.

1251
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,913
-Dad, now!
-Okay.

1252
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,638
Can you not just,
like, suck it out of him?

1253
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,198
The venom has already entered
his bloodstream.

1254
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,918
Okay, we got
to get him out of here.

1255
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,592
-Oh! Oh!
-My God.

1256
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,352
Maybe that's good.
Maybe that's good.

1257
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,878
Dad, can you bring the car up?

1258
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,108
Yeah, I'll just...
I'll carry it, I guess,

1259
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,473
or fly it over the forest.

1260
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,675
No, I can't bring
the car up here!

1261
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,352
Your jokes
are not funny right now!

1262
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,271
Guys, stop yelling!
This isn't helping anything!

1263
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,350
-He's getting worse. -Oh, my
God, he's really letting it go.

1264
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,476
-You're pissing yourself, kid.
-Guys, he is burning up.

1265
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,549
We need to get him out of here.

1266
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,073
You up for a little walk, buddy?

1267
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,559
All right, look,
you two, run up ahead,

1268
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,039
pull the car up
as close as you can

1269
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,519
to the mouth of the woods.

1270
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,431
-You know how to put it
in gear? -Fuck, yeah.

1271
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,396
Watch your mouth. Good, good.
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

1272
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,879
Come here.

1273
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,909
Did you have asparagus?

1274
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,832
Hang on.

1275
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,079
Uh... try these.

1276
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,917
So...

1277
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:34,037
you honestly believe
that you saw Heaven?

1278
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,712
Yes.

1279
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,312
There were many demons.

1280
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,793
But I'm better now.

1281
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,358
Stronger.

1282
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:46,035
If I had to do it over,
I'd get bitten again.

1283
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:50,278
I know you would, Biaggio.

1284
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,271
You're a good friend.

1285
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,952
Remember when I said,

1286
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,157
"If I had to do it over,
I'd get bitten again"?

1287
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,912
You... you just said that.

1288
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,873
I was wrong.

1289
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,394
I would never do that again.

1290
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,751
Joe.

1291
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,237
I...

1292
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:25,313
I, um, got this for you
from the gift shop.

1293
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:29,108
Uh, it has an eagle on it,
the snake's natural enemy.

1294
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,917
"You're miles above the rest."

1295
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,355
I-I guess they didn't
have one that said, uh,

1296
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,271
"You saved me
from an agonizing death

1297
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,032
by rapid blood oxygenation."

1298
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,112
Uh, they did; just no envelopes.

1299
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,959
Look, Joe, just...

1300
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,599
just because we're not dating

1301
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,990
doesn't mean that I don't
care about you at all.

1302
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,230
We didn't even know
if you were dead or not.

1303
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,719
You know?

1304
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,792
I would give you a hug
or something, but I don't know,

1305
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,268
maybe you don't want
to be anywhere near me.

1306
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,550
No.

1307
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,630
A hug can work.

1308
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,552
Hey.

1309
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,993
Is he okay?

1310
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,718
Uh, yeah.

1311
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,790
Biaggio is in there.

1312
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,953
Okay.

1313
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,911
Okay.

1314
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,433
See you, bro.

1315
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,919
So, who's this Kelly?

1316
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,674
Is that Patrick's girlfriend?

1317
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,272
Yep.

1318
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,032
Looking that way.

1319
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,998
She looks like
a real heartbreaker.

1320
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,511
Yes.

1321
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,668
You were very good, Joe.

1322
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,910
In the woods, before.

1323
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,752
Good?

1324
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,079
Yeah.

1325
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,718
You were very good.

1326
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,317
I was really proud of you.

1327
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,674
Thanks.

1328
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,750
Guess I'm a man now, huh?

1329
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,954
You're getting there, bud.

1330
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,030
No need to rush.

1331
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,598
Stroke alert.

1332
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,477
Fifth floor, building B.

1333
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,879
Room 514.

1334
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,312
So, uh...

1335
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:58,596
how are things
between you and Carol?

1336
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,431
Carol?

1337
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,351
You're referring
to the spider woman

1338
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,634
I found in the gutter?

1339
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,232
That you found
in the gutter, yes.

1340
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,196
-That's the one.
-The same. One and the same.

1341
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,713
Things, uh...
things are actually

1342
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,950
cooled down between
Carol and me.

1343
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,188
It's baffling.

1344
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,872
Just... I can't quite

1345
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,553
pinpoint the exact moment
when everything went south.

1346
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,872
-Yeah.
-It's a puzzle.

1347
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,518
Sorry about that one.

1348
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,836
It's okay.

1349
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,717
It wouldn't have worked anyway.

1350
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,278
She didn't...

1351
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:33,988
I don't know, she...

1352
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,309
she didn't make me nervous.

1353
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,517
Not like your mom did, anyway.

1354
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,875
And you need that.

1355
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,277
Mm-hmm.

1356
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,954
I know. I know.

1357
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,758
What's going on over there?

1358
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,271
Patrick's just being an idiot.
