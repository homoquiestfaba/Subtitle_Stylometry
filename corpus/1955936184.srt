then we all left.

I seem to have misplaced my report.

516
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,028
I was wondering if you could
send it over with any photos.

517
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:12,965
Well, it's been archived already but I
could modem it over to your computer.

518
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:15,067
Yeah, that'd be great.

519
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,539
Um, anytime you're ready.

520
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,309
I'll pull it up right now, Mr. Bartrand,
I just need your case number.

521
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:27,613
Right, my case number. Mmm-hmm.

522
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,417
You know I'm not at
the office right now

523
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,185
and I'll have to get
back to you with it.

524
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:34,686
No problem. Thanks.

I can't believe you're going
to blow me off Saturday.

528
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,264
We were supposed to go
shopping for homecoming.

529
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,233
I told you I have
to watch the kids,

530
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:50,036
besides, why do you need a dress
if you don't have a date?

531

(SCOFFS) Oh, and
whose fault is that?

You're a very difficult person
to connect to these days.

being a working mother and all.

Tracy, Kate Jacobs. Hi.

538
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,587
She's a cop.

You've grown pretty attached
to the Bartrand kids, huh?

Actually, uh...

543
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,436
They've grown attached to me.

Sally's murder.

We don't know yet, honey.

That's why I want
you to be careful.

Hey, wait a minute, you
can't go in there.

I'm sorry, Mr. Bartrand,
I couldn't stop her.

Oh, that's okay, Pam, this is
Michelle, she's our sitter.

560

What's the matter?

561
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,810
I don't think I can
work for you anymore.

That detective, Kate,

565
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,089
she told me that
Sally was murdered.

566
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,693
She told you that?

567
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,762
But that's not true right?
I mean...

568
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,365
No, Sally killed herself.

569
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,866
As hard as it is for
all of us to accept

570
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,701
and only Detective Jacobs
is running around town

571
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,403
looking for a killer.

572
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,372
Right.

573
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,673
You think I'd let you
and the children

574
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,276
stay in that house for a second,

575
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,577
if I thought that was true?

576
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:13,879
No, no.

577
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,482
I'm sorry.

578
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,651
Oh, she really frightened you.

(EXHALES)

580
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,158
Why would she think
something like that?

581
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:33,332
I guess she can't believe that
someone who had everything

582
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:34,766
would just throw it all away.

583
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,172
As for quitting,

00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:45,311
I won't allow it.

is just the best part of my day.

Why don't you give them
dinner early tonight

and you and I,

589
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:56,555
we can have a late
supper and really talk.
