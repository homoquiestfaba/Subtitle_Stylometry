1
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:04,627
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:16,385
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:18,635
(blasting)

4
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:23,119
- My name is Josh Kirby.

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,487
I was just your average ninth grader.

6
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:28,907
My biggest problem was
getting good grades.

7
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:30,826
And my idea of excitement

8
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:32,659
was racing my bicycle.

9
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:35,091
Yes!

10
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:37,452
I never thought time
would catch up with me.

11
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:39,084
But I couldn't have imagined

12
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:41,681
that hundreds of years from now,

13
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:44,210
mankind would invent the Nullifier,

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,377
a device capable of controlling
or destroying the universe.

15
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,113
A scientist named Irwin 1138

16
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:56,089
tried to disassemble
and hide the Nullifier,

17
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,331
but even he couldn't stop it.

18
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:00,248
- [Irwin] Dr. Zoetrope!

19
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:04,010
- Give me the Nullifier.

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,597
- You're too late!

21
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:07,264
- It's not too late.

22
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:11,410
- Irwin and Zoetrope have
been chasing each other

23
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,599
across the galaxy, trying to be the first

24
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,751
to find the Nullifier's pieces.

25
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:18,903
This time, they're gonna land in 1995.

26
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:19,905
The place?

27
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:21,527
My front yard.

28
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:25,360
Now, I'm going along for
the ride of all time!

29
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,872
What's going on?

30
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:29,928
Where are we?

31
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:32,212
- [Irwin] I hope you're prepared
to do battle, young man.

32
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:33,754
This will be a war time

33
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:37,087
and Dr. Zoetrope will take no prisoners.

34
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,350
- [Josh] We've got help from a warrior.

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,529
- My name is Azabeth Siege.

36
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:47,633
- She's amazing!

37
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:50,089
And a magical creature called Prism,

38
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:52,100
to show us the way.

39
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,736
Together, we're on a quest through time,

40
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:56,069
visiting different worlds

41
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,069
to fight for the Nullifier's pieces.

42
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:03,473
- I'm obviously in the right
place, and the right time.

43
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:06,113
- Because if Zoetrope ever
assembles the Nullifier,

44
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:08,815
he'll conquer time itself.

45
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:10,829
I've gotta try and save the universe.

46
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,412
(heroic music)

47
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:56,304
I was just a 14-year-old kid
before my adventure began.

48
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:59,471
But now, I'm Josh Kirby, Time Warrior.

49
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,227
- [Narrator] On the last chapter

50
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:21,560
of Josh Kirby, Time Warrior.

51
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:30,268
- I'm obviously in the right
place, and the right time.

52
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:31,101
(screaming)

53
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:33,104
(buzzing)

54
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:37,271
- These things sting like
bees back home, only worse!

55
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:42,373
- On the other side of
that bridge is a nightmare.

56
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:49,865
- Josh Kirby, run!

57
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,114
- Oh no!

58
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,183
- Come on, jump!

59
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,952
(screaming)

60
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,737
Don't look at its eyes!

61
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:29,554
She's slipping rather quickly, Josh.

62
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,603
Josh?

63
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:36,428
- Five minutes.

64
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,571
- Great jumping hounds!

65
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,654
You're summoning your own time storm.

66
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:44,071
Josh, be careful!

67
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,363
- What are you trying to do, poison me?

68
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,857
- I was somehow able to turn back time.

69
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:52,524
- [Irwin] You did it! It worked!

70
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,547
(buzzing)

71
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:04,963
- Zoetrope!

72
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:09,006
- Toss me the Nullifier
component so I can pull you up.

73
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:13,173
- No, I'd rather see it lost
forever than in your hands.

74
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:27,045
- Pull the past from out of my mind.

75
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:27,878
You can do it.

76
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,711
You're a time warrior.

77
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,896
- Thank heavens I was able to recalibrate

78
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,608
Colonel Damon's blaster to
match my own palm print.

79
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,966
Are you all right, Josh?

80
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,115
- Yeah I'm fine, but you
didn't have to shoot him!

81
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:53,907
- Ah, forget his evil lies.

82
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:56,429
Trying to turn you
against me is child's play

83
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,403
for an evil genius like him.

84
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:00,236
- Irwin?

85
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:04,418
Let me probe your time memories.

86
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:06,700
- Never!

87
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:11,114
(dramatic music)

88
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:16,753
Hand over the final Nullifier
component now, Josh!

89
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:17,586
- No.

90
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:20,169
No, not until I know the truth.

91
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:24,575
- Please, Josh.

92
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,855
After all we've been through together,

93
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:31,438
don't force me to blast
you to smithereens!

94
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:43,809
- Irwin, I don't understand!

95
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:45,357
I thought we were friends.

96
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:47,712
I thought we were out to
save the world together.

97
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:49,215
- We are friends, Josh.

98
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,891
You're just too young
to be able to understand

99
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:55,509
all the subtle nuances of the situation.

100
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,342
- Yeah.

101
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,832
Yeah, but I'm not too young to understand

102
00:07:57,832 --> 00:07:59,686
that friends don't point plasma blasters

103
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,401
set for disintegrate at each other.

104
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,860
- He's no one's friend, Josh.

105
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,374
Except for the evil tyrants

106
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:06,790
who rule the 25th century without mercy.

107
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,635
- Quiet, you!

108
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:09,840
- Dr. Zoetrope!

109
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,142
Irwin, I can't believe you did that.

110
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:14,009
- Don't make this any harder for me

111
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,507
than it already is, Josh.

112
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:18,489
Now hand me the final Nullifier component.

113
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:19,322
- No.

114
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:23,373
- I'll count to three.

115
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:24,602
One,

116
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:26,087
two.

117
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:26,920
- Josh Kirby!

118
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,837
Irwin, what's going on?

119
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,284
(muttering)

120
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,819
- Oh, put a sock in it, Prism.

121
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:35,751
You excuse for a pet.

122
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,313
- Irwin's gone rogue.

123
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:39,514
- I beg to differ, young miss.

124
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:40,680
I am no rogue.

125
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,007
I'm a loyal servant of
the utopian dynasty.

126
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,490
I'm Minister of Science for all of Earth.

127
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,100
If I abandon my mission to
keep the reassembled Nullifier

128
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,709
out of the hands of
enemies of the state, then,

129
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,802
then you could call me rogue.

130
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,376
- Irwin, what the heck
are you talking about?

131
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:01,154
- I've said too much already.

132
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:06,094
Hand the final Nullifier
component over to me now, Josh.

133
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:08,594
Before I disintegrate Azabeth!

134
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:36,678
Finally.

135
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:39,468
Just one last step.

136
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,068
- What are you doing?

137
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:43,526
- Oh don't worry Josh.

138
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:47,367
My staff is too low on
energy to be a lethal weapon.

139
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:48,709
But its micro-computer

140
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,885
is still working in tip-top condition.

141
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:54,598
I didn't lay a finger
on that young hooligan

142
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:58,591
thanks to Prism, who is so
adept at transporting his matter

143
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:02,258
from one location to
another on a mere whim.

144
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,252
- Irwin, if you're trying to impress me

145
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:07,454
with your scientific
know-how, it won't work!

146
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:10,740
- That's where you're
wrong, my young friend.

147
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,712
It will work.

148
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:15,879
I've just entered Prism's
bio-codes into my micro-computer,

149
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:22,581
transforming him into
a matter transmitter.

150
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:27,224
Like so!

151
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:33,828
(dramatic music)

152
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,697
- Irwin!

153
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:44,530
Irwin!

154
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,544
Come back!

155
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:51,295
Irwin!

156
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,385
Irwin!

157
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:03,072
- I'm truly sorry, Josh Kirby.

158
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:04,518
It would appear that Irwin 1138

159
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:07,094
is not the friend he claimed to be.

160
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:09,667
I too trusted him completely.

161
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,247
And I should have been more careful.

162
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:12,719
It is the very first code of Kang.

163
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,605
Things are not always as they appear.

164
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:16,909
- But Azabeth, I don't understand!

165
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,919
Why would Irwin do that, why?

166
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,086
- [Zoetrope] I can tell you why, Josh.

167
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:27,888
- Are you okay?

168
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,360
- Just a bit shaken up.

169
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,333
My time armor protected me from the brunt

170
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,817
of Irwin's disintegrator blast.

171
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,832
- Well for goodness sakes,
tell us what's going on!

172
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,900
And what is Irwin really after?

173
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,795
- I can do better than tell you Josh.

174
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,126
I can show you.

175
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:44,293
That is, you can reach inside
my mind and see for yourself.

176
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:53,782
It's time to trust me now, Josh.

177
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,526
You can access images from the past

178
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:03,137
as easily as rewinding a
primitive 20th century videotape.

179
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:05,585
You're a time warrior.

180
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:07,425
Concentrate, Josh.

181
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:08,425
Concentrate.

182
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,322
- [Josh] I can see it.

183
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:19,690
It's gotta be the 25th century.

184
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,513
Some sort of big city.

185
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:24,073
But it's, it's nothing like I pictured.

186
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:27,273
It's nothing like I
pictured the future at all.

187
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:29,418
It's dark, and sort of creepy.

188
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:31,674
It's you, Dr. Zoetrope!

189
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:33,257
And Irwin.

190
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:35,882
It looks like the two of you
are arguing over something,

191
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:38,560
but I can't quite hear what you're saying.

192
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,225
- Concentrate harder, Josh.

193
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:43,217
Pull the sounds of the
future from out of my past.

194
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:46,240
Don't you realize what
you have done, Irwin?

195
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,538
By turning over this ancient
piece of hyper-advanced

196
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:52,209
alien technology which
you happened to find.

197
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:56,376
- That is a Decimator, and
I did not happen to find it.

198
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,753
It was my ingenious Klaatu formula

199
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:05,045
for locating interstellar refuse.

200
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:07,157
- Klaatu formula, don't make me laugh!

201
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:09,461
A radon storm happened
to deposit that thing

202
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:11,829
a half a mile away from this
very laboratory of yours.

203
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:14,540
You practically stumbled onto it.

204
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,015
- I'd have you know, it was a
carefully calculated stumble.

205
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,263
- Don't you realize

206
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:24,087
that by turning the Decimator
over to the Supreme Prefect,

207
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,279
you have doomed all of humanity to suffer

208
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,599
under a yoke of brutal tyranny forever?

209
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,132
- Wild exaggerations.

210
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:32,636
As Minister of Science,

211
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:35,230
I would never permit such things to occur.

212
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,307
If I could help it, that is.

213
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,260
- That's it, isn't it?

214
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,750
All you really care about
is that ridiculous job

215
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,667
and that foolish title.

216
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,139
I had it from age seven to 12,

217
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,106
and turned it down eight years running,

218
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:53,570
and would never have accepted
it from a totalitarian moron

219
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,653
like the Supreme Prefect.

220
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:00,407
- Maybe my ambition is unquenchable.

221
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,574
But on the scale of character defense,

222
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,543
your unbounded egotistical arrogance

223
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,022
beats my ambition 10 to one.

224
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,759
Do you hear me, Zoetrope?

225
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:12,119
10 to one!

226
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,082
- Arrogance?

227
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:14,813
Well, that's quite refreshing

228
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,813
coming from the Minister of Science.

229
00:14:20,012 --> 00:14:21,091
- [Josh] Where are we now?

230
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:22,644
- [Zoetrope] It's my secret laboratory,

231
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:26,227
mere moments before
the beginning of chaos.

232
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,213
- Seize him!

233
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:31,784
- Blast you Irwin, how did you find me?

234
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:35,049
- You did yourself in this time, Zoetrope.

235
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,311
Only you would be so supercilious

236
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,159
as to dub your secret laboratory,

237
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,111
The Fortress of Brilliance,

238
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:45,645
and to have it listed among the top 10

239
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:48,895
scientific attractions of the universe.

240
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:54,030
Amazing.

241
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,030
So the rumors were true.

242
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,584
It is another alien device,

243
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,446
similar to the Decimator.

244
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:06,075
- Not quite, you jealous old windbag.

245
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:08,152
This device is the counterpart

246
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:09,913
to that hideous doomsday weapon

247
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:12,088
you've handed over to the Supreme Prefect.

248
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:14,200
The Decimator is the only
thing that keeps the Prefect

249
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,024
and his utopian dynasty in power,

250
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:19,192
and this device will nullify
the Decimator completely.

251
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:20,664
Once that has occurred,

252
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:23,288
the Supreme Prefect's evil
reign will be finished.

253
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,121
- Silence!

254
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:27,419
You, Dr. Emile Zoetrope 366.

255
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:32,846
Youngest Nobel Science Laureate
in all of Earth's history.

256
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:34,861
Winner of the Colonial prize

257
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:39,028
for the advancement of
quantum physics, at age four!

258
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,145
Simultaneous graduate of
16 post-doctoral studies

259
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,638
while still a pre-teenager.

260
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:50,805
And arrogant user of a first
name as well as a number.

261
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:53,899
You are under arrest.

262
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:59,469
And as for this Nullifier.

263
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,559
As of this moment, I decree possession

264
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,335
of such an alien device
to be scientific heresy,

265
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,835
punishable by 20 years on a mining colony.

266
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:16,557
- You'll never get away with this, Irwin.

267
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:18,492
It'll be child's play foiling
your pathetic schemes.

268
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:22,288
I'm still more intelligent
than you and you know it.

269
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,415
- What is the point of intelligence

270
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:27,341
if you are denied the power to use it?

271
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:29,231
And it's remarks like that

272
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:33,877
that will get you yourself
nullified, for good.

273
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:37,794
As an example of nullifying
something for good.

274
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:42,651
- Some example, old man.

275
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,795
The Nullifier is completely impervious

276
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,270
to attack of any kind.

277
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,103
Nothing you or anyone
else can do can harm it.

278
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,777
- I've just thought of an ingenious way

279
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:57,944
of ensuring that this alien
device is never activated.

280
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:02,757
Rest assured that your days
as numero uno scientist

281
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:04,590
are finished for good.

282
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:06,627
Take him away!

283
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,705
- You'll never win, Irwin!

284
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:10,038
- Oh yes I will!

285
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:18,683
Try to ruin my plans, will you?

286
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:20,286
There's only room for one

287
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:23,498
all-powerful alien device in this time.

288
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:25,748
(cackling)

289
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,464
- [Zoetrope] So, Irwin 1138
inaugurated his ingenious plan

290
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:37,877
for maintaining control
over the Nullifier.

291
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:39,310
He accessed the time stream

292
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,382
and scattered each of
the Nullifier components

293
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:45,465
to the far corners of time and space.

294
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,700
(dramatic music)

295
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,390
- Prepare for the storm.

296
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:02,281
Next.

297
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:39,628
Next.

298
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,273
Next.

299
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,267
We need another 93 seconds.

300
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:32,015
Seal the door.

301
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:49,782
Quick, load the final component.

302
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:50,699
- Let's go.

303
00:20:57,981 --> 00:21:00,231
(shouting)

304
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:02,824
- Dr. Zoetrope!

305
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:06,718
(gun firing)

306
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:14,635
(beeping)

307
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:39,781
- Give me the Nullifier, you lunatic.

308
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,829
- You're too late, Zoetrope.

309
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:44,246
- It's never too late for me.

310
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,814
In the name of all creation,

311
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:09,814
twisted old man, what have you done?

312
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:16,637
- Are you all right?

313
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:19,054
Josh Kirby, what did you see?

314
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,366
- The truth.

315
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,449
Azabeth, I saw the truth!

316
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:29,061
I can't believe it.

317
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:32,936
Irwin has been deceiving us all along.

318
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:35,853
He's the villain, not Dr. Zoetrope!

319
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,920
- Perhaps villain is too harsh, Josh.

320
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,984
Irwin is merely a jealous old man,

321
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:45,800
desperate to be seen as the
smartest being of his era.

322
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,858
Unfortunately, the need
to prove himself better

323
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:50,080
than everyone else instead of
being the person he truly is

324
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,153
may very well doom the universe.

325
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:54,952
- You mean, the Nullifier was really meant

326
00:22:54,952 --> 00:22:58,447
to save the future, not destroy it?

327
00:22:58,447 --> 00:23:00,591
- That's about the size of it, yeah.

328
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:02,719
I saw this with my own eyes!

329
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:04,623
- All of this means nothing now.

330
00:23:04,623 --> 00:23:07,062
Irwin has escaped, and
without a time travel device

331
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:09,240
we're stuck here in the
center of the Earth,

332
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,673
powerless to stop him.

333
00:23:10,673 --> 00:23:12,206
- But there must be something we can do.

334
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:13,871
A warrior can't just give up.

335
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:15,630
Besides, we are all partly responsible

336
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,958
for the success of Irwin
1138's nefarious plan.

337
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:22,041
We've been helping him all this time.

338
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:24,207
- Of course!

339
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:26,263
All this time.

340
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:29,896
The last thing Irwin
said before he took off

341
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:34,151
was something about putting
my theory to the test.

342
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:35,463
- You had a theory?

343
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:39,836
- Yeah sure, the Kirby theory
of temporal replacement.

344
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:43,169
- Don't you mean, temporal displacement?

345
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,447
- No, I mean temporal replacement.

346
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:49,206
As in retracing your steps through time

347
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:51,542
in order to restore
the overall time stream

348
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:54,181
to its original state.

349
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:56,264
- Crude, but interesting.

350
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:02,517
If proven correctly,
this would totally debunk

351
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:05,382
Irwin 1138's own time
displacement postulate.

352
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:08,005
I can't believe he would throw
his own theory out the window

353
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:09,589
just to test yours.

354
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,149
- That old man may be
an aging megalomaniac

355
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:14,549
with delusions of grandeur,
but he is no fool.

356
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:16,437
If he thought Josh
Kirby's theory would work,

357
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:18,037
he's try it in an instant.

358
00:24:18,037 --> 00:24:20,341
- Even presuming that we
have correctly deciphered

359
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:22,613
Irwin's own plan, so what?

360
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,245
Our only chance to stop him

361
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:27,285
would be to intercept him before
he reached your time, Josh.

362
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,318
That was my first stop
on my trek through time,

363
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:30,151
so that would be Irwin's last

364
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:32,313
before heading home to the 25th century.

365
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:35,896
- Yeah, but my time
doesn't exist any more.

366
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:38,017
Does it?

367
00:24:38,017 --> 00:24:39,425
- Not at the moment.

368
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:43,089
But, assuming that your theory
has any validity whatsoever,

369
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:44,398
by the time Irwin gets there,

370
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:46,012
he will have repaired enough of the damage

371
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:47,300
to the time stream that your world

372
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,526
will be almost completely
restored to normal.

373
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:50,900
- You know, Dr. Zoetrope,

374
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,268
my time powers have been getting easier

375
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:54,997
and easier for me to use.

376
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:55,830
Just maybe.

377
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,399
- Wait a minute, Josh.

378
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:00,488
You're not thinking what
I think you're thinking.

379
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:03,288
- I've been able to turn back
time a few minutes or so.

380
00:25:03,288 --> 00:25:06,441
Just maybe I can use myself
as a time travel device.

381
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:07,863
- Absolutely impossible.

382
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:09,257
No one can travel through time

383
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,954
without temporal displacement
technology of some sort.

384
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:15,122
- Yeah, well I'm not no one.

385
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:16,872
You said it yourself.

386
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:19,430
I'm a time warrior.

387
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,333
- I've won.

388
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,393
I've won!

389
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:26,185
I've won!

390
00:25:27,304 --> 00:25:29,554
(cackling)

391
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,739
- All right, everybody.

392
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:36,564
Hold on tight.

393
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:38,900
If this works, it'll be
like swimming underwater

394
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,288
without an oxygen tank,
or flying through the air

395
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:42,660
without a plane, or--

396
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,054
- Crossing the poison river of Andor

397
00:25:44,054 --> 00:25:46,471
without a purification craft.

398
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:49,547
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

399
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,131
- If this does work Josh Kirby,

400
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:52,556
I will personally see to it

401
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:54,987
that you become a legend
in the annals of time.

402
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,555
- A legend, huh?

403
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,305
Well even my dad will
be impressed with that.

404
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:04,291
Okay, here goes something.

405
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:07,037
I hope.

406
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,321
(electric buzzing)

407
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,455
- It's working!

408
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:26,642
(triumphant music)

409
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:33,950
- I did it!

410
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,470
- (laughing) I knew you
could do it, Josh Kirby!

411
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,007
- Let's save our congratulations

412
00:26:39,007 --> 00:26:40,831
until we have achieved our goal.

413
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:43,331
We still must stop Irwin 1138.

414
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:47,218
- What a party pooper.

415
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:50,385
All right, next stop, Green Oaks, USA.

416
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:53,657
September 12th, 1994.

417
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:57,868
20th century, here we come!

418
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,387
- And now, to put young
Josh's theory into action.

419
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,913
Excellent!

420
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:13,246
Let the experiment continue.

421
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:23,032
- Stingers!

422
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:30,451
- (cackling) You're a genius, Josh!

423
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,868
You're almost as smart as me.

424
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,683
(blasting)

425
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,670
(screaming)

426
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:02,168
Whew, that was close.

427
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:08,889
- Nice try!

428
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:09,806
Strike two!

429
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:17,014
(shouting)

430
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:19,264
(laughing)

431
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,173
(screaming)

432
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:50,390
- Oh, it's those fleshy-headed morons!

433
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:54,934
They're trying to make
me into a human pet.

434
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:12,904
Enjoy your bizarre existence
while you can, mutants!

435
00:29:12,904 --> 00:29:14,296
When I've returned time to normal,

436
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:18,463
your era might not even exist! (cackling)

437
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,408
- This isn't good, Josh.

438
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:04,744
- What's happening?

439
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:06,501
- Irwin Must be successfully retracing

440
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:08,046
our journey through the ages.

441
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:10,542
Hypertime is beginning to
return to its natural state,

442
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,413
freeing itself of a displaced time stream.

443
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:14,886
- You mean time is being
returned to normal?

444
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:15,887
- Precisely.

445
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:17,465
- That's good, isn't it?

446
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:19,663
- If we were to return
time to normal, yes.

447
00:30:19,663 --> 00:30:21,669
But Irwin is restoring
the natural time stream

448
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,605
for one reason and one reason only,

449
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:26,613
so he can put the Nullifier
alien device out of commission,

450
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:27,455
this time, for good.

451
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:30,462
- What in the name of Kang is that?

452
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,006
- No, not now!

453
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:34,246
- It's an energy distortion
in the time stream.

454
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:35,541
A time wave.

455
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,798
- And it's headed straight for us!

456
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:40,620
- Josh, you've gotta bring
us out of hypertime, now!

457
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,972
- Well sure, but I'm not sure

458
00:30:41,972 --> 00:30:43,924
I've locked on the right time yet.

459
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:44,885
- Look out!

460
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,218
(screaming)

461
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:22,912
My head.

462
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:26,802
- Yeah, I just feel like
I ate some moldy cheese.

463
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:30,921
- That was definitely the
worst experience of my life.

464
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:32,378
- Yeah, me too.

465
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:33,711
And I'm only 14.

466
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:38,877
Hey, we did it!

467
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:42,028
This is it!

468
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:45,401
- This is where you live, Josh Kirby?

469
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:48,826
- Yeah, it's all back to normal.

470
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:50,697
This is my house.

471
00:31:50,697 --> 00:31:52,506
Where I live with my dad.

472
00:31:52,506 --> 00:31:55,589
Oh boy is he gonna be glad to see me.

473
00:31:57,202 --> 00:31:59,370
But it looks different somehow.

474
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,951
- Remember Joshua, we arrived
here before encountered Irwin.

475
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:06,362
Before any of our adventures took place.

476
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:08,298
More likely your father will wonder

477
00:32:08,298 --> 00:32:10,105
why you're not still in school.

478
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:14,188
- Josh Kirby, this Green
Oaks, USA is remarkable.

479
00:32:15,073 --> 00:32:16,545
- Really?

480
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:19,041
I always thought it was
kind of dull myself.

481
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,090
- Oh, you should be very proud,

482
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,457
and very thankful for your home.

483
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:26,711
Josh Kirby, a place like this Green Oaks,

484
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,761
this is what I and my people
have been fighting for

485
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:31,250
for generations!

486
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,483
- Gee Azabeth, I've never
really thought of it

487
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:34,900
like that before.

488
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,770
- No slave pens.

489
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,754
No pain centers to herd
people into like cattle.

490
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:44,298
No acid pools, no guard to make sure

491
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:48,011
you do not cross into the restricted zone.

492
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:52,178
- Yeah, I guess I do have
a lot to be thankful for.

493
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,300
Holy moly, that was my dad!

494
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,217
Why didn't he stop, why
didn't he recognize me?

495
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,070
Dad!

496
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:10,182
Hey Dad.

497
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:14,668
Dad, don't you see, it's me, Josh!

498
00:33:14,668 --> 00:33:16,251
Dad!

499
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:17,751
He doesn't see me.

500
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:19,540
Dad!

501
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:21,845
I don't get it.

502
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:23,901
Hey Dad, it's me Josh.

503
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,301
Why don't you recognize me?

504
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:26,653
- Is that really your father, Josh Kirby?

505
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:28,925
He doesn't seem to want to
acknowledge your presence.

506
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:33,028
- Of course, it must
have been the time wave.

507
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:36,565
- What, the time wave made my
dad deaf and blind to his son?

508
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:37,957
- Quite the opposite, Josh.

509
00:33:37,957 --> 00:33:39,707
It made us invisible.

510
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:43,837
- Wait, come again?

511
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:45,503
- When you traveled through time,

512
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:47,140
you also traveled through space.

513
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,541
Now it's obvious the time wave must have

514
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:50,233
thrown off your concentration just enough

515
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:51,409
so that even though our chono-journey

516
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:52,617
was completed successfully,

517
00:33:52,617 --> 00:33:56,534
our spacial journey to
this area was disrupted.

518
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:01,628
- Holy invisible cow!

519
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:03,406
It's true.

520
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:05,967
- Of course it's true.

521
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:07,618
The most brilliant man of the 25th century

522
00:34:07,618 --> 00:34:09,534
does not state conjecture.

523
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:11,453
You see, although we are close
enough to this time plane

524
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:13,629
to view its occurrences,
our spacial fields

525
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:16,173
remain displaced, perhaps by mere seconds.

526
00:34:16,173 --> 00:34:18,415
- So, even though we
can see and hear events

527
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:21,469
in this time period, they
can't see and hear us?

528
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,058
- Precisely.

529
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:25,262
A more experienced time warrior

530
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:27,749
could have navigated that time wave.

531
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:30,916
But, you are still learning the ropes.

532
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:37,389
- Well, Zoetrope may have
turned out to be the good guy,

533
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,843
but he's still an egotistical know-it-all.

534
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:41,710
- It is the 19th code of Kang.

535
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,434
Large ideas often spring from large heads.

536
00:34:45,434 --> 00:34:47,957
- There's something
different about all this.

537
00:34:47,957 --> 00:34:50,111
I can't quite put my finger on it.

538
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:51,929
- That's not surprising.

539
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,808
It's not every day you return home

540
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:55,705
and no one bothers to notice.

541
00:34:55,705 --> 00:34:57,396
- No, but it's more than that.

542
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:00,558
My dad looks different somehow.

543
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,190
And my house too.

544
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,171
It looks like someone repainted it.

545
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,258
We've been wanting to
do that for a long time,

546
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:08,122
but we never really had the money.

547
00:35:08,122 --> 00:35:10,106
And even our truck looks weird.

548
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:12,014
It's usually covered with mud and rust,

549
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:13,836
but now it's shiny.

550
00:35:13,836 --> 00:35:16,169
(muttering)

551
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:19,702
What is it, Prism?

552
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:28,552
It's just a newspaper,
Prism, I don't see...

553
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:35,009
Oh no.

554
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:38,592
- [Azabeth] Josh Kirby,
is something wrong?

555
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:41,088
- The date.

556
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:43,378
That's why everything looks so weird.

557
00:35:43,378 --> 00:35:45,296
My house is freshly painted.

558
00:35:45,296 --> 00:35:49,917
The truck is brand new, and
my dad almost looks young.

559
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,683
And that thing he's building?

560
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,649
That Genghis Khan's doghouse.

561
00:35:53,649 --> 00:35:56,129
We got here before Irwin all right.

562
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:57,696
14 years before.

563
00:35:57,696 --> 00:35:59,937
- Who is this Genghis Khan?

564
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:02,725
- Why, a 13th century
Mongol warlord, of course.

565
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:05,857
But why Josh's dad would
be building him a doghouse

566
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,361
is beyond me.

567
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:10,001
- You think you are so smart, Zoetrope.

568
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,413
But it makes perfect sense.

569
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:14,640
Where else would a mongrel
warlord live except a doghouse?

570
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,596
- That's Mongol, you ignorant Amazon!

571
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:17,764
Mongol.

572
00:36:17,764 --> 00:36:20,196
- Ignorant, I will show
you who is ignorant.

573
00:36:20,196 --> 00:36:21,549
You can say it, fathead!

574
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:22,545
- Okay, now stop it.

575
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:24,391
Break it up, you guys.

576
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,598
Genghis Khan's my pet dog.

577
00:36:26,598 --> 00:36:27,833
- I think I liked you better

578
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,800
when you were a villain, Zoetrope.

579
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,353
At least then I could have broken your arm

580
00:36:31,353 --> 00:36:33,702
in 13 different places and
not felt guilty about it.

581
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:35,310
- Try it, you alien freak.

582
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,143
Come on.

583
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:39,404
I am master of 52
interstellar combat styles.

584
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:40,237
Come on.

585
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:48,256
- Well now you've done it.

586
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,176
You pompous, insensitive jerk.

587
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:52,179
Just because Azabeth looks different

588
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:54,211
doesn't mean you can call her alien freak

589
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:55,961
and get away with it.

590
00:36:57,565 --> 00:36:58,845
- I didn't mean it.

591
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:01,922
I just got a little
full of myself, I guess.

592
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:04,446
- You owe her an apology, Dr. Zoetrope.

593
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:06,862
You're not the only one around here

594
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:09,250
who's trying to save
the universe, you know.

595
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,897
Azabeth is the best partner

596
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,846
anybody could have and you know it.

597
00:37:12,846 --> 00:37:14,063
And another thing.

598
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:16,129
Just because you're smarter than everybody

599
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:19,097
doesn't mean you're always right.

600
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:21,400
- Please forgive me, Miss Siege.

601
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,600
I was wrong to call you anything
than what you really are.

602
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,767
Which is, the bravest female
tech warrior I've ever met.

603
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:37,057
- I am the only female tech
warrior you have ever met.

604
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:40,810
You self-centered, patronizing egghead.

605
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,560
But I accept your apology anyway.

606
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:53,243
(dog barks)

607
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,185
What is that little monster?

608
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:57,832
- That's no monster, it's a puppy.

609
00:37:57,832 --> 00:38:00,435
In fact, that's my puppy.

610
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:01,955
That's Genghis Khan!

611
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:04,004
How did he see me?

612
00:38:04,004 --> 00:38:06,469
- See may not be quite correct, Josh.

613
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:09,751
Animals have more highly-developed
faculties than humans.

614
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:12,584
Perhaps he merely senses us, or...

615
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:18,546
- What now?

616
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,642
- The solution is simple enough.

617
00:38:20,642 --> 00:38:22,642
Josh will simply have to concentrate,

618
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:26,021
use his time warrior powers,
and zap us forward 14 years

619
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:28,593
to the year when Irwin is due to show up.

620
00:38:28,593 --> 00:38:31,190
- Uh, there's just one
problem, Dr. Zoetrope.

621
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,451
I can't always use my time warrior powers.

622
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:35,406
- What?

623
00:38:35,406 --> 00:38:37,806
Why didn't you tell me?

624
00:38:37,806 --> 00:38:39,455
- Well I thought you knew.

625
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:42,160
You seem to know everything
else about being a time warrior.

626
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,711
- You mean we're marooned here

627
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:46,246
until you've regained your warrior powers?

628
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:49,928
- That's about the size of it, yeah.

629
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,955
- That could be an eternity.

630
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,508
Every minute we're stuck here

631
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:55,163
is another minute Irwin has

632
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:57,972
to dispose of the life-saving
Nullifier, forever.

633
00:38:57,972 --> 00:39:02,055
We have got to do something
before it's too late.

634
00:39:13,098 --> 00:39:14,099
- I did it!

635
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:14,932
I'm back!

636
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:16,990
- Irwin 1138?

637
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:48,125
- Irwin 1138, esteemed Minister of Science

638
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:51,220
and most brilliant man of
the 25th century speaking,

639
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,220
who is this?

640
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:55,199
- It is I, Irwin 1138.

641
00:39:56,935 --> 00:40:00,511
Report to me immediately
on your whereabouts

642
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:03,143
for the last several days.

643
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:05,267
- Ah, Supreme Prefect.

644
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:08,531
Yes, excuse me, I only
just got in a minute ago.

645
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,019
I was preparing my report

646
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:13,950
and was about to call you
immediately, Supreme One.

647
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:17,033
- There have been rumors, Irwin 1138.

648
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:22,065
Rumors of Zoetrope plotting against me.

649
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:26,232
Roumors of an indestructible
device called the Nullifier.

650
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:31,775
A device some say

651
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:35,942
capable of eradicating the
effects of my Decimator

652
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,803
and bringing me down in ruins.

653
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:45,951
- The Nullifier does
exist, oh munificent one.

654
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:46,951
- What?

655
00:40:46,951 --> 00:40:48,626
- But not to worry.

656
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:50,660
I have the situation under control

657
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,735
and have completely eradicated any threat

658
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:55,103
to you or your Decimator.

659
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:57,270
- You realize, Irwin 1138,

660
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,030
if I were to fall,

661
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:04,837
you too would immediately be nullified.

662
00:41:12,796 --> 00:41:16,963
From Minister of Science,
to public enemy number two.

663
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:21,778
Number two, after me of course.

664
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,898
- Take is from me, oh splendiferous one.

665
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:30,065
The Nullifier's threat to
you is completely eradicated.

666
00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:33,633
- That's what I like to hear.

667
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:42,502
- I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

668
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:48,170
Summon my technicians
and secure the facility.

669
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,823
- This,

670
00:42:04,466 --> 00:42:06,383
will serve our purpose.

671
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:11,123
- What are you gonna
do, mow the time stream?

672
00:42:11,123 --> 00:42:13,221
- Your sarcasm is not appreciated.

673
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:14,721
This, however, is.

674
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,140
The metal blades could serve

675
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,137
as a transtemporal heating device.

676
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:22,719
- Well I don't know, Doc.

677
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:25,841
If you can make a time machine
out of my dad's Lawnmaster,

678
00:42:25,841 --> 00:42:29,138
you must be the most
brilliant guy in any century.

679
00:42:29,138 --> 00:42:31,950
- [Woman] John, have you seen my homework?

680
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,371
- [Azabeth] Is something
wrong, Josh Kirby?

681
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:36,921
- That voice.

682
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,085
- [Woman] John?

683
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:40,051
- [Zoetrope] It's female, obviously.

684
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:41,754
Probably your mother, right?

685
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:43,383
- No, that's impossible.

686
00:42:43,383 --> 00:42:46,383
She passed away almost 14 years ago.

687
00:42:48,293 --> 00:42:52,126
- [John] It's down here
honey, in the kitchen!

688
00:42:57,615 --> 00:43:00,615
(sentimental music)

689
00:43:06,511 --> 00:43:08,526
- Three more weeks until finals, pal.

690
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:10,255
Can't afford to waste any time.

691
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,834
- [John] Well gee honey,
with all you've been through,

692
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:13,942
don't you think you oughta
give yourself a rest?

693
00:43:13,942 --> 00:43:15,142
- I wish I could.

694
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:16,328
But honey, you know we can't stay

695
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:18,064
at my mom and dad's house forever.

696
00:43:18,064 --> 00:43:20,160
- Well I can do some
overtime down at the plant.

697
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,993
- We talked about this.

698
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:22,315
The only way we're gonna
get a place of our own

699
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:23,818
is if I get my Master's degree

700
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:25,402
and then that engineering job.

701
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,788
- But I'm supposed to be the man.

702
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:29,705
- Yes dear.

703
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,727
- Mom, Dad, it's me, Josh!

704
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,534
- They can't hear us, Josh.

705
00:43:35,534 --> 00:43:37,449
Our voices suffer from the
same spacial displacement

706
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:40,716
that plagues the rest of our bodies.

707
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:42,808
- But she's alive.

708
00:43:42,808 --> 00:43:44,790
My mom's alive.

709
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,563
- Well would you at least stop wearing

710
00:43:46,563 --> 00:43:48,391
that stopwatch around your neck?

711
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,403
You're starting to look
like a gym teacher.

712
00:43:50,403 --> 00:43:52,768
- Honey, they only give you 45 minutes

713
00:43:52,768 --> 00:43:54,515
for the quantum physics final.

714
00:43:54,515 --> 00:43:56,794
I gotta go over sample
questions, pace myself.

715
00:43:56,794 --> 00:43:58,026
You know the routine.

716
00:43:58,026 --> 00:43:59,268
- Oh yeah, believe me, I know it.

717
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:00,853
- Besides, I got this little gem

718
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:03,010
for Mrs. Crabtree for two dollars.

719
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,507
I fixed it, it's good as new.

720
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:05,340
- Well I don't know honey,

721
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,699
it looks more like just
one more clock to me.

722
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:08,978
- That's what you say every time

723
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:12,311
I add a new time piece to my collection.

724
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:15,549
- Hey Mom.

725
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:17,549
It's me, I'm right here!

726
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:22,456
- What's the matter, honey?

727
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:25,382
- Nothing.

728
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:30,444
I must be working too hard or something.

729
00:44:30,444 --> 00:44:31,527
(baby crying)

730
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:34,726
- That sounds like a baby crying.

731
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:35,809
- Duty calls.

732
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:38,887
- I can't believe it.

733
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,115
- Come on Josh.

734
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:47,881
Oh, come on little man, it's lunch time.

735
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:48,714
Yes.

736
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:54,393
Here you go.

737
00:44:57,339 --> 00:45:01,506
Come on Josh, come on
little man, it's lunch time.

738
00:45:05,476 --> 00:45:07,661
- I don't believe it.

739
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:10,188
- You're my little hero, aren't you Josh.

740
00:45:10,188 --> 00:45:12,931
You're gonna grow up to be
big and strong like your dad,

741
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:14,868
and smart like your mom.

742
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:17,257
You're gonna be somebody important, Josh.

743
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:20,608
Somebody who's gonna make a
difference in this crazy world.

744
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:22,751
You just wait and see.

745
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:23,584
- What?

746
00:45:23,584 --> 00:45:26,147
What is it, what are you trying to say?

747
00:45:26,147 --> 00:45:27,147
- Its incredible.

748
00:45:27,147 --> 00:45:28,934
He's in two places at once.

749
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,913
Two beings composed of
exactly the same DNA,

750
00:45:30,913 --> 00:45:32,946
exact same molecular structure.

751
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:34,784
The fact that two Joshes can co-exist

752
00:45:34,784 --> 00:45:39,317
in the same space time
continuum is, astonishing.

753
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:40,150
- Well.

754
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,817
You are quite an adorable
child, Josh Kirby.

755
00:45:50,228 --> 00:45:54,616
Your parents seem like very
hardworking people, Josh Kirby.

756
00:45:54,616 --> 00:45:55,449
- Yeah.

757
00:45:56,984 --> 00:45:59,453
I can't believe I'm seeing them together.

758
00:45:59,453 --> 00:46:01,053
Especially my mom.

759
00:46:01,053 --> 00:46:03,653
- You never knew your mother?

760
00:46:03,653 --> 00:46:05,126
- No.

761
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:07,979
I was too young when she...

762
00:46:07,979 --> 00:46:09,525
Well, you know.

763
00:46:09,525 --> 00:46:11,783
- This is a great day for you, Josh Kirby.

764
00:46:11,783 --> 00:46:15,029
It's not every child that gets
to see his long-lost parent.

765
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:17,196
Even if she can't see him.

766
00:46:19,684 --> 00:46:22,017
- Hey, where's Dr. Zoetrope?

767
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:27,088
- Outside in the garage,
working on the time mower.

768
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:41,825
- I'm almost done.

769
00:46:41,825 --> 00:46:44,245
Even though it's not easy
working under these primitive,

770
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:47,119
impoverished conditions, all
I need is one last component

771
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,702
to make my time mower complete.

772
00:46:51,729 --> 00:46:53,729
A three-pronged adapter.

773
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,553
- Not again.

774
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:05,726
- That child must not be harmed.

775
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:07,295
If anything happens to baby Josh,

776
00:47:07,295 --> 00:47:10,128
teenage Josh could cease to exist.

777
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:15,461
(baby gurgles)

778
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:26,245
- I didn't know I was
such a problem child.

779
00:47:26,245 --> 00:47:27,761
- I'm just happy I don't have to babysit

780
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,261
for you every day, Josh Kirby.

781
00:48:07,065 --> 00:48:09,315
(groaning)

782
00:48:10,217 --> 00:48:11,928
- Quick, he's coming.

783
00:48:11,928 --> 00:48:13,345
- The time mower!

784
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:16,901
- Josh!

785
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:20,651
Josh, what are you doing
out of your playpen.

786
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:27,549
That's the last time I
let you out of my sight.

787
00:48:27,549 --> 00:48:30,389
I gotta watch you extra
careful from now on.

788
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:32,485
If anything ever happened to you,

789
00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:34,416
I don't know what I'd do.

790
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,044
(baby cries)
Uh oh.

791
00:48:37,044 --> 00:48:39,294
Someone needs a new diaper.

792
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:44,163
- This is humiliating.

793
00:48:44,163 --> 00:48:48,050
I just messed myself
in front of everybody.

794
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,411
- Well, you said your
father was overprotective.

795
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:54,178
At least now you know how he got that way.

796
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:58,007
It was your own fault to
begin with, Josh Kirby.

797
00:48:58,007 --> 00:49:01,737
- This is more embarrassing
than baby pictures.

798
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:03,495
- Well I think it's cute.

799
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:05,193
And I think you're cute,

800
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,724
no matter what age you happen to be.

801
00:49:07,724 --> 00:49:10,151
All this excitement has made me hungry.

802
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:12,440
Josh Kirby, do I have your
permission to search the contents

803
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,669
of your family's cryogenic
food preservation unit?

804
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:18,278
- You wanna raid my fridge?

805
00:49:18,278 --> 00:49:19,528
Yeah, go ahead.

806
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,747
You're the most brilliant man
of the 25th century, right?

807
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:30,748
- Yeah.

808
00:49:30,748 --> 00:49:32,915
- Do you understand girls?

809
00:49:34,425 --> 00:49:35,588
- Sometimes.

810
00:49:35,588 --> 00:49:38,650
- Well, do you think
that when she said cute,

811
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,865
she meant, you're so cute
I'd like to pinch your cheeks

812
00:49:41,865 --> 00:49:44,554
and accidentally break all the
blood vessels in your face,

813
00:49:44,554 --> 00:49:48,253
or, you're so cute I'd let
you take me out on a date,

814
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:50,798
and maybe let you give
me a kiss on my doorstep

815
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:52,277
when we say goodnight?

816
00:49:52,277 --> 00:49:54,106
- How old did you say you were?

817
00:49:54,106 --> 00:49:54,939
- 14.

818
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:55,772
- 14.

819
00:49:55,772 --> 00:49:57,527
- But I'll be 16 in 23 months.

820
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:58,360
- Josh.

821
00:50:00,711 --> 00:50:01,544
Women,

822
00:50:02,502 --> 00:50:04,252
girls, are a mystery.

823
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:09,006
And every man must attempt
to unravel that mystery

824
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,923
on his own.

825
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:12,836
- But I hate mysteries.

826
00:50:12,836 --> 00:50:13,745
- And another thing.

827
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:15,880
It's best not to drive
yourself crazy about this.

828
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,977
But Azabeth Siege is from the future.

829
00:50:17,977 --> 00:50:19,983
A future far beyond the 25th century.

830
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:21,883
A future that may no longer exist

831
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:24,300
if our mission is successful.

832
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:28,635
It's best I take your
relationship with her

833
00:50:28,635 --> 00:50:30,385
one moment at a time.

834
00:50:56,654 --> 00:51:00,213
- Should we prepare for
the storm, Minister?

835
00:51:00,213 --> 00:51:01,854
- Not yet.

836
00:51:01,854 --> 00:51:04,437
I'm going to try something new.

837
00:51:06,038 --> 00:51:07,464
- Come on, Genghis.

838
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,547
There you go.

839
00:51:10,152 --> 00:51:11,242
- Yay, Daddy.

840
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:13,659
Nice job honey, you did good.

841
00:51:17,037 --> 00:51:18,537
- It's time, Josh.

842
00:51:27,077 --> 00:51:28,244
Hold on tight.

843
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:31,647
Next stop, the year 2494.

844
00:51:40,885 --> 00:51:41,960
- Well Dr. Zoetrope.

845
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,331
Not only are we still in the 20th century,

846
00:51:45,331 --> 00:51:47,498
but we're six inches tall!

847
00:51:50,188 --> 00:51:52,774
- Perhaps I miscalculated a bit.

848
00:51:52,774 --> 00:51:55,607
- Do I hear an admission of fault?

849
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:03,761
- Keep back!

850
00:52:13,386 --> 00:52:14,811
- It's gone, Minister.

851
00:52:14,811 --> 00:52:17,290
You actually managed
to destroy one of your

852
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,218
millennium steel tool dies.

853
00:52:20,218 --> 00:52:21,218
- Not quite.

854
00:52:22,185 --> 00:52:26,352
I've merely rendered it
invisible. (laughing)

855
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:39,428
(sentimental music)

856
00:53:01,008 --> 00:53:04,385
- Well, Azabeth was right, Mom.

857
00:53:04,385 --> 00:53:06,635
This is a great day for me.

858
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:11,965
I mean, I never thought I'd
get the chance to see you.

859
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,523
Not in this life, at least.

860
00:53:16,502 --> 00:53:18,406
And if I did see you, I never thought

861
00:53:18,406 --> 00:53:22,890
you'd be the size of the
Jolly Green Giant, either.

862
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:26,097
(sighs) But no matter how big you are,

863
00:53:26,097 --> 00:53:28,430
you're still beautiful, Mom.

864
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,945
I kept this picture of
us, at home, on my table,

865
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:34,112
just like you.

866
00:53:36,194 --> 00:53:38,781
I used to have dreams sometimes.

867
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:43,181
What you'd be like, the fun
things we'd do together.

868
00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:44,764
All kinds of stuff.

869
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,014
But then I'd wake up, and...

870
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:51,646
Well I just wanted to say,

871
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,036
this is reality Mom,

872
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:59,119
and it's better than any
dream I could ever have.

873
00:54:00,456 --> 00:54:01,539
- Josh Kirby?

874
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,740
Dr. Zoetrope sent me.

875
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,302
12 hours is almost up.

876
00:54:08,302 --> 00:54:10,034
It's time for you to use your powers

877
00:54:10,034 --> 00:54:12,010
to take us to the 25th century,

878
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:16,072
and bring the battle back to Irwin 1138.

879
00:54:16,072 --> 00:54:19,383
- Well maybe we could stay somehow.

880
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:22,883
I don't know, wait another 12 hours, or...

881
00:54:29,424 --> 00:54:32,184
- I am sorry, Josh Kirby.

882
00:54:32,184 --> 00:54:35,320
I know that you missed
your mother very much.

883
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,055
And it's important that
you spend as much time

884
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:39,805
with her as possible.

885
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:42,364
But you...

886
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:52,046
You are the only chance
for the future of mankind.

887
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,748
You know which is more important.

888
00:54:58,005 --> 00:54:59,685
- But Azabeth.

889
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:02,352
It's just, I missed her so much.

890
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:05,973
I didn't realize how much

891
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:09,732
until I finally got the chance to see her.

892
00:55:09,732 --> 00:55:10,955
Well maybe with more time,

893
00:55:10,955 --> 00:55:13,133
I can figure out a way
to communicate with her,

894
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:15,383
just let her know I'm here.

895
00:55:16,499 --> 00:55:17,948
- I know it is difficult

896
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:20,678
when you are faced with
a personal decision.

897
00:55:20,678 --> 00:55:24,178
And at the same time, a bigger duty calls.

898
00:55:25,657 --> 00:55:29,314
It is a hard life we
humans, and half-humans,

899
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:30,981
must sometimes lead.

900
00:55:32,259 --> 00:55:35,414
- Isn't there a code of Kang
that sums it all up for me

901
00:55:35,414 --> 00:55:37,914
and tells me what I should do?

902
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:44,753
- I'm all out of codes
of Kang, Josh Kirby.

903
00:55:47,704 --> 00:55:51,121
This one you have to decide for yourself.

904
00:56:08,749 --> 00:56:10,582
- Well, I've gotta go.

905
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:15,336
I've gotta try and save the universe.

906
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:18,282
It's nothing really.

907
00:56:18,282 --> 00:56:21,275
Well, it's been great seeing you.

908
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:23,358
Or, meeting you, that is.

909
00:56:24,395 --> 00:56:27,513
Oh, good luck on your final.

910
00:56:27,513 --> 00:56:30,182
I'm sure you'll do great.

911
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:32,849
Hey, don't just take it, ace it.

912
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:48,254
Goodbye, Mom.

913
00:56:49,411 --> 00:56:50,328
I love you.

914
00:56:57,391 --> 00:56:58,780
- Don, Don.

915
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,900
Don, wake up.

916
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,733
- What is it?

917
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:02,098
- There are these little people.

918
00:57:02,098 --> 00:57:04,445
- Whoa whoa, slow down, little
people, what do you mean?

919
00:57:04,445 --> 00:57:06,448
- Honey, they were right there.

920
00:57:06,448 --> 00:57:09,865
- I don't see any little people, sweetie.

921
00:57:12,756 --> 00:57:15,090
- You must think I'm nuts.

922
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,354
- No, no.

923
00:57:16,354 --> 00:57:19,624
What I think is that between
your schoolwork and the baby,

924
00:57:19,624 --> 00:57:22,220
you're spreading yourself a little thin.

925
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,221
- But Don.

926
00:57:23,221 --> 00:57:24,054
- Listen.

927
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:26,523
Too much stress can cause bad dreams.

928
00:57:26,523 --> 00:57:27,780
Nightmares.

929
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,613
- Okay.

930
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:30,904
- Besides, the only little person

931
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:34,654
we have to worry about
in this house is Josh.

932
00:57:36,765 --> 00:57:38,267
Goodnight.

933
00:57:38,267 --> 00:57:39,267
- Goodnight.

934
00:57:46,532 --> 00:57:47,782
- Dr. Zoetrope!

935
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,023
They can see us!

936
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:52,796
- It's nothing.

937
00:57:52,796 --> 00:57:55,862
Apparently a side effect to
our miniaturized stature.

938
00:57:55,862 --> 00:57:57,797
I'm fairly certain we'll be returned

939
00:57:57,797 --> 00:57:59,957
to our rightful dimensions
once we're back in hypertime,

940
00:57:59,957 --> 00:58:01,189
which won't be long now.

941
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:02,741
12 hours are up, Josh.

942
00:58:02,741 --> 00:58:05,109
Your time warrior powers
must have regenerated by now.

943
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:07,206
Let's head for the 25th
century immediately.

944
00:58:07,206 --> 00:58:08,854
The future must be saved.

945
00:58:08,854 --> 00:58:10,917
- All right, hang on tight.

946
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:15,084
Look out Irwin, here we come.
(dramatic music)

947
00:58:30,153 --> 00:58:31,418
- What's happening?

948
00:58:31,418 --> 00:58:32,834
Why isn't is working?

949
00:58:32,834 --> 00:58:33,836
- I don't know.

950
00:58:33,836 --> 00:58:36,163
I am doing everything the same.

951
00:58:36,163 --> 00:58:38,195
- Yeah, well concentrate, Josh.

952
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:40,403
It must work, or the world will be lost

953
00:58:40,403 --> 00:58:42,210
and the future will be doomed.

954
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,210
Concentrate.

955
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,850
- Look, Dr. Zoetrope, I'm trying, honest.

956
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:52,322
Maybe I need more time.

957
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:53,634
- That is not it!

958
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:55,650
It ha been more than 12 hours!

959
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:58,178
Now why aren't your time
warrior powers working?

960
00:58:58,178 --> 00:58:59,234
Why?

961
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:01,734
(baby crying)

962
00:59:06,948 --> 00:59:09,448
- Hang on Josh honey, hang on.

963
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:12,685
It's okay, it's okay, Josh.

964
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:16,226
Mom loves you.

965
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:18,972
- That's it.

966
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:19,805
Of course.

967
00:59:21,027 --> 00:59:22,451
- What's it?

968
00:59:22,451 --> 00:59:26,335
And why can't I summon the time lining?

969
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,999
- It makes perfect sense.

970
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:32,166
- Oh goodness gracious,
it's all right, it's okay.

971
00:59:34,465 --> 00:59:36,106
- I knew there had to be
some anomaly when two beings

972
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,988
of the exact same molecular structure

973
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:39,972
occupy the same time and space.

974
00:59:39,972 --> 00:59:41,396
Well, this is it.

975
00:59:41,396 --> 00:59:43,716
The infant Josh Kirby
is a natural inhabitant

976
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:45,220
of this time period.

977
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,444
Therefore, the time space continuum

978
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:50,820
is rejecting our Josh
Kirby's metahuman abilities.

979
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,820
- Could you try that again
Zoetrope, in English?

980
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,919
- Basically it boils down to this.

981
00:59:57,919 --> 01:00:02,158
There's only room for one time
warrior in this time period,

982
01:00:02,158 --> 01:00:03,158
and he's it.

983
01:00:08,259 --> 01:00:12,426
Good luck asking him to
transport us through time.

984
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:17,286
- Look, Dr. Zoetrope,
this is a setback, I know.

985
01:00:17,286 --> 01:00:18,965
But we can't give up.

986
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:21,841
We've got to find a way
to get to the future.

987
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:22,866
- With what, hmm?

988
01:00:22,866 --> 01:00:24,354
My good looks?

989
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,402
This is the late 20th century.

990
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:29,010
That was my mistake with the time mower.

991
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,442
There's no technology here
even remotely advanced enough

992
01:00:31,442 --> 01:00:34,020
to jerry-rig a time travel device.

993
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,022
It's 1980.

994
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:37,026
They barely have VCRS.

995
01:00:37,026 --> 01:00:38,930
- So what are you saying?

996
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,891
In order to whip up some sort
of time machine that works,

997
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:44,802
we need some technology from the future?

998
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:45,635
- Yes.

999
01:00:47,234 --> 01:00:48,936
- Well you're wearing it!

1000
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:51,519
And so are you, and so are you!

1001
01:00:52,537 --> 01:00:56,264
- [Zoetrope] Josh, what do you mean?

1002
01:00:56,264 --> 01:00:57,688
- The CDLs!

1003
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:59,688
- Josh, you're a genius.

1004
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:04,360
With the sophisticated machinery

1005
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,008
from our chrono-displacement locks,

1006
01:01:06,008 --> 01:01:09,758
I may, just may, be able
to rig something up.

1007
01:01:12,237 --> 01:01:14,669
With these various
doohickeys we've gathered up,

1008
01:01:14,669 --> 01:01:16,758
and with these electrodes
as a primary power source,

1009
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:18,645
we might just be in business.

1010
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:20,214
I just have to make a
few more adjustments,

1011
01:01:20,214 --> 01:01:22,230
and we'll be ready to try it out.

1012
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:24,550
- The steel mesh from the
screen door will come in handy.

1013
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,821
You'll need some sort of
battle garb of your own

1014
01:01:26,821 --> 01:01:30,179
if you're going to encounter
Irwin's time armor.

1015
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:31,361
- You know what?

1016
01:01:31,361 --> 01:01:33,937
This helmet actually looks pretty cool,

1017
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:35,569
for a thimble.

1018
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:36,865
- Thanks.

1019
01:01:36,865 --> 01:01:38,802
It reminded me of the battle helmet

1020
01:01:38,802 --> 01:01:41,025
worn by the Daconian guards of my time.

1021
01:01:41,025 --> 01:01:43,345
They were most honored
heroes of my people.

1022
01:01:43,345 --> 01:01:45,553
Until the slavers wiped them out.

1023
01:01:45,553 --> 01:01:46,865
- That's it!

1024
01:01:46,865 --> 01:01:50,365
It's not time armor, but it'll have to do.

1025
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,353
- So let's go!

1026
01:01:52,353 --> 01:01:53,571
Time's a-wasting.

1027
01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:56,292
- Unfortunately this
machine's only powerful enough

1028
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:58,196
to take one person through time.

1029
01:01:58,196 --> 01:02:02,386
But it will require the
use of all the CDL units.

1030
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:04,274
- Wait a minute, without the CDLs,

1031
01:02:04,274 --> 01:02:06,980
we can't remain in this time continuum.

1032
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,513
We'll be whisked away to limbo.

1033
01:02:09,513 --> 01:02:11,680
Lost in hypertime forever.

1034
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:15,903
Well forget it.

1035
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:18,570
I obviously didn't think it through.

1036
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,026
It's crazy.

1037
01:02:20,026 --> 01:02:21,551
It's insane.

1038
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:22,384
It's--

1039
01:02:22,384 --> 01:02:24,134
- The only way, Josh.

1040
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:26,451
- The only way?

1041
01:02:28,642 --> 01:02:30,050
You know something?

1042
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,035
Irwin was right about you.

1043
01:02:32,035 --> 01:02:35,035
You are an arrogant, selfish maniac.

1044
01:02:35,908 --> 01:02:38,599
What gives you the right to risk us

1045
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:41,522
so that you can reach Irwin's chrono-lab,

1046
01:02:41,522 --> 01:02:44,739
grab the Nullifier back from
him and save the future?

1047
01:02:44,739 --> 01:02:45,572
- Not me.

1048
01:02:45,572 --> 01:02:47,371
I'm not going. You are.

1049
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:48,405
- Me?

1050
01:02:48,405 --> 01:02:49,734
But why me?

1051
01:02:49,734 --> 01:02:51,061
- It's obvious.

1052
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:54,061
Josh Kirby, you're the time warrior.

1053
01:02:54,986 --> 01:02:58,966
- Wait, even if I'm okay
zipping through the time stream,

1054
01:02:58,966 --> 01:03:02,934
the rest of you won't be, you'll all be...

1055
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:05,616
You'll all be gone forever.

1056
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:08,072
- It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

1057
01:03:08,072 --> 01:03:09,081
- Well good for you.

1058
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:11,320
But you're not the only one involved.

1059
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,994
- I too am willing to
sacrifice, Josh Kirby.

1060
01:03:13,994 --> 01:03:15,914
Just as you must be willing
to shoulder the burden

1061
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:17,373
which only you can carry,

1062
01:03:17,373 --> 01:03:20,331
by going to stop Irwin without us.

1063
01:03:20,331 --> 01:03:21,333
- No, I can't.

1064
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,166
- But you must!

1065
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:23,237
You heard what Dr. Zoetrope said

1066
01:03:23,237 --> 01:03:25,892
about the Supreme Prefect
and his Decimator device.

1067
01:03:25,892 --> 01:03:28,392
You even saw it with your own eyes.

1068
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:31,955
If you do not go on, 25th
century Earth is doomed.

1069
01:03:31,955 --> 01:03:34,372
Doomed to continue under
the Decimator's yoke

1070
01:03:34,372 --> 01:03:36,262
of suffering and enslavement forever.

1071
01:03:36,262 --> 01:03:38,451
- But why should you sacrifice yourself

1072
01:03:38,451 --> 01:03:40,355
for a planet full of strangers?

1073
01:03:40,355 --> 01:03:43,605
What do you owe the 25th century Earth?

1074
01:03:44,776 --> 01:03:46,560
- You do not understand.

1075
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,571
Josh Kirby, I am not doing it

1076
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:50,825
because I owe 25th century Earth.

1077
01:03:50,825 --> 01:03:53,529
I'm doing this because I owe it to myself.

1078
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:56,761
As one who has personally
suffered the pains of slavery,

1079
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:58,959
do you think I could go
on living with myself

1080
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:01,545
knowing I had the chance
to free another world

1081
01:04:01,545 --> 01:04:05,737
and didn't take it, because
I didn't have the courage?

1082
01:04:05,737 --> 01:04:09,625
- But Azabeth, you'd be sacrificing
yourself to save humans!

1083
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,945
The same race that turned your people

1084
01:04:11,945 --> 01:04:13,579
into slaves to begin with!

1085
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:15,283
- What are you saying, Josh Kirby?

1086
01:04:15,283 --> 01:04:17,492
Are you saying that
because the slaver warlords

1087
01:04:17,492 --> 01:04:19,107
that terrorized my home were humans,

1088
01:04:19,107 --> 01:04:23,133
that I should se each and
every human as my enemy?

1089
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:23,966
Even you?

1090
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:33,993
- All right.

1091
01:04:33,993 --> 01:04:36,057
Now listen to me Prism.

1092
01:04:36,057 --> 01:04:37,640
It's all up to you.

1093
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,568
It's possible your people
invented the Nullifier.

1094
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:46,360
Maybe even possible your
people invented time itself.

1095
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,263
But I need an answer from you.

1096
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:50,930
Not the answer you think I want.

1097
01:04:52,074 --> 01:04:54,844
Or the answer you think Zoetrope wants.

1098
01:04:54,844 --> 01:04:58,104
Or even the answer you
think Azabeth wants.

1099
01:04:58,104 --> 01:05:00,392
Now look, I know you understand me,

1100
01:05:00,392 --> 01:05:02,729
so just shake your head yes or no.

1101
01:05:02,729 --> 01:05:05,103
Do you want to be a part of this?

1102
01:05:05,103 --> 01:05:07,303
Is this the right thing to do?

1103
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,303
- Of course, Josh Kirby.

1104
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,484
That's why I'm here.

1105
01:05:12,484 --> 01:05:14,401
Go ahead Josh, take it.

1106
01:05:17,685 --> 01:05:18,518
Go on.

1107
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,836
- Your little friend has done his part

1108
01:05:24,836 --> 01:05:27,003
for the future of mankind.

1109
01:05:30,223 --> 01:05:33,056
Now come and see what you must do.

1110
01:05:34,727 --> 01:05:37,911
All you have to do is snap
my CDL, then Azabeth's,

1111
01:05:37,911 --> 01:05:39,752
into place right alongside Prism's.

1112
01:05:39,752 --> 01:05:41,951
I calibrated your stopwatch
as a time trigger,

1113
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:44,095
so when you're ready to
go, just push the button.

1114
01:05:44,095 --> 01:05:45,951
It's already programmed
to take you straight back

1115
01:05:45,951 --> 01:05:47,651
to Irwin 1138's 25th century chrono-lab,

1116
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:49,091
so you don't have to worry

1117
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:50,715
about navigating your way
through the time stream.

1118
01:05:50,715 --> 01:05:54,540
Unfortunately, I can't say
as much for the ride itself.

1119
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,947
With the primitive materials

1120
01:05:55,947 --> 01:05:57,595
I had to employ for construction,

1121
01:05:57,595 --> 01:06:01,530
I'm afraid it's going
to be a very bumpy ride.

1122
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:02,537
- And then what?

1123
01:06:02,537 --> 01:06:04,921
I mean, even if I do get
back to Irwin's chrono-lab

1124
01:06:04,921 --> 01:06:06,735
before he starts launching
Nullifier components

1125
01:06:06,735 --> 01:06:10,410
all across time, what do I do to stop him?

1126
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:13,019
- I'm sure you'll think of something.

1127
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:15,019
You're the time warrior.

1128
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,117
Be seeing you.

1129
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,811
- I can't believe this!

1130
01:06:26,094 --> 01:06:27,429
No Azabeth, don't.

1131
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:28,727
- Stop it, Josh.

1132
01:06:28,727 --> 01:06:30,358
Stop being so selfish!

1133
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:31,525
- Selfish?

1134
01:06:31,525 --> 01:06:32,532
- Yes, selfish!

1135
01:06:32,532 --> 01:06:34,762
Quit thinking only of yourself!

1136
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:38,503
Yes it will be difficult
for you to go on alone.

1137
01:06:38,503 --> 01:06:40,619
But you have a responsibility.

1138
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:45,323
And the future of your
world hangs in the balance.

1139
01:06:45,323 --> 01:06:46,904
- Azabeth,

1140
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:48,904
you just called me Josh.

1141
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,633
- I'm sorry I yelled at you, Josh.

1142
01:06:57,529 --> 01:07:00,873
I guess I'm just a little scared.

1143
01:07:00,873 --> 01:07:02,540
- No, no, it's okay.

1144
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,134
- Full-blooded human or not,

1145
01:07:09,134 --> 01:07:13,301
Josh Kirby, you are the finest
being I have ever known.

1146
01:07:14,747 --> 01:07:19,018
And it is said that, in a
single day with one such as you,

1147
01:07:19,018 --> 01:07:21,935
is worth a lifetime with any other.

1148
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:25,427
- Well I thought you said

1149
01:07:25,427 --> 01:07:28,510
there weren't any more codes of Kang.

1150
01:07:29,957 --> 01:07:31,207
- There aren't.

1151
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:35,347
That one's a code of Azabeth.

1152
01:07:55,014 --> 01:07:57,097
- Goodbye, Azabeth Siege,

1153
01:07:57,989 --> 01:08:01,906
leader of 10, follower
of the 21 codes of Kang.

1154
01:08:03,462 --> 01:08:05,781
I'll never forget you.

1155
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:06,950
And don't worry.

1156
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:11,117
There's no way I'll let
your sacrifice be in vain!

1157
01:08:13,142 --> 01:08:15,975
(uplifting music)

1158
01:08:31,257 --> 01:08:32,090
Here goes.

1159
01:08:55,036 --> 01:08:58,716
- (laughing) Who would have thought it?

1160
01:08:58,716 --> 01:09:01,743
The most beautiful sight I've ever seen,

1161
01:09:01,743 --> 01:09:04,243
and it's impossible to see it.

1162
01:09:07,135 --> 01:09:09,344
Disassemble the Nullifier components,

1163
01:09:09,344 --> 01:09:11,511
and prepare for the storm.

1164
01:09:37,152 --> 01:09:40,112
It's a primary law of physics,

1165
01:09:40,112 --> 01:09:43,631
that what you can't see,
you can't reassemble.

1166
01:09:43,631 --> 01:09:47,632
Now no one will ever be able
to track the six of you down

1167
01:09:47,632 --> 01:09:51,799
and put you together again,
no matter how bright he is.

1168
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:57,800
(beeping)

1169
01:10:08,433 --> 01:10:11,075
- Hand over the Nullifier, Irwin, now!

1170
01:10:11,075 --> 01:10:12,187
- Never!

1171
01:10:12,187 --> 01:10:14,908
You should have stayed
back in the magic cabin,

1172
01:10:14,908 --> 01:10:15,971
Joshua, with your friends!

1173
01:10:15,971 --> 01:10:18,604
- My friends are all gone thanks to you!

1174
01:10:18,604 --> 01:10:19,739
- Good riddance.

1175
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:21,489
Prepare to join them!

1176
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:25,490
Ah, you little pest!

1177
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:28,146
Look what you made me do.

1178
01:10:28,146 --> 01:10:29,698
- Minister, if you keep firing

1179
01:10:29,698 --> 01:10:31,730
you'll destroy the laboratory.

1180
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:32,962
- [Computer] Intruder alert.

1181
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,818
- Ah, warning, schwarning.

1182
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:38,164
What's the use of an alert if
the intruder's already here?

1183
01:10:38,164 --> 01:10:41,602
Well at least, if I can't
blast you to smithereens,

1184
01:10:41,602 --> 01:10:44,144
but I can send these Nullifier components

1185
01:10:44,144 --> 01:10:46,912
out of your reach forever.

1186
01:10:46,912 --> 01:10:49,245
Get that toy off that clock!

1187
01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:56,665
- No!

1188
01:11:03,374 --> 01:11:08,162
I'm getting sick and tired
of this invisibility!

1189
01:11:08,162 --> 01:11:09,662
- Load number two.

1190
01:11:16,169 --> 01:11:17,002
- Okay.

1191
01:11:28,352 --> 01:11:29,185
See Dad?

1192
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,935
I told you I could play football.

1193
01:11:39,569 --> 01:11:41,732
- Blast you, Josh Kirby!

1194
01:11:41,732 --> 01:11:42,565
Get him!

1195
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,779
- Now I know what an end zone feels like.

1196
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:49,029
Four, two, hut!

1197
01:11:55,171 --> 01:11:56,004
- No!

1198
01:12:13,222 --> 01:12:17,111
- Now it's just you and
me, Minister of Science.

1199
01:12:17,111 --> 01:12:19,944
- Do you realize what you've done?

1200
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,446
- Gee, I'm sorry Irwin,

1201
01:12:23,446 --> 01:12:25,958
but you almost destroyed the universe.

1202
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:27,846
You've gotta pay for your crimes

1203
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:29,734
and that's all there is to it.

1204
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:32,502
- You, you, have ruined my plans.

1205
01:12:32,502 --> 01:12:34,378
You've destroyed my lab!

1206
01:12:34,378 --> 01:12:36,470
You've sent my highly trained technicians

1207
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:38,199
into the limbo of hypertime,

1208
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:41,199
and you're not getting away with it.

1209
01:12:49,554 --> 01:12:50,387
Give it up, Josh.

1210
01:12:50,387 --> 01:12:52,874
I've got the height and the reach.

1211
01:12:52,874 --> 01:12:55,354
- Maybe so, Irwin, but I've got the right,

1212
01:12:55,354 --> 01:12:58,559
and that's all that matters in the end!

1213
01:12:58,559 --> 01:12:59,392
I hope.

1214
01:13:14,299 --> 01:13:15,627
- Stop it.

1215
01:13:15,627 --> 01:13:16,460
Stop it!

1216
01:13:17,403 --> 01:13:18,973
I tell you, stop it!

1217
01:13:18,973 --> 01:13:20,453
- Let's see how your armor holds up

1218
01:13:20,453 --> 01:13:22,536
if it's 10,000 years old.

1219
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,072
- Stop it!

1220
01:13:38,215 --> 01:13:40,255
Prepare for the storm.

1221
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:42,431
Prepare for the storm!

1222
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:44,767
Prepare for the storm.

1223
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:48,434
- No, I'm sorry Irwin,
but the storm's over.

1224
01:14:05,423 --> 01:14:07,239
No, you're too late, Dr. Zoetrope.

1225
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:09,739
I've taken care of it already.

1226
01:14:10,727 --> 01:14:12,544
- Who are you?

1227
01:14:12,544 --> 01:14:14,703
- What, you mean you don't remember?

1228
01:14:14,703 --> 01:14:17,183
- I'll have you know, I haven't forgotten

1229
01:14:17,183 --> 01:14:19,471
a single pertinent piece
of acquired knowledge

1230
01:14:19,471 --> 01:14:22,032
since reaching the age of
seven and a half months.

1231
01:14:22,032 --> 01:14:24,321
- Well Dr. Zoetrope, I hope you remember

1232
01:14:24,321 --> 01:14:27,647
how to activate an
invisible Nullifier device,

1233
01:14:27,647 --> 01:14:30,240
so that you can nullify
all the evil effects

1234
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,676
of the Supreme Prefect's Decimator.

1235
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:34,149
- Sure, no problem.

1236
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:34,982
After all.

1237
01:14:34,982 --> 01:14:37,252
- Please, don't tell me, I know.

1238
01:14:37,252 --> 01:14:41,419
You're the single most brilliant
man of the 25th century.

1239
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,753
- How did you defeat Irwin 1138,

1240
01:14:59,753 --> 01:15:01,929
and what's that refuse lying at his feet?

1241
01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:03,913
- That's what your time
armor's gonna look like

1242
01:15:03,913 --> 01:15:05,497
in about 10,000 years.

1243
01:15:05,497 --> 01:15:06,793
- That's ridiculous.

1244
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:09,385
My time armor was built
to last a million years!

1245
01:15:09,385 --> 01:15:12,052
- Go back to the drawing boards.

1246
01:15:15,269 --> 01:15:16,772
Irwin, don't worry.

1247
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:18,740
I'm sure you'll be the most brilliant man

1248
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:21,037
in whatever intergalactic
prison they put you in.

1249
01:15:21,037 --> 01:15:22,236
- Do you really think so?

1250
01:15:22,236 --> 01:15:23,308
- Sure.

1251
01:15:23,308 --> 01:15:25,136
- It's true.

1252
01:15:25,136 --> 01:15:29,016
The cerebral weight of
the average criminal brain

1253
01:15:29,016 --> 01:15:32,016
is infinitesimal compared to my own.

1254
01:15:36,456 --> 01:15:37,824
- Irwin's cloaking formulation

1255
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:40,407
is simple enough to deactivate.

1256
01:15:49,561 --> 01:15:50,840
- So I guess I'm stuck here

1257
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,680
until my time warrior powers regenerate

1258
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,584
and I can get myself back home.

1259
01:15:54,584 --> 01:15:55,587
- How long is that?

1260
01:15:55,587 --> 01:15:56,893
- About 12 hours.

1261
01:15:56,893 --> 01:15:59,225
- Well sit back and enjoy
the show, young man.

1262
01:15:59,225 --> 01:16:01,642
A lot can happen in 12 hours.

1263
01:16:11,286 --> 01:16:13,910
- Irwin, what's going on over there?

1264
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:17,847
I've got reports coming in
from all over the planet,

1265
01:16:17,847 --> 01:16:21,597
of people rising up,
thinking for themselves,

1266
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:26,390
throwing off the yoke of my Decimator

1267
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:28,640
as if it didn't even exist.

1268
01:16:30,006 --> 01:16:32,439
I demand an explanation.

1269
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:35,439
- Ah, well, it's just a glitch, sir.

1270
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:38,711
It's just a mere setback.

1271
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:40,790
- I'm sorry to be the one
who has to tell you this,

1272
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:44,957
but you're everlasting dynasty
is about to be nullified.

1273
01:17:07,171 --> 01:17:09,504
(dog barks)

1274
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:19,133
(alarm ringing)

1275
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:36,356
- Dr Zoetrope?

1276
01:17:38,645 --> 01:17:39,895
Azabeth? Prism?

1277
01:17:45,203 --> 01:17:46,869
- [Josh] Get up, Josh!

1278
01:17:46,869 --> 01:17:49,404
Another day, another dollar!

1279
01:17:49,404 --> 01:17:50,237
- Dad?

1280
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:58,437
- Whoa, what's all this for?

1281
01:17:58,437 --> 01:18:00,693
- Nothing, I'm just glad to be home.

1282
01:18:00,693 --> 01:18:03,221
You know, you look better with grey hair.

1283
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:06,037
You look more distinguished.

1284
01:18:06,037 --> 01:18:06,870
Genghis!

1285
01:18:07,973 --> 01:18:09,301
How you doing?

1286
01:18:09,301 --> 01:18:10,468
How you doing?

1287
01:18:11,398 --> 01:18:12,901
How you doing?

1288
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:14,549
- Crazy kid, you're acting like

1289
01:18:14,549 --> 01:18:16,628
you haven't seen that dog in years.

1290
01:18:16,628 --> 01:18:18,389
- How you doing?

1291
01:18:18,389 --> 01:18:19,556
How you doing?

1292
01:18:22,016 --> 01:18:24,409
- And, after studying the many artifacts,

1293
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:27,481
we can determine that the
ancient Cardaginian people

1294
01:18:27,481 --> 01:18:31,648
practiced the somewhat tasteless
act of human sacrifice.

1295
01:18:33,768 --> 01:18:35,851
They also rode elephants.

1296
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:46,953
- Okay, so wait a minute,
Josh man Kirby man,

1297
01:18:46,953 --> 01:18:49,065
you're saying that in
this crazy dream of yours,

1298
01:18:49,065 --> 01:18:52,329
my great-great-great-great-great-grandson

1299
01:18:52,329 --> 01:18:55,225
was the second-most brilliant
man in the 25th century,

1300
01:18:55,225 --> 01:18:57,977
and because of that he was
going to destroy the universe?

1301
01:18:57,977 --> 01:19:00,967
And had to travel through all
kinds of crazy mixed-up times

1302
01:19:00,967 --> 01:19:02,455
in order to stop it?

1303
01:19:02,455 --> 01:19:05,767
Man, why can't I have
cool dreams like that?

1304
01:19:05,767 --> 01:19:08,007
You know what I always
dream about, Josh man?

1305
01:19:08,007 --> 01:19:09,008
Shrimp!

1306
01:19:09,008 --> 01:19:10,487
Live shrimp, baby shrimp,

1307
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:12,888
boiled shrimp, fried
shrimp, shrimp scampi!

1308
01:19:12,888 --> 01:19:15,038
I don't even like shrimp.

1309
01:19:15,038 --> 01:19:16,478
- You know what?

1310
01:19:16,478 --> 01:19:19,296
Your ancestor had a theory,

1311
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,134
that once time was altered,

1312
01:19:21,134 --> 01:19:22,974
it couldn't be put back to normal.

1313
01:19:22,974 --> 01:19:25,038
But I could find he was wrong.

1314
01:19:25,038 --> 01:19:27,486
You know, you're just
as crazy as ever, Irwin.

1315
01:19:27,486 --> 01:19:30,702
- Hey Josh, where's my homework?

1316
01:19:30,702 --> 01:19:31,559
- Homework?

1317
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:33,461
- Don't tell me you didn't do my homework?

1318
01:19:33,461 --> 01:19:34,294
- Yeah!

1319
01:19:34,294 --> 01:19:36,543
Don't tell him that.

1320
01:19:36,543 --> 01:19:39,160
- Hey, Beth, how's it going?

1321
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,493
- Do I know you?

1322
01:19:42,117 --> 01:19:42,950
- Hey.

1323
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:43,783
- Hey.

1324
01:19:43,783 --> 01:19:46,366
Hurry up and meet me for lunch.

1325
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,921
- You got it, babe.

1326
01:19:49,921 --> 01:19:50,922
- Okay Duke.

1327
01:19:50,922 --> 01:19:52,738
You can punch my lights out.

1328
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:54,241
But it's not gonna change the fact

1329
01:19:54,241 --> 01:19:55,729
that I'm smarter than you.

1330
01:19:55,729 --> 01:19:57,410
And I'll always be smarter than you

1331
01:19:57,410 --> 01:20:00,642
until you decide to study and
do your homework for a change.

1332
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:03,445
- Well Kirby, this is gonna hurt your face

1333
01:20:03,445 --> 01:20:06,445
a lot more than it hurts my fist.

1334
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:07,278
- Hey.

1335
01:20:07,278 --> 01:20:09,425
Pick on somebody your own size, creep.

1336
01:20:09,425 --> 01:20:11,401
- What do you have a death wish, chick?

1337
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:12,937
Don't you know who I am?

1338
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:14,617
- Ah sure, you're a jerk with muscles,

1339
01:20:14,617 --> 01:20:16,761
no brain and a broken hand.

1340
01:20:16,761 --> 01:20:18,617
- There's nothing wrong with my hand.

1341
01:20:18,617 --> 01:20:19,605
(groans)

1342
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:20,645
- Now there is.

1343
01:20:20,645 --> 01:20:22,238
- You're dead, chick!

1344
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:23,071
Get her!

1345
01:20:26,163 --> 01:20:28,099
- That was real.

1346
01:20:28,099 --> 01:20:30,258
- I hate bullies.

1347
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:31,730
You okay?

1348
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:32,917
- Azabeth?

1349
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:35,056
- No, but pretty close, Elizabeth.

1350
01:20:35,056 --> 01:20:37,465
Elizabeth Kang, and you are?

1351
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:39,612
- Josh, Josh Kirby.

1352
01:20:39,612 --> 01:20:42,633
And this is my best friend, Irwin Lee.

1353
01:20:42,633 --> 01:20:44,565
- Pleased to make your
acquaintance, ma'am.

1354
01:20:44,565 --> 01:20:46,279
Say, you're new around here, aren't you?

1355
01:20:46,279 --> 01:20:47,766
- Yeah, transfer student.

1356
01:20:47,766 --> 01:20:50,086
- You look a little
old for the 12th grade.

1357
01:20:50,086 --> 01:20:53,078
- Well, things aren't
always as they appear.

1358
01:20:53,078 --> 01:20:54,711
- You're a transfer student?

1359
01:20:54,711 --> 01:20:55,787
Where from?

1360
01:20:55,787 --> 01:20:57,856
- It's kind of far from here,
you wouldn't have heard of it.

1361
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:00,497
- That was one awesome
display of babe fu, lady.

1362
01:21:00,497 --> 01:21:03,664
Think you could teach me some of that?

1363
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:09,626
- Guess Irwin 1138's
theory was right after all.

1364
01:21:09,626 --> 01:21:13,210
You can't get time exactly back to normal.

1365
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:18,026
So, I guess since you saved me,
we're finally even now, huh?

1366
01:21:18,026 --> 01:21:19,472
Don't you remember?

1367
01:21:19,472 --> 01:21:20,902
The 12th code.

1368
01:21:20,902 --> 01:21:24,902
- I have no idea what
you are taking about.

1369
01:21:24,902 --> 01:21:26,069
- What's that?

1370
01:21:27,302 --> 01:21:28,886
- Oh, it's a prism.

1371
01:21:28,886 --> 01:21:30,630
You hold it up to a light source

1372
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:32,716
and it glows with every
color in the spectrum.

1373
01:21:32,716 --> 01:21:34,228
- Let's hit it guys, it's lunch time.

1374
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:36,884
- Oh, the cafeteria can be
a pretty confusing place

1375
01:21:36,884 --> 01:21:39,220
without a guide to show you the ropes.

1376
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:42,532
There's long lines, old
ladies with hair nets,

1377
01:21:42,532 --> 01:21:45,589
and there's always a
controversy with the milk money.

1378
01:21:45,589 --> 01:21:47,079
- I've heard interesting stories

1379
01:21:47,079 --> 01:21:49,724
about the meatloaf at this school.

1380
01:21:49,724 --> 01:21:52,714
- I'm sorry ma'am, I can
neither confirm nor deny

1381
01:21:52,714 --> 01:21:54,634
any of the meatloaf rumors.

1382
01:21:54,634 --> 01:21:56,746
So I guess you're just gonna
have to try the meatloaf

1383
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:59,229
firsthand, if you have the courage.

1384
01:21:59,229 --> 01:22:01,370
- Well, I'll try anything once.

1385
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,453
Lead the way, Josh Kirby.

1386
01:22:04,442 --> 01:22:07,359
(triumphant music)

1387
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:14,929
(electric buzzing)

1388
01:26:20,376 --> 01:26:23,209
