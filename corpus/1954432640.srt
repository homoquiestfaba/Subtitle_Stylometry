I'm not a honey guy,
but go on.

If I give you charity,

348
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,569
I must take away funds from
one of the several families

349
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,325
to whom we currently
provide assistance.

350
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,810
Families who actually
need the assistance.

351
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,807
Not just someone who's made
a choice to be an actor

352
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,566
and thusly cannot
provide for his family.

353
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,244
But what about my dream?

354
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,926
I mean, doesn't God believe
in my pursuit of happiness?

355
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,050
No! That's the Declaration
of Independence.

356
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,091
Thomas Jefferson
cared about your happiness.

357
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,168
God wants you to provide for
your family, Mr. Bloom.

358
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,323
God believes your family
deserves both milk and honey.

359
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,041
Well, thank you.

360
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,401

What are you gonna teach them?
How to do the acting?

There's websites, Dad.
There's books.

376
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,323
It's only till the end of the semester.
We'll be fine.

377
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,606
You're burdening them
with your fears.

378
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,121
Just 'cause you got beat up in the
public school doesn't mean they will.

379
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,201
You got beat up?

You marry a half-Jew, you provide
your children with absolutely

no sense of spirituality
or faith in a higher power.

387
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,961
Now, for dessert, you
spoon-feed them all your fears.

It's a mess, Aidan.

the outfit I got you today.

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,246
I'm not wearing that.

392
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,321
Really?

393
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,847
I thought it
was so cute and...

394
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,641
Mom, do my clothes
embarrass you?

395
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,407
No. No.

Whomever.

00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,809
Then why do you want me to dress
like I'm on the Disney Channel?

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,287
I just thought that since
you're not going to yeshiva

402
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,842
that you might want to try
something more colorful.

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,329

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

406
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,202
That God is testing
my faith right now.

407
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,846
And I probably shouldn't
make any drastic changes.

408
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,921
I'm sorry, Mom.

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,606
No, don't be sorry.
It's fine.

forget about it.

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,645
Okay, well, I guess you got a few
months if you change your mind, so...

517
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,489
GRACE: Right. Cool.

518
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,241
Yeah. Okay, well,
I'll see you later.

519
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,361
Yeah. See ya.

520
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Okay-

521
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,323
Bye.
Bye, Jesse.

522
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,406
(SIGHS)

523
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,081
Okay, good morning,
students.

524
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,565
Good morning.
Goodbye.

525
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,722
Okay, we'll start
with attendance.

526
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,086
Grace.
Here!

527
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,924
And Too-ker?

528
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,490
This is boring already.

529
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,921
Oh. We'll take
that as a "here."

530
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,480
Okay, I wanna focus on what
you're doing in school.

531
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,088
Grace, what are you currently
working on in school?

532
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
Geometry.

533
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,568
<i>(SINGING) Geometry, geometry</i>

534
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,086
<i>This is the song
for geometry</i>

535
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,811
Okay, who knows
what this guy is?

536
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,644
Triangle!
AIDAN: Great!

537
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,768
No extra points for yelling,
but you are correct.

538
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
Yay, recess!

539
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,123
No, no, no, no recess. Back, back,
back, no recess. Thank you.

540
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,646
And can you please sit on
your ass and not your head?

541
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,370
An ass is a donkey.

542
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,169
That's correct.
You get an A in biology.

543
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,560
Dad?
AIDAN: Yes.

544
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,085
I'm in honors math.

545
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,209
We're learning things like supplementary
and complimentary angles,

546
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,320
determining the area of a
three-dimensional shape, circumferences.

547
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,801
I know all that, Grace.
We're starting with...

548
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,644
We're starting with
some of the basic stuff,

549
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,802
and then going to
the good stuff, you know?

550
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,763
You go see Sting
in concert,

551
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,281
he's not gonna just jump
into The Police songs.

552
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,850
You're gonna have to
hear a couple hours of

553
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,809
some wacky stuff
with the dizzery-do.

554
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,405
Dad, I have to
take a choom.

555
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,481
What's a choom?

556
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,130
It's how we say
"shit" in school.

557
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,202
Swear jar!
I don't have any money.

558
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,203
See, that's where the whole swear
jar thing falls apart for me.

559
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,850
I'm the only one
putting money into it.

560
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,570
It's Hebrew for "brown."

561
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,721
Oh.

562
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,927
Got it!

563
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,841
You are free to leave the
classroom for your brown. Enjoy.

564
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,881
Grace, is this
triangle complimentary?

565
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,645
Or is it one of
those supplementary guys?

566
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,803
A triangle can't be
complimentary or supplementary.

567
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,690
Only the angles that comprise
it can be judged that way.

568
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,762
Right. Good.
Good, exactly.

569
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,922
The triangle that you drew,
albeit poorly, is isosceles,

570
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,686
meaning that at least two of
its sides are equal in length.

571
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Right.

572
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,041
So, for example,

573
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,809
what angle is complimentary
to a 45-degree angle?

574
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,562
Well, if they're
gonna add up to 90,

575
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,971
it would be
a 45-degree angle.

576
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,367
Correct.
Yes!

577
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,363
Good. Now for
a supplementary angle...

578
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,482
Hey! Hey!
Tucker!

579
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,840
What are you doing, man? We're
in the middle of a lesson.

580
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,810
I lied about
having to <i>choom,</i> Dad.

581
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,405
I just wanted to
kill the triangle.

582
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,960
No! Well, turn it off. We are
in the middle of school.

583
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,121
This isn't fun time.

584
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,448
I was pretending
the triangle was Arab.

What? Oh, my God.
Who told you that?

587
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,085
Not all Arabs are bad.

588
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,084
Levi Goldfarb said all
Arabs want to kill Jews.

589
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,731
Well, Levi Goldfarb is wrong.
That's not true at all.

590
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,245
Well, how do we know
which ones are bad?

591
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,402
(STAMMERING)
It's complicated,

592
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,569
and I didn't know we were
gonna get there on day one,

593
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,246
but, um, for starters
there's al-Qaeda.

594
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,600
The black weatherman?

595
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,841
No, that's Al Roker.

596
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,408
Al Roker wants
to kill Jews?

597
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,528
No, buddy, he's very good
friends with Matt Lauer.

598
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,807
I'm pretty sure he's Jewish.
We'll Google it.

599
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,245
Grace is
the teacher?

600
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,129
Yes, Grace is the
teacher for the minute.

601
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,281
Grace is so boring!

602
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,010
Don't say that.
No, I'm not!

603
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,241
I want to be the teacher!

604
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,163
Okay, you can be. What
do you want to teach us?

605
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,924
How to be an idiot.
Don't say that.

606
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,650
I am not an idiot! And
you're in love with Jesse.

607
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,245
No, she's not.
No, I'm not!

608
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,129
Then why did you write his
name all over your notebook?

609
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,361
You wrote his name
all over your notebook?

610
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,441
What is wrong with you?
Yeah, you know what?

611
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,284

not look in her notebook.

I know it looks weird,
but they're having a lesson.

626
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,085
Aidan, why are the children
duct-taped to chairs?

627
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,801
They wouldn't listen to me.

628
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,291
I couldn't get
control of them, Sarah.

629
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,443
They asked about al-Qaeda. I have to
work on this audition for tomorrow,

630
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,808
and LeVar Burton seems to be the
only thing that calms them down.

631
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,247
Fortunately for us,
I have <i>Roots.</i>

Okay, this is
not gonna work.

633

You can't just
show the kids videos,

634
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,921
and you certainly can't
force them into learning.

635
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,080
Well, then what's
your idea?

636
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,282
Because they're fighting
every single thing I try.

637
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,727
We need to regroup.

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,526
Why don't we go to dinner?

Who's gonna babysit?

640
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,480
Lego Death Star is worth
three hours of babysitting,

641
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,205
if, and only if, it's in the box,
and said box is in mint condition.

It is. It's brand-new.

No. No.

00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,841
What? That was like
100 years ago.

649
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,890
It's the first thing
that came to my mind.

650
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,446
I remember I was lying on
the beach reading a book,

651
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,249
and you were
taking those lessons.

652
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,846
And I was watching you

653
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,844
and you kept
trying to get up,

654
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,846
trying to get up, and
then you finally got up.

655
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,730
And I couldn't see your face
'cause you were kinda far out.

656
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,729
I could just feel it,
this elation,

657
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,561
this pure Joy.

658
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,362
The happiest you've ever seen
me is a smile you never saw?

659
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,849
I guess, yeah.
Is that weird?

660
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,881

in a bizarre kind of way.

00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,761
What's the happiest
you've ever seen me?

663
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,923
You were doing a Shakespeare
thing outside at Northwestern.

664
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,126

665
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,281

There were a few people that
were there, but I get the point.

670
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,481
It wasn't even
a real show.

671
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,449
You were just, like, in the
middle of a soccer field.

672
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,727
It was a traveling
production.

673
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,963

fucking thrilling to watch.

674

'Cause you loved words.
You loved poetry.

it kinda made me feel sad.

believe in you.

Why did seeing me love
Shakespeare make you sad?

680
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,130
I don't know.

681
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,771
I was terrified that
I'd never ever find

682
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,330
that kind of passion
in my life.

683
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,771
And the truth is,
I haven't.

684
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,731
I input data

a fart buzzer.

it, all those years,

all the things that he saw with
his eyes through those lenses.

1141

was a microbiology professor.

when Grandpa comes home.

then why is he coming home?

be alone in a scary hospital.

1193
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,531
So sick.
Mmm...

1194
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,846
(ENGINE REVS)
Okay, attendance.

1195
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,160

Here!

1196
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,004
Tucker.
Here.

1197
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,682
What's your name?
Anthony.

1198
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,046
Anthony's here, too, Dad.

1199
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,248
AIDAN: All right, Anthony.
Welcome to our classroom.

1200
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,442
Now, kids, unless
you're on the Autobahn,

1201
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,807
you're never gonna get a
car like this up to speed.

1202
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,809
So in a city like LA,

1203
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,484
it's really about
what it sounds like

1204
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,164
when you floor it
from a full stop.

1205
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,481
Yes, but, kids, we're
on Robertson Boulevard.

1206
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,130
So there will
be no flooring it

1207
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,725
from a full stop,
will there be?

1208
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,088
No, sir.
Thank you.

1209

1210
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,971
Did I scare you?

1211
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,649
I thought if I ever
saw you here alone,

1212
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,683
you'd be putting
a pillow over my face.

1213
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,924
I looked.

1214
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,764
You're lying on
the only two in the room.

1215

1216
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,685
I've been watching
the paramedics

1217
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,171
come and go for
the last half-hour.

1218
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,561
And every few minutes
they race in at full speed

1219
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,520
doing everything they can
to save someone's life

1220
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,291
and then a few
minutes later,

1221
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,011
they all walk outside
and smoke cigarettes.

1222
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,728
You never really think about
death until you're here.

Can I offer you

1228

I'm glad to see you're
keeping your sense of humor.

1229
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,044
What else am I
supposed to do?

1230
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,651
Eventually things
get tragic enough

1231
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,404
and they circle
back to comedy.

1232
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,203
(SIGHS) Yeah.

1233
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,885
You know, I don't think
I ever told you this,

1234
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,530
but when I lost my sister, you were
the most helpful person to me.

1235
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,644
Really?
Yeah.

1236
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,683
I mean, I'm glad if I was, but I
don't even remember what I said.

1237
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,891
You said,

1238
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,329
"Nothing in life will call
upon us to be more courageous

1239
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,926
"than facing
the fact that it ends.

1240
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,489
"But on the other side of
heartbreak is wisdom."

1241
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,361
I said that?

1242
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,601
Yeah.

1243
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,251
That was good advice.

1244
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,761
(LAUGHING)

1245
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,846
And now here I am, a <i>shiva
</i> waiting to happen. (SIGHS)

1246
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,604
Well, the wisdom
that came out for me

1247
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,921
was that the things left
unsaid stay with us forever.

1248
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,211
I wish nothing more

1249
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,886
than if I could tell my
sister how much I loved her

1250
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,007
and that I
always idolized her.

1251
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,285
But we never said
those things.

1252
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,567
We just weren't
like that.

1253
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,089
And suddenly one day
she's gone.

1254
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,446
And I have all
these things to say,

1255
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,806
but no one to say them to.

(SIGHS)

1257
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,847
Both my boys
know how I feel.

1258
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,004
Are you sure, Gabe?

1259
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,645
I told them
I wanted to retire.

1260
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,651
I lied.

1261
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,124
They pushed me out.

1262
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,084
'Cause I wasn't keeping
up with technology.

1263
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,921
Don't let anyone
push them out.

1264
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,888
Have you told them this?

1265
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,525
What is this?

1266
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,362
Is this an intervention?

1267
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,406
Did you come here to tell
me howl failed as a father?

1268
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,641
No!

1269
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,201
(SIGHS)

1270
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,127
Not at all. You've raised
two incredible boys, Gabe.

1271
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,004
They may not
have quick answers

1272
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,447
or awards
on their mantles.

1273
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,884
In fact, neither one
of them has a mantle.

1274
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,764
But they're incredible,

1275
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,966
with big, sensitive hearts.

1276
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,370
And right now
they need to know

1277
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,363
how much their
father loves them.

1278
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,247
Barbara used to help you with the
hard part of parenting, right?

1279
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,208
She made everyone
around her happy.

1280
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,482
She just brought out
the best in me.

1281
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,647
I think if she were here right
now she'd tell you that

1282
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,048
your boys will remember this time
for the rest of their lives.

1283
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,520
It will shape who
they are as men.

1284
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,651
You're gonna make a great
matriarch one day.

1285
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,445
I already am
a great matriarch, Gabe.

1286
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,968
At least
I'm working on it.

1287
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,640
Today, we are going to Mr. Miyagi
the shit out of this fence.

1288
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,086
Who's Mr. Miyagi?

1289
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,561
Mr. Miyagi is
an older Asian man

1290
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,324
that taught me
many life lessons.

1291
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,765
The point is I'm sick of
looking at this fence.

1292
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,320
Today we're gonna fix it.

1293
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,886
Tucker, where's
your drill?

1294
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,803
It's under my pillow.
Please go get it.

01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,966
Hop on the diving board.

1297
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,166
Okay-

1298
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,129
You are going to
recite this poem

1299
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,884
while Tucker and I
work on the fence.

1300
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,011
Then we'll switch.

1301
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,561
This is weird.

1302
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,686
Think of it as a prayer you're
not expecting anyone to answer.

1303
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,809
All right, Tuck, good. Come over here.
Put the drill down.

1304
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,928
We're gonna use it later
when we put 'em back up.

1305
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,446
Come over here
with this crowbar.

1306
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,047
And the point is to jam it in
here and then use your leverage.

Yeah?

1362

of inappropriate lately.

1363

touch you or something?

1364

No, no, no,
nothing like that.

1365
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,130

1366

Well, did you talk
to Human Resources?

You and Noah would hear
the music and light up.

1391

after him till he stopped.

first one off the ship.

1437

He's gonna die.

1438

Of course he's gonna die!

Right.

Absolutely.

1530
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,646
JERRY: You don't
drink dairy?

1531
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,404
How do you get
all your protein?

1532
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,520
WOMAN: Vegetables.

1533
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,962
JERRY: Don't take veggies. You
never had cream in your coffee?

1534
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,525
WOMAN: Depends on the cream.

1535
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,489
JERRY: Don't you like your
cake with frosting on it?

1536
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,607
WOMAN: I do.

1537
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,808
JERRY: Wouldn't you like
a milky, like, sweet,

1538
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,969
like, strawberry kind of,
you know, yogurt?

1539
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,520
Excuse me,
are you Jerry?

1540
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,364
The guy with
the talking dick?

1541
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,765
Yeah. I told you.
Who the hell are you?

1542
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,168
My name is Aidan Bloom.
I'm Sarah's husband.

1543
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,361
Oh!

1544
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,925
Oh, hey.

1545
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,242
How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

1546
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,883
I have been racking
my brain trying

1547
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,361
to figure out how to
handle this situation.

1548
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,010
Situation?

1549
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,566
If you ever so much as
exhale near my wife again,

1550
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,802
I promise to sue you
for sexual harassment.

1551
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:35,608
Stay away from my wife,
you wretched piece of shit.

1556
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,324
That did not
go as planned.

1557

Are you okay?

1558
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,045
I think you
lost, Dad.

1559
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,770
Here, put this
on your eye.

1560
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,281
(PANTING)

1561
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,689
We gotta go. Come on.

1562
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,840
Hey-

1563
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,400
Honey, oh, my God!
What happened to your eye?

1564
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,801
I ran into Jerry
at the supermarket.

1565
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,849
Oh, my God.

1566
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,246
Hey, Dad, I'm here.

1567
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:25,089
Look, I'm here.
Toasted almond.

1568
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,330
What happened
to your eye?

1569
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,966
Oh. Don't worry
about it, Dad.

1570
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,560
Don't worry about
that at all.

1571
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,483
The point is
I'm here, okay?

1572
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,684
I'm here and Sarah's here
and the kids are here.

1573
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,089
And the rabbis are here
and we all love you.

1574
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,211
I'm sorry, I don't think
Noah's gonna make it, Dad.

1575
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,850
I did everything I could.

1576
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,801
Hmm.

1577
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,244
Thank you, Aidan.

1578
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,844
For what, Dad?

1579
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:09,604
For doing your best to hold this
family together when I couldn't.

1580
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,928
How did you
get that shiner?

1581
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:22,370
I ran into someone who's been
harassing Sarah at work.

1582
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,691
So, yes.

1583
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,009
You went after him, huh?

1584
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,245
(LAUGHS)

1585
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,330
I tried.

1586
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,204
That takes guts.

1587
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,325
Good for you.

1588
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,609
You showed up.

1589
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,045
How are you feeling?

1590
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,569
I'm not afraid.

1591
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,369
Isn't that funny?

1592
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,042
I thought
I'd be afraid.

1593
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,443
I think that's the bravest
thing I've ever heard.

1594
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,723
GABE: Really?
AIDAN: Yeah, I really do.

1595
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,966
You promise?

1596
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,166
I promise you.

1597
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:30,450
Do you see that

1598
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:33,285
or is God very different
than I imagined?

1599
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,528
Noah! That's Noah,
Dad. You made it?

1600
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,046
Dad, it's Noah.
He made it.

1601
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,243
Noah, you're a warrior.

1602
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,128
No, I just won a contest.

1603
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,644
But you won.

1604
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,045
Yeah.

1605
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,764
Yeah, Dad, I won.

1606
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,568
GABE: I'm so proud of you.

1607
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,482
I'm so tired.

1608
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,684
Hold my hands.

1609
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,045
AIDAN: Right here.
Right here, Dad.

1610
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,245
We love you.

1611
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:47,804
If there's a next time,
I'll do better.

1612
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,610
So fast.

1613
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,404
Try to remember
how fast it goes.

1614
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:04,410
When we were kids, Noah and I used
to pretend that we were heroes

1615
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:10,248
with swords, the only ones
who could save the day.

1616
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,004
But perhaps we set
the bar a little bit high.

1617
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,366
Maybe we're just
the regular people.

1618
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,362
The ones who get saved.

Oh, my God!

1622
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:52,285
Dude! This is because
of you. I got that part.

1623
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,010
Oh, my God!
Yeah.

1624
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,650
They fucked you up.

1625
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,051
Yeah, no,
you were totally right.

1626
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,441
Soon as I get off the ship, there's
fucking Ractonians everywhere.

1627
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,601
I got crushed.

1629
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:02,921

what's your name?

I'm Aidan.
Hey, I'm Paul.

1631
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,641
Nice to meet you. No, thank
you again for that note.

1632
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,440
I was just talking about you in a meeting.
I didn't have your number.

1633
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,009
I work with this little
theater company in Topanga.

1634
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,088
Have you ever given
any thought to teaching?

1635
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,206
Not... No, no.

1636
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,204
Well, look, we have these
classes for college kids

1637
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,486
and we're looking
for somebody new.

1638
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,769
The pay is just okay, but
the people are amazing.

1639
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,084
You should come by
and give it a look.

Yeah.

01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,403

Would you come by?

1642
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,806
That'd be really cool.
I'd be honored.

1643
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,530
Really? You'll come?
Yeah.

1644
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,960
I'd give you my number,
but I doubt

1645
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,240
you have a phone in
your little onesie.

1646
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,721

got places I can put things.

that you take it seven times.

Don't worry. The Gilberts are in St.
Tropez all spring.

out for the semester,

anything about swimming.
