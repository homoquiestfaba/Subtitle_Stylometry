00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,952
without actually deserving them?

706
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:04,187
What's under the surface
is more important.

707
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:07,824
I take substance
over style any day.

708
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,893
Okay.
So let's make a deal.

709
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,062
I'll help you make this place
look better on the outside

710
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,564
if you help me show
people that there's more

711
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,931
to me than what they
see on the surface.

712
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:17,901
And how would I do that?

713
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,804
Train me to compete
in Fire and Ice.

714
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:23,306
(LAUGHS)
You're joking, right?

715
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,277
Will, it's all about potential.

716
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:30,313
I mean, I know that I'm not the champion
snowboarder that I thought I was,

717
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:33,083
but with some coaching
and some really hard work,

718
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,819
I think I can win a medal
that I actually deserve.

719
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:38,288
And I know this place
may look really shabby now,

720
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,891
but I think I can turn it
into something really special.

721
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:44,995
We both win.
I'm not a coach.

722
00:37:45,086 --> 00:37:46,619
Oh, come on!

723
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:49,327
I heard you with your friends.
You know your stuff.

724
00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:53,138
The last time I rode,
I tore a tendon in my knee,

725
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,006
shattered my ankle
and collapsed my lung.

726
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,807
I almost died.

727
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,777
Yeah, but you're
all better <i>now, </i> right?

728
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,612
This conversation's over.

729
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,314
I saw your video.

730
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,217
To be as good as you were,
you have to really love it.

731
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:10,387
And if you love it that much,
you can't just walk away.

732
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,859
Well, I did.
Come on, boys.

733
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,133
Uhhh!

734
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,297
So because one thing happened
one time, you're gonna

735
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,565
lock yourself up in your house
for the rest of your life?

736
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:26,102
Honestly, Will,
what are you so afraid of?

737
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:30,140
I mean, you know that fall you had
was a total freak accident, right?

738
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,908
Oh, so I'm a freak now.

739
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,110
I'm just saying that if you
were to get back out there

740
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:36,546
the chances of something like that
happening again are super-low.

741
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:40,116
Look, even if I agree to train
you, you don't have a team.

742
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:45,121
Well, what about them?

743
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,257
DINK: Check this out!
WILL: Sam and Dink?

744
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,225
Whoo-hoo!

745
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:51,261
They're your old teammates,
right? It's perfect!

746
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:54,998
Obviously we'd need to have a serious
discussion about team uniforms,

747
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,933
but I have some ideas.

748
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,936
I can't imagine you being
serious enough to compete.

749
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:03,373
You spend more time styling outfits
than working on board technique.

750
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,076
That is not fair, because
styling comes naturally to me.

751
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:08,178
And I can change.

752
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,413
So bring on
the board technique.

753
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,248
I don't know, Kayla.

754
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,017
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

755
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,019
What's up, bra?

756
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,128
BOY: Go, Skye! Whoo!

757
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,133
Whoo!
Yeah, Skye!

758
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,871
Go, Team Swift!

759
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,173
(LAUGHTER)
Yeah!

760
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:40,076
Looks like they didn't waste
much time replacing me.

761
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,245
That was a killer run, Skye.

762
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:43,913
You saw that?
Oh, yeah.

763
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,882
Wait a minute. Is that...

764
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,083
Skye Sailor.

765
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:50,920
But... she's with
pro ice in Aspen.

766
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,455
I've heard she's never lost.

767
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,462
You know, the Swifts didn't
just kick me from their team.

768
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:02,265
They also beat you, and you
haven't competed since.

769
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,201
They don't think
either of us is a threat.

770
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,305
Wouldn't it be great
to prove them wrong?

771
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,308
What is she talking about?

772
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,179
Kayla's gonna join your team,
and I'm gonna coach you.

773
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,414
Oh! Ha ha!

774
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,183
DINK: Yeah!

775
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,619
Yeah! Uh, wait, wait.

776
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,087
You mean you're
gonna coach <i>her.</i>

777
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:25,310
Right? Because, I mean,

778
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:27,023
we all know that
I don't need coaching.

779
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,325
You know? 'Cause
I'm the best <i>ever.</i>

780
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,431
(ALL CHUCKLING)

781
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,599
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

782
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,068
PIA: Let me make sure
I have this right.

783
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,105
You and Will Cloud
are forming your own team

784
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,673
to compete at Fire and Ice.

785
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:46,509
Me, Will, and these two.

786
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,679
Well, <i>hello, </i> ladies.

787
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:53,683
Ahem. Low pressure system
movin' in this afternoon.

788
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,452
What are you, a weather man?

789
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,720
I dabble.
But if you're interested,

790
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:01,157
I could show you some of the
finer points of snow formation.

791
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,359
No, thanks.

792
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,596
Just think about it.

793
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:09,232
I know. I know.

794
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,266
NICK: Yeah, cool, man.

795
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,534
Catch you later, man.

796
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,304
Be strong.

797
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,008
(GASPS) Oh no, he <i>didn't.</i>

798
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,212
Did he just
silent what-up me?!

799
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:23,480
(EXCITED CHATTER)

800
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,218
Is <i>that </i> the girl
you were talking about?

801
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,752
Skye Sailor.

802
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:32,255
She just moved here from Aspen.

803
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:35,191
Like Fire and Ice wasn't gonna
be hard enough already,

804
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:38,094
now I have to compete with her.

805
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,429
(BEEP) (BEEP) (BEEP)

806
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:42,032
You're right, linds.

807
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:46,269
She obviously doesn't know
that double studs are over.

808
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:50,607
There is no emoticon to express the
tragedy of her fashion choices.

809
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:52,475
I pity her.

810
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,150
Good form.

811
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,288
Good amplitude.

812
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,094
Crisp holds.

813
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,338
(CROWD CHEERING)

814
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,773
She's <i>good.</i>

815
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,744
Yeah, I know.

816
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,482
Thank you, everyone,
for the warm welcome.

817
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:35,084
As exhausting as it is
being a celebrity,

818
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:37,086
fans like you make it
all worthwhile.

819
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,088
(APPLAUSE) Whoo.

820
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,828
Hi. I'm Skye.

821
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,196
So I've heard.

822
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:48,831
Oh. Would you like
an autograph?

823
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,400
No. I'm fine, thanks.

824
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:53,336
Come on, don't be silly.
Anything for my fans.

825
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,405
Who should I make it out to?

826
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:58,474
Kayla.
As in Kayla Morgan.

827
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,209
Maybe you've heard of me.

828
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,712
Of course I have.

829
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,347
Hmm.

830
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,416
"To Kayla.

831
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,818
Everybody's favorite
daddy's girl."

832
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,388
Actually, why don't you
make it out to

833
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,558
"Kayla, future winner
of Fire and Ice."

834
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,694
(LAUGHS)
And how are you gonna do that

835
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:20,263
now that the competition
<i>isn't </i> rigged?

836
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,599
I don't know. How are you
gonna deal with those split ends

837
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:25,501
I could see from all the way
across the Mountain?

838
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:28,237
It's a good thing Nick's dad
replaced you with me.

839
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,306
Now team Swift has
a chance of <i>winning.</i>

840
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,710
We'll see about that.
Mm-hmm.

841
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,117
Split ends?

842
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,152
She started it.

843
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,154
You want to show Skye Sailor
what you're made of?

844
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:46,456
Stop trading insults
back and forth

845
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,424
and beat her at her own game.

846
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:50,593

if he'd ever be the same again,

929

his old smile back.

off the vertical face.

00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,546
It's intense.

939
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:12,548
Some people want to
snowboard down it,

940
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:16,052
but you can't get up there
without a helicopter.

941
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:19,055

942
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,757
Yeah. Tyson.

943
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,061

snowboarding down Tyson's peak

949

are at Fire and Ice?

00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:48,184
I'll admit,
at first it was shaky,

951
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:51,687

like a real threat out there.

953

about something

954
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:59,595
that could make our team
an even bigger threat.

955
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,998

What's that?

956

compete with us.

00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,110
That wasn't a part of our deal.

960
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:18,047

seen you out in the snow.

who loves it like you do.

963
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:25,121
You need to get back out there.

she might win?

you jumped Tyson's peak.

It's the only thing I thought
would impress you enough.

that my hands are small?

They look fairly
regular-sized to me.

Um, why don't you hold it
a bit more normal?

Okay, great.
Are you coming?

1224
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,264
I'll catch up with you.

1225
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:58,099
Okay.

1226
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,975
Gotta hand it to you, Cloud.

1227
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:08,776
Team's lookin'...Better.

1228
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:10,879
Thanks.

1229
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:12,647
Especially Kayla.

1230
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,949
She is one determined girl.

1231
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:18,887
Once she gets an idea
in her head, that's it.

1232
01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:21,789
Like learning the Cloud 9, that
was probably her idea, wasn't it?

1233
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,859
She can handle it.

1234
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:28,096
I'm not talking about her.
I'm talking about <i>you.</i>

1235
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,066
It's bad enough the Cloud 9
ended your career,

1236
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:34,135
but if Kayla doesn't pull
it off and she gets hurt,

1237
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:36,371
that'll be on you.

1238
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,048
All right, here we go.

1239
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,050
Backside 5. Take your time!

1240
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,023
Okay, crippler 7!

1241
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:56,824
Up... Top...

1242
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:58,159
Nice!

1243
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:02,263
All right, Cloud 9.

1244
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:04,032
Double cork. One...

1245
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:06,935
Two...

1246
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:10,405
Uhhh!

1247
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:12,440
Ohhh!

1248
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:14,442
Did you see that?

1249
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:17,378
That trick Kayla's working on,
what is that?

1250
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,080
That's the Cloud 9.

1251
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:21,249
She can't actually
pull that off.

1252
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:23,751
Not yet, but I wouldn't
count her out.

1253
01:10:24,513 --> 01:10:26,288
You said you could beat her.

1254
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:32,093
Yeah. And you said she was a
pampered princess with no talent.

1255
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:34,395
But you were wrong.

1256
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,397
That girl can ride.

1257
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,006
You're hesitating!

1258
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,275
I can see it in your turns!

1259
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:50,411
You know the moves,
but you're not attacking!

1260
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:54,315
Okay. So then...

1261
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:56,851
I'll go again.

1262
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:58,286
No.

1263
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,892
That's it.

1264
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,395
We're out of time.
You're just not ready.

1265
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:11,199
Are you giving up on me?

1266
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:15,169
I'm not gonna teach you this
move just to watch you get hurt.

1267
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:18,039
It's not worth it.

1268
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:20,842
What's not worth it?

1269
01:11:20,844 --> 01:11:23,845
I think we both know what this
competition is really about for you.

1270
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,179
What?!

1271
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:29,050
That little hand-holding stunt
you pulled in school?

1272
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:32,053
I think it's pretty obvious all you
care about is winning Nick back.

1273
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:33,955
That's not true.

1274
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:37,792
I mean, things are
so different now.

1275
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:45,199
They're not different enough.

1276
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:47,335
We're done.

1277
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:50,271
Yeah, we're done.

1278
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:53,308
I need to stop wasting my time
with guys who don't believe in me.

1279
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:16,230
I'm in this
one hundred percent.

1280
01:12:16,232 --> 01:12:20,168
And I don't care if Nick
or my dad...

1281
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:24,105
Or anyone else thinks that
I can't win at Fire and Ice.

1282
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:27,241
But I need you
to believe in me.

1283
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,478
I believe in you.

1284
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,301
Kayla.

1285
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,971
You don't look happy to see me.

1286
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58,506
Yeah.
Can you blame me?

1287
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:01,342
(CHUCKLES) No, I can't.

1288
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:02,610
And that's what
I want to talk to you about.

1289
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:05,346
Listen, I owe you an apology.

1290
01:13:05,348 --> 01:13:08,349
I should never have kicked
you off the Swift team.

1291
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,252
I'm man enough to admit
I made a mistake,

1292
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:14,956
and I'm just hoping
you'll give me another chance.

1293
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:18,092
'Cause I want you
competing with us tomorrow.

1294
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:20,294
What? Swift snowboarding
has a chance

1295
01:13:20,296 --> 01:13:22,463
to set the world on fire.

1296
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,565
I want you to be part of that.

1297
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:27,935
I want you wearing
a Swift jacket tomorrow.

1298
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:30,304
Are you serious?
Yes.

1299
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:33,107
But what about Will?
And our team?

1300
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:36,344
Oh, please. But let's talk
about that after Fire and Ice.

1301
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:38,646
Right now, this is about <i>you...</i>

1302
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:41,649
And whether you want to be part of a
team that's gonna put you on the map

1303
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:44,385
as the most well known
female boarder

1304
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:47,155
on the national circuit.

1305
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,124
Think about it.

1306
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:52,126
Okay?
Okay.

1307
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,229
I hope you make
the right decision.

1308
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:56,397
All right?

1309
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,451
All right,
what do you guys think?

1310
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,719

outside, Sam?

1311

help you with that.

Hi.
Hey.

1319
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,609
As of last night, Kayla
rejoined the Swift team.

1320
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:47,515
I'm sorry.

1321
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:49,550

1324

I forgot to turn in
my Swift gear.

1325
01:14:58,461 --> 01:15:00,995
I couldn't wear it anyway.

1326

So last season.

hey, Kayla.

SEBASTIAN: Kayla! You had
me worried for a moment.

1330
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,573
Sorry, but it's gonna take a whole
lot more than a new uniform

1331
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:13,741
to get rid of me.

1332
01:15:13,743 --> 01:15:15,776
Oh, they came just in time!

01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,981
<i>Next up, Kayla Morgan!</i>

1396
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:46,554
<i>Whoa, a nice one by Kayla!</i>

1397
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:47,621
Whoa!

1398
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,890
<i>Would you look at that?</i>

1399
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:51,325
<i>Into an indie!</i>

1400
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:53,594
Yeah!

1401
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,631
<i>And she rocks out a crippler!</i>

1402
01:18:57,633 --> 01:18:59,633
<i>Unbelievable!</i>
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

1403
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:02,603
<i>She is all over her style</i>
<i>and execution.</i>

1404
01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:04,472
<i>That is a huge run</i>
<i>for Kayla Morgan.</i>

1405
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:06,640
(CROWD CHEERING)

1406
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:09,810
<i>Skye Sailor of Team Swift</i>
<i>up next.</i>

1407
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:14,348
<i>Skye dropping in,</i>

1408
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,750
<i>starts out strong.</i>

1409
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,355
Whoo!

1410
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:23,758
<i>Into a cab 7,</i>

1411
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,559
<i>a very strong cab 7,</i>

1412
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:28,596
<i>for a beautiful, solid run.</i>

1413
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:32,633
<i>After the first round,</i>
<i>Kayla Morgan</i>

1414
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:35,836
<i>is giving the unbeaten</i>

1415
01:19:35,838 --> 01:19:37,004
Whoo!

1416
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:43,544
<i>Women's run two, Skye Sailor.</i>

1417
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,719
<i>Into a front 5.</i>

1418
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,624
<i>To a back 5.</i>

1419
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,461
<i>Oh!</i>

1420
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,563
<i>A beautiful front 7!</i>

1421
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:04,298
<i>Can she stick it?</i>
<i>Yes, she does!</i>

1422
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,499
Man.

1423
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,470
Look at the scores!

1424
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,541
Yeah!

1425
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:17,611
Oh, wow!

1426
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:20,514
Skye Sailor with a killer run!

1427
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:22,683
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

1428
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:24,652
Yeah. Come on, girl.

1429
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:27,588
Beat that.

1430
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:31,725
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE CONTINUING)

1431
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,365
I'm gonna go find Kayla.
Okay.

1432
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:41,702
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a
heroic effort from Kayla Morgan,

1433
01:20:42,445 --> 01:20:43,619
our final competitor.

1434
01:20:43,936 --> 01:20:45,741
But it's gonna take an
impossibly perfect performance

1435
01:20:45,742 --> 01:20:49,443
for her to beat Skye Sailor
for the women's title.

1436
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:51,712
Kayla.
Dad?

1437
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:55,082
I owe you an apology.

1438
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:57,718
When I saw you
up there tonight...

1439
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,389
I realized how much
I'd underestimated you.

1440
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,828
I'm sorry for that.
It's just...

1441
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:10,464
Ohh.

1442
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:13,033
You've always been
my little girl...

1443
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:16,737
But tonight I've realized

1444
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:18,606
you've really grown up.

1445
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,010
I couldn't be
more proud of you.

1446
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:28,048
Hey. <i>Hey.</i>

1447
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,885
Come here, hurry up.
Check this out.

1448
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:32,620
You see that?

1449
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:34,922
Huh? All that
sappy fatherly pride

1450
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:36,657
is gonna take the edge off her

1451
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:40,094
right before she drops in.
That's gonna help us.

1452
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,930
How's a father supporting
his daughter a bad thing?

1453
01:21:42,932 --> 01:21:44,632
Oh, come on!

1454
01:21:45,876 --> 01:21:46,881
What?
(SCOFFS)

1455
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:49,931
You know I don't see any point
in excessive praise, all right?

1456
01:21:50,113 --> 01:21:52,240
How about <i>any </i> praise?

1457
01:21:52,613 --> 01:21:54,212
Anything?

1458
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,144
You know, dad,
believe it or not,

1459
01:21:57,146 --> 01:21:59,146
there are some parents that
are proud of their kids

1460
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:00,848
just for who they are,

1461
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:04,652
without making them win
medals or cheat to get ahead.

1462
01:22:04,654 --> 01:22:08,789
Hey. Be careful what you're
doing right now, okay?

1463
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:14,028
Here's an idea.

1464
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:16,096
How about we tell Kayla
what <i>really </i> happened

1465
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,631
with her and Will's sled?

1466
01:22:17,633 --> 01:22:21,535
Hey. This is not the time
or the place for this,

1467
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:23,671
okay?

1468
01:22:23,673 --> 01:22:25,172
Nick.

1469
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:30,044
I steered Kayla into that sign

1470
01:22:30,046 --> 01:22:32,146
so my dad had a reason
to kick her off the team.

1471
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:33,580
What?!

1472
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:35,549
I was just following orders.

1473
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:37,618
Yeah. Like always.

1474
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,554
So tell me, dad,
you proud of me now?

1475
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:48,162
Everything I've
always done for you,

1476
01:22:48,164 --> 01:22:51,598
I mean everything, has been to
help you achieve your dream.

1477
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:55,736
It's not my dream.

1478
01:22:57,839 --> 01:22:59,673
It's yours.

1479
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:10,884
I'm sorry, Kayla.

1480
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:29,737
You're going for it,
aren't you?

1481
01:23:29,739 --> 01:23:31,505
Nothing's impossible.

1482
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:37,745
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

1483
01:23:37,747 --> 01:23:40,914
I can't imagine the pressure
Kayla must be feeling.

1484
01:23:40,916 --> 01:23:43,217
Not only is the women's
title in play,

1485
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:45,686
but also overall team victory.

1486
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,254
With the Swifts leading,

1487
01:23:47,256 --> 01:23:49,757
Kayla Morgan would need
to do something spectacular

1488
01:23:49,759 --> 01:23:51,725
to win both the women's event

1489
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:53,627
and give her team glory

1490
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:55,629
over Sebastian Swift's club.

1491
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:57,865
Come on, Kayla.
No fear.

1492
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:01,001
No fear.

1493
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:05,739
Ladies and gentlemen,
our final competitor,

1494
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:07,307

For the first time ever,

1507
01:25:13,976 --> 01:25:17,711
someone has finally
landed the Cloud 9!

1508
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:20,981
Can you say unbelievable?

1509
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,754
