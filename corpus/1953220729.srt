00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,575
On October 13, 2008, Filmkameratene
AS received an anonymous package

2
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:16,208
with two hard disks containing
283 minutes of filmed material.

3
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,186
This film is a rough-cut version
of that material.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,688
Everything is shown
in chronological order

5
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,554
and no images
have been manipulated.

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,585
A team of investigators spent
more than a year trying to establish

7
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,291
whether this was a practical joke
or if the material was authentic.

8
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,292
They concluded that it was authentic.

9
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:41,100
Ready?
Turn on the radio.

10
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,338
- Johanna, do you have sound?
- Yes.

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,846
This isn't working.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,441
<i>Bear tracks were found yesterday</i>
<i>in Volda.</i>

13
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:54,716
<i>A hunting party arrived there today.</i>

14
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:59,192
<i>The leader of the hunting party</i>
<i>had the following to say:</i>

15
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,718
<i>We expect to locate this bear</i>
<i>fairly quickly.</i>

16
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:07,826
<i>Our real concern is that</i>
<i>a poacher has been following us.</i>

17
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:17,075
<i>Only a select few</i>
<i>ever get bear-hunting licenses.</i>

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,878
I know every single bear hunter
in Norway.

19
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,978
That guy in the Land Rover
is no bear hunter.

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,582
If he's gunning for our bear,
he's breaking the law.

21
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,857
- Have you ever seen him?
- We see him all over.

22
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,059
If I see him again,
there'll be consequences.

23
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,535
He's nothing but a poacher.

24
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:48,166
- What would you like to tell him?
- To lay his cards on the table.

25
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,735
Drive!

26
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,442
- There's too much traffic.
- We're going to lose him!

27
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,072
Ready?

28
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:33,451
We know his name is Hans,
but we have no last name.

29
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,819
Thomas, try being more serious.

30
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,417
But what is he doing in Volda?
Who is he?

31
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,453
- Do we have sound?
- You haven't plugged in the...

32
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,725
You won't get an interview
with a poacher.

33
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,173
I don't like it when you ridicule him.

34
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,802
That's great!
Thank you. Bye.

35
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:07,249
Thomas, that poacher
is staying at the campground!

36
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,757
I can't say I know him,
but he is here.

37
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:21,666
He's staying right over here.
Want me to show you?

38
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:26,469
I don't know what that smell is,
but his camper sure reeks!

39
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:33,037
- What are all those things?
- I have no idea.

40
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,106
Thyme?

41
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:44,113
He drives off and stays out all night.
He's never back before sunrise.

42
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:48,389
- He stays out all night?
- Yes. Every night.

43
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,469
- In good spirits?
- Sure.

44
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,405
We don't know
when or if he'll show up.

45
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:06,809
- There he is!
- I'm filming. Just ask him directly.

46
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,884
Hi. My name's Thomas.
We're from Volda College.

47
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,693
Could we ask you a few questions?

48
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,897
Get lost.

49
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,536
Maybe we could come back...

50
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:05,628
- Did it work?
- Quiet, I hear something.

51
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,039
<i>Yes, I'm on my way out now.</i>

52
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:14,377
<i>I expect to find it tonight.</i>
<i>Okay, fine. Bye.</i>

53
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:31,122
- He isn't here.
- He was right in front of us!

54
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,632
Sure, but...

55
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,568
- Shit!
- Nice work, Thomas.

56
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,180
- Can you see anything?
- Yeah.

57
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,024
Some furry things
are hanging down from the ceiling.

58
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,594
And there's a shotgun.

59
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:10,126
We're on our way
to where a bear was just found shot.

60
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,264
Could he have been the shooter?

61
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,337
Lord knows where this one came from.

62
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,316
I've checked with every
registered bear hunter I know.

63
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,683
None of them shot this one.

64
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,622
The bear population
is managed by the state.

65
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:35,185
So a downed bear like this one
causes quite a fuss.

66
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,957
Look at this.

67
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:43,402
These tracks don't match
the way a bear normally walks.

68
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:49,467
I think someone brought this bear
and dumped it here.

69
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,706
- That's weird.
- I agree. Very weird.

70
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,739
You're from the Wildlife Board.
Finn Haugan, right?

71
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:01,652
These hunters say
those aren't bear tracks.

72
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:05,089
That's ridiculous.
What else would they be?

73
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:09,186
There is a bear right there,
with tracks all around it.

74
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:14,462
- But why are they in doubt?
- Ask them! It's crazy.

75
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:22,271
We have waited for Hans for hours,
but now he's finally moving.

76
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:28,441
We think he's heading somewhere,
and we are going to follow him.

77
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,549
Go!

78
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,962
It looks like
he's heading for the ferry.

79
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:49,298
How long are we going to
keep following him?

80
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,331
Can you see what he's carrying?

81
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,128
It's a car tire.

82
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,471
- What's he doing?
- I can't tell.

83
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:45,085
Three, two, one, and...

84
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,457
Sogn og Fjordane county!

85
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,297
Okay, he's over there.

86
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,500
Just hide here.

87
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,862
We met a little while back.

88
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,729
- Really?
- Thomas, from Volda College.

89
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,605
- Is that...
- Are you following me?

90
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:14,011
We just want to ask you
a couple of questions.

91
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,912
No.

92
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,080
Are you...

93
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,784
What were you doing in Volda?

94
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,055
Did you shoot that bear?

95
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,127
Stay the hell away from me.

96
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,693
Turn that off.
Leave me alone!

97
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:41,230
Once we get what we need,
we can go back.

98
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:45,870
It would be so awesome
to get him to talk.

99
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:49,404
We have tried, plenty of times.

100
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:54,477
Do you think Michael Moore gave up
after the first try?

101
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:58,924
Left arm or right foot?
The one you kick with?

102
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,902
We have been here all afternoon.

103
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:23,143
I think he's sleeping in his trailer.

104
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:27,745
So now we wait
until something happens.

105
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,582
Are you serious?
Okay.

106
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,932
I have to get my sound gear.

107
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,645
What is this?

108
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,182
"No trespassing. Blasting area."

109
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,898
Did you see that?
Was that a road?

110
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,336
Did you?

111
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,500
This road is horrible.

112
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:42,457
If we run into a bunch of inbred
pig farmers, your ass is first...

113
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:47,490
- I'm not...
- Stop whining.

114
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:52,493
- I'm just being honest.
- Want to go back?

115
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,598
- Fine by me.
- That's not what I meant.

116
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,543
Hey, wait for me!

117
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,911
Look here.

118
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,618
I don't think he's in his car.

119
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,267
- So we know he's here...
- But what is he up to?

120
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,467
Here's a trail.

121
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,670
- I hear something in the distance.
- What?

122
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,275
Troll!!!

123
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,057
Thomas!

124
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,300
Hurry!
My car is right over here!

125
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,781
- What?
- Something bit me!

126
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,421
- Are you all right?
- It stings.

127
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:38,928
- You heard him yell "troll," right?
- Shut up.

128
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,704
You need some more.

129
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,615
- Can I help?
- There's gauze in the first-aid kit.

130
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:56,111
- Ow! Don't...
- We have to get this out.

131
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,885
You look like hell, Thomas.

132
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,450
- What the hell was that?
- Tetanus shot.

133
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:09,760
You yelled something
back there in the woods.

134
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,135
- You heard him, Johanna.
- What's this slime?

135
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,901
What did he say?

136
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,606
- More?
- Yes.

137
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,607
Can you give us a ride to our car?

138
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,107
It isn't very smart to follow me.

139
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,123
Did you yell "troll" out there?

140
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:49,905
- Is that your car?
- What the hell?

141
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:55,344
- What happened?
- That's our car!

142
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,906
Someone crushed our car.

143
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,120
It's completely demolished.

144
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,253
Look at this, Thomas.

145
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:11,327
- Hans, do you understand this?
- I have an idea.

146
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:15,095
Okay, what...
A bear didn't do this.

147
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,137
What do you think happened?

148
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,597
- What...
- Ask him if a troll did it.

149
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:27,477
Hey, if you know what happened
to my car, you should say so!

150
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,540
- You yelled "troll".
- Forget about that!

151
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,212
What the hell do you want?

152
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,180
You want me to say trolls exist,
on film?

153
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,888
- You find that funny?
- No, but you don't actually believe...

154
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,200
If you want a ride,
you'd better come right now.

155
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,006
- What should we do?
- I think I'll walk.

156
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,078
You have our bags?

157
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:08,919
Just so we get this straight:
you actually believe trolls exist?

158
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:14,383
Why are you so sure it was
a bear that attacked you?

159
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,566
What's the matter?

160
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,369
Why are we stopping?

161
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,584
Thanks for giving us a ride.

162
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,463
We'd love to join you,
and film what you do.

163
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,330
We'd be very interested.

164
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:07,279
I'll let you film me killing whatever
scratched you, on one condition:

165
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:12,410
You do exactly as I say,
no matter what I say. Okay?

166
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,646
Yes.

167
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,423
I feel like I'm bleeding everywhere.

168
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,797
- Are you admiring your wound?
- Yuck! Don't film that!

169
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,171
- You're crazy.
- I'm serious.

170
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,974
- Why call them?
- To tell them where we are.

171
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,243
He isn't dangerous, just weird.

172
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:49,152
Remember, he runs the show.
We do exactly as he says.

173
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,156
Then we'll get our footage.

174
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:04,025
No one here believes in God or Jesus?

175
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,505
Nope.
None of us.

176
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,498
Don't look at me.

177
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,469
Serious? Because they can smell
"the blood of a Christian man"?

178
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,356
Is that alright?

179
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,201
Close the gate and hang up that sign.

180
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,896
<i>NO TRESPASSING.</i>
<i>BLASTING AREA.</i>

181
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:49,709
- Is this a land mine?
- Yes. But it isn't armed.

182
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,741
I'm sitting on a land mine?
Are you nuts?

183
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,211
Anyone who doesn't want to join me?

184
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,249
Who's changed their mind?
Who's afraid of trolls?

185
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,160
- No.
- No? Good.

186
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:13,935
Go down to that creek, take off all
your clothes, and scrub yourselves.

187
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:17,272
- Especially your armpits and groin.
- No way!

188
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,439
- Why?
- To remove any body odor.

189
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,077
Then rub this all over yourselves
and your clothes.

190
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,849
- What is that?
- Troll stench.

191
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:36,226
- Rub it all over your bodies.
- It reeks! No way. Forget about it.

192
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:40,926
You have to smell like a troll,
or they'll smell us and run away.

193
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,036
Christ!

194
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:51,667
- No. No way!
- I'm not doing this, Thomas.

195
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,442
Forget about it!

196
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,815
You agreed to do exactly as I said.

197
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:04,414
If you don't do it, I'll go up there
alone and leave you here.

198
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,150
Is that understood?

199
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:14,164
Are you ready?
You're all greased up?

200
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,430
You look cute.

201
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:21,805
Here, flashlights for you.

202
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:26,505
- What is that?
- A big flash bulb, basically.

203
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:50,528
Hans? That weapon.
How do you use it?

204
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:55,773
It blasts a powerful ultraviolet beam.

205
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:59,676
UVB rays. The same as the sun,
or a tanning lamp.

206
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,048
Don't you know
sunlight turns them to stone, Thomas?

207
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:09,544
- Right. Or they explode.
- Haven't you read anything?

208
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:17,120
I read fairy tales when I was a kid,
but... Did you know that, Kalle?

209
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:21,030
So, what do you do if a troll wants
to have an eating contest with you?

210
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,305
Eating contest?

211
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,967
Fairy tales usually
don't match reality.

212
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,536
They seem to in this case.

213
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,583
- Troll piss.
- Christ!

214
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,898
You can smell it
all the way over here.

215
00:23:54,934 --> 00:24:00,167
Listen, I'm hunting a Ringlefinch.
There's piss everywhere.

216
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:04,835
He's marking. Looks like he's
been chased from his territory.

217
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:09,541
He seems sick. I'd like to find out
what's wrong with him.

218
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,709
A blood sample from the troll?

219
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:17,246
I don't have the right equipment.

220
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,723
You too.
Bye.

221
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,889
I need help to find out what's wrong.

222
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,296
But a blood sample...

223
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,061
That won't be easy.

224
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:35,063
Who were you talking to?

225
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,439
A veterinarian.

226
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,745
A vet!

227
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,176
If you wait here,
I'll try to chase the troll out.

228
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,595
Is this what you imagined?

229
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,767
I bet it's going to take him some
time to find a troll out there.

230
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,336
I feel sorry for him
if he really believes in trolls.

231
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,506
Maybe he's filming us.

232
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,688
- That's probably what he's doing.
- He's somewhere laughing at us.

233
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,781
While we sit here like idiots.

234
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,887
Lingonberry?

235
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:10,265
- In the woods?
- Yes, with no food or water.

236
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,830
- Cool!
- What?

237
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,841
It's a night-vision camera.

238
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,811
Listen!

239
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,315
That's just him.

240
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:30,481
One week,
or being bitten by a bear.

241
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:35,824
- It makes for a good story.
- You would look ridiculous!

242
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:40,924
- So I think I'll choose that.
- Being bitten by a bear?

243
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,870
Do you feel that?

244
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,052
I'm picking up some strange sounds.

245
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,295
What is that?

246
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,597
Seriously.
What's going on?

247
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,238
What is this?

248
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,236
This is one real bad joke.

249
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,505
It's a Tosserlad!
Get the hell out of here!

250
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,978
Run, dammit!

251
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:54,813
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

252
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,311
Where did it go?
Do you see it?

253
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,915
Get behind my car!

254
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,926
No!

255
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,930
- Give me the camera!
- No!

256
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,466
Where is Johanna?

257
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,746
Thomas!
Kalle!

258
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,218
- Johanna!
- It's real!

259
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,694
I told you so!
I knew it!

260
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,260
They are real!

261
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:31,504
- Say something.
- It's been turned to stone!

262
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:35,502
We ran through the woods...

263
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:38,243
Why the hell did you say
that none of you were Christian?

264
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:45,248
The way that troll sniffed around...
Obviously one of you believes in God.

265
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,659
I don't believe in God.
I sang in a church teen choir...

266
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,754
But that's because
my parents forced me to.

267
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:58,800
I don't believe in God.
I'm serious.

268
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:02,204
- I can tell it's not her.
- What? How?

269
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,270
Knock it off. That was some
genetically-engineered monster.

270
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,941
- That's a troll.
- Nonsense!

271
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:15,817
Question! Why doesn't anybody
know about this?

272
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:20,223
Because someone
doesn't want people to know.

273
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,852
The government?

274
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:29,163
Is the government behind this?
Do you work for them?

275
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,661
- Why show it to us now?
- Because I'm tired of this shitty job.

276
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:39,837
I have no rights whatsoever.
I get no night bonus.

277
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,745
No overtime.
No nuisance compensation.

278
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:47,309
Maybe it's time for a change
in troll management.

279
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:51,812
- So if you could get this on TV...
- That shouldn't be a problem.

280
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,023
Come on.

281
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:05,333
You want to see more of these,
learn what's really going on?

282
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:10,238
You might want to step back.

283
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,344
Holy shit!

284
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,635
Anyone need some gravel?

285
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,343
Who the hell is that?

286
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,045
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

287
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,193
Hi there.

288
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,392
It's that guy we filmed...

289
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,270
What is this, Hans?
A film crew?

290
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,796
They wanted to see some trolls.

291
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,607
Aren't you that guy
from the Wildlife Board?

292
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:24,638
This is an exceptionally bad idea.

293
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,950
Turn off that camera.
I have enough problems.

294
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:33,480
The valley is full of dead cattle.

295
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:39,020
I can't talk about this on film.
Turn off that camera.

296
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:43,467
- Put it down.
- We're allowed to film here.

297
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,163
- Sure you're on top of this?
- Totally.

298
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,698
As soon as the scapegoat arrives,
I will take care of the rest.

299
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:05,621
<i>PIO TER'S POLISH PAINT SERVICE</i>

300
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:10,617
The Ringlefinch is still out there.

301
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,850
Then find it!

302
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:23,795
Two German tourists
disappeared last night.

303
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:28,033
- We expect to lose a few more.
- That isn't my problem.

304
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,444
If you think I'll let you keep
those recordings, you're wrong!

305
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:08,635
It says "Pioter's Polish Paint Service".

306
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:20,117
What exactly is your job description?

307
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:26,654
My job is to kill any troll
that breaks out of its territory

308
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,964
- and comes near people.
- How often do they break out?

309
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:38,636
Rarely. This is a special situation.
Too many trolls are out and about.

310
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,942
Finn is a... bureaucrat.

311
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:49,477
He works for TSS.
His primary job is to prevent...

312
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:55,354
To keep people from knowing
that trolls exist.

313
00:39:55,393 --> 00:40:01,195
In one sense,
you are a true Norwegian hero.

314
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,292
No, you're wrong about that.

315
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:08,499
There's nothing heroic
about what I do. It's dirty work.

316
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,516
How can no one know about this?

317
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:25,921
Let's take these recordings, drive
to Oslo, and sell them for a fortune.

318
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:30,826
We can't do that yet.
We have to keep following him.

319
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,361
Finn is pissed off.

320
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:40,371
- Now what?
- Breakfast.

321
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:48,535
- You should eat something too.
- I'm not hungry.

322
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,047
I feel a little... nauseous.

323
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,049
How many types of troll are there?

324
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:06,291
You have two main groups:
mountain trolls and woodland trolls.

325
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:10,927
The subgroups include Ringlefinch,
Tosserlad, Rimetosser.

326
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,937
Mountain Kings.

327
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,702
The Harding, out west.

328
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:22,043
But that troll we saw...
Do they all have three heads?

329
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,572
No, there are many variations.

330
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:31,555
The heads develop as they age.
They aren't born with three.

331
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:36,117
They are usually born with one.
The others appear later.

332
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,995
They only have an eye
in the middle, the original, head.

333
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:46,971
The other heads aren't really heads.
They're a sort of protuberance.

334
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:52,102
Their function
is to scare other trolls.

335
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,611
Or impress the females.

336
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,649
What is that form?

337
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:06,589
- What does TSS stand for?
- Troll Security Service.

338
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,752
We have to fill out this form
after each kill.

339
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:14,754
Location, gender, whether it blew up
or turned to stone...

340
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:19,463
<i>SLAYED TROLL FORM</i>

341
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:27,675
In fairy tales, trolls wear clothes
and talk like people.

342
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,207
- They're just like people.
- Fairy tales are for kids.

343
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,049
Trolls are animals.
Predators.

344
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:40,023
They eat, shit and mate.
Eat anything they can.

345
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:45,394
- How old can trolls get?
- 1000, 1200 years.

346
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:51,801
- And their intelligence level?
- In the pits. They are not bright.

347
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:57,001
They manage to eat. But how hard
is it to survive on rocks?

348
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,204
I once saw a troll
try to eat its own tail.

349
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:06,149
His head between his legs,
he tried to suck down his own tail.

350
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:13,249
He started gagging on it, tipped over
and rolled down a hill like a wheel.

351
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:19,423
- I was a Navy Ranger.
- And that led you to troll hunting?

352
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:23,662
No, they were looking
for someone who could...

353
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:29,596
- So you're the only one in Norway?
- Yes.

354
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,104
Are we leaving?

355
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:46,289
- They eat all sorts of crap.
- Do they eat people?

356
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:51,421
- You want to offer yourself?
- No. But have they eaten people?

357
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:13,812
- Are those troll tails?
- Yes. Some skinned, some whole.

358
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,947
- Why?
- So it smells like troll in here.

359
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,958
Why do you want a troll smell?

360
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:26,225
So I can approach the trolls
without them noticing.

361
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,999
- Tanning lamps?
- Yes.

362
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:35,233
- You can get skin cancer.
- I use sunscreen.

363
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:41,738
I have trouble sleeping in the dark.

364
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:49,513
- Is that what we rubbed on ourselves?
- Yes.

365
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:53,149
- What is it?
- Concentrated troll stench.

366
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,659
A mixture of all the crap
you can squeeze out of a troll.

367
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,795
Let's go find that Ringlefinch before
he eats every animal in the county.

368
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:30,389
<i>Two German tourists were found</i>
<i>killed by a bear.</i>

369
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:36,697
<i>Finn Haugan from the Wildlife Board</i>
<i>is investigating the tragedy.</i>

370
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,572
Do you know where the troll might be?

371
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:48,306
No.

372
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:02,288
What are you looking for?

373
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:06,388
Rock slides, toppled trees,
things like that.

374
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,164
See anything?

375
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,376
- Do I look like that famous painting?
- Yeah.

376
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:30,353
Maybe you should see a doctor?

377
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:34,290
- Do you really feel sick?
- It comes and goes.

378
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:42,694
- Are we safe here?
- They only come out at night.

379
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,797
Kalle, can't we...

380
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,116
It hasn't been triggered.
Some small trolls have taken the bait.

381
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:17,496
Concrete and charcoal
is an unbeatable combination.

382
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,597
- Do it now!
- Now?

383
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:56,538
Hans thinks he has found
the trail of a Ringlefinch...

384
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:59,634
Hans thinks he has found tracks.

385
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:04,307
Some farmers have found
sheep carcasses nearby.

386
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:08,614
Hans thinks
there's a link between the two.

387
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,176
Hurry up!

388
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:15,318
<i>Global warming</i>
<i>has led to changes...</i>

389
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,386
<i>... in our flora and fauna.</i>

390
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,864
These tracks you see around here...

391
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:30,363
are from a Russian bear that came
through Finland and Sweden.

392
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:46,189
The bear stores its food
here under the bridge.

393
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:50,182
- Isn't that strange behavior?
- Not for Russian bears.

394
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:56,826
Due to the long, hard winters, they
store their food. Just like squirrels.

395
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,204
Aren't these tracks a little strange?

396
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:09,608
That's the left foot.
And the right foot is over here.

397
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:15,074
Has the bear walked cross-legged?

398
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,782
I assume you have seen
bear tracks before.

399
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,951
Hey, what about those tracks?

400
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,733
He's gnawed at the bark.
Typical Ringlefinch behavior.

401
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:42,142
He'll be back tonight.
I have something to lure him with.

402
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,739
- And then you'll kill him?
- Yes.

403
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:47,114
But first,
I need to get that blood sample.

404
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:55,657
Is this the syringe?

405
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:04,757
This is horrible!
It's cruelty to animals.

406
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:07,999
Cruelty?
He's just using them as bait.

407
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,975
You're too far away.
Move closer.

408
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,914
No, I'll just zoom.
We can see fine from here.

409
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,654
What working hours...

410
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:37,690
We've been here forever.
Maybe no troll will show up?

411
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:43,674
- We can see fine from here.
- But we can see better from there!

412
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,538
Come on.

413
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:28,344
It's here.

414
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:41,224
Hear that?

415
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,544
Run!

416
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:17,200
God, I hate this crap!

417
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,634
Keep your distance. I'm about to
toss out some Christian man's blood.

418
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,072
Move back!

419
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,812
Shit!
Kalle! Thomas!

420
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:23,698
Move!
Move over!

421
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:29,192
Are you alright?
Hey...

422
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:31,963
Are you alright?

423
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,438
Help him up.

424
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:39,909
- Come on, Hans.
- Are you alright?

425
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:50,883
Careful with that red button.

426
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,957
Give me the syringe.

427
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:21,407
Stay up there.

428
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,111
Now we know
that trolls also explode.

429
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:55,750
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thanks.

430
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,982
Could've been worse.

431
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,788
Just a little sore.

432
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,522
A little sore?

433
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,996
This is crazy!

434
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:13,102
At least I got the blood sample.

435
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:17,869
I'll be there in a half hour.
Thanks. Bye.

436
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,879
You look like a newborn!

437
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:40,995
It's just a film team.
They have some questions.

438
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,967
<i>ARDAL PET CLINIC</i>

439
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,633
- Is that the blood?
- Yes.

440
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:55,134
- It was quite a struggle.
- I can tell.

441
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:00,808
You're a mess!

442
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:04,014
- Thanks.
- There's a bathroom in there.

443
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:16,464
- What do you see?
- There aren't enough red blood cells.

444
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:20,436
This will take me a couple of days.

445
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,031
Could we have a short interview?

446
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:28,943
If you could just stand...
or maybe sit over there.

447
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,008
- What should I tell them?
- Everything.

448
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:37,714
- We aren't allowed.
- I take full responsibility.

449
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:44,250
The trolls' main problem
is that they can't convert vitamin D

450
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,287
from the sunlight, into calcium.

451
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:54,202
So when they are exposed to bright
sunlight, their bodies overreact.

452
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,933
Their stomachs expand.

453
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:04,107
Gases are forced into their intestines
and veins. This becomes unbearable.

454
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:07,982
- And they explode?
- They explode.

455
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:13,456
- But some trolls turn to stone.
- Yes, the older ones.

456
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:19,918
Their veins are too constricted, so
the expansion occurs in their bones.

457
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:25,993
In a matter of seconds, everything
calcifies and they turn to stone.

458
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:30,996
I wish they didn't
have to experience such pain.

459
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:38,573
It is traumatic for them, even though
it only takes a few seconds.

460
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:43,107
We would have preferred
to give them an injection.

461
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:49,353
- I'll have the results in a few days.
- And you'll call me?

462
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,161
- Bye.
- Bye.

463
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,497
- Ready to go?
- Sure.

464
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:46,314
- Why all these local newspapers?
- To collect information.

465
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:51,718
- About what?
- Trolls.

466
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:58,354
Accidents and things that have
happened, that trolls are behind.

467
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:03,059
- I have files back there.
- Can I take a look?

468
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:09,895
- "Road disappeared."
- People want natural explanations.

469
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:17,437
But if you know what to look for,
you'll see what's caused by trolls.

470
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:25,081
This bridge was smashed by
a wading troll that bumped his head.

471
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:30,417
Are there trolls that big?

472
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:35,898
Yes, the Jotnar.
I'm the only person to have seen one.

473
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:43,271
There's a mountain troll territory
on the Finnmark plateau.

474
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:47,606
And one on the Hardanger plateau.

475
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:51,580
Three in Jotunheimen, one in Dovre.

476
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:58,783
We have to find out where the
problem lies. Jotunheimen is closest.

477
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:22,676
We are on our way to the first
territory Hans wants to check.

478
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:28,241
At the moment,
we are circling around the territory.

479
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:46,433
The territory ends up here,
and because this tire is intact...

480
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:51,463
Hans says
no trolls have left this territory.

481
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:55,968
If they had left,
they would have gnawed on this tire.

482
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,547
Smile!

483
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,360
Film over there.

484
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:16,526
Trolls love to gnaw on old car tires.

485
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:22,129
One has tried to kick his way
into the good stuff here, but failed.

486
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:37,913
- How many trolls are there?
- Impossible to say.

487
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,184
You must have some idea?

488
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:47,095
The gestation period is 10 to 15 years.
And they only have one kid.

489
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,361
- Are they mammals?
- Yes.

490
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,234
Let's see...

491
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:05,578
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

492
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,414
This looks fine. All the stones
are in the same position.

493
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:21,227
This is apparently a battle area.

494
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:27,260
Mountain trolls and woodland trolls
often come to blows here.

495
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,273
They throw stones at each other.

496
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:33,936
But there has been little
activity here lately.

497
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:47,654
The guy behind us is paying.
Isn't that what they say?

498
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:55,564
Remember that big Jotnar?
They live here in Jotunheimen.

499
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:59,261
- Where?
- Inside the mountains.

500
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,155
- What are we doing?
- Just wait here.

501
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,250
I ate an entire loaf of bread.

502
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:29,955
Finn refuses to give in.

503
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,164
He claims all the runaways
are from Dovre.

504
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:38,766
Because he doesn't see any
in this satellite photo.

505
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,709
But you can't see trolls
in satellite photos!

506
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,477
Let's get to the bottom of this.

507
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:55,724
We are on our way to a farm
that was on the local news recently.

508
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:59,456
Hans thinks it's troll related.

509
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:02,226
Wow, look at that!

510
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:07,129
Did you get that?

511
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:17,077
- What happened here?
- A tornado.

512
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:20,412
- Did you see it happen?
- No.

513
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:24,648
Look at the position of those trees.

514
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:29,249
They should all point
in the same direction.

515
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:32,386
Who showed you that map?

516
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:36,092
They didn't say who they were.

517
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:41,069
But they had fancy weather charts
and satellite images.

518
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:44,562
And we saw what
looked like a tornado.

519
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:49,704
At least three trolls ran though here
and continued northward.

520
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:57,175
How can it be that no one sees huge
beasts rampage across a field like this?

521
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:02,554
We'll come back tonight.
Head into the woods.

522
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,535
I'm tired.

523
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:41,428
- I don't like this.
- Let's stick together.

524
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,830
Seriously, Kalle.

525
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:47,659
We have to follow him.

526
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:51,401
What do you think we should do?

527
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:14,119
There are tracks further in.

528
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:23,134
Here's their trail.
They've passed through here.

529
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:30,635
- We can't stay here alone.
- This way!

530
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,562
An abandoned mine.

531
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:54,665
- They've been here.
- I'm not going in there!

532
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,899
There aren't any trolls there now.

533
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:01,176
Come on.

534
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,976
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

535
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,680
No, there's nobody home.

536
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,355
I need the troll stench.

537
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,054
- Here.
- I can take the camera.

538
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,103
Everything okay?

539
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:56,352
A whole pack of trolls lives here.
This is a lair.

540
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:12,972
- We can leave.
- Come on, let's get out of here!

541
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,510
Let's go.

542
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,453
Come on!

543
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:30,288
I'm coming!

544
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,875
Closer to the wall!

545
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,764
Head back inside!

546
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:42,788
Quick, in here!

547
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:48,969
Turn off your flashlights!

548
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,790
I have to get out of here.

549
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:58,898
- Do you have any more troll stench?
- No, not here.

550
01:14:00,303 --> 01:14:03,761
Just relax.
Breathe easy.

551
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,972
Calm down.

552
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:11,708
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm Christian!

553
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:15,205
- We're going to die!
- Damn!

554
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,685
You'd better not start sweating!

555
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:30,221
Dear Lord...

556
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:32,564
Shut up!

557
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,131
Run!

558
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,637
Sunlight!

559
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,492
It still works.

560
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:37,999
There are more in there.
I'll have to get them later.

561
01:15:40,236 --> 01:15:42,261
Mountain Kings.

562
01:15:52,982 --> 01:15:55,212
Why didn't he just say
he was Christian?

563
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:18,662
I have to go to Dovre to find out
why they keep running away.

564
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:22,837
I can give you a ride down,
if you want to quit.

565
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:40,761
- What are you doing?
- Looking for those tapes.

566
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:43,321
In my trailer?

567
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,060
- Are you filming?
- No.

568
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:48,332
- It's out of control.
- Why aren't you up there?

569
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:52,864
I refuse to go into their territory.
There's no way.

570
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:56,173
- Turn off that camera.
- It's off.

571
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:59,545
But don't people have a right to know?

572
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:03,746
- What is your job?
- That's confidential information.

573
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:10,719
Why don't we have a right to know?
People are dying!

574
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:15,029
Why is this so secret?

575
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:21,596
- People have a right to know.
- No.

576
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:25,471
- Hands off the camera.
- This is none of your business.

577
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:27,976
Yes, this happens to be my business!

578
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,577
- Get lost!
- This isn't over.

579
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:38,383
I'm going to check it out.
Do you want to join me?

580
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:42,151
- Yes.
- Are you ready for that?

581
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:46,253
- Yes.
- Okay, let's keep on filming.

582
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:49,891
Let's find a new camera and continue.

583
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:54,301
Here comes our new camerawoman.
Malica.

584
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,341
- Malica.
- Thomas.

585
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:05,347
You are not Christian.

586
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:10,910
- You don't believe in Jesus or God?
- I'm a Muslim.

587
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:13,183
Excellent.

588
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:17,257
Muslim is okay, right?

589
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:21,821
I honestly don't know.
We'll see what happens.

590
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:27,860
- It must be okay.
- We're filming musk oxen, right?

591
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:30,838
No, not exactly.

592
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,709
- Let's go.
- Yes, we might as well.

593
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:39,441
We'll explain on the way.

594
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:51,525
- Where have you worked?
- Norwegian TV, BBC...

595
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,826
- I just filmed some lions in Tanzania.
- Lions. Good.

596
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:32,362
I've never seen anything like this.

597
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:34,426
Holy shit.

598
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:39,567
They've broken every single tree
over several acres.

599
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:47,345
I assume what has happened
is that a Jotnar has run through here.

600
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:54,346
A giant, over 200 feet tall, has
chased the Dovre trolls down here.

601
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:58,860
We don't want
Jotnars running around.

602
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:03,024
Give me a break.
Do you all actually believe in trolls?

603
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:09,397
You think a squirrel
rampaged through here?

604
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:15,604
If only the trolls were happy. But TSS
wants to keep a lid on everything.

605
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:35,927
Those may look like
normal power lines,

606
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:41,095
but they're electric fences
to keep the trolls at bay.

607
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:45,470
I don't know how they broke through.
I'll have to check.

608
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:51,503
Let's go visit the clowns
in charge of the power grid.

609
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:58,114
- Do they know about the trolls?
- No way.

610
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:03,114
Have you had any problems
up in Dovre?

611
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:08,460
Yes, you could say that.
You can hang your coats here.

612
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:15,526
Over here.

613
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:23,171
Several hundred meters of power line,
knocked to the ground. 300,000 volts.

614
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:27,273
- When did this happen?
- Three weeks ago.

615
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:31,810
- Do you know how it happened?
- No. No one does.

616
01:21:31,854 --> 01:21:38,225
Those cables are supposed to
withstand hurricanes. We have no clue.

617
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:42,993
- Is this a school project?
- Yes. Volda College.

618
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,965
- Are you a teacher?
- No.

619
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,833
Where does that line go?

620
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:51,203
It runs from here...

621
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,573
then north, in a loop,
and back to here.

622
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,673
- So it runs in a circle?
- Yes, exactly.

623
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:02,240
You don't find that strange?

624
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:05,014
Maybe a little.

625
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:10,424
- Yes, it is strange.
- The power leads to nowhere.

626
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:15,897
Well, it does lead in a circle.
And in a beautiful landscape.

627
01:22:18,801 --> 01:22:24,239
If a Jotnar runs through a power line,
something is seriously wrong.

628
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:27,003
I'd better get up there
and try to find it.

629
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:35,416
The territory starts there.

630
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:43,517
It's hell to put up new pylons.
Activists and farmers always complain.

631
01:22:43,559 --> 01:22:46,585
I think they're pretty.

632
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:12,918
Those were placed out here
as food for trolls.

633
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:30,128
This is the territory.
We have been here.

634
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,834
And here.
And no sign of trolls.

635
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:37,642
I think we should try this area next.

636
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:42,582
There's a TSS cabin up there
where we can wait.

637
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:40,734
<i>Some scientists say it is caused by</i>
<i>natural phenomena, while others...</i>

638
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:44,405
<i>... more than 1000 quakes</i>
<i>registered...</i>

639
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:48,075
We are in a troll territory now.

640
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:53,315
You don't seem to like
entering these territories.

641
01:24:53,355 --> 01:24:57,348
Is there some particular reason?

642
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:05,498
There was a mountain troll territory
up in Strynefjell.

643
01:25:05,534 --> 01:25:11,837
Back in the '70s they decided to build
tunnels through that troll-rich area.

644
01:25:13,976 --> 01:25:19,437
Both the TSS and I tried to object,
but to no avail.

645
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:26,683
I was given the task of going in
and exterminating all the trolls.

646
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:29,213
Every last one.

647
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:34,194
Pregnant females.
Kids.

648
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:36,459
Newborns
that hadn't even learned to walk.

649
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:43,932
It was a massacre.

650
01:25:55,851 --> 01:26:00,914
Hans' entire life
has revolved around trolls.

651
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:05,120
Every day has been a struggle
with and for trolls.

652
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:10,826
In many ways, he is a superhero
here in Norway.

653
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:13,334
What would we have done without him?

654
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:19,102
That makes it all the more important
for us to make this movie.

655
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:41,123
My shoulder.

656
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,999
Are you alright?

657
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:22,559
The sun will be up in an hour.

658
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:27,304
Should we go too?

659
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:50,831
He sounds a bit big,
but I'll give it a shot.

660
01:27:57,973 --> 01:28:02,171
It sounds like
he's snapped completely.

661
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,235
This could be problematic.

662
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:08,739
Your phone is ringing, Hans.

663
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,617
- Where is it?
- On my seat.

664
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,885
Thomas speaking.

665
01:28:14,923 --> 01:28:18,859
He's a little busy right now.
Can I...

666
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:23,296
Rabies?

667
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:29,134
- That Ringlefinch had rabies.
- Let me talk to Hilde.

668
01:28:29,171 --> 01:28:31,469
Hi Hilde.

669
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:35,239
Are you sure?

670
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:39,471
That makes sense.

671
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:41,448
Okay.
You take care too.

672
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,008
Bye.

673
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:49,047
I'll bet all the trolls
we've met had rabies.

674
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:55,393
This guy has spread it to
the Ringlefinches and Mountain Kings.

675
01:28:57,098 --> 01:29:00,625
- And even to you, Thomas.
- Me?

676
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,967
I don't have rabies.

677
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,810
Hello!
Dogs have rabies.

678
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:14,948
If you have rabies,
you have to get to a hospital.

679
01:29:14,983 --> 01:29:20,080
If you think he has rabies,
he needs medical attention!

680
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:22,385
I don't have rabies.

681
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:30,024
You can't just say I have rabies!
If so, we need a hospital now!

682
01:29:30,065 --> 01:29:34,798
- That beast is on its way. Get inside!
- I couldn't care less!

683
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:01,253
- We can't stay in here.
- Look!

684
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:05,199
Is it coming this way?

685
01:30:11,373 --> 01:30:14,570
Go outside?
Are you crazy?

686
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:16,304
He's leaving!

687
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:29,485
Don't move!
I'll try to lure him this way.

688
01:30:40,068 --> 01:30:45,904
<i>What a friend we have in Jesus...</i>

689
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,070
What is he doing?

690
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,916
What's happening?

691
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:17,359
The flash ran out of power.

692
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,309
Definitely rabies.

693
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:35,448
Can we go to the hospital now?

694
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:40,318
- No, he needs a few more doses.
- What are you talking about?

695
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:43,980
But first I have to wear him out.

696
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:04,305
He's closing in on us!

697
01:33:09,851 --> 01:33:12,581
- Now we're getting away!
- Good.

698
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:17,819
- There's somebody up ahead!
- Stop, Hans!

699
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,723
- Get in!
- Hurry, dammit!

700
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,266
Go! Go!

701
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:33,707
- Where are you going?
- Stay here!

702
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:39,607
- Hans!
- Get back inside!

703
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:53,392
Oh my God!

704
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:57,528
Get back in the car!

705
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:06,296
- Who are you?
- A seismologist.

706
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:13,440
I have to get in front of him.

707
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:34,260
Look out!

708
01:35:14,976 --> 01:35:16,967
Is it on?

709
01:35:36,598 --> 01:35:38,793
Hans, what are you doing?

710
01:35:44,272 --> 01:35:46,536
I have to give him the finishing blow!

711
01:35:51,613 --> 01:35:54,047
- With that?
- Yes.

712
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:59,181
I hope you have
all the footage you need.

713
01:36:03,558 --> 01:36:06,925
This road will lead you
to the highway.

714
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,811
There's no more roaring!

715
01:37:33,448 --> 01:37:35,109
Malica...

716
01:37:36,117 --> 01:37:40,577
Stop fooling around.
That's troll on tape.

717
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:43,613
Here is the footage.

718
01:37:49,297 --> 01:37:51,925
Am I bleeding?
What did you say?

719
01:37:51,966 --> 01:37:55,527
- Are you okay?
- Sure, I'm fine.

720
01:37:58,406 --> 01:38:00,931
Look!
Over there!

721
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:12,948
Isn't that Finn and the others?

722
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:17,686
Shit, it's Finn.
Give me the camera!

723
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:21,491
Thomas, what are you doing?

724
01:39:09,043 --> 01:39:12,444
The recordings end here.

725
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:16,076
No body was ever found in the mine

726
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:18,984
and the teenagers behind the recordings
have vanished without a trace.

727
01:39:19,987 --> 01:39:23,286
We strongly encourage anyone
with information about their fate

728
01:39:23,324 --> 01:39:26,384
to contact Filmkameratene AS
or your nearest police station.

729
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:30,628
It has been impossible
to get the Government

730
01:39:30,665 --> 01:39:32,997
to confirm the existence
of the Troll Security Service.

731
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:36,231
However, an indirect confirmation
was given

732
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,295
during Norwegian Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg's

733
01:39:38,339 --> 01:39:40,705
biannual press conference
in Oslo on June 25, 2010.

734
01:39:40,741 --> 01:39:42,834
The press didn't get the point.

735
01:39:43,845 --> 01:39:48,111
We want to protect the Norwegian
environment as best we can.

736
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:51,380
Few people
find power grids attractive.

737
01:39:51,419 --> 01:39:53,444
I certainly don't.

738
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:56,150
Norwegians are pro electricity,

739
01:39:56,190 --> 01:40:00,889
but against power lines.
That won't work in the long run.

740
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:05,991
Norway has trolls,
so more power lines are needed.

741
01:40:06,033 --> 01:40:08,797
- That's just the way it is.
- That's a wrap!

742
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:12,602
