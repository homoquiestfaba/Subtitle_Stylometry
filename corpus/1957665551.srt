[music over dialogue]

4
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,660
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, Lisa.

5
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,128
- Is Maggie up next?
- Yeah.

6
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,630
- Are you nervous?
- What are you, kidding?

7
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,232
She takes it on
for both of us.

8
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,568
She's probably in the back
right now throwing up.

9
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,336
Do you want a drink?

10
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,071
- No, I'm okay.
- Okay.

* Fading

13
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:55,649
* What I give to you

[vocalizing]

15
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:14,101

And our next contestant,
Maggie Shire.

[applause]

17
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:28,316
* Come to me softly

18
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,784
* When you say goodbye

19
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,887
* Please...

[instrumental soundtrack

21
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,961
* Just come to me

22
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,798
* Softly

23
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,869

[cheers and applause]

25
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,952
[man] Okay, I got one.

26
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:42,490
Why do blondes have one 
 more brain cell than horses?

27
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:45,759
- I give up.
- So they don't shit
 during the parade.

28
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:49,129
- [laughing]
- I just heard that!

29
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,831
Where did you hear that?
I just heard it.

30
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,700
A friend of mine told me.

31
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,537
Oh, that's funny.
That is funny.

32
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,138
Hey, Maggie!

33
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,073
- Hey, Mag.
- Hi.

34
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,911
- Dad.
- So where you coming from
 all decked out?

35
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:07,147
Well, I'll tell you,
a singing contest.

36
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,517
- A singing contest?
- Did you win?

37
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,152
Hey, mind your manners.
Winning is not everything.

38
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,187
Yeah, but it's everything
when you win.

39
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,056
- Get out of town!
- She's right. She's right.

40
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,225
All right!
I told you she won.

41
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,562
You won! Damn.
How the hell did
you know she won?

42
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,097
It's written all over
her face. That's how I know.

43
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,266
- Congratulations, Maggie.
- Maggie, rub my arm.

44
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,269
Come on, rub some of that
winning potion on me.

45
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,871
Come on, I'm losing
my shirt here.

46
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,139
What about my arm
for God's sake?

47
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,342
You're gonna rub his arm.

48
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,511
Don't start that!

49
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:41,214
- Scared you, didn't I?
- I'll scare you.

50
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,716
Too late, she touched me.

51
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,952
Good for you.

52
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,921
Yeah, wish you could
have been there.

53
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:52,793
I saved a seat for you,
but apparently you had
other plans.

54
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:57,598
Well, the game.

55
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,900
Yeah.

56
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,569
It's okay.

57
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,809
- Okay, king's bet.
- All right, all right.

58
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,478
Come on, put your money up.

59
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,381
Lay it up here.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, grandma!

60
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,048
When you were winning,
you weren't in such a rush.

61
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,084
- Yeah, well, you know?
- Today, will you?

62
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,006
I like it.
I like it. It's funny.

63
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,142
Bye, Dad.
I'm going over to Jimmy's.
I'll see you in the morning.

64
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,344
- Bye, guys.
- Take care, Maggie.

65
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,781
Touch me, Maggie,
before you go.
Just touch the fingers.

66
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,950
You be careful.

67
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,922
I've been doing a lot
of thinking lately.

68
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,258
It's like for the first
time in my life,

69
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,530
I feel like I'm in control,
that I know what I want.

70
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:07,067
It's always been
so confusing before.

71
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,304
But now I know that

72
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:15,242
I want you.
I want you in my life.

73
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,846
What are you saying?

74
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,313
I think what I'm saying
is that

75
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:24,351
I want us to discuss,
you know, our future.

76
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,621
Well, that's good, Jimmy,
because I've been thinking
about the future, too.

77
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,991
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I think it's time
 we move out of this town.

78
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,161
What do you mean move out?
To where?

79
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,598
- New York City.
- What are you, nuts?

80
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,333
I know it sounds crazy,
but if I wanna make it
as a singer,

81
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,637
- I really don't have a choice.
- Wait, wait, wait. Make it?

82
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,640
- Since when did this happen?
- Since recently.

83
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:50,911
You're right when you said
it's time. It is time.

84
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,615
It's time for me to be happy.

85
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,316
What the hell
does that mean, Maggie,

86
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,787
"time for you to be happy?"
What does that mean?

87
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,890
It means going after
my dream.

88
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,893
Your dream.
So you win one contest?

89
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,929
- Give us some time, Maggie.
- We don't need time.

90
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,664
Yeah, we do need time.

91
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:13,767
We need time for this
stupid idea of yours
to disappear.

92
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:17,004
You're more terrified
than you can possibly imagine.

93
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:21,108
But you gotta understand
that I've gotta do this.

94
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,744
Don't you think you're
being a little selfish?

95
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,079
What?

96
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,183
I'm talking to you
about spending the rest
of our lives together here

97
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:33,086
in this town,
about raising kids,

98
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,557
here in this town.

99
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,561
And you're going off
about some bullshit idea.

100
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:44,231
Why don't you just give
this a serious thought?

101
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,134
I thought about it, okay?

102
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,269
New York City would
eat you alive.

103
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,439
And you ain't got
what it takes to make it.

104
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,042
Yeah, I'm real sorry, okay?

105
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:59,079
But somebody had to tell
you the truth. It's for
your own good, Maggie.

106
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,051
To hell with you.

107
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,721
Just trying to spare
you some grief, Maggie.

108
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,696
Daddy.

109
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,634
I'd like
to talk to you.

110
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,070
What's on your mind?

111
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,038
I wanna borrow some money.

112
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,249
Daddy, you listening?

113
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,856
Money for what?

114
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,359
I'm moving to New York City.

115
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,361
Sure you are. [laughs]

116
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,231
No, I'm serious.
I'm ready to move.

117
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,768
You wanna move out?

118
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,370
Well, yeah, I have to.

119
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,873
I have to be where
the industry is.

120
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,975
What industry?

121
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,044
Music.

122
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,683
I don't expect you
to understand any of this.

123
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,921
Just trust me that
this is something
that I need to do.

124
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:17,290
This is all complete nonsense,
and you know it.

125
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:21,461
Why is it nonsense?
Because it's something I want?

126
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,364
If it's something I want,
you'll be sure to
take it from me.

127
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,334
- That's enough.
- You know what? Never mind.

128
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,871
I don't need your help.
I don't need anybody
else's help.

129
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,473
I'll save my own money.

130
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,677
So that's it.
That's what I had to tell you.

131
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,846
I'll be on my way soon.

132
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,649
On your way to where?

133
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,852
Somewhere, anywhere.

134
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,354
I don't care as long as
it's somewhere other than here.

135
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,723
And you're certain
you're ready for this, huh?

136
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,591
Yeah, I'm looking
for an apartment today.

137
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,094
Today?

138
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,296
You think you're just gonna
traipse in there, sign
on the dotted line,

139
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,233
they're gonna hand
you a set of keys?
It doesn't work that way.

140
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:04,071
You're also gonna need
down payments of some kind,
security deposits,

141
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,273
things like that.

142
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,608
You're not prepared
for something like this.

143
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,679
Well, why do you think
I'm asking you for the money?

144
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,150
But, please, forget it.

145
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,720
I'll figure it out
on my own.

146
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:26,827
Hey, the anniversary
of mom's death is coming up,

147
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,163
and I'll bet you that's
what this is all about.

148
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:33,400
No, that's not it.

149
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,738
I just think that it'll
be best for both of us

150
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,272
if I leave.

151
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,202
Well, this should do it.

152
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,473
Thanks.

153
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:20,313
So guess I'm ready.

154
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,284
That you are.

155
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:29,189
So I'll try to get
back to visit soon.

156
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,893
Good.

157
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,505
Okay.

158
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,318
[Maggie] 
 Dear Mom, I started 
 out this afternoon

159
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,889
saying goodbye 
 to dad and heading 
 off to New York City.

160
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:45,192
But something stopped me. 
 I couldn't do it.

161
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,194
So I just drove and drove,

162
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,829
literally going to 
 where the road led me.

163
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,199
I ended up in Brownsville.

164
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:56,436
I figure I'll settle here 
 for a few months until 
 I get my footing.

165
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:01,041
This apartment building,
Mr. Nutso, does not
allow animals.

166
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,644
So if I find out that
that cat belongs to you,

167
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,414
so help me, I'm gonna throw
you both out on the street,

168
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,082
'cause I don't want
any part of it.

169
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:13,420
Animals cause fleas,
and fleas cause irritation.

170
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,956
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

171
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,825
And I wanna tell you,
if I see that cat,

172
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,930
I'm gonna twist its
annoying, agitating
head right off myself.

173
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:27,334
I assume I'm making
myself perfectly clear.

174
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,904
You are an inferior person

175
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,439
to judge a cat.

176
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,242
Me inferior? Ha!

177
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,544
Be gone.

178
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,047
Oh, good afternoon, ma'am.

179
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,882
Good afternoon.

180
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:48,121
- [cat meows]
- Come here, cutie.
 Come here, cutie.

181
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,857
Come here. Come here.

182
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,227
Aww, it's not safe for you 
to wander around the halls.

183
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,163
No, it's not, huh?

184
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:59,399
You wanna go home
to your daddy, huh?

185
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:02,635
Yeah, hey, I got
a little secret for you.

186
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,604
If you see a bad man
and he's yelling at you,

187
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,340
you run your little
ass off, okay?

188
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,276
Come here. Come on.

189
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,144
We'll go to daddy.

190
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,712
Oh, yeah.

191
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,553
Okay. [taps door]

192
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,924
- Now what do you-- oh!
- No, it's okay.

193
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,196
- Why, hello, pretty.
 Come here, honey.
- I'm sorry.

194
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,431
I'm Maggie.
I called you about
the room for rent.

195
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,133
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

196
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,803
Well, please come in
and join me for a snack.

197
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,472
- Cookies.
- I'm not hungry.

198
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:43,443
Oh. All right, then.

199
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,212
Peanut butter?

200
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,114
It's my favorite.

201
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,234
Actually, I make these
much better than
the sugar ones.

202
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,501
[sniffs] Smell.

203
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,970
[sniffs] Mmm.

204
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,940
You rang on the right day.
That's for sure.

205
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,942
- Yeah.
- Come on in.

206
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,179
[man] Chocolate, regular
or low-fat?

207
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,948
- Regular.
- Okay.

208
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,376
Come on in.
Come on in. Sit down.

209
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,743
The name's Rachel.

210
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:54,314
- Hi, I'm Maggie.
- Maggie. Pleasure.

211
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,284
Here. Sit down.

212
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,387
Oh, Maggie.

213
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,823
Listen, do you like that

214
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,525
kind of soft cheese

215
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,062
- that's in a can?
- No.

216
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,198
Me neither.

217
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,166
Why do you ask?

218
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,702
It was on sale
and I bought some.

219
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:19,072
Then when I prepared
the menu for tonight,

220
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:23,976
I remembered I can't stand
that damn orange goo.

221
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,678
I'll just do away with it,

222
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:30,550
and I'll have plain
butter noodles instead.

223
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:35,155
There. That's for you.

224
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,126
Yeah. [laughs]

225
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,663
[sighs]

226
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,636
Mmm! This is good.

227
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,071
They are quite good,
aren't they?

228
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,807
So...

229
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,909
can we talk
about the room for rent?

230
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:00,580
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

231
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,552
So I do have a job.

232
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,854
Oh, that's nice.

233
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,061
So how much is it?

234
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:19,132
How much would you
like it to be?

235
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,569
How much would I like it
to be?

236
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,304
$300.

237
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,538
How about $500?

238
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,641
- $500.
- All right, $300.

239
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:32,412
Really? That's great.

240
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,214
Can I see it?

241
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:38,117
Now? We're snacking.

242
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,253
We're snacking?

243
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,088
Yeah.

244
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,458
Okay, well,
how about you snack

245
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:48,261
and I'll look?

246
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,330
Where is it?

247
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,134
It's just the other side
of that area rug there.

248
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,137
- The door's straight ahead.
- Okay.

249
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,750
Whoa.

250
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,822
- You can't be serious.
- What?

251
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:23,530
After I tidy it up,
it'll be quite comfortable.

252
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,365
- I don't know.
- $250.

253
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:29,636
Half off the original
asking price.

254
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,605
- Okay. $250.
- $250 it is.

255
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,174
But I stand firm!

256
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,390
Sounds perfect.

257
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,429
Mm-hmm.

258
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,940
[grunts]
I'll be right back.

259
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,277
No, I think we can
salvage this one.
Let me see it.

260
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,386
- [cork pops]
- [man] Ah!

261
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,166
See? No problem.

262
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,036
Sir, that's okay.
I can get you another bottle.

263
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,805
No, I wouldn't dream
of putting you through
that again.

264
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,343
Sir, if you'd like,
I'll have another waiter
open the bottle for you.

265
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,711
I apologize.
That's not what I meant.

266
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,747
This bottle will
be just fine.

267
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,549
Okay, well,

268
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,251
are you ready to order
or can I give you a few minutes?

269
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,854
Have you been
working here long?

270
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:32,291
How about I give you
a few minutes?

271
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,893
I'm Tom.

272
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,497
I'm Maggie.

273
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,500
Hello, Maggie.

274
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,606
You're very charming.

275
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,307
Charming.

276
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:56,649
* It's your day today

277
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,952
* It's your day today

278
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,756
* It's your day today,
child *

279
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,059
* It's her day today

280
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,662
* It's your day

281
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:13,265
* Dear Rachel!

282
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:17,870
* It's your day today! *

283
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,706
[shrieks]

284
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:20,840
[exhales]

285
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:24,911
- [laughs]
- [knock on door]

286
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,227
Oh! You've arrived!

287
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,431
Good. Come on in.
Come on in.

288
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,298
Good, good, good, good.

289
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:49,001
You're just in time
for the party.

290
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:53,440
Hey, how's it look, huh?
[laughs]

291
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,577
Here's your hat.

292
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,616
It's cake time!
It's cake time!
It's cake time!

293
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,586
Come on! Come on!
[laughing]

294
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:21,968
So what kind is it?

295
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:26,639
Strawberry shortcake
was chosen for this occasion.

296
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:31,143
- It's my favorite.
- Oh, good! Good.

297
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:34,146
Care for the vanilla
or strawberry ice cream?

298
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,049
- Vanilla.
- Oh, vanilla?

299
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,919
As you wish.
As you wish.

300
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,456
There we go.

301
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,061
Here we go.

302
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:53,199
Get rid of these.
There.

303
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,909
So how old are you?

304
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:07,847
I'm 109 years old.

305
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,817
Wow. You look
great for 109.

306
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,686
You don't look so bad
for 47.

307
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,422
Thanks.

308
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,627
So do you have any children?

309
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:26,032
Yes, Miss Nosy Pants,
I do.

310
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:30,369
I have a daughter.
Much older than you.

311
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,205
Does she live around here?

312
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,374
Haven't any idea.

313
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:43,149
Will you be having
much company?

314
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:46,418
I mean, since we'll
be cohabitating,

315
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,755
it's legitimate
for me to ask.

316
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,059
No, you don't need
to worry about that.

317
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,027
I don't know anybody
around here.

318
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:59,699
I want to give
you my schedule

319
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:03,202
so as not to create
any confusion, all right?

320
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:07,940
Now between the hours
of 4:00 and 5:00

321
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,009
is my hour of dance.

322
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:13,345
Between the hours
of 5:00 and 6:00
is my hour of activities.

323
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,248
Now so you know,
I dance alone,

324
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:19,018
and I wish not
to be disturbed.

325
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:22,822
However, you may join me
in activities

326
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:27,493
if under the rare occasion
you should beat me
at one of my games,

327
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,097
you will have the option
the following day of
joining me at dance.

328
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,799
[laughs]

329
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,371
Thank you so much
for the cake.

330
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:43,209
I think I'm gonna
start unpacking now.

331
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:54,353
Hey, Bill,
mind your manners there.

332
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,123
Bill's a great name
for a cat.

333
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,557
No, I disagree.

334
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,359
Bill is not a great name
for a cat.

335
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,461
Bill is a great name
for a man.

336
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,496
However,
if I must be misnamed,

337
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:09,201
then by golly I'd feel
a bit better misnaming
something else in return.

338
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,504
Only difference is that cat
don't give a damn what
his name is.

339
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:15,574
So nobody gets hurt,
and now I feel better.

340
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,543
I'm sorry.
Are you misnamed?

341
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,879
I don't think you've told me
your first name.

342
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,513
My name is Rachel.

343
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,783
Folks don't know me well
call me Mr. Rachel.

344
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,352
But I am Rachel.

345
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:30,122
- Well, happy birthday, Rachel.
- Well, thank you

346
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:34,126
and welcome
to your new home, Maggie.

347
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,452
Whoa.

348
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:03,522
- [TV playing]
- Gee, isn't that funny.

349
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:15,201
- Hey, no, no, no,
 don't strain yourself.
- Oh!

350
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,436
Maggie, Maggie.

351
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,538
Look at that hat
she's got on her head.

352
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,841
Look at the grapes
on her...

353
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,512
And he's eating one of them.

354
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,490
Dear Mom,

355
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,927
I moved in 
 with my new roommate.

356
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:46,232
He's a crazy 
 old man named Rachel.

357
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:53,205
I feel so alone tonight 
 that I miss you more than ever.

358
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,907
[all laughing]

359
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,281
I love you.

360
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,253
Margaret.

361
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,181
So is that a good place?

362
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,350
You're talking about clubs,
so it depends what you're into.

363
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,452
Gimme a minute.

364
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,223
- Hi.
- Hi.

365
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:45,858
You're here alone.

366
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,427
No.

367
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,462
Where's your friend?

368
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,865
He's right there.

369
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,470
Hey, you, get lost!
[laughs]

370
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:02,641
[indistinct]

371
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,112
- Ted, your mother's calling.
 Come on!
- No.

372
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,314
- I'm really getting tired
- Leave her alone.

373
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:11,417
- of you.
- Go away, scat. Scat.

374
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,985
All right.

375
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,125
What was that all about?

376
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:21,593
Got crabs
from him last week.

377
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:23,963
He ain't worth it.
Trust me.

378
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,998
Crabs?

379
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,537
- I'm Julia.
- I'm Maggie.

380
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,541
It's nice to meet you,
Maggie. Haven't seen
you around before.

381
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:38,510
I just moved here
from Portage.

382
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:41,580
Well, we have got ourselves
one small town girl.

383
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,549
You better be more careful.

384
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,351
Hey, can I buy you a drink?

385
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:49,355
Bobby, this doll's
buying me a drink.

386
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,359
- Two Buds.
- [Julia growls]

387
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,294
[Bobby] Anything for you?

388
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:59,098
- Yeah, a Bud and--
- He knows.

389
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,599
Make it a double.

390
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,970
- Who's that?
- You don't wanna know.

391
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,906
Yes, I do.

392
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,409
Well, I guess you gotta
learn for yourself.

393
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:14,513
- His name is Nick.
- Nick.

394
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:18,584
Yeah, listen,
Nick may take some time,

395
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:21,553
and Ted, he's too sleazy.

396
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,522
Let's see who else
we got here.

397
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,392
Oh, here we go.
My associate.

398
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:29,728
No, you don't have to do this.
I don't care to meet anybody.

399
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,466
I want you to meet Maggie.

400
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,835
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi.

401
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,571
His name's Cory.

402
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,540
I gotta make a call.

403
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:46,712
- You wanna play a game?
- Sure.

404
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,185
So how do you know Julia?

405
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,720
I don't. We just met.

406
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:58,357
- Are you two friends?
- No, we work together.

407
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,592
You should come by sometime.

408
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:03,595
So what are we playing?

409
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:06,765
- Nine ball.
- Oh, okay.

410
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:11,003
- You break.
- Okay.

411
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:30,589
Whoo-hoo!
[laughs]

412
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:34,994
Whoo! Oh, I wish you'd
accept my challenge.

413
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:37,763
Maybe. I'm just observing
your technique for right now.

414
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,298
Technique?
[blows raspberries]

415
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:42,701
Talent! Talent.

416
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:47,039
Number two ball
off right bumper

417
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,175
into number two pocket.

418
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,445
Whoa-ho-ho!

419
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:57,649
Okay, one hop in the cage.

420
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:03,289
[softly] Here we go.

421
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,192
Perfect! I win.

422
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:10,496
Maggie, I'll let you in
on a little secret of mine.

423
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:14,466
Discipline is the key
to my success.

424
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,837
Every day one must work
at it.

425
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,839
Every day.

426
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:26,545
Here we go.
Here we go.

427
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,481
Whoa. Yay!

428
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,450
Whoa!

429
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,919
[Maggie] All right,
I'm gonna play.

430
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,721
Glad to hear it.

431
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,992
Don't be nervous.

432
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,527
Okay.

433
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,596
Good.

434
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,598
- Ooh!
- [Rachel laughs]

435
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:50,769
I wanted to ask you
about those statues.

436
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,605
Maggie.

437
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,908
Those are my guardian angels.

438
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,612
Your guardian angels?

439
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,782
- You poor thing.
- What?

440
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:08,454
Activities are over.

441
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,756
We need to talk.

442
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,495
What?

443
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,565
Don't you know
where yours is?

444
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,233
No, I don't know
where it is.

445
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,202
I don't even know
what it is.

446
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,904
What? Tell me.
The suspense is killing me.

447
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,708
Maggie, dear,
this is very serious.

448
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,245
I am pained to see

449
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,616
that you are not
in communication
with your angel.

450
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,488
An angel watches over you.

451
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:47,593
An angel would help mend
that broken heart of yours.

452
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,429
Why would you say that
I have a broken heart?

453
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,899
Maggie. Maggie.
Maggie. Maggie.

454
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,835
How do you know you're okay?

455
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,670
How do you know, by golly,

456
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,340
it's okay to cross the street,
to fall in love

457
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:05,344
if you don't have
somebody right there?

458
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,979
Right there.

459
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,682
I don't know.
I guess I don't.

460
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,321
I'm gonna tell you a story.

461
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:22,027
I married my Helen
because of him.

462
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,333
And what would I have
done without her?

463
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,669
Tuesday,

464
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:35,507
December 1, 1946

465
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:40,146
I was led to the most
beautiful woman in the world.

466
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,016
Yeah, I was delivering
parcels

467
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,018
for a very large company,
with many, many workers,

468
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:51,923
but it was I who was
given her package.

469
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,926
Yeah, she lived
on the seventh floor

470
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,063
of a really
quite charming building.
There was no elevator.

471
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,731
I had to run up
seven flights,

472
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,201
and by the time I reached
the landing,

473
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,936
I had to stop
to catch my breath.

474
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,541
I was gasping and gasping.

475
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:12,978
When she opened the door,

476
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,714
I laid my eyes on her.

477
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,684
Pow!

478
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:22,721
My breath was taken away.

479
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:26,725
I was hit by his arrow.

480
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:30,329
A pinch of pain

481
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,898
I felt in my heart was him.

482
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,702
I couldn't move.

483
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,741
Yet, I never felt so alive
in my life.

484
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:48,647
If he hadn't been there,
it would never have happened.

485
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,284
It would never
have happened.

486
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:56,788
How could you deprive yourself
of such wonderfulness?

487
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,758
I don't know.

488
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,894
We must see

489
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:05,197
that you are protected

490
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,599
and watched over.

491
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,668
You deserve it.

492
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,306
Hmm.

493
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,311
All right,
speak your minds now.

494
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:21,713
Which one of you wants

495
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:25,351
to take on the challenge
of this virgin of life?

496
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,785
Hmm?

497
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,752
A match

498
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:03,121
made in heaven.

499
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,562
- Maggie May!
- Hey, how you doing?

500
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:13,131
- Ever been called
 "Maggie May" before?
- No, never.

501
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,166
- You're the first.
- * Maggie!

502
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,636
I know. I know.
I know it inside and out.

503
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,838
I'm gonna make
you my special.

504
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,374
Oh! What is this place?

505
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,510
You gotta check it out.

506
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:30,316
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

507
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,985
- Mmm.
- [laughs]

508
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,155
- Enjoy the buzz.
- [both laugh]

509
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,735
Hey. Hey.

510
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,137
- How you doing?
- Hey.

511
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,174
- How are you?
- Exceptionally well,
 thank you.

512
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,643
What are you listening to?

513
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:01,046
It's my daily dose
of Oscar Brown Jr.

514
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,416
Ooh, look at all
these albums.

515
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,217
- Wow.
- Yeah.

516
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,454
We got albums there that'll
never be remastered.

517
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:12,057
I mean, you can listen
to Jimmy Drew
or Floyd Council

518
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,360
or Wink Martindale,
if you're in the mood

519
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,362
for a little bullshit
religious entertainment.

520
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,664
We got records here
that you'll never
find anywhere.

521
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:22,067
- Where'd they get them?
- I've been collecting them
 my whole life.

522
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,069
- I own the place.
- You do?

523
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,905
Yeah, people come in,
they drink coffee

524
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,273
and they listen
to some music.

525
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,009
- What a great idea.
- Yeah.

526
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,913
A lot of the classics
have been remastered,

527
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,416
but we got pretty much
a lot of everything.

528
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:40,118
So what do you like?

529
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,622
I don't know if I'd
know most of these,
I'm embarrassed to admit.

530
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,891
Yeah, so, what?
You're not really
a music lover?

531
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,360
I am. I am.
Music is my life.

532
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:51,497
I love to sing.
I'm inspired by
Aretha Franklin,

533
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,299
but I don't have much
knowledge of anyone
besides her.

534
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,702
Are you serious
about your singing?

535
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,637
Yes, I am.

536
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,409
So how about Thelma Jones,

537
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:04,910
Barbara McNair,

538
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,078
Big Mama Thornton?

539
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:13,151
Buffy Sainte-Marie,
Dinah Washington?

540
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,554
- Do you know any of these?
- No.

541
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,589
God. Wow!

542
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:19,625
You are about

543
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:22,894
to receive a slice
of heaven.

544
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,431
Just you sit
right down there.

545
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,568
And enjoy the ride.
Here you go.

546
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:32,604
Okay.

547
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:37,676
- My God!
- What?

548
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,579
- It's invisible.
- What?

549
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:45,216
It's invisible.
The damn thing is invisible.

550
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,886
That's just its symbol.

551
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:51,256
You don't carry the symbol
around with you.

552
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:55,861
I thought that was
obvious. Jeez.

553
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,530
So what's wrong with Cory?

554
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,832
Nothing. He's a nice guy.

555
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:03,001
That's it, isn't it?
He's too nice.

556
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,870
What's that supposed
to mean?

557
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,639
That's why you don't like him.
He's a nice guy.
I know your type.

558
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,208
You are making all this up.
You realize that?

559
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,511
So are you gonna explain
the clothes and the get-up?

560
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,648
- 'Cause you look nice.
- That's the idea.
 I got a date.

561
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:21,587
All right, the plan is
I look absolutely smashing.

562
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,122
I get him all excited,

563
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,924
treat him like shit
the entire night.

564
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:29,495
Whoo! Healthy relationship.
Good for you.

565
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:31,362
I gotta go.
I don't wanna keep
him waiting.

566
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:35,200
- Oh, heaven forbid. Bye.
- Bye.

567
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,344
* He's so crazy

568
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,081
* Yeah, he's crazy

569
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:53,919
* About our love...

570
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,756
- Hey.
- Hey.

571
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,558
Dinah Washington.

572
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:03,061
For the home,
Dinah Washington,
for the car.

573
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,330
Dinah Washington
for your soul.

574
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:08,099
Awww. I can't thank you
enough for this, Cory.

575
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,835
No problem. That's fine.

576
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:13,304
Listen, I'm about to close up.
You wanna play a game of pool?

577
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:15,541
No, actually,
I'm kind of tired.

578
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:18,143
I think I'm just gonna
go home and get some sleep,

579
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,846
but I'll take a rain check.

580
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,114
Okay,
I'll hold you to it.

581
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,751
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

582
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:29,688
See you later.

583
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:42,267
[telephone ringing]

584
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,442
Now how does this thing work?

585
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,113
Hello.

586
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:58,149
Hello. Is Maggie there?

587
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,919
No, she's not. 
 Who is this?

588
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:04,956
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I know who this is.

589
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,927
Trickery will get you nowhere,
my pasta eating friend.

590
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,263
- What?  
- Whether I have a cat,
 whether I have a roommate,

591
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,399
or whether I dance
in the nude till dawn,

592
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:17,102
it's of no business of yours.

593
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,170
Who is this?

594
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,340
Oh, well,
I beg your pardon.

595
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,310
You are speaking to the man
of the house,

596
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,278
as if you didn't know.

597
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:31,249
What man? I thought she lived
with a Rachel.

598
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,986
I am Rachel and she does--

599
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,989
or perhaps does not
live with me.

600
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:40,325
Now you own up
to your identity.

601
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:43,194
This is her father.

602
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:47,265
Oh, can I take a message,
please?

603
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,367
No message.

604
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:52,537
Oh.

605
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:58,276
* Somebody's in trouble *

606
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:14,125
- Hello, Maggie.
- Hi, Tom.

607
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:20,231
Thank you.

608
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,868
That's a beautiful outfit.

609
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:25,036
Thanks.

610
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:29,841
So it took you a while
to call, but I'm awfully
glad you did.

611
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,878
- Are you hungry?
- Actually, I am.

612
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,325
Thank you.

613
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:52,430
- [waiter] Enjoy your meal.
- [Tom] Thank you.

614
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,367
Just a minute.

615
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,712
Beautiful.

616
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:08,680
What's this for?

617
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:12,617
It had you written all
over it. You like it?

618
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,086
I love it.

619
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,655
Truth is I had
a dream about you

620
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,858
and you were wearing
a hat just like that one.

621
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:21,860
I had to see you
with it on.

622
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,294
Are you disappointed?

623
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,163
Not at all.

624
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:27,933
Would you like to hear
about my dream?

625
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:30,501
Not particularly.

626
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:33,972
I would like to take you
somewhere tomorrow afternoon.

627
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,941
Are you available?

628
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:38,543
I suppose.

629
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:40,912
Good.

630
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:44,282
Where are we going?

631
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:46,752
It's a surprise.

632
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:54,860
- Mr. Roscoe.
- Hello, Douglas.

633
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:00,365
- Douglas, I'd like you
 to meet Maggie.
- How do you do?

634
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:03,068
- Maggie, this is
 my friend Douglas.
- How do you do?

635
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:06,537
They've only been going
about 15 minutes.

636
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:09,640
- How's Albert?
- Good.
 Yeah, he's doing great.

637
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,442
Thanks for asking,
Douglas,

638
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,278
and thanks for this.

639
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:14,980
Anytime, Mr. Roscoe.

640
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,350
I'm gonna be home the night
of the performance

641
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,520
so the best
I could do is rehearsal.

642
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,229
It's beautiful.

643
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,445
[sneezes]

644
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,580
- God bless you.
- That's all right.

645
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:51,549
I'm only allergic
to a few things.

646
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,218
What are you allergic to?

647
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,855
Milk and perfume.
You must be wearing some.

648
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:59,257
I am. I'll try
to remember that.

649
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,259
I'd appreciate that.

650
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:04,963
- So who's Albert?
- My son.

651
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:08,733
- How long have you
 been divorced?
- Three years.

652
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:06,224
Oh, my, you look nice.

653
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:08,860
Thank you.
So do you, by the way.

654
00:47:08,894 --> 00:47:11,062
Thank you.

655
00:47:11,096 --> 00:47:12,964
Oh!

656
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,104
Rent.

657
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:24,275
You know, whenever a woman
tried to give me money,

658
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,244
I'd always say,
"Put your money away,"

659
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:29,247
or "I could never
take your money."

660
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,917
But I always did.
[laughs]

661
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,718
What a surprise.

662
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:34,953
Okay, come on, get up.

663
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:37,122
I'm gonna take you
on a picnic.

664
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:39,124
- On a what?
- A picnic.

665
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:41,426
- A picnic, come on.
- Oh, my God. Oh, no!

666
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:43,261
It's good.
Come on, come on.

667
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,230
Come on! Picnic, picnic.

668
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:47,765
- All right, come on. [grunts]
- Whoopee! Whoopee!

669
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,701
* We're going on a picnic,
we're going... *

670
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:52,837
- * One bright day 
- * In the middle of the night

671
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,140
- * In the middle of the night 
- * Two dead boys--

672
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:58,043
Two dead boys? That doesn't
sound like much fun.

673
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,410
- Come on!
- Come on, what?

674
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:01,112
- It's a song.
- Go on.

675
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:03,148
* One was blind
and the other couldn't see *

676
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:06,117
No, no, that's
not happy enough.
Go back to the girl.

677
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:08,987
* So they got a dummy
for a referee... *

678
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:12,991
Oh, God!

679
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:15,460
You forgot the butter.

680
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:18,629
No, no, no,
it's still quite delicious.

681
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:21,832
Hey, where's the credit
for even bringing food, huh?

682
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:26,737
Where are your parents?

683
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:31,609
That's a question out
of nowhere.

684
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,979
Just on my mind.

685
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:39,317
Well, my mother's dead,
and my father's in Portage.

686
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,486
Why?

687
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,755
Do you keep in touch
with your father?

688
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,357
Not since I moved in.

689
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:48,026
Why's that?

690
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:52,998
My father and I never
got along too well,

691
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:56,767
and, yes, I have tried
to work it out,

692
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:00,638
but nothing ever changed
so it's part of the past now.

693
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,473
And I'm over it.

694
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:06,077
Uh-huh.

695
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:10,081
Well...

696
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:14,052
I'm gonna have
a little talk with him.

697
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:15,586
You know?

698
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,755
Find out what's going on.

699
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:25,030
- Hey, you're still there.
- It's hotter than
 the devil today.

700
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:26,797
Fan's not helping?

701
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:29,500
Hell, no.
Just throws hot air at you.

702
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:32,003
Feels like a hair dryer.

703
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:39,944
[Maggie] Oh.

704
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,947
Hi.

705
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:48,553
This is my roommate
Rachel-- Mr. Rachel. Sorry.

706
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:51,722
This is my friend
Julia and Cory.

707
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:53,424
How do you do?

708
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:56,161
Hi. Nice to meet you.

709
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:58,196
Wow.

710
00:49:58,229 --> 00:50:02,733
[laughs] This is
a regular arcade. Awesome.

711
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:06,471
You two play
with these things?

712
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,074
Not in this heat we don't.

713
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:12,009
Damn hot, isn't it?

714
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:14,812
I'll tell you,
all you want to do
is sleep during the day.

715
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,583
But when you lay down,
you can't fall asleep
'cause it's too damn hot.

716
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:21,052
You're damn right
it's too damn hot.

717
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:23,254
I know.
I agree it's miserable.

718
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:25,090
It's absolutely miserable.

719
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:30,395
You know, they do have
these new things now.
These new inventions.

720
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:33,598
Maybe you heard of them.
They're air conditioners.

721
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:35,233
Boo.

722
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:37,568
They make too much racket.

723
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:40,471
See, smart-ass,
too much racket.

724
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:42,240
Agreed again.

725
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:49,280
[Maggie]
Okay, well, let's go.

726
00:50:49,314 --> 00:50:52,750
Let's go. Come on.

727
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,887
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

728
00:50:56,921 --> 00:51:00,491
- [Rachel] Pleasure is all mine.
- Yeah. Good night.

729
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:02,627
[mouths]

730
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:07,098
See you later.

731
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,067
[scoffs]

732
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,244
Yeah, that's right.

733
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:22,480
Leave me alone in this...

734
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:25,450
in this heat.

735
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:27,518
[laughing]

736
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:29,620
- Let's party.
- Where's she going?

737
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:32,990
God only knows.
I'll make something to drink.
What do you want?

738
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:35,893
- Club soda.
- Yeah.

739
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,862
[rock music playing]

740
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:41,432
All right.
How do you like the band?

741
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:44,669
- I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

742
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:46,771
- Yeah.
- Come on.

743
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:50,675
No way. Look at Lisa.
[laughs]

744
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:55,313
[music continuing]

745
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:40,725
Hello.
All right, listen up.

746
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:43,261
We have with us
a special guest.

747
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:45,129
She's only in town
for one night.

748
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,831
She's only got time
for one song

749
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:48,399
'cause she's gotta catch
a plane to go to London.

750
00:52:48,433 --> 00:52:50,401
You've heard about her
for years, so come on, man,

751
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:54,339
put it together
for Rod Stewart's "Maggie May!"

752
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:57,575
[heart beating]

753
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,744
[panting]

754
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,781
[sound effects over dialogue]

755
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:34,612
[heart beating]

756
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:37,248
[panting]

757
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,859
[no audio]

758
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,769
- Maggie!
- Get away from me!

759
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:03,408
- Calm down.
- Calm down? How could
 you do that to me?

760
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,976
What are you getting off
about, man? I did you a favor.

761
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,945
You call that a favor?

762
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,280
Yeah, you're a singer.

763
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:11,148
So what's the big deal
about singing a song?

764
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,751
I give you an opportunity
thinking you can make
a gig out of it.

765
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:15,653
So yeah,
I think that's a favor.

766
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:18,055
Yeah, but I wasn't prepared.
The band wasn't prepared.

767
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,990
You can't just throw me up
on stage like that.

768
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:22,627
It was the wrong crowd.
I was terrified.

769
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,296
I guess I'm just an idiot
for thinking a singer sings.

770
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,931
I guess it takes more
than the right mood.

771
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:28,666
You know what?
You're probably right, Maggie,

772
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,868
'cause every time
I try to help out,
I screw it up.

773
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:35,205
I wouldn't expect someone
like you with your little
perfect life to understand.

774
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,942
Man, you have not
even lived through half

775
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:41,412
of what I have lived through.

776
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,748
I would have killed
to have somebody go out
of their way for me.

777
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,116
You know what?
You probably just expect it.

778
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,818
Yeah, all right,
I'm the asshole.

779
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:50,921
I'm always the asshole.

780
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,237
[woman] Maggie.

781
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:49,346
Sweetheart.

782
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:57,722
Mom.

783
00:55:57,755 --> 00:56:00,591
[sobbing]

784
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:02,460
It's okay.

785
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:09,233
Everything's gonna be okay.

786
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:19,043
Is it?

787
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:26,651
Mom?

788
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:38,228
[music over dialogue]

789
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:09,126
[music over dialogue]

790
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:22,673
You know, I think some
of what Julia said is true.

791
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:24,374
I should wanna sing
no matter what,

792
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:28,979
and I shouldn't care
what anybody thinks
about me.

793
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:30,481
You shouldn't be
able to shut me up

794
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:35,285
and the thought
of what people think
just paralyzes me.

795
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,855
I'm so embarrassed
that you had

796
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:40,558
to see me walk off stage
like a scared little jackass.

797
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:43,561
Don't--
Don't even think about that.

798
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:46,897
Look, you have chosen
a difficult path,

799
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:49,133
where extremely high hills

800
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:52,136
and very deep valleys
just come with the territory.

801
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:56,440
What happened last night
was part of the ride.

802
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,009
True story.

803
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:02,179
'81. Rolling Stones
are at the L.A. Coliseum.

804
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:04,749
80,000 in attendance.
Prince opens for them.

805
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:06,984
The crowd hates him.

806
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:09,153
And not only is he
mercilessly booed,

807
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:12,456
but they threw anything
and everything at him.

808
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,594
I mean, 80,000 people
simultaneously wanted
that man off the stage.

809
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:19,797
- So what did he do?
- He got the hell
 off the stage.

810
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,000
Interestingly enough,
a reviewer wrote that
if he was capable

811
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:26,270
of upsetting that many
people, he must have
been onto something.

812
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,172
So now you didn't even
open your mouth

813
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,040
and you got that kind
of reaction.

814
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:32,910
So just think what's
in store for you.

815
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:37,982
Something like this
wouldn't bring you
down, would it?

816
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:41,418
I mean, I don't know.

817
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,555
You know what I
really wanna find out--
I mean--

818
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:46,791
look, I keep my life
as simple as possible.

819
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:50,595
Owning a store is as much
responsibility as I care for.

820
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:52,797
I think about getting rid
of it all the time.

821
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,199
Give me
a Terry Southern novel

822
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:57,902
and a Charles Brown LP
and I'm happy, you know?

823
00:58:57,935 --> 00:59:02,539
Life is too short
to do anything
but enjoy yourself.

824
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:06,644
God, I wish I had your
peace and simplicity.

825
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:10,948
You don't, but that's not
necessarily your choice.

826
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:14,018
Yeah, well, it doesn't feel
like I have a choice.

827
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,853
Right.

828
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,756
Yeah, but if I
was more like Julia,

829
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:21,892
it'd be so much easier.
She doesn't care what
people think about her.

830
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:25,930
If somebody booed her,
she'd just flip 'em off
and keep doing her thing.

831
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:28,332
So you have a few fears.

832
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,434
So what? They're gonna
work themselves out.

833
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:32,603
What matters,
what really matters

834
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:35,405
is that you have it
in your heart.

835
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:38,643
And no amount of money
can buy that.

836
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:42,146
Look, and you gotta remember,
you could have run

837
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,413
when they announced you,
but you didn't.

838
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:45,115
You walked up out
onto that stage.

839
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:47,251
And a lot of people,
believe me,

840
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:49,186
a lot of people

841
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,822
would never have even
gotten that far.

842
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,664
You're the only one
I'd talk to about this.

843
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,834
You're a good friend, Cory.

844
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:18,382
My wish is...

845
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:20,384
to live in the city

846
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:23,520
because it's so different

847
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:26,256
from what I grew up in.

848
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:31,829
There's so many people there.
It's a place--

849
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:33,330
I don't know.

850
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:37,534
I'd have a freedom
that I've never known.

851
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:40,270
Like I could take chances
with my life

852
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:43,240
and it would be okay
to fail

853
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:48,145
because there's so
many people there that,

854
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:51,015
no one would care
or notice.

855
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:54,184
No one but me.

856
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,622
So why don't you go there?

857
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,925
[laughs]

858
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:05,662
One, money issues.

859
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:07,798
And second...

860
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:14,238
There's so many people,

861
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:17,441
I'm afraid I'd just disappear

862
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:21,278
and no one would care
or notice.

863
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:29,119
Well, why don't we see
what we can do

864
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:33,023
to get you there
and protect you

865
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:35,225
so you don't disappear?

866
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:43,267
- Tom hasn't called?
- Unh-unh.

867
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,370
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

868
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:49,306
You didn't maybe forget
or something, did you?

869
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:51,275
Unh-unh.

870
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:55,679
- Phone never rang?
- Unh-unh.

871
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,883
[sighs] Never rang, he says.

872
01:02:30,214 --> 01:02:32,682
[laughs]

873
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:35,752
God, it's a good thing
I brought my cap along.

874
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:37,587
The sun's right
on top of us.

875
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:39,656
I know.
It's beautiful out.

876
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:41,992
Nothing makes me happier
than a perfect summer's day.

877
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:45,329
Striving to be that word
you just used is gonna
kill you.

878
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:47,531
- You be careful.
- What do you mean?

879
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:51,268
Oh, there's no use trying
to explain, my precious.

880
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:53,137
You'll find out.

881
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,106
Well, what if I don't?
Tell me.

882
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:00,410
Well, let me ask you.
What is happy?

883
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:04,681
Happy is when you
have a warm feeling
in your stomach,

884
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:07,051
when it isn't tied
in knots.

885
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,453
Happy's when you can get out
of bed in the morning.

886
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:12,322
I see.
And you strive for that?

887
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:14,691
- Sure.
- How?

888
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:17,494
I don't know.
I guess I try
to change my life.

889
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:22,099
I see. And in doing so,
do you accomplish happy?

890
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,903
Not necessarily,
but at least I'm
doing something.

891
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:29,706
- Doing something
 as in change?
- Yeah.

892
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:31,641
Let me ask you
another question.

893
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:36,346
Why are you courted by men,
but not in a relationship?

894
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,482
- Why is that?
- [laughs]

895
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:41,351
That's a loaded question
I don't care to answer.

896
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:43,854
- I see.
- You see what?

897
01:03:43,888 --> 01:03:48,192
Do you not question
why you cherish such
unavailable men?

898
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:50,227
Who's unavailable?

899
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:54,331
Perhaps you should
tell me, hmm?

900
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:56,400
I don't follow you.

901
01:03:56,433 --> 01:04:00,037
Let me ask you another
question on a completely
different subject.

902
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,873
Do you like the Beatles?

903
01:04:02,907 --> 01:04:04,474
Yeah, I guess.

904
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,544
Now what do you mean
by "I guess"?

905
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:11,248
- Why wouldn't I?
- Precisely.

906
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:13,150
What would happen
if you said,

907
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,785
"I didn't like the Beatles,
never have and never will."
What would happen?

908
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:17,487
I don't know.
I guess I wouldn't say that.

909
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,324
But what if you genuinely
didn't like the Beatles?

910
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,226
All right then, I'd say it.

911
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:23,660
- You would?
- Yeah.

912
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,795
But you'd feel a bit
apprehensive in saying so

913
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:29,399
because you're supposed
to feel differently,
isn't that right?

914
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:33,237
- You could say that.
- Yes, well,
 I hate the Beatles!

915
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:36,240
I always have
and I always will!

916
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:40,110
And I'll be damned if I won't
let the whole world know it.

917
01:04:40,144 --> 01:04:42,546
If one of their songs
comes on the radio,
I switch it off.

918
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:46,683
And I'd do it in front
of a million people
if the opportunity arose.

919
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,586
Try this one on for size.
I don't like Shakespeare.

920
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,156
I hate Shakespeare!

921
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:56,093
Shakespeare is
profoundly dull!

922
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,164
What do you think?

923
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:01,431
Wow.

924
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:04,334
It's all very simple.

925
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:08,138
Inner rebellion
followed by self triumph

926
01:05:08,172 --> 01:05:10,774
is a gift man was given.

927
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:14,711
If he doesn't use that gift,
he becomes,

928
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,515
as one may say, depressed.

929
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:20,550
And I am correct
in saying this.

930
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:24,888
A depressed man is
an utmost boring man.

931
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:28,092
You're right about that.
But what do Shakespeare
and the Beatles have to do

932
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:30,494
with happy
and my bad choice of men?

933
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:34,298
Relationships are
a reflection of who you are.

934
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:37,767
You, my dear,
are holding in a fight.

935
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:40,670
Find out what you are
rebelling against
and express it.

936
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:43,573
Scream it out loud
if you like. It's okay.

937
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:47,744
Fight. Fight.
Happy has nothing
to do with change.

938
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,747
Fight, fight,
fight, fight.

939
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,417
Or that thing that won't
let you get out of bed

940
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,652
in the morning
is gonna follow you.

941
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:05,529
Time you found out who
or what is following you.

942
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:55,145
Tom.

943
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:05,855
Hello, I'm Mrs. Roscoe.

944
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:32,216
[alarm ringing]

945
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:39,923
[turns off alarm]

946
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:57,907
Fireflies. Whoo!

947
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:01,145
I wanna talk about my obvious
bad choice of men.

948
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,414
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

949
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:07,717
That day in the park
you said some things to
me that I wanna talk about.

950
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,820
You said something about
my choice of men being related

951
01:08:10,854 --> 01:08:13,990
to my happiness
or my unhappiness.

952
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:18,495
Yes, that. May I have
a cup of tea first?

953
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:19,896
No, damn it,
explain yourself.

954
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,299
- All right!
- All right.

955
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,968
What is the question?

956
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:30,140
All right, I admit
I've crashed again.

957
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:35,679
Tom's married.

958
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:37,947
I figured as much.

959
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:40,317
Why didn't you say something?

960
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:42,719
Oh, now, Maggie, really?

961
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:45,021
You would never
have believed me.

962
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,291
Besides, it was
only a hunch.

963
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:49,459
Tell me why you would
have a hunch.

964
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:52,196
Tell me why you say
that I choose bad men.

965
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:55,565
I believe I said
unavailable men, not bad.

966
01:08:55,599 --> 01:09:00,570
I also asked you a question
in that park that day.
Do you remember?

967
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,772
- No. What?
- Think.

968
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:05,575
- I don't know. What?
- I asked you what

969
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:07,043
or who you were
running away from,

970
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,679
which of course inevitably
came along with you

971
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:11,681
when you were trying
to change your life.

972
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:14,284
I don't know. Nothing.

973
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:16,052
Oh. Nothing.

974
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,488
All right. All right.
Nothing.

975
01:09:18,522 --> 01:09:21,024
Fine. You know what?
I don't need you.
I don't need anybody!

976
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:23,493
- You just hold it there,
 young lady.
- What?

977
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:26,730
You're wrong,
and it's about time
you realized it.

978
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:29,866
Okay, you have five seconds
to explain yourself or
I am gonna lose it.

979
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,801
- You do need people.
- I do not.

980
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,504
You do too.
You even need your father.

981
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:38,007
Oh, my father.
My father doesn't even love me.
How can I possibly need the man?

982
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:41,378
You've done a fine job
of convincing yourself
of that, haven't you?

983
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:43,913
But you better convince
yourself otherwise and soon.

984
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:48,452
Every moment you shut yourself
off from people because you
think you don't need them,

985
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,687
you're denying yourself life.

986
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,856
How could you
say that to me?

987
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:55,124
How could you of all people
say that to me, Rachel?

988
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:58,161
You are the definition
of loner.

989
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:02,098
How many people do you need?
Hmm?

990
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:03,867
[sighs]

991
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:07,337
None.

992
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,940
Because there's no one left.

993
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:15,712
I made your mistake.

994
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:18,848
Yeah, but you made it
for a reason.

995
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,650
So what was it?

996
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:23,753
We all have secrets.

997
01:10:25,489 --> 01:10:27,957
It's only now that I can see

998
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:32,128
that I repelled
so many relationships

999
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:35,499
in my life that I should
have cherished.

1000
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:38,167
Yeah, well,

1001
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:41,405
I'm not rejecting any
relationships worth having.

1002
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:44,774
- So I guess I'm doing okay.
- Maybe not.

1003
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:48,845
But you are involving
yourself with people
who are incapable

1004
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:50,480
of fulfilling your needs.

1005
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:52,916
Your father loves you!

1006
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,918
It's humanly impossible
that he doesn't.

1007
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:57,421
If you deny yourself
that relationship,

1008
01:10:57,454 --> 01:11:00,757
you deny all relationships.
Can't you see that?

1009
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,795
So you're saying
that my father

1010
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:09,699
is the one
that's following me.

1011
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:12,402
Make peace.

1012
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:16,340
Make peace now

1013
01:11:16,373 --> 01:11:19,476
before another Tom.

1014
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:38,795
Hey, Maggie.

1015
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:40,964
Well, why didn't
you just come in?

1016
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:44,300
I didn't wanna get shot at.

1017
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:47,103
Get in here.

1018
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,340
Hey, I haven't seen
a Pirates hat

1019
01:11:50,374 --> 01:11:53,910
since I was in high school.
Where'd you come across one?

1020
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:56,780
Yeah, well, you know,

1021
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,448
Willie's kid's
on a baseball team,

1022
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:02,952
and I was just on my way
to a game tonight,

1023
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,521
as a matter of fact.

1024
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:06,756
Really?

1025
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:09,192
But I mean,
I'll cancel, though.

1026
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:13,863
I mean,
I've got company, right?

1027
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:16,833
No, there's no need
to do that.

1028
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:18,935
I'll go with you,
if you don't mind.

1029
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:21,371
Really? I think
you'll like it.

1030
01:12:21,405 --> 01:12:24,207
The kid's pretty good,
and the team if they
win tonight,

1031
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,742
they're gonna be
in the playoffs.

1032
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:28,077
First time
in the school's history.

1033
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:31,881
Sounds like a lot of fun.

1034
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:34,150
So how's everything going?

1035
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:37,921
Oh, you know, fine.

1036
01:12:39,389 --> 01:12:41,057
Nothing special.

1037
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:45,294
How are you doing?

1038
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,330
Fine.

1039
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:52,135
Good.

1040
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:54,370
You couldn't have come
at a more perfect time.

1041
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:58,608
The game starts in less
than an hour and I think
you're gonna enjoy this.

1042
01:12:58,642 --> 01:13:02,011
- Are you comfortable
 with what you're wearing?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1043
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:05,181
Okay, well, I'm gonna
grab a jacket, okay?

1044
01:13:09,953 --> 01:13:12,989
So you never came
to any of my things.

1045
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:25,502
You know, I always meant to, but
it seems like something always--

1046
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:28,672
Always came up.

1047
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:31,107
Like what?

1048
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,443
Oh, well...

1049
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,080
I can't remember.

1050
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:41,851
Well, I'm asking you
to remember.

1051
01:13:41,885 --> 01:13:44,488
What came up?

1052
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,859
I don't know.

1053
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:52,361
Okay, I'm ready.

1054
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:10,346
You know, Maggie,
I don't know what to say.

1055
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,281
All I can tell you
is I haven't

1056
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:15,585
and I can't be
who you want me to be.

1057
01:14:22,526 --> 01:14:24,127
I wanna go home now.

1058
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:34,771
- Why don't you stay
 a little longer?
- Why?

1059
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:37,206
Well, it hasn't been
much of a visit so far,

1060
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,744
so we should at least try
and reach adequate, huh?

1061
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,315
You hungry?

1062
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:50,053
- Yeah, I could eat.
- Well, come on.

1063
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:55,559
So what are you eating
these days?

1064
01:14:55,592 --> 01:14:58,928
- Is that an indication?
- You're gonna die
 of malnutrition.

1065
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:00,897
Well, it's a good thing
I stopped growing, huh?

1066
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:04,868
- Have you?
- Well, not that way.
 [laughs]

1067
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:07,136
- Ah! Spaghetti.
- Yeah.

1068
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,106
So what are the odds
of finding a jar of sauce?

1069
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:17,647
- Ta-da!
- What do you know?

1070
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,082
Yeah.

1071
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:33,563
So...

1072
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:37,701
I saw mom.

1073
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:41,971
Yeah, she was only there
for a moment.

1074
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:44,107
I want to talk
to her so badly.

1075
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,276
There's so much to say.

1076
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:50,179
But she didn't hang
around long enough.

1077
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,882
It was good to
see her, though.

1078
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:54,684
I could even smell her.

1079
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:03,660
Tell me, how's this roommate
of yours, huh?

1080
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:07,797
Do you ever talk to her?

1081
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:12,068
I don't wanna
talk about her.

1082
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:16,239
Why not?

1083
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:19,108
I don't wanna talk
about it.

1084
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,379
Really, well, what do
you want to talk about?

1085
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,115
Well, how's your
singing going?

1086
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:27,583
- My singing?
- Yeah.

1087
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:29,452
You don't care!
You remember that?

1088
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:34,691
God, you never
talk about her.

1089
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:36,860
It's like you want
to pretend she didn't exist.

1090
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:39,162
You know, that she's some secret
that you're ashamed of.

1091
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:40,697
She was my mother,
for God's sake.

1092
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,866
How dare you say
that I was ashamed of her.

1093
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:45,468
She wasn't only your mother.
She was also my wife,

1094
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:47,236
the woman I loved
for 15 years,

1095
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:50,206
the woman I thanked God
every day for having
in my life.

1096
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:54,811
And I don't talk about her
because it makes me sick
to my goddamn stomach

1097
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:58,214
just to think of how
she was taken from me.

1098
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:00,616
Not you, me!

1099
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:06,856
There are other memories.

1100
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:09,625
Oh, are there?

1101
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:12,261
God, I hope so.

1102
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,230
You wanna reminisce?
Okay, fine.

1103
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:17,366
Come on, tell me a story.
Let's talk about Mommy
and the memories.

1104
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,902
- Come on.
- You're so angry.

1105
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:22,171
Come on, you wanna talk.
What do you remember?

1106
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:27,777
[father] 
 Do you remember 
 holding her in your arms,

1107
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:29,979
helpless not being 
 able to wake her?

1108
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:33,582
How about watching
the stillness on her face
as she stopped breathing?

1109
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:35,952
You said you 
 remember her scent. Tell me...

1110
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:38,654
Did you smell her blood, 
 the dirt on the ground 
 she died on?

1111
01:17:38,688 --> 01:17:41,257
- Stop it!
- Isn't this what you want
 to talk about,

1112
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:45,061
or do you want to talk
about what caused her death?
That sounds like fun!

1113
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:49,799
Let's talk about a certain
selfish little girl who
just had to have her way.

1114
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:51,034
How can you say this?

1115
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:54,771
She had to see that pony,
that miserable brown pony.

1116
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:57,106
Damn you!

1117
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,843
Oh, my God.

1118
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:02,445
You were saying it to me.

1119
01:18:02,478 --> 01:18:05,014
I told you not
to go back there.

1120
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:07,483
You didn't listen to me.

1121
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:10,386
Why did you disobey me?
That was very bad of you.

1122
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,089
When daddy says no,
he means no!

1123
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:15,424
[crying]

1124
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:25,334
Why did you wander off?

1125
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,971
Why didn't you listen to me?

1126
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:39,015
Oh, God, please forgive me.

1127
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:42,418
Hey, it wasn't your fault.

1128
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:45,321
It wasn't your fault.

1129
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:49,292
I'm the one to blame.
I should have been there.

1130
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:53,229
It was me that wandered off.

1131
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:04,407
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Maggie.

1132
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,509
I'm sorry.

1133
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,950
[laughs]

1134
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:45,748
Lovely as ever.

1135
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,057
Best seat in the house.

1136
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:15,411
This one's for you.

1137

[big band music playing]

1138
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:23,752
Remember it?

1139
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,963
I respected your opinion then
and I still do.

1140
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:37,400
You always said more charm
can come out of a man's feet

1141
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:40,569
than out of his mouth.
[laughs]

1142
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:46,342
I appreciate your thoughts,
however implausible,

1143
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,945
they occasionally agree.

1144
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:00,289
Here it comes.

1145
01:21:00,323 --> 01:21:02,758
- [shouts]
- [music continuing]

1146
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:11,867
Baby, take it in.

1147
01:21:11,901 --> 01:21:13,836
Take it all in!

1148
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:44,968
I am not to be disturbed
during dance hour!

1149
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:54,610
[knock on door]

1150
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:58,181
Go away!

- [song ends]  
- [cheers and applause]

1154
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,030
What took you so long?

1155
01:23:21,064 --> 01:23:23,266
What's wrong?

1156
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:28,437
I don't feel so hot.

1157
01:23:28,471 --> 01:23:30,839
Okay, well,
I'll go call somebody.

1158
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:32,675
No, no!

1159
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:36,645
No, I don't wanna die
with strangers.

1160
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:40,083
- Please.
- What are you talking about?

1161
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,786
Okay.

1162
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:49,192
- [wheezes]
- Were you dancing?

1163
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:50,926
[laughs]

1164
01:23:53,929 --> 01:23:55,664
Yeah.

1165
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:01,036
- I was dancing.
- Yeah.

1166
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:09,945
You mended your heart.

1167
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:16,152
That took a lot
of courage

1168
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:18,187
to do that.

1169
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:25,161
Come here. Come on.

1170
01:24:29,298 --> 01:24:31,700
It's okay. It's okay.

1171
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,045
I owe it all to you.

1172
01:24:45,648 --> 01:24:47,883
You mean the world to me.

1173
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:53,021
Thank you for your
loving friendship.

1174
01:24:53,055 --> 01:24:54,323
Thank you.

1175
01:24:55,491 --> 01:24:57,726
Thank you.

1176
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:09,705
Don't worry.
Don't worry about me.

1177

The angels will
take care of things.

If ever you need me...

1179
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,088
I'll be right there.

1180
01:25:28,357 --> 01:25:29,958
Right there.

Rachel. Rachel.

1186
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:20,676
Dear Mom,

1187
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:22,278
Rachel passed away.

1188
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:26,014
We laid him 
 to rest next to you.

1189
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:31,754
That crazy old man 
 changed my life forever.

1190
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:47,603
- Hi.
- Hi.

1191
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:49,772
Peace.

1192
01:26:51,006 --> 01:26:52,775
- Hi.
- Hi.

1193
01:26:56,979 --> 01:27:00,916
So I brought you back
your hat I tried

1194
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:02,518
to return
to you once before,

1195
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:05,988
and I wasn't successful
so...

1196
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:12,528
- All right.
- [laughs]

1197
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:14,497
So thanks for coming.

1198
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:18,534
Yeah, this has been a rough
week for you. You okay?
How are you doing?

1199
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:20,102
I'm okay.

1200
01:27:22,338 --> 01:27:23,872
I'm--

1201
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:26,775
I'm heading out of town.

1202
01:27:26,809 --> 01:27:28,944
I'm moving to the city.

1203
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,847
It's a big deal for me.

1204
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,884
Wow. That's great.
You're gonna make a shot
at this. That's good.

1205
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:39,322
Yeah, it's time.

1206
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:41,424
We just made up.

1207
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:45,928
So when are you going?

1208
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,897
Today.

1209
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:02,311
I'm gonna miss you both
so much.

1210
01:28:02,345 --> 01:28:05,781
Yeah, well...

1211
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:19,828
- Cram it.
- You know what? 
 Can I have some "cram it"?

1212
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:21,129
Waitress.

1213
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:31,640
Dear Mom, 
 I'm on my way.

1214
01:28:31,674 --> 01:28:35,944
This will be the last letter 
 I ever write to you.

1215
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,446
And what I wanna say 
 above all

1216
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,148
is that if it's 
 you or Rachel

1217
01:28:40,182 --> 01:28:44,420
or simply fate taking me down 
 this new road,

1218
01:28:45,888 --> 01:28:47,189
thank you.

1219
01:28:49,692 --> 01:28:53,429
PS-- there's one more thing.

1220
01:28:55,864 --> 01:29:00,035
[rock music playing]

1221
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:02,170
* Get into my car

1222
01:29:02,204 --> 01:29:04,640
* Hammer down and I'll be

1223
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:07,209
* Right between your arms

1224
01:29:07,242 --> 01:29:11,113
* Driving down to London

1225
01:29:12,415 --> 01:29:16,385
* And if you dream,
see me by the fire *

1226
01:29:16,419 --> 01:29:20,856
* Driving down to London

1227
01:29:23,759 --> 01:29:26,294
* God will understand...

1228
01:29:33,135 --> 01:29:35,337
* Get into my car

1229
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,006
* Hammer down and I'll be

1230
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,275
* Right between your arms

1231
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:44,513
* Driving down to London

1232
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:50,118
* And if you dream,
see me by the fires *

1233
01:29:50,152 --> 01:29:54,156
* Driving down to London

1234
01:29:55,524 --> 01:29:59,462
* And I'll be right
between your arms *

1235
01:29:59,495 --> 01:30:03,599
* Driving down to London *

1236
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,076
[cheers and applause]

1237
01:30:30,192 --> 01:30:33,629
* There's a lover 
 in my life *

1238
01:30:33,662 --> 01:30:38,366
* He sends me, 
 he gives some flowers *

1239
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,204
* He'd change 
 a thousand clocks *

1240
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:45,541
* To meet me after hours

1241
01:30:45,574 --> 01:30:49,277
* He's crazy

1242
01:30:49,311 --> 01:30:51,947
* Yeah, he's crazy

1243
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:57,085
* About our love

1244
01:31:00,222 --> 01:31:03,391
* Whoa-oh!

1245
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:05,728
* This love in my life

1246
01:31:08,564 --> 01:31:12,568
* I know he's there for me

1247
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:15,604
* He'd climb the highest peak

1248
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:20,142
* And he'd swim  
 the widest sea *

1249
01:31:20,175 --> 01:31:23,812
* He's so crazy

1250
01:31:23,846 --> 01:31:27,249
* Yeah, he's crazy

1251
01:31:27,282 --> 01:31:31,019
* About our love

1252
01:31:35,123 --> 01:31:37,292
* Whoa-oh!

1253
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:41,764
* But this lover in my life

1254
01:31:41,797 --> 01:31:43,431
* Said to me

1255
01:31:43,465 --> 01:31:47,670
* Something here was wrong

1256
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:51,173
* I love you just too much, 
 just too much *

1257
01:31:51,206 --> 01:31:55,410
* I'd forgotten my own song

1258
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:59,181
* 'Cause I'm crazy

1259
01:31:59,214 --> 01:32:01,817
* I'm just too crazy

1260
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:06,789
* About our love

1261
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,302
[vocalizing]

1262
01:32:25,941 --> 01:32:29,244
* Whoa!

1263
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:31,279
* Oh, yeah

1264
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:40,723
* Yeah, yeah

1265
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,963
* Whoa-oh!

1266
01:32:47,996 --> 01:32:52,134
* So this love of my life

1267
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:55,370
* Went away somewhere new

1268
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:00,676
* My heart was broken

1269
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:03,411
* When I found 
 that this was true **
