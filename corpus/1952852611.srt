1
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:22,229
Girl: <i>a couple of months ago,</i>
<i>I was happy and carefree</i>

2
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:25,332
<i>and full of</i>
<i>hope... comparatively.</i>

3
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:28,903
<i>I was secretly dating</i>
<i>the most popular guy in school.</i>

4
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:32,139
Nice print.

5
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,178
Check it out.

6
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,247
Hey, Rena! Where'd you get
that snappy outfit,

7
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,983
lost and found?

8
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:43,084
Funny.

9
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,619
How much wide-mouth
suburban trash

10
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,921
does it take to screw in
a light bulb?

11
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:48,422
How much?

12
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:50,157
If you don't know,
nobody does.

13
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,426
Where do you get off
calling us trash?

14
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:00,868
<i>If you'd like to make a call,</i>
<i>please hang up and try again.</i>

15
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,270
Hurry up before
someone sees.

16
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:04,405
Hey, Kenton.

17
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:05,840
You know the rule.

18
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:06,975
I know.

19
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:08,109
Stay put.

20
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:13,280
Hi!

21
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:14,348
Stay down.

22
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,750
I know.

23
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:20,321
It's nice here,
don't you think?

24
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:21,656
It's better
than the car.

25
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:22,890
Oh, yeah.

26
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:26,460
I can't do anything
today, Kenton.

27
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:27,695
What do you mean?

28
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:32,967
Look... do you wanna
come to dinner with us?

29
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:35,937
It doesn't have to be
anywhere public.

30
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,873
It can just be
at our house, right?

31
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,675
Wait here.

32
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,721
(car door opens, closes)

33
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:59,193
(engine starts,
car drives away)

34
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,705
<i>Kenton and me had us</i>
<i>a real unusual relationship.</i>

35
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:12,840
<i>He summed it up once</i>
<i>by saying,</i>

36
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:14,142
<i>"put out or get out."</i>

37
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:18,946
<i>So I decided to get out.</i>

38
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:37,364
<i>Mama says that the road to hell</i>
<i>is paved with good intentions.</i>

39
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:40,001
<i>I was barreling</i>
<i>down the express lane.</i>

40
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:43,504
<i>And i sure as hell never saw</i>
<i>any damn exit ramps, either.</i>

41
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:45,606
<i>So I started to try</i>
<i>and construct</i>

42
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,108
<i>my own exit ramps.</i>

43
00:03:57,452 --> 00:04:01,522
<i>So much is missin'</i>
<i>with daddy missin'.</i>

44
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:06,594
<i>I wonder who's gonna miss me</i>
<i>when I go missin'.</i>

45
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:34,521
<i>Mama married daddy forever,</i>
<i>until death do them part.</i>

46
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:37,291
<i>Ironically, that obligation</i>
<i>was killing her.</i>

47
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:45,432
Rena jo Grubb,
what the hell are you doin'?

48
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:49,737
Dying a slow and torturous
death.

49
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,439
Baby, I've been doing that
for the last five years.

50
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:54,275
You hear anything
about your brother?

51
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:57,111
He'll be home tonight, mama.
Don't worry.

52
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:59,914
Honey, get dressed.
I'll bet he's grown a foot.

53
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,582
Hope y'all recognize him.

54
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:06,353
<i>Hey, boys and girls,</i>
<i>moms and dads,</i>

55
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:08,256
<i>come on down</i>
<i>to fun fun city</i>

56
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:12,927
<i>with rides, attractions,</i>
<i>amusements, and candy...</i>

57
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,695
you better come in here
and do the dishes.

58
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,363
Mama wants things nice.

59
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:22,170
'Cause Jay's coming home.
So exciting...

60
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:27,241
you got any idea why
your sister's in that pool

61
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,409
like some mental patient?

62
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,511
What are you doin' out there?

63
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,256
Shit!

64
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,928
Do they bite right in here?

65
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:53,234
Uncle arno!
I got a...

66
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:59,106
thanks, uncle arno,
for taking me fishin',

67
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:03,477
letting me tinker on the bikes
and stuff.

68
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,946
Don't you go changin'.

69
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,484
That was the longest
four weeks of my life.

70
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,619
It's a lot like
being with daddy,

71
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:15,223
only he's a lot slower
and don't hit quite as hard.

72
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,596
Hey, Rena.

73
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:25,032
Welcome home, sissy boy.

74
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,280
Don't get up.

75
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,692
Mom.

76
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,896
Jay!

77
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:58,232
Baby.

78
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:02,736
It is so good
to see you!

79
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:05,406
Oh, my goodness,
you grew.

80
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,841
Did you like fishing
with your uncle arno?

81
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,043
It was okay.

82
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,544
Yeah? Did you catch
anything?

83
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:13,014
I don't know.
Does he have anything?

84
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,516
You...

85
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,518
(laughing)

86
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:20,454
I'm gonna go change.

87
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:21,755
Okay.

88
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:26,327
Rena, get your butt in here!

89
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,861
Your skin's
gonna get all pruney.

90
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:30,231
Honey, your daddy
sent you another postcard.

91
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:34,235
Don't you even think about
tracking that mud in here.

92
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:36,637
Jay, get your sister a towel.

93
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,838
Jay!

94
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,742
Whatever, whatever.
Just give me this.

95
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:53,687

105
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,251
christ, he was
only three trailers away.

106
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,853
Try eight.

107
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,990
I know, but we missed
our little baby boy.

108
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:31,258
So long as we're celebratin'
and everything...

109
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,560
are we gonna go
to daddy's picnic?

110
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,067
What picnic is that, honey?

111
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:46,140
The one they have every year.
The picnic.

112
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,775
You know, I think
it's the last weekend in june.

113
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:56,283
The annual picnic they have
every year in june, mama.

114
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,285
Honey, I probably
have to work that day.

115
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,087
It's been eight years.

116
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,756
I think it's important that
we go and see him sometimes.

117
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:03,824
We're not going.

118
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,326
I damn sure am not going.

119
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:06,927
Mama, I think we should go.

120
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:10,197
Please?

121
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:11,499
I'll think about it.

122
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:14,635
Yeah, well, don't hurt yourself,
all right?

123
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,770
I hate it when you think
about things.

124
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:18,072
It always means "no."

125
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:27,281
I wrote him sayin' we'd go,
so he's expectin' us.

126
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,720
Did he mention the picnic
in his postcard?

127
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,357
No.

128
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,025
Interesting.

129
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:48,001
Mornin', faye.

130
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,171
Morning, madge.

131
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,542
Your garden is lookin' so nice.
I've been meaning to tell you.

132
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,444
What do you want, madge?

133
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:02,516
I've been thinking about takin'
the kids to see John.

134
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,585
You think that's a good idea?

135
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:07,988
I think it's a dreadful idea.

136
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,523
But you should take Rena.

137
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,160
She needs to meet
the son of a bitch.

138
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:16,730
Right.

139
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,801
Okay, faye, thanks.
You have a nice day now. Okay.

140
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:22,303
Yeah.
Okay.

141
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:32,946
So we going?

142
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:38,185
I don't know.
What do you think?

143
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:39,753
I think it's a bad idea.

144
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:44,258
Well, I've still got a month
to get used to it.

145
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:47,661
You hungry?

146
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,062
Hm-mm.

147
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:50,697
Here.

148
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:51,932
All right.

149
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:55,636
Good night.

150
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:57,138
Night, baby.

151
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:05,613
<i>"And slippery, slippery sam,</i>

152
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:09,484
<i>he fell upon the ham."</i>

153
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:11,319
<i>It's bedtime now,</i>
<i>all right, Rena?</i>

154
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,554
<i>Your daddy loves you, okay?</i>

155
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:21,662
Morning, faye.

156
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,835
You know what I realized?

157
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:31,105
Our problems come
from not havin' a daddy around.

158
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,508
Everything sucks
'cause he's not around.

159
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,943
Why don't we just
go and see him?

160
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,645
It's not like
he's dead or nothin'.

161
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:41,249
Especially since we practically
have ourselves an invitation.

162
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,486
I know he thinks about us.

163
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,955
I have every single postcard
he's ever sent me.

164
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:53,994
I thought I heard you
babbling away.

165
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,364
Want some cookies, hon?

166
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:57,998
No, that's okay.

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,836
But I made you... a rose.

168
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:06,073
I know you don't like
to pick yours, so...

169
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:08,176
how lovely.

170
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:10,478
I need it back, though, okay?

171
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,945
You know, Rena...

172
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:16,517
i think it is time
you did see your daddy.

173
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,053
You think so?

174
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:20,154
Uh-huh.

175
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:23,591
Yeah, I think so, too.

176
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:30,864
Hey, mama.
I brought you this.

177
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:33,634
Thank you, Rena.
What do you want?

178
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:36,204
Do you ever think that maybe
daddy doesn't do anything

179
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,871
because we never
tell him nothin'?

180
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:41,775
Five minutes
of peace, please.

181
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:44,612
Well, I think he deserves
a chance to be a daddy.

182
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:47,548
Baby, sometimes I think

183
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,150
you don't remember
your daddy so good.

184
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:52,052
There's not that much
to remember.

185
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,955
A kiss on the cheek,
a bedtime story...

186
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:59,560
i just really
want to go, mama.

187
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:02,830
What is so important about
this damn picnic this year?

188
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:05,065
Because it is!

189
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,734
He's my dad!

190
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:10,404
Mama, please!
I really wanna go.

191
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,873
Mama, please!

192
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,908
Okay, we'll go.

193
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,648
Okay, honey.

194
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,553
Will you go get me
a beer, please?

195
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,024
(delighted shriek)

196
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,868
Hurry up,
before someone sees.

197
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,870
Hey.

198
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:44,872
You know the rule.

199
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:46,006
I know.

200
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:47,841
Stay put.
I'm stayin'.

201
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:53,981
(rap music plays
on radio)

202
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,364
Knock, knock.

203
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
What do you want?

204
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,002
Baby, i said,
"knock, knock."

205
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:20,107
How do you feel
about goin' to see your daddy?

206
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,043
I don't know.

207
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,813
It might be a good idea
for us all to go and see him.

208
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:28,248
I mean, is it something
you wanna do,

209
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,083
or do you wanna
talk about...

210
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:31,552
I'll go.

211
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:35,456
Okay, we might have fun.
I don't know.

212
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,726
I'll be home after 6:00.
Why are you so sweaty?

213
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:40,461
It's hot in here.

214
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:51,205
Hey, you ever think about
goin' to the magic kingdom?

215
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,608
Not particularly.

216
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,345
I bet it's just about
the happiest place on earth.

217
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:58,746
Yeah, that's why
they call it

218
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:00,414
"the happiest place
on earth," mom.

219
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,151
I sure wish we could go there
instead of to see your daddy.

220
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,286
You're not really thinking
about going there, are you?

221
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,123
Rena wants to go.

222
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,925
I wanna win the lotto, so...

223
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:13,828
here, you want some?

224
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,963
No, no, no.

225
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:18,432
I missed my last
couple of visits.

226
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:24,271
The time there,
it's not so bad,

227
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:27,207
but it takes my soul
a day or two to recover.

228
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:32,413
You know how things is.

229
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:34,815
Yeah, I know how things is.

230
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,223
Barbie, I'm not gonna
make you go, but...

231
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,827
your daddy
sure would like it.

232
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,061
He always loved you.

233
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:49,530
I know.

234
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,331
Just like you
was one of his own.

235
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:54,402
Yeah.

236
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,905
So what do you say?

237
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,709
I guess I will if I have to.

238
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,278
Didn't I just say
you didn't have to?

239
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,624
Come on, hurry up!

240
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:19,527
I have to go,
and I have to go now!

241
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:21,228
(coughing)

242
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,501
What's going on in there?

243
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:33,273
What?

244
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:35,208
What's going on?

245
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,380
Yeah, I'm just feeli"
pukey is all.

246
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,349
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

247
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,752
What kind of pukey?

248
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,556
I don't know.
I'm just sick, i guess.

249
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:49,924
Uh-huh.

250
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,259
You know what I'm thinking?

251
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,695
I'm thinking you shouldn't
be expecting to see

252
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:57,465
your ruby slippers
any time soon.

253
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,901
I don't know what
you're talking about.

254
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:02,302
Who's the daddy, Rena?

255
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,071
What are you going on for?

256
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,840
Just tell me
who the daddy is.

257
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:06,941
Who is he?

258
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,909
What are you
going on about?

259
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:12,446
Mama's gonna
just about shit.

260
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,782
Mama's got no reason
to shit, all right?

261
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,119
She was 15 when she had you.

262
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,155
Right.

263
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:27,060
Barbie, I need you for this once
just to be my friend.

264
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,333
Daddy's gonna be so proud
of his little slut.

265
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:41,241
I've got a heart murmur,
you know!

266
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,810
(laughs derisively)

267
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,111
What?

268
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,346
I do.
What are you lookin' at?

269
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,181
Bitch.

270
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:56,189
<i>The news of an unexpected baby</i>

271
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,492
<i>can have a powerful effect</i>
<i>on people.</i>

272
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,961
<i>I couldn't wait to share</i>
<i>the good news with its daddy.</i>

273
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,033
<i>Hey, this is Kenton.</i>

274
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:09,036
<i>Leave me a message,</i>
<i>maybe I'll call you back.</i>

275
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:33,360
If you're gonna
have a baby,

276
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,096
you need to start wearin' shoes
around the house,

277
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,230
brushin' your teeth.

278
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:38,832
I'm not gonna
be shacked up

279
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,500
with some <i>Jerry Springer</i>
contestant...

280
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:41,902
"babies having babies.

281
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:45,105
Let's ask the audience
what they think."

282
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:48,842
You gonna keep it?

283
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:52,479
Yeah, i want to.

284
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,915
I mean, if mama
lets me, that is.

285
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,083
I'd like to.

286
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,853
Was uncle arno's any fun?

287
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,824
Must be nice to travel...

288
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:05,158
who's the baby's daddy?

289
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:08,228
It doesn't matter.

290
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,830
It might matter to mama.

291
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,066
She'll wanna make sure
it's not like

292
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,568
that one-legged chinaman
who mops up the...

293
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,904
don't say "chinaman,"
all right? Say "chinaperson."

294
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,974
The dad's something
special, Jay.

295
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:23,110
Therefore, I figure this baby
has at least half a chance

296
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:25,378
of bein' something special,
too, you know?

297
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,821
She's not gonna hit you.

298
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:35,923
Mama's a screamer,
not a fighter.

299
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:52,272
Hey, baby.

300
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:55,542
So, guess what.

301
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,177
What?

302
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,748
I gotta pee, honey.
I gotta pee, hold on.

303
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,584
Wait, wait. I'm gonna go in
and soak up the first wave.

304
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:07,988
If Barbie comes out,
just hit her or something.

305
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,089
Okay?

306
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:15,929
Mom?

307
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,078
Run!

308
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,612
Where the hell is she?

309
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,048
I don't know.

310
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,051
Rena!
Rena, you better run!

311
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,319
You and I are gonna
have a long talk about this

312
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,788
tomorrow morning, missy.

313
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,089
And you are damn lucky

314
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,924
I'm too tired
to fight with you anymore tonight.

315
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,860
Can we still go
and see daddy?

316
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,996
Goddamn it, Rena!

317
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,631
You think we're gonna
tell your daddy about this?

318
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,167
Look, I just thought that...

319
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,968
you thought?

320
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,437
If you'd been thinking, Rena,
you wouldn't be in this mess!

321
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:00,007
Don't hurt yourself thinking,
sweetie!

322
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,442
Yeah, well, he might
be happy, you know?

323
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:05,579
Havin' a grandbaby
and all.

324
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,715
We won't know
till we ask.

325
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:13,486
(sobbing)

326
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:28,728
I didn't use
a stomach pump

327
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,264
because your daughter
is pregnant.

328
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,099
We just had
to force fluids

329
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,767
in order to flush out
those vitamins.

330
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,235
Chewy-chews.

331
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:36,503
Yeah.

332
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:37,737
Well, lucky for you,

333
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:39,472
children's vitamins
are non-toxic.

334
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,911
Do you have any idea
why she took that many?

335
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:46,346
I think she thought they were
good for the baby.

336
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:47,480
That's smart.

337
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:49,016
Well, they are,
aren't they?

338
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:51,919
Yes, in moderation.

339
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:54,955
I'm gonna talk to her
about cutting back on those.

340
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,489
All right,
you do that.

341
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:57,858
Okay.

342
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,434
48, 49, 50.

343
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:10,871
Yeah! Look at that. Ooh!

344
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:14,842
Hey, your mama comin'
this year?

345
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:17,077
No, she ain't never comin'.

346
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,213
She in san antone
with my sister and her kids.

347
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:20,647
You can eat with us, then.

348
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,717
I don't wanna horn in
on your family time, John.

349
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,518
My daughter's comin'.

350
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,521
Hey, now, you never told me
you had a daughter. How old?

351
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:32,159
A couple years younger
than the boy.
Teenage-something.

352
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,927
Teenage-something?

353
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:36,463
Well, maybe I will.

354
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:40,234
All right, I'll
finish up work.

355
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:42,369
You're lookin' good, John.

356
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:44,037
One, two, three...

357
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,772
<i>delicioso.</i>

358
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:46,940
Yeah.

359
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,747
Jay, we should bring those
bottle rockets you been savin'.

360
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:56,816
Mama, it says no explosives
of any kind right here.

361
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:58,218
It does not say that.

362
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,920
Mama, read it.
It says it right there.

363
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:02,990
That is just
the stupidest thing I ever heard.

364
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,824
Bottle rockets
never hurt nobody.

365
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:07,861
Actually, I saw uncle arno
blow up a cat's butt

366
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,197
with a bottle rocket once.

367
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,632
When are you kids
gonna stop telling tales

368
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:13,867
about uncle arno?

369
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,869
"Uncle arno
tried to feel Rena up,

370
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,038
"uncle arno
tried to slip me the tongue,

371
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,908
uncle arno is having sex
with the neighbor's dog."

372
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,175
I mean, jesus.

373
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:23,510
That one i saw.

374
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:25,345
I like uncle arno.

375
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:27,981
One day you kids are not gonna
have me and uncle arno

376
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:29,349
to blame everything on.

377
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:31,818
Mama, it says no whole chicken.

378
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,054
What? Why not?

379
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,222
I don't know,

380
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,157
perhaps it's
a vegetarian institute.

381
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,293
Well, that's
the stupidest thing I ever heard.

382
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,727
We're taking it.

383
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:45,865
All right.

384
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:47,600
We're good.

385
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:53,873
¶ I'm running free ¶

386
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,842
¶ I'm falling down ¶

387
00:24:55,844 --> 00:25:01,081
¶ I'm looking for
a little direction ¶

388
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,450
¶ I'm walking tall ¶

389
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:06,686
¶ I'm looking fine ¶

390
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:12,392
¶ but feeling so far
from perfection ¶

391
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:18,598
¶ hey, but that's okay ¶

392
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,733
junior, can you do anything
with this?

393
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:21,901
I don't know.

394
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:29,343
Honey, honey, honey...

395
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,383
god, it looks like
it's gonna explode or something.

396
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:38,651
Should we wake up Barbie?

397
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:45,592
It's the radiator.

398
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,164
Let's go over everything

399
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,600
not to upset
your daddy with, okay?

400
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:55,135
All right, don't tell daddy

401
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,669
i dropped out
of high school again.

402
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:58,505
Don't tell daddy
that Jay junior

403
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:00,773
lost his box boy job
at the kroger.

404
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:02,909
Don't tell daddy
about the two koreans

405
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:04,577
that moved in
across the way.

406
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:07,614
Tell daddy that I'm plannin'
to go to beauty school.

407
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:08,982
That'll be happy.

408
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,217
Click your heels, Rena.

409
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:12,219
Maybe the wizard
will send us home.

410
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:13,453
Maybe he'll grant me a brain

411
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,722
so I have the good sense
to stay home next time.

412
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:18,091
Come on, you guys.
Let's hurry.

413
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,230
Jay: Don't ask daddy why he
got passed up for parole again.

414
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:38,678
Barbie: Don't tell daddy
about that queer boy

415
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,049
Jay used to run
around with.

416
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,017
And above all...

417
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,353
Jay: Don't tell dad
you're gonna have a damn baby.

418
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,788
Just remember that.

419
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:52,092
Your dad's gonna have
a real nice day.

420
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:53,460
Hi.

421
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,131
All set, thanks.

422
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,699
Hey.
Hey.

423
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,334
Good to see you again.

424
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,835
Who, me?

425
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:05,772
I haven't been here in...
what is it, mama, three years?

426
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:08,108
Yeah, about that.

427
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,110
No, I swear you were
just here last week.

428
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:12,245
I must look like
somebody on tv.

429
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:13,713
No, I never forget a face.

430
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:19,819
Damn, it's the chicken.

431
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:21,621
I hope we don't
get arrested.

432
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:24,424
No whole poultry.
Regulations.

433
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:26,259
How come?

434
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,795
The bones can be carved
into weapons and such.

435
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:30,630
With your permission,
I'll send this

436
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,532
over to the guards
in the tower.

437
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:35,402
Are we gonna get
our bowl back?

438
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,836
See me on the way out.

439
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,638
Hey, welcome back.

440
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:43,210
Are we good?
All right, let's go.

441
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:45,612
Enjoy the picnic now.

442
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:46,946
Thank you.

443
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:48,014
You see 'em yet?

444
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,582
Not yet.

445
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,050
You sure they comin'?

446
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:52,551
I don't know.

447
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:04,530
Mother: I want you to behave 
yourself. Make your father proud.

448
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:06,632
We're Grubbs.
You know what that means.

449
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:09,169
What, we crawl on our bellies
and eat the dead?

450
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:10,303
Jay!

451
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:11,237
Say "picnic."

452
00:28:12,606 --> 00:28:15,141
Stop wasting
that film on those criminals.

453
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:16,409
And could you
smile, please?

454
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:17,944
I don't feel like smiling.

455
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,513
You'd better smile
for your father, goddamn it.

456
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:25,418
Barbie, I don't want you
flirting with those guards.

457
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,787
This picnic only comes
once a year.

458
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,289
As long as we're here,

459
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,957
we should try
and make it nice for him.

460
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,491
That man is your namesake.

461
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:34,393
I don't care how many
consecutive life terms he gets,

462
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:36,595
he's always
gonna be your father.
I want you to remember that.

463
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:38,664
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to recognize daddy.

464
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,666
You better hope
he doesn't recognize

465
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,001
that special glow of yours.

466
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:43,669
There he is.
There he is. John!

467
00:28:45,272 --> 00:28:46,772
I don't even
look pregnant.

468
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:54,981
Girls! Girls, girls, girls!

469
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,786
Oh, yeah!
Come on, baby!

470
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:02,155
Come on!

471
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,256
Ah, yeah!

472
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:10,796
<i>Daddy had some spell</i>
<i>over mama.</i>

473
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:12,332
<i>She was aware of it,</i>

474
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,533
<i>but what could she do?</i>
<i>She loved him.</i>

475
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:18,137
<i>It's a thin line, I guess,</i>
<i>between love and resentment.</i>

476
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:20,706
<i>The important thing was</i>
<i>we were a family once again.</i>

477
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:25,678
Jesus, you two, get a room.

478
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,580
Hey there, Barbie girl.

479
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,383
You're lookin'
prettier than ever.

480
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,752
Oh, yeah.

481
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:35,021
Hey, daddy.

482
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,422
Hey, boy.

483
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,892
How's your boxing technique
comin' along?

484
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:40,159
Come on.

485
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:42,395
Maybe wrasslin's more
your style. Come here.

486
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,637
Come on, boy, fight back.

487
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:53,806
You don't wanna
look like a homo

488
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:55,641
in front of your dad's
prison pals now, do ya?

489
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,111
No, daddy, I don't want
to look like a homo

490
00:29:58,113 --> 00:29:59,612
in front of all
your prison pals.

491
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:01,014
All right,
just grab the blanket.

492
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:03,516
I got us a spot over by
that tree. Come on.

493
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:04,951
Rena.

494
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,724
You are getting so big.

495
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,192
I'm not that big.

496
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:15,028
She's just become
womanly is all.

497
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,429
I meant she's just...

498
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:19,032
yeah, i meant she's
getting pretty, you know?

499
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:20,033
Radiant, even.

500
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:22,468
She don't look that radiant.

501
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,238
You're gonna be fightin'
the boys off with a stick.

502
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,740
Yes, you are.
Just like your mama.

503
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,809
Let's go over
by the tree. Come on!

504
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:32,611
Little late for a stick.

505
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:38,017
Yeah.

506
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:39,852
Look at that.

507
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,424
You must be Jay junior.

508
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,026
Your daddy saved you this spot.
Spread that blanket out here.

509
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:48,727
P.A: <i>please be advised...</i>

510
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:53,132
<i>due to today's picnic, library,</i>
<i>gym, barbershop will be closed.</i>

511
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:58,471
I see you met buddy.
Hey, this is buddy, everybody.

512
00:30:58,473 --> 00:30:59,472
Hey, buddy.

513
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:00,440
Told you they'd come.

514
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:02,741
Well, come on.

515
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:04,677
You look a little young
to be a lifer.

516
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,046
That's 'cause I ain't.
I'm a trustee.

517
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:10,616
Yeah, he got hisself
three years for armed robbery.

518
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,852
I'll be out by labor day.
Good behavior.

519
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:17,523
Good for you.
Your mama must be proud.

520
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:19,692
John: Well, come on,
what'd you bring us?

521
00:31:21,862 --> 00:31:24,297
John junior
made his casserole.

522
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,899
Iooked a lot better
till mama put potato chips

523
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:27,967
all over everything.

524
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,068
Well, this looks good.

525
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,472
(whistle blows)

526
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,274
Game time. Everybody come on
over for the tug-o-war

527
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:36,909
at south end of the yard!

528
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:39,078
Let's go get 'em!
Come on!

529
00:31:44,218 --> 00:31:45,485
I'm looking
for a win here.

530
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,785
We're gonna
kill 'em, daddy!

531
00:31:46,787 --> 00:31:48,988
That's an unfortunate
choice of words.

532
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,057
I'm the biggest, so I'm
gonna anchor from the front.

533
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,926
Jay, you fall in behind.
Buddy, you get the ass end.

534
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:55,428
All right, I got here.

535
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,696
Go, you guys!
Come on!

536
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,032
Hi, y'all.
We're the Grubbs.

537
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:03,002
Yeah, Grubbs,
Grubbs, Grubbs, Grubbs...

538
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,904
mother: Go, go, go!

539
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:05,905
Grubbs, Grubbs, Grubbs!

540
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:09,509
(chanting continues)

541
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,876
(blows whistle)

542
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:28,428
Shit!

543
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,632
It's all right.

544
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:35,535
We'll get him
some fresh clothes.

545
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,570
You don't mind?

546
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:38,671
No, go ahead.

547
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:40,039
Thank you.

548
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,474
You're welcome.

549
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:54,487
Takin' care
of a little business is all.

550
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:11,504
¶ heard she went and left you
like she left the one before ¶

551
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:14,507
¶ you thought it wouldn't happen
if you loved a little more ¶

552
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:16,642
¶ you could've loved her
endlessly ¶

553
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:18,444
¶ nothing would change ¶

554
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:21,481
¶ but now you'll have to figure
why life is so strange ¶

555
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:24,150
¶ you know I been down
that road ¶

556
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:27,720
¶ you gotta move on
and let the cold wind blow ¶

557
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:30,289
¶ you get another chance,
you get another ride ¶

558
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:33,459
¶ make the best of what you got
and look on the bright side ¶

559
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:38,531
¶ it's wide open ¶

560
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:43,469
¶ anything you dream ¶

561
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:46,639
¶ is sure to set you free ¶

562
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:52,711
¶ wide open ¶

563
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:55,314
¶ anywhere you go ¶

564
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:59,318
¶ your love will always flow ¶

565
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,833
¶ i know you've been a friend
through my bad times ¶

566
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,835
¶ I was dumped,
left in the dust ¶

567
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,271
¶ you helped me
keep my mind ¶

568
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:20,906
¶ but through it all,
I fell for you ¶

569
00:34:20,908 --> 00:34:23,876
¶ baby, how I fell for you ¶

570
00:34:28,182 --> 00:34:32,885
daddy!
Bronze medal!

571
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,620
Well, you showed 'em,
Rena girl.

572
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:36,455
You shouldn't be
horsin' around, Rena.

573
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:38,591
You're gonna hurt
that damn baby.

574
00:34:40,794 --> 00:34:43,062
What?

575
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,065
Oops.

576
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,200
Is that true?

577
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:48,701
Yes, sir.

578
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,236
Well, that's the best news

579
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:52,505
you could've brought
your lifer daddy!

580
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,039
I'm gonna be a granddaddy!

581
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,974
My little girl's
gonna have a baby!

582
00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:57,943
I knew you'd be happy, daddy.

583
00:34:57,945 --> 00:35:00,246
Mama said you wouldn't,
but I knew that you would.

584
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:02,315
What?

585
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:03,649
Is that true?

586
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,020
Yes, sir.

587
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:10,223
I thought maybe...

588
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:11,691
you thought?

589
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,092
You thought?

590
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:14,760
Well, I'll tell you
what I think.

591
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:17,530
I think somebody ought to
knock you upside the head!

592
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,997
Grubb!

593
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:22,134
Junior, you sit still!

594
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,505
She's gonna be okay.

595
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:27,973
I was just gonna
make sure that she...

596
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:29,908
don't you talk back
to your mama. Sit down!

597
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,745
Just calm down.
I can explain everything.

598
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:05,778
I'm gonna have
some of that cake.

599
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,780
Yeah, daddy,
I made us a cake.

600
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:09,382
You did?

601
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:11,717
You'd never believe how
hard it was to keep that file

602
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,987
from stickin' out the sides
of the cake and everything.

603
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:17,022
No, no, no,
I was just joking.

604
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:20,959
He stepped
on the fuckin' potato chips!

605
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:24,297
How many times have I told you
not to make jokes

606
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:26,832
about any
motherfuckin' file in the cake?

607
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:34,340
Why don't I take these kiddies
on a tour of the facility?

608
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:35,574
That's a great idea.

609
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:36,909
Maybe we'll find
your little sister.

610
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:38,778
I'm not hungry anyway.

611
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:51,824
(woman crying)

612
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:08,140
What are you bawlin' for?
You're distractin' me.

613
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:12,411
Just do your business
and get out.

614
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:17,115
Business is slicing my wrists
open wide,

615
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:19,251
so don't expect any privacy
any time soon.

616
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,362
You got any hemlock?

617
00:37:29,364 --> 00:37:30,730
What?

618
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:31,997
Hemlock.

619
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,901
The poison of socrates.
Effective and permanent.

620
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:54,253
My name's Rena.

621
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:57,189
That's an ugly name.

622
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,924
What's yours?

623
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:00,426
Hildegarde.

624
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:07,400
Aren't you dead yet?

625
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:09,568
No, I was just practicin'.

626
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,671
Practice makes perfect.

627
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:15,674
Goddamn, madge, what the hell's
goin' on at home?

628
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:18,111
I guess we've just gone wild
with permissiveness

629
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:20,179
during your absence, John.

630
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:22,915
Well, goddamn!

631
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,751
Please, please
don't be like this.

632
00:38:24,753 --> 00:38:27,954
The girl just made a mistake
is all.

633
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:31,457
So, what are you
gonna do about this?

634
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,592
Honey, she's torturing herself
enough as it is.

635
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:35,762
She doesn't need me
slappin' at her.

636
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:38,765
So who's the daddy?

637
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:42,802
I don't know that she knows.

638
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:46,038
Well, at least
Rena's popular.

639
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,778
Well, John, let us think
for a moment about why that is.

640
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:58,117
I think it might be that heavy
boy from the wrestling team...

641
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,752
drugan or drury...

642
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,854
not red dugan's kid.

643
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:03,322
I think so.

644
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:05,758
That whole family's
never been worth a shit!

645
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,793
Baby...

646
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:08,261
no, no, no!

647
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:12,899
You know, I know what you're
trying to do, all right?

648
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:15,334
How are you raisin' these kids?
Just tell me that.

649
00:39:15,336 --> 00:39:16,735
What the fuck
are you thinkin'?

650
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:19,872
Well, John, it's easy for you,
isn't it?

651
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:21,340
You're sittin' in here
with your barbed wire

652
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:23,142
and your three free
squares a day

653
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:24,977
and you get
your bump and grind

654
00:39:24,979 --> 00:39:27,146
with all those big old strangers
in the shower...

655
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:28,414
hey! That's one.

656
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:29,916
Don't think that I don't know

657
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:31,450
what kind of party
goes on in here.

658
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,153
That's two.
I'll slap your ass!

659
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,588
Why don't you just
knock us all out

660
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,292
and get it over with?

661
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,360
Neither of them kids is gonna 
turn out to be worth a damn.

662
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:43,362
What, and that's all my fault?

663
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:45,331
Yeah!

664
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,042
I'm gonna be havin' a baby.

665
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:58,077
Really?

666
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,546
Well, you look awful young.

667
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:04,583
What's a little thing like you
want with a baby?

668
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:07,019
Because then there's always
gonna be somebody there

669
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:10,256
who loves me.

670
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:13,893
Just like I love my daddy
in spite of any bad things

671
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:15,627
or killings or whatever.

672
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:17,864
Things is as they is.

673
00:40:17,866 --> 00:40:19,298
That's what mama says.

674
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,068
Pardon the intrusion, ma'am.

675
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,137
Is there anything
I can do for you?

676
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:27,273
Yeah, you any good
with that gun?

677
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:28,941
I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding.

678
00:40:30,878 --> 00:40:33,679
Besides, in this family
we do all our own killing.

679
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,830
John.

680
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:56,969
Baby, things are
pretty good at home, actually.

681
00:40:56,971 --> 00:41:00,306
I mean, you know, Barbie,
she's doing real, real good.

682
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:01,540
Jay's not so bad.

683
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,943
He looks so damn fruity.

684
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:08,414
No. Uncle Arno, he taught him
how to gut a rabbit.

685
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:10,349
I've seen him
spit sometimes.

686
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:17,890
You know, I thought maybe buddy
would be a good boy for Rena.

687
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,426
Yeah, it's long been
a dream of mine

688
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:23,462
to hook her up with
one of the lesser felons

689
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:24,696
around here.

690
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,834
This here's
the educational center.

691
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,069
We got computer learning,

692
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:33,705
and they even got
a cooking class.

693
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:37,209
Up there's where they keep
the conjugal trailers at.

694
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:39,078
Yeah, that's right.

695
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,315
Mama told me
about that one time.

696
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:44,450
Right over there
we got the gym.

697
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:47,353
That's where
the regular prisoners are at.

698
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:50,323
And right over yonder
we got maximum security.

699
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:52,959
That's where all the dangerous
inmates are kept.

700
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:54,293
Like daddy?

701
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,329
That's right,
just like big Johnny Grubb.

702
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,966
If I have a baby,
it's gonna love me

703
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:04,570
in spite all my faults,
just like I love daddy.

704
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:08,307
Besides, the baby's daddy
is nice and normal.

705
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:10,309
I made sure of that.

706
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:12,578
You could maybe try calling
every once in a while.

707
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,481
That certainly
wouldn't kill you.

708
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:17,716
What good am i?
I'm in here.

709
00:42:20,387 --> 00:42:21,920
Well, John, you could start

710
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:24,090
by saying somethi"
nice to Rena.

711
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,028
Lord, she thinks
the world of you.

712
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,030
Don't ask me why.

713
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:32,865
Hell, i don't know why, madge.

714
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,768
Hell, I don't know
either, John.

715
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,604
Is there a place
around here

716
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:42,574
where a girl
could get a load off?

717
00:42:42,576 --> 00:42:47,713
They got the visitation center
right up there.

718
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:50,616
Where it's air conditioned
and they got soda pop...

719
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:53,052
I was kinda hoping
we could finish the tour.

720
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:01,627
I'm gonna have to
catch up to you, Barbie.

721
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:10,236
Come on.

722
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:14,006
Why don't you give me
some of that cherry pie, huh?

723
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,841
John, come on.

724
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,676
John!

725
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,678
There are people
right over there.

726
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,813
That's all right,
they won't say anything.

727
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:23,249
I'm serious, cut it out.

728
00:43:24,484 --> 00:43:25,984
(guard clears throat)

729
00:43:31,591 --> 00:43:33,225
Oh, man.

730
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:37,062
Buddy: What do you say
after this we get
some hot dogs and fuck?

731
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:38,163
What?

732
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:40,298
You don't like hot dogs?

733
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,868
Just a little prison humor
for ya.

734
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,339
This here is the library.
Folks come here and read.

735
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:49,608
How do you get to wander
all around like this?

736
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:54,113
I'm a trustee.
Trustees have master keys.

737
00:43:54,115 --> 00:43:55,848
Open up all the locks.

738
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:02,187
Well, this is where old...
there we go.

739
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:05,624
This is where old buddy works.
The barber shop.

740
00:44:05,626 --> 00:44:07,760
Come on, let's go
to the trailers.

741
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,999
No, I think the kids
are out here somewhere.

742
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:19,471
There's no one around,
let's go. Why not?

743
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:20,939
I can't.

744
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:22,141
Why?

745
00:44:23,943 --> 00:44:26,645
Baby, I got me
a yeast thing going on.

746
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:28,781
Really?

747
00:44:28,783 --> 00:44:30,448
No.

748
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:35,754
Why don't you have a seat?

749
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,356
Let old buddy
cut that mop of yours.

750
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:41,426
No, we should
probably be getting back.

751
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:46,098
Well, you don't want to hurt
my feelings now, do you?

752
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,633
No, no, no.
Nothing like that.

753
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:50,402
Get in the fuckin' chair.

754
00:44:56,976 --> 00:44:59,311
Somebody
got you trained right.

755
00:45:11,224 --> 00:45:14,893
Mel's only been in here
about four months.

756
00:45:14,895 --> 00:45:18,530
Most days,
I think I'm just gonna die.

757
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:20,398
I'm a young woman,
after all,

758
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,135
and he's not even gonna
be eligible for parole

759
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,038
until he is a very old man.

760
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,407
I can't get
the hang of it, I just can't.

761
00:45:35,114 --> 00:45:36,982
Congratulations
on your bronze.

762
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:42,221
Thanks. Winning third place
in the shackle race

763
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:44,056
is just about
the best thing

764
00:45:44,058 --> 00:45:48,493
that's ever happened
to me, I guess.

765
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,363
If that puts things
in perspective for you.

766
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:54,399
I'm gonna make you
look like a gentleman.

767
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:55,600
(buzzing)

768
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:00,305
You got a rat nest
up in here.

769
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:04,209
Whoo, that's a big piece.
Iook at that. Whoo!

770
00:46:04,211 --> 00:46:05,810
Come on.

771
00:46:05,812 --> 00:46:09,081
John, every time i come out
of one of them damn trailers,

772
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,448
i just feel like...

773
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,584
i feel like that's it,
you know?

774
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:15,620
I feel like that's all
I'm ever gonna get.

775
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:16,989
I tell ya...

776
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:20,259
you know, it's always hot,
isn't it?

777
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:21,793
I mean, while it lasts.

778
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:24,796
Folks do with
a lot worse, okay?

779
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,834
You got no more idea
what I'm talking about

780
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:32,004
than the man
in the moon, do you?

781
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:33,538
Well, goddamn!

782
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,340
Goddamn it.

783
00:46:38,477 --> 00:46:42,847
I am here! I am stuck here
and probably will remain here!

784
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:44,849
What the hell
do you want outta me?

785
00:46:47,253 --> 00:46:49,021
I don't know, John.

786
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:53,825
Well, a man's liable
to go lookin'.

787
00:46:55,461 --> 00:46:57,996
That's all I'm gonna say.

788
00:46:57,998 --> 00:47:00,132
You're gonna go lookin'?

789
00:47:00,134 --> 00:47:01,967
Where you gonna
go lookin', Johnny?

790
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,202
You gonna hit
the singles bars?

791
00:47:09,976 --> 00:47:12,244
I wonder where
those kids are at.

792
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:20,752
Wow, that's pretty good.

793
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,654
How about a shave?

794
00:47:22,656 --> 00:47:24,456
No, I don't think...

795
00:47:28,461 --> 00:47:30,295
so, what'd big Johnny Grubb do

796
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:35,300
to earn hisself
two consecutive life terms?

797
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:36,668
You don't know?

798
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,303
Big John don't talk
about it much.

799
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:41,440
He killed a couple guys
in a bar fight.

800
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,808
Ho!

801
00:47:45,478 --> 00:47:47,012
They deserve it?

802
00:47:49,048 --> 00:47:52,250
I guess.
Dad said they was faggots.

803
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:55,487
We can't have too many
of them now, can we?

804
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,622
Goin' around decoratin'
living rooms

805
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,291
and gardening stuff.

806
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,326
Nah uh-uh.

807
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:06,898
Ooh, look at that.

808
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:11,203
Yeah.

809
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:13,305
Handsome gentleman and purdy.

810
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,440
Now that's very impressive.

811
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:21,046
Where'd you learn
how to do that anyhow?

812
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:23,081
We have a neighbor named faye.
She taught me how.

813
00:48:24,183 --> 00:48:25,984
You must have
a lot of patience.

814
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,819
And I believe
with enough patience,

815
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,222
we can accomplish
just about anything.

816
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:33,525
Yeah.

817
00:48:36,129 --> 00:48:37,396
You're absolutely right.

818
00:48:37,398 --> 00:48:40,532
We just have to have patience.
We just gotta keep at it.

819
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:44,269
Yeah, just... keep on.

820
00:48:44,271 --> 00:48:45,270
Yeah.

821
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:51,443
Thanks a lot.

822
00:49:24,877 --> 00:49:26,578
You got a hair right there.

823
00:49:28,747 --> 00:49:30,682
Come on, let's go.

824
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:36,254
Thought I'd find you here.

825
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:46,598
So, what do you like folks
to call you? Junior?

826
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:50,702
Well, my name's John junior,

827
00:49:50,704 --> 00:49:53,037
but everybody
just calls me Jay.

828
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,707
Jay.

829
00:49:55,709 --> 00:49:56,941
Let me see that.

830
00:50:05,017 --> 00:50:06,384
So you don't forget me.

831
00:50:10,055 --> 00:50:14,593
There's not a lot of chance
in that. Forgetting ya.

832
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,461
Good.

833
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:18,029
I promise I won't.

834
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:25,103
What do you say
I go take you
to see the show?

835
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,838
What?

836
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,174
Let's go see the show.

837
00:50:29,176 --> 00:50:31,776
It's what we do
down here for fun.

838
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:37,682
What are we doing?

839
00:50:37,684 --> 00:50:39,984
These are
the conjugal trailers.

840
00:50:39,986 --> 00:50:41,052
What's "conjugal" mean?

841
00:50:41,054 --> 00:50:42,454
Fuckin'.

842
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:45,089
What?

843
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:46,791
These are
the fuckin' trailers.

844
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:50,529
I know what they are.
I live in a fuckin' trailer.

845
00:50:52,198 --> 00:50:53,365
What is it?

846
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:54,899
You don't wanna see this.

847
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:57,101
No, I wanna see.

848
00:50:57,103 --> 00:50:58,736
Think you can handle it?

849
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:01,239
All right.

850
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,508
Do I think I can handle it?

851
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:31,135
That's gonna be
a hell of a kodak moment, huh?

852
00:51:31,137 --> 00:51:32,504
Come on, Jay.

853
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:47,018
You gonna be all right?

854
00:51:51,023 --> 00:51:53,225
<i>Mama said all the pushin'</i>
<i>and shovin' daddy did</i>

855
00:51:53,227 --> 00:51:57,895
<i>was just his way of teaching us</i>
<i>right from wrong.</i>

856
00:51:57,897 --> 00:52:00,164
<i>And he never really hurt us.</i>

857
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,533
<i>Maybe this little get-together</i>

858
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,668
<i>was just too much for him</i>
<i>after so many years.</i>

859
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:17,449
How you doin', sweetheart?

860
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:18,883
I'm doin' good.

861
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,052
Just, you know,
butterflies is all.

862
00:52:27,326 --> 00:52:29,761
Baby, what happened here?

863
00:52:31,764 --> 00:52:33,598
Those cuffs in
that shackle race,

864
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,768
they were just too tight.

865
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,202
I'm fine, though.

866
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:43,975
You better put somethin' on that
when we get home.

867
00:52:43,977 --> 00:52:46,110
You seen your daddy anywhere?

868
00:52:46,112 --> 00:52:47,579
No.

869
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,015
Is daddy happy that we came?

870
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,553
Of course he is, baby.

871
00:52:58,557 --> 00:53:02,761
I don't know what he expects
out of your brother, though.

872
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:06,398
Maybe Barbie's somewhere
puttin' some sense into him.

873
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,668
Excuse me... sheriff?

874
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,171
That's deputy, ma'am.
My friends call me richard.

875
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:17,642
Okay. Richard, you wouldn't
happen to know

876
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:20,077
where that son of a bitch
I married

877
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,413
has gotten to, would you?

878
00:53:22,548 --> 00:53:24,816
I'm sure he's
around here somewhere.

879
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:28,152
These guys don't go nowhere
unless we let 'em, you know?

880
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:30,888
But I'd sure be happy
to help you look for him.

881
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:35,159
Okay. Okay.
I'll be right back, sweetie.

882
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:36,761
Let me help you up there.

883
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:38,596
Thank you.

884
00:53:55,748 --> 00:53:57,215
I'll be right back.

885
00:54:10,128 --> 00:54:11,295
Hey, red.

886
00:54:11,297 --> 00:54:14,399
Oh, my god,
you scared me.

887
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:16,534
Not as much
as I'm gonna scare you.

888
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:19,604
What do you mean?

889
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:21,973
I think you know
exactly what I mean.

890
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:30,515
I'm gonna go back
to the picnic area now.

891
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,551
Hey, you got any cigarettes?

892
00:54:32,553 --> 00:54:36,021
This here's my last one,
and I have a heart murmur,

893
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:39,090
so i need it,
and I'm gonna smoke it.

894
00:54:39,092 --> 00:54:40,525
It's a filthy habit anyway.

895
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,863
You know, my silence
can be bought
very inexpensively.

896
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,998
Well, i don't got
any money, so...

897
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,466
I don't want your money.

898
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,471
No. I thought rather,
I'd really like

899
00:54:53,473 --> 00:54:55,840
to hear you
squeal like a piggy.

900
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:57,442
Excuse me?

901
00:54:57,444 --> 00:55:00,344
Now, i know you've been
to the movies a time or two.

902
00:55:00,346 --> 00:55:02,581
I'd like to hear you
squeal like a piggy.

903
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,950
I most definitely will not!

904
00:55:09,388 --> 00:55:10,789
Mrs. Grubb!

905
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,524
You'll never guess
who's fuckin' your...

906
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:14,926
okay!

907
00:55:14,928 --> 00:55:16,427
Shit, fine.

908
00:55:16,429 --> 00:55:18,663
Oink, oink.

909
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:23,468
Mrs. Grubb!

910
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,104
All right! Fine.

911
00:55:26,106 --> 00:55:27,505
Let me help you out here.

912
00:55:27,507 --> 00:55:29,641
Real piggies would probably
like some grass,

913
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:31,743
so why don't you
come over here

914
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,846
and maybe get on all fours
like a real piggy?

915
00:55:34,848 --> 00:55:36,081
What do you say?

916
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,717
Come on now,
I wanna hear you... ree!

917
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,286
Come on now, on all fours
like a real piggy.

918
00:55:44,189 --> 00:55:46,024
Yeah, come on, come on now.

919
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:49,995
Could be worse,
you could be in the mud.

920
00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:53,231
You don't wanna be in mud.
Nice soft grass.

921
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,770
Yeah, that's right,
good little piggy.

922
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,105
Come on.

923
00:56:01,674 --> 00:56:02,907
That's right, that's right.

924
00:56:02,909 --> 00:56:06,277
(snorts like a pig)

925
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,780
All right, come on, more,
I want more!

926
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,948
(snorting continues)

927
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,650
Yeah!

928
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:12,984
That's right!

929
00:56:12,986 --> 00:56:14,686
(yelling and snorting)

930
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:16,254
Yeah!

931
00:56:16,256 --> 00:56:19,157
Come on, like a pig!
I wanna hear you reee!

932
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,596
That's real nice.

933
00:56:25,598 --> 00:56:28,099
That's real nice.

934
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:29,668
Come on, everybody.

935
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,636
(men cheering and jeering)

936
00:56:33,706 --> 00:56:35,907
That's all, folks.

937
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:37,175
Yeah!

938
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,015
<i>Today's annual picnic</i>
<i>will be concluded at 4:00.</i>

939
00:56:44,017 --> 00:56:46,450
<i>All visitors will need</i>
<i>to begin lining up</i>

940
00:56:46,452 --> 00:56:48,787
<i>at the gate at 3:30</i>
<i>with all belongings.</i>

941
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:52,824
<i>Commanding officer jones,</i>
<i>report to the visitors tent.</i>

942
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,125
<i>Commanding officer jones,</i>

943
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:56,327
<i>please report</i>
<i>to the visitors tent.</i>

944
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:05,804
Hey, daddy.

945
00:57:05,806 --> 00:57:07,105
Where's your mama?

946
00:57:07,107 --> 00:57:09,941
She went off
looking for you.

947
00:57:09,943 --> 00:57:12,077
Give me a sandwich,
would ya?

948
00:57:14,947 --> 00:57:16,981
I'm really glad
that we came here, daddy.

949
00:57:16,983 --> 00:57:20,651
I knew seeing you again
would be really nice.

950
00:57:20,653 --> 00:57:22,386
Yeah.

951
00:57:26,258 --> 00:57:28,093
You're getting' to be
quite a gal, Rena.

952
00:57:30,362 --> 00:57:33,231
You know...

953
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:36,000
your mama loves you.
Remember that...

954
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:39,403
you know, when she's a bitch
and all... that she loves you.

955
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:43,441
I know.

956
00:57:46,445 --> 00:57:48,146
Hey, here.

957
00:57:48,148 --> 00:57:50,414
Thanks for all those postcards
you've been sending.

958
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:53,017
I like 'em.

959
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:54,919
I don't mind
that there's
no pictures on 'em.

960
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:58,389
You know, Kenton likes football,
so you'd like him.

961
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,258
He's a lot like...

962
00:58:01,794 --> 00:58:04,929
you know, i still
have those books

963
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:06,865
that you read to me
when I was younger...

964
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:09,234
hey, look. Shovel pass!

965
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:13,004
They're under my bed.
Sometimes, you know...

966
00:58:13,006 --> 00:58:14,372
Kenton would
really like you.

967
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:16,775
I'm like tired
and I get them out

968
00:58:16,777 --> 00:58:18,777
and I just remember
how you used to read to me

969
00:58:18,779 --> 00:58:20,078
until I fell asleep...

970
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:23,614
Bomb!

971
00:58:26,385 --> 00:58:29,220
Here we go!
Come on!

972
00:58:29,222 --> 00:58:31,355
Hey, what's up
with this damn baby?

973
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:33,457
Go long! Go long!

974
00:58:33,459 --> 00:58:36,294
Well, I kinda wanted to name it
after you, daddy.

975
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:39,297
John Grubb the third.

976
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:41,399
When your last name's Grubb,

977
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:44,335
you kinda have to be careful
what you put before it.

978
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:46,137
Nice catch, jerk-off!

979
00:58:47,372 --> 00:58:48,873
I was kind of thinking that

980
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:52,576
russell upsome
might be a nice name.

981
00:58:52,578 --> 00:58:53,812
Mm-hmm. Sidearm!

982
00:58:53,814 --> 00:58:56,014
Russell upsome Grubb.

983
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:03,454
What do you think, daddy?

984
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,588
Sure thing, baby doll.

985
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,192
Oh, yeah.

986
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:08,726
You got any advice, daddy?

987
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:10,862
Yeah, go long! Long!

988
00:59:10,864 --> 00:59:12,663
Don't worry.

989
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:15,033
I'll write a special
suicide note

990
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:17,001
explaining the whole thing
out for you.

991
00:59:22,374 --> 00:59:24,775
Hey, you're not
that far along.

992
00:59:24,777 --> 00:59:28,546
So I gave your mama
the name of a guy

993
00:59:28,548 --> 00:59:30,381
who can take care
of this for you.

994
00:59:30,383 --> 00:59:32,217
Thanks, daddy.

995
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:33,684
Sure thing.

996
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:37,889
I mean, a daddy takes care
of his little girl, don't he?

997
00:59:42,027 --> 00:59:44,996
All right, hit me!
Come on!

998
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,130
Hit me, I'm open.

999
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:25,336
That part, you know,

1000
01:00:25,338 --> 01:00:28,706
that's not really
so bad, but...

1001
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,742
I mean, yeah,
if John wasn't stuck here,

1002
01:00:31,744 --> 01:00:35,914
I would absolutely take my kids
and I'd leave.

1003
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:38,716
And where would you go to?

1004
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,919
Hey, I thought
alcohol wasn't allowed.

1005
01:00:42,454 --> 01:00:43,955
It's not.

1006
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:50,328
Where? Anywhere?

1007
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,564
Don't laugh.

1008
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:56,467
Well, I was thinking maybe
I'd take the kids

1009
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:58,869
and move to disney world.

1010
01:00:58,871 --> 01:01:01,572
Ah, the happiest
place on earth.

1011
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,708
Yeah, well,
that's what they say. Yeah.

1012
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,145
I mean, not in
the actual park itself...

1013
01:01:07,147 --> 01:01:08,413
of course not.

1014
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:09,414
Maybe somewhere close by.

1015
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:12,083
So what's stoppin' you?

1016
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,754
John would just about
snap my neck if we left.

1017
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,657
Not with two consecutive
lifetimes, he won't.

1018
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:22,393
Well, yeah, but I've got him
pretty pissed off,

1019
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:23,894
missin' all those conjugals.

1020
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:25,729
What you talkin' about?

1021
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:27,565
All those conjugal visits,
you know.

1022
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:29,400
Well, i know
what they are, madge.

1023
01:01:29,402 --> 01:01:31,802
It's just, I've never
known John to miss one.

1024
01:01:31,804 --> 01:01:33,637
In fact, Johnny Grubb's
been getting

1025
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:35,340
all his conjugal visits.

1026
01:01:35,342 --> 01:01:37,808
But you knew that.

1027
01:02:12,644 --> 01:02:14,945
Madge...

1028
01:02:14,947 --> 01:02:16,814
we're all fuckered up here.

1029
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,718
You don't belong
in this place.

1030
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,853
I think there's probably
a better life

1031
01:02:22,855 --> 01:02:24,288
for you out there
somewhere.

1032
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,957
By god, you ought
to go find it.

1033
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,564
I wanna thank you
for, you know...

1034
01:02:44,643 --> 01:02:49,547
mama, hey! You wanna be
my partner for the egg toss?

1035
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:51,516
Sounds like a waste of eggs,
Barbie.

1036
01:02:55,154 --> 01:02:56,354
Nice haircut.

1037
01:02:57,423 --> 01:02:59,223
I won't tell mom.

1038
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:02,093
Get up and you fight me
like a man, you son of a bitch!

1039
01:03:02,095 --> 01:03:03,627
What's wrong with you, madge?

1040
01:03:03,629 --> 01:03:05,563
You son of a bitch,
you horndog!

1041
01:03:05,565 --> 01:03:07,098
I know all about you!

1042
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,034
I know all about you
and your conjugal floozy!

1043
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,902
Your mama sure is pissed.

1044
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:19,143
Yeah, she's usually
a screamer, not a fighter.

1045
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:21,379
How about you?
You a fighter?

1046
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,247
No, I'm more of a lover.

1047
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:33,558
Life sure is worth living,
ain't it?

1048
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:38,329
You take care now, Jay.

1049
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,234
Why don't you tell your kids

1050
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,603
that you been cheatin'
on their mama?

1051
01:03:45,605 --> 01:03:47,071
I'm gonna have to drop you.

1052
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,606
Where the hell
did you meet her?

1053
01:03:48,608 --> 01:03:50,174
Come on, now.

1054
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:51,542
Where the hell
did you meet her?

1055
01:03:51,544 --> 01:03:53,478
Is she some bull dyke
from the women's prison?

1056
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:58,282
Or is she some pen pal,
some desperate whore you...

1057
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:20,070
mother: Baby, baby,
are you okay?

1058
01:04:29,781 --> 01:04:31,749
Could somebody get somebody?

1059
01:04:46,532 --> 01:04:48,799
(sobbing)

1060
01:04:52,171 --> 01:04:54,071
She's been in there
a long time.

1061
01:04:54,073 --> 01:04:55,606
Hope she's all right.

1062
01:04:55,608 --> 01:04:58,209
She'll be okay.
She just got the wind
knocked out of her.

1063
01:04:58,211 --> 01:05:01,879
They don't make 'em any tougher
than Rena, I'll tell you that.

1064
01:05:01,881 --> 01:05:03,947
It's that motherfuckin'
guard's fault.

1065
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:10,221
That motherfuckin' guard
set me up.

1066
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:12,590
He just wanted to get
some of that cherry pie.

1067
01:05:12,592 --> 01:05:14,525
John, shut up.

1068
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:17,027
He's jealous.
Who can blame him?

1069
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:19,597
Yeah, he's after you.

1070
01:05:22,467 --> 01:05:23,634
You're lookin' good.

1071
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:30,908
Come on,
let's get outta here.

1072
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,310
John, we can't.

1073
01:05:32,312 --> 01:05:34,978
Yeah, we can.
Come on, let's go.

1074
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,648
No, we're already
in trouble.

1075
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:40,117
I'm doing double life.
What's some more trouble?

1076
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:41,352
Stop!

1077
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,121
Okay.
Follow me.

1078
01:05:44,123 --> 01:05:45,189
God.

1079
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,491
I'm sorry.

1080
01:05:47,493 --> 01:05:49,560
God!

1081
01:05:49,562 --> 01:05:51,596
I'm sorry...

1082
01:06:07,812 --> 01:06:10,047
well, hello there.

1083
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,583
What are you lookin' at?

1084
01:06:12,585 --> 01:06:14,118
Trashy little harlot
doesn't know

1085
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,153
how to treat her mama?

1086
01:06:16,155 --> 01:06:18,088
Just a guess.

1087
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,557
Fuck you.

1088
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,392
Why don't you sit there
until I tell you to...

1089
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,295
guess what! I don't happen
to be a prisoner here!

1090
01:07:09,174 --> 01:07:10,974
What the fuck?

1091
01:07:10,976 --> 01:07:13,511
What the fuck did you
just do to yourself, Rena?

1092
01:07:13,513 --> 01:07:14,912
Nothing...

1093
01:07:14,914 --> 01:07:17,147
you're not leavin' me here
alone, goddamn you!

1094
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,220
Gimme that.

1095
01:07:26,124 --> 01:07:27,792
Just sit down.

1096
01:07:29,328 --> 01:07:30,795
Hold this up.

1097
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,764
If you wanna die,
you sure picked

1098
01:07:33,766 --> 01:07:35,833
one hell of
a shovin'-off place.

1099
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,170
I'm sorry.

1100
01:07:41,573 --> 01:07:44,475
Why? None of this
is your fault.

1101
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,210
Why don't you
let me go, Jay?

1102
01:07:46,212 --> 01:07:47,611
'Cause you're my sister.

1103
01:07:47,613 --> 01:07:51,114
Hell, i don't even wanna
see Barbie dead most days.

1104
01:07:51,116 --> 01:07:53,250
You love me
'cause you have to.

1105
01:07:53,252 --> 01:07:56,554
I'm your sister
and you have to.

1106
01:07:56,556 --> 01:07:57,822
I don't have to.

1107
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:00,991
You don't love daddy,
do you, Jay?

1108
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:04,695
No.

1109
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:08,499
Why not? He's your daddy,
just like I'm your sister.

1110
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,635
I haven't done anything for you
to just give me your love.

1111
01:08:11,637 --> 01:08:14,304
Yeah, well, you never tried
to shit on it, either.

1112
01:08:16,475 --> 01:08:19,610
Somebody gives you
their love,

1113
01:08:19,612 --> 01:08:22,413
you should try
not to shit on it, I guess.

1114
01:08:25,049 --> 01:08:26,817
I should write that down.

1115
01:08:33,224 --> 01:08:35,893
Maybe you should
embroider it on something.

1116
01:08:42,233 --> 01:08:43,467
You know what else?

1117
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:45,068
What else?

1118
01:08:47,372 --> 01:08:49,239
This shit gets better.

1119
01:08:53,645 --> 01:08:55,746
I promise.

1120
01:08:55,748 --> 01:09:00,751
What do you say i go get mom
and we get the fuck outta here?

1121
01:09:00,753 --> 01:09:01,952
Okay?

1122
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:04,422
Yeah, that sounds
like a plan.

1123
01:09:08,259 --> 01:09:10,594
Hold that
on there tightly.

1124
01:09:10,596 --> 01:09:11,929
I'll be back.

1125
01:09:15,467 --> 01:09:16,901
What, madge?

1126
01:09:18,269 --> 01:09:19,670
What?

1127
01:09:19,672 --> 01:09:21,472
No, same as always, John.

1128
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:23,240
Same as always?

1129
01:09:24,576 --> 01:09:25,776
It don't matter.

1130
01:09:25,778 --> 01:09:26,977
Wait a minute, baby.

1131
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:28,412
What's the matter?

1132
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:34,785
John, I'm taking the kids.
We're moving to Disney world.

1133
01:09:36,421 --> 01:09:38,722
Fuck that!

1134
01:09:38,724 --> 01:09:41,158
Hey, hey!

1135
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,526
Madge!

1136
01:09:42,528 --> 01:09:45,062
Fuck that shit!

1137
01:09:47,365 --> 01:09:49,500
You can't do that.

1138
01:09:49,502 --> 01:09:50,668
Why not?

1139
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,269
'Cause nobody lives
at disneyland.

1140
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,604
We're gonna.

1141
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,841
And i said disney world.
You never did listen to me.

1142
01:09:56,843 --> 01:09:58,175
Orlando?

1143
01:09:58,177 --> 01:10:03,146
Are you fuckin' nuts?
What about your job?

1144
01:10:03,148 --> 01:10:04,882
You mean jobs, John.

1145
01:10:04,884 --> 01:10:07,618
You know, it takes money
to keep these kids

1146
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,787
in clothes and food
and slurpees

1147
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,021
and pay the bills

1148
01:10:11,023 --> 01:10:12,857
and do all the shit
that a real family does.

1149
01:10:12,859 --> 01:10:14,592
But don't you worry about us.

1150
01:10:14,594 --> 01:10:16,426
I can find myself
a mind-numbing,

1151
01:10:16,428 --> 01:10:17,828
low-paying job
anywhere I go.

1152
01:10:30,509 --> 01:10:31,809
You are so stupid.

1153
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,511
All you had to do
was be nice to us

1154
01:10:33,513 --> 01:10:34,979
for one day, John.

1155
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,948
Just pretend for one day,
and you couldn't even do that.

1156
01:10:41,452 --> 01:10:43,721
All right, babe.

1157
01:10:43,723 --> 01:10:46,957
I gotta take a piss.
I'll catch up with you later.

1158
01:10:48,627 --> 01:10:49,793
Okay?

1159
01:10:53,865 --> 01:10:56,033
Fuckin' bitch.

1160
01:11:06,678 --> 01:11:08,378
Hey, Rena.

1161
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,113
Hey, daddy.

1162
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:15,218
You're lookin'...

1163
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,454
you're lookin' special.

1164
01:11:17,456 --> 01:11:20,591
That's my girl,
lookin' special.

1165
01:11:20,593 --> 01:11:23,794
Your dad's very proud of you.
You know that, don't you?

1166
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:26,263
I haven't done anything
to make nobody proud, daddy.

1167
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:29,399
Yes, you have. You won
that silver medal out there.

1168
01:11:30,936 --> 01:11:32,235
It was bronze.

1169
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:34,271
Whatever.

1170
01:11:38,577 --> 01:11:40,177
Daddy, I lost it.

1171
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:41,612
We'll go out there
and find it, baby.

1172
01:11:41,614 --> 01:11:44,882
No, not the medal.
I lost the baby.

1173
01:11:47,686 --> 01:11:49,119
Well...

1174
01:11:50,589 --> 01:11:51,889
there you go.

1175
01:11:53,925 --> 01:11:56,660
See there? Nobody can say
that my little girl

1176
01:11:56,662 --> 01:11:59,196
can't take care of herself.

1177
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:02,399
It's not so hard to make
your daddy proud, right?

1178
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,334
How's mama doin'?

1179
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:05,869
Well, you know your mama.

1180
01:12:05,871 --> 01:12:08,639
Some people
just ain't worth shootin'.

1181
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:11,308
Now's a fine time
for you to figure that out.

1182
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:15,980
What was that?

1183
01:12:15,982 --> 01:12:17,214
Nothin', daddy.

1184
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:18,448
I'll tell you what.

1185
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:21,118
You better look at me
when i talk to you.

1186
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,186
You and your brother better
learn some respect for me,

1187
01:12:23,188 --> 01:12:25,322
or I'm gonna teach you
some respect

1188
01:12:25,324 --> 01:12:27,457
with the back of my hand,
you got that?

1189
01:12:27,459 --> 01:12:29,760
You know what, daddy?

1190
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,662
I'm not afraid of you.

1191
01:12:31,664 --> 01:12:33,998
What?

1192
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,733
I said I'm not afraid of you.

1193
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:37,167
Come here,
I'm gonna teach you...

1194
01:12:37,169 --> 01:12:38,969
hey!
Outside, Grubb.

1195
01:12:49,147 --> 01:12:51,314
Okay, Grubb,
let's go. Outside.

1196
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:10,901
You look like shit.

1197
01:13:13,571 --> 01:13:16,907
You know, if you could
just find it inside of you

1198
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:18,575
to be nice to me
just for once,

1199
01:13:18,577 --> 01:13:22,546
now would be a really good time
to do that.

1200
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:29,452
Sorry.

1201
01:13:33,324 --> 01:13:35,159
You're so lucky.

1202
01:13:37,562 --> 01:13:39,229
(rueful chuckle)

1203
01:13:40,598 --> 01:13:43,233
Yeah, I'm really lucky,
all right.

1204
01:13:46,771 --> 01:13:48,338
Do you remember your daddy?

1205
01:13:51,976 --> 01:13:53,744
I met him once
when i was little.

1206
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:57,848
Were you upset when he died?

1207
01:14:01,052 --> 01:14:02,285
A little.

1208
01:14:04,589 --> 01:14:07,091
No.

1209
01:14:07,093 --> 01:14:08,525
No, not really.

1210
01:14:11,362 --> 01:14:13,630
So i guess now
you don't expect nothin'.

1211
01:14:18,336 --> 01:14:20,637
Well, nothin's
exactly what I got.

1212
01:14:22,406 --> 01:14:23,941
Nobody expects
nothin' of you

1213
01:14:23,943 --> 01:14:27,277
on account of
that heart murmur.

1214
01:14:32,117 --> 01:14:34,651
Yeah, it's really great
to be me, all right.

1215
01:14:34,653 --> 01:14:36,586
It's just one big old
fuckin' jamboree.

1216
01:14:41,926 --> 01:14:43,660
Here.

1217
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:53,837
(coughs)

1218
01:15:04,548 --> 01:15:06,449
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1219
01:15:08,787 --> 01:15:10,053
Yeah.

1220
01:15:15,493 --> 01:15:16,526
Thanks.

1221
01:15:19,898 --> 01:15:21,865
There you are.
Where have you been?

1222
01:15:21,867 --> 01:15:24,601
Let's get the hell outta here
and go home.

1223
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,203
Barbie: Don't have to tell us
more than once.

1224
01:15:30,608 --> 01:15:32,943
Sir...

1225
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,812
could you shoot us?

1226
01:15:34,814 --> 01:15:35,979
Please?

1227
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:37,681
Seriously.

1228
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:40,884
We tried.

1229
01:15:45,223 --> 01:15:47,457
I don't know, John.
There's some changes coming.

1230
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:48,992
Goddamn, a man should be...

1231
01:15:48,994 --> 01:15:50,127
just kiss me good-bye.

1232
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,595
Try not to wreck
my last raw nerve.

1233
01:15:52,597 --> 01:15:53,697
Bye, daddy.

1234
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:55,498
Hey, Rena.

1235
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:00,103
You come and see your daddy
real soon. Okay, Rena?

1236
01:16:00,105 --> 01:16:02,172
Yeah, I'll keep lookin'
for those postcards you send.

1237
01:16:02,174 --> 01:16:04,041
Why do you keep talkin'
about postcards?

1238
01:16:04,043 --> 01:16:05,475
What's up with that?

1239
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:06,509
I know it's not much,

1240
01:16:06,511 --> 01:16:08,178
but at least
you make an attempt.

1241
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,913
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1242
01:16:09,915 --> 01:16:13,250
I've been having faye mail 'em
from the flea market.

1243
01:16:13,252 --> 01:16:15,618
I'm sorry.

1244
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:17,787
Well, hey, whatever.

1245
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:21,892
I just want to say,
you know, congratulations.

1246
01:16:21,894 --> 01:16:23,126
For what?

1247
01:16:23,128 --> 01:16:25,162
For getting your,
you know...

1248
01:16:28,532 --> 01:16:30,834
congratulations is not...

1249
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,570
you know, daddy, I don't really
think that you should say that.

1250
01:16:33,572 --> 01:16:37,074
Don't get all weepy
on me now. Come on.

1251
01:16:37,076 --> 01:16:39,576
Think of it this way, okay?
Things ain't all that bad.

1252
01:16:39,578 --> 01:16:43,080
I mean, it didn't
cost you nothin'.

1253
01:16:45,316 --> 01:16:46,283
Goddamn!

1254
01:16:50,288 --> 01:16:52,655
Get her off!
Get her off me!

1255
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:58,862
You're lucky
I don't have a gun!

1256
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,498
She went fucki'
ballistic on me!

1257
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,533
Motherfucker!

1258
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,037
Let me go!

1259
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:12,709
Just fuck it.

1260
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:18,548
Don't even sweat it.
Dad's a dick.

1261
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,550
He wasn't always, Jay.

1262
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,620
Yeah, Rena, he was.
Daddy's always been a dick.

1263
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:27,857
Then it just
must be this fuckin' place.

1264
01:17:27,859 --> 01:17:30,294
I don't know
what they did to him,

1265
01:17:30,296 --> 01:17:33,863
but he used to read me
stupid nursery rhymes.

1266
01:17:33,865 --> 01:17:38,302
<i>"Slippery, slippery sam,</i>
<i>he sat upon a ham."</i>

1267
01:17:38,304 --> 01:17:40,470
<i>Aw, for chr... what?!</i>

1268
01:17:40,472 --> 01:17:43,573
<i>She spilled the damn drink</i>
<i>on me, for christ's...</i>

1269
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:46,810
<i>what the fuck?</i>
<i>Get up! Get up!</i>

1270
01:17:46,812 --> 01:17:48,111
Shit!

1271
01:17:48,113 --> 01:17:49,479
Shit!

1272
01:17:49,481 --> 01:17:51,614
You gotta stop
bein' so damn dense

1273
01:17:51,616 --> 01:17:53,216
and knock some sense
into that girl.

1274
01:17:53,218 --> 01:17:57,220
Dense? Let me tell you
somethin', John.

1275
01:17:57,222 --> 01:17:59,722
Bein' stupid is somethin'
I intend to overcome,

1276
01:17:59,724 --> 01:18:03,160
but you are stuck here
bein' mean for a lifetime.

1277
01:18:03,162 --> 01:18:05,562
That's me.
Mean and nasty.

1278
01:18:05,564 --> 01:18:07,397
If there is a god in heaven,

1279
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:11,168
I hope that you are cornholed
by the meanest, nastiest...

1280
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:14,671
no, no, no. I hope you
are cornholed by satan himself.

1281
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:17,707
Maybe then you'll understand
just a fraction of the pain

1282
01:18:17,709 --> 01:18:19,309
you have put us through.

1283
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:22,279
In your dreams, madge.
In your dreams.

1284
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,580
You'll be back!

1285
01:18:23,582 --> 01:18:25,515
You can't get enough
of big John Grubb!

1286
01:18:25,517 --> 01:18:29,052
You need the Grubb worm!
I'll see you next month, baby!

1287
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,527
It went better
than it could have.

1288
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:41,598
No shit, ace.

1289
01:18:44,369 --> 01:18:46,236
I've been thinking.

1290
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:48,671
Just because we was born
and raised here,

1291
01:18:48,673 --> 01:18:49,772
we don't have to die here.

1292
01:18:49,774 --> 01:18:51,308
I think we should move.

1293
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:52,509
Where to?

1294
01:18:54,045 --> 01:18:55,445
Orlando.

1295
01:18:56,814 --> 01:18:59,549
It's where they keep
Mickey Mouse at, I believe.

1296
01:18:59,551 --> 01:19:02,319
Madge grubb, you've just
had the livin' dog shit

1297
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:05,022
kicked out of ya
at a state penitentiary...

1298
01:19:05,024 --> 01:19:06,523
what are you
gonna do next?

1299
01:19:06,525 --> 01:19:09,692
I'm going to disney world!

1300
01:19:09,694 --> 01:19:11,228
You guys are fucked up.

1301
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:12,695
Perhaps.

1302
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:14,431
In the best way possible.

1303
01:19:15,966 --> 01:19:17,167
Good night, baby.

1304
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,201
Good night.

1305
01:19:33,918 --> 01:19:36,353
Baby, you just wanted
a daddy so bad

1306

1307
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:40,590

1308
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:45,495
I get it.

1309
01:19:49,434 --> 01:19:51,268
It's okay.

1310
01:19:54,872 --> 01:19:56,839
I'm sorry.

1311
01:19:56,841 --> 01:19:58,675
I'm sorry.

1312
01:20:05,149 --> 01:20:06,450
It's okay.

1313
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:11,020

¶ and a smile
will replace your tears ¶

1397
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:40,300
¶ suddenly you'll see
the open road ¶

1398
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:43,303
¶ you're gonna see
the open road, baby ¶

1399
01:26:09,396 --> 01:26:13,333
¶ bye, bye, sweet angel ¶

1400
01:26:15,402 --> 01:26:19,072
¶ bye, bye, my love ¶

1401
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:23,843
¶ if we ride
all the rides ¶

1402
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:26,579
¶ if we stand by
each other's side ¶

1403
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:31,550
¶ my sweet angel,
good night ¶

1404
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:36,256
¶ sun's shinin' ¶

1405
01:26:36,258 --> 01:26:39,259
¶ the candle's burnin' low ¶

1406
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:42,028
¶ drivin' through the desert
round midnight ¶

1407
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:45,965
¶ you don't know
where you're goin' ¶

1408
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:50,970
¶ angel
followin' the stars ¶

1409
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:53,907
¶ in a '74 pinto
with a broken belt ¶

1410
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:57,243
¶ drivin' all the way
to mars ¶

1411
01:26:57,245 --> 01:27:01,480
¶ oh, my baby ¶

1412
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:09,322
¶ my little girl
almost died tonight ¶

1413
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:13,659
¶ bye, bye, sweet angel ¶

1414
01:27:15,229 --> 01:27:18,898
¶ bye, bye, my love ¶

1415
01:27:21,101 --> 01:27:23,769
¶ if we ride all the rides ¶

1416
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:26,605
¶ if we stand by
each other's side ¶

1417
01:27:26,607 --> 01:27:31,377
¶ my sweet angel,
good night ¶

1418
01:27:33,347 --> 01:27:36,149
¶ you got so many
dreams inside ¶

1419
01:27:36,151 --> 01:27:39,285
¶ scared that if you think
your bus will pass you by ¶

1420
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:44,490
¶ don't know where
the rainbow starts for you ¶

1421
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:47,893
¶ one day soon
the clouds will clear... ¶
