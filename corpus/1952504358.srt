1
00:00:02,373 --> 00:00:05,358
<i>My son's story
begins in the ocean.</i>

2
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:07,153
<i>A place full of secrets.</i>

3
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:11,143
<i>Somewhere beautiful,
somewhere dangerous.</i>

4
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:15,702
<i>Its mysteries have baffled
mankind for centuries.</i>

5
00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:19,432
<i>None were solved in the Bermuda Triangle.</i>

6
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:24,677
<i>But in order to understand the Triangle,
you must understand my son.</i>

7
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:31,114
<i>Although he lives among you, he was
born in the darkest regions of the sea.</i>

8
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:34,455
<i>I hoped to teach him
the ways of the world.</i>

9
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:37,697
<i>How to live a good life
and become a good man.</i>

10
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:41,468
<i>But then...
I was taken from him.</i>

11
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:06,088
<i>Turtle 1,
Turtle 1.</i>

12
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:10,671
Tempest Key coast guard to Turtle 1.
Atlana, you're out there ?

13
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,776
<i> Flying High and free.</i>

14
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,679
All the hatcheries were undisturbed.

15
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:17,912
You missed me ?

16
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:21,563
More than I can say on an open frequency.

17
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,522
How do you know researches system turn out ?

18
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:27,166
He's got something to tell you.

19
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:33,340
<i>Dad, Mum let me take the biggest sea turtle.
It was the coolest thing ever..</i>

20
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,786
And dad, I hold my breathe
under water for almost five minutes.

21
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:40,431
Hey, that is incredible, kido.
I swear, you must be part of fish.

22
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,838
Hey, we left in an hour away.
You wanna grab a pizza and meet us?

23
00:01:46,803 --> 00:01:48,265
Tom ?

24
00:01:48,796 --> 00:01:50,384
Tom, can you read me ?

25
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,829
Oh, my God.

26
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:58,855
Atlana, sweetheart, I lost you.

27
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,716
Atlana ?

28
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:10,431
Arthur, back off.

29
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:18,401
Honey, get your seat.

30
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:21,661
Aaron, do we get a storm doing out there ?

31
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:24,619
No, sir.
Blue sky for 500 miles.

32
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:31,093
<i> Hold on. </i>

33
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,009
Mommy !

34
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:51,015
Mommy help me !

35
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,295
Mommy.

36
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:58,226
Mommy help me !

37
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,145
I'm stuck. I can't get out.

38
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:01,417
They're coming for you.

39
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,577
You have to get to the surface.
Do good with your life.

40
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:07,338
I will find you again, I promise.

41
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:08,902
I love you, Oren.

42
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,743
Mommy ?

43
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,187
Mom ?

44
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:13,289
Morning, A.C.
You had a busy night...

45
00:06:13,404 --> 00:06:14,650
Come on, get out of here.

46
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:17,526
What'd I do this time, sheriff?

47
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:20,287
Oh, it depends on where you were
at ten o'clock last night?

48
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:23,118
I don't wear a watch.
I can't tell you.

49
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:26,416
Didn't you bring in Neptune?
World and free five dolphins?

50
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:30,302
- I'm the wrong man...
- Is that so ?

51
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,722
All right....

52
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,427
How do you explain these Kodak moments ?

53
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,599
Sir, come on.

54
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,055
Any ten years old and a PC could have
photoshoped those pictures.

55
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:44,407
Come on, AC.

56
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,112
Look, you're under arrest for breaking
an entering and an animal endangerment.

57
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,379
Endangerment ?

58
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:51,484
Come on, I've seen port-a-potty that were
cleaner than this thin park.

59
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:53,451
I was doing of those dolphins a favour.

60
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:55,944
Yeah, the world is full
of misunderstood heroes.

61
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:57,413
Come on.

62
00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:02,491
Thanks for bailed me out, dad.

63
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,168
I promise I'll pay you back.

64
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:05,881
A.C, I know your heart is
on the right place,

65
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:07,687
but come on this is the third time this year.

66
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,963
I guess this is the day
when you wish you never would...

67
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:12,802
- ... to sign the adoption papers.
- Hey, kido.

68
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:15,942
No matter how many time you screw up
and you're definitely gone for the records here,

69
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,058
I'll always be your father

70
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,978
All right, I gotta go to work.

71
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,295
You know, it's ten years today
since Mom disappeared.

72
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,340
AC, please, don't.

73
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:25,816
Don't do this to yourself.

74
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:28,825
We were flying over the Bermuda Triangle.
She called me Oren

75
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:30,699
She said she had so
much to tell me.

76
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:39,569
Didn't she also said do
good with your life ?

77
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,428
I don't see you fix it
her on that.

78
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:45,983
You should be in Stanford right now,
not worrying about being incarcerated.

79
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:49,792
I'm not leaving Tempest Key until
I'll find out what happened to mom.

80
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,622
Look, I missed her too.
But you're not a teenage anymore.

81
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,832
You have so much potential.

82
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,690
I hate to see you gotta waste.

83
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:01,179
Look I'm messed up.

84
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:03,952
I'm Sorry.

85
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:06,675
If you're really sorry.

86
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:13,313
Pull your life together, kido.
I'll see you later.

87
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:29,184
<i>For Sale. </i>

88
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,113
Rough night ?

89
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:44,013
No... No, then that was fine.

90
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:46,323
But this day keep sucking
more and more by a minute.

91
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,628
Why are you putting a
for-sale sign on my boat?

92
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,784
Technically, the boat
is still mine.

93
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,293
I figured it was time for me
to cut my losses.

94
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,953
Eva.

95
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:57,687
I know you are mad about the chargers
I blew off this morning.

96
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:01,022
You know, there's something ironic about
watching five cardiologist,

97
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,985
have a heart attack when you tell them

98
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:04,353
their diving instructor is in jail.

99
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:08,985
Technically, it was a holding cell
and the plan was not to get arrested.

100
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:13,069
You know, that's what you said when you swam
above the cruise ship and went out the bar tab.

101
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:15,028
It was a wedding.

102
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:18,345
You know, I got caught up in the moment.
I've run everyone around.

103
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:22,835
For the record, the bride's maid did said that
my toast was incredibly romantic.

104
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,244
Well, maybe one of them should have wired you
the money to cover the bill.

105
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:31,765
You're not really gonna sell
my boat, are you ?

106
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,413
AC, come on, we're supposed to be
business partners.

107
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:38,631
Why did you pick last night
to go Greenpeace on me?

108
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:45,903
You wanna know the real reason
why I freed those dolphins?

109
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:53,649
It's because I felt like
they were calling to me.

110
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:00,236
So what do you say, you can talk
to fish now ?

111
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:04,741
Dolphins are mammals and...
No, it was more... They, huh...

112
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,487
Weird empathy...

113
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,180
If you want, I can call a friend
of the dolphin rescue

114
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,556
and we can set up a legal defence fund.

115
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,412
Ok...
Ok. Thanks.

116
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,851
Don't worry.

117
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:23,613
And get to work.

118
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:33,683
Get inside and
staring at these bottles.

119
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:36,287
Anyone around here wants
to afford me a drink?

120
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:39,061
Little early for happy hour,
don't you think?

121
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:44,893
You're Tom Curry's boy.
I've seen you diving Mercy Reef.

122
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,227
Then I realize I have a fan club.

123
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:48,028
You don't.

124
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:50,666
You're in a light house with endless point.

125
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:53,730
Goals of nothing on my view.

126
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:56,019
It sounds beautiful.

127
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,617
I remember the day your mother's
plane went down.

128
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,926
That cloudless Caribbean’s sky.

129
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,836
God couldn't have painted a prettier picture.

130
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,314
Then I don't know where it came this storm.

131
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:18,447
I'm sorry, who are you ?

132
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:21,543
My name's McCaffery.

133
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:23,591
Keep the change.

134
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:26,817
Arthur...

135
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:30,230
If you look hard and long
enough into the deep.

136
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,470
Something is going to start looking back.

137
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:37,943
Watch yourself.

138
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:52,661
<i>Mercy Reef
25 miles off Tempest Key. </i>

139
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:59,148
<i>This is cost guard rescue.
We have a possible ship break victim.</i>

140
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:09,433
<i>This is cost guard rescue.
We got an unidentified man, may twenty's.</i>

141
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,262
- ...He's hypothermic.
- Vitals aren't responding.

142
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:24,079
They're coming.
I mu... I must warn Oren.

143
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:26,152
Take it easy, buddy.
Take it easy...

144
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,234
We're taking you to the hospital..

145
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:33,654
<i>This is unit 66. We are on road
to the Mercy Reef hospital.</i>

146
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:37,337
<i>Tempest Key Naval
Air Station.</i>

147
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,318
Don't forget to take the left in Cuba, Torres.

148
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:49,405
You think, I'm taking advice from you Munts?
You'd get lost in a two lane highway.

149
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:52,599
- Lieutenant Torres.
- Commandant Alley.

150
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,115
You've got a new mission...
Coordinated in your NavCom.

151
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:58,492
You'll flying over Mercy reef.

152
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:02,606
- Permission to speak freely.
- Go ahead.

153
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:06,046
Sir, if you're giving me an easier assignment
because you don't believe

154
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,871
I can handle the rigour of this program
you're at 100%...

155
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,296
This is not the LPGA, Torres.

156
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,252
You tee off with the men.

157
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:17,006
These orders come from way above my head.

158
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:19,368
They told me to put my best pilot on it.

159
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:21,624
They need a clean sweep of the area.

160
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:25,371
Now if I blow enough sunshine every backside.
You're ready to fly?

161
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,954
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

162
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:30,063
Now, the coast guards have pulled a
John Doe off the Reef.

163
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,010
No boat, no I.D and no idea
where he came from.

164
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:36,784
*** to fed is up food chain.

165
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,807
If you see anything out of the ordinary,
you let me know.

166
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:03,271
Lieutenant Torres reporting
as ordered.

167
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,386
I'm flying over Mercy Reef,
there's nothing out there, guys.

168
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:25,262
Wait a second, something below
the surface is following me.

169
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:26,759
It's coming on fast.

170
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:46,558
Hang on... It's just dropped back.

171
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:48,191
I'm gonna circle around.

172
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,337
There is a disturbing...

173
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:00,623
There's a light... It...

174
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,588
- It's you...
- Welcome back.

175
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:51,642
Doctors said I can wait here until you wake up.

176
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:55,963
I hope the Navy’s doesn't have
"You break it, you bought it" policy.

177
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:01,393
You remember anything?

178
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,156
Just a flash light.

179
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:11,136
Then I was flying through the water.

180
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:16,558
And you were carrying me.

181
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:20,855
And we were going so fast.

182
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:26,402
You know, when you're drowning,
your brain misses oxygen

183
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:30,698
And you start to see things they’re unreal.
Maybe you should rest.

184
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,370
Is that your way of saying that I'm crazy?

185
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:43,208
Your plane crashed at 700 miles an hour.

186
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:46,447
So I'm gonna reserve judgment
until the painkillers were off.

187
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:51,360
I'll better go tell to the nurse, you're awake.

188
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,224
Wait...

189
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:56,600
What's your name?

190
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,677
It's not important.

191
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,484
You saved my life.
It's important to me.

192
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:06,543
AC...

193
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:53,980
Oren?

194
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,643
They know, you're here.
They know you survived.

195
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:00,470
Why did you call me that?

196
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:03,128
Where did you get this necklace?

197
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:06,060
They're coming... For you...

198
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,068
- Who are you?
- Visiting hours are over.

199
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:12,664
Who the hell are you?

200
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:16,159
This badge means I'm the only
one asking questions.

201
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,839
Where are you taking him?

202
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:25,570
I said where're you taking him?

203
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:30,177
I asked you a question.

204
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:32,981
Where are you taking him?

205
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:38,891
We got him.

206
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:05,714
When did he wake up ?

207
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:07,201
Five minutes ago.

208
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,858
Is he displaying violent tendencies like the others?

209
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:13,720
No, Sir... This is the file you
requested from the NAVY archives.

210
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:16,579
The dental records match our John Doe.

211
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:21,706
This is Hansen Gus Thompson. Member of flight 19
who disappeared December 5th.

212
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,332
1945... Bermuda Triangle.

213
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,659
Welcome home Hansen Thompson.

214
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:40,817
Where the hell have you been
for the last 60 years?

215
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,498
This Tom's caller son, it's about the man he pulled
over Mercy Reef this morning.

216
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:58,482
...That's the bitch. I tell you when I got the
perfect spot in the house for the lady. Right above....

217
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:00,007
Easy.

218
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:03,659
I've already told them to dock some place off and
I'll report the boat, tomorrow, to the Fish and Wildlife.

219
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,846
Fines not gonna stop these guys.

220
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,651
I just gonna go remind them about the catch and release policy of marlin.

221
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:14,989
AC, kicking the crap and have a bunch of issues
means that all gonna lead you back in jail.

222
00:20:16,523 --> 00:20:18,277
Okay ?

223
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:26,833
It's amazing how cruel people can be.

224
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:32,311
Yeah... It bothers me more and more.

225
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:35,777
That marlin should be in the ocean and not
hanging at some moron's fireplace.

226
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:40,709
Maybe some day, the fish will get their revenge.

227
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,461
I don't know, I think rednecks
make pretty ugly trophies.

228
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,268
I'm Nadia.

229
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:51,073
I heard you're pretty amazing under the water.

230
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:55,739
If you would like to take me diving,
I'm free tomorrow.

231
00:20:57,568 --> 00:21:00,925
I was hoping
we could do something...

232
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,288
- Let's get out of here.
- Great idea.

233
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:11,729
- Let's go for a swim.
- That's still in my mind.

234
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:27,787
You're not bad under the water yourself.

235
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:29,612
Years of practice.

236
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:34,513
You know, we met a long time ago.

237
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:37,464
Are you sure about that ?

238
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,490
You got different when I remember of you.

239
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:43,616
Let me refresh your memory.

240
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:54,182
Nadia ?

241
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,997
Ok, You're already starting to freak me out here.

242
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,239
Nadia ?

243
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:28,164
I hate those damn things.

244
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:31,748
What the hell was she ?

245
00:22:32,136 --> 00:22:35,549
Get your clothes on.
We need to talk.

246
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:53,811
Once a siren has you in her game, there's nothing a man can do.

247
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:56,380
Siren ?

248
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:57,832
Of course.

249
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:00,999
You act like you see them all the time.

250
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:03,033
I've seen my fair share.

251
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,022
Unfortunately my hands are a little rusty.

252
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:10,181
The only way to kill those scary bitches is
to nail them between the eyes.

253
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:12,122
Who are you?

254
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:14,675
An exiled like you and your mother.

255
00:23:17,008 --> 00:23:18,851
Exiled from where?

256
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:22,737
It's called different names by different cultures.

257
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,647
You probably know it by its most famous.

258
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:27,968
Atlantis.

259
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:30,231
Atlantis ?

260
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:35,038
Next time you're in Atlantis,

261
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:37,588
Could you say Hi to Captain Nemo
and to Little Mermaid for me ?

262
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:39,698
You think, I wanted to be the one to tell you ?

263
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
No, I think you need to lay off the booze, old man.

264
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,068
It psyched out your brain.

265
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:48,233
You can't run away from you true calling, Oren.

266
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:02,830
So let me get this straight...

267
00:24:03,663 --> 00:24:06,062
My parents were the rulers of Atlantis.

268
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:09,542
So I guess, technically, that would make me...

269
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,156
A prince.

270
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:15,928
You know, the fact that you can say that with
with a straight face is impressive.

271
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:18,707
Let me ask you a question.

272
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:24,492
Does Atlantis have a retractable dome?
Or does everyone just swim around in
there like a bunch of fish?

273
00:24:24,604 --> 00:24:26,211
Don't mock me.

274
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:30,623
You think I don't know how absurd this sounds?

275
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:33,345
But you saw that siren.
Was that a joke?

276
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,543
Okay, so if Atlantis exists...
Then how come...

277
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:44,123
..our sub sonar or deep sea probe
hasn't been able to discover it?

278
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:48,043
because it's cloaked in a shroud no more
than technology can penetrate.

279
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:50,547
The Bermuda Triangle.

280
00:24:57,642 --> 00:25:00,094
Your father was a man of peace.

281
00:25:01,712 --> 00:25:05,261
They were others who wanted to
wage a war against the surface world.

282
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:08,217
Your father resisted.

283
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,667
And so what? They killed him?

284
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,912
Now they want me dead too.

285
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,781
A man should get you and your mother out.

286
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:23,228
The only place you would be safe was up here.

287
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:27,206
You were found on Mercy Reef,
by a young coast guard Lieutenant.

288
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:31,536
My dad.

289
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,891
Then he knows.

290
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:38,027
No.

291
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,922
Your mother insisted that we said nothing.

292
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,819
She probably thought
she could hide you from you true destiny.

293
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:48,920
Yeah, and what's my true destiny, huh?

294
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:55,530
To defend this world you've embraced as your own and protect the ocean from what you were born.

295
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:58,126
You want me to fight sirens
and standards oil.

296
00:25:58,246 --> 00:25:59,557
Is that it?

297
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,687
You know what? Forget it.

298
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:02,997
Find somebody else.
I'm not interested.

299
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:05,715
You can't avoid your responsibilities, Oren.

300
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:09,357
It's in your bones and you know it.

301
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,673
This is insane.

302
00:26:12,747 --> 00:26:14,932
I'm a dive shop owner.

303
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:17,970
I'm not the protector of the Seven Seas.

304
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:21,634
Destiny is like a riptide.

305
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:25,967
You never know what's pulling you in
until it's too late.

306
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:36,976
So this girl, Nadia, is actually a
killer mermaid who...

307
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:43,443
... wants to take you out because you're some
sort of under water royalty?

308
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:45,325
I'm quite sure, yeah.

309
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:48,420
Well, they all look so funny on the Starbuck's cups.

310
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,045
Well, I didn't believe it either until that
siren tried to kill me.

311
00:26:55,977 --> 00:26:58,300
She's coming back for me.

312
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:03,299
Then I suggest a road trip to the desert
with a truck full of Evian.

313
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:05,285
Eva.

314
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:09,191
I think she is the creature that attacked my mom.

315
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,771
I have to face her.

316
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:17,239
You're really serious about this.

317
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:23,000
You should close up for a couple of days...
Head out of town.

318
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,170
I don't want you cut in the middle of this.

319
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,655
And what about you?

320
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,474
I'm taking the Quint to Atlas Point.

321
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:32,605
McCaffery got weapons there.

322
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:41,014
Well, it looks like a storm is coming anyway.

323
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:44,047
Maybe I'll go and visit my sister in Tempa.

324
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:47,982
Look, I'm sorry about all this insanity.

325
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,835
Yeah, well, being a friend of yours always require a leap of faith.

326
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:56,576
Besides, some day you'll make it up
to me give me a cool title like...

327
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:59,548
"Duchess of the Deep"

328
00:28:24,357 --> 00:28:27,441
I don't know how you escaped from Atlantis.

329
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:30,139
But thank you for leading me to Oren.

330
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:36,253
It's good to see you back on your feet,
Lieutenant Torres.

331
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:38,805
Thank you, sir...
But I'm confused.

332
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:41,609
I already went over the accident
report with commandant Alley.

333
00:28:41,674 --> 00:28:43,854
I understand that but
I'm the one who ordered the mission.

334
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,657
I wanted to debrief you myself.

335
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,500
And who exactly do you work for?

336
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,092
Top of the all lieutenant.
Commandant in Chief.

337
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:57,026
I was curious about that flash of light that
you saw like before you lost control.

338
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:00,989
To be honest sir,
I was disoriented.

339
00:29:01,144 --> 00:29:02,872
That could've been a sun flair.

340
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,978
You wanna placate me.

341
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:07,070
I won't think you lost your mind.

342
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:09,926
After all, you were flying
over the Bermuda Triangle.

343
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:16,155
With all do respect, sir,
that's just a myth.

344
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:19,571
I used to share that sentiment.

345
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,854
And you changed your mind.

346
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:25,487
Why don't I show you?

347
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:32,471
Last year, this man, boarded
an oil platform...

348
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:34,396
...in Golf of México and
attempted to blow it sky high.

349
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:37,726
He was killed before he succeeded.

350
00:29:37,971 --> 00:29:39,872
His name was Evan Corday.

351
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,947
He disappeared along with his yacht.

352
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:47,494
Off the cost of Bermuda.
On July 6 1905.

353
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:52,694
It's impossible... It must have been a descendant
or somebody who looks like him.

354
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:55,644
I'd agree with you, except that the finger
prints were perfect match.

355
00:29:56,436 --> 00:29:58,425
And he's not the first one to come back.

356
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:02,197
Come back from where?

357
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:04,828
That's what the project Nova
aims to find out.

358
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,350
I want you to join us Lieutenant.

359
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,533
Help unlock the mysteries
of the Bermuda Triangle.

360
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:14,624
Sir, I'm a pilot... I don't know
if I had any experience I could offer.

361
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:18,823
You have more experience than any of us.

362
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:22,837
You witnessed something extraordinary out there
and you lived to tell the tale.

363
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:25,873
I don't believe a pilot with your impeccable
record can be taken out of the sky

364
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:28,913
by a sun flair or a freak mechanical failure Lieutenant.

365
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:33,269
Sir, I'm doing that to fly jets
and served my country.

366
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,120
Not chase windmills.

367
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,125
This is not a fool's crusade.

368
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:40,144
This is a matter of national security.

369
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:49,355
All these files contain pictures of people who
vanished in the Bermuda Triangle.

370
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:54,842
They are MRA's in an invisible war.
And Tempest Key is the final line.

371
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,333
Yeah?

372
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,260
I'll be right there.

373
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,746
If you want to see how real this is
come with me Lieutenant.

374
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,875
Eva you need to hit the road or you're never gonna
to make you out of here before the storm.

375
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,295
Once it's locked down, I'll go.

376
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,470
I don't want to come back and find out
our restaurant under water.

377
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,002
I got it, I got it...

378
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,001
So I want you taking care of business and...

379
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:20,507
...We should talk to the bank about
a lender upgrade to your boat.

380
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:23,372
Oh, great.

381
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,192
Power lines have blown over.

382
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,252
No, it must be the circuit breaker.

383
00:32:28,253 --> 00:32:30,385
Light is still on the cabin Jack's.

384
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,762
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?
- Yeah, trust me.

385
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,592
Would it kill you to hold the flash light steady?

386
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:46,801
It's very funny, Eva.

387
00:32:57,193 --> 00:32:59,325
Good night forever, Oren.

388
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:35,400
Eva.

389
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:40,528
Sorry about your friend.
But I'm more concerned about your life now.

390
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:43,470
McCaffery...
She got you, too?

391
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,016
Where is she taking us?

392
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:10,765
Home. To Atlantis.

393
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:13,349
To be executed.

394
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,083
Why haven't she got us already?

395
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:18,014
You're a symbol of hope, Oren.

396
00:34:19,122 --> 00:34:23,953
If they kill you,
that hope dies too.

397
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:31,660
- I need water.
- My flask, it's in my boot.

398
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,960
Smash it!

399
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:08,785
- How do we take her down?
- We are doing anything.

400
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:10,777
You're getting off this boat.

401
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:11,778
No!

402
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,867
No! That thing took my mom
and attacked my friend.

403
00:35:14,868 --> 00:35:16,262
I'm not going anywhere until she's dead.

404
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:19,750
I promised your father on his dying breath
that i will project you.

405
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,869
I'm not breaking my word now.

406
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:26,383
Do you have any weapons?

407
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:27,629
Nadia!

408
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,216
Your aim's got better.

409
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:54,602
- Where is Oren?
- Roast in hell you jelly bitch!

410
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,345
Now... Where is Oren ?

411
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:05,125
I'm right here.

412
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,927
Your mother can't protect you this time.

413
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:32,147
What did you do to her?

414
00:36:32,803 --> 00:36:34,566
You'll find out.

415
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:38,586
You're coming home, Oren.

416
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:41,603
Oren?

417
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:46,893
No!

418
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,126
Well done, Oren.

419
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,030
Your father would have been proud.

420
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:34,857
I'm sorry, Eva.

421
00:37:48,174 --> 00:37:50,926
<i>Feliz 1936 - Club Havana.</i>

422
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,679
How much do you remember Lieutenant Torres?

423
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:25,653
You know, that siren was just the beginning.

424
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:31,189
There're creatures in the deep you couldn't imagine
in your worst nightmares.

425
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:36,461
Oh, that's reassuring.
Thanks a lot.

426
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,970
I'm not here to make you feel good.

427
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:42,107
I'm here to prepare you for the worst.

428
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:44,310
Look, we should've started your training years ago.

429
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:49,786
And let's then do it.
It starts now.

430
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:52,901
I'm ready.

431
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:57,211
A birthday gift.

432
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:07,957
I kind of feel it's like a book.
I'm not really much a reader.

433
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,531
Just open it.

434
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:19,762
Henry the 4th :
Part 1 and 2.

435
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,453
I didn't really know Shakespeare
was in sequence.

436
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,542
I expect for you
to read them by next week.

437
00:39:27,516 --> 00:39:29,931
I gave up book reports
in sixth grade.

438
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:30,966
This is a part of your training.

439
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,600
Right, see, when you said training, I thought, you meant...

440
00:39:35,652 --> 00:39:38,662
You know, wielding tridents, and
doing cool stuff in the water.

441
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,415
All in due time.

442
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,153
Don't worry, there's plenty of sex and violence
in there that'll keep you interested.

443
00:39:45,352 --> 00:39:48,382
Could you just say the highlights?
And tell me how it ends?

444
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,181
The lesson isn't in the end, Oren.

445
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:53,555
It's in the journey.
