1
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,200
''Siegfried dealt the king a mortal blow.

2
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,900
''The sword drew blood from the wounds
and King Lindegast was saddened.

3
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,800
''He begged Siegfried to let him live
and offered him his lance.''

4
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,230
Bastian?

5
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,830
God!

6
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,460
Bastian!

7
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Hi, Dad.

8
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,460
Out of the pool, kids.

9
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,060
Stop horsing around.

10
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,830
Everybody, line up!

11
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,130
-Who wants to make the team?
-Me!

12
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,760
Good. Let's see who's got what it takes.

13
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,760
We're going to start with the high board.

14
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,960
Billy, go!

15
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,860
Bastian...

16
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,660
...you're next.

17
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,760
Go!

18
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,300
Bastian, go for it!

19
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,960
What's the matter?

20
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,160
l got a cramp.

21
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,060
High wimp factor.

22
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,860
Sorry, coach.

23
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,560
How did it go?

24
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,930
Did you make the swim team?

25
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,930
No.

26
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,360
What happened?

27
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,560
l didn't jump.

28
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,260
Why not?

29
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,130
l guess l...

30
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,500
...had a cramp.

31
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,730
Going out tonight?

32
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,730
Yeah. Technical sales staff seminar.

33
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,300
ls Ms. Station Wagon picking you up?

34
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,800
Why do you say that?

35
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,730
The tie.

36
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,630
Yeah.

37
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,030
Dressing is common courtesy, Bastian.

38
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,230
Something you must learn.
Look at that rag you're wearing.

39
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,430
-l like it.
-Well, l don't.

40
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,130
Mom made it!

41
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,800
You don't remember, do you?

42
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,600
l've gotta go.

43
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,960
Mr. Koreander?

44
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,760
Well, it's been a while.

45
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,360
-l dropped in to say hi.
-Hi.

46
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,760
Do you carry ''How-to'' books?

47
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,260
''How-to'' books?

48
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,260
Does this place look like a supermarket?

49
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,500
lf you want advice on buying real estate...

50
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,200
...or housebreaking your goldfish...

51
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,960
...go to the video store down the street.

52
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,360
What is it you want to know?

53
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,460
Something about heights.

54
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,260
How to be able to jump from a high...

55
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,460
...a very high...

56
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,460
...an extremely high diving board.

57
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,760
l'll look in my section on...

58
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,660
...courage.

59
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,960
We need your help.

60
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,730
Help us.

61
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,260
Please come back, Bastian.

62
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,230
'' The Neverending Story.''

63
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,560
Put it back!

64
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,930
That book asks too much of you.

65
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
But have you ever read a book twice?

66
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,230
Books change each time you read them.

67
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,900
-Give it back.
-l really want to read it again.

68
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,700
No, no. Look what l found for you.

69
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,360
Let me borrow it, please!

70
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,760
No, Bastian!

71
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,000
Auryn.

72
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,200
Bastian.

73
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,400
We need your help.

74
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,930
Come back to Fantasia.

75
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,230
We are in great danger.

76
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,700
Fantasia!

77
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,830
An Earthling to save the Childlike Empress!

78
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,360
Nimbly!

79
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,260
Enter, my spy.

80
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Mistress of Horok Castle,
l came as fast as l....

81
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,830
-You were saying?
-l could gain the boy's confidence.

82
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,860
l don't care about his confidence.
l want his wishes.

83
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,930
Tri Face!

84
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,460
The Memory Machine.
Explain it to him, Tri Face.

85
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,560
Yes, explain it!

86
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Every time the Earthling
uses Auryn to make a wish...

87
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,400
...my new invention
makes him lose a memory!

88
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,500
With each wish,
the liquid in his head forms a memory ball.

89
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,500
lt falls down and is collected...

90
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,130
...in the beaker below.

91
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,130
What happens when he has lost
all of his memories?

92
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,430
Obviously, the beaker at the bottom is full.

93
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,930
And the Earthling's head is empty.

94
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,030
He won't remember where he came from.

95
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,030
He won't remember his own world.

96
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,260
Why he came to Fantasia.

97
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,100
He will forget the Childlike Empress.

98
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,930
That's when l'll bring order to the chaos
they call dreams and stories.

99
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,560
Nimbly, go!

100
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,730
Make the Earthling wish.

101
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,860
Are you okay?

102
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,060
Fine. l'm fine.

103
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,030
My best landing yet.

104
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,630
Looks like you just got your wings.

105
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,530
No, l've always had them.

106
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,430
l'm Bastian.

107
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,900
Nimbly's the name, tour guide's the game!

108
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,900
Let me show you the sights of Silver City!

109
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,830
Watch out!

110
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,830
Pure acid!

111
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,900
Acid?

112
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,530
Fantasians will be grateful
if you wish for the lake to be filled...

113
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,860
...with crystal spring water instead.

114
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,700
What do you mean, if l would wish?

115
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,600
You have Auryn.

116
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,160
lt fulfills all of your wishes.

117
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,700
Too bad only one of these exists.

118
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,200
You want something. You wish it.

119
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,830
Auryn makes it happen.

120
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,700
You're very lucky.

121
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,160
Come on! Try it out.

122
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,060
Start with the lake. Make it purple.

123
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,160
Add some sugar.

124
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,160
Raise the temperature
so we can go swimming.

125
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,160
l don't know.
l'm sure there's a reason for the acid.

126
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,460
Maybe it keeps everything shiny.

127
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,660
l wouldn't want to change anything,
it's so pretty.

128
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,030
Come on, make a wish.

129
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Look!

130
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,430
Come on.

131
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,000
Everything seems fine in Fantasia.

132
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,900
Fine and dandy.

133
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,800
Why do you ask?

134
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,400
l have to see the Childlike Empress.

135
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,460
How far is it to the lvory Tower?

136
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,060
You mean, how many ways to get there?

137
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,260
No, l mean in distance.

138
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,360
Yards?

139
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,660
Miles?

140
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,300
Kilometers?

141
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,900
Everything's as close or as far...

142
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
...as you want it to be.

143
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,800
Nimbly?

144
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,200
-What are they?
-l didn't have time to ask.

145
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,560
-They look like giants.
-l can see that!

146
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,560
Come back.

147
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,630
Wish for our lives!

148
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,660
Acid!

149
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,860
Hey, silly boy!

150
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,860
Wish them away, for Fantasia's sake!

151
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,760
Wish them away, Bastian!

152
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,760
Nimbly!

153
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,730
Kids! Just wish!

154
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,060
Wish to be safe!

155
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,560
Well done, Bastian!

156
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,260
l'm safe.

157
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,060
You can get out of here.

158
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,760
l made it.

159
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,260
Where'd you go?

160
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,560
Look here. Who is this?

161
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,760
Nice entrance.

162
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,260
lt's an Earthling.

163
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,730
Yes, it is an Earthling.

164
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,630
You just taught some Giants
how to swim, Earthling.

165
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,200
Hi.

166
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,100
Hello.

167
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,700
l didn't mean to interrupt anything.

168
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,700
You have come to the Ship of Secret Plots.

169
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,260
''You were called by the Childlike Empress''

170
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,830
ls she all right?

171
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,660
ln my world, the Empress is now only...

172
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,100
...an empty page.

173
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,960
We haven't been able to reach her
for a long time.

174
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,030
Those who dared the journey
to the lvory Tower perished.

175
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,460
The very earth is breaking away.

176
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,130
Even us Mudwarts who are made of earth,
can't get there.

177
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,300
''The Earthling has come to help us
We must talk to the Empress''

178
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,460
Childlike Empress.

179
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,030
Bastian, you are the only Earthling
moved by our plight.

180
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,930
What's going on?

181
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,330
Are you hurt?

182
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,800
The same force that makes the books
in your world become empty...

183
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,100
...makes me a prisoner in my castle.

184
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,930
What is this force?

185
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,330
Only you can name it, Bastian.

186
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,730
Name it?

187
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,230
We are the creatures of human fantasies.

188
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,930
We need your dreams and stories to exist.

189
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,230
But the people in your world
no longer believe in us.

190
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,330
They have no time
to give us names and stories.

191
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,630
Tell me what l have to do!

192
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,230
There is....

193
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,730
You must resist....

194
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,160
Your answer.... Auryn will help you.

195
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,800
But you must remember if you use it....

196
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,560
Only you can save us, Bastian.

197
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,800
Only you can heal both
of our worlds. Bastian!

198
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,200
You are my last hope.

199
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,960
We must get everyone in Fantasia
to help us.

200
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,230
Now!

201
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
Bastian.

202
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,560
K. Koreander - Antique Bookstore

203
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,060
The Empress is being held prisoner.

204
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,760
Before we can fight the force holding her...

205
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,660
...l must give it a name.

206
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,860
Who will join me on my quest?

207
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,260
You saw the Giants, they're everywhere.

208
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,900
You can't hide.

209
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,060
There will be more Giants
who will destroy your beautiful ships!

210
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,760
l'm afraid.

211
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,960
lf you give up...

212
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,000
...it's not only the end of Silver City...

213
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,900
...it's the end of Fantasia.

214
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,800
Do you know what that means?

215
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,900
The children of my world
will have no more stories to read.

216
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Ever.

217
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,160
ls there no one with the courage
to stand up with me against the Giants?

218
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,160
Atreyu!

219
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Atreyu!

220
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,060
Bastian!

221
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,160
Welcome back.

222
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,200
How did you....

223
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,760
ln my dreams l saw a light over Silver City
and l knew there was hope.

224
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,000
But l did not expect to find you.

225
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,500
Were you in danger?

226
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,060
-Did you see the Giants?
-Where do they come from?

227
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,560
People talk about a castle
shaped like a hand.

228
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,760
Some say that's where
the Giants come from.

229
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,260
That's where we should go.

230
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,660
There are burning arrows of light
all around it.

231
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,360
Do you know of a castle
that looks like a hand?

232
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,060
You mean Horok Castle, the Seeing Hand?
Sure!

233
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,960
Do you know how to get there?

234
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,460
There are no roads. You'll have to fly.

235
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,460
But a little wish would go a long way.

236
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,460
A wish?

237
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,460
Nimbly's right. l have Auryn.

238
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,130
-l should use it.
-When l'm right, l'm right.

239
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,430
l'll try it.

240
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,430
l need something...

241
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,200
...something that...

242
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,600
...can fly...

243
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,630
...and that can scare the pants off
anything living in that castle.

244
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,460
Very sensible.

245
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,060
l'll wish for the most horrible flying dragon
in the history of Fantasia!

246
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,960
l wish him to be red. No, green.

247
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,830
l wish him to fly as fast as the Concorde
and stinks so bad...

248
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,460
...that he makes you sick!

249
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,460
And breathes fire.

250
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,330
l'll call him Smerg.

251
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,330
Maybe you should wish
for some modifications.

252
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,060
Oh, no!

253
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,460
Oh, yes!

254
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,360
We can't let it loose on Fantasia.
Who knows what it might do.

255
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,100
-What are you going to do?
-Chase it!

256
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Chase?

257
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,130
Did somebody say ''chase''?

258
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,330
Falkor!

259
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Boy, am l glad to see you!

260
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,260
And l'm glad to see you.

261
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,100
What are we waiting for?

262
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,200
l've got an itch behind my ear.

263
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,360
Go for it, Falkor!

264
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,330
Look! The castle that looks like a hand.

265
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,630
A very mean hand.

266
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,300
Hold on.

267
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,160
Smerg got zapped.

268
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,060
We got to find Atreyu.

269
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,460
l got to get some rest.

270
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,530
Hey!

271
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,300
Watch it, folks!

272
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,530
Rockbiter!

273
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,130
Rockbiter!

274
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,530
You'll wake him up.

275
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,000
Meet Junior.

276
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,700
ls this yum-yum rockie?

277
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,200
Let me try.

278
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,960
Junior...

279
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,960
...when are you going to learn...

280
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,460
...the difference between a rock...

281
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,560
...and a nose?

282
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,800
Why was Junior crying?

283
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,500
He's hungry.

284
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Hungry?

285
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,900
With all these rocks around?

286
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,730
l don't understand it...

287
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,730
...myself...

288
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,230
...but all...

289
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:04,500
...goodness has gone out of the rocks.

290
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,430
...have turned empty.

291
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,630
There's nothing left...

292
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,700
...to nourish us.

293
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,100
lt's all part of the same thing.

294
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,930
You're fighting a losing battle,
Childlike Empress.

295
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,760
Soon your slick little castle...

296
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,830
...will be as dark as mine.

297
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,860
l didn't break the window!

298
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,330
Don't lie to me!

299
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,760
You promised to take me swimming.
You promised.

300
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,230
Something's come up.

301
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,800
l hate you! l hate you!

302
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
So that's what humans remember.

303
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,660
That's a memory Bastian has lost!

304
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,030
Excuse me.

305
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,660
What can l do for you?

306
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,660
Do you know Bastian? Bastian Bux?

307
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,860
Do we ever really know anybody?

308
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,060
l'm Bastian's father. Barney.

309
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,460
l found this book in my son's room.

310
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,460
Your address is inside the cover.

311
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,030
Really?

312
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,230
Where?

313
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,700
l don't understand.

314
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,900
l saw it there last night.

315
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,560
Look, l'm an engineer.

316
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,660
What l see is what l see when l see it.

317
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,760
lt's an interesting concept.

318
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,200
My son's missing since last night.

319
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Heavy reading for a young man.

320
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,800
When did you last see him?

321
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,560
Maybe you'll find the explanation
for his disappearance...

322
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,360
...inside.

323
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,800
We were getting worried about you.

324
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,160
Where have you been?

325
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,400
l convinced some warriors
to help us take the castle.

326
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,300
Warriors?

327
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,800
Where are they?

328
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,400
Right here.

329
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,230
Atreyu, get real!

330
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,360
But l am real!

331
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,830
What do you mean, ''get real''?

332
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,930
Forget it. lt's a joke.

333
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,630
Being real is a joke in your world?

334
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,130
Yeah!

335
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,960
What's in the bag?

336
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,300
Our army.

337
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,860
Come here.

338
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,860
Never mind. You'll grow into it.

339
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,130
And so will you.

340
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,660
The machine's working out well, isn't it?

341
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,160
lt would work better if you were out there
making the Earthling wish.

342
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,860
lt's so cold out there.

343
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,860
That's the plan.

344
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,460
lt's dangerous, but it just might work.

345
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,460
lt has to work.

346
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,160
l'm glad you came back to Fantasia.

347
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
l am, too.

348
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,660
What if something happens to you?

349
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,060
Somebody must miss you in your world.

350
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,660
Nobody misses me.

351
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,460
But what about you?

352
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,230
Don't you miss somebody?

353
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,200
The only one l miss...

354
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,400
...isn't there.

355
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,260
Who's that?

356
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,100
My mom.

357
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,200
Look.

358
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,530
The lvory Tower.

359
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,160
Now it's a prison.

360
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,430
We may never see the Empress again.

361
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,800
Right now...

362
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,330
...all we have are memories.

363
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,400
Bastian.

364
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,560
ln your world...

365
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,860
...if The Neverending Story...

366
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,500
...is fading...

367
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,130
...no child will ever know...

368
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,830
...about Junior.

369
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,800
They'll never ride the prairie with me?

370
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,130
They'll never ride
through the clouds with me?

371
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,230
lf humans...

372
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,130
...forget about us...

373
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,500
...nobody will think...

374
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,830
...for Junior to do.

375
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,730
No!

376
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,900
We won't let that happen.

377
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,360
Bastian, here!

378
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,000
Atreyu, quick, help me!

379
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,300
l'm burning! lt hurts!

380
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
l can't breathe!

381
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,230
Are you all right?

382
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,030
You saved my life, Atreyu.

383
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,360
Yes. But you would have done
the same for me.

384
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,060
Sure.

385
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,360
What's happening?

386
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,860
The beams! They've destroyed the beams!

387
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,900
Fix it!

388
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,100
Do you remember what to say?

389
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Yeah.

390
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,000
Make it loud.

391
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,960
The Earthling Bastian Balthazar Bux...

392
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,860
...and Atreyu...

393
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,660
...the warrior from the Great Plains--

394
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,760
ls that what you call loud in your world?

395
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,260
The Earthling Bastian Balthazar Bux...

396
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,760
...and Atreyu,
the warrior from the Great Plains...

397
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,360
...demand to see the master of this castle!

398
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,260
That should get somebody's attention.

399
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,760
Guess whose?

400
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,260
Do they make strong gates in Fantasia?

401
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,260
Keep talking.

402
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,960
Keep talking!

403
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,900
Hi.

404
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,730
You're probably wondering why l'm here.

405
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,630
That's a reasonable question.

406
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,860
ln the past we've had our differences...

407
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,130
...but l'm sure they can be worked out.

408
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,630
lt all gets back to us
starting to communicate, right?

409
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,030
There's all kinds of communication.

410
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,360
Some do it with a look.

411
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,960
Some do it with a smile.

412
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,660
Some do it with...

413
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,930
...a sickle.

414
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,960
l read that somewhere. l like to read.

415
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,860
You're probably not interested.

416
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,360
You probably hate books.

417
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,600
Eggs? Eggs will do us a lot of good!

418
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,130
Wham-Bos, go!

419
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,160
Now's your chance, go!

420
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,800
What about them?

421
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,160
-lt's a good day to die.
-Don't say that!

422
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,600
-Give me five!
-Five what?

423
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,730
Forget it! l'll see you inside.

424
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,730
l wish there was some other way in.

425
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,900
l wish for another step!

426
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,930
And another one.

427
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,330
And another.

428
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,160
And another one.

429
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,630
Nice. Very nice.

430
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,630
Giants!

431
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,230
l wish for another one!

432
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,460
And another!

433
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,300
Atreyu!

434
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,630
Try to swing around.

435
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,660
lt won't work.

436
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,830
The chain.

437
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,460
Grab it!

438
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,400
Pull!

439
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,200
Pull!

440
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,930
Come on, pull!

441
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,460
We need weapons!

442
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,060
l wish for a spraycan.

443
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,030
That's a weapon in your world?

444
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,660
People use it against walls.

445
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,860
Those walls must be dangerous.

446
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,460
l don't believe what we have done.

447
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,130
l do.

448
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,200
The Giants are empty.

449
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,760
They're hollow and empty.

450
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,060
Like the Rockbiter's stones...

451
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,900
...and the pages of The Neverending Story.

452
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,160
l know what threatens Fantasia.

453
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,060
You have found its name?

454
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,460
lt's the Emptiness.

455
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,500
The Earthling knows about the Emptiness.

456
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
He's stronger than we thought.

457
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,730
Perhaps threatening him with Giants
isn't the way.

458
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:45,160
Time for a change of tactics.

459
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,960
What does the Emptiness look like?

460
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,030
How does it fight?

461
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:14,630
l think we're about to find out.

462
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,060
l wish for the doors to open!

463
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,960
l am Xayide.

464
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,760
This is my castle.

465
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,000
And the Giants?

466
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,700
They were mine.

467
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,000
But you have conquered them.

468
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,900
l admit defeat.

469
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,700
l have defeated you?

470
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,500
We.

471
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,900
That someone so young could be so clever.

472
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,030
You make everything empty.

473
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,400
l control all that is empty.

474
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,400
Just to control things,
you destroy stories and books?

475
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,800
l'm trying to bring order
to the chaos of Fantasia.

476
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,500
Am l wrong?

477
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,800
You certainly are! l demand that you free
the Childlike Empress!

478
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,530
-l can't.
-Why not?

479
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,000
l've isolated her forever.

480
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,430
You made the spell and you can undo it!

481
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,030
Not from here l can't.

482
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,630
So we'll go to the lvory Tower.

483
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,730
l will not leave my castle.

484
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:55,130
-You will.
-Out of the question.

485
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,930
Perhaps she feels it's a good day to die.

486
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,430
Do you?

487
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,830
You leave me no choice, my lord.

488
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,930
Bastian?

489
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,030
''As Mr. Koreander searched
for a book on courage...

490
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,160
''...Bastian picked up
The Neverending Story. ''

491
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,960
Mr. Koreander?

492
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,260
''lf the pages of The Neverending Story
were fading...

493
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,560
''...no one would read about Falkor,
or Atreyu...

494
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,560
''...or the Childlike Empress.

495
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,160
''Bastian was the only one
who could save Fantasia...

496
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,460
''...and all the stories in the world.

497
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,960
''He had to do it, at any price. ''

498
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,760
Move it, dummy!

499
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,560
l should say not.

500
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,660
l am not going to carry that woman.

501
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,260
My X obile will do just fine, gentlemen.

502
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:49,430
Would you ride with me, my lord?

503
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,030
Sure.

504
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,230
Come, then.

505
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:05,300
Welcome aboard.

506
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,030
Away!

507
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:10,860
We cannot leave him alone with her.

508
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,060
There was no ''For Sale'' sign this morning!

509
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,300
This is one sophisticated operation.

510
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,400
This morning this place was filled
with books, wall to wall!

511
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,900
Looks like there hasn't been
a bookstore here for a long time.

512
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,560
Are you sure it's the right address?

513
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,460
l'm not the type of person
to make things up.

514
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,500
l'm an engineer.
What l see is what l see....

515
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,300
We'll do what we can, Mr. Bux.

516
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,730
Don't you understand?

517
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:21,830
Atreyu's been jealous of you
since the first day you arrived here.

518
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,630
Why would he feel this way?
He's a great warrior.

519
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:28,200
Yes, but you have been chosen
to wear Auryn.

520
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,530
You may have to learn that some people
are not as grateful as others.

521
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,330
l want to express my gratitude...

522
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,130
...for the generosity you've shown me.

523
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,930
What is it?

524
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,930
lt's a belt that makes its wearer invisible.

525
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,830
Want to try it on?

526
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,460
Okay.

527
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,500
This is weird.

528
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,400
What's the matter?

529
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,930
l can't see myself.

530
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,660
l can't even see the belt.

531
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,460
What if l can't take it off?.

532
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,900
Use a wish.

533
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,800
l don't like this.

534
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,200
l wish....

535
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,160
You wish to be visible again?

536
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,400
Yes.

537
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,000
This is neat.

538
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,830
lt may come in handy.

539
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,760
Bastian!

540
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,400
Come here!

541
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,600
Don't be long. You'll catch a cold.

542
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,400
l'll be right back.

543
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,760
What's wrong?

544
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,360
l want to show you something.

545
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,660
Look. Tracks of the X obile,
footprints of Artax.

546
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,360
What are you saying?

547
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,860
We're going around in circles.

548
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,460
But the countryside has been changing.

549
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,960
lt doesn't make sense.

550
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,760
lt does to someone who doesn't want us
closer to the lvory Tower.

551
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,760
Xayide says we're nearly there.

552
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,660
Bastian, l'm waiting!

553
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,660
Just a moment.

554
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:38,960
She's our prisoner, Bastian.
Don't let her order you around.

555
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,860
How can you believe her?

556
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,660
How can we be sure she'll help us free
the Childlike Empress?

557
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,660
-l don't trust her.
-l can tell when someone lies to me.

558
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,560
And l can tell when
someone is up to no good.

559
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,660
She's totally under my control.
Don't worry.

560
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,330
''Bastian's head emptied with every wish.

561
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,230
''He hardly remembered his father...

562
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:42,560
''...who was worried sick
over his son's disappearance. ''

563
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,560
l'm in this book?

564
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,560
''Atreyu was worried too.

565
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,660
''The journey to the lvory Tower
was going nowhere.

566
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,260
''As he tried once again
to talk sense into Bastian...

567
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,960
''...he was to learn even more
about Xayide's scheme. ''

568
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,760
Show me the coin trick again.

569
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,760
l've shown you a million times.

570
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:12,160
lt must be the smoke in here.
lt's hard to remember things.

571
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,200
Why remember things
when you can wish for them?

572
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,800
What should l wish for?

573
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,860
What about juggling?
Wouldn't you enjoy that?

574
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,200
lf you wish for it you can.

575
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,560
l wish it.

576
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:54,830
''Then the darkness lifted
and she could see her way home.

577
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:58,630
''So the princess returned
to her father's castle.

578
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:02,530
''And they all lived happily ever after. ''

579
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,900
Don't be afraid, Bastian.

580
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:21,600
We're all part of a neverending story.

581
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,200
We are?

582
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,100
Even if we die?

583
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,400
Yes, Bastian, we are.

584
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,360
That's good to know.

585
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,060
That's good to know.

586
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,230
From what you tell me...

587
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:00,830
...the Emptiness has found its way
into Bastian's head.

588
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:03,030
lt's Auryn, isn't it?

589
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:06,030
lt works differently with humans
than with us.

590
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,930
Because humans need memories.

591
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,030
So what l saw...

592
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,860
...was a memory.

593
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,100
lf Bastian's so clever,
why can't he see what's happening?

594
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,600
Bastian is losing himself with every wish.

595
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,630
He must be stopped, or Fantasia's lost.

596
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,360
l'll take Auryn away from him by force,
if necessary.

597
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:00,630
He can't be allowed
to make one more wish.

598
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:05,730
l'll have to do it tonight.
Tomorrow we might be Xayide's prisoners.

599
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:13,500
Don't go to him in anger.
Go and warn him.

600
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,100
He's your friend, isn't he?

601
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,130
You're right.

602
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,260
He is my friend.

603
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:34,330
You're right. He has turned against me.

604
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:36,430
You need to protect yourself.

605
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:40,030
There could be Giants to take care of you...

606
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:43,030
...if you wish.

607
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:17,830
Stand guard!

608
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,430
Thief!

609
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,530
-l've come to warn you.
-Liar!

610
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,600
-Don't you ever say that to me!
-lt's true!

611
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,030
You're jealous that l have Auryn,
and you've come to take it from me.

612
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,300
l have not!

613
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:38,930
l overheard you talking to Falkor,
so don't try and make excuses.

614
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:44,530
You've gone mad, Bastian. Give me Auryn.

615
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:46,560
She wants me to have it.

616
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,560
You don't understand anything.
Go back and play with your buffaloes...

617
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,760
...country boy!

618
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:55,360
Why don't you go back and play hero
in your own world, Earthling?

619
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,860
Every time you use Auryn,
you lose one of your memories.

620
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,030
Xayide has...

621
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,660
...a machine that collects them.

622
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:15,730
-l would have seen it--
-l have seen it.

623
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:18,230
lt's in the roof of the X obile.

624
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:24,860
A few more wishes,
and the Emptiness will possess you.

625
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,700
Give me Auryn before it's too late!

626
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,560
You brought this on yourself!

627
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,930
You've only two wishes to go.

628
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:30,530
But, my lord....

629
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:35,960
l didn't mean it.

630
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,760
Falkor!

631
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,260
Atreyu, l'm sorry!

632
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,360
Take me to Atreyu!

633
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,560
Giants!

634
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,200
My son on a horse?

635
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,400
He can't ride a horse.

636
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:28,830
Who told the boy?

637
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:32,330
lt's Nimbly's fault.
He's always hanging around the machine.

638
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:36,360
Thanks for nothing.
lt's nice to have someone to count on.

639
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,360
l do the counting around here.

640
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,760
lt's your fault.

641
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:41,760
One...

642
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,360
...two...

643
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,600
...three!

644
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,260
''As he sank beneath the water, he knew...

645
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,900
''...that as punishment for killing Atreyu...

646
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,200
''...he would die himself. ''

647
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,230
Don't buy it, Bastian. Swim! Fight!

648
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:35,430
Yes!

649
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:39,230
According to the machine,
he has two wishes left.

650
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:41,430
There must be something wrong with it.

651
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:43,160
lt's working perfectly.

652
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:46,500
Whatever you tried didn't work.
He didn't make a wish!

653
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,830
He will.

654
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,260
lt's time.

655
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,060
Time to choose sides.

656
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,460
''Xayide and her Giants...

657
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,560
''...drove into the underworld of Fantasia.

658
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,560
''Here they could travel
with the speed of darkness...

659
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,860
''...which was faster
than the speed of light.

660
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,860
''They would find Bastian in no time
and force him to make his last wish. ''

661
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,560
Go on, Bastian.

662
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:44,460
Keep trying.

663
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,660
Don't forget me, Bastian.

664
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,560
''Possessed by a deep, dreamless sleep...

665
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,760
''...he couldn't hear
the Childlike Empress's plea. ''

666
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,230
Mr. Bastian, wait!

667
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,930
l won't hurt you.

668
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,900
l've come to help you.

669
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,200
You don't give up, do you?

670
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,900
You expect me to believe you?

671
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,060
Yes, Mr. Bastian.

672
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,960
You have to.

673
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,330
l saw...

674
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,760
...one of your memories.

675
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:15,300
lt made me feel something.

676
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:23,260
l learned...

677
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,060
...that we're all part...

678
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:30,100
...of a neverending story.

679
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,300
Bastian, try to remember it.

680
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:36,830
Unless we stop Xayide...

681
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,530
...the story will end.

682
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:43,330
That's why l'm here.

683
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,530
Tell me where to find Falkor.

684
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,200
At the Silver City.

685
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,800
But you won't like what you see.

686
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:06,330
How do l get there?

687
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,400
Behind those rocks...

688
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,160
...you'll find a path through the mountains.

689
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,730
On the other side...

690
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:19,630
...keep the sun on your back.

691
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,830
Follow your shadow for half a day.

692
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:27,830
Don't turn 'round.
The Emptiness will be on your heels.

693
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:31,660
Come with me.

694
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:40,000
l got the part of a spy
in this story, Mr. Bastian.

695
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,000
And he who spies and flies away...

696
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,600
...lives to spy another day.

697
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,430
Hurry, Mr. Bastian!

698
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,630
Keep the sun on your back!

699
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:08,900
''Alone once again, Bastian wandered,
determined to find Falkor.

700
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:14,460
''Climbing on a heap of black
and metal sheets and pilings...

701
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,760
''...he hardly recognized
the once proud and famous Silver City. ''

702
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,330
l thought we'd never see you again.

703
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:50,430
Where have you been?

704
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:11,060
l have two wishes left, Falkor.

705
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,060
Well, if you use those wishes...

706
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:19,300
...you will have lost
your most precious memories.

707
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,260
My mother...

708
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,600
...and my father.

709
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,200
My mother...

710
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,000
...would have wanted it this way.

711
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,260
l wish for nothing more
than for Atreyu to live!

712
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,960
l'm sorry for what happened.

713
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:13,960
Can you forgive me?

714
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:18,960
Friends?

715
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,660
Friends.

716
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,760
Bastian made a wish, didn't he?

717
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,460
He gave you a very special memory.

718
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,260
Your mother would have been proud.

719
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,660
Who?

720
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:45,160
Falkor, you shouldn't have let him.

721
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:07,060
You're outnumbered and outdone, Bastian.

722
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,930
And you have only one wish left.

723
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:14,460
So use what's left of your brain
and wish to go home.

724
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,530
That's where you belong.

725
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:18,630
lf l use my last wish--

726
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,530
Fantasia will be forgotten.

727
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,900
The Childlike Empress will be gone forever.

728
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,560
Go home...

729
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,960
...and leave Fantasia to me.

730
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:33,060
l won't betray the Childlike Empress!

731
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,360
Very well.

732
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:37,360
But how will your father feel
if he never sees you again?

733
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,000
My father....

734
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,460
Make your wish.

735
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:54,500
Wish to go home.

736
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,160
Yes, Xayide, l will make my last wish.

737
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,700
l wish...

738
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,460
...for you to have a heart.

739
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,300
You have found the only wish...

740
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,400
...powerful enough to save us, Bastian.

741
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:03,360
The Emptiness cannot be destroyed.

742
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,260
lt had to be filled with love.

743
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:09,500
And Auryn?

744
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,600
lt's only a mirror of what's inside you.

745
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:14,830
Courage comes from the heart...

746
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:16,830
...not from symbols.

747
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:21,500
lf you've found courage, you can go home...

748
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,360
...and heal both our worlds.

749
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,000
l can't go home.

750
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:40,860
-That's the way home?
-Yes.

751
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,530
The only way.

752
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,600
You found courage.

753
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,430
Bastian, you have. You've found courage.

754
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:02,830
My father. That's his voice.

755
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,160
Now make a wish from your heart.

756
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:14,030
l wish to go home...

757
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,760
...and tell my dad...

758
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,360
...that l love him.

759
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:26,260
Good luck, Bastian.

760
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:28,460
Good luck!

761
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,760
You can do it, Bastian.

762
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:35,230
-l was worried about you.
-l'm sorry.

763
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:37,760
You're back.

764
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:43,060
You helped me, didn't you?

765
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,560
You heard me?

766
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,230
Of course l heard you.

767
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,000
