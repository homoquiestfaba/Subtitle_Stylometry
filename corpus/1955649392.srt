3
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:16,937
All right, boys. Here we go.

4
00:03:17,603 --> 00:03:19,139
Nice and easy.

5
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,662
Oh, man, Mitch, if you weren't here...

6
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:22,629
I'm always here.

7
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,431
Don't worry, your friend's
gonna be all right.

8
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:25,832
Are you Batman?

9
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:29,150
Sure, pal. Just bigger and browner.

10
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:31,404
- All right, boys, get him in.
- Have a good run, Mitch.

11
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:33,054
All right, Steph.

12
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,878
- Yeah, Mitch.
- Yo, Eros.

13
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:38,979
How's it looking out there?

14
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,648
Lippers are feebs today. Just eggy.

15
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:43,416
Ah, eggy beyond, brah.

16
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:45,885
Nuggin' higher outside
than a full-on gazebo.

17
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,131
- Good call, brah.
- Come on.

18
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:52,639
- All right, brah-brah!
- It's just brah.

19
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:55,962
- Come on, Pete.
- Hey, Mitch!

20
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,831
I told you, you don't
have to do this every day.

21
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,732
I want to. You saved my sister's life.

22
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:01,001
You think I'm gonna forget that?

23
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:03,569
All right. Well, listen, tomorrow
make my pecs a little bigger.

24
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:04,638
And don't cover up my front bump.

25
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,307
You got it. Huge dick.

26
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:07,707
Big dick.

27
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,343
- Yo, Ellerbee.
- Hey, Mitch.

28
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:11,444
Hey, come on, man, why don't
you leave my boys alone,

29
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:13,713
and get off this big wheel
and come join me for a run?

30
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:14,948
What are you saying,
that I need to work out?

31
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:16,050
That I'm, what, looking smaller?

32
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,018
No! You're looking big.

33
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:18,819
I don't know how you
fit in that uniform, man.

34
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,853
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey, hey!

35
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,588
If I had a sister, I'd
introduce you to her, man.

36
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,938
You all right, all right.

37
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,093
Wait, was that sarcastic?

38
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:28,109
Like calling a tall guy "Shorty"?

39
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:30,864
Damn it, he always does that to me.

40
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:33,333
I heard he invented Google
and gave it all to charity.

41
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,502
Man, I heard he invented
the cure for the common cold.

42
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:38,605
He ain't Superman, he's
a damn county lifeguard.

43
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:40,655
Grown man wears spandex to work.

44
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:43,124
So does Superman.

45
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,157
Hey, fuck you! Get off my beach!

46
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,483
I don't even have to stretch
to guard you. Let's go.

47
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:51,998
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

48
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,828
Ahh! Not on my beach, Arian!

49
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,362
- What up, Vern?
- What's up, Mitch?

50
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:03,831
He saved my nana's life.
I ever tell you about that?

51
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:05,499
Every time he jogs by.

52
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,381
Literally, every single time.

53
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,020
Hi, Mitch.

54
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:39,882
Subtitles by explosiveskull.

55
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,670
Flakka. Jesus.

56
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,139
Hey, what's up, buddy?

57
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,973
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey, can I see that?

58
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:48,421
Ah...

59
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,845
- Where'd you get this?
- Right there.

60
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:54,081
Right there, huh? Is this the only one?

61
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:55,795
All right.

62
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:03,790
You could go over there, you
could go the fuck over there,

63
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,192
get the fuck out of here!

64
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:06,860
What part of "private"
do you not understand?

65
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,210
Hey, hey. What's up, boys?

66
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,010
Ah...

67
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:14,448
- Beach belongs to everybody.
- Nothing belongs to everybody.

68
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:15,935
That's not nice.

69
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:19,038
- There are killer waves, boys. Go shred.
- It's on.

70
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:21,121
- Later, Mitch.
- All right, brah.

71
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:24,125
Ah, you don't want to do that, big dog.

72
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:27,228
I'm an animal lover,
but I will put you down.

73
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,456
Frankie! Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

74
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:36,689
Frankie, stop.

75
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,505
Don't you know he's a friend?

76
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:42,829
What a terrible, terrible way to meet.

77
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,831
- You're Lieutenant Buchannon, right?
- I am.

78
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:47,800
Victoria Leeds, the new
owner of the Huntley Club.

79
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,636
Of course. I know exactly who you are.

80
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,004
Oh?

81
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:53,473
- Well, welcome to Emerald Bay.
- Thank you so much.

82
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:55,719
I heard you were a head-turner.
What an understatement that is.

83
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:00,047
And I heard you were a charmer.
Guess that's an understatement, too.

84
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,427
Nah...

85
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:05,619
Um, I apologize for Frankie.

86
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,756
I know this beach is public and,
honestly, I wish the club was, too.

87
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:13,526
- But you, you're welcome anytime.
- Thank you very much.

88
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:15,508
- I'll see you around?
- Yes, you will.

89
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,838
Okay, I get that you have to
test for image stabilization,

90
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:26,273
but why'd we have to come to the beach?

91
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:27,307
You know I hate the beach.

92
00:07:27,387 --> 00:07:29,543
Besides, I got to get back
to work at the Huntley.

93
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:32,612
Well, I'm sorry, man, but the beach
is important, okay? It's, uh...

94
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,715
It's, you know, the wind and the, uh...

95
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:37,264
Just...

96
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:01,841
Oh... I get it.

97
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:04,144
- I get it now, okay. I get it.
- Who... What, C.J.?

98
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:06,213
No, I didn't even know she
was working on the beach today.

99
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:07,547
"I didn't know C.J. was working."

100
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,629
- Shut up, Dave.
- Hey, Ronnie.

101
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:11,250
Ha...

102
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,632
It's Ronnie, right?

103
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:15,821
What the fuck? Yeah, it's Ronnie.

104
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:17,156
- I'm Dave.
- Hi, Dave.

105
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:18,658
- Nice to meet you.
- C.J. How you doing?

106
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm doing all right.

107
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,171
You're trying out today, right?

108
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:25,612
I saw your name on the
board. That's how I...

109
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:28,834
Say... Say something.

110
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:30,181
Kinda feel like this is your year.

111
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:32,817
Stop that.

112
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,322
Okay. Um...

113
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:38,812
Well, I'll see you at tryouts.

114
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,025
Eh... All right, C.J.

115
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:43,283
That was amazing to watch.

116
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:45,633
She came up to you, she
was very nice and warm.

117
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:48,922
And you handled it really smoothly.

118
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:51,091
- Really?
- Fuck, no. That was awkward.

119
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,192
- It was horrible.
- Fuck!

120
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:54,674
Did you have a stroke? It
felt like you had a stroke.

121
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:36,216
Hey, I'm Matt Brody.

122
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:39,253
And not a single fuck was given.

123
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:41,055
Ooh!

124
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,648
- Hey, Ronnie.
- Oh, hey, Steph.

125
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:50,017
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

126
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:51,051
Third time's a charm, right?

127
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:52,966
Yeah, yeah, you know, I'm...

128
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,187
Hey.

129
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,554
I'm more motivated than ever.

130
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:59,326
So you just need to fill out
this form and take off your shirt.

131
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:04,445
Ahh... My shirt. No, I don't... Ugh.

132
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:07,200
No one wants to see that.

133
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,716
Take it off.

134
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:12,052
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course.

135
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:18,057
Ooh!

136
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:21,528
Wow. Nice nipple-fros, bro. Damn!

137
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:23,260
Hey, does anyone have a weed whacker?

138
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,053
We got a comedian on the line.
What's your name, funny guy?

139
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,202
- I'm Zane.
- You're Zane.

140
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,504
Why don't you step out of my line, Zane?

141
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:33,374
- Okay.
- Okay.

142
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:37,029
You need to understand one
thing, Zane. We're a family here.

143
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,645
A team. And we support each other.

144
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:43,102
- You're out.
- Come on, I'm... I'm Zane.

145
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:47,086
- Get the fuck off my beach.
- Okay. Okay.

146
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:53,459
So you're going to make me guess your name?

147
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:56,216
Are you following me?

148
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,066
I was actually just going
to ask you the same thing.

149
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,135
Okay. Look, you're hot.

150
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,959
I may resist for a while, but we
both know eventually I'll give in.

151
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,360
So why don't we just skip that.

152
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,409
Why don't you put a baby in me?

153
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:13,113
- Now.
- You know, honestly...

154
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,649
I was thinking dinner first.

155
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,171
But we could try the
baby thing, if you want.

156
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,172
You are trying. Way too hard.

157
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:21,273
Trying's the best part.

158
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:22,442
- Summer.
- Hi.

159
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:23,509
I was hoping we'd see you here.

160
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,012
I couldn't sleep last
night. I am so excited.

161
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,179
Hey, it's your day today, Summer.

162
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:29,148
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

163
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,283
Hey, fresh face. You
here for the qualifiers?

164
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:33,452
Uh, no, no, I'm not trying out.

165
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:34,888
I'm actually already on the team.

166
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:36,022
You're already on this team?

167
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:38,572
I'm Matt Brody. Ready for duty.

168
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:40,793
"Ready for duty"? Oh, okay.

169
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:42,328
Um, you got any papers
or anything like that?

170
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,677
I do. There you go.

171
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,234
Oh, it's a permission slip.
Literally. "Dear Mitch,

172
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:50,070
"I am pleased to write you
on behalf of Mr. Matt Brody."

173
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,438
- Right. Well, no free passes.
- Yeah. Whoa.

174
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,775
At all. Yeah, 'cause I don't give a shit.

175
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:58,110
I legit needed those for my taxes.

176
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,181
What you need is to understand that
if you're going to be on this team,

177
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:02,381
- you got to earn it.
- Really?

178
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:04,784
Yeah. So, why don't we
start this whole thing over,

179
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:06,086
just like gentlemen?

180
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,287
Where you from, One Direction?

181
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,321
Um... Iowa?

182
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:10,890
- Iowa?
- You heard of it?

183
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,957
Yeah, I know what it is.

184
00:12:12,037 --> 00:12:12,893
- Hey, Steph.
- Hey.

185
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:14,427
New Kids on the Block here is from Iowa.

186
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:15,394
Oh, man.

187
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:17,397
And, uh, he says he's already on the team.

188
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:18,999
- Yeah.
- Doesn't have to try out.

189
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,466
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

190
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:22,369
Let me ask you this...
A lot of oceans in Iowa?

191
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:25,871
No, just ponds and lakes and
cocky pretty boys, apparently.

192
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:27,340
Uh-huh. Cocky pretty boys.

193
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,808
Hey, Mitch, what happened to that

194
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:30,143
last pretty boy recruit we had?

195
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:31,510
- He died.
- R.I.P.

196
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,446
Are you guys being serious right now?

197
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:35,282
I honestly can't tell.

198
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:37,484
You show up here, matching bathing suits.

199
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:39,519
What is this, "lifeguard hazing"?

200
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,854
I'm Matt Brody.

201
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,455
I hold the world record in the 200 meter.

202
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:43,823
Two gold medals.

203
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,591
- Hey! Matt Brody.
- Matt Brody.

204
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:46,960
Yes, yes.

205
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,227
Absolutely. And we still

206
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:49,495
- don't give a fuck.
- Don't give a fuck.

207
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:52,298
No, fresh out. Fresh out of fucks. Yeah.

208
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:54,500
Okay, that ocean out there has riptides

209
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,302
that'll tear your little mangina in two.

210
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:58,038
My mangina?

211
00:12:58,118 --> 00:12:59,371
So you are being serious.

212
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:01,073
Dead serious, right now, NSYNC, all right?

213
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:03,243
This ain't no little
fucking pond out of Iowa.

214
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:04,344
So with all due respect,

215
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:06,379
you want to be here on
this team, on our team,

216
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:07,847
you're gonna have to earn it.

217
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:09,883
Look, I get it.

218
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:11,598
You're big, Sasquatch.

219
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:13,887
But I'm fast.

220
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:16,155
Really fucking fast.

221
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:19,839
Which is why somebody
important thinks I belong here.

222
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:23,230
So when you two figure
out who the fuck I am,

223
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,579
you can find me on the beach.

224
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:27,813
See you.

225
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:31,937
Did that really just happen?

226
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,273
- It did. He slapped me.
- Wow.

227
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,274
Yeah. His hands were
soft and supple though,

228
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:37,443
- like a woman. No offense.
- None taken.

229
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:39,946
You know what, man? I gotta tell you,

230
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:41,413
I'm feeling really good about this year.

231
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:43,148
You know what I'm saying?

232
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:44,618
Good luck out there, man. Good luck.

233
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,485
Thanks.

234
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:47,533
And if you need some extra motivation...

235
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,334
- Looking at it right there.
- Hey...

236
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:53,994
You okay? Help! C.J., help!

237
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:55,928
My friend is choking! Help!

238
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:58,331
No, not C.J. Not C.J. No, no!

239
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:00,111
Are you okay? You're choking.

240
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:14,446
Oh, God.

241
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:15,828
Are you okay?

242
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:17,898
- Ronnie.
- You're gonna be just fine.

243
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:19,298
What?

244
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,437
Ah! Thank you!

245
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:29,709
- Ronnie, are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

246
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:31,965
Are you sure?

247
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,633
Yeah, yeah. No, don't touch, don't touch.

248
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:34,967
Okay.

249
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:38,004
I'm so good. You did good, good, good work.

250
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:40,105
Good job. Thank you, you can go now.

251
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,207
Okay, um, drink some water...

252
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:45,391
- Thank you so much. Okay.
- I guess.

253
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:48,327
- Dave?
- Yeah.

254
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,549
- How does it look?
- How does what look?

255
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,431
Down there.

256
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:58,023
Does not look good at all.

257
00:14:58,103 --> 00:14:59,192
Yeah, what does it look like?

258
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:01,628
Looks like your dick is trapped
between two slats of wood.

259
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,331
Okay, I just... Fuck, I can't reach it.

260
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:06,700
I just need you to get down
there and just pop it out.

261
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,268
No, I can't do that at all.

262
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:10,036
Come on, I just need
you... You grab that dick

263
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:11,370
- and you push it out.
- No, no.

264
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,706
Okay. Hi.

265
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,907
I'm going to help you.

266
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:16,209
We're going to deflate the
situation together. Okay?

267
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,977
- Okay.
- Focus.

268
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:19,512
Think about things that turn you off.

269
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:22,896
Maybe like, um... Like
your grandma's underwear?

270
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,217
- Mmm-mmm. Not working.
- No? Okay, cool.

271
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:27,366
- Maybe, like...
- Ostriches.

272
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:29,389
- Guys, still stuck.
- Mitch, hey, need you.

273
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,124
No, no, not Mitch. Don't bring Mitch over.

274
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:33,625
- Hey.
- Hey, Mitch is here.

275
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,461
Ronnie, you pumped about
the qualifiers, buddy?

276
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,063
You know it, man. I'm
just, um... I'm really...

277
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:40,667
Really excited to quit my
double major in robotics

278
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:43,503
and computer science and really,
really do something with my life.

279
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,038
You don't need to look down there.

280
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:46,139
Do not touch me right now.

281
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:48,054
- Not even touching you.
- Okay.

282
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:50,677
Wow. Okay.

283
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:52,544
Looks like you got your
beef and your biscuits

284
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:54,060
stuck down there.

285
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,448
It's gonna be okay. I've
been through it, too.

286
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:58,250
- Not a big deal.
- Really?

287
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,387
Yeah, absolutely. I was stuck
in a woman for hours once.

288
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,187
Couldn't get out.

289
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,724
- Totally the same, yeah?
- It's the same thing.

290
00:16:04,804 --> 00:16:05,658
Stuck junk is stuck junk.

291
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:09,328
Stuck junk is stuck junk. Okay.

292
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:11,630
All right, buddy, we're gonna have
to, uh, flash-freeze your johnson.

293
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,633
No, no, it's okay, it's okay, I got it.

294
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,235
Look, it's okay.

295
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:16,414
- Oh, my God.
- Nope. Still stuck.

296
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:19,371
I mean, if you think about
it, it's a good thing, right?

297
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:21,420
Congratulations.

298
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:24,177
Hey, uh, how you feeling, sport?

299
00:16:24,257 --> 00:16:25,445
Better, but could we get

300
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,360
some sort of perimeter going for the crowd?

301
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,450
Nah. Nobody's looking. Just us.

302
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,185
God, you're lying. That's a lot of people.

303
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:34,434
Mitch, I can't get the swelling to go down.

304
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:36,489
All right.

305
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:37,791
We're going to have to pull it out.

306
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,058
- Pull it?
- Yeah.

307
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:40,826
- Just like pulling a tooth.
- What?

308
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,361
Don't you touch my dick!

309
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:43,743
I'm okay.

310
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,600
Ronnie, are you okay?

311
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,402
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

312
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:50,769
I'm proud of you, Ronnie.

313
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:53,586
<i>Fuck you, Dave. You're
my worst friend.</i>

314
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:05,485
Captain, uh, I need to
talk to you about this...

315
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,219
Yeah, Mitch. Look, you're just in time.

316
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,754
I want you to watch something.

317
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,503
Check this out.

318

Wow. Right?

340
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:06,545
He's reckless, he's insubordinate. Come on.

341
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,247
Which is why we can afford him.

342
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:09,616
Come on, Mitch.

343
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:12,151
The guy's only here
because he took a plea deal.

344
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:14,154
A plea deal?

345
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:15,836
For what?

346
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,657
The specifics aren't important.

347
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:21,494
What's important is that we
are his community service.

348
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:22,794
Come on. He's a train wreck.

349
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:24,429
With two gold medals.

350
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,299
How many gold medals do you have?

351
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:27,848
Probably zero. Okay?

352
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:32,237
Brody is an American hero with
the face of a Swedish model.

353
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:33,406
You're losing me.

354
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:34,340
He's one of the best
swimmers in the whole world.

355
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,575
There's more to this
job than just swimming.

356
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:39,712
- You know that.
- Yeah, there's also politics.

357
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,348
Now, look, Mitch, let's be honest.

358
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:43,882
We're staring into the abyss here.

359
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:46,718
City council's already
cut our funding again.

360
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:48,854
What the council wants
and what the bay needs

361
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:50,269
are two different things.

362
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:52,225
I found more flakka this morning.

363
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:54,194
Clearly, we have new dealers in the bay.

364
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:57,978
And this shit is like bath salts on meth.

365
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,600
Wow, flakka?

366
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,869
Good work, Mitch.

367
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:04,536
I'll turn this over to the police.

368
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:06,371
Hey, look. This new guy of yours?

369
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:07,940
He's not ready for this kind of trouble.

370
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,210
He doesn't need to be,
and neither do you. Okay?

371
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,378
It's not your job.

372
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,879
It's the busiest time of the year.

373
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:16,730
I need you out there shining for me.

374
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:19,319
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes!

375
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:20,852
But he's got to pass qualifiers first.

376
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:22,621
- You got it.
- Which should be easy

377
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:24,756
considering he's the "best
swimmer in the world."

378
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,272
Right?

379
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:28,761
Good afternoon, Councilman.

380
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:32,144
- Good afternoon.
- So, how is our progress?

381
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:35,334
Most of the council has
signed off on your terms.

382
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:36,369
Good.

383
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:37,637
And the rest are almost there.

384
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:39,304
"Almost"?

385
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:42,242
Ugh. Councilman,

386
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:46,625
you seem like the kind of man who
knows how to seize an opportunity.

387
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,662
Me, too.

388
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:52,651
Back home, my younger brother was
given the family business to run

389
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:55,354
when clearly I had the business gene.

390
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:57,303
Why? Because I'm a woman.

391
00:19:58,036 --> 00:19:59,758
So I came to America,

392
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:04,109
the Land of Opportunity,
because everything is fair here.

393
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:05,965
But who's to say anymore?

394
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:08,714
I have a point to prove, Councilman.

395
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,652
And I'm here to create
an opportunity for you.

396
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,730
I'm sure they'll come around.

397
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:26,298
I'm sure they will, too.

398
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,890
Why does she always look
like she's running in slo-mo?

399
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,606
You see it, too?

400
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,697
She always looks wet. But not too wet.

401
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:40,079
Right.

402
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:43,835
She's the reason I believe in God.

403
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:46,004
Hey, how's your dick?

404
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:47,439
Oh, uh, it's good, you know...

405
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,121
It's better, you know...

406
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:51,577
It's just ready for action.

407
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:52,945
- Okay.
- Okay.

408
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:54,313
Okay.

409
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:56,014
I got my dick stuck in a chair earlier.

410
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:57,449
- What? You did?
- Yeah.

411
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:58,717
You haven't heard about this?

412
00:20:58,797 --> 00:21:00,852
Yeah, I heard. Everybody's heard.

413
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,287
<i>All right. Welcome, everybody.</i>

414
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:06,725
<i>You know, Baywatch proudly accepts
only one new recruit every year.</i>

415
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:08,328
<i>But the good news for you</i>

416
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:10,996
<i>is that this year, we've
got three open spots.</i>

417
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:14,100
<i>Now without further ado, I'd
like to turn it over to the man</i>

418
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,034
<i>who has 500 career saves.</i>

419
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:18,549
<i>Give it up for Lieutenant
Mitch Buchannon.</i>

420
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:24,724
<i>All right, thank you. Thank you.</i>

421
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:27,813
<i>Baywatch is the elite of the elite.</i>

422
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:30,882
<i>Our team's commitment to
protecting the bay at all costs</i>

423
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:32,885
<i>is the reason why the
single mom behind me</i>

424
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:35,521
<i>feels very comfortable
letting her two kids run</i>

425
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:36,833
<i>right into the water unaccompanied.</i>

426
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:41,360
<i>Thanks, Mitch. That's right.</i>

427
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,795
<i>And Baywatch works
because we follow rules.</i>

428
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,933
<i>We follow rules because
if we don't, people die.</i>

429
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:48,001
<i>You work in an office</i>

430
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:51,317
<i>and you doze off at your
desk one day, no big deal.</i>

431
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:54,107
<i>You slack off here...
Say it with me...</i>

432
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,156
People die.

433
00:21:56,622 --> 00:21:58,410
<i>So here's the thing, if
you've come to Baywatch</i>

434
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,113
<i>on your little motorcycle,
thinking you're cool,</i>

435
00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:03,081
<i>trying to work on your killer tan...</i>

436
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:05,450
<i>Well, you need to find
another beach to go to.</i>

437
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,918
<i>But if you've come to sacrifice</i>

438
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:09,121
<i>for something much
bigger than yourself,</i>

439
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:10,903
<i>this is the beach for you.</i>

440
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:15,128
<i>But you're gonna have to get
through this first. C.J.?</i>

441
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,976
Yeah! C.J.!

442
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:19,732
<i>There are tons of qualities
that make a great lifeguard.</i>

443
00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:21,667
<i>Today, we're gonna test all of them</i>

444
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:24,003
<i>in a grueling obstacle
course we like to call.</i>

445
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,785
<i>"The Absentee Father."</i>

446
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:27,939
<i>He's tough. Brutal, even.</i>

447
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,475
<i>His presence in your life is
brief, but it will scar you</i>

448
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:33,678
<i>and instill a toughness in you that
will carry you through birthdays,</i>

449
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:36,681
<i>Christmases and even "Bring
Your Dad To School Day"</i>

450
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:38,450
<i>when your mom has to
put on a fake moustache</i>

451
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,500
<i>just so you can fit in
with the other kids.</i>

452
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,554
<i>All right.</i>

453
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:43,889
<i>Thank you, C.J.</i>

454
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:45,558
<i>Thank you.</i>

455
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:48,160
<i>So get out there, kick
ass and make us proud.</i>

456
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,607
<i>Go, Baywatch.</i>

457
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:03,355
On your mark.

458
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:07,127
Get set!

459
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:25,063
<i>This is Baywatch, people!</i>

460
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:26,498
- <i>Kick those legs!</i>
- Let's go!

461
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:27,633
Come on, let's go!

462
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:28,868
<i>Listen to what she's saying.</i>

463
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:29,968
<i>Keep it going! Keep it going!</i>

464
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,471
<i>You are guppies!</i>

465
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:32,606
<i>One day you will be sharks!</i>

466
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:35,188
<i>Pick it up, folks. Move those legs!</i>

467
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:38,177
<i>Who's your daddy now?</i>

468
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:39,689
<i>Come on, guys!</i>

469
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,219
Come on, guys! Let's go!

470
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:49,468
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

471
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:52,070
Let's go! You got this! Come on!

472
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:54,526
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

473
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:56,040
Up and over!

474
00:23:57,843 --> 00:24:01,181
Let's go, come on! Way to hustle!
Come on, you're almost there!

475
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:04,614
Kid's really got no quit in him.

476
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:08,107
Attaboy, Ronnie! Great job!

477
00:24:08,187 --> 00:24:09,489
Great!

478
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:18,684
Oh, fuck.

479
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:20,018
You know, you wanna be on our team,

480
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:21,754
you're gonna have to pass this course.

481
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,889
- We all do.
- Look. Mitch, right?

482
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:26,306
- Lieutenant to you.
- "Lieutenant"?

483
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:28,907
Like in the army?

484
00:24:29,674 --> 00:24:31,877
Let me save you some time. Okay?

485
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:35,301
You're not gonna be my big brother
here and put me on the right path.

486
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:36,768
It doesn't work like that.

487
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:40,106
I got where I am today
completely by myself.

488
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:41,873
So how about you let me do my job,

489
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:44,075
and I'll tell you where to send my checks?

490
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:48,060
You know, sharks always swim slowly.

491
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:50,815
Until they need to attack.

492
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:51,984
Thank you for that cryptic

493
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:53,718
and totally irrelevant
piece of information.

494
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:55,400
What are you, Aquaman?

495
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:58,991
'Cause I'm really confused with
what we've been talking about.

496
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:00,325
Come on, Gold Medal.

497
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:02,695
You afraid I'm gonna kick
your <i>Little Mermaid</i> ass

498
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:05,478
all over this course in
front of all these people?

499
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:07,132
I mean, now you're gonna have to beat me

500
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:09,246
on the big boy's course, princess.

501
00:25:55,393 --> 00:25:56,616
Whoo!

502
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:58,149
Well, that was cute.

503
00:25:58,229 --> 00:25:59,885
- Probably in record time.
- Yeah?

504
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:01,887
The problem is, that's not the course.

505
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:02,921
That's not the course?

506
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:03,857
So here's what we're gonna do.

507
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,725
We're gonna go over to the real course,

508
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:07,392
and if you beat me over there,

509
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,160
not only are you on the team,

510
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,763
but I won't fuck with you anymore

511
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:11,897
and I'll call you by your real name.

512
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:13,043
Oh, really?

513
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:28,358
Yeah!

514
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:41,327
Refrigerators?

515
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:45,007
98, 99, 100!

516
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:51,718
Ahhh!

517
00:26:54,018 --> 00:26:55,454
Whoo!

518
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:59,591
That was bullshit, Mitch.

519
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:01,179
You know I was already gassed.

520
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,248
Because you were showboating.
You want to be a lifeguard,

521
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:04,730
you gotta learn to conserve your energy.

522
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:06,162
Conserve my energy?

523
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,235
No!

524
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:12,091
Help! My kids!

525
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:14,140
Lifeguard Tower One!

526
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,243
Help!

527
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:55,814
Look out! Look out!

528
00:27:58,116 --> 00:27:59,738
We're on the go!

529
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:00,939
Come on, move!

530
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,174
Yo, move!

531
00:28:02,254 --> 00:28:04,086
Watch it! Move, move, move!

532
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:09,127
Hey, look out!

533
00:28:09,828 --> 00:28:11,530
Lady, get out of the way!

534
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:26,031
- My kids!
- Ma'am, everything's okay.

535
00:28:26,111 --> 00:28:27,910
I'm here to save you.
My name is Matt Brody.

536
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:30,969
- Somebody help!
- Ma'am, stop it!

537
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:33,218
I can't save you if you're being a dick!

538
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:37,109
- Where are the other two?
- "Other two"?

539
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:38,522
Oh, shit.

540
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:50,836
- Here you go. Here you go.
- Okay.

541
00:28:51,336 --> 00:28:52,738
Take him.

542
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:57,576
You're okay.

543
00:28:58,276 --> 00:28:59,430
Come on.

544
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,300
Breathe for me. Come on, big man.

545
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,411
Come on.

546
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:07,106
We'll set you down right here.

547
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:09,386
Good. Let's get you over. Attaboy.

548
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,844
- Brody, stop!
- One, two, three...

549
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:14,479
- Brody, stop!
- What? Why?

550
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,328
Her airway's blocked.

551
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:23,269
- Okay, breathe.
- C.J., she good?

552
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:25,837
- Steph, how is she?
- She's all right.

553
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:27,993
You're gonna be good.

554
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:29,227
Give me some.

555
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:30,742
Let's get you to your mom.

556
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:41,040
All right, guys. Hey, listen up.

557
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,908
We want to thank you for
a great year of qualifiers.

558
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:46,477
For those of you who don't
go on and become trainees,

559
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:49,481
we wanna thank you, we
expect to see you next year.

560
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:52,732
To the trainees who
made it, congratulations.

561
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:58,389
Oh, my God. I made it.

562
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:00,458
I made it! Oh, my God.

563
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:02,527
Thank you so much.

564
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:04,029
You don't ever have to thank me.

565
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,129
You did this one on your own.

566
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:06,645
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

567
00:30:07,345 --> 00:30:09,347
What the fuck? That's my name.

568
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:12,303
That's my name!

569
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:13,639
Holy shit!

570
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,920
I made it onto...

571
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,610
Wait. Do not tell me that I'm the tech guy.

572
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,011
No!

573
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:20,478
No, I chose you because you have heart,

574
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,282
no quit and you leave
it all out on the beach.

575
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:25,765
- Thanks, Mitch.
- Congratulations.

576
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:29,634
Hey, <i>High School Musical.</i>

577
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:31,369
You were reckless out there.

578
00:30:32,136 --> 00:30:34,426
Completely destroyed a
motorcycle, which you stole.

579
00:30:34,506 --> 00:30:35,561
I didn't steal that.

580
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:37,129
I commandeered it, okay?

581
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:39,564
Because it was faster
and clearly had insurance.

582
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:40,600
And by the way,

583
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,168
the lady that I saved,
she didn't seem to mind.

584
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:45,337
Let me tell you something, man,

585
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:46,639
the rescues don't mean a thing

586
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,474
if you put other people in danger. Okay?

587
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:50,609
Now, I get it, you're
fast, you're fearless.

588
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:52,645
And I have to make you
a trainee, butterfly,

589
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,912
but you got a lot to learn.

590
00:30:53,992 --> 00:30:55,359
All right. Thank you, Lieutenant.

591
00:30:59,664 --> 00:31:00,619
All right, listen up!

592
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:02,955
Training begins at 0600.

593
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:05,357
Hot Wheels, I'll see you
back here in the morning.

594
00:31:05,437 --> 00:31:06,806
Sure thing, Lieutenant.

595
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,505
Welcome to Baywatch.

596
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,046
All right.

597
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:16,782
Hey, I'm so glad I caught you all.

598
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:20,205
I don't mean to interrupt,

599
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:22,573
but everyone on the beach
is talking about you guys.

600
00:31:22,653 --> 00:31:23,641
Thank you.

601
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:26,344
Brody, that save sounds incredible.

602
00:31:26,424 --> 00:31:28,213
Impulsive, but incredible.

603
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:29,948
Appreciate it. See that?

604
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:31,950
Ah, we're just doing our jobs.

605
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,252
Oh.

606
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:35,353
Hey, guys, this is Victoria Leeds,

607
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,523
the new owner of the Huntley Club.

608
00:31:37,603 --> 00:31:38,457
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

609
00:31:38,537 --> 00:31:40,492
Well, I just wanted to invite all of you

610
00:31:40,572 --> 00:31:42,393
to the Huntley. We're having an open house.

611
00:31:42,473 --> 00:31:45,397
It's a kind of a "meet
the neighbors" thing.

612
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:47,565
Look, I know that the
club's kind of "fancy"

613
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:50,235
and probably not your scene,

614
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:52,484
but you have a standing invitation.

615
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:55,620
Thank you. We'll keep that in mind.

616
00:31:58,222 --> 00:32:00,379
- I'll see you there?
- See you then.

617
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,824
Let's go, Frankie.

618
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,625
Brody?

619
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:34,612
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

620
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:37,282
Nothing. I was just, uh...

621
00:32:37,362 --> 00:32:38,649
You know, stargazing.

622
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,432
Under a pier?

623
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,420
Yeah. That way.

624
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,822
Look, you're on the team,

625
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:46,691
and, um, I don't want anyone on
the team sleeping outside, so...

626
00:32:46,771 --> 00:32:48,659
Yeah, come on. You're
coming with me. Let's go.

627
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:51,030
Brody, let's go, I don't
want to wait for you. Come on.

628
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,598
Thank you again, so much.

629
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:53,765
Really embarrassed.

630
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:56,068
Yeah, no, it's totally
cool. Don't worry about it.

631
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:57,770
Oh, I forgot something in my car.

632
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,638
Um, just... Just knock.

633
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:01,305
You sure Stephanie won't mind? It's cool?

634
00:33:01,385 --> 00:33:03,308
It's cool. She won't mind at all.

635
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:04,443
Thank you so much.

636
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:06,311
This is really cool of you guys.

637
00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:07,793
Mmm-hmm. No problem.

638
00:33:08,126 --> 00:33:10,096
What the fuck?

639
00:33:13,231 --> 00:33:14,585
- 'Sup.
- Hey.

640
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:15,787
This is your house, isn't it?

641
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:18,256
Yeah, this is, um... It's my house.

642
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,323
Yeah.

643
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:21,060
I assume you need a place to crash.

644
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,109
- Yeah.
- Come on in.

645
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:26,208
Just like C.J., always picking up strays.

646
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:38,590
Quit looking at Little Mitch! It's creepy.

647
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,459
Come and see where you're gonna crash.

648
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,861
There's your cot.

649
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:46,485
Don't jack off on my sheets.

650
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:47,866
Don't.

651
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:51,489
<i>I can't find my hermit crab.</i>

652
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:53,625
<i>I think he ran out earlier today.</i>

653
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:56,675
<i>He's got short legs, but
he's got a fast walk, so,</i>

654
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:59,711
<i>if you'd keep eyes open,
I'd appreciate that.</i>

655
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:04,115
<i>I will start combing the
beach first thing at sunup.</i>

656
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,438
<i>This is Echo Bravo 153. Go ahead.</i>

657
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:11,143
Fuck it. Mitch, can I please
turn the C.B. off in my room?

658
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:12,543
<i>Jonas Brother, listen to me.</i>

659
00:34:12,623 --> 00:34:13,679
<i>Get your beauty rest.</i>

660
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,926
<i>We're starting bright
and early tomorrow.</i>

661
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:26,203
How was your first riptide?

662
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:29,393
It stings!

663
00:34:29,473 --> 00:34:31,295
That's just the lactic acid.

664
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,645
Actually, it's the jellyfish stuck to you.

665
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:36,745
What the fuck?

666
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,837
Oh, my God!

667
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:41,306
One, two, three. Cross.

668
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:42,473
One, two, three.

669
00:34:42,553 --> 00:34:44,743
Keep your hands up. One, two, duck! Again.

670
00:34:44,823 --> 00:34:46,277
One, two, duck!

671
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:47,793
Nice!

672
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:55,621
What you, uh... What
you doing there, killer?

673
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,466
Um, I don't know.

674
00:34:58,502 --> 00:35:00,726
- I don't know.
- Okay.

675
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:03,661
Honestly, I don't even
know what I'm doing here.

676
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:05,931
Mitch sees something in you.

677
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:08,433
And I see it, too. I do.

678
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:10,081
I really do.

679
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:11,837
What?

680
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:13,652
What?

681
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:15,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

682
00:35:16,654 --> 00:35:19,057
Very important lesson.

683
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,746
That is the Devil's Urchin.

684
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:21,846
One prick out of that thing

685
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:23,382
will give you enough adrenaline

686
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:24,850
to choke out a pissed-off bull.

687
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,685
The only problem is, after that,

688
00:35:26,765 --> 00:35:29,101
you say some crazy-ass shit,
and then you fucking die.

689
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:31,757
Now pick that up and take it to Tower One.

690
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:34,759
So these are just like
laying around everywhere?

691
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:35,728
Do you want me to help you?

692
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,644
Okay, look, let's just
be honest, all right?

693
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:40,846
I mean, we've lost him.

694
00:35:41,346 --> 00:35:42,768
- No, it's not your fault.
- No, Ted.

695
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,268
Not my boy Ted.

696
00:35:44,348 --> 00:35:46,237
- Why, why, Ted?
- Why you, Ted?

697
00:35:46,317 --> 00:35:47,572
Why?

698
00:35:47,652 --> 00:35:50,620
Don't you do this to me,
Ted! Don't you do this!

699
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,446
Okay, no. But, seriously, I got to help you

700
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,614
because you are gonna kill
someone with that technique.

701
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:57,482
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right. Okay. Ready?

702
00:35:57,562 --> 00:35:59,685
Wait, Summer, do you
have time to study later?

703
00:35:59,765 --> 00:36:01,267
Yeah. Um...

704
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,956
Did you just, uh, look at my boobs?

705
00:36:05,036 --> 00:36:06,692
I... Was not my intention.

706
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:09,661
I didn't, uh, stare directly at them.

707
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:10,895
You're looking at them right now.

708
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:12,531
Now I did.

709
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:14,146
'Cause you're talking about them.

710
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:16,000
Testing. Failed.

711
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,502
Oh, my God. Well, we're gonna be

712
00:36:17,582 --> 00:36:19,284
- in swimsuits a lot, so...
- Yeah.

713
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,572
If it's gonna be a problem for you...

714
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:22,373
There's not a problem for me.

715
00:36:22,453 --> 00:36:23,775
- At all. Cool.
- Yeah.

716
00:36:23,855 --> 00:36:25,643
All right. You just looked at them again.

717
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:27,846
- No, I didn't. I was... I didn't...
- Yeah, you did.

718
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:29,781
Well, when you point them out like that...

719
00:36:29,861 --> 00:36:32,264
It's a compliment if you
think about it, sort of.

720
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:38,889
Victoria.

721
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:40,058
I'm gonna need more time.

722
00:36:40,138 --> 00:36:43,694
Do I strike you as a
patient woman, Councilman?

723
00:36:43,774 --> 00:36:47,933
No, no, I got the council to sign
off on your real estate proposal.

724
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:49,801
Just some property owners
won't give approval.

725
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:51,182
But I'm working on it.

726
00:36:51,783 --> 00:36:53,751
Yeah, well, you just ran out of time.

727
00:36:53,884 --> 00:36:56,275
Leon, would you show Mr. Rodriguez

728
00:36:56,355 --> 00:36:58,757
what we do to people who don't deliver?

729
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:03,815
I know you're dealing flakka,

730
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:06,618
which is gonna drive down
real estate prices in the bay,

731
00:37:06,698 --> 00:37:07,953
right? Right?

732
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:11,836
So if anything happens
to me, I will expose you.

733
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,292
And then you'll never get your approvals.

734
00:37:14,372 --> 00:37:16,295
Such accusations.

735
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,297
I'm not a Bond villain.

736
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:19,778
Well, yet.

737
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:21,313
You're in politics.

738
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,268
You know that no one can
claw their way to the top

739
00:37:23,348 --> 00:37:26,352
without getting a little
dirt under their fingernails.

740
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:29,641
Clearly, I overestimated you.

741
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:31,789
But calling me a drug dealer...

742
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,714
It's so much bigger than that, you know?

743
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:37,683
- I...
- Leon...

744
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:39,164
Teach him some manners.

745
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:41,733
Have fun, boys.

746
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,455
I agree with...

747
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:44,589
I overstepped.

748
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:46,838
I overstepped, Victoria.

749
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:48,973
Guys, we can talk about this.

750
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:52,663
Leon doesn't talk. He's a man of action.

751
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:55,114
- There's a purity to that.
- I'm going to kill you.

752
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,735
Damn it. You do that every time.

753
00:37:57,815 --> 00:38:00,385
I build you up, and then
you ruin the mystique.

754
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:20,359
- See something you like?
- Jesus Christ.

755
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:23,409
You, uh... You got me.

756
00:38:23,774 --> 00:38:26,031
You're gonna be cool and go
talk to her like a real man,

757
00:38:26,111 --> 00:38:28,132
or you gonna stand up here
and be Creepy Creeperton

758
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:29,067
through the binoculars?

759
00:38:29,147 --> 00:38:30,935
Look, man, I'm fine in that department,

760
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:33,371
- so don't worry about me.
- Yeah.

761
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:35,906
I'm sure your approach to women
is Snapchatting a dick pic or two.

762
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:37,822
Don't ever do that.

763
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:41,078
A lot of people screenshot them nowadays.

764
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,915
Yeah. If it leaks on the
Internet, it's terrible.

765
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:44,982
Hola? <i>Is anyone there?</i>

766
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:46,596
This is Baywatch. What
is your emergency? Over.

767
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,326
What is your position? Over.

768
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:57,473
Gringa, <i>my position is the ocean.</i>

769
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:01,967
Okay, call Coast Guard. We got a 10-73.

770
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:03,467
- I'm gonna take the WaveRunner.
- "10-73"?

771
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:04,770
You and C.J. take Rescue One.

772
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,438
- Go, go, go!
- Rescue One, ASAP.

773
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:08,072
Hold up! Wait, what,
what? What are we doing?

774
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:09,721
Shit.

775
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:12,877
- Summer? What's a 10-73?
- Fire!

776
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:14,513
"Fire"? What does that mean? In the ocean?

777
00:39:14,593 --> 00:39:15,746
You need to start studying!

778
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:17,716
Yeah, I know. Got it. I'm there.

779
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:19,298
See you out there.

780
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:24,455
- Come on. Let's go.
- I'm coming!

781
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:25,956
- If you're comin', hurry up.
- Where's mine?

782
00:39:26,036 --> 00:39:27,338
You don't get one.

783
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:30,929
Whoa!

784
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:32,431
Come on. Quit screwing around!

785
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:33,697
- Could you wait for me?
- Come on.

786
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:35,167
God damn it, let's go.

787
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,949
Go, go, go!

788
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:44,523
Lock your arms around my waist or
you're gonna fucking fall off again!

789
00:39:45,022 --> 00:39:46,710
- This is so awkward, dude.
- Hold on. Hold on.

790
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,947
How many buckets of
lotion do you wear a day?

791
00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:51,363
You're like a greasy, hairless gorilla.

792
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:57,121
Don't worry, guys! I got it.

793
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:59,871
I'll take care of... If the fire spreads...

794
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:06,598
All right, I need you to take the throttle.

795
00:40:06,678 --> 00:40:07,632
That's impossible.

796
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:10,982
Go between my arms and
take the fucking throttle!

797
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:17,990
Holy shit.

798
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:33,539
When I say so, hard right turn.

799
00:40:33,837 --> 00:40:35,540
- What?
- Three.

800
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:38,476
- Two. One. Go!
- Oh, shit, man. I don't know.

801
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:10,562
Oh, thank God.

802
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:11,929
Are you the fire water man?

803
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:12,864
Tell me, where are your friends?

804
00:41:12,944 --> 00:41:14,266
- I don't know.
- Okay. You stay right here.

805
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,948
- Don't move. Okay?
- Okay.

806
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:23,554
Help!

807
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:25,590
Down here!

808
00:41:27,993 --> 00:41:30,061
Is anyone there?

809
00:41:30,395 --> 00:41:31,683
I hear you!

810
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:33,918
Get to the front of the boat! We're coming!

811
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:35,297
Help!

812
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:38,369
Help me!

813
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:42,373
Mitch!

814
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:50,615
Portside.

815
00:41:56,187 --> 00:41:57,208
Over here!

816
00:41:57,288 --> 00:41:58,877
- In the front!
- Fuck.

817
00:41:58,957 --> 00:42:00,812
There's a girl trapped
in the front of the boat!

818
00:42:00,892 --> 00:42:02,494
There's too much fire!

819
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:05,795
No way.

820
00:42:07,031 --> 00:42:08,333
C.J.!

821
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,723
Okay, <i>guapo.</i>

822
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:14,826
If you want me, you can have me.

823
00:42:14,906 --> 00:42:17,541
But <i>rapido</i> because
the boat is on fire.

824
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:19,074
- Some other time.
- No...

825
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:25,670
Are you all right? Can you hear me?

826
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,083
No, I'm not okay!

827
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:31,256
Help! Please!

828
00:42:33,223 --> 00:42:35,393
Help! In here!

829
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,918
Do not go under that fire, Brody!

830
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:42,434
Wait!

831
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:45,022
In here!

832
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:47,192
Please! Help!

833
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:48,759
- Oh, my God!
- Take my hand.

834
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:50,275
Trust me.

835
00:42:52,843 --> 00:42:54,398
- Are you hurt?
- No. I'm okay.

836
00:42:54,478 --> 00:42:55,933
- Good. Hang on.
- What?

837
00:42:56,013 --> 00:42:57,682
C.J.!

838
00:42:58,082 --> 00:42:59,417
Portside!

839
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:05,909
Miss, are you okay?

840
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,045
Can you help me?

841
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,260
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

842
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:29,481
Brody!

843
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:38,976
Oh.

844
00:43:39,056 --> 00:43:40,110
Are you okay?

845
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,080
That was such a great plan,

846
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,362
just to see fire and
just swim right into it.

847
00:43:45,529 --> 00:43:46,984
You care about me.

848
00:43:47,064 --> 00:43:49,187
- I care about you.
- Ugh.

849
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:51,036
Get off that boat, Mitch.

850
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:20,097
eight, nine, ten.

851
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:26,891
Come on.

852
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:29,259
Hey, other than him, we did good, right?

853
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:30,395
Like, we saved everyone.

854
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:31,862
Yes, including you.

855
00:44:31,942 --> 00:44:33,031
I know that.

856
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:35,299
I'm just saying, all things considered,

857
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:37,648
things could've gone a lot worse.

858
00:44:37,948 --> 00:44:39,237
Come on!

859
00:44:39,317 --> 00:44:41,005
Is he going to be okay?

860
00:44:41,085 --> 00:44:42,406
Do you know what happened
to the Councilman?

861
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:43,908
No, I don't know.

862
00:44:43,988 --> 00:44:45,375
We were partying,

863
00:44:45,455 --> 00:44:48,592
and then when we came upstairs,
the boat was already on fire.

864
00:44:57,402 --> 00:45:00,525
You disobeyed an order out
there, put yourself in danger.

865
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:02,127
You can't save anyone if you die.

866
00:45:02,207 --> 00:45:04,709
Yeah, I know. I messed up. Okay?

867
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:06,330
I'm just... What are we still doing here?

868
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,898
- Just write this down.
- Can we just go?

869
00:45:07,978 --> 00:45:10,134
Victim is male, five foot nine...

870
00:45:10,214 --> 00:45:12,871
Hey, hey, hey. Get back
right now. Do not contaminate

871
00:45:12,951 --> 00:45:14,352
my crime scene.

872
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:16,174
Come on, Ellerbee.

873
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:17,976
Don't give me any of
that jurisdiction shit.

874
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:20,177
Uh, no, I won't, because technically,

875
00:45:20,257 --> 00:45:22,346
you don't have a jurisdiction, lifeguard.

876
00:45:22,426 --> 00:45:26,317
You got one job, make sure
swim-happy white people don't drown.

877
00:45:26,397 --> 00:45:30,221
Technically, that boat out there is
the Coast Guard's jurisdiction. Okay?

878
00:45:30,301 --> 00:45:32,790
And if I would've waited for them,
all these girls would be dead.

879
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:33,891
- What?
- We would have died?

880
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:36,194
- Burned to a crisp.
- I'm not ready to die!

881
00:45:36,274 --> 00:45:38,610
I know. It's okay, you're not.

882
00:45:39,143 --> 00:45:40,931
So technically, we saved lives.

883
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:42,900
Technically, I see a dead body,

884
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,804
which technically makes this a crime scene.

885
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:48,906
Hey, technically, these "technically's"
are wasting a lot of time, technically.

886
00:45:48,986 --> 00:45:50,219
Thank you, blue-eyed demon.

887
00:45:51,922 --> 00:45:54,212
And as far as this dead body goes, look.

888
00:45:54,292 --> 00:45:56,480
Badge on a uniform.

889
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,583
Patch on a swimsuit.

890
00:45:58,663 --> 00:46:00,499
Lieutenant. Beat cop.

891
00:46:01,031 --> 00:46:02,219
So keep us informed

892
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:03,822
of the investigation and
we're gonna do the same.

893
00:46:03,902 --> 00:46:06,089
All right. Hey, how do I keep in touch?

894
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:07,225
Seashell phone,

895
00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:10,862
or do I just blow into
the conch and you appear?

896
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:12,029
That's the spirit, Ellerbee.

897
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:14,364
Just call me on the shell
phone. That's all you gotta do.

898
00:46:14,444 --> 00:46:15,967
I'll tell you this, if you crack this case,

899
00:46:16,047 --> 00:46:17,234
they're gonna upgrade you to a Segway

900
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:18,969
and they're gonna give
you big-boy pants to wear,

901
00:46:19,049 --> 00:46:20,518
cover up those chicken legs.

902
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:24,322
- Oh, Christ, that's...
- Councilman Rodriguez.

903
00:46:24,455 --> 00:46:26,258
Good luck, Officer.

904
00:46:26,457 --> 00:46:29,013
<i>♪ I got the eye of the tiger</i>

905
00:46:29,093 --> 00:46:30,380
<i>♪ A fighter</i>

906
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,382

910
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:44,161
- Damn, Ronnie.
- C.J.!

911
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:45,529
Please!

912
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:47,264
Oh, shit.

913
00:46:47,344 --> 00:46:49,000
I never really heard a guy sing that song,

914
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,782
but you're really good.

915
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:52,650
Thank you.

916
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:56,354
Uh, C.J., what are you doing here?

917
00:46:56,587 --> 00:46:59,143
Here? Oh, um, it's a coed shower.

918
00:46:59,223 --> 00:47:00,959
Coed, cool.

919
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,181
Cool, cool, cool.

920
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:07,932
Yeah, coed is cool with me,
'cause I'm cool with the coeds.

921
00:47:08,198 --> 00:47:10,232
I'm taking lunch orders.
Do you want anything?

922
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:15,259
I would like a salad.

923
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:16,127
You sure?

924
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:18,328
This place has really good cheesesteaks,

925
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:21,498
meatball subs, foot-longs.

926
00:47:21,578 --> 00:47:25,203
- They really hit the spot.
- No, I'll have a salad.

927
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:28,973
I'm just a straight-up
leafy green type of guy.

928
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:30,341
That's my type of jam.

929
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:33,310
Just hook me up with a salad.

930
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:34,946
Okay. Salad.

931
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:36,580
- Cool. All right.
- Great.

932
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:42,453
By the way, uh, when we shower in
here, we, uh, keep our suits on.

933
00:47:42,533 --> 00:47:45,455
Right, Phil, Sarah?

934
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:47,592
But your, uh, clean nips
are looking really good.

935
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:49,341
Ah!

936
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,677
- Thanks.
- Bye.

937
00:47:58,281 --> 00:47:59,850
Oh, God.

938
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:02,554
Why me?

939
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,826
How was your day today?

940
00:48:08,393 --> 00:48:10,181
Uh, I don't know. A guy died.

941
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:12,650
Maybe this is why we keep losing recruits.

942
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,052
- They can't handle it.
- Yeah.

943
00:48:15,132 --> 00:48:16,288
I mean, now that you know our job

944
00:48:16,368 --> 00:48:18,489
is much more than you expected,
right, the stakes are higher.

945
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:21,606
What happened today, while very
tragic, unfortunately, it does happen.

946
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:23,728
So if you want to quit,
hey, we totally get it.

947
00:48:23,808 --> 00:48:25,263
But if you don't and you choose to stay,

948
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,197
just know that Baywatch is more than a job.

949
00:48:27,277 --> 00:48:28,366
It's a way of life.

950
00:48:28,446 --> 00:48:29,745
"A way of life."

951
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:32,751
You and I both know I'm sticking around.

952
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:35,320
Am I the only one that got a salad?

953
00:48:35,652 --> 00:48:38,375
Look, this is what I
don't understand, okay?

954
00:48:38,455 --> 00:48:40,712
A guy dies. That's tragic.

955
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,513
But that doesn't mean that
there's anything sinister going on.

956
00:48:43,593 --> 00:48:45,148
Okay? And even if there was,

957
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:47,384
that's not our job. That's not what we do.

958
00:48:47,464 --> 00:48:50,455
We're lifeguards. So, this,
technically, has nothing to do with us.

959
00:48:50,535 --> 00:48:52,757
You just heard that cop.
He just told us that.

960
00:48:52,837 --> 00:48:54,993
I just thought you had to be
on a really restrictive diet

961
00:48:55,073 --> 00:48:56,574
to look like you guys.

962
00:48:56,741 --> 00:48:59,496
Brody, what is it that you
think we do here at Baywatch?

963
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:00,732
I thought we were lifeguards.

964
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,134
I thought that we prevent
people from getting sunburned

965
00:49:03,214 --> 00:49:05,168
and, yeah, occasionally
stop them from drowning.

966
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:06,670
And that's all you think that this is?

967
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,005
It's exactly what I thought it was.

968
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:09,540
C.J., how about you throw a few

969
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,275
of last month's cases at Olympiad
here and see what he'd do.

970
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:14,277
- "Cases"?
- Okay, um...

971
00:49:14,357 --> 00:49:16,214
School of manta ray in the cove?

972
00:49:16,294 --> 00:49:17,647
You call Animal Control?

973
00:49:17,727 --> 00:49:19,317
Before Animal Control shows up,

974
00:49:19,397 --> 00:49:21,551
the school of manta ray
fly up out of the water,

975
00:49:21,631 --> 00:49:23,420
sting someone in the chest and they die.

976
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,788
Steve Irwin, R.I.P.

977
00:49:24,868 --> 00:49:28,058
How about, uh, sand grifters
running a con on the beach, right?

978
00:49:28,138 --> 00:49:31,261
Well, I'm not exactly sure what
a sand grifter is, Stephanie.

979
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:32,397
But I would probably call the cops.

980
00:49:32,477 --> 00:49:35,045
Sand grifters are, uh, beach thieves.

981
00:49:35,145 --> 00:49:37,201
Okay, so while you're working on your tan,

982
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:39,404
they're stealing things
from families on the beach.

983
00:49:39,484 --> 00:49:40,772
I'll give you one better.

984
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,373
How about diamond smugglers who
are putting the rocks in surfboards

985
00:49:43,453 --> 00:49:44,342
and bringing them ashore?

986
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:45,777
Everything that you guys are talking about

987
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:50,681
sounds like a really, like,
entertaining, but far-fetched TV show.

988
00:49:50,761 --> 00:49:53,551
But if that was the case, I
would definitely call the cops.

989
00:49:53,631 --> 00:49:56,054
We could call the cops,
and then do nothing,

990
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:57,755
like most people would. But that's not us,

991
00:49:57,835 --> 00:49:59,190
it's not how we operate.

992
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,690
We watch when other
people don't want to watch.

993
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,326
We protect when other
people don't want to protect.

994
00:50:03,406 --> 00:50:06,478
If we do the bare minimum,
sometimes people die.

995
00:50:07,678 --> 00:50:10,201
Guys, we have flakka
that just washed ashore.

996
00:50:10,281 --> 00:50:13,170
That shit is hardcore and
it fucking kills people.

997
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,772
And now we got a dead body in our bay.

998
00:50:14,852 --> 00:50:17,475
And the girls on that boat
had the same drugs on them

999
00:50:17,555 --> 00:50:20,444
that I found in front of Leeds's club.

1000
00:50:20,524 --> 00:50:24,128
So my gut says that it's all connected.

1001
00:50:24,861 --> 00:50:27,351
Wait, Leeds did say there'd be
an open house tonight, right?

1002
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:29,134
Yes, she did.

1003
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:31,469
And we're all going.

1004
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:50,540
What'd you find on Chen?

1005
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,509
No criminal record. No fetishes.

1006
00:50:52,589 --> 00:50:54,411
No weird photos. He's clean.

1007
00:50:54,491 --> 00:50:57,027
Makes me feel weird about the
stuff I have going on in my life.

1008
00:50:58,328 --> 00:50:59,516
What about his bank accounts?

1009
00:50:59,596 --> 00:51:00,551
Account.

1010
00:51:00,631 --> 00:51:01,886
This dude is not rich at all.

1011
00:51:01,966 --> 00:51:04,688
All his money is tied up
in real estate in the bay.

1012
00:51:04,768 --> 00:51:06,623
Well, I guess you'll have
to help me persuade him

1013
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:08,125
some other way.

1014
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:09,706
Every man has a price.

1015
00:51:09,873 --> 00:51:11,261
Speaking of which,

1016
00:51:11,341 --> 00:51:14,132
I know you've been using
my special set of skills

1017
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:15,732
for your own nefarious purposes,

1018
00:51:15,812 --> 00:51:17,534
but additional compensation

1019
00:51:17,614 --> 00:51:21,650
would go a long way in motivating
me to keep my mouth shut.

1020
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:26,543
You're blackmailing me.

1021
00:51:26,623 --> 00:51:29,547
- Huh? Well, I wouldn't...
- Dave...

1022
00:51:29,627 --> 00:51:33,284
I really admire a man who knows
how to seize an opportunity.

1023
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:34,932
I'm very impressed.

1024
00:51:35,899 --> 00:51:38,535
- Keep up the good work.
- Thanks.

1025
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:41,605
Do we have a deal, or...

1026
00:51:41,772 --> 00:51:43,541
I need some closure.

1027
00:51:45,509 --> 00:51:47,165
- Hey.
- Hi.

1028
00:51:47,245 --> 00:51:48,199
Wow, you look really nice.

1029
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:50,167
Hey, you look really nice, too, Baby Gap.

1030
00:51:50,247 --> 00:51:51,735
That shirt come in big-boy size?

1031
00:51:51,815 --> 00:51:53,170
Well, at least I'm undercover.

1032
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,818
Look at you. You didn't even try.

1033
00:51:55,785 --> 00:51:57,775
All right, guys, we got a very
big night, with one goal in mind.

1034
00:51:57,855 --> 00:51:59,676
It's our only shot to prove
that they're dealing here,

1035
00:51:59,756 --> 00:52:01,058
so we gotta make it right.

1036
00:52:01,759 --> 00:52:03,813
So, C.J. and Ronnie,
find out who's selling.

1037
00:52:03,893 --> 00:52:06,350
Summer, keep an eye on Leeds and her thugs.

1038
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,920
Then Mitch and I will search the
place for where she hides the product.

1039
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,254
- Brody?
- What?

1040
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:11,688
- You're our lookout.
- Lookout?

1041
00:52:11,768 --> 00:52:14,225
Guys, if you want to find drugs at a party,

1042
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:15,859
I can walk in there and find drugs.

1043
00:52:15,939 --> 00:52:17,274
It'd take me, like, five minutes.

1044
00:52:17,408 --> 00:52:18,862
Not 'cause I do it all the time.

1045
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:20,598
I'm just saying it's not rocket science.

1046
00:52:20,678 --> 00:52:22,732
Okay, troubled youth. Thank you for that.

1047
00:52:22,812 --> 00:52:24,701
The only way this whole
thing is gonna work out

1048
00:52:24,781 --> 00:52:26,750
is if everyone, everyone, does their job.

1049
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:29,554
- Can you handle that, Malibu Ken?
- Yeah.

1050
00:52:31,455 --> 00:52:32,476
What?

1051
00:52:32,556 --> 00:52:34,011
Why is everyone looking at me? Summer.

1052
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:37,614
Hey, am I the only one that thinks
this is clearly a job for the police?

1053
00:52:37,694 --> 00:52:39,029
- Yes.
- Yes.

1054
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:40,731
Fuck it.

1055
00:52:55,546 --> 00:52:58,735
Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.

1056
00:52:58,815 --> 00:53:01,404
I wanted to meet the new neighbor
everyone is talking about.

1057
00:53:01,484 --> 00:53:04,007
So I presume you know
why I had to invite you.

1058
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:07,377
I am not interested in
selling my properties.

1059
00:53:07,457 --> 00:53:09,547
Why don't you think about it, okay?

1060
00:53:09,627 --> 00:53:14,164
I of all people know how
hard it is to run a business.

1061
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:17,168
You never know when a dry spell could come.

1062
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:19,523
What are you thinking?

1063
00:53:19,603 --> 00:53:21,659
I think we case it and I'll
meet you back here in five.

1064
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:23,560
- All right. Sounds good.
- All right, Steph.

1065
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,663
So where should I, like, look out from?

1066
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:28,313
Hey. How are you?

1067
00:53:41,591 --> 00:53:43,193
Victoria.

1068
00:53:47,364 --> 00:53:50,054
You killed Rodriguez in front of witnesses.

1069
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:51,589
What the fuck were you thinking?

1070
00:53:51,669 --> 00:53:53,623
They were high. They didn't see anything.

1071
00:53:53,703 --> 00:53:54,924
They better not have.

1072
00:53:55,004 --> 00:53:56,960
Because now Dave knows too much.

1073
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,596
And this better not come back to me.

1074
00:53:58,676 --> 00:53:59,964
I can't have this unraveling.

1075
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:01,299
Got it?

1076
00:54:01,379 --> 00:54:03,247
Now go clean up your mess.

1077
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:07,971
- Brody.
- Mmm.

1078
00:54:08,051 --> 00:54:09,572
I'm so glad you came.

1079
00:54:09,652 --> 00:54:10,975
Oh, gosh.

1080
00:54:11,055 --> 00:54:14,224
Let's get you a real
drink. Greg, the good stuff.

1081
00:54:14,658 --> 00:54:16,880
- Scotch is your drink, right?
- Yeah.

1082
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,616
This is a really nice place you have here.

1083
00:54:18,696 --> 00:54:20,365
You have great taste.

1084
00:54:20,497 --> 00:54:21,985
I really respect that.

1085
00:54:22,065 --> 00:54:26,670
It's nice to have somebody
who respects you, you know?

1086
00:54:28,939 --> 00:54:30,527
Oh...

1087
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:32,643
I sense trouble.

1088
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:37,280
I think I'm just, uh,

1089
00:54:37,814 --> 00:54:39,103
not used to having a boss.

1090
00:54:39,183 --> 00:54:41,005
Mitch is threatened.

1091
00:54:41,085 --> 00:54:43,040
He should be thrilled to have you.

1092
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,641
Yeah, you'd think.

1093
00:54:44,721 --> 00:54:46,391
Oh, my God.

1094
00:54:46,689 --> 00:54:48,978
"Lieutenant Matt Brody."

1095
00:54:49,058 --> 00:54:52,730
That has such an amazing
ring to it. Don't you think?

1096
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,132
Yeah.

1097
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:58,556
Here. Keep the whole bottle.

1098
00:54:58,636 --> 00:55:00,491
I think you need it.

1099
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:02,740
- This'll be fun.
- Thank you.

1100
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:06,496
Hey.

1101
00:55:06,576 --> 00:55:07,998
Did you get any intel on Leeds?

1102
00:55:08,078 --> 00:55:09,933
- Yeah, I got intel.
- That's awesome.

1103
00:55:10,013 --> 00:55:13,036
Single malt
35-year-old intel.

1104
00:55:13,116 --> 00:55:15,018
And it's fucking delicious.

1105
00:55:15,652 --> 00:55:17,074
All right, I think I got something.

1106
00:55:17,154 --> 00:55:18,641
Found our access point.

1107
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:20,578
Where is Brody? Have you seen him?

1108
00:55:20,658 --> 00:55:21,679
No. No time.

1109
00:55:21,759 --> 00:55:23,047
We gotta move without him.

1110
00:55:23,127 --> 00:55:24,514
Yeah, but we need our lookout.

1111
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:26,049
What's your deal? You like torturing guys?

1112
00:55:26,129 --> 00:55:27,951
- No.
- Yeah, you do.

1113
00:55:28,031 --> 00:55:31,788
Well, I mean, I have three brothers,
so I've had a lot of practice.

1114
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:32,857
Mmm.

1115
00:55:32,937 --> 00:55:34,391
I take it you're an only child.

1116
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:35,458
I don't know, honestly.

1117
00:55:35,538 --> 00:55:36,326
You don't know?

1118
00:55:36,406 --> 00:55:39,096
- I grew up in a foster home.
- Oh, shit.

1119
00:55:39,176 --> 00:55:41,931
- Three of them, actually.
- I'm sorry.

1120
00:55:42,011 --> 00:55:42,866
Mmm. Don't be.

1121
00:55:42,946 --> 00:55:44,502
It was pretty cool. One of them had a pool.

1122
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:45,735
If it wasn't for that pool,

1123
00:55:45,815 --> 00:55:47,438
I probably wouldn't have
gone to the Olympics.

1124
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:48,873
Yeah. I mean, that's amazing.

1125
00:55:48,953 --> 00:55:51,574
Go from foster home to
winning a gold medal.

1126
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:53,810
- Two.
- Two gold medals.

1127
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:57,013
And I fucking busted my
ass for those gold medals,

1128
00:55:57,093 --> 00:55:59,162
so you can't blame me for celebrating.

1129
00:55:59,263 --> 00:56:00,932
Yeah. Huh.

1130
00:56:01,765 --> 00:56:03,433
I mean, I've always wondered
what happened that night.

1131
00:56:04,335 --> 00:56:07,123
I knew the relay was the
next day, but those guys...

1132
00:56:07,203 --> 00:56:09,659
They didn't care about me.
They just needed me to win.

1133
00:56:09,739 --> 00:56:12,509
Well, you certainly made
sure they did not win.

1134
00:56:12,643 --> 00:56:15,433
I lost way more than they did.

1135
00:56:15,513 --> 00:56:17,435
Okay? I lost all my sponsors.

1136
00:56:17,515 --> 00:56:20,150
I'm an Olympic champion
and I'm fucking broke.

1137
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:23,540
- Ronnie, hey.
- What?

1138
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,909
Okay, listen. I need you to
create a distraction for Leeds.

1139
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:26,777
What? How?

1140
00:56:26,857 --> 00:56:28,492
Remember the first time I met you?

1141
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:29,813
The night at Chen's?

1142
00:56:29,893 --> 00:56:31,228
Oh, yeah.

1143
00:56:31,661 --> 00:56:32,683
What? No.

1144
00:56:32,763 --> 00:56:33,851
- Yes.
- No!

1145
00:56:33,931 --> 00:56:34,884
- Yes!
- Mitch, no!

1146
00:56:34,964 --> 00:56:35,985
- Yes. Yes!
- No!

1147
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:37,188
- No!
- God damn it, Ronnie.

1148
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,388
You listen to me, and you listen good.

1149
00:56:38,468 --> 00:56:42,792
Every team has a ringer, and
you and only you are my ringer.

1150
00:56:42,872 --> 00:56:44,661
Well, then I guess I'm your ringer.

1151
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:46,978
You are my goddamn ringer.

1152
00:56:48,678 --> 00:56:50,847
- Ring, ring?
- Ring, ring.

1153
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:54,951
Yeah. Oh, God.

1154
00:56:56,553 --> 00:56:58,121
Oh, could I...

1155
00:57:00,558 --> 00:57:01,612
Will you just have one drink with me?

1156
00:57:01,692 --> 00:57:03,179
You should probably actually stop drinking

1157
00:57:03,259 --> 00:57:05,362
because you're supposed to
be the lookout for Mitch.

1158
00:57:05,629 --> 00:57:07,331
I am looking out for Mitch.

1159
00:57:08,933 --> 00:57:11,169
Leeds is right there.
I'm gonna go check it out.

1160
00:57:12,736 --> 00:57:13,723
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1161
00:57:13,803 --> 00:57:17,272
<i>A warm welcome to our
host, Victoria Leeds!</i>

1162
00:57:18,975 --> 00:57:20,598
Thank you. Thank you.

1163
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:21,842
<i>So many people.</i>

1164
00:57:23,113 --> 00:57:26,818
<i>So as a welcome to the bay, I, uh...</i>

1165
00:57:27,116 --> 00:57:29,554
<i>Oh, God. Mitch, this is for you.</i>

1166
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:31,174
<i>Oh, wait. Uh, no, Victoria.</i>

1167
00:57:31,254 --> 00:57:34,944
<i>I have something very special
planned for you, for everyone.</i>

1168
00:57:35,024 --> 00:57:37,027
<i>So God help us.</i>

1169
00:57:37,127 --> 00:57:38,114
Aw.

1170
00:57:38,194 --> 00:57:40,597
I'll just put that down. Okay.

1171
00:57:41,864 --> 00:57:42,897
Hit it.

1172
00:58:22,306 --> 00:58:23,793
That's weird.

1173
00:58:23,873 --> 00:58:25,228
Who's Angelo's Fish Company?

1174
00:58:25,308 --> 00:58:27,263
Doesn't the Huntley get
their fish from Flynn's?

1175
00:58:27,343 --> 00:58:29,112
Let's check it out.

1176
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:32,949
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1177
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:40,944
Mitch.

1178
00:58:41,024 --> 00:58:43,190
I just got a little hunch, okay?

1179
00:58:45,328 --> 00:58:46,963
Shit.

1180
00:58:47,797 --> 00:58:50,254
You two, what are you doing back here?

1181
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:51,621
Hey.

1182
00:58:51,701 --> 00:58:54,069
First date. You can't blame me, right?

1183
00:59:06,216 --> 00:59:08,005
So juvenile.

1184
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:09,387
I'm onto you all.

1185
00:59:09,819 --> 00:59:10,775
Ladies and gentlemen,

1186
00:59:10,855 --> 00:59:13,888
put your hands together
for whatever that was.

1187
00:59:33,377 --> 00:59:35,313
You did good, Ronnie.

1188
00:59:35,812 --> 00:59:37,614
Where'd you learn to dance like that?

1189
00:59:39,248 --> 00:59:41,485
Hebrew school.

1190
00:59:48,392 --> 00:59:50,427
You were supposed to
be there for us tonight.

1191
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:52,697
You had a job to do.

1192
00:59:52,863 --> 00:59:54,731
And now you're trashed.

1193
00:59:55,265 --> 00:59:57,187
See, I just... I don't
understand this, man.

1194
00:59:57,267 --> 00:59:59,690
If you really think
that there's drugs here,

1195
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:00,924
call the police.

1196
01:00:01,004 --> 01:00:02,572
And then what?

1197
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:05,663
We get a few minnows?
The big whale gets away?

1198
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:07,230
Do you hear yourself when you talk?

1199
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:10,433
I dare you to say one thing
without the ocean in it.

1200
01:00:10,513 --> 01:00:11,801
I dare you.

1201
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:13,114
We were depending on you tonight.

1202
01:00:14,384 --> 01:00:17,021
And you fucked up... Again.

1203
01:00:20,524 --> 01:00:22,092
Watch yourself.

1204
01:00:26,029 --> 01:00:27,250
Really?

1205
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,118
Get this through your head, Mitch.

1206
01:00:29,198 --> 01:00:32,723
You're not a cop. You're
not the fucking Equalizer.

1207
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:34,223
You're a lifeguard, Mitch,

1208
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:36,125
who sits in his fucking tower all day,

1209
01:00:36,205 --> 01:00:38,996
'cause that's the only place
he has any sort of power.

1210
01:00:39,076 --> 01:00:40,830
This is the real world, Mitch.

1211
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,299
Lifeguards can't do shit.

1212
01:00:42,379 --> 01:00:43,713
Come on.

1213
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:46,117
Don't fucking touch me.

1214
01:00:46,216 --> 01:00:48,385
- Let's go.
- Or what?

1215
01:00:48,785 --> 01:00:50,320
What're you gonna do, Mitch?

1216
01:00:56,026 --> 01:00:57,259
Shit.

1217
01:00:58,328 --> 01:00:59,382
- Shit.
- I didn't touch you.

1218
01:00:59,462 --> 01:01:00,764
You dick.

1219
01:01:03,232 --> 01:01:04,701
Cool off, pool boy.

1220
01:01:10,207 --> 01:01:12,275
That's him! The Vomit Comet!

1221
01:01:15,812 --> 01:01:18,000
What are you guys standing around for?

1222
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,480
Let's do some shots!

1223
01:01:24,821 --> 01:01:26,123
Whoo!

1224
01:02:33,656 --> 01:02:36,246
- Hey.
- Hey. Thank you.

1225
01:02:36,326 --> 01:02:38,214
Summer, this is your day today.

1226
01:02:38,294 --> 01:02:40,597
Yeah, I know it.

1227
01:02:48,504 --> 01:02:50,140
Mitch?

1228
01:02:52,576 --> 01:02:53,897
Hey, man, I think, uh...

1229
01:02:53,977 --> 01:02:58,381
I think we both said a few things
last night that we didn't mean.

1230
01:02:58,948 --> 01:03:01,371
Not me. I meant every word.

1231
01:03:01,451 --> 01:03:02,705
Come on, man.

1232
01:03:02,785 --> 01:03:05,388
You've never gotten drunk and
said something you don't mean?

1233
01:03:06,323 --> 01:03:07,825
Seriously?

1234
01:03:08,058 --> 01:03:10,628
I fucked up, man. I know that.

1235
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,666
I'm sorry.

1236
01:03:24,174 --> 01:03:26,443
I watched you win two gold medals.

1237
01:03:27,643 --> 01:03:30,748
You were amazing when it was just you.

1238
01:03:32,248 --> 01:03:33,304
But when it came to the relay,

1239
01:03:33,384 --> 01:03:36,653
being part of your team, your
Olympic team, your family,

1240
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,790
you blew it. 'Cause you're selfish.

1241
01:03:41,725 --> 01:03:44,595
Baywatch is our team.
Baywatch is our family.

1242
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:46,563
These are the keys to our house.

1243
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:48,286
But you've proven to me

1244
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,534
that you don't want to
be part of this family.

1245
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:52,702
So you're done.

1246
01:03:53,703 --> 01:03:55,359
'Cause the only thing you give a shit about

1247
01:03:55,439 --> 01:03:57,407
is yourself and your medals.

1248
01:03:58,607 --> 01:04:00,243
You talking 'bout this medal?

1249
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:11,408
Wow, that's really impressive.

1250
01:04:11,488 --> 01:04:13,109
Don't you have two of them, though?

1251
01:04:13,189 --> 01:04:14,657
That's not the point.

1252
01:04:15,459 --> 01:04:16,313
That's polluting.

1253
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:18,915
Listen, Mitch, I know I messed up, okay?

1254
01:04:18,995 --> 01:04:20,496
I should have listened.

1255
01:04:21,131 --> 01:04:23,266
I want to be a part of this team.

1256
01:04:24,701 --> 01:04:27,671
And I will not let you down again, I swear.

1257
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,976
And by the way, I think
you're right about Leeds.

1258
01:04:33,576 --> 01:04:36,033
And the Councilman...
Councilman... What's his face?

1259
01:04:36,113 --> 01:04:37,935
- Councilman Rodriguez.
- Uh... Yeah.

1260
01:04:38,015 --> 01:04:40,203
Rodriguez, that's it. The dead guy.

1261
01:04:40,283 --> 01:04:42,605
He had this watch. It was a nice TAG watch.

1262
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:44,473
Yeah, I've seen that watch, too.

1263
01:04:44,553 --> 01:04:46,522
On one of Leeds's thugs.

1264
01:04:47,024 --> 01:04:48,492
That's it. See?

1265
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,329
I want to help, man. And I want to...

1266
01:04:54,497 --> 01:04:55,832
I want to help.

1267
01:05:06,209 --> 01:05:08,478
All right. I'll give you another shot.

1268
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:12,335
Councilman Rodriguez is
connected to all of this somehow.

1269
01:05:12,415 --> 01:05:15,286
And the coroner's office
just released his body.

1270
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:16,887
And I got a plan.

1271
01:05:25,294 --> 01:05:28,384
Ah, guys, I still don't understand
what part of the plan this is.

1272
01:05:28,464 --> 01:05:31,455
- Just go with the flow, Brody.
- Yeah, you were in a very bad accident.

1273
01:05:31,535 --> 01:05:33,623
- It was all your fucking fault.
- We're all really, really sad.

1274
01:05:33,703 --> 01:05:37,293
It was my fault? Why was it my fault?

1275
01:05:37,373 --> 01:05:39,663
Come on, guys. I need a bigger coat.

1276
01:05:39,743 --> 01:05:41,565
There's no coat in here
that's gonna fit you.

1277
01:05:41,645 --> 01:05:43,747
- You got a better idea?
- I think I do.

1278
01:05:47,216 --> 01:05:48,685
But you're not gonna like it.

1279
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:54,478
Okay, clear. Come on, let's go.

1280
01:05:54,558 --> 01:05:56,413
Okay, left turn, left turn.

1281
01:05:56,493 --> 01:05:57,580
What the fuck?

1282
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,116
Who taught you how to
drive, Stevie fucking Wonder?

1283
01:06:00,196 --> 01:06:02,319
You're huge, man. Very hard to control.

1284
01:06:02,399 --> 01:06:04,221
Just get me to the
morgue. That's all I said.

1285
01:06:04,301 --> 01:06:05,688
I'm taking us to the morgue. Go left.

1286
01:06:05,768 --> 01:06:07,523
Left, left. Left turn.

1287
01:06:07,603 --> 01:06:09,092
Careful.

1288
01:06:09,172 --> 01:06:10,908
Okay. We're clear, we're clear.

1289
01:06:12,509 --> 01:06:13,877
Oh!

1290
01:06:14,844 --> 01:06:16,232
All right.

1291
01:06:16,312 --> 01:06:17,433
- Oh, no.
- What?

1292
01:06:17,513 --> 01:06:19,168
- What does that say?
- "Morgue."

1293
01:06:19,248 --> 01:06:20,983
Exactly.

1294
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,819
I got us to the morgue.

1295
01:06:23,285 --> 01:06:25,955
- Nice. Good job.
- Yeah.

1296
01:06:26,256 --> 01:06:27,958
These disguises are awesome.

1297
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:30,027
I actually feel like a doctor.

1298
01:06:35,332 --> 01:06:36,700
Oh, no.

1299
01:06:37,267 --> 01:06:39,455
- Read me his toe tag.
- It smells like yogurt.

1300
01:06:39,535 --> 01:06:40,971
Oh, Jesus.

1301
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,907
"2816."

1302
01:06:49,478 --> 01:06:50,847
Read me line 12.

1303
01:06:51,781 --> 01:06:53,117
Jesus.

1304
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,119
Line 12. "Alveoli are clean."

1305
01:06:55,384 --> 01:06:57,621
Wait, that means that there
was no smoke in his lungs.

1306
01:06:58,154 --> 01:06:59,576
- So how did he die?
- That's the question.

1307
01:06:59,656 --> 01:07:01,625
McDreamy, get over here.
I need you to help me.

1308
01:07:01,924 --> 01:07:03,559
Oh, God, what?

1309
01:07:04,761 --> 01:07:06,683
Dude.

1310
01:07:06,763 --> 01:07:08,752
I need you to check his
taint for needle marks.

1311
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:10,386
You want me to check his taint?

1312
01:07:10,466 --> 01:07:12,221
Don't be a baby. Lift his scrotum.

1313
01:07:12,301 --> 01:07:13,290
Not touching the man's scrotum.

1314
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:15,491
Lift his ball sac and
check for anything unusual.

1315
01:07:15,571 --> 01:07:16,973
There's... Fuck.

1316
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:19,841
Oh, my God.

1317
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:27,237
- Dude, it's a taint, man, it's a taint.
- You didn't even look.

1318
01:07:27,317 --> 01:07:28,719
Ugh, my God.

1319
01:07:29,685 --> 01:07:32,476
Dude, there's been gloves
here literally the entire time.

1320
01:07:32,556 --> 01:07:35,893
You didn't even say
anything. Yeah... That...

1321
01:07:37,627 --> 01:07:41,064
Oh, I'm going in.

1322
01:07:41,198 --> 01:07:42,652
- All right.
- Tell me what you see.

1323
01:07:42,732 --> 01:07:45,888
Hair. Lots of hair.
Definitely not a groomer.

1324
01:07:45,968 --> 01:07:48,070
Get deeper. Lift the balls up higher.

1325
01:07:48,404 --> 01:07:51,174
- And get closer.
- Oh, God, it stinks.

1326
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,596
I don't know, man. There's a big something.

1327
01:07:53,676 --> 01:07:55,511
There's something. Oh, there is a hole.

1328
01:07:56,212 --> 01:07:58,148
- That's just his butthole.
- Smile.

1329
01:08:00,482 --> 01:08:03,272
Good job, doc. I'm posting that.

1330
01:08:03,352 --> 01:08:05,822
Do not post that. The Internet is forever.

1331
01:08:06,756 --> 01:08:08,745
It's just a handful of ball sac.

1332
01:08:08,825 --> 01:08:10,594
It's disgusting.

1333
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,762
Oh, God.

1334
01:08:13,495 --> 01:08:15,618
Dude, I can't take you
seriously when the dick is out.

1335
01:08:15,698 --> 01:08:16,685
Can you please just cover the dick?

1336
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:18,365
You cover the dick. I'm busy.

1337
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:21,625
All right, check this out.

1338
01:08:21,705 --> 01:08:24,827
Cervical fractures of the fifth,
sixth and seventh vertebrae.

1339
01:08:24,907 --> 01:08:27,677
That's how he was killed. Broken neck.

1340
01:08:28,411 --> 01:08:29,399
So, what? That could
have happened any time.

1341
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:31,501
I mean, you jumped off
the boat with him, right?

1342
01:08:31,581 --> 01:08:34,171
You can literally swan
dive down a flight of stairs

1343
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:35,404
and not break that many vertebrae.

1344
01:08:35,484 --> 01:08:37,554
This was done on purpose.

1345
01:08:37,653 --> 01:08:39,475
Why has no one else figured this out?

1346
01:08:39,555 --> 01:08:42,091
What are you talking
about? Figured what out?

1347
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:44,314
Broken neck in multiple places.

1348
01:08:44,394 --> 01:08:46,715
No smoke in his lungs,
which probably means he died

1349
01:08:46,795 --> 01:08:48,318
before that boat was even on fire.

1350
01:08:48,398 --> 01:08:50,187
The reason why no one has figured this out?

1351
01:08:50,267 --> 01:08:51,568
It's murder.

1352
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:53,857
- And someone's covering it up.
- Holy shit.

1353
01:08:53,937 --> 01:08:55,324
In which case,

1354
01:08:55,404 --> 01:08:56,525
I should go interrogate those girls.

1355
01:08:56,605 --> 01:08:58,862
No, those girls were too high.
They don't remember anything.

1356
01:08:58,942 --> 01:09:01,043
All the more reason to investigate.

1357
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:04,466
Oh, shit. Someone's coming.

1358
01:09:04,546 --> 01:09:06,048
- Hide. Hide!
- Put him away.

1359
01:09:11,821 --> 01:09:13,510
- What do we do now?
- Now we hide.

1360
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:15,726
Hide? Where?

1361
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:22,719
I don't like confined spaces.

1362
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,488
This was a bad idea.

1363
01:09:25,568 --> 01:09:26,970
Stop being a baby.

1364
01:09:27,304 --> 01:09:28,158
Oh, my God!

1365
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:30,226
Shut your mouth. You're
gonna get us caught.

1366
01:09:30,306 --> 01:09:31,894
I'm laying on a dead old lady.

1367
01:09:31,974 --> 01:09:33,496
Well, she's not going to
bite you, for Christ's sakes.

1368
01:09:33,576 --> 01:09:34,598
- Will you shut up?
- Our drawers are empty.

1369
01:09:34,678 --> 01:09:35,565
Why'd you pick that drawer?

1370
01:09:35,645 --> 01:09:37,800
I'm the only one with a body in my drawer?

1371
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,769
Shh. Shut up!

1372
01:09:38,849 --> 01:09:41,270
She smells like cheese toast and chowder.

1373
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,506
Holy Christ. You just
tickled another man's taint.

1374
01:09:43,586 --> 01:09:45,022
Who gives a shit right now?

1375
01:09:50,426 --> 01:09:51,894
This was a bad...

1376
01:09:52,562 --> 01:09:53,550
Something just dripped on me.

1377
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,097
Shut your mouth.

1378
01:09:55,364 --> 01:09:56,519
- What is it?
- It's all right.

1379
01:09:56,599 --> 01:09:58,688
Oh, my God.

1380
01:09:58,768 --> 01:10:00,924
- It did it again.
- Nothing's dripping on me.

1381
01:10:01,004 --> 01:10:03,926
- Listen to me. Formaldehyde melts fat.
- What?

1382
01:10:04,006 --> 01:10:06,595
That's what's dripping on
your face, necrotic liquid fat.

1383
01:10:06,675 --> 01:10:07,831
Now will you shut the fuck up?

1384
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:08,998
What the fuck did you just say?

1385
01:10:09,078 --> 01:10:10,733
Just sit back and shut up.

1386
01:10:10,813 --> 01:10:12,882
Shh. Stop complaining.

1387
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:20,056
Guys, someone's coming. Be quiet.

1388
01:10:22,892 --> 01:10:24,328
It's him.

1389
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:36,425
Rodriguez. It is him.

1390
01:10:36,505 --> 01:10:38,074
You got the fake files?

1391
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,367
Relax.

1392
01:10:44,447 --> 01:10:46,713
We're only here 'cause
you broke his fucking neck.

1393
01:10:51,587 --> 01:10:52,686
It's all good.

1394
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:55,511
- God damn it. Keep it together.
- No!

1395
01:10:55,591 --> 01:10:57,447
- Oh, shit.
- That's it! I'm out!

1396
01:10:57,527 --> 01:10:59,096
No. God damn it!

1397
01:11:00,996 --> 01:11:03,132
- Shit!
- Fuck.

1398
01:11:06,669 --> 01:11:07,901
What do we do?

1399
01:11:24,621 --> 01:11:26,876
Hey, gentlemen.

1400
01:11:26,956 --> 01:11:29,824
Now that that's over, I'm
gonna need those files.

1401
01:11:31,193 --> 01:11:32,381
Shit.

1402
01:11:32,461 --> 01:11:35,417
That must be my phone. I probably
left it in the, uh, nap room.

1403
01:11:35,497 --> 01:11:37,967
- Shit.
- Fuck. Give me that phone.

1404
01:11:38,434 --> 01:11:39,956
Shit!

1405
01:11:40,036 --> 01:11:41,938
No, lifeguard.

1406
01:11:45,675 --> 01:11:47,878
That was a cheap shot, man!

1407
01:11:52,782 --> 01:11:54,151
Damn it.

1408
01:11:55,551 --> 01:11:56,506
I'll get the car.

1409
01:11:56,586 --> 01:11:58,320
All right, meet us on
the far side of the park!

1410
01:11:58,487 --> 01:12:00,856
- Come on, let's roll.
- Mitch, hold up.

1411
01:12:01,457 --> 01:12:02,893
Check this out.

1412
01:12:04,527 --> 01:12:07,015
Excuse me. That's a very nice scooter.

1413
01:12:07,095 --> 01:12:08,784
Have you ever seen the Olympics?

1414
01:12:08,864 --> 01:12:10,487
Why are you grabbing me so tight?

1415
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:11,787
Why the fuck are you driving?

1416
01:12:11,867 --> 01:12:14,203
Stay off the grass.
It's freshly fertilized.

1417
01:12:14,604 --> 01:12:15,824
Stay on the pathway.

1418
01:12:15,904 --> 01:12:17,594
I'm on the path, man. They're right there!

1419
01:12:17,674 --> 01:12:18,828
- Watch it, watch it!
- Shut up!

1420
01:12:18,908 --> 01:12:20,930
You got a beautiful border
collie right there. Don't hit him!

1421
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:22,465
You do not respect anything.

1422
01:12:22,545 --> 01:12:25,001
Whoa, whoa. Stop. Have some
respect. Mommies and babies.

1423
01:12:25,081 --> 01:12:26,702
- Mommies and babies.
- Yeah, I see them.

1424
01:12:26,782 --> 01:12:28,837
Go get them. Stay on the
pathway. You get the white one.

1425
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:30,953
All right. You're just
slowing me down, anyway.

1426
01:12:33,089 --> 01:12:34,958
Give me the phone.

1427
01:12:39,996 --> 01:12:41,262
Hey!

1428
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:01,004
Oh!

1429
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:04,054
Shit! Oh, my God. I can't
believe I just did that.

1430
01:13:04,653 --> 01:13:07,076
- I cannot believe I just did that!
- Hey, Summer. Here. Hey.

1431
01:13:07,156 --> 01:13:09,359
- Oh, my God!
- Where's your phone?

1432
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:15,083
That's not my phone!

1433
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:17,787
- Summer, you okay?
- That guy's got my phone.

1434
01:13:17,867 --> 01:13:20,470
- Nice work!
- Thanks!

1435
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:25,175
- Where'd he go?
- Oh, shit.

1436
01:13:37,185 --> 01:13:38,285
Mister, get off!

1437
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:44,394
Hey, Mitch, take this one.

1438
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,395
Yeah. Thanks, Mikey.

1439
01:13:48,764 --> 01:13:50,866
Hey, man, this is a wake-free zone!

1440
01:14:05,715 --> 01:14:07,017
Hey! Oh!

1441
01:14:59,836 --> 01:15:02,005
Hi, honey.

1442
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:04,293
I'm going to go get rid of the
bad man that's in your house.

1443
01:15:04,373 --> 01:15:06,109
Mmm. Eat your food.

1444
01:15:06,309 --> 01:15:08,078
Why is he here?

1445
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,235
I'm gonna need that phone.

1446
01:15:33,935 --> 01:15:35,305
This phone?

1447
01:15:39,408 --> 01:15:42,077
Whoops. Fuck your phone.

1448
01:15:42,745 --> 01:15:44,381
Oh, you're going night-night, bitch.

1449
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,939
<i>I'm a pig.</i>

1450
01:16:23,019 --> 01:16:24,806
Whoa, whoa, wait! Hey, hey.

1451
01:16:24,886 --> 01:16:26,141
No baby pictures.

1452
01:16:26,221 --> 01:16:28,692
- Have some class.
- You're right.

1453
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,449
It's bath time, shithead.

1454
01:16:56,452 --> 01:16:58,306
All right, Ellerbee, what
did we learn from the perps

1455
01:16:58,386 --> 01:16:59,408
after the interrogation?

1456
01:16:59,488 --> 01:17:01,309
The only perps here are you three.

1457
01:17:01,389 --> 01:17:04,279
Okay, you turned the canals
into the goddamned X Games.

1458
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:07,262
Yeah, that's 'cause we
were in lifeguard pursuit.

1459
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:09,532
Oh, okay. My bad.

1460
01:17:10,632 --> 01:17:13,855
Except for there's no fucking
such thing as "lifeguard pursuit"!

1461
01:17:13,935 --> 01:17:15,056
Police do pursuits!

1462
01:17:15,136 --> 01:17:19,108
When you do it, it's just some
guys chasing some other guys.

1463
01:17:19,274 --> 01:17:21,363
- No offense.
- None taken.

1464
01:17:21,443 --> 01:17:23,800
Hey, what are you saying? You're
just gonna let those guys walk?

1465
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,235
Okay, um, how do I explain this
so that you people understand?

1466
01:17:27,315 --> 01:17:28,650
"You people"?

1467
01:17:29,385 --> 01:17:30,687
"You people"?

1468
01:17:30,819 --> 01:17:32,207
Oh, you don't get to say that.

1469
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,689
You're just tan.

1470
01:17:34,523 --> 01:17:36,625
- Right on.
- Come on, brother.

1471
01:17:37,225 --> 01:17:39,261
Look, even if you were police,

1472
01:17:39,895 --> 01:17:41,317
which you're not,

1473
01:17:41,397 --> 01:17:44,386
and even if this was your
jurisdiction, which it isn't,

1474
01:17:44,466 --> 01:17:47,823
and even if you had
probable cause to pursue,

1475
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,706
which you definitely don't,

1476
01:17:50,172 --> 01:17:52,207
what you did would
still be totally illegal.

1477
01:17:52,908 --> 01:17:55,511
Okay, well, I mean, it's a good
thing we're not police, then.

1478
01:17:55,877 --> 01:18:00,215
It's like you purposely
only hear 1% of what I say.

1479
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:04,140
Mitch, did you pull Brody off the beach

1480
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,775
to break into the medical
examiner's office earlier today?

1481
01:18:06,855 --> 01:18:08,010
Yeah, you bet I did.

1482
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:09,845
Absolutely, 100% and here's why.

1483
01:18:09,925 --> 01:18:12,849
The Councilman's boating
accident was no accident at all.

1484
01:18:12,929 --> 01:18:14,282
He had no smoke in his lungs,

1485
01:18:14,362 --> 01:18:15,784
his neck was broken in multiple places.

1486
01:18:15,864 --> 01:18:19,020
Which means he was probably dead
before that boat even caught on fire.

1487
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,805
And our investigation has found
that all of this shady shit

1488
01:18:22,138 --> 01:18:23,706
leads right back to the Huntley.

1489
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:26,461
You don't do investigations.
You're lifeguards.

1490
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:28,197
Police do investigations.

1491
01:18:28,277 --> 01:18:29,465
When you do it,

1492
01:18:29,545 --> 01:18:32,234
it's just a bunch of guys
investigating another bunch of guys.

1493
01:18:32,314 --> 01:18:34,302
- No offense, you're included in that.
- None taken.

1494
01:18:34,382 --> 01:18:37,172
Do you have any proof of this conspiracy?

1495
01:18:37,252 --> 01:18:39,175
Yeah, absolutely. We
read the coroner's report.

1496
01:18:39,255 --> 01:18:41,778
It's all in there before
those other guys switched it.

1497
01:18:41,858 --> 01:18:44,279
Yeah, and I recorded the
whole thing on my cell phone.

1498
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:46,429
- Where's the cell phone?
- They destroyed it.

1499
01:18:47,196 --> 01:18:49,284
Oh. Okay.

1500
01:18:49,364 --> 01:18:52,455
So the only evidence that
you had was destroyed.

1501
01:18:52,535 --> 01:18:56,458
Exactly. All the evidence... Pfft!

1502
01:18:56,538 --> 01:18:58,327
Gone. Doesn't exist.

1503
01:18:58,407 --> 01:19:01,029
They're bad guys and they
don't want us to have it.

1504
01:19:01,109 --> 01:19:02,331
Okay.

1505
01:19:02,411 --> 01:19:03,933
Let me try to explain this to you

1506
01:19:04,013 --> 01:19:05,067
in a way that you people can understand.

1507
01:19:05,147 --> 01:19:06,469
"You people"? There it is again.

1508
01:19:06,549 --> 01:19:09,005
- Hey, hey. Be cool.
- There it is again.

1509
01:19:09,085 --> 01:19:10,172
Just trying to figure out what the fuck was

1510
01:19:10,252 --> 01:19:11,274
with "you people."

1511
01:19:11,354 --> 01:19:12,722
All right, now, look.

1512
01:19:13,154 --> 01:19:17,193
Leave law enforcement to the police. Okay?

1513
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:21,563
And you guys just do the
jobs that I hired you to do.

1514
01:19:22,098 --> 01:19:24,386
You remember? The lifeguarding stuff.

1515
01:19:24,466 --> 01:19:27,737
- Splish, splash.
- Otherwise, I'll fire you.

1516
01:19:29,604 --> 01:19:31,740
Now I gotta go clean up
this mess that you made.

1517
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,742
Boom.

1518
01:19:35,443 --> 01:19:39,414
Obviously, you have every reason
to be upset, and I apologize.

1519
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:51,180
So, do you always do the opposite
of what people ask you to do?

1520
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,796
Because I don't know,
man, it looks clear to me.

1521
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:56,533
Nice and quiet.

1522
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,122
No, man, you got to look closer. I knew it.

1523
01:20:01,202 --> 01:20:02,257
Flynn's Seafood Company.

1524
01:20:02,337 --> 01:20:04,025
What about Flynn's Seafood Company?

1525
01:20:04,105 --> 01:20:06,595
They're the ones who supply all
the fish to the Huntley Club, right?

1526
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:09,232
- So?
- So the question is,

1527
01:20:09,312 --> 01:20:11,514
who the fuck is Angelo?

1528
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:15,872
I saw barrels like that
down in the Huntley,

1529
01:20:15,952 --> 01:20:17,439
and now they're on the back of her yacht.

1530
01:20:17,519 --> 01:20:19,140
Oh, my God. Mitch, you're impossible.

1531
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,376
My gut says there's some
bad shit going on over there,

1532
01:20:21,456 --> 01:20:23,546
and my balls say we need to
go over there and check it out.

1533
01:20:23,626 --> 01:20:25,081
- Yeah. Your balls said that?
- Yes, they did.

1534
01:20:25,161 --> 01:20:26,448
'Cause my balls say,

1535
01:20:26,528 --> 01:20:27,684
"Hey, just take it easy
right here. Just chill."

1536
01:20:27,764 --> 01:20:30,567
Why the fuck do your balls
sound like three-year-old girls?

1537
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,868
I don't know, man.
That's just how they talk.

1538
01:20:33,702 --> 01:20:35,123
But they're wise.

1539
01:20:35,203 --> 01:20:36,324
Well, tell your shriveled, wise balls

1540
01:20:36,404 --> 01:20:38,975
we're going to the Huntley to
see what's in those barrels.

1541
01:20:43,078 --> 01:20:45,467
Dude, we are penetrating
the shit out of this place.

1542
01:20:45,547 --> 01:20:46,568
No, I think it's "infiltrate."

1543
01:20:46,648 --> 01:20:48,136
That's what we want to do. To infiltrate.

1544
01:20:48,216 --> 01:20:50,139
You know they're gonna be looking for us.

1545
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:51,439
That's why we're going undercover.

1546
01:20:51,519 --> 01:20:53,322
Undercover? In disguise?

1547
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:00,963
Remember. Undercover.

1548
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:03,365
- Undercover, yeah.
- Yeah.

1549
01:21:40,469 --> 01:21:42,491
Check it out. I'm undercover.

1550
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:44,059
Yeah. A little too undercover.

1551
01:21:44,139 --> 01:21:45,161
Why the fuck are you wearing makeup, dude?

1552
01:21:45,241 --> 01:21:47,395
What do you mean, why the
heck am I wearing makeup?

1553
01:21:47,475 --> 01:21:49,165
- It's a little much.
- What was I supposed to do?

1554
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:51,333
Well, what we're supposed to
do is find the fucking flakka.

1555
01:21:51,413 --> 01:21:53,783
- Oh, my God.
- Angelo's Fish Company. There it is.

1556
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:55,371
You are so selfish.

1557
01:21:55,451 --> 01:21:56,706
You think this was easy?

1558
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:58,306
It's very impressive, princess.

1559
01:21:58,386 --> 01:22:00,456
But please shut the fuck up and focus.

1560
01:22:08,296 --> 01:22:09,599
Come on.

1561
01:22:18,773 --> 01:22:21,229
- Holy shit.
- Whoa.

1562
01:22:21,309 --> 01:22:23,811
Can't believe Leeds is doing
that shit during the day.

1563
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:26,716
Yeah. That takes balls.

1564
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:29,638
Holy shit.

1565
01:22:29,718 --> 01:22:31,520
It's like <i>Breaking Bad</i> in there.

1566
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,723
Yeah, dude, <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

1567
01:22:34,723 --> 01:22:37,356
- You were right.
- Yeah, I was right.

1568
01:22:38,493 --> 01:22:39,648
Let's get him in!

1569
01:22:39,728 --> 01:22:41,250
- I got here.
- Right.

1570
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:43,498
- Yep.
- We're good.

1571
01:22:45,733 --> 01:22:47,734
- Grab his other leg.
- Got it.

1572
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,340
Get a stretcher ready.

1573
01:22:53,709 --> 01:22:56,465
Yeah, this is the police.
How can I help you, lifeguard?

1574
01:22:56,545 --> 01:22:58,733
Ellerbee, you got to get
down to the Huntley ASAP.

1575
01:22:58,813 --> 01:23:00,435
We found the drugs.

1576
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:02,238
Yeah, that sounds great, Mitch,

1577
01:23:02,318 --> 01:23:04,573
but right now I'm busy
dealing with another dead body.

1578
01:23:04,653 --> 01:23:07,208
<i>Oh, and this one's on your
beach. Did you hear that?</i>

1579
01:23:07,288 --> 01:23:09,745
First a councilman and now a shark attack.

1580
01:23:09,825 --> 01:23:11,279
That's crazy.

1581
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:12,680
Lifeguard coming through.

1582
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,483
You're still calling this
your jurisdiction, right?

1583
01:23:14,563 --> 01:23:16,699
<i>We haven't had a dead body
on the beach in years.</i>

1584
01:23:17,132 --> 01:23:18,388
<i>But this has got to be
connected to the Huntley.</i>

1585
01:23:18,468 --> 01:23:20,723
We found the drugs here. I'm
telling you. They're behind this.

1586
01:23:20,803 --> 01:23:23,725
Mitch, it's Thorpe, your boss.

1587
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:26,362
Look, stop with the Huntley crap, okay?

1588
01:23:26,442 --> 01:23:28,264
And don't even come down
here. We don't need you.

1589
01:23:28,344 --> 01:23:29,698
Just meet me back at headquarters.

1590
01:23:29,778 --> 01:23:33,048
Right now I gotta deal with
your new publicity nightmare.

1591
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:34,804
Fuck!

1592
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:35,971
<i>Emerald Bay is
reeling this afternoon</i>

1593
01:23:36,051 --> 01:23:39,074
<i>from the shocking discovery
of another dead body.</i>

1594
01:23:39,154 --> 01:23:41,376
<i>But in the wake of the recent
death of Councilman Rodriguez,</i>

1595
01:23:41,456 --> 01:23:43,412
<i>the locals here want answers.</i>

1596
01:23:43,492 --> 01:23:47,183
<i>I can't believe that no
one was at Tower One.</i>

1597
01:23:47,263 --> 01:23:48,864
I don't even know what to say.

1598
01:23:49,764 --> 01:23:51,386
Whose shift was it?

1599
01:23:51,466 --> 01:23:53,469
Sir, it was mine.

1600
01:23:54,236 --> 01:23:55,424
And where were you?

1601
01:23:55,504 --> 01:23:58,094
Stalking one of the most
prominent women in Emerald Bay?

1602
01:23:58,174 --> 01:24:00,662
Blatantly disregarding your jurisdiction?

1603
01:24:00,742 --> 01:24:02,698
Sir, I only stepped away
to check out the Huntley

1604
01:24:02,778 --> 01:24:04,800
- and find the flakka.
- I warned you.

1605
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,801
I warned you about sticking to your job.

1606
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:08,104
This wasn't even Mitch's fault.

1607
01:24:08,184 --> 01:24:09,805
You leave me no choice.

1608
01:24:09,885 --> 01:24:10,973
You're done.

1609
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:13,641
I want you off the beach.
I'm putting Brody in charge.

1610
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:16,211
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No way.

1611
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:17,513
There's not a chance... Hey...

1612
01:24:17,593 --> 01:24:18,915
You can do this in your sleep.

1613
01:24:18,995 --> 01:24:21,117
That's not what I'm saying. I
don't want the position. I don't...

1614
01:24:21,197 --> 01:24:23,184
You have two gold medals, okay?

1615
01:24:23,264 --> 01:24:25,888
You're like the Stephen
Hawking of swimming,

1616
01:24:25,968 --> 01:24:28,524
minus the total paralysis part.

1617
01:24:28,604 --> 01:24:30,826
Unless you want me to
replace you with someone else.

1618
01:24:30,906 --> 01:24:33,629
With all due respect, that job
should go to Stephanie Holden.

1619
01:24:33,709 --> 01:24:35,363
She knows the bay better than anyone.

1620
01:24:35,443 --> 01:24:38,613
I'm no longer interested
in your opinion, Buchannon.

1621
01:24:38,913 --> 01:24:40,449
Dismissed.

1622
01:24:46,487 --> 01:24:48,924
Brody. Brody, hang back.

1623
01:24:49,457 --> 01:24:51,180
Okay, it's just me and you now.

1624
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,748
If you can help me keep
your new pals in line,

1625
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:55,650
I can make sure that you stick around here

1626
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,600
for a long, long time.

1627
01:24:57,933 --> 01:25:00,936
And if you don't, your
probation could get fucked up.

1628
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:06,261
- Good talk, Brody.
- Okay.

1629
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:08,877
You're my dawg, right?
I'll see you tomorrow.

1630
01:25:09,444 --> 01:25:10,880
Bring it in.

1631
01:25:11,813 --> 01:25:13,682
I fucked it up.

1632
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:17,520
Turn in your trunks, Mitch.

1633
01:25:21,023 --> 01:25:22,557
I'm going to go.

1634
01:25:27,763 --> 01:25:29,417
What, you think that I wanted this?

1635
01:25:29,497 --> 01:25:30,885
- It kinda looks like you did.
- What?

1636
01:25:30,965 --> 01:25:32,555
If anyone should get the
job it should be Stephanie.

1637
01:25:32,635 --> 01:25:34,070
No shit. I couldn't agree more.

1638
01:25:34,769 --> 01:25:35,791
What would you have done?

1639
01:25:35,871 --> 01:25:37,592
I wouldn't have taken the job,

1640
01:25:37,672 --> 01:25:38,927
even if they'd offered it to me.

1641
01:25:39,007 --> 01:25:40,729
It was not an offer, it was a trap.

1642
01:25:40,809 --> 01:25:43,112
Guys, guys, come on. Please.

1643
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,300
All right? I need you
to work together to help.

1644
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:48,470
Bieber here figure out why
there's a dead body on our beach,

1645
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:51,254
and how Leeds is bringing
in drugs to the bay.

1646
01:25:57,925 --> 01:25:59,661
Good luck.

1647
01:26:03,698 --> 01:26:04,920
Mitch.

1648
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,769
Yo, Mitch!

1649
01:26:15,544 --> 01:26:17,113
I'm sorry.

1650
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:28,757
I want you to have something.

1651
01:26:29,858 --> 01:26:31,227
My mentor gave me this.

1652
01:26:31,727 --> 01:26:33,895
It's the keys to Lifeguard Tower One.

1653
01:26:36,564 --> 01:26:37,899
Your new post.

1654
01:26:38,334 --> 01:26:40,036
No. I'm not ready.

1655
01:26:40,903 --> 01:26:42,638
I'm not ready for this, man.

1656
01:26:42,737 --> 01:26:44,272
They need you.

1657
01:27:01,357 --> 01:27:04,627
<i>Hi, Mitch. Just checking
in on you again.</i>

1658
01:27:04,727 --> 01:27:06,993
<i>Uh, please call us back.
We're worried about you.</i>

1659
01:27:09,364 --> 01:27:10,463
No, thanks, man.

1660
01:27:12,734 --> 01:27:14,036
Excuse me, ma'am...

1661
01:27:32,755 --> 01:27:34,976
<i>Yo, Mitch. It's Brody.</i>

1662
01:27:35,056 --> 01:27:37,680
<i>I hit you on the C.B., so
I know you're listening.</i>

1663
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,016
<i>I hope you haven't gone crazy and
started eating carbs or something.</i>

1664
01:27:42,096 --> 01:27:45,054
<i>Everyone says hi. Come back, man.</i>

1665
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:47,269
<i>I could really use
your help, brother.</i>

1666
01:28:03,618 --> 01:28:06,641
You know, well, it all depends
on the data plan that you want.

1667
01:28:06,721 --> 01:28:07,922
Internet, everything like that?

1668
01:28:08,489 --> 01:28:10,645
Oh, it's all fantastic
with the Internet, sure.

1669
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:12,881
It's Internet-savvy in function

1670
01:28:12,961 --> 01:28:14,416
- and there's broadband...
- All right.

1671
01:28:14,496 --> 01:28:15,717
you gotta have that. Yeah, sure.

1672
01:28:15,797 --> 01:28:20,355
Samsung has all the capabilities
of the I.T. process, and, uh...

1673
01:28:20,435 --> 01:28:22,238
Mind if I cut in for a second?

1674
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,025
What are you doing here?

1675
01:28:24,105 --> 01:28:25,972
I'm here to remind you who you are.

1676
01:28:29,577 --> 01:28:31,099
Come on, buddy.

1677
01:28:31,179 --> 01:28:33,114
Snap out of it!

1678
01:28:35,951 --> 01:28:37,386
Shoes?

1679
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,742
You're wearing worker man shoes?

1680
01:28:40,822 --> 01:28:43,091
Really, how far have you fallen?

1681
01:28:43,459 --> 01:28:45,728
- Far.
- I'd love to buy a...

1682
01:28:46,828 --> 01:28:48,930
- Mitch?
- Yes, Mitch.

1683
01:28:49,465 --> 01:28:50,818
Come on, man.

1684
01:28:50,898 --> 01:28:53,268
You don't just protect the bay.

1685
01:28:53,969 --> 01:28:55,371
You are the bay.

1686
01:28:55,903 --> 01:28:58,407
Mitch, the bay needs you.

1687
01:29:10,818 --> 01:29:13,988
Hey, do you guys know of
any good bars around here?

1688
01:29:17,992 --> 01:29:20,496
Hey, do you guys know
where you can rent a bike?

1689
01:29:20,761 --> 01:29:21,716
Oh, yeah, right up that way.

1690
01:29:21,796 --> 01:29:22,784
- This way?
- Uh-huh.

1691
01:29:22,864 --> 01:29:23,720
Not too far away.

1692
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,267
All right, cool. Thank you, guys.

1693
01:29:27,669 --> 01:29:29,371
Sand grifters.

1694
01:29:42,783 --> 01:29:44,706
Get the fuck out of here! This is my beach!

1695
01:29:44,786 --> 01:29:46,989
All right, we're out of here!

1696
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:49,759
Whoa! Did you see that?

1697
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:04,326
Hey.

1698
01:30:04,406 --> 01:30:06,976
You guys want to help me
figure out whose stuff this is?

1699
01:30:07,075 --> 01:30:10,145
Yo, this cooler is... Cool.

1700
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,001
Yo, Ellerbee?

1701
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:15,871
What's up, man? How you doing?

1702
01:30:15,951 --> 01:30:19,707
Oh, Lieutenant Brody!
What you got in the cooler?

1703
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:22,144
Black market organs from
the Boogie Board Bandits?

1704
01:30:22,224 --> 01:30:24,546
Oh, you mean this?

1705
01:30:24,626 --> 01:30:25,881
No, no.

1706
01:30:25,961 --> 01:30:27,715
This is actually for you.

1707
01:30:27,795 --> 01:30:29,885
You see, I'm not Mitch, right?

1708
01:30:29,965 --> 01:30:31,185
I know my place.

1709
01:30:31,265 --> 01:30:34,068
I'm just a lifeguard. And that's it.

1710
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:36,625
I just want to make sure that you and I

1711
01:30:36,705 --> 01:30:38,527
start out on the right foot. That's it.

1712
01:30:38,607 --> 01:30:43,045
So I went ahead and got something
a little bit special for you.

1713
01:30:43,178 --> 01:30:46,448
Which is a double-chocolate
smoothie from Chen's.

1714
01:30:47,983 --> 01:30:49,552
- A double-chocolate smoothie?
- Yeah.

1715
01:30:50,586 --> 01:30:51,907
- From Chen's?
- They're the best.

1716
01:30:51,987 --> 01:30:53,489
You know, I shouldn't.

1717
01:30:54,188 --> 01:30:55,957
But it is my cheat day.

1718
01:30:58,894 --> 01:31:00,549
It's your cheat day.

1719
01:31:00,629 --> 01:31:01,997
Exactly.

1720
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:03,652
And by the way, I went ahead and added

1721
01:31:03,732 --> 01:31:05,868
that extra protein for you, dawg.

1722
01:31:06,667 --> 01:31:07,656
Oh, my man.

1723
01:31:07,736 --> 01:31:08,689
I know you're trying to keep up.

1724
01:31:08,769 --> 01:31:09,936
Yeah, man.

1725
01:31:23,751 --> 01:31:25,186
Summer.

1726
01:31:25,754 --> 01:31:28,187
Hey, Summer.

1727
01:31:30,058 --> 01:31:31,393
Come on, Summer.

1728
01:31:35,663 --> 01:31:37,899
I think I found something big here, okay?

1729
01:31:38,233 --> 01:31:39,535
I really need your help.

1730
01:31:42,037 --> 01:31:43,372
Please?

1731
01:31:45,239 --> 01:31:46,595
You took marine biology, right?

1732
01:31:46,675 --> 01:31:47,977
Yeah.

1733
01:31:48,076 --> 01:31:50,479
Look at these. Tell me what you think.

1734
01:31:50,946 --> 01:31:53,983
Do these look like shark bites to you?

1735
01:31:54,683 --> 01:31:55,703
Huh.

1736
01:31:55,783 --> 01:31:57,573
No, they don't all look like shark bites.

1737
01:31:57,653 --> 01:31:59,084
Hey, let me take a look.

1738
01:32:01,223 --> 01:32:02,778
Oh, God, I can't deal with blood.

1739
01:32:02,858 --> 01:32:05,628
I mean, that one might be.

1740
01:32:06,428 --> 01:32:07,849
Those definitely are not.

1741
01:32:07,929 --> 01:32:10,018
So they could be, like, knife wounds.

1742
01:32:10,098 --> 01:32:11,400
Yeah, maybe.

1743
01:32:13,801 --> 01:32:15,104
Oh, my God, that's Dave!

1744
01:32:16,071 --> 01:32:17,506
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1745
01:32:17,973 --> 01:32:19,595
Hey, stop looking at the picture, dude.

1746
01:32:19,675 --> 01:32:20,862
Ronnie, Ronnie, what did you just say?

1747
01:32:20,942 --> 01:32:22,064
- That's Dave.
- Who's Dave?

1748
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,165
I used to work with him.

1749
01:32:23,245 --> 01:32:24,332
What do you mean? Doing what?

1750
01:32:24,412 --> 01:32:26,201
Tech stuff.

1751
01:32:26,281 --> 01:32:28,069
- You wouldn't understand.
- I would understand!

1752
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:29,136
What kind of tech stuff?

1753
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:30,671
Holy shit! That's it.

1754
01:32:30,751 --> 01:32:32,140
Dave told me that he was working with Leeds

1755
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,975
on something for the Huntley.

1756
01:32:34,055 --> 01:32:36,144
Oh, my God. Fucking Mitch was right.

1757
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:39,648
Both of these bodies were
dead before they hit the water.

1758
01:32:39,728 --> 01:32:40,983
Mitch got set up.

1759
01:32:41,063 --> 01:32:44,099
Leeds got rid of him
and we're probably next.

1760
01:32:44,366 --> 01:32:45,319
Shit.

1761
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:47,122
Ronnie, um, I need your help.

1762
01:32:47,202 --> 01:32:48,623
- No.
- Yes.

1763
01:32:48,703 --> 01:32:49,890
- No.
- Yes.

1764
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,960
- Uh-uh.
- Yes. Please?

1765
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,694
- Okay, fine.
- We really appreciate it.

1766
01:32:53,774 --> 01:32:55,796
Because as much as I know about laptops,

1767
01:32:55,876 --> 01:32:57,377
I don't know shit about computers.

1768
01:32:59,814 --> 01:33:02,269
Uh, so Dave had access to Leeds's server.

1769
01:33:02,349 --> 01:33:03,971
Uh, her server, you mean her network.

1770
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:05,274
Yeah, her network. That's what I meant.

1771
01:33:05,354 --> 01:33:09,176
Okay. So we just take a flash
drive and we plug it in, you know.

1772
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:12,180
Get into her cloud and then
steal all her cookies, right?

1773
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:13,180
And then we're...

1774
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,965
Straight through the firewall.

1775
01:33:16,297 --> 01:33:18,319
Literally none of what
you said made any sense.

1776
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:19,220
Straight over the firewall.

1777
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,322
It's not like a physical thing you do.

1778
01:33:20,402 --> 01:33:22,323
Okay, I don't know what I'm
talking about here, dude.

1779
01:33:22,403 --> 01:33:24,605
- Just... Can you do it?
- Yeah, it's done.

1780
01:33:24,739 --> 01:33:25,827
It's been done this entire time?

1781
01:33:25,907 --> 01:33:27,095
- Yeah, man.
- Oh, shit,

1782
01:33:27,175 --> 01:33:28,162
well, what did we find?

1783
01:33:28,242 --> 01:33:29,363
We found a lot of dirt.

1784
01:33:29,443 --> 01:33:32,213
Drug dirt, real estate dirt, yacht dirt.

1785
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,135
"Dirt"?

1786
01:33:34,215 --> 01:33:35,903
What the hell are we supposed
to do with dirt, Ronnie?

1787
01:33:35,983 --> 01:33:37,139
I meant evidence.

1788
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:38,340
- Oh, evidence.
- Evidence.

1789
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:40,175
Well, why didn't you say so, man?

1790
01:33:40,255 --> 01:33:42,591
- Heck, yeah!
- Thank God you're pretty.

1791
01:33:43,358 --> 01:33:45,260
I'm really proud of you, man.

1792
01:33:47,194 --> 01:33:48,817
<i>Guys, we did some digging.</i>

1793
01:33:48,897 --> 01:33:50,751
And Mitch was right.

1794
01:33:50,831 --> 01:33:53,668
The Huntley is a front
for a giant drug operation.

1795
01:33:53,801 --> 01:33:56,090
But I figured out it's
not about drugs for Leeds,

1796
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:57,858
it's about real estate.

1797
01:33:57,938 --> 01:34:00,141
And she's planning on making
the entire bay private.

1798
01:34:01,475 --> 01:34:03,931
- Yeah, but the town would never let her.
- Yes, it will.

1799
01:34:04,011 --> 01:34:06,367
Because she has every single
politician in this town

1800
01:34:06,447 --> 01:34:07,402
on her payroll.

1801
01:34:07,482 --> 01:34:08,903
Rodriguez, the taint guy.

1802
01:34:08,983 --> 01:34:10,971
- What about the business owners?
- Yeah.

1803
01:34:11,051 --> 01:34:13,841
Well, most of them sold out and
signed away their properties.

1804
01:34:13,921 --> 01:34:15,743
Leeds blackmailed the ones who didn't

1805
01:34:15,823 --> 01:34:17,946
and used Dave to help
hack into their accounts.

1806
01:34:18,026 --> 01:34:20,448
I mean, she's like some sort
of modern-day J. Edgar Hoover.

1807
01:34:20,528 --> 01:34:21,817
The vacuum guy.

1808
01:34:21,897 --> 01:34:23,050
No.

1809
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,220
But there was one holdout.

1810
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,122
- Who?
- Chen.

1811
01:34:27,202 --> 01:34:28,924
And if anything happens to him,

1812
01:34:29,004 --> 01:34:31,039
his property goes back to the city.

1813
01:34:32,474 --> 01:34:33,894
Who do you think they're gonna sell it to?

1814
01:34:33,974 --> 01:34:36,131
- We have to warn him.
- I tried.

1815
01:34:36,211 --> 01:34:38,366
- No one's seen him for days.
- What?

1816
01:34:38,446 --> 01:34:41,269
But Leeds is having a
party on her yacht tonight.

1817
01:34:41,349 --> 01:34:44,286
I guarantee you, she found a way
to get that guy into her boat.

1818
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,156
Which is why we're gonna go to that party.

1819
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:49,411
What?

1820
01:34:49,491 --> 01:34:52,747
Summer, you and I are
going to find the flakka.

1821
01:34:52,827 --> 01:34:54,483
You guys find Chen.

1822
01:34:54,563 --> 01:34:56,784
Will it work? Maybe.

1823
01:34:56,864 --> 01:34:58,886
Will there be some surprises along the way?

1824
01:34:58,966 --> 01:35:00,421
Abso-fucking-lutely.

1825
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:02,403
Is anyone going to die?

1826
01:35:03,004 --> 01:35:05,961
I don't know. Maybe Ronnie.

1827
01:35:06,041 --> 01:35:07,095
Sorry, what?

1828
01:35:07,175 --> 01:35:09,344
But we are Baywatch.

1829
01:35:11,145 --> 01:35:12,613
We save lives.

1830
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,283
I know because you guys saved mine.

1831
01:35:17,352 --> 01:35:19,587
Let's go kick that bitch's ass.

1832
01:35:20,221 --> 01:35:22,120
- Let's do it.
- For Mitch.

1833
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:43,244
Thank you.

1834
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:49,104
- Lifeguards, this is a surprise.
- Oh, hi!

1835
01:35:49,184 --> 01:35:53,207
Victoria, we wanted to come
here in person and tell you

1836
01:35:53,287 --> 01:35:56,144
how excited we are to be working with you

1837
01:35:56,224 --> 01:35:59,494
instead of against you, now that, um...

1838
01:36:00,127 --> 01:36:01,916
- Now that...
- Mitch is gone.

1839
01:36:01,996 --> 01:36:05,519
He's gone, so all we care
about now is protecting the bay.

1840
01:36:05,599 --> 01:36:07,522
And we know you feel the same.

1841
01:36:07,602 --> 01:36:09,872
Oh, I do.

1842
01:36:10,037 --> 01:36:11,905
I always knew I liked you two.

1843
01:36:14,142 --> 01:36:17,179
- Enjoy the party.
- You look amazing, by the way.

1844
01:36:17,479 --> 01:36:20,149
Well, someone has to.

1845
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:31,979
What? What are you wearing?
Where are your sleeves?

1846
01:36:32,059 --> 01:36:33,348
Listen, I know where the flakka is.

1847
01:36:33,428 --> 01:36:34,582
What, where? Under the boat?

1848
01:36:34,662 --> 01:36:36,016
Yeah. Potentially.

1849
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,533
Please don't die.

1850
01:36:38,032 --> 01:36:39,254
Do you think we should kiss?

1851
01:36:39,334 --> 01:36:40,322
I think we should kiss.

1852
01:36:40,402 --> 01:36:43,172
Otherwise, we may never know

1853
01:36:44,139 --> 01:36:46,126
what it was like. If I die...

1854
01:36:46,206 --> 01:36:47,875
Maybe we should talk about it later.

1855
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:50,965
It was worth a try.

1856
01:36:51,045 --> 01:36:52,814
- It was a good try.
- Ah, fuck. All right.

1857
01:36:56,251 --> 01:36:57,538
Okay.

1858
01:36:57,618 --> 01:37:00,255
Don't do anything too stupid.

1859
01:37:00,554 --> 01:37:01,856
I won't.

1860
01:38:00,047 --> 01:38:01,101
Summer. Summer!

1861
01:38:01,181 --> 01:38:02,269
Yeah, hey.

1862
01:38:02,349 --> 01:38:04,339
She's been smuggling it under
the boat this entire time.

1863
01:38:04,419 --> 01:38:06,387
- No shit?
- We have to let Mitch know.

1864
01:38:06,653 --> 01:38:07,774
Okay, yeah.

1865
01:38:07,854 --> 01:38:09,925
But Mitch hasn't answered
the phone since he was fired.

1866
01:38:10,291 --> 01:38:11,593
Ah, fuck.

1867
01:38:12,493 --> 01:38:13,515
The C.B.! Use the C.B.

1868
01:38:13,595 --> 01:38:15,449
- He's always listening on the C.B.
- Okay, yeah.

1869
01:38:15,529 --> 01:38:17,952
Tell him, Brody found the flakka

1870
01:38:18,032 --> 01:38:21,555
and that he needs to meet
us at the marina at 0900.

1871
01:38:21,635 --> 01:38:24,725
0900 is 9:00 a.m., so
9:00 p.m. would be 2100.

1872
01:38:24,805 --> 01:38:27,461
That system is so stupid and flawed.

1873
01:38:27,541 --> 01:38:29,965
Okay, well, militaries
use it all over the world.

1874
01:38:30,045 --> 01:38:31,343
But I'll tell him 2100.

1875
01:38:40,388 --> 01:38:41,722
Hey, guys.

1876
01:38:47,295 --> 01:38:49,731
I'll bet Lurch over
here knows where Chen is.

1877
01:38:55,169 --> 01:38:56,992
Mitch, if you can hear me, you were right.

1878
01:38:57,072 --> 01:38:58,771
We found the drugs on Leeds's boat.

1879
01:39:00,207 --> 01:39:01,576
Shit!

1880
01:39:04,078 --> 01:39:05,666
Hey. No guests allowed upstairs.

1881
01:39:05,746 --> 01:39:09,537
Then I guess that means
that you and I are all alone.

1882
01:39:09,617 --> 01:39:13,889
And you look like a bad boy.

1883
01:39:14,688 --> 01:39:16,757
How about we get into some trouble?

1884
01:39:20,761 --> 01:39:22,663
Too much champagne.

1885
01:39:25,632 --> 01:39:27,299
Miss?

1886
01:39:32,407 --> 01:39:34,295
Stephanie! Damn!

1887
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:35,677
Chen!

1888
01:39:36,678 --> 01:39:38,233
Hey, hey.

1889
01:39:38,313 --> 01:39:40,034
- Are you okay?
- She was going to kill me.

1890
01:39:40,114 --> 01:39:41,101
- It's okay.
- Shit.

1891
01:39:41,181 --> 01:39:42,551
What the fuck is going on?

1892
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:45,172
Shit.

1893
01:39:45,252 --> 01:39:46,654
Put your hands where I can see them.

1894
01:39:48,389 --> 01:39:50,177
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

1895
01:39:50,257 --> 01:39:51,246
- Summer!
- Oh, my God.

1896
01:39:51,326 --> 01:39:52,447
Did I kill him?

1897
01:39:52,527 --> 01:39:53,782
No, you just knocked his ass out.

1898
01:39:53,862 --> 01:39:55,149
Oh, thank God.

1899
01:39:55,229 --> 01:39:56,518
Here's the key. Here's the key.

1900
01:39:56,598 --> 01:39:58,519
All right, guys, Brody found the flakka.

1901
01:39:58,599 --> 01:40:01,256
- Oh!
- And let's get you out of here and call Ellerbee, okay?

1902
01:40:01,336 --> 01:40:02,590
- What about Leeds?
- Ronnie and I will stay here and

1903
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:03,657
keep an eye out for her, okay?

1904
01:40:03,737 --> 01:40:05,460
- What? We will?
- Yes.

1905
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:06,528
Okay, yeah, we will.

1906
01:40:06,608 --> 01:40:09,945
We're going to be on the villain's boat.

1907
01:40:10,812 --> 01:40:13,582
Whoo! Jason Bourne ain't got shit on me!

1908
01:40:16,251 --> 01:40:18,120
If I could please have your attention.

1909
01:40:19,687 --> 01:40:21,643
By this time tomorrow,

1910
01:40:21,723 --> 01:40:24,457
the expansion of the
Huntley will be official.

1911
01:40:26,161 --> 01:40:28,082
But for now, let's enjoy the caviar,

1912
01:40:28,162 --> 01:40:30,398
the champagne and the fireworks.

1913
01:40:30,532 --> 01:40:31,833
Cheers.

1914
01:40:32,834 --> 01:40:35,470
We have a problem.

1915
01:40:38,305 --> 01:40:39,875
Aw...

1916
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:43,444
Wrong time to grow a conscience, Brody.

1917
01:40:45,647 --> 01:40:46,768
Chen's getting away.

1918
01:40:46,848 --> 01:40:50,485
How is Chen getting away?

1919
01:40:51,452 --> 01:40:52,540
- Fucking idiots!
- Ow!

1920
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:54,509
They're trying to trap us. Plan B.

1921
01:40:54,589 --> 01:40:55,844
Get the chopper to meet us at the barge.

1922
01:40:55,924 --> 01:40:57,112
We need to get the fuck outta here.

1923
01:40:57,192 --> 01:40:58,527
What do we do about him?

1924
01:40:59,193 --> 01:41:00,181
Do what you were supposed to do with Chen.

1925
01:41:00,261 --> 01:41:01,616
<i>We got Chen off the boat.</i>

1926
01:41:01,696 --> 01:41:02,649
<i>Do you guys have eyes on Brody?</i>

1927
01:41:02,729 --> 01:41:04,184
No, we still haven't seen him...

1928
01:41:04,264 --> 01:41:06,153
- <i>What!</i>
- and we lost Leeds.

1929
01:41:06,233 --> 01:41:09,390
Wait! Good news. We found Leeds.

1930
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:10,692
Bad news.

1931
01:41:10,772 --> 01:41:12,793
She's got Brody in a cage
on the back of a boat.

1932
01:41:12,873 --> 01:41:15,196
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- Let's go. Come on.

1933
01:41:15,276 --> 01:41:17,746
Wakey-wakey, pretty
little dum-dum.

1934
01:41:18,212 --> 01:41:19,733
Such a shame.

1935
01:41:19,813 --> 01:41:22,750
Why'd you have to go snooping? Hmm?

1936
01:41:23,885 --> 01:41:26,922
Maybe Thorpe was wrong about you after all.

1937
01:41:28,355 --> 01:41:29,591
What?

1938
01:41:30,757 --> 01:41:32,881
Thorpe? What are you
talking about, "Thorpe"?

1939
01:41:32,961 --> 01:41:35,849
Oh, you haven't figured that part out yet.

1940
01:41:35,929 --> 01:41:38,752
Where I bribed him, you
know, got Mitch fired,

1941
01:41:38,832 --> 01:41:40,668
put your dumb ass in charge.

1942
01:41:41,336 --> 01:41:43,104
All you had to do was be a lifeguard.

1943
01:41:43,304 --> 01:41:44,626
Get a tan.

1944
01:41:44,706 --> 01:41:47,662
But instead, you tried to be
like Mitch and save the bay.

1945
01:41:47,742 --> 01:41:50,045
Now let's see how long
you can hold your breath.

1946
01:41:50,612 --> 01:41:52,433
No, just listen to me. Just listen...

1947
01:41:52,513 --> 01:41:54,568
God... Fuck!

1948
01:41:54,648 --> 01:41:56,304
No! You have to listen to me!

1949
01:41:56,384 --> 01:41:57,505
You're fucking crazy.

1950
01:41:57,585 --> 01:41:59,774
If I was a man, you'd call me "driven."

1951
01:41:59,854 --> 01:42:00,841
- No!
- Let's go, boys.

1952
01:42:00,921 --> 01:42:02,242
You have to listen to me!

1953
01:42:02,322 --> 01:42:03,891
Have a nice swim.

1954
01:43:33,747 --> 01:43:36,050
What the fuck?

1955
01:43:38,653 --> 01:43:40,322
Damn it, brah!

1956
01:43:40,587 --> 01:43:42,289
Fuck!

1957
01:43:56,504 --> 01:43:58,139
- Thank you.
- Where's Leeds?

1958
01:43:59,907 --> 01:44:04,012
Leeds is gonna escape in a
helicopter on that fireworks barge.

1959
01:44:04,379 --> 01:44:06,044
- Not if we stop her first.
- What?

1960
01:44:07,849 --> 01:44:09,784
Come on, buddy.

1961
01:44:10,151 --> 01:44:11,639
How?

1962
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:13,054
Watch and learn.

1963
01:44:13,688 --> 01:44:14,643
Ronnie, come in.

1964
01:44:14,723 --> 01:44:16,422
<i>Holy shit, Mitch, you got him!</i>

1965
01:44:17,759 --> 01:44:19,680
Yeah, listen, I got Brody.
He's alive and he's well.

1966
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,482
<i>Ronnie, I need you
to figure out a way</i>

1967
01:44:21,562 --> 01:44:22,916
to launch those fireworks.

1968
01:44:22,996 --> 01:44:24,418
Listen to me.

1969
01:44:24,498 --> 01:44:25,519
I want you to light up the sky.

1970
01:44:25,599 --> 01:44:27,335
- Okay. Got it, Mitch.
- Got it.

1971
01:44:29,403 --> 01:44:30,938
That's got to be her boat up there!

1972
01:44:32,672 --> 01:44:34,743
- There's the console.
- Go.

1973
01:44:34,942 --> 01:44:36,711
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

1974
01:44:41,748 --> 01:44:43,438
Oh, fucking lifeguards!

1975
01:44:43,518 --> 01:44:45,854
What a nuisance! Take care of them already!

1976
01:44:47,455 --> 01:44:49,690
- What the fuck? Holy shit!
- God damn it, get down!

1977
01:44:51,125 --> 01:44:52,814
<i>Miss Leeds, I'm
approaching the barge.</i>

1978
01:44:52,894 --> 01:44:54,349
<i>I'll meet you at the top.</i>

1979
01:44:54,429 --> 01:44:55,916
Okay. Okay, okay.

1980
01:44:55,996 --> 01:44:57,684
Holy shit.

1981
01:44:57,764 --> 01:44:58,819
She's gonna get away!

1982
01:44:58,899 --> 01:44:59,720
Shit, shit, shit!

1983
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,788
Ronnie, C.J., right now. Let's do this.

1984
01:45:01,868 --> 01:45:04,905
Um, yeah, yeah, Mitch. We're on it. Fuck!

1985
01:45:12,045 --> 01:45:13,634
I've never seen any interface like this.

1986
01:45:13,714 --> 01:45:15,068
I don't know what to fucking do!

1987
01:45:15,148 --> 01:45:16,671
Hey! Look at me, look at me, look at me!

1988
01:45:16,751 --> 01:45:18,219
You are the tech guy.

1989
01:45:18,986 --> 01:45:23,057
You are the motherfucking tech guy.

1990
01:45:28,528 --> 01:45:31,385
- I'm the motherfucking tech guy.
- Mmm-hmm.

1991
01:45:31,465 --> 01:45:32,800
<i>Come on, Ronnie.</i>

1992
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,721
All right, let's go.

1993
01:45:34,801 --> 01:45:36,304
I'm behind you, dude.

1994
01:45:37,205 --> 01:45:38,525
All right, watch your step.
There's urchins everywhere.

1995
01:45:38,605 --> 01:45:39,793
What, the ones that kill you?

1996
01:45:39,873 --> 01:45:41,309
Let's go, partner.

1997
01:45:41,675 --> 01:45:42,976
I like the sound of that.

1998
01:45:43,778 --> 01:45:45,180
Shit!

1999
01:45:45,545 --> 01:45:46,634
What the fuck!

2000
01:45:46,714 --> 01:45:48,502
Uh... God, oh...

2001
01:45:48,582 --> 01:45:50,385
Oh, my God, I got it!

2002
01:45:51,652 --> 01:45:53,855
- And I'm in.
- And... Fire!

2003
01:45:59,493 --> 01:46:00,795
Holy shit!

2004
01:46:03,163 --> 01:46:05,552
It's working, he's turning!

2005
01:46:05,632 --> 01:46:07,499
- It's go time.
- Right.

2006
01:46:09,269 --> 01:46:10,891
What the hell is taking you so long?

2007
01:46:10,971 --> 01:46:13,006
<i>All right, Miss Leeds.
Circling around.</i>

2008
01:46:14,809 --> 01:46:16,978
Could you put that dog down already?

2009
01:46:23,084 --> 01:46:24,519
Second level! Fire!

2010
01:46:24,652 --> 01:46:26,354
Take that, motherfucker!

2011
01:46:27,889 --> 01:46:29,490
Whoo!

2012
01:47:01,956 --> 01:47:03,258
Mitch!

2013
01:47:07,228 --> 01:47:09,951
The fireworks are almost
done. And then you can land.

2014
01:47:10,031 --> 01:47:11,332
Holy shit!

2015
01:47:12,567 --> 01:47:14,101
And come to this side, you imbecile!

2016
01:47:18,238 --> 01:47:19,226
Fire.

2017
01:47:19,306 --> 01:47:21,842
None of them are working
anymore. I think it's over.

2018
01:47:21,975 --> 01:47:25,412
Oh, honey. As usual, I have
to do everything myself.

2019
01:47:28,715 --> 01:47:31,552
- Mitch!
- Oh, don't bother. He's dead.

2020
01:47:31,751 --> 01:47:34,541
- Because of you.
- Of course because of me.

2021
01:47:34,621 --> 01:47:37,291
You do realize I'm holding a gun, right?

2022
01:47:39,859 --> 01:47:41,429
So impulsive.

2023
01:47:42,662 --> 01:47:44,618
That's why you walked right into my plan.

2024
01:47:44,698 --> 01:47:46,367
Leeds!

2025
01:47:46,733 --> 01:47:49,590
For fuck's sake. Why don't you die already?

2026
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:51,259
Let the little boy go.

2027
01:47:51,339 --> 01:47:53,528
That's not how this story ends, Mitch.

2028
01:47:53,608 --> 01:47:55,897
You see, you're not here to save him.

2029
01:47:55,977 --> 01:47:58,131
After all, he took your job.

2030
01:47:58,211 --> 01:47:59,166
So you shot him.

2031
01:47:59,246 --> 01:48:02,002
But not before he got a
shot off that killed you.

2032
01:48:02,082 --> 01:48:04,586
I don't know. That seems
a little complicated.

2033
01:48:04,684 --> 01:48:06,239
Yeah, that sounds cheesy.

2034
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:07,921
You won't get away with this!

2035
01:48:08,154 --> 01:48:10,123
Oh, I already have, Mitch.

2036
01:48:10,224 --> 01:48:12,026
You know the best thing about winning

2037
01:48:12,926 --> 01:48:15,582
is that you get to write
the story of what happened.

2038
01:48:15,662 --> 01:48:17,018
Isn't that right, Mr. Gold Medal?

2039
01:48:17,098 --> 01:48:19,333
- Fuck you, lady.
- Pass.

2040
01:48:21,167 --> 01:48:22,470
What's that?

2041
01:48:22,737 --> 01:48:24,137
What the hell?

2042
01:48:24,738 --> 01:48:26,474
It's a big red button.

2043
01:48:29,175 --> 01:48:30,545
The big red button.

2044
01:48:38,184 --> 01:48:39,621
Time to die, boys.

2045
01:48:40,054 --> 01:48:41,675
No!

2046
01:48:41,755 --> 01:48:44,110
I was born of the sea!

2047
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:47,047
I eat fire coral and I piss saltwater!

2048
01:48:47,127 --> 01:48:50,898
I scratch my back with a whale's dick,

2049
01:48:51,297 --> 01:48:53,921
and I loofah my chest with his ball sac.

2050
01:48:54,001 --> 01:48:55,066
What the fuck?

2051
01:48:56,437 --> 01:49:00,507
I'll die when the tide
stops and the moon drowns!

2052
01:49:00,808 --> 01:49:02,342
Until then...

2053
01:49:08,114 --> 01:49:09,269
Oh.

2054
01:49:09,349 --> 01:49:10,652
Go, baby.

2055
01:49:11,852 --> 01:49:14,007
I'm oceanic, motherfucker.

2056
01:49:14,087 --> 01:49:15,422
How tacky.

2057
01:49:32,806 --> 01:49:34,761
- Mitch, you just blew her up!
- Yeah.

2058
01:49:34,841 --> 01:49:37,797
Plus I'm high as a motherfucker right now

2059
01:49:37,877 --> 01:49:39,180
on Devil's Urchin.

2060
01:49:42,782 --> 01:49:44,171
You stabbed yourself with one of those?

2061
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:45,706
I thought that was supposed to kill you.

2062
01:49:45,786 --> 01:49:47,675
It does.

2063
01:49:47,755 --> 01:49:50,121
And I'm in desperate
need of medical attention.

2064
01:49:54,862 --> 01:49:56,530
That wasn't so bad.

2065
01:49:59,332 --> 01:50:00,988
That's good luck. Pick it up.

2066
01:50:01,068 --> 01:50:03,371
- What? What?
- Oh, God, there's so much blood.

2067
01:50:03,903 --> 01:50:06,237
- What?
- God, why do I keep looking?

2068
01:50:10,411 --> 01:50:11,998
What took you so long with Leeds?

2069
01:50:12,078 --> 01:50:15,048
I didn't want to make it
seem like it was too easy.

2070
01:50:15,483 --> 01:50:17,218
The adrenaline kept you alive.

2071
01:50:17,785 --> 01:50:19,386
Thank God you make us carry these.

2072
01:50:20,121 --> 01:50:21,422
Take it easy.

2073
01:50:22,022 --> 01:50:23,423
You saved your own life this time.

2074
01:50:25,392 --> 01:50:27,228
- Thank you.
- Yes.

2075
01:50:28,429 --> 01:50:30,064
Hey, um...

2076
01:50:30,831 --> 01:50:32,720
So I hear you were, uh...

2077
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,471
You were right the whole time. And, uh...

2078
01:50:39,038 --> 01:50:42,476
I owe you an apology.

2079
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:45,212
Owe you an apology.

2080
01:50:51,417 --> 01:50:52,753
No apology needed.

2081
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:55,722
I mean, we saved the bay.

2082
01:50:57,457 --> 01:50:59,924
So you can hit us on
that shell phone anytime.

2083
01:51:01,961 --> 01:51:03,296
Come on, brother.

2084
01:51:04,465 --> 01:51:06,768
- My man.
- My man.

2085
01:51:06,934 --> 01:51:08,022
Hey!

2086
01:51:08,102 --> 01:51:10,637
What part of "You're fired"
do you not understand, Mitch?

2087
01:51:10,804 --> 01:51:14,074
Get the fuck off my beach
or I'll have you arrested.

2088
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:15,777
Hey, Thorpe.

2089
01:51:17,812 --> 01:51:19,065
Oh!

2090
01:51:19,145 --> 01:51:20,448
Oh, my God.

2091
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:24,872
This is our beach, bitch.
And you're under arrest.

2092
01:51:24,952 --> 01:51:26,086
Ow.

2093
01:51:28,288 --> 01:51:30,323
That was a badass right cross, Brody.

2094
01:51:32,859 --> 01:51:34,226
You just said my real name.

2095
01:51:49,276 --> 01:51:50,744
Hey, killer.

2096
01:51:52,446 --> 01:51:54,282
Hey.

2097
01:51:54,849 --> 01:51:56,784
- Morning.
- Good morning.

2098
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:58,339
Do you want breakfast?

2099
01:51:58,419 --> 01:52:00,421
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.

2100
01:52:00,955 --> 01:52:02,242
- Pancakes?
- Yeah.

2101
01:52:02,322 --> 01:52:04,192
- Bacon?
- Yeah.

2102
01:52:06,227 --> 01:52:07,528
Cinnabon?

2103
01:52:12,899 --> 01:52:14,555
- I saw you do that.
- Oh, you're still there.

2104
01:52:14,635 --> 01:52:17,438
Yup, just the... Bacon sounds good too.

2105
01:52:22,542 --> 01:52:24,211
Good morning.

2106
01:52:24,545 --> 01:52:26,800
That was a hell of a punch, mister.

2107
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,501
- Thank you.
- I mean,

2108
01:52:28,581 --> 01:52:30,537
it's not exactly in the
lifeguard manual, but...

2109
01:52:30,617 --> 01:52:34,822
Well, I told you I would learn
better if I had a study buddy.

2110
01:52:37,358 --> 01:52:39,193
Don't get ahead of yourself.

2111
01:52:39,593 --> 01:52:41,128
Oh, my God. Did you just...

2112
01:52:41,929 --> 01:52:43,231
Look at my dick?

2113
01:52:43,397 --> 01:52:45,333
Now we're even.

2114
01:52:56,376 --> 01:52:57,864
Oh, my God.

2115
01:52:57,944 --> 01:53:00,347
We're late. We have to go. Come on.

2116
01:53:02,081 --> 01:53:03,650
I found something.

2117
01:53:08,656 --> 01:53:10,376
- How'd you get this?
- Well, it washed up on shore.

2118
01:53:10,456 --> 01:53:12,159
You only threw it eight feet, dude.

2119
01:53:17,331 --> 01:53:18,952
Thank you.

2120
01:53:19,032 --> 01:53:20,587
You're welcome. You're very welcome.

2121
01:53:20,667 --> 01:53:23,524
Uh, guys, after finding the drugs,

2122
01:53:23,604 --> 01:53:24,759
helping save Chen

2123
01:53:24,839 --> 01:53:27,909
and helping me blow up the
bad girl with a Roman candle,

2124
01:53:28,207 --> 01:53:31,899
it's a pleasure to say you are
officially no longer trainees.

2125
01:53:31,979 --> 01:53:33,648
Whoo!

2126
01:53:34,014 --> 01:53:35,068
Congratulations.

2127
01:53:35,148 --> 01:53:36,069
Yeah, guys.

2128
01:53:36,149 --> 01:53:37,971
Hey, guys, one more important thing.

2129
01:53:38,051 --> 01:53:40,006
I want to introduce you to our new captain

2130
01:53:40,086 --> 01:53:41,541
who has been running our Hawaii division

2131
01:53:41,621 --> 01:53:43,409
very successfully for years now.

2132
01:53:43,489 --> 01:53:45,926
The amazing Captain Casey Jean.

2133
01:54:02,108 --> 01:54:03,564
Is it just me, or is she in...

2134
01:54:03,644 --> 01:54:06,280
- In super-slow motion?
- Yeah.

2135
01:54:08,448 --> 01:54:10,617
Wow. This is gonna take a while.

2136
01:54:11,184 --> 01:54:12,652
That's how we roll.

2137
01:54:31,738 --> 01:54:33,640
Oh, fuck!

2138
01:54:51,558 --> 01:54:54,295
- All right, here we go.
- I think we should roll with it. Let's do it.

2139
01:54:55,496 --> 01:54:57,965
Yeah, we saw it in the
coroner's... Coroner's...

2140
01:54:58,064 --> 01:54:59,720
Yeah, we saw it in the corn...

2141
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:01,220
Coroner's. We saw it
in the coroner's report.

2142
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:02,221
It was in the coroner's report.

2143
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:04,058
I'm gonna get it. "In
the coroner's report."

2144
01:55:04,138 --> 01:55:05,536
Yes, we saw it in the coronary's report.

2145
01:55:07,674 --> 01:55:09,296
- Ronnie.
- What?

2146
01:55:09,376 --> 01:55:11,912
Stop looking at the donuts
like that and dump them.

2147
01:55:23,456 --> 01:55:25,058
Oh, boy, that was fun.

2148
01:55:26,059 --> 01:55:29,183
You're like a dolphin on
cocaine, but not annoying at all.

2149
01:55:29,263 --> 01:55:32,552
You're like if a human fucked a jet ski...

2150
01:55:32,632 --> 01:55:34,654
Which is impossible, but it'd be so cool.

2151
01:55:34,734 --> 01:55:36,037
What?

2152
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:37,636
Okay, I got this.

2153
01:55:39,672 --> 01:55:41,595
- Come on, dude. Hurry up.
- Fuck, how'd you do that?

2154
01:55:41,675 --> 01:55:43,311
Because I'm fucking strong. Let's go.

2155
01:55:43,477 --> 01:55:44,364
What do your balls say?

2156
01:55:44,444 --> 01:55:46,065
"Don't follow Mitch's balls.

2157
01:55:46,145 --> 01:55:47,212
"Mitch's balls be stupid."

2158
01:55:49,216 --> 01:55:50,636
Your hidden balls want to go to the cartel?

2159
01:55:50,716 --> 01:55:52,439
- Right now.
- It's just a third testicle.

2160
01:55:52,519 --> 01:55:54,088
My balls are talking...

2161
01:55:55,288 --> 01:55:56,210
Ugh.

2162
01:55:56,290 --> 01:55:58,222
I need you to check his
taint for needle marks.

2163
01:56:00,794 --> 01:56:02,049
God damn it.

2164
01:56:02,129 --> 01:56:04,417
It's, uh... And hairy.

2165
01:56:04,497 --> 01:56:06,487
God, it's getting really fro-y in here.

2166
01:56:06,567 --> 01:56:08,069
Smile.

2167
01:56:14,808 --> 01:56:17,497
- Love your chest, it is so...
- Uh-huh.

2168
01:56:17,577 --> 01:56:19,299
Uh-huh.

2169
01:56:19,379 --> 01:56:22,435
I like your chest as well.

2170
01:56:22,515 --> 01:56:24,615
It doesn't work when you
say it back to me like that.

2171
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:30,210
Hey, C.J., why do our suits
ride so far up our asses?

2172
01:56:30,290 --> 01:56:32,126
It makes us faster in the water.

2173
01:56:50,144 --> 01:56:51,732
Did you just... Whoa. Please.

2174
01:56:51,812 --> 01:56:53,599
I hope that doesn't make the boob-lers...

2175
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:55,081
All right.

2176
01:56:55,748 --> 01:56:57,571
I'd love it if you wore tighter pants.

2177
01:56:57,651 --> 01:56:58,953
I really would.

2178
01:57:01,154 --> 01:57:03,157
Why do you get to play Mitch Buchannon?

2179
01:57:04,724 --> 01:57:05,712
You're joking.

2180
01:57:05,792 --> 01:57:08,114
No, I've been Mitch Buchannon for 20 years.

2181
01:57:08,194 --> 01:57:09,582
Am I gonna be in the sequel?

2182
01:57:09,662 --> 01:57:11,131
I think you should be in the sequel.

2183
01:57:12,899 --> 01:57:15,189
Do I look like a tiny
little asshole next to him?

2184
01:57:15,269 --> 01:57:16,492
- No.
- Okay, good.

2185
01:57:16,572 --> 01:57:28,572
