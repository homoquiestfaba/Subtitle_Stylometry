00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,095
Alive.

5
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,922
We take him alive.

00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:21,505
Sit your ass down!

[distant gunfire]

10
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,002
Shit!

11
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,264
Speedy, you got Billy.

12
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:42,352
Two minutes to rendezvous.

13
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:43,223
I'm on it.

14
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,582
[dog barking]

15
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:03,547
Morales, what's your 20?

16
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,548
We're at the back wall.

17
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:05,462
It's a dead end.

18
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:06,681
No exit.

19
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:07,595
Blow it.

20
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:08,422
You got it, boss.

21
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:12,774
Boomer.

22
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:13,688
Boomer, do you read?

23
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,211
Loud and clear, Cutter.

24
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,168
Give us 3.

25
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,039
We have the Tango.

26
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,301
Need medical.

27
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:19,302
On its way.

28
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:20,216
Gotcha.

29
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,130
You cover me.

30
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:22,218
I'll carry this puke.

[groaning]

35
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,822
That son of a bitch.

36
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,607
He killed himself.

37
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,392
That's gonna cost a
lot of American lives.

38
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:12,877
Captain, you're hit!

39
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,516
Archibald?

40
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,256
Ah.

41
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,041
Albert?

42
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,390
Albert.

43
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:50,132
Al.

44
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,655
No.

45
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:52,874
Austin?

46
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,398
What, are we living
in Texas now?

47
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:56,921
Anson?

48
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,097
Honey, I got a CU at
Bragg named Anson.

49
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,578
That it's just a
bad, bad association.

50
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:02,753
But why couldn't he be a girl?

51
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,407
I know lots of good girl names.

52
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,322
Oh, I'm sure you do.

53
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,499
We could get out that
little black book of yours.

54
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:11,458
Well, um, that was electronic.

55
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,895
You erased them all the
night that I proposed.

56
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:14,939
Come on.

57
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,114
You know I'm happy he's a he.

58
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,725
The kid's gonna
be a quarterback.

59
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,770
Support me in my old age
with his NFL contract.

60
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,122
God, I miss you.

61
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,733
I worry about you.

62
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:28,997
Well, look, I'm gonna be
there in less than 48 hours.

63
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,346
You still got two weeks.

64
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,566
Nothing to worry about here.

65
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:35,525
What about Brett, Jr?

66
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,658
You remember the bad old days?

67
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,747
Gone for weeks
and no cell phone.

68
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,139
I know.

69
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:44,404
And I know your job is
important right now.

70
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,709
I'm proud of you.

71
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,232
I love you.

[honking]

73
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:50,453
Hey, kids, the van's here.

74
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:51,367
Listen, baby.

75
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,629
I gotta go.

76
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:53,891
I love you, too.

77
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:54,762
Kisses to both of you.

78
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:02,857
What the hell ever happened
to Tom, Dick, and Harry?

79
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,901
Like guy names.

80
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,081
She's a lucky woman.

81
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,822
He's a great husband.

82
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,869
Hey, you know, I hear when the
baby comes, the sex life goes,

83
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,740
so maybe then I'll
have a chance?

84
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,699
You are so bad.

85
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,701
Hey, that's why I'm in
the service industry, honey.

86
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:40,068
ANNOUNCER [ON LOUDSPEAKER]:
[non-english speech]

87
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,509
WOMAN: No, we live
in Atlanta now.

88
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:49,469
My husband works for the
Center for Disease Control.

89
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,906
We left our two
children at home.

90
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:53,385
My husband was
trying to call them.

91
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:54,474
I hope the house
is still standing.

92
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,052
No, no.

93
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,880
No climbing, really,
just trekking.

94
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,013
Oh, you must be
in great shape, Dad.

95
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,536
You know, I tell
you what, I could sure

96
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,538
use a decent cheeseburger
right about now.

97
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,366
Oh, me too.

98
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,281
It's so cool we're gonna be
on the same flight, though.

99
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:20,630
Yeah.

100
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,110
I'll come back and
visit you in economy.

101
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,241
It's where all the fun is.

102
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:30,161
[beeping]

103
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,511
Ugh, Jesus.

104
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:38,126
Hey, get your hands
off of me, you creep.

105
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,562
You should be grateful.

106
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:40,520
Please excuse her.

107
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,565
Get your bag.

108
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:43,348
Jeez.

109
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:19,515
Hey.

110
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,603
Hey, we're already boarding.
You better hurry.

111
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:21,430
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

112
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:22,257
OK.

113
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,019
[keys dropping]
- I got it.

114
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:46,629
I got it.
- Merci.

115
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:47,543
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,500
Don't worry about it.

117
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:49,414
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,720
Are you an American?

119
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,243
Well, actually, I
will be in two months.

120
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:53,636
Oh.

121
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,639
I am going to New York
for the first time.

122
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,946
Do you know how long
do we have to switch

123
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,817
our flights in Frankfurt?

124
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:02,340
I think it's about an hour.

125
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,559
But we're holding up the line.
Could you please--

126
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,039
Oh.
Yeah.

127
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:09,478
[music playing]

128
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:10,452
OFFICER: Here you go.

129
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:11,235
Thank you.

130
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,780
No one's flagged this
time, either by your people

131
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:36,086
or Interpol, nor us.

132
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,392
Good.

133
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:38,959
Should be a safe flight.

134
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:39,742
Yeah.

135
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,227
Too bad there's no
movie on this one.

136
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:07,814
We got a 20-minute gate hold.

137
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,598
Wheels up at 52.

138
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:12,514
One gun on board-- your
friend Prescott, gorgeous.

139
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,211
Mhm.

140
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,300
So what about that lay you
were promising me in Frankfurt?

141
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:17,345
I mean layover.

142
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:19,434
Dream on.

143
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:20,304
Hey, hey!

144
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:21,262
That's harassment.

145
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,132
Yeah?

146
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,743
Sue me.

147
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,788
Next time, how about bringing
us some hot coffee, huh?

148
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:29,487
You know, I would, but
I only have a first class.

149
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,271
Ouch.

150
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:47,941
Welcome aboard,
Senator Chambers.

151
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:48,811
Hello.

152
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:49,812
Right there.

153
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:50,682
Thank you.

154
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:17,797
MARIE: Good afternoon.

155
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,320
Welcome to Transair.

156
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:22,192
You'll find your seat
straight back to your right.

157
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:42,691
[chatter]

158
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,736
MARIE: Hi, welcome aboard.

159
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,434
Good afternoon.

160
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,349
Senator Chambers is in 1A.

161
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,363
What about Jake?

162
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:03,755
I like that name.

163
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,467
Hi, Fred.

164
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,772
Isn't this Ricky?

165
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:21,556
Yeah.

166
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:27,605
Have a good trip, son.

167
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,216
OK.

168
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:32,480
Did you fix it so I could
go up to the cabinet, Dad?

169
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:34,177
Fly it?

170
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:37,877
I'm afraid you can't do that
with the new security rules.

171
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,790
Give me a hug.

172
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,760
Marie here will take
good care of you.

173
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:52,717
Yeah.

174
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,980
Let's go find your seat.

175
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:54,850
RICKY: OK.

176
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,515
If you're going to enjoy
the privileges of being

177
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:10,039
a senator's daughter--
and God knows you do--

178
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,912
you're going to have to
accept the responsibilities.

179
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,349
That was inexcusable.

180
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:17,655
I played my part this trip.

181
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,048
So boring.

182
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:21,398
Retards, politics-- boring.

183
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,969
I didn't even want to come.

184
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:29,319
Better than rehab
again, young lady.

185
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,412
Right here, Ricky.

186
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:36,239
Thanks.

187
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:48,251
- You OK, Ricky?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

188
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:51,472
Sir, I wonder if you could
keep an eye on this young man?

189
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:52,603
He's traveling alone today.

190
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:53,953
Ah.

191
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,868
Well, so am I. He looks
like he could take

192
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,827
pretty good care of
himself, but it's

193
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,090
always nice to have company.

194
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,483
I'm Brett.

195
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:03,527
I'm Rick.

196
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,312
Richard Bernard Parsons.
- Hey.

197
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:06,617
I'm Luke.

198
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:07,575
Hey.

199
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,489
Nice to meet you, man.

200
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,931
This looks like a good seat.

201
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,719
You know this is first class?

202
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:22,764
Yeah, I know.

203
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,113
Do you?

204
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:25,636
May I see your
boarding pass, sir?

205
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,993
3A, that's right.

206
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:34,819
Thank you.

207
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,826
I bought an around-the-world
first-class ticket

208
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,915
before my company went bust.

209
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,047
Your company?

210
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,788
Yeah.

211
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,616
Dot com?

212
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:49,834
Yeah, afraid so.

213
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:50,792
Software.

214
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:51,967
Oh, man.

215
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,664
That sucks.

216
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,578
It did.

217
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:55,797
It did.

218
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,451
Yeah, but you still
got that ticket.

219
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,366
And you're here,
so that's all good.

220
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,806
Hey, where you from?

221
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,286
I'm from the city--
New York.

222
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,504
All right.

223
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,158
I'm from New
Hampshire myself, man.

224
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,986
Well, actually, I'm
originally from here,

225
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,335
but now I live in New Hampshire.

226
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,991
You know, like,
live free or die.

227
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,253
Well, this time, to
tell you the truth,

228
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:18,733
a man could freeze and die.

229
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,082
BRETT: Have you seen
the world, Luke?

230
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:21,692
Nah.

231
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,085
To tell you the truth, man,
I've seen enough for now.

232
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:25,000
Can't wait to get back home.

233
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,914
BRETT: I hear you.

234
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:26,741
Yeah.

235
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:58,468
GROUND CONTROL [ON RADIO]:
Transair, you are cleared

236
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:01,776
for takeoff from the one--

237
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:05,127
cleared takeoff from the one--

238
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:07,477
- Did you get any of that?
- I heard "Transair."

239
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,088
It's good enough for me.

240
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,438
Where would we be if
English wasn't the language

241
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,570
of air traffic control?

242
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:15,137
You know, in the old
days, before these things

243
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:18,749
flew themselves--

244
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:21,970
well, anyway, I'm just
glad to be retiring soon.

245
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,624
There won't be any
human pilots by the time

246
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,670
you get to be my age.

247
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:28,411
Flight attendants, please
prepare for takeoff.

248
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,118
MARIE [ON LOUDSPEAKER]:
Ladies and gentlemen,

249
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,163
please make sure your
seatbelts are fastened,

250
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,687
that your seats are in
their upright positions,

251
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,211
and that your tray
tables in front of you

252
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:46,821
are locked in place.

253
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:48,779
At this point, we
would ask that you

254
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:52,261
turn off all electronic devices
for the duration of the flight.

255
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,088
Thank you.

256
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,578
[grunting]

257
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:11,062
[music playing]

258
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,092
Nervous?

259
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:41,919
No.

260
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,489
A little bit, maybe.

261
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,235
They say flying is far
safer than driving your car.

262
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,629
I've had a few car
accidents before,

263
00:19:55,672 --> 00:20:07,554
but I didn't drove
30,000 feet out the sky.

264
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:11,558
I think those moments when you
know your plane is gonna crash

265
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:14,169
must be the most
terrible imaginable.

266
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,780
You know, when you see
a wing fall off or an--

267
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:19,392
an engine catch fire.

268
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,915
I suppose it's
the same in a car,

269
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,917
you know, the moment
before a head-on collision.

270
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,701
Pow!

271
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,529
Sorry.

272
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:31,665
So yeah, those moments certainly
are moments to test your faith.

273
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:38,106
Are you a believer, madam?

274
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:41,152
Well, all your talk is
sure making me one to pray,

275
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:41,979
I'll tell you that.

276
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:58,996
Hey, what you
reading there, Rick?

277
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,566
Those are the days.

278
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,873
This big sea planes took
days across the Pacific.

279
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,440
My dad got me the book.

280
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,832
He's a company manager here.

281
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,181
Ah.

282
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,835
It must be really
interesting living here.

283
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,141
I don't live here.

284
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,577
I live with my mom in New York.

285
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:15,535
Oh, New York, huh?

286
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:16,449
Great city.

287
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,754
I live there, too.

288
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,843
My mom's going to
have a baby very soon.

289
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,236
Oh yeah?

290
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,411
So you're gonna have
yourself a little, uh--

291
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:23,760
She's married to Dick.

292
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:27,808
He was my father's best friend.

293
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,114
Oh.

294
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:32,116
What about Sebastian?

295
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,075
It has a dignity to it.

296
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,556
Hey Luke, how many
NFL quarterbacks

297
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,602
do you know named Sebastian?

298
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:40,734
Exactly.

299
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,518
Sounds like an accountant.

300
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:43,432
Maybe he will be.

301
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:44,477
Don't tease me.

302
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,870
He could be tiny.

303
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:47,784
Headset?

304
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:49,308
BRETT: Thanks.

305
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,526
Ricky.

306
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,788
Thanks.

307
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:52,659
Headset?

308
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:54,574
Thank you.

309
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:57,011
Is it OK if I move
to the window seat?

310
00:21:57,054 --> 00:21:58,491
Sure.

311
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,014
Let me give you a hand.

312
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:02,016
OK.

313
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,018
All right.

314
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:05,019
Here you go.

315
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:05,933
Thank you.

316
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,463
Headset?

317
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:15,334
Thank you.

318
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:13,304
I'm sorry.

319
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,096
Hey, man, I know ethnic
profiling isn't politically

320
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,534
correct if we're all part
of the cosmos and all that,

321
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:29,582
but that guy over
there, he scares me.

322
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,148
Yeah.

323
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:34,804
Well, security seemed
pretty good at the airport.

324
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:35,718
Yeah, right.

325
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:52,953
So you did Nepal, too?

326
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:57,131
I hear they grow
great weed up there.

327
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:58,132
That's what I hear.

328
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:59,046
Come on, dude.

329
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,830
I am not a narc.

330
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,005
No, not at all.

331
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,398
You want to know
something cool?

332
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,535
What, am I boring you?

333
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:11,319
No, no.

334
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:14,714
Um, can you excuse
me just one second?

335
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:17,238
Yeah, if you
promise to come back.

336
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:19,936
We can, um, check out
the mile high club.

337
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,904
What?

338
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:51,767
MARIE [ON INTERCOM]: Ladies
and gentlemen, the captain has

339
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:53,421
turned on the seatbelt sign.

340
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,423
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

341
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:56,685
I'm sorry, sir.

342
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,078
The seatbelt sign
just came on, if you

343
00:25:58,121 --> 00:26:00,254
wouldn't mind taking your seat.

344
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:03,866
Do as I tell you, and
you will live a long life.

345
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,216
No tricks.
I know them all.

346
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,130
OK.

347
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:07,957
Move.

348
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,184
Slut.

349
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:18,446
[knocking]

350
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:19,969
HEATHER: I brought coffee.

351
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:20,840
I told you she'd come back.

352
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:28,717
Who is it?

353
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:30,240
Heather.

354
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,502
Not the same Heather who
swore she'd only deliver

355
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,635
coffee over her dead body?

356
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,594
Yes, the very same.

357
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:38,118
Well, I'm not sure
we want coffee now.

358
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,816
Maybe if you were offering
something a little more--

359
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,774
I'm sorry!

360
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:42,731
I'm sorry!

361
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:43,950
Sit down!

362
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,255
Strap yourself back in.

363
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,003
No more tricks, Captain.

364
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,657
You ought to follow my
instructions exactly

365
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:58,051
or I will kill her and you.

366
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,487
Who will fly the plane?

367
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,752
I will, though I'm sure
this idiot can manage.

368
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:06,015
Turn off the transponder.

369
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:06,799
Do it!

370
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,937
They'll be suspicious
when we don't check in.

371
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:16,286
Don't fool with me.

372
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,854
We are well beyond
air traffic control.

373
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:22,379
Assume a heading of 24 degrees
south until further notice.

374
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:23,206
Do it!

375
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,819
That's crazy.

376
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:29,299
We'll fly right
into a thunderstorm.

377
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,258
We'll be on the edge
of it, no problem.

378
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,781
Forget trying to
fool me, Captain.

379
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,092
[whimpering]

380
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:47,013
Now, where's your gun?

381
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,057
We don't have one.

382
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,624
Hey, the FAA hasn't approved it.

383
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,581
Don't believe everything
you read in the newspapers.

384
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,495
It's true!
It's true!

385
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,236
It's true.
It's true.

386
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,238
The bullet proof door's the only
thing they put in since 9/11.

387
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:09,688
[screaming]

388
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,405
That's one dead.

389
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:32,885
There'll be two
if you ever think

390
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:34,103
of doing that stunt again.

391
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:51,860
Oh my God.

392
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:52,774
OK.

393
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:56,430
That was kind of cool.

394
00:28:56,473 --> 00:28:58,737
Now you are going to
make an announcement.

395
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:03,393
CAPTAIN [ON INTERCOM]: Ladies
and gentlemen, we encountered

396
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,395
a bit of rough air back there.

397
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,006
We will be encountering
more turbulence,

398
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,965
so please stay firmly
bundled up in your seats.

399
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:11,662
We should be
landing in Frankfurt

400
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:13,621
in plenty of time for you to
make any connecting flights.

401
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,057
Thank you.

402
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:17,146
How was that?

403
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,931
We'll soon find out.

404
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:20,671
Uh, you guys?

405
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:24,675
That was no air pocket.

406
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,547
Oh my God, you killed him.

407
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,244
Shut-- [ON INTERCOM] shut up.

408
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:29,506
Shut up.
Shut up!

409
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,943
Everybody stay in their seat.

410
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:31,857
[yelling]

411
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,555
Shut the fuck up!

412
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:35,556
Let me see your kid.

413
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,644
Come on.

414
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:37,993
- Mommy!
- Shut the fuck up!

415
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:38,907
Sit down!

416
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:51,311
So we are going to have
long flight, so sit!

417
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:53,095
Oh my God, they're
going to crash us!

418
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,183
No.

419
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,445
No crash.

420
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:56,403
No crash.

421
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:58,318
We need hostage.

422
00:29:58,361 --> 00:29:59,232
Right?

423
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:00,581
Right.

424
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:01,712
That's what they said
in New York, man.

425
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:03,410
Keep everybody quiet.

426
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:06,282
I'm not sticking around for--

427
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:07,631
Be smart, not dead.

428
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:11,766
Just fly.

429
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:16,684
Don't anybody move.

430
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,256
Man, will that work here?

431
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:24,387
Ought to.

432
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:25,214
Langley's best.

433
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:30,611
FAA AGENT [ON PHONE]:
Security line.

434
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:32,831
This is Air Marshal
Brett Prescott.

435
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,397
I am on Transair 382--
FAA AGENT [ON PHONE]: Yes, sir.

436
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:35,703
I'll transfer you immediately.

437
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:37,357
No, this is an emergency.
Don't put--

438
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,880
FAA RECORDING [ON PHONE]:
You've reached the FAA Hotline.

439
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,447
Listen carefully, as our
menu options have changed--

440
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,709
Come on.

441
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:42,144
FAA RECORDING [ON
PHONE]: Press 1--

442
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,850
So you do have a gun.

443
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,329
It's a Taser.

444
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:54,591
It's a stun gun.

445
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:55,505
It's not a real gun.

446
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,116
It can't kill anybody.

447
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,471
[phone dialing]

448
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:12,435
Oh!

449
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:14,873
No!

450
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,875
Oh my God, you shot him!

451
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,181
[panicked crying]

452
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:25,187
All right, I want
all cell phones.

453
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,536
Now!

454
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,278
You give cell
phone, you're dead.

455
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:30,105
Mohammed.

456
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:49,081
I hate to do this.

457
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:51,431
[beeping]

458
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:56,218
[ringing]

459
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,614
We've taken over the plane.

460
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:01,832
Abdul killed one.

461
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:02,616
What?

462
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:06,707
Watch him.

463
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,752
Do not let anyone in but me.

464
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:10,624
You-- you are coming with me.

465
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,582
Drag his body out.

466
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:13,714
Do it.

467
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:14,497
Do it!

468
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,245
Make sure you lock this.

469
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:40,784
BRETT [ON ANSWERING
MACHINE]: Hi.

470
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,482
You've reached Brett and Tracy.

471
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:44,527
We can't come to the phone right
now, so leave us a message,

472
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:45,876
and have a great day.

473
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,098
Take it easy, partner.

474
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:53,536
These things cause cancer.

475
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,494
And I don't have one.

476
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:17,212
No!

477
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:21,956
You think we're playing
by the old rules--

478
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,349
Western rules.

479
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:25,177
Human life on this
earth is sacred.

480
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,874
No?

481
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:29,877
But for Mohammed to die a
martyr is the most holy of acts.

482
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,228
For you to die an infidel
is our sacred duty.

483
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:36,405
Do it.

484
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,505
Brett!

485
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:52,508
Jesus Christ, you killed him!

486
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:55,685
There is a bomb in
the baggage compartment!

487
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,601
This will detonate it.

488
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:00,777
Give up any idea of
resisting us and believe me,

489
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,431
we are all willing to die.

490
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,129
Oh yeah?

491
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:06,609
That's what they said in New
York to control the passengers.

492
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:07,523
There was no bomb.

493
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:08,872
Shut the fuck up!

494
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:09,873
OK.

495
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:10,657
OK.

496
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,364
Where the hell were you?

497
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,975
You could have stopped
him and saved Mohammed.

498
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:28,066
But it was so much
better than a movie.

499
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,720
I was on the edge of my
seat with my friend Lauren

500
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:34,985
here, wondering
what would happen.

501
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:37,031
JAMAL: Mohammed was my man.

502
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,468
And now he is with
70 virgins in paradise.

503
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,296
Not my idea of a good time.

504
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,732
What if they're ugly?

505
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:44,473
You blaspheme.

506
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:46,736
And you messed up, brother.

507
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,130
We didn't need this if
you'd handled the pilot.

508
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,914
I told you my men and I
should have handled it.

509
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:57,399
Our air marshal.

510
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:03,492
Ah, a woman.

511
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,494
Pretty woman.

512
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:06,365
What's this?

513
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:14,242
Perfect symbol.

514
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:15,548
The end of an empire.

515
00:35:58,852 --> 00:35:59,853
All right!

516
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:00,810
Everybody get up!

517
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:02,029
Move to the back!
- OK.

518
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:02,856
OK!
- Do it!

519
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:03,857
Let's go!
Move!

520
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,814
Move!

521
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:06,251
Do it now!

522
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:09,645
Let's go!

523
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:10,646
Move it!

524
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,779
Let's go!

525
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:13,693
Move!
- All right!

526
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:14,607
Sorry.

527
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,086
You, get out!

528
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,392
You, move!

529
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:18,393
Back to the plane!

530
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:19,438
Come on, come on, come on.

531
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:20,526
JAMAL: You sit right here now.

532
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:21,831
Come here, Senator.

533
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:22,702
Get out over here.

534
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:23,746
Get out.
- Ow!

535
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,660
Nobody move!

536
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,576
God.

537
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,231
OK, miss, you can sit down.

538
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,667
You can have my seat.

539
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,023
Sit down!

540
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:42,591
Next to him?

541
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:44,202
Yeah, why not?

542
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,072
Why not.

543
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:56,692
Jesus!

544
00:36:56,736 --> 00:36:57,606
Sit down.

545
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,433
Ow!

Go to the cockpit.

got it under control.

So what about me?

557
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:28,322
You'll take Mohammed's.

558
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,281
Where is it?

559
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:32,282
Just go.

560
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,066
Go.

561
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,553
Sit down.

562
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,037
[knocking]

563
00:39:55,567 --> 00:40:00,528
So is all OK, brother?

564
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:01,442
Yeah, fine.

565
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:19,895
Come here.

566
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:07,769
Have they made demands?

567
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:08,640
No.

568
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:09,815
We've got no contact.

569
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:11,512
How do we know
it's a hijacking?

570
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:12,818
Housewife in New York.

571
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:14,689
We're spending 30
billion on intelligence

572
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:17,431
and you're telling me that--
that-- that some housewife is--

573
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,825
She's the wife
of the air marshal.

574
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:21,348
We have an update.

575
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:22,392
JAMAL [ON RECORDING]: For
Mohammed to die a martyr

576
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:23,655
is the most holy of acts.

577
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:25,178
Jesus.

578
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:26,745
JAMAL [ON RECORDING]:
For you to die an infidel

579
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:29,182
is our sacred duty.

580
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:31,097
[gunshots]

581
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,491
[woman crying]

582
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:36,232
MARIE [ON RECORDING]: Brett!

583
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,931
MAN [ON RECORDING]: Jesus
Christ, you killed him!

584
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:41,368
The wife heard that?

585
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:43,675
Heard her husband get killed?

586
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:46,808
Brett Prescott's been
killed in action before.

587
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:49,594
Best shooter and looters
special ops ever had.

588
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:50,943
You knew him?

589
00:41:50,986 --> 00:41:53,467
Oh yeah.

590
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,602
Well, I have to inform the
president, but I need more.

591
00:41:57,645 --> 00:42:02,258
I mean, he's gonna want
to know who to bomb next.

592
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:03,172
Just kidding.

593
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:27,588
I have nothing to say to you.

594
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:30,896
The lives of these passengers
are in your hands, Senator.

595
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:32,637
The United States
of America does

596
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,682
not negotiate with terrorists.

597
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:36,728
Terrorists?

598
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:38,599
Who are the terrorists?

599
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:42,298
The ones that bomb from 10 miles
up, killing women and children.

600
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:44,562
The ones who have no
remorse whatsoever.

601
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:45,606
Why do you hate us so?

602
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,912
You obviously live in America.

603
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:47,826
You know us.

604
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,088
Exactly.

605
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:51,046
I know your arrogance,
your contempt

606
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,832
for the rest of the world,
your moral corruption,

607
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,834
and your so-called freedom.

608
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:59,359
Yes, the freedom that the
rest of the world envies us for.

609
00:42:59,402 --> 00:43:02,623
Your freedom is a joke.

610
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,844
The rich control everything.

611
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:07,410
They control you, Senator.

612
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,632
You're fanatics.

613
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:13,025
That's not religion.

614
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:15,505
You Americans are
fanatics about money.

615
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,290
Money, money!

616
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,466
I stand for family
values, spiritual values.

617
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:21,468
You people have no
respect for human life.

618
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:22,991
You treat women like cattle.

619
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:24,645
Us?

620
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:27,561
What about your daughter?

621
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,650
Is she a happy person?

622
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:32,740
Drugs, sex, alcoholic.

623
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:35,221
[speaking arabic].

624
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:37,571
Enough debate.

625
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,486
It's midnight in Washington.

626
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:44,360
Let us get to what they
call the bottom line.

627
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:46,014
Listen.

628
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:50,062
General, let's keep this real
simple, just you and me--

629
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:51,977
White House and Pentagon.

630
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:58,374
No cluster fuck with
FBI, CIA, DEA, FAA, huh?

631
00:43:58,418 --> 00:44:01,029
The plane's here,
heading south.

632
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:02,552
Libya?

633
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:04,206
Or the Sixth Fleet.

634
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,294
We're scrambling two F-16s.

635
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:25,793
Come on.

636
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:28,404
Come on!

637
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:31,407
Come on, you piece of garbage.

638
00:44:31,451 --> 00:44:33,453
Hello.

639
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:35,542
Can anybody hear me?

640
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:36,325
Come on.

641
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:45,465
God damn Japanese technology.

642
00:44:45,508 --> 00:44:46,771
Piece of garbage.

643
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:48,947
Let's see.

644
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,861
electronics.

645
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:51,210
Avionics.

646
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:52,428
Fuel management.

647
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,519
Fuel dump.

648
00:45:04,223 --> 00:45:05,354
Oh, that'll piss them off.

649
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:11,883
Yes.

650
00:45:11,926 --> 00:45:14,537
Ahmed?

651
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:17,715
I'll be right there.

652
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:18,716
[knocking]

653
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,067
[beeping]

654
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,596
See what your shooting did?

655
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:31,990
We must have a hole in
the right wing tank.

656
00:45:32,033 --> 00:45:33,861
No bullets went
in that direction.

657
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:34,862
Look at this.

658
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:36,298
We're losing cabin pressure.

659
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:37,647
Don't tell me that's not
because of your bullets.

660
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:47,745
I've got to take it
down to 10,000 feet.

661
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:50,051
Must be the avionics section.

662
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:50,878
Someone.

663
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,798
Stop it.

664
00:45:57,842 --> 00:45:58,625
I can't.

665
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:08,461
Ahmed, go down there
and check it out.

666
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,811
It's right below us.

667
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:12,465
Take the elevator.

668
00:46:12,508 --> 00:46:13,292
Go!

669
00:46:17,731 --> 00:46:19,211
We don't want you
shooting up the avionics.

670
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:32,267
BRETT: Come on.

671
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:33,747
Come in, somebody.

672
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,704
Come on.

673
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:36,141
Can anybody hear me?

674
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:37,142
Come in.

675
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:38,404
Hello.

676
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:40,145
This is Brett
Prescott, Flight 382.

677
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,015
Come in.

678
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:42,321
You're alive!

679
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:43,235
Brett, God!

680
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:50,895
I have no idea how
to work this radio.

681
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:51,852
That's why--

682
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:53,201
[dinging]

683
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:54,463
Hang on.

684
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:55,334
They've figured it out.

685
00:46:58,467 --> 00:46:59,338
No, you stay.

686
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,605
Are you all right?

687
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:52,130
It's fine.

688
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:54,001
Yeah.

689
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:56,003
I gotta get topside.

690
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,178
I'm no good to
anybody down here.

691
00:47:57,222 --> 00:47:59,746
But you don't have a gun.

692
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:01,791
As far as I can tell,
they got three left.

693
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:05,230
That's one for the cockpit,
two for the passengers.

694
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:08,537
I like my odds.

695
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:11,758
Let me take a look at that.

696
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:12,541
God.

697
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:18,852
It's really deep.

698
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:23,683
It's fine.

699
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:25,467
Brett, you're no good to any
of us if you bleed to death.

700
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:32,910
Hazards of the job, huh?

701
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:35,651
You just don't think it's
actually ever gonna happen.

702
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:38,393
Hey, hey, hey.

703
00:48:38,437 --> 00:48:41,744
The good guys are gonna win.

704
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:43,181
We got the element of
surprise this time.

705
00:48:46,184 --> 00:48:49,100
And the radio.

706
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:50,928
You know how to
work the radio?

707
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:51,798
Of course.

708
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:58,631
Thanks.

709
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:00,198
Hold on.

710
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,678
They've changed
course 34 degrees.

711
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:05,029
Looks like Libya's no longer on.

712
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:06,552
In a few minutes,
they're gonna be passing

713
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:08,032
right over the USS Brattleboro.

714
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:10,338
I mean, not to mention
civilian cruise liners.

715
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:11,296
They wouldn't be that crazy.

716
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:15,996
The president
said it's our call.

717
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,303
He knows we're minute to minute.

718
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:20,522
This is a decision
I never hoped to make.

719
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:23,743
How do you weigh lives on a
plane versus lives on a ship?

720
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:27,094
Look, if they go kamikaze,
we're gonna lose the people

721
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:29,618
on the plane no matter what.

722
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:30,968
Let's at least try to
save them on the ship.

723
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:39,498
No.

724
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:41,674
They shoot us down,
it'll be over nothing.

725
00:49:41,717 --> 00:49:43,067
No, no, no.

726
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,070
You agreed that if the
first plan didn't work,

727
00:49:46,113 --> 00:49:48,333
we would take out
an enemy target.

728
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:49,551
It can still work.
Look.

729
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:52,032
This island, it has
a landing strip.

730
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:52,946
No.

731
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,992
No.
No, no.

732
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:55,993
No.

733
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,298
No.

734
00:49:57,342 --> 00:50:01,563
Jamal, don't you
want your bother free?

735
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:02,825
What about the other prisoners?

736
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,045
Our brothers
would be more proud

737
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:07,526
if we did something bigger.

738
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:09,832
We have very little fuel.

739
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:11,573
The explosive effect
will be minimal.

742
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,800

very symbol of American power.

743
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:23,107
You are dreaming, brother.

744
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,543
You are dreaming.

745
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:28,068
We can free the prisoners
and get the money.

746
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,375
Money for the network,
for more operations.

747
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:31,419
Money?

748
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:35,162

00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:53,485

And his daughter.

760
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,754
He was on that senate
mission to the Kremlin.

762
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:05,627
Of course he has
to be in our party.

763

Well, not only is
he butt buddies

00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:08,500
with the president
with golf and all,

765
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:10,676
but we're taking control
of the Senate here.

766
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,503

767
00:51:21,513 --> 00:51:25,430

Hey, Cutter.

781
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:09,213
This is General Watkins.

782
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:10,431
Old Boomer Watkins?

783
00:52:10,475 --> 00:52:12,172
I told you you
should've stayed in.

784
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:13,565
It's safer.

785
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:14,870
You'd be a full bird
behind a desk by now.

786
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:15,741
Yeah.

787
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:16,742
Well, you know me, sir.

788
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:18,265
I'm terrified of papercuts.

789
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:19,832
Here's our situation.

790
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:22,095
We've got six hijackers,
two confirmed dead, one out

791
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,662
of action.

792
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:25,664
We've got about 50 passengers,
two dead that I know of.

793
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:27,274
And the senator?

794
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:28,536
I'm sure he's OK, sir.

795
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,711
Listen.

796
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:31,017
I've dumped about
70% of the fuel.

797
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,714
They're gonna have to land soon.

798
00:52:32,758 --> 00:52:34,107
The two leaders are fighting.

799
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,543
One wants to play missile.

800
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:37,806
The other wants to go to
a nearby tourist island.

801
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,025
I don't know-- hang on, sir.

802
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:39,895
They're sending it.

803
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:41,549
Patch us through.

804
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:43,203
We don't know if they're
going after a ship or not.

01:00:53,954 --> 01:00:57,044
Prepare to fire.

926
01:00:57,088 --> 01:00:58,002
25 seconds.

927
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:01,875
[whistles]

928
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:03,572
Shoot me.

929
01:01:03,616 --> 01:01:04,965
Do me the favor.

930
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:06,184
What's a minute more
of life, anyway?

931
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:14,105
This crazy locked himself in
and is heading for a ship.

932
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:16,063
God help us.

933
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:20,067
Get the hell out of the way.

934
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:20,851
10.

935
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:30,251
7.

936
01:01:30,295 --> 01:01:31,731
You see?

937
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,820
Security's a double-edged sword.

938
01:01:33,864 --> 01:01:36,736
5.

939
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,217
Security my ass, pal.

940
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,044
WATKINS: 3.

941
01:01:42,568 --> 01:01:43,438
Fire.

942
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:44,352
Copy that.

943
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,199
Now up, buddy.

944
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:30,616
That's a hell of a pilot to
avoid a missile at that range.

945
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:34,751
Prepare to fire.

946
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,840
Roger that.

947
01:02:36,883 --> 01:02:38,276
Hello.

948
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,060
Can you hear me?
- Yes.

949
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:41,235
Yes, you're patched through.

950
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:43,585
We have control
of the aircraft.

951
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:44,804
Hold fire.

952
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,632
[laughing in background]

953
01:02:51,506 --> 01:02:54,118
I repeat, we have control of--

954
01:02:54,161 --> 01:02:54,901
Uh-huh.

955
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:03,388
Son of a bitch.

956
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:07,479
That is, the moderates have
control of the aircraft.

957
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:09,524
The good news
and the bad news.

958
01:03:09,568 --> 01:03:10,830
I believe we can negotiate.

959
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:12,397
They have no kamikaze interest.

960
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:17,315
Great.

961
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:19,491
What's their plan?

962
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:21,580
They're heading away
from that cruise liner.

963
01:03:21,623 --> 01:03:22,755
Thank God.

964
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,236
They're on course
for that island.

965
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:28,152
Looking like a good
old fashioned hijacking.

966
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:28,979
Money.

967
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:38,292
Damn it!

968
01:03:52,698 --> 01:03:54,047
They're all up front.

969
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:54,961
Listen.

970
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:56,223
We have a chance, OK?

971
01:03:56,267 --> 01:03:58,095
All right, gentlemen,
let's roll.

972
01:04:15,373 --> 01:04:16,809
Ah, Jamal, Jamal.

973
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,218
Oh my God, Dad.

974
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:35,828
Oh my God, are you OK?

975
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,569
No.

976
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:38,962
Hadji, [speaking arabic].

977
01:04:39,005 --> 01:04:42,966
The air marshal, tie him up.

978
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:45,577
No innocent has
to die here today.

979
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:49,494
The American government is
rational and values your lives.

980
01:04:49,537 --> 01:04:50,582
All will go well.

981
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:54,760
And if you behave, we all leave.

982
01:04:54,803 --> 01:04:57,806
Senator Chambers,
please, I need your help.

983
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,766
I do not negotiate
with terrorists.

984
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:02,811
Let that be on record.

985
01:05:02,855 --> 01:05:04,552
Let me shoot him.

986
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:07,947
Hadji, that's an appealing
idea, but unfortunately,

987
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:10,210
not all hostages are equal.

988
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:13,431
I need him as a
live body for now.

989
01:05:13,474 --> 01:05:14,388
Yes.

990
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:17,000
I need someone believable.

991
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:18,915
Senator Chambers,
as a politician,

992
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:22,135
is by definition a liar.

993
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:25,747
Mr. Air Marshal, you get
to live a while longer.

994
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,910
Hey!

995
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,042
How many people are here now?

996
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:31,465
Who am I talking to?

997
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:33,815
The White House.

998
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:35,817
The president.

999
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:38,603
No, this is Robert Cline.

1000
01:06:38,646 --> 01:06:41,562
I'm authorized to act on
behalf of the president.

1001
01:06:41,606 --> 01:06:43,477
Bobby Cline, the fundraiser.

1002
01:06:43,521 --> 01:06:45,958
At least you understand money.

1003
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,178
Where is my money?

1004
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:49,788
You're asking a lot.

1005
01:06:49,831 --> 01:06:52,138
Now, we're willing to release
prisoners in exchange--

1006
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:53,444
Come on, Bobby.

1007
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:55,968
You have a $50 million
fund for rewards

1008
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,666
for so-called terrorists.

1009
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:01,060
It's a simple accounting matter.

1010
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:04,150
Send 30 and you save 50 lives.

1011
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:05,586
It's a bargain--

1012
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:08,372
600,000 per person.

1013
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,809
Dead, they will cost a lot more.

1014
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:12,593
You hear me, Bobby?

1015
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:18,469
Send 30, and you still have 20
left to offer as a reward for--

1016
01:07:18,512 --> 01:07:20,166
for me.

1017
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,908
How do we even know that the
passengers are still alive?

1018
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:24,170
Senator Chambers?

1019
01:07:24,214 --> 01:07:25,041
Hold on.

1020
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:30,829
Cline, Brett
Prescott, Air Marshal.

1021
01:07:30,872 --> 01:07:32,961
Prescott, this
is General Watkins.

1022
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:33,919
BRETT [ON SPEAKER]: Yes, sir.

1023
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:36,748
What's the situation there?

1024
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,271
We're OK, sir.

1025
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:39,794
He's right.

1026
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:42,797
We've got about, uh, 50
live passengers on board.

1027
01:07:42,841 --> 01:07:45,278
I want to talk to
Senator Chambers.

1028
01:07:45,322 --> 01:07:47,541
Um, I don't think
that's gonna happen, sir.

1029
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:48,890
He's OK.
He's just not here in the--

1030
01:07:48,934 --> 01:07:49,761
Listen, Bobby.

1031
01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:52,242
Listen carefully.

1032
01:07:52,285 --> 01:07:54,548
You have five minutes
to deposit that money,

1033
01:07:54,592 --> 01:07:57,203
or we begin to
deduct passengers.

1034
01:07:57,247 --> 01:08:00,467
Did you get that?

1035
01:08:00,511 --> 01:08:01,425
Understood.

1036
01:08:25,927 --> 01:08:26,972
DJANGO: Yes!

1037
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:27,842
Yes!

1038
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:28,669
Yes!

1039
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:36,460
Yeah.

1040
01:08:36,503 --> 01:08:37,374
Oh good.

1041
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:38,462
Now do the transfers.

1042
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:39,289
S .

1043
01:09:04,705 --> 01:09:06,838
Yes!

1044
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:08,318
How far are we?

1045
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:09,406
Well, if the coordinates
you gave me are right,

1046
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:10,929
about 20 minutes.

1047
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:12,278
But I can't find this field
anywhere in my database,

1048
01:09:12,322 --> 01:09:14,237
and I have every field
in the world in there.

1049
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,281
No, no, no, no, no.

1050
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:16,587
Captain, it's there.

1051
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:17,631
I know it's on the map.

1052
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:18,632
My colleagues just landed there.

1053
01:09:30,078 --> 01:09:31,515
Yes, sir.

1054
01:09:31,558 --> 01:09:33,212
15 minutes, sir.

1055
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:35,040
Better now than wait.

1056
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,650
We can do this.

1057
01:09:36,694 --> 01:09:38,217
Copy, read out.

1058
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,524
One round and it's all over.

1059
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:41,960
No.

1060
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:43,875
The chopper has to be
there when they land.

1061
01:09:43,918 --> 01:09:44,963
They got hostages.

1062
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:47,879
We need surprise.

1063
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:50,534
Let's take them.

1064
01:09:50,577 --> 01:09:52,362
ALL: [laughing]

1065
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:53,189
I feel great!

1066
01:10:50,115 --> 01:10:50,942
There it is.

1067
01:10:55,686 --> 01:10:56,774
Go.

1068
01:10:56,817 --> 01:10:57,601
OK.

1069
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:03,128
You, up.

1070
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:04,477
Why?

1071
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:06,566
We know who you are.

1072
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:09,003
Your father will pay millions
for his favorite daughter.

1073
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:09,830
Move.

1074
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:18,752
Django!

1075
01:11:18,796 --> 01:11:19,710
Django!

1076
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:20,537
Django!

1077
01:11:23,148 --> 01:11:24,149
CAPTAIN: You've
got to be kidding.

1078
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:31,417
Up.

1079
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:35,900
Both of you, up.

1080
01:11:40,426 --> 01:11:41,862
You might as well shoot me.

1081
01:11:41,906 --> 01:11:44,212
So we all die?

1082
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:46,127
I hear you landed on a
carrier during the Gulf War

1083
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:47,781
with your rudder shot off.

1084
01:11:47,825 --> 01:11:48,565
You can do this.

1085
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,572
PASSENGERS: [screaming]

1086
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,148
All right.

1087
01:12:07,192 --> 01:12:08,062
This is it.

1088
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:38,397
I came in too high.

1089
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:40,138
I need every bit of that strip.

1090
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:50,235
Well, at least we're
back in first class.

1091
01:12:53,891 --> 01:12:56,110
We've got to try again.

1092
01:12:56,154 --> 01:12:57,460
We've got to try again.

1093
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:28,882
[music playing]

1094
01:14:14,798 --> 01:14:15,755
MAN: We made it!

1095
01:14:15,799 --> 01:14:17,670
[hysterical laughter]

1096
01:14:23,284 --> 01:14:24,155
And watch your head.

1097
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:25,069
Watch it.

1098
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:26,026
Single file, please.

1099
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:27,419
Women and children first.

1100
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:33,425
You're safe.
You're safe.

1101
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,339
You gotta go.

1102
01:14:34,382 --> 01:14:35,775
You gotta go.

1103
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:36,689
You gotta go!

1104
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:44,871
You won't get far.

1105
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:55,534
I wonder which will give
me a greater satisfaction--

1106
01:14:55,578 --> 01:15:00,583
killing you now or having
you live with the fact

1107
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:04,674
I got away with $30 million
of the great Satan's money

1108
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:08,808
and live happily ever after?

1109
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:10,506
What do you say?

1110
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:12,769
I'd say that's a
fairy tale, asshole.

1111
01:15:12,812 --> 01:15:14,335
And fairy tales
just aren't true.

1112
01:15:17,817 --> 01:15:20,646
Say hello to Tinkerbell
for me out there.

1113
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:21,560
MAN: Hurry up.

1114
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:38,142
Everybody out.

1115
01:15:38,185 --> 01:15:39,622
Everybody out.
Be careful.

1116
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:40,623
Watch your head.

1117
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:44,148
Watch your head.

1118
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:45,149
[speaking arabic]!

1119
01:15:45,192 --> 01:15:46,542
What took you so long?

1120
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:55,028
[speaking arabic]

1121
01:15:57,727 --> 01:16:01,600
[speaking arabic]

1122
01:16:04,734 --> 01:16:07,301
Omar, hey!

1123
01:16:07,345 --> 01:16:08,215
Come on!

1124
01:16:08,259 --> 01:16:10,566
Come on!

1125
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:11,479
Hey!

1126
01:16:11,523 --> 01:16:13,394
Django!

1127
01:16:13,438 --> 01:16:15,092
[speaking arabic], come here!

1128
01:16:15,135 --> 01:16:16,441
You bastard, you take my money?

1129
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:47,646
Raise your hands slowly.

1130
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:48,865
Slowly.

1131
01:16:48,908 --> 01:16:49,779
Very slow.

1132
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:12,584
[speaking arabic]

1133
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:17,981
[speaking arabic]

1134
01:17:28,078 --> 01:17:29,470
Well, hot damn.

1135
01:17:29,514 --> 01:17:31,342
You air marshals show up
in the strangest places.

1136
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:32,604
Yeah.

1137
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,866
Well, I had it
totally under control

1138
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,563
till you guys showed up.

1139
01:17:44,094 --> 01:17:45,617
- OK, Ricky, it's your turn.
- No.

1140
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,792
I want to accompany you.
I go with you.

1141
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:47,793
No, sweetie, you gotta go.

1142
01:17:47,837 --> 01:17:48,707
No!

1143
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:50,753
You gotta go.

1144
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:51,971
Christ!

1145
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:53,843
There's still
passengers on board.

1146
01:17:53,886 --> 01:17:56,628
Reed, turn this puppy around.

1147
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,021
I don't want to miss my flight.

1148
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:23,046
We're moving?

1149
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:23,960
What the--

1150
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:35,928
Faster, Captain.

1151
01:18:41,064 --> 01:18:44,023
Closer!

1152
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:47,113
Closer, Reed.

1153
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:47,984
Almost!

1154
01:18:48,027 --> 01:18:48,898
Get in!

1155
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:01,693
Much faster, Captain.
Much faster.

1156
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:09,875
Get his hand!

1157
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:14,924
I got you.

1158
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:15,838
Come on.

1159
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:28,807
Much faster, Captain.

1160
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:29,765
Shut up!

1161
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:30,896
Much faster!

1162
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:31,810
Shut up.

1163
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:33,203
It's on full power.

1164
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:40,993
Buckle yourself in.
You OK?

1165
01:19:41,037 --> 01:19:41,907
Yeah.

1166
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:43,256
You're really cut.

1167
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,127
It's OK.

1168
01:19:51,874 --> 01:19:53,527
Daddy.

1169
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:55,878
Thank God for kids like the
United States Armed Forces,

1170
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:57,488
those bastards won't get away.

1171
01:19:57,531 --> 01:19:59,490
Sir, there are still
passengers aboard that plane.

1172
01:19:59,533 --> 01:20:00,404
Yeah?

1173
01:20:00,447 --> 01:20:01,274
Who?

1174
01:20:01,318 --> 01:20:02,188
ALL: [cheering]

1175
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:03,494
Hold on.
Hold on.

1176
01:20:03,537 --> 01:20:04,495
Quiet!

1177
01:20:04,538 --> 01:20:05,931
The plane's back in the air.

1178
01:20:05,975 --> 01:20:07,150
What?

1179
01:20:07,193 --> 01:20:08,804
There are still
passengers on board.

1180
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:10,196
At least the senator's safe.

1181
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,763
Yeah, he can
play the hero card.

1182
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:12,938
Stood up to the terrorists.
What about--

1183
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:14,505
And the $30 million?
Gone.

1184
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:16,333
We tracked it from Panama
to the Cayman Islands.

1185
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:18,335
Then it disappeared
in cyberspace.

1186
01:20:18,378 --> 01:20:20,206
How could these bastards
be smarter than us when we

1187
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,338
set up the whole damn system?

1188
01:20:24,645 --> 01:20:27,039
You're just lucky those
passengers got off back there.

1189
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,606
If we had the same
load we came in with,

1190
01:20:28,649 --> 01:20:31,217
we'd have never got this
crate off the ground.

1191
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:32,784
What now?

1192
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:36,266
We got maybe 180, 200 miles
left in the last tank.

1193
01:20:36,309 --> 01:20:38,268
Might have a shot at making
the American military base--

1194
01:20:38,311 --> 01:20:39,225
No.

1195
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:41,488
No military base, Captain.

1196
01:20:41,532 --> 01:20:44,578
The beach here.

1197
01:20:44,622 --> 01:20:48,234
If you could land on that field,
you could land on the beach.

1198
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:50,367
We better check
who's still on board.

1199
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,891
Give me the gun
and I'll go check.

1200
01:20:52,935 --> 01:20:54,850
Better I have it for him.

1201
01:20:54,893 --> 01:20:56,373
The passengers think
you're a hostage.

1202
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,940
You won't need this.

1203
01:20:57,983 --> 01:20:59,593
What about the air marshal?

1204
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:01,030
Don't worry about him.

1205
01:21:01,073 --> 01:21:04,120
He's still hanging from
a ladder on that island.

1206
01:21:04,163 --> 01:21:06,687
Now I want you to find
out what they're planning.

1207
01:21:06,731 --> 01:21:11,518
Here, take this.

1208
01:21:11,562 --> 01:21:12,780
Jamal's bomb detonator?

1209
01:21:15,522 --> 01:21:17,133
It's a tape recorder.

1210
01:21:17,176 --> 01:21:19,962
A $30 tape recorder, but
it helped us get $30 million.

1211
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,233
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1212
01:21:30,276 --> 01:21:31,190
Yeah, I think so.

1213
01:21:31,234 --> 01:21:32,452
It's just-- it's my head.

1214
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:33,627
What's happened?

1215
01:21:33,671 --> 01:21:34,846
The gun.

1216
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:35,716
Where's the gun?

1217
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,543
What?

1218
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:40,112
Get back!

1219
01:21:40,156 --> 01:21:42,288
Get back.

1220
01:21:42,332 --> 01:21:45,988
Let me by or I will
blow up the plane.

1221
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:46,989
I'll kill everybody.

1222
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:47,815
I'll do it.

1223
01:21:52,995 --> 01:21:56,346
[middle eastern music playing]

1224
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,131
Not my kind of music.

1225
01:22:01,699 --> 01:22:02,482
You want to live?

1226
01:22:17,106 --> 01:22:17,933
Hey.

1227
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:24,852
Shit!

1231
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,721
Tie this this
piece of garbage up.

1232
01:23:07,765 --> 01:23:09,114
OK.

1233
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:09,985
She's been hit.

1234
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:19,603
What a load, eh, Captain?

1235
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:20,560
Holy cow.

1236
01:23:20,604 --> 01:23:22,432
What's the situation?

1237
01:23:22,475 --> 01:23:24,434
Well, in a word,
I'd say hopeless.

1238
01:23:24,477 --> 01:23:25,304
Hopeless?

1239
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:27,350
No fuel.

1240
01:23:27,393 --> 01:23:28,916
What's the nearest air field?

1241
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,266
None.

1242
01:23:30,309 --> 01:23:32,920
Well, except maybe one.

1243
01:23:32,964 --> 01:23:33,834
Don't tell me.

1244
01:23:33,878 --> 01:23:35,401
Yeah.

1245
01:23:35,445 --> 01:23:38,187
Well, you did it once, right?

1246
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,579
You know what the
odds were that time?

1247
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:40,580
- What?
- You don't want to know.

1248
01:23:45,759 --> 01:23:47,935
Are we going to
land all right?

1249
01:23:47,979 --> 01:23:50,547
It's been real scary so far.

1250
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:51,722
You can say that again.

1251
01:23:55,769 --> 01:23:57,684
BRETT [ON SPEAKER]: That's
about the size of it, General.

1252
01:23:57,728 --> 01:23:59,164
It's been a long day.

1253
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:00,948
We should be on the ground
in a couple of minutes.

1254
01:24:00,992 --> 01:24:03,603
Or in the ground.

1255
01:24:03,647 --> 01:24:04,648
Hang in there, Cutter.

1256
01:24:04,691 --> 01:24:06,563
You've done a hell of a job.

BRETT [ON SPEAKER]:
If, uh, you could

1258
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:10,175
let my wife know
that I'm-- better

1259
01:24:10,219 --> 01:24:11,785
wait till we're on the ground.

1260
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:13,483
I'll talk to her directly.

1261
01:24:13,526 --> 01:24:14,310
You got it.

1262
01:24:17,617 --> 01:24:18,923
We're running on vapors.

1263
01:24:18,966 --> 01:24:21,273
It's got one try.
- You can do it, man.

1264
01:24:33,155 --> 01:24:35,113
No way.

1265
01:24:35,157 --> 01:24:36,201
You want me to
get out and push?

1266
01:24:41,728 --> 01:24:43,121
Gosh.

1267
01:24:43,165 --> 01:24:45,254
I need a few more drops of fuel.
- You OK, Rick?

1268
01:25:13,847 --> 01:25:14,761
Oh.

1269
01:25:14,805 --> 01:25:15,936
It's OK, Ricky.

1271
01:26:02,069 --> 01:26:03,419

01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:17,911
Ow!

1274
01:27:11,965 --> 01:27:12,923
All right.

1275
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:14,098
I'll take it from here.

1276
01:27:14,141 --> 01:27:16,013
Go, Rick.

1277
01:27:16,056 --> 01:27:17,275
Keep some pressure
on the artery.

1279
01:27:25,457 --> 01:27:27,329
Uh.

1280
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:28,808
Um.

- Where?

1285
01:27:33,465 --> 01:27:34,727
Where are the flaps?
Here?

1286
01:27:34,771 --> 01:27:35,728
There.

1287
01:27:35,772 --> 01:27:37,252
There, I think.

1288
01:27:37,295 --> 01:27:38,688
OK.

Oh my God.

01:27:50,177 --> 01:27:51,048
Hold on, Rick.

1291
01:27:55,705 --> 01:27:56,575
Brakes?

1292
01:27:56,619 --> 01:27:57,446
Brakes!

1293
01:27:57,489 --> 01:27:58,534
Where?

1294
01:27:58,577 --> 01:27:59,535
Where?

1295
01:27:59,578 --> 01:28:00,536
Here?

1296
01:28:00,579 --> 01:28:01,406
Right there.

1297
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:04,017
The brakes are there.

1298
01:28:04,061 --> 01:28:04,931
Oh my God.

1299
01:28:14,071 --> 01:28:14,854
BRETT: Whoa.

1300
01:28:23,994 --> 01:28:24,777
Dad!

1301
01:28:29,391 --> 01:28:31,218
I can't believe you did that.

1302
01:28:31,262 --> 01:28:33,873
Never bet against a couple
of New Yorkers, huh, Ricky?

1303
01:28:43,448 --> 01:28:44,536
Thank God.

1304
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,059
I see you made it.

1305
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:48,540
Prescott, how's
Captain Nichols doing?

1306
01:28:48,584 --> 01:28:50,803
Well, sir, he lost a lot of
blood, but he'll pull through.

1307
01:28:50,847 --> 01:28:52,849
If I know Nichols,
this time next week,

1308
01:28:52,892 --> 01:28:56,505
he'll be telling cocktail
waitresses hero stories.

1309
01:28:56,548 --> 01:28:59,159
Sir, I must say
something to you.

1310
01:28:59,203 --> 01:29:06,297
I expected Frankfurt to be
something more different, sir.

1311
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,211
Yeah, sure.

1312
01:29:19,223 --> 01:29:21,617
It couldn't be more perfect.

1313
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:23,793
You're back safely.

1314
01:29:23,836 --> 01:29:26,099
Baby's healthy.

1315
01:29:26,143 --> 01:29:29,233
But we still don't have a name.

1316
01:29:29,276 --> 01:29:31,453
Well-- hey, come on in here.

1317
01:29:34,412 --> 01:29:36,806
Honey, I'd like you
to meet a real hero,

1318
01:29:36,849 --> 01:29:38,721
Richard Bernard Parsons.
- Oh, hi.

1319
01:29:38,764 --> 01:29:40,375
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

1320
01:29:40,418 --> 01:29:41,419
I'm Tracy.

1321
01:29:41,463 --> 01:29:43,290
Brett told me how brave you are.

1322
01:29:43,334 --> 01:29:47,120
I wasn't really, but--

1323
01:29:47,164 --> 01:29:48,513
Oh, and this?

1324
01:29:48,557 --> 01:29:52,082
This is Richard.

1325
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:53,736
Richard Prescott.

1326
01:29:53,779 --> 01:29:55,433
Yes.

1327
01:29:55,477 --> 01:29:59,219
Um, here's a gift I
got for your newborn.

1328
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:00,699
A gift, huh?

1329
01:30:00,743 --> 01:30:01,613
What--

1330
01:30:01,657 --> 01:30:03,920
[laughing]

1331
01:30:08,272 --> 01:30:12,102
[music playing]
