1
00:00:56,642 --> 00:01:00,117
Troops is filmed on location,
with the men of the Imperial forces.

2
00:01:00,118 --> 00:01:02,848
All suspects are guilty.  Period.

3
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:05,946
Otherwise, they wouldn't be suspect,
would they?

4
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,930
I joined the Empire about six years ago,

5
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,850
I can remember as a kid,
you know, watching

6
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,000
the holographic images
and getting excited

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,540
about the new direction
that the Galaxy was taking,

8
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,180
So when I was old enough,
I went down to the local

9
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,710
recruitment center and,
you know, and signed up.

10
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,540
and I've been here at Tatooine ever since.

11
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,778
Most people would call this

12
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,370
the "ass-end of space," but

13
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,050
I like the small-town
feeling you get around here.

14
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,450
I mean, we know everybody.
Everybody.

15
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,653
And I feel like I can really

16
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:51,560
make a difference here.

17
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,090
We got a routine stop here.

18
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,690
We have a report of some

19
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:00,180
stolen droids, and...uh...

20
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,180
we think these might be it.

21
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,200
Excuse me.

22
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,260
Uh, you wanna come over here, please?

23
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,160
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

24
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,680
Uh, whose droid is this?

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,990
Uh huh... it's your cousin's.

26
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,990
Is this your cousin?  This your cousin?

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Are you his cousin?

28
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,640
No?

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Okay, then who are ya?

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,830
Ah, you're his friend.

31
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,268
Well, Mr. Friend, would you step

32
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,730
over there for a moment, please?

33
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,270
Okay, so the droid 
belongs to your cousin...

34
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,552
Now, if I go over to that sand

35
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:35,440
crawler, over there,

36
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:36,680
and ask to see your cousin,

37
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,380
is he going to have
a bill of sale for this?

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,730
Okay. Well, what I'm gonna do now, sir,

39
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,760
is place you under Imperial arrest...

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,871
So we can only help...

41
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:47,210
HEY! Am I talking to you ?

42
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,360
Am I talking to you?

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,710
Then stay over there, and shut your mouth!

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,630
Now, if ya moves again,
I'm, uh, gonna shoot ya.

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,910
No. Yeah, I understand.

46
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,929
I got a wife and kids too, but ya don't

47
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:01,075
see me out here stealing

48
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,410
Imperial droids, now do ya.

49
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,570
Yeah, sure you'll never do it again.

50
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,380
- Hey, there goes the other one.
- I got him.

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,680
Okie doke... uh, shut the camera off.

52
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,180
Yeah, shut it off.  Shut it off!

53
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,550
Well, what we had here was that...

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,862
these Jawas had stolen
some Imperial property,

55
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:35,620
and it unfortunately
turned violent.

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,229
These Jawas do this
kind of stuff all the time,

57
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:39,770
pickin' up, you know...

58
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,843
stray droids, and selling

59
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,280
them off to the highest
paying customer...

60
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,750
Well, we didn't find the droids
we were looking for.

61
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,430
But we did find one that
a kid had reported stolen.

62
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,587
So he and his parents
are gonna come down

63
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:59,860
to the detention center
and... uh... pick it up.

64
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,140
- Boy, I bet they'll be happy.
- Yep, that's what it's all about.

65
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,650
We got a call to check
out this domestic dispute.

66
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,593
Now, supposedly the husband
said something to their kid,

67
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,650
and now the wife
thinks he's run off.

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,400
Supposedly, one of them is intoxicated,
and one of them is injured.

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,375
Now, we're familiar with this couple,

70
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,710
you know this is not the
first time we've been out here.

71
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,750
So we're going to see if we
can straighten this whole thing out.

72
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,440
All right, what's the problem here, Beru?

73
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,690
I've had it!  I've had it with him!

74
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,142
He keeps lying to Luke and me,

75
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,400
and now Luke has run
off and hasn't come back.

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,600
That's ridiculous!

77
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,987
Hey! I'll talk to
you in a second,

78
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:45,850
right now I'm talking to your wife,
all right.

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,020
And Luke's probably dead now,
because of you!

80
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,560
Now, Beru, just calm down. Calm down, okay?

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,570
Now, do you want to be arrested?

82
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,470
Well, if you they keep this up,
that's just what I'm going to have to do.

83
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,960
- You don't want that, do you?
- No !

84
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,793
Okay then, are you going to calm down.

85
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:04,250
Okay, good, why don't you start over.

86
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,390
Well, yesterday Luke comes in and says,
"I think these droids..."

87
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,620
- Now, now, Luke's your boy?
- My nephew.

88
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,020
Anyway, he says "I think these
droids we bought might be stolen."

89
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,110
And then he says "Well, I don't care. 
Your only concern is to get them working."

90
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,410
And Luke is like,
"I want to go to the academy."

91
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,577
And he says, "Well, I need you

92
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:22,690
for the harvest this year."

93
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,300
And then he starts talking
about Obi-wan and his father.

94
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
- I did not.
- Yes you did!

95
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,870
- Oh...
- Yes you did!  You're just lying!

96
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,914
You're always lying to him!

97
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:33,360
You never tell him the
truth about him or his sister!

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,440
Beru, shut up!

99
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,690
No, I'm tired of shutting up!
You shut up!

100
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,330
You can both shut up or spend 
the night in the detention area, all right?

101
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,450
All right?  Now, look.

102
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,450
What do you want to do now, Beru?

103
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,150
Beru, what do you want to do now?

104
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,010
- I don't know!
- Okay, now see, that's wrong.

105
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,285
What do you mean, you don't know?

106
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,340
You obviously have a problem,
otherwise we wouldn't be...

107
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,340
I don't have a problem.

108
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Beru... come here.

109
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,480
Do you see his ear, how it's cut like that?

110
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,790
Now, 
it didn't get that way by itself, did it?

111
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,370
No.

112
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,040
And... you did that didn't you?

113
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,780
Yes, yes you did.

114
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,780
Now, see, that tells me you have a problem.

115
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,100
And when we get called in,
then it became OUR problem.

116
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,800
- But he's the one who started it...
- Now, wait a second, Beru.

117
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,180
I'm talking.
I listened to you, now you listen to me.

118
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,220
That's how this works, okay?
Now, are you going to listen to me.

119
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,570
- Yes.
- Uh huh, sure you are.

120
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,460
Now, how many times 
have we been out here, Beru?

121
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,220
A lot, huh?
We know the way by heart.

122
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,190
- What did I tell you last time?
- I don't know!

123
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,190
You don't know or you don't remember?

124
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,990
I don't know!

125
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,700
Beru, what do you want to do?

126
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
I want you to arrest him!

127
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,410
I can't arrest him.
He hasn't done anything!

128
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,380
If there's anybody I should be arresting,
it should be you, for assault.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,060
Beru, you have two choices here.

130
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,480
And yelling and arresting 
him are not two of 'em.

131
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,660
Now, you can stay here,
or we can take you to an Imperial shelter.

132
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,910
What do you want to do?

133
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,020
Beru, what do you want to do?

134
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,010
Do you want us to take 
you somewhere tonight ... huh, do you?

135
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,290
- Yes.
- OK.

136
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,390
Now, do you need to get anything?
Some clothes, or something?

137
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,410
Yes.

138
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,210
- You'll, you'll find Luke, won't you?
- Yeah, yeah. We'll find Luke.

139
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,820
He's just working!

140
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,860
What a pain in the butt.

141
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,280
See, the wife is under the delusion that
their nephew ran away.

142
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,910
And she's blaming the husband for it.

143
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,830
He's saying that the kid left early
to fix a couple of condensers,

144
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,900
and that the stress of the past week 
has just gotten to her.

145
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,991
So we're just going to
seperate them for the night,

146
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:40,490
because if we have to
come out here again...

147
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,390
Tell me something I don't know.

148
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,440
I'm tellin' ya, 
I'm ready to shoot 'em both.

149
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,240
Yep, right there with ya.

150
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,351
Look, 
she's been under a lot of stress lately...

151
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:48,970
Uh huh.

152
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,890
- We lost a couple of our hired hands...
- Uh-huh.

153
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,120
I don't know,
just got carried away a little bit.

154
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,060
Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

155
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,257
But right now,
I think the best thing for both of you is

156
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:01,720
to get some distance from
each other for a couple of days.

157
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,050
Yep,
I been telling her and telling her that...

158
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,463
I've been telling her
she needs some help,

159
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:06,900
I've been telling her
for a long time now...

160
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,480
Oh, this is probably the best thing for
her right now, you know what I mean?

161
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,050
- Just leave it alone, let it be.
- Fine.

162
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,810
You should really have
someone look at that ear.

163
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,810
- I'll be fine.
- Hmmm... Okay.

164
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,230
Let it go!

165
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,850
Should have seen this comin'...

166
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:21,374
Thermal detonator!

167
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,398
Get back, get back!

168
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
Well, as you can see,
things got a bit nasty here.

169
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,150
I mean, it's unfortunate, but it was
almost expected with these people.

But, you know,
the farmer's out here having a bad season,

171
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,040
temperatures are high,
and it's just bad for everyone.

172
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,850
The important thing now
is that we find their nephew,

173
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,650
ah, Duke?, and make sure he's ok.

174
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,630
Hey... did she say they just bought
some stolen droids or something?

175
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,310
Yep...yep, yep, yep, yep.

176
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,380
Damn shame. Damn shame.
