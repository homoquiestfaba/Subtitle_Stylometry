1
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:34,389
It's time now.

2
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:39,669
You have to look beautiful
for your funeral,

3
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:42,035
as if you were still alive,

4
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:44,837
just sleeping.

5
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:48,812
This is how they're all
going to remember you.

6
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:30,111
What's wrong?

7
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:33,115
Nothing.

8
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,620
You used to enjoy it.

9
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:52,834
Baby, I'm sorry.

10
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:57,300
Fuck. Fuck!

11
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:04,477
Anna, what's wrong?

12
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:06,141
It just- it feels like...

13
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,516
it feels like
you're somewhere else.

14
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,585
Is it about us?
Is that what it is?

15
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:17,855
It's not about us.

16
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:20,454
What is it
do you think, huh?

17
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:23,598
I don't know.

18
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,002
Listen,

19
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,165
I just want us
to be happy again.

20
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:37,034
Are you happy?

21
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,712
I'm happy.

22
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,944
Anna, I love you so much.

23
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:12,543
Hey, Jack.

24
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,641
Didn't you hear me, jackoff?

25
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:19,587
You deaf, jackoff?
Can't fucking speak either?

26
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:20,986
- Say something!
- Hey.

27
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:24,153
What's going on here?

28
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:26,629
- Nothing, Ms. Taylor.
- Nothing?

29
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:29,097
It doesn't look like nothing.

30
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:32,069
You boys get back to class.

31
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:34,333
Now!
Back to class.

32
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:37,869
Jack, you okay?

33
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:47,645
- I think it's dead.
- Which one?

34
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,415
That guy? No.

35
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:55,754
Poor thing.
He's just scared.

36
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:57,886
See?

37
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,374
Jordan, are you guys
picking up George Shore?

38
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:21,316
George is...

39
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,689
Hello?

40
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,821
Is somebody there?

41
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:48,963
- Jack?
- Did I scare you, Mr. Taylor?

42
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:51,566
No, um...

43
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,701
it's locked.

44
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,619
Shouldn't you be home?

45
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:05,987
My mom's picking me up.

46
00:07:06,023 --> 00:07:08,720
Okay, well, I've gotta run.

47
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:11,922
- Where are you going?
- To a funeral.

48
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:14,624
- My old piano teacher.
- Can I come?

49
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:16,633
No, Jack.

50
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:20,102
A funeral's a very-
a very private affair.

51
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:22,732
I've never been
to a funeral before.

52
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:25,105
It wouldn't be appropriate.

53
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:27,167
Anyway,
wouldn't your mother worry?

54
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,179
- Not really.
- I'm sure she would.

55
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,379
Have a wonderful day, okay?

56
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,008
I'll see you in class tomorrow.

57
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:36,679
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

58
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:31,504
We have entrusted our brother
James Hutton to God's mercy

59
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,342
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection...

60
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:02,934
White roses
they were his favorite.

61
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:05,568
How did you know?

62
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:07,600
They just seemed
appropriate somehow.

63
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:16,243
Mrs. Hutton, I'm so sorry.

64
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,051
Thank you, Anna.

65
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,819
You look tired, dear.

66
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:24,157
No no, I'm fine.

67
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,186
Everything's fine.

68
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:02,758
- I'm so sorry.
- You scared the life out of me.

69
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,623
I'm sorry.

70
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:07,597
Oh! Your hair.

71
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:09,998
- Do you not like it?
- No, I didn't say that.

72
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,592
It's just very...

73
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:13,536
it's very red.

74
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,061
Not really you, is it?

75
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,632
- Are you ready to order?
- Yes.

76
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:20,439
We'll have the duck, please.

77
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:22,412
- Paul.
- You always have the duck here.

78
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:24,777
I don't always have the duck.

79
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,416
- I'll have the duck.
- Yes, ma'am.

80
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,718
The duck's very good.

81
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:35,657
Listen, let's

82
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:38,184
come here.

83
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:39,992
Let's try not to fight
tonight, okay?

84
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,123
- Okay.
- Okay.

85
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,561
What are we drinking?

86
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:48,003
Oh yes, all right.

87
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,666
It's good.

88
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,643
And it has a very
expensive-looking label.

89
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,373
What's the special occasion?

90
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,882
There's something I really
need to talk to you about.

91
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,044
About us. I've been offered
a transfer to head office

92
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:04,554
in Chicago.
It's gonna mean a lot more work,

93
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,648
of course a lot of responsibility
and a lot of changes,

94
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:11,388
but it's an incredible opportunity
and I'd be crazy to turn it down.

95
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:14,022
So I'm thinking maybe

96
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,623
it's time for us to

97
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,724
- You're leaving me.
- What?

98
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:20,759
You could have told me this morning.
You didn't have to buy me off

99
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:23,103
- with this expensive dinner.
- Anna, wait.

100
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,732
- No.
- You told me everything

101
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:27,073
- was gonna be okay.
- Don't be ridiculous.

102
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,978
- Anna, you've got it all wrong.
- I'm not being ridiculous.

103
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:32,676
Jesus Christ, can we get through
one meal without arguing?

104
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:34,344
- No. No.
- Please, just one meal!

105
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:36,580
Apparently we can't.
Apparently I'm not capable of that.

106
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:38,383
Maybe you aren't.
I'm beginning to wonder.

107
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:40,412
- Fuck you.
- Please, everyone's watching.

108
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,222
- Don't do this.
- Fuck you!

109
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,854
You're- you're crazy.
You're just like your goddamn mother.

110
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:48,729
I am nothing like my mother.

111
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,926
You know,
I'm not running after you, Anna.

112
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:52,696
Good!

113
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,501
Shit.

114
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,607
- Fuck.

115
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,374
Anna, Anna!

116
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,940
Anna, come on.
Please open the door.

117
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:09,214
- I don't want to hear it.

118
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:11,084
I want you to come.
I want you to come to-

119
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:14,114
Don't do this.
Anna! Hey hey hey.

120
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:17,150
Anna, I want you to come to-
I want you to come to Chicago.

121
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:19,958
Anna, Anna- God damn it!

122
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:21,988
Please don't go.

123
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:24,432
Shit.

124
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:28,198
Oh, Anna.

125
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:46,748
Fucking asshole.

126
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,526
* Are we having *

127
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:55,794
* Are we having fun? *

128
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,165
* Are we
having fun? *

129
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:02,763
* Fun *

130
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:05,275
* Are we having fun? *

131
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:08,267
* Are we
having fun? *

132
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,271
- Shit!

133
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:27,340
Where am l?

134
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:33,949
You're in a funeral home.
You're dead.

135
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:37,454
You were in a car accident.

136
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,828
Shit.

137
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:47,133
You hit a truck loaded
with metal pipes.

138
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,970
I'm not dead.

139
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,171
You were pronounced dead
eight hours ago.

140
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:59,648
Your blood no longer circulates
through your body.

141
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:02,777
Your brain cells are slowly dying.

142
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,049
Your body's already decomposing.

143
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:08,316
I'm not dead.

144
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:22,760
This is your death certificate.

145
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:25,068
Cause of death,
massive internal trauma.

146
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,837
Time of death: 8:23 p.m.

147
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:31,245
You were dead on arrival.
The attendant physician signed here

148
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:33,614
at 9:45 last night.

149
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,853
I'm sorry.

150
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:44,854
What's happening?
Why can't I move?

151
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,834
Don't touch me.
Why are you touching me?

152
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,634
I'm preparing your body.

153
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:58,198
You have to look beautiful
for your funeral.

154
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,642
But I'm not dead.

155
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,475
You all say the same thing.

156
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:05,882
Maybe you should rest now.

157
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:19,922
Oh my God.

158
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:23,161
I can't be dead.
I can't be dead.

159
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,566
This must be a nightmare.

160
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:27,730
Oh, God, wake up.

161
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,035
Wake up.

162
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,908
Wake up. Wake up!

163
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:37,581
Anna.

164
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:21,757
Baby, you've got it wrong.
I want you to come to Chicago.

165
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,487
I want you to come.

166
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:26,559
Okay, we've gotta talk.

167
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,929
I'm gonna come by your place
before I go to the office

168
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:30,933
and everything's going to be fine.

169
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:36,499
I promise.
Call me when you get this.

170
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,606
I love you so much.

171
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:43,472
Okay, I'll see you soon.

172
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:58,691
- The shell grows
- Hi, I'm...

173
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:00,196
Iooking for Anna Taylor.

174
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,424
I'm sorry,
you can't just come in here.

175
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,991
I'm Anna's fiance
Paul Coleman.

176
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:07,469
This is her room, right?

177
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,131
She didn't come in today.

178
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,505
Did she call in sick?

179
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,442
She didn't call in at all.

180
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:18,379
Okay, yeah, thanks.
Sorry. Thank you.

181
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,782
Funeral director:
She's a schoolteacher.

182
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:30,191
I know. It's always so difficult
when they're so young.

183
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:36,294
That's right, you knew her.
She was at your funeral.

184
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,796
She's in good hands now.

185
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:07,126
- Oh, hi, Diane.

186
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:10,361
- Is Anna home?
- I think you'd better come in.

187
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,527
What's wrong?

188
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:15,163
What happened?
Where is Anna?

189
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:20,001
Anna was in
a car accident last night.

190
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:21,738
My daughter's dead.

191
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:24,645
That's what's happened.

192
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,975
Car accident?

193
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:32,385
When? What-
what are you talking about?

194
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:34,447
I don't know.

195
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:37,187
They said it happened
just before 8:30.

196
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:41,029
We were at-

197
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:42,861
no, we were at a restaurant.

198
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,266
You shouldn't have let her
drive in that weather.

199
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:48,328
She can't be dead.

200
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:52,134
There must be some mistake.

201
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,537
There's no mistake.

202
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,949
And flowers- how appropriate.

203
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:04,953
What?

204
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,786
Why wouldn't you call me?

205
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:13,819
You took her away from me.

206
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:17,356
I don't want you
anywhere near her.

207
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,645
Please don't hurt me.

208
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:37,950
How could I hurt you?
You're already dead.

209
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:39,922
I can't be dead.

210
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:42,016
Then why are you here?

211
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,856
Just let me go.

212
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:52,028
Please please.
I won't tell anyone. I promise.

213
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:55,334
You're still in denial.

214
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,169
You have to trust me.

215
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:03,006
I'm only here to help you.

216
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:15,518
What's happening?

217
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:21,328
Why can't I feel anything?

218
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,544
Why are you keeping me here?

219
00:23:52,062 --> 00:23:54,154
- What are you doing?
- Shh shh shh.

220
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:56,664
Don't be scared.
This will relax your muscles.

221
00:23:58,802 --> 00:24:01,066
Stop the rigor mortis setting in.

222
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:04,606
So I can work on your body.

223
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:11,013
Your mother's early.

224
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:19,285
I'm so very sorry, Mrs. Taylor.

225
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:22,417
It's always so tragic
when one loses a child.

226
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:25,121
If you'd care to come to my office,
we can make arrangements.

227
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:27,857
- I want to see her.
- But she hasn't been prepared.

228
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:29,525
I don't care.
I want to see her.

229
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:31,466
Of course. This way.

230
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:54,088
- Oh, forgive me.

231
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:55,886
As I said,

232
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:58,622
I've only just started
preparing her.

233
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:01,825
So sorry.

234
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:03,332
What's the point

235
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:06,495
of preserving the body
if the soul has already left?

236
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:09,505
No, the soul is still here.

237
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:13,909
It's we who suffer.

238
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:16,003
We who are left behind.

239
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:20,006
Who's going to take care
of me now?

240
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:22,177
Did you think about that?

241
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:29,758
I'll confirm the date
with Father Graham this afternoon:

242
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,317
Friday, as you requested.

243
00:25:32,562 --> 00:25:34,689
Just do what you think is best.

244
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:37,924
It's just details.

245
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:47,475
Oh, there is one thing.

246
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,775
- Yes?
- Her hair.

247
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:51,804
She was a brunette.

248
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:53,838
I'd like it back to that color.

249
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:56,284
Of course.

250
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:26,605
Mom, you were supposed to pick
me up from school yesterday.

251
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:30,848
I waited.

252
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:33,184
I'll take a look at the clock,
see how many seconds you have

253
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:35,054
to find the two Easter eggs.
You have 30 seconds.

254
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,322
You understand the problem?
And of course the usual catch

255
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,294
is on "Beat the Clock" is
you can't use your hands.

256
00:26:39,328 --> 00:26:40,818
You have to go after these
with your teeth.

257
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:48,526
I must be in shock.

258
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:51,193
I'm just in shock.
It's okay.

259
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:28,635
Father Graham,
thanks for calling back.

260
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:32,301
Yes, I'd like to confirm
the burial service for Friday.

261
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:36,938
The deceased is Anna Taylor.
T-A-Y-L-O-R.

262
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,607
Yes, she's downstairs.

263
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,886
Hello? Hello!

264
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:50,289
Let me out!

265
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:58,398
Let me out!

266
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:25,187
May I help you?

267
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:27,491
- Eliot Deacon?
- Yes.

268
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:29,498
Paul Coleman.

269
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:32,831
Of course, the lawyer.

270
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:36,165
It's a small town.

271
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:38,834
In my line of work you get
to know everyone eventually.

272
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:42,035
I'm Anna Taylor's fiance.

273
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:46,037
That's strange. She wasn't
wearing an engagement ring.

274
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:50,081
Well, not quite fiance.

275
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,111
Mr. Coleman,
I am so sorry for your loss.

276
00:29:52,154 --> 00:29:54,020
- I'd like to see her.
- I'm afraid

277
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:55,888
the viewing isn't
until Thursday evening.

278
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:57,789
I need to see her right now,
please, if that's possible.

279
00:29:57,827 --> 00:30:00,421
I'm sorry it's not possible.
You're not family.

280
00:30:00,462 --> 00:30:02,863
- Please give me five minutes.
- I do understand, Mr. Cole

281
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,265
You don't understand!
You don't understand.

282
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:07,462
- Paul?

283
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:11,963
- Paul, Paul!
- It's my fault.

284
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:14,067
I'm down here.

285
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,078
Please,
please let me just see her.

286
00:30:17,113 --> 00:30:20,082
There really is nothing I can do.
I'm so sorry.

287
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,880
Let me out!

288
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:29,121
Paul!

289
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,482
Who was that?

290
00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:00,822
No one.

291
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:04,959
No one?

292
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:12,128
- It was Paul.
- I know.

293
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:15,068
I heard you talking to him.

294
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:18,469
Why wouldn't you
let him see me?

295
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:25,040
Did you love him?

296
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:27,606
That's none of your business.

297
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,017
You weren't gonna tell me
he was here, were you?

298
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:33,284
No.

299
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:35,257
- Why?
- Because it would only hurt you.

300
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:39,260
You have to let go of the living
just as they have to let go of you.

301
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,456
I don't believe you.

302
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:44,023
Why are you doing this to me?

303
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:46,694
You're all the same.
You all blame me for your death

304
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:48,727
- as if it were my fault.
- No,

305
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:51,172
you drugged me so my mother

306
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:53,971
Others, they just see you
as a dead body on the slab.

307
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,979
Only I can see you as you really are.

308
00:31:58,914 --> 00:32:00,848
You're a lunatic.

309
00:32:00,884 --> 00:32:03,751
You're crazy.

310
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:07,154
You're completely crazy.

311
00:32:09,025 --> 00:32:11,994
I don't have time for this.
I'm a busy man.

312
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:17,759
Oh, I nearly forgot.
How tall are you?

313
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,098
Why?

314
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:23,037
I need to know your height
for your coffin.

315
00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:34,876
Let's say 5'3" then.

316
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:39,347
Wait. No.

317
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:57,731
Mr. Coleman, I heard
about your girlfriend.

318
00:32:57,774 --> 00:32:59,799
I'm sorry.

319
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:02,106
Is Tom in?

320
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:04,078
The captain just stepped out.
He won't be long.

321
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:05,740
You can wait in his office
if you want.

322
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:09,149
Um, no, thanks.
I'll just grab a drink.

323
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:23,855
Piece of shit.

324
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:22,206
Are you okay?

325
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:25,217
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

326
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:27,777
I'm fine.

327
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:37,427
I just found out.

328
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:40,900
I'm so sorry, man. Look,
if there's anything you need at all

329
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:43,664
- I need to see Anna.
- What do you mean?

330
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:47,434
The funeral director said I couldn't
see her because I wasn't family.

331
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:50,103
Please talk to him, Tom.
You know, pull some strings

332
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,271
or show him your badge
or something.

333
00:35:52,313 --> 00:35:53,871
I can't do that, Paul.

334
00:35:56,983 --> 00:35:58,815
I fucked up, man.

335
00:36:03,356 --> 00:36:05,655
Are you sure you're okay?

336
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:07,557
Huh? Yeah.

337
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:09,892
I always fuck everything up.

338
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:38,545
Oh God.

339
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:41,146
I don't want to die.

340
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:24,621
Who was she?

341
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:26,996
Mrs. Whitehall.

342
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:45,048
You shouldn't be afraid of her.

343
00:38:45,084 --> 00:38:47,144
The dead can't harm the dead.

344
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:48,815
But I'm not dead!

345
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:55,590
Stay where you are.

346
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:57,256
Give me the scissors.

347
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,327
I only want to help you.

348
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:03,927
I'll kill you.
I swear to God I will kill you.

349
00:39:13,347 --> 00:39:15,405
Go ahead.

350
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:25,222
Go on.

351
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:29,128
What are you waiting for?

352
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:37,034
Look,

353
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,834
I'm breathing.

354
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:43,206
I'm breathing.
Maybe I was in some kind of coma

355
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:46,577
- and the doctors made a mistake
- You died, Anna.

356
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:48,479
Everyone dies.

357
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:51,608
How can I be dead
if I'm talking to you?

358
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:53,414
You're talking

359
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:56,287
not because you're alive,

360
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:59,450
but because I have a gift.

361
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,831
I can talk to those
between life and death.

362
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:05,854
Why?

363
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,336
To help them
make the transition.

364
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:13,499
So am I a ghost?
Is that why I'm here?

365
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:16,566
You're here so I can bury you.
Come.

366
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,577
No, please, I don't want

367
00:40:18,612 --> 00:40:21,081
You're a corpse, Anna.
Your opinion doesn't count anymore.

368
00:40:21,115 --> 00:40:24,881
But I'm breathing.
I must still be alive.

369
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:26,613
Oh, you people!

370
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:30,249
You think because you breathe,
piss, shit you're alive?

371
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:33,885
You clutch onto life as if
your life was worth clutching onto.

372
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:38,525
Was your life worth
clutching onto, Anna? Was it?

373
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:41,795
Maybe you died a long time ago.

374
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:48,996
I'm surprised you're
still arguing with me.

375
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:51,340
You don't have much time left.

376
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,608
Your funeral's in two days.

377
00:40:58,652 --> 00:41:02,418
Soon you're going to be enclosed
in a coffin and buried in the ground.

378
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:04,686
No one can hear you then.

379
00:41:04,724 --> 00:41:07,090
No one can speak to you there.

380
00:41:56,477 --> 00:41:58,809
- Are you scared?

381
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:28,501
You're not ready.

382
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:02,871
You're not ready.

383
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,733
...struggling,
you don't have much time left.

384
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:32,863
There's nothing.
He's right.

385
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:35,431
What have you done
with your life?

386
00:43:35,477 --> 00:43:38,842
Maybe you did die
a long time ago.

387
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:42,075
Maybe you did
die a long time ago.

388
00:43:45,985 --> 00:43:49,443
- I'm disappointed with you.
- Who are you?

389
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,117
I am you.

390
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:54,923
Maybe you are better off dead.

391
00:44:38,506 --> 00:44:40,563
Paul!

392
00:44:44,945 --> 00:44:47,139
Can I help you?

393
00:44:47,181 --> 00:44:49,706
Then perhaps
you can help me.

394
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:51,581
Could you throw these
away for me, please?

395
00:45:08,068 --> 00:45:11,003
There's no life left in them.
They belong in the garbage.

396
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:18,168
Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?

397
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:21,306
I thought this was
Ms. Taylor's funeral.

398
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:23,543
Ah, Ms. Taylor, no.

399
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,552
Her funeral is not until Friday.

400
00:45:26,586 --> 00:45:28,748
Where is she now?

401
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:31,450
Um, she's downstairs.

402
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,981
Why?

403
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:35,459
Why? Because she's not ready.

404
00:45:37,097 --> 00:45:38,791
Is the flower for her?

405
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:41,858
- She was my teacher.
- Aha.

406
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:45,166
- And you are?
- Jack.

407
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:50,307
Well, Jack, what did you think?

408
00:45:50,344 --> 00:45:53,177
- About what?
- About Mrs. Whitehall's funeral.

409
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:55,374
You find it interesting?

410
00:45:55,414 --> 00:45:57,075
It was okay, I guess.

411
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:01,414
I see.

412
00:46:01,456 --> 00:46:04,287
Are all funerals the same?

413
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:06,758
No, Jack.

414
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:08,590
They're never the same.

415
00:46:08,628 --> 00:46:10,824
Each one is special.

416
00:46:10,863 --> 00:46:14,302
The dead always speak to us
in different ways.

417
00:46:15,635 --> 00:46:17,661
What do you mean?

418
00:46:17,706 --> 00:46:21,367
It was a pleasure
talking to you, Jack.

419
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:50,530
Why did you do this?

420
00:46:55,842 --> 00:46:58,139
Why did you do this?!

421
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:02,604
Is this the afterlife?

422
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:08,516
Because it feels more like hell.

423
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,758
Paul.

424
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:32,836
Paul...

425
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:00,967
Anna?

426
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:08,670
No.

427
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:12,813
Anna.

428
00:48:14,588 --> 00:48:15,816
Anna.

429
00:48:25,065 --> 00:48:26,760
No!

430
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:14,238
- What is that?
- It's your dress

431
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,215
- for your funeral.
- My funeral dress?

432
00:49:17,251 --> 00:49:19,945
Your mother brought it
around this morning.

433
00:49:40,507 --> 00:49:43,441
I'm not ready to die.
Not yet.

434
00:49:46,979 --> 00:49:49,574
There's nothing
out there for you anymore.

435
00:49:54,956 --> 00:49:57,753
I'll be back soon.

436
00:50:45,037 --> 00:50:46,131
Oh, come on.

437
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:49,367
Shit!

438
00:50:57,516 --> 00:50:59,815
- Fuck.

439
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:06,181
One more key, come on.

440
00:51:12,065 --> 00:51:14,590
20 dollar, four cents.

441
00:51:14,633 --> 00:51:16,863
Thank you.

442
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:25,074
Sir, your change.

443
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:11,501
Oh.

444
00:54:25,391 --> 00:54:27,052
Please be there.

445
00:54:35,902 --> 00:54:37,427
Please be there.

446
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,534
Please pick up.
Please pick up.

447
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,280
Oh, come on,
answer the phone.

448
00:54:59,492 --> 00:55:02,256
Yeah?

449
00:55:02,295 --> 00:55:05,025
I'm here. It's me.
Paul, I need you.

450
00:55:05,063 --> 00:55:07,088
- Hello?

451
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:11,092
Are you there?
Paul, help me.

452
00:55:11,137 --> 00:55:13,298
- Paul.
- Please stop.

453
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,006
- Oh...

454
00:55:19,746 --> 00:55:22,077
I'm the only one
who can hear you now.

455
00:55:24,184 --> 00:55:26,152
I'd be very careful
if I were you.

456
00:55:26,186 --> 00:55:29,313
The dead have such a hold
over the living.

457
00:55:29,354 --> 00:55:32,813
- What do you mean?
- He still feels your presence.

458
00:55:32,858 --> 00:55:35,123
You're only causing him
more pain.

459
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:38,688
If you really loved him, you would
accept your death and let him go.

460
00:55:38,731 --> 00:55:41,199
Then prove to me
that I'm really dead.

461
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:43,566
Oh, you people.

462
00:55:43,603 --> 00:55:47,003
You always need proof.

463
00:55:53,813 --> 00:55:56,110
Why do l
look like a corpse?

464
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:58,242
Because you are a corpse.

465
00:56:12,398 --> 00:56:15,264
It's time you finally
accepted the truth.

466
00:56:15,302 --> 00:56:16,767
You are dead.

467
00:56:16,802 --> 00:56:18,668
You will never live again.

468
00:56:24,711 --> 00:56:27,474
I am dead.

469
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,131
Bad dream?

470
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,365
I had the craziest dream.

471
00:57:59,405 --> 00:58:02,465
I dreamt that I was in a car crash
and I was dead.

472
00:58:02,508 --> 00:58:06,534
Have you ever had a dream
where you were dead?

473
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:11,306
Paul?

474
00:58:15,456 --> 00:58:17,889
- Paul?
- Shh shh shh.

475
00:58:17,923 --> 00:58:20,155
What are you doing?

476
00:58:20,193 --> 00:58:23,753
Keep your voice down.
You'll wake the neighbors.

477
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:26,731
You don't have any neighbors.

478
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:29,735
Did you ever love me?
Did you?

479
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:33,298
Say it.

480
00:58:34,374 --> 00:58:36,137
- Say you love me.

481
00:58:38,077 --> 00:58:39,907
Are you gonna get that?

482
00:58:39,945 --> 00:58:43,006
Me? No.
It's probably for Eliot.

483
00:58:48,186 --> 00:58:51,588
Is it always like this?

484
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,487
- What do you mean?
- I thought that when you died

485
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,088
you wouldn't feel
any more pain.

486
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,131
You wouldn't have
to struggle anymore.

487
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:06,331
But it just never stops, does it?

488
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:16,447
I'll pick up the deceased
from the hospital.

489
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:20,510
Yes. This afternoon?

490
00:59:20,552 --> 00:59:23,249
It'll be fine.

491
00:59:24,856 --> 00:59:27,883
It's my pleasure, Mr. Miller.
Thank you.

492
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:35,063
I'll leave you
to sort out her things.

493
00:59:35,102 --> 00:59:36,932
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

494
01:00:10,135 --> 01:00:11,831
Okay.

495
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:13,566
Oh, wait, I want to take
a picture.

496
01:00:13,606 --> 01:00:15,597
Okay, smile.

497
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:18,806
- Nice.
- Hey, I got this for you.

498
01:00:18,845 --> 01:00:21,369
Aw, it's beautiful.

499
01:00:21,414 --> 01:00:23,644
You're beautiful.

500
01:00:23,682 --> 01:00:25,445
I'll race you to the lake.

501
01:00:25,485 --> 01:00:27,418
Oh, I'm not playing
your little games. No.

502
01:00:27,452 --> 01:00:29,682
I'll make it worth your while.

503
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:32,921
Come on!

504
01:00:35,695 --> 01:00:37,423
- Uh-oh.

505
01:00:39,798 --> 01:00:41,766
- Don't let go of me.
- I won't.

506
01:00:41,802 --> 01:00:43,030
I'll never let you go.

507
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:17,063
What's that for?

508
01:01:21,941 --> 01:01:25,398
His mouth- keep it closed.

509
01:01:46,432 --> 01:01:49,458
Now the eyes.

510
01:01:54,206 --> 01:01:56,106
Does he have family?

511
01:01:56,141 --> 01:01:58,666
Yes. A brother.

512
01:01:58,711 --> 01:02:02,146
He's coming in later.

513
01:02:03,983 --> 01:02:06,110
Did my mother cry
when she saw me?

514
01:02:08,521 --> 01:02:11,217
I'm sorry.

515
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:15,992
Did Paul?

516
01:02:17,963 --> 01:02:19,988
That's not important anymore.

517
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:23,126
I need to know.

518
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:29,001
We had an argument.

519
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,769
I tried to stop her.

520
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:33,438
No.

521
01:02:33,479 --> 01:02:36,572
No, he didn't.

522
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:44,215
You should rest.

523
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:50,556
You're getting weaker.
It's almost time.

524
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:55,892
Can I ask you a question?

525
01:02:55,934 --> 01:02:58,403
Yes, of course.

526
01:03:02,742 --> 01:03:04,539
Why do we die?

527
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:09,271
To make life important.

528
01:03:57,331 --> 01:03:59,820
- Mr. Coleman?
- Yeah?

529
01:03:59,865 --> 01:04:02,356
My name's Jack.

530
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,766
Hi. Hi, Jack.

531
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:05,668
How'd you know my name?

532
01:04:05,706 --> 01:04:07,639
Ms. Taylor was my teacher.

533
01:04:07,673 --> 01:04:09,970
I saw her last night.

534
01:04:10,008 --> 01:04:11,840
What?

535
01:04:11,876 --> 01:04:14,345
I was going past the funeral home

536
01:04:14,381 --> 01:04:17,246
and...

537
01:04:17,282 --> 01:04:19,342
Ms. Taylor stood there.

538
01:04:20,452 --> 01:04:22,443
In the window.

539
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:24,318
Wearing a red dress.

540
01:04:24,356 --> 01:04:26,825
Don't say things like that.
She doesn't even have a red dress.

541
01:04:26,858 --> 01:04:28,519
- You think I'm lying?
- Look,

542
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:31,427
Jack, I'm not in the mood, okay?

543
01:04:31,463 --> 01:04:33,932
- She needs your help.
- Anna's dead!

544
01:04:33,965 --> 01:04:36,456
Your teacher is dead.

545
01:04:38,137 --> 01:04:39,695
I can't help her anymore.

546
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:41,331
Maybe you just don't
love her anymore.

547
01:04:42,575 --> 01:04:44,769
- How dare you, you little fuck!
- Hey, whoa whoa whoa!

548
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:47,039
You think this is funny,
huh, you little weird shit?

549
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:49,842
Stay there.

550
01:04:49,882 --> 01:04:52,179
- Are you okay, honey?
- What is wrong with him?

551
01:04:52,217 --> 01:04:54,481
- Oh my God.
- Come on, let's go.

552
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:58,182
Jack, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, kid.

553
01:04:58,224 --> 01:05:00,691
I am so sorry.

554
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:22,637
Mrs. Whitehall...

555
01:05:24,282 --> 01:05:26,217
Susan.

556
01:05:26,251 --> 01:05:28,378
I hope you found
what you were looking for.

557
01:05:31,023 --> 01:05:33,490
I really enjoyed
our time together.

558
01:05:37,128 --> 01:05:39,427
Huh?
Anthony, shh shh shh.

559
01:05:39,465 --> 01:05:42,695
Anthony, always confused.

560
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:01,786
How can I help you, Officer?

561
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,947
I'd like to see the body.

562
01:06:05,858 --> 01:06:08,554
Frank Miller
I'm his brother Vincent Miller.

563
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:11,256
- I called this morning.
- Mr. Miller, of course.

564
01:06:11,296 --> 01:06:13,662
Please, I'm so sorry
for your loss.

565
01:06:13,699 --> 01:06:15,427
I hope it's no trouble.

566
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:17,867
I'd just kind of like
to see him before the funeral.

567
01:06:17,903 --> 01:06:19,369
Yes yes, no trouble at all.

568
01:06:22,807 --> 01:06:25,537
Your brother's here.

569
01:06:25,577 --> 01:06:27,978
Ah.

570
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:32,909
You've done a beautiful job.
Thank you.

571
01:06:34,186 --> 01:06:36,677
You should remember him
as he used to be.

572
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:40,987
That's the schoolteacher, isn't it?

573
01:06:41,025 --> 01:06:44,017
Yes yes, very tragic.

574
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:53,065
Something's not right here.

575
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,603
Not right?

576
01:06:57,943 --> 01:07:00,604
His smile.

577
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:03,911
Uh, it was a bit more...

578
01:07:03,949 --> 01:07:05,313
smiley.

579
01:07:05,352 --> 01:07:08,184
Smiley? Permit me.

580
01:07:11,923 --> 01:07:14,414
Uh, a little more.

581
01:07:14,459 --> 01:07:17,452
That's it, yes, thank you.

582
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:20,331
We can fix that.
Glad to be of help.

583
01:07:20,365 --> 01:07:23,358
Do you mind if I have a couple
of minutes alone with him?

584
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:27,162
No, not at all.

585
01:07:27,206 --> 01:07:29,231
- I'll be outside.
- All right, thanks.

586
01:07:51,963 --> 01:07:53,898
Oh.

587
01:07:57,936 --> 01:08:00,302
- I'm sorry.

588
01:08:00,338 --> 01:08:02,807
I, uh... I didn't

589
01:08:05,244 --> 01:08:07,610
I think I should go now.

590
01:08:07,646 --> 01:08:10,137
I'll see you at the service?

591
01:08:10,182 --> 01:08:11,979
Thank- thank you.

592
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:20,290
I just told you.
That was your brother.

593
01:08:23,129 --> 01:08:24,994
You had an accident.
You're dead.

594
01:08:25,031 --> 01:08:27,089
Why do you people
never listen to me?

595
01:08:29,936 --> 01:08:33,495
No, it's not a gift.

596
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:36,098
It's a curse.

597
01:08:37,544 --> 01:08:40,603
I take care of each of you
as if you were my children.

598
01:08:43,214 --> 01:08:45,275
I wash the shit from your bodies.
I dress you.

599
01:08:45,317 --> 01:08:47,580
I try everything to make you
look more beautiful

600
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,554
than when you were alive
and what do you do?

601
01:08:49,589 --> 01:08:52,250
You argue with me
as if it was my fault you're dead,

602
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:53,451
as if I was to blame.

603
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:56,120
You're not talking to me now?
What?

604
01:08:56,161 --> 01:08:58,062
Hmm? What?

605
01:08:58,098 --> 01:09:00,429
You don't want to?

606
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:03,866
You don't talk because...

607
01:09:03,902 --> 01:09:07,134
you have nothing to say.

608
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:11,241
And you have nothing to say

609
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:14,973
because you're a corpse.

610
01:09:15,013 --> 01:09:16,607
Uh uh! No.

611
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,641
Now I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

612
01:09:31,498 --> 01:09:33,728
I'm off to school.

613
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:40,263
Stop the clock.
You have 25 seconds left.

614
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:42,330
You had the right idea,
but let me give you one little tip.

615
01:10:07,701 --> 01:10:10,534
What's it like?

616
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:12,435
Are you afraid?

617
01:10:12,472 --> 01:10:14,940
- Jack.

618
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:19,578
You have an empathy
with the dead.

619
01:10:22,415 --> 01:10:25,384
You are drawn to them
just as they are drawn to you.

620
01:10:25,418 --> 01:10:27,181
That's a rare gift.

621
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:29,518
I know you saw Anna.

622
01:10:32,493 --> 01:10:34,619
You're frightened by it, yes?

623
01:10:35,762 --> 01:10:37,252
You shouldn't be afraid.

624
01:10:38,265 --> 01:10:40,824
Christ had the same gift.

625
01:10:40,868 --> 01:10:42,926
He raised Lazarus

626
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:45,062
and spoke to the dead.

627
01:10:45,105 --> 01:10:47,573
You spoke to Ms. Taylor?

628
01:10:47,607 --> 01:10:49,507
Yes.

629
01:10:49,542 --> 01:10:52,477
- You've spoken to others?
- Oh, yes, many others.

630
01:10:54,013 --> 01:10:56,106
Who was the first one
you spoke to?

631
01:10:57,951 --> 01:10:59,680
My mother.

632
01:11:02,388 --> 01:11:04,448
You shouldn't be afraid.

633
01:11:04,491 --> 01:11:05,856
Other people...

634
01:11:05,892 --> 01:11:07,917
they won't understand.

635
01:11:07,962 --> 01:11:09,862
They don't see what we see.

636
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,966
I can help you.

637
01:11:16,002 --> 01:11:17,902
I can teach you.

638
01:11:49,369 --> 01:11:52,703
She was in the window,
wearing a red dress.

639
01:11:54,607 --> 01:11:56,472
Anna, I'm sorry.

640
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:16,256
Deacon!

641
01:12:16,296 --> 01:12:19,424
Mr. Coleman, pleasure.

642
01:12:19,466 --> 01:12:20,899
She's not dead, is she?

643
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:24,335
- Mr. Coleman?
- Someone saw her.

644
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:26,338
- I'm sorry?
- One of Anna's students

645
01:12:26,372 --> 01:12:28,772
saw her in the window.

646
01:12:28,808 --> 01:12:31,504
Oh, you mean Jack.

647
01:12:33,913 --> 01:12:36,404
- You know him.
- Of course I know him.

648
01:12:36,449 --> 01:12:38,747
He often comes around here.

649
01:12:38,785 --> 01:12:41,310
He's an 11-year-old boy,
Mr. Coleman,

650
01:12:41,354 --> 01:12:44,381
and like all young boys
has a vivid imagination.

651
01:12:44,424 --> 01:12:47,154
- Now if you'll excuse me.
- I don't think he imagined it.

652
01:12:47,194 --> 01:12:49,354
I think he really saw her.

653
01:12:51,131 --> 01:12:52,757
With all due respect,

654
01:12:52,799 --> 01:12:54,767
maybe you just want
to believe he saw her.

655
01:12:54,801 --> 01:12:56,200
Fuck you.

656
01:12:56,237 --> 01:12:57,761
Anna!

657
01:12:57,805 --> 01:12:59,136
Mr. Coleman.

658
01:12:59,172 --> 01:13:01,732
Anna!

659
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,814
- Anna!
- Mr. Coleman.

660
01:13:07,847 --> 01:13:10,372
- I think you should leave.
- Anna!

661
01:13:12,218 --> 01:13:13,207
Anna!

662
01:13:20,226 --> 01:13:22,194
She's in here, isn't she?

663
01:13:28,368 --> 01:13:30,700
Give me the fucking key, please.

664
01:13:30,738 --> 01:13:32,364
Anna!

665
01:13:32,405 --> 01:13:35,204
She's dead.
You need to let her go.

666
01:13:35,241 --> 01:13:37,539
She's accepted her death

667
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:39,807
and now she's at peace.

668
01:13:43,917 --> 01:13:46,681
Please, Anna, I'm sorry.

669
01:13:48,421 --> 01:13:49,787
I can't do it.

670
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:53,417
I can't live without you.

671
01:13:53,459 --> 01:13:55,792
Anna!
Open the door, please.

672
01:13:55,829 --> 01:13:59,127
Mr. Coleman, she's dead.

673
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:02,692
I know what you're going through.
Denial's a natural part of grieving,

674
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:04,533
but you have to accept she's gone.

675
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:07,368
- She needs my help.
- You can't help her anymore.

676
01:14:07,408 --> 01:14:09,841
Believe me.

677
01:14:14,847 --> 01:14:16,645
Anna! Hey!

678
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,245
Give me the key.
Give me the fucking key.

679
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,083
Mr. Coleman, do you want
me to call the police?

680
01:14:26,726 --> 01:14:28,957
I'll save you the trouble.

681
01:14:49,048 --> 01:14:50,982
I need you to issue
a search warrant.

682
01:14:52,018 --> 01:14:54,543
I need a fucking search warrant, Tom.
You gonna help me out or not?

683
01:14:54,587 --> 01:14:56,418
- Paul, sit down.
- Tom, I don't have time.

684
01:14:56,457 --> 01:14:58,890
Sit down.

685
01:15:00,093 --> 01:15:02,721
I just got a call
from Eliot Deacon.

686
01:15:02,762 --> 01:15:05,196
Are you out of your fucking mind?

687
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:07,495
He won't let me see her.
He's keeping her. She's not dead.

688
01:15:07,533 --> 01:15:09,899
She was in a car accident, Paul.
Her car was wrecked, remember?

689
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:12,302
- It's downstairs.
- She's not dead.

690
01:15:12,338 --> 01:15:14,899
Tom, she's not dead!

691
01:15:16,243 --> 01:15:18,710
Here's the coroner's report.

692
01:15:20,913 --> 01:15:22,574
The paramedics phoned it in.

693
01:15:22,615 --> 01:15:24,743
They only checked
for eye dilation and pulse.

694
01:15:24,784 --> 01:15:27,776
The doctor signed the death certificate
without seeing the body.

695
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,015
- So?
- So there was no EEG, nothing.

696
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:32,252
- He could have drugged her and-
- Drugged her?

697
01:15:32,292 --> 01:15:33,815
- Yes!
- Actually, Chief,

698
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,055
um, there are drugs like that.

699
01:15:36,094 --> 01:15:37,960
Yes.

700
01:15:37,997 --> 01:15:40,966
Hydronium bromide,
total paralysis within seconds,

701
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,968
heartbeat slows to almost nothing.

702
01:15:43,002 --> 01:15:44,937
Thank you. Tom, listen,

703
01:15:44,971 --> 01:15:46,997
the little kid Jack, he saw her.

704
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,100
I saw her.
She was on the slab dead.

705
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,203
- No no!
- I have seen dead bodies.

706
01:15:52,245 --> 01:15:54,805
- Believe me, she was definitely dead.
- No no no!

707
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:58,305
Tom, listen, go down there.
Just check the place out.

708
01:15:58,351 --> 01:16:01,287
On what grounds?
You have any evidence?

709
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,453
No.

710
01:16:05,491 --> 01:16:06,924
But-but- no.

711
01:16:06,959 --> 01:16:08,790
Do you have anything?

712
01:16:12,598 --> 01:16:14,998
I think she may have called me.

713
01:16:15,034 --> 01:16:17,525
Called you?

714
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:20,266
Collect or long distance?

715
01:16:20,306 --> 01:16:22,832
Fuck off!

716
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,941
Let me get this straight,

717
01:16:25,979 --> 01:16:30,006
first you hit a fucking kid,

718
01:16:30,049 --> 01:16:32,540
then you attack Deacon,

719
01:16:32,585 --> 01:16:35,612
and now you're telling me

720
01:16:35,655 --> 01:16:38,216
that your dead girlfriend

721
01:16:38,257 --> 01:16:40,453
called you?

722
01:16:40,493 --> 01:16:43,554
You're losing it, pal.

723
01:16:43,596 --> 01:16:46,156
You need to pull yourself
together here.

724
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:47,962
Okay?

725
01:16:49,368 --> 01:16:50,562
Yeah.

726
01:16:50,604 --> 01:16:53,629
You're gonna see her
tomorrow at the funeral.

727
01:16:53,673 --> 01:16:56,039
And that will help.

728
01:16:56,075 --> 01:16:58,509
That'll give you closure.
It's what you need.

729
01:16:58,544 --> 01:17:00,774
You need to let go right now, Paul.

730
01:17:02,982 --> 01:17:05,143
You just gotta let go.

731
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:14,923
Why do I have to get dressed?

732
01:17:14,962 --> 01:17:17,863
Tomorrow's your funeral.

733
01:17:17,897 --> 01:17:20,388
- Already?
- I told you,

734
01:17:20,433 --> 01:17:23,094
you only had three days.

735
01:17:23,137 --> 01:17:26,663
I told you to use your time well.

736
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:33,779
I have so many regrets.

737
01:17:36,283 --> 01:17:39,377
I have nothing but regrets.

738
01:17:40,988 --> 01:17:43,354
I wanted a different life.

739
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:45,857
Then why didn't you do
something about it?

740
01:17:47,426 --> 01:17:49,417
I tried.

741
01:17:50,763 --> 01:17:53,493
Nothing ever seemed to change.

742
01:17:55,835 --> 01:17:57,804
I woke up every day.

743
01:17:57,837 --> 01:18:00,499
I took a shower.

744
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:04,476
Drove in the same traffic to work.

745
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:06,637
Went home.

746
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,409
Went to sleep.

747
01:18:09,448 --> 01:18:12,508
Woke up again.

748
01:18:12,552 --> 01:18:15,113
Nothing was ever different.

749
01:18:15,154 --> 01:18:17,487
What did you really
want from life?

750
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:20,759
I wanted to be happy.

751
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:23,591
Happy. You all say
you wanted to be happy.

752
01:18:23,629 --> 01:18:25,290
What does that mean?

753
01:18:25,332 --> 01:18:27,594
Don't you understand
that's the whole point?

754
01:18:27,633 --> 01:18:29,829
I- I don't know.

755
01:18:29,869 --> 01:18:31,564
Yes, you do.

756
01:18:31,604 --> 01:18:34,038
You're just too scared
to admit it to yourself.

757
01:18:34,073 --> 01:18:37,167
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

758
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:40,043
- I just want it to be over.
- What did you want from life?

759
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:42,047
I don't fucking know.

760
01:18:42,082 --> 01:18:43,480
Yes, you do. What did you want?

761
01:18:43,516 --> 01:18:46,110
- I wanted love.
- What did you want, Anna?

762
01:18:46,152 --> 01:18:48,347
I wanted love.

763
01:18:48,387 --> 01:18:51,948
You had love.
Paul loved you.

764
01:18:53,593 --> 01:18:55,959
You don't understand.

765
01:18:55,995 --> 01:18:59,363
I wanted to love.

766
01:19:00,667 --> 01:19:02,725
I was too scared.

767
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:06,967
My mother...

768
01:19:10,109 --> 01:19:12,738
when I was little I learned that...

769
01:19:14,347 --> 01:19:16,872
Ioving someone
meant getting hurt.

770
01:19:20,854 --> 01:19:23,687
So I decided not to love anyone

771
01:19:23,723 --> 01:19:25,658
so I'd never get hurt again.

772
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,692
I kept pushing Paul away.

773
01:19:33,633 --> 01:19:35,100
He thought I didn't love him.

774
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:39,731
Did you?

775
01:19:39,772 --> 01:19:42,866
He was the only one I loved.

776
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:49,210
But I could never say it.

777
01:19:52,953 --> 01:19:55,546
And then he stopped loving me.

778
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:04,062
What would you do if you had
another chance?

779
01:20:07,366 --> 01:20:09,062
I don't know.

780
01:20:26,352 --> 01:20:29,412
Well?
Isn't this what you wanted?

781
01:22:13,092 --> 01:22:15,719
I thought you were different.

782
01:22:15,762 --> 01:22:18,821
You all say you're scared of death,

783
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:23,198
but the truth is
you're more scared of life.

784
01:22:29,341 --> 01:22:32,504
I'm glad I'm dead.

785
01:22:35,314 --> 01:22:37,748
I'm glad it's over.

786
01:22:52,198 --> 01:22:54,167
You said you could teach me.

787
01:23:01,274 --> 01:23:03,969
It's only a hole in the ground.

788
01:23:06,613 --> 01:23:08,546
- It's for
- Ms. Taylor?

789
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:10,573
Exactly. For Anna.

790
01:23:10,616 --> 01:23:13,779
- She belongs here.
- Because she's dead?

791
01:23:13,819 --> 01:23:16,913
No, because there's no life
left in her.

792
01:23:17,957 --> 01:23:20,323
- What do you mean?
- Don't you see?

793
01:23:20,359 --> 01:23:24,159
I'm the only one that can see all these
corpses wandering around aimlessly.

794
01:23:26,031 --> 01:23:28,659
All they do is piss and shit,

795
01:23:28,701 --> 01:23:31,499
suffocating us with their stench,

796
01:23:31,537 --> 01:23:34,529
doing nothing with their lives,

797
01:23:34,573 --> 01:23:38,475
taking the air away from those
that actually want to live.

798
01:23:40,446 --> 01:23:42,312
I have to bury them all.

799
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:47,381
I have no choice.

800
01:23:50,689 --> 01:23:52,247
Now there's two of us.

801
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,359
It's time now.

802
01:24:34,266 --> 01:24:37,292
You have to look beautiful
for your funeral.

803
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:52,044
This will relax your muscles.

804
01:24:52,084 --> 01:24:54,143
Make your skin radiant,

805
01:24:54,187 --> 01:24:56,654
as if you were still alive.

806
01:24:58,557 --> 01:25:00,855
This is how they're all
going to remember you.

807
01:25:00,893 --> 01:25:03,055
Can I see myself one last time?

808
01:25:03,094 --> 01:25:05,120
Hmm?

809
01:25:05,164 --> 01:25:07,655
Can I see myself one last time?

810
01:25:10,469 --> 01:25:12,096
Of course.

811
01:25:25,118 --> 01:25:27,712
This is the end.

812
01:25:27,754 --> 01:25:29,779
The last part's the most difficult.

813
01:25:29,823 --> 01:25:32,655
You're going to have
to face it alone, but-

814
01:25:33,892 --> 01:25:35,985
you'll be at peace soon.

815
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:54,243
- You lied to me.
- Anna,

816
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:57,579
we've been through this before.
You're just imagining.

817
01:25:57,616 --> 01:26:00,107
- You lied to me.
- Anna, you're still

818
01:26:00,152 --> 01:26:02,780
clutching onto life.

819
01:26:02,821 --> 01:26:05,256
Anna!

820
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,451
Don't give
into your fears now.

821
01:26:07,493 --> 01:26:10,223
- Don't give into your fear.
- You lied to me.

822
01:26:10,262 --> 01:26:13,198
You're so-ooo close.

823
01:26:13,232 --> 01:26:15,497
Why did you lie to me?

824
01:26:15,534 --> 01:26:18,504
So close.

825
01:26:19,939 --> 01:26:22,168
That's it.

826
01:26:45,664 --> 01:26:47,325
Violets

827
01:26:47,366 --> 01:26:49,596
they were her favorite flower.

828
01:26:49,636 --> 01:26:52,627
How did you know?

829
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:55,105
Violets seemed
appropriate somehow.

830
01:26:58,511 --> 01:27:00,705
We have come here today

831
01:27:00,747 --> 01:27:03,544
to remember and to mourn
our Sister Anna

832
01:27:03,582 --> 01:27:05,709
and give thanks for her life.

833
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:14,391
Dear God, as we stand here
in the silence of Thee today,

834
01:27:14,426 --> 01:27:16,554
to commit Anna to the ground

835
01:27:16,594 --> 01:27:18,962
and commit her spirit
into Your keeping

836
01:27:18,997 --> 01:27:21,899
and comfort one another
in our grief,

837
01:27:21,935 --> 01:27:23,959
in Your mercy...

838
01:27:27,406 --> 01:27:29,874
I am the resurrection
and the life...

839
01:28:02,542 --> 01:28:04,338
What is it?

840
01:28:05,944 --> 01:28:07,673
She's so cold.

841
01:28:15,254 --> 01:28:17,085
I'm so sorry.

842
01:28:38,011 --> 01:28:41,343
Don't be scared.
It's better this way.

843
01:28:52,292 --> 01:28:54,418
She's at peace now.

844
01:29:09,007 --> 01:29:11,441
You said she was alive.

845
01:29:11,476 --> 01:29:13,467
I never said she was alive.

846
01:29:13,512 --> 01:29:15,377
I just said

847
01:29:15,414 --> 01:29:16,939
I saw her.

848
01:29:20,052 --> 01:29:22,487
You need a ride?

849
01:29:23,856 --> 01:29:25,551
Okay.

850
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:28,082
I'll see ya.

851
01:29:28,127 --> 01:29:30,788
- Mr. Coleman?
- Yeah?

852
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:33,491
Don't forget
to fasten your seatbelt.

853
01:29:47,747 --> 01:29:48,906
Imagine, Anna,

854
01:29:48,981 --> 01:29:51,279
the whole world- your mother,

855
01:29:51,316 --> 01:29:53,614
your fiance, your friends

856
01:29:55,354 --> 01:29:57,788
everyone has buried you.

857
01:29:59,057 --> 01:30:01,993
They have placed a stone
above your body,

858
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:04,495
and they've said their goodbyes

859
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:07,658
and gone back to their TV dinners

860
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:09,667
and shopping malls thinking

861
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:12,136
that this is never
going to happen to them.

862
01:30:21,247 --> 01:30:23,806
- I'd give anything...
- They said I wasn't gonna...

863
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:27,182
- I'm not
- I know I'm not dead.

864
01:30:33,993 --> 01:30:36,222
Think about it, Anna.

865
01:30:39,865 --> 01:30:42,663
Think about it
while you still can.

866
01:31:07,159 --> 01:31:08,524
No.

867
01:31:11,163 --> 01:31:13,189
No no.

868
01:31:13,231 --> 01:31:15,564
No, I'm alive.

869
01:31:16,735 --> 01:31:18,930
God, no, help!

870
01:31:29,915 --> 01:31:31,382
Oh, shit.

871
01:31:33,585 --> 01:31:35,917
Don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

872
01:31:35,954 --> 01:31:37,216
Go to hell.

873
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:40,891
Mr. Coleman, I think

874
01:31:40,926 --> 01:31:43,487
you should show
a little more respect.

875
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:46,020
I know she wasn't dead.

876
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:51,326
Wasn't she?

877
01:31:56,174 --> 01:31:59,372
You have no idea what happens
when someone dies,

878
01:31:59,412 --> 01:32:01,504
what happens to their body,

879
01:32:01,546 --> 01:32:04,413
what happens
to their soul.

880
01:32:04,449 --> 01:32:07,816
You think Anna was still alive
after the accident?

881
01:32:10,256 --> 01:32:12,951
Maybe you're right.

882
01:32:15,895 --> 01:32:18,522
Maybe she's still alive.

883
01:32:19,731 --> 01:32:22,199
Why don't you go
and find out for yourself,

884
01:32:22,234 --> 01:32:24,395
Mr. Coleman?

885
01:32:26,004 --> 01:32:27,596
Find out

886
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,234
whether she's dead

887
01:32:30,275 --> 01:32:32,402
or alive.

888
01:32:33,745 --> 01:32:36,714
- You sick fuck!

889
01:32:36,748 --> 01:32:39,615
- Oh.
- You psychotic fuck.

890
01:32:39,651 --> 01:32:41,744
You don't have much time left.

891
01:32:41,787 --> 01:32:43,219
What's he doing?

892
01:32:52,397 --> 01:32:55,195
Don't be scared.

893
01:32:55,234 --> 01:32:57,497
It's better this way.

894
01:33:15,954 --> 01:33:17,421
Let me out!

895
01:33:19,591 --> 01:33:21,525
Come on.

896
01:33:22,862 --> 01:33:23,919
- Paul!

897
01:33:33,905 --> 01:33:35,203
No.

898
01:34:25,123 --> 01:34:27,524
Is it over?

899
01:34:32,497 --> 01:34:35,227
Yes, Jack, it's over.

900
01:35:01,459 --> 01:35:04,189
Okay.

901
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:06,356
Anna?

902
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:09,926
Okay, Anna.
Anna, I'm here.

903
01:35:09,968 --> 01:35:12,801
I'm here.

904
01:35:12,837 --> 01:35:14,703
Oh my God.

905
01:35:17,176 --> 01:35:19,075
Anna.

906
01:35:24,316 --> 01:35:26,250
Okay.

907
01:35:27,752 --> 01:35:30,243
Baby, please, please.

908
01:35:30,288 --> 01:35:33,850
Please.

909
01:35:35,594 --> 01:35:37,221
- Paul?
- Oh God.

910
01:35:37,262 --> 01:35:39,355
Baby. Thank God.

911
01:35:39,397 --> 01:35:40,796
- Paul?
- Yeah yeah.

912
01:35:40,832 --> 01:35:42,698
You came back for me?

913
01:35:42,734 --> 01:35:45,100
I did.
I came back for you.

914
01:35:45,137 --> 01:35:47,935
- You're safe now.
- I love you.

915
01:35:47,973 --> 01:35:49,873
- I always loved you.

916
01:35:49,908 --> 01:35:51,569
What's that noise?

917
01:35:51,610 --> 01:35:55,046
It's just the scissors for your clothes.

918
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,948
Eliot just put them on the table.

919
01:36:08,727 --> 01:36:11,127
Where am l?

920
01:36:11,162 --> 01:36:13,096
You're in a funeral home.

921
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:14,997
You're dead.

922
01:36:15,033 --> 01:36:17,058
I'm not dead.

923
01:36:17,102 --> 01:36:20,698
You had a car accident.
You swerved off the road

924
01:36:20,739 --> 01:36:23,105
and you hit a tree.

925
01:36:23,141 --> 01:36:24,768
I saw Anna.

926
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:26,674
You buried her alive.

927
01:36:28,814 --> 01:36:31,509
You never made it
to the cemetery.

928
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:35,011
And you never saw Anna.

929
01:36:37,088 --> 01:36:39,649
- You're dead.
- I'm not dead.

930
01:36:42,794 --> 01:36:44,557
You people,

931
01:36:44,596 --> 01:36:46,757
you all say the same thing.

932
01:36:49,167 --> 01:36:51,294
I'm not dead.

933
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:17,891
I'm not dead.

934
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:20,557
* Wake *

935
01:37:20,598 --> 01:37:23,192
* From your sleep *

936
01:37:25,837 --> 01:37:29,204
* You're drying off *

937
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:33,301
* Your tears *

938
01:37:33,344 --> 01:37:35,973
* Today *

939
01:37:37,115 --> 01:37:39,344
* We escape *

940
01:37:41,287 --> 01:37:44,984
* We escape *

941
01:37:49,829 --> 01:37:52,729
* Pack *

942
01:37:52,765 --> 01:37:55,494
* And get dressed *

943
01:37:57,435 --> 01:38:01,600
* Before your father *

944
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,939
* Hears us *

945
01:38:04,976 --> 01:38:08,070
* Before *

946
01:38:08,113 --> 01:38:11,082
* All hell *

947
01:38:11,116 --> 01:38:17,248
* Breaks loose *

948
01:38:21,259 --> 01:38:25,993
* Breathe *

949
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:29,363
* Keep breathing *

950
01:38:31,137 --> 01:38:34,969
* Don't lose *

951
01:38:36,174 --> 01:38:39,007
* Your nerve *

952
01:38:44,783 --> 01:38:48,685
* Breathe *

953
01:38:50,555 --> 01:38:53,524
* Keep breathing *

954
01:38:54,726 --> 01:38:58,254
* I can't do this *

955
01:39:00,064 --> 01:39:02,794
* Alone *

956
01:39:12,444 --> 01:39:14,504
* Sing *

957
01:39:15,847 --> 01:39:18,783
* Us a song *

958
01:39:20,386 --> 01:39:23,821
* A song to keep *

959
01:39:23,855 --> 01:39:27,848
* Us warm *

960
01:39:27,892 --> 01:39:30,360
* There's *

961
01:39:31,363 --> 01:39:34,263
* Such a chill *

962
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:40,069
* Such a chill *

963
01:39:44,476 --> 01:39:47,877
* And you can *

964
01:39:47,912 --> 01:39:50,404
* Laugh *

965
01:39:52,383 --> 01:39:58,481
* A spineless laugh *

966
01:40:00,391 --> 01:40:02,757
* We hope *

967
01:40:02,794 --> 01:40:06,560
* Your rules *

968
01:40:06,598 --> 01:40:11,502
* And wisdom *

969
01:40:11,537 --> 01:40:15,997
* Choke you *

970
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:18,873
* Now *

971
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:22,437
* We are one *

972
01:40:23,948 --> 01:40:27,783
* In everlasting *

973
01:40:27,819 --> 01:40:31,619
* Peace *

974
01:40:31,656 --> 01:40:34,557
* We hope *

975
01:40:34,592 --> 01:40:37,356
* That you choke *

976
01:40:38,696 --> 01:40:42,929
* That you choke *

977
01:40:46,838 --> 01:40:49,363
* We hope *

978
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:53,105
* That you choke *

979
01:40:54,445 --> 01:40:58,506
* That you choke *

980
01:41:02,454 --> 01:41:04,649
* We hope *

981
01:41:06,024 --> 01:41:08,652
* That you choke *

982
01:41:10,062 --> 01:41:14,464
