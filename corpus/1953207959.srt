1
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,600
You going somewhere?

2
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,790
Yeah, I gotta get up
early in the morning.

3
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,989
You don't wanna stay the night?

4
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,490
John, can you help me zip this up?

5
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,350
My name is David.

6
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,740
It's nothing... personal.
You're a decent guy.

7
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,010
I'll let myself out.

8
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,849
Hey, what up dude?

9
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,330
What happened to that hottie
you brought here last night?

10
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,970
The usual.

11
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,059
Yeah, she left.

12
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,089
Nailed and bailed, huh?

13
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,239
Yeah.

14
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,739
God, you're such a pig!

15
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,230
Whatever. You just don't get it.

16
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,329
I'm just happy for the guy.

17
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,739
Yeah right. Good one.

18
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,599
She didn't even know my name.

19
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,890
Remember when I used to wake up next
to chicks and not know their name?

20
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,390
Sometimes you forget my name.

21
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,340
Of course you didn't stay the night.

22
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,029
Yeah.

23
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,940
Exactly.

24
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:33,189
So what are you bitching about?

25
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,820
Cause I'm sick of these
one night stands!

26
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,319
How often is this going to happen?

27
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,850
This eternal spiral I keep going down.

28
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,869
I wanna girl I can
actually hang out with.

29
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,679
A girl I can play video games with.

30
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,729
You don't even play video games.

31
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,230
Yeah Vickie. That's besides the point.

32
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,970
I guess...

33
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,469
I guess it's not really Maggie, but...

34
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,969
I guess, I'm not really out
there looking for "the one".

35
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,470
Uhh, uhh, I guess I'm looking, but...

36
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm not... not really
expecting to find her.

37
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,179
Well, maybe if you stopped
looking in dive bars!

38
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,089
Well, it's the only place I'm
comfortable talking to girls.

39
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,000
You get a few drinks in me and I...

40
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:23,279
loosen up. I'm never going to see
them again, so I'm not gonna mess it up.

41
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,409
You know it...?

42
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,719
When it comes to a girl
you really wanna...

43
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,219
spend time with its like...

44
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,540
something different.

45
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,049
You know what it is? I freeze up.
I get nervous.

46
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,929
I start sweating. I'm afraid I'm gonna
do the wrong thing; say the wrong thing.

47
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,950
Make the whole thing awkward.
Just ruin the moment.

48
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:47,179
Epic fail, bro! Epic fail.

49
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,679
You just gotta get out of that
comfort zone your in, man.

50
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,658
Get out of my comfort zone?

51
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:52,128
Yeah.

52
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:54,580
This coming from a guy who hasn't
put on a pair of pants in 2 months.

53
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:57,789
Shut up! You don't even know how
hard it is to live this lifestyle.

54
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,009
Oh my god, I'm sure it's so difficult.

55
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,520
I'm sure it'd be a lot
more difficult if you

56
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:03,029
didn't have a bunch of
rich dead relatives.

57
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,849
Hey!

58
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,529
Just because he's
willfully unemployed...

59
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,769
does not mean he doesn't work hard.

60
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,029
He's dating me.

61
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,150
Damn straight!

62
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,880
We're gonna find you a girl, David.

63
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,010
Don't strain yourself.

64
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,000
Hey.

65
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:49,860
Hey.

66
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,029
What about the neighbor?

67
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,469
You know the one with the cute dog.
The one that David has a crush on?

68
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,550
I'm right here.

69
00:21:56,551 --> 00:22:00,019
Oh, wait, not the dog... the girl.

70
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,450
Thanks for pointing that out.

71
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,490
I got that.

72
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:05,259
Never mind. Hey David...

73
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,090
Hmmm?

74
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,589
Will you get..uh... will
you go get the newspaper?

75
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,469
Will you go get the newspaper?

76
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,490
Cause, I don't want to miss this level.

77
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,395
It's level 30, and
we're gonna get wings.

78
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,289
Will you go get it?

79
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,790
Oh! Fine.

80
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,289
Anything else?

81
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,720
The paper.

82
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,480
Boz. Boz, where are you?

83
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,449
Hi!

84
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,480
Hi.

85
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,219
Boz. Walking your dog, huh?

86
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,929
More like he's walking me.

87
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,379
Hi. I'm Jen.

88
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,959
I'm John...

89
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,229
Uh, I'm David. My name's David.

90
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,930
Great.

91
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,600
Guess I'll see you around then, David.

92
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:12,100
Yeah! See you. See you around.

93
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm John!?!

94
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,400
What the hell is wrong with me?

95
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,969
Hey Meg. I was just
thinking about calling you.

96
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,769
Oh my god! Me too!

97
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,889
And then I did, because I know
exactly what you need right now.

98
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,429
Retail therapy!

99
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,969
I'm not going shopping.

100
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,555
Why not? I thought you
said you moved to LA to

101
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:02,139
stop moping around and
get on with your life.

102
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,639
That and to be close to
me and my AWESOMENESS!

103
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,619
And the whole moving on thing too.

104
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,450
Whatever. So you ready? You wanna go?

105
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:12,219
I have too much unpacking to do.

106
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,229
Then don't. Fill your
closets with new stuff.

107
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,189
Come on. It will be good for you
to get out and meet other people.

108
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,869
I just talked to someone.

109
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,080
A neighbor. We had a perfectly
normal conversation.

110
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:25,259
Perfectly normal. So there's
nothing to worry about.

111
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,129
OK. Seriously, Jen,
you need new clothes.

112
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,460
I didn't want to be mean about it.

113
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:32,119
But your stuff is from like, eons ago.

114
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,109
It's kind of getting embarrassing.

115
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,609
Have you seriously not been
shopping since you've been single?

116
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,359
Fine. I'll go.

117
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,349
Great. OK if Audrey comes too?

118
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,730
Sure. Awesome. See you in a bit.

119
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,850
[Doorbell. Knocking]

120
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,949
Hey girl. You ready to go yet?

121
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,450
We just got off the phone?

122
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,950
I'll go get my shoes.

123
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,960
She must think the world waits for her.

124
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,460
Some people can be so inconsiderate.

125
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,960
Hey doggie.

126
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,109
Ready to go?

127
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,470
Jen. This is way to close to pastels...

128
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,489
These were on their way
out 5 minutes ago.

129
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,569
No one wears this blend of
cotton and rayon anymore.

130
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,190
They just don't.

131
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,080
Come on let's go.

132
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,189
Do you see me in your cross hairs?

133
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,940
Not right now.

134
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,350
What are you doing out
here little buddy?

135
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,850
Look at you.

136
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,610
Let's go inside.

137
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,190
Stop!

138
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,689
Check it out!

139
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,859
Look what I found in the backyard.

140
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,360
Oh, it's a puppy! Let me see 'im!

141
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,419
Hi!

142
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,539
What an angel!

143
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,300
Seriously?

144
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,790
Get back over here. We're
almost at the next save point.

145
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,290
I love you!

146
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,789
What's his name?

147
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,419
His name is Boz.

148
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,249
Hi Boz.

149
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,469
Hey this is that girl's dog, huh?

150
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,489
Mmm hmm.

151
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,250
Come on. Come on. Get back in the game.

152
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,229
Not going to wait all day.

153
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,909
Oh, I love you. Isn't he cute?
Isn't he sweet?

154
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,339
Ah, come on.

155
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,070
What, you...?

156
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,158
Isn't he sweet?

157
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,710
You really think this thing is cute?

158
00:27:17,711 --> 00:27:21,679
My ovaries are just throbbing.
I love him so much.

159
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,709
OK. It's time to go buddy.

160
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,929
Hey. Wait a minute man.

161
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,719
You know what you can do?

162
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,939
What's that?

163
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,379
You want to get to know that girl right?

164
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,110
Yeah.

165
00:27:32,111 --> 00:27:33,189
Well.

166
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,399
Instead of bringing this
guy back right away...

167
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,459
How 'bout you keep him, and
offer to help her find him?

168
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,710
Wow, that is terrible!

169
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:43,959
That way when you give him back
in a few days... you're a hero!

170
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,150
That is terrible!

171
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,719
That's one of the worst
ideas I've ever heard!

172
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,309
I don't know about that.

173
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,809
Remember peanut butter chili fries?

174
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,609
No, dude, no.

175
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,859
Come here. Bye baby.

176
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,479
See you later.

177
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,320
Get away from these crazies, huh?

178
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,820
Huh. Peanut butter chili
fries were pretty bad.

179
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,980
Looks like you're going to
be staying with me tonight.

180
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:46,350
At least for a little while.

181
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,850
Don't look all excited or anything.

182
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,280
Let's go.

183
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,530
She wasn't home.

184
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,520
I'm not doing it.

185
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,189
Boz!

186
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,690
Bozzie! Mama's home.

187
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,580
Boz.

188
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,080
Bozzie. C'mere.

189
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,230
Bozzie.

190
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,099
Boz, where are you?

191
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,409
Boz!

192
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,909
Bozzie!

193
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,409
Where are you? Boz! This isn't funny!

194
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,120
Bozley, where are you?

195
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,679
Boz!

196
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,350
Bozley, come on!

197
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,850
Boz!

198
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,199
[Phone rings]

199
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,040
Boz!

200
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,629
Hello.

201
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,480
Hey, Jennie, I almost
forgot to tell you.

202
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:34,529
Boz is gone!

203
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,860
I looked all over the house!

204
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:39,360
In the backyard... everywhere!
I can't find him!

205
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,109
Well honey, do you want
us to circle back?

206
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,610
No. It's OK. I'll go ask
neighbors, I guess.

207
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,130
Well if you don't find him,
I'll help you post fliers.

208
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:50,189
I'll even design them for you.

209
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,999
I have some awesome ideas.

210
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,139
Um... OK.

211
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,640
OK. Well I know you'll love them.

212
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,360
Dude c'mon. What are you doing?

213
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,860
[Doorbell]

214
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,549
What?

215
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,839
Jen! Remember.

216
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,410
The plan dude.

217
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,740
Steve! Steve!

218
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,240
Damn it.

219
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:46,280
OK. OK. Here goes.

220
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,939
OK. You got this. You got this.

221
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,860
What's up Jen?

222
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,709
My Bozley, he's gone!

223
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,180
I've been running around asking all
the neighbors. Nobody's seen him.

224
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,659
OK. Well just calm down.
Everything's going to be OK.

225
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,249
No! It's not OK!

226
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,448
He's not just my baby!

227
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:14,380
He's a valuable dog.

228
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,169
Somebody might have kidnapped him.

229
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,669
He's not a puppy anymore.

230
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,959
He's only 4. But in dog-years,
it's like late 20's.

231
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,620
Oh my gosh! I don't
know what I'm gonna do!

232
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:25,540
Jennifer. What?!

233
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,040
What?!

234
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,629
What?! What is it?

235
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,569
If you want I can help you out.

236
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,599
Find him. The Bozley. The dog.

237
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,100
You know, put out fliers.

238
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,969
Ask around the neighborhood.

239
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,810
Do you want me to help you find him?

240
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,350
What do you think?

241
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,979
Cubism crossed with
abstract expressionism.

242
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,609
Just a hint of ransom note.

243
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,110
It's a poster for Jen's missing dog.

244
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,610
Oh! Contextual narrative!

245
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:38,599
So it's commentary on the desperate
plight of the lost dogs in all of us?

246
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,089
How'd you think of that?

247
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,590
Jen's dog is really missing.

248
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,739
Oh! A real time inspiration.

249
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,240
No. I mean, she asked me to make
these posters to put around town.

250
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,160
What? What is so funny?

251
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,489
Well, for starters, the
info is barely legible.

252
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,689
That drawing looks
nothing like Jen's dog.

253
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,859
I wanted to catch people's attention.

254
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,349
People will see it and try to read it.

255
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,380
Some of them will've seen Jen's dog
and one of them will call her.

256
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,429
Jen's going to love...

257
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,369
Uhh. Shut up! What do you know?

258
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,530
You're an elitist art
snob who can't appreciate

259
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:23,689
art unless you put it
into one of your -isms.

260
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,339
This is the post I write...

261
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,840
So this is the post I write...
blah... blah...

262
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,599
Oh, real mature Meg!

263
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,759
Oh, real mature, Meg!

264
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,989
You see, when you resort to this, I win.

265
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,330
I win!

266
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,830
OK you win. I win.

267
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,180
Oh, just like that.

268
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,180
Sensitive. Yes always.

269
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,430
I don't want you to tease me too much.

270
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,590
Oh my gosh, it feels so good!

271
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,030
Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop!

272
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:29,180
I win! You win.

273
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:57,739
So, is Bozley really...
important to you?

274
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,239
Yeah. He's everything.

275
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,799
He's the only one
that's ever been loyal.

276
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,300
He's never lied to me... cheated on me.

277
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,959
God I'm so neurotic!

278
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,460
It's just that after the divorce...
it was tough.

279
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,959
I moved out here to get
away from everybody.

280
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,460
Everyone except for Meg. You
can't ever get away from Meg.

281
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:28,589
Oh... you mean... have you been like...

282
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:32,540
dating anybody? No!

283
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,229
And don't ask me why not.

284
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,590
If one more person asks me I swear
I'm going to scream. Understood.

285
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,029
Buy why not? I feel
like used merchandise.

286
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:48,530
Used merchandise? You're
not used merchandise!

287
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,850
At most... you're experienced.

288
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:01,529
OK. That might not have sounded
right, but you know what I mean.

289
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:05,030
My friend Meg says I have guilt issues.

290
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,250
That until I learn to forgive others,
I won't ever forgive myself.

291
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,070
But she says a lot of things.
She's crazy.

292
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:17,130
Anyway. Enough about
me, what's your story?

293
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,330
My story?

294
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:25,010
Well, I can some that
up in about 12 words.

295
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,020
I was born..

296
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,260
I work in a cubicle.

297
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,569
And one day I'll die.

298
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:37,070
Minus the "and", that will make it 13.

299
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,569
True romantic.

300
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:44,379
But seriously though... no family?

301
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,049
No kids? No dreams?

302
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,529
Yeah dreams, but the whole
family thing, it just...

303
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:55,029
It starts out like, you
meet a nice girl...

304
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,659
I mean the right girl, whatever.

305
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,989
I'm just never good at that.

306
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,679
Talking to girls, meeting girls...

307
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,180
I really just... haven't
met the right girl yet.

308
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,170
That's sweet.

309
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,870
Assuming, it's not just a come on.

310
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:18,370
It's not just a come on.

311
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,399
But, I really do envy you.

312
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,919
I had a dream once.

313
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,699
For 2 years I felt like I was failing...

314
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,299
trying to grab onto something solid.

315
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,800
Boz is what kept me together.

316
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,830
It's getting a little late. The
sun is starting to go down.

317
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,110
Think maybe we should call it a night?

318
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:01,789
You think? He's not supposed
to be by himself after dark.

319
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:05,290
I'm sure he's fine. It's not like...

320
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,939
I'm sure somebody's found him by now.

321
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,439
Probably wandered into
somebody's back yard...

322
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,959
nestled up in a blanket somewhere.

323
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,459
He probably just had a full belly
of food and he's ready to sleep.

324
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,929
No, here look.

325
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,810
Let's just make some fliers tomorrow.

326
00:57:20,811 --> 00:57:23,546
Let's meet up have a coffee
or something and then

327
00:57:23,547 --> 00:57:26,280
start putting them up
around the neighborhood.

328
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,479
I like that.

329
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,319
Yeah? Alright.

330
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,220
Well, um...

331
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:41,190
Thanks. Yeah.

332
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,690
See you tomorrow.

333
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,460
Jen! I hope Boz is still lost
because I made the posters!

334
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,610
How did you get in here?

335
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,730
Did I leave the door unlocked?

336
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:22,305
I drew Boz as a character
to exaggerate his

337
00:58:22,306 --> 00:58:24,619
features to make him
a little bit cuter.

338
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,909
You know people are more likely to
return cute dogs than ugly dogs.

339
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,750
Like wow! What happened to that dog?
Would

340
00:58:30,751 --> 00:58:33,589
I really want to return
him to his owner?

341
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,599
What are you talking about?

342
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,300
You can't even read it.

343
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,289
I made my own posters.

344
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:41,919
David, my neighbor, is going
to help me post them.

345
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,650
I told you I was making them.

346
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:48,149
Right, um, well I knew
yours would be better.

347
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,889
So I figured that you
could post them downtown.

348
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,380
Where more people could see 'em.

349
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:56,419
And then I'll just post the boring
ugly ones around the neighborhood.

350
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,920
For brilliance! We'll
find Boz in no time!

351
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,679
Did I just kill you?

352
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,699
You did not.

353
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,199
But nice... nice try.

354
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,860
I'm gonna kill you right now though.

355
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:15,760
In your face! That's how I do it.

356
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,300
Whatever. Something's
wrong with this level.

357
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:20,049
It's lagging or something.

358
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:24,729
Oh, OK. It's lagging. That's
why I just blasted your face!

359
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:27,439
Are you gonna cry about
it Halo champion?

360
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,939
Oh, you gonna give me some tears?
Some third place tears?

361
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,439
You know it was second place.
Don't give me that crap.

362
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,009
Oh a technicality.

363
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:39,509
That's not... No don't!

364
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:43,010
Don't poke me I hate it!

365
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,510
That's her at the door! Hide the dog!
Hide the dog!

366
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:08,229
Hey. You gonna pass out some fliers?

367
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,029
Yep. Can I use your
bathroom for a second?

368
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:14,529
Yeah.

369
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:16,809
Straight back here.

370
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,449
It's Steve. Good to meet you.

371
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,010
I know right?

372
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:24,510
It's just straight back.

373
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,329
Dude! I hid Bozley right
next to the bathroom!

374
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,250
What?! Why would you do that?

375
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,379
Hey. Hey. Got any TP?

376
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,379
Yeah. Yeah. We have toilet paper.

377
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,759
It should be... under the sink.

378
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,180
Got ya. Thanks.

379
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,329
Do you have a dog? No. Why?

380
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,460
Oh. Nothing. The bathroom
just smelled a little funny.

381
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,639
Oh... yeah... that's...

382
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,829
that's residual body odor.

383
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:28,329
That is... my roommate
has this condition.

384
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:30,599
If he sweats it smells like wet dog.

385
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,109
It's gross.

386
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:34,109
It's true. It's true.

387
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,010
She said so too.

388
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:37,550
You ready to go?

389
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:41,049
Yeah. You got your flier? Yeah.

390
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,550
See you later. Later.

391
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:49,299
Now where were we?

392
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:52,800
I think we were at level 3, 3rd base.

393
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,300
Baseline.

394
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,849
They just talk too much.

395
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,049
Think so?

396
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,630
They need to learn to shut up.

397
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,400
Just shut the fuck up.

398
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:20,830
You being proactive?

399
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,669
What will it take to get
you off this couch?

400
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,440
I dunno.

401
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,940
In that case, I'm stroking your cock.

402
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,240
Oh I got you off the couch.

403
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,630
I'm really tight.

404
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,500
Let's take these off too.

405
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:36,500
Yes, kiss me. Worship me.

406
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:25,310
Your dirty fingers. Take them
out and feed them to me.

407
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:14,270
Give me your mouth. Give me your mouth.

408
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,020
Come here.

409
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:07,540
Yummy.

410
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,030
Yeah, look at me with those
pretty eyes while you suck it.

411
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,529
You're so romantic.

412
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:26,530
You're so romantic while
I suck your cock.

413
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,120
Are you trying to put
it deep in my mouth?

414
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,970
Yeah, put it way down there.

415
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,310
That's so fucking good baby!

416
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,849
I wanna fuckkkk.

417
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:20,950
Let's fuck. Let's fuck.

418
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:36,370
I love that fucking hair!

419
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,599
You wanna see that booty?

420
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,220
Fuck yeah. Come here.

421
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:42,110
Yeah, looks so fucking good!

422
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:18,120
You feel so fucking tight.

423
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,170
You gonna go deep?

424
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,020
It's swallowing up your dick.

425
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,479
It's so beautiful!

426
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,960
I love making you come.

427
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,560
Oh my god!

428
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,250
Thank you.

429
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,789
I wanna tell you about the dog.

430
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:32,779
I can't let this go any longer.

431
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,339
What?! You can't quit now.

432
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:38,839
This is wrong! I like her so
much and I'm lying to her!

433
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:43,229
The only thing that got me talking
to her in the first place.

434
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:45,139
I really like this chick.

435
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:48,640
Good for you Dave.

436
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:52,140
Just give me the dog. Come on
Boz, it's time to go home.

437
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,549
I can't let you do that Dave.

438
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,610
Come on seriously.

439
01:20:57,611 --> 01:21:01,109
Seriously, what are you gonna do?
What are you gonna say to her?

440
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:03,085
Here's your dog I've
been hiding from you

441
01:21:03,086 --> 01:21:05,060
for a few days while I
helped you find it!

442
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,069
How's she gonna take that? Like how
do you think that's gonna work?

443
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:12,570
Good luck with that 'bro.

444
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:16,070
Damnit you're right.

445
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:31,399
You know... I knew you were
a great guy when I met you.

446
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,389
Yeah. Yeah. How'd you know that?

447
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,289
Because Boz liked you.

448
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:40,659
Boz only likes good people.

449
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,559
He hated my ex.

450
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,060
Even though he was a Christmas
present from the bastard.

451
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:52,609
You know I'm not that good of a guy.

452
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:54,750
You're right.

453
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,250
You're a great guy.

454
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:04,140
I have to tell you something.

455
01:22:04,141 --> 01:22:05,900
What's that?

456
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:11,689
What's that?!

457
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:15,139
Oh!

458
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:17,809
Bozley! What is this?!

459
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:20,360
Uh, hey Jen!

460
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:25,749
We forgot to tell you that an hour ago,
a couple of blocks away, we found...

461
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,389
Boz wondering around.

462
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:29,639
We thought...

463
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,140
Steve, it's over. Forget about it.

464
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:38,319
You. You were the one who took my dog?

465
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,540
It wasn't like that.

466
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:44,039
He wandered into our yard, and...

467
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,659
You let me believe he
was missing while you...!

468
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:49,609
Helped me look? It's not like that.

469
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:53,110
What kind of person does that?!

470
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:55,309
A bad one. I don't know.

471
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:58,809
What's wrong with you?!

472
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:02,310
Oh!!!

473
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,949
All of you! You're all deranged!

474
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:11,450
Don't ever contact me again!

475
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:19,870
Game over dude.

476
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:27,179
Of course you should be angry, Jen!

477
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,059
Furious!

478
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:32,559
I know, but the anger
always turns into guilt.

479
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,450
Guilt?!

480
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,249
Roger, we can't expect
you to understand.

481
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:41,199
Maybe Jen feels guilty
for yelling at David.

482
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:44,700
I mean you have to admit
what he did was pretty cute.

483
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:48,739
If you think so...

484
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:50,389
Look.

485
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:54,929
He turned out to be a great guy, right?
And no harm came to Boz.

486
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:58,430
And you said it yourself.
Boz liked him right?

487
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,930
You realize how crazy that sounds right?

488
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,390
You're saying that she should
go by what the dog thinks?

489
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,595
And this guy lied to you from
the very moment you met him.

490
01:24:09,596 --> 01:24:12,440
What kind of relationship you
supposed to build out of that?

491
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:37,209
David? David?

492
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,709
David! You need to go outside.

493
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:41,830
You need to get out of the house.

494
01:24:41,831 --> 01:24:46,029
Because your self pity...
is stinking up the place.

495
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:49,529
I can't. I'm helping Steve.

496
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:53,029
Damn straight!

497
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:55,920
No. You need to go out tonight.

498
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:58,849
Because I need to air out this house.

499
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:01,419
Because it reeks of depression!

500
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,920
Get up! Get out of the house!

501
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,829
Sissy's in here.

502
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:18,330
Oh! That's right.

503
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:19,799
Do you come here often?

504
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,559
What?

505
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,059
I said, do you come here often?
I've never seen you before.

506
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:29,079
What? I haven't seen you here.

507
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,420
Do you come here often?

508
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:41,480
You're not gonna remember
my name are you?

509
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:50,429
My name's David.

510
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:52,570
Taylor?

511
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:56,070
DAVID!

512
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,660
Taylor.

513
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,830
Yeah. My name's Taylor.

514
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:09,640
What are you drinking?

515
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,429
Hey Jen.

516
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:16,639
Wait. Wait. Wait.

517
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,729
OK. Just give me 2 minutes. OK.

518
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:22,309
And you'll never have
to deal with us again.

519
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:24,440
What do you want?

520
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:29,169
I think you have the wrong
idea about what happened.

521
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:32,059
I think I understand perfectly
well what's going on.

522
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:33,599
I don't think you do.

523
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,749
Dave has had a crush on you since you
moved into the neighborhood. OK?

524
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:43,310
And he is so shy, I had to trick him
into talking to you last Saturday.

525
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:49,280
OK. What I'm trying to say is
that this was all Steve's idea.

526
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:53,059
OK. Dave found Boz in the backyard.

527
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,370
I don't know how he got there.

528
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:57,289
But he returned him to your
house, but you weren't there.

529
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,289
So he brought him back to our house.

530
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:02,789
And Steve came up with this idea.
Dave thought it was stupid...

531
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:05,549
It is really stupid because
Steve is really stupid.

532
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:09,050
And... he just got mixed up in it.

533
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:12,929
I don't care who's idea it was.
He still lied to me.

534
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:14,879
I know but he tried to tell you.

535
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,329
But he didn't!

536
01:29:16,330 --> 01:29:20,219
OK. He's a moron. He is. OK?

537
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:24,699
But he's not as big a
moron as you think he is.

538
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:29,129
OK. It really hurt him to lie to you.

539
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:33,419
So what? He sent you over here
to beg for my forgiveness?

540
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,919
No. He doesn't even know I'm here.

541
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,420
But would you forgive him if he did?

542
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:41,669
Would you forgive him?

543
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:45,170
Jen. Your 2 minutes are up. No Jen.

544
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:48,670
We totally played D &
D together sometime.

545
01:31:52,030 --> 01:31:55,170
Boz, c'mere.

546
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:05,090
You wanna play fetch? Let's go.

547
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:18,550
Say, you OK?

548
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,910
What's this?

549
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:09,660
Hi. Hi.

550
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:19,709
I miss you too. But don't
think all is forgiven.

551
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:22,369
I wouldn't...

552
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:25,870
Cause what you did is pretty terrible.

553
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:32,099
Yeah. Look, I don't even
know where to start.

554
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:34,519
With the apology.

555
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:40,219
You already have. I'm the one
who's been holding back.

556
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:45,440
So... I'm sorry.

557
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:50,950
But I still resent you for
having to forgive you.

558
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:54,450
Well I'm sorry.

559
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,889
Should I thank you?

560
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:05,390
Yeah. Somewhere in there.
