1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,775
- There's a time when the
operation of the machine

2
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,011
becomes so odious,

3
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:15,481
makes you so sick at heart
that you can't take part.

4
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,783
You can't even
passively take part,

5
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:20,285
and you've got to put
your bodies upon the gears

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,688
and upon the wheels,
upon the levers,

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,089
upon all the apparatus,

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,791
and you've got to make it stop!

9
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:32,498
♪

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,134
- First, let me start by
saying Mario Savio's

11
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,036
"Operation of the Machine"

12
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:40,039
is one of my favorite
speeches of all time.

13
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:44,043
Mario wasn't a politician
or some famous Hollywood star.

14
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:47,212
He was just a student
who was for civil rights.

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,081
He stood on a car at Berkley

16
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,083
and screamed whatever
came into his head.

17
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:53,218
He didn't care that he had
a stuttering problem

18
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,088
or that he might get thrown
out of school, which he did.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,324
He just wanted
his voice to be heard

20
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:03,796
and be unencumbered
by the machine.

21
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,431
As an investigative
writer that has yet

22
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:08,801
to be officially published,

23
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,804
I can relate to Mario's desire.

24
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:22,114
That's me behind the wheel,

25
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:26,718
Jay Bahadur, proud college
graduate of the class of 2007,

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,654
arguably the worst year

27
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,556
since the Great Depression
to graduate school,

28
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,425
but timing was
never my strength.

29
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:43,569
In fact, good timing seems to be
at odds with my very existence,

30
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:46,738
but like many
unpleasantries in life,

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,408
you just learn to deal with it.

32
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,329
- Afternoon, shoppers--
- Yo.

33
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,532
Hey, man. Is Mark Reiss here?

34
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,368
- Reissy? Oh, he left.
- Shit, really?

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,569
- Yeah.
- Damn it,

36
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,271
he was supposed to be here.

37
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,873
- It's kind of lousy out,
if you didn't notice.

38
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,909
He left early. Are you
interviewing for stock boy or--

39
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,246
- Me? No.
My name is Jay Bahadur.

40
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:31,416
I'm doing market research
on premium napkins.

41
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,752
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

42
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:39,791
- Your name isn't even on here.
- I assure you, I am legit.

43
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,260
- You drove all the way
from Toronto

44
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,795
to ask questions about napkins?

45
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:47,699
- Premium napkins.
- Thought my job sucked.

46
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,635
- Could you show your
paper product aisle?

47
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,771
- But I'm just kind of busy.

48
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:56,542
- Is there a reason why the six
--reason why the six pack

49
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,844
This thing does not like me.

50
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,760
Is there a reason why
the six pack paisley napkins

51
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:21,567
are here and not here?

52
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,535
It's not a trick question.

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,971
- I--I think because it was just
easier putting them on the floor

54
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:29,875
than on the top shelf.

55
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:33,879
- And would making our packaging
more festive make you consider

56
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:38,383
moving the premium napkins
to the top shelf?

57
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,723
You're probably thinking

58
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,558
that a person
with my intellectual capacity

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
would loathe waiting for
that gentleman's answer

60
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,995
to my question.

61
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:53,532
But actually,
I feel quite the contrary.

62
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,933
- I would just leave them
on the bottom shelf, man.

63
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,803
It's less work.
- Less work.

64
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,472
Understanding what drives a mind
to react the way

65
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:04,343
it does to things
never ceases to amaze me.

66
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,946
My careful documentation of this
one man's opinion could,

67
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,849
in its own way,
reshape the patterns of napkins

68
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:16,488
on every home on this street,

69
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,726
including that one,
my ex-high school girlfriend,

70
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,262
Tracy Zicconi's house.

71
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,597
The darkened second-floor
window just a reminder

72
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:30,802
that she now resides
1,825 miles away at Stanford.

73
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,572
And I know it's 1,825 miles away

74
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,408
because I have an obsession
with Google Maps,

75
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,278
not with my ex-high
school girlfriend.

76
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,822
I was raised as a non-practicing
Hindu-Christian

77
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,558
half-Indian living
at this address.

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,062
This is the home of Kailash
and Maria Bahadur.

79
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,398
My well-laid-out graduation plan

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
was only to visit my former
residence on festive holidays

81
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,403
such as Canadian
Thanksgiving and Christmas,

82
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:08,940
perhaps offering my skills at
turkey basting or tree trimming,

83
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,844
but this was 2008.

84
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,347
Plans evaporated.

85
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,583
Upon my graduation from the
esteemed University of Toronto,

86
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,754
my parents had decided
to give me my own mailbox.

87
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,856
They saw it as a way in which
to somehow legitimize

88
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,759
my residence in their basement.

89
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,494
The funny thing was
that the mailman

90
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,862
refused to deliver
my mail there,

91
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,764
so Mom would sort the mail

92
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,334
and deliver it herself
after each delivery.

93
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,680
"Dear Mr. Bahadur,
the editorial staff

94
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,382
"at 'Vanity Fair' has reviewed
your story submission,

95
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,752
"and we unfortunately do not
feel

96
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:54,920
"it's something we would like
our magazine

97
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,955
"to pursue at this time.

98
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,090
We wish you the best of luck
at other publications--"

99
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,926
Blah fucking blah.

100
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,929
Why do all rejection letters
have the word "unfortunately"

101
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,031
in the first sentence?

102
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,768
Surely there is a more original
adverb to toss in there.

103
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,039
I vow that I will never
write for a publication

104
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,576
that uses the word
"unfortunately"

105
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,579
in their first sentence.

106
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,014
I am better than that.

107
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,574
Come on.

108
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:54,646
Jared? Jared?
Jared.

109
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,718
Is that my Red Bull?
- No.

110
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,554
- Look at me.

111
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,456
- Mom says you got to shovel
the snow in the driveway

112
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,158
so Dad can get in.

113
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,893
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,930
- You're not doing anything.
- Doing homework.

115
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,167
- Uh, where's mom?
- The elusive pink

116
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,769
fairy armadillo
has been known to--

117
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,439
- Mom? Mom?

118
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,907
- Yeah?

119
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,109
- Why do I have to
shovel the driveway?

120
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,913
- Your father and I
discussed this with you, Jay,

121
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:31,817
about ways for you
to contribute rent, remember?

122
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,020
And I'm so sorry about
your rejection letter.

123
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,690
Ahh!

124
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,662
- Yo!
- Ahh!

125
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,065
Are you, like, earning some
extra allowance or something?

126
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,201
- I'm starting to wonder why
I didn't commit teen suicide

127
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,036
when I could.
- Amen.

128
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,872
Yo, bro, you want to, like,
hit Parrots with us?

129
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,141
- Can't. I got to submit
my research numbers.

130
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,876
They got to be
in Chicago by tomorrow.

131
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,811
- Then fake it.
- I can't, man.

132
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,214
They figure out all sorts
of stuff based off my results.

133
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,716
- Like what?
- Like what holiday paisleys

134
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,551
are popular and stuff.

135
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,253
- Okay, bro, you lost me.

136
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,888
- Journalistic integrity,

137
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,523
it's gonna be worth
something on the resume

138
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,158
when I apply to Harvard's
journalism school.

139
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,062
- Right, right.
- Hey, I got an idea for a story

140
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,497
I'm gonna submit.
It came to me when I was

141
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,265
listening to CBC Radio today.

142
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,833
- What's--what's the angle?

143
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,035
- The end of the comedic
dictator.

144
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,005
Kim Jong is on his death bed,
and once he goes,

145
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,175
where's the dictator
comedy gonna come from?

146
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,912
- Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
He's funny and very alive.

147
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,780
- He's not funny.

148
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,782
- He's a little funny.

149
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,118
- He's a little funny, but no
one can pronounce his name.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,621
- Your story is flawed, bro.

151
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,590
- You guys want to hear
something fucked up?

152
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,527
Tracy's getting engaged.

153
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,696
- Where did you hear that shit?
- Mm, Kate.

154
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,599
She said she saw
it posted on Facebook.

155
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,802
She's gonna marry her
Lit professor.

156
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,705
- No way. Tracy is repulsed
by older men.

157
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,940
- You were older.

158
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,142
- Two years is not older, man!

159
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,144
- It's a little bit older.

160
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,580
- Fuck you, Crowe.

161
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,783
- Hey, are you sure you don't
want to hit Parrots with us?

162
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,318
- No, dude, I got to--

163
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,155
- Do some shit nobody
gives a fuck about?

164
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,057
- Exactly.

165
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,092
- All right, well,
that is your loss,

166
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:25,263
but if you change your mind,
please hit us up.

167
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,300
- You got it. Later, dudes.
- See you, buddy.

168
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:31,836
- See you.

169
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,140
- Fucking moron.
- What?

170
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,213
- Ahh! Ahh!

171
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,985
- Name's Bahadur, here

172
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,653
to see Dr. Fleshman
about my back.

173
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,822
- Have you ever been here
before?

174
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,591
- No.
- All right, you'll just need

175
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:56,795
to fill out these forms.
- Right.

176
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:57,963
- You okay?

177
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,932
- Yeah, I just hurt my back,

178
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,268
figured I'd get a jump
on being a senior citizen.

179
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:15,647
- So, you busting on grey hairs?
To make a move on Kaitlyn, eh?

180
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,086
- Excuse me?

181
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,988
- That's all right,
I understand.

182
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,025
I'd take down all of humanity
just to bang her.

183
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,996
- Seymour.
- Ooh. I was just talking.

184
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:33,365
I'm trying to keep it
a level playing field.

185
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,400
- Yeah, leave him alone.
- You know what I'm saying.

186
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:39,004
Sorry. What happened
to your back?

187
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,706
- Sh-shoveling.
- Shoveling?

188
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,677
- Yeah.
- I got, uh, shrapnel moving

189
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,812
around the vertebrae.

190
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,881
It's a bitch.

191
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,950
- Well, sounds like I got the
better end of the deal in here.

192
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,918
- Oh, bullshit.

193
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,958
Shoveling? I hate shoveling.
Pointless waste of time, no?

194
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,961
Name's Seymour Tolbin.

195
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:06,097
- Ah.
- Oh, oh, sorry.

196
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:10,902
- Wait, Seymour Tolbin?
- Yeah.

197
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,004
- The--who writes for
"The Daily Mail?"

198
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,807
- Wrote.
I'm retired, sort of.

199
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,876
But that's right. That's me.

200
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,444
- Holy fuck.

201
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:23,682
You are one of my favorite
journalists of all time.

202
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,985
- Come on. You Facebook people
have favorite journalists?

203
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,287
- You were one of the
first reporters who had the guts

204
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,023
to report the Battle of
Ong Thanh as a loss.

205
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,727
- That's--
So you're a journalist?

206
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,696
- No. Well, I mean, yeah,
I want to be,

207
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,998
but I can't--I just--you know,

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,101
I haven't taken a--
I never took a class,

209
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,470
but I'm seriously--I'm thinking
about going back

210
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,905
to get a degree.

211
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,140
Harvard is the--is the goal.

212
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:53,178
- Oh, how can you say
something stupid like that?

213
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,780
- What--
- Why do you think journalism

214
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,449
is a pile of "People" magazine,

215
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:02,887
"She got cellulite on her
Dumpster" crap right now?

216
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,458
Journalism isn't taught.
It's innate.

217
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,793
You know what I'm saying?

218
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,930
You think the shrapnel
in my back landed there

219
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:15,033
because I was using my head?

220
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,901
No way.

221
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,971
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying fuck Harvard,

222
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,873
is what I'm saying.

223
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,042
Fuck Harvard.

224
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:28,947
You want to make it as some big
swinging dick journalist?

225
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,785
You got to go somewhere
fucking crazy.

226
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,854
- Somewhere where Western
reporters would consider

227
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,756
it too dangerous to go,

228
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:42,026
like, write as a stringer
from there, get a book going.

229
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,528
It's the only way out.

230
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,099
- Yeah, that makes sense, man.
That makes sense.

231
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,070
Where you thinking of going?

232
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:56,975
- Somalia.

233
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,877
Hmm?
- Like, I--I bought a--

234
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,547
An umbrella from a Somali once.

235
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,282
- What does that mean?

236
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,217
- That means where's
the fucking conflict,

237
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,787
besides the fact that they
machete reporters to death?

238
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,188
- In Somalia the seeds
of democracy

239
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,856
are growing amidst anarchy.

240
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,391
I did a paper on it
my freshman year.

241
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,393
- So?

242
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,529
- So it's a misunderstood place.

243
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,565
- Bro, democracy is not topical,
all right?

244
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,301
No--nobody wants
to understand Somalia.

245
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,172
- Did you know in Somaliland
they held an election

246
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:32,043
where the minority clan won the
presidential office by 80 votes,

247
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,078
and there was no violence?

248
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,247
The transition of power
was peaceful.

249
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,350
- It was peaceful because nobody
bothered reporting on it.

250
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:44,222
You need to listen to me.
You want conflict?

251
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,492
You want to tell the story
from both sides?

252
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,360
Go to Sudan.

253
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:54,232
There's your ticket,
not Somalia.

254
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:58,570
- I don't know, man. I got
a good grade on that paper.

255
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,539
Somalia and me are copacetic.

256
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,875
Is a Mr. Trey Williamson here?

257
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,277
- Just left.
- Shit, really?

258
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,413
My name is, uh, Jay Bahadur.

259
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,081
I'm here to conduct
a marketing research--

260
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,917
- Who's the guy eating Doritos
on my aisle?

261
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,588
- That's my associate,
Mr. Felcher.

262
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,624
- I have to clean that shit up.
- I'm so sorry, man.

263
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,459
- Would you please--
- Continue maestro.

264
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,362
- Refrain from eating
in this poor man's aisle?

265
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,964
And just start to pick that up.

266
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:26,965
- I got it.
- Thank you.

267
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,366
- I got it.

268
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,202
- And where is your, uh,
napkin aisle?

269
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,937
- Aisle seven.
- Seven.

270
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,873
- Hey, uh, Jay?

271
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,507
I think you should
check this shit out.

272
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,643
- I thought we agreed
you would be silent, bro.

273
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:42,213
- No, bro, I really think
you should check this out.

274
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,986
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Thank you.

275
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,288
What the fuck, man?
- The rebels,

276
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,123
who Kenyan officials
liken to seagoing pirates

277
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,626
have taken captive the MV Faina,

278
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,362
a Ukrainian vessel,
off the Somali coast,

279
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,031
and they're demanding
an untold ransom.

280
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,400
Our correspondent, Mitch Kelp,
has more on the story

281
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,937
from outside the U.S.
embassy in Nairobi.

282
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,039
Mitch, what more
can you tell us?

283
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,641
- Well, Chrissy,
not a whole lot.

284
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,542
We are going off
an official press release

285
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,411
from the Kenyan government.

286
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,513
We don't have
a single source in Somalia,

287
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,482
and I'm sure as shit not gonna
get my ass shot over there

288
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,084
trying to find out
what would possess these, um--

289
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,287
Possess these crackheads
to take an unarmed tanker.

290
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,123
- Hmm. Well, Mitch, word here is
our corporate insurance policy

291
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,058
wouldn't cover you
in that hellhole,

292
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
and they'd hate to have
a lawsuit from your family

293
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,263
on their hands when they mail
you back in pieces.

294
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,266
- Thank corporate for
being so considerate, Chrissy.

295
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,602
Back to you.

296
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,139
- So until we can find
one crazy motherfucker

297
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:44,509
to head over to Somalia
and find out what's going on,

298
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,612
we'll continue to take
uneducated guesses

299
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,249
as to who these pirates are.

300
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,018
Bahadur, answer the phone!

301
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,321
- And you've got to put
your bodies upon the gears

302
00:15:56,323 --> 00:16:00,091
and upon the wheels--

303
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,459
- Hello?

304
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,195
- Hello?
Is this Mr. Jay Bahadur?

305
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,130
- Yeah.
- This is Mohamad Farole

306
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,100
from Radio Garowe
over in Somalia.

307
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,069
I got your email.

308
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,304
So you are wanting to come
to Somalia for a book.

309
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,306
You are writing on the pirates,

310
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,508
and you're looking for people
to talk to here, right?

311
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,378
- Yes, exactly.
- I must say that is more than

312
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,548
any other reporter
has been willing to do.

313
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,550
You are the first Westerner

314
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,119
to actually ask to come see
what's going on here.

315
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,356
- That's unfortunate.
- Yes, yes, it's true.

316
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,524
I'll have a conversation
with my father,

317
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,294
accommodate your request.
- Okay, okay.

318
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:39,464
And, uh, how--uh,
you think your father

319
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,200
will be able
to make this happen?

320
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,269
- I would hope so.
He is our president.

321
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,413
- Assalamu alaikum.
- Uhh.

322
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,082
- That's Somali for hello.

323
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,520
I suggest you learn it, Bahadur.
I'm out of cigars.

324
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,156
Want to walk with me?

325
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,191
- Okay.

326
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,526
Yeah, this guy Farole called.

327
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,228
I just sent out some feelers

328
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,696
to a few Somali news
services, and boom.

329
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,598
- The president's son
calls you back.

330
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,133
- Yes! I never

331
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,601
get a break like that, never.

332
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,270
- Well, uh, you create
your own reality, chief.

333
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,438
- Well, if that was true,
we would all live

334
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,106
in a solipsistic universe

335
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,508
wherein we could do
whatever we wanted

336
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,109
without any further
consequences.

337
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,178
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

338
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,280
- Michael Topper, author of
"Channeling UFOs"

339
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,382
and "The Positive/Negative
Realms Beyond This World?"

340
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,252
- You read too much.
Fuck more girls, instead.

341
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:40,625
Speaking of which, I read
that writing sample you gave me.

342
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,527
- Bad?

343
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,496
- Why the fuck would you
write a piece

344
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:49,400
on how to get away
without paying parking tickets?

345
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,602
- I thought people would laugh.
- Laugh?

346
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,305
Parking tickets pay
for the roads.

347
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,241
The roads get you
out of this shit hole.

348
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,844
- So you hated it?
- No, actually.

349
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,679
I liked it.

350
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,816
It's not the second
coming of Hunter S. Thompson,

351
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:09,120
but you write
with a good conscience.

352
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,354
- You think?
- Yeah.

353
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,623
Don't let it go to your head.

354
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,660
Bravo.

355
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:20,865
So Avril Benoit,
you know who she is?

356
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,834
- Yeah, uh, she's on CBC Radio.

357
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,303
She did a great report
on Kenya a few weeks ago.

358
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:29,407
- Exactly.
She's a friend of mine, uh,

359
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,845
and I want to put you
in contact with her.

360
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,546
- Okay.

361
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:39,217
- She's a good one
for feeding pages to.

362
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:42,887
So you got--you got
a book outline?

363
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,789
- No.
- Wrong.

364
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,592
You're formulating one, okay?

365
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,861
- I haven't. I mean, this is
all happening so fast.

366
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,130
I just--I Googled
"Somalia press,"

367
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,664
found Farole's name,
and sent out a blind email.

368
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,433
I had no idea this was
gonna blow up, none.

369
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,436
- Bahadur, you got
a book outline?

370
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,171
- No! That's what I'm trying
to tell you--

371
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:06,611
- Stop! Try again.
You got a book outline?

372
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,412
- I'm formulating it.

373
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,515
- I knew you'd get it
on the third try.

374
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,283
Come on, let's go.

375
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:17,355
So how much do you know
about Somalia?

376
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,390
- Uh, well, I did a term paper

377
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,425
on it my freshman year
at university, so.

378
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,827
- That's good.

379
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,564
Don't tell me the grade.
It's a start.

380
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,466
Immerse yourself in it.

381
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,901
You dig cigars?

382
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:32,570
- I never understood cigars.

383
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,639
- That's clever,
don't you think, Jo?

384
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,875
Okay. Save this.

385
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:41,846
By the time this thing
is over, you will.

386
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,449
Jo, thank you.

387
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:49,353
What else don't you understand?
I need to know that.

388
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,256
- The Jays are going to lose
Burnett to the Yanks.

389
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,792
They offered him 82.5 million
over five years.

390
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,296
Can you believe that?
- I have an announcement.

391
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:02,733
- What kind of announcement?
- Yes, what kind?

392
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:07,738
- Uh, I'm gonna go to Somalia

393
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,775
and write a book on the pirates,

394
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,977
try to get
some stories published.

395
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:17,648
- Somalia?
- I know what you're thinking.

396
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,586
I know you're thinking
it's batshit crazy, but I think

397
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:25,623
this is the only way
for me to become a journalist.

398
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,593
- AIDS.
- AIDS?

399
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,729
- Isn't that a problem there?
- I believe so,

400
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,565
but I'm going to write
about the pirates,

401
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,001
Dad, not sleep with them.

402
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:47,411
Excuse me,
it's my Somali contact.

403
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:52,883
Assalamu alaikum.

404
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:56,287
Shifted?

405
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:00,458
- He needs to do more yoga.
His shoulders are bad.

406
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,827
- Assalam--ciao.

407
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:15,673
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

408
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,874
I was wrong though.

409
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,643
- Wrong?
- Yeah, apparently

410
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,778
there's an additional
$500 security deposit

411
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,046
I didn't account for.

412
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,583
- 500?
- Security deposit?

413
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,985
- Yeah, just for, you know--
You know, for, like, uh,

414
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,822
vehicles and such, insurance
policies, things like that.

415
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,561
Can I borrow $500?

416
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,902
- Welcome about flight 823 now
departing for Frankfurt.

417
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,671
At this time
we'd like you to put away

418
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:47,772
all your electronic devices--
- Excuse me, sir.

419
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,540
All cell phones must be off.

420
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,941
- It's just final words
to my ex-girlfriend

421
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,010
before I had to Somalia.

422
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:57,448
I'm, uh, basically looking for
a little sympathy, maybe a wow.

423
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,320
Personally, between me and you,
I'd settle for an LOL.

424
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,488
- Off, please.
- Right, right, sorry.

425
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,324
I want to take
a moment now to say

426
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,858
that not all the characters
in this film

427
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,327
are exactly like
they are in real life,

428
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,629
except for that stewardess.

429
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:14,098
I felt she needed to be
depicted completely accurately

430
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,101
in her total lack
of empathy for my pain.

431
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,103
Thankfully I only had to spend
the next eight hours

432
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,771
of my journey with her,

433
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,707
and then I'd get
a new stewardess,

434
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,875
and then another stewardess,
and then another.

435
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,677
In fact, I might have set

436
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,579
a connecting
flight record to Somalia,

437
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,015
but see, this was all part
of my master plan,

438
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,751
a fixed budget that would
allow me to write my book,

439
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,453
and unlike several
of my predecessors

440
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,455
who ventured to
where that flag is,

441
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,558
I'd say alive, as kidnapping
and killing journalists

442
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,926
had become an
unfortunate trend here.

443
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,696
Dude.

444
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,040
Fuck! Stop!

445
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:33,878
Stop the fucking--Seymour?

446
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Tracy?

447
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:37,615
I thought you were
repulsed by older men!

448
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,954
- Please calm down!
- Make out with me!

449
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:48,726
Make out with me now!
Ahh!

450
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,594
Believe it or not,
that is what I consider

451
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,996
a mild Tracy nightmare.

452
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:55,733
Sorry, sorry, man.

453
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,668
In order to
clear my mind of its negativity,

454
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,970
I'll take a moment now to focus
on the less fortunate

455
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:04,608
than myself,
the people of Somalia.

456
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,112
Hard to believe this land was
once known as a nation of poets.

457
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,614
Throughout their history,
the Somali poet was counted on

458
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,683
to defend a clan's honor.

459
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,485
They used poems of persuasion

460
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:17,154
in lieu of weapons
to settle disputes,

461
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,458
but in the 20th century
times changed.

462
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,826
Both the English
and the Italians

463
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,128
attempted to colonize them.

464
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,130
They introduced guns
into battle,

465
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,233
and although Somalia
valiantly refused to succumb,

466
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:32,870
the scars of war never relented.

467
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:35,873
Somalia's recent civil war
had caused over a million people

468
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,043
to flee to neighboring
countries as refuges.

469
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:43,247
Those who stayed faced droughts,
floods, famine,

470
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:46,250
feuding clan battles, and jihad.

471
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:49,487
Their newly-elected President
Farole had his hands full,

472
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:53,090
especially when you threw
in the pirates.

473
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,693
I arrived at my destination
city of Galkayo,

474
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,095
and into the fire I plunged,

475
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:02,733
or as my Somali translation
book said, "Dabka."

476
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,777
Holy fuck.

477
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,715
- Mr. Bahadur? Mr. Bahadur.
- Hi.

478
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,783
- Hi, welcome to Galkayo.
- Oh, thank you.

479
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,853
- Yes. I am Abdirizak.
You call me Abdi.

480
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,255
I am your translator.

481
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,623
- Cool. Good to meet you.

482
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,024
- Good to meet you, yes.

483
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,561
How was your flight?
- It was good.

484
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:34,164
- That's good. Oh, please don't
do the--with your finger here.

485
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,766
- This?
- Yes. Oh, please--

486
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,601
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

487
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,036
I'm--I'm so sorry. I--

488
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,804
- It's offensive.

489
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:41,972
- I'll keep the thumbs in
check. Thank you.

490
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,707
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

491
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,943
Your English is great.
- It's not perfect.

492
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:49,680
I try to learn from you
during your stay, Mr. Bahadur.

493
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:52,049
- Oh, please call me Jay.
- Jay?

494
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,617
- Yeah, Jay.

495
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,920
- Jay, you have one bag?
- Yeah, one bag.

496
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,856
- Oh, you're like Obama,
a man that knows what he wants.

497
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,658
- You know Obama?

498
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,293
- Of course. He will be great
leader for your people.

499
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,862
- Oh, I'm Canadian.
He's--he's not my leader.

500
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,297
- Of course he is.

501
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,033
Your people just don't know it.
Come.

502
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:16,206
♪

503
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:25,583
♪

504
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,855
So I hear you are
an author and journalist.

505
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:35,693
- Yes.
- Good, good.

506
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,696
There is so much to write
about in this country.

507
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,164
What is your subject?

508
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,665
- In a perfect world
I'd be writing

509
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,601
about your newfound democracy,

510
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,369
but, um, given the fact

511
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:49,239
that the West has broken off
all relations with you, um,

512
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,308
I'm here to write
about your pirates.

513
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,646
- You mean badaadinta badah?
- Bada-binda-bada? What is that?

514
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:59,116
- It means saviors of the sea.
They are like Coast Guard.

515
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,318
You can never call them pirates.

516
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,287
- Okay. That's good to know.

517
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:08,092
- They have very strong opinion
on this, never pirates.

518
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:10,928
- Are they easy to find?
- Yes, of course.

519
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,098
They are people
with crazy money.

520
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,633
- So they walk freely?

521
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,235
- Yes, but our new
President Farole

522
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,170
has promised to change this.

523
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,207
He is a very tough man
who will bring much change.

524
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:26,844
Ah!

525
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,817
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, yes.

526
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,286
It's okay?

527
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,823
- Yes, yes.

528
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,426
Sometimes I feel like father
with little children.

529
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,228
They need khat.

530
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,031
- Khat.
- Yes. We must stop up here.

531
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,074
- In Somalia one hour
and already shooting

532
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,309
my first drug deal,

533
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:02,880
my kind of country.

534
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:06,083
So khat is a drug?

535
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:10,320
- Yes, it's--it's a stimulant
leaf from Kenya and Ethiopia.

536
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:15,693
It's very addictive,
big problem here.

537
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:20,397
What's he saying?

538
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,233
- He wants to know
if you want to buy some.

539
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,070
- Oh, no, I--I--sorry,

540
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,005
I'm on a very fixed budget.

541
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,040
I didn't account for drug
money. I don't have any--

542
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,321
He wants you to try it.

543
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:48,192
- It won't kill you.
Yes, just bite down.

544
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,294
- What's the effects?

545
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:52,496
- Makes some people
want to have sex,

546
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:55,899
others very talkative.

547
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,871
- Ugh! Tracy was a great girl,

548
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,039
but, you know, she--what--what
are you gonna do?

549
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,440
She moves on. I move on.

550
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,242
I really doubt we'll ever
even talk again.

551
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,977
I mean, why bother, right?
Seems like a waste of time.

552
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,345
I mean, it's just gonna
confuse thing and make it

553
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,780
more difficult.
- Men and women

554
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:11,515
can't be friends.
- Exactly!

555
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,016
Exactly, that's
the same over here?

556
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,452
- Yes, it's a universal thought.

557
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,354
- See, where I come
from, they debate it.

558
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,523
They debate it like
morons, like idiots.

559
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:23,393
- It's not a debate. It's fact.
We're reaching a checkpoint.

560
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,362
Please stay calm.

561
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,892
- Ah, Mr. Bahadur..

562
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,360
- Hi.
- So we finally meet

563
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,295
face to face, huh?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

564
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,932
- Nice to meet you, sir. Abdi.

565
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,535
You are younger than
I pictured, somewhat.

566
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:06,537
- Ah.
- Western reporters to me

567
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:10,040
are always so fucking unhappy.

568
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:14,077
- Well, I get even better
once I shower.

569
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,346
- Come on, come on.
Has Abdi been good to you?

570
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,248
- Yes, mad good, yeah.

571
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,851
- He's the best translator
in all of Puntland, you know?

572
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,252
- Oh, no, really?
- Yeah.

573
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,921
We stole him from the pirates.

574
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:27,090
- Oh, you mean, uh,
badaadinta badah?

575
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,392
- Abdi, did you teach him this?

576
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,027
- Ah--
- This is not

577
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,062
our Coast Guard, Abdi,
they are pirates!

578
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:35,165
You must forget
the old guard's thinking.

579
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,867
They are pirates!

580
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:41,038
- Pirates.

581
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,606
- Mr. Jay.
- Hi.

582
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,275
- So what do you think of
the Radio Garowe newsroom?

583
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,977
- Nice.

584
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,413
- Does it look like
the ones in Canada?

585
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:50,848
- Yes.

586
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,249
Yes, it does, a bit, yeah.

587
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,984
- It's amazing, huh?

588
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,886
- Is it a local station or, um--
- Oh, one minute.

589
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:58,388
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah, mostly it's local,

590
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,123
but, you know,
the guy is very famous.

591
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,159
He used to work for--
- This guy, famous?

592
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,464
That was my father's office.
He wants to meet us now.

593
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,233
- Your father?
The--the president?

594
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,469
- Yeah, we must go now.

595
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,471
- Fuck.

596
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:18,141
- Pirates are not the most
cooperative group to deal with.

597
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:22,079
- Mm-hmm.
- Look here.

598
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:25,549
The main pirates' clan
are dotted around here.

599
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,151
- Eyl.
- You know Eyl?

600
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,953
- Yeah, that's where
they took the Farhina

601
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,622
and held it for six months.

602
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:34,992
- Precisely. Eyl is a fishing
town where they started.

603
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:38,428
I'm working on getting you
a meeting with Boyah.

604
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,331
- Boyah?
- Yes, he's a man Somali

605
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,333
calls Robin Hood.

606
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:49,439
- Robin Hood of the pirates?
- But it could take some time.

607
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:55,245
- How much time?
- Days, maybe weeks.

608
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,481
Is that a problem?

609
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,182
- No. No, no, that's fine.
- No?

610
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,584
- That's totally fine, yeah.
- Yeah?

611
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

612
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:03,654
- Yeah, I'll just--I'll call
my publisher

613
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:07,224
and make sure it's all set,

614
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,092
finances,
extending it, and everything.

615
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,515
- My father just got in here
a couple weeks ago.

616
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:35,719
The transition of government
was entirely peaceful.

617
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,570
This is the reporter,
Jay Bahadur.

618
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,639
- It's an honor to meet you,
Your Excellency.

619
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,474
- Welcome, Mr. Bahadur.

620
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:01,011
So my son tells me you're
the next Mr. Bob Woodward.

621
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,747
- I'm not so sure about that.
- Why aren't you sure?

622
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,415
You have made it farther
into Somalia

623
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,484
than any of
your Western counterparts.

624
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:11,088
- With all due respect, uh,
I've always considered myself

625
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,390
more of a Bernstein
than a Woodward.

626
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,726
Bernstein was ugly as hell
and never got through college.

627
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:19,563
Overcame his shortcomings.
Uh, I find that admirable.

628
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,766
- He's a funny guy.
- Very funny.

629
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,768
- I would like to introduce you
to Colonel Omar,

630
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:30,574
who'll be the head of your
security team during your stay.

631
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:33,510
- Welcome.
- Pleasure to meet you, Colonel.

632
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,112
- I'll protect you well,
Mr. Bahadur.

633
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:39,282
You're welcome.

634
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:44,721
- You have learned some Somali?
- Enough to be a bad tourist.

635
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:47,457
Um, is this okay?

636
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,493
- Of course.
That's why you're here.

637
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:53,030
My family and I spent our last
eight years in Australia--

638
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:56,233
- Is there a reason the six
pack paisley napk--are--

639
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,135
- And we--
- Not here?

640
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,537
Sorry. I'm so sorry,
Your Excellency. I'm just, uh--

641
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,305
I think because
it was just--

642
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,740
Trying to get this dang
thing working here.

643
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:07,644
Festive--festive--

644
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,383
Good to go.

645
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:17,220
- The people of Somalia asked me
to come back here

646
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,357
and to run for this office.

647
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,294
I never saw myself
being the president.

648
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,796
I am a businessman.

649
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,298
I am not a warrior
like my predecessors,

650
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,834
but here I am,
fighting to bring justice

651
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:34,438
to those who destroy
our country.

652
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,341
Have you seen a school since
you've come here, Mr. Bahadur?

653
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,510
- Uh, no, I must
admit I haven't.

654
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,647
- We have the fewest schools
in the African nations.

655
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:49,352
Do you know how hard it is
to rule here with a PhD

656
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:54,658
knowing the children I lead
have no chance for an education?

657
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,695
Their role models
of success are pirates.

658
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:02,532
The Western world thinks
we encourage this.

659
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:07,204
This must change.

660
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,873
Do you have a title yet?

661
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,508
- A title?

662
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,743
- For your future
bestselling book.

663
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:17,481
- Oh. Um, yes, of course.

664
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:22,385
Um, "Pirates."

665
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,321
- That's shit title.

666
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:26,823
Just "Pirates?"

667
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:32,529
- "Pirates of Somalia."
- Be more creative.

668
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:33,697
Be more creative.
- Creative?

669
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,398
- Yeah.
- Creative.

670
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,338
- Creative
- Yes, creative, you're right.

671
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,141
- Jay, you know,
my father likes you.

672
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,743
- What, you think so?
- Yes, yes.

673
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,378
- All right.

674
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,215
- He knows you will bring
great things here.

675
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:56,186
- What if I don't?

676
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,456
- How can you not when people
read your bestseller?

677
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,358
- Ohh.

678
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,194
- Abdi, have you
found Boyah yet?

679
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:06,930
- Mm.
- Oh, you must be patient, man.

680
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,932
- Yeah.
- He will show up.

681
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:13,436
They're gonna take you
to your accommodations.

682
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,706
- Wow. Thank you, uh,
so much for everything.

683
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,909
- That's the beginning
of a better Somalia, Jay.

684
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:21,545
- Yes, I certainly hope so.

856
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,288
- Great.
- Jay Bahadur, now you know.

857
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,990
Mm.

858
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:02,705
- CBC, Avril Benoit's office.
- Hi, this is Jay Bahadur.

859
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:04,173
I'm calling for Ms. Benoit.

860
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:06,008
I believe she's expecting
my call.

861
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,244
- One moment, please.

862
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:10,413
Avril, I have a Jay Bahadur
on the line.

863
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:12,648
He says you're
expecting his call.

864
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,953
- I don't know a Jay Bahadur.
- Okay.

865
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:19,055
I'm sorry, she can't be
reached at the moment.

866
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,223
Uh, can she return, Mr. Bahadur?

867
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:24,427
- No, it'd be impossible
to return. I need to talk now.

868
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,262
It's critical.

869
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:29,031
- Well, unfortunately,
she's unavailable.

870
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,100
- No! Please, uh--

871
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,436
What's your name?
- Beth.

872
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:36,372
- Beth, hey, Beth.

873
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:39,375
Um, there's gonna be a moment

874
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:42,678
when you're not on
that desk screening calls,

875
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,181
and you're gonna need a break,
a single tiny break

876
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:47,616
from the assistant
on the other end,

877
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,152
and that karma
is gonna be paid off

878
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:54,590
by giving me a break
in this very moment.

879
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:57,560
- You think it gets me a raise?
- Definitely.

880
00:49:57,562 --> 00:50:02,365
Just tell her
that I'm in Somalia.

881
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:06,369
- Okay, fine. You win.

882
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:09,205
Jay Bahadur says
he's calling from Somalia.

883
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:12,108
- Oh, shit.
Jesus, yeah, I'll take it.

884
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,509
Hello, this is Avril Benoit.

885
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,178
- Hi, Ms. Benoit.
This is Jay Bahadur.

886
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,147
I believe Seymour
told you about me.

887
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,616
- Yes, yes. Are you really
calling from Somalia?

888
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:23,252
- Yes, I'm in Garowe,
all limbs intact.

889
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:24,553
- Jesus.
- Look, I sent you

890
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:26,522
a proposal, uh,
regarding a book

891
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,324
I'm writing on the pirates.

892
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:30,292
I don't know if you had
a chance to review it.

893
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:33,162
- I'm gonna be honest
with you, Jay, I haven't.

894
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:34,663
Are you really there?

895
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:37,066
- Yes, yes, I am.

896
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:40,603
Um, I'm being hosted
by President Farole's son.

897
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:42,471
- Christ, this is unreal.

898
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:45,574
No one's in there,
CNN, BBC, no one.

899
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,276
- Yeah, I know.

900
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,646
- Oh, shit.

901
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:52,381
- What the fuck was that?

902
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,283
- Ten minutes,
my--my phone card's out.

903
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:57,219
I--I'm--I'm tagging along

904
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,688
with a pirate the locals
claim is like Robin Hood.

905
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,557
He runs this huge
operation out of Eyl.

906
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,326
It is my hope that I can be
a stringer with you,

907
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:06,595
and if you really see
something in the pages,

908
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:08,631
you could help me
get a book deal.

909
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:10,833
Will--will you read my pages?

910
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,768
- Yes.
- Yes!

911
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,603
Thank you. Thank you so much.

912
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,439
Uh, I'm a huge fan, by--

913
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:20,376
- He said he was a lobster
diver from Eyl.

914
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:29,418
- The Westerners come,
Chinese, the Koreans.

915
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:34,557
- Jay! Gabar!

916
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,429
- You're a good wingman, Asad.

917
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:45,134
Nice! Nice, buddy. Yes!

918
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:48,237
What?

919
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:50,506
What does that mean?

920
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:55,411
Keep your eyes on her, man.

921
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,282
Go, baby, go, baby, go.
Go, baby, go.

922
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,890
- You took the chair.

923
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,493
You took the chair.
You took the chair.

It is a merely mathematical

Assalamu alaikum Jay.

934
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:39,882
- Assalamu alaikum, Maryan.

935
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:46,555
- Yes, I see you in the window.
- You speak English.

936
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:50,359
- A little.
- Where did you learn?

937
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:53,495
- I watch a lot
of American movies.

938
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,297
- Movies?

939
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:59,702
- Yeah. I love.
- That makes two of us.

940
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,337
- Yes?
- Yeah.

941
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:03,505
Uh, got movie posters
all over my room.

942
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:04,807
What's your favorite movie?

943
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,910
- I like "G.I. Jane."
- Really?

944
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:13,282
- Yeah. I like Demi Moore.
She's a very tough woman.

945
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:15,451
- Yeah, especially
with that buzz cut.

946
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,353
It's super butch.

947
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,488
I'm sure Demi Moore
would be honored, though,

948
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,391
to have a Somali fan club.

949
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:27,429
- The movie I think is
very wrong is "Black Hawk Down."

950
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,532
- Because, uh, it's about
what went down in Mogadishu?

951
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:34,703
- No, because it's about
our people,

952
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:39,842
and they do not use a single
person from Somalia in it.

953
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:42,578
It is wrong.

954
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,749
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

955
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:49,818
"Derka derka Mohammed jihad,"

956
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,323
That's what they were doing
the whole pathetic film.

957
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:57,559
- You just did "Team America."
That's crazy. Wow.

958
00:54:57,561 --> 00:55:01,497
- Yes, "Team America"
said many smart things.

959
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:04,600
- This conversation
is getting surreal.

960
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:07,536
- You know this city
talks about you?

961
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,872
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

962
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,907
- What are they saying?

963
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:15,577
- They're saying you're here
to expose the truth

964
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:18,981
about the badaadinta badah.

965
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:20,382
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

966
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:23,552
- Well, I mean, I am trying,

967
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:28,524
but, uh,
what do you think about them?

968
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:31,093
- I'm not the person to ask.

969
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:33,595
I'm married to one.

970
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:36,432
- Garaad.
- So you know?

971
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:39,034
- I know, yeah.
He's a very powerful man.

972
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,736
I'm trying to meet him.

973
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:44,907
- Yeah, you and I
both want that meeting.

974
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,676
- You don't see him much?

975
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,979
- Not since I married him, no.

976
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,781
- Well, you'd be
a better treasure

977
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,384
than anything he'd find
on one of those ships.

978
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:58,354
- That's an American movie line.

979
00:55:58,356 --> 00:55:59,355
- Yes.

980
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:01,523
Maybe. I don't know.

981
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,459
But it's good though, right?

982
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:07,529
And true.

983
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:11,066
- You here for khat, yes?
- Yeah.

984
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:15,404
- So how much do you want?
- Uh, I don't know.

985
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:17,973
You--you take
foreign money, right?

986
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,608
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

987
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,877
Okay. Uh, how much
will this get me?

988
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:28,050
- Wow, enough to make you crazy.

989
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,819
- Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

990
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:35,457
- Jay.

991
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:37,493
- I think it's time
to see Boyah again.

992
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:39,461
- Is that khat?
- No, it's spinach.

993
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:40,963
Yes, it's khat.

994
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:06,789
- So tell me, Boyah,
how do you attack?

995
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:12,194
- We attack in small groups.

996
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:17,499
- And we circle them
like wolves.

- Okay, um, did you get

1014

- Yeah, uh, unfortunately
not everyone here

1015
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:36,939
is sharing the enthusiasm
I've got for them.

1016
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:42,945
- Did you say "unfortunately?"
- Yes.

1017
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:45,047
- Shit.

1018
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:49,751
- My colleagues feel that
as a book it's missing a hook.

1019
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,587
- A hook?

1020
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:53,822
Boyah's Captain fucking Hook
minus the eye patch.

1021
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,958
- I know. I'm--I'm as
shocked as you are.

1022
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,860
The material you're getting
is incredible.

1023
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:00,896
I--I didn't see this coming.

1024
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:04,232
Look, the three top-selling
books this year are "Twilight,"

1025
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:08,904
"New Moon," and "Breaking Dawn,"
so don't take it personal.

1026
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:10,706
We're all up
against vampires, okay?

1027
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:13,008
- Personal? Avril, these people
are desperate!

1028
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,177
No one is willing to listen
to what they have to say!

1029
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:17,913
- I'm sorry, Jay. I really am.

1030
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:20,983
Just know that
I'm on your side, okay?

1031
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:24,653
- Okay.
- Are you okay?

1032
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:26,655
- Yeah.

1033
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:28,724
- Look, I don't--I don't know
if you'd be interested,

1034
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:32,027
but I've heard that
CBS is willing to pay $1,000

1035
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:34,730
for any video of hostages
on the ships.

1036
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:36,098
- Is this your way of saying
it's a dead end

1037
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,167
with your contacts?
- No.

1038
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:43,972
I know it's crazy
and borderline sensationalism,

1039
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,141
but it can really
get you out there.

1040
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,310
It could help sell this book.

1041
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,812
Plus I know money
must be tight for you right now.

1042
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,147
I've been there.

1043
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:56,952
- Right.
- Just keep at it, Jay.

1044
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,688
I'm gonna continue
to push for you on this end.

1045
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,890
There's a book here.

1046
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:04,960
- Okay. Okay, thanks, Avril.

1047
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:07,663
- One more little
piece of advice,

1048
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,766
you might want to organize
your cards a little better.

1049
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:12,901
It's a pet peeve of mine.

1050
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:18,040
I just--I find it makes your
flow of thoughts more concise.

1051
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:31,353
- Fuck! Fuck!

1052
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:34,956
Fucking fuck!

1053
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,960
Hey, bro, uh--

1054
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,762
- Jay.
- Can we talk?

1055
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:42,097
- Now?
- Yeah.

1056
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,332
- Come.
- Thanks.

1057
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:46,201
Thanks, man. How you doing?
Sorry to wake you up, man.

1058
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:50,906
I'm just having a hard time,
man, you know?

1059
01:01:50,908 --> 01:01:52,908
I trust you, man.

1060
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,810
- Thank you.
- No, I mean that, you know?

1061
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:57,045
Like, I really--I really trust
you because, you know,

1062
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,447
I don't really have
many people that I trust,

1063
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:00,749
and you're, like,
one of those people, so.

1064
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:02,417
- Is there something
troubling you, bro?

1065
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:04,052
- Don't call me bro, please.

1066
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,921
Call me Jay.

1067
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,355
If you still want to call me bro
after I finish telling you

1068
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:10,459
what I'm telling you,
then that's fine.

1069
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:11,927
- Okay.
- What I say has to stay

1070
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:13,462
between us, I mean it.

1071
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:16,398
- Okay.
- Okay.

1072
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,468
Um, all right,

1073
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:26,241
Uh--

1074
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,777
I'm not a famous journalist,

1075
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:32,814
and I don't have a book deal.

1076
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:36,785
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

1077
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,954
Everyone here thinks
I'm a famous reporter.

1078
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:44,826
That's why I'm here,
but I'm a fucking no one.

1079
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:47,796
- Jay...

1080
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:52,033
you are the only reporter

1081
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:54,202
willing to risk their life

1082
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:57,472
to show the struggle
of Somali people.

1083
01:02:57,474 --> 01:03:00,976
- Yes, yes, I know,
but you're missing the point.

1084
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:04,479
I'm not a reporter, okay?

1085
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,081
I thought I could come here

1086
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,050
and get a book deal
or publish some stuff

1087
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:11,987
once I sent some pages
to editors,

1088
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,789
but they rejected me, man.

1089
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,056
They fucking rejected me
like every other

1090
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:18,126
piece of shit
I've written! Fuck!

1091
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,961
Sorry. Sorry.

1092
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,964
- They rejected your work?
- Yeah.

1093
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,866
If Farole finds out,
I'm fucking dead.

1094
01:03:24,868 --> 01:03:26,535
I'm dead. He's gonna kill me.

1095
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:30,038
- Perhaps yes, perhaps no.
He understands rejection.

1096
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,439
It's a human trait.

1097
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:34,242
- I shouldn't have
come here, man.

1098
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:36,344
I'm a fucking idiot.

1099
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,847
- Don't say that, Jay.
Don't say that.

1100
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:41,049
You had no choice.
- Yeah.

1101
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:42,551
I came here with the noble idea

1102
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:44,186
of exposing the truth,

1103
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:49,291
and I lied
to everyone around me.

1104
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:51,393
- You wake me in the middle
of the night to tell me this?

1105
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:59,234
- I came here
to ask you a favor.

1106
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:02,437
- Ask me.
- Yeah, okay.

1107
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:09,010
I need you to help me get on
a ship and film some hostages.

1108
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,479
- Jay, that is not wise.
- I know it's not wise.

1109
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:15,517
I know that, but, you know, this
is the only way that people out

1110
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:20,021
there are gonna give a fuck
about what is going on here.

1111
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,256
It's the only way.

1112
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:22,991
- I don't believe that.

1113
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:24,860
- Dude, CBS is willing
to pay $1,000, okay?

1114
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,595
I'll split it with you
if you can get me on a ship.

1115
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:29,531
I'll split it with you.
That's $500, American dollars.

1116
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,600
That's fucking great money, man.

1117
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:35,170
- Jay, it's not about money.

1118
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:38,106
Once you're on the ship,
we cannot protect you.

1119
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:40,141
The president
won't even allow this.

1120
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:42,577
- It's CBS.
It's the biggest network.

1121
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,179
- Yes, and your being

1122
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:46,448
a famous reporter
getting killed,

1123
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:49,317
that would seal the fate
for Somali people as terrorists.

1124
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,887
- And I'm not famous.
- Jay, you will be.

1125
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:54,189
- Abdi, they're not
publishing my words,

1126
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:56,124
not a single fucking one!

1127
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:58,393
Nobody gives a flying
fuck about Boyah,

1128
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,996
the struggling fisherman
turned Robin Hood pirate!

1129
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:02,664
They don't fucking care, man!

1130
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:05,667
- Do you know Somali clans
used to fight with words

1131
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:07,402
rather than weapons?

1132
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,037
- I knew that, yes.
I did a paper on that.

1133
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,440
- So you know our
great freedom fighter,

1134
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:15,143
the poet warrior Mohammed
Abdullah Hassan, Sayyidka?

1135
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,645
- The English called him
Mad Mullah.

1136
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:18,680
- Ah, you know of him.

1137
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:21,583
- Yes, I do, and I also know
that iambic pentameter

1138
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:24,152
is not gonna solve
this problem, man.

1139
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:26,454
I got to get on a fucking ship.

1140
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:28,223
- I will do something better.
- Better?

1141
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:30,191
What the fuck--what's
better than that?

1142
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:35,196
- I was working to get you
in a meeting with the Garaad.

1143
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:36,531
- The Garaad?
- Yes.

1144
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:38,500
- The godfather of pirates?

1145
01:05:38,502 --> 01:05:42,270
- The man you want to have
crazy sex with his wife.

1146
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,139
- What makes you say that?

1147
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:47,208
- You don't think all
of Garowe know this?

1148
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,643
- Does Garaad?

1149
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:51,313
- If he know,
you wouldn't be here.

1150
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:52,514
- That's comforting.

1151
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:54,683
- He wants me as a translator,

1152
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:58,019
so perhaps I trade
for the possibility of him

1153
01:05:58,021 --> 01:05:59,454
and you in a room.

1154
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,689
- Then you're putting
yourself in danger.

1155
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:02,090
That's--I don't like that.

1156
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:05,093
- No, no, no, no, mm-mm.

1157
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:08,263
That's nonsense, Jay.

1158
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:09,497
- Why you helping me like this?

1159
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,166
Why you doing that?

1160
01:06:11,168 --> 01:06:13,969
- You are my bro.

1161
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:16,004
I have to help you.

1162
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:17,105
- Thanks, man.
- Okay?

1163
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:18,740
- Thank you.

1164
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:21,543
- You're my bro, Jay.
- Whew, yeah.

1165
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:24,612
- Don't worry, okay?
- Okay. We're good.

1166
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:28,249
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
Have a good night.

1167
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:32,420
- Edgar Allen Poe, Oscar Wilde,
Herman Melville, H.P. Lovecraft

1168
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:34,990
all had one thing in common.

1169
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:39,060
They died broke,
completely penniless,

1170
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:41,162
so I got to blame
President Farole

1171
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,665
a little bit for not asking
for all his money up front.

1172
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,034
After all, I am a writer,
not an accountant, right?

1173
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:47,435
Rule number one in life, Asad,

1174
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:50,238
don't blow all
your money on drugs,

1175
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,508
unless it's definitely gonna
lead to some serious ass

1176
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,344
or a Pulitzer Prize.

1177
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:59,714
This might not lead to either,
but I'd rather die trying.

1178
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:07,389
What are you working on?
That me?

1179
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,657
- Yes.

1180
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:16,765
- That's going up
on the board, buddy.

1181
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:20,268
Nice. Wish me luck.

1182
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:33,515
♪

1183
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,518
- Good morning, Maryan.

1184
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,219
- Morning, Jay.

1185
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:43,058
- Could I have 1 kilo
of your best khat?

1186
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:47,228
- Best?
- Yes.

1187
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,565
- So what is
the special occasion?

1188
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:55,703
- Um, I'm going to meet
your husband in Bosaso.

1189
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:59,841
- So this khat is intended
for my husband?

1190
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:03,478
- Yes.

1191
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,749
- Okay.
- Is that a problem?

1192
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,717
- No.
- No?

1193
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:11,853
- No.

- Yeah.

1197
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:25,700
- Well, I haven't
seen him in months.

1198
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:28,636
- Oh. Nothing?

1199
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:31,306
Even a little tidbit,
anything? Like--

1200
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:34,809
- Compliment his clothes.
- His clothes?

1201
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:36,444
- Yeah.

1202
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:40,415
He's proud of how he dresses.
- Oh.

1203
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:46,855
Yes, okay, I'll do that.

1204
01:08:46,857 --> 01:08:51,726
Um, what do you think
of my clothes?

1205
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:56,231
- They are terribly bland.
- Oh, yeah?

1206
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:58,199

1207
01:08:58,201 --> 01:09:00,335
- Maybe you could take me
shopping later.

1208
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:03,438

you buy this khat from.

1244
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:03,891
- Where?
- Where.

1245
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:05,893
- In the market in Garowe.

1246
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,639
- He thought so. You got it
from one of his close dealers,

1247
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:21,576
so now he doesn't want
to waste a bullet in you.

1248
01:11:21,578 --> 01:11:27,382
- Good.
Thank you for not killing me.

1249

Uh, don't tell him that.

So, uh, tell me about yourself,
Garaad. Is this okay?

1251

Yes, yes.

1252
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:47,635
- He have more
than 800 hijackers.

1253
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:55,076
- That is spread
from Bosaso to Eyl.

1254
01:11:55,078 --> 01:11:57,345
- That is a lot.
Very impressive.

1255

Very impressive.

1256
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:03,551

who's sort of a--

1258

I understand you're a very
different man from him,

1262
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,634
and I was just wondering if you

1263
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:21,402
could maybe elaborate on that.

1264
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:38,019
- With his group,
it's a must to destroy anyone

1265
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:41,022
and everyone that's
doing illegal fishing.

1266
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:44,792
- Is it fair to say
that any ship

1267
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:46,594
that is traveling your waters,

1268
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:50,698
be it fishing, cargo,

1269
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:57,071
yacht, that ship is fair game
for your organization to take?

1270
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:11,052
- It doesn't matter
who they are.

1271
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:14,922
- They are doing
something wrong.

1272
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:19,627
They should be punished.

1273
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:23,498
And we will keep going
till our seas are cleansed

1274
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,600
of illegal fishing vessels.

1275
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:27,635

- Gather your things.

We're going to Eyl.

- Eyl?
- Yes.

1281
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:45,086
- Um, I got to get this Garaad
interview out, buddy.

1282
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:46,888
- The ship will not
wait for you.

1283
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,523
- A ship?
- Yes.

1284
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:49,857
There is a German freighter
called Victoria

1285
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:51,559
being held in the harbor.

1286
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:53,494
The pirate in charge
is a friend of Colonel Omar.

1287
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:54,495

wait, wait, wait, wait.

- You want to be on the ship?

1290
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:00,535
- Yeah.
- Because I had to fight

1293

- Dude, I thought you were
against me getting on a ship.

1294
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:08,810
- I am.
Farole tell me to collect $500

1295

from you for costs
before you leave.

1296

in that spot, but--

1302

- Yeah, you spent it
on pirate drugs.

1303
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,960
- Yeah, the pirates don't,

without the drug.

01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:57,858
- That ship is
the last one here.

1362
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,962
Everyone in Eyl
will be happy to see them go.

1363
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:03,798
- Do you think they'll
be leaving soon?

1364
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,834
- That's what we have heard,
so they will leave soon.

1365
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:08,903
- Okay.
- Mr. Bahadur's book

1366
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:11,105
is going to shed
new lights on Somalia.

1367
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:13,440
- Hmm.
- And so the president is very,

1368
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:15,442
very excited, real excited.

1369
01:20:15,444 --> 01:20:17,011
- Oh? Oh.

1370
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:20,915
- Have you read any of it,
Colonel Omar?

1371
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:25,152
- No, actually, but I trust
it will be good, very good.

1372
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,922
Won't it, Mr. Bahadur?

1373
01:20:27,924 --> 01:20:31,926
- Yes. It's exciting,
a very exciting story

1374
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:35,062
and--and very informative,
lot of different levels.

1375
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:37,331
It's--it's--very exciting.

1376
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,899
- Mr. Bahadur,

1377
01:20:38,901 --> 01:20:42,570
I'm a spokesperson
for the women of Eyl.

1378
01:20:42,572 --> 01:20:44,438
Our children need education.

1379
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,341
Our schools have been lost,

1380
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:51,612
never rebuilded
after the tsunami.

1381
01:20:51,614 --> 01:20:55,549
Will your book talk of this?

1382
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:57,351
- Yes.
- Good.

1383
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,287
Thank you. Good.

1384
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:08,195
- What is the name of your book?

1385
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,297
- I'm still working on it,

1386
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:12,266
still trying to figure that out.
- Oh.

1387
01:21:12,268 --> 01:21:16,503
- Jay is
perfectionist with his words.

1388
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:18,405
- Oh. We will see.

1389
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:21,175
- I am Reer Jarfale,
son of Levish.

1390
01:21:21,177 --> 01:21:23,077
- Reer Jarfale!

1391
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:26,914
- Reer Jarfale!

1392
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,556
- You might want to
save your battery.

1393
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:40,928
- Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

1394
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,529
You think I'll get on?

1395
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:47,601
- The man in charge of the
operation is named Computer.

1396
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:50,204
They say he is psychic.

1397
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:55,109
- Psychic? Is that good or bad?

1398
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:04,351
- The colonel's contact on
the ship thinks it will happen.

1399
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:07,988
- All right.

1400
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:11,558
I am scared, Abdi.

1401
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,663
Shit, man, I mean,
there's no other way.

1402
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:18,265
I hope you understand that.

1403
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:22,169
- This is the path
you choose as a man.

1404
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:28,042
It's not for me to understand.

1405
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:30,210
I am going to sleep now.

1406
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:33,013
- All right. Good night, buddy.

1407
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,687
Fucking A.

1408
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,241
- You stay here, man.
I will do the talking.

1409
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:06,113
- Okay.
- Don't worry, brother.

1410
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:07,982
- Okay.
- We'll make this work.

1411
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:11,719
- Good. Good, thank you.

1412
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,347
- Okay.

1413
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:50,391
Is he saying no?

1414
01:23:50,393 --> 01:23:53,027
Fuck!

1415
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,698
I'm a journalist,
don't fucking shoot!

1416
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:00,100
I'm a journalist, it's okay!
Don't fucking shoot me!

1417
01:24:00,102 --> 01:24:01,635
Okay?

1418
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:03,337
The money is gonna come faster

1419
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:05,773
if you let me video
the hostages, all right?

1420
01:24:05,775 --> 01:24:07,708
Please don't shoot me.
Please don't shoot.

1421
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,577
Please don't sh--

1422
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:12,179
If you let me video,

1423
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:13,447
the world will see
you're serious.

1424
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:15,482
The world will see you
are serious,

1425
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:17,751
and the shippers
will settle. Okay?

1426
01:24:19,288 --> 01:24:20,287
- Tell your leader
Computer that.

1427
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:21,755
Tell him that! Please!

1428
01:24:21,757 --> 01:24:23,457
Please, okay?
It's true. It's true.

1429
01:24:23,459 --> 01:24:24,792
The money's gonna come
so much faster

1430
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:26,527
if you let me video, okay?

1431
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:30,097
All right? It's true, I
promise. I promise, okay?

1432
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,339
- I will talk to Computer.
What you say could make sense.

1433
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:40,774
- Good.
- Come back tomorrow for answer.

1434
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:42,376
- Okay. Okay, great.
- Go. Move.

1435
01:24:42,378 --> 01:24:43,610
- Thank you.

1436
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,619
Abdi, did you see that shit?

1437
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:53,787
- Oh, that was dangerous,
brother.

1438
01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:57,324
You didn't have to come out.

1439
01:24:57,326 --> 01:24:59,259
That was dangerous.

1440
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:03,097
- Fuck, dude. Oh, fuck.

1441
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:06,200
Whoo! That's what
I'm talking about, Omar!

1442
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:07,434
- What was that?

1443
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,802
- What do you mean
what was that?

1444
01:25:08,804 --> 01:25:10,504
- I told you not to
come down there!

1445
01:25:10,506 --> 01:25:12,439
- What was that?
You weren't gonna get me on.

1446
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:13,607
- Don't do this, man.
- You weren't gonna get me on.

1447
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,175
You weren't gonna get shit.

1448
01:25:15,177 --> 01:25:16,743
- When are you going
to listen, man?

1449
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:18,812
- I just got out there,
and I made it happen

1450
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:20,581
'cause that's what
I'm doing these days, baby!

1451
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:21,849
I'm making shit happen!
- You never listen, man!

1452
01:25:21,851 --> 01:25:23,717
Hey, hey, wake up, Mr. Bahadur.

1453
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:24,785
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
- What?

1454
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:26,220
- Wake up right now, man.

1455
01:25:26,222 --> 01:25:27,488
- We're in?
- Right now.

1456
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:30,290
- We're on. All right.

1457
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,733
It's gone.

1458
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:44,138
- Next time you follow
my orders, man.

1459
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:47,441
They thought you were CIA.

1460
01:25:47,443 --> 01:25:49,610
- You fucking serious? CIA?
- Yeah.

1461
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:51,211
- Me?
- Of course.

1462
01:25:51,213 --> 01:25:54,481
- Fuck! Fuck.

1463
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:07,594
♪

1464
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:18,906
Abdi, not now!

1465
01:26:18,908 --> 01:26:24,778
- He say he's your father.
He call my phone.

1466
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,180
- My father?

1467
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:27,614
- Yes.
- Really?

1468
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:29,816
He called my phone.

1469
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:35,956
- Hello? Dad?

1470
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:37,824
- Jesus, Jay, thank God
you're okay.

1471
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:39,760
We've been watching this whole
Captain Phillips

1472
01:26:39,762 --> 01:26:41,728
hostage thing on CNN.

1473
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,497
You've got to get
the hell out of there.

1474
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:45,465
- Dad, I'm fine.
What are you talking about?

1475
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:47,267
- Those pirates are crazy.

1476
01:26:47,269 --> 01:26:48,835
They're threatening
to kill Americans.

1477
01:26:48,837 --> 01:26:50,504
- Dad, I'm Canadian.

1478
01:26:50,506 --> 01:26:51,772
I thought at least
you would know that.

1479
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:53,507
- Not a time for joking, Jay.

1480
01:26:53,509 --> 01:26:55,542
We want you on
the next plane out.

1481
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:58,245
- Dad, I understand your
concern,

1482
01:26:58,247 --> 01:26:59,846
but it's gonna be okay.

1483
01:26:59,848 --> 01:27:01,715
It's not a big deal.

1484
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:03,450
- Jay, sweetheart, you need
to come home.

1485
01:27:03,452 --> 01:27:04,751
- Hi, Mom.

1486
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:06,753
I was just telling Dad I'm fine.

1487
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:09,423
- But we're watching CNN
right now, and it is not fine.

1488
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:13,594
- Mom, the media is probably
spinning some bullshit tale.

1489
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:15,529
I've heard nothing
about it here.

1490
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:17,531
- It must be the opium.

1491
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:19,399
He's probably become
one of those child soldiers.

1492
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:21,235
- You're going to kill
your mother, Jay,

1493
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:24,371
unless you say
you're going to come home.

1494
01:27:24,373 --> 01:27:27,975
- Okay, but I need money wired.

1495
01:27:27,977 --> 01:27:29,409
- Money?
- See?

1496
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,245
It's the opium, I told you.

1497
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:32,746
- Yeah, I didn't want to ask
you guys, but, you know,

1498
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:38,418
I'm really--I don't really
have a choice.

1499
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,687
Somalia's expensive. Who knew?

1500
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:48,629
- Reports are now three
U.S. Navy ships

1501
01:27:48,631 --> 01:27:51,531
are steaming toward
the Maersk Alabama.

1502
01:27:51,533 --> 01:27:54,868
Taken by pirates--

1503
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:57,537
- The destroyer,
the USS Bainbridge,

1504
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:59,539
is on the scene.

1505
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:01,475
- Apparently Captain Phillips,
the ship's captain,

1506
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:03,877
has been taken hostage
by the fleeing pirates

1507
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:05,545
in a covered lifeboat.

1508
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:11,618
- The pirates have been--

1509
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,553
The hostage standoff

1510
01:28:13,555 --> 01:28:15,922
ended today with the death
of the three pirates

1511
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:18,392
and the eventual release
of their hostage,

1512
01:28:18,394 --> 01:28:19,860
Captain Richard Phillips.

1513
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:21,595
- Somali pirates--
- Somali pirates

1514
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:23,630
throughout the country
reacted angrily,

1515
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:25,866
saying they will capture
and kill any foreigners

1516
01:28:25,868 --> 01:28:29,736
they find to avenge
their comrades' death.

1517
01:28:29,738 --> 01:28:33,774
- At this time no one is
taking credit for the operation.

1518
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:37,911
We will get answers soon because
my father is demanding it.

1519
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:42,082
- Mr. Farole, three pirates have
been killed by the Americans.

1520
01:28:42,084 --> 01:28:43,750
There is going to be revenge,

1521
01:28:43,752 --> 01:28:45,085
and it's too dangerous
for Mr. Bahadur

1522
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:46,820
to remain here in Garowe.

1523
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,955
- No, it's not.
I will keep a low profile.

1524
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:50,524
- Just like you did in Eyl?

1525
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:51,825
- Eyl was a mistake, okay?

1526
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:53,493
- You keep saying
it was a mistake.

1527
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,362
- I messed up.
I'm sorry about that.

1528
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:56,897
- It was a mistake.
- I was a little high strung.

1529
01:28:56,899 --> 01:28:58,865
- Don't be telling this.
You're staying here--

1530
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:00,033
- Okay, I have learned from it,
and I'm all good now.

1531
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:01,702
I'm not gonna do that again.

1532
01:29:01,704 --> 01:29:03,070
- Mr. Bahadur, I agree
with the Colonel, okay?

1533
01:29:03,072 --> 01:29:05,639
I think we have to
get you out of here.

1534
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:09,076
We do not need any harm coming
to you. Do you understand that?

1535
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:10,777
- I get that.
- Do you understand that?

1536
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:13,680
- Mr. Farole,
I understand that, okay?

1537
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,482
I understand your concern
for my safety.

1538

like you understand.

for my safety,

1540

but you need somebody here.

1541
01:29:19,888 --> 01:29:22,022

who's behind this, okay?

1542
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:23,757
I need to interview them.

1543

- No, no.

protecting me the whole time!

- Madness.

1547

Khat's eating his brain.
- Khat?

1548
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:35,969
- Khat is not eating
my fucking brain.

1549
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:37,771

- Mr. Bahadur, calm down!

1551
01:29:39,742 --> 01:29:41,708

somebody on his side!

1552
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,610
- Mr. Bahadur, this--this--
- He needs somebody on his side!

1553

this is not negotiable.

on my hands, okay?

- You did?

1569
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,492

- They think we're

- We have a meeting with Boyah,

1578

1579

And today it's very sad.

1591

All it's good for is a target
the size of a man's heart.

You shoot for
your lover's heart.

but all right.

who's getting married to
someone else.

1610

a waste of bullets.

01:41:36,224 --> 01:41:37,623
- I was messing
with you that day.

1703
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:39,492
- Six months?
You didn't tell me?

1704
01:41:39,494 --> 01:41:41,360
- The look on your face.

1705
01:41:41,362 --> 01:41:45,398
- I'm doing this forever.
- What this thing mean?

1706
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:49,102
- This means hope.
- Hope?

1707
01:41:49,104 --> 01:41:50,403
- Yes.

1708
01:41:50,405 --> 01:41:52,805
- Okay, I will spread
that message.

1709
01:41:52,807 --> 01:41:56,209
- Please do.
- Yes. Take care

1710
01:42:07,856 --> 01:42:11,858
- They say in Somalia,
every man is his own sultan.

1711
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:17,163
Then in my mind, Abdi was
a glorious kind among sultans.

1712
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:29,542
Upon landing back in the cell
zone known as Toronto, Canada,

1713
01:42:29,544 --> 01:42:32,712
I got 234 unopened
text messages.

1714
01:42:32,714 --> 01:42:35,181
165 were from news services

1715
01:42:35,183 --> 01:42:37,683
offering
to buy my Garaad interview.

1716
01:42:37,685 --> 01:42:41,521
Eight were from publishers
wanting to buy my book rights,

1717
01:42:41,523 --> 01:42:45,525
and four of them
were from Tracy.

1718
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:51,564
I decided if she really
wanted to know

1719
01:42:51,566 --> 01:42:54,300
what was going on in my life,

1720
01:42:54,302 --> 01:42:57,303
she could read about it.

1721
01:42:57,305 --> 01:42:59,539
- Excuse me.
Can I see your passport?

1722
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:02,208
- Passport?

1723
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:10,316
- Follow me, please.

1724
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:22,828
- Hello, Mr. Bahadur.
- Hello.

1725
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,298
- My name's Agent Brice.
I'm with CSIS.

1726
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:29,936
- Okay. Uh, is--am I in
some sort of trouble?

1727
01:43:29,938 --> 01:43:31,904
- Quite the opposite.

1728
01:43:31,906 --> 01:43:34,640
We're very anxious to learn
if you could give us any insight

1729
01:43:34,642 --> 01:43:39,378
that you may have gained
while in Somalia.

1730
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:42,315
- Wait, you want me
to give you insight?

1731
01:43:42,317 --> 01:43:45,551
- Look, uh, both the U.S.
and the Canadian intelligence

1732
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:49,789
are basically flying blind
in the region,

1733
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:53,226
so we could use some help.

1734
01:43:53,228 --> 01:43:55,361
- Oh, my God.

1735
01:43:55,363 --> 01:43:58,698
Wow. Okay.

1736
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:02,235
Uh, this--my parents are, uh,
doing the circling thing.

1737
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:04,637
- Right, okay. All right,
well, uh, tell you what.

1738
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:08,841
Why don't you give me a call
when you're settled in?

1739
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:16,782
- Toronto had stayed perfectly
intact despite my absence.

1740
01:44:16,784 --> 01:44:18,784
I couldn't vouch for
the napkin patterns

1741
01:44:18,786 --> 01:44:21,721
inside each home we drove past,

1742
01:44:21,723 --> 01:44:23,823
but I had to guess
my painstaking research

1743
01:44:23,825 --> 01:44:25,925
did little to alter
the landscape.

1744
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:32,331
- We don't want to upset you.

1745
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:33,866
We did not know
how to tell you this.

1746
01:44:33,868 --> 01:44:36,602
- Jared's been living
in the basement.

1747
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,437
- What?

1748
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:41,674
- Well, you've been gone
for six months, sweetheart.

1749
01:44:41,676 --> 01:44:43,542
So, you know, um, he's sleeping

1750
01:44:43,544 --> 01:44:45,444
because he has exams
in the morning,

1751
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:47,446
so it's best that you enter
through the front door.

1752
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:49,015
- Can I still use the shower,

1753
01:44:49,017 --> 01:44:51,050
or are the pipes
gonna wake him too?

1754
01:44:51,052 --> 01:44:56,322
- I think tonight we can
make an exception.

1755
01:44:56,324 --> 01:44:58,991
Fuck Harvard!

1756
01:44:58,993 --> 01:45:02,728
- Oh, my God!

1757
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:08,934
- Fuck Harvard!

1758
01:45:08,936 --> 01:45:10,569
- I've never heard
you swear before.

1759
01:45:10,571 --> 01:45:12,605
- Yeah, well, it's true.
Fuck 'em.

1760
01:45:12,607 --> 01:45:14,707
My Jay beat all the odds,

1761
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:16,042
and you're gonna
win the Pulitzer

1762
01:45:16,044 --> 01:45:18,911
from writing it in our basement.

1763
01:45:18,913 --> 01:45:22,648
- To Jay and his fucking
basement Pulitzer!

1764
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,617
- Yeah!

1765
01:45:24,619 --> 01:45:27,620
- Who's idea
was "Fuck Harvard?"

1766
01:45:27,622 --> 01:45:30,923
- Bahadur, you better tell me
you got laid at least

1767
01:45:30,925 --> 01:45:33,693
once over there, or I'm leaving.

1768
01:45:33,695 --> 01:45:36,529
On second thought,
don't tell me.

1769
01:45:36,531 --> 01:45:37,897
Booze is too good to leave.

1770
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:43,703
- You guys want to see
something really cool?

1771
01:45:43,705 --> 01:45:45,805
- Wow.

1772
01:45:45,807 --> 01:45:50,343
You should see
what he does with the bottle.

1773
01:45:50,345 --> 01:45:54,714
- Would I like mine
so--hey, man.

1774
01:45:54,716 --> 01:45:56,515
- What are you mumbling about?

1775
01:45:56,517 --> 01:45:58,851
- Well, I'm just thinking
aloud, you know?

1776
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:02,621
- Okay. I like that.
I like that.

1777
01:46:02,623 --> 01:46:07,093
- So what's next, Bahadur?
- Next?

1778
01:46:07,095 --> 01:46:10,930
- What's gonna keep you from
spending all your nights

1779
01:46:10,932 --> 01:46:14,100
in the shadow of those guys?

1780
01:46:14,102 --> 01:46:17,636
- Well, I got a ton of work
to do on the book.

1781
01:46:17,638 --> 01:46:19,905
- After the book?
- After?

1782
01:46:19,907 --> 01:46:22,975
- Yeah.

1783
01:46:22,977 --> 01:46:26,812
- Take a look at that.

1784
01:46:26,814 --> 01:46:30,883
- 70-year-old men don't get
handed fucking business cards

1785
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:33,719
for a reason unless
it's a last rites priest.

1786
01:46:33,721 --> 01:46:35,087
What's it say?

1787
01:46:35,089 --> 01:46:39,492
- Agent T. Brice, CSIS.
- CSIS?

1788
01:46:39,494 --> 01:46:41,427
- Yeah.
- They talked to you?

1789
01:46:41,429 --> 01:46:46,799
- Yes, they did.
- What'd they say?

1790
01:46:46,801 --> 01:46:50,836
- They were anxious to listen
to what I learned over there.

1791
01:46:50,838 --> 01:46:52,738
- Anxious, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1792
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,907
- Anxious?
- Mm-hmm.

1793
01:46:54,909 --> 01:47:00,880
- Could bring an opportunity.
- That's what I think.

1794
01:47:00,882 --> 01:47:03,082
- Oh.
- Hmm?

1795
01:47:03,084 --> 01:47:06,419
- Christ, you haven't smoked
this fucker yet?

1796
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:08,053
- Not yet.
I've been tempted though.

1797
01:47:08,055 --> 01:47:11,056
- You're hopeless.
- Give me the fucking thing.

1798
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:17,663
- That's Somali?
- Yes.

1799
01:47:17,665 --> 01:47:21,500
- What does it mean?
- "Tonight, we drink."

1800
01:47:21,502 --> 01:47:23,002
- Oh, that's good to hear.

1801
01:47:23,004 --> 01:47:25,871
I thought you were gonna say,
"Tonight we fuck."

1802

♪

1803
01:47:38,485 --> 01:47:39,985

01:47:39,987 --> 01:47:42,655
- Thank you.

1805

position for the committee.

1806
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:53,899
- Sure.

1807
01:47:53,901 --> 01:47:55,835
My name is Jay Bahadur.

1808
01:47:55,837 --> 01:47:57,169
I'm a Canadian citizen

1809
01:47:57,171 --> 01:47:58,838
currently living
in Nairobi, Kenya.

1810
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:00,105
I'm running
"The Somalia Report,"

1811
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:02,007
which is the largest and in fact

1812
01:48:02,009 --> 01:48:05,144
the only English-language
news site devoted to Somalia.

1813
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:06,979
- Mr. Bahadur, you're
considered

1814
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:08,547
one of the foremost experts

1815
01:48:08,549 --> 01:48:12,818
on Somali piracy, are you not?

1816
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:15,855
- I have some knowledge, sir.
- Some knowledge

1817
01:48:15,857 --> 01:48:17,756
would be an understatement.

1818
01:48:17,758 --> 01:48:19,825
Your book on piracy's currently
on "The New York Times'"

1819
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:22,161
bestseller list, is it not?

1820
01:48:22,163 --> 01:48:24,830
- Yes, that's true, sir.
- In your opinion,

1821
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:26,699
what's the most
effective way for us

1822
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:29,568
to combat
this current piracy trend

1823
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:33,272
and make shipping lanes
safe for our vessels?

1824
01:48:33,274 --> 01:48:36,942
- Well, that's a very
general question, sir.

1825
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:43,182
- Well, your best answer's
all we ask, sir.

1826
01:48:43,184 --> 01:48:45,784
- Okay.

1827
01:48:45,786 --> 01:48:47,653
I know there's a lot
of collective knowledge

1828
01:48:47,655 --> 01:48:49,788
in this room, so I apologize
if what I'm about to say

1829
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:51,824
is old news to some of you.

1830
01:48:51,826 --> 01:48:54,793
I did a paper on the subject
my freshman year at university,

1831
01:48:54,795 --> 01:48:56,595
and it just stuck with me.

1832
01:48:56,597 --> 01:48:59,532
- A school paper?

1833
01:48:59,534 --> 01:49:01,267
- Yes.
- Are we gonna hear

1834
01:49:01,269 --> 01:49:04,136
your grade too?

1835
01:49:04,138 --> 01:49:07,540
- No, sir, that is classified.

1836
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:11,977
Um, in 2002 Somaliland
held an election

1837
01:49:11,979 --> 01:49:15,814
where the minority clan won the
presidential office by 80 votes,

1838
01:49:15,816 --> 01:49:19,818
and the transition of power
was completely peaceful,

1839
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:22,721
no violence, not one shot fired.

1840
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:24,690
That doesn't happen
anywhere in Africa.

1841
01:49:24,692 --> 01:49:27,026
That doesn't even happen here.

1842
01:49:27,028 --> 01:49:30,996
Anyway, it caught my eye
and made me start

1843
01:49:30,998 --> 01:49:32,598
to fall in love with Somalia

1844
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,066
and ultimately made me

1845
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:36,569
go there to find out
what made them different.

1846
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:38,203
After spending
my last five years

1847
01:49:38,205 --> 01:49:41,140
immersed in their
country's struggles,

1848
01:49:41,142 --> 01:49:45,611
they don't need your
warships off their coast.

1849
01:49:45,613 --> 01:49:48,781
What they need is to be
recognized by all of you

1850
01:49:48,783 --> 01:49:54,153
for the incredibly complex but
honorable culture that they are.

1851
01:49:54,155 --> 01:49:56,855
A fledgling democracy doesn't
make headlines like pirates do.

1852
01:49:56,857 --> 01:49:58,357
You guys wouldn't be
sitting here talking to me

1853
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:00,292
if I wrote a book
on a fledgling democracy.

1854
01:50:00,294 --> 01:50:02,027
Hell, I couldn't even
afford this suit

1855
01:50:02,029 --> 01:50:05,831
if I wrote a book
on a fledgling democracy.

1856
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:09,101
All I'm asking is that you guys
start to look at Somalia

1857
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:10,903
in a different way,

1858
01:50:10,905 --> 01:50:13,872
not so much as them versus us,

1859
01:50:13,874 --> 01:50:18,110
but rather look at Somalia as us

1860
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,946
