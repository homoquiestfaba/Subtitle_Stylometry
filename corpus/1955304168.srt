1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,464
<i>Who am I?</i>

2
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,308
<i>Who will I become?</i>

3
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,916
<i>What does it all mean?</i>

4
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,299
<i>It's what I'm supposed
to be asking, right?</i>

5
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,370
<i>But, right now,</i>

6
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,407
<i>I'd do anything for the
answer to just one question.</i>

7
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,020
<i>"Are you proud of me?"</i>

8
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,098
<i>Big day tomorrow, dad.</i>

9
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,301
<i>Your son is off to college.</i>

10
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:46,772
I've still got morning wood, so
this better be fucking worth it.

11
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,577
<i>But that's tomorrow.</i>

12
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,883
It's a little bit early,
Jesse. What's going on?

13
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,031
What would make
this day perfect?

14
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,766
What the fuck you talking about?

15
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,436
I'm talking about a perfect day.

16
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,571
What would it look like?

17
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,142
Man, I just want to drink it in.

18
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,346
No, you fucks.

19
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,581
I mean, I literally, I just like,
uh, I wanna start drinking

20
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:34,620
and I don't wanna stop until I'm just
knee-deep in some forbidden pussy.

21
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,223
Fair enough, I can
make that happen.

22
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,859
The drinking part.

23
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,961
How about you?

24
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,397
I got to tell her.

25
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,836
Be bold, brother.

26
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,272
You've got nothing to lose.

27
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,310
My oldest and dearest friend,

28
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,612
what do you want?

29
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:04,650
What will make our last
day together perfect?

30
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,752
Nothing, man.

31
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,956
I want nothing.

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,667
Today, boys,

33
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,805
everything's possible.

34
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:33,245
I'm still confused why this circle jerk
couldn't wait till the sun came up.

35
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,148
Take it easy.
My mom's making breakfast.

36
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,084
Is she making that thing...
With that thing... Jesse!

37
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:43,088
Jesse, wait. Yeah, yeah,
she's making your thing.

38
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,215
Have you not
planned this out at all?

39
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,920
I was just saying, you've
had four years to do this.

40
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,588
Are we good, we all done?

41
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,956
Amazing.
Good.

42
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,325
- Give this to me.
- No, no, no, no.

43
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,361
We've got it.
You've done enough.

44
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:25,097
Thank you, Bobby.
Thank you.

45
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,467
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Where are my manners?

46
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,168
Yeah, where are your manners?

47
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,970
Up your ass...

48
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,772
- I'm sorry, Diane.
- I'll live.

49
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,407
- You look beautiful today.
- Thank you.

50
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,708
- Smooth.
- Your mom...

51
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,611
- Whatever... shut up.
- Your mom loves you.

52
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,480
Is Lily coming over?

53
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,516
Yeah, in a bit.

54
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,853
Have you decided
what you gonna do?

55
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,087
No.

56
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,590
I don't know.

57
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,926
I mean,

58
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,495
Lily is...
I know.

59
00:04:56,497 --> 00:05:01,500
But... I mean, isn't college supposed
to be about new experiences?

60
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,535
Sure.

61
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,905
What do you think I should do?

62
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,277
Well, I could tell you but I don't
think you're gonna like it.

63
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,112
Try me.

64
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,516
You should follow your heart.

65
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,852
Oh, thank you, very helpful.

66
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,288
Oh, that's my job.

67
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,692
Follow your heart.

68
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,365
Nan and pop were high school
sweethearts, right? Hmm-mmm.

69
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,168
Yup, each other's one and only.

70
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,136
What was their secret?

71
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:43,709
Ah, she was his calm.

72
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,111
That's it?

73
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,546
That is it.

74
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,915
Pop was a thinker, like you.

75
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,251
And when those wheels would start
spinning in the middle of the night

76
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,219
and he couldn't
get back to sleep,

77
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,488
the only thing
that would get him there

78
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,724
would be the touch
of nan's hand.

79
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:02,994
Right on his back, or his
arm, out like a light.

80
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,099
She was his calm.

81
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,304
I mean it.

82
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,441
You follow that heart of yours,

83
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,812
it will tell you when
you've found your match.

84
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,147
Trust me.

85
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,918
You must miss him so much.

86
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,654
I see him every day.

87
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,758
Go, go have fun.

88
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,464
How you doing?
Hi.

89
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:16,067
What's going on?
Hey, douchebag.

90
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:30,081
All right, well, I believe
we have Diem to Carpe.

91
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,416
Cheers.

92
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,118
Why would you do that? No!

93
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,368
May we?

94
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,371
Oh, not without a drink,
I'm afraid.

95
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,339
Rules are rules.

96
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,808
Hey, can you be a doll
and fetch me two beers?

97
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,011
Can you be a doll
and lick my nut sack?

98
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,479
Oh, my god.

99
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,181
Who talks like that?

100
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,216
Want a beer? Oh! Come on!

101
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,653
Thank you so much.

102
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,988
It helps.

103
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,656
Have a good time!

104
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:45,824
Thanks.

105
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,659
All right, you guys
are going down.

106
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,228
Oh-ho-ho,
boys against girls.

107
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,263
How exciting.

108
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,331
Okay. Hmm.
Here you go.

109
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,933
I got this.
You got it.

110
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,801
Thank you.
You're welcome.

111
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,503
You're going down.
Hmm.

112
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,905
Do that strut.

113
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,386
Good luck.

114
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,922
Thank you.
Oh, and, uh...

115
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,670
Ha-ha!

116
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,072
Taken!

117
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,875
That was just cruel.

118
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,176
Emily.

119
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:42,581
Five, four, three,
two, mwah, one.

120
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,250
Ha-ha.

121
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,853
You are crazy.

122
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,167
Wow!

123
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,270
You, uh, care to share?

124
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,339
I make a wish.

125
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:11,309
Every time I throw, I... It's
like blowing an eyelash.

126
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,078
That's my secret trick.

127
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,813
Helps me concentrate.

128
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,287
<i>Here's the problem with love.</i>

129
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,290
<i>Even for us hopeless
suckers who want it,</i>

130
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,259
<i>nothing beats
the "falling in love" part.</i>

131
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:32,397
<i>How the littlest looks can
send shivers down your spine.</i>

132
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:37,268
<i>How you can spend days imagining
what her lips must feel like.</i>

133
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,038
<i>How soft her skin must be.</i>

134
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,008
<i>But see, that's the
problem with love.</i>

135
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,312
<i>Once you fall in love, the
"falling in love" part is over.</i>

136
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,751
Speaking of ass sucking,
which one do you want?

137
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,553
Are you serious?

138
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,357
Don't you think Jen and Emily
know you a bit too well?

139
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,559
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

140
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:05,063
Means they know you're
a disgusting fucking pig.

141
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,399
Well, what's your point?

142
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,469
Whatever, man,
this is your last shot.

143
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,338
Speak now
or forever hold your peace.

144
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,839
Yeah, I'll take my chances.

145
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,343
Well, they're both mine
then, I guess.

146
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,713
Hi, Aiden.

147
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,449
Hi, buddy.

148
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,128
That's my boy!

149
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,731
Must have been a hell of a wish.

150
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,600
Yeah.

151
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,278
Looks like fun.

152
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,046
Horseshoes?

153
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,615
Yeah.

154
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,618
Knock yourself out.

155
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,788
I suppose it's too much to ask
that you at least pretend

156
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,191
like you want to spend
your last day with us?

157
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:09,661
Pretending really
isn't in my DNA.

158
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,196
No, it is not.

159
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,966
You know it's not you guys.

160
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,701
It's just...

161
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,837
I'm ready.

162
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,639
Ready to get outta here.

163
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,609
Ready for tomorrow.

164
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,910
Yes!

165
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,181
Tomorrow's coming.

166
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:33,852
You might as well enjoy
yourself in the meantime.

167
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:44,129
You're not thinking what
I think you're thinking?

168
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:53,872
Oh.

169
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,541
Oh, she's doing that thing.

170
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,543
She's doing that... I fuckin'
love it when they do that thing.

171
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:02,013
They know that we love it when they do
that thing, right? I mean, they must.

172
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,115
That's probably exactly
why they do it, duh.

173
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,985
What do you think
they're talking about?

174
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,487
You need to fuckin' smoke
some more weed, dude.

175
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,090
Don't you fucking say it.
Don't!

176
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,425
- Calm down.
- Why?

177
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,393
You're such a dick, dude.

178
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,228
You're so lucky you
didn't tell me to relax.

179
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,764
I fuckin' hate it when
people tell me to relax.

180
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:20,899
I absolutely hate it.

181
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,600
It's like, who do
you think you are comin' in

182
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,069
to Oscar's space
and fuckin' with my vibe.

183
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,471
Who gave you that
right? I didn't.

184
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,640
I didn't do that.
Tell me to relax.

185
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,641
You fucking relax.

186
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,810
Phew. Seriously, though, what do
you think they're talking about?

187
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,213
You think they're talking about us?
Yeah, sure.

188
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,481
Wow.

189
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,019
Hey, Oscar.

190
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,787
What's up, brother?

191
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,988
Fuckin' relax.

192
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,059
It's a fight, fucker.
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

193
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,429
Here, bitch.
Ugh!

194
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,730
Idiots.
Em.

195
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,599
Yeah?
Here you go.

196
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:59,304
Look at these guys,
they're like walking hormones.

197
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,872
They are only good
for one thing,

198
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,141
which conveniently for me,

199
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,911
is the only thing
that I want from them.

200
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,514
As you go and suck your bottle.

201
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,254
I think they've got a bit
more to offer than that.

202
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,991
May be some do.

203
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:20,525
May be.

204
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:25,597
Well, I can't be bothered to sift through
all your friends, who's got the time?

205
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,833
Do you think guys are gonna
be any better in college?

206
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:33,471
I hope not. I like them just the
way they are. Uncomplicated.

207
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,473
Nipple placement is critical.

208
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,743
Hey, guys.

209
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,179
You and Serena were, like,
having a pretty good time.

210
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,848
Fuck, it's horseshoes.
What do you want me to say?

211
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,951
Baby steps, brother.
Baby steps.

212
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,286
I don't know, man.

213
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,687
What?

214
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,190
Man, you and Bobby, dude,
you just don't get it.

215
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:56,995
And you do, Mr. take-your-pick-between-two-girls-
who-can't-fucking-stand-you?

216
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,029
That doesn't matter.

217
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:58,796
Yeah, it does.
No, it do...

218
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,567
If any of us want to bang girls for
more sexual experience before college,

219
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,102
it has to be today.

220
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,703
I'm talking all of us.

221
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,239
All of us and them.

222
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,975
Girls are not that different.

223
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,577
Yeah, they are.
Yeah, they are.

224
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,079
No, they're not.
No, no. No they're not.

225
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,482
I mean, the data is
pretty much on our side.

226
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,217
You want some data?
Yeah.

227
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:22,587
Aiden, how much do you
love blowjobs? What?

228
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,922
What? I dunno.

229
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,723
You... you don't know?

230
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,359
I mean, it's a lot.
It's good.

231
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,195
Fuck, man. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, of course it's great!

232
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,230
On a scale from one to ten,

233
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,898
how hot does a girl have to be
for you to let her blow you?

234
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,269
Ah, dude, I don't know. I haven't really,
like, put a lot of thought into it.

235
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,337
So fuckin' think about it, man!

236
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,307
Let's take out the sevens, the
eights, the nines and the tens

237
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,108
'cause they're in, right?

238
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,611
So would you let a six blow you?

239
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,048
Depends.
On what?

240
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,549
On the circumstances.
Oh!

241
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,284
You fucking me, man!
No, it's important!

242
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,321
Okay, fine, yeah,
sixes are in, all right?

243
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,555
I'd let a six blow me.

244
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,891
How kind of you.
How about a five?

245
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:00,858
Yeah, fine, fives, whatever.

246
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,694
Okay, so we're actually
getting somewhere now.

247
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,296
Would you let a four blow you?

248
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,532
Jessica Dooley is a four.

249
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:08,299
On her best day.
No, no!

250
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,201
You don't even... Don't even
start with that bullshit.

251
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,870
No, stop. Where are we?
We're at three now?

252
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:13,371
Okay, take it easy.

253
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,574
Aiden, like every other
guy in the planet, would

254
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:20,044
let just about any girl with
a pulse give him a blowjob.

255
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,447
So what, for the love
of god, is your point?

256
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,549
I'm getting there, Jesse.

257
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,684
Bobby, on a scale
from one to ten,

258
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,020
just on looks, what's Aiden?

259
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,788
He's like a 8.5.

260
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,291
Aw, thanks, man.
Okay, so what am I?

261
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,692
You?
Yeah.

262
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:35,593
You're a three.

263
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,161
Ha! You're a fuckin' asshole.

264
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,964
No, you're like a seven. No,
you already said it, no. Okay.

265
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,034
I don't know
where you're going with this.

266
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,569
I know that girls are different.

267
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,471
Okay, but they are not
that different.

268
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:49,640
They are just as sexually
curious as we are.

269
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,709
You don't think that a girl
loves the feeling

270
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,543
of our tongues on their pussies

271
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,947
as much as we love the feeling
of her mouth on our cocks?

272
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,048
Of course, they do.

273
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,251
Come on, dude!
We are all young!

274
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,354
You know, we are curious
and we're sexual

275
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:08,493
and we want to investigate and
explore and rip off and unzip and

276
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,696
explode everywhere! Watch
where you're exploding.

277
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,998
So here's your data, all right?

278
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,235
Guys will down for a
three, at least, right?

279
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,604
Serena's getting
an eight and a half.

280
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,273
Girls are different
but think about this.

281
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,276
Are they five and a half
points different?

282
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,177
I don't think so.

283
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,645
That's why I think Aiden
is already in there.

284
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:31,883
And the truth is, that they are
not even four points different.

285
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,951
So that means
that I have a shot.

286
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:37,922
So yeah. Go ahead and put that
data in your pipe and suck it.

287
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,724
Okay. All right.

288
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,592
Look at them.

289
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:47,665
I mean, they look like
just simple creatures to me.

290
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:55,239
Ten counts says they're talking
about periods and push-up bras.

291
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:56,741
Jen's easy.

292
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,378
Ten years from now,
a high-powered attorney.

293
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,112
I like that.

294
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,748
Yeah, she'll be chewing
up men for a living.

295
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,484
And spitting them out.
Argh!

296
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,021
What about kids?

297
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,557
What about them?
Oh.

298
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,792
Do you think
you'll ever want them?

299
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,160
Em, I am one.

300
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,530
I'm sure as hell not
thinking about having one.

301
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,399
Okay, Serena's turn.

302
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,700
Oh, you're a writer.

303
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,436
Ah, awesome.
Thank you.

304
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,205
What about em?

305
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:31,375
That... that is also easy.
President of Sierra club.

306
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,512
President of the peace corps.

307
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:35,613
President of the United States.

308
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,016
Okay, okay. You guys are nuts.
We're not nuts.

309
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,385
You're the most brilliant
girl I've ever met.

310
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,955
And you won
most likely to succeed.

311
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,823
And yearbooks do not lie.

312
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:49,560
Wait, em... em is editor
of the yearbook.

313
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:52,763
How do we know
that she didn't rig it?

314
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,602
Because I won
most likely to succeed?

315
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,571
- Wait, what's that mean?
- Oh, come on.

316
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:03,908
No, everybody knows that
most likely to succeed

317
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,909
is just code for biggest nerd.

318
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,978
Em, no. No, no, no, no, no.
No it's not.

319
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,449
It's not code for anything. It
means that people believe in you.

320
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,918
Says the girl who won best body.
Aw!

321
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,652
Come on, em.

322
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,155
So I have a good body,
big fuckin' what?

323
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,124
It is not something to take
for granted, trust me.

324
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:24,295
Neither is people thinking
that you're smart, trust me.

325
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,097
Okay, Lily's turn.

326
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,267
Uh, please.
I'm a lost cause.

327
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,601
Aw!

328
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,638
I am also a lost cause.

329
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,742
Kiss my ass!

330
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,979
Lily, wait for me!

331
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,335
<i>- There's still so much
- I wish I could ask you.</i>

332
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:07,305
<i>Show you, share with you.</i>

333
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,319
<i>It doesn't get any
better than this.</i>

334
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,259
<i>It's funny how that thought
comforts me</i>

335
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:31,696
<i>and scares the shit out of me
at the same time.</i>

336
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:36,634
<i>On one hand, I'm so grateful</i>

337
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,269
<i>for these guys.</i>

338
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:44,742
<i>For Lily, for this day,
for this moment.</i>

339
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,144
<i>On the other hand,
I've got this gut feeling</i>

340
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:50,514
<i>it's only going to get harder
from here on out.</i>

341
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,450
<i>How could it not?</i>

342
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,318
<i>Look at us.</i>

343
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,455
<i>This has gotta be
the easy part, right?</i>

344
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,531
<i>What's it going to be like when
this little adventure that we're on</i>

345
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,434
<i>takes some
real twists and turns?</i>

346
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,537
Settle an argument for me.

347
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,040
May I?

348
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,945
Oh.

349
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,017
Is Jen right?

350
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,520
She really does think
all guys are assholes.

351
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,924
She's probably right.

352
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,027
Wow.

353
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,264
I don't think you're an asshole.

354
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,267
May be I'm not like other guys.

355
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,204
Or maybe assholes
are just assholes

356
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,406
and you are like most guys.

357
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,407
Oh, so I am like most guys?

358
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,109
No, that's not what I meant.

359
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,011
I... I'm kidding.

360
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,521
So do you think you're ready?

361
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,389
For what?

362
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,558
Leaving home.

363
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,928
College, all of it.

364
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,864
As ready as I'll ever be, right?

365
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,233
That is just it.

366
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,638
I don't think I'm as ready
as I could have been.

367
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,642
What do you mean?

368
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,545
Well, I just... I think
there are some things

369
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:30,114
I could have or should
have done before going.

370
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,549
Like what?

371
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,285
I don't know.

372
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,189
Like...

373
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,793
Like dated more.

374
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,397
Maybe I should have dated more.

375
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,867
Em, you have
plenty of time for that.

376
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:54,171
Plus, how may high school
idiots can you date anyway?

377
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,976
I wondered though if maybe
dating more in high school

378
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,846
would have made me better
at dating in college.

379
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,749
"Better at dating?"
Sure.

380
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,917
It takes practice, right?

381
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,687
It gets better with
practice, right? Em,

382
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:12,323
you don't need to
practice dating.

383
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:15,526
Well, it's easy for you to say.

384
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:19,263
I'm sure you've done all the
dating that you wanted.

385
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,299
Don't be so sure.

386
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,436
You're saying...

387
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:29,640
You're saying there's someone that
you wanted to date, but didn't?

388
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,143
Are you nuts, of course.

389
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,191
Ah, dude, thank you so much.
Wait, did he make it?

390
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:49,593
- So sweet.
- No, no, no.

391
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,495
He almost made it.

392
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,297
It was a great fuckin' effort.

393
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:57,401
Almost only counts in horseshoes
and junior high sex, right, Jen?

394
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:58,636
I'm sorry, buddy.

395
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:03,140
I know I promised but some
things just have to be shared.

396
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,742
Yes, they do.

397
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,813
Do they?

398
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,685
What does that mean?
No, don't you dare.

399
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,487
Oh, screw that.

400
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,855
Dare away.

401
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,290
What?
Come on, em.

402
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,559
Some things have to be shared.

403
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,428
No, seriously.
I will kill you.

404
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,997
You will thank me.
No, no.

405
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,034
It's time for the cat
to be out of that bag.

406
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,268
Maybe these guys can help you.

407
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,537
No, no, no, I don't know
about this, you guys.

408
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,305
I'm with Lily on this one.

409
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:38,876
No, I do not care who you're
with, not another word.

410
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,415
Not another word.

411
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,283
Sorry, em.
Should be.

412
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:46,750
What...

413
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,153
Sorry. What, wait, no.
That's it?

414
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,555
Yeah.
That's bullshit.

415
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:52,990
Actually, I mean...

416
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,625
I think it's really impressive.

417
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,460
Shut up. No, no, no, no.
Think about it.

418
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,296
I mean, guys would never let each
other off the hook like that.

419
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,764
Girls are so much sweeter.

420
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:03,534
Okay, that's bullshit,
and sexist.

421
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:06,136
- What are you talking about?
Hmm-mmm. Sexist.

422
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:09,039
What? How is that sexist?
I was trying to be nice.

423
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:13,244
Anytime you make a generalization
based on gender, that's sexist.

424
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,246
Argh! Blow me, dyke.

425
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,081
- You fucking asshole!
- Oscar!

426
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:20,150
What... you think
all guys are assholes, so...

427
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,318
Yeah, I do
because they are, Oscar.

428
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,088
Okay, and is that not,
you know, sexist, Jen?

429
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,556
I mean, okay, I guess I clearly
don't understand women.

430
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,326
I mean, it's not like I said chicks
are more manipulative or controlling.

431
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,262
I know you're trying
to be complimentary

432
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,597
but really you're just
putting all of us in a box.

433
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,767
Oh, fucking, just shoot me
in the face, dude. Okay.

434
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:37,568
No. You know what,
okay, hold on.

435
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,738
Is it sexist to say that men are
physically stronger than women?

436
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,339
Yeah.
No, it's not. It's a fact.

437
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,943
And is it sexist to say that
men are smarter than women?

438
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,344
No, 'cause you guys are dumb.

439
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,446
Oh, my god!
And that's a fact too.

440
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,748
- Yeah.
- You've got to go.

441
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,850
Jen is right.
You're an asshole.

442
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,520
What? Okay, so you
agree with them?

443
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,621
No, actually, I don't.

444
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:01,025
Doesn't mean we can't have a
civilized conversation about it.

445
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:03,761
- Thank you, Jesse.
- Yes.

446
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,664
But you don't agree with me,

447
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:10,100
you think it's okay
to put all this in a box?

448
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,336
Jesse?

449
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:20,044
Okay, okay, ah...

450
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,248
You know what this is?

451
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,482
Mmm-mmm.
Yes.

452
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,451
A molding of Lily's clitoris.

453
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,186
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my god!

454
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,955
Look at it though.
No, it's a goddess.

455
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,791
You actually never shock me.
It's a goddess.

456
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:34,325
That was too far.

457
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:36,727
Well, that doesn't shock me either...
It's a goddess.

458
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,729
Shh... You fucking
feminist hippie.

459
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,998
So do you like it?

460
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,499
Yeah. I love it. You know that.

461
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,469
I think it's really...
It's beautiful!

462
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,937
Thank you.
Yeah.

463
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,739
So let me ask you.

464
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,075
Why is the goddess beautiful?

465
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:53,444
What do you mean?
What makes it beautiful?

466
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:58,482
Uh, well, what are you, a
fuckin lawyer all of a sudden?

467
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,317
No, no, I just...

468
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,820
I just think it's a shame
we're all getting so caught up

469
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,189
in saying and doing
all the right things

470
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:09,026
that we can't even say what's
beautiful about something.

471
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:11,996
Why do I wear her
around my neck?

472
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:13,931
Why?

473
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,200
Because she is beautiful.

474
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,502
She's calm.

475
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,837
She's wise.

476
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,671
She's gentle.

477
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:24,274
She's fair, she's nurturing,
she's powerful.

478
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:27,378
She's mysterious,
she's adventurous,

479
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,748
she's fearless.
She's a protector.

480
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,851
And, yes, she is sweet.

481
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:40,224
If you think that's sexist,
so be it.

482
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,297
I think it's pretty damn sexy.

483
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,435
So what? A guy can't
be all those things?

484
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,705
Man, if you think that's
what I'm trying to say...

485
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,940
I strive to be all those things.

486
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,309
These are qualities I admire.

487
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:02,446
I think you are
all of those things.

488
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,180
That's why I love you.

489
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:06,517
So I guess you loved me
for just the other reasons.

490
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,218
Who says I love you.

491
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,322
I need a beer.
Oh, Bobby!

492
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,393
Seriously, goddammit.

493
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,762
Dude, you're not going to
fucking ruin my buzz today.

494
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,031
You need to
figure your shit out.

495
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,299
I don't get it, like...

496
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,902
So we're not going
to the same school.

497
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:27,604
You and me aren't.
Aiden and I aren't.

498
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,243
- What?
- It's not the same.

499
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:33,744
It's not.

500
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:37,114
Ever since the beginning it's
always been you and Bobby.

501
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,450
It was Jesse and Bobby.
Jesse and Bobby.

502
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:40,350
It's always been
Jesse and Bobby.

503
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:44,188
You guys won best couple in the
yearbook, for Christ's sakes.

504
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,489
- What?
- What?

505
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:48,058
What?
What?

506
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,427
You and Bobby

507
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,329
got the most votes

508
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:53,230
for best couple

509
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,200
but miss Obed knew you guys
weren't actually a real couple

510
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:57,434
so she gave it
to the runner-up.

511
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,369
Oh, my god.
Are you being serious?

512
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,437
Yeah.
Wait a second.

513
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,707
I thought Jesse and Lily
won best couple.

514
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,742
Not exactly.

515
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,144
He's being a bit sensitive,
isn't he?

516
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:10,380
So we aren't going to the same school.
None of us are.

517
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,382
But that doesn't mean...
No, no, no, no.

518
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,951
Did you and I win best couple?

519
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:17,788
No, we did not.
So why're you telling me?

520
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,337
This a private party?

521
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,478
Let me ask you something.

522
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,481
Why are you taking
this thing so hard?

523
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,050
How am I supposed to take it
when my best friend

524
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,452
tells me he doesn't
wanna hang out anymore?

525
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:52,489
What... do you think that's
what I'm saying? Aren't you?

526
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,910
We won best couple.

527
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,012
What?

528
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,713
Apparently,

529
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,849
according to Emily, you and I

530
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,885
got the most votes
for best couple.

531
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,687
Isn't that something?

532
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,722
Sure, we deserved it.

533
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,291
Jesse and Bobby.

534
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,331
Jesse and Bobby.

535
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,034
Who's better than us?

536
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,873
I think

537
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:46,443
you might just be the best
"best friend."

538
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,886
So why did you change your mind?

539
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,236
We would have an absolute blast

540
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:14,571
if we went to school together.

541
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,641
Jesse and Bobby.

542
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,611
I fucking love Jesse and Bobby.

543
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:22,479
It's who I am.

544
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,781
I'm not going
to a different school

545
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,551
'cause I don't want to
hang out anymore.

546
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,919
I'm going

547
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,189
because I gotta know
who Jesse is

548
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,791
without Jesse and Bobby.

549
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,671
I'm gonna go check on Lily.

550
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,773
Wanna head back?

551
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,111
I'll head over in a bit.

552
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,579
All right.

553
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,994
Anybody wanna go on a walk?

554
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,764
Go on a fucking walk.

555
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:21,665
Go on a walk.

556
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,035
I don't want to...
Jesus, come on, man.

557
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,336
Fine.

558
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,010
You're, um...

559
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:36,313
You're going to Boulder, right?
Mmm-hmm.

560
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,385
It's awesome. It should be...
Be really fun.

561
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,086
Mmm-hmm.

562
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,460
It's funny, we haven't
really hung out that much.

563
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,363
What do you mean?
We're always together.

564
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,033
I guess. I mean...

565
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,601
Uh...

566
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,669
I mean, we're together 'cause

567
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,039
we have the same
friends, you know.

568
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,907
But, we never really...

569
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,410
Talk, or, you know, hang out.

570
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,377
All right, I'll tell you what?

571
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,280
Let's... let's make up
for that right now.

572
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,482
Okay, uh...

573
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:13,617
Yeah, sure.

574
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:17,254
All right. Well, fire away.
Ask me anything.

575
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,489
Uh...

576
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,192
Fire away.
Okay. Uh...

577
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,829
Did you like high school?

578
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,230
Yes.

579
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,266
I mean, yeah.

580
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,701
I don't know. I...

581
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:36,106
Maybe. Ask me again
in 10 years.

582
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,040
Okay.

583
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,276
Okay, my turn.
Okay.

584
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,344
Favorite five?

585
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,345
Favorite what?

586
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,614
Favorite five.
The essentials.

587
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,550
Favorite color.
Uh-huh.

588
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:47,284
Favorite food.
Okay.

589
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:50,754
Favorite song. Favorite movie.
Favorite position.

590
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,457
You're just a little
bit crazy, aren't you?

591
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,258
Well, aren't we all?

592
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,127
Well?

593
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,295
Uh...

594
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,096
Okay, all right.

595
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,530
So it's color first, right?

596
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,765
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, color.

597
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,767
That's easy. Umm...

598
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,302
How about...

599
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,274
I'm gonna go

600
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,976
right there.

601
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,346
Sunset-y blue.

602
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,815
Sunset-y blue?
Yeah.

603
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,918
I didn't realize
that was a color.

604
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,590
Ah, see, it's not
just a color, all right.

605
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,092
It's my favorite color.
Oh.

606
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,273
Happens every day.

607
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,945
That's you and me, you know.

608
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,216
We happen every day.

609
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,754
Here comes the "but."

610
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,592
But...
I knew it.

611
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,629
What do you know?

612
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,899
Not much.

613
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:11,701
I know

614
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:15,071
we're both thinking
the same thing.

615
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:17,874
Oh. What's that?

616
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,180
That maybe

617
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:27,617
this is supposed to be
our last sunset together.

618
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,720
Our last

619
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,523
magical, unforgettable sunset.

620
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,968
What do we do?

621
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,272
I don't know.

622
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,743
Well, we're kinda
running out of time here.

623
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,713
Let's make a list.

624
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,748
What... are you serious?

625
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,017
Pros and cons of breaking-up.
Uh-huh.

626
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,719
We're both thinking
the same thing.

627
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,222
So, just,
we'll put it out there.

628
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,623
Put it out there.

629
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,691
And...

630
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,359
Let's get them out there.
Let's just...

631
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:10,894
Okay, pros for breaking-up.
Let's go.

632
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,829
Pros for breaking-up.

633
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,997
Pro.

634
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:18,134
We... we wouldn't have to
do the long distance thing.

635
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:19,169
I mean...

636
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:20,770
People say it's brutal.
Yeah.

637
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:23,073
And we wouldn't have to be
that pathetic freshmen,

638
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,508
waiting around for
our boyfriend or girlfriend

639
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,612
when everyone else is out
experiencing new things.

640
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,647
Right. Cool things.

641
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,749
Yeah.

642
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,255
You can kiss as many
guys as you wanted.

643
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:41,458
And you can kiss as many
girls as you wanted.

644
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,426
Yeah.

645
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,062
Uh, in fact, you could do
whatever you wanted.

646
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,798
You could do
whatever you wanted.

647
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,634
It's pretty enticing.

648
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,436
Yeah, it is.

649
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,141
Okay, cons for breaking-up.

650
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,612
I've got this breathtaking girl.

651
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,020
And I've got this beautiful boy.

652
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,125
And I'd miss her like crazy.

653
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,495
I'd miss him like crazy.

654
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:25,001
While I was out experiencing
all these new things,

655
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:25,935
I feel like I just

656
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,738
want to be
in my pathetic dorm room.

657
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,676
Pathetically waiting for
my girlfriend to show up.

658
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,813
Yeah, I can see myself
being pretty

659
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,149
pathetic.

660
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,121
So?

661
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,459
So?

662
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,786
I wish it didn't have to end.

663
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,562
Who says it has to?

664
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:14,110
To today, boys.

665
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,113
Everything is possible.

666
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,354
Stay in shape forever, man.

667
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,103
You know how in
every movie about space

668
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,772
someone always asks
something like,

669
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,040
um,

670
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,776
"do you ever wonder

671
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:57,080
"somewhere out there, in the sky

672
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,617
"if there are people

673
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:04,587
"looking up at us just like
we're looking up at them?"

674
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,990
I love that.

675
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,525
Like, maybe

676
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,228
there are eight other friends

677
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,764
out there just like us

678
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,268
looking up at the earth.

679
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,602
I doubt it.

680
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,538
I don't know.

681
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,109
I mean, there's an infinite
amount of space out there, right?

682
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,412
Uh, infinity...

683
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,782
It's so hard to wrap
your brain around it.

684
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,485
It's like that monkey.

685
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,556
What monkey?

686
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,427
You know, it's...
It's the, uh...

687
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,195
It's the theory, right?

688
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,697
Like you...
If you put a monkey

689
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,265
in front of a typewriter...
Excuse me.

690
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:52,502
For infinity, eventually...
Okay, thanks.

691
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:54,971
It's going to write <i>Hamlet.</i>

692
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,007
That's ridiculous.

693
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,542
I don't buy that.

694
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:00,877
I don't know
what there is to buy.

695
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:03,079
A monkey's not going
to type <i>Hamlet.</i>

696
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,648
What, it's gonna get every letter
perfectly in the right order

697
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,784
including all the
capitals and punctuation?

698
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:08,318
Eventually, yeah.

699
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,254
You guys are fucking crazy.
There's no way...

700
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:11,754
We're not crazy.

701
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,657
You just don't understand
the meaning of infinity.

702
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,194
Okay, all right. All right.
Emily, I'm sorry. Uh...

703
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,129
Before my friends
rudely interrupted you

704
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:24,100
about some childish
genius monkey typer thing,

705
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:24,734
you were...

706
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:28,004
You were pondering
life on other planets.

707
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,206
My whole life,

708
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,309
I've loved knowing that I have

709
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,411
the coolest,

710
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,080
best friends in the world.

711
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,415
- Thank you. But...
- Of course.

712
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,420
We're going to college.

713
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:47,924
For four years.

714
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,293
At least.

715
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,594
At least.

716
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:54,430
So like those people
looking up at the stars,

717
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:56,265
I wonder if I'll find

718
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,334
another you.

719
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,804
Or another Lily.

720
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,173
Or another Serena.

721
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,244
Kinda hope I do.

722
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,849
You're right, it's weird.

723
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:16,152
We're gonna have a whole
new group of friends.

724
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,489
New everything.

725
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,224
New beds.

726
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:23,593
I love my bed.

727
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,428
Yeah, a lot of guys do.

728
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,133
New chill spots.
New guys.

729
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:32,602
New girls.
Any girls.

730
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:34,103
New rules.

731
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,405
No rules.

732
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:36,506
No curfew.

733
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,441
No fucking curfew.

734
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,676
No sneaking out.

735
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,144
Or in.
Or in.

736
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,082
No parents.

737
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,956
No parents.

738
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,794
No family.

739
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,510
It's beautiful, isn't it?

740
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:17,013
Just all of us
sitting here together.

741
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,948
Quiet.

742
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:23,352
Can't help wondering what you guys
are thinking about right now.

743
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:24,554
We were probably always

744
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,622
thinking the same thing, right?

745
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:28,624
Not the exact same thing,

746
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,727
but similar.

747
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:36,199
Probably thinking about
how amazing today was.

748
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,001
Jesse, man.

749
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,170
Thank you for this day.

750
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,840
You're probably all
thinking about tomorrow.

751
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:49,112
Venturing off to
god knows where and what.

752
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,981
But that's tomorrow.

753
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:55,752
You know, that's over there.

754
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,787
And before tomorrow happens,

755
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,857
and the day after that,
and the day after that,

756
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,028
all we have is right here.

757
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,268
Amen, brother.

758
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:13,803
Right.

759
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:16,172
Everything that...
That matters

760
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:17,573
is right here.

761
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,576
I mean, think about that.

762
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,345
While you guys are
thinking about that,

763
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,547
I want you to think
about one more thing.

764
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:28,618
And this is actually
mainly just to

765
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,853
Jen and/or Emily.

766
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,023
I want you to think about this.

767
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,958
And I mean this
more than anything

768
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,194
I have ever said before.

769
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,864
I am

770
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:45,501
pretty amazing at eating pussy.

771
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,937
Okay, no. All right.
Okay. Hold it.

772
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:50,239
That might have come out
a little wrong. That's...

773
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,241
I'm not... I'm just saying

774
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,410
I'm a generous lover.

775
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,713
Like, I enjoy giving back...

776
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:59,582
No.
To the people.

777
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:00,817
What?

778
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,485
What?

779
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,653
No... all right. Okay.

780
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,587
Aiden...

781
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,756
We'll go back to the
infinity monkey thing.

782
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:09,659
Infinity? You want to
talk about that now?

783
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:11,994
Emily story.

784
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,262
Tell me the Emily story. Oh.

785
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,231
You have to tell me
the Emily story.

786
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:15,765
No. Not a chance.

787
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:18,267
Come on. I will literally do
anything for you, Emily.

788
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,469
Emily. Emily.
I will do anything for you.

789
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,705
Just let Lily
tell the story, please.

790
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:25,274
Come on, throw him a bone.

791
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,443
Anything?

792
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,011
Anything.

793
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,717
You'll thank me for it.
Trust me.

794
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,653
I'm gonna need another beer.

795
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:38,821
Fucking right!

796
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:41,891
You better be
a man of your word.

797
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,900
So I can?

798
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:52,935
Em?

799
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:54,503
No, stop. I can't do it.

800
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:55,271
No. What? No.

801
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:57,707
Okay, you're fucking
killing me right now.

802
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,008
Go. Go.

803
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,945
Em wears pads.

804
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:04,914
Yeah, like for her

805
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,316
period or whatever?
I mean, so what?

806
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:07,917
Oh, my god.

807
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:10,119
See, this is what I'm talking about.
That's all they fucking do.

808
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:12,021
They just talk about
tampons and shit.

809
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:14,957
The fact that she wears
pads in meaningless.

810
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:17,627
Okay, so the deal if off.
It's fine.

811
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:20,897
But why she wears pads...
Oh, my god.

812
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:23,866
They don't fit!

813
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:28,871
They don't fit. I can't wear tampons
because I can't get them in.

814
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:32,975
What...

815
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,543
I mean, that's...

816
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,812
That's pretty cool.
'Cause like...

817
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:39,849
I mean, that must
mean you're really

818
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,250
tight.

819
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,921
Which is super dope.

820
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:47,290
Right?

821
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:49,625
Thank you, but it is
definitely not dope.

822
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:52,528
I don't mean to
be graphic, but...

823
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:54,964
Have you...

824
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,766
You all, like, tried to help?

825
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,200
Yeah, we like, tried one day.

826
00:48:58,202 --> 00:48:59,001
That's what girlfriends are for.

827
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:01,103
I cannot believe we're
having this conversation.

828
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:05,408
I have yet to conduct
a very thorough search party.

829
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,179
I can help.

830
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,314
Of course you can.

831
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:12,949
I'm dead serious.

832
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:13,683
I can help.

833
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:16,786
Everybody should know
their bodies inside and out.

834
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,321
Found your purpose in life.

835
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:20,856
Dude, I think you're
absolutely right.

836
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:22,892
I will conduct
my own search party

837
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:25,328
- whenever I damn please.
- Yeah!

838
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,963
Aye, aye, captain.

839
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:29,231
Buried gold
in them there waters.

840
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,969
Just waiting to be found.

841
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,978
Oh, shit.

842
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,116
Speaking of finding gold.

843
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,720
Forgot I had these.

844
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,290
I was going to propose a little

845
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,158
sunset trip.

846
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,161
What do you think?
Too late.

847
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,799
Uh, I'm good, brother.

848
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,202
Don't think I can
be any happier.

849
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:09,205
All right guys, no worries.

850
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,706
I'll, um...

851
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,009
I'll do it with you.

852
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,749
Why not?

853
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,652
Right. Yeah. Sure, of course.

854
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:26,389
What is she doing?

855
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:40,069
I...

856
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,571
You've obviously never
rolled with Aiden before.

857
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:45,107
- Shut up.
- What? What's up?

858
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,314
I'd like to say
a little something

859
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,883
before taking it.

860
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:58,320
I'm more ceremonial.

861
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,129
Does that sound weird?

862
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,834
It sounds nice.

863
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,536
Okay.

864
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,442
You guys will be missed.

865
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,911
But, with us in spirit.

866
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,646
Yes, we are.

867
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,314
Or we will.

868
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,153
I don't want to get too

869
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:33,789
carried away
or anything but, uh...

870
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:42,264
Thank you for joining me.

871
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,403
Don't I get to say something?

872
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,073
Yeah, sorry.

873
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,012
Sorry, Emily.

874
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:59,548
You can look at all the planets,

875
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,952
or colleges, that you like,

876
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,288
but you will never find
what we have.

877
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,257
You three

878
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,162
are my everything.

879
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,832
I love you guys.

880
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,734
I love you.

881
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:24,173
Thank you
for letting me join you.

882
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,359
There's no turning back now.

883
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,661
I'm jealous.

884
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,730
This is my favorite part.

885
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:50,432
Why? What do you mean?

886
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,668
The sweet anticipation.

887
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,036
Exactly.

888
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,739
- I don't know about that.
- I actually think

889
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:58,340
the most fun part
about it is that

890
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,944
it gives me just
insane staminance.

891
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,246
Are you fucking serious?

892
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,447
I literally...
I can't come on it.

893
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,850
- Oh, thank you for that.
- I can't.

894
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,185
Staminance?

895
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:11,554
Staminance, yeah.

896
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:13,355
- Okay.
- What?

897
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,757
You're over buzzed.

898
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:15,257
Why am I...

899
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:17,860
How is that hopeless?
That's staminance.

900
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,130
The fuck?

901
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,000
Emily asked if I'm ready.

902
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,336
Hell, no.

903
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,539
I mean,

904
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:34,510
throw a whole bunch of scared
shitless, confused kids

905
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,011
into a brand new world.

906
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:40,282
And, oh, yeah, let's make
sure they're totally alone.

907
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:45,221
I mean, whose fucking
great idea was that?

908
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,392
That's why
I'm taking it so hard.

909
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,231
I'm scared too.

910
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,300
Yeah, we all are.

911
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,035
You're scared?

912
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,570
Of course.

913
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,739
Never seen you scared.

914
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:06,408
You're the toughest girl know.

915
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,444
Really?

916
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:09,678
Yeah.

917
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,682
I always assumed you thought
I was kind of a nerd?

918
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:14,650
A nerd?

919
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:18,520
I voted you most likely to succeed.
We all did.

920
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:22,258
I... I think we're all
just nervous about

921
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,761
leaving home and
starting something new.

922
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,263
- But...
- But

923
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,299
that's also
the coolest part about it.

924
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:31,667
Exactly.

925
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,403
The thing
that makes it terrifying,

926
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:39,375
is the same thing that
makes it fucking awesome.

927
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:43,112
I mean, we get to
get out of here

928
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,015
and start all over.

929
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,550
That's just it, though.

930
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,654
I really like this.

931
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,890
I really liked it here.

932
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,193
Shit, I...

933
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,728
I love this.

934
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,263
We all do.

935
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,265
Speak for yourself.

936
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,434
We all do. Even Jen.

937
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,170
But this isn't going anywhere.

938
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,505
We are.

939
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,508
All I know,

940
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:16,912
or knew, anyway...

941
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:22,151
But it seemed a little less
horrible with my best friend there.

942
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:24,853
Maybe that makes me a coward.

943
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,432
<i>It's a precious
and fragile thing,</i>

944
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:38,634
<i>someone counting on you.</i>

945
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,071
<i>You were always there
for everyone, dad.</i>

946
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,440
Oscar.

947
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:46,875
Oscar...

948
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:49,378
<i>Weren't you afraid
of letting them down?</i>

949
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,247
- Hmm?
- Let me get another.

950
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,257
No.

951
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,794
There's... there aren't...
There's no more, man.

952
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,898
Nope. Gone.
All right.

953
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,834
I'm gonna get some more.

954
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:14,703
You should grab me one.

955
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,112
- What's up?
- So, what's up?

956
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:25,214
Can I at least sit on the couch?

957
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,021
<i>I would give my life
for these guys.</i>

958
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,158
<i>But that's easy
to say, isn't it?</i>

959
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,493
Don't get too close, Oscar.

960
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:43,899
I don't know what you're
about to do to me.

961
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:45,834
<i>If I'm being honest,</i>

962
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:47,536
<i>I'm not sure I'd do a great job</i>

963
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:49,204
<i>of actually putting their lives,</i>

964
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:52,141
<i>their hopes and
dreams before mine.</i>

965
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,476
<i>Am I supposed to?</i>

966
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:55,811
<i>Did you?</i>

967
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,048
I guess

968
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,617
my brain knows.

969
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:02,484
But my heart still sees

970
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,887
my parents like I did
when I was a little kid

971
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,722
and I kind of love that.

972
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:08,791
Really?

973
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,094
I'm jealous.

974
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:15,697
Wait, what're we
talking about here, what?

975
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,734
The punch-the-gut moment

976
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:21,270
when you realize
your parents are

977
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,473
flawed and screwed up
human beings

978
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:26,742
just like everybody else.

979
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:29,545
It's brutal.

980
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,582
It's really like
a moment though?

981
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:35,651
I feel like...

982
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:38,921
I feel like it's more
like a process.

983
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:41,924
Like a... like a
rite of passage.

984
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,859
You know, like...

985
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,862
Like every kid has
to go through it.

986
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,898
Not every kid.

987
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,606
I've never really
thought about it before.

988
00:57:58,107 --> 00:57:59,341
But

989
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,344
maybe I just discovered the one

990
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:04,580
beautiful thing about my dad,

991
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:06,748
passing away when he did.

992
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,153
In my eyes,

993
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,156
my dad is perfect.

994
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,593
It's the only way
I ever saw him.

995
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:21,497
And it's the only way
I will ever see him.

996
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,400
My dad will always be perfect.

997
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,737
He is perfect, man.

998
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:34,743
Well, for me it was a moment.

999
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:37,946
One moment.

1000
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,283
It was the day after
my 16th birthday and

1001
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:44,019
I was still sad
the night before 'cause

1002
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,755
my dad got in yet another fight

1003
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:49,558
with his flavor of the
month girlfriend and

1004
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,461
basically ruined my birthday.

1005
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:58,667
He whispered something to
her at the restaurant and

1006
00:58:58,669 --> 00:58:59,835
the next thing I knew,

1007
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:01,336
she stormed out.

1008
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:07,943
You know, it was actually a
thrill to see the bitch go.

1009
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,514
But even though he stayed,

1010
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,486
he wasn't really there.

1011
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,523
His mind and his heart

1012
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:24,426
were clearly somewhere else.

1013
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,965
And maybe I'm being like,

1014
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:31,400
a bit selfish,

1015
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:35,470
but I sort of thought that

1016
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,839
his mind and his heart

1017
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:40,842
should be on his
16-year-old daughter.

1018
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,450
But the actual fight wasn't...

1019
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,087
The...

1020
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,525
The punch, it was the next day,

1021
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,429
when I asked my dad
what had happened,

1022
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:04,366
turns out, he said to her,

1023
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:12,608
"you are the most beautiful
woman in this restaurant."

1024
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:21,750
And before pouring her wine
on him and storming out,

1025
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:23,919
she said,

1026
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:29,858
"how dare you look at every
other woman in here."

1027
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,464
Wow.
Yeah.

1028
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:37,099
Wow.

1029
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,771
And in that moment...

1030
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,073
I asked myself,

1031
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,074
"what kind of person..."

1032
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:49,745
Can actually say
something like that? No.

1033
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,183
"What kind of person

1034
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,121
"would date a person

1035
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,392
"who would say that?"

1036
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:09,698
That was like

1037
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,536
a gut punch.

1038
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,078
Yeah.

1039
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,951
What are you doing?

1040
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:31,753
What are you doing?

1041
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:34,890
I don't know.
You made me cry.

1042
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,228
Thanks.

1043
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,071
Thanks.

1044
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,506
Gonna miss you guys.

1045
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,043
Honestly.

1046
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,645
Hmm.

1047
01:01:56,647 --> 01:01:57,779
I never thought

1048
01:01:57,781 --> 01:02:01,717
I would hear those words
from your mouth.

1049
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,385
I know.

1050
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:06,555
Who are you?
It feels heart.

1051
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,864
Oh, no, I was going to, um...

1052
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:17,833
Ah, sorry, I thought...

1053
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,237
Are you in a hurry to get back?

1054
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,458
Get good grades.

1055
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,729
Get your
extra-curriculars going.

1056
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,866
Get sat tutors.

1057
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:54,870
Get good sat scores.
Get into a good school.

1058
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:57,973
I just realized the entire
purpose of my life so far

1059
01:02:57,975 --> 01:03:00,408
is been to get into college.

1060
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,244
That's true.

1061
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:06,114
And what do we do now?

1062
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:06,882
What do we do

1063
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:10,585
now that we've done the thing we've
spent our entire life doing.

1064
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:17,959
I guess we do the next thing we'll
spend our entire life doing.

1065
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,431
So, I guess in a way
our first life is over?

1066
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,203
I guess it is.

1067
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,139
Any regrets?

1068
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:38,980
Who's got time for should have,
would have, could haves?

1069
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,197
Em...

1070
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,071
I am not your type, I get it.

1071
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:04,506
Em...

1072
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,045
You're beautiful.

1073
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,714
You're smart.

1074
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,818
You're every guy's type.

1075
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,922
Not every guy's.

1076
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,128
I think you're amazing.
I... I just...

1077
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,573
So if my first life

1078
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:41,209
is over and my next life
starts tomorrow,

1079
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:45,380
that kind of means
this didn't happen, right?

1080
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:49,851
A monkey can type <i>Hamlet.</i>

1081
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:52,454
I guess that whole
space-time continuum theory

1082
01:04:52,456 --> 01:04:54,823
can make this moment disappear.

1083
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,126
Wait... what moment?

1084
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,562
What?

1085
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:10,805
You know I was thinking of trying to
get laid before going to college.

1086
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,708
Yeah, I kind of
figured that out.

1087
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:16,378
I was thinking it could be you.

1088
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,546
Kind of figured that out too.

1089
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,327
It's magical, isn't it?

1090
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,829
Yes, it is.

1091
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:10,465
It's a perfect...

1092
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,867
Chill spot, right?

1093
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:14,269
That's exactly
what I was going to say.

1094
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:17,372
Didn't know anybody else
used that term.

1095
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:25,146
Right tribe,
and the right chill spot.

1096
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,750
That's all you need.

1097
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,229
How long have I been
rubbing this peach?

1098
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,448
Fuck it!
Come on, staminence!

1099
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,184
Let's see how amazing
you really are.

1100
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,820
What? What?

1101
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,390
Are you coming or not?

1102
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:11,092
With you?
Yeah, let's go.

1103
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,562
Oh, yeah!
Go!

1104
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:15,263
Fuck, yeah!

1105
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:16,965
- Okay.
- And bring a blanket.

1106
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:18,099
Move, please.

1107
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:19,934
Have fun storming the castle.

1108
01:07:19,936 --> 01:07:23,071
- Hurry up, staminence.
- Coming.

1109
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,441
Look at this.

1110
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:29,511
Incredible.

1111
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,585
I can't believe
this is happening.

1112
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,743
Kissing you feels...

1113
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:38,279
I'm sorry, I know it's not...

1114
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,281
amazing.

1115
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:41,649
What?

1116
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,486
I think you're amazing.

1117
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,090
What?

1118
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:52,527
How did I not see it before?

1119
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,897
How did I not see you?

1120
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,835
I think you're beautiful.

1121
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,314
Ridiculous. Um...

1122
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:18,553
I guess good old-fashioned
missionary for me.

1123
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,290
I know, I know.
It's pretty boring

1124
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:24,592
as far as that stuff goes.

1125
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,191
Is this really happening?

1126
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:57,692
Yeah.

1127
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,828
Is it boring enough for you?

1128
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,767
It's the perfect amount
of boring.

1129
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,485
Purple, chicken and waffles...
Uh-huh.

1130
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:25,053
<i>Shakedown street.</i>

1131
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:27,355
<i>Dead poet society...</i>
Oh, and... Okay.

1132
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:30,091
<i>Sixteen candles, the big
Lebowski, dazed and confused,</i>

1133
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:31,593
<i>Annie hall, groundhog day...</i>
Uh-huh.

1134
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:33,161
<i>One flew over the cuckoo's nest,</i>

1135
01:10:33,163 --> 01:10:34,529
<i>it's a wonderful life.</i>
Right.

1136
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,397
<i>Toy story, stand by me.</i>

1137
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,667
<i>Breakfast club, fight club...</i>

1138
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:40,668
I just...

1139
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,770
I could never pick just one.

1140
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:44,572
So, yeah, uh...

1141
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,208
Oh, and...

1142
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,478
Being on top.

1143
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,047
I, uh...

1144
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:55,316
I haven't seen that one.

1145
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:57,552
It's not a movie.

1146
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:01,689
Okay.

1147
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,463
I don't ever want this to end.

1148
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,369
Oh, my god, it's not going
to end, is it?

1149
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:18,273
Oscar said it's really
hard to come on ecstasy.

1150
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:20,675
I mean, normally...

1151
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:22,176
I would have been coming by now.

1152
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:25,413
Normally, I... I should be
coming, you know.

1153
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:28,983
But I'm not going to.

1154
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,959
I'm so grateful for that.

1155
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:46,467
I'm just so grateful for you.

1156
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,737
And for everything.

1157
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,775
I'm just so fucking
full of gratitude.

1158
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,780
You were my answer,

1159
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:00,081
Serena.

1160
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,119
Jesse asked us

1161
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:07,722
what would
make this day perfect.

1162
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:10,224
You said having sex with me?

1163
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,829
No.

1164
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,966
I said, "telling you..."

1165
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:22,537
Telling me what?

1166
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:28,843
That I've loved you for...

1167
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,145
Well, forever.

1168
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,818
Pardon my manners.

1169
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,792
<i>So, maybe I was wrong.</i>

1170
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:21,729
<i>Maybe when it's real love,</i>

1171
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,466
<i>the falling-in-love part
never ends.</i>

1172
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,404
You, um, want to head back?

1173
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,105
Yeah.

1174
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,449
Oscar was right.

1175
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,318
Not a bad day.

1176
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,362
75.

1177
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,767
What's that?

1178
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,670
75 is

1179
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:39,707
the miles from Berkeley
to Santa Cruz.

1180
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:43,945
75 is the miles

1181
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:47,949
I will drop everything
and drive whenever you need.

1182
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:53,454
75 is the miles I hope you'll
drive whenever I need you.

1183
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:57,091
Of course.

1184
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:00,428
75 miles is nothing.

1185
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:03,197
You won't be alone.

1186
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,009
75 miles is nothing.

1187
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,219
Good day, man.

1188
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,101
- Hi.
- Hi.

1189
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:40,981
Uh, can I have my shirt?

1190
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:44,885
Um, yeah. Yeah.

1191
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,422
Thank you.

1192
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,709
I'm going to go.

1193
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:23,030
<i>I wish you could see this.</i>

1194
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:26,600
<i>Wish you could see them.</i>

1195
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:31,605
<i>I wish you could see me.</i>

1196
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,157
<i>Who am I?</i>

1197
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:58,732
<i>I'm your son.</i>
