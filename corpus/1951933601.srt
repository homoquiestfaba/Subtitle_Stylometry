1
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,754
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,659
I am Max the Magnificent,

3
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,688
and tonight,
you'll be truly astounded.

4
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:55,265
Here you see two ordinary,
unattached rings.

5
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,571
Yes? But watch.

6
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,146
And now I will magically
unattach them.

7
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,796
I must have forgot
to say the magic words.

8
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,662
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

9
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,827
should they return,
that all depends.

10
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,839
Who is this mortal
that dare utter those words?

11
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:32,139
And now for my next trick,
I need an ordinary, empty

12
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,174
hat.

13
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,888
Bravo.

14
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,092
I am coming, my children.

15
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,297
And now I shall make
this celery disappear.

16
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,902
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

17
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,411
should they return,
that all depends.

18
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,447
Those cursed words again!

19
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,052
Listen, pest-head.

20
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,859
Told you not
to use my camera.

21
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,363
Ow!

22
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,569
I meant to do that.

23
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,400
What a clumsy dork.

24
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,776
You're such a dope.

25
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,509
I'd saw you in half, but then
I'd have two dopey brothers.

26
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,141
<i>From the light of Earth,</i>
<i>the dark descends,</i>

27
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,742
<i>should they return,</i>
<i>that all depends.</i>

28
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,753
Wait until YouTube
gets a load of this.

29
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,186
No.

30
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,279
Mom!

31
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:56,025
Where's my other magic cape?
This one got torn.

32
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,723
If it's a magic cape, then
why doesn't it fly up here?

33
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,393
If that's a brain in there,
then why doesn't it work?

34
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,628
What?

35
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,035
Mom? Where's my other magic cape?
You know, the good one?

36
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,080
Yes, I heard you.
It's downstairs in the dryer.

37
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,584
Put the finishing touches on your
magic trunk, O Max the Magnificent.

38
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,245
What happened to
Max the Greatest?

39
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,222
Let's start with Magnificent
and work our way up, okay?

40
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,723
Thanks, Mom.

41
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,026
Hey, Buster.
Come here, Buster.

42
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,055
Come on, Buster. Sit. Sit.

43
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,826
Lie down. Roll over?

44
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,265
Speak?

45
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,868
Please?

46
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,807
You wanna go outside?

47
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,037
Yeah. You know that one,
don't you?

48
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,652
Why doesn't he use the doggie door?
It's right there.

49
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,415
I'm working on it.

50
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,817
Max. I just put up
a new net.

51
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,291
Colin and I are gonna shoot some
hoops, then we're gonna go for a run.

52
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,487
You should join us, buddy.

53
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,497
The only time noodle-leg runs
is when I'm chasing him.

54
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,965
Hey. I can't risk
a leg injury.

55
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,664
There's a dance after
the Halloween Talent Show,

56
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:16,334
and I don't wanna disappoint all the
lucky girls who begged me for a shot.

57
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,274
No girls talk to you.

58
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,707
Hey. Yesterday, I asked a girl
to go to the dance with me,

59
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,613
and she said no.

60
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,481
I call that talking.

61
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:39,923
Look. I know you're not great
at basketball or any sports.

62
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,127
But maybe you should get out there
and pump up a couple of shots.

63
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,726
Practice.

64
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,365
After dinner, Dad, I'm gonna
practice my magic a little more,

65
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,069
because I want my act
to be the best in the show.

66
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,113
I'll tell you about magic.
You know the best magic there is?

67
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,341
Colin remembering to flush.

68
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,046
Okay. It's somebody
sawing someone in half.

69
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,178
Yeah, anybody can
saw someone in half.

70
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,156
Yeah. But you have to
put them back together again.

71
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,350
Magic.

72
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,920
Real magic is passing the three-mile
mark, and you're hardly breathing heavy.

73
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:15,559
Magic's catching a tight spiral
pass on your fingertips for a TD

74
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,731
or scoring a three-point shot right
at the buzzer to win the big game.

75
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,433
Pure magic.

76
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,302
So, you know, sports.
That's what I'm getting at.

77
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,846
You should get out there
and mix it up with the guys.

78
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,747
Dad? If I hurt
this magic wand hand,

79
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,082
it'll be a disappointing
blow to all my fans.

80
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,711
So, it's not for me.

81
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,552
I owe it to them
to not shoot baskets,

82
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,754
or run or jump or lift
or crunch or curl or...

83
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,855
So, anything that doesn't have to
do with those, I'll be glad to do.

84
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,799
Okay, well, if you
change your mind, buddy.

85
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,135
Come here, Buster.

86
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,541
So, cape's in the dryer?

87
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,741
That's where it's at.

88
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,115
Honey, would you change out
of your good shirt for me?

89
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,654
Don't we wanna
keep that one nice?

90
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,989
Or I could just iron it again.

91
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,327
So, I'm gonna head
there right now.

92
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,298
Sweetie, could you take all the clothes
out of the dryer, not just your cape?

93
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,597
Okay. Come on, Buster.

94
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,979
You know, I should've said,

95
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,680
"Anyone could throw,
shoot and make baskets,

96
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,349
"but not everyone
can do magic."

97
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,858
Hey. What you got there, boy?

98
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,066
What you got here?

99
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,328
Last week, it was those
cool magic words,

100
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,963
you know, "From the light
of Earth, the dark descends"?

101
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,336
Dog spit.

102
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,835
Don't you ever swallow?

103
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,470
You're like Grandma
on Thanksgiving.

104
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,477
Para... Paranormal?

105
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,457
Don't

106
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,128
scream.

107
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,992
Okay. Okay.

108
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,664
Am I a man or a mouse?

109
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,335
I do like cheese.

110
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,769
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

111
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,610
No, no, no.

112
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,477
No, no, no. No!

113
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,635
Me. Just me. Okay.

114
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,654
Here! Here, don't hurt me!
Here! Take my dog! Take my dog!

115
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,094
You can take him.

116
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:41,469
Pants. Shirts. Underwear?

117
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,906
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

118
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,681
Has to be mice.
Has to be mice.

119
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,524
Mom? Dad?

120
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,866
We have mice with
really big hands!

121
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,043
Colin, knock it off.
It's your brother.

122
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,379
That's twice
as horrible.

123
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,021
I am angered.

124
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,590
Mr. and Mrs. Roland have
been banished for eternity.

125
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:19,366
But their children,
Nicky and Tara, are still out there.

126
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,805
If they have knowledge of the
chant, the expulsion spell,

127
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:27,005
and if they find the Cast Away Ring,
whose stone has the light of three suns,

128
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,139
they could banish us
to the depths of the Earth.

129
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,274
My children, please.

130
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:38,187
I realize you are in eternal pain,
but just try, please, to walk it off.

131
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:45,264
Now, there is a magician,
Max the Magnificent.

132
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:49,131
You should see his ring trick.
It's really something to behold.

133
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:54,366
He lives in this house and
he has knowledge of the chant.

134
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,307
Have Tara and Nicky
confided in him?

135
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,970
Are they working together?

136
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:04,846
I must destroy
Tara and Nicky.

137
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,416
What, Frank?

138
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,787
Question?

139
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,797
There are no questions.

140
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,062
Sorry!

141
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,536
Follow me!

142
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,808
Please try to keep up
and stop moaning.

143
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,787
Five days from now,
on Halloween night,

144
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,324
when I have
my full powers,

145
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,452
this wall will come down,

146
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,621
and we will be free.

147
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,289
Free.

148
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:58,701
And if Max the Magnificent
dares to stand in our way,

149
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:02,172
then he too
will be destroyed.

150
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,002
Please, Frank.

151
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,110
Sorry.

152
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:19,156
Tara? Nicky?

153
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,750
I will find you.

154
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,135
Oh, man.

155
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,002
Nicky, why is it so cold?

156
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,137
It wasn't cold when
we left the house.

157
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,841
And it's Halloween.

158
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,751
What happened to
the Fourth of July?

159
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,686
You sure we're in Plover?

160
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,520
Of course.
I recognize everything.

161
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:58,120
And then again,
I feel so different.

162
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,627
Hey, excuse me! Can you
help us? Hey! Excuse me.

163
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,298
That was rude.

164
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,971
Hey! My sister Tara
was talking to you!

165
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,453
Oh, look, Ms. Wright!
Ms. Wright!

166
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,647
Ms. Wright!

167
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,622
Ms. Wright! Ms. Wright!
Over here!

168
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,852
No!

169
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,792
Did you see what
just happened to us?

170
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:33,957
Uh-huh.

171
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:38,697
Stuff like this only
happens in movies and TV to...

172
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,096
To ghosts!

173
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,408
We can't be ghosts.
We are not ghosts.

174
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:54,646
No one can hear us.
And a car just drove through us.

175
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:56,912
No!

176
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,418
Ghost!

177
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,519
Ghost!

178
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,063
Ghost!

179
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,861
I can't see you!

180
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,493
I can't see you!

181
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:20,334
Hey, guys? I'm making a shopping list.
Where's the celery?

182
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,939
It's the fourth bunch this week.
Last week it was carrots.

183
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,110
Why don't you ask Max,
the Munching Magician?

184
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,982
It just disappear?

185
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,792
Well, I am magic.
Things just happen.

186
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,222
Speaking of weird things, anybody
hear mice scratching on the walls?

187
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,200
They aren't mice.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

188
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,600
A hand came through
the basement wall.

189
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,371
Look, mice don't
have hands.

190
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,208
Well, then the wall
has hands.

191
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,543
Colin, does that
make any sense?

192
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,379
All right. After school,
I'll go down there and check it out.

193
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:03,046
You? You're afraid
of any weird sound.

194
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,558
The next weird sound you're gonna
hear, me ripping your ear off.

195
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:11,719
Okay. No more ripping
ear sounds at the table.

196
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,358
Honey, move your backpack
before somebody trips over it.

197
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,828
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

198
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,636
should they return,
that all depends.

199
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,371
You've said that about a thousand
times. Where'd you get it?

200
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,743
I read it on something
Buster found.

201
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,545
I figured it's some sort
of awesome magic chant.

202
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,210
But there is more.

203
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,015
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

204
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,921
should they return,
that all depends when hands.

205
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,619
When hands? That's it?

206
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,957
Well, that's all Buster found.

207
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:46,922
Dork.

208
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,365
Buster is not a dork.

209
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,130
No, I think he meant
you're the dork.

210
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,163
Hey.

211
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,105
He said it, I didn't.
Get your bag.

212
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,469
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

213
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,514
should they return,
that all depends.

214
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,777
Yeah, I did it!

215
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,146
It's full of books. Okay,
it's top-heavy, you dweeb.

216
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,281
That's the reason
why it fell.

217
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,554
Max, pick your bag
up with your hands.

218
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,867
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Max.

219
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,403
Colin, big guy.
Dad.

220
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,701
I see you're in a cape.
Again.

221
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,970
Yep. Breaking it in
for the talent show.

222
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,341
But how long does it take you
to break something in?

223
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,473
I mean, you've been flapping around
in that thing for over a week.

224
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,076
It's not like when Colin got his
new football helmet on his head.

225
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,212
Now, that's something
worth breaking in.

226
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,722
The helmet
or his head?

227
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,319
You know, it's not just a talent show
Halloween night. There's also a dance.

228
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,523
You're on the committee.
I volunteered you.

229
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,365
Cha-cha? Come on.
Get it. Get it.

230
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,836
This has to be
child abuse.

231
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,396
I'd rather eat
my own underwear.

232
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,271
You know how,
with the snake...

233
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,903
Okay. I'm gonna go
take a shower.

234
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,846
And then, I'm gonna take my
athletic son to the doctor

235
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,281
to check out the ankle he
tweaked running yesterday.

236
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,012
Gotta be in shape
for football practice.

237
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,179
Right on, dude?
Got you.

238
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,384
Okay, Colin,
go get dressed.

239
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,060
He isn't limping.

240
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,300
Hmm.

241
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,442
Oh, glory, glory, glory.

242
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,839
Does anybody
hear that?

243
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,510
Yeah, it's the bus.
Hurry up, babe, you're gonna be late.

244
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,089
Max!
Don't forget your jacket!

245
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,161
Don't forget
your backpack!

246
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,702
Don't forget
your pants!

247
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,180
Hey!

248
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,739
What a bozo.

249
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,600
How is the great magician,
Max-o the Lame-o?

250
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,370
Oh, Billy. What a treat.

251
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,378
Thought you didn't
take the bus.

252
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,743
We moved.

253
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,508
Great.

254
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,984
So now I can get beat up on the way
to school instead of during school.

255
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,782
It'll save me healing time.

256
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:02,657
You know, I think I'll beat you
up going to and during school.

257
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,629
Thanks.
You're so welcome.

258
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,894
Well, being threatened
sure gives me an appetite.

259
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,268
I do magic.

260
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,231
Now you see it.

261
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,867
Now you don't.

262
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,917
That's it. I've had
enough of your bullying!

263
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,352
What did you say?

264
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,687
Can't get enough
of your bullying?

265
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,675
I was just kidding.

266
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,412
I thought our history teacher was
trying to hitch a ride, you know?

267
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,818
Yeah? Yeah?

268
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,684
So, Traci, are you serious
about your parents grounding you?

269
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,914
I guess.

270
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,321
I mean, I can't believe I got
a D in yesterday's science test.

271
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:44,192
I studied in between texting
until midnight the day before.

272
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,057
Oh, my gosh.

273
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,430
No way!
H2O stands for water?

274
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,992
I thought it meant
"Hi to All of You."

275
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,096
Maybe you spend
too much time texting.

276
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,664
Seriously, why would
you say that?

277
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,527
And now, let's see if I can
get my lovely assistant

278
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,468
to step back into
my magic trunk.

279
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,219
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

280
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,188
should they return,
that all depends.

281
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,260
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

282
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,357
should they return,
that all depends.

283
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,413
Hey, Traci. You know,
I was wondering,

284
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,983
how would you like to be
the assistant in my magic...

285
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,164
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

286
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,936
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

287
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,415
Hey, Traci!

288
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,476
Yeah?

289
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,579
Hey.

290
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,683
I was wondering if you...

291
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,852
What?

292
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,453
I was...
See you later, Max.

293
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,022
Wait! Wait, wait! Wait!

294
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,499
Hey, guys.

295
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,371
Were you gonna
talk to Traci?

296
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,067
It's my right as
an American citizen.

297
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,671
I hereby waive
all my rights.

298
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,111
Man, I'd mop
the floor with you,

299
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,614
but I think this will
do you more damage.

300
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,779
She's not gonna talk to you
after she sees this, loser.

301
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,788
Hey, Traci! Come see
the king of the losers.

302
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,453
Max?

303
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,991
Present.

304
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,960
I see you!
I can see you!

305
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,631
Where'd we go?

306
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:17,900
We're home!

307
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,102
Our house!

308
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,345
Mom and Dad will know
what's happening.

309
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,084
Or will they?

310
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,488
No one can see
or hear us.

311
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,917
We're ghosts.

312
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,290
This is bad, Nicky,
really bad.

313
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,288
Well...

314
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,695
Look on the bright side.

315
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,164
We were never able
to do this before.

316
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:52,937
Nicky!

317
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,237
And here's something
else I found out.

318
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,909
If you concentrate kind of
hard, you can use your hands.

319
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,718
That's weird.
My hat just fell off.

320
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,316
Don't bother people.
She didn't do anything to you.

321
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,690
Tara!

322
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,559
Concentrate! Go for it.

323
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,100
I didn't know
you were bald.

324
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,578
Well, I paid a lot of money
for you not to know that.

325
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,144
Now see what you did?
You ruined this guy's whole night.

326
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,817
Me? You're the one
who told me to do it.

327
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:44,259
Now, stop having fun.
This is serious.

328
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,229
Yes, sir, Mom.

329
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,471
If Mom and Dad can't see us, I
don't know what we're gonna do.

330
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,871
D-O-Y-L-E.

331
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,411
Our name isn't Doyle.
It's Roland.

332
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,338
Well, this is our
house, isn't it?

333
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,247
It's our address.

334
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,308
That's our tree.

335
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,878
This is really scaring me.
Daddy, Mommy!

336
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,496
This could be
a good game.

337
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,298
Okay.

338
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,798
Who are they?

339
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,503
Where's our furniture?

340
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,068
Mom, Dad!

341
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,446
Mommy! Daddy!
Where are you?

342
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,075
Mom! Dad!

343
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,279
Daddy, come out! Mama!
- Dad!

344
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,887
I am freaking out.

345
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,858
Let's nail these guys.

346
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,259
Who are you?

347
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,599
Colin, use your hands.

348
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,845
I usually do.
I must have fell.

349
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,208
My face is salty.

350
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,476
Dad?

351
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,649
Hey, don't do that
again, doofus.

352
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,812
Do what?

353
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,379
But you know what I mean.
The popcorn thing.

354
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,553
Colin, isn't it weird to eat
something the size of your own brain?

355
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:00,993
Hey. We're trying
to watch the game.

356
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,626
Dad, I forgot to ask,
what's paranormal?

357
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,170
It's easy.
It's two normals.

358
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,968
Okay, I'm betting everything
I've got that that's not right.

359
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,906
And you win.

360
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,878
Paranormal is the study of
ghosts and ghostly matters.

361
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,778
Some people have
a real talent for it.

362
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:21,876
So if I studied Colin, it would
be the study of para-not-normal?

363
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,126
Come on, buddy.
I'm trying to watch the game.

364
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:31,821
Dad?

365
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,891
We're not alone.

366
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,936
Of course we aren't.
Colin's right here.

367
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,497
Yeah. I mean behind me.

368
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,879
I don't see anyone.

369
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,082
He sees us!

370
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,589
You see us?

371
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,653
Uh-huh.

372
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:06,691
Okay, if you can hear us,
say weenie-weenie-weenie.

373
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,629
Weenie-weenie-weenie.

374
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:14,604
Yeah, right, that weenie could
bust your head open with one hand.

375
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:18,039
Where are our parents?

376
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,771
Who are your parents?

377
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,076
Buddy, they're your
grandpa and your grandma.

378
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,547
Come on now.

379
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,049
Why are you living here?

380
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,088
Why are we living here?

381
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,648
We got a good price.

382
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,991
And the people who moved out like
eight months ago, they just left.

383
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,189
Touchdown Vikings!
Nice!

384
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,290
Yes! Yes.

385
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,232
It must have been you guys I heard
this morning at the kitchen table,

386
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,501
you know, saying
"Glory, oh, glory, glory."

387
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:51,634
Lulu!

388
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,009
Halftime.
Bathroom break.

389
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,173
I got downstairs.

390
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,716
You had the closest
bathroom last time.

391
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,308
Race you to
go downstairs.

392
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,519
Lulu!

393
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:12,154
Oh, glory, glory,
where have you kids been?

394
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,927
I came back every day to make
breakfast, hoping you'd be here.

395
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,298
It's night though,
not breakfast time.

396
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,395
Life's been a little
strange lately.

397
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,939
This is Max.

398
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:27,910
So far, he's the only one
who can see and hear us.

399
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:31,813
Glory, glory.
So you can see us?

400
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,044
Yeah. Lucky me.

401
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,984
Would you like some eggs?

402
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:41,924
Sure. You probably make them better
than Mom, even though you are dead.

403
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,488
What happened to us?

404
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,862
How long have we been gone?

405
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,335
A year, maybe two.

406
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,168
Where'd we go?

407
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:00,142
I feel so weak.

408
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,975
Maybe I should
start working out.

409
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,312
This coming and going
takes a lot out of a person.

410
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,418
Your parents.
They found the tunnel.

411
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,550
They locked up
all the evil ghosts.

412
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:20,222
But Phears, he plans on letting
them all out on Halloween,

413
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,163
when he's at his full power.

414
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,133
You can't let him.

415
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,000
But we don't know
anything about a tunnel.

416
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,868
How do we get there?

417
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,171
Only the living can go
into the tunnel and return.

418
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,711
Only the living can help.

419
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,610
"Only the living"?

420
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,148
But we're ghosts.

421
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,844
I don't wanna be a ghost.

422
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,943
Can't hear you, honey.

423
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,421
I'm fading again.

424
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,654
Testing one, two,
three. Hello?

425
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,524
Are you this guy Phears?

426
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,690
No.

427
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,961
You seen a tunnel?
No.

428
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,060
And I don't know anything
about your parents.

429
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:03,403
I already have two, so I don't
need anybody else's driving me nuts.

430
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,637
Was that your dad and brother
in the living room?

431
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,110
Yeah. Why?

432
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,078
I'm asking the questions.

433
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:15,449
I'll show you what ghosts can do
if they don't get the right answers.

434
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,353
Yes!

435
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,496
Yes!
Yes! We did it!

436
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,507
What are you guys doing?
And where's all our furniture?

437
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,171
Uh-oh.

438
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,772
That's my mom.

439
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:50,185
Hey, everybody. I'm home.
Whoops, wrong house.

440
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:59,563
Okay. Confusing a confused mom,
that's got to be off-limits.

441
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,323
No.

442
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,799
From the light of Earth, the dark
descends, should they return...

443
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,633
Hey.

444
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,673
I've heard that before.

445
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,766
Yeah, well, the stupid chant's
gotta be good for something.

446
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,744
Where's our mom and dad?

447
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,280
I already told you,
I don't know!

448
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:21,307
Anyway, I'll help you. Just put
everything back the way it was.

449
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,920
Please!

450
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,251
Okay.
- Thanks.

451
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,556
No!

452
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,826
A Mom look?
You're giving me...

453
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,199
Doing it.

454
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:50,512
I just had the weirdest
déjà vu thing,

455
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,709
only I thought I was
in the wrong house.

456
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,445
You know, Mom,

457
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,889
I think Buster needs
to go for a walk.

458
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,151
He just went for a walk.

459
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:05,389
Well, I know, but he's been
drinking a lot of water today,

460
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,193
so he probably has to go.

461
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,000
And that way we all
can go for a walk.

462
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,334
I'm not going for a walk.
I just got home.

463
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,499
Well, I don't mean "we."

464
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,840
I mean we, us, we.

465
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,541
I mean... I don't know
what I mean.

466
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:25,707
Bye.

467
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,132
Nicky!

468
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,233
Thank you.
You're welcome.

469
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,301
Stop. How'd you like
to hit your head?

470
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,438
I can't.
It's impossible. Look.

471
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,026
You okay?

472
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,462
Yeah, I'm fine.

473
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,662
I remember the words. "The light
of Earth, the dark descends"?

474
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,397
I remember Dad saying them.

475
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,842
Whoa.

476
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,368
Anyway, I read them on a
piece of paper Buster dug up.

477
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,709
Where'd he find it?

478
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,078
In the backyard.

479
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:39,387
Maybe Mom and Dad left us a
note! We'll dig in the backyard.

480
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,755
I used to bury stuff
back there all the time.

481
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,487
Are you guys serious?

482
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,462
Who's gonna explain
the huge mess to my parents?

483
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,795
Don't worry. We always
clean up after our messes.

484
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,370
Almost always.

485
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,803
All right. Look.

486
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,306
If you guys have to dig,

487
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,173
can you please wait until
after my parents go to bed?

488
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:03,680
'Cause I don't want them seeing dirt
magically flying around in the backyard.

489
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,239
We'll wait in the garage.

490
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,444
I wanna dig.
Garage!

491
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,415
Okay, okay.

492
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,616
Thanks.
You're welcome.

493
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,455
Bye.

494
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,928
Bye.

495
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,026
Come on, Buster.

496
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,434
Great. All I wanted
was to do magic.

497
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,069
Now I've got ghosts!

498
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,876
I should have stuck
to raising hamsters.

499
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,783
What is it, boy?

500
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,186
Buster?

501
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,726
I was gonna say, "Let's
split," but this is ridiculous.

502
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:09,171
Max Doyle. Where are they?

503
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,643
They?

504
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:17,176
Do you think maybe we could
be a little more specific?

505
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,949
And who are you?

506
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,391
I am Phears,
the Animal Traveler.

507
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:30,295
Now, if you tell me
where they are,

508
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,734
I might let you live.

509
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,363
There you go
with that "they" again.

510
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:38,772
The children,
Tara and Nicky.

511
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,634
Oh.

512
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,178
That "they."

513
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,482
I'm afraid I don't know
anyone by that name. Sorry.

514
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,344
Max.

515
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,254
Would you like to see what
happens when I get angry?

516
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,985
No, thanks.

517
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,721
Well, check this out.

518
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:28,917
Next time I'll tell them
to make you feel the pain.

519
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:34,397
Tell Nicky and Tara that
their parents are gone for good

520
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:38,367
and that all of the ghosts
will soon be set free.

521
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,132
Okay. I'll tell them.

522
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,936
If you can tell them,
then you know where they are.

523
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,375
You cannot hide them
from me, Max.

524
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,140
We will meet again.

525
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,738
And if you tell anyone
that you've seen me,

526
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:55,843
my cape-dwelling friends
and I will haunt them

527
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,447
and make their
lives unlivable.

528
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,990
Understand?

529
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:04,391
Tell no one,
especially your parents.

530
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,589
I know where you live, Max.

531
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:11,624
When was the last time you saw
your parents grovel for mercy?

532
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,364
At my cousin Skeeter's
piano recital?

533
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,035
What?

534
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,531
Uh...

535
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,935
I mean, never!

536
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,045
I've never seen that happen. And
I really don't want to, Mr. Phears.

537
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:30,712
So I won't tell anybody.
No Mom, no Dad, no nobody.

538
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,558
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

539
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,060
should they return,
that all depends.

540
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,858
Don't ever say
those words again.

541
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,268
Buster? Did you
see any of that?

542
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,279
Or at least half of it?

543
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,716
Buster!

544
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,309
You're back, Buster.
You're back.

545
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,786
Oh, my gosh, you're back.

546
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:21,300
This Max the Magician has the
first part of Roland's chant,

547
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,636
the spell, our curse.

548
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,809
Take note. If Tara...

549
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,403
We have to find
Mom and Dad.

550
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,505
Or Nicky...

551
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,210
We have to find Mom and Dad.

552
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,411
Or Max...

553
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,852
I have to find
Buster's flea bath!

554
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:42,416
If any of these three brats
find the second part of the chant

555
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:48,227
and the Cast Away Ring, they will
send us to the depths of the Earth.

556
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:55,167
But I have a plan.

557
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,833
What if I could travel
amongst them?

558
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,971
Move about in secret,
disguised as one of them?

559
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,659
I must be certain
of what these kids know.

560
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,195
And I am going
to find out.

561
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,625
Hey, Max.

562
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,136
You know, if you'd spend
as much time jogging

563
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,570
as you did walking Buster,
you'd be a regular miler.

564
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:35,343
Anyway, Mom says the dinner/dance/talent
show is gonna be killer.

565
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,403
You're headlining, right?

566
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,416
Nicky's in your room.

567
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,184
Right?
Yeah.

568
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,247
Yeah. Yeah, headlights.

569
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:51,419
Yeah, that's me.
Deer caught in the headlights.

570
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,000
And I promise
I won't do anything

571
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,935
that'll make a monster haunt you
for the rest of your life. Yeah.

572
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,632
Well, that's considerate
of you.

573
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,173
We promise the
same thing, dear.

574
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:08,041
Yeah. And if Buster
splits open, it's okay.

575
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,774
It's a new trick
I taught him. Yeah.

576
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,247
Fetch would have been fine.

577
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,217
Well, I'm gonna go
to bed now. Good night.

578
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,547
Splits open?

579
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,793
Nicky, what are you
doing, man?

580
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,455
Your brother is weird.

581
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,829
He lip-synchs songs
into his web-cam.

582
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:30,991
Okay.

583
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:34,504
Let's not even get into what
he does with karaoke iTunes.

584
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,038
I didn't know ghosts slept.

585
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,239
Yeah. Being dead can
wear you out pretty fast.

586
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,782
What was that big box
your mom was working on?

587
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:51,312
My magic stuff. I'm gonna
use it in the show on Friday.

588
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,851
Tara told me
about Phears.

589
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:56,893
It's pretty weird he didn't
even notice she was behind him.

590
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,655
Well, everything's been
pretty weird lately.

591
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,492
Why should that
be any different?

592
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,794
Yeah, well,
I'm going to bed.

593
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,699
Nicky!

594
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,431
It's my old room.
I'll be good.

595
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,269
Are you sleeping
on the floor?

596
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:45,172
Well, this way I don't have
to make my bed in the morning.

597
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,742
All right.

598
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,680
So, I went out
shopping today.

599
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,242
I picked up this book on
wizards, shamans and sorcerers.

600
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,719
Mom!
Yeah.

601
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:59,377
Uh...

602
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,154
It looks kind of weird.

603
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,989
It does?

604
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,222
I thought the drawing
on the cover was cool.

605
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,456
Anyway.

606
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:11,627
This morning I got to thinking about
those magic words you're always saying.

607
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,034
What's interesting about
this book is that

608
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,562
there all kinds of expressions
and chants just like that in here.

609
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,439
Sounds like one of these
guys casting a spell,

610
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,002
a spell designed
to defeat evil.

611
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,681
Just thought maybe you could find some
more magic words for your act, you know.

612
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,876
Might be fun.

613
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,748
Mom?

614
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,348
Do you think you might wanna spend
the night in here tonight with me?

615
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,416
Honey, I haven't done that
since you were a baby.

616
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:41,453
Yeah, but don't you notice
something strange about the room?

617
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,499
You mean besides you wanting to sleep
on the floor instead of in your bed,

618
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:49,061
and your being in your school
clothes instead of in your pajamas?

619
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,401
No.

620
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,699
Oh, okay. Never mind. Sorry.

621
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,745
Honey, go brush your teeth,
get on your pj's.

622
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,837
Okay.

623
00:46:56,914 --> 00:47:00,441
Pancakes in the morning.
Sleep warm in your bed.

624
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,045
I love you.

625
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,646
Love you, too, Mom. Night.

626
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,354
Magic.

627
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,929
Ghosts. Demons?

628
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,492
Splitting dogs?

629
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,428
Why can't I just
be a normal kid

630
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,998
who only has to worry about
how many zits to cover up?

631
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,306
I've got to do this.

632
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:03,872
What?

633
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,927
Where's Tara?

634
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,280
Rise and shine.

635
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,016
Morning.

636
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,585
Did I startle you?

637
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,592
Oh, no.

638
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:54,062
Why would I be startled when the
first thing in the morning I see

639
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,622
is a head popping
out of a toilet?

640
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,765
Look.

641
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:03,204
I've given you guys my house, my
dog, my bedroom and even my bed.

642
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:07,172
So there's one place that has
to be off-limits, and this is it.

643
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,609
Okay.

644
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,874
Tara wanted me to tell you that
I went dirt-diving this morning,

645
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,508
and I couldn't find
any more pages.

646
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,676
Where is Tara?

647
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,913
Inside your computer.
What?

648
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:25,126
Hey, weren't you just in the...
Never mind.

649
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,161
Whoa!
<i>Hi, Max!</i>

650
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,464
<i>Hi, Nicky!</i>

651
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,331
Tada!

652
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,105
Morning.

653
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,203
When I woke up this morning,
I found this in your room.

654
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,976
Wow.
It's our mom and dad.

655
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,610
The book mentions all these
parapsychology websites.

656
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,553
So I decided to go
on the Internet.

657
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:56,786
No, I decided to go
in the Internet.

658
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,259
That's so awesome!

659
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,597
I was looking for anything
about my parents.

660
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:07,035
Being on the inside, I got into
pay sites and no-access files.

661
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,937
A classified studies file
at Duke University

662
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,909
mentioned that our parents were
writing a report there on...

663
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,672
That's the paper
I found.

664
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,611
This paper was never seen.

665
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:22,584
Something happened to our parents
before they got the chance to publish it.

666
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:28,181
It's titled <i>Transportation</i>
<i>of Evil Paranormal Entities.</i>

667
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,593
Paranormal entities,

668
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:35,791
like ghosts,
vampires and ghouls

669
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,132
and Phears!

670
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:43,467
Whoa. I bet it was never seen
because Phears tried to get rid of it.

671
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,769
Or your parents.

672
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:51,975
Tara?

673
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,114
I really miss
Mom and Dad.

674
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,414
Nicky.

675
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,660
You been in a toilet?

676
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,994
Yeah.

677
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,200
Have a good day, Max!

678
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:15,329
I will!

679
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,532
I'll bring your
magic trunk to school, honey.

680
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,472
Okay. Thanks!

681
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:22,512
We're staying close to home
in case Lulu comes back.

682
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,877
She might have
more to tell us.

683
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,779
Yeah, and I wanna
look for the tunnel.

684
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,546
When he finds it,
we need you.

685
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:33,111
Oh, yeah. 'Cause only a
living person can enter, right?

686
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:41,427
What? Scared?

687
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:42,988
You won't go
in the tunnel?

688
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,192
No.

689
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:48,135
It's just Billy. He's always punking
on me in front of the other kids.

690
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,400
What a bully.

691
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:55,275
Just once, I wish I could use magic to
send him into space during school time.

692
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,847
I can't pass this up.

693
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,010
Me neither.

694
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,318
Morning, loser.

695
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,991
Morning, Billy.

696
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,959
How do you like this?
You really like this.

697
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,459
Back into the computer!

698
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,559
Searching for the tunnel.

699
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,366
You're welcome. Bye.

700
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,778
Hey, Max. Can I talk
to you in private?

701
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,114
Yeah.

702
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:26,059
So I hear you're looking for
an assistant for your magic act.

703
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,331
I might say yes
to something like that.

704
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:31,499
You're talking to me?

705
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,442
About your assistant,
I mean, my assistant?

706
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,809
I mean, I'd love
to have you do it.

707
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,144
Calm down.
I said "might."

708
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:43,312
Well, what'll it take to
change "I might" to "I will"?

709
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:47,482
Well, first of all, you have to
promise not to hang around me too much.

710
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,617
It's not good for a senior to
be seen with an underclassman.

711
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,821
You got it. I promise.

712
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:58,129
Secondly, I want my name to be clearly
stated in all advertising materials.

713
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,260
And it has to be
the same size as yours.

714
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:01,827
Done.

715
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,702
And fourthly...
Thirdly.

716
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,365
Right. Thirdly,

717
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:09,071
I understand you're capable of dealing
with advanced senior science class.

718
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:12,137
And I might need your help
for a midterm paper.

719
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:15,184
Well, I'll be glad to help.
Anytime, anyplace.

720
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,241
Okay.

721
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,651
But remember, this is
advanced senior science class,

722
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,349
so it might get
a little tricky.

723
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:24,416
Let them trick away.
Don't forget, I'm Max the Magnificent.

724
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,824
That's so sweet of you.

725
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:32,027
Beauty is, you don't have to
water them. They're artificial.

726
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,832
I hope you don't have
artificial hay fever.

727
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,065
Okay. Rehearsal here
after school.

728
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,266
Got it.

729
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,569
Now I've gotta
get to class.

730
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,736
I'll walk with you.
Yeah.

731
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,573
Max?

732
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,813
I was looking for
something. Yeah.

733
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,612
You're so funny.
Yeah.

734
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,954
See you later.
See you later.

735
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,130
What were you two guys
doing down here?

736
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,825
Just some magic.

737
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,620
No tunnel there.
No tunnel anywhere.

738
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,968
You asked for it.

739
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,552
Oh, yeah!

740
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,521
Lulu said that only a living
person can enter the tunnel.

741
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:39,721
This must be it!

742
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:42,926
Tara!

743
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,767
Tara, come on!

744
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:54,942
What? I was in the computer tracing
all e-mails from Mom and Dad.

745
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,309
There's thousands
and thousands of them.

746
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,781
And I found something,
an e-mail from Dad to Mom.

747
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:07,380
A wizard or magician can rescue victims
banished as ghosts by the Lord of Evil.

748
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:10,585
Tara... A wizard or magician!
That's Max!

749
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,287
Every word
by the magician can...

750
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,693
Okay, okay. Tara...

751
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,699
Listen, okay? The tunnel, you know?
I found the tunnel.

752
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,894
Really? Where?

753
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,028
It's right here.
Come on.

754
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,305
See? Told you.

755
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,904
I'm trying to
hear what they're saying.

756
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,084
Nicky!

757
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,389
Come on!
No!

758
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,296
Whoa!

759
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,358
Uh-oh.

760
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,439
Come on.

761
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,207
Help me!

762
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,272
Couldn't you, like,
pull a little bit harder?

763
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,580
I'm trying.
I'm a little girl!

764
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,381
I'd like my head back.

765
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,183
I'm working on it.

766
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,355
Help me!
It's your head!

767
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,602
Would you come over here
and pick up my head, please?

768
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,003
All right.

769
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,612
Tara, where are you?

770
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,711
Your head's on backwards.

771
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,989
It's the tunnel, Nicky!

772
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:53,756
I'll get Max.

773
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,596
I don't think they're gonna
be very happy he's dropping in.

774
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,612
Well, hello.
How did you get out of your cage?

775
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,690
Smaller is scarier.

776
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,513
Max!
Yeah?

777
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:23,813
We found the tunnel.

778
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:26,047
Where?
Your basement.

779
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,488
They weren't mice.
They were paranormal things.

780
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,890
Yeah. And everything
Lulu told us was true.

781
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,588
Hey, Max. I thought that we'd
walk to rehearsal together.

782
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,857
Yeah.

783
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,938
Max, you have to go
into the tunnel.

784
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,770
Not now.
We'll talk later, okay?

785
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:49,471
Later? But we're trying
to find my mom and dad.

786
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,809
And who's she?
That's Traci,

787
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,373
my assistant.

788
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:58,781
Look, Tara. I need some
really cool magic stuff,

789
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:02,018
things flying,
disappearing, really awesome.

790
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,686
I wanna impress Traci, and I
want her to be really amazed.

791
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:14,833
So, everyone on your bus is talking
about how your magic pushed Billy around.

792
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:19,671
It was so simple. You see,
I just unleash my full magical

793
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,672
powers.

794
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,046
Let me explain.

795
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:31,075
See, I have a unique gift that allows
me to turn my face into a magnet.

796
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,946
I just used my face
to open that locker door.

797
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,627
I better demagnetize.

798
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,227
No more locker doors.

799
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,289
No more locker doors.

800
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,801
You know, Traci, after
the show there's a dance.

801
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,808
Oh, you wouldn't.
This old hag?

802
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,673
She's wearing
too much makeup.

803
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,303
No, she's not.

804
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,472
I'm not what?

805
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:02,008
Not going to
the dance alone.

806
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:04,280
No. That never happens.

807
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:07,720
Usually some jerk from the
football team invites me.

808
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:12,823
If you were free for just one
dance, then maybe you could...

809
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,333
That's cute.
Cat got your tongue?

810
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,598
Come on.
Let's go rehearse.

811
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:24,935
Yeah.

812
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,684
So what was
that all about?

813
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,618
Pay attention to me.

814
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,679
You have to go
into the tunnel.

815
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,055
Tomorrow, okay?
We'll do it tomorrow.

816
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,991
Today, I'm rehearsing.

817
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,388
Hey, wait up!

818
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,465
Hey.
Hey.

819
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,460
My trunk. Sweet.

820
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,801
Hi, honey.
Hey, Mom. Whoa.

821
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,603
I brought your
magic stuff over.

822
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,006
Thank you, Mom.

823
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,567
You're welcome, sweetie.

824
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:06,381
Mom, this is my
new assistant, Traci.

825
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,680
Traci. Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

826
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:12,846
You're Max's assistant. Nice.
Yeah. Thanks.

827
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,499
Hope Max has told you
what you're getting in for.

828
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,002
I'm sure it will
be all good.

829
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,834
Max, if we don't go now,
it'll be too late.

830
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,431
No, it won't.

831
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,440
It won't?

832
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:38,207
No, no. Everything's fine.
It's all under control, okay?

833
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:44,085
Hey! Get down!

834
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:48,651
Max!

835
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,192
Hey! Stop!
Give her back!

836
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,592
What? Give who back?

837
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:03,197
Ms. Doyle? Is Max
always like this?

838
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:07,208
Yeah, he's always like this,
but never really as much as that.

839
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,712
Tara!

840
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,001
Max!

841
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,168
Max!

842
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:44,804
Come on. Open the door!

843
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:48,874
Max, I think I hear
someone calling.

844
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,886
<i>Help, Max, help.</i>

845
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:56,357
"Help, Max, help." He'll
be right there, sweetie.

846
01:04:56,425 --> 01:05:00,452
But first, he has to have
some teeth drilled.

847
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:05,159
No, no, he doesn't. No, I'll take
a haircut. A haircut's fine. Please.

848
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:19,114
I love that sound.

849
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:24,848
His bicuspids
look spectacular.

850
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,355
We should take
those out first.

851
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:32,423
Bring Nicky to me
on Halloween night,

852
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:35,953
or we'll schedule
a second dental appointment.

853
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:37,590
Have a sucker.

854
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:49,571
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

855
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,135
should they return,
that all depends.

856
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,840
Quiet!

857
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:56,351
Max! I've grown stronger.

858
01:05:56,419 --> 01:06:00,014
Half of a spell just
won't do the charm.

859
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:03,252
Remember,
always floss.

860
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:07,023
I unfortunately never did.

861
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,963
Max!
Open the door!

862
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,008
Miss Wilson!

863
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:23,204
Miss Wilson? Miss Wilson.
Miss Wilson? Do not fall.

864
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,974
Miss Wilson. Wait!

865
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,375
Okay, okay. Now fall.

866
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,958
I thought people always
fainted backwards.

867
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,727
Who's Tara?

868
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,525
Who's this person
we can't see?

869
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,431
She's just part
of my magic...

870
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,560
Was part of my magic act.

871
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,432
Oh, nice.

872
01:06:58,514 --> 01:06:59,947
Hey, honey.

873
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,783
Hey, what's up,
magic man?

874
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,886
I'm just getting ready
for my magic act.

875
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,693
I don't know.
Doesn't really matter.

876
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,496
Oh, come on.
This is a big day for you.

877
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,299
And strange.
Very strange day.

878
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,704
Mrs. Murray was taken
away in an ambulance.

879
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:27,504
Yeah, she just snapped.

880
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:31,569
And our son was chasing
an invisible something.

881
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:35,447
Mom. It's okay. I'm just
a little stressed out.

882
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:37,042
That's all.
Stressed out?

883
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,383
Max, what have I been
telling you for years?

884
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:41,980
Nothing relaxes
a person like exercise.

885
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,390
Football, baseball,
basketball.

886
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,291
I mean, just look
at your brother, Colin.

887
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,330
Look how relaxed he is.

888
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,325
Nice.

889
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:55,268
Well, guys that only have to
worry about which deodorant to use

890
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,532
usually are relaxed.
What?

891
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,070
Come on.

892
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,304
Honey, I need
to talk to you.

893
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,368
About Max.

894
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,510
All right.
I'll tell you what, Max.

895
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,550
I want you to stay
out here with Colin

896
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:12,212
until you score at least 10
points against him in a one-on-one.

897
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:13,277
What? Dad!

898
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:16,847
Yeah, yeah, I won't take no
for an answer. All right?

899
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,360
No son of mine is
gonna be stressed out

900
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,761
when all he needs is a little quality
basketball time with his brother.

901
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,424
Now, get to it.

902
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,631
Max!

903
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:34,267
Max, you've gotta
get into that tunnel.

904
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:36,174
Where's Tara?

905
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:39,442
Look, I've got
some bad news.

906
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,116
Yeah? Well, so do I.

907
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,644
You're never gonna
make it to 10.

908
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:49,817
Look, Colin, I've gotta get inside.
Now. It's important.

909
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:53,350
Hey. Forget it.
You heard Dad.

910
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:56,398
You can't go inside
until you make it to 10.

911
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,692
Fine.

912
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,037
Come on, Max. I'm gonna
help you win this thing.

913
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:07,234
Okay.

914
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:13,540
What?

915
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,692
See you.

916
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:35,031
I gotta stop
eating yum-dums.

917
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,869
What, so,
what's your bad news?

918
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:46,146
Phears took your sister.

919
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,479
No!
Yeah.

920
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,213
If I would have paid more
attention to her at school,

921
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,814
then Phears wouldn't have
been able to snatch her.

922
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,017
Dude, this is
all my fault.

923
01:09:58,561 --> 01:09:59,858
Listen.

924
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,956
It's not your fault that Phears
is trying to snatch Tara and me.

925
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,893
We're the ones that brought
you into this anyway.

926
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:12,372
Yeah, I guess whose fault
it was doesn't matter.

927
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:15,869
But we've gotta save her.

928
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:19,542
So what are we gonna do?

929
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,276
Okay, listen.

930
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,750
You know how Lulu was talking
about how there's a tunnel

931
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:25,309
and only living people
can go in there?

932
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,445
Yeah.

933
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:30,288
Okay, well, there must be something in
there that Phears doesn't want us to see.

934
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:31,383
You're right.

935
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,724
Something that'll
help us defeat him.

936
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,127
Oh, yeah.

937
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:36,459
Come on.
You're going in.

938
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:37,590
What?

939
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,567
Yeah. You have to go in.
I'm dead.

940
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,501
What?
Yeah, let's go.

941
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:46,006
What?
Yeah.

942
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,703
But are you sure about this?

943
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:51,075
I mean, what if
we're not ready...

944
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:52,636
Yeah, let's go.

945
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,910
Okay, okay. I'm going.

946
01:10:57,553 --> 01:11:00,613
I gotta stop eating
peanuts, too.

947
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:03,487
Oh, wait.
This is just a dream.

948
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:08,795
Not a dream.

949
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:21,399
No one in the world wants to go
into this tunnel more than me.

950
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,934
Unless you do.

951
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,547
Are you afraid?

952
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:27,673
Afraid?

953
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:31,314
I don't know the meaning
of the word afraid.

954
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:35,551
Fortunately, I do know the
meaning of fear and petrified.

955
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:38,855
Okay. All I want you to do is
run and jump through the wall.

956
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,986
You want me to jump
into that wall?

957
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,395
Yes, you'll be fine.
You'll pass right through.

958
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,433
I thought that only
you could do that.

959
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:49,562
The fact that you're not a ghost is
the only reason you can go in there.

960
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,265
Okay? Get ready.

961
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,570
One, two...
Wait!

962
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,701
What if I can't find
my way out of there?

963
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,611
Then I'll end up a ghost
and I'll be no use to Tara.

964
01:11:58,681 --> 01:11:59,943
You'll be fine.

965
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,609
One, two...
Wait!

966
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:03,982
I have two more
things to say.

967
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,384
What?

968
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:08,247
Don't let me do this.

969
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:12,152
One, two...
Wait!

970
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,387
That was only one thing.

971
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,862
What's the second thing?

972
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,331
Please, don't let me do this!

973
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,127
Come on, man.

974
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,433
No!
One, two, three.

975
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:33,010
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

976
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:35,116
The worst is behind you.

977
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:45,894
Correction. The worst
is in front of you.

978
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:48,059
Oh, boy.

979
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:48,389
If only I knew
where she was.

980
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:49,924
<i>I'm here.</i>

981
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:52,290
Where?

982
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:55,421
<i>Back of the tunnel.</i>
<i>Go straight.</i>

983
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,733
If only she could
see me, too.

984
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:05,137
<i>TARA: I can see you.</i>

985
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:08,438
<i>I need you to</i>
<i>come to me. Now.</i>

986
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:12,377
Are you crazy?

987
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,245
There's a whole bunch
of people down there

988
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,784
that I usually try
to kill in video games.

989
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,342
<i>It's okay.</i>

990
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,820
<i>Just like when Nicky</i>
<i>and I are in your world,</i>

991
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,653
<i>you're the only one</i>
<i>who can see us.</i>

992
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:27,161
<i>Here, I'm the only one</i>
<i>who can see you.</i>

993
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:30,289
<i>Now get over here.</i>
<i>But be careful.</i>

994
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:34,301
<i>They can't see,</i>
<i>but they might be able to feel you.</i>

995
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:13,564
Tara. I'm here to save you.
I made it.

996
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,008
I can't. Lulu's right.

997
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,945
Only the living can
make it out of here,

998
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,107
until tomorrow night.

999
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,548
But that's Halloween.

1000
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:23,744
I know.

1001
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:27,619
That's when Phears is planning
to release all these spirits.

1002
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:33,116
So what can we do?

1003
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,897
I want you to go back and
do your show tomorrow night

1004
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:40,594
and make sure
Nicky is there helping.

1005
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:43,900
You want me to do my show?
But why?

1006
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,405
You'll see.

1007
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,635
And I want you
to take this.

1008
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:54,111
Find the ring inside and make
sure you wear it tomorrow night.

1009
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,479
It'll help your magic.

1010
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,611
Now, get out of here
before Phears gets back.

1011
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:02,145
Just like you can see him,
he can see you.

1012
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:15,794
Stay away!

1013
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,227
I'm back.

1014
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,272
I'm alive.

1015
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:25,931
But my face hurts.

1016
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:28,442
Well, what happened?
Did you see Tara or what?

1017
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,876
Yeah. She gave me this.

1018
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:35,940
This is my dad's stuff.
Phears must have been hiding it.

1019
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:39,918
But why? What didn't
he want me to see?

1020
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,546
Let's find out.

1021
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:51,597
Cool ring. I've never
seen this before.

1022
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,498
Tara told me about this.

1023
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:55,297
You couldn't get
Tara out of there?

1024
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,463
She didn't want me
to get her out.

1025
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:01,168
She just said to do the show tomorrow
night and be sure that you were there.

1026
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,336
She said we'd find out why.

1027
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,985
Are you sure?

1028
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:13,248
Positive.

1029
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:18,586
I think it has something to do
with Phears and Halloween.

1030
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:22,289
But she did say to be sure
I was wearing this ring.

1031
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:07,834
He plans on letting them all out on
Halloween, when he's at his full power.

1032
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,536
You can't let him.

1033
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,116
A spell designed
to defeat evil.

1034
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:24,487
Only the living can
make it out of here.

1035
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,473
Boo!

1036
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:49,908
Can I have
a glass of water?

1037
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,385
It's okay, Max.
You were only dreaming.

1038
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,857
Are you sure?

1039
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:00,952
Yeah, man. I've been
here the whole time.

1040
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:05,261
Don't worry. No ghosts can get in
here without me knowing about it.

1041
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:11,060
Coming from a ghost, I'm
sure that fixes everything.

1042
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,011
Trick or treat!

1043
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,673
Do you remember when you
were that little, honey?

1044
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,378
No, just leave the candy.
It's okay. Come on.

1045
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,886
Don't wanna be late
for your show.

1046
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,832
So, we just do
the regular act?

1047
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,595
Whatever that is.

1048
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,871
Jeez.
Man, what a wimp.

1049
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,375
Are you gonna let him
get away with that?

1050
01:20:57,452 --> 01:21:00,046
Forget it.
We've gotta get to the show.

1051
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:02,612
Now get in.
I'll meet you at the school.

1052
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:07,994
Trick or treat!

1053
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:42,527
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>to kick off tonight's entertainment,</i>

1054
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:45,498
<i>I am pleased to present</i>
<i>Max the Magnificent</i>

1055
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:49,059
<i>and his equally magnificent</i>
<i>assistant, Traci Walker.</i>

1056
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,057
What do we do first?

1057
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,183
I don't know.

1058
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,194
Let's see what junk
my mom put in the trunk.

1059
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:25,432
Hey, pick it up.

1060
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,301
And pour.

1061
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:04,772
Enough!

1062
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:06,473
What'd you
do that for?

1063
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:08,948
Well, you never
told me to stop.

1064
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:17,622
Aha!

1065
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:19,353
A deck of cards.

1066
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,362
And now for my next trick

1067
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:26,127
I need my lovely assistant
to stand next to me.

1068
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:27,862
And what would you
like me to do?

1069
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:29,369
You're doing it.

1070
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:33,697
And now I need a volunteer
from the audience.

1071
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,274
You, sir.

1072
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,336
I want you to pick a card.

1073
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:43,612
But wait, don't come to me.
The deck will come to you.

1074
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:58,028
And now, sir,
pick a card.

1075
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,934
Now, show it
to the audience.

1076
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,171
Now, put it back
in the deck.

1077
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:16,110
And now the deck
will come back to me.

1078
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,054
Three of hearts.

1079
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:31,054
Was your card
the three of hearts?

1080
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:42,305
What does any of this have to do
with freeing Tara or my parents?

1081
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:45,835
I don't know, brother.
She just told me to do the act.

1082
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,508
A cockroach?

1083
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:56,353
Well, I guess we aren't the only
audience watching the show tonight.

1084
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:10,798
Okay. Let's move on
to some levitating.

1085
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,311
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

1086
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:30,186
should they return,
that all depends.

1087
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:55,613
Behold, on this the most
evil of Halloween nights,

1088
01:25:55,683 --> 01:26:00,017
my legion of souls
will walk again.

1089
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:17,795
Oh, you want a little of this?
How about you? You want some, too?

1090
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,322
Mom, there's real
ghosts out here.

1091
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:12,757
Oh, honey, you know there's
no such thing as ghosts.

1092
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:19,623
Hey, leave my mom alone.

1093
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:38,980
Come forward, my children.
Forward!

1094
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:43,717
Take your place eternally
tormenting the living.

1095
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:45,019
Enjoy.

1096
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:58,131
Max!

1097
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:07,706
Hey!

1098
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:16,386
Hey! Nobody invited
you to this party!

1099
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:17,890
I crashed.

1100
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:23,655
Now, I just need to find
the last of the Roland brats,

1101
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:25,824
and I'll be unstoppable!

1102
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,094
Where's my sister?

1103
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:28,601
How accommodating.

1104
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,134
Let me go!

1105
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,472
"Oh, let me go.
Let me go."

1106
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,910
Let go of my brother!

1107
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:53,455
Max! Read the light!
Read the light of the ring!

1108
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,962
What? I can't read it, it's...

1109
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:00,760
From the light of Earth,
the Dark descends,

1110
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,894
should they return,
that all depends.

1111
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:05,461
When hands point up
to moonlit skies,

1112
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,065
on ten-three-one,
the darkness dies.

1113
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:14,275
You got it, Max!
Read it again!

1114
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:18,809
From the light of Earth,
the Dark descends,

1115
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:21,081
should they return,
that all depends.

1116
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:25,148
When hands point up
to moonlit skies,

1117
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:28,286
on ten-three-one,
the darkness dies.

1118
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:37,034
Come on, everybody!

1119
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:38,970
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends...

1120
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,871
Stop reading
that cursed poem!

1121
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:45,378
Should they return,
that all depends! No!

1122
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:48,682
When hands point up
to moonlit skies,

1123
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:52,686
on ten-three-one
the darkness dies!

1124
01:29:56,991 --> 01:30:00,222
No! No! No!

1125
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:01,818
Grab a hold of Max.

1126
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:04,990
We have to be holding
someone who's living!

1127
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,934
No! Stop! All of you,
don't send me back!

1128
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:11,938
Don't send me back! No!

1129
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:14,270
Grab a hold
of our hands!

1130
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:15,639
What?

1131
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:17,405
What do you mean?

1132
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,242
Wait!

1133
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:10,153
Max, I can't believe it.

1134
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:14,099
You made this fundraiser the most
successful one the school has ever had.

1135
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:15,897
Thank you.

1136
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:16,994
Max.

1137
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:21,599
That was the most amazing
magic act I've ever seen.

1138
01:31:21,676 --> 01:31:25,077
Son, I can't tell you
how proud you made me.

1139
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:28,343
I've been trying to get you into
sports and to keep up with Colin and...

1140
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:29,849
Forget it.

1141
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:32,545
You really found
your true calling,

1142
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:35,919
and I want you to know
I back you 100%.

1143
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:39,425
You made this the
best Halloween ever.

1144
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:40,893
Thanks, Dad.

1145
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:48,635
Everybody, everybody!
This is my son up here.

1146
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:06,248
You really have made
this the best Halloween ever.

1147
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,982
You guys made it.
Phears didn't get you.

1148
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:10,421
Thanks to you.

1149
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:13,119
Come on. You guys are
the ones who did it.

1150
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,718
Now, with Phears
out of the way,

1151
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:18,356
we can really concentrate
on finding your parents.

1152
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:22,334
You know what?
I can feel Mom and Dad.

1153
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:24,200
They know we're
looking for them.

1154
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:27,167
And they believe
we're gonna find them, too.

1155
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:30,176
We got the ring.
We know where the tunnel is.

1156
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:32,678
And the evil ghosts are gone.

1157
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:36,683
We can probably find more clues in there
and that should lead us right to them.

1158
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:38,582
This is so great.

1159
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:41,781
You know, it's weird,
'cause I can feel them, too.

1160
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,347
It's like they're leading
us right to them. I know.

1161
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:47,451
A little more investigating, and we
should be hooking up with them soon.

1162
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:49,826
Oh, my gosh,
this is so great.

1163
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:52,462
Oh, yeah. Listen, Max.

1164
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:55,593
Go back there and enjoy some time
with your family. You deserve it.

1165
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,729
Yeah. We'll see you
back at the house.

1166
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:58,999
Okay. Don't worry.

1167
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:02,372
Tomorrow, we'll dive head-on
into this investigation.

1168
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:05,435
The three of us,
we make an awesome team.

1169
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:06,980
And nothing can
stop us now.

1170
01:33:07,048 --> 01:33:09,007
Yeah!
High fives!

1171
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,646
Bye!

1172
