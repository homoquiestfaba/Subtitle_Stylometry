OK, OK, I got you.

10
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,417
I got you.

11
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,045
Get your hands on your head.

12
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,630
You good, Jeremy?

13
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,381
Yeah, I'm good.

14
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,678
Lucky for him, you
came when you did.

15
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,723
He's all yours, so
is the paperwork.

16
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,975
Next time, I'll just
let you have the collar.

00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,518
Life's all about choices.

18
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,895
Hey, you use my
words against me.

19
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,732
Hey, yo, would you
really have shot me?

20
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:12,858
Always ready.

21
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,483
Always there.

22
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,735
What does that even mean?

Hey, yo, would she
really have shot me?

26
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,450
Not my sister's keeper.

27
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,452
You got the right
to shut the hell up.

28
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,246
Now let's get to step up.

00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:34,838
Hi, chief.

31
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,922
Hi.

32
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,925
Nice collar on that
carjacker last week, Forest.

33
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,760
Thank you, sir.

34
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:40,470
You're welcome.

35
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,767
You should have let
me have that collar.

36
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,058
Choices.

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,476
Ooh.

38
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,228
[chuckles] So are
you going to the bar?

39
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,980
First round's on me.

40
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,816
I think I'm going to
head home, grab a six.

41
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,610
Mm.

42
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,613
Drop it, or die--

43
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,697
[laughs] what was that?

44
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,948
[laughs] You like that?

45
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,824
I did.

46
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,241
I liked it.

47
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,284
It's all yours.

48
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:04,951
OK.

49
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,663
OK.

50
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,541
Ooh.

51
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:12,000
I think I'm going
to play the number.

52
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,168
Sucker.

53
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,295
[chuckles] Say that when
I'm sipping drinks in Maui.

54
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,672
Hope you take better deodorant.

55
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,590
Ha, she's kidding.

56
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,259
Whatever you say.

57
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,011
Hey, what isle is the deodorant?

58
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:23,722
First isle.

59
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,108
Mm.

60
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,404
[chuckles] I'm a police officer.

61
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,323
How nice for you.

62
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,201
And what do you do?

63
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,911
I work at the DA's office.

64
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:52,123
Oh, that kind of makes us,
like, colleagues, right,

65
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,249
co-workers a little bit.

66
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:53,917
Yeah.

67
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,587
OK.

68
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,098
Give me a pack of lamb skins.

69
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,934
Extra large.

70
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,398
It isn't Christmas.

71

I just need to get--

75
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,780
Closed.

76
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,198
OK, wrong store.

77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,157
Yeah.

78
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,117
Hurry up!

79
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,285
Buckle up!

80
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,954
Hurry the fuck up.

81
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:31,454
OK.

82
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,330
It isn't my money.

83
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,667
You got that right.

84
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,757
Don't forget the lamb skins.

85
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,841
Want a receipt, too?

86
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,259
Do you want to keep both eyes?

87
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,468
Police!

88
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,178
Drop it, or die.

I'm good.

99
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:09,912
I'm OK, too.

100
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,461
Drop your weapon now!

Hey!

Hey!

00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,088
Hey!

Hey!

105
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,339
Just wait.

Call 911.

00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,102
Oh, my god.

114
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:36,853
Call 911.

115
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:37,854
Stay there.

116
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,855
You're not going to die.

117
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:39,480
Stay with me.

118
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,398
Come on.

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,399
Oh, god.

120
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,859
I thought he was going to shoot.

121
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,277
[sniffing] Come on.

122
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,153
Come on.

123
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:45,862
Stay with me.

124
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,280
Stay with me!

Come on.

00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:49,658
Come on.

129
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,408
Push.

130
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,159
You're OK.

131
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:51,535
You're OK.

132
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,368
You're OK.

133
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,286
I'm so sorry.

00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,165

I'm Olivia Dahlly, and I'm

139
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,174
as your representative
in Congress.

140
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,678
You know where I
stand on the issues.

141
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,930
Together, we can
make a difference.

142

[gunfire]

143
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,021
Welcome back to the
Justice Jenny Show.

144
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,358
Crime is on the rise
in America, but it

145
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,321
is our Second Amendment rights
that are under assault. I am--

146
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,073
Turn this off, will you?

147
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,617
You don't like what
she has to say?

148
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,659
--and stand--

149
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,953
I come here for booze, not news.

150
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,747
I like what she has to say.

151
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,084
I keep a cannon under my bar.

152
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,463
It's kind of early, isn't it?

153
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,592
What did you do, put out an APB?

154
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,760
No.

155
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:52,012
Found you all by myself.

156
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,097
You should be a detective.

157
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,600
You should check your messages.

158
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:57,643
I'm busy.

159
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,521
So I see.

160
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,608
It's a nice place.

161
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,318
At least no cops come here.

162
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,575
So Russet says you can come
back to work whenever you want.

163
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,036
She turned your resignation
into a leave of absence.

164
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,204
You're killing my buzz.

165
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,499
I seriously doubt that.

166
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:26,505
OK, have you-- have you spoken
to anyone, a priest or--

167
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,382
A shrink.

168
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,009
I was going to say, your father?

169
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:37,223
(WHISPERING) my father-- no,
I've not spoken to my father.

170
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,684
Why not?

171
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:42,521
Because he's a cop, like you.

172
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,188
I'm your partner.

173
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,524
Not any more, you're not.

174
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,108
Then I'm your friend.

175
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,819
Look, either way, I'm
worried about you.

176
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,779
Don't be.

177
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,406
I'm old enough to
take care of myself.

178
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,074
right, Billy?

179
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,661
Yeah, I [inaudible] myself.

180
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:03,208
Look, I'm going camping this
weekend with a few friends.

181
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,293
You should tag along.

182
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,588
It'll do you some good to
get you out of the city.

183
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,422
Friends with badges?

184
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,175
Civilians.

185
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,386
He teaches high school,
and she's a social worker.

186
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,598
Kumbaya.

187
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,182
They're good people.

188
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,852
You'd like them if you
just give them a chance.

189
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:28,318
Call me if you want to go, or
even if you just want to talk.

190
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,616
Hey, I'm still your rabbi.

191
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,288
Don't drink too much.

192
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,213
[gunshot]

193
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:22,663
Hey.

194
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:23,955
Good morning.

195
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,082
Megan, Blake and Gabriella.

196
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,793
It's nice to finally meet you.

197
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:28,546
Same here.

198
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,715
Jeremy talks about you all
the time

199
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,426
I bet.

200
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,806
Couldn't have left the
work clothes at home?

201
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,432
Come on.

202
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:46,937
Hey, once a cop, always a cop.

203
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,023
That's what you think.

204
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:58,364
[grunts] All right, say
goodbye to all the bad guys.

205
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,451
I already have.

206
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:07,500
[fast-paced music]

207
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,958
They've been in there
all night, doing

208
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,211
the devil's work, no doubt.

209
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,590
All right, gather around.

210
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,094
Everyone stay alert.

211
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,054
These are bad hombres.

212
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,515
Barry, you stay here.

213
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,892
If we get in over our
heads, sound the horn.

214
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,059
No smokies.

215
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,227
Right, Preach.

216
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,648
Bow your heads.

217
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,651
Dear Lord, protect us
from evil and give us

218
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,987
strength in our war against
your earthly enemies.

219
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:19,821
Amen.

220
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:20,196
Amen.

221
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,239
Amen.

222
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,241
Everybody comes home, got it?

223
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,200
Got it.

224
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,201
Let's roll.

225
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:37,130
[suspenseful music]

226
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,965
On you, long night.

227
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,552
Well, you going to be
bitching we unload this shit.

228
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:42,678
I ain't bitching, just tired.

229
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,055
We'll get some sleep when
we're done because we're

230
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,848
going to Philly tonight.

231
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,974
I ain't driving.

232
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,935
Hector can drive.

233
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,854
I like to drive.

234
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,731
All this hard work
is about to pay off.

235
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,736
[garage door opening]

236
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:02,030
Baby, are you
coming to bed soon?

237
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,700
How many times I got
to tell you to knock?

238
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,242
We almost smoked your ass.

239
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,328
Are you coming to bed?

240
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,246
Can't you see I'm working here?

241
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,623
You're always working.

242
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,792
Well, that's because
I'm a businessman.

243
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,627
Go back to your
horse, or something.

244
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,128
I'll be in when I'm ready.

245
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,922
[scoffs]

246
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,924
That bitch can't get
enough of my stuff.

247
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:21,550
[laughs]

248
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,176
What are you laughing at?

249
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,178
You're supposed to be standing
guard outside, eagle eye.

250
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,012
[man speaks spanish]

251
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,101
[music playing]

252
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,020
Beautiful, isn't it?

253
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,231
I love the mountains.

254
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,357
Those are hills, city girl.

255
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,151
[chuckles] Like you'd know.

256
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,696
Tell her, Blake.

257
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,490
They're mountains.

258
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,951
You teach history,
not geography.

259
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,287
Well, the study of
mountains is orology.

260
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,205
Whatever.

261
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,414
You just made that up.

262
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,837
Hills, mountains--
it's all God's country.

263
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,051
[suspenseful music]

264
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,808
Don't move, chico.

265
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,770
Throw your gun on the ground.

266
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:15,188
Get down.

267
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,404
Drop it, pigs.

268
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,491
[gunshots]

269
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:38,502
Gun!

270
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,507
[rapid gunfire]

271
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,091
Shit!

272
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,930
[grunting]

273
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:55,101
Eduardo Sanchez?

274
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,937
Sure, why not.

275
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,941
You came to the
wrong county, ese.

276
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,463
Smell that?

277
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,340
Smell that fresh air?

278
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,175
[laughs]

279
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,886
This isn't exactly a
designated campsite.

280
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,555
Oh, you don't get
the full experience

281
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,599
at those designated campsites.

282
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,309
We're going to rough it
out in the wilderness.

283
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:40,355
What if the wilderness
is private property?

284
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,859
It's Gods country, remember?

285
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,401
Yeah.

286
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,571
Do you think it's safe to leave
your wheels here like this?

287
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,616
I think so.

288
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,581
Cooked right under our noses.

289
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,541
This is worth a
fortune on the streets.

290
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,585
We're not the animals.

291
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,253
We found $80,000 in the house.

292
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:04,963
You know where to put that.

293
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,174
Wait, where's your warrant?

294
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,593
I don't like warrants.

295
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,011
They leave a paper trail.

296
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,220
Well, now I want a lawyer, man.

297
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,972
That's not how we
do things here.

298
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,181
I know my rights.

299
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,018
See if I care about your rights.

300
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,312
What about this evidence?

301
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:21,980
Burn it.

302
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,360
[fire crackling]

303
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:29,738
Ah.

304
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,782
That was good, Blake.

305
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,575
Gabby, now I see
why you married him.

306
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:34,284
[laughter]

307
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,702
Thanks.

308
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,288
When are you joining the team?

309
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,540
Me?

310
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,792
Oh, no time soon.

311
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,251
I'm still in my prime.

312
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,171
Who's going to want
you when you aren't?

313
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,341
That's a long way off from now.

314
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,218
What about you, Megan?

315
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,596
My only plan is
to go for a hike.

316
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,471
Want company?

317
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,182
No, thanks.

318
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,184
I'm going to try to
find some of that peace

319
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,854
and solitude I keep
hearing so much about.

320
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,690
Enjoy.

321
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:07,235
Hey, don't get lost.

322
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,281
Are you sure she's OK?

323
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,451
Got to take the social
worker out of the city.

324
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:21,748
Yeah, she's good, just
needs a moment to unwind.

325
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,458
I'll talk to her in a few.

326
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,252
[music playing]

[birds squawking, chirping]

328
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,307
Hey, wait up.

329
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,604
Are you tailing me?

330
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:44,563
No.

331
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,314
Blake and Gabriella
wanted some alone time.

332
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,065
Mm.

333
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,734
I guess I'm some stuck with you.

334
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,363
Ooh, I'm feeling the love.

335
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,494
Thanks for inviting me.

336
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,996
You were right.

337
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,332
I needed to get out.

338
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:07,377
The job was getting to
me before the shooting,

339
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,922
and the city was
getting to me all along.

340
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,298
Yeah.

341
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,511
They both can do that.

342
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:21,517
Maybe I should move out here,
get a cabin, or like a teepee.

343
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,018
[chuckling]

344
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,397
Somehow, I don't think
that that's a good idea.

345
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,692
I need to do something.

346
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:36,447
I wish you'd
reconsider resigning.

347
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,700
I miss you in the streets.

348
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:39,993
And the truth comes out.

349
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:40,994
[chuckles]

350
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,495

00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,586

00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,257
Come on, just let me go.

[ominous music]

356
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,693
Where are you from, Eduardo?

357
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:15,821
Colombia, Mexico?

358
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:16,780
Try the Bronx.

359
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,114
I'm as American as you.

360
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:21,827
I guess that depends
on your point of view.

361
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,078
This ain't right, man.

362
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,788
Keep digging.

363
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,915
What the hell?

364
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:31,002
You know, I can't be the only
one cooking meth around here.

365
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,921
Are you working for someone?

366
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,506
Maybe we can do some business.

367
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,675
We don't work for
drug traffickers.

368
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,511
They attract too much
federal attention.

369
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,848
Did you bring your
off-duty weapon?

370
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,725
It's back in the car.

371
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:48,394
Listen, if you want
me gone, I'm gone.

372
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,021
Just let me go.

373
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,439
Sorry.

374
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,484
Too much went down
this morning, amigo.

375
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,861
What, do you mean them?

376
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:59,489
Listen, I didn't see anything,
so I can't be a witness.

377
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,699
So just let me go.

378
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,744
Sorry, I can't do
that, Sancho Panza.

379
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,579
All right.

380
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,749
Then dig your own damn grave.

381
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:11,752
This man just threatened
my life with that shovel?

382
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:12,460
[ominous music]

383
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,003
This is bull--

384
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,633
[gunshots]

385
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,174
Hey.

386
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,926
Where the hell did
you two come from?

387
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,761
[grunts]

388
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:23,054
Barnes!

389
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,055
Double time.

390
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,603
[tense music]

391
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,191
Barnes?

392
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,655
Get those fuckers.

393
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,532
Barry, you help me get
him to the vehicle.

394
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:42,868
Rest of you know what to do.

395
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,875
[grunting, heavy breathing]

396
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:52,333
This way.

397
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,669
No, no, no.

398
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:54,169
I don't want to lead
them to the camp.

399
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:54,672
Come on.

400
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:10,393
Oh, whoa.

401
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,978
What's going on?

402
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,979
Guys, we need to get the
hell out of here right now.

403
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:13,522
Were those gunshots?

404
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:14,773
Leave everything behind.

405
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:15,231
What are you doing with that?

406
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,107
Go.

407
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:16,983
Hey, come on!

408
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:17,568
We can't explain--

409
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,318
Here, you lead the way.

410
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,904
I got the rear.

411
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:34,626
[grunting]

412
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,127
What do you want
me to tell the ER?

413
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,003
Nothing.

414
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:37,921
Leave that to me.

415
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,423
[vomiting]

416
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,135
I bet he's got a concussion.

417
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,305
We lost them.

418
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,059
There's only one
road out of here.

419
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:54,270
Down.

420
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,021
Down.

421
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:55,355
Down.

422
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,064
Down.

423
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:56,773
Down.

424
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:57,148
Down.

425
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,024
Down.

426
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,111
[car engine roaring]

427
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,113
What's going on?

428
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:03,991
Everybody in.

429
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:15,000
What the hell is going on?

430
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,210
We just witnessed the homicide.

431
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,837
Why did you flag
down those cops?

432
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,090
Because they're the killers.

433
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,220
They're after us because
we saw what they did.

434
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,429
What did they kill?

435
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,684
An unarmed man, with
three other bodies.

436
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,904
Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy-- dammit.

437
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,993
[gunshots]

438
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,749
They're coming your way.

439
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:02,090
My gun's underneath the seat.

440
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,558
I don't see any extra ammo.

441
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,394
This was supposed to
be a quiet weekend.

442
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:29,159
Shit, shit, shit!

443
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:40,337
[gunshots]

444
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:54,683
Come on.

445
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:55,433
Everybody out!

446
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,560
Everybody out!

447
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:57,435
Let's go!

448
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,186
Come on!

449
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:58,562
This way!

450
00:23:58,564 --> 00:23:59,395
This way!

451
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,023
This way!

452
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,428
Damn them to hell.

453
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,317
They're using the
trees for cover.

454
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,028
Do you want to us
to go after them?

455
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,237
They have Barnes's gun.

456
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,406
It's too easy to
ambush us going uphill.

457
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,116
We don't catch them
before nightfall,

458
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,576
we'll never get them.

459
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,036
Call up the reserves.

460
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:58,329
Tell Barry we need food
and water for an army.

461
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,540
On it.

462
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:02,169
Hey, Preach, you better come
back here and look at this.

463
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:12,761
Just what we need.

464
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:16,349
[grunting, heavy breathing]

465
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,061
Did we lose them?

466
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:22,688
They know I have this gun.

467
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,149
By now, they know I'm a cop.

468
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,651
That's good, right?

469
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,235
It doesn't make a difference.

470
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,697
Look, I know I said, no phones.

471
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:33,408
But did anybody break the rules?

472
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:37,619
Really, guys?

473
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:38,371
What the fuck?

474
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:41,416
No service.

475
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,920
We just got to talk to
them, make them understand.

476
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:48,296
Understand what?

477
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,631
We just witnessed
them commit a murder.

478
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,592
They're never going to
let us out of here alive.

479
00:25:51,594 --> 00:25:52,759
You don't know that.

480
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:53,844
You don't know what
those people did.

481
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,178
They were drug dealers, OK?

482
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,846
It doesn't matter.

483
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:56,680
They were executed.

484
00:25:56,682 --> 00:26:00,185
[siren wailing]

485
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,603
What's that?

486
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:04,605
Fire horn.

487
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:05,897
Oh.

488
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,316
It's a call to arms.

489
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,860
They're bringing
in reinforcements.

490
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,402
Oh, no.

491
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,739
Look, when there's
enough of them,

492
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,490
they're going to surround us.

493
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,868
We got to try to make
it difficult for them.

494
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,329
Why couldn't you two just
have minded your own business?

495
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,581
Look what you've gotten us into?

496
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:27,210
We didn't do anything, just
wrong place at the wrong time.

497
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,879
OK, so what can we do?

498
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,506
We're going to split up.

499
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:31,507
What?

500
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:32,633
She's right.

501
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:35,343
We have to split
up into two teams

502
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,262
and head in
different directions.

503
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,515
Then we can double our
chances of getting away.

504
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:40,641
Wait, wait.

505
00:26:40,643 --> 00:26:42,225
Why two teams?

506
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:43,977
By your reasoning, we'd
do better splitting up

507
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:44,936
as four individuals.

508
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,355
Two guns, two teams.

509
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,274
Blake, you go with Meg.

510
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:51,527
Gabby, you go with me?

511
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:52,443
No.

512
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,530
You can't expect us
to leave each other.

513
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:57,073
Have you ever fired a
weapon in your life?

514
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,909
I don't suppose
video games count.

515
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,745
How about you?

516
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:03,454
There's nothing to debate.

517
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:07,793
Try to stay parallel to the
road so you don't get lost.

518
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:11,421
I'm not leaving without you.

519
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:15,341
Honey, they're right.

520
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:16,677
This is our best chance, OK?

521
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,846
Look-- Look at me.

522
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:23,474
We need to go right now.

523
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,603
Like I said, thanks for
the invite, partner.

524
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:29,773
When we get back home,
first round's on me.

525
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,483
You're on.

526
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,864
Hey, be all you can be.

527
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,493
He's been with [? nicole ?]
City PD for 10 years.

528
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,664
A month ago, his partner shot
and killed a fellow officer.

529
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,790
She's on leave.

530
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,499
Maybe she's the one
that was with him.

531
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,378
Maybe all four of them are cops.

532
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,887
That took longer than
a New York minute.

533
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,472
Not by much, it didn't.

534
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:04,015
You could be damn sure
we were locked and loaded

535
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,184
inside 60 seconds.

536
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,853
I don't know which
is twat out here.

537
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:08,895
What's the big emergency?

538
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,856
I'll give you the rundown
when everybody's here.

539
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:14,486
[fast-paced music]

540
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:08,329
The Latinos running this farm
were using it as a meth lab.

541
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,956
They opened fire
on me and my men,

542
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,543
and we did what any one
of you would have done.

543
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:14,586
We don't need the
feds or the media

544
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,548
sticking their noses
in our business.

545
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,842
Unfortunately, we were seen.

546
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,260
Seen by who?

547
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:25,346
Outsiders, two
men and two women.

548
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,848
One of them is Black.

549
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,601
They're hiding in the
green, and they're armed.

550
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,812
Look what they did
to poor Barnes.

551
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,939
We didn't know if he was
going to pull through.

552
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:37,192
I don't have to tell you what
will happen if they make it out

553
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:38,401
of here.

554
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:41,029
It's not just me and my men
whose necks are on the line

555
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:41,697
here.

556
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:43,740
It's our whole way of life.

557
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:47,077
Either we handle this now, or
we start the damn revolution

558
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,286
when the feds move in.

559
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,246
Revolution sounds good to me.

560
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:51,998
We're not ready for
that yet, Vernon.

561
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,375
Were supposed to be
preparing the next generation

562
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,795
for a war they can
win.

563
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,714
Do you expect us to kill
these people for free?

564
00:29:58,716 --> 00:30:01,967
The council is offering ten
grand in cash for each target.

565
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:02,593
Shit.

566
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:03,969
You don't have to pay me.

567
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,179
I'll hunt these
motherfuckers for free.

568
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,305
Shut up, Darcy.

569
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,140
We ain't doing
this shit for free.

570
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,308
Cocksucker.

571
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,060
Blue team will run
this command post.

572
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,855
Block the main road, and
coordinate all activity.

573
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:17,691
Our Minutemen will be red team.

574
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,192
We're the only team you need.

575
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,443
Yeah, we are.

576
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,821
Our militia will be green team.

577
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,698
We'll get those four for you.

578
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,199
You got that shit right.

579
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,952
Not if we bag them we'll you're
all having a pissing contest.

580
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:30,996
Our Betsies will
be the orange team.

581
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,081
At least you didn't
make us pink.

582
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,834
I'd never make that
mistake, Annie.

583
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,335
At least I don't
piss standing up.

584
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,838
No, you do it on all fours.

585
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,256
You want to go a few rounds?

586
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,799
I bet you'd like that.

587
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,342
You're playing for
the wrong team.

588
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,720
Save it for the enemy, ladies.

589
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:48,764
We know these woods
better than any of you.

590
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:52,768
Oh, I didn't see
you arrive, Cletus.

591
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,770
Because we didn't want
you to know we were here.

592
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:56,437
Sister fuckers.

593
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,106
What did you say?

594
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,942
Oh, we're just admiring
your outfit, Claudette.

595
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,069
It better be I you're admiring.

596
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,320
Oh, relax.

597
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:06,406
We know you're
with your brother.

598
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,448
Come again?

599
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,950
Sorry, Cletus.

600
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,787
I meant to say, cousin.

601
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:13,246
You girls watch yourself.

602
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,791
We want to be shadow team.

603
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:18,084
That's fine, Wade.

604
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:21,922
The Wagners will be shadow team.

605
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:26,051
Our targets are
outnumbered and outgunned.

606
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,512
We have to find
them before dark,

607
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,471
promised my wife I'd
be home for dinner.

608
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,348
Yeah, I told mine
the same thing.

609
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,310
[laughter]

610
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:36,978
Leave your beer behind.

611
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,981
I don't want you shooting
each other by mistake.

612
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:44,485
Bring them back warm if you can,
but cold suits me just fine.

613
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:47,405
Good luck, and good hunting.

614
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:53,870
Make no mistake, this is war,
maybe not the one we wanted,

615
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:56,289
but the one that
landed in our backyard.

616
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,417
How do you plan on
explaining all this away?

617
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,002
We won't have to.

618
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:04,631
These people were never here.

619
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,883
We just have to
cover our tracks.

620
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:09,219
Sounds like bullshit to me!

621
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:10,428
Dead or alive!

622
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,888
Dead or alive!

623
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,181
Dead or alive!

624
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:14,558
Dead or alive!

625
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,309

626
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,562
Dead or alive!

[ominous music]

628
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,443
They have all the fun.

629
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:29,072
You forgot to mention one
of our targets is a cop.

630
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,242
I didn't forget anything.

631
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,341
Remember, the Firearms League
is honoring you on Tuesday.

632
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:51,595
I'm so sick of those
Rust Belt luncheons.

633
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:53,514
Are you sick of the
press they generate?

634
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:56,349
Dust off my usual speech.

635
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:57,350
You got it.

636
00:32:57,352 --> 00:33:00,355
[cell phone buzzing]

637
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,440
I told you, never
call me on this line

638
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,026
unless it's an emergency.

639
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:09,362
We have a situation.

640
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:10,032
Pull over.

641
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,710
Get out.

642
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,503
Excuse me?

643
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:25,378
You heard me.

644
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,173
Wait on the curb.

645
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,517
Lay it on me.

646
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:40,205
[helicopter whirring]

647
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:48,213
Down!

648
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,348
We should be out there
waiving our arms.

649
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,269
No one good is looking for us.

650
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,573
Keep it together, Gabby!

651
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,995
[sobbing]

652
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,914
You good?

653
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:24,625
I think so.

654
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:27,545
Let's go.

655
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,717
Green team to blue command.

656
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,010
Go ahead, green team.

657
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:39,888
Found their campsite
and a couple of IDs.

658
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:44,935
We got a high school
teacher and a social worker.

659
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:47,854
Bunch of damn do-gooders.

660
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:48,730
Good work.

661
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,816
Torch everything.

662
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,943
One cop, two civilians.

663
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:53,944
One question mark.

664
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:57,575
[heavy breathing]

665
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:01,785
Oh, no.

[ominous music]

667
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:06,667
Keep moving.

668
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:32,983
What do you see, Caleb?

669
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:35,485
Two of them up ahead.

670
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,070
That's $20.

671
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,989
5K each.

672
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:40,031
What am I, your squire?

673
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:40,907
There's five of us.

674
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:42,576
That's 4K apiece.

675
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:45,746
Whatever you say, Mr.
high school graduate.

676
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:48,876
[grunting]

677
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:50,917
Come on.

678
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:51,918
We've got to keep going.

[heavy breathing]

680
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,006
I need rest.

681
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:59,926
Look, they're gaining on us!

682
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:02,178
You go on without me.

683
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,639
No deal.

684
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:04,767
I can't keep this up.

685
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,187
Here, take this.

686
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:12,272
Take it.

687
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:14,566
[grunts]

688
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,985
Keep both hands on the gun.

689
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,654
Squeeze the trigger.

690
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:19,946
Don't pull it.

691
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:24,075
You only got six shots,
so don't waste any.

692
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:25,827
Now go.

693
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,120
I told you I can't run anymore.

694
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:30,957
Then walk fast, but go.

695
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:31,833
What about you?

696
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,293
I'm going to lead
them away from you.

697
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:34,586
No.

698
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:39,550
Look, I'll circle back and catch
up as soon as I can, all right?

699
00:37:39,552 --> 00:37:41,843
Now get going.

700
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:42,218
Come on.

701
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,846
Go.

702
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:50,143
Now these two have split up.

703
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:51,227
Then we'll split up, too.

00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:54,858

Put the gun down, miss.

712
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,108
You don't want to hurt anyone.

713
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,986
You surely don't
want to kill us.

714
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,447
It's all a big misunderstanding.

715
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,366
Stay back, you redneck
sons of bitches.

716
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:12,285
I'll shoot if I have to.

00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:14,162
No you won't.

00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:14,998
No you won't.

722
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:24,382
Easy now.

00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,011
Don't you ever point
a gun at someone

00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:34,057

There's no calling dibs, Darcy.

I fucking call dibs anyway.

00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:37,806
That isn't how I see it.

743
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,057
Hey!

744
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,810
I thought we're all supposed
to be on the same fucking team!

745
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:44,189
Yeah, we ain't out here
hunting each other.

746
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:48,859
It's OK, Mojo.

747
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:52,863
We're just messing
around, right, Coyle?

748
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:54,531
Yeah, fine.

749
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,325
Can we please just
go make some money?

750
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:59,452
Just don't piss me off.

751
00:42:59,454 --> 00:42:59,872
Fine.

752
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:21,644
Come on!

753
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:38,846
[gunshots]

754
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:04,620
Martin, Wilcox.

755
00:45:04,622 --> 00:45:07,163
Don't make me shoot
you in the back.

756
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:08,206
You fucking--

757
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:11,920
[gunshots]

758
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:37,655
You-- you killed them
like they were nothing.

759
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:43,074
You better be ready
to do the same if you

760
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,537
want to see your wife again.

761
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:03,344
Ranger, it's Vernon.

762
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:05,346
Go for me.

763
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:08,349
Darky killed Bowen,
so Caleb killed him.

764
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:09,726
We captured a Latina.

765
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:12,813
Bitch was packing a 38.

766
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:13,271
Good job.

767
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,856
Bring her in.

768
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:15,651
Roger that.

769
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,615
We have to go back.

770
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:27,160
If we do, we'll be
killed, just like Jeremy.

771
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:28,745
How could you be so cold?

772
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:30,664
He was your friend, too.

773
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,165
He was more than a friend.

774
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:35,418
He was my partner, and he
would want us to keep going.

775
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,421
I can't leave Gabriella.

776
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:41,341
Her only chance is if
we make it out of here

777
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:43,134
and bring back help.

778
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:47,848
That could take hours, days.

779
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,060
Do you really believe
she'll still be alive then?

780
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:55,774
No.

781
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:00,318
Then I'm going back,
with or without you.

782
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,945
You don't even know
where they are.

783
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:02,904
I'll find them.

784
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,115
If they don't find you first.

785
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:05,868
Either way--

786
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:10,871
Nothing you do is
going to change what's

787
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:12,165
going to happen to Gabriella.

788
00:47:15,168 --> 00:47:17,129
She wouldn't want you
to die for nothing.

789
00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:36,354
Good luck.

790
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:36,857
You too.

791
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,443
[helicopter whirring]

792
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:44,320
Dragonfly, it's [? wolf ?] man.

793
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:45,446
[? go for blue, ?] wolf man.

794
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:47,240
I see you finished your blow.

795
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,324
They're all dead.

796
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:49,450
What?

797
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:51,912
Your survivors didn't
survive so well.

798
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:54,414
That makes six
casualties on our side.

799
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:56,332
We have to get this
bird back to base.

800
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:59,085
We only promise you one pass.

801
00:47:59,087 --> 00:47:59,920
Affirmative.

802
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:01,505
Thanks for the assist.

803
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:03,590
Let God sort them out.

804
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:04,843
Amen, brother.

805
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,109
[distorted sighing]

806
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:25,864
[heavy breathing, grunting]

807
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:36,166
[ominous music]

808
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:54,184
[gunfire]

809
00:49:25,508 --> 00:49:26,509
On the boulder!

810
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:31,427
Ma, Cletus!

811
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:32,596
Leave them be.

812
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:34,430
Can't do anything for them now.

813
00:49:34,432 --> 00:49:35,473
Blood for blood.

814
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:39,104
[fast-paced music]

815
00:49:51,534 --> 00:49:52,783
There she goes!

816
00:49:52,785 --> 00:49:53,700
You two, after her.

817
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:54,618
Come on.

818
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,328
Come on, [inaudible].

819
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:10,343
[rapid gunfire]

820
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,517
There she goes!

821
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:19,186
Hey!

822
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:52,135
[gunshots]

823
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:02,435
[gun clicking]

824
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:14,781
[rapid gunfire]

825
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:17,743
Hey, Grizzly Adams!

826
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:21,373
[rapid gunfire]

827
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:28,380
[heavy breathing]

828
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:37,347
[ominous music]

829
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:57,660
What is it, Annie?

830
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:01,077
Nothing.

831
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:02,538
Let's get that bounty.

832
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:02,954
Hell, yeah.

833
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:03,707
Let's do it.

834
00:52:24,562 --> 00:52:26,394
Caleb's still in the wild.

835
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:27,771
Wait outside.

836
00:52:27,773 --> 00:52:28,814
When do we get our money?

837
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:30,275
When this is over.

838
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:41,952
Welcome to Eden, Gabriella.

839
00:52:41,954 --> 00:52:44,162
We found your idea at your camp.

840
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:45,747
You killed Jeremy, didn't you?

841
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:49,459
Only after he killed
one of our men.

842
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:50,961
Is my husband alive?

843
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:52,378
For now.

844
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,090
But you can help us
bring him in safely.

845
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:57,884
I'm not helping you do shit.

846
00:52:57,886 --> 00:52:59,761
You weren't even
there, were you?

847
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:02,848
There was another woman that
ran away, but it wasn't you.

848
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:08,436
The people we shot were
criminals, not embezzlers, not

849
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:11,147
tax dodgers, real bad guys.

850
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:12,858
That's none of our business.

851
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,151
Let us go, and I swear we'll
never say a word to anyone.

852
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:17,696
We both know better.

853
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:20,490
That's a beautiful cross.

854
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:21,535
Are you a believer?

855
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,997
Jesus Christ is my Savior.

856
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:33,253
That makes this more difficult.
We're a Christian community.

857
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:35,463
Christians don't commit murder.

858
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:37,173
Who's the other woman?

859
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:40,594
Tell me her name, and I'll make
this as easy for you as I can.

860
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:42,137
What difference
does her name make?

861
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:45,891
I like to know who I'm hunting.

862
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:46,725
You're police.

863
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,144
You're supposed
to protect people.

864
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:53,774
We protect our own people.

865
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:58,069
You're the one that
needs protection now.

866
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:01,784
[ominous music]

867
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:15,962
Oof.

868
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:16,882
[grunts]

869
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:34,525
[sobbing]

870
00:54:35,568 --> 00:54:36,858
I've known you most
of your life, Barry.

871
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,569
I brought you into
this department

872
00:54:38,571 --> 00:54:40,195
because you believe
in our cause.

873
00:54:40,197 --> 00:54:43,659
Are you ready to take the next
step into a larger community?

874
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,911
Yes, sir.

875
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:49,871
Then send this bitch
to a better place.

876
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:52,207
[crying]

877
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:53,291
Preach?

878
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:55,126
I understand your
hesitation, son.

879
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:57,420
But it has to be done.

880
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:58,421
Shoot her in the head.

881
00:54:58,423 --> 00:55:02,010
[crying]

882
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:10,141
What are you waiting for?

883
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:11,434
I'm sorry.

884
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:13,103
I just never shot anyone before.

885
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:14,938
That's what our
movement is all about,

886
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:19,275
shouldering responsibility
others are too weak to bear.

887
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:21,402
Don't listen to him, Barry.

888
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:23,780
This has nothing to
do with strength.

889
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:25,281
He's nothing without you.

890
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:27,242
She's trying to confuse you.

891
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:28,702
I'm trying to save you.

892
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:31,287
Shoot her now.

893
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:34,249
Make him do his own dirty work.

894
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:35,500
[crying]

895
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:36,920
God forgive me.

896
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:42,885
[gunshot]

897
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:45,260
Where are you?

898
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:47,848
[ominous music]

899
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:50,849
[groans]

900
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:51,935
Incoming!

901
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:55,105
Gabriella!

902
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,024
Blake!

903
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:00,358
Yes!

904
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,361
[gunshot]

905
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:05,363
Let go of me!

906
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:08,076
[screaming]

907
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:12,372
[rapid gunfire]

908
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,423
No!

909
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:27,095
[crying] Oh, God.

910
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:44,822
Do it.

911
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:49,282
I can't.

912
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:50,869
[gunshot]

913
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:57,417
I hope you get a chance
to redeem yourself.

914
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:01,046
Grab a shovel.

915
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:15,853
[ominous music]

916
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:45,924
You just drop that gun.

917
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:53,265
And the side arms.

918
00:57:57,686 --> 00:57:59,019
Rise and shine.

919
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:02,274
[tense music]

920
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:03,441
Now turn around.

921
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:10,155
I don't know you.

922
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:12,323
I'm not from around here.

923
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:13,825
All you need to
know is that there

924
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:16,077
are people trying to kill me.

925
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:19,497
But that doesn't tell me
a whole lot now, does it?

926
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:22,668
What are you doing here?

927
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,670
I witnessed an execution.

928
00:58:24,672 --> 00:58:26,046
Hmm.

929
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:27,506
That explains the
shooting that I

930
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:30,509
heard today, thought
it sounded livelier

931
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:33,053
than the usual tomfoolery.

932
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:33,514
Get inside.

933
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:38,517
I would feel safer
with my weapons.

934
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:42,147
Well, I'd be safer
with them out here.

935
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:57,744
Their camp was here.

936
00:58:57,746 --> 00:59:01,497
She took out green team here
and is moving in this direction.

937
00:59:01,499 --> 00:59:02,833
Frances is out there.

938
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:04,417
Frances won't help her.

939
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:06,419
She'll shoot anyone that
sets foot on our property.

940
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:07,671
Crazy bitches stick together.

941
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:10,757
Says the man who was drummed
out of the army on a Section 8.

942
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:12,425
Oh, you're looking
for a beat down.

943
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:13,426
Squash this.

944
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:15,303
I have enough problems
to deal with while you

945
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:17,723
two nitwits going at it.

946
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:20,183
Orange team to blue command.

947
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:21,602
Go for blue command.

948
00:59:21,604 --> 00:59:22,644
Wagners are dead.

949
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,730
She took him out a close range.

950
00:59:24,732 --> 00:59:27,608
I like her style.

951
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:35,198
So John Preacher killed
some folks today.

952
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,324
My god.

953
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:41,204
The fools have
finally gone too far.

954
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:43,498
I need a phone.

955
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,959
The radio I took won't reach
far enough to do me any good.

956
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:49,546
Yeah, well, you came
to the wrong place.

957
00:59:49,548 --> 00:59:50,589
What about a car?

958
00:59:50,591 --> 00:59:52,674
Oh, I just got a daughter
in town with a car.

959
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:56,887
But she only checks in
on me every few days.

960
00:59:56,889 --> 00:59:59,515
It's a lovely little
town you got here.

961
00:59:59,517 --> 01:00:04,770
Yeah, well, I live here
because I always have,

962
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:07,272
not for the company.

963
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:10,859
Why is everybody
following this Sheriff?

964
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:15,446
Well, I'll tell you.

965
01:00:15,448 --> 01:00:18,784
You know the Revolutionary War?

966
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:23,079
Well, there was a battle that
was fought in these hills.

967
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:27,417
A handful of
farmers, Minutemen--

968
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:32,088
they held off the red coats
until the militia arrived.

969
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,424
Now the folks that
live around here--

970
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:37,803
well, they're descendants
of those brave souls.

971
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:39,846
So you see, tradition--

972
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:41,682
it's important to us.

973
01:00:41,684 --> 01:00:44,810
It's in our blood.

974
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:46,812
That tradition include murder?

975
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:48,564
Oh, those Billy Bobs--

976
01:00:48,566 --> 01:00:51,567
they're prepping for a
war against the government

977
01:00:51,569 --> 01:00:54,570
that they can't possibly win.

978
01:00:54,572 --> 01:00:56,572
I mean, mostly it's
just a show so they

979
01:00:56,574 --> 01:00:59,032
can play with their damn guns.

980
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:01,451
They got a bunker not
very far from here,

981
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:04,830
some kind of a training camp.

982
01:01:04,832 --> 01:01:10,669
I wonder if there might not be
some kind of a radio set there

983
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:14,089
that you could use
to call for help.

984
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:17,761
[car approaching]

985
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:28,522
Stay still if you
want to stay alive.

986
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:38,406
[suspenseful music]

987
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:53,461
What are you boys
doing on my property?

988
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:54,963
Now, hold on, Frances.

989
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,507
We don't want any trouble.

990
01:01:56,509 --> 01:01:58,884
Well, get in your vehicle,
and there won't be any.

991
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:00,010
We're looking for a woman.

992
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:01,595
Try a whorehouse.

993
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:03,263
This one's dangerous.

994
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:04,890
And I'm not?

995
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:05,891
She's armed.

996
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:07,100
You don't say.

997
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:08,519
We have to look inside.

998
01:02:08,521 --> 01:02:10,687
You do, and I'll shoot you.

999
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:13,899
Nobody comes inside
without an invitation.

1000
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:17,152
And I'm not feeling very
hospitable right now.

1001
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:19,154
This is a matter
of law, Frances.

1002
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:21,907
Who's law, yours or mine?

1003
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:22,949
There's only one law.

1004
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:27,203
On my land, that's me.

1005
01:02:27,205 --> 01:02:29,665
Is she here or not?

1006
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:34,169
You missed her by
20, maybe 30 minutes.

1007
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:37,964
She asked for directions to the
highway, so I gave them to her.

1008
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:39,090
Did she give you her name?

1009
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:41,843
No, she didn't mention that.

1010
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:45,346
She did say that you idiots
killed some folks today.

1011
01:02:45,348 --> 01:02:47,098
She killed some herself--

1012
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,224
good men.

1013
01:02:48,226 --> 01:02:50,727
[laughs] There hasn't
been a good man

1014
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:55,190
around here since my husband
died, God rest his soul.

1015
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:57,025
Have a blessed day, Frances.

1016
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,820
Keep your door locked
until this is over.

1017
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:07,162
Hey, you go looking for judgment
day, you may just find it.

1018
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:22,092
[car engine starting]

1019
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:25,929
Go uphill for about a mile
till you come to a side road.

1020
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:29,683
That'll take you to the
bunker that I told you about.

1021
01:03:29,685 --> 01:03:31,852
If I had had my
weapons just now,

1022
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:33,103
I could have finished this.

1023
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:36,648
Well, first of all, I
just saved your life.

1024
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,942
And second, you're welcome.

1025
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:41,319
Now get the hell out of
here before somebody else

1026
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:45,448
gets killed, namely me.

1027
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,118
Thank you.

1028
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:54,835
Hey, if they pin you
down, give them hell.

1029
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:10,265
Why aren't you back
at the station?

1030
01:04:10,267 --> 01:04:13,018
Walter said that you needed
this force woman's jacket right

1031
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,772
away, so I ran it over myself.

1032
01:04:16,774 --> 01:04:18,064
That's her.

1033
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:21,777
Her father was Buffalo
PD Brass, and her brother

1034
01:04:21,779 --> 01:04:22,944
carried a gold shield.

1035
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:25,196
She's only been on
the job for two years.

1036
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:26,447
A bitch and a rookie.

1037
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:27,949
Nice language.

1038
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,367
You can go now, Kayleigh.

1039
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:32,162
Guess I'll go file my nails.

1040
01:04:32,164 --> 01:04:33,789
She served in the
National Guard,

1041
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,166
and spent two years
in Alibaba land.

1042
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:37,208
Combat?

1043
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,209
Motor pool.

1044
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:41,046
She trained for a war
she never got to fight.

1045
01:04:41,048 --> 01:04:41,924
So did we.

1046
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:02,861
[suspenseful music]

1047
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:27,300
Hello?

1048
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:28,011
Hello?

1049
01:05:32,558 --> 01:05:33,557
Fuck.

1050
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:37,187
[suspenseful music]

1051
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,988
Whatever you're
thinking, forget it.

1052
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:50,242
Drop your hardware,
and raise your hands.

1053
01:05:56,582 --> 01:05:58,333
Nice and slow, darling.

1054
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:06,464
Step forward so you're not
tempted to do anything stupid.

1055
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:10,552
We can take you back with
your face or without it.

1056
01:06:10,554 --> 01:06:13,304
Thought most of you yahoos
around here were men.

1057
01:06:13,306 --> 01:06:14,430
Freedom fighters.

1058
01:06:14,432 --> 01:06:15,682
Domestic terrorists.

1059
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:18,059
Annie, I'm tired of her mouth.

1060
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:19,435
I like her mouth.

1061
01:06:19,437 --> 01:06:20,103
[laughs]

1062
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:22,438
It isn't smart to antagonize us.

1063
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,024
Cuff her, Jo.

1064
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:26,652
With pleasure.

1065
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:28,695
You don't have to do this.

1066
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:31,447
You could walk away or help me.

1067
01:06:31,449 --> 01:06:34,576
In the name of sisterhood,
we've got 10,000 reasons

1068
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:36,662
not to roll over for you.

1069
01:06:36,664 --> 01:06:38,163
A bounty.

1070
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:40,832
3,300 apiece, not bad
for an afternoon's work.

1071
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:42,460
We didn't even have
to fire a shot.

1072
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:48,632
Fire!

1073
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:52,262
[rapid fire]

1074
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:57,560
[gunshots]

1075
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:20,290
[suspenseful music]

1076
01:07:39,602 --> 01:07:41,810
Hey, good looking.

1077
01:07:41,812 --> 01:07:43,604
Why did you 86 them?

1078
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:45,188
You're on the same team.

1079
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,858
You capped those broads, not me.

1080
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,612
Now I kill you, collect $10,000.

1081
01:07:51,614 --> 01:07:54,364
I've already got 10 coming to me
for killing your Black friend.

1082
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:55,618
What about my other friends?

1083
01:07:58,746 --> 01:08:00,330
You're the last of the Mohicans.

1084
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,512
It was boring around
here until you showed up.

1085
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:21,685
Pick it up if you want to dance.

1086
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:51,379
Ooh, fight back.

1087
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:52,299
I like rough.

1088
01:08:58,639 --> 01:08:59,596
[grunting]

1089
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:00,764
Ah.

1090
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:01,433
Ah.

1091
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,649
[growls]

1092
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:13,654
[grunting]

1093
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:26,333
Body shots, huh?

1094
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:36,844
[grunting, groaning]

1095
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:45,686
[thudding]

1096
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:55,362
[grunting]

1097
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:06,624
[grunting, groaning]

1098
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:14,923
[screaming]

1099
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:26,850
You fucking bitch!

1100
01:10:26,852 --> 01:10:27,475
[gunfire]

1101
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:30,773
[screaming]

01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:39,782
[gunshots]

1103
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:47,205
[breathing heavily]

1104
01:10:51,669 --> 01:10:52,836
Orange team, come in.

1105
01:10:55,964 --> 01:10:57,005
Preacher for orange team.

1106
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:57,675
Come in.

1107
01:11:01,178 --> 01:11:03,303
Go for orange.

1108
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:05,681
What's your 20?

1109
01:11:05,683 --> 01:11:08,224
I'm at some old training camp.

1110
01:11:08,226 --> 01:11:09,601
Annie?

1111
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:11,728
Annie's dead, so are
the rest of them.

1112
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:14,981
Some asshole with long hair
got them before I got him.

1113
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:16,733
Caleb.

1114
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,151
Turn yourself in, Megan.

1115
01:11:18,153 --> 01:11:20,111
There's no escaping.

1116
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:23,239
[laughs]

1117
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:26,326
I don't want to
escape, Preacher.

1118
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:27,703
You started this.

1119
01:11:27,705 --> 01:11:29,746
I'm going to finish it.

1120
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:32,248
I'm going to finish you.

1121
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:36,294
You triggered the
wrong bitch today.

1122
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:37,005
Out.

1123
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,882
Hello?

1124
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:42,258
Hello?

1125
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,345
Son of a whore.

1126
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:48,223
Vernon, don't go to that camp.

1127
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,891
It's a trap.

1128
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:51,768
There's a debt to be paid
for Caleb, and I [inaudible]..

1129
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,436
I'm in charge of this operation!

1130
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:54,938
I order you to stay put!

1131
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,691
And I thought you was
about personal freedom.

1132
01:11:57,693 --> 01:11:58,775
Come on, boys.

1133
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:00,696
Let's go break out the big gun.

1134
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:06,324
What now, Preach?

1135
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:07,826
Circle the wagons.

1136
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:11,329
Pull all of our other
people off the roadblocks.

1137
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:16,837
Mom, Dad, I got myself
into a real jam.

1138
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:22,217
And I couldn't save my friends.

1139
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:27,014
I wish I could.

1140
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,432
I'm going to take a
record of everything that

1141
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:32,728
goes down today.

1142
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:41,735
Before that, I want you to
know how much I love you

1143
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:43,739
and how much I wish I
could see you again.

1144
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:53,204
I--

1145
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:56,835
[crying]

1146
01:12:57,419 --> 01:13:00,962
I'm sorry.

1147
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:04,090
I'm sorry I couldn't save them.

1148
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:06,009
I'm sorry.

1149
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:08,386
I just wanted to
be good for you.

1150
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:10,098
I just wanted to make you proud.

1151
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:16,978
But I'm going to
make things right.

1152
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,564
If it's the last
thing I would do,

1153
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:21,399
I'm going to make things right.

1154
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:25,030
[car aproaching]

1155
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:42,671
Padlocks off the door.

1156
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:44,007
She broke in there.

1157
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:07,322
[rapid gunfire]

1158
01:14:24,256 --> 01:14:24,963
Take over.

1159
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:25,964
Keep your finger
off the trigger.

1160
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:30,093
I don't want you
perforating me prematurely.

1161
01:14:30,095 --> 01:14:31,096
I ain't no idiot.

1162
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:40,438

[ominous music]

1167
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:16,533
Let's go!

1168
01:16:16,535 --> 01:16:17,200
Hurry up!

1169
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:18,619
Let's go!

1170
01:16:18,621 --> 01:16:20,203
Come on!

1171
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:20,664
Let's go!

1172
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:27,628
No screwing around.

1173
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:28,754
We take this bitch out.

1174
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:30,296
We go home.

1175
01:16:30,298 --> 01:16:32,257
Everyone goes home.

1176
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:33,301
Let's do it.

1177
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,226

[gunfire]

1185
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,142
Get the hell out of here!

1186
01:18:06,144 --> 01:18:07,769
Do you want to get
shot in the back?

1187
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:09,356
[gun clicking]

1188
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,108
She's out of ammo.

1189
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:14,486
I wouldn't count on that.

1190
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:17,738

Oh, good god.

1195
01:18:41,514 --> 01:18:43,514
Here comes the crazy train.

1196
01:18:43,516 --> 01:18:45,056
Well, who's that?

1197
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:47,017
She who must not be named.

1198
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:50,896
[chuckles]

1199
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:51,940
Park it somewhere safe.

1200
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,156
Congresswoman Dahlly.

1201
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:02,490
Get out.

1202
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:03,116
Welcome home.

1203
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:04,535
Mm.

1204
01:19:04,537 --> 01:19:06,286
There is no way I was
going to miss this.

1205
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:08,288
Only the female cop is left.

1206
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:09,748
We lost a lot of people today.

1207
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,918
You just tell me where
to find the bitch.

1208
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,590
[music playing]

1209
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:34,648
Red team, come in.

1210
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:35,943
Vernon, are you out there?

1211
01:19:38,278 --> 01:19:41,822
How about my strike team?

1212
01:19:41,824 --> 01:19:44,616
Damn it.

1213
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:46,034
I think it's time
we packed it in.

1214
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:47,202
Have you lost your mind?

1215
01:19:47,204 --> 01:19:48,704
I think we all have.

1216
01:19:48,706 --> 01:19:50,246
Are you going to spend
the rest of your life

1217
01:19:50,248 --> 01:19:52,082
in prison over one woman?

1218
01:19:52,084 --> 01:19:53,875
Beats being dead.

1219
01:19:53,877 --> 01:19:55,293
What will the council say?

1220
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:56,753
Think about your family.

1221
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:58,338
I am thinking about them.

1222
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,757
Pick up, Preacher.

1223
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:02,636
Are you going to
get that, or am I?

1224
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:07,055
Go for me.

1225
01:20:07,057 --> 01:20:10,058
I handled red team and
the other deputies.

1226
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,769
The rest of you are under
arrest for murder and accessory.

1227
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:15,271
You've got 30 seconds
to lay down your arms.

1228
01:20:15,273 --> 01:20:16,773
You're out of your jurisdiction.

1229
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:19,234
You're not even on active duty.

1230
01:20:19,236 --> 01:20:20,736
Call it a citizen's arrest.

1231
01:20:20,738 --> 01:20:23,321
How many people
did you kill today?

1232
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:25,991
Ask me again when I see you.

1233
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:26,491
I'm done.

1234
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:27,743
Screw my pension.

1235
01:20:27,745 --> 01:20:30,662
You want to leave, be my guest.

1236
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:33,039
Time's up.

1237
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:33,624
[ominous music]

1238
01:20:33,626 --> 01:20:37,168
We're in the shit now.

1239
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,336
I didn't sign up for this.

1240
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:40,964
Well, man the fuck up.

1241
01:20:40,966 --> 01:20:43,967
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:48,221

Ah.

01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,234

need a bigger gun.

Drop your weapons now!

[music playing]

1259
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:53,865
Recognize this?

1260
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:58,119
Please, I have a wife, a son.

1261
01:23:58,121 --> 01:23:59,663
My friends had families, too.

1262
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:00,747
Jesus.

1263
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:03,875
I don't even know if Blake
and Gabriella had kids.

1264
01:24:03,877 --> 01:24:05,711
I had a brother and
a brother-in-law

1265
01:24:05,713 --> 01:24:07,420
until about two minutes ago.

1266
01:24:07,422 --> 01:24:09,715
You have a knack
for killing lawmen.

1267
01:24:09,717 --> 01:24:11,842
What do you know about the law?

1268
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:14,302
I know how little
a street cop makes.

1269
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:16,805
I have $80,000 from
those traffickers.

1270
01:24:16,807 --> 01:24:18,599
It's yours if you let me go.

1271
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:21,226
Give it to those
families if you want to.

1272
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:23,436
Get on your feet.

1273
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:24,106
Up.

1274
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:31,152
Where is it?

1275
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:32,195
Do we have a deal?

1276
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:34,155
Show me the money first.

1277
01:24:34,157 --> 01:24:35,782
You have me at a disadvantage.

1278
01:24:35,784 --> 01:24:37,158
You got that right.

1279
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,121
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

1280
01:24:42,332 --> 01:24:44,625
It's in the glove compartment.

1281

1282
01:24:53,343 --> 01:24:56,597
You are a disgrace
to that uniform.

1283
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:02,520
Take it off now!

1284
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:09,693
Take it all off.

1285
01:25:17,951 --> 01:25:20,287
Eighty grand.

1286
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:23,541
Was it worth it?

1287
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:25,709
Takes money to build an army.

1288
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,962
Did Gabriella beg for her life?

1289
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:34,841
How about Blake, hmm?

1290
01:25:34,843 --> 01:25:37,427
Mistakes were made.

1291
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:38,887
I'll give you that.

1292
01:25:38,889 --> 01:25:41,848
But if you pull that trigger
and shoot me in cold blood--

1293
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,474
I'll be no better than you?

1294
01:25:43,476 --> 01:25:45,561
You already pushed
me over that line.

1295
01:25:45,563 --> 01:25:47,813
-You wanted to be pushed.
-You think you know me?

1296
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:49,898
You only became a cop
because of your daddy,

1297
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,441
but you couldn't
handle the shit.

1298
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:53,610
Now you're trying to prove
you have what it takes.

1299
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:56,655
You murdered my friends.

1300
01:25:56,657 --> 01:25:58,740
If you were going
to kill me,

1301
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:00,828
you would have pulled
that trigger already.

No!

1306
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:21,682
I don't want to put you down.

1307
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:25,559
I want to put you away.

1308
01:26:25,561 --> 01:26:26,852
Get your hands on your head.

1309
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:27,730
I'm taking you in.

1310
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:34,735
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

1311
01:26:34,737 --> 01:26:36,486
I think I do.

1312
01:26:36,488 --> 01:26:38,446
You guys aren't all
that hard to figure out.

1313
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:41,034
We just might surprise you.

1314
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:45,372
FBI is going to love
your ass,

1315
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:49,835
so is gen pop.

1316
01:26:51,837 --> 01:26:54,965
You don't want my
friends for enemies.

[scoffs]

1318
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,763
They don't want me for an enemy.

1319
01:27:02,765 --> 01:27:04,933
You just assassinated
a Congresswoman.

1320
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:07,770
I'm probably going to get
a book deal on a TV show.

1321
01:27:10,648 --> 01:27:11,732
You know what to do.

1322
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:21,659
Tighter.

1323
01:27:24,787 --> 01:27:27,788
We have chapters all
over the country.

1324
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:29,792
They'll find you, no
matter where you hide.

1325
01:27:34,254 --> 01:27:37,005
I'm not hiding.

1326
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:38,590
That a girl.

1327
01:27:38,592 --> 01:27:41,134
Daddy would be proud.

1328
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:44,682
[siren wailing]

1329
01:27:46,224 --> 01:27:47,265
What is that?

01:27:47,267 --> 01:27:48,684
[laughs]

1331
01:27:48,686 --> 01:27:49,851
What the fuck is that?

1332
01:27:49,853 --> 01:27:50,854
[chuckles]

1333
01:27:53,566 --> 01:27:55,982
We were just the
first responders.

1334
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:58,860
Do you realize how many men
there are in this county,

1335
01:27:58,862 --> 01:28:00,236
how many guns?

1336
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:02,989
Well, it's a good thing
I have you with me.

1337
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:06,618
Too bad you just killed
my hostage negotiator.

1338
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,787
There won't be any negotiating.

1339
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:11,372
You'll never get
out of here alive.

1340
01:28:11,374 --> 01:28:13,083
And neither will you.

1341
01:28:13,085 --> 01:28:14,960
We'll see.

1342
01:28:14,962 --> 01:28:15,713
Get moving.

"WILL I EVER BE THE SAME?"]

1345
01:28:59,715 --> 01:29:01,216
(SINGING) The wind
is full of lies.

1346
01:29:04,011 --> 01:29:09,931
A flying bullet
cries and searches

1347
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:15,814
for the mark to kill and
cool a burning flame.

1348
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:20,235
Will I ever be the same?

1349
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:29,912
A carnival of fools.

1350
01:29:32,831 --> 01:29:37,417
The master steals the jewels.

1351
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:43,383
Hiding from the flame that
goes beyond another name.

1352
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:53,936
The wind is blowing cold,
telling stories never told.

1353
01:29:56,104 --> 01:30:00,231
I'm screaming for
the final life.

1354
01:30:00,233 --> 01:30:02,861
Who will take the blame?

1355
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,365
Will I ever be the same?

1356
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:48,029
The wind is full of lies.

The final bullet flies,
searching for another life,

1358
01:30:56,039 --> 01:31:01,752
a sole, a prize to claim.

1359
01:31:01,754 --> 01:31:04,339
Will I ever be the same?

1360
01:31:11,972 --> 01:31:18,020
Searching for the truth to
tell, when will I decide?

1361
01:31:21,231 --> 01:31:26,236
I can never cry and hide.
