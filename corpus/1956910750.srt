1
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:23,106
They lock in those coordinates?

2
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:29,145
No, not yet they're still
tryin' to pinpoint its location.

3
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,450
Flynn, if it's drifted
behind the moon,

4
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:37,552
there's no way they can
lock in the coordinates.

5
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:38,553
Bullshit.

6
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,657
A nuclear arms spy satellite
roaming freely in space?

7
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:43,858
Come on somebody down there

8
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:45,139
doesn't have their shit together.

9
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:50,232
Call Spacecore Central and
find out what the delay is.

10
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,435
We're way over due on
that coordinate update.

11
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,571
Houston, this is Spacecore One.

12
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:57,572
Come in please.

13
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:03,678
What the hell was that?

14
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,181
Lock automatic boost control.

15
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,184
Come in Houston this is
Spacecore One.

16
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,921
Not responding.

17
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,628
This is Spacecore One come in Houston.

18
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:23,233
Ooh, god dammit.

19
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:25,334
Get Paxton.

20
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:33,742
Paxton, it's Giles.

21
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:35,244
What's up gents.

22
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:37,246
We're having trouble with
the R3s and the stackers.

23
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:39,481
Even the fifth system
everything is down.

24
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,451
Have you tried adjusting the outlays?

25
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,118
Yep.

26
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:47,223
Paxton, just see if you can
get an override through Lesli.

27
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:49,759
Alright, give me a moment.

28
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,863
Lesli, we need an
over ride on the bridge.

29
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:08,477
Lesli, what do you mean functional?

30
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,046
According to the bridge,
nothing is functional.

31
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:14,249
Everything is working accordingly.

32
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:19,789
Talk to me, Paxton.

33
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:23,091
Lesli, can't over ride
because everything

34
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,726
is listed as functional.

35
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:26,661
We can't go to backup until
we discovered

36
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:29,631
just what, if anything, is wrong.

37
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:30,800
I'll be up in a second.

38
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:58,561
What?

39
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,881
Set inherent dynamic stability.

40
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:22,116
Well, isn't this romantic?

41
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:24,420
Time for candlelight and Courvoisier.

42
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,028
Flynn, what's going on?

43
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,933
Why don't you tell us?

44
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:41,503
You said all systems were functional.

45
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:42,838
No, Lesli said that.

46
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,676
Well, at least we have
auxiliary lighting.

47
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:50,244
Yeah, but for how long?

48
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:52,347
300 and, uh...

49
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:55,884
336 hours that's two weeks,
and not to worry

50
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:57,752
we'll get her up and running.

51
00:07:57,753 --> 00:07:59,087
Y'all can forget about two weeks.

52
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:00,790
We got 24 hours if we're lucky.

53
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:05,395
24 hours?

54
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,029
Yeah.

55
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:13,535
Sir, auxiliary systems
were hit pretty bad.

56
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,304
They appear normal,
but there's no response.

57
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:17,939
It's like suddenly they
got a mind of their own.

58
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,742
Up till now I don't have
a clue what happened.

59
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:22,644
In all the backups?

60
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:24,112
Yep.

61
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:26,781
I believe, we're gonna
be cooked big time.

62
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:28,883
We got 24 hours auxiliary,

63
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,486
but that don't matter because
the oxygen can't last,

64
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,021
and it's gonna get cold.

65
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:34,724
Temperatures will drop below zero.

66
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:37,427
That's a mouthful of good news.

67
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:41,430
What's happening?

68
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:42,832
Go ahead tell her.

69
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:45,634
We'll you see, Cookie,

70
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:48,169
without power we can't
replenish the air,

71
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,638
and you better button
up because it's gonna be

72
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,806
colder than bluegrass
in Alaska in here.

73
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,743
Hi, Doc, glad you're here.

74
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:58,847
What about solar?

75
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,518
We can't lock into the sun.

76
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,753
Why?

77
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,989
Because we're drifting
towards Centrus B-40.

78
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:10,225
Centrus B-40?

79
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,862
The dark side of the moon.

80
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:17,832
We've lost engine power, life support.

81
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,034
No shit.

82
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:21,870
I thought you were supposed
to be

83
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,972
the authority on the system.

84
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:33,314
What programs were you running?

85
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:36,117
Listen, I've been
flying too many years

86
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,686
to start pushing the wrong buttons.

87
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:40,790
Now clearly the problem is in Lesli.

88
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:44,493
She doesn't run this ship,
you do.

89
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,164
Listen you guys, I think,
we can be

90
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:51,967
a little bit more
constructive here.

91
00:09:54,737 --> 00:09:55,737
You're right.

92
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:57,907
We can't waste time about it.

93
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,642
Let's do a comp analysis.

94
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,712
We'll check her out top to bottom.

95
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,126
Status update, Jennings?

96
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:20,463
Yeah, choppin' outsets okay.

97
00:10:21,597 --> 00:10:24,365
And running circuits are integrated.

98
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,300
What about the interlocks?

99
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:27,703
I got Alex workin' on that

100
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,773
'cause it's such a tight fit.

101
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,142
Dammit, Jennings,
can't you concentrate on this.

102
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:35,910
We're in deep shit here.

103
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:37,045
Cookie, with you around it gets

104
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,613
harder and harder all the time.

105
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:40,182
In fact, you know somethin' else

106
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:44,086
it might be your last chance
to get into my flight suit.

107
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:48,122
Tell you what, why don't
you make a pass at Lesli, huh?

108
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:50,192
Just your type, 100% robotic.

109
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:53,327
Hmm.

110
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,234
Set giro flux gate.

111
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,273
Flip that F switch
it's the white one.

112
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:06,609
The white one?

113
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:10,344
God.

114
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:13,281
Shit.

115
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,753
Flynn, try the power
feed on the syndicator.

116
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,055
Anything?

117
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:23,257
No, nothin'.

118
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,561
Synapse are intact.

119
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:29,298
No broken cables or feed lines.

120
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,635
I don't know understand this, Flynn.

121
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:35,304
Everything should be functional.

122
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,075
This is Spacecore One mayday.

123
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:42,176
Mayday!

124
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:44,979
Mayday!

125
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,116
This is Spacecore One please acknowledge.

126
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:49,117
Mayday!

127
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:51,152
Mayday!

128
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:55,624
Vector 4-5-1, we're an
approaching Centrus B-40.

129
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,359
This is Spacecore One please
come in.

130
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,694
Is there anyone there?

131
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:01,262
Mayday.

132
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,897
Come in please.

133
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:03,898
Mayday.

134
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:11,305
Goddamn it's cold.

135
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:16,510
Huh, I'm freezing, Jesus.

136
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,746
Here you go guys.

137
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:19,080
Oh, I could use a cup.

138
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,515
Yeah.

139
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:23,052
Now we're talkin'.

140
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:32,261
Paxton, your tea is closest
to you.

141
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,300
Thank you, dear.

142
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:46,975
Jesus!

143
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,477
Christ!

144
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,046
Hey, you knew it had to be hot.

145
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,047
Christ, no.

146
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,850
It has cream in it.

147
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,652
He's allergic to it, Alex.

148
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:58,821
I'm not just allergic.

149
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,991
Fibrillation of the heart leading
to a major cardiac arrest.

150
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:04,726
Is that a problem?

151
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:06,227
It's not a pretty sight.

152
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:07,662
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

153
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,964
You know, you could've told me.

154
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:11,934
Activate tach cam nav beacon.

155
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:29,450
Yeah, so Lesli's on automatic.

156
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:30,384
It'll play throughout the night.

157
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:31,753
Alex just ran the logs.

158
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:34,555
There's not a livin'
thing anywhere near us.

159
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:35,624
Jennings, put the cigarette out.

160
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,358
What the fuck for?

161
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,161
Because we have to conserve air.

162
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,530
Look the SOS is fail safe.

163
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,898
Somebody'll pick it up.

164
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:45,199
Pick this up.

165
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,334
Put it out.

166
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:49,271
Hey, something's out there.

167
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:53,843
It's comin' right at us.

168
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,625
This is Spacecore One come in please.

169
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,163
This is Spacecore One come in please.

170
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:20,101
We have a visual on you.

171
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:22,104
Acknowledge please, over.

172
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,340
Vector mission micrometry.

173
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:27,877
There's no response.

174
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,114
It doesn't really matter.

175
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:36,418
They must know we're here.

176
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:39,788
Christ, will y'all look at that?

177
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:44,993
I'll be dammed.

178
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:47,461
It looks like the Settler.

179
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:48,697
Initiate darkening.

180
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:51,733
Discovery from the old NASA program.

181
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,768
Jesus, I didn't know
those things still flew.

182
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:56,470
Program docking beacon.

183
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:59,007
It looks like it's
been through hell.

184
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:05,413
Giles, why don't you go down
to airlock

185
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:06,548
and greet our guests.

186
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:10,052
Rate of closure steady.

187
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:21,396
Unknown contact on final approach.

188
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,211
Activate airlock thruster pods.

189
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:45,487
I hope they know what they're doing.

190
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:47,688
So far so good.

191
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,838
Why don't they make contact?

192
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:05,240
Warning: Mask secure.

193
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:08,716
What the hell are they waitin' for?

194
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,649
Giles, what's going on down there?

195
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,686
Not a thing.

196
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,555
Okay, Giles, I'm comin' down.

197
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:22,624
Let's get suited up.

198
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:25,961
If they won't come to us,
we'll go to them.

199
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:43,912
Here you go.

200
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,279
Two RTCs.

201
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,082
Rapid fire chambers,
extended barrel, full chocks,

202
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,552
heat sensor sized tracers included.

203
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,222
Hey, it can't hurt.

204
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,093
Wish I had me one of these
babies when I was in Nicaragua.

205
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,332
Look, you sure you don't
want me to come with you?

206
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,200
I mean, what if there are a
couple of hostiles on that ship?

207
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,902
I'm the only one that's
trained to handle it.

208
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:12,773
Jennings, if I can locate
this other ship's resources,

209
00:17:12,774 --> 00:17:15,710
I need you here to set
it up from our side.

210
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:20,415
Okay, happy huntin'.

211
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:42,304
Alex, you readin' me?

212
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:45,174
You're comin' in great, Giles.

213
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,609
Your suit is reading fine.

214
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:50,279
Giles,

215
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:52,846
be careful.

216
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,992
Ships got an A-390.

217
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,059
How do we open it?

218
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:11,133
Well, there should be a C
cylinder attached underneath.

219
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:18,072
Alex, the code sequence is

220
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:21,075
7-W-8-2-4.

221
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:22,610
Look it up.

222
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:23,611
All right.

223
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:28,217
See anything?

224
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:30,585
Nah, it's too dark.

225
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:35,857
It's the damnedest
thing I've ever seen.

226
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:47,735
Alright, we've got it for you.

227
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:50,872
Punch 25-delta-76.

228
00:18:58,247 --> 00:18:59,580
It opened.

229
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:00,581
Goin' in.

230
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:14,663
I'm not sure it looks like
we've got water damage.

231
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,901
Alex, I want a molecular read out

232
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:23,104
the moment we actually step inside.

233
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:28,110
Please hurry,
we're almost out of air.

234
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:46,860
Oh, Christ look at this.

235
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:47,861
Auxiliary lines.

236
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,498
Alex, you got a reading yet?

237
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:53,467
Yes, their oxygen level is fine.

238
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:54,968
All other compounds are normal

239
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:57,171
except for a high level of sulfur.

240
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:58,407
The temperature is a 106.

241
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:03,712
That's impossible they
don't have any power.

242
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,081
Okay.

243
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,850
We're gonna go find the
bridge now.

244
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,552
Wait a minute.

245
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:12,886
What is it?

246
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:14,922
Check the monitor on your suit, Giles.

247
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,024
I'm getting some interference.

248
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,726
Atmospherics are goin' crazy!

249
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,394
What the?

250
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:21,563
This is weird.

251
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:36,244
How's that?

252
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:37,979
Wait a minute it's changing back.

253
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,749
What did you do?

254
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:43,785
Used a little high tech ingenuity.

255
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:46,187
We're moving on.

256
00:21:21,723 --> 00:21:22,723
Flynn, over here.

257
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:29,798
Flynn, don't touch anything yet.

258
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:32,900
How do we know it's compatible?

259
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:34,502
It's a U.S. ship, isn't it?

260
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,337
I'm concerned about air quality.

261
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:39,140
Flynn, we know nothing
about that ship.

262
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:41,442
Who knows what could've
gotten into their air supply.

263
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:42,943
Paxton, we don't have much choice.

264
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:45,313
Alex said the air in here is fine.

265
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:49,016
That was a crude atmospheric
analysis at best.

266
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,154
Well, we're gonna have to
roll the dice on this one.

267
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:26,887
It's in.

268
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,101
Anything happenin' over there yet?

269
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:43,537
We're all breathing a bit
easier, thanks.

270
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:00,855
The fuel tanks are empty.

271
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,258
Then what was she flyin' on?

272
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:07,094
Better yet who the hell was
flying her?

273
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,101
There was a NASA flight crew
on this ship.

274
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:49,371
It couldn't be.

275
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:52,374
NASA hasn't been flying for
30 years.

276
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:01,048
This is weirder than the
Flying Dutchman.

277
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:23,738
Alex, are you getting
any imbalances around me?

278
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:26,374
You alright?

279
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,143
Everything checks out okay.

280
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:34,383
I don't know I thought I saw something.

281
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,352
Keep your eyes on the monitor, okay.

282
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:54,502
Core samples from Centrus B-40?

283
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:56,871
What the hell
would they want with these?

284
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,311
Giles, where are you?

285
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:04,845
Cargo bay.

286
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:07,315
Well, the molecular
structure is changing again.

287
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:09,850
Is there an air vent or
a heating duct nearby?

288
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:10,818
I don't know we're
standing in the middle

289
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:13,053
of the goddamn room.

290
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,456
Well, look around you, Giles.

291
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:16,825
Something is changing it.

292
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,628
Jesus, Alex, are you sure
there's not a damn thing

293
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:22,229
in here except for us?

294
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,532
Giles, if you're in cargo bay,

295
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:27,501
you may be getting an
exhaust feed from above.

296
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:50,859
I took this mission
because I wanted to relax,

297
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,962
and I figured a bandage here
or there.

298
00:25:56,465 --> 00:25:57,465
Jesus.

299
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:03,471
A lot of good this did him.

300
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:06,306
Alex, could you bring
the tray over here please?

301
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:07,307
Yeah.

302
00:26:24,526 --> 00:26:25,526
Oh.

303
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,931
Looks like a knife cut him.

304
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:33,401
Uh, no, a knife wouldn't cauterize.

305
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:34,702
What about a laser?

306
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:35,969
No.

307
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,672
The cut would be deeper.

308
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:40,475
Perhaps it was suicide?

309
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:43,611
Well, I won't rule it out.

310
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:45,112
You said he was hanging
from the rafters.

311
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:47,048
Perhaps he got caught
up in the fall.

312
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:52,119
Why would he dock the
ship and then kill himself?

313
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,655
I'm a doctor not a detective.

314
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:56,824
Maybe there's someone
else on the ship?

315
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:04,031
Jennings, I want
you to give me a hand.

316
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:05,966
We're gonna seal off that airlock.

317
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:07,287
I'm with you on that.

318
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:14,909
What the?

319
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:21,181
Well, looks like we'll
be getting some heat.

320
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:24,585
Let me know when you guys
come up with somethin', huh?

321
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:26,119
Mm-hmm.

322
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,822
I'll be up in the computer room.

323
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,159
What is it?

324
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,595
I'm going to access Lesli.

325
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:37,899
May I ask why?

326
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:41,570
Let's just say I need to talk
to her.

327
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:07,060
Hello, Paxton.

328
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,629
Hello, Lesli.

329
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,000
Um, Lieutenant Giles is here
to ask you a few questions.

330
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,769
What is his clearance code please?

331
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,238
B306.

332
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:20,240
Paxton, Lieutenant
Giles does not have

333
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,644
security clearance to access
my files.

334
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:25,879
Why not?

335
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,316
Well, it's a security override
that I added to the system.

336
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:30,684
Purely, a precaution.

337
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:33,121
Paxton, nobody authorized you
to do that.

338
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:35,657
Get rid of it.

339
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,496
I'll need Paxton's
verification on that.

340
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,273
She's seeing if I'm lying.

341
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:57,278
How can I help you, Lieutenant?

342
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:21,201
I need to ask you a few
questions about Discovery.

343
00:29:21,202 --> 00:29:23,336
What would you like to know first?

344
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:24,537
What's their objective?

345
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:26,339
What are they doing
up you in space?

346
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,843
To collect core samples
from Centrus B-40.

347
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:31,612
Do you have a Michael C. Gotier

348
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:34,615
as a registered employee
of the space program?

349
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:35,616
Negative.

350
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,520
Well, we found him on the ship.

351
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:42,956
That doesn't correlate
with current data.

352
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:45,492
List all current information

353
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,428
on Lieutenant Colonel
William T. Marks.

354
00:29:48,562 --> 00:29:50,097
William T. Marks has no profile

355
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:51,565
in the current space program.

356
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:55,535
You said the same
about Lieutenant Gotier.

357
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:56,804
How could they be up in space

358
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:58,806
and you have not have
a record of it, Lesli?

359
00:29:58,807 --> 00:29:59,907
They were never registered

360
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:01,375
in the current space program.

361
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:12,787
Alex, anything new?

362
00:30:13,755 --> 00:30:15,956
Workin' on it, Giles.

363
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:18,291
I'm with Lesli if you need anything.

364
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:19,927
Mm-hmm.

365
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:23,163
Okay, let's get back to
Discovery 18 for a moment.

366
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:25,232
Who was the last
company that owned her?

367
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:26,299
NASA.

368
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,968
What year was that?

369
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:29,470
1992.

370
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:33,373
Did they sell the
ship to another company?

371
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,908
Negative.

372
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:37,746
The ship was registered lost
after an emergency splashdown.

373
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:40,280
Can you explain?

374
00:30:40,281 --> 00:30:43,316
Discovery initiated an
unscheduled maximum power decent

375
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:45,086
from Centrus B-40.

376
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,922
The crew was forced to
make an emergency landing

377
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:51,726
as a result of multiple
malfunctions during reentry.

378
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:55,628
Okay, where exactly was that splashdown?

379
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:58,932
126 miles from the Florida coast

380
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,234
between Bermuda and Miami.

381
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:06,440
Bermuda Triangle?

382
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:14,848
Goddamn.

383
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:21,990
All right.

384
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,792
Anything wants to
get through that door

385
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:27,295
is gonna have to move
around 5,000 pounds.

386
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,330
Come on.

387
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:33,366
What happened to her crew?

388
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:35,703
Two of the three were recovered.

389
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:43,243
What were the names
of the two recovered?

390
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:44,612
Captain Blake Schadwell,

391
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:52,486
Lieutenant Colonel William T. Marks.

392
00:31:58,526 --> 00:32:01,694
What was the name of the
astronaut not recovered?

393
00:32:01,695 --> 00:32:03,696
Michael C. Gotier.

394
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:13,841
What'd you find out?

395
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:17,411
Well, there's no foreign virus.

396
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:21,414
C count appears normal.

397
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:22,917
There's no plasma obstruction.

398
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,619
For want of a better word,

399
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,589
he checks out normal.

400
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,661
Yeah, except for a huge hole
in the middle of his stomach.

401
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:38,166
This is the weirdest
suicide I've ever seen.

402
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,401
It was not a suicide.

403
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,971
Every sharp instrument leaves

404
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:46,339
some metallic residue.

405
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,308
But the wound is absolutely sterile.

406
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:51,344
And the shape of it
it's a perfect triangle,

407
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,781
and I mean perfect.

408
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:57,218
There's no way it's self inflicted.

409
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:08,997
Alright, can I see a graph
of Centrus B-40, please?

410
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:15,403
Now visualize the Bermuda Triangle.

411
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:20,074
And give me an indicator
light of Discovery splashdown.

412
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:30,450
Now draw a line from Discovery's
location on the moon

413
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:31,820
to their splashdown area.

414
00:33:43,664 --> 00:33:46,000
Where is Spacecore One
in relation to all this?

415
00:33:49,803 --> 00:33:51,138
Jesus.

416
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,111
Shit.

417
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:42,923
Alex!

418
00:34:42,924 --> 00:34:43,924
No!

419
00:34:45,026 --> 00:34:48,862
Somebody help me!

420
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:54,401
No!

421
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:01,041
Somebody help me!

422
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:02,042
Help!

423
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:05,845
Yell as loud as you want.

424
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:07,515
No one can hear you.

425
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:17,058
Who are you?

426
00:35:21,729 --> 00:35:23,131
What do you want?

427
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,235
I have many names.

428
00:35:28,236 --> 00:35:31,172
And I've come to take what is mine.

429
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:58,032
At last, the day of
reckoning is upon you all.

430
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,600
No, no!

431
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,602
No!

432
00:36:02,503 --> 00:36:04,704
No!

433
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:14,782
You belong to me now.

434
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:19,086
Alex!

435
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:23,124
Here's wisdom.

436
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,659
Let him that hath understanding

437
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,997
count the number of my name.

438
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:30,863
Alex!

439
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:37,138
Everyone to medical now!

440
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:52,719
No, well, just wait a minute.

441
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,187
What are you doing let go of me!

442
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:55,155
She's hurt!

443
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:56,556
Nobody is goin' in there.

444
00:36:56,557 --> 00:36:57,557
What is it?

445
00:37:00,194 --> 00:37:01,595
Gotier is not dead.

446
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:04,665
What are you talking about?

447
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,370
He got off the table,
and he came after Alex.

448
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:11,638
Bullshit, man, you're losin' it.

449
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,973
Let me in there.

450
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,309
You do that again and
I'll kick your ass.

451
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,944
I don't care what rank you are.

452
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,812
Look take it easy, Jennings.

453
00:37:19,813 --> 00:37:21,481
I'm just tellin' you what I saw.

454
00:37:21,482 --> 00:37:23,450
Giles, we just can't
keep standing around.

455
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,785
Now what is it that
you propose we do?

456
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:26,854
Just wait a minute.

457
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:30,324
Let me go in there first, okay?

458
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,128
Let him go.

459
00:38:06,194 --> 00:38:07,026
He's flipped.

460
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,328
He's completely flipped.

461
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,830
Calm down.
No, he's nuts.

462
00:38:25,979 --> 00:38:28,315
He looks pretty dead to me, Giles.

463
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:30,451
He had his hands
right around her throat.

464
00:38:33,454 --> 00:38:35,021
How's she doin'?

465
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,190
She's unconscious.

466
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:40,527
Maybe she took a fall?

467
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,794
You know what, you guys
aren't listenin' to me.

468
00:38:41,795 --> 00:38:43,963
She didn't take a goddamn fall!

469
00:38:43,964 --> 00:38:46,534
I saw him pull her face
inside his stomach!

470
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,471
He wouldn't let me out
of the computer room.

471
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:52,772
He was lookin' right at me?

472
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:54,207
Who?

473
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,409
Who was looking at you?

474
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:57,277
Gotier.

475
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,213
We'll let the doc handle this.

476
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,515
Jennings, I need you to give
me a hand with the body.

477
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:04,484
We're gonna take him down to vaporization.

478
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:06,085
Uh-uh, I ain't goin' in there.

479
00:39:06,086 --> 00:39:07,488
That guy's fuckin' crazy.

480
00:39:08,756 --> 00:39:09,923
Get your ass in here.

481
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:13,693
Paxton, I want you to
check the circuit tracers.

482
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:14,695
All right.

483
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:17,544
Hey, come on, come on.

484
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,267
If we don't get those
thrusters up,

485
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:22,869
we're gonna be meeting the
man on the moon in person.

486
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:33,814
Listen, I'm gonna tell
you this as a friend.

487
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:38,886
What you've been saying is
just a little hard to swallow.

488
00:39:40,654 --> 00:39:44,524
We've all suffered a
sustained lack of oxygen,

489
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:46,893
and we've all been
under a bit of pressure.

490
00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:48,995
Gotier went into her.

491
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:50,530
I saw it.

492
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:52,833
Alright, then let me tell
you something as your doctor.

493
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,002
You take a breather.

494
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:57,605
There's nothing you can do here.

495
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:02,209
Now look I'll run some tests.

496
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,411
See what I can find out.

497
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:06,145
Okay?

498
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,550
Okay.

499
00:40:16,056 --> 00:40:17,625
Just promise me one thing.

500
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:20,193
Don't undo the straps.

501
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:23,263
Alright, I promise.

502
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:26,367
Dreyfuss, I know
what I'm talkin' about.

503
00:40:27,368 --> 00:40:28,536
I said I promise.

504
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:41,914
Okay, Lesli.

505
00:40:41,915 --> 00:40:43,484
Let's pick up where we left off.

506
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:47,420
Give me a visual history of all

507
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:49,156
the disappearances in the Triangle.

508
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:52,860
Maybe we'll find a pattern.

509
00:40:55,829 --> 00:41:00,734
The year 1502 the vessel
Gallipo lost, 16 men onboard.

510
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:07,275
The year 1926 the
Japanese tanker Maya lost,

511
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:08,975
100 men onboard.

512
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:10,811
The year 1945.
Okay, I get the point.

513
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:15,315
Lesli, is there any logical explanation

514
00:41:15,316 --> 00:41:18,118
for Discovery's disappearance
into the Bermuda Triangle?

515
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:21,655
No logical explanation exists.

516
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:26,860
Alright, forget about logic.

517
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:29,062
How about speculation?

518
00:41:30,464 --> 00:41:34,166
That an undefined energy
of massive proportion

519
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:38,638
has the ability to seize
as random any object

520
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,073
and transport it without detection

521
00:41:41,074 --> 00:41:42,876
to an unknown destination.

522
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,646
Could this be directed by an alien

523
00:41:46,647 --> 00:41:51,619
possibly from some different
dimension or galaxy?

524
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,321
There has never been any contact

525
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:59,092
with alien life forms in
the space program thus far.

526
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:07,233
Giles, come on down here.

527
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:08,901
Something's happening with Alex.

528
00:42:21,882 --> 00:42:22,849
Oh, god.

529
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,250
Oh, my god.

530
00:42:43,537 --> 00:42:45,071
What is it?

531
00:42:45,072 --> 00:42:46,739
Oh, well a couple of minutes
ago her heart started racing,

532
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,175
so I gave her 200 milligrams
of Verapamil.

533
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:50,477
Here look at this.

534
00:42:50,478 --> 00:42:51,711
This is 280 beats a minute.

535
00:42:51,712 --> 00:42:52,979
I mean her blood pressure is
so high,

536
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,981
she could explode a tire.

537
00:42:54,982 --> 00:42:55,982
What's goin' on?

538
00:42:57,918 --> 00:42:58,918
I don't know look.

539
00:43:01,254 --> 00:43:02,254
No wait.

540
00:43:03,991 --> 00:43:05,158
This is wrong.

541
00:43:06,894 --> 00:43:09,630
Set position indicator.

542
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:13,866
No, no, no, this is wrong.

543
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:16,335
Tracking is true.

544
00:43:16,336 --> 00:43:17,336
She's back.

545
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:23,444
She's back to normal.

546
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,879
Well, what's wrong with that?

547
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:28,180
It's medically impossible.

548
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:29,749
The human anatomy is
not meant to withstand

549
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,284
the heartbeat of a hummingbird.

550
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:33,119
She should be dead.

551
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,561
She's still unconscious.

552
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:48,535
Talk to me what just happened here?

553
00:43:48,536 --> 00:43:53,541
Well, possibly a severe seizure

554
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:56,109
or a very bizarre cardiac arrest,

555
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:00,448
a series of aneurysms.

556
00:44:01,882 --> 00:44:03,883
To tell you the truth
I don't have a clue.

557
00:44:03,884 --> 00:44:05,184
Well, I do.

558
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:07,520
There's somethin' inside of her.

559
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,922
You still think I'll crazy!

560
00:44:10,724 --> 00:44:12,224
Keep the straps on her.

561
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:14,261
Nobody comes in this room
until we find out more.

562
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:18,566
There's somethin' about
Discovery you should know.

563
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:25,271
Bullshit.

564
00:44:25,272 --> 00:44:26,606
Come on that ship splashed down

565
00:44:26,607 --> 00:44:28,440
the Bermuda Triangle..
30 years ago.

566
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:30,009
What's it doin' up in space?

567
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,478
Look, there's no way that ship

568
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:33,245
took a splash into the Atlantic.

569
00:44:33,246 --> 00:44:35,082
It's a typical computer error, Giles.

570
00:44:37,284 --> 00:44:39,185
Look we don't have time to
be dickin' around with this.

571
00:44:39,186 --> 00:44:40,853
We got bigger programs.

572
00:44:40,854 --> 00:44:42,590
Thrusters are still malfunctioning.

573
00:44:43,657 --> 00:44:45,558
Then how do you explain Alex?

574
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:47,059
I don't.

575
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,360
But we're not gonna get any answers

576
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:49,930
unless we get this baby moving.

577
00:44:52,032 --> 00:44:54,433
Okay, it has to be a relay block.

578
00:44:54,434 --> 00:44:56,570
They're not gettin'
the message to fire up.

579
00:44:59,372 --> 00:45:01,373
I have Jennings checking on
'em now.

580
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:03,109
Anyway I have to see
what I can salvage

581
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,276
from this other ship.

582
00:45:04,277 --> 00:45:05,778
If it's our relays that are nonfunctional,

583
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:07,279
maybe we can use theirs.

584
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,315
Wait a minute you're not
goin' back on that ship?

585
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:11,918
Will you cut it out
with this sci-fi bullshit.

586
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:13,653
We need the goddamn relays.

587
00:45:13,654 --> 00:45:14,587
But even if you find them,

588
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:16,422
it might be completely outdated.

589
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:18,424
We don't have much of a choice.

590
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,660
Our orbit is getting
tighter and tighter.

591
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:23,095
We're less than a thousand
miles from the surface.

592
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:26,667
If we don't get this ship
moving, we impact in 13 hours.

593
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:28,901
Alright, then I'm going with you.

594
00:45:28,902 --> 00:45:30,436
No, I need you to stay here

595
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:33,139
to run the compatibilities
once I find them.

596
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,341
It'll save us some time.

597
00:45:56,396 --> 00:45:58,364
Giles, are you reading me?

598
00:45:58,365 --> 00:45:59,532
Yeah, Flynn, go ahead.

599
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:18,619
I'm going into their computer now.

600
00:46:26,526 --> 00:46:27,526
Anything?

601
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:30,163
I'm still checking.

602
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:37,270
Come on where are you guys?

603
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,043
Bingo, I found the geo relay system.

604
00:46:44,645 --> 00:46:47,847
Giles, I'm headed
for the third level.

605
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:48,848
Roger.

606
00:46:51,284 --> 00:46:52,986
Hey, you wanna hear
somethin' for real.

607
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:55,988
I locked into the satellite,

608
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:58,725
a little reprogramming
to change its orbit,

609
00:46:58,726 --> 00:47:00,359
and so telephone home.

610
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,828
Jennings we don't have three days

611
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:03,230
for somebody to get up here.

612
00:47:05,398 --> 00:47:06,700
It's worth a try, Giles.

613
00:47:31,024 --> 00:47:32,025
Flynn, what is it?

614
00:47:35,328 --> 00:47:37,263
What is it, Flynn?

615
00:47:37,264 --> 00:47:40,600
Geez, it's like a goddamn
fish tank in here.

616
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:45,004
Salt water.

617
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,740
Salt water.

618
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,713
Seaweed, shit, everywhere.

619
00:47:59,552 --> 00:48:02,454
What the hell is salt
water doin' on this ship?

620
00:48:02,455 --> 00:48:03,757
Flynn, get out of there!

621
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:06,525
Everything's rusty.

622
00:48:06,526 --> 00:48:08,194
Hey, I see the relays.

623
00:48:08,195 --> 00:48:09,528
Flynn, get out of there now!

624
00:48:09,529 --> 00:48:10,763
What is it?

625
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:13,365
What the hell are you doin' here?

626
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:14,834
Flynn!
Oh, Jesus, let me go!

627
00:48:14,835 --> 00:48:15,835
Flynn!

628
00:48:16,704 --> 00:48:17,837
Son of a bitch.

629
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:18,670
What is it?

630
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:19,671
Come with me.

631
00:48:55,408 --> 00:48:56,543
Something's in there.

632
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,580
No shit.

633
00:49:12,392 --> 00:49:14,560
Giles, no wait!

634
00:49:18,365 --> 00:49:19,365
No.

635
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:23,736
I can't get the hatch opened!

636
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,207
There's gotta be another way inside.

637
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,208
Find it!

638
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,344
What happened?

639
00:50:38,345 --> 00:50:40,579
I felt something.

640
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,449
What did you fire at?

641
00:50:43,516 --> 00:50:45,117
I don't know.

642
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,687
I had this feeling.

643
00:50:48,688 --> 00:50:49,756
I just fired.

644
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:57,730
You were in here first.

645
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:00,833
Where were you all this time?

646
00:51:21,521 --> 00:51:22,521
Dreyfuss.

647
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,892
Now don't get weird on me.

648
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:28,127
Okay?

649
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,164
Let's go find Flynn.

650
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,662
What the hell does this?

651
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:00,853
I knew you'd come.

652
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:03,790
Come closer.

653
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:06,826
I've always wanted you.

654
00:53:10,797 --> 00:53:13,533
You have what I desperately desire.

655
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:22,541
There are things I can give you

656
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:25,178
beyond your wildest dreams.

657
00:53:49,836 --> 00:53:50,836
My god.

658
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:10,056
It's just like Gotier.

659
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:17,329
Alex.

660
00:55:11,484 --> 00:55:12,484
Yes.

661
00:55:20,327 --> 00:55:21,927
Yes.

662
00:55:21,928 --> 00:55:22,928
Oh, yes.

663
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,484
Oh, yeah.

664
00:55:45,485 --> 00:55:46,485
Yeah.

665
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:48,554
Yes.

666
00:56:04,637 --> 00:56:06,873
At last, you have weakened.

667
00:56:10,543 --> 00:56:12,279
Now you belong to me.

668
00:56:22,655 --> 00:56:23,655
Forever.

669
00:56:31,964 --> 00:56:33,400
Get to medical.

670
00:56:48,315 --> 00:56:49,649
So much blood.

671
00:56:50,683 --> 00:56:53,018
Remember he had so much blood.

672
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:54,221
Goddamn you, Jennings!

673
00:57:01,394 --> 00:57:03,194
You let it out didn't you?

674
00:57:03,195 --> 00:57:04,431
You fuckin' let it out!

675
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:07,567
No, I just got here.

676
00:57:08,735 --> 00:57:10,703
I just came down to
see how she was doin'.

677
00:57:12,705 --> 00:57:13,873
The door was opened.

678
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:16,476
I went in and saw her.

679
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:20,679
Triangle.

680
00:57:22,749 --> 00:57:23,749
What is it?

681
00:57:28,788 --> 00:57:30,021
What's goin' on?

682
00:57:30,022 --> 00:57:32,858
You opened the door
and that's all it took.

683
00:57:32,859 --> 00:57:35,894
What in the hell
are you talking about?

684
00:57:35,895 --> 00:57:37,196
Where the hell were you?

685
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:42,001
Are you accusing me of this?

686
00:57:45,272 --> 00:57:48,541
I've had just about
enough of your insanity.

687
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,612
Alright, just hold it, Paxton.

688
00:57:54,146 --> 00:57:55,247
Flynn is dead too.

689
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,452
Oh, my god.

690
00:58:00,453 --> 00:58:01,854
Captain?
Yes.

691
00:58:04,491 --> 00:58:05,491
Where was he?

692
00:58:06,926 --> 00:58:08,528
On the other ship.
Captain.

693
00:58:09,562 --> 00:58:10,562
The other ship?

694
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:19,204
Ooh.

695
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:25,111
Alright, everybody up to the bridge.

696
00:58:26,112 --> 00:58:27,112
Jennings.

697
00:58:28,915 --> 00:58:29,916
It's okay come on.

698
00:58:31,984 --> 00:58:32,984
Now.

699
00:58:52,705 --> 00:58:54,573
Ooh, ooh take it easy.
Now!

700
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:56,775
Whoa, whoa!
Take it easy.

701
00:58:56,776 --> 00:58:57,776
Paxton,

702
00:58:59,446 --> 00:59:00,612
hand it over.

703
00:59:00,613 --> 00:59:01,914
Not on your life.

704
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:04,851
And it very well may come to that.

705
00:59:07,554 --> 00:59:09,955
You know something, Giles,
I've been thinking.

706
00:59:09,956 --> 00:59:13,659
While we were here, working
very hard I might add,

707
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,061
you were on that other ship.

708
00:59:16,529 --> 00:59:18,097
Yeah, where Flynn was killed.

709
00:59:21,534 --> 00:59:23,570
Hey, wait a minute this clip's empty.

710
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:25,804
Figures.

711
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:28,808
What happened on the other ship?

712
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:30,809
I don't know.

713
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,378
I don't, really.

714
00:59:32,379 --> 00:59:35,080
I just felt something so I fired.

715
00:59:35,081 --> 00:59:36,248
What was it?

716
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:38,717
What was it?
Goddamn it, Jennings.

717
00:59:38,718 --> 00:59:39,951
I don't know man.

718
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:41,453
I don't know either
just take it easy.

719
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:42,954
That's right.

720
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:44,991
Because he wasn't
there we got separated.

721
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:48,594
Separated?

722
00:59:48,595 --> 00:59:50,496
Long enough for him to
double back and kill Alex?

723
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:51,497
I don't know.

724
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,036
I didn't kill Alex or anyone else.

725
01:00:02,341 --> 01:00:04,610
Do it, waste the motherfucker.

726
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:06,144
Go ahead kill him!

727
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:09,648
Go ahead he was there with
Flynn when they found Gotier.

728
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:11,750
That's why he wasted Flynn.

729
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:12,684
Go ahead!

730
01:00:12,685 --> 01:00:14,586
Look just because I was there

731
01:00:14,587 --> 01:00:16,255
does not mean that I did it.

732
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:21,260
Precisely, we can't be
sure it was anyway of us.

733
01:00:22,429 --> 01:00:25,797
Any one of us could
be innocent or guilty.

734
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:28,867
Lieutenant Giles,
say hello to your judge,

735
01:00:28,868 --> 01:00:30,102
jury, and executioner.

736
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,839
Jesus, don't shoot him!

737
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,679
Do it, whack the motherfucker.

738
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:44,249
I didn't kill anybody.

739
01:00:51,423 --> 01:00:53,358
If you really think it was me,

740
01:00:58,665 --> 01:00:59,699
then you shoot me.

741
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,800
Go ahead.

742
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:14,547
Well, you might as
well shoot us all.

743
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,400
Okay, Lesli.

744
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:37,604
Let's take another look
at those lost ships.

745
01:01:38,771 --> 01:01:41,207
There must be over 500
vessels listed as lost.

746
01:01:42,274 --> 01:01:45,243
665 to be exact.

747
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:46,879
Lucky us.

748
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:49,782
We would be 666.

749
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:54,686
That is correct.

750
01:02:03,495 --> 01:02:05,030
Leave the triangle and remove

751
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:06,533
all the numerals and graphics.

752
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:09,334
Give me the longitude and latitude

753
01:02:09,335 --> 01:02:10,837
of each point on the triangle.

754
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:18,377
Remove all numerals other
than six.

755
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,128
6-6-6.

756
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:40,366
The Holy Bible book
of Revelations 13:18:

757
01:02:44,604 --> 01:02:45,872
6-6-6

758
01:02:47,907 --> 01:02:49,408
the mark of the beast.

759
01:02:55,214 --> 01:02:56,315
Mark of the beast.

760
01:03:09,596 --> 01:03:12,264
Transition avionics secure
from file.

761
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:24,209
Where have you been?

762
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,210
I was with Lesli.

763
01:03:26,578 --> 01:03:27,980
Well, what'd you find out?

764
01:03:30,049 --> 01:03:31,382
We're on our own.

765
01:03:36,823 --> 01:03:38,324
So what are we gonna do now?

766
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:42,961
We still have a couple of
hours left before we impact.

767
01:03:42,962 --> 01:03:47,198
So, I'm gonna go on
Discovery and get her relays.

768
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,466
Say what?

769
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:50,702
Jennings, we gotta
get the ship moving.

770
01:03:50,703 --> 01:03:54,105
Now while I'm gone I want
you guys to stay together.

771
01:03:54,106 --> 01:03:55,974
I don't want us to leave
one another's sight.

772
01:03:55,975 --> 01:03:57,476
You gotta be kiddin' me now.

773
01:03:59,445 --> 01:04:01,447
Giles, I hate to bring this up.

774
01:04:02,348 --> 01:04:03,649
But with nobody watching you,

775
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:07,252
how can we be sure that
you won't disconnect

776
01:04:07,253 --> 01:04:09,621
and leave us stranded?

777
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:12,524
If I'm not back in 30 minutes,

778
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:17,796
disengage Discovery blow her up.

779
01:04:17,797 --> 01:04:18,764
Wait!

780
01:04:18,765 --> 01:04:20,232
Whoa, we can't do that.

781
01:04:21,267 --> 01:04:22,267
Yes, we can.

782
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:24,402
The satellite.

783
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:28,239
We lock in Discovery's coordinates.

784
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,475
Then after a little drift

785
01:04:30,476 --> 01:04:32,210
she'll get a nice nuclear blast.

786
01:04:32,211 --> 01:04:33,211
No.

787
01:04:34,881 --> 01:04:35,881
I'll show you.

788
01:04:39,986 --> 01:04:41,520
Verify helix angle.

789
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:48,160
Lock Polaris as in.

790
01:05:04,476 --> 01:05:06,545
Recon rotation complete.

791
01:05:09,882 --> 01:05:10,882
She's all ready.

792
01:05:12,919 --> 01:05:14,520
Now we just push this key here.

793
01:05:16,723 --> 01:05:18,290
The ships will disengage.

794
01:05:20,727 --> 01:05:21,727
Goodbye, Discovery.

795
01:05:23,863 --> 01:05:24,931
Give me 30 minutes.

796
01:05:26,398 --> 01:05:29,601
If I'm not back, seal off
the airlock and disengage.

797
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:33,806
Giles, these ships separate,

798
01:05:35,274 --> 01:05:36,942
they'll be no coming back.

799
01:05:36,943 --> 01:05:38,110
Give me a mark at 30.

800
01:05:40,012 --> 01:05:42,548
Three, two, one, mark.

801
01:08:20,072 --> 01:08:24,775
I just got this feeling
that whatever it was got him.

802
01:08:24,776 --> 01:08:26,912
Let's just start the
disengagement process now.

803
01:08:26,913 --> 01:08:28,313
Nobody's gonna do anything!

804
01:08:28,314 --> 01:08:30,950
He said 30 minutes god dammit,
and he's gonna get it.

805
01:09:01,981 --> 01:09:03,514
He has five more minutes!

806
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,751
Two minutes, Paxton, two minutes!

807
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,928
We agreed on 30 minutes time
is up.

808
01:09:51,197 --> 01:09:52,697
We're gonna give
him five minutes more.

809
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:54,632
You're out of your
mind let's do it.

810
01:09:54,633 --> 01:09:56,067
Jennings, Jennings he's right.

811
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:57,536
He gave me an order!

812
01:10:04,843 --> 01:10:06,777
I said five more minutes.

813
01:10:06,778 --> 01:10:07,978
No!

814
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:09,347
Missile lock engaged

815
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:10,981
Armed: All warheads.

816
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,722
It's not gonna get in here,
you understand?

817
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:20,625
You all are gonna thank
you for what I just did.

818
01:10:20,626 --> 01:10:22,060
You son of a bitch.

819
01:10:22,061 --> 01:10:24,995
Target acquisition designated activated.

820
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:48,586
He should be letting that
old dog know any moment now.

821
01:10:49,888 --> 01:10:51,689
You know Paxton you
really surprised me.

822
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:53,224
Back where I come from
that would've been

823
01:10:53,225 --> 01:10:56,061
a legit court martial
dishonorable discharge,

824
01:10:56,062 --> 01:10:58,430
bear press and the paper,
the whole fuckin' deal.

825
01:11:00,532 --> 01:11:02,400
Believe me, gettin' rid
of him and that ship

826
01:11:02,401 --> 01:11:04,035
is the best move we could've made.

827
01:11:17,048 --> 01:11:18,048
Paxton?

828
01:11:20,652 --> 01:11:22,188
What the fuck's wrong with you?

829
01:11:23,555 --> 01:11:27,658
The ship's airlock has been breached.

830
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:45,243
What's happenin'?

831
01:11:45,244 --> 01:11:47,312
What the hell's happenin'?

832
01:11:47,313 --> 01:11:50,348
You don't have the
guts to use that thing.

833
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:52,484
Why don't you put it down?

834
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:55,987
And kneel before me.

835
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,857
Who the hell are you?

836
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:01,091
What do you want from me?

837
01:12:01,092 --> 01:12:02,928
Fate it is in the hands of God.

838
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:07,599
But I control your destiny.

839
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:11,337
I'm losing my fuckin' mind.

840
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:14,105
Oh, yes, to me,

841
01:12:15,474 --> 01:12:17,876
and I will take what is mine.

842
01:12:26,518 --> 01:12:27,919
Open the hatch!

843
01:12:33,525 --> 01:12:34,525
I can't!

844
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:37,996
Open the hatch!

845
01:12:47,138 --> 01:12:48,138
I can't!

846
01:12:49,175 --> 01:12:50,842
Stay the fuck away from me.

847
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:52,910
Put that down.

848
01:12:54,045 --> 01:12:55,713
Paxton, back off.

849
01:12:55,714 --> 01:12:57,448
I swear to God I'll use this!

850
01:12:57,449 --> 01:12:58,817
That's right swear to god.

851
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,386
But he can't help you now.

852
01:13:01,387 --> 01:13:05,123
You belong to me,
you weak spineless bastard.

853
01:13:09,228 --> 01:13:11,028
If you have the courage to
shoot me, go ahead shoot.

854
01:13:11,029 --> 01:13:12,630
Pull the trigger.

855
01:13:12,631 --> 01:13:14,566
You can, you can do it.

856
01:13:16,034 --> 01:13:17,436
Pull the trigger.

857
01:13:24,376 --> 01:13:26,511
No!

858
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:32,583
Yes!

859
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:42,393
Shoot me.

860
01:13:42,394 --> 01:13:44,028
Shoot.

861
01:13:44,029 --> 01:13:44,895
Shoot!

862
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:09,020
I told you I'd use it.

863
01:14:10,456 --> 01:14:12,858
I told you I'd use it you
stupid son of a bitch.

864
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:19,497
Jesus.

865
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:22,601
What have I done?

866
01:14:30,442 --> 01:14:32,844
Synchronize target lock to TARS.

867
01:14:34,746 --> 01:14:35,946
What took you so long?

868
01:14:35,947 --> 01:14:37,482
Confidence is high.

869
01:14:37,483 --> 01:14:38,483
I don't know.

870
01:14:40,886 --> 01:14:42,019
Somethin' was trying to keep me

871
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,554
from gettin' back on the ship.

872
01:14:43,555 --> 01:14:48,059
Eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.

873
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:52,931
Zoom.

874
01:14:59,505 --> 01:15:02,240
Secondary target has been neutralized.

875
01:15:07,346 --> 01:15:08,547
Thanks, I owe you one.

876
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:15,787
Jennings, Paxton?

877
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:19,825
Jennings, Paxton?

878
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:25,563
Shit.

879
01:15:41,112 --> 01:15:42,112
Poor bastard.

880
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:47,318
Alright, listen to me.

881
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:49,319
It was in Paxton.

882
01:15:50,889 --> 01:15:51,957
Now it's in Jennings.

883
01:15:53,324 --> 01:15:55,026
And we got one hour left.

884
01:15:56,562 --> 01:15:58,663
Let's put these relays in,

885
01:15:58,664 --> 01:16:00,399
and try to get home, alright?

886
01:16:02,434 --> 01:16:03,434
Damn.

887
01:16:50,716 --> 01:16:52,984
Get away from me, you motherfucker.

888
01:17:33,124 --> 01:17:34,124
What is it?

889
01:17:35,994 --> 01:17:37,929
It's what's left of the relay system.

890
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:56,882
(Foreign language)

891
01:17:58,684 --> 01:17:59,718
Save the prayers, huh?

892
01:18:03,354 --> 01:18:04,455
What's your problem?

893
01:18:06,324 --> 01:18:08,659
Prayers don't mean jack shit.

894
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,860
They do for me!

895
01:18:10,762 --> 01:18:12,030
Whoa!
Get down!

896
01:18:17,268 --> 01:18:20,671
Alright, now there's only two choices.

897
01:18:20,672 --> 01:18:22,708
Either he gets us, or we get him.

898
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:26,712
Don't be afraid to use this.

899
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:32,651
Alright, let's go.

900
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:37,148
Oh, my god.

901
01:20:14,419 --> 01:20:17,021
Discovery blew up you should
be dead.

902
01:20:19,324 --> 01:20:20,324
Just do it, man.

903
01:20:21,492 --> 01:20:22,493
Just fuckin' do it.

904
01:20:30,769 --> 01:20:31,937
Shit.

905
01:21:02,467 --> 01:21:03,467
My god.

906
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:06,170
You okay?

907
01:21:08,373 --> 01:21:11,509
He was gonna kill you.

908
01:21:14,012 --> 01:21:15,012
Thanks.

909
01:21:36,634 --> 01:21:38,136
What's going on?

910
01:21:39,137 --> 01:21:40,137
It stopped.

911
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:44,609
Lesli, give me a status update.

912
01:21:46,577 --> 01:21:47,577
Lesli?

913
01:21:49,981 --> 01:21:50,981
Lesli?

914
01:21:54,352 --> 01:21:55,754
Lesli, it's Giles.

915
01:21:56,955 --> 01:21:59,357
Yes, Giles, how may I help you.

916
01:22:00,826 --> 01:22:02,460
Give me a status update.

917
01:22:03,895 --> 01:22:06,397
The ship has come
to a complete stand still.

918
01:22:08,867 --> 01:22:09,867
Explain.

919
01:22:10,769 --> 01:22:12,637
Reason unknown.

920
01:22:15,206 --> 01:22:17,608
At least it gives us more time,
huh, Giles?

921
01:23:16,902 --> 01:23:18,236
Something wrong?

922
01:23:19,204 --> 01:23:21,038
No, I was just thinking.

923
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:22,140
About what?

924
01:23:23,574 --> 01:23:26,211
Well, I think, there's a way
that we can still get home.

925
01:23:28,213 --> 01:23:29,213
Really?

926
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:34,384
How's that?

927
01:23:35,286 --> 01:23:37,154
Jennings figured out a way to

928
01:23:37,155 --> 01:23:38,756
reprogram into the satellite,

929
01:23:40,725 --> 01:23:42,160
send a message to Houston.

930
01:23:55,907 --> 01:23:57,175
It's worth a shot, right?

931
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:00,710
True.

932
01:24:11,322 --> 01:24:13,724
Lock Polaris as in.

933
01:24:17,929 --> 01:24:19,931
Recon rotation complete.

934
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:36,214
You don't believe in God,
do you Giles?

935
01:24:41,419 --> 01:24:42,419
That's strange.

936
01:24:44,455 --> 01:24:45,456
You believe in me.

937
01:24:48,994 --> 01:24:49,995
I should've known.

938
01:24:59,137 --> 01:25:00,471
Why the Bermuda Triangle?

939
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:03,808
Let's just call it convenient.

940
01:25:07,312 --> 01:25:09,780
Heaven is a universe but so
is hell.

941
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:13,350
When God cast me from the heavens,

942
01:25:13,351 --> 01:25:17,722
I vowed one day I would
become more powerful than he.

943
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:22,693
Every soul I take
strengthens me 100 fold.

944
01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:25,796
Every life I destroy

945
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:28,833
lays claim to one more piece
of heaven

946
01:25:30,301 --> 01:25:34,638
till heaven is nothing more
than a crucible filled with dust

947
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:38,443
which I will break in
witness of your creator.

948
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:47,618
You don't think I believe
that shit, do you?

949
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,698
What good is wisdom if it
gives no power to the wise?

950
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,403
The moment you questioned
your faith your soul was mine.

951
01:26:12,777 --> 01:26:15,579
You will kneel before me!

952
01:26:21,486 --> 01:26:22,887
You had a choice.

953
01:26:24,422 --> 01:26:26,191
You all had a choice.

954
01:26:30,961 --> 01:26:33,163
No, I still have a choice.

955
01:26:33,164 --> 01:26:34,664
Missile lock engaged.

956
01:26:34,665 --> 01:26:36,533
Armed: All warheads.

957
01:26:36,534 --> 01:26:38,236
Maybe I can't destroy you.

958
01:26:39,437 --> 01:26:40,671
But if it's God's will,

959
01:26:43,008 --> 01:26:44,374
then so be it.

960
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:46,044
Confidence is high.

961
01:26:47,412 --> 01:26:48,378
Time.

962
01:26:48,379 --> 01:26:49,946
And if not,

963
01:26:49,947 --> 01:26:51,848
then I'll see you in hell.

964
01:26:51,849 --> 01:26:52,849
Six,

965
01:26:54,252 --> 01:26:57,222
four, three, two, one, zoom.

966
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:06,890
Mayday, Mayday.

967
01:28:07,925 --> 01:28:09,593
This is Captain Louis Ramser,

968
01:28:09,594 --> 01:28:11,028
of the spaceship Tiberius.

969
01:28:11,929 --> 01:28:12,929
Mayday, Mayday.

970
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:15,865
We have lost all power.

971
01:28:15,866 --> 01:28:17,368
I'm transmitting on auxiliary.

972
01:28:18,269 --> 01:28:20,270
Mayday, Mayday.

973
01:28:20,271 --> 01:28:23,307
We are drifting towards
Centrus B-40.

974
01:28:23,308 --> 01:28:24,575
Mayday, Mayday.
