God damned chats.

15
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:54,859
Damn it Walker,
I was enjoying the tune.

16
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:58,428
-Ah, he sings like a wee girl.
-Sorry.

17
00:02:58,463 --> 00:02:59,697
Lay off the kid.

18
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:02,199
At least he's not covered
in nits.

19
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:05,235
Tribulation is communal in war,
Gray.

20
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,303
You should know that.

21
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:08,539
Ah, you bloody scobberlotcher.

22
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,576
Lewis, hand me your nose rag.

23
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:17,548
Gray, would you mind
taking watch tonight?

24
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:19,550
Ah sorry, chap. Terribly busy.

25
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:21,853
-Doing what?
-Not having watch.

26
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:28,660
Here.

27
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:33,598
Oh, just a little bit
will take the edge off, huh?

28
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:38,636
Just trying to help.

29
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,242
Fuck.

30
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,443
It gets easier.

31
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:47,812
Fuck off.

32
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:48,746
Men.

33
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,584
If I see
you've left your post to groom

34
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:56,420
that damn mustache again,
I'll shave it myself.

35
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:57,488
Wouldn't be the first time

36
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:59,457
my looks fetched me
a reprimand.

37
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,460
Isn't one of you on watch?

38
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,561
Just finished, sir.

39
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:08,331
Can't imagine the view

40
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:10,300
from down here
does us any good.

41
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,303
-Off you go.
-Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,915
Lieutenant Turner.

43
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:25,449
At ease, Captain Hall.

44
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,920
What business do you have here?

45
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:30,788
I brought you a new medic.

46
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:33,256
Compliments
of Major General Allen.

47
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,959
- Lieutenant.
- Welcome, Private.

48
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,694
Segura. sir.

49
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:38,261
Try and take care of this one,
will you?

50
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:39,597
We're running low on spare.

51
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,798
Well thank you, Captain.

52
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,434
I'll have one of my men
show you off.

53
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:47,839
Actually, the Major General
would very much appreciate

54
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,575
a briefing on your situation
over here.

55
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,777
- The Major General?
- Sir.

56
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,612
Of course.

57
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:57,548
If you'd follow me Captain,
I'll bring you up to speed.

58
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:01,351
Stay put.

59
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,955
Play nice.

60
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:12,497
Oi, boy scout. Come here.

61
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,671
-How old are you?
-Eighteen.

62
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,640
Christ, we are fucked.

63
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,511
They're down
to sending us Buster Brown.

64
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,514
Aye, don't he look
like Buster Brown?

65
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,951
You want a drink?

66
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:36,654
Oh...

67
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:38,956
Oh, what's the matter,
need to ask your mum?

68
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:47,632
Now.

69
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:56,574
Ah, it's all right, mate.

70
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,909
I've been told it gets easier.

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,850
Oye, Gloomy Gus,
you want a drink?

72
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:12,890
Oy, what's with him?
He know English?

73
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:15,726
I don't drink.
Dulls the intellect.

74
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:19,797
Eh, quite high and mighty
for a greaser.

75
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:21,933
Don't mind him,
he keeps to himself.

76
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,938
Don't wet yourself just yet,
mate.

77
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:29,841
Shells are more common
than rain these days.

78
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:32,944
It's nothing to fret about,
till they're...

79
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:35,947
...right above you.

80
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:38,883
Right.

81
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:52,496
But I'll tell you what ought
to give you a fright...

82
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,970
the ghouls of no man's land.

83
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:00,805
The what?

84
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:05,408
Countless trenches and tunnels
been abandoned around here.

85
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:08,079
Perfect homes
for gutless deserters

86
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:10,615
and poor bastards left
for dead.

87
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:15,920
Livin' in the dark,
becomin' less human by the day.

88
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,624
They dig deep and far
in the dirt,

89
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,094
like ants in the earth.

90
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:28,833
Why, they could be
under your very feet right now.

91
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,739
And they've lived there
for years,

92
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,709
only coming out on nights
like this

93
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:40,978
to scavenge among
the rotten remains

94
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,412
of no man's land.

95
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,684
If you listen close...

96
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,789
you can hear
their wretched cries

97
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:54,825
as they feast
on the flesh of the dead.

98
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:56,694
Tearing through
maggot-filled meat

99
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,562
like rabid dogs.

100
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,774
Bit of advice.

101
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:15,112
Sleep with one eye open.

102
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:20,584
They're not afraid
to spread into the trenches,

103
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:24,088
looking to fill their bellies
with the tastiest meat of all...

104
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,925
boys fresh off the boat.

105
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:33,731
Hey.

106
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,145
Our stalemate has lasted
some time now.

107
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,816
Both of our numbers
and resources

108
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:54,852
are strained to say the least.

109
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,787
At this point,
we're just waiting

110
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:57,989
for the other to starve.

111
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:01,892
From the looks of it
that might not be that more.

112
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:06,063
I would just say
the morale vanish.

113
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:09,033
Is that your inquiry,
or of the Major General's?

114
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:12,670
Lieutenant, you have nothing
to worry about.

115
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,605
We just wanted
to make sure that

116
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,241
the lines before the fire
where they may have been weak.

117
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:20,711
Thank you for your generosity,
Captain.

118
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,247
Give my best
to the Major General.

119
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,785
- Lieutenant?
- Yes?

120
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:31,055
I believe the Germans
have retreated, sir.

121
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:32,690
What?

122
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:33,891
They've appeared
to have abandoned

123
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,027
their outpost, sir.

124
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,028
It's empty.

125
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:12,296
By what we can see from here

126
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:14,765
it appears the krauts
have fallen back.

127
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,804
Fortune is smiling upon us
with a bout of fog,

128
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,338
providing us an opportunity

129
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:24,975
to cross no man's land
under cover.

130
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:28,012
This is a window of opportunity
we must seize now.

131
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,781
You really think
that they haven't fallen back?

132
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,183
I say we hit 'em.

133
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,784
We hit 'em
with more artillery,

134
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:35,052
just to be sure.

135
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:37,788
If the outpost truly
is unoccupied

136
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:39,323
it would be in our best interest

137
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:41,892
not to blow it all to hell
before we claim it.

138
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:46,197
Imagine that,
an entire outpost

139
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,700
taken single-handedly
with no casualties.

140
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:53,070
I reckon we'd all be
recompensed handsomely.

141
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,874
Thank you for your visit,
Captain.

142
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,776
My men will take it from here.

143
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,111
But you ain't shaking
this off now.

144
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:04,348
Major General would love
to hear about this.

145
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:12,723
On me.

146
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,875
I will lead the path across
with Private Gray.

147
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:35,846
Once we provide the signal,
Hall and Lewis will follow.

148
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:37,915
After their passage,

149
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,284
Baker and Segura
will guide Walker

150
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,186
as he lays down
the communication wire.

151
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,789
Are we clear?

152
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:46,790
-Sir.
-Yes, sir.

153
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:33,270
Saddle up.

154
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,022
Hold still. Hold still.

155
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,368
Just stay right behind me.

156
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,536
We'll be on the other side
in no time.

157
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:00,317
Come on!

158
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:19,169
Quiet him
or else he'll get us killed!

159
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,907
Kill him! Kill him!

160
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:39,390
Silence him.

161
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:52,504
Move.

162
00:16:08,586 --> 00:16:11,054
What the bloody hell
was all that noise?

163
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:13,056
Were you trying
to give away our position?

164
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,324
No, sir.

165
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:16,994
Fortunately for you it seems
there's no one here

166
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:19,229
to have heard
all your bloody racket.

167
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:22,299
Otherwise, that'd be you
howling out there.

168
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:32,209
Men, let's go.

169
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,166
It's a ghost town.

170
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,777
-Lieutenant?
-This can't be right.

171
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,745
Where is their damn dugout?

172
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:09,781
Lieutenant?

173
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,106
They sealed it up
from the outside.

174
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,174
Why would they do that?

175
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:40,778
Open it up.

176
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:34,398
Don't go!

177
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,254
My God!

178
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:27,845
What in God's...

179
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:37,955
-Get him down.
-Sir?

180
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,757
Seeing as how he's all
that's left

181
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,759
I'd say he's our best bet
to knowing

182
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:43,795
what in the hell happened here?

183
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,429
We're not gonna get anything
out of him.

184
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:46,296
Look at him.

185
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,699
Perhaps not.

186
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:50,768
But we very well
can't leave him like this.

187
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:51,769
Can't we?

188
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:53,671
Gonna have to agree, sir.

189
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:55,673
Something doesn't feel right.

190
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:56,841
He's dying.

191
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:58,375
Tends to his wounds

192
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:00,745
and see that he's sound enough
for questioning.

193
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,988
What happened down here?

194
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:46,891
That's what I intend
to find out.

195
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:56,801
We should be leaving.

196
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:57,635
How is he?

197
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,905
He's barely breathing, sir.

198
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:02,473
Get him topside.

199
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:04,809
Fresh air will do him
some good.

200
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:07,044
Spending another minute
in this kraut filth

201
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:08,479
won't help anyone.

202
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:26,631
Once we're above,
signal our outpost

203
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:28,633
that they're safe to move here.

204
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,068
I want to begin occupying
the area immediate...

205
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,548
Incoming!
Captain Hall, take...

206
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:52,857
Dig! Dig!

207
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:56,359
Help!

208
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:09,640
Gas! Get back!

209
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:10,608
Take him!

210
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:12,777
Come on!

211
00:23:13,945 --> 00:23:15,580
Lewis, come on!

212
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,486
It's here.

213
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,834
- Come on!
- Lewis! We have to go!

214
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:37,935
Lewis!

215
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:41,739
Lewis!

216
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:43,875
Help!

217
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:57,722
Help me with this!

218
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:02,760
Help! Lewis!

219
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:06,396
Don't leave me!

220
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:09,399
Medic!

221
00:25:03,054 --> 00:25:05,823
Lewis, we've to go.

222
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,025
You, Baker, come with me.

223
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:18,129
Lewis.

224
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,665
Take over Walker's duties
on the radio

225
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:23,534
and contact our outpost.

226
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,804
-Baker?
-Yes, sir.

227
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:27,972
You will assist.

228
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,975
Once Walker is mended,

229
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:33,878
have the other yank see to it
that the chemicals are covered.

230
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:36,981
Put the Kraut
to work as well.

231
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:38,916
That ought to lift his spirits.

232
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:44,021
You are dismissed.

233
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:56,360
Baker?

234
00:27:57,862 --> 00:27:59,096
Yeah.

235
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,164
Lewis.

236
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:05,769
You alright?

237
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:06,804
Fine, I guess.

238
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:08,906
Where are you from?

239
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:12,076
America, er, New York.

240
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,944
Lovely. Lovely.

241
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:17,748
I'm from Newcastle, England.

242
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:18,782
Okay.

243
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:23,287
Say, would you mind
if I offered a word of prayer?

244
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,190
I think it will help settle
our nerves.

245
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:28,759
Okay.

246
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,060
Yeah, right. Thanks.

247
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:38,169
Dear Lord,
we thank thee for safely

248
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:41,071
guiding us from harm's way
and for Your bountiful mercy.

249
00:28:43,874 --> 00:28:47,745
Please watch over Private Gray,
and our other fallen brethren,

250
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:49,213
as they find their way back
to Your loving embrace...

251
00:28:52,783 --> 00:28:54,351
Walker has our frequency
in his jacket.

252
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:03,394
This is a--
this is Private Lewis

253
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:04,728
of the 11th Battalion.

254
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:05,930
Any units on this channel?

255
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,039
Finish up here
and begin preparations

256
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:17,441
to dig through to the trenches.

257
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:20,411
-What of our outpost, sir?
-What of it?

258
00:29:20,444 --> 00:29:22,213
They can at least send us help.

259
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:23,781
I cannot call for aid

260
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:27,051
without sacrificing
our defenses.

261
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:30,120
Our only means
of escape is to dig.

262
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,293
You, come with me.

263
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,578
Let's have a gander at you.

264
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,201
You don't have any papers.

265
00:30:57,475 --> 00:31:00,911
Do not take me for a fool.
I know you understand me.

266
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:06,183
Are you a deserter?

267
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:10,254
Is that why you were left
for the dead?

268
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,459
Why we found you hanging
by a wire

269
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:15,527
and a nail?

270
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:21,298
The way I see it,
you owe a great debt to us.

271
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:25,570
I would think it wise
to cooperate.

272
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:31,275
One who abandons his post
is worth no more

273
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:33,177
than the shit on my boot.

274
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:38,215
I expect more of a man,
even my enemy.

275
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:40,050
It may mean nothing to you,

276
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:43,854
but honor means a great deal
to me.

277
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:47,291
We may be down here
for some time,

278
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,395
maybe you'll learn something
about it.

279
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,031
Sir...

280
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,034
I think you should see this.

281
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:03,407
They ordered a strike
on their own outpost...?

282
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,945
Surely, they couldn't have known
we'd be here,

283
00:32:07,978 --> 00:32:10,047
they sealed the bloody place up!

284
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:15,919
In all my years...

285
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,058
this is madness.

286
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:34,304
This is Private Lewis
of the 11th Battalion. Come in.

287
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:49,654
You know the thing
about chats is...

288
00:32:53,157 --> 00:32:54,659
...it's the eggs that do you in.

289
00:32:57,227 --> 00:33:02,433
They lay their fucking eggs
in your seams.

290
00:33:09,273 --> 00:33:10,708
You think they're gone,

291
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:14,479
but then it starts
all over again.

292
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,524
And they spread
without any goddamn remorse.

293
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:50,113
Hello?

294
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,016
Hello? Over.

295
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:55,319
<i>We hear you, Lewis.</i>

296
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:56,588
Oh, thank heavens.

297
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:58,255
We've been trapped
in a German dugout.

298
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:00,290
We need immediate assistance.

299
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:03,761
Hello?

300
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:07,532
<i>What's your exact location?</i>

301
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:09,132
Ah. Ah.

302
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:15,272
Hey. Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

303
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:18,743
Help!

304
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:22,112
Help him!

305
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:27,351
Aid kit. Go!

306
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:31,288
- What happened to him?
- I have no idea, sir.

307
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:32,624
He just started
cutting himself.

308
00:34:32,657 --> 00:34:36,093
Walker? Walker?

309
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:38,161
-He's not responsive, sir.
-I can see that.

310
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,300
Christ. He did this to himself?

311
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:08,218
Baker? You okay?

312
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:24,636
What is this?

313
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:27,371
It's a mass grave.

314
00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:30,407
Easier to pile the dead
into one hole

315
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,543
than to dig
God knows how many.

316
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:36,413
It takes some getting used to.

317
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:41,853
Are you... used to it.

318
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:45,757
My job is to keep people alive.

319
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:48,593
I try to focus on that.

320
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:52,930
What's on your mind?

321
00:36:54,866 --> 00:36:56,199
I was just...

322
00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:59,169
thinking about earlier.

323
00:37:00,538 --> 00:37:01,438
The man I killed.

324
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:04,341
Look kid,

325
00:37:04,374 --> 00:37:06,376
I know you're right
off the boat,

326
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,779
but this is war.

327
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:12,349
You'll have time
to wax poetic about this

328
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:14,485
if you make it back home,

329
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:17,922
but compassion is lost
in a conflict.

330
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:21,659
It's you or them.

331
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,327
You're full of shit.

332
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,465
Is that right?

333
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:29,467
And what the hell
do you even know about it?

334
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,268
Care to enlighten me?

335
00:37:32,436 --> 00:37:33,403
I just...

336
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:38,910
it just shouldn't be
so thoughtless.

337
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:41,344
What? Did you think
this was gonna be

338
00:37:41,378 --> 00:37:42,312
like summer camp?

339
00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:44,882
You could just whistle
your way back home

340
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,216
to a medal and a parade?

341
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,587
This is survival.

342
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,888
You may be able
to twiddle your thumbs

343
00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:52,990
and pass as a hero,

344
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,625
but I'll be lucky
to get a headstone out of this.

345
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:01,331
I shouldn't be hard on you.

346
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:03,868
We've all been there.

347
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:10,842
Besides, being stuck down here
with a bunch of Tommies,

348
00:38:14,512 --> 00:38:15,913
I could use a Gringo
on my side.

349
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:40,071
This is Private Lewis.

350
00:38:40,104 --> 00:38:41,038
Come in.

351
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,811
Hello? Come in?

352
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:51,616
I spoke to someone
on this channel.

353
00:38:51,649 --> 00:38:53,785
-Private Lewis.
-Sir.

354
00:38:53,818 --> 00:38:55,520
I thought you could use
some relieving.

355
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:58,055
Thank you, sir,
but I'll manage.

356
00:38:58,089 --> 00:38:59,524
I insist.

357
00:39:08,966 --> 00:39:10,300
How are you faring?

358
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:16,507
Hold fast, Lewis.

359
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:20,343
I need strong
and honorable men by my side.

360
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:21,746
If it were just me
and the Yanks

361
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:23,413
I'd bloody well lose it.

362
00:39:24,482 --> 00:39:25,448
Sir, I...

363
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:27,885
Yes?

364
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,322
I'm sorry
I couldn't save Private Gray.

365
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:36,861
Surely, you'd rather have him
here in my stead.

366
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't... I don't belong here.

367
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:44,936
None of us belongs here.

368
00:39:46,537 --> 00:39:50,373
But we are nonetheless called
during an hour of need.

369
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:51,576
And in this hour,

370
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:53,878
I need you to see us
out of here.

371
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:56,747
Can I count on your courage?

372
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:01,351
Good man.

373
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:04,622
Take your rest.

374
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:39,777
Walker.

375
00:42:41,145 --> 00:42:43,681
Walker, in God's name
please stop!

376
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:47,918
Walker!

377
00:43:15,246 --> 00:43:16,947
What's happening?

378
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:26,557
Hey, Walker. Walker.

379
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:39,336
Walker!

380
00:43:44,108 --> 00:43:46,777
I'm just walking past.
Jesus Christ defend us.

381
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:54,852
What's happening?

382
00:45:29,413 --> 00:45:31,715
<i>Private Lewis, come in?</i>

383
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:33,350
<i>Repeat, come in Private Lewis.</i>

384
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:41,292
This is Private Segura
of the US 90th Infantry.

385
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:42,259
<i>Hello, Private Segura.</i>

386
00:45:43,461 --> 00:45:45,095
I trust Private Lewis
has briefed you

387
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:46,030
on our situation.

388
00:45:47,364 --> 00:45:50,267
<i>Yes, but we seemed</i>
<i>to have been cut short.</i>

389
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:51,936
What are your coordinates?

390
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:53,771
Yes.

391
00:45:53,804 --> 00:45:57,441
Our coordinates
are 50.1972, 3.2198.

392
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:00,144
It's a German bunker,

393
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:01,812
just west of the woods
at Bourlon Ridge.

394
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:04,381
<i>Confirming your location.</i>

395
00:46:06,518 --> 00:46:10,187
We are situated--
across the river

396
00:46:11,523 --> 00:46:13,857
and... ...west.

397
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:14,825
Repeat?

398
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:18,496
<i>It looks like the area</i>
<i>is clear.</i>

399
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:19,797
We're safe to move.

400
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:24,201
<i>We'll get you out of there,</i>
<i>just sit tight.</i>

401
00:46:24,235 --> 00:46:25,503
Okay, okay.

402
00:46:25,537 --> 00:46:26,870
How long until you arrive?

403
00:46:28,405 --> 00:46:29,340
Hello?

404
00:46:31,175 --> 00:46:32,843
<i>How many men are trapped</i>
<i>with you?</i>

405
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:36,847
Now... now,
there are four of us.

406
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:39,783
And we have a prisoner.

407
00:46:39,817 --> 00:46:41,018
<i>Prisoner?</i>

408
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,753
Yes, a German.

409
00:46:44,989 --> 00:46:46,056
<i>What's his condition?</i>

410
00:46:46,991 --> 00:46:47,925
Stable.

411
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:49,927
<i>Good.</i>

412
00:46:51,128 --> 00:46:52,497
<i>See to it that it stays</i>
<i>that way.</i>

413
00:46:53,598 --> 00:46:55,567
<i>He's a priority.</i>

414
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,900
Why is that?

415
00:46:58,369 --> 00:46:59,870
<i>I would consider your rank</i>

416
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:01,338
<i>before questioning authority,</i>
<i>Private.</i>

417
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:03,874
Roger that.

418
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,960
-How are you doing, sir?
-Splendid.

419
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:25,896
I'm sorry about Walker.

420
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:29,266
He was a good man.

421
00:47:32,537 --> 00:47:33,904
Shame what happened to him.

422
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:39,043
-What did happen?
-Clear enough.

423
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:41,845
Walker suffered
from severe shell shock.

424
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:42,813
Sir, that wasn't--

425
00:47:42,846 --> 00:47:45,583
Do you have a better
explanation, Private?

426
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:48,620
All we can do now
is keep our wits about.

427
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:51,589
We will not succumb
to hysteria on my watch.

428
00:47:54,391 --> 00:47:56,293
Lieutenant?

429
00:47:56,327 --> 00:47:57,828
I spoke to a unit
on the radio.

430
00:47:57,861 --> 00:48:01,231
-They're on their way to--
-I instructed Lewis
to oversee communications!

431
00:48:01,265 --> 00:48:04,401
-Yes sir,
but he wasn't at his post.
-I'll not have you meddling
with our transmission.

432
00:48:04,435 --> 00:48:06,638
You are not to engage
in any dealings

433
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:10,040
of communication unless
under my direct supervision.

434
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:11,609
With all due respect sir,
I think that I--

435
00:48:11,643 --> 00:48:14,878
I don't give a tinker's damn
what you think.

436
00:48:14,912 --> 00:48:16,413
You're not here to think.

437
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:19,216
You're here to follow my orders.

438
00:48:19,249 --> 00:48:20,417
Is that understood?

439
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:23,187
-Yes, sir.
-Right!

440
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:33,997
Lieutenant?

441
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:46,511
I don't feel quite myself.

442
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:50,548
Could you relieve me?

443
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:54,451
Better yet,
bring that coward Kraut here.

444
00:48:54,486 --> 00:48:56,320
Have him do it.

445
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:59,189
I can trust you with him,
can I not?

446
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:02,226
Of course, sir.

447
00:49:02,259 --> 00:49:04,094
I'm putting my faith in you,
Private.

448
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:07,965
Prove your mettle.

449
00:49:39,363 --> 00:49:40,931
That is quite the journal.

450
00:49:49,273 --> 00:49:51,442
It is important
to document our thoughts.

451
00:49:53,043 --> 00:49:55,212
Our words will outlive us
by a great deal.

452
00:49:57,381 --> 00:49:59,149
That's the idea.

453
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:00,518
And who is this record for?

454
00:50:04,021 --> 00:50:06,156
Or is it to be found
with your corpse?

455
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,492
I don't intend
on dying down here.

456
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:11,094
This is for la raza.

457
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,364
A record of honor
and sacrifice

458
00:50:14,398 --> 00:50:15,700
for our people to claim.

459
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,303
And what is your charge
among your people?

460
00:50:19,336 --> 00:50:20,304
I taught medicine.

461
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:24,208
I would assume educators
would remain

462
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:25,743
in the homeland
instead of fighting.

463
00:50:27,077 --> 00:50:28,746
I felt compelled to do my part.

464
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,715
For a country that would
not do the same for you?

465
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:42,392
May I?

466
00:50:57,074 --> 00:50:59,109
-What is your name?
-Kurt.

467
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,411
Well, Kurt,

468
00:51:02,647 --> 00:51:04,482
did your spirit not burn
with patriotic passion

469
00:51:04,516 --> 00:51:05,583
to enlist in the struggle?

470
00:51:07,084 --> 00:51:10,053
I did not enlist,
I was drafted.

471
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:15,560
An orphanage is a rich source
for potential soldiers.

472
00:51:15,593 --> 00:51:17,294
You were an orphan?

473
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:18,362
I was.

474
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,667
My upbringing was difficult
to say the least.

475
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,705
I also spent time
in an orphanage.

476
00:51:29,474 --> 00:51:30,642
And were you chosen?

477
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:37,749
I stopped waiting to be chosen.

478
00:51:37,782 --> 00:51:39,416
I chose to focus
on my community.

479
00:51:44,254 --> 00:51:46,758
-Smoke?
-No, sorry.

480
00:51:49,293 --> 00:51:51,094
I suppose the air
is sour enough.

481
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:59,771
Kurt, you saw what came out
of Walker.

482
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:03,741
That wasn't warfare.

483
00:52:03,775 --> 00:52:05,577
That wasn't human.

484
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:10,347
There is something sick
happening in here.

485
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,381
Something corrupt.

486
00:52:13,751 --> 00:52:15,085
This happened before,
didn't it.

487
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,722
With the men that nailed you
to that cross.

488
00:52:21,926 --> 00:52:24,696
Do you have any experience
herding sheep, Private?

489
00:52:27,431 --> 00:52:30,501
Sheep have a habit of putting
themselves in harm's way.

490
00:52:32,604 --> 00:52:34,739
They are unable to care
for themselves

491
00:52:34,772 --> 00:52:36,908
without a shepherd.

492
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:38,543
Men are very similar.

493
00:52:40,778 --> 00:52:42,446
You believe we're doing this
to ourselves?

494
00:52:43,648 --> 00:52:46,316
In a way, you are.

495
00:52:49,186 --> 00:52:51,589
Maybe we should keep an eye out
for the wolf in the herd.

496
00:52:53,725 --> 00:52:54,626
Perhaps.

497
00:52:56,326 --> 00:52:59,196
But the wolf in sheepskin

498
00:52:59,229 --> 00:53:02,600
pales before the devil
in shepherd's robe.

499
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:07,639
And what would a devil shepherd
want from the herd?

500
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:11,208
Dominion.

501
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:16,481
Thirty.

502
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,388
Uh, 15.

503
00:53:29,927 --> 00:53:30,795
How's your leg?

504
00:53:32,463 --> 00:53:34,465
It hurts. Thanks for asking.

505
00:53:36,366 --> 00:53:38,503
-How's your head?
-Not bad.

506
00:53:40,505 --> 00:53:41,539
All things considered...

507
00:53:44,008 --> 00:53:46,443
You know, some time ago,

508
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:47,645
we were passing through
a village.

509
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,881
For 15 miles,

510
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:54,284
and all the way we kept passing
supply wagons.

511
00:53:56,487 --> 00:53:57,555
At each one I thought,

512
00:53:59,657 --> 00:54:01,258
I could throw myself
in front of it

513
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:06,430
Get out of the war,
but I couldn't.

514
00:54:10,702 --> 00:54:12,302
Now, I might have an excuse
to go home.

515
00:54:16,641 --> 00:54:17,909
God knows I'm of no help here.

516
00:54:21,311 --> 00:54:22,412
Can't say I don't understand.

517
00:54:30,455 --> 00:54:31,856
I keep going over it
in my head.

518
00:54:34,592 --> 00:54:36,359
I'd like to think
I knew Walker rather well,

519
00:54:36,393 --> 00:54:39,997
but I didn't know
he was capable of such behavior.

520
00:54:45,636 --> 00:54:46,604
And that thing.

521
00:54:49,406 --> 00:54:50,541
That horrible omen.

522
00:54:53,376 --> 00:54:54,779
-Omen?
-What do you think it was?

523
00:54:57,582 --> 00:54:59,517
-I don't even know what I saw.
-You mustn't deny it.

524
00:55:01,753 --> 00:55:03,888
"The Spirit speaketh expressly,
that in the latter times

525
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:05,022
some shall depart
from the faith,

526
00:55:06,724 --> 00:55:09,994
giving heed to seducing
spirits,
and doctrines of devils.

527
00:55:10,027 --> 00:55:11,662
-Lewis...
-"Speaking lies in hypocrisy;

528
00:55:11,696 --> 00:55:12,764
having their conscience seared

529
00:55:12,797 --> 00:55:14,297
-with a hot iron."
-I don't want to--

530
00:55:14,331 --> 00:55:16,033
You must not harden your heart,
brother.

531
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:17,869
We cannot stand
in unholy places.

532
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:53,471
Will you still deny it?

533
00:56:20,932 --> 00:56:24,035
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

534
00:56:27,004 --> 00:56:29,106
-All of them?
-Sir, it is a sign.

535
00:56:29,907 --> 00:56:31,742
We have trusted too long
in the flesh of man.

536
00:56:31,776 --> 00:56:33,077
We must nourish ourselves
with the word of God.

537
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,680
Did you notice anyone else
in here

538
00:56:35,713 --> 00:56:38,482
prior to finding the rations
like this?

539
00:56:38,516 --> 00:56:39,650
No, sir.

540
00:56:39,684 --> 00:56:43,120
Time truly is no longer
a luxury.

541
00:56:43,154 --> 00:56:46,490
We must concentrate all efforts
on getting out.

542
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:50,595
And I'll have no more
of this gospel talk.

543
00:56:50,628 --> 00:56:52,830
No amount of scripture
or holy rite

544
00:56:52,864 --> 00:56:54,065
will have us any less fucked.

545
00:56:54,098 --> 00:56:55,032
Sir!

546
00:56:58,202 --> 00:56:59,537
I apologize.

547
00:57:01,205 --> 00:57:04,642
I've mistaken rashness
for candor.

548
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:07,044
I mustn't galvanize you
against your will,

549
00:57:08,445 --> 00:57:09,947
but I need you with me Lewis.

550
00:57:11,582 --> 00:57:14,417
Quite frankly, the Yanks
and the Kraut

551
00:57:14,451 --> 00:57:18,556
seem a little too chummy
for my liking.

552
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:22,827
And I do not want Segura
on the radio again.

553
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,695
God only knows what he's up to.

554
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:27,765
Maybe he and the Kraut

555
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:30,701
aren't too unfamiliar
with each other...

556
00:57:32,803 --> 00:57:36,574
-You don't think...
-I think our trust

557
00:57:36,607 --> 00:57:40,410
is best suited
to remain between us.

558
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,832
Hey.

559
00:58:46,544 --> 00:58:50,181
And the angels which kept
not their first estate,

560
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,618
but left their own habitation,

561
00:58:56,854 --> 00:59:00,057
he hath reserved
in everlasting chains

562
00:59:00,091 --> 00:59:04,695
under darkness
unto the judgement

563
00:59:04,729 --> 00:59:05,763
of that great day.

564
01:01:54,466 --> 01:01:55,399
Gas?

565
01:02:18,956 --> 01:02:21,125
You! There's no gas breach.

566
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:22,760
What is your design here?

567
01:02:22,793 --> 01:02:24,995
-Sir?
-Bollocks with the formality!

568
01:02:25,029 --> 01:02:26,797
Why are you tormenting us?

569
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,232
Sir, I don't know
what you're talking about.

570
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:30,734
-You and the Kraut.
-What?

571
01:02:30,768 --> 01:02:33,003
You lead us down here.

572
01:02:33,037 --> 01:02:35,105
You nursed him back
to health.

573
01:02:35,139 --> 01:02:38,342
You're conspiring together,
and I won't have it!

574
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:39,343
Lieutenant Turner!

575
01:02:45,816 --> 01:02:46,917
I apologize.

576
01:02:48,452 --> 01:02:50,421
Must be the air down here.

577
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,828
No one relieved you
of your duty.

578
01:02:59,564 --> 01:03:00,898
Take him back to work.

579
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:06,270
I gave you an order,
Private Baker.

580
01:03:06,303 --> 01:03:08,138
Maybe he'd be more at ease
if you put down your knife.

581
01:03:08,172 --> 01:03:10,107
Frightfully sorry?

582
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,109
You're not well, sir.

583
01:03:12,142 --> 01:03:15,946
I have been tolerant of you
out of respect for our alliance,

584
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,215
but if you attempt
to undermine me

585
01:03:18,249 --> 01:03:21,852
so help me god
I will bury you in this hole.

586
01:03:28,526 --> 01:03:30,894
I believe you have posts
to tend to.

587
01:03:37,368 --> 01:03:38,369
Yes, sir.

588
01:03:59,624 --> 01:04:00,592
Stick with me.

589
01:04:16,974 --> 01:04:20,377
As many as I love,
I rebuke and chasten:

590
01:04:20,411 --> 01:04:22,514
be zealous therefore,
and repent.

591
01:04:24,014 --> 01:04:25,849
Behold, I stand at the door,
and knock:

592
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:30,321
if any man hear my voice,
and open the door,

593
01:04:30,354 --> 01:04:32,923
I will come in to him,
and will sup with him,

594
01:04:34,024 --> 01:04:35,460
and he with me.

595
01:04:35,493 --> 01:04:37,227
<i>Come in, 11th Battalion?</i>

596
01:04:39,363 --> 01:04:41,932
Yes, this is Private Lewis.

597
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:44,168
<i>- Oh good.</i>
<i>- We thought we'd lost you.</i>

598
01:04:44,201 --> 01:04:46,136
Our unit has been held up
in the skirmish,

599
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,439
but we're fighting like hell
to get you.

600
01:04:48,473 --> 01:04:50,274
How are you managing
down there?

601
01:04:50,307 --> 01:04:52,910
I'm afraid I don't know
how much longer we can carry on.

602
01:04:54,111 --> 01:04:56,347
<i>Stay diligent, Private.</i>

603
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,048
<i>It in times such as these</i>

604
01:04:58,082 --> 01:05:00,250
<i>that a soldier shows</i>
<i>his true strength.</i>

605
01:05:00,284 --> 01:05:01,385
I'm not a soldier.

606
01:05:02,554 --> 01:05:05,356
I cannot bear this any longer.

607
01:05:05,389 --> 01:05:07,459
<i>Your strength</i>
<i>is your conviction,</i>

608
01:05:07,492 --> 01:05:09,159
<i>and such a strength it is.</i>

609
01:05:10,394 --> 01:05:13,465
<i>The others are in great peril,</i>
<i>Lewis.</i>

610
01:05:13,498 --> 01:05:15,567
<i>is unrelenting.</i>

611
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,436
<i>They're being led astray.</i>

612
01:05:19,471 --> 01:05:21,606
<i>You must be the beacon</i>
<i>of light,</i>

613
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:23,508
<i>that guides them to salvation.</i>

614
01:05:24,942 --> 01:05:27,244
<i>You've felt it all your life.</i>

615
01:05:27,277 --> 01:05:30,080
<i>As if you were called</i>
<i>by the Lord.</i>

616
01:05:30,114 --> 01:05:33,984
<i>Well, many are called, Lewis,</i>
<i>but few are chosen.</i>

617
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,041
Segura?

618
01:07:39,409 --> 01:07:41,044
Everything all right?

619
01:07:41,078 --> 01:07:41,713
Yeah.

620
01:07:42,847 --> 01:07:44,181
Just getting a second wind.

621
01:08:12,644 --> 01:08:14,546
- Lewis?
- Sir.

622
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:19,082
-How are we getting on?
-Steadfast sir.

623
01:08:19,116 --> 01:08:22,787
That's my boy. That's my boy.

624
01:08:25,623 --> 01:08:27,424
What are you doing, sir?

625
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:29,326
Preparing our defenses.

626
01:08:31,496 --> 01:08:32,396
For what sir?

627
01:08:33,464 --> 01:08:35,232
Lewis.

628
01:08:35,265 --> 01:08:37,234
Who do you think
will be waiting for us

629
01:08:37,267 --> 01:08:39,303
once we've breached
the trench wall?

630
01:08:40,337 --> 01:08:42,172
We need to be prepared.

631
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:46,343
I've a task for you.

632
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:48,780
Gather all the weapons we have.

633
01:08:48,813 --> 01:08:51,315
Anything that can be used
in defense.

634
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:56,821
And don't let the Yanks
catch you.

635
01:09:01,358 --> 01:09:03,695
Just as a precaution.

636
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,400
Right away, sir.

637
01:09:32,523 --> 01:09:33,524
How are you holding up?

638
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,295
Not sure, to be honest.

639
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:42,432
-You?
-Trying my best.

640
01:09:45,803 --> 01:09:46,738
Segura?

641
01:09:49,574 --> 01:09:51,676
Do you think we're really
trapped down here?

642
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:52,810
What do you mean?

643
01:09:55,613 --> 01:09:56,814
It doesn't feel like
we're trapped,

644
01:09:58,883 --> 01:10:00,217
it feels like we're...

645
01:10:01,919 --> 01:10:03,320
imprisoned.

646
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,825
Lewis says it's an omen.

647
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:09,527
I'd take what he says
with a grain of salt.

648
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:15,332
So, I mean you don't...

649
01:10:16,834 --> 01:10:18,469
you don't think
there's anything wrong?

650
01:10:18,503 --> 01:10:19,537
You don't feel it?

651
01:10:21,371 --> 01:10:22,607
I think the last thing
we need to do

652
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,675
is to scare ourselves.

653
01:10:25,442 --> 01:10:27,845
If we stay strong
and keep our heads together,

654
01:10:29,246 --> 01:10:30,247
we can get through this.

655
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:33,450
I don't know.

656
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:37,655
Lewis and the lieutenant
seem to be losing it.

657
01:10:41,559 --> 01:10:42,727
Maybe we're not far behind.

658
01:10:44,361 --> 01:10:46,263
We need each other.

659
01:10:46,296 --> 01:10:47,632
Otherwise,
we're as good as dead.

660
01:10:54,304 --> 01:10:55,940
Lieutenant Turner would like
to see us.

661
01:11:16,894 --> 01:11:20,565
I've called us all together
in the spirit of brotherhood.

662
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:26,637
May whatever tension there was
between us be left in the past.

663
01:11:27,972 --> 01:11:30,708
I'll not have our alliance
cankered with bitterness.

664
01:11:32,043 --> 01:11:35,880
Now, we've no food.
We've no water.

665
01:11:37,447 --> 01:11:41,052
We can feel the air grow
tighter
with every breath,

666
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:44,889
and a timely rescue
is uncertain.

667
01:11:44,922 --> 01:11:48,459
But if this is
to be an English position

668
01:11:48,493 --> 01:11:50,928
we will maintain order
under my judgment,

669
01:11:50,962 --> 01:11:53,363
lest we descend into chaos.

670
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:55,500
For the sake of the lives
of the men in this room

671
01:11:55,533 --> 01:11:57,334
that is not to be tested.

672
01:11:59,436 --> 01:12:00,738
First order of business,

673
01:12:02,473 --> 01:12:04,542
place your weapons
in the center of the room.

674
01:12:07,645 --> 01:12:10,347
You see that
I've disarmed myself.

675
01:12:13,718 --> 01:12:17,455
We will not carry on
until we can trust each other.

676
01:12:46,684 --> 01:12:47,752
Very good.

677
01:12:49,987 --> 01:12:52,723
Now, we've made great progress
with the tunnel,

678
01:12:52,757 --> 01:12:56,727
and I know we are all eager
to be free of this damn pit,

679
01:12:56,761 --> 01:12:58,428
but we must be prepared

680
01:12:58,462 --> 01:13:01,566
for the enemy awaiting us
outside the bunker.

681
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:05,770
Clearly, they've been one step
ahead of us,

682
01:13:05,803 --> 01:13:08,405
but as fate would see it...

683
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:11,475
We have a bargaining chip.

684
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:15,146
I appreciate the two of you
keeping an eye on him,

685
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:17,048
but going forward
he will be under

686
01:13:17,081 --> 01:13:19,917
my direct supervision
at all times.

687
01:13:21,118 --> 01:13:22,653
Take a seat in the corner.

688
01:13:33,764 --> 01:13:36,100
If you've any concerns,

689
01:13:36,133 --> 01:13:38,135
rather than quibble
amongst yourselves,

690
01:13:38,169 --> 01:13:40,771
I urge you to bring them
to my attention.

691
01:13:42,106 --> 01:13:45,076
Being the highest ranking
official here,

692
01:13:45,109 --> 01:13:47,912
any and all deviations
from what I set forth

693
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:50,948
will be regarded
as the highest form of treason.

694
01:13:50,982 --> 01:13:52,382
Is that understood?

695
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:55,452
Yes, sir.

696
01:13:57,188 --> 01:13:58,122
Good.

697
01:14:00,591 --> 01:14:03,426
I'm glad we've laid that matter
to rest.

698
01:14:04,729 --> 01:14:06,964
You may return to your tasks.

699
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:14,605
It's all a damn shame.

700
01:14:16,173 --> 01:14:17,407
All of it.

701
01:14:19,076 --> 01:14:20,845
What would you have me do,
Lewis?

702
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,181
I've done what I can
to be fair to them.

703
01:14:25,616 --> 01:14:26,751
You're an admirable leader, sir.

704
01:14:29,186 --> 01:14:30,588
Thank you, Lewis.

705
01:14:33,157 --> 01:14:34,892
You're a fine man.

706
01:14:36,193 --> 01:14:40,498
There's no other man
I'd rather have by my side.

707
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:47,138
Whatever path lays before us,
we shall stride it together.

708
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,281
-How's it going?
-Can't say for sure,

709
01:16:04,315 --> 01:16:06,650
but I think we're getting close
to the trench walls.

710
01:16:06,684 --> 01:16:08,152
Really?

711
01:16:08,185 --> 01:16:10,855
We're not out of the woods yet,
but we're getting there.

712
01:17:57,695 --> 01:17:59,296
Baker!

713
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:00,331
Jesus!

714
01:18:11,008 --> 01:18:12,009
What happened?

715
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,114
We're gonna die down here,
aren't we?

716
01:20:59,176 --> 01:21:00,177
Segura!

717
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:10,854
And then we wanna trust
one another.

718
01:21:10,888 --> 01:21:12,056
The great sword was given to me.

719
01:21:12,089 --> 01:21:13,390
Stand down, Lewis.

720
01:21:13,424 --> 01:21:15,527
You have no authority down here.

721
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,361
We answer to a higher power.

722
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:22,866
Oh, Angel of Christ,

723
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,335
my holy Guardian
and Protector...

724
01:21:24,368 --> 01:21:25,936
Release me!

725
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:27,338
Forgive me of all my sins

726
01:21:27,371 --> 01:21:29,073
and deliver me from the wiles
of the enemy.

727
01:21:29,106 --> 01:21:30,274
- Lewis, it's okay.
- Just calm down.

728
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:32,910
Goddammit Lewis, please!

729
01:21:32,943 --> 01:21:35,346
That I may not anger my God
by any sin.

730
01:21:35,379 --> 01:21:38,516
Pray for me,
sinful and unworthy servant.

731
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:39,950
Lewis, it's okay.

732
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:41,385
I'm just going to put the pin
back in.

733
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:44,121
That thou mayest present me
worthy of the kindness

734
01:21:44,154 --> 01:21:45,356
and mercy
of the All-holy Trinity...

735
01:21:45,389 --> 01:21:47,291
Lewis!

736
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:49,893
...and the Mother
of my Lord Jesus Christ,

737
01:21:49,927 --> 01:21:50,795
and of all the Saints...

738
01:21:50,829 --> 01:21:53,964
-Baker!
-It's okay, Lewis. It's okay.

739
01:21:56,033 --> 01:21:56,967
Amen.

740
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,438
Baker, get back!

Lewis.

Please forgive me, sir.

749
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:35,906
I only wanted to make you proud.

You're alright, Lewis.

Lewis?

No.

757
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:15,647
No.

758
01:23:17,782 --> 01:23:22,052

Come in, this is Private Segura
of the US 90th infantry.

769
01:24:16,106 --> 01:24:18,108
<i>Hello, Segura.</i>

770
01:24:18,141 --> 01:24:20,210
We need help.

771
01:24:20,244 --> 01:24:22,212
We have men down.
We need immediate assistance!

772
01:24:23,447 --> 01:24:24,414
Come in!

773
01:24:28,686 --> 01:24:30,220
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

774
01:24:30,254 --> 01:24:32,055
<i>that all our resources</i>
<i>are tied up.</i>

775
01:24:33,257 --> 01:24:35,058
<i>We won't get to you</i>
<i>for some time.</i>

776
01:24:35,092 --> 01:24:36,393
What?

777
01:24:36,426 --> 01:24:37,394
<i>That is, unless you can</i>

778
01:24:37,427 --> 01:24:40,097
<i>guarantee the prisoner's safety</i>
<i>upon rescue.</i>

779
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:41,733
Kurt?

780
01:24:41,766 --> 01:24:43,100
What does he have to do
with this?

781
01:24:43,133 --> 01:24:45,737
<i>- That information is classified</i>
<i>- I'm afraid,</i>

782
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:48,205
<i>need I remind you</i>
<i>of your rank?</i>

783
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:49,206
Who the hell is this?

784
01:24:55,145 --> 01:24:56,380
There's no one coming for us,
is there?

785
01:24:59,182 --> 01:25:01,285
So, who am I speaking with?

786
01:25:01,318 --> 01:25:02,654
<i>You'll know soon enough.</i>

787
01:25:02,687 --> 01:25:05,122
You son of a bitch!
We need help!

788
01:25:05,155 --> 01:25:06,290
<i>And why fend for them?</i>

789
01:25:07,725 --> 01:25:10,495
<i>You would be the first</i>
<i>they throw to the fire.</i>

790
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,497
<i>They would claim</i>
<i>your sacrifices</i>

791
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:15,399
<i>and deny you your achievements.</i>

792
01:25:15,432 --> 01:25:17,267
<i>Why stand for those</i>
<i>who would keep you</i>

793
01:25:17,301 --> 01:25:19,403
<i>beneath the soles</i>
<i>of their boots?</i>

794
01:25:20,772 --> 01:25:23,340
<i>I'm sure you've never felt</i>
<i>more alone.</i>

795
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:25,108
<i>But you are wanted, Segura.</i>

796
01:25:25,142 --> 01:25:27,244
<i>You have proven your worth.</i>

797
01:25:27,277 --> 01:25:28,245
<i>You are chosen.</i>

798
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,681
What?

799
01:25:47,532 --> 01:25:48,432
Give me the gun.

800
01:27:50,822 --> 01:27:53,390
You need to talk.
What is this?

801
01:27:53,423 --> 01:27:55,425
Why do you assume
I have any answers?

802
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,628
Let's call it a gut feeling.
What is this?

803
01:27:57,662 --> 01:27:59,597
There is no time for this.

804
01:28:03,534 --> 01:28:05,302
Kurt, please help us.

805
01:28:22,854 --> 01:28:24,889
It is the Angel of War.

806
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:30,728
A dark guardian,
lifeless and deathless.

807
01:28:30,762 --> 01:28:32,029
Damned and fallen.

808
01:28:33,664 --> 01:28:36,333
A devil in shepherd's robe.

809
01:28:37,969 --> 01:28:39,036
What does that make you?

810
01:28:42,573 --> 01:28:43,641
It needs a vessel.

811
01:28:45,943 --> 01:28:47,344
I am but its lamb.

812
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:52,984
Its ward and it's dependent,
cursed by its care.

813
01:28:56,754 --> 01:28:57,722
What's it doing to us?

814
01:28:59,356 --> 01:29:01,025
It can exist only in conflict,

815
01:29:03,094 --> 01:29:06,898
and as with conflict
it exists only to consume.

816
01:29:12,036 --> 01:29:13,004
How do we stop it?

817
01:29:14,839 --> 01:29:16,439
It cannot be stopped.

818
01:29:37,128 --> 01:29:38,062
You...

819
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:42,867
Ever since you Yanks
entered my trench

820
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,836
it's all gone to hell.

821
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:48,438
All my men are dead.

822
01:29:49,507 --> 01:29:51,809
My men.

823
01:29:51,843 --> 01:29:54,912
Out of respect
I've been patient with you,

824
01:29:54,946 --> 01:29:57,682
and look where that's gotten us.

825
01:29:57,715 --> 01:30:00,051
-Sir--
-I've tried to reason with you,

826
01:30:00,084 --> 01:30:03,521
but you've backed me
against the wall.

827
01:30:03,554 --> 01:30:06,657
Look at you,
colluding with the enemy.

828
01:30:08,659 --> 01:30:11,394
-Turner--
-Traitors.

829
01:30:11,428 --> 01:30:12,530
Lieutenant, please.

830
01:30:13,698 --> 01:30:15,533
We can't turn
on each other now.

831
01:30:15,566 --> 01:30:16,901
We can get out of here together.

832
01:30:16,934 --> 01:30:18,936
As God is my witness,

833
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:21,806
I will honor
the lives of the men

834
01:30:21,839 --> 01:30:24,775
whose blood was shed
under my care.

835
01:30:25,943 --> 01:30:29,580
Know that I have not fallen mad.

836
01:30:29,614 --> 01:30:33,718
I am merely bound by duty!

837
01:30:53,771 --> 01:30:56,540
This is where you make
your stand?

838
01:30:56,574 --> 01:30:57,475
With the enemy?

839
01:30:58,643 --> 01:31:01,812
To be expected from the likes
of you.

840
01:31:54,231 --> 01:31:55,533
Rot in hell.

841
01:33:10,741 --> 01:33:11,876
No.

842
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,735
Let it be buried with me.

843
01:33:39,804 --> 01:33:43,741
Let... let this place be lost
to history.

844
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:48,746
- We're getting you out.
- No. No.

845
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:53,818
Leave me. And don't look back.

846
01:33:53,851 --> 01:33:54,785
Segura!

847
01:33:58,856 --> 01:34:00,925
I'm coming back for you.

848
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:03,360
That would be the last thing
you do.

849
01:34:22,313 --> 01:34:23,747
I killed the Lieutenant.

850
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:30,955
Thank you, Baker.

851
01:34:49,406 --> 01:34:50,307
We're getting out of here.

852
01:35:15,065 --> 01:35:16,100
Segura...

853
01:35:32,116 --> 01:35:33,017
We're almost there.

854
01:36:12,323 --> 01:36:14,058
Keep going.
I know it's hard.

855
01:37:02,574 --> 01:37:03,807
We gotta keep going.

856
01:37:08,112 --> 01:37:09,847
-Segura?
-What?

857
01:37:12,416 --> 01:37:15,052
-I shouldn't be here.
-I know, I know.

858
01:37:15,085 --> 01:37:17,187
No.

859
01:37:17,221 --> 01:37:20,257
No, I lied to enlist.

860
01:37:22,259 --> 01:37:23,193
I'm 16.

861
01:37:25,863 --> 01:37:28,899
My mom,
she thinks I'm away working.

862
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:34,038
You have to find her.

863
01:37:37,509 --> 01:37:39,477
You have to find her
and tell her I'm sorry.

864
01:37:39,511 --> 01:37:40,578
Don't be, it's okay.

865
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:43,414
I'm sorry.

866
01:37:44,616 --> 01:37:46,850
Baker? Baker?

867
01:37:52,923 --> 01:37:56,293
Help! Help!

868
01:37:56,327 --> 01:38:00,864
Help! Help! Help!

869
01:38:00,898 --> 01:38:03,334
Easy now. You're alright.

870
01:38:05,470 --> 01:38:08,005
Oh, don't worry, bud.
You're in good hands now.

871
01:38:08,038 --> 01:38:09,173
Jesus Christ,
you two've been through it,

872
01:38:09,206 --> 01:38:10,642
haven't ya?

873
01:38:10,675 --> 01:38:12,644
- The stretcher.
- Get him on the stretcher.

874
01:38:12,677 --> 01:38:13,844
Get him on.

875
01:38:22,252 --> 01:38:23,220
Thank you.

876
01:38:24,556 --> 01:38:26,357
I'll see you at home.

877
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:27,291
You coming?

878
01:38:29,193 --> 01:38:31,362
No, there's one more.

879
01:38:33,297 --> 01:38:35,633
Hey soldier, you just rest
easy now, you hear?

880
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:37,434
You got a warm
welcome waiting for you.
