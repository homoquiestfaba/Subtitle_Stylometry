He's a marine.

be home for good in the fall

get married in the spring.

I'm not really like that.

Like what'?

257
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,239
Like someone who does
things she's always wanted to

258
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,832
for fear of life
lived with regret

259

a life with experimentation

some skinned knees as well.

And the hottest wedges.

535
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:52,132
Sam, the cameraman, can you
please pan down to show those?

536
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:52,890
What are they'?

537
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,424
I wanna say are they Guess'?

538
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,902
Good guess!

539
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:58,404
Fabulous!

540
00:22:58,426 --> 00:23:00,633
The whole thing,
very, very put together.

541
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:02,903
Now for those of my viewers
who can't afford to spend

542
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:04,433
five hundred dollars
on a casual

543
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,035
Sunday out-with-the-girls,
Sam, cover your ears,

544
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:10,016
"Not even tryin'
to get laid," outfit.

545
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:11,779
Uh, how do you know
I'm not tryin' to get laid?

546
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:12,807
[LAUGHS]

547
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:14,820
Can I uncover my ears now'?

548
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:16,480
(in unison) No!

549
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,421
I'm just kiddin'.

550
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:19,049
I'm, uh,
I'm savin' myself, of course,

551
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,658
for my darlin' fiancé
who is in Afghanistan.

552
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:22,821
Really?

553
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:23,989
How virtuous.

554
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:26,555
See, gents, old-fashioned
girls do still exist

555
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:27,726
and they can be fun and sexy

556
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:29,475
and you shouldn't
judge a book by its cover.

557
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,732
I mean, unless you're
just interested in the cover,

558
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,763
which, in my case,
is perfectly all right.

559
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:35,900
Okay, I'm just kidding.

560
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,409
No hos in the house tonight.

561
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:38,410
Now?

562
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,379
Yes, baby, it's fine now.

563
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:42,074
Where was I'?
Oh, right, okay.

564
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:44,749
So for those of you
more on a budget,

565
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:46,615
I've thrown together
this little bit of a mutt.

566
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,018
It's a mix of spring and summer

567
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:49,680
because it's still
a little chilly at night.

568
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:51,657
I made this
geometric patterned dress

569
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,716
I paired with
a skinny black belt,

570
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:55,625
lace tights,
and the black flats

571
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,597
and for a little added warmth
I have this black cardigan.

572
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,721
It's a jumble of stuff, but
I feel like it works, right'?

573
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:02,497
Oh, totally!

574
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,867
Yeah, you don't wanna
go outwith too little

575
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:05,530
and suddenly
be caught with a chill.

576
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,666
Comfortability before vanity.

577
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:10,039
I don't think so.

578
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:11,407
Oh, no.

579
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:13,776
Look, I would walk
a mile in six-inch stilettos

580
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:16,839
that turn my feet into bloody
stumps if they were Manolos.

581
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,373
Truth.

582
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,716
All right, tune in next week
for my latest outfit.

583
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:22,881
Let's give a big round of
applause for my fabulous guest,

584
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:24,015
Francesca Duval.

585
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:24,819
[CLAPPING]

586
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:26,086
Thank you.
I had a blast.

587
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:28,890
And for my always handsome
and dapper cameraman, Sam.

588
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,658
[CLAPPING]

589
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:32,562
Stay sexy, freaks.

590
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,133
- Oh, that was so much fun!
- So much fun.

591
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,496
<i>Time for bed, Little Man.</i>

592
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:40,437
Dad!
It's early!

593
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:41,599
<i>Bed!</i>

594
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:42,573
Come on, kiddo.

595
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:44,133
Go brush your teeth.
I'll tuck you in.

596
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:45,969
Good night, Sam.

597
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,480
Bye.

598
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:53,744
God, he's so cute.

599
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,886
I'm gonna
go to the bathroom now.

600
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:00,585
Yeah, sure.

601
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:01,787
Okay.

602
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:24,041
Hey!

603
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:24,709
Hey.

604
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:25,774
Everything okay'?

605
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:26,717
Oh! Yeah.

606
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,721
Just false alarm.

607
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:34,125
I'm so sorry about the whole,
uh, tampon thing earlier.

608
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:36,788
You know, you're just,
you're so much like a -

609
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:38,695
You are so fine. No, really,

610
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:40,699
I mean it's not even the
first time that it's happened.

611
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:42,497
My own doctor
gets mixed up about it

612
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:44,127
and he's had
my junk in his hands.

613
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:45,694
[CHUCKLES]

614
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,502
I'll go in for my
medication and he'll be like,

615
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:49,474
"So we're giving you
testosterone, right?"

616
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:52,034
And I'll be like, "No, estrogen'?
I'm tryin' to be a girl here?"

617
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:54,205
[CHUCKLES]

618
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,880
What bathroom do you go in'?

619
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:02,216
Well, now I use
the women's room.

620
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:03,764
But back when
I was eight and nine

621
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:05,655
and it was like the boys
against the girls...

622
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,658
Mm-hmm.

623
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:08,752
The boys would go to one side,
the girls would go to the other

624
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:10,626
and I'd be stuck in the middle
and end up on the sideline

625
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,790
with the kid on crutches.

626
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:12,593
Oh.

627
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,928
I changed out in the boys'
locker room though,

628
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,629
until my breasts started growin'
in when I was like fifteen

629
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,194
and then the school
just kinda gave me

630
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:20,536
an excused
permanent pass from gym.

631
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:22,563
They just figured it
would be easier that way.

632
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:24,201
Well, how cool were you'?

633
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:26,610
A lifetime,
"Get Outta Gym," card.

634
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:28,705
Stop.

635
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,874
How old's your brother'?

636
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:31,713
He's eight.

637
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:34,549
Our mom died
when he was one, so

638
00:26:34,575 --> 00:26:36,510
I've kinda been
the only girl in his life.

639
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,548
More of a mom
than a sister, really.

640
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:40,889
How'd your mom die'?

641
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:43,191
Cancer.

642
00:26:45,753 --> 00:26:47,061
I'm sorry.

643
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:49,694
It's okay.

644
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:52,796
- Is your family supportive'?
- Yeah.

645
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:55,103
My dad actually
bought me my first Barbies

646
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:57,735
when he realized when not
havin' an interest in football

647
00:26:57,765 --> 00:27:00,644
wasn't gonna be fixed by just
replacing it with baseball.

648
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:01,840
[LAUGHS]

649
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,084
So I-l guess that means you've
never been with a girl, right'?

650
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:10,578
Mm-mm.

651
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:12,921
Hmm.

652
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:15,928
Not even once, by accident'?

653
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,156
[LAUGHS]

654
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,792
No, I-l can't say
I've ever accidentally

655
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:22,733
tripped and fell
while sportin' a boner

656
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:24,168
and landed in a woman's vagina.

657
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,727
Oh, my God.

658
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,671
I can be clumsy,
but I'm not that bad.

659
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:28,696
[LAUGHS]

660
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:36,876
I, um, I did almost
kiss a girl once, though.

661
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:40,852
On a dare, I seem to remember.

662
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,651
But I chickened out.

663
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,620
Well, I've never
kissed a girl either, so,

664
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:51,755
I guess we're even.

665
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:04,336
Look, I don't-I don't
wanna be a bad influence.

666
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,976
I respect
the sanctity of marriage.

667
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,206
Engagement.

668
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:08,908
That too.

669
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:11,610
And I don't wanna
have any regrets.

670
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,880
I wanna live out loud,
like you do.

671
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,345
It comes with
a pretty big price tag.

672
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:21,350
Not as big a price
tag as the alternative.

673
00:28:57,618 --> 00:29:00,064
I'm sorry.

674
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:04,901
Francesca, wait!

675
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:07,967
Francesca, wait!

676
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:09,133
I brushed my teeth.

677
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:10,733
Are you gonna tuck me in'?

678
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:14,269
Yeah, pumpkin.
Head upstairs.

679
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:41,336
I'm glad you have a new friend.

680
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,705
Me, too.

681
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,370
Now get some sleep.

682
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,942
It's okay that I like
to play with toy soldiers

683
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,109
and play football, right'?

684
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:52,845
What, honey'?

685
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,945
I'm not weird because I'm a boy

686
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:57,855
and I like to have my marine
guys rescue Barbie dolls

687
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,224
and not the other way around'?

688
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:02,853
We girls always
have to do the rescuing,

689
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,329
regardless of how it looks,

690
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:06,923
but that's a lesson
for another day.

691
00:30:06,954 --> 00:30:08,956
Listen...

692
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,799
you are perfect in every way,
sweet boy.

693
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:20,904
You're normal and there
is nothing wrong with you, okay'?

694
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:24,382
However and whatever toys
you wanna play with is fine.

695
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,818
You're supposed to do
what makes you happy, okay'?

696
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:30,152
What would make me happy

697
00:30:30,177 --> 00:30:32,412
is if a certain little man
was asleep right now.

698
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,086
Love you, Dad.

699
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:36,994
Love you.

700
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,176
What?

701
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:55,178
You didn't get that from me,
is all.

702
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,010
Yes, I did.

703
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:55,864
Come on.

704
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,544
It'll come tomorrow.

705
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:10,955
All right.

706
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:12,514
Ham and cheese, coffee black.

707
00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:13,991
Just make sure he eats it.

708
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,323
Mm-hmm.

709
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:20,387
Hmm.

710
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:23,300
So, Francesca
kissed me last night.

711
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:26,270
What?

712
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:28,273
She's much deeper than
she appears at first blush.

713
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:29,501
And she's got a big heart.

714
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,975
I like that.

715
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:33,977
What do you mean she kissed you'?

716
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:35,207
Where'? When'?

717
00:32:35,236 --> 00:32:37,273
In my room,
after we made the video.

718
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:39,284
I don't know,
it just kinda happened.

719
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:43,982
Wha-and-and what-what
happened after you kissed?

720
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:45,115
She ran away.

721
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:47,148
It was adorable.

722
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:50,185
You know, you really shouldn't
mess around with her.

723
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:52,322
I mean she has a fiancé.
Marines are nuts.

724
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:53,991
They kill people for fun.

725
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:55,432
I ain't scared of him.

726
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:56,992
And anyway,
I'm not a home wrecker.

727
00:32:57,024 --> 00:32:59,300
It was just one innocent kiss.

728
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:01,397
I'm sure it won't happen again.

729
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:02,430
Yeah, I'm sure.

730
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:03,635
Come on!
It's not my thing.

731
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:05,104
You know that.

732
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:06,873
But a little
healthy exploration,

733
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,541
I mean, that's what your
early twenties are for, right'?

734
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:16,519
But, um, just in case
it should happen again,

735
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,423
maybe if one thing
leads to another...

736
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:20,619
Yeah'?

737
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,129
What's it like?

738
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:27,654
I mean, like, okay,
so what would you, um,

739
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:31,125
what-what would I-Well,
what's one supposed to do'?

740
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:33,138
Oh! Oh, Jesus.
Oh, here we go.

741
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,039
Robby, come on, I have no one
else to talk to about this.

742
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:44,980
Okay, uh, what do you-
what do you wanna know'?

743
00:33:45,005 --> 00:33:50,011
Okay, so,
you know the, um, the-

744
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:51,079
Dick'?

745
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,318
On a genetic girl!

746
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:53,154
Oh, the va-jay-jay.

747
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,251
Oh, my God, you do not
watch the Kardashians.

748
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:56,283
I loves it.

749
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:58,263
Has my coming out to girls
really inspired you, baby'?

750
00:33:58,285 --> 00:33:59,025
Please.

751
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:00,497
Only gay boys
watch those girl shows.

752
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:01,932
Oh, yeah,
'cuz what straight guy

753
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,299
would wanna watch
hot sisters and best friends

754
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:05,167
mess around
with each other half naked

755
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:06,694
and then makin'
full-on porn tapes'?

756
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:08,304
That is-that is so gay.

757
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:13,301
Anyway, I hear it's very,
um, it's very complicated.

758
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:16,713
You know, the vaj,

759
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:19,349
with all its various fluids
flowing at different times.

760
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:23,219
There's-there's the period,
the wetness during sex, so,

761
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:26,191
okay, so like, I mean,
does it start out wet'?

762
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:28,625
Or-or do I have to get it wet'?

763
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,630
Well, wait, does she get it-
wait-how does it get wet'?

764
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:33,164
Are you fuckin'
retarded right now'?

765
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:34,291
Robby!

766
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:35,629
It's not easy for me
to talk about these things.

767
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,226
Just tell me.

768
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:44,374
Okay, well...
I mean you start makin' out,

769
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:46,207
you know,
like you would with a guy.

770
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:47,541
And then'?

771
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:53,575
Okay, well you-you know how-
how you get, like, aroused...

772
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:54,677
Right.

773
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,654
She will, too.

774
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,590
And that'll make her wet'?

775
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:01,354
Right.

776
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:03,293
Okay.

777
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,422
Is it tight like an asshole -

778
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:06,590
Okay! Okay!
Google time.

779
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,325
Robby!

780
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:09,766
No, no, no, confused gay chat
rooms or something, seriously!

781
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,992
Don't be a baby about it,
just tell me!

782
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:16,466
No.

783
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:22,277
No, it probably won't be
as tight as a... No.

784
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:23,576
Really?

785
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,277
And how would you know'?

786
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:27,616
I just know, okay'?

787
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:30,121
All right, look,
can we-come on,

788
00:35:30,144 --> 00:35:31,282
all right'? I gotta
get back to work.

789
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:31,912
Where were we'?

790
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:32,513
Tightness.

791
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:34,116
Right.

792
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:36,788
No, it-it-it-it won't-it
won't be as tight as

793
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:39,623
but it will be

794
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:46,636
very, um, warm

795
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,436
and, uh, like, gushy.

796
00:35:49,463 --> 00:35:50,339
Ew.

797
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:52,776
But, like, in the most
amazing possible,

798
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,440
you know, warm, gushy way.

799
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:57,380
I can't believe
I'm havin' this conversation.

800
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:58,747
Look, just try it, okay'?

801
00:35:58,772 --> 00:36:01,810
Just-just-just get in there
and-and let nature take over.

802
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,816
I mean, you know,

803
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,112
even though you're
a hot chick and everything,

804
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:06,813
the other part of you
has millions of years of DNA

805
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,488
slammin' down on you,
instinctively lettin' you know

806
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:11,189
how and where to stick it

807
00:36:11,218 --> 00:36:12,595
and-and what the fuck
to do with it

808
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,531
and afterwards you'll
make your own assessment.

809
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:16,262
Okay, okay.

810
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,826
I gotta be done with this
conversation, really,

811
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:18,825
that's all
I'm gonna say about it.

812
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:20,203
Okay, thank you.

813
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:22,298
I'd just like to enjoy the last
part of my break in peace.

814
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:25,333
Hey, really, Robby,
no, thank you so much.

815
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,607
I really do appreciate
your help. Thank you.

816
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:29,205
You're welcome.

817
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:35,242
Does it really smell like fish'?

818
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,084
Goodbye.

819
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,418
'Cuz I don't think
I'd be able to handle that.

820
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:38,388
You're not a well person.

821
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:40,255
Look, I'm not sayin'
it does or anythin',

822
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,259
but how am I supposed to know'?

823
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,353
She smells really good!

824
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:45,557
It was somethin'
I liked about her.

825
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:48,793
Who smelled really good'?

826
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,497
Hey.

827
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,562
Were you talkin' about me'?

828
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:56,268
Yeah, but, you know,
he's my best friend.

829
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,867
He won't-
he won't tell a soul. I-

830
00:36:58,098 --> 00:36:59,372
No, it's okay.

831
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,676
I trust you.

832
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,514
You dropped this.

833
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:07,849
Oh.

834
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:13,888
I'm, uh,
I'm sorry about last night.

835
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,493
Runnin' away like that
was so childish of me.

836
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:20,692
I guess I was just
a little bit caught off guard.

837
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,291
It's totally fine.

838
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,428
I was, too.

839
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:30,900
So... my daddy's havin' another
one of his parties and, um,

840
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:35,875
I was hopin' that you might
be able to help me find a dress'?

841
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:37,348
Okay.

842
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:39,408
Okay.

843
00:37:48,148 --> 00:37:50,424
You smelled really good, too.

844
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:16,778
Yeah, see,
I have all these dresses.

845
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,791
This is one of the biggest
problems livin' in a small town.

846
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:21,451
One of the biggest problems'?

847
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:23,428
It doesn't even
crack my top ten.

848
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,487
I like livin' in a small town.

849
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,590
It makes me feel safe.

850
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:29,430
It makes me feel claustrophobic.

851
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:31,231
I can't wait to get outta here.

852
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:32,635
Really?

853
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:33,967
Are you kidding'?

854
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,332
New York'?

855
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,706
I was born in the wrong body
and the wrong town.

856
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:39,608
There really
are no dresses here.

857
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:43,414
Come on.

858
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:46,283
Whe-where are we goin'?

859
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:47,910
Target.

860
00:38:49,343 --> 00:38:54,850
Um, yeah, I-I'm the least snobby
seemingly snobby person I know,

861
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:55,860
but really, I just-

862
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:57,521
I don't think I can wear
a dress from Target.

863
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,895
Oh, my God, I would never have
you wear a dress from there.

864
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,491
Thank you.

865
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,757
But I would
have you wear a dress

866
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:07,329
that I make out
of a tablecloth from there.

867
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,800
Hmm.

868
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:27,456
I hate that I'm so short.

869
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:30,794
I wish I was tall like you.

870
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:32,388
What are you talkin' about'?

871
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,932
You're like the perfect height.

872
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,399
And besides,

873
00:39:35,422 --> 00:39:37,925
boys like girls who
are shorter than them anyway.

874
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:41,329
You're gonna rock this outfit.

875
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:43,398
Well, we don't
dress cute for boys.

876
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,875
Who cares
if they like the outfit'?

877
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:47,037
Yes,
but we do undress for them.

878
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,440
And we care what
they think then, right'?

879
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:03,555
Are you a virgin, too'?

880
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,790
Yeah.

881
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:07,059
I mean, with girls.

882
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,070
Look,
I shouldn't be the one to...

883
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:57,076
It's okay, I want to.

884
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:01,450
I don't think it's right.

885
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:04,786
No, it's okay.
Really.

886
00:41:05,445 --> 00:41:08,392
