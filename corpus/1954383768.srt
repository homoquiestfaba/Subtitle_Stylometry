00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,161
           This is not.         
           It's a Walther P38.  

116
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,631
                Your dad was in 
                the war, right? 

117
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,967
          Yeah, tank gunner.    

118
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,201
 Yeah, but...                   

119
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,240
          Which side was he on? 

120
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:31,943
 So, Richard, you're telling me 
 all these herbs come           
 from your own garden?          

121
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,912
     Yeah, from the fall.       
     They're dried now.         

122
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,081
 Um, really good.               

123
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,884
 You went and pee               
 in this, did you?              
 I just fucking with you.       

124
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,786
 I know you ain't peed.         
 I could tell if                
 you did, though.               

125
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,988
 What? What's the matter?       

126
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,791
 Oh, that. That ain't...        

127
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,195
 It's actually my favorite.     
 But, you know,                 
 Richard don't think...         

128
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,797
 Some niggas is all right,      
 ain't they? Right?             

129
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,600
             Some.              

130
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,103
 ORDELL: You like               
 that Diahann Carroll,          
 don't you?                     

131
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,873
  Don't get cute for            
  company. You talk             
  about her all the time.       

132
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,010
   But the rest of them,        
   and I tend to agree          
   with him on this one,        

133
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,978
   he said they need            
   to go back to Africa.        

134
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,246
 The ones on welfare.           

135
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,848
          Right. Of course      
          the ones on welfare.  

136
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,082
         You know,              
         they ain't doing shit. 

137
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,318
       They ain't               
       contributing to society. 

138
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,188
 He said I could stay, though.  
 At least until we              
 finish the job, you know.      

139
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,658
           We should get going. 

140
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,992
 Yeah, you don't...             
 You don't want nothing?        

141
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:21,993
    You don't want me           
    to follow her today?        

142
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,562
                        No.     

143
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,264
 No, no. No, that's fine.       
 We're good today.              

144
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,300
             We'll get in touch 
             with you, Richard. 

145
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,801
     He's incredible.           
     He's amazing.              

146
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,603
   Listen, all I got to         
   do was tell him,             

147
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,239
 "Hey, Richard,                 
 this a rich, big Jew."         

148
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,608
    And then it's like,         
    "This is for the cause."    

149
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,977
       Then he would do it      
       even if he didn't        
       need the money so bad.   

150
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,213
 What's he need money for?      
 Buy more guns?                 
 Hitler's underwear?            

151
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,717
            No.                 
            (CHUCKLES) His      
            old lady left him.  

152
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,186
         Ran off, took Richard  
         Junior and everything. 

153
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,654
      No kidding.               
                 Yeah.          

154
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,890
          Now he think that     
          they in California    

155
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:55,226
      'cause he got a           
      postcard from Disneyland. 

156
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,761
        Jesus.                  

157
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,196
            He so dumb,         
            it's adorable.      

158
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,374
 LOUIS: That's her?             
            ORDELL: That's her. 

159
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,375
               Hmm.             

160
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,945
 I was expecting someone older. 

161
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,148
                Oh, that's her. 

162
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,652
 That's the one we want.        
 That's Mickey.                 

163
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,754

           to choose us for     
           this stupid article? 

164
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,255
   Because you won that day.    

165
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,791

 focus on today's game?         

170
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,405
 You didn't wake me up.         

171
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,140
       I didn't know you

       You didn't say anything.

 tennis on Sundays, huh?        
                     Well...    

173

 Why would I play               
 tennis on Sundays?             
                    I'm just...

 I do every Sunday?

176
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,818
                         Okay.  

177
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,188
 Why do I have to wake up       
 to that neighbor's dog?        

178
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,325

 have we told him?              
 "Keep it locked up."

       name's in the paper.

181
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,430
 No, it's actually              
 about the kids.                

182
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,098

           kids playing tennis? 

183

     Oh, oh, look at that!      
     It's the two of you there. 

184
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,236

 You look stressed, honey.      

187
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,112
 Listen, since I'm,             
 uh, going down to Freeport     
 the end of the week...         

188
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,183
 I told you                     
 about that, right?             

189
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,118
          I don't know.         
          You might have.       

190
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
 Yeah, I'm sure I did.

         Can you believe it?    

193
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,827
 So, I figured,                 
 why not fly down               
 to South Beach.                

194

    With Bo? See your folks.    

196
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,803
 Get him settled,               
 then I'll hop on               
 the shuttle to Freeport.       

197
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,305
         What do you think, Bo? 
         Sound like fun?        

198
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,144
  I just don't see why          
  all of a sudden he has to go. 

199
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,281
          How many times?       
          You don't say "he."   

200
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:59,150
 You know who I mean.           
           That's not the       
           point, all right?    

201
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,720
           He, your father,     
           will be in Freeport, 

202
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,955
              and he thought    
              it would be nice

   for you guys to

   and spend some quality time.

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,894
            He'll probably      
            check out the camp. 

205
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,996
       You know, he loves       
       watching you. So...      

206
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,065
   He loves to tell me what     
   to do. He doesn't know shit.

      Not now,                  
      'cause we don't have      
      enough time, but... Um...

00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,461
                  A talk.

          just tell each other

 What are you                   
 thinking about?                

235
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,599
 How are you?                   

236
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,970
        I'm fine. How are you?  

237
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,472
 You know, I seem to recall     
 saying something               
 to you last night.

                  What?         

240
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,580
 I asked if you'd               
 have lunch with me.            

241
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:11,583
           Marshall, you were   
           drunk. We all were.

250
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,465
 What I'm gonna do is           
 cut out the picture            
 and keep it in my wallet.

 too bad about lunch.

 any of the things              
 I said last night?

258
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:41,980
 How I've been                  
 thinking about you?            

259

             Okay, I gotta go.  

260

     Bo's match is in a moment, 
     so I'm late for that.      

261
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,386
 I hear Frank's                 
 off to the Bahamas.            

262
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,922
           Just for a few days. 

263
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,290
 I asked him if he              
 wanted to play next Saturday   

264
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,491
 and he said he'd be            
 gone the whole week.           

265
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,431
                   When...

00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,036
             No, when did he... 

268
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,471
             This is really     
             not a good idea.   
 You're right.                  

269
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,406
                   Okay?        
 You're right.                  

270

 Okay. Frank is coming,         
 so let's just...               

273
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,345
 Okay, I'll see you.            

274

 back to come get me?

 she'd seen you.

00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:10,627
     What's he tell this        
     Melanie? How tight you     
     think he is with her?      

686
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:12,161
          She ain't             
          nothing but some ass. 

687
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:14,097
        Just some ass.          
        Don't worry about that.

            on up there?

 The fuck are you doing!        

696
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,170
            Put my eye out      
            with a cigarette.   

697
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,205
  Shit. How'd she...            
               You peep through 
               the walls.       

698

           What did you expect? 
           He thinks he's in    
           the fucking Gestapo.

 her those cigarettes?

 LOUIS: I did.                  
 Just relax.                    
 Let me take a look.            

701
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:37,347
 I'm blind! I can't see!

 You got the other eye.

 I'm cool. I'm cool.            

706
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,688
                  I'll take     
                  a look at it. 

707
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,056
                   Oh, shut up!

 Just cool out.

               (CHUCKLES)       

713
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,939
 So, Richard,                   
 I got a joke for you.          
 You might like this one.       

714
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:05,141
 You too, Louis.

 Dude goes to                   
 the doctor, right?             

716
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:10,747
   Doctor says,                 
   "Sir, you have to            
   stop masturbating."          

717

 Doctor goes,                   

718
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,220
    "Because I'm                
    trying to examine you."

 What, that too close to home?  

721
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:25,895
 All right, how about this one?

 I got some food for you.       

726
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:46,015
 I got chicken                  
 and noodles                    
 cooked in chicken soup         

727

 Looks pretty good.

     Okay.

 they pick up something.

00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,027
 It isn't unusual.              

753
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,968
          How do you know that? 

754
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,004
 I can't tell you.              

755
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:17,874
 You know about his             
 personal bank account          
 in Freeport?                   

756
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:19,876
 Hey.                           

757
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,145
 Face forward.                  

758
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,349
         I know he does         
         business down there.   
         I would assume that... 

759
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:28,451
 With over                      
 a million in it?               

760
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:30,987
          How do you know that? 

761
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,121
  We know.                      

762
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,423
                Maybe that's... 

763
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:35,925
 It's 50 grand a month          

764
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,393
 he's been taking               
 out of his apartments          

765

      <i> cost me 100 grand.</i>       

767
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,476
 I put about 40                 
 grand worth of materials       
 and appliances in it           

768
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,411
 and have it                    
 reappraised for 200 grand.     

769
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:56,946
                  Wow.          

770
00:46:56,948 --> 00:47:00,149
 Okay. Now, I've only           
 put 10% down, right?           

771
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,051
   And the 40 grand of          
   materials actually only      

772
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:03,820
   really cost me about         
   four or five grand.          

773
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,422
 But I'm writing off            
 depreciation on...             

774
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:09,058
             Two hundred grand. 
        Right.                  

775
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,461
 And on the rentals,            
 I only declare 60% occupancy.  

776
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:13,529
 And that's                     
 all paid in cash.              

777
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,164
                      Jeez.     

778
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,867
         You're a genius, baby. 

779
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:22,205
 Somehow, though,               
 these guys that called,        
 they know about this.          

780
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,413
         What's fucked up here, 
         besides the obvious,   

781
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:33,583
         is here you are        
         filing for divorce,    
         and then this happens. 

782
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:35,952
     Not wanting to be married, 

783
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,187
      but, I mean, gosh,        
      don't want anything awful 
      to happen to her, either. 

784
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,356
  Yeah. Yeah, right.            

785
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,460
        I mean, you may pay     
        the million bucks,      
        and they still might... 

786
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:48,197
      I mean, let me rephrase   
      that. You still might not 
      see her again, honey.     

787
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,199
     Or if I couldn't           
     get to the bank            
     for some reason            

788
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,535
    and didn't make             
    the payment on              
    time, then what?            

789
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:55,471
          Do you know what?     
          We don't even know if 
          she's alive or dead.  

790
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,173
 We know she's alive.           
 I talked to her on the phone.  

791
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:58,441
                   But was that 
                   really her?  

792
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:00,943
 That was her.                  
 It was definitely her.         

793
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:04,447
            Gosh, I don't know. 

794
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:08,017
      I mean,                   
      we could call their bluff 
      and see what happens.

         anything. He just      
         wanted to talk to you.

01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,246
     You look good.             

1355
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:49,783
       Marshall, there is       
       a hole in my closet door 
       the size of you.         

1356
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:52,519
       Jesus, I know.           
       Maybe if we hurry up,    
       we can get it fixed.     

1357
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:55,355
 The suits,                     
 I came by and took them in.    
 They're all clean.             

1358
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:58,325
     Marshall, do you even know 
     where I've been all week?  

1359
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,830
       Mickey, listen.          

1360
01:25:02,832 --> 01:25:04,598
                          Talk. 

1361
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,401
 I'll pick up the suits.        
 You call a guy about the door. 

1362
01:25:07,403 --> 01:25:09,837
       All right.               
       I think I'll just let    
       you and Frank handle it. 

1363
01:25:09,839 --> 01:25:12,206
 What do you mean?              
 Frank? Mickey.                 

1364
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:14,541
 Roll down the window.          

1365
01:25:14,543 --> 01:25:16,176
 Just for one second.           

1366
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:50,210
             You all right?     

1367
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:51,912
      I'm fine.                 

1368
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:53,413
           You want a drink?    

1369
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:55,482
        Sure.                   

1370
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,653
 When'd you get back?           

1371
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:00,888
              I just walked in. 

1372
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:03,657
       Oh, you mean the flight. 

1373
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:07,194
     Did you stop and see       
     Bo on your way back?       

1374
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:10,497
                 Way back?      
                 No. Didn't     
                 have the time. 

1375
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,700
         There's been           
         a few problems         
         on that Grandview job. 

1376
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:15,736
           All the sod that     
           was supposed to be   
           in a month ago?      

1377
01:26:15,738 --> 01:26:18,872
       I come back, none of     
       the landscaping is done. 

1378
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:21,808
                  Unbelievable. 

1379
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:23,744
 Or would you                   
 rather talk about golf?        

1380
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:29,816
            You asked me why    
            I didn't see Bo.    
            I'm telling you.    

1381
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,887
 Did you pay them?              

1382
01:26:33,889 --> 01:26:35,889
 Didn't have to.                
 They backed off.               

1383
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:41,862
 When did they back off?        

1384
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:43,497
      When I wouldn't pay them. 

1385
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:50,938
                It was a bluff. 
                I called it.    
                That's all.     

1386
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:56,443
  What if they                  
  weren't bluffing?             

1387
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:57,778
                 But they were. 

1388
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:02,216
 (GLASS BREAKING)               

1389
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:03,483
                What the hell's 
                wrong with you? 

1390
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:07,254
 What if they                   
 weren't bluffing, Frank?       

1391
01:27:07,256 --> 01:27:09,389
      Okay, you're getting      
      a little hysterical here. 

1392
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,558
           I told them          
           right from the start 
           I wasn't gonna pay.  

1393
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,293
 Okay.                          
 Did you go to the police?      

1394
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:14,928
 No. I couldn't.                
 They said if I did...          

1395
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,530
 That's when they               
 threatened your life.          

1396
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:18,732
          But I thought they    
          were bluffing, honey. 

1397
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:21,368
 This isn't                     
 simple to explain.             

1398
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:23,837
                     Okay.      
 At first,                      
 I didn't do anything.          

1399
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:25,539
 And then I knew,               
 as soon as I talked            
 to them again,                 

1400
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:28,942
  I knew that                   
  they'd back off.              

1401
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:33,380
 And that there wasn't          
 really anything                
 serious to worry about.        

1402
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:36,283
 Other than, of course,         
 what you went through.         

1403
01:27:36,285 --> 01:27:38,919
 I imagine                      
 it was a pretty                
 frightening experience.        

1404
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:46,393
      You're not gonna tell me. 

1405
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:48,395
       But I know what you did, 
       you know what you did,   

1406
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:50,564
       and that's all that      
       matters, isn't it? So... 

1407
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,335
                  Isn't it?     

1408
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:03,510
 I got the divorce papers.      
 They were waiting              
 for me when I got home.        

1409
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:05,879
    Now, obviously they         
    were sent way before        

1410
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:07,981
            I knew anything     
            about a kidnapping. 

1411
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:13,620
        (EXHALES) Are you       
        gonna marry her?        

1412
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:17,457
 Listen, instead of             
 discussing what                
 I feel is personal,            

1413
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,526
           I think it was Henry 
           Kissinger that said, 

1414
01:28:19,528 --> 01:28:21,662
   "Never complain.             
   Never explain."              

1415
01:28:21,664 --> 01:28:22,929
 (SCOFFS)                       

1416
01:28:22,931 --> 01:28:26,033
      That was Henry Ford,      

1417
01:28:26,035 --> 01:28:29,403
     when he was                
     arrested for drunk         
     driving in California      

1418
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:30,837
              with another      
              woman in his car. 

1419
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:36,076
                     So...      

1420
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:40,047
             What do I get?     
             What's my part     
             of the settlement? 

1421
01:28:40,049 --> 01:28:42,582
 Well, we sell the house,       
 split the equity.              

1422
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:46,053
 It's about 200,000,            
 plus alimony, child support.   

1423
01:28:46,055 --> 01:28:50,657
     And then we divide the     
     money you're sneaking into 
     the Freeport account?      

1424
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,759
 There is no Freeport           
 bank account in my name        

1425
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:55,862
 and there is no possible       
 way anyone can prove it.       

1426
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:58,498
 You want to look in my books?  

1427
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,334
                       Mmm-mmm. 

1428
01:29:00,336 --> 01:29:04,037
    No, but I would like to see 
    your apartment buildings.   

1429
01:29:04,039 --> 01:29:09,409
    Your refrigerators, ranges, 
    all of your appliances.     

1430
01:29:09,411 --> 01:29:11,812
           How you save money   
           on stolen materials. 

1431
01:29:11,814 --> 01:29:13,914
 How do you know about that?    

1432
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:18,352
           And how you pay      
           your old buddy Ray   
           Shelby to front you. 

1433
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:20,087
   And without even             
   getting into the kidnapping, 

1434
01:29:20,089 --> 01:29:22,856
        I could stir up enough  
        to just nail your ass.  

1435
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:24,558
 Look, I don't know             
 what you think you know.       

1436
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,826
                    Couldn't I? 

1437
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,529
            I mean, if I was    
            the type of person  

1438
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,064
           that wanted to       
           see you go to jail.  

1439
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:36,937
                         Frank. 

1440
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,004
            What?               

1441
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:42,075
         Are you gonna marry... 
         What's her name?       

1442
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:45,679
      I hope to.                

1443
01:29:45,681 --> 01:29:46,847
           You mean if you      
           don't go to jail.    

1444
01:29:46,849 --> 01:29:48,815
 No, that's not what I meant.   

1445
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,686
             Oh, we're          
             just wasting time. 

1446
01:29:52,688 --> 01:29:54,588
                Let's wait till 
                I get a lawyer. 

1447
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:56,857
          Fine.                 

1448
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:59,459
   But before you get           
   an expensive divorce lawyer, 

1449
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:01,528
 just know it comes             
 out of the settlement.         

1450
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,697
  Just so much in               
  the kitty, kitty.             

1451
01:30:03,699 --> 01:30:05,031
               Watch it.        

1452
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,568
 Can I ask you a question?      

1453
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,936
          Yeah, sure. Go ahead. 

1454
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,540
          Did they              

1455
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,478
 take advantage of you or...    

1456
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:23,750
                 Mmm-mmm.       

1457
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,653
 Something happened to you.     

1458
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,790
           You're different.    

1459
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:35,595
                    Hey.        

1460
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:39,933
 Finally changed your           
 clothes. You look nice.        

1461
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:43,170
 Fancy pants.                   

1462
01:30:43,172 --> 01:30:45,639
  These are my culottes.        

1463
01:30:45,641 --> 01:30:48,208
 Well, they're pretty cool.     
                     (CHUCKLES) 

1464
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:49,910
 And no bra?                    

1465
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:51,945
       I have one on.           

1466
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:53,113
      I have more than one bra. 

1467
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,151
            Anyway, I gotta     
            tell you somethin'. 

1468
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:02,055
               Hear that?       
 What?                          

1469
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:05,225
  "I gotta tell you             
  somethin'." I sound like you. 

1470
01:31:05,227 --> 01:31:08,128
    I say that?                 
                     (CHUCKLES) 

1471
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,530
    Anyway,                     
    what I was gonna say was,   
    I didn't come for this bra. 

1472
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:14,868
   I just... I needed somebody  
   to talk to, and, you know... 

1473
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:16,770
       Is it all right that     
       I just invited myself?   

1474
01:31:16,772 --> 01:31:19,673
 Yeah, sure.                    
 Sure, it is,                   
 but there's one problem.       

1475
01:31:19,675 --> 01:31:22,609
          See, I was trying     
          to talk to my husband 
          finally and...        

1476
01:31:22,611 --> 01:31:24,211
           Wait. What problem?  

1477
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,915
            Oh, Ordell is back. 
            I know that.        

1478
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:31,084
 Yeah, but he's not alone.      

1479
01:31:31,086 --> 01:31:32,719
       (MELANIE LAUGHING)       

1480
01:31:32,721 --> 01:31:34,688
     ORDELL: They               
     expressing themselves.     

1481
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:43,830
           MELANIE:<i> Enchantee.</i>  

1482
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:48,235
                 Hello, Mickey. 

1483
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:51,738
      Ordell.                   

1484
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:55,008
                    Oh, please. 

1485
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:59,746
 Make yourself comfortable.     
 Have a seat.                   

1486
01:31:59,748 --> 01:32:01,748
   I just was in                
   the neighborhood,            

1487
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:05,018
 thought I'd stop by,           
 say hi to the old gang.        

1488
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:09,089
 Oh, no, we ain't               
 no gang. We just,              
 you know, some folks.          

1489
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:12,592
          Uh.                   

1490
01:32:12,594 --> 01:32:15,762
          Mickey, meet Melanie. 
          Melanie, Mickey.      

1491
01:32:15,764 --> 01:32:16,863
                      Hi.       

1492
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:19,266
        Hi.                     

1493
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:23,737
 ORDELL: How's Frank?           

1494
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:24,938
 Frank's great.                 

1495
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:29,543
              Guys, what's      
              going on? Mickey? 

1496
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:33,947
                   Louis, who's 
                   your friend? 

1497
01:32:33,949 --> 01:32:37,083
 I thought you two              
 were introduced.               
 Melanie, Mickey.               

1498
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,186
                    Bullshit.   

1499
01:32:40,188 --> 01:32:42,289
 Mickey says her old            
 man's divorcing her.           

1500
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:46,092
        Really?                 

1501
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:47,127
                   MICKEY: Mmm. 

1502
01:32:48,796 --> 01:32:51,064
 And I don't want to            
 interfere with his new life.   

1503
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:52,566
 Mine, either.                  

1504
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:55,335
              This is the part  
              where I say what? 

1505
01:32:56,971 --> 01:32:58,238
 What, you don't believe me?    

1506
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,107
                MELANIE: Uh-uh. 

1507
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:03,176
 Do you want me to              
 describe the apartment         
 in Freeport?                   

1508
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:04,644
           Ordell's been there. 

1509
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:07,781
     All right.                 

1510
01:33:07,783 --> 01:33:12,085
 Well, how about the            
 birthmark two inches from      
 the base of his spine?         

1511
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:14,854
 Assuming, of course,           
 that you've been there.        

1512
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:19,125
           I gotta take a leak. 

1513
01:33:19,127 --> 01:33:20,226
 Just sit still. Sit still.     

1514
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:26,633
                  Hold on. Hmm. 

1515
01:33:26,635 --> 01:33:30,670
   Now the woman said           
   that the man is              
   gonna divorce her.           

1516
01:33:30,672 --> 01:33:33,273
 He's not coming back.          
 He don't want to               
 make a new start.              

1517
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:35,609
    Mmm-mmm.                    
 ORDELL: Hmm.                   

1518
01:33:35,611 --> 01:33:37,811
             So I got it wrong, 
             baby. I mean,      

1519
01:33:37,813 --> 01:33:40,947
     I can't help if he         
     tells her one thing        
     and then tells me another. 

1520
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:42,749
 Or if she's pissed.            

1521
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:45,218
 Are you mad at anybody?        

1522
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,855
     No, not at all.            

1523
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:53,860
     No, she's not mad.         

1524
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:56,363
       This is bullshit.        
       Would you mind terribly? 

1525
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:03,903
                   MICKEY: Hmm. 

1526
01:34:03,905 --> 01:34:07,807
      There she goes,           
      future Mrs. Dawson.       

1527
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,976
               She looks like   
               a million bucks. 

1528
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:21,955
        Did he tell you he      
        was gonna marry her?    

1529
01:34:21,957 --> 01:34:24,357
      Mmm-hmm.                  

1530
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:26,359
           And live with        
           her until he does.   

1531
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,197
                Hmm.            

1532
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:33,266
        Hmm!                    

1533
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,305
                 (FLUSHING)     

1534
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,744
       MELANIE: You know, guys, 
       I was thinking we        
       should call Frank        

1535
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:46,312
 and then we'd all be together. 

1536
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:49,115
                  ORDELL: Yeah. 

1537
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:51,451
 Sure.                          

1538
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:55,855
              Let's call        
              the motherfucker.
