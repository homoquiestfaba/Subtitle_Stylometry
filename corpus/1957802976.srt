00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:31,596
When I was 15 years old,

2
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,090
I was forced to go
to summer camp.

3
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,237
But not just any summer camp.

4
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:39,873
It all started when I had to move in
with my relatives that I hardly knew.

5
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:43,304
Life was different
with Aunt Sharon and Uncle John.

6
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:45,175
Very different.

7
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:47,029
They were the happiest people
I'd ever met,

8
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:51,625
which is kind of a lot to deal with when
you're trying to put your life back together.

9
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:53,749
♪ There is power ♪

10
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:57,666
♪ In the precious part
of the land ♪

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,440
- That's harmony.
- That was good, honey.

12
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:04,063
All I wanted to do that summer was
sit around and feel sorry for myself.

13
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,215
But they had other plans for me.

14
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,592
Plans that would
ultimately change my life.

15
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:14,683
I used to be depressed
all the time.

16
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,598
All the time.

17
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:19,557
But then pastor Chip told me
all I needed to do

18
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,448
was spend more time
with my Christian friends,

19
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:22,865

got a surprise for you.

Well done, Uncle John.

31
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:57,465
Well, we got down with our bad
selves on that one, didn't we?

32
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,770
Aren't you so excited, Ian?

33
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,384
Camp is such a swell place,
and everyone you meet there

34
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,951
goes to the same school
that you will.

35
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,780
And it's a phenomenal place to
get a leg up on friend making.

36
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,390
- Phenomenal!
- Mm-hmm.

to conclusions, pal.

38

a chance to play good Samaritan.

00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:30,454
- Well, hello, there.
- Praise the Lord.

42
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,891
You have no idea how infrequent
traffic is out here.

43
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:36,112
I can tell by that outfit that
you're heading to Camp Manna.

44
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:38,486
Yeah, my truck broke down.
I've been waiting for a ride.

45
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,465
Well, blow the trumpet in Zion.

77

00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:38,202
That's nice. Out! Let's go.

172
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:46,253
Welcome to Camp Manna.

173
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:51,606
William, wait up.

174
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:59,460
- When did you get a brother, Greg?
- Uh, he... he's new.

175
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:01,530
He's adopted.
We just got him from Africa.

176
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:02,531
You know, I don't even know
how to talk to him.

177
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,011
He doesn't speak English.

178
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:07,187
No, thank you.

179
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,627
And I said "Hey, Basil, why
don't you lose those track shoes"

180
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,977
and we'll see you try
to run a 400 meter dash?"

181
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,461
It's a classic, it's a classic.

182
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,343
- Sorry about that, bro. Oh...
- Todd.

183
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:40,315
- Come on, we're supposed to forgive one another, right?
- Are you joking?

184
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,182
I'm not supposed to do anything,
because I'm not one of you.

185
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:47,141
- Wait, you're not a...
- No, I'm not.

186
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:50,927
A lost soul.

187
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:00,414
He's an angry one.

188
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,506
A nonbeliever at camp
and this is how you embrace him?

189
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,246
Whoa!

190
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:08,963
Where do you think you're going?

191
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:11,381
I should talk to him.

192
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,038
If you catch my drift.

193
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,738
- When did you get the 17th?
- This morning.

194
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,610
There's a tattoo artist
at Camp Manna.

195
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,308
This doesn't
concern you, Clayton.

196
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,658
Oh, it concerns me, Brad.

197
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,444
It concerns me big time.
I'm extremely concerned.

198
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,498
I happen to know
that influencing young minds...

199
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:34,405
isn't exactly
one of your talents.

200
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,557
I mean, look who they put you
in charge of every year.

201
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,627
International kickball rejects.

202
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,237
Unlike your talents, Clayton.

203
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:42,239
You know, eyebrow movement,

204
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,198
singing "Jesus Loves Me"
in karaoke,

205
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:45,765
wearing sunglasses inside.

206
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:46,939
Gordo.

207
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,204
What are you implying,
Glutton-town?

208
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,339
Guys!

209
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:00,040
Capture the cross!

210
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,303
Yay! Come home with it, baby.

211
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:25,374
Head up to Outlook
if you want that cross, buddy.

212
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,484
What's up, brother?

213
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,230
I wouldn't go that way
if I were you.

214
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:58,749
Nothing for 40 miles.

215
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,492
We're in the middle
of nowhere, man.

216
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,786
It's too bad you're leaving.

217
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:05,258
I could use
a guy like you and the Regiment.

218
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,648
The cabin that tripped me
on my face in front of everyone?

219
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,372
Oh, come on, man.
Todd was just messing around,

220
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,504
having a good time,
doing what guys do.

221
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,118
His name is Todd,
what do you expect?

222
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:16,637
Nothing personal.

223
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,098
This place might look and feel a lot different
to you, but it's the same old stuff.

224
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:23,644
Survival of the fittest.

225
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,420
And it's pretty good
when you're the man.

226
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,127
Like me.

227
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:29,563
I'm the man.

228
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:36,657
I guess I'll never know.

229
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,750
Ian, this place sucks because
you're stuck with Bradley, okay?

230
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:45,164
The dude is a total goober. Seriously. He
just... just sautés in goob sauce all day.

231
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:50,411
Look, stick around, man, and I promise I
will find a way to get you into my cabin

232
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:53,501
and I... and I will make this
whole experience for you amazing.

233
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:02,553
Is that guy bothering you?

234
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:04,860
Do you need a ride?

235
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,211
We're all right.

236
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,299
Thanks, though.

237
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,658
Let me work my magic, man.

238
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:22,269
I'm gonna look after you.

239
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,184
And just remember that with me,

240
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,358
all things are possible.

241
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,169
It's going to be all right, kid.

242
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,630
I like you.

243
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,330
I didn't think I did, but I do.

244
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:48,685
Ian!

245
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:51,906
Ian.

246
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:56,868
I've been looking
all over for you.

247
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:59,523
- Where have you been?
- I needed some air.

248
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:04,073
Well, I just want you to know
that I'm glad you're here.

249
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,183
You know,
we're not as crazy as you think.

250
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,448
I don't know, back home,
Christians killed me once.

251
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:13,624
Oh, I bet. Our love can
be smothering at times.

252
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,760
Attention, campus.

253
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,154
The fun never ends
at Camp Manna.

254
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:23,460
Please, assemble
over at Hallelujah Hall.

255
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:25,941
Our God-fearing leader
has a special announcement

256
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:29,162
about an opportunity
for one lucky counselor.

257
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:31,555
Cujo! Cujo! Cujo!

258
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:32,817
Stop!

259
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,212
May I have
your attention, please?

260
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:37,648
I wanna share this with you.

261
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:42,740
My name is Jack Cujo Parrish.

262
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:45,004
And in 1968,

263
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:48,529
I was wading
through rice patties

264
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:51,184
in a communist country
called Vietnam.

265
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:54,361
That's Cujo. He's my spiritual
leader, just like I'm yours.

266
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,189
I caught a hollow point bullet
in my neck.

267
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:02,195
And my neck exploded like a
Roman candle on 4th of July.

268
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:04,284
- And I was dead.
- I love this story.

269
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,851
And then,
I was taken by some guides,

270
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:12,553
I call angels, to a place
in the spiritual realm,

271
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:14,847
and they're glowing and
they're floating all around me,

272
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:19,777
and this light on my left side was
mother of pearl and abalone colored,

273
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:23,390
and out of that light
came an androgynous voice

274
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,826
that spoke to me in thought.

275
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:28,351
And that voice said,

276
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:30,919
"You need to look for help
in the spiritual realm."

277
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,529
Amen.

278
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,401
And that's what I've been doing.

279
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:37,665
And when I came back to life,
I created what's called...

280
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:39,971
the God Games.

281
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,803
- The what games?
- It's a bunch of holy games

282
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,457
that we play
against the other cabins.

283
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,511
It develops leadership,
strength. Shush, listen.

284
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:53,159
The final event will be
the three leading cabins.

285
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:57,206
And they'll compete
in a winner-take-all event.

286
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:01,515
When your cabin
is crowned victorious,

287
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:03,516
you will be the winner...

288
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,521
of the Purple Cross.

289
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:10,784
I've never won that.

290
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:12,787
And this year's Purple Cross

291
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,789
is more important than ever.

292
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:17,705
This year, the counselor
who leads his cabin to victory

293
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:20,838
will receive a two year scholarship
to Mount Zion University.

294
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:26,801
- I know many of you already attend Mount Zion University.
- Yes, I do.

295
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,108
- But a two year scholarship means no tuition.
- -Oh!

296
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,981
And for those of you
who don't attend,

297
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,461
this will change your life.

298
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,333
I'd like to welcome you to...

299
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:39,379
Camp Manna!

308
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:13,456
Greetings. Welcome to Clayton's
Video Journal. Morning one.

309
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:18,113
Since I got this sweet
VHS camera for Christmas,

310
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,855
I thought I'd document
my time here at Camp Manna.

311
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,029
Where I actually matter.

312
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:25,338
This year, you'll be able
to witness my journey

313
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:27,272
towards winning
the Purple Cross scholarship.

314
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,344
Also, there's a new kid at camp
this year in need of some grace.

315
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:33,955
I told him I'd get him
into my cabin and when I do,

316
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,828
number 18 is on the horizon.

317
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,528
Grace and peace. Clayton out.

318
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,057
Rise and shine, campers.

319
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:52,551
Counselor Matthew here, reminding you that
the God Games should not be taken lightly.

320
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,889
They're here to
embed in biblical knowledge

321
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:57,065
and apocalyptic survival skills.

322
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,679
They will challenge
you physically...

323
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:01,809
develop mentally
and spiritually.

324
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,810
Camp glory awaits.

325
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:06,161
If I were you,
I'd start training...

326
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,729
now.

327
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:29,010
Alright, pick up those knees.
Doing good.

328
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,584
No ankle turns
before the God Games.

329
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:35,190
- Is he serious?
- I think my heart is shutting down.

330
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,323
It's beating
really weird, Bradley.

331
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,325
That's the love of Jesus.

332
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:43,329
- Why are we running?
- The God Games start tomorrow,

333
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,829
and years of yore have taught me they
favor the more physically advanced.

334
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,573
Years of yore have taught me
we blow chunks.

335
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:52,468
You have a day to get rid of a
lifetime of Moon Pie and Nutty Butter.

336
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,036
Well, there's an eating contest.

337
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,907
He's right. This running...

338
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,433
we can't run away
from ourselves.

339
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:02,130
I'll admit, young William,

340
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,482
last year's God Games
did have their challenges.

341
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,837
Remember to paddle together.

342
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,034
Need any advice, man?

343
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:40,689
About paddling.

344
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:44,172
I founded
the Mount Zion kayak team.

345
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,566
I made these shirts.

346
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,701
Alright, disciples, let's go.
Let's hurry up.

347
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:55,836
We'll rise up on wings,
like eagles.

348
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,533
We shall paddle
and not grow faint.

349
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,671
- ♪ Row, row, row ♪ -
Really gotta dig in, guys.

350
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,108
Row!

351
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,892
You know, um, Ian,

352
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,677
I've been thinking
about something.

353
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:13,549
Why... why aren't you
a Christian?

354
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,076
- What do you mean?
- Aren't there Christians in Florida?

355
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,250
Yeah, tons of them.

356
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,731
They're all lunatics.

357
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,433
Well, you know, you might regret
those words come judgment day.

358
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:31,480
Oh, come on! I can't be the only one
who hasn't bought into this crap.

359
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:33,937
Of course you are. You're the
only one from Florida, ain't you?

360
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:35,005
What about Mo?

361
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:36,355
How dare you?

362
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:38,313
That's my African brother
in Christ.

363
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,837
- Uh?
- How did you... what?

364
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:43,971
- And you, Gordo?
- I said the prayer.

365
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:46,465
- I've been baptized, I'm as pure as a dove, Ian.
- -Gordo.

366
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:49,063
A better example
for Jesus, please.

367
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:52,109
- Hey! Like this?
- Knock it off!

368
00:22:52,283 --> 00:22:53,894
Gordo, don't make me
turn this around.

369
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:55,852
Stop it!

370
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:09,692
Get off of there,
or I'll push you in.

371
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,608
What's your problem?

372
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,485
You guys okay?

373
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:27,536
Gordo, what were you thinking?
I told you to stop,

374
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,710
and I am your leader,
and you need to listen to me.

375
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,149
- I... What?
- I can't even look at you right now.

376
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,119
Dude needs to meditate.

377
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,732
I hope you're referring to a
Christian meditation, Gordo?

378
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:54,911
- Sure, Greg. Totally.
- Alright. Alright.

379
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:00,613
Attention, campers.

380
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:03,398
Cujo has a special demonstration
on this year's final

381
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:06,270
winner-take-all God Game event.

382
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,535
Everyone, congregate at the Lake of
Galilee for this special occasion.

383
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:12,189
- Blonde chicks will never date an Asian kid.
- You think so?

384
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,403
It's too much of an educational
gap for an American.

385
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:18,935
- Oh my gosh!
- What?

386
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:37,387
You're all here...

387
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:41,784
because simple minds
need to see a demonstration.

388
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,223
I'll present to you
the final God Game.

389
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:49,009
The Leap of Faith.

390
00:24:58,801 --> 00:24:59,801
Oorah.

391
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:10,726
Are you ready?

392
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,165
Leap of faith, let it happen.

393
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:27,830
Oh!

394
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:30,267
Wow!

395
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,538
Every cabin has an anchor, and
every cabin mate is an anchor.

396
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:42,845
But the most special anchor
you've got is invisible,

397
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:44,019
his name is Jesus...

398
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,416
What's up, brother?

399
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:51,854
- Did you see that?
- What?

400
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:54,117
I... I'm pretty sure
that guy just died.

401
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,379
Yep. Looks like it.

402
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:59,122
Good thing
his soul is right there.

403
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,907
How're you so chill about this?

404
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,300
I'm a chill dude. Listen up.

405
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:05,554
We're gonna have to fast track
you into the Regiment.

406
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:09,002
- It's not done yet? You said you were handling it.
- Hey.

407
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:11,395
Ian, these things,
they take time, okay?

408
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,485
I need you to work with me here, okay?
We're on the same team, buddy.

409
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,100
Can you meet me tonight
at the coast?

410
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,620
- What for?
- Yo! Beefcake.

411
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:24,539
- Sharing some bro wisdom?
- Cool it, Cheese Puff. We're just talking.

412
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,313
About how you live at home
with your mom?

413
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:30,371
Wow, real low. My mom has MS.

414
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:33,156
- I stay at home, so she can live with dignity.
- -Oh!

415
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,308
Oh, I thought it was because you
weren't making your rent

416
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,972
working night shifts
at the Nut Butter f...

417
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:38,117
Hey, what your mouth!

418
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:43,863
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

419
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,908
What did you say?
Say it again!

420
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:48,389
Fight! Fight! Fight!

421
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:51,740
Relax, Manny! He's with us.

422
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:56,397
Please, watch...

423
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:02,141
Hey! Get off of him.

424
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:06,294
This is not a camp for fighting.

425
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:09,845
This is a camp to learn
how to be a better yourself.

426
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,300
You don't want to feel my wrath,

427
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,285
when I take you on
in my own way.

428
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,199
Do you hear me?

429
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:19,158
Do you hear me?

430
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,162
You guys go
to the sweatbox right now.

431
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:25,513
Hey!
Go to the sweatbox right now.

432
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:43,270
I've got
some serious duck butter.

433
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,230
Will you, please,
stop doing that?

434
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:49,484
It smells like Burger King
onions and hot mayonnaise.

435
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:54,890
You know, legally, I bet you
Cujo can't even keep us in here.

436
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,264
Yeah, what's up with that guy?

437
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,329
He's insane.

438
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:02,855
Yeah, the war, you know.

439
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,207
He got his face all jacked up
from an RPG

440
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,209
that blew out of the train
he was deucing in.

441
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:13,254
Yeah, it drove him nuts,
it shook his brain around.

442
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:14,343
It's true.

443
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,740
He went on a killing spree

444
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:22,309
and the good Lord
might forgive...

445
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:27,575
but the ghosts don't.
They haunt these cabins.

446
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,752
And at night, if you're quiet,

447
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:34,234
you can hear them scream.

448
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,106
Happity hey, disciples.

449
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:40,501
What're you doing?

450
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:42,677
I heard about what happened.

451
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,814
I wanted to apologize for yelling
at you guys down at the lake.

452
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,903
I'm sorry.
Now that we're all together,

453
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,557
it's a perfect time
for Devotions.

454
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,812
Who knows a good genealogy?

455
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,474
My favorite is
from the book of Ruth.

456
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:59,433
Uh, this is the line of David.

457
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:03,045
David, who would
eventually be the one

458
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,265
who was the line
in the seat of Jesus,

459
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,267
who died for your soul, Ian.

460
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:14,578
And Perez beget Hezron.
And Hezron beget Ram.

461
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:19,627
And Ram beget Ab... Ab... Abina...

462
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,195
Abinam... minadab?

463
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:32,509
- Boo!
- Oh!

464
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:34,076
Oh, what's happening, brother?

465
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:37,863
Reading. Devotions.

466
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:39,560
You into, uh,
Song of Solomon yet?

467
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:41,334
There's some great stuff
in Chapter four.

468
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:43,606
What do you want?

469
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,308
Listen, I was talking
to God the other night

470
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:51,702
and he and I both agreed
that it might be best

471
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:53,835
for Ian if we did a little...

472
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:58,361
- a little...
- I s... I see what you're doing.

473
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:03,366
- You want him for his size, for th... for the Leap of Faith!
- Oh!

474
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,761
You think...

475
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:10,373
- You...
- I'm... You thin... I'm offended!

476
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,376
- I am offended, you think I'm that shallow.
- Yes, I do.

477
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,204
Look, I'll trade you Jerry.
Jerry for Ian.

478
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:18,817
- No.
- Jerry and Todd...

479
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:21,602
- Stop. No. Just stop it! -...for Ian.
No? That's a great deal.

480
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:24,537
- I wouldn't have even said yes if you had accepted that deal.
- Cujo...

481
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:27,260
- Trade...
- Stop! Stop.

482
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:33,266
Clearly Cujo made a mistake
putting him in your cabin,

483
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,572
the kid isn't
connecting with you.

484
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:37,748
I'm just saying,
a change of venue,

485
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,576
maybe some fresh faces
around him,

486
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,143
might open him up a little bit.

487
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:44,775
- Oh, wait, I see what you're...
- Are you running away?

488
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,192
I know what you're doing,
Clayton.

489
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:48,455
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I can break through to him

490
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:51,937
and that boy belongs to me an...
And so does that scholarship.

491
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,590
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you pray about it

492
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,164
- at the prayer fire?
- Maybe I will!

493
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:18,398
Change of plan. So, I was
gonna talk to the Brad Hatter

494
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:20,400
solo style earlier,

495
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:21,899
but I think we should do it
together, you and me.

496
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,533
Do what together?

497
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:25,387
Tell him you wanna be
in my cabin, not his.

498
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,234
Don't you think
that will hurt his feelings?

499
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:30,208
Nah, once he realizes
how much more you'll get

500
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:32,486
out of this week under my wing,
he'll be all about it.

501
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:35,981
I think it might be better
if I'm not involved.

502
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:37,915
Come on, you don't wanna be
stuck with those guys

503
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,245
all year at school, do you?

504
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,247
They're like ticks,
you gotta flick them off

505
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:43,075
before they embed
and never let go.

506
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:46,382
Let's go. A little pep
in your step, come on.

507
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:47,925
We don't have all night.
Don't have all day.

508
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:48,949
Don't have all day here.

509
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,346
Stupid Clayton.

510
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:56,174
He's probably right.

511
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,786
I mean, I... I doubt,
sometimes I do,

512
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
I have doubts.

513
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:02,877
Sometimes I have
my doubts, you know.

514
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:07,142
Let's turn to the Word.

515
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:15,455
Lamentations III.

516
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:19,807
"I have become the laughingstock
of all my people."

517
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:23,592
Oh, come on!

518
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,248
All week, I've been laughed at,

519
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:29,643
I've been mocked, and now you?
You wanna take part?

520
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:30,817
I'm here every year.

521
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:35,475
And every year I get put with the
most unathletic bunch of losers

522
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,043
in the camp, every year.

523
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:40,306
That's my cabin.
Okay, I'll go one more time,

524
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
I'll go one more time.

525
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,921
"The fool says in his heart,
'There is no God.'"

526
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,837
Maybe you shouldn't film this.

527
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,771
No, we're buds,
we'll laugh about this later.

528
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:56,452
And then Cujo...
don't get me started on Cujo.

529
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,889
I don't know,
maybe Cujo is as crazy...

530
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,867
- You know, on second thought...
- as they say after all.

531
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:02,531
Maybe we should
just talk to him tomorrow.

532
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,143
I wouldn't tell anyone
about this, though.

533
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:07,594
You know, for...
For Bradley's sake, of course.

534
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,469
I mean, he puts a non-saint
sinner in my cabin,

535
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:15,689
I have no idea
how to deal with him. None.

536
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:16,864
None whatsoever.

537
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:17,865
I don't know how to tell him

538
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,954
that he's special,

539
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,609
and he's important,
and he's worthy.

540
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:25,003
I'll tell you who does...

541
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:44,022
I... I don't... I don't mean that.

542
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:48,133
Sometimes you just got to get
it off your chest, you know.

543
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,332
My hope is in you, Lord.

544
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:52,812
Use me, Lord.

545
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Am I not a tool?

546
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:58,340
Just have to hear you speak.

547
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:02,517
Hello?

548
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:07,871
I can wait.

549
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:09,786
I got all night.

550
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:46,996
Praise the Lord.

551
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,568
- Yeah.
- Feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat.

552
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:53,742
Woo!

553
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:55,527
Cujo!

554
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:01,055
Cujo! Cujo! Cujo!
Cujo! Cujo! Cujo!

555
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:03,840
Music is the highest
art form of them all.

556
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,451
And it comes right from heaven.

557
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:07,408
You hear me?

558
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:12,110
♪ I see you there

Disciples, wake up!

562
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,376
We're late for the God Games!

563
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:35,220
We have overslept.

564
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,658
Gordo, Ian, Greg!

565
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:40,094
- Mo. Mo, are you awake?
- Mo!

566
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:44,272
This can still be the day
that the Lord has made.

567

Okay, the reason we're here,

572
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:06,294
this is the beginning of a brand
new part of your life.

573
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:09,906
And the people
who soar the highest,

574
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,082
we'll be the championships,

575
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,457
because we're learning how to be
the truth of ourselves.

576
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:17,958
We're learning the truth
of ourselves here, kids.

577
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,482
- Come on!
- On that note, ready?

578
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:23,311
Yeah!

579
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:30,362
Let the God Games begin!

580
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,540
Oh, praise the Lord!

00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:51,992
♪ Let the God Games begin! ♪

582
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:58,564
Attention, campers.

583
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:03,090
Today is Camp Manna's
greatest tradition.

584
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,469
You all know what's at stake.

585
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,705
Compete your way
to the top three cabins

586
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,881
and you will punch a ticket
to the Leap of Faith.

587
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:14,232
Compete like men today,

588
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:18,192
because the Lord Jesus
is watching...

589
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:20,715
and so am I.

590
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:24,416
Keep your head up and move fast,
all right?

591
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:29,637
Yeah, man, let's do this.

592
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:34,904
The mud race begins

593
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:37,690
in three, two, one.

594
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,111
- Come on!
- -Throw off the plan, let's win!

595
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,267
Lean on, let's go!

596
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:50,919
Come on!

597
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,227
Yeah, let's go!

598
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,229
Come on, yeah!

599
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:58,406
Go, come on!

600
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,673
And the Righteous Regiment
take the first game.

601
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:08,068
So, one game on the books

602
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:09,642
and it's pretty much
like last year.

603
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:11,897
Regimen on the top,

604
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:14,182
and the Privates on the bottom.

605
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:25,477
The key to Jesus golf
is patience.

606
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,266
Did you see that, Ian?

607
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:38,533
In a much aligned way,
God love's a real hole in one

608
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:39,795
for our own lives.

609
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:41,014
Four!

610
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,974
Who the H did that?

611
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:46,846
Sorry, bro, stray ball.

612
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,414
Stray ball?
I'll show you a stray ball.

613
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,068
- Hole in one.
- Turn the other cheek.

614
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:54,275
Would you talk like that
if Jesus were here right now?

615
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:58,074
♪ Because the fruit
of the spirit ♪

616
00:38:58,248 --> 00:38:59,337
♪ Is love, joy, peace ♪

617
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,123
♪ Patience
kindness and good... ♪

618
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:15,744
- Oh, my cornea!
- William!

619
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:24,797
Ancient of days

620
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:27,277
and after healing
our brother William,

621
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:28,652
h... he will restore his sight.

622
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,021
Pick those heads up,
there's still time

623
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:33,195
to climb the leaderboard.

624
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:42,380
Todd, that is really good.

625
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:48,603
The Privates are looking
pretty pathetic.

626
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,172
But they do have
an ace in the hole

627
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:53,869
for this next competition.

628
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:57,264
You gotta stretch
that stomach out.

629
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,266
Jesus fed the 5,000.

630
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,720
I need you to eat for the 5,000.

631
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:04,073
Hope you like math class,
because it's time for some pie.

632
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:05,968
Assume the position.

633
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,939
All right.

634
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:22,328
Home cooking, right, guys?

635
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,042
You good?

636
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:43,396
Bradley.

637
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:06,403
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare puke, Jerry.

638
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:10,206
All good.

639
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,207
I need this.

640
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,381
I need this from you.

641
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:24,742
Gordo!

642
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:26,352
No!

643
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:35,014
We still have one more event

644
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:36,581
to get some momentum
for tomorrow.

645
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:38,886
Fishers of men.

646
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:42,369
Toss your life preserver
to your cabin mate

647
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,414
and fish him in 12 times.

648
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,852
That's one for each disciple.

649
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:52,031
Three, two, one.

650
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,860
Let's go, let's go!

651
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:58,556
- Let's do this, bro. Let's go.
- Okay.

652
00:41:58,603 --> 00:41:59,603
Help me, Ian!

653
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,784
I got it, Ian!

654
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:07,612
Pull it, pull... pull! I got it!

655
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,799
Hey, Mom.

656
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:27,327
I'm ready, Dad.

657
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,207
Ian! Ian, what's the problem?

658
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:39,774
- I can't swim!
- What?

659
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:42,734
You can't? God! You... okay.

660
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:44,948
Ian, calm down, I'm...
I'll be your Hasselhoff, okay?

661
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:50,916
Through God, all things
are possible, I mean...

662
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,352
Ian, where are you going?

663
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:23,034
Hey, Ian.

664
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:25,471
Where have you been?

665
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:28,717
No worries. It doesn't matter.

666
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:31,937
I guess we'll just have
to trust God now more than ever.

667
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:35,054
I hate to burst
your bubble Bradley,

668
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:36,482
but I've been dead once.

669
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:38,920
There's nothing but darkness.

670
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:46,319
Oh, dear.

671
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:51,629
Oh, dear.

672
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:05,488
Do you think the first thing
Clayton does when he gets home

673
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:08,167
is tell his mom
how awesome he is at God Games?

674
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:10,101
Well, she is
his only friend outside of camp.

675
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,003
Yeah, but we could learn
a thing or two from him.

676
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:17,631
I don't know how to explain
this to you, Ian,

677
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,439
but the dude is a bad person.

678
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,486
Evidenced by the fact
that he comes back

679
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,501
to this dump year
after year to be a counselor.

680
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:31,625
Not... not you, Bradley.

681
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:33,409
You're not like him.

682
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:35,760
Being a counselor is cool.

683
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:43,636
You're right.

684
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:46,552
I'm not like him.

685
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:50,122
I don't have his chiseled face,

686
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:52,377
have his alarming charisma.

687
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:55,388
I give my best
for the glory of the Lord

688
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:57,390
and yet everyone's like,
"Oh, Clayton!"

689
00:44:57,564 --> 00:44:59,000
You're the coolest ever.

690
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:01,046
Hey, I wanna be in your cabin

691
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,222
"because you always win...
the God Games!"

692
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:08,216
And why do they always win
the God Games?

693
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:11,491
I say... it...
It's a mental thing.

694
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:12,927
It's like a state of mind.

695
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:15,016
They think they're going to win

696
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,539
and therefore, they do.

697
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:20,369
Nope.

698
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:21,583
Just think about it, guys.

699
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:25,374
He strategizes, he get his guys
to work harder than anyone else.

700
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:27,548
And let's face it,
he's pretty freaking good at it.

701
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:33,208
So, that makes us underdogs.

702
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:34,906
What do we know about underdogs?

703
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,517
That they can win, but they...
They probably won't...

704
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:39,214
That's wrong. What?

705
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:45,438
It means that we might not have
a chance of winning this thing,

706
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:47,701
but we can show everyone

707
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:50,617
the Passover Privates aren't
going down without a fight.

708
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:52,967
Gird your loins, gentlemen.

709
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:56,101
It's time to fight
fire with fire.

710
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:03,325
Isaiah 40. "He gives
strength to the weary..."

711
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:05,023
and increases
the power of the week.

712
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:08,287
Even youths grow tired,
stumble, and fall,

713
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:09,917
but those who hope in the Lord
will renew their strength.

714
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:11,551
They will soar on wings
like eagles,

715
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:13,005
they will run
and not grow weary,

716
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,208
"they will walk
and not be faint."

717
00:46:17,557 --> 00:46:18,732
That ought to do it.

718
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:25,652
V-journal entry, day two.

719
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:27,001
So, yesterday...

720
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:29,797
yesterday was
a pretty good day.

721
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:32,485
Found out about
this Leap of Faith thing,

722
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:33,834
which seems pretty cool.

723
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:38,360
Gotta, like, launch...
Gotta, like, launch the guy.

724
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:40,374
That's why I need to get
Ian into the Regiment.

725
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:43,148
I could launch
the heck out of him.

726
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:45,280
I need a guy
that small on my team.

727
00:46:45,454 --> 00:46:47,282
And then I'll get
that scholarship,

728
00:46:47,456 --> 00:46:49,284
and finally get out
of my mom's basement.

729
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:52,897
And maybe get a friend
or two outside of camp.

730
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,830
'Cause that's
a big goal of mine.

731
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:03,908
Sons of Zion.

732
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,040
Shout for joy.

733
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:09,087
Today is the last chance
to secure a spot

734
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:10,621
in tomorrow morning
Leaps of Faith.

735
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:12,481
Who will climb the leaderboard

736
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:14,353
and take that coveted
third and final spot.

737
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:27,888
First step this morning,
the Ben Hur Chariot Race.

738
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:31,326
Make one big loop around and be
the first to cross the finish line.

739
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:37,767
The race begins
in three, two, one.

740
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:44,556
Here we go!

741
00:47:45,253 --> 00:47:46,253
Camp Manna!

742
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,912
Go! Go, we can pass them.

743
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:55,046
And just like that, the Regiment
are out to an early lead.

744
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,268
I'm gonna give it
some gas, William.

745
00:48:00,442 --> 00:48:02,183
Yeah, that's it!

746
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:06,013
- Get that, Regiment!
- Come on!

747
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,790
- Alright, we're directly ahead of them.
- Keep going.

748
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:11,497
Hold on tight, William!

749
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:17,068
They're gaining on us.

750
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,245
Keep going,
I can see the finish line.

751
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:28,470
- Yeah!
- Yes!

752
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:30,124
Woo!

753
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:33,127
There's a storm coming.

754
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:47,445
J-9.

755
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:50,188
Yes, I got them!

756
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:51,362
Yeah!

757
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:55,889
Do a little less, Todd.

758
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,543
But good stuff.

759
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:02,156
Next, S-40.

760
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,595
Jesus, bingo.

761
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:10,773
Jesus, bingo.

762
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:13,775
Hey!

763
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:16,736
Well, the Privates are looking

764
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:17,910
hard to beat today.

765
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:21,045
And up next, dodge your way
to the promised land.

766
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:25,136
If you're struggling
to locate this event,

767
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,748
simply follow all the campers
dressed like Moses.

768
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:30,880
You actually have
a shot today brobeans.

769
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:33,100
They say the last
shall be first, right?

770
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:34,928
The race across
the promised land

771
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:37,452
begins in three, two, one.

772
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:40,586
Later, broses.

773
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,414
His name was Moses.

774
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,070
Yeah, yeah!

775
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:51,814
Yeah, woohoo!

776
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,122
Not bad for Jesus.

777
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:00,431
Oh!

778
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:16,838
Hey, shark bus.

779
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,550
Didn't know this thing
was handicap accessible?

780
00:50:20,626 --> 00:50:21,888
No shield, guess you're done.

781
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:23,324
I got a job for you.

782
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:27,455
Whoa, what...
What are you doing? Oh my.

783
00:50:28,634 --> 00:50:29,678
Stop it!

784
00:50:29,852 --> 00:50:31,811
Stop it, man! Oh my!

785
00:50:31,985 --> 00:50:33,508
You're a psycho, man!

786
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:45,345
Woo! Thank you.

787
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,567
Don't look now,
but the Passover Privates

788
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:49,741
are on the moon.

789
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,483
And we still have one more event

790
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:53,354
to determine who moves on

791
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:54,703
to tomorrow's Leap of Faith.

792
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:00,709
Okay. My dearest brother,
you need to go down to the lake,

793
00:51:00,883 --> 00:51:04,713
get five stones and add them
to the pile on the stump, okay?

794
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:07,760
And you're going... you're going
to shoot them at the Goliath,

795
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:09,414
but do not...
You see Jerry over there?

796
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:11,155
Do not let him get a shot in.

797
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:13,853
You do not want him
shooting at it, okay? Just...

798
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:20,494
- Yeah, that definitely translated.
- Oh my.

799
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:23,428
- Go, Mo!
- You can do it, Mo!

800
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:25,169
Aim... aim low, Mo!

801
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:27,345
I really wish
I could speak African.

802
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,890
- Go, Mo!
- You can do it, Mo!

803
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:37,023
Go, Mo!

804
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:45,988
- Yeah!
- Yes!

805
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,555
Yes, Mo! Yes!

806
00:52:48,556 --> 00:52:49,688
You did it, Mo!

807
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:51,820
I am so glad we adopted you.

808
00:52:51,994 --> 00:52:53,474
Yes!

809
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:59,741
- Stupid!
- And the results are in.

810
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:02,744
In first place, we have
the Religious Right Rank.

811
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:05,094
Taking a surprise
and the slip to second

812
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,835
is the Righteous Regiment.

813
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:08,552
And taking the final
Leap of Faith spot,

814
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:10,796
we have the Passover Privates.

815
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,130
Not sure what kind of steroids
you pumped last night...

816
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,454
but congratulations.

817
00:53:26,594 --> 00:53:27,594
Thank you.

818
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:35,534
Alright,
impromptu journal entry.

819
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:39,781
There's something I have to do
that I need forgiveness for.

820
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:42,741
So, forgive me
for what's necessary,

821
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:45,874
but you know
I can reach way more lives

822
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:48,088
with that scholarship
than any other counselor here.

823
00:53:49,095 --> 00:53:50,095
Just saying.

824
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:52,924
Grace and peace.

825
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:54,970
Clayton out.

826
00:53:58,104 --> 00:54:01,020
Privates, I am so proud of you.

827
00:54:01,194 --> 00:54:03,034
It's... it's like a Christmas
miracle, you know,

828
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:04,719
with... without
the birth of a savior.

829
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:06,286
But still it's a miracle.

830
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,506
Perhaps this sudden
change of fortune

831
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,031
has something to do with a certain
person's leadership skills?

832
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:18,124
Okay. You're right. But, uh, I'd
like to take this precious moment,

833
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:19,604
if I might, to nominate Ian

834
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:24,261
as our Leap of Faith
participant.

835
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:27,535
We're gonna shoot you
into the sky.

836
00:54:28,874 --> 00:54:30,895
No, I think Mo should do it,
it's more about agility

837
00:54:30,919 --> 00:54:32,834
- than size anyways.
- Agility?

838
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:34,421
What are you talking about?
It's a weight ratio thing.

839
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:36,142
His people know
all about physics.

840
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:37,676
I will accept
that stereotype, yes.

841
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:39,319
Ian.

842
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,279
Now, I would never force you

843
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:44,629
to do anything
you didn't want to, okay?

844
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:48,502
But if you don't do this
right now,

845
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:51,331
I will be
very disappointed in you.

846
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:55,030
In fact, that reminds me of,
uh, Devotions.

847
00:54:55,204 --> 00:54:57,357
The other night, I was reading
about God's disappointment in Jonah

848
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,252
when he refused
to go to Nineveh.

849
00:54:59,426 --> 00:55:00,862
And, oh, my boy,
let me tell you,

850
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:03,125
it's a whale of a tale!

851
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,868
You don't want to be
doing anything

852
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:09,523
that would stop the Lords will...

853
00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:11,497
become the laughing stock
of all my people.

854
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:17,314
Every year, I get put with the
most unathletic bunch of losers.

855
00:55:17,488 --> 00:55:19,316
I don't have any idea
what I'm doing.

856
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,057
You know who does?
Clayton. He knows everything.

857
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:23,798
The answers aren't in here.

858
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:25,844
Can you hear me? Hello?

859
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:28,455
There is no God!

860
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:34,548
And don't get me started
about Cujo, the whack job.

861
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:37,029
He did do all that shooting
and pillaging, he's...

862
00:55:37,203 --> 00:55:38,643
Bradley Sommers.
Report to my office.

863
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:42,687
I think that he's gonna be
the first in line

864
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:44,689
when it comes to the River Styx

865
00:55:44,863 --> 00:55:46,865
and getting in the boat
and riding to Hades.

866
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:50,042
Praying for you, brother.

867
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,877
What was that?

868
00:55:59,051 --> 00:56:00,226
Your doubts about faith

869
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,662
broadcast for the camp to see?

870
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:04,273
We keep those private.

871
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,319
Sir, it's... it's not
what it looks like, I...

872
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:08,669
No! What it looks like
is you brought

873
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:10,243
a whole lot of shame
over this camp.

874
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:15,110
Over yourself
and over your personal savior.

875
00:56:15,284 --> 00:56:16,677
That's what it looks like.

876
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:18,766
I told you to come to me
if you needed advice.

877
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:22,379
What are you gonna do
about all this?

878
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:26,078
Go back there and try to be
a leader, or tuck tail and run?

879
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:30,561
All right.
What's going on here, Ian?

880
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:33,912
If that's even your real name.

881
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:37,306
I don't know. Bradley is not
who he says he is, I guess.

882
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,918
Say something.
Huh? You think I'm stupid?

883
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:41,252
Okay, I knew about the video.

884
00:56:44,096 --> 00:56:46,533
Ian, I thought that... I kind
of thought we were friends.

885
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:48,361
Friends?

886
00:56:49,797 --> 00:56:51,364
We are not friends.

887
00:56:51,538 --> 00:56:53,627
I wanted nothing
to do with any of you.

888
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:55,542
The only reason
I'm in this cabin

889
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:57,876
is because for the past year
my luck's been total crap.

890
00:56:59,024 --> 00:57:00,436
And I didn't tell you
about that video

891
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,157
because Clayton told me not to.

892
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:03,331
And I'm glad I didn't.

893
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,161
Because I didn't move
2,000 miles

894
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,135
to be friends
with a bunch of losers like you.

895
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:21,046
Oh, no, no, no.

896
00:57:23,178 --> 00:57:24,397
We're not done yet.

897
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,491
Yeah. Oh, man, wow!

898
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:36,017
Well, up next we have
the Righteous Regiment

899
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:38,977
with Pumping Iron for Jesus.
Come on.

900
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:49,335
Hey, brobeans, how long are you
going to be on the bench?

901
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:50,789
Oh, hey, I didn't see you there.

902
00:57:52,425 --> 00:57:55,341
You know, usually I do core for
about 30 to 45 minutes to an hour,

903
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:57,996
but today I'll let you have it,

904
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,250
to echo the love of Christ.

905
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:01,216
The love of Christ?

906
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:03,087
What's that?

907
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:05,438
Come, lift,

908
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:08,354
and I'll tell you all about
the wild mystery of grace.

909
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,448
For God so loved the world

910
00:58:15,622 --> 00:58:16,942
that he gave
his one and only son.

911
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,584
That whoever believes in him
will live forever and ever.

912
00:58:22,107 --> 00:58:23,107
Amen.

913
00:58:30,202 --> 00:58:34,423
Amen! Amen,
and that is wild grace.

914
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:37,818
Yeah...
very inspiring.

915
00:58:37,992 --> 00:58:40,865
Very inspiring.
A great reminder that evangelism

916
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:42,319
can and should
happen everywhere.

917
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:44,497
The great commission, brothers.

918
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,479
Yeah!

919
00:58:47,436 --> 00:58:50,614
Next up, the Passover Privates.

920
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,187
Tonight, I bring to you a story,
my dearest friends,

921
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:00,441
of desolation and betrayal.

922
00:59:01,712 --> 00:59:05,411
You know it well, as it is actually
in the hearts of all believers.

923
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,718
The setting, the garden of ge...

924
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,765
- Gethsemane.
- Gethsemane.

925
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:15,464
And I, Gordo,

926
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:17,510
shall play your narrator
and personal savior.

927
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:21,470
My friends shall play
my faithful apostles,

928
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:26,519
and behold Judas, from Florida,

929
00:59:26,693 --> 00:59:30,915
and the chief counsel on their
way to arrest the savior of man.

930
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:32,743
And Judas betrayed his friend...

931
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:35,397
with a kiss.

932
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:39,097
- Kiss me.
- No.

933
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:40,271
Kiss me.

934
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:58,333
And lo, after the betrayal
of our Lord and Savior,

935
00:59:58,507 --> 01:00:02,250
the council came forward
and pantsed him.

936
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:19,616
And the world
kept turning. The end.

937
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,138
Hey, Gordumb, these stories are
supposed to be about redemption.

938
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,580
Not all stories
end with an altar call.

939
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:47,644
Okay. Up next,
the Biblical Brigade.

940
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:13,626
What's going on, son?

941
01:01:16,237 --> 01:01:17,456
Nothing.

942
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:24,202
Sit, son. Hey... sit down.

943
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:32,558
You were scared there.

944
01:01:34,647 --> 01:01:37,563
I know because I can see fear,
a lot of people can't.

945
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:39,478
But I can.

946
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,002
Amazing grace, isn't it?

947
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:44,396
What's that?

948
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,570
The other side.

949
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:47,485
The spiritual realm,

950
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:50,734
where the angels live,
the angels play, the angels fly.

951
01:01:52,534 --> 01:01:55,363
I know you've been there, because
you have rainbows on your shoulders

952
01:01:55,537 --> 01:01:56,625
that I can see.

953
01:01:57,496 --> 01:01:59,237
Let me ask you this.

954
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:01,021
What was it like for you?

955
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,154
Terrifying.

956
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:08,376
My parents' church...

957
01:02:09,551 --> 01:02:10,814
told them I needed baptism.

958
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:15,079
And in the river,
when I was being held under,

959
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:19,474
we were attacked by alligators.

960
01:02:20,693 --> 01:02:22,695
Why are you laughing?

961
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:25,742
Christians killed my parents
and almost killed me.

962
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:28,875
Okay, I'm not laughing.
I just reacted in a...

963
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:30,572
Not a good way.

964
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,031
Let me tell you something, Ian.

965
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,033
Your first death is a blessing,

966
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:38,319
because it creates a need
for you to live in faith.

967
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:43,107
Those letters stand for, "Fantastic
Adventures In Trusting Him."

968
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:47,720
And that's why we're here.

969
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:52,507
So, what do you need
to break free of to see clearly?

970
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,295
- My fear.
- Your fear.

971
01:02:58,557 --> 01:02:59,557
F-E-A-R.

972
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:04,171
That stands for,
"False Evidence Appearing Real."

973
01:03:06,043 --> 01:03:07,566
There's no reason to be afraid.

974
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,786
People who are in fear
create it themselves.

975
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,788
And where does it get them?
Nowhere.

976
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:17,184
Lose fear, buddy, dismiss fear.

977
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:19,883
It doesn't work.

978
01:03:21,623 --> 01:03:23,343
It's something you're
creating over nothing.

979
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:25,497
Dismiss fear.

980
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:33,287
I'm sorry to inform you

981
01:03:33,461 --> 01:03:35,261
that Bradley is going
to leave in the morning.

982
01:03:36,595 --> 01:03:39,467
Without a leader, I'm going
to have to split the Privates up

983
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:40,642
into different cabins.

984
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,954
Ian, what did I tell you?

985
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:49,608
I told you I'd get
it done, right?

986
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:50,782
What's up, brother?

987
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:54,918
Welcome, my friend,

988
01:03:56,223 --> 01:03:57,398
to the Righteous Regiment.

989
01:03:58,225 --> 01:03:59,225
Let's go.

990
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:02,707
Cut the chit chat, jumps.

991
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:05,145
I got an announcement to make.

992
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:06,519
I'd like to welcome the ticket

993
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:08,975
to tomorrow's
God Games victory...

994
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:11,673
Ian!

995
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,809
Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian...

996
01:04:16,983 --> 01:04:20,726
Tomorrow morning, I will
launch this small, frail,

997
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,555
stick like,
human shaped projectile

998
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:25,557
into the atmosphere,

999
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:30,127
securing our fifth consecutive
God Games victory.

1000
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:33,521
Let me hear it. Let me hear it.

1001
01:04:33,695 --> 01:04:35,828
Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian!

1002
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:38,483
Don't get me wrong,
I love me some horseplay.

1003
01:04:38,657 --> 01:04:41,399
Shenanigans are great, you all
know I'm big on tomfoolery.

1004
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:43,096
I need you guys
to get some rest.

1005
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:45,185
Got a big day tomorrow.
Woo! Let's do this!

1006
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:48,841
Yeah, come on! Woo!

1007
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:50,147
Dear campers,

1008
01:04:50,321 --> 01:04:51,757
we will only have two cabins

1009
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:53,091
in this year's Leap of Faith.

1010
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,760
The Religious Right Rank
or the Righteous Regiment,

1011
01:04:58,155 --> 01:05:01,071
who will display themselves
as the superior Christians

1012
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:03,203
in this year's
winner-take-all finale?

1013
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,712
What's up brother?
Hey, the first one up?

1014
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:36,602
What if I don't want to join up?

1015
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:38,693
What do you mean?
You're already in.

1016
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:39,717
God's will is done.

1017
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:40,761
No, I mean,

1018
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:44,810
what if I don't want to be
a part of the Leap of Faith?

1019
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:47,726
Oh! Oh, well, then, uh,

1020
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,685
I'll just have to personally ensure
that Todd kicks you in the face

1021
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:52,259
every day for the rest
of your life.

1022
01:05:54,124 --> 01:05:55,492
I'm just kidding, man.
You'll do great.

1023
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:56,822
God be the glory, buddy.

1024
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:57,996
Woohoo!

1025
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,964
- My name is Billy.
- Do you like America?

1026
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:10,705
Have you ever seen
the Superman?

1027
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:13,404
America as great
as you thought it was?

1028
01:06:13,578 --> 01:06:15,418
- Do you like...
- Where in Africa are you from?

1029
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:23,631
- What the crap are you doing?
- I need some time

1030
01:06:23,805 --> 01:06:24,913
-to find Bradley.
- How are you planning on doing that,

1031
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:26,286
using your Everglade voodoo?

1032
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,568
You don't even know
where he went.

1033
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:28,854
I know, I need a miracle.

1034
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:30,028
Stall as long as you can.

1035
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:35,861
Can you actually run
as fast as we think you can?

1036
01:06:36,035 --> 01:06:37,645
You believe in Jesus,
though, right?

1037
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:45,566
- Do you want my food?
- Do you like the water?

1038
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,314
Dude, what happened in there?
Any idea?

1039
01:06:54,488 --> 01:06:55,488
Where is he?

1040
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:57,491
Who do you mean, bro?

1041
01:06:57,665 --> 01:06:59,232
The projectile, Todd.

1042
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:06,891
This is Ian Fletcher.

1043
01:07:07,936 --> 01:07:10,417
I'm looking for a tall,
lanky camp counselor.

1044
01:07:11,505 --> 01:07:13,594
His name is Bradley. Over.

1045
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:17,511
Is anyone listening? Over.

1046
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:24,040
I'm looking for Bradley Sommers.

1047
01:07:24,214 --> 01:07:26,912
He's a camp counselor
at Camp Manna. Over.

1048
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:29,523
- Why did you pull the lever?
- It was a diversion.

1049
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:30,394
- Yeah?
- For what?

1050
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:31,568
Ian is gonna...

1051
01:07:32,744 --> 01:07:34,615
Dang it!

1052
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:38,358
No! Who pulled the alarm?
You guys, come on!

1053
01:07:38,532 --> 01:07:39,612
There are rules here, guys.

1054
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,755
Cujo said, "Go to the Leap
of Faith with no breakfast",

1055
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:45,409
at the Lake of Galilee."

1056
01:07:46,497 --> 01:07:47,497
Da... garn it!

1057
01:07:48,542 --> 01:07:50,588
- This is a disaster.
- That went well.

1058
01:07:55,027 --> 01:07:58,552
I don't know, fellas. I made
a real spectacle of myself.

1059
01:07:58,726 --> 01:08:00,119
A real spectacle.

1060
01:08:00,293 --> 01:08:01,773
It was bad, I mean,
you can't imagine.

1061
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:07,213
So, I guess it's just time to start
thinking about a... a new career.

1062
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:10,608
Carpenter,
tax collector, fisherman.

1063
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:12,566
Future is looking bright
for Bradley, though.

1064
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:14,020
We're just going to keep moving.

1065
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,540
Yeah.

1066
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:37,678
Hey! Shit.

1067
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:40,638
Good. Hey, this...
Can I have it... great band!

1068
01:08:42,509 --> 01:08:43,988
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

1069
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:46,644
Welcome to the Leap of Faith.

1070
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:50,212
Come on, energy, energy!

1071
01:08:51,736 --> 01:08:52,736
Okay.

1072
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:57,568
Our finalists,
the Religious Right Rank.

1073
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:05,532
And the Righteous Regiment.

1074
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:19,851
Okay. Religious Right Rank,

1075
01:09:20,024 --> 01:09:21,112
you're up!

1076
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:26,553
I'm not a leader.

1077
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:29,033
I'm a... I'm a horrible leader.
Horrible leader.

1078
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:31,036
This is Ian Fletcher.

1079
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,343
I'm looking for Bradley Sommers.

1080
01:09:33,517 --> 01:09:35,867
- He's a camp counselor at Camp Manna, over.
- Finally.

1081
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:37,477
Yeah, Ian, we have him.

1082
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:40,654
Bradley.

1083
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:41,827
Hello?

1084
01:09:43,569 --> 01:09:44,615
Hey, Ian.

1085
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:46,965
Hi, Bradley.

1086
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:49,619
Why did you leave?

1087
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:55,800
I'm not coming back.

1088
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,541
Over.

1089
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:05,505
What did you do that for?

1090
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,178
To knock a little sense
into that noggin of yours.

1091
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:08,202
- Bradley.
- Really?

1092
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,639
Hello?

1093
01:10:13,644 --> 01:10:15,124
You've been fasting
all week for this.

1094
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:16,734
I don't feel good.

1095
01:10:16,907 --> 01:10:18,736
- Don't let me down.
- I need food.

1096
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:26,916
Pick up the timing.

1097
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:31,052
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

1098
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,227
It's something you've been wanting to
do, something I've been waiting to see.

1099
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:40,105
Bomber ready?

1100
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:45,630
All right, let's see it.

1101
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:56,208
Come on!

1102
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:07,218
Thank you.

1103
01:11:08,525 --> 01:11:09,525
I appreciate that.

1104
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:11,789
Righteous Regiment.

1105
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,791
You're up!

1106
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:19,449
We're not going back.
The damage has been done.

1107
01:11:19,623 --> 01:11:22,800
Now, wait, you just...
Talk to the boy.

1108
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,063
Come on.

1109
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:28,108
I'm no different, Ian.

1110
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,764
I've been just like Clayton.

1111
01:11:30,938 --> 01:11:33,376
I was using you too,
thinking about myself.

1112
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,029
I wasn't thinking
about anybody else.

1113
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:39,860
So, buddy, it's over. Over.

1114
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:45,431
Clayton would never tell me
the truth like you did.

1115
01:11:45,605 --> 01:11:47,259
You're finally
being honest with yourself,

1116
01:11:47,433 --> 01:11:48,873
like you were
that night at the fire.

1117
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:52,090
What are you
so scared of, Bradley?

1118
01:11:52,264 --> 01:11:53,624
What's the worst
that could happen?

1119
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:57,835
People will always say, "Bradley
was the guy who ran away.

1120
01:11:58,009 --> 01:12:00,011
He was the one who never
finished what he started."

1121
01:12:02,927 --> 01:12:04,537
Let's finish this together.

1122
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:08,933
There's no one else
I'd rather have as my leader.

1123
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:12,197
Please! Over.

1124
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:13,503
Hear that?

1125
01:12:14,155 --> 01:12:15,287
He wants you back.

1126
01:12:19,987 --> 01:12:22,425
All right. Let's finished
this thing with style, boys.

1127
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,427
Not so fast.

1128
01:12:25,862 --> 01:12:26,864
Brother.

1129
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,911
Cujo, my man.

1130
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:33,261
What's the meaning
of this debauchery, huh?

1131
01:12:33,436 --> 01:12:34,523
- Stand down, Gordo.
- Sir.

1132
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:39,311
Every year he comes in here
and rigs the system.

1133
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:41,922
- Whoa!
- We earned our right

1134
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:44,142
to compete today,
sir, fair and square.

1135
01:12:45,273 --> 01:12:46,927
Can we get some order here?

1136
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:49,539
It seems like the superiority
of the Righteous Reg

1137
01:12:49,713 --> 01:12:53,020
has led to some jealousy
among the less gifted campers.

1138
01:12:53,193 --> 01:12:54,193
Truth is eternal.

1139
01:12:55,632 --> 01:12:58,591
- Sir...
- As it was in the beginning and as it is now.

1140
01:13:00,505 --> 01:13:02,900
You need to find
a leader to compete.

1141
01:13:05,163 --> 01:13:07,513
Thank you. Let's go, Todd.

1142
01:13:08,862 --> 01:13:09,862
Yes!

1143
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:12,212
What now?

1144
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:16,244
Never thought I'd say this,
William, but...

1145
01:13:17,436 --> 01:13:19,525
we're gonna have to pray.

1146
01:13:30,275 --> 01:13:31,275
Go.

1147
01:13:32,886 --> 01:13:33,886
Go.

1148
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:41,591
Man, Todd's shorts
are really tight.

1149
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:46,160
Oh, Jesus...

1150
01:13:55,605 --> 01:13:58,303
If victory shall become
this humble servant,

1151
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,260
it is a victory for all.

1152
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:05,702
Because I believe the Righteous
Regiment has been chosen

1153
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:08,400
to showcase
that with great faith

1154
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:10,446
come great victory.

1155
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:15,276
Today,
God's will be done on Earth

1156
01:14:16,887 --> 01:14:19,237
as it is...
Good gravy on Moses!

1157
01:14:19,411 --> 01:14:20,760
Are you done?

1158
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:25,330
As it is in heaven.

1159
01:14:58,189 --> 01:15:02,019
Good work, guys, good work.
Two, three, four! Hit it!

1160
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:11,376
See, Gordo,
the Regimen always wins.

1161
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,750
I was born to win these games.

1162
01:15:14,335 --> 01:15:15,335
Clayton!

1163
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,865
Let my Privates go!

1164
01:15:25,477 --> 01:15:26,477
Bradley?

1165
01:15:27,697 --> 01:15:31,135
- Sir.
- Wait, what are you doing back here?

1166
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:35,181
I don't know.

1167
01:15:36,923 --> 01:15:38,142
But I'm tired of running.

1168
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:40,897
Pretending to be
somebody I'm not.

1169
01:15:41,798 --> 01:15:45,628
And I'm Bradley,
perpetual screw up.

1170
01:15:47,412 --> 01:15:49,066
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

1171
01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:53,287
All right. That works.

1172
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,289
Yeah, fancy speech, Brad.

1173
01:15:55,463 --> 01:15:57,572
But Cujo is not going to let you
just roll back in here

1174
01:15:57,596 --> 01:15:59,293
like you own the place,

1175
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:01,121
and just give you
another chance.

1176
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:03,559
Oh, I'm not asking
for another chance.

1177
01:16:05,038 --> 01:16:06,431
I'm asking for forgiveness.

1178
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:09,565
But competing would be nice.

1179
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:15,483
Bradley had the courage
to come back here,

1180
01:16:15,657 --> 01:16:17,834
and aren't you guys
all about second chances?

1181
01:16:18,008 --> 01:16:20,706
Yeah, but not for sinners.
We already won, okay.

1182
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,560
God's will is done,
forever and ever. Amen.

1183
01:16:22,665 --> 01:16:24,275
Hold on. Put a lid on it.

1184
01:16:24,449 --> 01:16:26,407
"Amen" is rarely the end.

1185
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:30,673
It just sets us up
for a new level to go to.

1186
01:16:31,848 --> 01:16:32,928
Do you still have the pass?

1187
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,035
Bradley, choose a camper.

1188
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,210
What?

1189
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:53,913
Now, who's coming with me?

1190
01:16:58,091 --> 01:16:59,440
I think my brother should do it.

1191
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:02,791
Yeah, I... I agree.

1192
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:04,508
It's more of an agility thing
than anything else.

1193
01:17:04,532 --> 01:17:06,143
I mean, if you think
about the blob

1194
01:17:06,317 --> 01:17:08,275
- and how much air is in there...
- No, yeah.

1195
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:09,969
It's more about
trying to get on it,

1196
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:11,298
and, like, that's gonna be
the difficulty.

1197
01:17:11,322 --> 01:17:12,322
I'll do it.

1198
01:17:27,599 --> 01:17:28,818
Clayton, do something.

1199
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:38,610
What's he doing?

1200
01:17:39,306 --> 01:17:40,306
Go get them.

1201
01:17:43,267 --> 01:17:45,748
- All right.
- Clayton, you have to stop this. Please.

1202
01:17:47,139 --> 01:17:48,219
Let me think, let me think.

1203
01:17:48,968 --> 01:17:50,143
That kid is gonna fly.

1204
01:17:53,755 --> 01:17:55,496
This Leap of Faith
will change your life.

1205
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,846
And your spirit,

1206
01:17:58,325 --> 01:17:59,325
and your heart.

1207
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:25,831
Cujo, is this some kind of joke?

1208
01:18:26,005 --> 01:18:27,685
Okay, you can't allow
this tomfoolery here.

1209
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:32,359
- That storm is past.
- We already displayed God's greatness,

1210
01:18:32,532 --> 01:18:35,642
and you're freaking ruining it, and you're
freaking ruining Camp Manna for everyone,

1211
01:18:35,666 --> 01:18:37,906
-and you're ruining my whole summer!
- Calm down, Clayton.

1212
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:39,322
It's all right.

1213
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:52,030
Clayton!

1214
01:19:45,215 --> 01:19:46,303
Jesus!

1215
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:05,975
Yes, yes!

1216
01:20:11,763 --> 01:20:12,764
Woo!

1217
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:20,291
No!

1218
01:20:24,602 --> 01:20:26,255
Stop it, stop it!

1219
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:27,431
He can't swim.

1220
01:20:39,182 --> 01:20:41,619
Ian, you know,
I really can't save your life

1221
01:20:41,793 --> 01:20:45,362
all the time in the water,
I am not Aquaman.

1222
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:58,592
When I was 15 years old,

1223
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:00,086
I was forced to go
to summer camp.

1224
01:21:01,246 --> 01:21:02,246
It was called Camp Manna.

1225
01:21:03,293 --> 01:21:05,251
And although I thought
it would be terrible,

1226
01:21:05,425 --> 01:21:08,210
as it turns out,
that week with my friends,

1227
01:21:08,385 --> 01:21:10,039
forever changed my life.

1228
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:20,571
- ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪
- ♪ I have a friend in Jesus ♪

1229
01:21:20,745 --> 01:21:22,834

- ♪ Jesus... ♪

1230
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:24,791
Wow, wow, wow, wait!
John, I forgot.

1231
01:21:24,967 --> 01:21:26,967
Oh, come on, just about
got into my favorite verse.

1232
01:21:28,318 --> 01:21:30,842
I'm sorry, Ian.
Is there something else

1233
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:32,975
- you'd rather listen to?
- I don't mind.

1234

That's his talent guys.

1247
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:22,589
- Alright good. Sit down.
- I'm so sorry.

1248
01:22:25,809 --> 01:22:27,898
Dang it!

1249
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:29,639
- Okay.
- Guys, guys... I think he...

1250
01:22:29,814 --> 01:22:30,814
Action.

1251
01:22:32,991 --> 01:22:34,012
What the crap are you doing?

1252
01:22:34,036 --> 01:22:35,036
Stall as long as you can.

1253
01:22:35,514 --> 01:22:36,514
For what?

1254
01:22:37,213 --> 01:22:38,648
Go ahead.

1255
01:22:38,823 --> 01:22:40,303
Clayton, you have to stop this.

1256
01:22:40,477 --> 01:22:41,477
Please.

1257
01:22:42,261 --> 01:22:43,741

Shut it.

1262
01:22:52,793 --> 01:22:54,491
Do something, man, come on.

1263
01:22:56,928 --> 01:22:58,601
Why are you just sitting there?
Do something!

1264
01:22:58,625 --> 01:22:59,625
Get my sword.

1265
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:04,630
About how you live
at home with your mom?

1266
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:06,677
It's not funny.

1267
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:09,462
Not funny. My mom has MS,

1268
01:23:09,636 --> 01:23:11,356
I stay at home
so she can live with dignity.

1269
01:23:12,726 --> 01:23:14,617
Oh, I thought it was 'cause
your roommates kicked you out

1270
01:23:14,641 --> 01:23:15,921
'cause of your
cologne addiction.

1271
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:18,341
You know about
my cologne addiction?

1272
01:23:18,514 --> 01:23:19,690
Smell it on you right now.

1273
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:26,740
When you take shortcuts,

1274
01:23:26,914 --> 01:23:29,439
you get chuck... fi... figgy.

1275
01:23:29,612 --> 01:23:30,612
Take 6, mark.

1276
01:23:31,789 --> 01:23:33,312
Excuse me.

1277
01:23:33,486 --> 01:23:35,314
140 Romeo.

1278
01:23:35,487 --> 01:23:36,576
Take one, A-mark.

1279
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,230
- Romeo.
- A-Mark!

1280
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:42,538
Guess I'll never know.

1281
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:45,150
Look, Ian, in this place sucks

1282
01:23:45,324 --> 01:23:46,823
because you're stuck
with Bradley, okay.

1283
01:23:46,847 --> 01:23:47,934
The dudes are total goober.

1284
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:49,633
Seriously, he just... just sautés

1285
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:51,374
in goob sauce all day.

1286
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:53,811
All right?

1287
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:57,380
Now, don't jump
to conclusions, pal.

1288
01:23:57,554 --> 01:23:59,512
You never know
who you're gonna meet a camp.

1289
01:23:59,686 --> 01:24:02,210
In fact, I meet your aunt Sharon
at camp.

1290
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:04,909
I was in eighth year counselor,

1291
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:06,998
and she was the prettiest camper

1292
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:10,132
I'd ever laid eyes on.

1293
01:24:12,308 --> 01:24:16,355
- Oh!
- Oh... oh, are those my teeth?

1294
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:23,754
Oh boy, I've really got
to take off this adult diaper.

1295
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:29,151
You know what?

1296
01:24:29,325 --> 01:24:31,805
- What?
- This doesn't concern you, Clayton.

1297
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:37,942
Oh, it concerns me, Bradley,
it concerns me big time.

1298
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:39,726
Look how concerned my face is.

1299
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:40,900
You see the concern?

1300
01:24:42,032 --> 01:24:44,035
- You see that?
- Looks like constipation to me.

1301
01:24:45,558 --> 01:24:48,387
You say constipation,
I can... I say consternation.

1302
01:24:53,175 --> 01:24:55,525
- All right. Let's keep going, let's keep going.
- Okay.

1303
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,100
Come on.

1304
01:25:06,927 --> 01:25:09,843
He's...

1305
01:25:10,017 --> 01:25:11,017
They're disqualified.

1306
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:13,891
- We won. We won!
- Disqualification!

1307
01:25:14,065 --> 01:25:15,066
- Yeah!
- We won!

1308
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,763
It's the end of the movie, guys!

1309
01:25:16,937 --> 01:25:18,764
Roll the credits.
Roll the credits.

1310
01:25:18,939 --> 01:25:19,984
Go, quick, please.
