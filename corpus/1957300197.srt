1202
01:20:31,725 --> 01:20:34,495
I mean, I hid the backpack.
I hid the box.

1203
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,497
And also,
I do not weigh 50 pounds,

1204
01:20:36,532 --> 01:20:38,136
and there were not enough
ashes in that.

1205
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:40,809
But then you probably
figured that out

1206
01:20:40,844 --> 01:20:42,305
because you're such
a little smarty pants.

1207
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:44,307
Sadly, I didn't.

1208
01:20:44,342 --> 01:20:47,145
Now this last bit
is important.

1209
01:20:49,347 --> 01:20:51,545
You have to move on
with your life.

1210
01:20:52,746 --> 01:20:54,548
What happened to you

1211
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,320
is not what's
happening to you.

1212
01:20:57,355 --> 01:21:00,059
Your past does not dictate
your future.

1213
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:04,162
Life is so short.

1214
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:06,967
Try having some more fun.

1215
01:21:07,002 --> 01:21:08,529
And be kind.

1216
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:16,405
I love you
with all my heart.

1217
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,573
I'm so sorry that I wasn't
better at showing that to you.

1218
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:24,215
I fucked up.
I just fucked up and it was my fault.

1219
01:21:25,779 --> 01:21:28,054
I know it.

1220
01:21:28,089 --> 01:21:29,583
I'm sorry.

1221
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:36,964
Now, I'm hoping
and I believe

1222
01:21:36,999 --> 01:21:41,463
that we will be reunited
again in some dimension.

1223
01:21:41,498 --> 01:21:44,202
- Oh, man.
- I know you don't believe that,

1224
01:21:44,237 --> 01:21:46,809
but you're gonna feel
so stupid when it happens.

1225
01:21:49,077 --> 01:21:51,671
And then,

1226
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:53,013
maybe we can spend
the time together

1227
01:21:53,048 --> 01:21:57,050
that we didn't in this life.

1228
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:00,053
I would like that.

1229
01:22:05,456 --> 01:22:09,227
So...

1230
01:22:09,262 --> 01:22:11,064
until then.

1232
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,895
This is a terrible painting.

1233
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:18,494
And an even worse title.

1234
01:23:25,503 --> 01:23:29,472
I'm gonna miss you, Mom.

1235
01:23:29,507 --> 01:23:31,342
That's for sure.
