1
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:32,490
And here we are at the finals of the Eleventh 
Annual Northwest Martial Arts Tournament

2
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,788
where defending champion David Conner 
faces newcomer Bobby Souk.

3
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:43,168
Most of these men have made competitions 
getting to the finals. This should be a good one.

4
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,963
This is the match everyone has been waiting to see.

5
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:58,224
Already there seems to be a lot of tension in the 
arena tonight as this is the first time these two 
men have met in competition.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,271
Bobby Souk representing WKKA, a new Karate organization

7
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,649
headed by a local businessman Donald Moss.

8
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:12,238
Honor is Mark Bane by Souk stare down as the two come into 
the ring to shake hands.

9
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:17,535
And Bobby Souk sending a message early, 
he's here to take Conner's title.

10
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:35,094
David Conner comes out uncharacteristically aggressive, and 
lands an early point with a front kick.

11
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:44,270
Conner with his exclusive jumping side kick to 
the neck of an extremely perplexed Bobby Souk.

12
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:10,964
And Souk grabbing Conner out of kidney punches 
as the referee steps in to break up the fight.

13
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,425
This could be grounds for disqualification.

14
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,931
No, they will continue the fight.

15
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:36,072
And an awesome jump spinning back kick 
and this baby is the challenger.

16
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:41,077
Yes the referee has stopped the match. Only one 
minute thirty six seconds for the first round.

17
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,498
Once again, David Conner has defended his title

18
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,336
There's mayhem right now in the ring, as 
Bobby Souk comes after Conner.

19
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,339
Restraining him, this is unbelieveable.

20
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,426
Souk is looking for a street fight.

21
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,487
This is unbelievable. David Conner has just won his seventh 
consecutive martial arts championship

22
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:20,074
An unbelievable one minute and thirty 
six seconds of the first round.

23
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,160
Over newcomer Bobby Souk.

24
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,537
The word is domination

25
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:29,209
Conner dominated Souk from the start 
but they've arrived on...

26
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,571
Tonight we've got Shirley out of Shoreline, 
go ahead Shirley on Sports Talk.

27
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:03,826
Yeah, hi. I had a little comment about Josh Conner.

28
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,870
He used to be really good, what happened to him?

29
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,705
You know, that's an excellent point.

30
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,583
Couple years back those guys were one and two.

31
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:15,546
And, for those of you that aren't familiar, Josh Conner is 
David Conner's identical twin brother.

32
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,592
And in my book just as good, if not better. So,

33
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,595
I'm with you, what happened to him? Look at today...

34
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,434
Come on.

35
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,062
I said, come on.

36
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,691
What an asshole.

37
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,651
Let's go.

38
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,032
What's your problem?

39
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,826
Your attitude.

40
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,703
Just get in the car.

41
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,260
Where are you going?

42
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,928
I said get in the car.

43
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,599
Good match.

44
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,642
Bullshit.

45
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,977
That match was rigged.

46
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,520
Come on Allison.

47
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,813
Whatever.

48
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,524
Don't walk away from me.

49
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,278
Does this happen everytime you lose a match?

50
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,989
I don't know, I've never lost before

51
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,074
Well, you better get used to it.

52
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,203
You think you're pretty hot shit with that points spar.

53
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,830
Let's see how you do out here.

54
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,125
Hey, you lost. Now deal with it.

55
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,088
Hi, we've got Ed from Edmonds, welcome to Sports Talk.

56
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,091
Yeah, hi. First time caller. I love the show.

57
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,219
I was hoping to talk about this Conner Souk fight.

58
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,262
Yeah

59
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:51,642
Well, you know. I don't know. It's just seems like in a real
 fight that Souk could probably kick Conner's ass

60
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,645
I mean in this tournament it's just point sparring.

61
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,524
That's why they call it a sport, Ed.

62
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,783
What a prick.

63
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,077
And he's an instructor?

64
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:09,786
Yeah.

65
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,662
Where?

66
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,457
World Karate and Kung Fu Association

67
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,125
I've never heard of that.

68
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,336
New in town.

69
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:23,091
You know, guys like that just piss me off. I have half a 
mind to go over there and kick his ass myself.

70
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,719
Wouldn't he be surprised.

71
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,072
[Cell Ringing]

72
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,991
It's for you.

73
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,410
I don't need to talk to anybody right now.

74
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,494
Here.

75
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,165
Yeah?

76
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,502
Alright, Thursday's the deadline.

77
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,630
Excellent, now when we cut the deal

78
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,552
I want two million, Black Moore account, US currency.

79
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,554
Excellent.

80
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,347
Excellent.

81
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,723
Uh, look.

82
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,101
Tell Berman

83
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,104
I want to see him on my yacht, later on 
this evening. You understand?

84
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,274
Let's go boys.

85
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,823
You better get that twenty out of your pocket, pretty boy.

86
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,950
It's mine now.

87
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,537
Ain't over yet Jack, you gotta earn it.

88
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,712
Wanna go double or nothing, smart boy?

89
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,214
On this game?

90
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,301
Yeah, on this game. You got a problem with that?

91
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,311
Forty bucks.

92
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,896
This game.

93
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,064
Let's see you make a shot.

94
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,423
You better have the money on you

95
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,848
Close.

96
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,477
Real close.

97
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,694
What can I get you?

98
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,820
Give me a beer.

99
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,868
Oh, this is bullshit.

100
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,745
What's the problem?

101
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,666
I was distracted, asshole. That's what the problem is.

102
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,918
What? I don't think so.

103
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,173
That's forty bucks.

104
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,181
I said I was distracted.

105
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,017
Hey, you lost the game now pay up.

106
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,145
You gonna make me?

107
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,566
Um.

108
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,900
Forget it.

109
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,454
I think you owe me a beer.

110
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,542
Sure.

111
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,670
Two bucks.

112
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,922
My new friend here is paying

113
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,974
Damn, I'm real sorry about that.

114
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,392
It's no problem.

115
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,602
It won't be when you buy me another one.

116
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,896
Shouldn't the bar keeper replace it.

117
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:10,901
Jack, why don't you sit down and I'll pour 
you another one on the house.

118
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,366
You can only spill so much beer.

119
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,369
You could buy him another one.

120
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,747
You got that?

121
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,917
I said, have you got that?

122
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,266
You fucking asshole.

123
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,311
Are you deaf?

124
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,563
Or just stupid?

125
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,608
You son of a bitch.

126
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,658
Come on. Get up.

127
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,369
I ain't through with you yet.

128
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,392
That's enough, leave him alone.

129
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,567
You want some more?

130
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,487
Yeah.

131
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,407
You came to the right place.

132
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,358
Guess we haven't met.

133
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,945
My name's Jack.

134
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,734
Hey, you okay?

135
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,028
Yeah

136
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:08,996
You know, it doesn't look good for the Northwest Karate 
Champion to get his ass kicked by some redneck.

137
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,415
Do I know you?

138
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,001
No.

139
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,961
I saw you at the tournament.

140
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,880
My name's Allison.

141
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,300
You're still bleeding.

142
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,594
Let me see that.

143
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,349
Do you always get involved in bar fights?

144
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,477
You always block with your face?

145
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,359
You might need stitches, but I think you'll live.

146
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,697
I guess I'm not the only one.

147
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,283
He caught me by surprise.

148
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,287
It wasn't me.

149
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,164
What wasn't?

150
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,874
At the tournament tonight

151
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,127
It was my brother.

152
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,796
Sorry, you just

153
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,130
I know.

154
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,552
Hold this.

155
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,349
So why'd you let him knock you around?

156
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,896
I know what it's like to have a bad day.

157
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,400
You have a name?

158
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,944
Josh.

159
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,824
Well, Josh, let's get that cut taken care of.

160
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,077
So

161
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,414
Thursday's the deadline.

162
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,126
Do you have a problem with that?

163
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,419
You got a buyer?

164
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,297
Yeah, I got a buyer.

165
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,424
Flying in from Zurich

166
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,843
How much does he need?

167
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,846
Two million.

168
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,182
And if the quality is good

169
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,434
there's gonna be a lot more.

170
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,146
I brought in the best printer on the west coast.

171
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,190
You won't be able to tell it from the real thing.

172
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,696
You better be right.

173
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,966
You looking for someone?

174
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,650
Dwyer.

175
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,905
Don't ever touch me.

176
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,889
Your name Tobin?

177
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,184
Yeah.

178
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,230
Dwyer.

179
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,566
Angel.

180
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,080
Let's see it.

181
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,294
What do you say we have a drink first?

182
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,506
What do you say you give me the stuff 
so I can get the hell out of here?

183
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,637
First we drink.

184
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,228
And then we deal.

185
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,712
I still think you should get stitches.

186
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,589
I'm fine.

187
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,678
You're married?

188
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,555
Engaged.

189
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,363
What's that?

190
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,323
It's just a room.

191
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,499
Do you mind?

192
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,308
This is part of your studio?

193
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,102
Yeah.

194
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,861
How many students do you have?

195
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,239
One.

196
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,492
Just you.

197
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,501
You still work out?

198
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,338
Did you compete today?

199
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:34,882
No.

200
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,050
I was there with my boyfriend.

201
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,220
He sparred your brother in the finals.

202
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,848
Short match.

203
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,558
Yeah.

204
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,650
I better go.

205
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,405
When are you gonna get married?

206
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,783
I don't know.

207
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,203
When are you going to start teaching taekwondo again?

208
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,458
Why? You wanna learn?

209
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,752
Depends.

210
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,086
On?

211
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,672
Whether or not I like it.

212
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,342
Let's find out.

213
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,877
You got the funds?

214
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,963
I ain't here for my health.

215
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,673
Well, let's see it.

216
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,301
This shit better be pure.

217
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,231
Tobin, what are you doing packing here?

218
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:20,195
That's a lot of cash. I wouldn't want anybody to 
take it from me without my permission.

219
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,948
We wouldn't want that.

220
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,289
Now, let's see what we got here.

221
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,959
Not so fast.

222
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,295
Let me see the stuff.

223
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,475
Ninety percent pure.

224
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,394
Don't get any better than that.

225
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,688
Sure doesn't.

226
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,151
What the hell is this?

227
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,572
I'm just having some fun.

228
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,879
Yeah, you having fun now asshole?

229
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,048
What do you say I put a bullet in your head?

230
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,133
What do you say I take your girl home with me?

231
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,969
Fuck you.

232
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,533
Next time check the chamber, asshole.

233
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,382
How long have you been doing this?

234
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,389
Maybe twenty two, twenty three years.

235
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,518
You ever get tired of it?

236
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,563
Yeah. Sometimes.

237
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,108
Then why don't you stop?

238
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,738
Because it's the only thing I was ever good at.

239
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,410
I really have to go.

240
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,623
Tell me something.

241
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,920
Why are you gonna marry someone you don't even like?

242
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,090
I never said I didn't like him.

243
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,135
You didn't have to.

244
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,848
Thanks for the demo.

245
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,392
Take care of your eye.

246
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,203
Why don't you wait for me in the cadillac, Dreg?

247
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,500
Feel that?

248
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,053
What you got for me, Henry?

249
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,473
The man's trying to sell you out.

250
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,644
Which one?

251
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,154
Which one?

252
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,700
Berman.

253
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,413
The feds?

254
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,457
Yep.

255
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,835
What'd you tell them?

256
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,671
Nothing yet.

257
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,965
He's asking for a hundred grand.

258
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,676
And if they decide to pay it

259
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,178
Your time be over.

260
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,311
Are these real?

261
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,695
Why don't you take them to the bank? Find out for yourself?

262
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,008
Where were you last night?

263
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,011
I went out with some friends.

264
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,055
Well, next time I suggest you ask.

265
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,391
You don't own me.

266
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,228
Once we're married I will.

267
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,397
I made one mistake coming out here with you.

268
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,441
You can bet I won't make two.

269
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,902
What's that supposed to mean?

270
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,238
Figure it out.

271
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,760
What's Josh been up to?

272
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,095
I don't know.

273
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,598
Was he at the tournament?

274
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,601
Didn't see him.

275
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,731
Well, when was the last time you did see him?

276
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,444
Last month.

277
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,489
He's fine.

278
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,828
I want you to invite him over for dinner tonight.

279
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,288
Why?

280
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,416
Because he's your brother, silly.

281
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,754
Alright.

282
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,182
You boys wait outside.

283
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,192
Well, uh. What do you got for me?

284
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,331
Pretty good, huh?

285
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,257
Did you do all the serial numbers?

286
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,302
Random, just like you requested.

287
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,810
That is a good one.

288
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,189
Thank you, love.

289
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,532
Smudgy.

290
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,413
Well, that's just the last test run. It just takes a while 
to get the ink consistency right.

291
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,791
What? You mean we can't use these?

292
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,627
No, we should burn them.

293
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,221
That's a shame.

294
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,111
There's an incinerator at the warehouse.

295
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,283
You'll, uh

296
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,869
You'll have them by tonight.

297
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,329
Yeah, it'll be done.

298
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,635
Dreg.

299
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:13,770
When Mr. Berman finishes, I want you to finish him.

300
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,608
Okay, bye.

301
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,778
I'll see you at home.

302
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,572
Don't count on it.

303
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,701
Moss wants to talk to you.

304
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,846
That little altercation you had in the 
parking lot the other night.

305
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,268
Don't ever let that happen again.

306
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,937
You understand me?

307
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,565
Yes, sir.

308
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,580
You'll get your chance.

309
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,373
You promise?

310
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,171
Enjoy yourself.

311
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,472
You're dropping your shoulder.

312
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,685
Hi Dave.

313
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,562
You should know.

314
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,981
How are you doing Josh?

315
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,692
Gettin' by.

316
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,527
How about yourself?

317
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,571
Doing okay.

318
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,032
You, uh

319
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,952
You wanna come over for dinner tonight?

320
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,915
Thanks, but maybe some other time.

321
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,393
What are you doing?

322
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,895
Changing.

323
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,273
I can see that. Why?

324
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,192
So we can spar.

325
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,445
You just won a big tournament.

326
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,739
What do you want to come down and spar me for?

327
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,866
Because you're the only person that ever beats me.

328
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,452
Not interested.

329
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:20,289
Come on Josh. You gave up competing 
because I always got first place.

330
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,166
Some from badly judging.

331
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,335
Here's your chance.

332
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,337
There's no judges.

333
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,464
What do you say?

334
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,260
I won't spar.

335
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,013
Come on, Josh. You're as good as I was, probably better.

336
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,474
We both know that.

337
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,728
Do we?

338
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,563
What happened to your eye?

339
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,773
Nothing, it was an accident.

340
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,901
I was serious, I don't want to spar, okay?

341
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,029
Sure, we can wait.

342
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,497
This guy you sparred at the tournament?

343
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,751
Bobby Souk?

344
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,962
What do you know about him?

345
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,715
Not much.

346
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,967
Except for he hates losing.

347
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,641
What's for dinner?

348
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,149
What are you doing?

349
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,818
Geez, you scared me.

350
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,529
I was just destroying the test batch.

351
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,198
What the fuck are you hiding?

352
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,243
Nothing.

353
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,161
I was just

354
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:26,040
Don't give me that shit. I asked you a question.

355
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,379
Okay, okay

356
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,548
I took a few of the twenties.

357
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,259
I'll burn them. I swear.

358
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,469
Yeah, you're gonna burn them.

359
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,180
And then

360
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,104
we're gonna burn you.

361
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,706
I got him, I got him.

362
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,419
Get in there.

363
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,086
Get him!

364
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,170
He's on the other side.

365
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,755
There he is!

366
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,132
Get him!

367
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,888
Go! Get him!

368
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,727
Get him. Get him!

369
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,020
Goddamn it.

370
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,664
Alright, come on.

371
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,874
Damn it!

372
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,253
Go, go , go, get him.

373
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,090
Come on, there he is!

374
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,508
He went left!

375
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,426
Get him!

376
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,393
Hey, I left something in the studio give me your keys.

377
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,604
I'll get it.

378
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,314
Just give me the keys, Josh.

379
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,862
Don't forget to lock it.

380
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,795
Get him!

381
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,797
Come on, come on!

382
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,174
Get him!

383
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,592
Son of a bitch.

384
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,867
Get him!

385
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,370
Get him! Take him down!

386
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,765
You shouldn't have ran.

387
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,019
Now we're gonna have to make this painful.

388
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,939
That's for the two by four.

389
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,566
And that's for pissing me off.

390
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,569
Hey, let him go.

391
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,946
What'd you say?

392
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,201
I said let him go.

393
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,455
This ain't none of your business.

394
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,707
So, why don't you just move on

395
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,043
and you ain't gonna get hurt.

396
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,800
I'm not gonna tell you again.

397
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,055
Yeah, you got that right.

398
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,848
Kick his ass.

399
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,808
Fuckin, son of a bitch.

400
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,983
You asshole!

401
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,834
Shut up!

402
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,671
Now we play for real.

403
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,257
What are you gonna do?

404
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,093
You gonna shoot me?

405
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,719
You're smarter than you look

406
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,971
Blow him away Dreg, blow this mother fucker away

407
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,264
Shut up!

408
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,935
First I'm going to teach him a little lesson

409
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,312
How's that sound?

410
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,730
Painful.

411
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,192
I like that word.

412
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,569
Oh, I do like that word.

413
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,657
You're right. This is gonna be painful.

414
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,244
Not for me.

415
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,703
For you.

416
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,562
He's dead.

417
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:47,987
Let's get out of here.

418
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,574
What about the cops?

419
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,245
He's dead. He's dead for godsake, come on.

420
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,325
Look, you were right.

421
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,118
We have to call the cops.

422
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,287
Forget it. Just go.

423
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,914
We have to tell them.

424
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,960
Fine. But we do it from a payphone. Now just go.

425
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,631
Remember it's anonymous.

426
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,590
I know.

427
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,888
9-1-1 is this an emergency?

428
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,473
Yeah, someone's been shot.

429
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,475
You're reporting a shooting?

430
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,645
Yeah, in an alley near 6th avenue south and king street.

431
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,730
Sir, did you witness the shooting?

432
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,315
Yeah, I did.

433
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,192
Where are you calling from?

434
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,986
We're at a convenience store

435
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,530
Are you crazy?

436
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,073
We have to tell them.

437
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,074
No.

438
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,367
Why not?

439
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,245
It could have been a drug deal.

440
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,581
It was self defense, Josh.

441
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,085
No cops, you got that?

442
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,920
Now, I'm outta here.

443
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,422
Where you going?

444
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,926
I'm gonna take a little walk, and then I'm gonna go home.

445
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,387
I suggest you do the same.

446
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,598
Josh, what are you afraid of?

447
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,392
Go home!

448
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,269
Josh.

449
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,521
Josh!

450
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,960
Shit.

451
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,551
Fuck. Shit!

452
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,014
[Coughing]

453
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,914
Who were they?

454
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,666
I don't know.

455
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:09,104
They took my money.

456
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,150
I want it back.

457
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,627
What is that?

458
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,505
Martial arts academy.

459
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,466
They're just around the corner.

460
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,310
Hi.

461
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,984
Where's Josh?

462
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,903
He's not coming.

463
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,239
Why not?

464
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,994
Did you even ask him?

465
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,789
I said he's not coming.

466
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,708
Great.

467
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,203
Hey

468
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,043
Is this the guy?

469
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,254
Oh, yeah

470
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,424
That's him.

471
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,441
Hey, we're almost out of beer.

472
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,525
Shit, you got any money?

473
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,902
No. You got any money?

474
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,695
There it is right there.

475
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,738
Check it out Frank.

476
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,864
Right on.

477
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,242
Ask and you shall receive.

478
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,791
Check this out.

479
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,763
The fucks your hurry, asshole?

480
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,348
Pardon me.

481
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,975
Next time watch where you're walking.

482
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,733
I almost forgot, give us your money.

483
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,161
You mean this?

484
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,288
You don't mind do you?

485
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,833
Not at all.

486
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,195
Hello?

487
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,448
Josh?

488
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,414
Hello, Josh are you here?

489
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,085
Josh, you here?

490
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,712
So, we meet again.

491
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,798
What are you doing here?

492
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,758
We got ourselves a problem.

493
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,802
What are you talking about?

494
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,350
That's enough.

495
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,978
Tape him up and search him.

496
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,143
Dave.

497
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,687
No, it's Josh. Where's Dave?

498
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,022
I don't know.

499
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,858
He left a couple of hours ago without telling me anything.

500
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:10,734
Josh, what happened with you guys

501
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,152
I'll call you back.

502
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,239
Josh?

503
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,022
Give me the police.

504
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,570
We could keep this up all day.

505
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,073
But it's gettin a little old.

506
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,034
So

507
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,453
Where's the money?

508
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,752
You know

509
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,881
truth is, this isn't even the torture part.

510
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,677
That happens later at the warehouse.

511
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,976
You know, I don't even care where the money is.

512
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,188
I'm doing this for the hell of it.

513
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,403
Jack, get this fucker off me.

514
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,406
Goddamn it!

515
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,075
Get the fuck outta my way.

516
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,036
You're gonna regret that.

517
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,878
Alright, let's go over this one more time.

518
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:59,759
You came home, the door was open and his
 car was here, so you think someone kidnapped 
your brother, is that what you're saying?

519
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,595
Yeah.

520
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,388
And your brother,

521
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,391
he's also a fifth degree blackbelt?

522
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:08,810
Yeah.

523
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,936
I see.

524
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:15,525
And you think this is related to the dead body you, 
annonymously reported last night?

525
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,111
Yeah.

526
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,280
The one we couldn't find.

527
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,703
How many times do we have to go through this?

528
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,831
Mr. Conner I'm three hours into overtime this morning.

529
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:33,710
I don't know what kind of game you're 
trying to play, but I'm not interested.

530
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,338
Now why don't you just tell me what's really going on?

531
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,465
My brother's gone.

532
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,674
Someone took him.

533
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,968
Now what are you gonna do about it?

534
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:45,347
You don't even have a motive. Why would someone take him?

535
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,228
I don't know.

536
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:56,650
Lieutenant, we've got a homicide downtown. 
They want you to stop by for a quick look.

537
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,776
Great.

538
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,779
Look, there's no evidence of foul play.

539
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,782
There's nothing I can do about it for 24 hours.

540
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,700
Let's go.

541
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,578
Lieutenant

542
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,121
What?

543
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,749
Please.

544
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,044
He's my twin brother.

545
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,558
Ray Tobin.

546
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:33,311
He knows the streets around here, give him a try.

547
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:32,912
Yeah?

548
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,498
Pitts gave me your name.

549
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,676
What's this bullshit about Pitts. 
Start talking motherfucker!

550
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,805
Josh.

551
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,683
Ray.

552
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,478
What are you doing here?

553
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,897
Geez, man, I thought you were dead.

554
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,192
What the hell is going on?

555
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,240
It's a long story, man. Someday I'll tell you about it.

556
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,826
Why did you change your name?

557
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,620
Same story.

558
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,250
Hey babe, would you grab a couple beers?

559
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:19,709
Sure.

560
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,127
Thanks.

561
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,552
So you talked to Pitts.

562
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,554
Yeah.

563
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,306
Why?

564
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,227
Dave

565
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,145
he's missing.

566
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,106
What? Someone took him?

567
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,732
He's not an easy target.

568
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,194
Nobody's seen him.

569
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,118
I'll be in the shower.

570
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,169
Any ideas who?

571
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,755
No.

572
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,974
I'll ask around. That's the best I can do for ya.

573
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:22,438
You're sitting there drinking a beer, 
and my brother could be dead.

574
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,525
I can't believe this.

575
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,403
Hey,

576
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,781
I'm kinda busy right now.

577
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,326
And you're not even sure he's gone.

578
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,414
Give me a call when you know something.

579
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,964
You know

580
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,176
We worked out together for over ten years Ray.

581
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,891
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

582
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,899
It's not that easy Josh.

583
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,526
There's a lot of things you don't know.

584
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,822
Likewise.

585
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:46,958
It's Josh.

586
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,460
Meet me at the school.

587
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,185
Come on, tough guy. Gimme a good one.

588
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,112
Enjoying yourself?

589
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,076
He talked yet?

590
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,536
No, nothing.

591
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:28,666
Alright, come on boys get him outta here 
before someone starts to hear him.

592
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,419
Come on, come on, come on.

593
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,796
Take him out the side door.

594
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,634
Good, I want you to take him down to the warehouse. I'll 
meet you down there later on the 19th.

595
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,427
What if he doesn't talk?

596
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,220
Then you kill him.

597
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,766
Slowly.

598
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,324
Come on, Eli.

599
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:18,591
Yeah?

600
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,469
Josh, they're taking Dave to a warehouse. 
They're gonna kill him.

601
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,762
Allison, where are you?

602
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,765
I'm across from World Karate. They're gonna kill him.

603
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,684
Put it down.

604
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,185
Allison.

605
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,646
Allison!

606
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,527
What the hell is going on?

607
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,278
What happened to Dave?

608
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,823
They've got them both now.

609
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,615
What are you talking about?

610
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:43,783
Just come with me.

611
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,660
I'll tell you in the car.

612
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,294
Oh, must have not been wearing your safety glasses.

613
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,214
You can get hurt around this place.

614
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,217
A lot of heavy machinery, a lot of sharp tools.

615
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,303
Kind of a dangerous place, yeah.

616
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,186
I wanna know where that money is.

617
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,564
I didn't take your money.

618
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,402
You, uh

619
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,531
Do you remember that guy from the alley?

620
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:40,381
You were the last one to see him alive and he had our money,
 and guess what, he doesn't have it now.

621
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,175
So that means you do.

622
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,218
And I want it.

623
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,519
You just take a minute.

624
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,022
Think about it.

625
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,411
Put your shirt on.

626
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:11,829
I've got a class.

627
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,581
You teach it, come on.

628
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,542
Come on, come on.

629
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,538
Ready, position. Stepping back.

630
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,331
Outside blow.

631
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:01,170
Reverse punch, front kick. Forward. Back to ready.

632
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,846
Wait here.

633
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,849
Don't give me that shit. I'm coming with you.

634
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,435
Ready position. Stepping back.

635
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:19,689
Outside blow. Reverse punch.

636
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:24,068
Front kick. Stepping back. Ready position.

637
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:27,905
One more time. Outside blow.

638
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,615
Hold it.

639
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,702
Can I help you?

640
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,454
I'm looking for my brother.

641
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,373
I haven't seen him.

642
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,876
I didn't tell you what he looks like.

643
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,131
Like I said, I haven't seen him.

644
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:48,342
Where's the warehouse?

645
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,387
I think you better leave.

646
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,514
Not until I get my answer.

647
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,143
Kay. Have it your own way.

648
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,229
Alright.

649
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:45,733
Look, even if I knew, I still wouldn't tell you.

650
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,612
That's too bad.

651
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,786
Goddamn it.

652
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,954
Why did they take Dave?

653
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,958
I don't know.

654
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,880
Are they gonna kill him?

655
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,384
They're gonna try.

656
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,219
Come on.

657
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,819
We're going to the police.

658
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,362
I already did.

659
01:06:31,987 --> 01:06:33,531
They won't help us.

660
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,574
What do you mean, they won't help us?

661
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,618
We don't have any proof.

662
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,205
What do you call that?

663
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,689
They caught her talking to somebody.

664
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,483
I wanna know who.

665
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:18,534
Why, baby? Why'd you do it?

666
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,079
Why don't you just mind your own business.

667
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:25,207
Now who were you talking to?

668
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,126
Get your hands off me

669
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,713
Come on. It doesn't have to be this way.

670
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,424
Just tell me who.

671
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,801
Go fuck yourself.

672
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:43,017
Look, they're gonna kill you if you don't give me a name.

673
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,436
Mmhm.

674
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,396
That's better.

675
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,775
Come here.

676
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:18,010
I'm gonna have to let our friend Eli handle it from here.

677
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,437
She's all yours, Eli.

678
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:32,483
All I wants a name.

679
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,507
She's here because of you!

680
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:01,303
And I am holding you personally responsible 
for any damage that's done.

681
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,890
Do you see all those damn plates down?

682
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,976
Had enough fuck ups for the night!

683
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,644
What about Conner?

684
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,355
Just find the money.

685
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:36,755
Uh, oh. Geez. Pull over.

686
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:37,423
What?

687
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,173
Pullover right here.

688
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:38,757
Why?

689
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:39,300
Pullover.

690
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,676
Okay, okay

691
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:43,762
What's wrong?

692
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,849
That car back there, stay here I'll check it out.

693
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,684
Josh, what? Josh.

694
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,978
Keep it running.

695
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,621
You left the door open, I figured you'd be back.

696
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,956
Any word on Dave?

697
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:11,832
No.

698
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:17,254
I wanted to talk to you about that money you spent 
at the cafe last night. You know about that?

699
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,089
What about it?

700
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,758
Where'd you get it?

701
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,385
I found it.

702
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:26,055
Put your hands up against the wall, you're under arrest.

703
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:28,057
You've gotta be joking.

704
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,977
I said, up against the wall.

705
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,111
Gimme your left hand.

706
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,836
Go, go!

707
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,053
This is twelve-charlie-four.

708
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,388
Go ahead, twelve charlie four.

709

Have all units on the look out for an 
early ninties Honda. License

Repeat that last part.

711

Forget it.

A real pretty girl.

715
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,022
You're a real pretty girl.

716
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,152
Sick fuck.

717
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:06,989
Yeah. That's why they hired me.

718
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:09,533
But I grow on ya.

01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,077
You know what I mean?

720
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:15,080
Let's see what we got here.

721
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,294
You like it rough?

722
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,590
Yeah, I bet you like it that way. Ain't that so?

723
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:32,181
Don't you fucking touch her.

724
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:39,021
You had your chance.

725
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,744
Now you're all mine.

726
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,385
Get rid of Berman's body.

727
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,596

It's Josh Conner.

731
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,534
What do you want? Who's she?

732
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,494
Karen. Dave's wife.

733
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:38,497
This is Ray something.

734
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,292
Make yourself at home.

735

We need your help. They've got Dave at a warehouse.

736

They're gonna kill him.

737

01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,193
The people who run World Karate and Kung Fu.

739
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:11,864
They're new in town.

740
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,867
How do you know it's them?

741
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,120
I was just there.

742
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,914
Anything left of him?

743
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,334
Look, we just need to find that warehouse.

744
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,341
Why don't you call Lieutenant Pitts.

745
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,137
Because now the cops are after me.

746
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:38,765
Why?

747
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:54,781
I took some money off a dead guy last night.

748
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,159
You what?

749
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:59,369
Did you tell Pitts?

750
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,290
No.

751
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,167
What'd you do with the money, Josh?

752
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:09,338
I've still got it.

753
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,381
Let me see it.

754
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,889
You shit.

755
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,559
They're gonna kill him because of you.

756
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:24,102
You fuck.

757
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:32,861
No wonder Pitts wants to talk to you.

758
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,155
This moneys counterfit.

759
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,620
But you're right about one thing.

760
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:44,373
They're gonna kill him to get this back.

761
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,211
If this shit hits the streets

762
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,464
this towns gonna be crawling with FBI and secret service.

763
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:56,051
And you can bet whoever printed this 
money doesn't want that to happen.

764
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:59,805
Just tell me where the goddamn warehouse is.

765
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,891
My guess is South King, 4th and 5th street.

766
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,519
That area is deserted at night.

767
01:16:06,561 --> 01:16:08,355
I hope you're right.

768
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:18,740
I owe you.

769
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:23,203
You got any fire power?

770
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:26,665
I don't need a gun.

771
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:32,045
Hey, tough guy, in case you don't realize it this ain't no 
sparring match. These guys play for keeps.

772
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,255
So do I.

773
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:36,049
Your fifth degree isn't gonna stop a bullet.

774
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,176
We don't have a choice.

775
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:40,387
You interested?

776
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,516
Yeah.

777
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,270
But we're gonna play it my way.

778
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,691
We don't give these guys a second chance.

779
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,276
Got it?

780
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,954
Two mil?

781
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,081
Two million.

782
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,500
How's the quality?

783
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,587
See for yourself.

784
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,146
Thread structure is good.

785
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:39,696
But the colors a bit off.

786
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,658
The colors fine.

787
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,711
Fifteen cents on the dollar.

788
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,465
We agreed on twenty.

789
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:02,260
I expected a higher quality.

790
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,430
Fifteen cents on the dollar.

791
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,391
Take it or leave it.

792
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:20,821
You think you're pretty smart, don't you tough guy?

793
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,244
How's your eye?

794
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,087
Looks like your times up.

795
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,299
You're gonna die tonight.

796
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:22,716
Three inch stainless.

797
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:25,635
Goddamn that's impressive.

798
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:28,847
Yes, that's very impressive Mr. Moss.

799
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:31,850
But I'm afraid if you won't agree to the terms

800
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:34,853
my business here is concluded.

801
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,105
Concluded?

802
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,234
Concluded?

803
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:45,280
Well, I'll tell you what

804
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:49,910
Mr. Dubai

805
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:54,581
You agreed to twenty.

806
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:55,957
Now

807
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,461
either you accept those terms,

808
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:03,089
or you're concluded.

809
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:12,891
Okay, you son of a bitch!

810
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:14,976
Twenty!

811
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:30,325
So what's your story?

812
01:20:36,414 --> 01:20:40,877
About five years ago I walked in on a big drug buy.

813
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:45,340
In the back of some rundown bar.

814
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:51,805
I tried to walk out the same way I came in.

815
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:58,353
One of the buyers came at me with a gun.

816
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:06,194
I broke his neck. I shot one of the dealers.

817
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:13,493
That dealer turned out to be an undercover cop.

818
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,961
Lieutenant Pitts was the first on the scene.

819
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:27,924
And when the rest of the cops arrived they put me in cuffs.

820
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,887
And they worked me over real good.

821
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,644
After a few days

822
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:43,607
they made me an offer.

823
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:48,862
Work for them and they'd drop the charges.

824
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,457
Are you a bleeder?

825
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,213
I bet you're a bleeder.

826
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,593
Yeah

827
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:19,142
I want a name.

828
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:32,656
Okay. Please stop.

829
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,742
I'll give you a name.

830
01:22:36,826 --> 01:22:38,703
Let's hear it.

831
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,543
There's the warehouse complex up ahead here.

832
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,145
Did you get an answer?

833
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:06,648
Who?

834
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,608
Conner.

835
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:11,236
Conner?

836
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:12,862
Dave Conner.

837
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,199
You dumb fuck.

838
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:19,077
I want you to kill the bitch.

839
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,705
And make it painful.

840
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:53,319
You think you're one funny bitch, don't you?

841
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,778
Wait here for a minute, I'm gonna go check it out.

842
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:44,245
Was he telling the truth?

843
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:45,914
Yeah.

844
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:47,916
It all fits.

845
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:05,433
They think Dave has their money.

846
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,436
I know.

847
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,648
But I promise I'll get him out.

848
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,442
Alive?

849
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:17,403
If I have to kill ever last one of them.

850
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,545
How you doin asshole?

851
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,924
You're very persistent.

852
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,474
And you're very dead.

853
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,394
Is this about Ricky?

854
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:51,896
Well, you broke his neck.

855
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:53,982
I didn't have a choice.

856
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,608
Neither do I.

857
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,193
Yeah, that's it.

858
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:58,945
Go for your gun.

859
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:05,785
[Gun Shot]

860
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:07,620
Josh.

861
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,341
Ray.

862
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:24,345
Ray.

863
01:26:29,058 --> 01:26:32,061
They're playing for keeps, Josh.

864
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:36,733
Don't die on me Ray. No, not again.

865
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:47,744
Slowly.

866
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:56,878
Twins.

867
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,894
Find a phone, call Lieutenant Pitts.

868
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:15,355
Tell him there's gonna be a massacre.

869
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,571
Take this.

870
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,823
Take it!

871
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:34,457
Dreg? Dreg is that you?

872
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:15,456
What the hell is this supposed to be?

873
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:18,209
You told me to bring him to you

874
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:20,503
I really don't have time for this Mr. Moss.

875
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:21,879
Relax.

876
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:27,135
Mr. Conner

877
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:31,431
Your lack of cooperation is most distressing.

878
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:35,268
Now, perhaps my

879
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:38,438
my men have not impressed on you

880
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:40,773
the importance of finding that money.

881
01:28:41,774 --> 01:28:43,693
I don't have your money.

882
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,032
But you know who does.

883
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:51,034
Blow me.

884
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:56,247
Blow me?

885
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:01,461
Shoot the prick.

886
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:08,134
You promised me.

887
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,434
A promise is a promise.

888
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,026
A promise is a promise.

889
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,560
First

890
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,604
I'm gonna give you a little pain.

891
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:04,732
Then I'm gonna kill you.

892
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:37,431
Aw, you little bitch.

893
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:06,335
It's okay. It's just me.

894
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:10,798
I'm gonna get you out of here.

895
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,425
I'm going with you.

896
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:14,677
It's too dangerous.

897
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:16,012
Bullshit.

898
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:17,847
It's payback time.

899
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,912
Hey, I gotta use the phone.

900
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:44,081
I really need to use this phone.

901
01:31:44,707 --> 01:31:46,584
Back off, bitch.

902
01:31:49,086 --> 01:31:51,005
People are so pushy.

903
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:52,882
Uh, huh.

904
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,218
Well when did you wanna do that?

905
01:31:56,427 --> 01:31:58,429
Oh, that sounds great.

906
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,725
Ok, so we'll go get the guys

907
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:04,101
uh, huh.

908
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,813
It's your choice.

909
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:10,858
I'll call you back.

910
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:27,226
Let's see what you've got. Come on.

911
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:57,006
This is too easy.

912
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:00,176
You shoot him, he don't fight.

913
01:34:03,637 --> 01:34:04,889
You hear that?

914
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:08,059
These people want a show, now you gonna give it to them?

915
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,758
Come on, Bobby!

916
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,141
Come on!

917
01:35:33,018 --> 01:35:34,729
What do you want me to do with him?

918
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,191
Break his neck.

919
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:48,284
Why don't you try me?

920
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:57,752
You want your money?

921
01:35:58,377 --> 01:35:59,336
Yeah.

922
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:01,464
You give me a go with him.

923
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:03,799
Then we'll talk about it.

924
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,802
Be my guest.

925
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:28,949
Look out.

926
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:40,539
Come on.

927
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:21,497
Get up! Get up.

928
01:39:22,247 --> 01:39:23,749
Come on, Bobby.

929
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:41,642
First time, do you, don't do him.

930
01:39:55,447 --> 01:39:57,491
You think that's gonna stop me?

931
01:39:59,451 --> 01:40:00,703
Yeah.

932
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:05,124
You put up a pretty good fight.

933
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:06,834
But uh

934
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:10,295
business is business.

935
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:13,465
Now where's the money?

936
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:19,221
We all walk outta here, then I'll tell you where to find it.

937
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:23,892
No deal.

938
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:26,854
I'll uh

939
01:40:28,021 --> 01:40:30,065
I'll shoot him first.

940
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:34,778
Now, which Karate move is it that stops a bullet?

941
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:36,905
How about this one?

942
01:41:03,056 --> 01:41:05,059
It's okay. It's over.

943
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:12,065
Now listen, Allison.

944
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:13,901
It's okay.

945
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:33,420
You stupid fuck.

946
01:41:35,714 --> 01:41:38,717
[Gun Shot]

947
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:26,056
Police, everybody freeze!
