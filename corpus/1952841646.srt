1
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,109
<i>I'm just a kid.</i>

2
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,016
<i>There's a lot I don't know.</i>

3
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,076
<i>But one thing I do know...</i>

4
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,451
<i>is my folks never</i>
<i>should have married.</i>

5
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,357
<i>And they definitely should've</i>
<i>never had a kid.</i>

6
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,163
<i>But they did. That happens.</i>

7
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,862
<i>The randomness of life</i>
<i>and all that.</i>

8
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,431
When the chicken's up, I'm gonna
go out back and work on my boat.

9
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,698
<i>Maybe they started out trying</i>
<i>to be good parents. I don't know.</i>

10
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,911
<i>But my very first</i>
<i>memory in life is...</i>

11
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,579
<i>how much my father</i>
<i>loved that damn boat.</i>

12
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:35,047
<i>Here he is hundreds of miles</i>
<i>away from any real water.</i>

13
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,915
<i>And even then we're talking</i>
<i>about the Gulf of Mexico.</i>

14
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,827
<i>Just seemed sad to me, somehow.</i>

15
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,064
<i>And my mom has been psychotically</i>
<i>obsessed with movie stars...</i>

16
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,795
<i>to a point that</i>
<i>defies explanation.</i>

17
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,407
I could use a bath.

18
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,308
Well, go take a bath.

19
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,513
<i>Note that she was going</i>
<i>to take a bath...</i>

20
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,011
<i>the shower was</i>
<i>out of the question because...</i>

21
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,082
<i>two years ago</i>
<i>some pipe in our shower broke.</i>

22
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,518
<i>My father could've fixed it...</i>

23
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,057
<i>but he was so tied up</i>
<i>working on the boat...</i>

24
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,758
<i>he hired this</i>
<i>Marlon Brando plumber instead.</i>

25
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,632
<i>And the shower never got fixed...</i>

26
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,800
<i>as if it just</i>
<i>never happened.</i>

27
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,070
<i>Then there was</i>
<i>the Paul Newman thing...</i>

28
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,873
<i>when our roof needed fixing.</i>

29
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,154
<i>And, of course...</i>

30
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,159
<i>our roofing problem</i>
<i>never got fixed, either.</i>

31
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,934
<i>And how could I forget the day</i>
<i>Audrey Hepburn came over...</i>

32
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,969
<i>to help my mom</i>
<i>with the books.</i>

33
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,700
<i>On second thought, I'd really</i>
<i>rather not get into that one.</i>

34
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,478
<i>It's not their fault,</i>
<i>if you think about it.</i>

35
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,673
<i>It's not like they sat down</i>
<i>and had this conference about...</i>

36
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,413
<i>whether they'd get married</i>
<i>and bear a son or not.</i>

37
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,148
<i>Anyway...</i>

38
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:22,088
<i>the story is that years ago</i>
<i>my father was a traveling salesman...</i>

39
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,130
<i>that just happened to stop</i>
<i>on one Christmas Eve.</i>

40
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,304
<i>My mother was engaged to the son</i>
<i>of a pharmacist over at Lubbock...</i>

41
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,903
<i>and he chose the night</i>
<i>of the Christmas dance...</i>

42
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,038
<i>to confess he'd fallen in love with</i>
<i>this cheerleader from Texas Tech.</i>

43
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,383
I sure could use
a hot cup of coffee.

44
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,410
I just made a fresh pot.

45
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,594
<i>So, she was vulnerable</i>
<i>that night.</i>

46
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,627
<i>You can't blame her for that.</i>

47
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,377
That is some good,
good coffee!

48
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,043
Thank you.

49
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,406
And that's a handsome coat.

50
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,377
To say nothing of your pretty dress,
which I love, by the way...

51
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,316
because of the way
it matches your eyes.

52
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,248
Not exactly.

53
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,218
Well, of course not exactly,
it'd be too obvious.

54
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,221
We both know that's not
the kind of woman you are.

55
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,932
<i>Was their meeting some fated day</i>
<i>that would magically find us...</i>

56
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,971
<i>happy one day,</i>
<i>like a real family?</i>

57
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,034
<i>No, it's not the way</i>
<i>things work.</i>

58
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,839
<i>That much, I figured out.</i>

59
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,785
<i>My mother had just come from seeing</i>
<i>"Splendor in the Grass", I think.</i>

60
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,522
<i>She went to the movies every day,</i>
<i>and we only had one theater, so...</i>

61
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,883
<i>whatever was playing.</i>

62
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,927
<i>That's when it happened...</i>

63
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,992
<i>and it changed my life forever.</i>

64
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,901
Help me.
Better get her inside.

65
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,719
Hospital says
it will be about a week...

66
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,245
till we can get her down to Galvenston
where her grandparents live.

67
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,385
We appreciate
you taking her in like this.

68
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,787
- It's the right thing to do.
- Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

69
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,525
<i>It's strange.</i>

70
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,625
<i>My folks can't remember</i>
<i>they're married half the time...</i>

71
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:55,571
<i>and for them I'm just</i>
<i>a ghost flipping around the place.</i>

72
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,405
<i>Then they go and agree</i>
<i>to take in this girl...</i>

73
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,941
<i>whose parents died</i>
<i>in the accident...</i>

74
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,677
<i>'till she got better.</i>

75
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,092
Come in, please.

76
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,271
Brought you stuff for dinner.

77
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,980
Are you aware I have
a partially lacerated liver?

78
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,909
Do you even have the slightest concept
of what that does to one's appetite?

79
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:16,889
Not really.

80
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,521
My liver is
partially lacerated but...

81
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,122
I don't have a clue
what it does to your appetite.

82
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,097
It probably can't help.

83
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,102
I'm not hungry.

84
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,076
OK.

85
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,008
I'll just leave it here for you.

86
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,582
My parents' bodies were
sent back to Amarillo...

87
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,247
for burial, I take it.

88
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,994
How was the accidente listed
on the official police report?

89
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,130
Speeding...

90
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,565
driving while intoxicated?

91
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,061
I'm not really sure.

92
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,806
My father was a heavy drinker,
you know.

93
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:10,776
No, I...

94
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,703
didn't know that.

95
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,175
Well, now you do.

96
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,774
That was one goddamn accident,
that's for sure.

97
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,055
What?

98
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,381
You never heard
anyone cuss before?

99
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,252
Well, yeah, but...

100
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,691
not from a girl.

101
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,120
Well, I'm very flawed.

102
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,325
Extremely flawed,
if you want to know the truth.

103
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,346
<i>I looked up the word</i>
<i>"flawed" in the dictionary.</i>

104
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:54,485
<i>I kind of knew what it meant but,</i>
<i>after reading the definition...</i>

105
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,588
<i>I began to wonder if</i>
<i>maybe I was flawed, too.</i>

106
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,290
<i>But the strangest part was</i>
<i>that for the first time in my life...</i>

107
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,093
<i>I started to feel something</i>
<i>for someone other than myself.</i>

108
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,468
<i>It scared the hell out of me,</i>
<i>if you want to know the truth.</i>

109
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,034
<i>But I liked it.</i>

110
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,523
You were screaming.

111
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,510
It's late.

112
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,177
You should go back to sleep.

113
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,002
Jesus!

114
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,767
You're not screwing
with me, are you?

115
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,198
- What?
- You seem to like me...

116
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,833
which is fine, because
I like you, too, but...

117
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,471
if you're acting like you do
because my parents are dead...

118
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,776
and you feel sorry for me,
then that's just bullshit.

119
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,583
- Hello?
- No.

120
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,987
I'm not screwing with you.
I like you, too.

121
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,115
Good.

122
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,586
I think it's time
for us to leave.

123
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,990
Leave?

124
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,332
Look, those two people
you live with...

125
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,665
- they're nice and everything...
- My parents?

126
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,867
Right.

127
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,975
But from what I can tell...

128
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,540
they don't really have
anything to offer you...

129
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,942
and they certainly
don't have a thing to offer me.

130
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,718
So, where are we going?

131
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,349
Baltimore.

132
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,153
I have an aunt
and an uncle there.

133
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,687
I haven't seen them
since I was five but...

134
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,288
from what I can remember,
they're extremely hip.

135
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,363
But I thought when you got better
you were going to go...

136
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,231
live with your grandparents
in Galvenston.

137
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,608
Look...

138
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,607
Ben...

139
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,545
there's what happens to you in life
and there's what you make happen.

140
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,042
It's the difference
between having a plan and not.

141
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,110
- Do you see what I'm driving at here?
- Yeah. I think so.

142
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,655
Good.

143
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:50,528
Well, I'm used to getting up
at the break of day...

144
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,264
being all melodramatic
about this.

145
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,752
How much did you get?

146
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,352
25 bucks.

147
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,959
Well, it's 25 more bucks
than we had before.

148
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,389
That's true.

149
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,603
See, a real plan is more
than just some pipe dream.

150
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,137
Pipe dream?

151
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,211
A pipe dream is
an unrealistic fantasy...

152
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,288
that deludes oneself into thinking
that it's an actual plan.

153
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,953
It's a very
popular expression.

154
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,919
I'm surprised you've never
heard of it before.

155
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,693
I didn't say I never heard it.

156
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,286
Anyway, a real plan
is an actual goal...

157
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,128
that you believe in enough
to create a set of circumstances...

158
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,666
which leads you to
and into a plan.

159
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,139
- Do you understand?
- Where do you come with this stuff?

160
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:54,344
I mean, what part of your brain
works so hard...

161
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,380
that it makes you
think and talk like that?

162
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,211
My father was a professor
with a very wide vocabulary...

163
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,751
and lots of unique ideas.

164
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,151
When he wasn't teaching
the students, he taught me.

165
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,887
So, what did your mom do?

166
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,353
She never did anything.

167
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,739
You know...

168
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,774
I think most
of what you say is true.

169
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,541
Some I just don't understand.

170
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,777
But I also think you like
to screw with people's heads.

171
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,610
I may be wrong sometimes...

172
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,722
but I won't ever
screw with your head.

173
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,650
Ever.

174
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,784
Me, too.

175
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,650
Ever.

176
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,604
Take a look at our
new home, farmboy.

177
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:57,776
Here?

178
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,976
See that pan over there?

179
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,939
It's a hoghouse.

180
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,108
Now, why would
a perfectly good hog...

181
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,814
not be outside
on a day like this?

182
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,250
So you're saying
they don't have any more hogs?

183
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,993
I'm making
a calculated deduction.

184
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,523
So, what's your plan?

185
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,834
It's important.

186
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,369
I need to know what kind of plan
you have for your life.

187
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,928
My wife saw you
come in from across the road.

188
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,668
She made you these sandwiches.

189
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,840
There's a well
by the gas tank if...

190
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,239
you need water.

191
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,178
How much do we owe you...

192
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,921
for room,
and board and water?

193
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,385
I imagine going to sleep...

194
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,695
to the smell of pig shit
ought to do it.

195
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,172
OK.

196
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,149
I want to be a pitcher
for the St. Louis Cardinals.

197
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,754
So, you'll be a pitcher
for the Cardinals?

198
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,712
I like that plan.

199
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:57,126
Do you know how many kids my age
want to play in the Major Leagues?

200
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,329
No.

201
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,194
But I don't think it matters.

202
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,962
I'm just saying it's more what you'll
call a pipe dream than an actual plan.

203
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,229
Are you any good?

204
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,672
I'm always the best
in my league.

205
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,801
Is it what you really want to do?

206
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:17,949
Yeah.

207
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:19,949
Yeah.

208
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,486
Then, it's not a pipe dream,
it's a plan.

209
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,455
Learn to embrace it.

210
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,072
Cassie?

211
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,846
Did you know Joe Nuxhall is
the youngest guy ever...

212
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,377
to play for the Major Leagues?

213
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,912
Yeah.

214
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,025
He started pitching for
the Cincinatti Reds at 15.

215
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,754
This is correct. And more than once
you're gonna break his record.

216
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,140
Try hitting the corners. You're putting
everything right down the middle.

217
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,379
I'm not putting everything
right down the middle.

218
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,450
Come on! It's the seventh game
of the World Series.

219
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,951
Bottom of the ninth.

220
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,645
Bases are full,
two out.

221
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:34,817
You've got two strikes up.
One more strike and he's yours.

222
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,487
And you know the only pitch you could
throw is the outside slider...

223
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,293
because that's the only pitch
he won't be expecting.

224
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,368
What?

225
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,800
I don't know how to throw a slider.

226
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,503
You kind of hold it off center...

227
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,272
middle finger on the seam.

228
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,376
Then you throw it
like a pass ball.

229
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,761
Come on, giddy up!

230
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,236
- We don't have all day.
- Coming! Coming!

231
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,390
I think you should
tell me what's going on.

232
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,326
It's not part of the plan.

233
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:53,032
<i>I'm sick of this!</i>
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

234
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:57,139
<i>Say something to me.</i>
<i>I have had years of this. Years!</i>

235
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,067
Now I'm going to town tonight.
That's what's happening.

236
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,407
What's the problem?

237
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,674
Yelling is extremely
destructive to a relationship.

238
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,446
You think you're communicating
at the time but...

239
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,952
the effect is
completely the opposite.

240
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,717
<i>No more talk! We have</i>
<i>nothing left to say.</i>

241
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,123
Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

242
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,528
Yes.

243
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,233
We will never
yell at each other.

244
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,904
Hey, don't make promises
you're not prepared to keep.

245
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,769
- I'm supposed to try it, you know.
- It goes without saying.

246
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,377
But I just said it anyways.

247
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,019
The Hardy Boys.
Now there's some heavy reading.

248
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,457
I like the Hardy Boys.

249
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,202
Come on, let's get some sleep.

250
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,566
Got a big day tomorrow.

251
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,070
What's happening tomorrow?

252
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,482
We're getting married.

253
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,779
Cas...

254
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,492
Yeah.

255
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,221
Are we really
getting married tomorrow?

256
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,232
I mean, actually?

257
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,899
Yes.

258
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,204
It's a major part of the plan.

259
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,940
OK, now.
As I understand it...

260
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,644
you two want to spend
the rest of your lives together...

261
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,079
as husband and wife.

262
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,756
I think we should've done
this days ago...

263
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,186
but you know men
when you rush them.

264
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,725
So...

265
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,302
- do you, Ben...
- Benjamin Reynolds.

266
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,804
Benjamin Reynolds
take this young woman...

267
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:09,931
Cassie Kennington.

268
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,806
Do both of you promise to...

269
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,648
treat each other
with dignity and love till...

270
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,518
one of you drops dead?

271
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:26,949
I do.

272
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,217
I do.

273
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,494
Then...

274
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:51,275
Well, I suspect you're
both married now.

275
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,744
I suspect you're right.

276
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,744
Oh, the ring.

277
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,476
Congratulations to you both.

278
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,009
Well, I feel good
about this whole thing.

279
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,547
How about you?

280
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,177
Yeah, I feel good about it.

281
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,282
Well, I don't have a lot
to compare to, but...

282
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,555
yeah, I feel good.

283
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,134
Oh, if you want to kiss
the bride...

284
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,735
you can do that now.
I guess I forgot to say it.

285
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,722
I haven't kissed anybody before.

286
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,287
Don't worry,
I'm not ready to have sex yet.

287
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,158
Nice looking at that slider.

288
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,334
I still have to practice.

289
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,438
Missus not here?

290
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,777
She's in town
at the library.

291
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,273
She figures I ought
to learn how to write so...

292
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,814
I have something to do
when my baseball career is over.

293
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,083
Sounds good to me.

294
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,595
Sorry, there's not much
padding in my glove.

295
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,896
- You 12 years old?
- I'll be 13 in a few months.

296
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,337
Well...

297
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,979
I got to leave today and...

298
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:51,018
I don't know when I'll be back.
But the wife...

299
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,886
it's fine with her if you two
stay here as long as you need.

300
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,989
Why isn't your wife going
with you?

301
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,020
Well, she...

302
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,630
I'm not a good person,
I don't think.

303
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,842
I've lived a clumsy...

304
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,141
selfish life.

305
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,745
You seem like an OK guy to me.

306
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:28,858
Here you are.

307
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,293
Show me...

308
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,528
that slider
like you did yesterday.

309
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,335
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

310
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,075
Did you start out
thinking you were good...

311
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,714
my age, I mean?

312
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,492
I like to think I did.

313
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,130
To be honest,
I don't really know.

314
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,556
I like that pitch.

315
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,431
What's wrong?

316
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:55,544
I just don't understand
grown-ups sometimes.

317
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:05,278
If that's the lesson to learn,
I think he hates himself.

318
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,663
Come on, let's pack up
and keep moving.

319
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,456
- You two headed somewhere?
- Baltimore.

320
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,465
It's a large city in Maryland.

321
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,898
I got an aunt in Baltimore.

322
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,937
We're in that green station wagon
next to the pissers.

323
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,237
Our dad got
a bladder transplant last month.

324
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,573
Trust me, it's been more like a metal
cook convention than a vacation.

325
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,148
I don't mean to be forward...

326
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,119
but have you have been experiencing
any bladder problems yet, Sheriff?

327
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,655
No, I have not.

328
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,955
Well, you're at the age
when you should think about it.

329
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,321
Ask our dad.

330
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
He's over there screaming
into the urinal right now.

331
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,924
She might be right. You're not
getting any younger, you know.

332
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:38,140
Well, I'd get five years
out of my life if you just...

333
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,778
shut up five minutes.

334
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,929
Get your things
and get in the back.

335
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:18,782
Now...

336
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,181
I don't know much...

337
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,620
but I do know I have
a right to your names.

338
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,053
And I know we have
a right to an attorney...

339
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:30,323
preferably one familiar with the laws
of Arkansas concerning minors.

340
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,825
I'll ask you one more time.

341
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,735
Real slow, real nice.

342
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:41,804
What are your names?

343
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,398
Like I said before...

344
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,241
my husband and I
respectfully plead the 5th.

345
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,710
Hey, chief, why does she keep
calling that boy her husband?

346
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,042
I don't know, Ward,
and I don't care.

347
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,017
Well, we actually got married
last week.

348
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,087
Nice to meet you, by the way.

349
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,854
Raymond Ward.

350
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:01,950
The pleasure is mine.

351
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:06,621
Ward, do you think it's possible
to get past formalities...

352
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,558
and try to figure out
what to do here?

353
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,467
I warn you, put that away before
you blow somebody's head off.

354
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,936
What?

355
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,597
When we get
proper representation...

356
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,609
we'll be more than happy
to give you our names.

357
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,111
Oh, girl.
You're not under arrest.

358
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,576
So, there's no need
for an attorney.

359
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,117
Fine,
then we'll be leaving now.

360
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,947
Please sit down...

361
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,658
and you don't move
until I tell you do.

362
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,455
Am I getting through to you?

363
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,799
Yes, sir.

364
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,906
That goes for the both of you.

365
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,169
You read me, boy?

366
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,080
Yes, sir.

367
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,943
Well, all right.

368
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,945
- What's going on?
- She's having a seizure.

369
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,545
- She what?
- She'll be all right...

370
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,385
unless she swallows her tongue,
and then she could die.

371
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,049
How do you know she's going
to swallow her tongue?

372
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,024
I can't tell from here.

373
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,029
OK, then.

374
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,227
Just get in there and take a look
at her to see if she's swallowed it.

375
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,458
Come on!

376
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,305
Oh God, did she
swallow her tongue?

377
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:57,696
She swallowed it.

378
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,209
Oh Jesus, ain't she
swallowed her tongue!

379
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,801
Get over here!
Come on! Come on!

380
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,448
OK, cradle her head
with your hands.

381
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,810
What's that going to do, bud?

382
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,749
I'm going to try
to pull her tongue out.

383
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:10,982
- OK?
- I don't want her to die.

384
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,020
Listen to me!

385
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,621
Don't move! OK.

386
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,491
- Here we go. Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Get her tongue out.

387
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,723
Ready?

388
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,890
Kid...

389
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,200
Kid!

390
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,063
You son of a...

391
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,439
Kid!

392
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:30,965
<i>Damn it!</i>

393
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,871
I wonder if those cops
are still looking for us.

394
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,975
Or maybe when you leave the state
they don't really care any more.

395
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,770
Not unless you're
in some sort of a crime spree.

396
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,313
I'm pretty sure breaking
out of jail once, you know...

397
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,043
doesn't make it
into a crime spree.

398
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,378
Your brain is accelerating
at such a high rate of speed...

399
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,148
that science is probably
incapable of measuring it.

400
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,282
What?

401
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,061
Are you always going to have
this attitude? I just want to know.

402
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:32,528
As we travel through life, we adopt
many attitudes, as you call them.

403
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,766
That's my theory, anyway.

404
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,874
I think you're hiding
something from me.

405
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,679
I am.

406
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,173
Well...

407
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:45,907
what?

408
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,780
My chastity...

409
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,612
which you will never have,
no matter how much you plead.

410
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,290
Oh, yeah,
like I've been pleading.

411
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,992
That's a laugh!
It's a real big laugh.

412
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,567
Your fast ball
doesn't have the same pop.

413
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,528
I'm throwing against a barn...

414
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,762
probably built
during World War II.

415
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,848
Hey, darling.

416
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,556
Memphis, Tennessee?

417
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,020
Head East till you hit 63...

418
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,763
then go South.
In about two hours you're there.

419
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,597
Jackie boy!
I found ourselves a navigator.

420
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,766
- Where are you two headed?
- Baltimore.

421
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,909
Jack boy! After Memphis,
we're going to Baltimore.

422
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,913
What's the story?

423
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,681
They're taking us to Baltimore.

424
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,156
Could you get the bags?

425
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:01,491
Thanks.

426
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,724
Thrown Newman
had some level...

427
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,824
where's the actual life?

428
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:46,730
Satisfaction will do it, but that's
more awareness than living.

429
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,739
I never thought
about it that way.

430
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,207
So, what made you
become a writer?

431
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,113
I was in love with a woman.

432
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,178
I'd recommend both highly,
but use your judgment...

433
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,379
when dealing with
toxic pleasures of any kind.

434
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,658
Here you go, cowboy.

435
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,412
What about him?
Is he a writer, too?

436
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,945
No, he just lives his life
and everything seems to work out.

437
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,178
Yeah?

438
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,997
Sure is nice being up bright
and early to take in the new day!

439
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,201
Yeah. That's what they say.

440
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,167
Where are we, anyways?

441
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,809
Life in Hell, Kentucky.

442
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,078
By the way,
did I ever thank you?

443
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:40,142
Because it'd be way too comfortable
for me and my body...

444
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,775
to be in a nice warm bus...

445
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,616
heading exactly where
we want to be going.

446
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:52,123
We're married, you know. That's
supposed to count for something.

447
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,757
He was a nice guy, sweet talked.

448
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,030
It wasn't like
I kissed him or anything, geez!

449
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,803
You know? Whatever!

450
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,304
Jealousy.

451
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,076
It's a good trait
to have in a husband...

452
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:12,138
unless of course he gets
overly possessive.

453
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,273
Why don't you just
rest your tired ass...

454
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,444
and let me make the calls
for a little while?

455
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,244
Tired ass?

456
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,652
Where's that sweet,
innocent youth I used to know?

457
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,421
Don't you worry about it,
he's in here somewhere.

458
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:25,961
He'd better be.

459
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:17,409
Can you even imagine
Mr. Teenage Maryland...

460
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,345
riding in our car?

461
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,376
Well, I'll be sworn!

462
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,153
And he was fourth runner
for Mr. Teen America.

463
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,246
Mr. Teenage America!

464
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,288
Tell us about it, son.
We got all the time in the world.

465
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,324
- Is Maryland your home state?
- Let him tell it.

466
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,091
Actually my cousin's got
all the stories.

467
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:38,990
Did you know that last month she
walked across the state of Kentucky...

468
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,696
on her hands?

469
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:44,535
She doesn't look like she's in shape
to the corner from what I see.

470
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,406
That's how she got hurt.

471
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,575
She was just a mile
from the border...

472
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,810
when this cow just broke through
a fence and started trampling her.

473
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,248
My Goodness!

474
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,681
- Must have been one, what's it called...
- Brahman.

475
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:00,221
- Brahmans can be real mean sometimes.
- Let him tell it now.

476
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,656
But she wouldn't stop
till she got to that border...

477
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,429
even though her arm
was fractured in seven places.

478
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,292
"Ripley's Believe it or Not" is
coming to her house next week...

479
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,662
to interview her about it.

480
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,732
- Pull over.
- Pull over?

481
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,600
- We still got a long way to go.
- I said pull over.

482
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,369
I want to get in the back seat
and talk with this child.

483
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,169
"Ripley's Believe it or Not".

484
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,446
Can you even imagine?

485
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,183
Well, I'll be sworn!

486
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,486
Almost there.

487
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,958
Yeah, couple hundred miles.

488
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:13,522
I can't tell you how pleased I am
with the way things have gone so far.

489
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,036
What's going on
with that arm, anyway?

490
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,735
It's all right,
just a little swollen.

491
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,976
Jesus, Cas!

492
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,524
Why can't this wait until
we get to Baltimore?

493
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,731
Because your arm
is about to fall off.

494
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,174
The fracture's healed...

495
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:03,475
there is some severe inflammation
around that cut, young lady.

496
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:04,876
Here you are, daddy.

497
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,326
Where exactly around here
do you two live?

498
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,255
A few miles from town.

499
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,695
Our father was laid off
in the paper mill so...

500
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,301
money is a little tight
right now.

501
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,263
What paper mill?

502
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,274
You really are a good brother
to have brought her here.

503
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:37,374
Well, she's
the only sister I have.

504
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,873
And I wouldn't trade my brother
for all the silver in the world.

505
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,847
Isn't that sweet, honey?

506
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,687
It is absolutely adorable.

507
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,790
I think that face's definitely
going to break some hearts one day.

508
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:55,262
- How old do you think he is?
- My brother is 12 years old...

509
00:48:55,432 --> 00:49:00,199
and I'm very sorry your daughter can't
find boys her own age to play with.

510
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,336
What's your father's name?

511
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,276
Virgil. That's his first name.

512
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:11,208
Yeah, Virgil Pappas.

513
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,846
I don't know anybody
named Pappas.

514
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,216
You know like we said,
we live quite a way from town.

515
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,381
Call the sheriff, Maris.

516
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,250
- There's just something not right here.
- I'll get it, daddy.

517
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,209
OK, look...

518
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,020
here is the truth.

519
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,190
Our mother got arrested...

520
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,886
for armed robbery
five days ago in Arizona.

521
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,089
Our father left
when we were little...

522
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,859
and they were going to put us
in different foster homes.

523
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:04,968
Oh, my!

524
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,229
We've been together
our whole life...

525
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,905
so we just decided to stay
with our cousins up in Vermont.

526
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,972
You better be
telling the truth, son.

527
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,374
You've all just been
so amazingly kind...

528
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,879
I could not lie
if I wanted to.

529
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,051
Once we get to Vermont,
I'll send whatever we owe.

530
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,382
Gratefully.

531
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,558
You are absolutely incredible.

532
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:32,459
I mean, seriously, it was like
watching "Hamlet" or something.

533
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,390
Maybe you should be an actor
when your baseball career is over.

534
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,295
I thought I was supposed
to be a great writer.

535
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,595
Yeah, don't be an actor.

536
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,637
It's a way too skittish life style.

537
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:44,263
So, what can I get you
little chickens this morning?

538
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:48,003
Some silver dollar pancakes
or some piggies in a blanket, I bet?

539
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,505
Two coffees, both black.

540
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,450
So, I watched these people
behind you walk in.

541
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,151
They look like real softies.

542
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,286
I bet we can
catch a ride from them.

543
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,964
<i>Cas was right about</i>
<i>her aunt and uncle being hip.</i>

544
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,431
<i>They seemed to me at least.</i>

545
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,869
Lemonade? It's delicious.

546
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:58,845
<i>I mean, they took us in out of the blue</i>
<i>without making a big deal out of it.</i>

547
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:01,479
<i>I'd say that's pretty hip.</i>

548
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,347
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

549
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,391
Anything we need to go over?

550
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:15,292
I think with children
there need to be some rules.

551
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,421
Like what?

552
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,898
The only one I can think of
is when they should go to bed.

553
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,128
Midnight?

554
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,837
Sounds fair to you guys?

555
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,598
It seems reasonable.

556
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,111
OK, wait, I mean, let's be realistic.
What about the weekends?

557
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:31,603
Right.

558
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:32,839
You know?

559
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:35,773
Two?

560
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,751
Who goes to bed at two?
Come on. Four.

561
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,255
What do you say three?
Everybody OK with that?

562
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,215
Very generous parameters, uncle.

563
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,322
We won't abuse
the privilege, sir.

564
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:50,265
I have a most beautiful room for you.
There's a parachute on the ceiling.

565
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,262
It will be like you're in a palace.

566
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,527
Does it have a single
or a double mattress?

567
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:56,963
- It has a single.
- We'll need a double.

568
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:01,301
With my leg stiffening up sometimes
and the two of us being married and all.

569
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:04,979
You're married?

570
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,312
That must be what kids call
going steady these days.

571
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,578
Oh, no, we're actually married.

572
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:12,410
Yeah, look.

573
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,682
Was it a large wedding?

574
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,087
Well, about 20 or 30 head of...

575
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,689
mostly hogs and some sows.

576
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,791
Oh, and pigs.

577
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,965
Yes, there were several pigs
in attendance as well.

578
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:34,099
Well, I guess we'll get you
a double mattress, then.

579
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:45,846
Well...

580
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,057
Look who's up.

581
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,287
We've recently started
getting up early.

582
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,223
It's a sign of discipline, I think.

583
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,955
You may be right.

584
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,329
Oh, and tell your wife
thanks for the coffee.

585
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,259
It's very good.

586
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,436
- I'll be sure to tell her.
- Oh, and uncle...

587
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:07,307
is it all right if we paint a strike
zone on the side of the building?

588
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:08,609
We'll pay for the paint.

589
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,043
You mean,
like a baseball strike zone?

590
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:16,111
Yes, my husband's going to be
a Major League pitcher.

591
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,615
Well,
I don't see a problem with that.

592
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,995
Terrific!
Well, have a wonderful day.

593
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,425
You, too.

594
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,631
Both of you.

595
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,708
- <i>Don't be nervous.</i>
- <i>This is fun!</i>

596
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:40,533
<i>Okay. Is that all right?</i>

597
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,673
<i>You do wait</i>
<i>to hear if they can handle it.</i>

598
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:44,739
<i>I'm nervous.</i>

599
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,450
<i>Well, no more waiting.</i>
<i>I think I'm ready.</i>

600
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:51,982
OK, the show is
about to start, sir...

601
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,181
and your cooperation
is appreciated.

602
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,721
Please remain in your seat or
I may have to call security.

603
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,091
What are you guys up to, anyways?

604
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,593
A pal direct from Paris...

605
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,460
where she has been showing
for the kings and queens...

606
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,864
and the very special
society's elite people...

607
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,869
and the fashion world,
bright as a new star.

608
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,480
Thank you.

609
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,429
I'm so glad you had this dress on
and not the green shawl.

610
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,327
Remember how the glare
had us hypnotized?

611
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,832
I know, I remember.
I kept staring at it.

612
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,268
The dream's glare...

613
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,912
<i>At first, I couldn't really tell...</i>

614
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,084
<i>but Cassie was starting</i>
<i>to slip away inside herself.</i>

615
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:25,870
Thanks, man.

616
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,341
Come on, Satchmo.

617
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,717
- I can't do that.
- You played like hell the last time.

618
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,118
I thought Armstrong
himself was in the room.

619
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,723
Yeah, I got goosebumps.
Do it again.

620
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:35,916
Come on, give it a try.

621
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:37,650
All right.

622
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,295
Take your time.

623
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:49,430
<i>When I look back,</i>
<i>it feels like my fault.</i>

624
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,838
<i>Not that I could've</i>
<i>figured out why she was sad...</i>

625
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:58,875
<i>but not being able to see just</i>
<i>how incredibly sad she really was.</i>

626
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,118
<i>The problem was...</i>

627
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,983
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what to do about it.</i>

628
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,124
Strike 3!

629
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:16,658
Good job!

630
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,677
<i>It's like she had</i>
<i>this grip on me...</i>

631
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:32,873
<i>but was also pushing away</i>
<i>as hard as she could.</i>

632
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,609
I can't find any frogs.

633
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,683
I told you there weren't
going to be any here.

634
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:50,765
It's funny?

635
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,101
That's funny.

636
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:58,231
Nice to see you got
some sense of humor left.

637
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:02,500
How about a towel?

638
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:04,973
There's a Summer League in Maine...

639
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,106
where all
the Major League's touts go to.

640
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,552
We're heading North
at the end of the week.

641
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,476
If you don't sign in this year...

642
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,684
we'll enrol you in school up there
and get you signed next summer.

643
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,917
Cas, I'll be 13 next summer.

644
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,091
Nobody signs 13-year-old kids.

645
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:26,391
Sometimes your negativity
just absolutely exhausts me.

646
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,898
What if I like it here
and don't want to leave?

647
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:32,235
Going to Maine is the plan.
You want to screw it up?

648
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,065
Go throw yourself a party.

649
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,873
How about the towel?

650
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:52,189
OK, what is the first name
of Ernest Hemingway's wife...

651
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,728
the last one, when he blew
his brains all over the place?

652
00:58:58,668 --> 00:58:59,760
Duke.

653
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,495
Mary.

654
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:03,732
OK.

655
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,935
Who is the right fielder
for the Cleveland Indians 1959?

656
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,573
Sir Douglas big stick
or something.

657
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:15,950
Rocky Colavito.

658
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:20,649
Yes, my lord.

659
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,193
You've almost completely
changed since we got here.

660
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:31,065
I need to know what's going on.

661
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,437
The real question is why you're
putting it in such a negative context.

662
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:40,331
Yes, I am withdrawing somewhat,
but is that a sin?

663
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:43,837
Great.

664
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:48,273
Take a major problem, even though
you won't tell me what it is...

665
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:52,212
and turn it into one
of your brainy discussions.

666
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,121
Oh, is that your opinion?

667
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:59,928
You did finish 7th grade, so I want
to give it the way it deserves.

668
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,192
And you graduated
from Harvard, all right?

669
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,825
OK, cowboy, you want to play?

670
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,372
I'm not exactly sure about
what we're playing here, but...

671
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,140
yeah, let's go.

672
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:15,942
It's all about introspection...

673
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:19,546
a concept you're no doubt incapable
of digesting at this point...

674
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:22,345
in your narrow-minded,
sheltered, pathetic life.

675
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:28,247
Go screw yourself!

676
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:45,565
Ben...

677
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:48,373
What?

678
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,637
You mad at me?

679
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:55,111
Yeah.

680
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,749
And I don't like it.

681
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:03,824
Then, start talking to me
like a real person.

682
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,866
I told you I was flawed
when we met.

683
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:14,864
Cas...

684
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:19,340
Everybody's flawed.
Just in different ways.

685
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,377
I'm so sorry.

686
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,517
It's OK.

687
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,288
Talk to me.

688
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:13,789
Please.

689
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:34,281
Oh, yeah!

690
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,972
Ben, come on.

691
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:07,274
You look good together.

692
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,959
Hey, Cassie, honey.
Won't you come fun?

693
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:21,995
Come here!

694
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:23,797
Come on, Cassie.

695
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,461
Let's show them how to do it.

696
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,496
Come on, shake you tail.

697
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:35,976
Good.

698
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,917
<i>After a while,</i>
<i>Cassie calmed down...</i>

699
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:24,958
<i>and went to sleep.</i>

700
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:29,197
<i>I guess I hoped that</i>
<i>when she woke up...</i>

701
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,890
<i>things would be OK.</i>

702
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,571
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

703
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,240
Time to go, honey.

704
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:30,374
Come on!

705
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,550
<i>So, Cassie became a patient...</i>

706
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:39,354
<i>in a children's psychiatric ward</i>
<i>in Virginia.</i>

707
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:40,953
Ready, front!

708
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:44,828
<i>And I ended up that summer</i>
<i>in a bullshit Military Academy...</i>

709
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:46,366
<i>down in North Carolina.</i>

710
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:50,803
<i>Cassie's aunt and uncle figured</i>
<i>they had to do something with me...</i>

711
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,574
<i>but listening to Louis Armstrong...</i>

712
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,673
<i>and sending a boy</i>
<i>to a Military Academy...</i>

713
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:00,106
<i>doesn't really chime,</i>
<i>when you think about it.</i>

714
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,343
Reynolds, you're messed.
Tuck your shirt in!

715
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,318
Fix your hat!

716
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,688
Don't look at me,
look forward!

717
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,283
Present arms!

718
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,056
<i>The only reason I stuck around...</i>

719
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,661
<i>was to see if Cassie</i>
<i>would get better or not.</i>

720
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,629
<i>But she didn't.</i>

721
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,227
<i>She'd gone over this edge...</i>

722
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,230
<i>and nobody knew</i>
<i>how to get her back.</i>

723
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,431
Maybe she will.

724
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:29,076
<i>Then, the state made it official.</i>

725
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,345
<i>Cassie would be put</i>
<i>in a high-risk observation...</i>

726
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:35,246
<i>ward for a period</i>
<i>no less than 18 months.</i>

727
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,512
<i>18 months.</i>

728
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,954
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

729
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,020
Reynolds,
I told you to grab some polish!

730
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:45,317
Put that book down.

731
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:46,984
I told you!

732
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:54,735
<i>I know what to do</i>
<i>or where to go.</i>

733
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,830
<i>I thought about back home.</i>

734
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:02,101
<i>Maybe my folks had half the police</i>
<i>in Texas looking for me.</i>

735
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,447
<i>But what did it all mean, really?</i>

736
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:12,049
<i>They were living their lives,</i>
<i>and I, trying to figure out my own.</i>

737
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:16,547
<i>The truth is, we never had</i>
<i>much in common, anyway.</i>

738
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:29,761
Hot chocolate?

739
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,029
Hot coffee.

740
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,812
Thanks.

741
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:47,146
You're a good kid.

742
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,957
You should see mine, too.
Both boys.

743
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,355
A little bit older than you,
but not much.

744
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:58,565
Every day I look for even
the slightest sign of humanity in them.

745
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,360
Not a drop.

746
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,438
Where are you headed in Richmond?

747
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,073
Children's psychiatric ward.

748
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,641
I'm going there to get somebody out.

749
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:17,146
Do the people running the hospital
know that you're coming?

750
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:18,785
No.

751
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:24,223
So you are...

752
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:29,155
going to illegally take someone
out of the psychiatric ward?

753
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:30,964
Yes, sir.

754
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:38,097
Who are you bringing out?

755
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:40,599
My wife.

756
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:44,478
Your wife?

757
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,846
Look, son...

758
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:54,889
if you're the one who's staying
in the hospital, it's OK to tell me.

759
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:58,390
No, I'm married...

760
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,988
and I'll go get my wife out
and take her with me.

761
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,474
Any kids?

762
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,847
No, but planning
on having two eventually.

763
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:24,412
I'll make it easy on both of you,
take mine.

764
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,325
- Same ol'.
- Good night.

765
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,808
Hey.

766
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,447
Hey.

767
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,258
Cas...

768
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:49,629
Yeah.

769
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,300
It's time to go.

770
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:01,665
Is that the plan?

771
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,173
Yeah.

772
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,873
That's the plan.

773
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,916
What if I'm really,
really tired?

774
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,425
Let go! Let go! That's it!

775
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,413
You took it for as long
as you could, Cas.

776
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,716
You can't blame yourself for that.

777
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,119
There were good parts to him, too.

778
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:07,028
Cas...

779
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:09,369
Yeah.

780
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,367
Let's go.

781
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,375
Ben, I'm sick.

782
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,381
When you kill two people,
it makes you sick.

783
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:33,094
Look, I'm going to take you
out of here and...

784
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:37,961
worry about everything later. OK?

785
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:43,528
OK.

786
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,844
<i>Before Cas and I started</i>
<i>the rest of our lives together...</i>

787
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,117
<i>there were a couple of things</i>
<i>I needed to do first.</i>

788
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:14,366
<i>Sometimes it's hard knowing if</i>
<i>you should or shouldn't do something.</i>

789
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:22,368
<i>So, you do what</i>
<i>feels right at the time.</i>

790
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,622
My theater!

791
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:11,786
My boat!

792
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,334
My boat...

793
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:44,752
<i>Who knows anything,</i>
<i>when it comes down to it?</i>

794
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:46,381
<i>I don't.</i>

795
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:50,449
<i>I pretend I do sometimes,</i>
<i>but I don't.</i>

796
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:57,893
<i>But I do know this.</i>

797
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:01,267
<i>When your life becomes</i>
<i>what you dreamed it would be...</i>

798
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:03,264
<i>it's amazing.</i>

799
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:09,766
<i>I think that walk sealed</i>
<i>D.Q.'s fate here in game five.</i>

800
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,517
<i>I didn't break Nuxhall's record</i>
<i>of playing at 15...</i>

801
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:26,322
<i>but I did become the youngest guy</i>
<i>that ever pitched in a World Series.</i>

802
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,656
<i>Benjamin Reynolds.</i>

803
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,660
<i>But nothing I did on the field...</i>

804
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,639
<i>compared to what Cassie</i>
<i>and I accomplished together.</i>

805
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:46,708
<i>It's kind of a miracle really...</i>

806
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:50,078
<i>having the chance to give</i>
<i>what you never got.</i>

807
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,580
<i>Cas took a job editing</i>
<i>children's books...</i>

808
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,426
<i>and I pitched until my arm</i>
<i>couldn't take it any more.</i>

809
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:00,795
<i>And, like she planned...</i>

810
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:02,855
<i>I became a writer.</i>

811
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:09,665
<i>A lot of what Cassie said</i>
<i>turned out to be true.</i>

812
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,531
<i>Most people do need a plan.</i>

813
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:18,476
<i>Life is crazy enough without one.</i>

814
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:28,617
<i>But the hardest part of life...</i>

815
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,115
<i>is losing someone you love.</i>

816
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,824
<i>At first, you almost wish</i>
<i>you never knew them...</i>

817
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,156
<i>so you stop hurting so much.</i>

818
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,868
<i>Feels like it's going to kill you.</i>

819
01:20:57,752 --> 01:20:59,913
<i>What you end up missing the most...</i>

820
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:02,579
<i>is the sweet burden</i>
<i>of being needed.</i>

821
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,593
<i>It gives your life a purpose.</i>

822
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:06,952
<i>It really does.</i>

823
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,061
<i>And it makes you feel great.</i>

824
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:14,927
<i>That's something else</i>
<i>Cassie told me.</i>

825
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,104
<i>It is all a part of the plan.</i>
