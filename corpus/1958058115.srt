We've developed our own 
technique for getting into 
character.

182
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,533
It sort of goes one step
beyond "The Method".

very fun, as well.

184
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,809
Let me clarify one thing, 
alright? I'm not advocating 
impersonal,

185
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,678
non-emotional, 
one-night-stand sex.

186
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,816
No. Sex is meaningful.
And an expression of feeling

187
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:09,917
towards the other person.

188
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,853
It just doesn't have to be the 
one and only person.

189

thing as the one and only.

that's how God made us.

193
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,198
Now, I understand the importance
of commitment, obviously, once

194
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:29,436

that time, I intend to follow

No. Not if it's offensive.

218
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,004
Yeah, but people think 
offensive thoughts 
and no amount of

219

ever gonna stop that.

It's just that I've decided
that being truthful is very 
important

243
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,143
More important, in fact,
than being polite.

been practicing

Well, I believed it.

Otherwise, I wouldn't have 
traveled 400 miles to be here.

up to your expectations.

already exceeded them.

Uh, no one told me 
how handsome you were.

344

Of course. Why not?

369

asked my opinion about

anything before.

Jack, you're my star.
Come on.

happened today at lunch.

And if, for any reason, you 
don't
 like her, she is off the show.

375
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:42,762
Well, as a matter of fact,
she is kinda uptight and touchy.

Well, that settles it, then.
She's gone.

she's gonna be a big star.

in that scene, she even made 
you look good.

Come on, lighten up.

394

Seriously, though, I did, 
uh, warn her about you.

395
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,651
That you've screwed every 
leading lady you've ever had.

396

Which, of course,
shocked me.

397
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,490
Well, thanks again, Troy.
Thanks. What else did you say?

398
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,593
Oh, just that if she needed 
any help rehearsing her scenes

399
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,296
that I would be happy 
to go over them with her.

I really appreciated that.

I sure have.

I think she was pretty cute.

I spent some time with her, 
alright?

416
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,436
And, believe me, 
she's definitely not for you.

417

Oh, yeah, why? Because she 
shot you down? No, no, no, no, 
no.

418
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,507
No. Because she's in a

men.

about love and you know.

could get him to like me.

I probably could, but, uh,

isn't that a little

No way.

Alright. Um, as you can tell, 
I'm a very serious person.

I do so for a reason.

I don't like to waste 
my time on frivolous affairs

1015

someone usually gets hurt.

to hurt him and I expect

I'm looking for someone

 my whole life with.

kind of a guy but --

become too serious about life.

I should do something that

1032
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:37,168

purely sexual relationship.

uh, have sex?

Badass crew guy.

2008
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:36,171
James Zucal.

2009
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:39,808
This is Joe. Joe did 
all of the set decorating.

2010
01:29:39,842 --> 01:29:41,376
-Thank you.
-Production Designer.

2011
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,678
Production Designer.

2012
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,346
-This is our Gaffer.
-Hi.

2013
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:45,514
-Isn't that right?
-I Gaff.

2014
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:46,915
-His name's Stanley.
-What's up?

2015
01:29:46,982 --> 01:29:48,817
-Jeremy's right here.
-Hello.

2016
01:29:48,851 --> 01:29:50,819
-Production Intern, is that it?
-Yep. Just about.

2017
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:52,320
This is my main man, Don.

2018
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:55,157
-Camera Operator.
-I'm not that cool of a guy.

2019
01:29:55,157 --> 01:29:57,893
(LAUGHS) Aw, 
and here's Jason.

2020
01:29:57,993 --> 01:30:00,863
-Oh, yeah.
-Jason would be the Key Grip?

2021
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:03,031
-That's right.
-Now that's an important title.

2022
01:30:03,065 --> 01:30:04,332
-Oh, yeah.
-What do you do, Jason?

2023
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:06,669
-As little as possible.
-Absolutely. It shows.

2024
01:30:06,702 --> 01:30:08,203
He's union.

2025
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:10,906
My main man, PA. 
Usually a camera man

2026
01:30:10,939 --> 01:30:13,576
but it's such a low budget he 
agreed to come on and help us.

2027
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:15,010
-Is that a guy, or what?
-Just once. Just once.

2028
01:30:15,377 --> 01:30:18,213
Shonda. Shonda's a 
young stand-in, right here.

2029
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,782
What happened to 
your trousers?

2030
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:21,416
Oh, there's noodles all over.

2031
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,118
I gotta introduce you to
someone really special.

2032
01:30:23,185 --> 01:30:26,354
This is Kelsey.
Kelsey, say "Hello".

2033
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:28,957
-Hi.
-Isn't she a doll?

2034
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,726
God, I love this girl.

2035
01:30:30,726 --> 01:30:32,728
-We got Matt over here.
-(BURPS)

2036
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,697
That was charming.

2037
01:30:34,697 --> 01:30:36,899
Like I told you, 
it's not always glamorous,

2038
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:37,766
what we do.

2039
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,202
Raymond works in Set 
Decoration, is that right?

2040
01:30:40,202 --> 01:30:41,203
That's right, Ed.

2041
01:30:41,236 --> 01:30:43,138
Uh, so I guess that 
pretty much does it.

2042
01:30:43,205 --> 01:30:46,542
Everybody's, uh, 
here and accounted for.

2043
01:30:46,575 --> 01:30:49,478
But there's one 
more person, actually.

2044
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:51,547
Give me that camera.

2045
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:56,585
-Aww.
-This... this is the main man,

2046
01:30:56,585 --> 01:30:58,587
-right here. 
-Yay!

2047
01:30:59,054 --> 01:31:00,923
-Woo!
-Sandy Tung.

2048
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:02,057
The Director.

2049
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:03,826
Let me make sure 
we got him in focus.

2050
01:31:03,892 --> 01:31:05,894
Sandy!
