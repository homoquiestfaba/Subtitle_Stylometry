00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:30,503
<i>No
No</i>

00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:39,845
<i>No
No</i>

3
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,012
<i>No</i>

4
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:48,526
<i>No, she don't mess around
No, she don't mess around</i>

5
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,164
100% blue agave.

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,757
Taste it.

7
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,427
Look, Mike, I like you.

8
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,901
But no one's looking for
another brand of tequila.

9
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,335
They've got the three...
What is it?

10
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,372
The Cuervo, the other one,
and the third one.

11
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,076
And they don't
need more tequila.

12
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,506
If I can't sell it,
it's not gonna sell.

13
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,074
People want the new-new.

14
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,612
-The "new-new"?
-The "new-new."

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,908
They want that new-new.

16
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,006
No!

17
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,576
What if I could sell this
tequila to a customer?

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,813
-Would I have your order then?
-Yeah, sure.

19
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,651
And I'm just gonna pick
a customer at random.

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,981
Excuse me, sir.

21
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,217
Do you enjoy the
taste of tequila?

22
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,288
Why, yes, I do.

23
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,662
But I only drink my particular brand,
and you will not convince me otherwise.

24
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,799
-It's a perfect candidate.
-Because it's your brother!

25
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,162
I know that's your brother.

26
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,632
He dated my niece.

27
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,796
Look, mate, I don't
know your niece.

28
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,804
-Okay.
-But if I did...

29
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,774
I'd say she was a little clingy, and
she'd freak a lot of people out.

30
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,709
<i>We play Wards With Friends
together, right?</i>

31
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,873
-Dave, right?
-Name's Rick. Just got in from Melbourne.

32
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,040
His name's Rick.

33
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,413
I know he's your brother.

34
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,951
Look, look, look. You guys
are funny, you're weird.

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,454
We do this every couple weeks...

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,120
All right, I'll take 10 cases.

37
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,182
-Fuck, yes!
-Yes!

38
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,317
Yes! I knew it!

39
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,551
We sold your ass, Randy!

40
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,722
I don't know if
that's what happened.

41
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,094
-It was the hat, right?
-Was it the hat?

42
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,188
I just found this over there.

43
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,267
<i>Do something crazy</i>

44
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,499
<i>Live like it's Mardi Gras</i>

45
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,272
<i>And go jump
Make the party start</i>

46
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,245
<i>Don't need no R&R</i>

47
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,145
<i>To regular life, I say au revoir</i>

48
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,582
<i>Yay! Living life
in the fast lane</i>

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,176
<i>Now your pain only be champagne</i>

50
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,813
<i>So please comejoin me
One thing, good vibes only</i>

51
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,852
<i>Start the keg
{mine fill my cup</i>

52
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,328
<i>Got fireworks, got booze
Let's blow some shit up</i>

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,861
<i>Tonight I'm going stupid</i>

54
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,593
<i>Doing things I've never done</i>

55
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,298
<i>We all got one thing in common</i>

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,203
<i>We just wanna have fun</i>

00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,504

00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,274
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

61
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,211
<i>Do something crazy</i>

62
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,215

63
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,284

<i>Do something wild</i>

67
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,859
<i>Rolling with the homies</i>

00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,995
<i>Chicks by my side</i>

<i>Live for the moment</i>

70
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,071
<i>All of the time</i>

71
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,075
<i>Turn up the music</i>

72
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,873
<i>Only good vibes</i>

73
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,837
Sorry to throw
the accent at you, bro.

74
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,405
No, dude. I loved it,
and it kept me in the now.

75
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,514
Do you realize that that sale puts
us at number three in the office?

76
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,177
The Stangle bros are killing it
right now!

77
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,482
It's not an actual hat.
They just call it a jimmy hat.

78
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,818
If you wear two, they break.

79
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,086
-It's an urban legend...
-No, it's not.

80
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,219
Mom, Dad?

81
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,225
Jeanie. Eric.

82
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,231
Don't freak out.
I don't want you to freak out.

83
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,460
Just come on in.

84
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,602
Why don't we all
just sit down?

85
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,661
We gotta talk to you.

86
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,139
We wanna discuss
Jeanie and Eric's wedding.

87
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,501
-Sweet.
-Okay.

88
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,111
Are you guys thinking DJ or band?
First thought, band, right?

89
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,838
No. People want to
hear the real songs.

90
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,279
You don't want to hear a guy
singing Beyoncé.

91
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,680
You just want to hear Beyoncé.

92
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,015
Yeah, but we want
to talk about...

93
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,886
is you two.

94
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,758
Now, over the years...

95
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,961
a theme has emerged
at our family gatherings.

96
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,495
Everyone's having a good time...

97
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,993
-That's right.
-Things are going smoothly.

98
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,193
Party time.

99
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,328
And then you two show up...

100
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,393
stag...

101
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,728
and you hit on girls...

102
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,031
you act like idiots...

103
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,766
and you ruin it.

104
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,932
Ruin it.

105
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,340
What? We are not party ruiners!

106
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,841
We're party creators!

107
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,946
And besides, when have we ever
ruined a family event?

108
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,612
We thought you might say that.

109
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,845
Yep, here we go.
And we just stream it.

110
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,910
Apple TV.

111
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,012
We just need your password.

112
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,656
-Bryan's baby dick 69.
-Yeah.

113
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,292
Bryan's baby dick 69.

114
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,219
What the fuck, guys? Really?

115
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,419
-Got it. Yep.
-Is that it?

116
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,486
Good.

117
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,067
<i>Happy Fourth of July!</i>

118
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,492
<i>Shit!</i>

119
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,975
It was fun up to that point.

120
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,010
<i>God damn it! My trailer!</i>

121
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,253
Shit.

122
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,525
Actually, this is what
we're trying to avoid.

123
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,025
<i>-The both of you are fucking idiots.
-Fucking losers!</i>

124
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,203
<i>Grandpa, wake up! Take his tie.</i>

125
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,475
Are you saying we had something
to do with Grandfather's death?

126
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,610
He died five years after that!

127
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,685
That is a lot of guilt
to put us. Shame on you.

128
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,221
Plus, this video only shows
the screw-ups.

129
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,652
Where's the epic tracking
shots of smiling faces?

130
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,953
And everybody looking at us,
just going...

131
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,154
"God, I love Mike and Dave.

132
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,424
"They made this whole
party worth it."

133
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,168
When are the two of you
going to grow up?

134
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,496
This shtick was
cute for a while...

135
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,071
but it's gotten stale.

136
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,139
Mom, come on, what are you...

137
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,504
You're talking about us like we're
a couple of losers or something.

138
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,739
What we don't want you to do is go
chasing girls and get out of control.

139
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,211
You understand?

140
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,646
Wait, we can still
talk to girls, right?

141
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,251
You can each talk to one girl.

142
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,716
The girls that you
bring to the wedding.

143
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,411
What do you mean?

144
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,389
I want you to bring a date.

145
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,423
That's two dates.

146
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,062
You want us to bring
dates to a wedding?

147
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,119
Excuse me?

148
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,323
Are you allowed to do that?

149
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,727
Nice, respectable, smart girls!

150
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,159
Keep you in line.

151
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,529
-What the fuck?
-What?

152
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,034
-Are you insane?
-You're kidding.

153
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,433
You are not screwing up this
wedding. Do you hear me?

154
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,337
Mom, do you hear this river of horse
shit coming out of Dad's mouth?

155
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,536
We don't want you showing up
stag and riling each other up!

156
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,113
-We don't rile each other up!
-We never get riled up!

157
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,409
-I don't get riled!
-He doesn't and I don't, either!

158
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,276
Look at you right now!
You're riled!

159
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,581
-Take your head out of your ass, Dad!
-You sound insane right now.

160
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,247
Everybody stop yelling! Okay?

161
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,620
You guys bringing wedding dates
was my idea.

162
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,754
Look, I love the shit
out of you guys.

163
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,931
But everyone is already stressed
out about this wedding...

164
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,964
and I just need you to be cool.

165
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:07,860
Of course, Jeanie!

166
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,368
Please?

167
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,564
For me?

168
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,141
I promise. We would never do
anything to mess up your wedding.

169
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,972
Jeanie, we love you.

170
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,809
We want this to be
the best day of your life.

171
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,870
Yeah.

172
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,041
You, too, Eric.

173
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,311
Thank you.

174
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,607
Mostly you, though, Jeanie.

175
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,722
If you want us to bring dates,
we're bringing dates.

176
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,847
All right, it's settled then.

177
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,690
Wedding dates!

178
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,585
Dave, buddy, let me talk to you
for a second, okay? Listen.

179
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,822
I'm sorry to lump
you in with Mike...

180
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,659
but if I only told your older
brother to bring a date...

181
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,426
he'd get all weird about it.

182
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,728
I just feel like he's
holding you back.

183
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,428
Dad, I don't mind
being lumped in with Mike.

184
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,004
Do you remember
the fifth grade bake sale...

185
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,197
when Mom made those cupcakes...

186
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,636
and I called them moist?

187
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,108
Everyone called me Moist...

188
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,178
till Mike took a cupcake...

189
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,976
and shoved it in
Tom Ginty's face.

190
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,450
He said, "Now you're
moist, Moist."

191
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,682
That's the kind of guy Mike is.

192
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,482
So, think on that...

193
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,621
Dad.

194
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,023
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to end
that on such a weird note, Dad.

195
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,191
-I love you. And thanks.
-Good. I don't want you to be mad.

196
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,427
I'm not even mad.
I'm not even upset.

197
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,526
We're gonna find some dates.

198
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,230
I gotta say, some nights,
lam not looking my best.

199
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,442
But tonight is not
one of those nights!

200
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,838
-Do you like my hair?
-Yeah, girl.

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,502
-You look good.
-No.

202
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,840
We're gonna make a
lot of tips tonight.

203
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,014
Good. We need it.
We don't have any money.

204
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,977
You got money for
this ride, don't you?

205
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,817
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

206
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,877
'Cause you have money?

207
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:31,978
I thought you had money.

208
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,045
I don't have any money.

209
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,113
You know I don't have money.

210
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,717
Yeah, y'all are whispering like
people that don't got money.

211
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,328
Check it out. I'mma
pay you right now.

212
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,161
Boop. I Apple Paid.

213
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,357
I don't even have Apple Pay.

214
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,395
Yo, Siri, pay this man.

215
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,690
He's already paid.

216
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:45,758
God damn it!

217
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,237
I'm not gonna take shit from
you, because this my cab.

218
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,839
You shouldn't take shit from us.

219
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,137
-You should kick us out!
-You should kick us out of this cab.

220
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,304
You know what? I'm gonna kick
you the fuck out of this cab.

221
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,609
Yeah, just go three more
blocks up on the right...

222
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,705
and then kick us out!

223
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,846
Here we are!

224
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,208
Get out of my cab.

225
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,683
Thank you. You're a
really good person.

226
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:04,878
Okay, God bless you.

227
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,524
I'm just gonna start
driving for Uber. Fuck it.

228
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,981
I got a good idea.

229
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,821
Let's pop off, get a couple
of drinks before work.

230
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,054
Just a few, because I don't
want to get hammered.

231
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,721
Yeah, of course not.
Just a light buzz.

232
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,704
Hey, hey, he?!

233
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,398
Welcome to Sake Bombers...

234
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,771
where your first
Sake Bomb is on us!

235
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,844
-Kaboom!
-You're drunk, Alice.

236
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,706
You're doing that thing
where you're whispering,

237
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,908
but you're really yelling.

238
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,379
Because I'm upset with you.

239
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,574
What the hell?

240
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,014
I don't understand
why you just started

241
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,076
yelling at me for no reason.

242
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,645
What the hell is going on here?

243
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,950
Your little buddy is shit-faced.

244
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,387
Straight up.

245
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,892
Her fiancé just left
her at the altar.

246
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,185
She's been going
through a hard time.

247
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,357
-Are you guys talking about me?
-No, baby girl.

248
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,900
You know how many times
I have come in here...

249
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:54,004
and she is drunk off her fucking
ass, dancing on the tables?

250
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,300
Only when Rihanna comes on,
because it's my jam.

251
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,204
I am a strong independent woman.

252
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,038
And I will get on a table
and shake my shit to RiRi.

253
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,204
Because it's my right.
America!

254
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,272
Feminism!

255
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,884
You just push your tits up
and say feminism?

256
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,417
Yeah. Read a Twitter.

257
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,686
#2016. Women can do shit now.

258
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,746
<i>(Oil/L Y GIRL IN
THE WORLD PLAYING}</i>

259
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,926
Don't do that!

260
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,585
Who put her jam on?

261
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,921
Queen RiRi, forever!

262
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,998
I'm really sorry
that I got us fired.

263
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,462
I'm just sort of surprised
it didn't happen sooner...

264
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,070
-but I'm still really sorry.
-Hey!

265
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,473
Alice, you do not apologize
right now, okay?

266
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,667
You didn't do one thing wrong.

267
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,138
-Okay.
-People need to get in line with you.

268
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,337
Right. You're right.

269
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,243
Alice, why are you watching
your wedding video?

270
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,474
AndA/ice...

271
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,913
<i>do you take Luke?</i>

272
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,008
<i>I do.</i>

273
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,075
Because it's therapeutic.

274
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,950
The more I watch it,
the less I feel.

275
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,147
<i>And do you,
Luke, take Alice?</i>

276
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,346
<i>Ida...</i>

277
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,781
<i>not.</i>

278
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,523
<i>Man. Fuck you, Luke.</i>

279
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,326
Fuck that guy.

280
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,827
Fuck him right in his dick.

281
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,023
No!

282
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,966
Because now I'm picturing his dick
getting fucked by another dick.

283
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,538
And it makes me
want to protect it.

284
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,343
My God, girl! Damn!

285
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,172
You're better than this.
Come on!

286
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,813
We're T and A!

287
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,472
Where's the Alice who made
vodka pot brownies with me...

288
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,015
for the junior
high science fair?

289
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,652
Or gave us water balloon tits

290
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,312
and we won that wet T-shirt
contest in Mexico?

291
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,615
Yeah, they were so nice.

292
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,452
I know, dude. We need that shit.

293
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,284
I'm tired of living like this.

294
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,853
We need an adventure.

295
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,365
We've got a great little package
we're selling here, man.

296
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,799
A week in a tropical paradise...

297
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,905
with two fun-loving,
yet surprisingly well-read bros?

298
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,029
Yeah.

299
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,871
I read most of the Goosebumps
series, and so did you.

300
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:39,932
Yeah.

301
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,000
Where do I sign up?

302
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,273
Dude, focus.

303
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,075
-Okay.
-This is for Jeanie.

304
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,748
So to find the perfect fun,
but nice girls...

305
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,840
we're gonna have to
meet a lot of them.

306
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,275
The Internet!

307
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,509
That's a good idea.

308
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,222
Match.com, Tinder...

309
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,948
Grindr, OkCupid.

310
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,014
Craigslist!

311
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,251
Craigslist?

312
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,420
Craigslist, you think, that's
where you go to meet nice girls?

313
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,689
Dave?

314
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,525
We met this couch on Craigslist.

315
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,629
And you wuv this
couch, don't you?

316
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,830
I do love that couch.

317
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,264
I'm gonna unlock
the swag on this bitch.

318
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,597
All right.

319
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,304
Here you go. Just take a little
sip. Take a little nip-a-roo.

320
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,771
Boom!

321
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,980
Do you think anyone's even
really gonna see this?

322
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,041
God, I hope so.

323
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,513
Like max, what do you think?

324
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,350
We're gonna get, like, five or
six dates out of this, or what?

325
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,116
I'd be happy with that.

326
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,155
Hey.

327
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,667
Did you see this thing that
Shelly's sending around the office?

328
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,961
It's a free trip to Hawaii!

329
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,696
Look what someone
posted to my Facebook.

330
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,071
<i>-I gotta tweet this out.
-Those guys are cute.</i>

331
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,265
<i>Ala-hat!</i>

332
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,705
<i>ALL". I got the
one on the right.</i>

333
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,470
I like the one on the right.

334
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,635
I got the one on the right.

335
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,943
I like the one on the right.

336
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,072
We gotta send this to everyone.

337
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,174
<i>Let's all apply!</i>

338
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,275
<i>WOMAN Z". I want
to go to Hawaii.</i>

339
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,375
<i>{just emailed them.</i>

340
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,648
<i>Let's just meet them,
give 'em a chance.</i>

341
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,815
So, you guys want
to go to a wedding?

342
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,482
What are your names?

343
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,151
Do you guys have names?

344
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,665
Basically we were looking
through Craigslist for work.

345
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,494
You're both...

346
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,558
Prostitutes.

347
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,361
Whatever. Take us to Hawaii!

348
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,427
Hawaii!

349
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,872
We can't take you.

350
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:20,933
No way.

351
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,276
Did you guys say something about an
all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii?

352
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,640
It's just for girls.

353
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,779
That's not a deal breaker.

354
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,110
Hi, my name is Lauralie...

355
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,582
and I'm kind of new to this.

356
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,643
Yeah.

357
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,847
You're new to...

358
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,623
Online dating. Yeah.

359
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,157
I'm not really looking for a
heteronormative relationship.

360
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,853
-You look like a Nike swoosh.
-Goddamn right, I do.

361
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,019
I work at a dog shelter.

362
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,663
Our sister loves dogs.

363
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,993
I wanna make sure
they get really good homes.

364
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,056
What's a good home?

365
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,863
The white homes.

366
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,971
-The what homes?
-The white homes.

367
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,333
Like white people.

368
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,333
Check, please.

369
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,703
This isn't lipstick. This
is a tattoo, you dumb fuck.

370
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,547
Who are you laughing at? Who?

371
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,978
All right, look,
here's the deal.

372
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,481
I went through a divorce, like,
three weeks ago. I need a vacation.

373
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,154
No.

374
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,213
Okay, you guys sure
you don't want to fuck?

375
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,314
-What?
-Nothing.

376
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,482
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

377
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,858
Sounded like you said,
"Do you wanna fuck?"

378
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:12,918
Do you wanna fuck?

379
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,087
-What?
-What?

380
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,461
-What?
-You guys...

381
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,725
-Do you want me to fuck you?
-No.

382
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,368
-No.
-I didn't say it, but...

383
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,596
-I'll suck your dick right now. What?
-What?

384
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,200
Welcome back.

385
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,540
I'm here with Mike
and Dave Stangle...

386
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,376
who posted an ad
on Craigslist...

387
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,279
looking for dates
for their sister's wedding...

388
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,577
<i>in Oahu, Hawaii.</i>

389
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,846
<i>Well, the ad went viral.</i>

390
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,589
<i>It racked up over
6,000 responses...</i>

391
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,988
<i>from women who
actually wanted to go.</i>

392
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,050
<i>Yeah, well, who's counting?</i>

393
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,662
<i>You know, I guess we all are.</i>

394
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,921
<i>Is this my close-up?</i>

395
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,589
<i>You guys, come on. Craigslist?</i>

396
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,167
<i>Honestly, this is about
finding nice girls...</i>

397
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,668
<i>to go with us to Hawaii
for our sister's wedding.</i>

398
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,999
<i>And {just want to reiterate...</i>

399
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,641
<i>we 're footing the bill for this
because we 're gentlemen.</i>

400
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,933
Free trip to Hawaii?

401
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,601
I'm awake!

402
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,941
<i>-Come on. Craigslist.
-What's up?</i>

403
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,513
<i>That's where you go
to buy old patio furniture.</i>

404
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,910
<i>You know what else you can find
on Craigslist?</i>

405
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,882
<i>Love...</i>

406
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,214
<i>That's right. I said it.</i>

407
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,050
-Love.
-That one seems sweet.

408
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,350
He has a kind soul.

409
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,516
Yeah, and he's also super hot.

410
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,228
Yeah, he's hot as fucking balls.

411
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,799
<i>But just to repeat,
we're looking for nice girls.</i>

412
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:27,233
<i>Like, girls that our mom
and our sister would like.</i>

413
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,738
Okay, look, dude,
we are going to Hawaii.

414
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,340
Let's go on vacation.

415
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,406
But it's not a vacation.
It's a wedding.

416
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,976
Do you really think a wedding's
the best place for me?

417
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,413
Since the last wedding I went to
was mine...

418
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,074
and it didn't turn
out very well.

419
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,142
I hear you, but look...

420
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,821
this shit is why this shit
is perfect, okay?

421
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,151
Because ever since Luke left,
you haven't been the same.

422
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,893
You need to get over that
, once and for all.

423
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,154
And this our shot, man.

424
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,431
That dude,
he's gonna get your groove back.

425
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,657
This right here is an
opportunity of a lifetime...

426
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,996
and you know we are
entrepreneurs.

427
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,160
You know what?

428
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,568
Let's make these guys
take us to Hawaii!

429
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,402
You're right! Let's do it!

430
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,565
Let's just do it!

431
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,667
-Yes, bitch.
-Let's fucking do it!

432
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,975
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

433
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,036
We gonna go to Hawaii!

434
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,249
We gonna go to Hawaii!

435
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,280
-Hold up!
-What?

436
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,954
Those boys said they wanted nice
girls. We don't look like nice girls.

437
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,859
Yeah, I guess
I haven't showered in a while.

438
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,993
Fine, well,
you know what we're gonna do?

439
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,960
We're gonna look
respectable as fuck.

440
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,462
Like nice girls.

441
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,066
Dude, it's like that Jesus rag!

442
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,701
It's part of me.

443
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,480
Tatiana, your underwear
needs more underwears.

444
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,320
This dress is my bitch!

445
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,980
Dude, we have met
37 insane women.

446
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,523
We can't bring any
of these girls.

447
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,720
Maybe Dad'll just forget about
his ultimatum.

448
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,832
Why would Dad forget about
an old tomato?

449
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,027
No, his ultimatum.

450
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,362
-Old tom...
-Ultimatum.

451
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,560
Are you saying "old tomato"?

452
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,466
Ultima-tomb. Like a
tomb or a crypt.

453
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,564
Ultimatum.

454
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,940
Well, we gotta figure something out,
because the wedding's coming up quick.

455
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,580
Why is everything a competition
with you?

456
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,088
And I said that first,
so actually, lwon that.

457
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,090
So what time
are we meeting them?

458
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,027
Technically, no time.

459
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,559
Yeah, because I was thinking
about emailing them...

460
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,328
but then I was thinking...

461
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,371
what kind of floozy-ass bimbo
would respond to that ad?

462
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,864
Us.

463
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,511
Yeah, but we're not like those
idiots. You know what I'm saying?

464
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,477
Because they're all like,
"Pick me, pick me!"

465
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,772
it's like the guys
interviewing the girls.

466
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,442
Like, it immediately would put
us in an inferior position.

467
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,610
We're gonna flip the script
and Bachelarette that shit.

468
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,050
-Those guys would be lucky to have us.
-Right.

469
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,284
-We just gotta make them think so.
-Okay, right.

470
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,555
But, you know,
I'm really not good at lying...

471
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,995
because I always try to start
small and then it gets crazy...

472
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,761
and I make-up stuff
that couldn't possibly be true.

473
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,696
Baby, you can do this.
Let's practice, okay?

474
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,760
Okay.

475
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:15,897
-What do you like to do?
-Drink.

476
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,202
Just sweet teas.

477
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,444
Sweet teas and
biscuits on blimps.

478
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,738
All right, straight up,
you don't have to do an accent.

479
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,936
I was doing an accent?

480
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,173
And definitely don't
bring up blimps.

481
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,745
Shit! They're leaving.

482
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,212
If it was a
competition, I won it.

483
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,545
All right, don't worry.

484
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,710
It's all part of the plan.

485
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:32,981
-Is it?
-Yeah.

486
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,625
What does that mean? What plan? I
don't know this part of the plan...

487
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,217
Fuck!

488
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,929
Tatiana!

489
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:42,988
Holy shit.

490
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,223
Babe. Are you okay?

491
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,299
I'm okay. Yell, "She
can't breathe!"

492
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,562
She can't breathe!

493
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,137
She can't breathe!
Somebody help her!

494
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,195
Somebody give her CPR!

495
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,998
-She can't breathe!
-I know CPR!

496
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,609
-Great!
-I was a volunteer EMT!

497
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,140
Hey, don't worry.
My brother's got this, okay?

498
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,870
I took a class. I
know what I'm doing.

499
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137
-She has a weak heart!
-Ma'am?

500
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,575
-Ma'am?
-She has a weak heart.

501
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,877
I'm an EMT.
I'm like a doctor, basically.

502
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,781
I'm here to save your
fucking life, okay?

503
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,184
-She's my only friend!
-That's her only friend, Mike!

504
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,550
We got a pulse! Okay.

505
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,854
Don't let her die!

506
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,656
Don't you fucking
let her die, Mike!

507
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,854
Just shut the fuck up, Dave!
You, too, shut up!

508
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,757
Both of you, shut up! Okay?

509
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:16,855
I'm gonna save her life!

510
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,959
Plug the nose.

511
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,244
Are you okay?

512
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,107
I am now.

513
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,472
-I saved her life!
-She's okay!

514
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,118
-She's okay?
-I saved her life!

515
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,843
Thank you! Thank you!

516
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,354
-You're under arrest.
-She hit my car!

517
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,786
No, you guys,
I'm totally fine, really.

518
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,985
It happens all the time.

519
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,560
That was a vicious hit. We
should take you to the hospital.

520
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,560
It's crazy. It's almost
like I owe you my life.

521
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,296
-Almost.
-Yeah. Technically, yeah.

522
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,526
-Let me help you with that ice.
-I do.

523
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:53,759
No.

524
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,532
Seems like it's going
pretty well with your guy.

525
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,402
Dude, I'm fucking crushing it!
So hard!

526
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,873
Check this out.

527
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,975
The kids in my class
are gonna love this story.

528
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,739
I'm a school teacher.

529
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,982
You're a school teacher?

530
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,883
Oop. I think they spelt
"frittata" wrong on the menu.

531
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,751
I always notice words
and spelling...

532
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,585
because I'm a teacher...

533
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,588
and that's what I do.

534
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,224
That's...

535
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,887
So, Alice, what do you do?

536
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,859
Manage a hedge fund.

537
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,327
You manage a hedge fund?

538
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,595
I don't even know
what a hedge fund is.

539
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,262
So there's a regular fund,
and then there's a hedge fund.

540
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,500
And our fund...

541
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,402
We hedge it.

542
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,901
We hedge it hard.

543
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,373
I get in, in the morning,
and I'm like...

544
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,348
"How's the hedging coming? You
been hedging? You hedged much?"

545
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,815
And it's like, too big to fail.

546
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,954
Corporate greed, bailouts.

547
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,217
In a New York minute,
everything can change.

548
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,393
On the floor of the
NASDAQ and the U.N.

549
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,756
And then, Fannie Mae.

550
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,763
Bernie Mac and D.L. Hughley...

551
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,094
-Alice, you want some water?
-Yeah.

552
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,165
-That's so smart.
-That is.

553
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,200
"But what I do have...

554
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,468
"is a particular set of skills.

555
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,100
"Skills I have acquired
over a very long career.

556
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,243
"Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you."

557
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,107
Click. That's it.

558
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,476
That was amazing.

559
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,984
It was like Dave was
not even here...

560
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,052
and I was just standing in a bar
with Liam Neeson.

561
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,655
Like, "Hello, Liam
Neeson's over here."

562
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,323
You're a professional comedian
or something?

563
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,291
What? No.
I sell liquor with my brother.

564
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,451
Yeah.

565
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,425
-I do like to draw.
-Yeah?

566
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,066
Yeah, I have drawings here
I could show you.

567
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:31,993
Shit, not that. Sorry.

568
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,296
Here. So, they're
like The Avengers...

569
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,166
but they're different
types of alcohol.

570
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,499
So, you have Tequila, and then
he's got his pet worm right there.

571
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,573
And his name is Lil' Mez.

572
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,345
Because he'II "Mez" you up.

573
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,209
The next one right
there, that's Gin.

574
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,443
When he flips his cap off,
dawg, he's just like...

575
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,453
"Yo, I'll pop you off.
Guaranteed. One knock."

576
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,812
Done.

577
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,422
Next, Whiskey.

578
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,546
Likes to make moonshine

579
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,284
and kill bad guys.

580
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,325
Dude, this is
objectively amazing.

581
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,521
Thanks.

582
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,961
What's the hardest thing
about being a teacher?

583
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,622
I don't know.

584
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,906
The hardest thing
about being a teacher...

585
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,065
is teaching cursive.

586
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,637
That's awesome.

587
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,539
-What about you?
-Yeah?

588
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,475
-Are you seeing anyone?
-No.

589
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,978
My ex is gone. Long gone.

590
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,038
What do you mean?

591
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,049
He died. Of cancer.

592
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,342
My God.

593
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,509
And AIDS.

594
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:25,977
He died twice?

595
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,655
And then he died
in a plane crash, so...

596
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,125
That's a lot to take in.

597
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,229
I know!

598
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:34,787
Thank you.

599
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,455
Thank you, brotha.

600
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,798
Dude.

601
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,734
We should take these girls
to the wedding. Right?

602
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,635
Mine's a sexy school teacher...

603
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,140
and yours... hedges funds.

604
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,676
-Just keep doing sexy eyes.
-Okay.

605
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,245
Keep doing sexy eyes.

606
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,310
I like Alice.

607
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,849
And she's smart, she's funny,
she's weird.

608
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,019
We invite these girls to the
wedding, suddenly we're not losers.

609
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,678
We're winners!

610
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,182
Here they come.
They're coming.

611
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,156
Hey, this might sound crazy...

612
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,888
but our little sister is
getting married in Hawaii...

613
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:12,157
and we wanted to know
if you guys wanted to come with.

614
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,097
Can you just give
us a second to...

615
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,901
Of course.

616
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,010
Okay, so just whisper
like we're talking it over...

617
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,270
like we're not sure
if we wanna go or not.

618
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,335
Like...

619
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,177
What the fuck are you doing?

620
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,878
I don't understand
why we're arguing!

621
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,115
I thought we wanted to go.

622
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,518
All right, fuck it.
Let's go to Hawaii!

623
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,057
-Yes! Fuck yes!
-Hawaii!

624
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,924
<i>Yo, what you know
about gain' out?</i>

625
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,228
<i>Head west, red Lex
TV's all up in the headrest</i>

626
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,565
<i>Try and live it up, ride
true, a bigger truck</i>

627
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,128
<i>Peeps a" glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?</i>

628
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,104
<i>Jig wit it 'cuz ship
crisp, split it all</i>

629
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,336
<i>Ho's ride, get your nut
'till I can't get it up</i>

630
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,638
<i>Bad, bad, bad, bad boy</i>

631
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,078
<i>You make me feel so good</i>

632
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,137
Aloha, and welcome.

633
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,305
-Hi.
-Aloha.

634
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,543
For real?

635
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,142
Let me get you gentlemen
checked in, yeah?

636
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,320
Holy shit, this place is nice!

637
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,585
It's gonna be more nice.

638
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,990
Nice girls don't show
off their ecstasy.

639
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,459
One of these is a multivitamin.

640
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,620
Is this shit free?

641
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,495
I can smoke weed out of this,
I can smoke weed out of this...

642
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,830
Look at that teacher,
grabbing her apple a day.

643
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,104
Look at that personality
from behind.

644
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,209
It is, dare I say...

645
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,844
well-rounded.

646
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:29,935
Look at Mike.

647
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,274
He looks like a funhouse mirror
version of a better looking dude...

648
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,579
but he is just that dude.

649
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,811
Dave, it is so on this weekend.

650
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,354
I am not touching this guy
the whole weekend.

651
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,822
He thinks just because he brought
me here I'm gonna sleep with him?

652
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:43,882
Check it out.

653
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,155
If this was Mike's
dick, I'd be like...

654
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,027
<i>Duo, duo, duo, duo, duo...</i>

655
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,621
I'd get close, but
I'd never touch it.

656
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,631
They have such beautiful
flowers here.

657
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,203
She's throwing out
serious vibes right now.

658
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,432
I'm like, I'm hungry.

659
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,701
I'm gonna butter them biscuits.

660
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,636
I'm gonna haste them ham hocks.

661
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,209
I'm gonna be like a sex chef.

662
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,309
Mr. Grey will see you now.

663
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,840
I'm gonna touch Dave.

664
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,380
Every time he says
something sweet...

665
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,576
I wanna get some rope and chain
in bulk from Home Depot...

666
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,652
and just see where it takes us,
you know?

667
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,585
That is messed up.

668
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,988
Ladies, your wedding
itineraries.

669
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,626
#DoingltForJeanie.

670
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,559
Today, we have
the meet and greet by the pool.

671
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,686
And then after that,
we have a dolphin excursion.

672
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,255
Friday is the rehearsal dinner.

673
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,628
That's where Dave and I are
gonna be doing our big speech.

674
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,728
Will there be any downtime?

675
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,567
Yeah, 'cause I gotta
keep in touch with the office.

676
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,936
I gotta call my stocks
about the state of my bonds.

677
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:33,999
It happens a lot.

678
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,712
Kay, I think we are
right up here.

679
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,211
Great. So which one
is me and Alice's room?

680
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:46,253
I don't know. Are you and
Alice gonna share a room?

681
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,721
Or I was thinking
that maybe you and I...

682
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,521
would stay in the same room.

683
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,523
That sounds interesting...

684
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,689
but I don't think
it would be a good idea.

685
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,025
Why not?

686
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,097
Because I don't
trust myself around you.

687
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,038
You can trust me.

688
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,439
I do trust you.

689
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,543
Let's trust each other.

690
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,775
There's so much trust.

691
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,316
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

692
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,582
I respect you so much,
I can't wait to get you alone.

693
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,920
Yeah, we're gonna cover all
the room charges and stuff...

694
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,482
for up to $50 per day.

695
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,652
My God.
You don't have to do that.

696
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,921
I'm a very strict teacher.

697
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,895
You be Michelle Pfeiffer from
Dangerous Minds, and I'll be...

698
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,330
I'll be Coolio.

699
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,436
Coolio's not in that movie.

700
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,637
He is in song and spirit.

701
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,537
I'm gonna call
a parent-teacher conference...

702
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,409
and tell them
what a bad boy you are.

703
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,843
Please don't tell my mommy.

704
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,447
Please don't tell my daddy.

705
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,507
I think Wi-Fi is
included, too, so...

706
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,780
-That's always nice. Yeah.
-Yeah.

707
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:55,047
If I were to give you a grade,
I'd give you a D.

708
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,319
A big, hard D.

709
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,856
Why? I deserve an A.

710
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,451
What are you talking about?

711
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,653
Nothing.

712
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,162
In conclusion...

713
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,698
I'm gonna stay in the room...

714
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:05,926
with Alice.

715
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,027
That one, with Alice.

716
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,537
Cool, cool. No doubt.

717
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,103
Somebody overcooked
the soft pretzel.

718
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,576
My dick is hard. That's what I'm
saying. Give me five minutes.

719
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,175
My God.!

720
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,380
<i>Lift it, drop it, shake it</i>

721
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,116
<i>It's going down for real</i>

722
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,526
<i>It's going down for real</i>

723
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,464
Grandma, I'd like
you to meet Alice.

724
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,329
She's super smart, great conversationalist,
and she works on Wall Street.

725
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,734
But I'm one of the good ones.

726
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,303
I think she is.

727
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,236
<i>Lam a teacher, yeah.</i>

728
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,172
And you know what? The key to
teaching children is repetition.

729
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,245
You'd be surprised
how stupid they are.

730
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,080
Jeanie!

731
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,424
'HEY. you!
Hi! Hi!

732
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,421
I'm so proud to introduce
our wedding dates...

733
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,225
-Tatiana.
-And Alice.

734
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,763
Hi!

735
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,831
-The bride. The gorgeous bride.
-Hi.

736
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,703
This weekend is all about you
being happy and not shattered.

737
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,005
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

738
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,241
Check out your arms. You got
some Michelle Obama arms.

739
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,948
How'd you get those guns
on the plane, girl?

740
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,518
Eric...

741
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,282
you are two points hotter
just being next to this woman.

742
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,016
Try 10 points hotter.

743
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,184
-Try a million.
-That's too many points.

744
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,248
And Jeanie, nice snag.

745
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,383
Thank you.

746
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,952
You guys
look great together, really.

747
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,459
I'm liking this.

748
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,530
Maybe you two will keep these
two in check a little bit.

749
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,431
I think we can.

750
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,931
I'll just keep him on a leash.

751
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,867
Maybe don't hurt him.

752
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,406
I like these girls.

753
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,632
They're so fun.

754
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,901
Unlike my maid of honor.

755
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,169
She's having a time.

756
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,404
How is ol' Becky Grammerstein?

757
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,602
She's coming.

758
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,044
-Jeanie.
-Hey.

759
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,581
I'm in crisis mode.

760
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,377
I ordered Prosecco for
the mani-pedis...

761
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,644
and all they have is champagne!

762
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:04,809
Aren't they the same thing?

763
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,455
-No. No, they're not. No.
-No?

764
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,752
Hello, Michael.

765
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,915
Hi, Dave.

766
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,886
Look, I'm trying to make
your dreams come true, okay?

767
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,121
-Right.
-What?

768
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,097
If this is bad news,
I'm gonna eat your ass.

769
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,226
-Sorry.
-Okay.

770
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,236
Purple. It better be purple.

771
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,639
I should probably
go see to that.

772
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:24,796
-You'll come?
-Yeah.

773
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,237
Thank you so much
for being here.

774
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:29,344
Guys, good job with these two.

775
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,980
<i>Mahala.</i>

776
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,409
Bye, Jeanie.

777
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,571
Jeanie likes the girls.

778
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:34,944
Jeanie likes the girls

779
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,642
<i>Talk about Jeanie
Jeanie likes the girls</i>

780
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,584
<i>Because it's a" about

781
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,748
<i>Oil, yeah, Jeanie likes

782
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,324
<i>-It's a" about Jeanie

783
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,224
<i>-it's all about Jeanie likes the girls!
-Mike. Where are the girls?</i>

784
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,489
-Hello!
-I'm Alice.

785
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,856
I just I wanna give you a hug.

786
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,364
It's so nice to meet you.

787
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,795
Fucking A. You
distracted me, man.

788
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,991
This dress is lucky to
be on you. Those pins!

789
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,194
-My Mike?
-Yes.

790
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,531
-I can't...
-He did.

791
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,366
That's fantastic.

792
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,233
Mike, Tatiana was
just telling me...

793
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,775
that you saved her life.

794
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,206
I most certainly did, Father.

795
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,175
You see how great it is
to have nice girls around?

796
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,510
I mean, these are nice girls.

797
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,709
Absolutely.

798
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,977
They are. And we
brought them, so...

799
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,314
Excuse me.

800
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,509
Excuse me.

801
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:12,577
See you in a minute.
Honey, come on.

802
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,817
Can I get everybody's attention?
Could we gather around?

803
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,256
-My God.
-My God!

804
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,156
We're killing this shit!
We're killing.

805
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,488
Mom and Dad like the girls!

806
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,129
<i>Mom andDad/ike the girls</i>

807
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:26,793
Hi, I'm Keith. I'm Eric's
best man, his cousin...

808
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,960
and his best friend.

809
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,639
Welcome to the meet and greet!

810
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,338
Yeah!

811
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,669
Put your hands together...

812
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,973
for Eric and his
lovely bride, Jeanie.

813
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,709
Give it up!

814
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,010
Jeanie!

815
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,642
Hey, everybody. A big thank you
to my new family, the Stangles.

816
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,913
We love you, Eric!

817
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,012
Thank you.

818
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,217
And to my own family,
I must say...

819
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,888
Portland, Oregon in the house!

820
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,332
I'm really happy to finally
make you all my ahana...

821
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,864
which means "family."

822
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,059
And as the Hawaiians say...

823
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,431
<i>Kale maluna!</i>

824
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,665
Which translates loosely
into "bottoms up."

825
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,537
But more closely translated,
it actually means...

826
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,177
"your butts to the sky"...

827
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,839
which is inappropriate.

828
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,707
This is gonna be magic.

829
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,583
Thank you all again,
so much, for being here.

830
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:22,418
We are so happy
to have you at our wedding.

831
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,724
<i>Wedding. Wedding. Wedding.</i>

832
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,923
-Put the mic on the stand.
-The stand.

833
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,394
-Alice.
-Where are you going?

834
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,458
Hi! What happened?

835
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,595
You sort of zoned out for a sec.
What's up? You okay?

836
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,138
Yeah! We're at a wedding.
Wedding. Wedding.

837
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,065
You just said "wedding"
three times.

838
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,235
I'm fine. Yeah!

839
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,074
Let's just forget about
the past, and move on.

840
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,972
To the bar!

841
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,343
To the bar?

842
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,220
I don't think these are shots.

843
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,947
I mean, we're drinking 'em
like they're shots...

844
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,286
but I don't think they're
supposed to be drunk like that.

845
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,393
Your face is funny.

846
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,974
Hey, Mike.

847
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,805
I was just talking
to my new friend, Tatiana.

848
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,076
Tatiana, this is
my cousin, Mike.

849
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,445
She knows who I am.
She's my date.

850
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,348
Why would someone this
attractive ever be with you?

851
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,850
Are you gonna hit on my date all
weekend, like bisexual Fonzie?

852
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,990
I don't think it's gonna take
all weekend. Am I right?

853
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,688
So, you guys are cousins?

854
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,590
She's been jealous of me
since I was a little kid.

855
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,196
What could I possibly
be jealous of?

856
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,596
Your outfit looks like Jimmy
Buffet's dust ruffle.

857
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,028
Do you guys always do this?

858
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,965
Okay, this is actually
a very fashion-forward outfit.

859
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,606
No, you look like the wallpaper
from a Long John Silver's bathroom.

860
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,366
Cool.
I'm gonna hit the buffet now...

861
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,172
while you guys do
whatever it is you're doing.

862
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,275
Okay?

863
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,339
Good idea.

864
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:56,811
Look at that.

865
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,012
Pink little ass just
bouncing away, saying...

866
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,615
<i>Terry, come getme
Terry, come get me</i>

867
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,784
No, it's saying...

868
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:07,853
<i>Mike, crawl up in this
Mike, cra wl up in this</i>

869
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,794
What's up, double trouble?

870
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,228
Terry. Cousin of the bride.

871
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,529
Get at me later,
we'll make a Terry sandwich.

872
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,169
Don't touch her.
She has chlamydia.

873
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,463
-Everybody does.
-No.

874
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:16,894
Not everyone does.

875
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:20,008
Saw you and Dave are doing your speech
together at the rehearsal dinner.

876
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,669
I'm going to bring the
house down with my speech.

877
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,676
And why do you think
you're such a hotshot?

878
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:26,975
You know Chris Rock?

879
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,741
He's my neighbor.
Practiced my speech on him.

880
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,347
And he gave me seven
killer jokes.

881
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,022
Suck on that, cousin.

882
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,682
Terry out.

883
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,559
Chris Rock? Fuck!
That sounds awesome.

884
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,268
Yas, yas, yas.

885
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,567
My God. You were right.
These cheeseburgers are amazing.

886
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:56,871
I know.

887
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,878
Being a good girl is hard.

888
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,948
I know. It sucks.

889
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,920
You were hitting that booze
too hard for a nice girl.

890
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,486
You need to get Luke
out of your head.

891
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,386
-Yeah.
-You do.

892
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,958
And what better
way to do that...

893
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,889
than good old-fashioned
dick flicks.

894
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,191
-Yes.
-God.

895
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,630
Tatiana. Mike Stangle.

896
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,795
From the meet and greet.
Well, from before that.

897
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,440
One second.

898
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,531
Fuck.

899
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,938
Hey. it's you.

900
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,205
It is me.

901
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:36,717
I was hoping maybe I could come in
and we could watch a movie or...

902
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,922
Do whatever you wanna do.

903
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,181
Why are you whispering?

904
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,451
'Cause that's what we
were doing before.

905
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,649
<i>They've got Cockbusters.</i>

906
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,793
Is that supposed to be
like Ghostbusters?

907
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,830
Why would you wanna
get rid of the cocks?

908
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,794
-What's that?
-She's talking in her sleep.

909
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,799
She says the craziest stuff
in her sleep.

910
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,064
It looks like his dick is gonna
pop. It's so veiny and hard.

911
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,128
-Tatiana!
-Something's hard?

912
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,433
Julio. My student.

913
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,132
I'm doing a Skype class
session with him...

914
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,403
and he's having a really
hard time in the schoolyard.

915
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,035
If you don't get in here,
I'm gonna start masturbating!

916
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,604
Phooey. I've gotta go.

917
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,340
That sounds like you guys are,
watching porno, or...

918
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,406
-No.
-Tatiana!

919
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,474
Does it smell like weed in here?

920
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,451
-You guys smoking weed?
-No. It was a skunk.

921
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,112
I've gotta go, because a bunch
of kids are waiting to hear...

922
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,985
if they've failed
second grade or not.

923
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,185
Well, I am doing
some grading myself, and girl...

924
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,830
you are getting an A plus.

925
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:22,887
Thank you so much.

926
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,560
-And then win!
-Skills. Def skills.

927
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,125
Cheers to Tatiana and Alice.

928
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,429
We're so glad you're here.

929
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,863
Yes. Cheers.

930
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,133
You guys, Alice and I found
this really cool thing.

931
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,004
<i>Jurassic Park ATV Tours!</i>

932
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,239
<i>Y on ride ATV s
where they shot Jurassic Park.</i>

933
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:15,645
Actually, we are about to go
swimming with the dolphins.

934
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,983
It's on the itinerary, so...

935
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,086
<i>But, guys, Jurassic P!</i>

936
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,589
I love this movie!

937
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,249
My gosh, on ATVs,
this would be so sick.

938
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,655
"Welcome...

939
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,558
"...to Jurassic Park."

940
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,757
"That is a big pile of shit."

941
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,229
"You're not so
scary, little guy."

942
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,670
What is going on here?

943
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,573
I wish we could do that...

944
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,579
but we have a date
with the dolphins...

945
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,081
at the bottom of
the ocean, so...

946
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,686
Don't you think we should do
what Jeanie wants to do?

947
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,378
I mean, it is her
wedding after all.

948
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,750
Right, Mike?

949
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,987
I'm so happy we're here!

950
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,589
This is where the dinos
ran in the prairie!

951
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,747
I know, girl!

952
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,087
Check it out! I'm
a brontosaurus!

953
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,287
I'm a T-Rex. I'm
coming to get you!

954
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,298
Guys, butts on seats, okay?
No hot dogging!

955
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,474
"They're flocking this way!"

956
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,366
Here's a T-Rex!

957
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,441
"Life finds a way."

958
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,746
Jeanie! Eric!

959
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,325
Hey!

960
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,360
Hi! Sorry, I lost Eric.

961
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:09,623
Iwasn't lost. Just driving
at a reasonable pace.

962
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,127
Stay there. We'll come to you.

963
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,603
All right, we better go around.
This ledge looks super dangerous.

964
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,966
Yeah, Mike's right.
It does look dangerous.

965
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,134
It's a good thing my middle name
is "dangerous!"

966
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,299
Yeah, it is!

967
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,151
-God!
-What?

968
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,414
My God, she's Superman!

969
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,454
My God!

970
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,824
A-Money!

971
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,802
I still think we
should go around.

972
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,201
She just got some
serious air, bro!

973
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:53,070
You call that serious air?
Check this fucking shit out.

974
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,275
<i>Suck my d', tuckers!</i>

975
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,240
Not again.

976
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,241
Yeah, baby!

977
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,481
Easy does it. Nothing fancy.

978
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,489
-My God. Look at what she's doing!
-I see it!

979
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,687
Sweet candied nuts.

980
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,362
Who are these girls?

981
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,937
Where did you guys
learn to do that?

982
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,877
We lived in Baja.

983
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,610
Tore up a lot of
trail down there.

984
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,112
Made a lot of friends.

985
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,276
Made even more enemies.

986
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,614
God, I miss Baja.

987
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,621
Your turn, Mike!
Don't be a pussy!

988
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,558
I'm not gonna do it. Name calling
doesn't work on me, so...

989
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,461
Mike, it'll turn me on
if you take that jump.

990
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,397
Turn me on if you don't.

991
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,559
Still not going to, still.

992
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,727
I'm not gonna do it.

993
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,032
Like we would ever do that.

994
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,970
No way.

995
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,031
Come on! Do it.

996
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:02,472
He's not gonna do it. Do it!

997
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,112
Do not do it.

998
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,906
No, definitely don't do that.

999
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,014
It's a bad idea. it's a stupid,
dumb idea.

1000
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,244
-And it's dangerous, and it's foolish.
-Yes, it is.

1001
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,981
I'm gonna do it!

1002
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:14,679
Mike!

1003
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,818
Shit!

1004
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:20,789
I'm never gonna die!

1005
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,695
-Shit.
-He going fast.

1006
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,394
No. Keep it straight!

1007
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,397
He's shanking it.

1008
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,976
Got it, got it!

1009
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,481
No, God!

1010
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,642
Jeanie, move!

1011
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,988
No!

1012
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,181
No!

1013
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,950
No!

1014
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,356
No!

1015
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,115
It's gonna be fine.

1016
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,646
Your face is making me think
it's gonna be bad.

1017
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,621
I'm sure it's not as
bad as you think.

1018
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,714
-You know?
-No. Yeah.

1019
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,918
Just show us
what we're working with,

1020
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,083
and it'll be fine.

1021
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,150
-0kay_
-Okay?

1022
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:27,821
Is it okay?

1023
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,421
-My God!
-God!

1024
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,199
Don't you look good?

1025
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,867
-Your face!
-Shut up, Mike!

1026
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,802
You shut up, Becky!
Have you seen her face?

1027
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,805
God! What?

1028
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,240
It looks like you were making
meth, and the bathtub exploded.

1029
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,810
You look like Burn
Victim Barbie.

1030
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,510
Hush it up!

1031
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,842
And you're Black Ken.

1032
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,851
-stop!
-Okay_

1033
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,078
it's like an
exaggerated smoky eye.

1034
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,144
Dave, be honest. Is it bad?

1035
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,085
This side, there's a little...

1036
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,320
-There's a little discoloration there.
-Little discoloration.

1037
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,521
Which side is it?

1038
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,923
You could do a dance
the whole night

1039
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,522
where you just hold a
hand over your face.

1040
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,655
-That's smart.
-Okay.

1041
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:05,823
It's like a new thing.

1042
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,833
Do the Jeanie
Do the Jeanie

1043
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,696
Like this?

1044
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,736
-Come on, everybody! Do the Jeanie.
-Do it.

1045
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,306
-I'm doing the Jeanie.
-Do the Jeanie, y'all.

1046
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:14,432
It's a one-two step.

1047
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,374
All right, that's enough.

1048
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,238
Enough dancing!
You and you...

1049
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,746
outside, now!

1050
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,110
Honey, calm down.

1051
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,409
-Honey, calm down.
-Sorry.

1052
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,919
Do you understand they've
deformed our little girl...

1053
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,216
the day before her
goddamn wedding?

1054
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,619
She looks like Seal,
for Christ's sake!

1055
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,525
Why, Dad?

1056
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,029
Do you think he's
gonna spank us?

1057
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,188
What?

1058
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:39,957
Never mind.

1059
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,037
I haven't seen him this pissed
in a long time.

1060
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,127
<i>OOP...</i>

1061
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,036
Yeah. it's the other door.

1062
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,067
They meet in the middle.

1063
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,735
-They meet in the middle.
-God damn it!

1064
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,313
Dad, listen.
I know what you're gonna say.

1065
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,713
-You're right.
-We're gonna sue the ATV companies.

1066
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,979
<i>-Right?
-I Sea.</i>

1067
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,108
Not what I was gonna say.

1068
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,482
Let's Erin Brockovich
this bitch.

1069
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,213
Mike, stop!

1070
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,619
You've got to own this.
This is your fault.

1071
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,682
It's not.

1072
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,252
If anything, it's
the girls' fault.

1073
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,826
They're crazy.

1074
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,398
The girls aren't the problem!

1075
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,832
You are.

1076
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,129
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?

1077
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,999
What did you think
was gonna happen?

1078
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,162
We had a plan.

1079
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,741
The plan was to swim
with dolphins...

1080
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,605
and eat bananas afterwards.

1081
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,507
See, Dad, I'm not gonna
point any fingers here...

1082
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:25,669
but indirectly...

1083
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,510
we wouldn't have been on ATVs if
the girls hadn't forced us to.

1084
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,118
And who made us bring dates
in the first place?

1085
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,346
-Not pointing fingers.
-Yeah.

1086
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,651
All right. I'm gonna take back
what I said to you earlier.

1087
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,952
I am going to lump
you in together.

1088
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,925
All right, you are lumped!

1089
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,496
The hell is wrong with you?

1090
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,999
What the hell is wrong with you?

1091
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:48,968
Dad.

1092
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,006
Fuck.

1093
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,603
Everyone get the
fuck away from me.

1094
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,180
Move! Adult Swim!

1095
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,614
It's all fucked now. It's all
fucked, you know? Poor Jeanie.

1096
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,784
Jeanie's special
weekend, and I ruin it.

1097
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,416
Hey, hey, hey, Alice?
That was not your fault, okay?

1098
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,524
That's two weddings that I've ruined.
It's just like, "Stupid Alice!"

1099
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,961
Look, it's too bad that
Jeanie's face got shredded...

1100
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,856
but this is supposed
to be our vacay.

1101
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,729
Remember? We're supposed
to be having fun...

1102
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,927
and going on adventures.

1103
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,094
Get in here with me.

1104
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,601
I'm gonna find her.
I'm gonna make it up to her.

1105
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,263
No, no! You're not listening
to me. Don't leave me!

1106
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,977
Thanks again for letting me
join your spa day, ladies.

1107
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,784
It's not like you asked or
anything, but you're here. Yay.

1108
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,316
What did you guys do
for your bachelorette party?

1109
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,491
Did it get crazy?
Did you guys do that thing...

1110
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,359
where you go to Vegas and you
dress up as a prostitute...

1111
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,393
and you go out and
there's a contest...

1112
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,661
to see who can get the
most money from a john...

1113
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,766
but then you tell him,
"I'm an undercover cop"...

1114
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,863
and they, like, beg that you don't
tell their children and their wives...

1115
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,668
and they piss themselves, and you've
got the whole thing on video.

1116
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,903
And then you put it on YouTube and
then there's the Auto-Tune remix.

1117
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,069
Did you do that thing?

1118
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:06,806
-No.
-No.

1119
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:11,643
I didn't actually end up
having one, so...

1120
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,447
Why? Every bride
needs a bachelorette party.

1121
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,817
I'm sorry Cabo didn't
work out, Jeanie.

1122
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,381
I know. it's fine.

1123
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,518
You know I couldn't get
the time off work.

1124
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,994
And it would have ruined it for
you, down there without me.

1125
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,223
Is there some
tension about this?

1126
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,926
So I just thought, "Let's cancel the
whole trip," if that makes sense.

1127
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,968
Jeanie, can you keep it down?
On the phone with Tokyo.

1128
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,128
Did I bring up something
uncomfortable?

1129
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,536
Also, I caught the shingles
because it was so stressful.

1130
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,566
'Cause it feels like I did.

1131
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,166
Plus they have Mexican bed bugs.

1132
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,012
I need you guys to stop it!

1133
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,381
That fucking gaping mouth
of yours, shut it!

1134
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:44,942
Shut it!

1135
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:49,118
I just want to relax!
Is that too much to ask?

1136
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:52,119
Please! I just wanna relax.

1137
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,059
How are you feeling, Jeanie?

1138
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,699
A little stressed out.

1139
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,699
-I'll give you a minute to disrobe.
-Yeah, okay.

1140
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,929
Face down on the table.

1141
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,797
Hi, that is my best
friend in there...

1142
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,037
and she's getting married tomorrow,
and she's a little uptight.

1143
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:14,476
And I was wondering if you could,
help her let loose a little bit?

1144
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,673
You know?

1145
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:20,745
Give her the "Hawaii
Five" experience?

1146
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,751
The wink-wink, nudge-nudge
massage, you know?

1147
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:27,318
I can't really wink,
but a wink-wink, nudge-nudge?

1148
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,359
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1149
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,092
Looks like you had
a bit of a fit.

1150
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,859
No, no. That's wink...
That's wink-wink...

1151
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,332
I feel like I've gotten
what you're trying to say.

1152
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,802
-Great.
-But I figured it out.

1153
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,469
-You didn't really communicate it to me.
-Okay, that's fair.

1154
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,379
Yes, you want the special
"lam blissful" massage?

1155
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,608
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1156
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,151
-How blissful is that?
-Don't worry.

1157
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,845
Physically, no penetration.

1158
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:54,945
Classy.

1159
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:58,016
Spiritually, I'll be doing
an intimate tour of her qi.

1160
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,352
You're gonna be good in there.
I can tell.

1161
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:02,622
How's the temperature
in here, Jeanie?

1162
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,297
It's good. Good. Comfy.

1163
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,800
Good. Take down the
light a little bit.

1164
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,666
So you're getting married?

1165
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,464
I am. Yeah.

1166
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,542
I know it can be a
stressful time.

1167
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,513
You know it's like, "Who is
this for, me or my family?"

1168
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,116
Yeah. I've recently had
an injury to my face...

1169
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,274
which I'm a little
stressed out about.

1170
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:25,976
Are you okay with oil?

1171
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,451
Yeah, sure.

1172
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,721
You know, in my country...

1173
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:35,059
they call oil "God's
beautiful lubricant."

1174
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:38,226
It sounds better in my language.

1175
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,528
<i>Khuda Ira khubsurat lubricant.</i>

1176
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,396
That's lovely.

1177
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,495
<i>'KT!..</i>

1178
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,972
Some ground rules.

1179
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,635
One, no emotions.

1180
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,804
-Okay.
-Two, breathe.

1181
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,509
Three, there is no penetration,
only vibration.

1182
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,186
What is happening?

1183
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,785
I call this "The Bent Penguin."

1184
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,426
This one is just
"The Ham and Eggs."

1185
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,495
This one is called
"When Moons Collide."

1186
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,155
"Angry Hummingbird."
"Angry Hummingbird."

1187
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,699
This one is called
"House by the Airport."

1188
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,098
Just checking in.
Everything good?

1189
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,934
Hope you're enjoying this. For
me, it's just another Friday.

1190
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,879
"Happy Doll."

1191
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:33,046
This one is just called
"Taking a Break." I am pooped.

1192
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,952
A little break. That's nice.

1193
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:38,986
Here we go again.

1194
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,420
Are you even touching me?

1195
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,099
No, but my aura is.

1196
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,926
Yes, it is!

1197
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,403
Sweet baby Jesus!

1198
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:10,651
How's it going?

1199
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,661
Shit, I thought I
was alone in here.

1200
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,764
Yeah. You're not.
I mean, we're alone.

1201
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,698
How's Mike? Still
really jealous of me?

1202
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:24,101
It's like, yeah, okay,
do I own a Tesla? Yes.

1203
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,901
Do I make a shit-ton of money,
like, way more than Mike?

1204
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,372
Yes. But it's like, who cares?

1205
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,603
Do I get backstage
tickets to Rihanna?

1206
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,438
Do I have a glass blowing
studio in my basement?

1207
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,505
Hold up, backstage
tickets to Rihanna?

1208
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,583
Yeah, she likes to have
me around. You know.

1209
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,688
-RiRi is Alice's jam.
-RiRi, is it?

1210
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:41,779
-Yes.
-That's funny.

1211
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:44,425
She would freak out if I got her
backstage tickets to Rihanna.

1212
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,721
Well, you could get her tickets.
From me. I'm right here.

1213
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,261
Are you serious?

1214
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,730
God, steam rooms just open up
your pores, you know?

1215
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,427
They open up everything.

1216
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:02,806
Backstage at RiRi is very fun.
Sometimes she plays the DJ.

1217
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,540
You know, just scratching
records. You know like...

1218
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,646
Shit, man. That's...

1219
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:15,147
Are you saying you want me to
get in there for the tickets?

1220
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,954
No. No, no, no. No.

1221
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,455
Yes.

1222
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,464
Tatiana?

1223
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,630
Tatiana?

1224
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,496
Sorry about that.
Looking for my wedding date.

1225
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,063
Tatiana?

1226
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,301
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1227
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,503
Please leave, sir.

1228
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:40,909
What are you doing to my sister?

1229
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,608
-Mike, I'm coming.
-No!

1230
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,323
Get out!

1231
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:02,769
Sure. Sure. Sure.

1232
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,769
So, are we, like, close, or...

1233
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,500
Let's put the washing machine
on spin cycle. There we go.

1234
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,607
What the... Tatiana!

1235
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,973
Terry!

1236
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:13,478
Terry!

1237
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,878
-Tatiana!
-Shut the fuck up, Mike.

1238
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:20,715
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1239
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,225
He is losing this fight!

1240
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,428
God! I can see your nipple!

1241
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:34,661
Get your butt out of my face!

1242
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,972
Well, thank you so much.

1243
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,036
I definitely needed this.

1244
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,012
I know. Bring this gift
into your marriage.

1245
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:52,247
-All you need is load-bearing ribbons.
-Okay.

1246
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,912
And a reinforced ceiling.

1247
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,252
I should warn you...

1248
00:51:56,379 --> 00:52:00,452
you may experience some
aftershock orgasms.

1249
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:05,226
So, I wouldn't operate any heavy
machinery for a couple weeks.

1250
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,994
That is not a euphemism
for penis. I mean like...

1251
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:12,607
-tractors, cranes, big boats.
-Okay.

1252
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,435
Good to know.

1253
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,942
-And please hydrate.
-Okay.

1254
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,173
I cannot stress this enough.
The consequences could be...

1255
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:23,884
You could develop cancer.

1256
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,716
You have a very good friend.

1257
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,562
Wait, you did that?

1258
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,831
Yeah, well, I felt so bad
about your fucked up face...

1259
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,299
and I wanted to
make it up to you.

1260
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,266
Thank you.

1261
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,435
Hey, who needs a bachelorette
party when they have you around?

1262
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,706
-He rubbed my butt.
-Yeah?

1263
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,539
But with his butt.

1264
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,305
It was like...
He was on ribbons.

1265
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,207
I don't know what you did
with Jeanie in the spa...

1266
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,876
but she's in a great mood.

1267
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,443
Yeah, no problem.
She just needed a release.

1268
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,953
I had an idea for
your graphic novel.

1269
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,388
I thought you could do
like a Rum character,

1270
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,949
who's like Rastafarian,
and he's like...

1271
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,819
"I'm Rum Rum, get in my tum-tum,
and I play the steel drum."

1272
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,590
"You can rum,
but you cannot hide, mon."

1273
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,259
Yeah, that's awesome.
Already, that's so amazing.

1274
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:17,735
No, that's such a good idea.
How did I not think of that?

1275
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:23,802
I think when I get back, I'm gonna
stop selling liquor with Mike...

1276
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,446
and start drawing full time.

1277
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,081
-Really?
-Yeah.

1278
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:28,739
That's amazing.

1279
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,112
Do you know how few people
know what they really wanna do?

1280
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,447
But then I think about what Mike's
gonna think about it all...

1281
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,490
and he's gonna hate that idea.

1282
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,352
He's so clingy.

1283
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,358
When we were kids,
if I fell asleep before Mike...

1284
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,488
he would always wake me up
so he wouldn't feel alone.

1285
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,495
-That's kinda sweet.
-Yeah.

1286
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,292
I don't know. I just...

1287
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,470
Do you ever get that feeling...

1288
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:55,132
that you're not good enough
to get what you really want...

1289
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:57,107
so you're too scared to try?

1290
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,143
All the time.

1291
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:03,613
-Really?
-Like, all the time. it's terrifying.

1292
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,650
-It is, it's terrifying.
-Yeah.

1293
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:06,810
You're, like, stuck.

1294
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,615
-Totally.
-Yeah.

1295
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,280
Thanks. it's nice talking to you
about this.

1296
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,105
Hey. where you going?

1297
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,573
Is there a gang bang in the
ballroom you need to emcee?

1298
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,110
Don't be such a drama king.

1299
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,906
Yeah, I'm totally overreacting.

1300
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,375
When you invite someone
to a wedding...

1301
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:34,811
they obviously are supposed to
finger diddle your family members.

1302
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:35,872
That's common courtesy!

1303
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,315
Okay, hold up.
Lam a grown-ass woman.

1304
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,545
I can finger diddle
whomever I want.

1305
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,180
Just because you say "whomever"
does not make it okay.

1306
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,816
It's not a big deal.
It's just like texting someone.

1307
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,996
It's just like Tinder.

1308
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:53,623
Swipe right, swipe right, swipe
left. Swipe left, swipe right.

1309
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,499
That's very graphic.
That is...

1310
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:58,698
Rotating your photos. Expanding
them, contracting them.

1311
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:01,399
Are you deliberately trying to hurt
me? Is that what you're doing?

1312
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:04,101
What? No! I was just trying
to get RiRi tickets...

1313
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,113
to make my best friend
feel better, okay?

1314
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,771
We're on Va cay.

1315
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:10,840
No...

1316
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,716
You are invited to my sister's wedding.
You're supposed to smile, nod...

1317
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,084
and do what I want you to do.

1318
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,247
That's the deal.

1319
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,690
I thought that we
had a connection.

1320
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,251
Like a spark.

1321
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,365
You thought you were gonna bring me here
so that you could have sex with me.

1322
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,168
Yes. No! What? Yeah, right.

1323
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:28,224
Really?

1324
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,900
Yes, obviously.

1325
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,099
You are so hot.
And you smell good.

1326
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,039
It's not a weird thing that I
wanna have sex with you...

1327
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,145
because you are very sexy...

1328
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,406
and you were leading me on,
and we are in Hawaii...

1329
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,447
which is a sexy place,
and people have sex here.

1330
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,915
God, dude, you built this
all up in your head.

1331
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,952
Alice and I just
saw you on TV...

1332
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,918
-wanted to go to Hawaii.
-Hold up.

1333
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:50,947
Fuck.

1334
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,115
You saw us on TV?

1335
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,284
<i>No, I don't even watch
Wendy Williams.</i>

1336
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:00,557
What?

1337
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,327
What?

1338
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,734
I thought you dug me.

1339
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,168
Are you even a teacher?

1340
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:10,166
No.

1341
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,334
What about little Julio...

1342
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,640
the dyslexic boy
who you taught how to read?

1343
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,181
Made it up.
All of it.

1344
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:18,615
Although I did have sex
with this guy name Julio once...

1345
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,277
and I'm pretty sure
he couldn't read.

1346
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,747
<i>Here I thought you were Michelle
Pfeiffer from Dangerous Minds.</i>

1347
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,086
Turns out, you're Michelle
Pfeiffer from Scarf ace.

1348
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,194
And you didn't even

1349
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:31,730
say hello to my little friend.

1350
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,169
Come on, man.

1351
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,299
Mike.

1352
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,786
I'm really sorry...

1353
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,983
I've been acting crazy.

1354
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,955
It's probably about Luke, my ex.

1355
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:05,192
Yeah. The guy who
died in the plane crash...

1356
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,994
with cancer, and
AIDS, and stuff.

1357
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,865
Yeah, that's the one.

1358
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,666
Except none of that stuff
happened, 'cause...

1359
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:18,070
I lied.

1360
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:19,135
You lied?

1361
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,375
<i>I can't do this.</i>

1362
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,440
<i>Wait.</i>

1363
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,575
<i>Sorry.</i>

1364
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,348
<i>-That's okay. That's okay.
-Sorry everyone.</i>

1365
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,584
<i>[just forgot my phone.
Can I grab my phone?</i>

1366
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:33,555
<i>Sorry, I still don't
want to get married.</i>

1367
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,357
My gosh.

1368
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,399
That's almost as bad
as the plane crash story.

1369
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,703
Why didn't you just tell me?

1370
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,867
I didn't want you to think
I was damaged goods.

1371
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,839
I would never think that.

1372
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:51,873
"Love hurts.

1373
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,542
"Love scars.

1374
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:58,516
"Love wounds, and mars."

1375
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:03,718
That's from a really old song,
for old people.

1376
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,789
Why are you so nice?

1377
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,732
'Cause I think you're nice.

1378
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:19,963
David!

1379
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,538
David, I need you here
with me now. Come on.

1380
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,940
No. No.

1381
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,746
Stangles, assemble. Now!

1382
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,611
-Let's go.
-Is he okay?

1383
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:30,707
Yeah, I think he's fine.

1384
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:31,774
He's just got a lot on his mind.

1385
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:32,976
Let's go!

1386
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,612
Okay, I'm coming, dude. Jeez.

1387
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:38,619
I...

1388
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,626
You gave me a boost up.
Okay.

1389
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,803
A line has been drawn, David.

1390
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,562
A clear line in the sand.

1391
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,233
Is that why you brought me
all the way down here...

1392
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:56,436
so you could literally
draw a line in the sand?

1393
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:57,705
I'm a visual thinker, David.

1394
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,075
-God damn it!
-Son of a...

1395
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,180
These girls, they've gotta go.

1396
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:07,415
They pretended to dig us just
to get a free trip to Hawaii.

1397
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:08,851
They're liars!

1398
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,083
So what, man? So they lied.

1399
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:12,925
I was talking to Alice.

1400
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,928
You have no idea
what this girl's been through.

1401
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,587
She needed this trip.
We might have saved her life.

1402
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,867
We should be practicing
our speech for tonight.

1403
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,336
Not babysitting the twins
from The Shining.

1404
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,674
My God.

1405
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,173
Why are you laughing at me?

1406
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,445
You sound like mom and dad
when they're talking about us.

1407
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,447
Well, no, fuck that noise.

1408
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,208
Guess what! You're
gonna love this.

1409
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:41,287
Tatiana was jerking
off our cousin Terry.

1410
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,117
What?

1411
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,317
Cousin Terry has a dick?

1412
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,251
No, not "jerking
off" jerking off.

1413
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,489
The female version of jerking.

1414
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,324
Dude, let's just chill out...

1415
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:52,625
focus on Jeanie,
and try not to be assholes...

1416
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,132
for the rest of the weekend,
okay? Can we do that?

1417
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,828
I can't do that, David.

1418
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,296
Because I saw our
little sister...

1419
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,129
What?

1420
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,408
Well, let's just say
she was making this face...

1421
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,509
What? She saw a ghost?

1422
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,050
She really had to pee?

1423
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,409
Doing vocal warmups?

1424
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,950
What are you doing? It looks
like you're having an orgasm.

1425
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:19,357
She was, David!
With the masseuse.

1426
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,225
-What!
-Yes!

1427
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:22,555
My God!

1428
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,858
-She orgasms like a star.
-No!

1429
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,093
What's next?

1430
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:30,827
I'm gonna walk in on mom
giving dad a Push Pop?

1431
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:32,529
What's a Push Pop?

1432
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:36,007
I made it up, Dave. It's a
sexual term that I just made up.

1433
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,702
-What's a Push Pop?
-I don't know.

1434
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,645
-What's a Push Pop?
-I don't know!

1435
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:41,943
What's a Push Pop?

1436
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,508
I've been to the bowels of the Internet,
and I've never seen a Push Pop.

1437
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,244
God,just tell me!
What's a Push Pop?

1438
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,355
It's a whole hand
up an ass, David.

1439
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,422
Is that what you want me to say?

1440
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,959
-God!
-Two hands pushin' the pop.

1441
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,121
-God.
-Is that what you want me to say?

1442
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,755
I'll send you some links.

1443
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,245
-We're at table two.
-I'll be at the bar.

1444
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,945
-I said table two.
-I'll be at the bar!

1445
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,282
You're out of control!

1446
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,113
Thank you.

1447
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,818
Trouble in paradise?

1448
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,866
Freaking I don't care
if I cause a scene.

1449
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,971
Freaking I will punch you 17,000
times in the face. Freaking.

1450
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,128
Take a shot.

1451
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,200
You look like Don Johnson
fucked Zack Morris.

1452
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:45,811
Wait till Tatiana hears your shitty
speech after my crazy dope one.

1453
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,345
She's never gonna
touch your baby bird again.

1454
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,112
Thriller-Terry out!

1455
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,277
So sad!

1456
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:55,684
My God.
It's a movie about cameras

1457
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,052
just following you everywhere.

1458
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,624
<i>-Like The Truman Show.
-Yeah! Exactly like The Truman Show!</i>

1459
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:01,389
Hey, Dave! Dave!

1460
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,791
Hey, what's up?

1461
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:05,626
I need you to come backstage right
now and practice the speech.

1462
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,060
Dude, I'm kind of
talking to Alice right now.

1463
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,966
Which is a conversation
you've now interrupted twice.

1464
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,333
Our speech needs to kill.

1465
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,532
Terry got a punch
up from Chris Rock.

1466
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,243
I didn't want to tell you before because
I didn't want you to freak out.

1467
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,401
I'm not freaking out.

1468
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:19,877
Calm the fuck down, Dave!

1469
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,174
You calm the fuck down!

1470
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,112
Mike, you look like
your face is gonna pop.

1471
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,148
You gonna come or what?

1472
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,619
Let's go.

1473
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,349
I'll see you backstage.

1474
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,986
-I'm gonna go deal with this real quick.
-Okay.

1475
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,996
I'll just talk to myself
for a while. All alone.

1476
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,030
<i>look an your stupid face!</i>

1477
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,626
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

1478
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,365
<i>Dan't fucking look at her.
Turn around.</i>

1479
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,838
<i>Everybody get the
fuck out of here.</i>

1480
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,238
<i>Fuck you, Luke.</i>

1481
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,168
<i>I'm just gonna have
a little lie down, okay?</i>

1482
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:03,317
Hi!

1483
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,924
"Hi!
"Hi!

1484
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,120
Did you need to
take a little breather, too?

1485
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,685
No. Why? Are you?

1486
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,230
Well...

1487
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:14,332
You know, you think that
every moment is going to feel...

1488
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,700
warm and glowy...

1489
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,602
and absolutely magical.

1490
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,608
But, then, some stuff happens.

1491
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:23,770
-Sure does.
-Yeah.

1492
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:29,378
Well, if you want
warm, glowy and magical...

1493
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,309
I have just the thing.

1494
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,113
I don't leave home without it.

1495
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,220
Every bride deserves to have a little
fun the night before her wedding!

1496
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,263
Yeah. I deserve to
have a little fun.

1497
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,227
You are so nice to me.

1498
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,562
This is gonna be so much fun!

1499
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,102
We should find
something to suck on.

1500
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,163
What?

1501
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,231
Mike!

1502
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,470
Here. Put these on.

1503
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:58,538
-We need headsets?
-Yeah!

1504
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:01,211
There's a lot of dancing
in our speech, my man. Right?

1505
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,476
Gotta go hands free.

1506
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,108
This is how we do it, baby.

1507
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,210
Come on. Hey, check this out.

1508
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,346
I'm going to "wedding
crash" cousin Terry.

1509
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:09,481
What?

1510
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:10,580
Put a few eye drops
in her drink.

1511
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,421
That way she shits all night,
and can't do the speech.

1512
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:13,653
Just like in the movie
Wedding Crashers.

1513
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,591
Mike, that is a terrible idea.

1514
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,927
-You've seen the movie!
-Of course I've seen the movie.

1515
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,898
-You love that movie.
-Everyone loves that movie.

1516
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,401
How's it a bad idea
if you love the movie?

1517
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,437
I love Taken. I don't want
to go steal little girls.

1518
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,199
But we shouldn't wedding crash
our own cousin.

1519
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,501
I'm worried about you, man.

1520
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,439
I'm really worried
that you're losing your mind.

1521
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,168
The look in your
eyes right now...

1522
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,379
You haven't blinked
since we've started talking.

1523
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:33,880
Davie, Davie, Davie!

1524
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:35,173
What?

1525
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:38,177
I've never been in more control
in my entire life.

1526
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,984
Mike!

1527
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,920
Mike!

1528
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:45,824
This is really intense.

1529
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,087
Yeah, it's hitting
me really hard.

1530
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,027
This is good ecstasy.

1531
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,295
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
It's my first time.

1532
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:53,899
-Wait, what?
-What?

1533
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:56,300
Why would you take ecstasy
for the first time

1534
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,804
on the night before
your wedding?

1535
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:58,861
What?

1536
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,338
That is so baller!

1537
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,040
Like a tiny blonde gangsta!

1538
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,509
This little gangsta would kill
for a motherfucking ginger ale!

1539
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:07,739
Do you wanna go?

1540
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,316
Okay, let's go.

1541
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,215
Hello, everyone. Please
take your seats.

1542
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,484
Welcome to the
rehearsal dinner...

1543
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,916
for my man, Eric...

1544
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:18,356
and his bride-to-be,
the lovely Jeanie.

1545
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,360
They're two of the sweetest,
best people I ever met.

1546
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,760
All right. Our first
speaker tonight...

1547
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,662
is resident nasty girl...

1548
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:26,859
Cousin Terry.

1549
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,793
We can't let Terry crush.

1550
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,162
It's not fair!

1551
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:32,433
No. Give it to me.

1552
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,235
My eyes are dry.
Just give it to me.

1553
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,234
Do you guys know
who Chris Rock is?

1554
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,837
He's my neighbor, and he helped me out
with a little something I like to call...

1555
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,479
"mV Speech?

1556
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:44,177
Stop. You're wasting it.
You're wasting the poison.

1557
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,378
Mike, this is baby safe.

1558
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,422
They removed the active ingredient,
Tetrahydrozoline, like 20 years ago!

1559
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:49,717
<i>It worked on Wedding Crashers!</i>

1560
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,315
That was not real life!

1561
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,986
Now let's talk about
destination weddings!

1562
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,129
It's like a vacation...

1563
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,028
without the relaxation!

1564
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:00,894
That's true.

1565
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:01,958
Why aren't you on my side, Dave?

1566
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:03,426
What?

1567
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,904
I'm done with this shit, man.
I'm not doing our stupid speech.

1568
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,335
In fact, I'm quitting
our liquor business.

1569
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:09,501
There it is!

1570
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,802
-Really?
-Yeah.

1571
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,004
And what are you gonna do?

1572
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,511
I'm gonna draw!

1573
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:16,709
I'm gonna work on my graphic novel, and
Mom's gonna help me cover the rent.

1574
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:17,842
Boom!

1575
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,075
You traitor!

1576
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,176
I ain't gotta rehearse!

1577
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,519
I know how to eat dinner.

1578
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:26,716
Keith, can you turn
me up a little bit?

1579
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,118
<i>You turn your back an me...</i>

1580
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,628
<i>when everyone else does.</i>

1581
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:31,957
<i>Ba cks tabbing, treacherous...</i>

1582
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:33,861
lying coward!

1583
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,364
I don't think they
know they're on.

1584
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:36,835
What? Where is that coming from?

1585
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,433
I don't know what I did!

1586
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:39,870
<i>It doesn't matter, Mike.</i>

1587
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,340
You're losing your mind.

1588
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,476
You just tried to poison
our cousin Terry!

1589
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,074
Try a little harder. Am I right?

1590
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:47,307
You're goddamn right I did.

1591
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,408
Because I wanted her to shit hot
brown poop all over that stage.

1592
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:52,684
That is unacceptable.

1593
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,619
The mics are on, boys.

1594
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,590
<i>I wanted her butt to explode
like a rotten cantaloupe.</i>

1595
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:58,852
The mics are on!

1596
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:01,986
You're just fucking pissed off because
Tatiana finger diddled Terry.

1597
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:03,959
There it is!

1598
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:06,991
It was for tickets to Rihanna.

1599
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,034
You're sad, man. You are sad.

1600
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:12,031
I'm gonna kick your ass
just like when we were kids.

1601
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:17,873
My God!

1602
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,376
-Do you wanna go?
-Don't do it!

1603
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:22,677
These are coming your way.

1604
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:23,773
Just stop!

1605
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:26,580
God! That had to hurt.

1606
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,217
Don't do it again.

1607
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:33,187
<i>Why do you keep punching me?</i>

1608
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,660
<i>DAVE". Why do you
keep rushing at me?</i>

1609
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:35,989
Get him, Dave.

1610
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,223
Who said that?

1611
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,924
This wedding is going to hell!

1612
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,193
Yes.

1613
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,361
<i>They're out there,
smiling like fucking idiots.</i>

1614
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,098
And they don't
realize the bride...

1615
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,207
is getting off at
massage parlors...

1616
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:49,573
<i>like a goddamn
Vietnam War veteran.</i>

1617
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:53,670
I think they misunderstood what happened.
I think they just misunderstood.

1618
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,875
<i>I walked in and saw
little Jeanie...</i>

1619
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,747
<i>the bride-to-be, orgasming.</i>

1620
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,219
<i>The masseuse got her off.</i>

1621
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,653
God damn it!

1622
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,780
Jeanie!

1623
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:04,213
I hate you!

1624
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:20,103
The rehearsal dinner is over.

1625
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:23,800
Drinks by the pool, everybody.
Drinks by the pool.

1626
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,973
Everything feels so good, right?

1627
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,107
Yep.

1628
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,043
You know what
I've been thinking about a lot?

1629
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,179
Tell me.

1630
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,222
Eric is so sweet and sensitive.

1631
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,315
Kind, good, fiancé.

1632
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,916
Probably great husband
and stuff, but...

1633
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:42,825
Do you think Eric is boring?

1634
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:43,955
Boring?

1635
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,191
Like for my honeymoon...

1636
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,760
all I wanted to do
was go on a hot air balloon...

1637
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,598
to different countries
around the world.

1638
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,965
And just be
surrounded by wicker.

1639
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,529
We could have wicker
picnic baskets...

1640
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,133
and I could make picnic hats
out of wicker.

1641
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,367
We would be wearing
matching Chuck Taylors.

1642
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:00,277
And he vetoed it.

1643
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:03,081
Because he wants to go
to a resort, and just...

1644
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:06,744
-perch.
-What?

1645
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,913
I am a young woman...

1646
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,253
-Preach!
-There is so much for me to see.

1647
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,622
-Yes.
-I haven't even been to Burning Man.

1648
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,289
I don't even know what
Amsterdam is like.

1649
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,388
I haven't been to Seattle.

1650
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,794
You've never been to Seattle?

1651
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:19,889
No!

1652
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,333
-Seattle's gonna change your fucking life!
-Really?

1653
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:23,664
You need to get
out of this cage!

1654
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:24,796
I am in a cage...

1655
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,340
just like these
horses are caged.

1656
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,407
Just let them out.

1657
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:33,171
Let them all out.

1658
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:42,215
Be free! No one can
hold you down!

1659
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:45,418
Be free, my friends!
Follow your dreams!

1660
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,246
Here to pile on?

1661
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,609
Go ahead.

1662
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,017
Any insult you can think of...

1663
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,579
I've probably told myself
a million times.

1664
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,385
Why were you trying to
poison your cousin?

1665
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:25,828
I was jealous of the whole
steam room incident.

1666
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,698
That is some crazy shit. That's
like something I would do.

1667
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:30,562
This one time in high school...

1668
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:32,128
this bitch tried to hit
on my boyfriend...

1669
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,798
and I cut off her ponytail
while she was sleeping...

1670
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,341
and I wore it to
school for a month.

1671
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,535
What the fuck?

1672
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:38,135
But you tried to
poison your cousin.

1673
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:54,595
Look. I'm sorry I've been
so rough on you, okay?

1674
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:58,526
I honestly think it's
because you're so much like me.

1675
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,734
You act all confident...

1676
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,793
but, inside, you're
scared of everything.

1677
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:05,733
You act like you don't care
what people think...

1678
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,398
but you really care
what people think.

1679
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:08,736
And you try to act so smart...

1680
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:10,435
but sometimes...

1681
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:13,708
you're just afraid you're the
dumbest person in the world.

1682
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:18,076
I'm so dumb.

1683
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:22,044
I'm constantly saying words that
I don't know the meaning of.

1684
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,055
Like, I use this
word, "assuage"...

1685
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:26,691
all the time.

1686
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:28,928
Can you assuage me the ketchup?

1687
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,962
Can I assuage you
a few questions?

1688
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:33,963
-Is that the meaning of it?
-I don't know.

1689
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:35,535
But it's like, I'm so stupid...

1690
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,867
but I act all confident,
so people listen to me.

1691
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:38,996
And it's fucked up.

1692
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,105
Me, too. I'm a
natural born leader.

1693
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,105
Like George Washington.

1694
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:44,269
Yeah.

1695
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,573
Or another leader.

1696
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,553
All right, here's one.

1697
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,681
But I'm about to get super real
with you. Okay?

1698
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,788
I thought I was destined
for such great things...

1699
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:04,558
but I may never
achieve anything.

1700
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:09,330
Sister.

1701
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,604
Have you been reading my diary?

1702
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,705
Yes.

1703
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:24,776
Okay.

1704
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,560
You are beautiful!

1705
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,997
On to Seattle!

1706
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,259
Alice?

1707
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,292
Am I glowing?

1708
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,232
I can see sounds
and hear colors.

1709
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,065
Be free!

1710
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:48,833
What the fuck are the
horses doing out?

1711
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,176
Who the fuck are you guys?

1712
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,639
Fucking gypsies!

1713
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,940
Francisco! Francisco, run!

1714
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,283
Shit!

1715
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,179
Hey.

1716
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,813
Dave! Hi.

1717
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:05,789
What's up? What's up with you?

1718
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,124
-What's going on? Are you okay?
-Me?

1719
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,422
Yeah. I'm fine.

1720
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:13,632
Yeah. Well...

1721
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:15,964
Yeah. See, what
happened was that...

1722
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,469
there was a tsunami,
and it took away our clothes...

1723
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:19,767
but it brought these horses.

1724
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:20,829
What?

1725
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:23,137
And then, we wanted to get naked
because of Lady Godiva...

1726
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,973
but then horses can't
eat chocolate.

1727
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,114
They could have an aneurysm.

1728
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:28,475
Where's Jeanie?

1729
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,947
Hey, don't yell at her
just because she's the one...

1730
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,609
-that told me to go to Seattle.
-Holy shit!

1731
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:33,346
-I've always wanted to go!
-My God!

1732
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,218
That is not her fault.

1733
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:36,722
-My eyes!
-What's the matter?

1734
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:38,483
Stop yelling. Why are you
yelling? David, stop yelling.

1735
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,185
You're being loud.
And this a happy time.

1736
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:41,692
This a really good time.

1737
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,022
There's nothing wrong.
So who's at fault?

1738
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,463
Did you know that Hitler's
parents were second cousins?

1739
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,190
-Do you have any water?
-Put your clothes on!

1740
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,563
I'm a woman, Dave.
Deal with it.

1741
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:54,502
Because this is the bush
that you came out of.

1742
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:56,006
I didn't come from that bush.

1743
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,872
I came from Mom's bush.
And you know that.

1744
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,478
Jeanie! My God!

1745
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,345
You're completely naked!

1746
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,847
-Hi, Becky!
-God, your bush is huge.

1747
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,713
-You look tall.
-No, ma'am.

1748
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:08,286
I told you to stay away
from these bitches.

1749
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,683
Alice, seriously,
are you tripping?

1750
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:11,847
No. God, no.

1751
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:14,087
Why would say that? Just because
everything feels really soft?

1752
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:15,987
Please. Just tell me the truth.

1753
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:17,221
Are you on drugs?

1754
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:19,498
We're super fucked up. Yeah.

1755
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:20,690
What?

1756
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:23,168
We started with ecstasy, but then
I went into my mystery bags.

1757
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:24,702
Why the fuck would you do that?

1758
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,100
Don't you judge me, David.

1759
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:27,936
I don't think you're supposed to
go into the mystery bag...

1760
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:29,066
the night before the wedding.

1761
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:31,370
We brought you here because we
thought you were nice girls.

1762
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,376
But Mike was right
about you two.

1763
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,776
This whole wedding weekend
is just going to shit!

1764
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,747
Dave, I'll be honest with you.

1765
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,044
I need some clothes.

1766
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,554
I can't continue to
wear this horse.

1767
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,246
My God.

1768
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,087
The wind feels so nice.

1769
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,521
Come on, come on, come on.

1770
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,193
We should go in the ocean.

1771
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,391
I'm so thirsty! Dave,
we should get in the ocean.

1772
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:55,628
Please, please, please,
just be quiet.

1773
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,193
I love this song.

1774
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:58,602
There's no music playing.

1775
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:00,729
Baby, wait.

1776
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,807
Don't worry. Only
our butts touched.

1777
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:04,911
Stop it. Don't freak
out anymore, Pumpkin!

1778
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:07,104
Don't freak out?
Don't freak out?

1779
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:08,645
Tell me one thing.

1780
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,077
Did you enjoy it?

1781
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,243
No.

1782
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,619
That is such a "yes" no.

1783
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:15,746
No.

1784
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:18,223
I'm gonna ask you again.
Did you enjoy it?

1785
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,281
Yes!

1786
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,383
Well...

1787
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,219
Cat's out of the
frigging bag, isn't it?

1788
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,295
I went for a normal massage...

1789
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,490
but Alice, she had asked
for a little special treat.

1790
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,566
And then it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming, and...

1791
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,829
Who are these fucking girls your
brothers brought to this wedding?

1792
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,797
You are clearly on drugs.

1793
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,441
And we're getting
married tomorrow!

1794
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,108
I'm scared, Pumpkin.

1795
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,507
Aren't you scared?

1796
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,477
Well, yeah, now I am.

1797
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,312
It's just that...

1798
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:48,455
I'm just a little
worried that you are...

1799
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:50,979
boring.

1800
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:53,857
What are you saying?

1801
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,222
You don't want to marry me?

1802
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,368
Well...

1803
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:09,133
No, she doesn't mean that.
She's just confused...

1804
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:10,538
because she's just rolling
super hard right now.

1805
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:11,803
You rolled her!

1806
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,038
-You're the roller!
-I'm so sorry.

1807
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:16,614
I was gonna draw Rum for you.
But not anymore.

1808
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:18,752
Everything is not irie, man!

1809
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,782
You've made me so, so sad.

1810
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:27,725
But a little bit mad.

1811
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:29,894
But mostly just sad.

1812
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,163
-Dad!
-Don't!

1813
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:36,735
Mike, for once in your life...

1814
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:39,873
please don't say a fucking word.

1815
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,094
I hate them sometimes.

1816
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:07,528
Fucking love them
and they're dicks.

1817
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:09,330
Sometimes I love them,
sometimes I hate them.

1818
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,400
Everything okay over there?

1819
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,979
I can't find my other sock.
It's pissing me off.

1820
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:25,613
Did you take my sock, bro?

1821
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:26,844
No.

1822
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:29,720
I think you took my
fucking sock, bro.

1823
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:32,416
God damn it.

1824
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,652
I can't believe Jeanie and Eric
aren't getting married...

1825
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:36,592
and it's all our fault.

1826
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:40,233
It's slightly our fault.

1827
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,135
It's totally our fault. Fuck.

1828
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,635
We got selfish. We
got distracted.

1829
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:50,039
I don't think we were
#DoingltForJeanie at all.

1830
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,075
We weren't #DoingltForJeanie.

1831
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:55,078
Our fucking little sister.
Our little Jeanie Beanie Weanie.

1832
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:57,614
She is Stanglita.

1833
01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:00,549
The one little girl we used
to let into our Stang Hangs.

1834
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:01,710
The Stangle Dangle.

1835
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,313
The smallest plane
in the Stangar.

1836
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:04,616
Don't do it, dude.

1837
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,088
We're supposed to
be her protector.

1838
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:07,784
Don't you cry.

1839
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:08,950
We're supposed to
look out for her.

1840
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,289
Stop it.

1841
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:13,399
We're supposed to be the two dudes
that have her back no matter what.

1842
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,000
If you start, I'm gonna start.

1843
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:17,433
We broke up her marriage.

1844
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:23,141
Of course I'm fucking doing it,
man. We ruined Jeanie's wedding.

1845
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,743
I'm doing it, too.

1846
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,677
I hate it.

1847
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:41,987
Man, we fucked up this wedding.

1848
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,051
Yeah.

1849
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,391
We fucked it in the dick.

1850
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,395
You know I don't like it when
you say that. That's just...

1851
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:51,165
I know, but we fucked
it so hard. Fuck.

1852
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:54,433
I think the reason we get
ourselves into so much shit is...

1853
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:56,567
we're always telling each other
we're so awesome...

1854
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,836
when we're definitely
not being awesome.

1855
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,309
That's deep.

1856
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,279
Yeah, you know what?..

1857
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:06,716
I wanted you to feel better...

1858
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,048
and get your groove back...

1859
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:12,351
but not all the way
better to where...

1860
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,784
you wouldn't need me anymore.

1861
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,864
Because if you don't need me...

1862
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:23,029
then nobody needs me, and...

1863
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:26,969
Anyway, that's what I was thinking when
I was knuckles deep into Cousin Terry.

1864
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:29,575
Dude, we're always
gonna need each other.

1865
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,199
Okay.

1866
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:32,843
Okay, here's the thing.

1867
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,509
I don't wanna stop being us.

1868
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,741
But I think occasionally...

1869
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:42,150
we should think about
how we make other people feel.

1870
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,447
Like Jeanie?

1871
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:46,720
Yeah, like Jeanie.

1872
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:48,889
-Oof.
-Or like Eric.

1873
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:50,386
Fuck.

1874
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:52,190
This feels fucking terrible.

1875
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:54,561
This does not feel good.

1876
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:57,498
Like, Dave's so special and...

1877
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:00,604
He must be so mad at me.

1878
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,099
Poor Mike.

1879
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:05,609
He's less special,
but I played him so hard.

1880
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:07,212
They must be so mad at us!

1881
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:09,576
They must hate us. Fuck!
I would hate us.

1882
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:11,547
I would fucking hate us!

1883
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:14,050
I hate us, man. I hate us!

1884
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:15,347
I hate us, too!

1885
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,217
But you're the best, dude.
I love you.

1886
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,723
Don't lump yourself in with me.

1887
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:21,360
I'm like a little troll...

1888
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:24,292
who lives on nothing but
river water and squirrel meats.

1889
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,864
Your drawing? I could never
do anything like that.

1890
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,229
-So go. You go right now.
-What?

1891
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:30,361
Go!

1892
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:33,804
Don't let your loser older
brother hold you back.

1893
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:38,608
You are not a loser.

1894
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:40,936
Thanks, Dave.

1895
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:42,604
Dude, you introduced me
to the Ninja Turtles.

1896
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,614
Taught me Donatello was a pussy.

1897
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:46,650
That Raphael was
actually dope...

1898
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:48,788
because he didn't give a fuck
what people thought.

1899
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,218
He's cool, but rude.

1900
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:51,618
Exactly.

1901
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:53,818
When all those kids kicked at me
and they called me "Moist"...

1902
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:56,794
you stopped eating muffins
at the school lunch for a year.

1903
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:58,625
They were too moist.

1904
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:01,665
Made you an easy target.

1905
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:05,327
You're my brother.
And I love you.

1906
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:07,063
Heroes in a half shell.

1907
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:08,333
Turtle power.

1908
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,608
We're not going anywhere...

1909
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:19,445
until our little sister,
Jeanie Beanie Weanie...

1910
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:21,315
is getting married.

1911
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,255
You just killed the TV.

1912
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:30,524
I was aiming for it.

1913
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:35,798
We are such idiots.
We are so stupid.

1914
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,459
We ruined your whole wedding...

1915
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,333
and we finally just
realized that.

1916
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:41,474
All right. Please just
stop talking, okay?

1917
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,804
Not another word. My
head hurts so bad.

1918
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,172
Jeanie, Eric.

1919
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,042
We can't let you not get married just
because we fucked everything up.

1920
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:50,342
We love you so much, Jeanie.

1921
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,509
We love you, Eric. We just want
you guys to love each other.

1922
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:53,608
-Just love each other.
-That's it.

1923
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:56,951
Jeanie, Eric.

1924
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,614
We can't let you
not get married.

1925
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,384
Yeah. Just because
we fucked everything up?

1926
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:01,993
I mean, we want you guys
to love each other.

1927
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:03,151
Love each other.

1928
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,198
Okay. This is bizarre,
because we literally did that...

1929
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:08,732
exact same thing.

1930
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,528
We're even doing
this hand motion.

1931
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:11,864
Yeah, all that was ours.

1932
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:14,064
The point is,
this shit is all our fault.

1933
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:15,867
No, it's our fault.

1934
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:17,704
No, it's definitely our fault.

1935
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:18,970
It is our fault for sure.

1936
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:20,135
No, no, no. For real.

1937
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:21,747
If anything, it's my fault.

1938
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,075
Please stop.

1939
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:31,449
Everyone shut the fuck up!

1940
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,457
Jesus Hussein Christ.

1941
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,562
God damn it!

1942
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,961
Been trying to read
this same paragraph...

1943
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,495
for 20 minutes.

1944
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:45,095
But you four fucking morons
keep on fucking with my shit.

1945
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,432
We've only been here
for three minutes...

1946
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:48,701
so those other 17 minutes...

1947
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:49,969
-that's kind of on you...
-Mike!

1948
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,305
I'm using hyperbole.

1949
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:54,210
I don't know what that means, and
I think you know that I don't.

1950
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,338
Mike, do me a favor.
Shut the fuck up.

1951
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:57,405
Go Eric.

1952
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:58,542
Shut up too!

1953
01:22:58,606 --> 01:22:59,880
I mean, God damn it!

1954
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:03,181
You're all self-absorbed,
barely-functioning...

1955
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:04,985
codependent weirdos!

1956
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,455
-Yeah.
-I know.

1957
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:09,654
-That's pretty spot-on.
-We just figured that out.

1958
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,594
-Those are not good qualities.
-We're gonna work on it.

1959
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:14,656
-It's been a long time.
-It's been so many years.

1960
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,327
We're both very confused.

1961
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:18,529
No, no. You're not confused.

1962
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:20,765
You're just coming
down off MDMA.

1963
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,308
Sorry. Which I gave you.

1964
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:25,138
And Eric, you can't blame her for
anything she said last night.

1965
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,076
I've done so much
stupid shit on E.

1966
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:30,807
I got so dehydrated that
I was drinking puddle water...

1967
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:32,144
and I had to go to
the hospital...

1968
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:34,913
'cause puddles are really dirty.

1969
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,589
One time I was on peyote...

1970
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:38,920
and I signed up for
a T-Mobile plan.

1971
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,755
One time I got high.

1972
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:43,318
I read the back of a shampoo
bottle for 13 hours.

1973
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,524
Because it said "repeat."

1974
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:47,123
-Rinse and repeat.
-I get it.

1975
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:50,260
Jeanie, I know you think
that Eric can be boring...

1976
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:53,131
Enough of this talk of boring!

1977
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:54,731
Damn it!

1978
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:59,006
Sixty percent of my investments are
in some pretty aggressive stocks.

1979
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:02,513
I don't always look both ways
when I cross the street.

1980
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:05,674
I've been known to have
a second glass of wine...

1981
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,583
with my dinner,
every now and then.

1982
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:09,315
I once went to see a movie...

1983
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,880
walked across the hallway,
saw a second movie.

1984
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:13,254
Didn't pay till after.

1985
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:14,620
Is that boring?

1986
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:16,117
Is that boring?

1987
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:17,356
-What'd you say?
-Yeah.

1988
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:18,955
-You're right. We were wrong.
-That was pretty boring.

1989
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:20,627
Well, how about this for boring?

1990
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,231
Barrl!

1991
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:25,998
Two hot air balloon tickets
for our honeymoon.

1992
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,402
I know you really
wanted to go...

1993
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:31,342
so I got these tickets a
while ago to surprise you.

1994
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:33,542
Surprise.

1995
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:37,539
Baby, you're so
afraid of heights.

1996
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:40,619
-Baby, I'm fucking terrified of heights.
-Yeah.

1997
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,181
But my biggest fear...

1998
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:45,383
is to not be the husband
that you deserve.

1999
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:49,560
Baby, I'm sorry
I fucked so much of this up...

2000
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,389
but I promise that masseuse...

2001
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:53,455
He didn't touch my
lavender juice box.

2002
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,364
God, baby. I love you.

2003
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,665
And I know I want to marry you.

2004
01:24:57,992 --> 01:25:00,905
Today, if you'll still have me.

2005
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,842
Babe, of course. Are
you kidding me?

2006
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:08,303
Kiss her.

2007
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,212
Baby, I'm crazy about you.

2008
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:25,921
I want to marry you right now...

2009
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:28,033
but, baby, we already canceled
all the vendors.

2010
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:30,264
I don't think they're going to
let us get married here.

2011
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:32,896
Leave that to us.

2012
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,031
<i>(Fl BELIEVE III! A THING
CALLED LOVEPLAYING)</i>

2013
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:36,000
Leave that to all of us.

2014
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:38,470
-Yeah!
-Let's go, Mike.

2015
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,670
This way! Fuck!

2016
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:42,581
We'll actually just head around.

2017
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,316
-Girl.
-I'm good.

2018
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,085
So what part you like, brah?

2019
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,314
-We need the whole pig.
-I can't give you a whole pig.

2020
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:49,912
But we need to feed 100 people.

2021
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:53,222
Could we please, please
have the wedding here?

2022
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,318
For the last time,
we're out of venues.

2023
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,794
-Hold me back. Hold me back, please.
-What?

2024
01:25:58,052 --> 01:25:59,087
Give us a place!

2025
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,929
Everybody out of the way!

2026
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:02,795
It's hot. So hot!

2027
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,359
-Out of the fucking way!
-I want my pig back!

2028
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:06,935
What if I supplied
all the liquor...

2029
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,997
for every bar in this hotel...

2030
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:11,669
at wholesale prices
for the next three years?

2031
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,610
-Deal.
-Yes! Fuck yes!

2032
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:15,075
I'll get you guys a venue.

2033
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,051
Keith, get it together.

2034
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:31,557
We need to move, move, move.

2035
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:32,856
I'm doing my best.

2036
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:37,628
Hell yeah!

2037
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:56,578
And now...

2038
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:58,154
a reading...

2039
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,952
from the children's book
that I got in the lobby.

2040
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:02,887
"Aloha moon.

2041
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:04,957
"Aloha sea.

2042
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:06,496
"Aloha you.

2043
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:08,191
"Aloha me."

2044
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,059
-I do.
-I do.

2045
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:11,601
By the power vested in me...

2046
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:15,331
by the website
www.beyourowndeacon.com...

2047
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:19,507
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

2048
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:21,610
Those assholes kind of did it.

2049
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:23,080
Yeah.

2050
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,077
Those assholes kind of did.

2051
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,446
You may kiss the bride.

2052
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:28,043
Okay. Kiss the bride.

2053
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:29,247
Kiss the bride.

2054
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:37,585
<i>Yaw.!</i>

2055
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:51,636
-You designed this?
-Yeah.

2056
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:54,111
Insane. We're at a wedding,
it's in the shape of a heart.

2057
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:55,738
That was a really good idea.

2058
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,339
I have so many good ideas.

2059
01:27:57,605 --> 01:28:00,279
At my last job, I was
on fire with ideas.

2060
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,548
Actually, I need
a new partner...

2061
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:06,086
because Dave is bailing on me
to draw things.

2062
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:08,049
Would you wanna...

2063
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,728
maybe come work for me?

2064
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:11,052
Really?

2065
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:12,730
What do you know about liquor?

2066
01:28:13,187 --> 01:28:16,031
Only that it's delicious
and I love it.

2067
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:17,932
And those are
the two things you need to know.

2068
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:19,403
You are hired.

2069
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,269
Great. When do I start?

2070
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:22,702
You can start right away...

2071
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:25,610
but just know that there will be
some late nights.

2072
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,373
Keep it in your pants, okay?

2073
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,237
If we're going to work together,
let's just...

2074
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:31,207

2075
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:32,876
Okay.

You got my groove back.

Really?

2095
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:33,708

<i>Thank you, Jeanie.</i>

2108

<i>We never got to give our speech
at the rehearsal dinner.</i>

2109

2110
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,856
<i>But we just wanted

So sweet.

2136
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:51,675
Thought they were gonna blow it.
They did not.

2137
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:52,740

2176
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:03,514
I don't even know what's happening with
Khaleesi and her Dothraki boyfriend.

2177
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:06,415
Okay. Well he's dead,
and so is Jon Snow.

Jon Snow?

2179
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,585
Fuck that dude.
I'm taller than him anyways.

2180
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:11,189
Saw him.

2181
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:15,359
I just found out some spelunker
went dunkin' in your bunker.

2182
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:20,125
You are fresh as a fucking dick
in the morning.

2183
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:21,689
That's not that fresh.

2184
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:24,168
Have you ever sucked a dick
in the morning?

2185
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:26,833

I'm gonna throw up.
You look like meat!

Inner dialogue, inner dialogue.

2191
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:38,273
I once got lockjaw so bad

2192
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:40,012
that I was
sucking a homeless man's thumb.

2193
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:41,643
Dave actually had to
come get me from the hospital...

<i>because they iound 13 Pokemon

01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:49,492

to poop them out.

01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:51,755

That's okay. No, no.
Keep your dick in.

2201
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,672
For most of my life,
I thought goat cheese...

2202
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,769
was a slang term
for cheese that's gone bad.

2203
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:10,144
I'd see moldy cheese and I'd be,
like, "Dude, that cheese is goat."

2204
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:12,013
Like, "Get that goat cheese
off the counter."

2205
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,810
You look like a
deconstructed taco.

2206
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:15,910
Like carnival food.

2207
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:19,024
Like the waffle that the chef would
just go, "We're throwing that away."

2208
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:20,853
