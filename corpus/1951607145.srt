This is ourtarget.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
He's to be captured, not harmed.

3
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,800
Which man is it ?

4
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,700
We're after the canine.

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,400
His name is Khyi Yag Po.

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,700
Translation :"Dog ofAgeless Wonder."

7
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,100
Uh, sir, this picture's 80 years old.

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,500
Everybody in it is dead.

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,000
Not everyone.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,800
[monks chanting]

11
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,300

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,500
[whimpering]

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,500

[man]"Misguided youth. Your Honor..."

17
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
That sounds so pompous.
What's another word for misguided ?

18
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,000
Misguided... It's too on the money.

19
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,500
Um...

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Dog !

21
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,100
Hey, Baxter !

22
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Why is itthat myyard
is that mutt's outhouse ?

23
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,400
Uhh, FYl, calling Attila a mutt

24
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,000
is like referring to my Porsche Carrera

25
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,800
as a Buick Skylark.

26
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Hey, look, whatever kind of car
your dog is,

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,800
I'd appreciate it if he wasn't
whizzin'on my shrubs.

28
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,400
You know what your problem is,
Dave. You hate dogs.

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,900
No, I do not hate dogs. I dislike dogs.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,200
I hate that dog. Now get outta here !

31
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Stop that. You did not
hear that, did you ?

32
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,100
You did not hear that.

33
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,400
Are you OK ? Baby ?

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,500
Forrester got himself
in the newspaper.

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,400
- [chanting on TV] No more testing !
- And all over the TV.

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,600
[reporter] The trial
of Justin Forrester,

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,700
a local schoolteacher
accused of arson

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,300
- in a fire at Grant & Strictland.
- Great.

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,300
Yajust can't burn a building down,

40
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,100
because you think they're
puttin'makeup on bunnies.

41
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,200
You're going to Josh's
parent- teacher conference, right ?

42
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
- Josh !
- What ?

43
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,600
Josh's parent- teacher thing ?
Four o'clock ?

44
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
[woman] You said
you'd take care of it.

45
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,700
[sighs] Honey, l...
I'm starting a trial today.

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,500
Ken Hollister's stepping down.

47
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,200
Don'tyou want me to be the next DA ?

48
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,500
Dave, you never make these things.

49
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,100
All right. I'll take him.

50
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,900
Look, you know what ?
Let me say, once...

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Once I getthrough all this stuff,

52
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,700
why don't I take you to Oahu ?

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,700
You know that way that
you always say"Oahu,"

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,500
and you think it's so cute ?

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,000
It reallyjust reminds me of how many
times you've canceled that trip.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,900
- [boy] Hey, Dad.
- Hey, good mornin', Josh.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
- How's football goin'?
- Awesome. I'm playin'tailback.

58
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,600
Just like your old man.
Well, I can'twait.

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,800
When can I come down
and watch you play ?

60
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, um, you know,
the games don't startfor a while.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
- Really ?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
[Dave] Mornin'.

63
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,700
Hey, take the T- shirt off.

64
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Why ? Did you drop the charges ?

65
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,800
You know, this might be hard
for you to understand, sweetie,

66
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,400
but your social studies teacher,
the Torch, is a criminal.

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,900
What's hard to believe is that my father
is defending a puppy- murderer.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,500
Who'reyou gonna put in jail next ?
Grandma ?

69
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,900
Well, the way she cooks,
I should put her in jail.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Here's your... here's your buddy,

71
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,300
your hero, your social studies teacher.

72
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,900
This guy lit a lab on fire,
and he coulda killed a lot of people.

73
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,100
But he says he's innocent,
and I believe him.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,900
A criminal who thinks he's innocent.
What a concept.

75
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,600
- [car horn honks]
- That's Trey. Josh, you want a ride ?

76
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,600
In Trey's car ? Yeah.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Thanks. Here you go.

78
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

79
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,600
[chewing] Bye.

80
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,400
[Dave] Oh, nice shirt.

81
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,900
If I was puttin'your physics teacher
in jail, you'd be thrilled.

82
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
[door closes]

83
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,700
Justin Forrester is a passionate
advocate of animal rights.

84
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
And I respect that.

85
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,100
But this case
is not about animal rights.

86
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,900
This case is about
whether the defendant

87
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,700
criminally trespassed
on Grant & Strictland property

88
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
and set a fire

89
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,200
that caused over$300,000
worth of damage.

90
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,000
[Dave] He broke into a company
that's dedicated to good.

91
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,300
From their organic pet foods
and shampoos

92
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,500
to their life- saving medicines.

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,100
Created by them to help
people like you and me

94
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,400
fight heart disease, arthritis,

95
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,800
diabetes, obesity.

96
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,900
And yes, even baldness.

97
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,400
[Dave] We will, by the way,
subpoena that tape.

98
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm sorry, that's all the time I have.
Thankyou all very much.

99
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Dave. Here's your messages.

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,900
And I am holding 4 : OO open
foryour kid thing.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,700
OK, 4 : OO forthe kid thing.

102
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,300
Unless you want me
to go foryou.'Cause I will.

103
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,500
No, thanks. Thanks.

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,700
Dave. Hey. Great opening.
You really won over thatjury.

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,600
I learned everything from you, Ken.

106
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,900
- Dr. Kozak.
- Yes.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Glad to have ya. Sorry I couldn't
putyou on the stand today.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
All right. Apology accepted.
Ken tells me that when he steps down,

109
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,200
you're gonna be our next
district attorney.

110
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,200
- Well, that's my hope.
- Certainly.

111
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Well, hopefullyjustice
will be served.

112
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
You'll have my support as well
as that of Grant & Strictland.

113
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,100
- Till tomorrow ? OK.
- All right.

114
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,400
- Once again.
- We actuallyjust shook hands.

115
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,600
Yes, we did.

116
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Thank you.

117
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,800
Kozak. How did it go in courttoday ?

118
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,300
Ah, Mr. Strictland. Uh... [stammers]

119
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,500
It went very, very, very well, sir.

120
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,900
Have you unlocked the dog's secret ?

121
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,500
Let's talk in the elevator, OK ?

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I have something to show you
I think will be most pleasing.

123
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,900
Have you figured out
why the dog lives so long ?

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,600
Well, l... I take ityou're familiar
with the concept ofdog years, sir ?

125
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,900
- Don't like dogs.
- You don't like...

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,400
- I keep a squirrel.
- OK. A pet squirrel.

127
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,400
That's, uh, something.

128
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,200
Typically, dogs age seven years
for every human year.

129
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,400
But in the case ofthis one,

130
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,000
this one that we borrowed from Tibet,

131
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,600
a genetic mutation
reversed the equation.

132
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,200
What I'm saying is,

133
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,400
he lives seven years
for every human year.

134
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,700
Sir, this dog is over 300 years old.

135
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,200
[Strictland] Hmm.

136
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,600
The things you must have seen.

137
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,200
lfwe could transmit
that gene to humans,

138
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,600
we'd all live 700 years.

139
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,300
We've isolated
the gene fairly quickly.

140
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,900
But we're unable
to viralize it outside his body

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,700
for transmission to other species.

142
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,900
Therefore, we've had to viralize
his entire genetic code in corpus.

143
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,600
[Strictland] Which makes
his bodily fluids...

144
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,700
- [woman] Pretty dangerous stuff.
- [Kozak] Somewhat.

145
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,200
But itwould have to enter the
bloodstream to do any serious damage.

146
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
- [man] We're really careful.
- [Kozak] Mm- hm.

147
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
- [Strictland] How close are we ?
- [Kozak] How'bout the snake ?

148
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,300
[Kozak] Look at the snake,
see how the snake's doin'.

149
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,200
You might be interested to know, sir,

150
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
when we got this snake,
he was nearly dead.

151
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,100
He was nearly dead of old age.

152
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Since we injected him with the serum
made from the dog's viralized DNA,

153
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,800
all cell degradation has ceased.

154
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
And he's actually
been getting stronger.

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,500
Does that snake have a furry tail ?

156
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,500
Uh, that would be a- a- a side effect

157
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,700
that I would classify as, uh, minor.

158
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Kozak, dry mouth is a minor side effect.

159
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,400
Growing a dog's tail is... [stammers]

160
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
It makes your serum into a carnival act.

161
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,200
You knowwhat ? Yourjob is to relax.
Ourjob is to work outthe kinks, OK ?

162
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,400
Because when we do, Lance,

163
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,600
you and I are gonna have the patent
on the fountain ofyouth.

164
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,600
[cell phone rings]

165
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Ah. Excuse me.

166
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Uh, yeah, Security. Go for Kozak.

167
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,300
[all chanting] Grant & Strictland's
lying, so we're lying down !

168
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,200
Grant & Strictland's lying,
so we're lying down !

169
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,400
When I called you, itwas to make sure
these people were arrested.

170
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,100
I understand that.

171
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,300
lfwe arrestthem, they turn into
rebels with a cause on the 6 : OO news.

172
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,500
lfwe leave'em there, they're just
kids layin'on the sidewalk.

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,100
- [girl] Puppy- killers !
- ... so we're lying down !

174
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,500
Good advice. All right.
Thanks for your help.

175
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,900
- You bet.
- I'm good.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Let's go.

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,000
All right, fellas, let's just get
some sort of perimeter on this.

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,100
They're just kids.
Let'em do their thing.

179
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,600
When they get hungry,
they're all gonna go home.

180
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Hold on a minute.

181
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,200
Grant & Strictland's lying,
so we're lying down !

182
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,500
Grant & Strictland's lying,
so we're lying down !

183
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,200
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Carly.

184
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,400
What're you doing here ?

185
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm lying down forwhat I believe in.

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,300
Uh, good to see you, Mr. Douglas.

187
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,100
It's always good
to see you too, Trey.

188
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,300
We need to talk.

189
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,800
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

190
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,400
Um, Trey, make some room for Dad.

191
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
- Ow !
- Get up. C'mon. Jeez.

192
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,600
- OK, OK.
- No, no, no, no. NotOK.

193
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,100
We gotta get outta here.
We're leavin'right now.

194
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,400
As a member ofthe Animal Rescue
Group, there are principles...

195
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,600
You're a member ofthe 1 1th grade.

196
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,500
lfyou don't get out of here
right now, I'm gonna ground you.

197
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,800
Who's gonna enforce it ?
You ? You're never home.

198
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,000
You're never gonna leave home
unless you leave here right now.

199
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
[scoffs] Come on, Trey.

200
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,100
It was nice seeing you.

201
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
You too, Trey.

202
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,600
- [barks]
- OK.

203
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, this one still
freaks me out. A lot.

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,400
Can't make an omelet
without breakin'some eggs.

205
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,000
- That's a good point.
- Let's get a sample.

206
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,300
OK.

207
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,000
Such a good dog.

208
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,900
Never give us any trouble, do you ?

209
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,300
Nice.

210
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,300
Oh, myGod, it's a trap.

211
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,900
- [barking]
- Dogs don't set traps.

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,600
Yeah, well, dogs
don't live 300 years either.

213
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,800
- [growling]
- [woman] Get the cattle prod.

214
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,700
OK. That's what I'm doing,

215
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,400
backing up to get
the cattle prod. I have it.

216
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
- [electricity crackling]
- [barking]

217
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,100
[woman] Watch out.

218
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
That blood's viral.

219
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,600
Aah !

220
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,300
He treats me like a ten- year- old.

221
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,400
- What are you thinking ?
- We can prove Mr. Forrester's right.

222
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,900
- You wanna sneak in ?
- Justfollow me.

223
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
[snoring]

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,300
It's the middle ofthe day.

225
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,800
If anyone asks,
we're looking for a bathroom.

226
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
- [barks]
- [gasps]

227
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,500
[grunts]

228
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,300
- [Carly] I knew it.
- [barks]

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,400
Let's go.

230
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,900
[car engine starting]

231
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,800
We proved Mr. Forrester's right.
They are testing animals in there.

232
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,000
All right, so then,
what do we do now ?

233
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,700
We'll take him to the media
and showthem we've got this dog...

234
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,700
... who's got no tags or markings

235
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,700
that we can actually prove
came from Grant & Strictland.

236
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,900
Well, can we take him to your dad ?

237
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
Oh, yeah, sure.

238
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,100
And, uh, as deputy DA,
he'll arrest us for burglary.

239
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
[barks]

240
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,100
- We've searched the building.
- We're gonna keep looking.

241
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,700
- Really ?
- We're gonna...

242
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,100
Same places or new places ?
lfthe same places...

243
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
- I think new places.
- Oh, yeah ? Tell me you're a moron.

244
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,400
- Definitely.
- Larry.

245
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,900
- Yes ?
- Don't... don't speak.

246
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,200
Do you understand the great lengths
I went to to get this dog ? Yes ?

247
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,600
- Yes- or- no question.
- Well, you said not to speak...

248
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,200
And just'cause he holds
the key to my future...

249
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,000
... so it would stand to reason
that ifyou don'tfind him,

250
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,800
well, [chuckles]
you won't have a future.

251
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,700
Right.

252
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,500
Why are you still standing here ?

253
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,200
No sleeping. No talking. Find him.

254
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,800
[Dave] Hey, sorry I'm late, guys.

255
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,000
- Where's my dinner ?
- [all] In the microwave.

256
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Right.

257
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,600
So you guys see the trial
on the evening news ?

258
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,900
Great shot ofyour dad
on channel eight. [chuckles]

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,200
So how was the parent- teacher
conference today ?

260
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,800
[water running]

261
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,100
[sighs]

262
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

263
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,600
l... [sighs] Completely slipped my...

264
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,900
[whimpers]

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There's a dog in the kitchen.

266
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,700
No, no, no, no. It's a dog- free home.

267
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
[Carly] Dad, stop oppressing Shaggy !

268
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,100
- He's got a name now ?
- Yeah, itjust happened.

269
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,900
He's so cute, and he's very smart.

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,100
They're a breeding ground for fleas.

271
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,600
They don't contribute to the financial
well- being of a household.

272
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,100
And I'm not gonna get... Oh !

273
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
It was an accident. He's really sweet
once you get to know him.

274
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,000
- Are you all right ?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

275
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Carly, this is precisely why,
no matter what happens,

276
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,700
that animal's goin'back
to wherever he came from.

277
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,800
[dog whimpering]

278
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,500
Look at that. He's paper- trained.

279
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,400
All right, um, come here. Ow !

280
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
Oh ! Aah !

281
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,100
[echoing]

282
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
Ow !

283
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,400
- You scared him.
- Ow, he bit me.

284
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,600
- [mother] Let me see.
- [Dave grunts]

285
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,200
[Carly] Aww. He's licking it better.
What could be more sweet ?

286
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,300
So no hard feelings, right ?

287
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,800
- [pants]
- Thanks, guys.

288
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,000
[Josh] He licked you !
He tried to apologize !

289
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,000
You knowwhat ? A lick is not
considered an apology.

290
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,800
Well, if he doesn't have rabies,
can we take him back ?

291
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,000
[grunts]

292
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,700
- [sighs]
- Hey.

293
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,800
How's your hand ?

294
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,700
[slurring] Uh, fine, thanks.

295
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,000
- What ?
- Why are you talkin'like that ?

296
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,100
I don't... [stammers]

297
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,500
I don't know. Huh.

298
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,000
So Josh's teacher called me today
at work when you didn't show.

299
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,000
I am so sorry about that.

300
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
He's flunking math.

301
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,400
You're kidding.

302
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,000
Josh knows he can't play football
unless he passes math.

303
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'll... I'll...
Don'tworry, I'll... I'll...

304
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,600
I'll... I'll talkto him or somethin'.

305
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,100
She also asked ifthere
were any problems at home.

306
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,500
Yeah, that's good.

307
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,700
I told herthatwe'd
reverted to cannibalism

308
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,000
and that we were eating
our neighbors.

309
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,500
OK, great. I'd say the same thing.

310
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,500
What ?

311
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,400
What happened to my husband ?

312
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,800
Let's not exaggerate the situation.

313
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,100
Dave !

314
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,700
You were bitten tonight by a stray dog,
and the kids took the dog's side.

315
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,500
What does that tell you ? You don't know
what's going on with your children.

316
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,500
You don't know
what's going on with me.

317
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,900
When was the last time
you said,"l love you"?

318
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I love you.

319
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,100
That doesn't count.

320
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,100
Rebecca. Wait a minute. Rebecca, stop.

321
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,400
Stop for a second. Please, look.

322
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,600
That didn't come out right.
Turn around.

323
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,100
Look, sit down, sit down.

324
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,900
I gotan idea. I gotan idea.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,100
Tomorrow night
I'm gonna come home early,

326
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm gonna cook dinner for the kids,
spend some quality time with them.

327
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,600
You knowwhatthe next night is.

328
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,700
- Do you ?
- Yes. It's our anniversary.

329
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,700
So we make reservations at Grace,

330
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,600
get that table
by the window that we love.

331
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,600
I'll sing in French,
likeyou knowthat I can't do.

332
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,200
You have to do more
than justtalk a good game.

333
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,800
- You have to follow through, OK ?
- Yeah.

334
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
You have to connect
with the whole family again.

335
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,600
[whispering] I love you.

336
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,700
[grunting] Oh.

337
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,700
I gotta get this.

338
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,200
- Ahh.
- [grunting, sighs]

339
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,100

347
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400

Yeah, it's been a pretty tough year.

Do you knowwhat pruning is ?
Is that a lost art ?

406
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,800
It is snipping, not slashing.

Fortunately, though,
the sprinklers went off

to the rest ofthe building.

510
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
- [Dave] Hey !
- [ripping]

511
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,100
Uh- oh.

512
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

513
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,700
Why am I runnin'on all fours ?
Thankyou.

514
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,100
Man, am I flyin'!

515
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,000
Why'd I ever run on two ?

516
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,400
This is weird.

517
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,200
[stammers] What's hittin'me
in the face ? What is that ?

518
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,700
- It's my tongue.
- [tongue smacking]

519
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,600
I can taste my own eyeball.

520
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,800
- Aw, man.
- Hi there.

521
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,300
Hoping you can help us.

522
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,100
Um, our dog wandered off.

523
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

524
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,600
Back the truck up.

525
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Look at that.

526
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,600
That's that new 42- inch plasma.

527
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,200
What is that ?

528
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,600
Is that me ?

529
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,000
It's impossible. That can't be me.

530
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,000
[barks] I'm barking now ?

531
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,600
Did someone knock me out
and put me in a dog costume ?

532
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,700
Right.'Cause that happens
all the time.

533
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
I get it.

534
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,500
I'm, uh... I'm dreaming. Yeah.

535
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,500
In about five seconds,
I'll be naked in the courtroom.

536
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,800
[barks] I've gotta wake myself up.

537
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,800
Yeah. Wake myself up.

538
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,900
Oh !

539
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,400
[groans] That hurt.

540
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,600
So I'm not dreaming,
I'm not in a dog costume,

541
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,700
which can only mean one thing.
I'm a dog.

542
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,300
[barks] Weirder things have happened.

543
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,000
I am a dog ! [echoing]

544
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Perfectly understandable,
everybody. I'm a dog !

545
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,900
lamadog !

546
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,800
- [man] lsthis him ?
- [Larry] That is him. That is him.

547
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,600
You are a lifesaver. Thank you.

548
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,800
- [Gwen] Mm- hmm.
- Our kids have been crying all day.

549
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,700
- [both] Aww.
- Can we take him now ?

550
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,100
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Right now.

551
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,400
[Dave] Please be home,
please be home, please be home.

552
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,300
[barks] Hey, Tom, hey, Mary. Tom ? Mary ?

553
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Please be home, please be home,
please be home, please be home.

554
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,000
[panting] There we go. All right !

555
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,600
[barking]

556
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,700
What's going on ? I can't open this.

557
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,000
Come on, Dave,
grab and turn, grab and turn.

558
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,000
How do dogs do anything with these ?

559
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
[doorbell rings]

560
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,400
- [barks] Hi !
- Shaggy, you're back !

561
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,300
No, I'm... I'm not Shaggy. I'm Dad.

562
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,600
Carly, you gotta help me.
Must've been that dog bite.

563
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,300
When the dog bit me,
I turned into Shaggy.

564
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,600
- [laughs]
- Why is that funny ?

565
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Gosh, you're talkative, aren't you ?

566
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,400
Oh, that feels good. That feels good.

567
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,600
Oh, you're so cute.
I know. How ya doin'?

568
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,600
Oh, wow. That is so good.

569
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,000
But wait ! Wait, wait, wait !
This is important !

570
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,300
Hey, it's Shaggy !

571
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,200
- Where'd he come from ?
- I don't know.

572
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,700
No, no, no, no, no.

573
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,300
No, no. Listen to me.
Listen. I'm your dad.

574
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,500
[Josh chuckles]

575
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,900
Wow, he's really hyper today.

576
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,200
[through barks] I am your dad.

577
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,900
[Carly] Hey, do you need
to do your business ?

578
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,500
Business ? Did my daughterjust ask me
if I wanted to use the bathroom ?

579
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,500
Wait a minute. They can't hear me.

580
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,500
All they hear is barking.

581
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,100
I got an idea. Here. Over here.

582
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,800
Follow me.

583
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,400
Watch, you guys. Let's see. I... I am...

584
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,400
Shaggy, no ! Bad doggy !

585
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
lam Dad. I am Dad.

586
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,900
I need a"D."A"D"...

587
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,800
- Shaggy, stop.
- What are you doing ?

588
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,100
[Dave] Stop. What are you doing ?
Quit cleanin'up !

589
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,300
Sixteen years, not once have you
tried to clean up your room.

590
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,700
Butwhen Dad turns into a dog,
you're there cleanin'everything up.

591
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,000
- That's Janey. I gotta go.
- Where you goin'?

592
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,600
You won'ttell Mom and Dad ?

593
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,900
- Yeah.
- [Dave] Don't like the sound ofthis.

594
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,700
- I'm getting a tattoo.
- [Dave] What ?

595
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,200
Janey knows this place
where they don't ask for lD.

596
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,400
I'm gonna getthe Animal Rescue
Group logo tattooed across...

597
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,800
- I don'tthink so !
- Shaggy, where are you going ?

598
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,300
Hey, Carly, hurry up !

599
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Oh ! Who's the cute doggy ?

600
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,200
Who's the... ? [stammers] Whoa, boy.

601
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,900
[Janey] Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.

602
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,900
- [Dave growling]
- Whoa, boy ! Whoa !

603
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,300
[screaming]

604
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,700
- Shaggy, don't !
- [Dave] Janey ! Janey ! Listen to me !

605
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,800
How could you do this ?
You're a good girl !

606
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,100
You went to church camp !

607
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,500
[tires squealing]

608
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,200
Shaggy, what's gotten into you ?
Bad dog !

609
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't use that tone with me.

610
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,200
You're grounded, young lady.
You are grounded.

611
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,600
- He's kind offreaking me out a little.
- What ?

612
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,800
Maybe we should take him
back to the pound.

613
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,000
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'll be good.

614
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,600
Look, I'm good ! Look atthis.
Hey, look how good I am.

615
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,100
Look who's a good doggy.

616
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,100
- [laughs]
- This is humiliating.

617
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,500
He probablyjust needs
to run around a little.

618
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,000
I ran five miles to get here.
I don't need a run.

619
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,700
I'll take him to the dog park.

620
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,300
No, I have stuffto do, important stuff.
I'm not going to a dog park.

621
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
- [sniffing]
- [barking in distance]

622
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Is there anyone in this entire park
who has not sniffed my butt ?

623
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,300
No, no, no. Thanks, I don't wanna
sniffyour butt. Maybe later.

624
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,300
I just want some answers.

625
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,300
Has anybody here ever heard
ofa human being turning into a... ?

626
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,200
- [Josh] Hey, Shaggy, hey !
- What ?

627
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,700
- Wanna play with the Frisbee ?
- Josh, I am not playing Fris...

628
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,100
I got it !

629
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,800
- Yes ! I nailed it !
- Awesome !

630
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,900
- Josh.
- Oh, hey, Tracy. How's it goin'?

631
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,300
- Where were you today ?
- What do you mean ?

632
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,300
Auditions for Grease.

633
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,300
[Dave] That instinct is really intense.
It's like insane.

634
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,300
Hey, I got a dog. Pretty cool, huh ?

635
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,800
Here you go. Keep the Frisbee.
I'll be right back.

636
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
I gotta talkto those other... I got it !

637
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,200
Nothin'but mouth !

638
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,700
I'm not doin'the musical this fall.

639
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,900
- What ?
- l, you know, just don't wanna.

640
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,600
[mock laughs] Funny. You're cute.

641
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Be at the theater tomorrow, 3 : O0.

642
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,700
And, uh, don't get too cocky.

643
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Just'cause you're the best

644
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
doesn't mean you're
gonna get the part.

645
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,200
- Ow.
- [woman] Come on, kids !

646
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,500
Did you see that catch ?
Thatwas great. Way up in the air...

647
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
- Hey, what's the matter ?
- [Josh sighs]

648
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,400
[barks, whimpers]

649
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,400
You were a very bad dog.

650
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Are you gonna be a good boy ?

651
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,100
You get the cattle prod,
I'll get the needle.

652
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
OK.

653
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,300
[barking]

654
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,900
[door opens]

655
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
When was Dad supposed to be home ?

656
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,400
- [door closes]
-'Bout an hour ago.

657
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,400
Hey, honey.

658
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,700
Remember that
"in sickness and health"thing ?

659
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,100
[Josh] What's for dinner ?

660
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,500
Well, your father
was supposed to be cooking.

661
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,700
At least he said he was, last time
he returned one of my phone calls.

662
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,000
[Dave] Oh, boy,
that's the mad face.

663
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,400
You smell mad. Are you in heat ?

664
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,300
[Carly] Did you check your e- mail ?

665
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,700
The computer. That's it. That's it !

666
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,600
- [chuckles] All right.
- Shaggy !

667
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,400
Where are you going ?

668
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,500
- [Dave] OK, um, I can't make dinner...
- [Carly] Shaggy, stop causing trouble.

669
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,600
What's a shorter word
for metamorphosis ?

670
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,800
All right. Look, I can't make dinner...

671
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,500
I can't make dinner because
I turned into a d... Don't shutthat !

672
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Hey, watch this.

673
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
Who does this remind you of ?

674
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Wow. Maybe he escaped
from the circus.

675
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,300
- [chuckles]
- C'mon, kids.

676
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,200
Tryto see pastthe fur and the tail,
the snout and the drool.

677
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,600
[chuckles] How cute.

678
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,800
Honey, you recognize me. Honey ?

679
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,000
Do you thinkyour dad
is gonna come through,

680
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,400
- orshould we go ahead and order in ?
- [in unison] Let's order in.

681
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,700
Ouch.

682
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Well, I would letyou
sleep inside, Shaggy.

683
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,800
But my husband won't allow it.

684
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,700
Now, there's a bitter irony.

685
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,100
Good night.

686
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,100
Wait. Wait. Honey ? [barking]

687
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,100
I'm sorry about tonight.

688
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,300
I love you. [growls]

689
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,200
Sweet dreams.

690
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
Really do love you.

691
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,200
[heartbeat thumping]

692
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
[floor creaking]

693
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,000
- It's 3am.
- [clears throat]

694
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,700
Where have you been ?
What happened to your clothes ?

695
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,100
Clearly you're upset,
and I would be upset too. But there's...

696
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,400
There's a simple but hard- to- swallow
explanation for all this.

697
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,500
[sighs] I turned into a dog.

698
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,700
[chuckles]

699
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,700
Lori, I wanna thank you

700
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,800
for picking up my car
atthe animal shelter.

701
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,300
I figured you were
getting it fixed. [chuckles]

702
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,300
- Ooh.
- Um, no thanks necessary.

703
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,700
Anything else
I can do foryou this morning ?

704
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,000
- Actually, I need some research done.
- Oh, OK. Great. On what ?

705
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,700
On dogs and man.
Man and dog... [stammers]

706
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,400
Have you ever heard
ofa man turning into a dog ?

707
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,100
They all do eventually, don't they ?
[laughing]

708
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,000
You've been drinking, haven't you ?

709
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,900
Dog- men. I'm on it.
Um, doyou mind ifl askwhy ?

710
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,700
- ltwould be better ifyou didn't.
- Right, OK.

711
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,500
I'll be honest,
the reports ofyour behavior

712
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,500
in court yesterday were unsettling.

713
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,600
As was your disappearing
the rest ofthe day.

714
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,300
Yeah, I know. And I'm...
I'm sorry aboutthat.

715
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,100
I had some kind offood poisoning.

716
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,700
- I was mildly delirious.
- [elevator bell dings]

717
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,700
- You goin'down ?
- Yeah.

718
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,500
- [sighs]
- Hold it.

719
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
[growls]

720
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,700
Should've taken the stairs.

721
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,700
- But you're fine now.
- Huh ? Yeah, yeah.

722
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,600
I'm great now, thanks, Ken.

723
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
- [dog whimpers]
- [Ken] Good.

724
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,000
Because people don't
want a loose cannon

725
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,000
workin'the DA's office.

726
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,200
- Jeez.
- [dog whimpering]

727
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,100

- [gasps]

728
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,800
You ain't got anything illegal
up there, do you ?

729
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,900
[laughing]

730
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,700
[growling]

731
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,600
Bythe way, Lloyd Gannon called today

732
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,800
about working on some
preliminary campaign ideas.

733
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,900
Sit.

734
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,200
He wants to go grassroots to start.

735
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,900
Mailers, some door hangers,

736
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,100
- work up to television and radio.
- Mm- hmm.

737
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,800
[whimpering, growling]

738
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,600
[clears throat]

739
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,100
- You OK ?
- Yeah, yeah.

740
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,500
Yeah. [sighs]

741
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,200
[panting]

742
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,200

[elevator bell dings]

745
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,400
You sure you're OK
to go into court today ?

746
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,200
Yeah. Uh- huh.

747
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,600

748
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,800
[gurgles] Oh.

749
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,100
There were these little bunnies.

750
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,900
There... there were poor
little fluffy bunnies

751
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,900
all crammed together in a cage.

752
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,300
[Dave] You thought it was
a good idea to set a fire

753
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,300
where there was bunnies present ?

754
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,500
- Objection.
- [judge] Overruled.

755
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,300
Look, I didn't set the fire,
and I sawwhat I saw.

756
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,000
We can't see what you saw ?

757
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Do we need special goggles ?
Is this like a Bigfoot affair ?

758
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,400
Objection ! He's badgering the witness !

759
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,400
- Your Honor !
- I saw a monkeywho acted like a dog !

760
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,100
[courtroom laughing]

761
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,400
[judge] Counselors, approach the bench.

762
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,400
[Dave sniffs]

763
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,400
[judge] Get over here !

764
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:06,100
Don't you dare turn
my courtroom into a barnyard.

765
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,100
Getyour chin off my desk.

766
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,600
- [whimpers]
- Go on. Go on.

767
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,600
I assume you're going somewhere
with this line of questioning ?

768
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,000
I'd like a treat first.

769
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Yes, yes, I was. Thank you.

770
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,100
- [judge] Proceed, counsel.
- [Dave] Thank you, Your Honor.

771
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,200
How did this monkey act like a dog ?

772
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,600
ltwas growling and chasing its tail.

773
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,700
[laughter]

774
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,600
[Dave] Was there anything else
that was genetically odd ?

775
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,800
There was a snake
with a tail like a dog.

776
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,000
- [laughter]
- [gavel pounds]

777
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,500
And rats. Rats that barked.

778
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,400
- [judge pounds gavel]
- [Forrester] It's true !

779
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,800
Look, it's true !

780
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,400
I'm... I'm not lying ! I'm not crazy !

781
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,000
[judge] Order ! Order !

782
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,900
This dog that you saw,
what did it look like ?

783
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,500
ltwas a big, woolly sheepdog.

784
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,800
- No further questions, Your Honor.
- Thank God.

785
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,200
- [judge] Court adjourned.
- [pounds gavel]

[bell ringing]

787
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,400
Josh was one
of my best math students,

788
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,200
and then, all of a sudden... [whistles]

789
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,800
Bad grades.

790
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,500
And so we're just trying
to search out an explanation, really.

791
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,500
Well, I thinkthe problem
is he's distracted by football.

792
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,200
Can l... ? I think I knowwhatthe
problem... The problem, I think, is me.

793
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,900
I've been workin'too much.
This is whatthis is about.

794
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,400
I haven't been home. It's...

795
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,000
It's been causing a lot
of stress on my family.

796
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,300
[teacher] Well, I know what it's like
to be too busy to do anything.

797
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,500
In fact, I didn't even get to eat lunch.

798
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
- Do you mind if I eat something ?
- [chuckles] Sure.

799
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,000
- [Dave] Go ahead.
- Thanks.

800
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,400
I realized this in court, actually.

801
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,400
Uh, last couple days the...
the amountthat I was in...

802
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
[sniffing]

803
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,500
Can you smell that ?
It is so smelly in a greatway.

804
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,500

806
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,100
Look at that. Ah, yeah.

807
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,800
- [teacher] Do you want half ?
- Hmm ?

808
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,100
C'mon, please ?

809
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,000
Uh, no. Well, no, wait, no.

810
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,600
No, we're here to talk about Josh.

811
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,000
Boy. Anyway,

812
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,600
I'm gonna commit myselfto this.

813
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,800
There's nothing more
important than Josh.

814
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,700
Nothing more important to me... Nothing
more importantto me than family.

00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,700
- [smacks lips]
- [teacher] That's true.

816
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,500
Oh, that's great.
I love hearing that. [chuckles]

817
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,700
- As a teacher, I love to hear...
- [hisses]

00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,200
Gotcha.

848
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,300
This isjust not myweek.

849
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,700
[whimpers]

850
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,700
I thinkwe've got it.

851
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,800
This rabbit was injected
with the serum two days ago.

852
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,900
[Kozak] Uh- huh.

853
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,200
So far cell degeneration
has ceased with no side effects.

854
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,200
- You're sure ?
- I'm sure.

855
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,300
Are you absolutely, entirely certain ?

856
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,700
Absolutely.

857
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,100
- I've done it.
- Um, we've done it.

858
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,000
I've done it ! [laughs]
I'm gonna call Strictland.

859
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,000
I bet he's gonna want an injection
ofthis stuff right away.

860
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,700
Can we do that ? Isn't there an FDA ?

861
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,900
The man's got one lung and
someone else's kidney. He'll risk it.

862
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,900
Gwen, I want you to manufacture
as much serum as you can.

863
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,900
Don't worry about the FDA.
It's nothing money can't handle.

864
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,200
[laughing]

865
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,400
[dogs barking]

866
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,100
- That's him.
- [Dave] Kids ! Am I glad to see you.

867
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,000
This mastiffjust sold me
for three biscuits.

868
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,800
Where you been ? We've been
lookin'all over for you, boy.

869
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,600
I've been waitin'for you guys
to come get me outta here.

870
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,400
[Josh] Let's go.
I got a football game to go to.

871
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,700
[Dave] There's a game today ? Wow !

872
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,800
l... I getto watch you play.
That'll be great.

873
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,800

874
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
[crowd cheering]

875
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,600
- Get him !
- C'mon.

876
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,000
- Hithim ! Hithim !
- [referee blows whistle]

877
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,000
[man] That's the way to hit somebody,
Jenkins. Way to go.

878
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,500
[Dave barking]

879
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,600
[Dave] Hey, coach,
would ya put my kid in ?

880
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,900
We waited all game for this.

881
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,700
Douglas !

882
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,000
You're in at tailback.

883
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,800
[players laughing]

884
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,800
It's OK, coach.
You don't have to play me.

885
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,300
- [Dave] What ?
- Everybody plays, Douglas. Come on.

886
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,500
Butwith the game
on the line and all...

887
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,300
We're up by 30. Now let's go.

888
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,300
- [woman] C'mon, buddy !
- All right.

889
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,300
[Dave] Get in. Come on.
Come on, buddy. Get in there. C'mon.

890
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,500
[grunts] Oh ! Sorry, coach.

891
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,100
That's what I gotta deal with.

892
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,700
[Dave] Show'em what you can do.

893
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,200
The otherteam's afraid. I can smell it !

894
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,800
And a hot dog. And a poodle.

895
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,400
[boy 1] I run. Twenty- four dive, I run.

896
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,300
- Ready ? Break !
- Break !

897
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,000
- [boy 2] All right !
- Where... ? I go... ?

898
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,200
What the... ?

899
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,200
[coach] Douglas ! Tailback !

900
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,200
Tail... ! Behind the fullback !

901
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,900
Back up ! Back up ! Back up !

902
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,700
Back ! Back, back, back,
back, back ! Right there !

903
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,100
- Stay right there !
- [quarterback calls play]

904
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,100
Set ! Hut !

905
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,500
- [boys] Block him !
- Here it comes !

906
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,500
[coach] You gotthe ball ! Run ! Run !

907
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,200
Whoa !

908
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,400
- [grunts]
- [crowd groans]

909
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,600
- Ooh !
- Ow !

910
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,100
- [blowing whistle]
- [Dave] Man ! That's gotta hurt.

911
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,200
- [sighs]
- [coach] Hustle !

912
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,800
[Dave] Attaboy, Josh.
Come on ! Shake it off.

913
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,200
Pain isjustfear
leavin'your body, buddy.

914
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,300
You completely suck, Douglas.

915
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,400
Why do you even show up ?
Everybody thinks you're a loser.

916
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,700
[barks, growls]

917
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,500
Thanks, pal.

918
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,300
Wish I could buyyou an ice cream.

919
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,600
But I've got paws
and, uh, don't have a wallet,

920
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,300
because I'm actually nude right now.

921
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,400
[Tracy] Football ?
That's why you're not trying out ?

922
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,300
[chuckles] You hate football !

923
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,200
[Josh] Shh ! I know, but my dad loves it.

924
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,200
You should hear him."Ah, you're
gonna bejust like your old man."

925
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,900
If I told him I wanted
to do a musical instead,

926
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,100
he'd, like, write me off as a son.

927
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,700
[Dave] Aw, Josh.

928
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,100
Josh, is yourfather a stupid man ?

929
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,100
No. But he is clueless,

930
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,700
- which, in some ways, is better.
- [Dave] Oh, boy.

931
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,400
See, he told me I could only
play ifl keep my grades up.

932
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,700
So I started flunking math.
But he only let me offwith a warning.

933
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,000
So now I gotta flunk English

934
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,300
and maybe history and home ec,

935
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,900
which is actually really hard to fail.

936
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,500
[Dave] Aww, no, Josh.

937
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,500
So you'd rather wreck your future
than tell your dad you hate football ?

938
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,200
I can get my grades back up,
as long as he makes me quit in time.

939
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,100
[scoffs] Wow.

940
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,500
Men are so complicated.

941
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,600
- Come on.
- [Dave] How did I letthis happen ?

942
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,600
[stammers] What kind of a father am I ?

943
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,000
[Carly] So ? What do you think
ofthe new pamphlet ?

944
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,600
[Trey] It's infuriating.

945
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,900
No, but in a good way.

946
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,300
Makes me wanna get out there
and do something about animal testing.

947
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,000
The response I was hoping for.

948
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what're you
doin'in my daughter's bedroom ?

949
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
- You rock.
- [chuckles]

950
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,300
Don't even think about it, Trey.

951
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,400
Shaggy, stop.

952
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,900
What's that ?

953
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,300
That's really well- done.

954
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,600
Admit it, this
is more effective than a tattoo.

955
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,500
One thing I learned from Mr. Forrester

956
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,000
is thatjust because
something seems ridiculous

957
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,500
doesn't mean that it's wrong.

958
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,300
ltjust takes more courage
to stand up for it.

959
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,800
[Dave] Wow,
you really believe all of this.

960
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,800
I am so proud ofyou.

961
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,800
[giggles] Shaggy, stop.

962
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,200
All right. Down, boy.

963
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,700
[Dave] Hey, easy on the hands, bud.

964
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,000
I mean, just imagine
whatwould have happened

965
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,000
ifwe hadn't stolen Shaggy
from Grant & Strictland.

966
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,400
[Dave] You what ? Stolen ?!

967
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,900
You stole a dog from Grant & Strictland,
and you lied about it.

968
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,900
Shaggy. Shaggy, c'mon. C'mon.
Go fetch, boy. C'mon, boy.

969
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,500
I am notyour boy, and I'm not
gonna go... Hey, I'll be right back.

970
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,500
[groans] I've got to stop doing that.

971
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,400

They're multiplyin'

973
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,500
[Dave] Keep goin'.

974
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,700
What ? Why're you
lookin'at me like that ?

975
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,700
[Dave] Hey,
you're pretty darned good at this.

976
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,300
Hey, let's order some pizza.

977
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,200
Mom and Dad are out to dinner.

978
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,200
[Dave] Dinner. Oh, no.

979
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,100
I forgot about our anniversary !

980
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,700
[woman clears throat]

981
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,900
You should have brought a book.
The single woman's best friend.

982
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,500
Oh. [laughs] I'm not single.

983
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,900
Oh.

984
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,200
Yet. [sighs]

I'm late, I'm late, I'm so late.
I am so late.

987
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,100
I'm also a dog.

988
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,800

Shaggy ?

[Dave] And I am so sorry, honey.

It's me.

995
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,500
I cannot believe that you stood me up
for our anniversary dinner.

996
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,600
[sobbing] And then you send
the dog with roses in his mouth ?

997
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,300
Are you trying to push me away ?

998
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,900
[sighs] We need to talk, but...

999
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,200
I don't know how we're
gonna get past this one.

1000
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,200
[Dave] What ?

1001
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,500
Goodbye.

1002
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,700
Honey, no. Please don't cry.

1003
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,600
It didn't used to be like this, Shaggy.

1004
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,600
He used to be here for everything.

1005
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,600
And if he couldn't be,
then he would call,

1006
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,100
or he would send a note
orflowers, or he'd...

1007
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,000
Sometimes he would write these...

1008
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
These funny little rhymes. [sniffs]

1009
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,200

Don't you cry too.

Aww. Is this how it ends ? [sniffs]

1013
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,700
With him God- knows- where
and me hugging the dog ?

1014
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,700
[Dave] I'm gonna figure out what
happened to me, and I'm gonna fix it.

1015
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,700
And I'm gonna
be a better man. I promise.

1016
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,700
- [crying] Oh.
- I love you.

1017
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,900
[growling] I love you.

1018
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,900
Don't pee in the car, OK ?
We're almost home.

1019
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,800
[whimpering]

1020
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,800
Hey, thanks, honey.

1021
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,800
Oh, boy.

1022
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,700
- This isjust notworkin'.
- [thunder rumbling]

1023
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,400
I'm not a bad dog.

1024
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,000
But I'm a terrible man.

1025
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,500
I've got to make this better.

1026
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,100
- [heartbeat accelerates]
- [dog barks echoing]

1027
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
[thunder rumbles]

1028
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,600
[door opens]

1029
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,100
Hey, Ken, thanks for s...

1030
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,300
Hey, hey, Dave.
It's three in the morning,

1031
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,900
and you want a warrant
to search Grant & Strictland.

1032
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,500
- Right.
- They're the victims.

1033
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,600
Listen, listen.
You gotta trust me on this.

1034
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,000
Kozak is hidin'somethin'.
Forrester was framed for that arson.

1035
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,700
If Forrester was framed,
why'd he throw in the towel ?

1036
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,400
What... ? What're you talking about ?

1037
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,800
Forrester pleaded out.

1038
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,300
Well, why didn't somebody tell me that ?

1039
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,300
-'Cause you're off the case.
- You can't do this.

1040
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,900
Thejury convenes atten to hear
Forrester's plea. I'll handle it.

1041
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,000
And I wantyou to either
get your head screwed on straight

1042
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,100
orfind anotherjob. Is that clear ?

1043
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,200
Abundantly clear.
However, the point I had to...

1044
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,700
[sniffing]

1045
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,100
[sniffing]

1046
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,900
[whimpers]

1047
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,700
[barking]

1048
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,800
[screeching]

1049
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,000
[all barking]

1050
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,700
- What's gotten into them ?
- I don't know.

1051
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,100
Eh, boy.

1052
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,200
Can't...

1053
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
That's not gonna work.

1054
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,100
I'm too big.

1055
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,700
Hey, you. Hold on a second.
Do me a favor.

1056
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,100
All right ? Here.

1057
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,900
All right. Throw the stick, over there.

1058
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,500
Why would I throw the stick ?

1059
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,200
Just throw the stick, please.

1060
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,000
Why would I throw the stick ?

1061
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,400
Because I'll give you
$5 to throw the stick.

1062
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,700
Oh, I look like a guy
who needs 5 bucks.

1063
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,500
Gimme the money.

1064
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,900
- Speed or distance ?
- Uh, distance.

1065
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,300
[panting] It's so close. It's close.

1066
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,800
This time, throw it

1067
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,600
and... and yell,"Fetch !"

1068
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,100
Don't make me bite ya.

1069
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,100
Fetch !

1070
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,100
Wow. I can't believe that worked.
Thanks !

1071
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,500
Whoa.

1072
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,900
[grunts] Drop the stick.

1073
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,400
All right. Perfect. Nice fit.

1074
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,300
[sniffs] That's it, follow your nose.

1075
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,900
Wait a minute. [sniffs]
What's that smell ?

1076
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,100
What is it ? Oh, it's me.

1077
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,100
[sighs]

1078
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,700
The transistor.

1079
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,400
The microchip. The artificial heart.

1080
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,100
All footnotes compared to this.

1081
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,400
[coughing]

1082
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,400
[coughing]

1083
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,600
[Dave] Bingo.

1084
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,200
[coughs, wheezes]

1085
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,600
- What's happening ?
- He's going into shock.

1086
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,400
It's the serum. It doesn't work.

1087
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,400
- What do we do ?
- Ofcourse itworks.

1088
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,100
ljustdidn'tgive itto him.

1089
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,900
- What have you done to him ?
- [Kozak] Lance ? Lance ?

1090
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,900
I'm so sorry that
I had to do this to you,

1091
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,900
but I just couldn't letyou
take all the credit again.

1092
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,900
And plus, you're a pig, and I hate you.

1093
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,300
I hate you in so many ways.

1094
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,900
Can you hold this for a second ?

1095
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,500
Get rid of it, accomplice.

1096
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,100
[gasps] Ah.

1097
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,000
But is he... dead ?

1098
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,300
No, he's not dead. He's fully conscious,
but he's unable to speak.

1099
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,100
Doctors will think it's dementia.

1100
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,900
[Kozak] The drug itself
will wear off in a few months.

1101
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,200
But bythen I'll be CE0,

1102
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,000
and I will be fabulously,

1103
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,200
insanely, unimaginably wealthy.

1104
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,300
- This was not part ofthe plan.
- This is totallywrong.

1105
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,700
Of course, I'll cut both
ofyou in on his share.

1106
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,300
- I'm cool with that.
- It's fine by me.

1107
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,400
Good. Uh, Larry,

1108
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,400
why don'tyou wheel him up
to his office, park him at his desk.

1109
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,300
Or, uh, should I say, my desk ?

1110
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:09,100
[Dave] Oh, boy. Gotta get outta here.
Go, go, go, go, go !

1111
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,400
- What was that ?
- What was that ?

1112
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,700
[Dave] I knew Kozak was up to something.

1113
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,100
Carly was right about everything.

1114
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,100
Forrester was framed.

1115
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,600
[barks] Uh- oh.

1116
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,500
Looks like I'm walkin'.

1117
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,900
- [Gwen] Wow.
- [Larry] That's somethin'.

1118
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:38,300
That's... Wow. Do you realize
the significance ofthat ?

1119
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,500
Wow. You think ?

1120
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
Yeah, I think it's mildly significant.

1121
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,200
Unfortunately, it's on tape.

1122
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,600
So we... [stammers]

1123
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,600
[sighs] I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

1124
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,100
You two are going
to pay Mr. Douglas a visit.

1125
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,800
[sighs]

1126
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,600
Oh, myGod. Oh, myGod.

1127
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,600
No, not my babies. Not my darlings.

1128
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,200
Oh, evil.

1129
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,900
These hooligans ! [grunts]

1130
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,700
Where's Trey ?
We're gonna be late for school.

1131
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,700
Shoulda gotten a ride from Mom.

1132
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,900
What's the matter ?

1133
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,900
[sobs] Do you realize what's happening ?

1134
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,600
Mom and Dad are splitting up.

1135
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,300
How do you know ?

1136
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,700
[scoffs] Josh, it's obvious.

1137
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,000
[doorbell rings]

1138
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,100
- [barks]
- Shaggy.

1139
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,200
[Dave] I witnessed an attempted murder.
You were right about everything.

1140
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,500
An innocent man is about ready
to go tojail. I gotta take a nap.

1141
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,100
Don't wake me unless I'm human.

1142
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,100
I mean, did you see that note he left ?

1143
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,800
"I'll explain everything"?

1144
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,800
We're gonna get the talk.

1145
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:20,900
What talk ?

1146
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,700
The"Mom and Dad
are having problems"talk.

1147
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,300
Then Dad'll leave.

1148
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,200
[scoffs] They'll say it's
temporary, but it won't be.

1149
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,800
Are you sure you're not
just drama- queening ?

1150
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,800
Josh, he didn't even
come home last night.

1151
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,500
But ifyou ask me,

1152
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,700
he stopped caring
a long time before that.

1153
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,200
[Dave] No, no, no, no.
No, that's not it.

1154
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,900
No, no, no.

1155
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,900
[Carly] Shaggy.

1156
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,800
Shaggy, would you stop
making such a... ?

1157
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,500
That's impossible.

1158
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,200
[Dave] Finally.

1159
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,100
How ?

1160
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,900
- [Josh] Grant & Strictland ?
- Yes.

1161
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,500
Mr. Forrester said they were
making mutant animals,

1162
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,600
and... and that's
where I found Shaggy.

1163
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,300
And Shaggy bit Dad.

1164
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,100
- [whimpers]
- [gasps] Oh, Daddy !

1165
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,800
[Dave] It's OK, kiddo. It's OK.

1166
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,100
[crying] I'm so sorry.
This is all myfault.

1167
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,700
Can you please forgive me ?

1168
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,800
There's nothin'to forgive.

1169
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,200
[crying]

1170
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
I'm gonna go call Mom.

1171
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,900
So you saw the game yesterday ?

1172
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,300
Yeah.

1173
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,700
I didn't want to let you down,
but I'm just no good.

1174
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,900
No, no, no, no, no, no. You are good.

1175
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,900
- [ringing]
- Come on, come on.

1176
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,100
Josh ? This...

1177
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,100
There we go. Lemme get in here.

1178
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,000
Do this. This is whatyou love.

1179
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:51,400
'Cause ifyou keep playin'football,
you're gonna get hurt.

1180
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,400
Thanks, Dad.

1181
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,200
[Dave] And somethin'else.

1182
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,600
I know, I know.

1183
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,600
- Deal ?
- It's a deal.

1184
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,200
Mom, it's Carly.

1185
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,200
Call me back as soon
as you getthis message. Bye.

1186
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,700
[Dave] Did you hear that ?
Did you hear that ?

1187
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,900
Somebody's peein'on the lawn !

1188
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Nobody makes it on my lawn
and gets away with it !

1189
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,600
I'm gonna... [grunts] Oh !

1190
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,100
Oh !

1191
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,100
[woozy] Clean up on aisle three.

1192
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,700
Price check on dog biscuits.

1193
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,600
OK. Hi, Mr. Douglas.

1194
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,300
- Who are you ?
- How are ya ?

1195
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,400
[growls]

1196
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,400
[mumbling] Wait a second. I don't...

1197
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,300
I don't feel so good.

1198
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,200
- Dad !
- Dad ! Daddy !

1199
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,100
- Hit it.
- Yeah, OK.

1200
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,600
[tires squealing]

1201
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,900
I'm sorryyou're a dog. I am.

1202
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,600
Also, very sorry that you
won't be leaving here alive.

1203
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,200
People will be wondering
where you've disappeared to.

1204
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,000
Then again...

1205
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,400
... dogs do wander off. [chuckles]

1206
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,700
I can't believe you think you're
gonna get away with this, Kozak.

1207
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,600
Nonetheless, before you die,

1208
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,400
we're going to want
to run some tests on you.

1209
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,600
Eenie, meenie, minie,
cutyou, hurtyou, ow,

1210
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,600
your nose is coming off.

1211
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,500
Because we just don't understand
how you turned into him.

1212
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,700
- [barks]
- I'm very excited.

1213
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,100
I can'twaitto get inside that body
ofyours and just poke around.

1214
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,700
Aah !

1215
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,200
Oh, you filthy little mongrel !

1216
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,200
[blows, pants] That wasn't very nice.

1217
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,700
[Dave] That hurt, didn't it ?

1218
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,300
Gonna have to work
on that attitude when I get back.

1219
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,500
Meanwhile, we are gonna
run upstairs for a minute.

1220
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,500
It seems Dr. Strictland
is having a bit of a health crisis.

1221
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,000
And after that, we're offto court

1222
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:09,100
to watch Justin Forrester
back down to save his own skin.

1223
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,200
Be backto cutyou up
like a birthday cake later.

1224
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,300
[chittering]

1225
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,400
Huh. Who are you, anyway ?

1226
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,800
[barking]

1227
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,600
[Dave] Tibet. Really.

1228
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,100
Well, let me askyou this : [barking]

1229
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,000
Why did you bite me ?

1230
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,700
And turning me into a dog
would help you... how ?

1231
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,100
[whimpers]

1232
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,700
I guess you didn'tthink
aboutthat, did you ?

1233
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,200
[barking, chittering]

1234
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,200
Well, I turn into a human
when I sleep,

1235
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,300
but there's no time
for that now, is there ?

1236
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,100
There's gotta be another way.

1237
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,000
[barking]

1238
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,700
Meditation ?

1239
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,800
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Get in and drive.

1240
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,300
- What's wrong with you ?
- Dad's been dognapped. Go, go !

1241
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,900
[Dave] lnhale, exhale.

1242
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,200
I got to get my heart rate down.

1243
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,000
[inhales, exhales]

1244
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,400
I'm on a beach.

1245
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,700
[echoing] lnhale, exhale.

1246
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,500
Surrounded by fire hydrants.

1247
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,700
[deep breathing]

1248
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,100
Food everywhere.

1249
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:30,100
Slow rolling waves of gravy,

1250
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,800
crashing onto the shore.

1251
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,800
The beached whale
made of peanut butter.

1252
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,900
[heartbeat slowing]

1253
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,400
[Dave] It worked.

1254
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,100
It worked. Great.

1255
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,400
- [barks]
- I'm back. It's good, it's good.

1256
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,100
[howling]

1257
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,800
- New problem. New problem.
- [barks]

1258
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,700
[Dave] Yeah. I've got to get those keys.

1259
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,700
Now if I could just get overthere.

1260
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,700
OK. Yeah. Go. Go.

1261
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,400
- Go.
- [creaking]

1262
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,000
Oh, no.

1263
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,800
No, no, no, no, no... Oh !

1264
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,300
Oh ! Oh.

1265
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,600
[grunting] Oh.

1266
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,500
Oh, boy. OK.

1267
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,000
Who's got a plan ?

1268
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,300
Snake ! Do they have ears ?

1269
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,500
- [barking]
- Can you hear me ?

1270
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,900
- [barks]
- Don't need to show that hood at me.

1271
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,600
You better watch
'cause it's gonna fall over.

1272
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,000
- All right, monkey.
- [hooting]

1273
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,000
Sorry, chimp. You gotta push.

1274
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,100
On three, ready ?

1275
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,900
One, two, three. Push !

1276
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Harder this time. One, two, three. Push !

1277
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:04,400
[Dave] I need some help from
the rabbits. You gotta hop into this.

1278
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,200
One, two, three. Hop !

1279
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,500
Aw, ya almost got it. Ya almost got it.

1280
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,900
One more time.
We got a big one. Here we go.

1281
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,100

Go, go, go. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1287
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,200
Yeah, yeah. Thattaboy, Thattaboy !

1288
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,700
Do you see where it is ?

1289
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,400
'Course you do. Perfect.

1290
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,200
Stretch. Reach up.

1291
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,200
Up there, up there.

1292
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,300
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1293
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,400
[Dave chuckles]

1294
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,400
Beautiful.

1295
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,700
Yes ! We're outta here !

1296
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,100
[all barking]

1297
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,200
[grunts] Up, up.

All right. Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,100
Up there. Go !

1305
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,100

[grunting] Jeez.

1311
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,500
What have you been eatin'?

1312
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,400
- [barks]
- [Dave] Sorry about that.

1313
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,900
All right, up here. Up here. Up...

1314
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,500
Boy, you're heavy for a snake.

1315

That's creepy. Whoo. All right.

1318
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,500
[Dave] It's a left, a left,
a right and a left.

1319
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,900
Just go towards the light.

1320
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,200
I'll meet you guys out there.

1321
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,200
[electricity crackling]

1322
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,900
- Nice.
- Thankyou.

1323
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,100
[barking]

1324
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,900
[howls]

1325
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,500
There he is ! Look !

1328
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,300
We won't letthem get away with it.
Don't worry.

1329
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,900
- [barking]
- That's right.

1330
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,500
You know, you guys seem like
nice young people with great futures.

1331
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,800
You know that I'm
the deputy district attorney.

1332
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,700
Kidnapping is a capital crime.

1333
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,900
You just can't lock people
in cages, guys.

1334
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:13,800
Yeah, there's a definite... Iine
we're crossing here.

1335
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,000
We crossed that line
a long time ago, Larry.

1336
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,600
[Gwen] Deal with it.

1337
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,600
You know, you're not
gonna get away with this.

1338
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,600
Now...

1339
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:33,900
... you be a good little doggy
and dojustwhatwe say.

1340
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,300
[electricity crackling]

1341
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,300
Doesn't feel so good to get zapped,
does it ? Attaboy, chimp !

1342
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,600
Good, now get over here
and get me out of here.

1343
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,400
Come on. Put that thing down.

1344
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,500
- [barking]
- Please don't be mad, Daddy.

1345
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,500
Don't worry, Dad. We're gonna take you
to Mom and explain everything.

1346
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,400
[sighs] He's really angry.

1347
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,200
- [animals chittering]
- All right. We gotta go.

1348
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,300
Do you knowwhich waythe door is ?

1349
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,000
All right. Good, good, good.
Which way ?

1350
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,400
- Are you sure ?
- [monkey chitters]

1351
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,800
I like the dark travertine better.
What do you think ?

1352
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,500
I agree. I'll push for that one.

1353
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,700
- Yeah.
- OK, good.

1354
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,500
[barking]

1355
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,100
Could you just excuse me
for a minute ? I...

1356
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,400
Oh, yeah, sure.

1357
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,500
It's tough bein'a single mom.

1358
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,200
[sighs] I'm not a single mom.

1359
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,900
[Carly] Mom, we need to talk.

1360
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,700
Why aren'tyou guys in school ?
And why is Shaggy here ?

1361
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,600
It's not a dog. It's Dad.

1362
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,000
I thoughtwe were going
to break it to her slowly.

1363
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,000
Grant & Strictland's been doing
these weird animal tests.

1364
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,000
So when Shaggy bit Dad,
he turned into a dog.

1365
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,600
- Carly, that's not possible.
- It's true.

1366
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,300
lt... The computer.

1367
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,800
The other night,
he was typing on the computer.

1368
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,900
Come on, Dad. Type Mom a message.

1369
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,300
Come on.

1370
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,900
- [growling]
- Come on.

1371
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,400
Come on, Dad.
Do it likeyou did the other night.

1372
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,900
Come on. You know, like this.

1373
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,300
Just one sentence."l am Dad."

1374
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,300
- How'boutjust"Dad"?
- [Rebecca sighs]

1375
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:15,900
Kids...

1376
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
... I know that these last couple days

1377
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,500
- have been difficult, but...
- [phone rings]

1378
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,900
[phone ringing]

1379
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,800
- Hello ?
- Hi, honey, it's me.

1380
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,300
It's your father.

1381
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,600
Wow. Uh, so many questions.

1382
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,500
Do you know why the kids
are at my office with Shaggy ?

1383
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,600
He's not Shaggy.
His name is Khyi Yag Po.

1384
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,400
- Khyi Yag who ?
- [barks]

1385
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,100
[Dave] Po, that's his real name.

1386
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,800
You know, how did the kids
find him ? That's weird.

1387
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,900
That is notthe onlything that's weird.

1388
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,600
No, not that.
You oughta see what I'm lookin'at.

1389
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,200
They're trying
to tell me that he is you.

1390
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,100
[Dave] Stop that ! What are you doing ?

1391
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,400
Stop doing that, all right ?
You, quiet down.

1392
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:02,000
He's not... Guys, guys,
guys, guys ! He's not me.

1393
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,000
Well, yes, I gathered that.

1394
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,300
But they're half right. Look, um,
I'll meet you at the courthouse,

1395
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,000
and I'll explain everything to ya.

1396
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:12,200
- [Rebecca] You better explain it now.
- Well, I can't explain...

1397
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,900
Hold on a sec. I can't. The chimp.
What ? Excuse me. The monkey...

1398
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,600
- [Rebecca] Hello ?
- What is it ?

1399
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,400
[squealing]

1400
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,700
The chimp... The chimp ?
The chimp has got sunglasses on.

1401
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
He's supposed to be
giving me directions.

1402
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,700
- [snarls]
- Honey, you gotta believe me.

1403
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:33,300
- [barking]
- [panting]

1404
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,700
[barking]

1405
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,300
- I'll meet you at the courthouse.
- What ?

1406
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,500
Just meet me at the courthouse
and bring me some clothes, OK ?

1407
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,100
- Dave !
- Watch the rat !

1408
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,500
I love you ! Everybody, calm down !

1409
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,900
Dave !

1410
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,700
What's the matter with you ?

1411
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,900
How come you can't act
like the snake, right ?

1412
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,900
- [barks]
- Eh.

1413
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
He wants us to meet him
at the courthouse with clothes.

1414
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:09,000
- I don't get it.
- It doesn't make any sense.

1415
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,700
Two days ago,

1416
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,000
when your father came home
in the middle ofthe night,

1417
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,700
he tried to convince me that...

1418
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,800
... he'd turned into a dog.

1419
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,100
- Let's go to the courthouse.
- Come on, come on.

1420
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,600
That's my Norah Jones CD.

1421
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,300
[Dave] You can play it
ifyou want. Play it.

1422
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,000
- [horn honking]
- Oryou could throw it out ofthe car.

1423
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Why'd you do that ? Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa !

1424
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,900
Everybody watch out, watch out !

1425
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,200
[tires squealing]

1426
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,000
- [Dave] Ahh !
- [snarls]

1427
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,800
Phew. We're all done ?

1428
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,900
It's OK. Yeah, it's all right.

1429
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,400
I know, I saw it coming. [sighs]

1430
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,100
All rise for the
Honorable Judge Whittaker.

1431
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:02,600
[bangs gavel]

1432
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,600
[bailiff] Be seated and come to order.

1433
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,000
All right. I gotta go, guys.

1434
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,700
All right, you guys stay here.
All ofyou stay here.

1435
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,700
Look, look. I'll be right back.
Don't talk to anybody.

1436
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,100
Don't play the music, and, uh...

1437
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,400
You're in charge.

1438
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,400
[heartbeat accelerates]

1439
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,000
[Dave] To infinity and beyond !

1440
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,500
Do you guys think he's really coming ?

1441
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,200
I don't know, kids.

1442
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,100
Wait, look !

1443
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:54,100
[barking]

1444
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,200
[Carly] Daddy ? Is that you ?

1445
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,500
[Dave] It's me, kiddo.

1446
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,200
But it can't be.

1447
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,200
He's a dog.

1448
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,600
[Dave] Would a dog say this :

1449
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,400
[barking] I love you.

1450
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,400
What did you say ?

1451
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:14,200
[barking] I love you.

1452
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:19,200
- Oh, honey.
- [Dave] You got it.

1453
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,300
I love you too.

1454
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,500
[Dave] I love you.

1455
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,300
It's weird for me too. But it is me.

1456
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,600
That was cool.

1457
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:43,500
And I'm real sorry about everything.
I'm really sorry.

1458
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,200
And I'll make it up to all ofyou.

1459
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,200
But right now, I've got a trial to stop.

1460
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,600
[Trey] Uh, Mr. Douglas ?

1461
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,800
Yeah.

1462
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,000
- Ooh.
- No, I can't go.

1463
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,100
[chuckles]

1464
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,200
Everyone's gonna
need therapy after this.

1465
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,500
Good luck, honey.

1466
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,100
Counselors, you may proceed.

1467
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:07,000
Your Honor, at this time,
my clientwould like to change his plea.

1468
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,400
Hold everything, please.
Hold everything.

1469
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,200
[crowd murmuring]

1470
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:12,500
Kozak, sit.

1471
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,400
[Judge Whittaker] Mr. Douglas,
it is my understanding

1472
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,300
that you are no longer on this case.

1473
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,200
- That is exactly right.
- I understand, Your Honor.

1474
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,700
lfl couldjust have a few
moments with my associate.

1475
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,300
It's very important.

1476
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:30,200
Thank you, Your Honor.

1477
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,800
Give me a chance. Give me one more
chance. I will not disappointyou.

1478
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,300
Stay, Kozak !

1479
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,800
You gotta trust me.

1480
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,800
lfyou ever trusted me,
you gotta trust me right this minute.

1481
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,600
- He's back on, Your Honor.
- [sighs]

1482
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,300
We...

1483
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,500
Let's get Kozak back on the stand
one more time. Let me handle it.

1484
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,800
[clears throat]

1485
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:57,300
We'd like to recall
Dr. Kozak to the stand.

1486
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:01,100
[Judge Whittaker] Dr. Kozak,
would you please return to the stand.

1487
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,700
Uh, I'd be, uh, delighted.

1488
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,300
Counselor, you are
on a very short leash.

1489
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,900
This court has lost all patience
with ridiculous behavior.

1490
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Your Honor, just because something looks
ridiculous doesn't mean it's not true.

1491
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:22,100
Just takes more courage
to believe in it.

1492
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:26,200
Just don't let your courage get itself
kicked out of my courtroom.

1493
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,400
Thank you, Your Honor.

1494
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,600
Dr. Kozak, may I remind you
you are still under oath.

1495
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,400
Yes, you may.

1496
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,500
Dr. Kozak, is it true your
company is workin'on a drug

1497
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,100
thatwill extend human life
like a hundred years ?

1498
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,500
I am not at liberty
to discuss that matter.

1499
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,500
Of course you're not.
But ifthat were true,

1500
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,000
thatwould be a pretty big deal, right ?

1501
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,600
Ah,"were true,"
which it is not, probably.

1502
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,900
And whoever was in charge
ofdeveloping such a thing... Whoo !

1503
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Not only would they
be insanely wealthy,

1504
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,600
theywould be immortalized
in history, right ?

1505
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,100
[chuckles] Yes, I suppose they would.

1506
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:04,500
Wow. Wow. What a thrill it must be

1507
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,900
to work under Dr. Strictland.

1508
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,600
[sniffs]

1509
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,900
'Scuse me.

1510
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,300
Dr. Strictland, the creative force
at your company, right ?

1511
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,400
Well, ittakes many different people
to contribute to the higher... [babbles]

1512
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,100
[Dave] Yes, yes, yes, yes.
But what an honor it must be

1513
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,200
to work in Dr. Strictland's shadow.

1514
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,900
I don't work in anyone's shadow.
I wouldn't. I couldn't live with myself.

1515
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,200
There's nothing wrong
being in second place.

1516
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,900
Second fiddle,
second banana, second up.

1517
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,600
I am the chief scientist.

1518

Gettin'kinda agitated. What's up, dog ?

01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:44,100

1522
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,400

[Judge Whittaker] No more growling.

1525
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,100
Mr. Douglas, I have had enough.

1526
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,700
He stole a sacred dog from China,
stuck needles in it

1527
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,700
and almost killed this thing
for his little experiments.

1528
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,700
- The witness is not on trial.
- Thankyou.

1529
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,400
You putyour boss in a coma.

Escort Mr. Douglas out ofthe courtroom.

1531
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,500
You set that fire
to cover up your crime !

1532
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,500
He set that fire, and you're trying...

1533
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,600
You're trying to frame Forrester for it !

1534
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,900
I've seen that monkey that barks !
It's real !

1535
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,800
They've also got this rabbit
they taught how to fetch !

1536
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,200
- He does !
- Ladies and gentlemen ofthejury,

1537
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:26,200

1538

1539
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,800

1543
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,400
[panting]

1544
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,200
Sorry, uh, things
are a little stressy at work,

1545
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:56,900
long hours and the like. What ?

1546
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,800
What ?

1547
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,500
- [crowd gasping]
- What ?

1548
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:08,100
- Oh !

1549
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,800
[Kozak grunts] Whoo !

1550
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:17,000
[Dave] lfthat isn't evidence
of genetic mutation,

1551
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,200
I don't knowwhat is !

1552
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,900
On second thought, bailiff,
take him into custody.

1553
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,900
For what ?

1554
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Shufflin'around a little DNA ? Huh ?

1555
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,600
Don't you morons realize
I can make us all immortal ?

1556
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,200
Animals don't even understand
what's goin'on !

1557
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:32,100
Don't tell me they don't understand.

1558
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,000
Animals understand. I know different.

1559
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,500
Yeah, you know. [chuckles]

1560
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,600
This isn't over.
We got so much in common.

1561
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,600
Let's stay in touch, huh ? [growls]

1562
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,800
Ooh ! Are we goin'outside ?

1563
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:51,200
[chuckles]

1564
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,300
I owe you an apology.

1565
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,200
You gotthis one right, after all.

1566
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,000
Thank you, Ken.

1567
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:02,900
I don't even wanna know
how that car got here.

1568
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:06,100
[chimpanzee hooting]

1569
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,100
- Would... ?

1573
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,200
- [chuckles]
- Take your kudos.

1574
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,500

important people to talk to.

1575

1577
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,600

1578
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:35,400
[barking]

1579
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,600
- Hey.
- Mm.

1580
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,500
You made a great dog, Dad.

1581
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,600
But you're gonna make
an even better DA.

1582
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:45,600
Carly, it means the world to me
to hear you say that.

1583
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,100
It really does.

1584
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,100
Josh, listen.

1585
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,600
[sighs] It took the eyes
of a dog for me to see

1586
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,000
that I made it hard
foryou to tell the truth.

1587
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:59,300
The truth is, son, whatever you love

1588
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,400
I'm gonna love and support too.

1589
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,100
Thanks, Dad.

1590
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,300
