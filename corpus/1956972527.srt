00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:27,775
Look, enough with
the small talk.

377
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:28,745
What do you want?

378
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,384
Tonya, Tonya.

379
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:41,522
If I got what I wanted, Tonya,

380
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:46,596
this meeting would be
a whole lot less civil.

381
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:52,168
Edith was different.

382
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:56,039
She was more forgiving.

383
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:01,309
So it seems like she
surprised everyone

384
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:04,579
when she included
you in her will.

385
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:08,784
Bullshit.

386
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:10,053
She hated us.

387
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:12,788
That's what I thought.

388
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,061
Yet, here we are.

389
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:24,099
For what?

390
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:26,068
Read.

391
00:32:27,202 --> 00:32:28,538
You can read, can't you?

392
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:33,908
Or was your school too far
from your trailer park?

393
00:32:33,976 --> 00:32:35,577
We don't have to take this.

394
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:36,511
Sit down.

395
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:42,785
I don't want anything of hers.

396
00:32:44,385 --> 00:32:45,253
Really?

397
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,760
Not even $100,000?

398
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:55,263
Did you just say $100,000?

399
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:06,240
What's the catch?

400
00:33:06,307 --> 00:33:07,175
Pardon me?

401
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:10,244
With people like you,
there's always a catch.

402
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:11,213
People like me.

403
00:33:14,817 --> 00:33:17,786
You don't know
anything about me.

404
00:33:17,853 --> 00:33:21,323
You don't know anything
about me or my wife.

405
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,792
We know all we need to know.

406
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:26,496
So you think.

407
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,666
If you knew anything
about Edith,

408
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:33,769
you'd know there was
one thing she liked.

409
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:36,404
And that was to play games.

410
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:38,441
I like games.

411
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,544
What kind of game?

412
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:43,746
Simple ones, really?

413
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:48,151
Now, are any of
you superstitious?

414
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:54,589
Not afraid of ghosts or things
that go bump in the night?

415
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:56,891
I don't believe
in any of that shit.

416
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,494
So the answer would be no.

417
00:33:59,494 --> 00:34:00,562
It's a no for me too.

418
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:03,398
And what about you boys?

419
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:09,505
(CHUCKLES)

420
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:11,673
Good.

421
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,543
Well, the game's simple really?

422
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:18,379
There's a phone
upstairs in the study

423
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:19,582
at the end of the hall.

424
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:24,920
All four of you must go
up there one at a time.

425
00:34:26,054 --> 00:34:27,556
There's a number
next to the phone.

426
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:29,023
You call it.

427
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,425
You stay on the
phone for one minute,

428
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:32,862
you get $100,000.

429
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:36,664
That's it?

430
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:37,599
That's it.

431
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:39,601
Easy as pie.

432
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:42,438
Who are we calling?

433
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:45,907
You're calling Edith.

434
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:57,687
See, she had me bury
a phone with her.

435
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:00,389
Okay, now that's crazy.

436
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,894
Edith was always
a little eccentric.

437
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:07,896
Wait, so all we gotta do

438
00:35:07,963 --> 00:35:10,832
is stay on the
phone for a minute?

439
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:12,366
One minute.

440
00:35:12,434 --> 00:35:13,302
That's it.

441
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:16,038
Then you exit out the back door

442
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:19,507
and the money will be
yours in the morning.

443
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:21,676
And what if we hang up early?

444
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,045
Then your money will be split

445
00:35:23,112 --> 00:35:26,249
between the people
who stay on the call.

446
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:28,750
I still call bullshit.

447
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:30,452
I don't know what you're up to.

448
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:33,087
Read the contract.

449
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:34,189
It's all legal.

450
00:35:34,255 --> 00:35:36,757
Legal or not, I
don't want your money.

451
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:38,260
Hey, speak for yourself.

452
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:43,298
If I get this, we're set.

453
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:46,635
Zack, there is no we.

454
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:49,405
You gotta get that
through your head.

455
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,808
And I'm outta here.

456
00:35:57,746 --> 00:35:58,814
Screw your game.

457
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:03,585
Tonya, before you leave, dear,

458
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:08,423
there's one more thing
I need to tell you.

459
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:10,826
What?

460
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,829
Edith's death was
not an accident.

461
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:21,570
The paper was kind enough
to omit the details,

462
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:27,309
but Edith killed herself.

463
00:36:31,447 --> 00:36:32,914
That sucks.

464
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:34,650
What does it have to do with us?

465
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:37,786
Everything.

466
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,025
You see, she left
a suicide note.

467
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,998
And in that note, she
made it very clear

468
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:54,469
that your constant
threats to her,

469
00:36:54,536 --> 00:36:58,606
you and your little
friends over the years

470
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:00,376
was more than she could bear.

471
00:37:03,478 --> 00:37:04,913
She was a strong woman,

472
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:07,682
but she was depressed.

473
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:12,853
And all those years of torture-

474
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,654
- They were just pranks.

475
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:15,091
They were pranks to you.

476
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:20,362
They were devastating to her.

477
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:23,032
Devastating.

478
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,936
Then your little confrontation
with her the other night.

479
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:32,574
That was the final straw.

480
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:33,642
I was traveling.

481
00:37:35,978 --> 00:37:39,414
I wish to God I was
here, but I wasn't.

482
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:43,117
She was all alone.

483
00:37:43,184 --> 00:37:45,920
She was afraid for her life.

484
00:37:54,195 --> 00:37:56,766
And she knew that not
one person in this town

485
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,637
would protect her from
you or you or you.

486
00:38:03,204 --> 00:38:04,672
Oh God!

487
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:05,373
I didn't even know her.

488
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,509
But you were here.

489
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,443
You saw it.

490
00:38:12,213 --> 00:38:13,081
Yeah.

491
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,986
What are you saying?

492
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:24,125
I'm saying, you let me
honor my wife's last wish

493
00:38:24,192 --> 00:38:25,527
by making the call.

494
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:34,670
Otherwise, I'll go to
the police with the note.

495
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:42,611
Make sure that you all
pay for what you did.

496
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:48,983
I loved Edith more than life.

497
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:53,989
Even more than revenge.

498
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:58,027
That's why I'm
giving you a choice.

499
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,601
Now, I'm gonna pour
myself a drink.

500
00:39:08,235 --> 00:39:10,071
When I get back, I
expect an answer.

501
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:29,657
TONYA: You guys aren't
seriously considering this,

502
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:30,324
are you?

503
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:31,259
Hell yeah.

504
00:39:32,393 --> 00:39:33,394

up in the shit hole,

this (INDISTINCT)

TONYA: Why?

511
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:53,782
You got a record?

512
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,052
I just can't.

513
00:39:58,186 --> 00:39:59,721

514
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:01,222
There's four of us.

515
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,026
We each call, we could
be gone in five minutes.

516
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:11,533
So what's it gonna be?

517
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:18,740
Do you make your call
or do I make mine?

518
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:24,278
We're gonna do it, but
if you try anything...

519
00:40:24,346 --> 00:40:26,114
You don't have
to worry about me.

520
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:29,617
I'll be outside
the back entrance

waiting to greet you
when you're done.

522
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,089
Just one of you can
go upstairs at a time.

523

to wait down here.

Don't go snooping around.

525

completed the call,

526

upstairs, it will chime.

527
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:57,779

can take their turn.

your brother's footsteps.

531
00:41:13,128 --> 00:41:14,129
You'll be second.

Chris, you follow Brett.

533
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:23,837

the final call.

final wish has been granted.

Once we're done with all this,

539
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,691
we can put the
ugliness behind us

540
00:41:42,757 --> 00:41:44,092
and we can start to heal.

Mrs. Cranston gave me?

Hello, Tonya.

962
01:26:15,961 --> 01:26:19,798
When I saw you wearing the
necklace that I gave Laura,

963
01:26:19,864 --> 01:26:21,768
I knew she was dead,
and I knew it was you.

964

When they told us she was
missing and I was blamed,

I died inside.

966
01:26:31,609 --> 01:26:34,145

around me and I joined them.

me but hatred and rage.
