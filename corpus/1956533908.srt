- Romantic?

118
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:48,778

but we can go with romantic,

119
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,655
sure.

120
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,242

So you want to get a drink
with me when we get back

122
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,455
- I'd like that, but I have
script revisions to go over

123
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:58,915
- Bring your laptop.
- I don't know.

124
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:01,000
- Come on, just one drink.
- Just one.

Now what is it, Kimmy?

130
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,310
- Milo, don't do this to me.

131
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,105
- Wait, wait, wait, we've been
on set two weeks, it's Milo.

132
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,482
Now what's the problem?

133
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,067
- What's the difference?

134
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,695
Five AM, how am I supposed
to be hot at five AM?

135
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,490
- Kimmy, you're gorgeous 24/7, okay?

136
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,033
I got enough problems.
- Milo!

137
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,917

seen Bob's light meter?

138
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,752
Rose, light meter?

139
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,295

another round of drinks?

00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,103
- Yes, two more.

153
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,773

such a bad influence.

154
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,277

good influence and you know it.

155

Rose, look, we're in paradise
here and all you can think

156
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,530
about is work.

157
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:40,367
- Yeah, well I love my job
and I love making movies.

158
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,537
- So do I, but you can't
let it consume your life.

159
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,500
- You know, you're pretty smart for a guy

160
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,878
who likes to jump off buildings.

161
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,170
- I have my moments.

162
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,047
- Yeah, one.

163
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,008
- What is, I thought you
were working on the script,

164
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,343
what is--
- I was, but then

165
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,847
I stumbled upon this when I
was fact checking a scene.

166
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,307
Oh my gosh, check this out.

167
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,225
- What is that?

168
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,895
- I know, isn't it crazy?

169
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,940
Some creature from Polynesian
folklore, the peepalo,

170
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,527
a river devil, they've been
sighted for hundreds of years

171
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:19,323
and then now it's saying that
one was just spotted last week

172
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,117
(man chuckles nervously)

173
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:23,202

00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:23,993

Yeah, I--

177
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,665
- Yoohoo, what are you
guys doing over there?

178
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:31,668
- Nothing, Kimmy, just
preparing for tomorrow's shoot.

179
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,378
- Well, then you won't
mind if I borrow Jack.

180
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,757
There's a spot on my back I can't reach.

181
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,343
- Kimmy, we're actually
kinda busy right now.

182
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,595
- It'll only take a minute.

183
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,223
You wouldn't want your star
to burn now, would you?

184
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,435
- I will be right back, I promise.

185
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,230
(idyllic music)

186
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,985
- Thanks, Jack.

187
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,822
(idyllic music)

188
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:06,287
(Kimmy sighs happily)

189
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:09,873
(Kimmy moans)

190
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,668
(idyllic music)

191
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,927
(Rose groans)

192
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,307
(foreboding music)

193
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,810
(dramatic music)

194
00:14:56,063 --> 00:15:01,277
(creature growls)
(woman screams)

195
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,698
(creature growls)

196
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:13,413
(idyllic music)

197
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,623
- I think that's Kimmy Weston.

198
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,708
- Who?
- Kimmy Weston.

199
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,210
I'm gonna ask.
- Whatever.

200
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,920
- Excuse me, are you Kimmy Weston?

201
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,465
- I'm kind of a big deal.

202
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,135
- Oh man, I knew it, see,
I told you it was her.

203
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,220
- Yeah, terrific.

204
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,850
- I have seen all of your
pictures, even Hillbilly Hostage.

205
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,062
I don't care what the critics
say, you were great in that.

206
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:37,562
- I know, right?

207
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,730
- Could you do the line?

208
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,150
- Oh, I couldn't possibly.

209
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,568
- Please, it would make my year.

210
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,450
- (sighs) Suck lead, you
hillbilly butt nugget. (laughs)

211
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,452
- (laughs) That is so great.

212
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,662
- Awesome.

213
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:53,995
- I've got to get a picture.

214
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,497
- Well, then, you'll want
a picture with Jack, too,

215
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,373
'cause he's not only a stunt man,

216
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,042
he is the head chopper himself.

217
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:00,877
- No way! (laughs)

218
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,503
Honey, get a picture of us quick.

219
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,340
- Okay, everybody ready?

220
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,803
And say cheese.

221
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,015
- Look, I'm sorry, I gotta go.

222
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,727
- Jack, where are you going?

223
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,480
(shutter clicks)

224
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,108
(phone rings)

225
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:27,028
- Yes, they're all here.

226
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,240
Tomorrow should be no problem.

227
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,077
Yep.

228
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,330
- (laughs) Kimmy, what a piece of work.

229
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,373
What are you doing, where are you going?

230
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,207
We're having a good time.

231
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,585
- I have a job to do and
I can't compete with that.

232
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,588
- Rose, sit down, would you?

233
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:45,422
- I'll see you on set.

234
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,590
- Rose, Rose!

235
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,265
(Jack sighs)

236
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,018
(somber music)

237
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:49,987
- Hold it.

238
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,158
(gun cocks)

239
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,618
Move.

240
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,038
Move!

241
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,877
(eerie music)

242
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,637
Look what I caught.

243
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,307
(eerie music)

244
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:29,025
- Robert Lovegrove of
the University of Hawaii.

245
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,527
- Right.

246
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,905
- Your faculty ID says you're
a professor of herpetology.

247
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,573
Reptiles, right?
- That's a fact.

248
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:38,202
Listen, whatever your name is...

249
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,663
I don't know why you're keeping me here,

250
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,332
but you're making a big mistake.

251
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:46,877
There's a great big creature
out there, very dangerous.

252
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:50,005
It'll get out of the
jungle, gonna kill us all.

253
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:53,342
- No, no, wait, don't tell me,
not the mythical river demon.

254
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:56,262
100 feet long, teeth like daggers?

255
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:59,180
(group laughs)

256
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,557
- It's not mythical.

257
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,852
Evolutionary mutation turned
it into a dangerous predator

258
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:04,978
and it's hungry.

259
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,688
- Very interesting.

260
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,400
But I don't care about your fairy tales

261
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,693
or your stupid turtle.

262
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:15,863
What I do care about is
money and how much someone

263
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,575
is willing to pay me for your safe return.

264
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,537
- I don't know if you've looked
in here, but that enough?

265
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,040
- That'll do for a down payment.

266
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,208
- My family's very wealthy.

267
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,043
If you want money, they'll
pay to get me out of here.

268
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,587
I still think we need to
get out of this jungle

269
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:31,963
as soon as possible.

270
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,465
- I'll tell you when we leave.

271
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,302
Sleep tight, you'll have company later on.

272
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,807
- Get up.

273
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:44,433
(eerie music)

274
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,617
I'll bring you food later.

275
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,038
(dramatic music)

276
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,747
- Come, this way, not much farther.

277
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,792
- Better not be, it feels
like we've been hiking

278
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,085
10 miles since we left the car behind.

279
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,212
- More like three, but
I know what you mean,

280
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,755
it's practically all been uphill.

281
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,592
- Tell me about it, you sure
it's worth the trip, Doctor?

282
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,177
- Vicky, if we find a
ghost orchid, it will be.

283
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,305
- It just seems like we're
spending a lot of time and money

284
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,682
just to look at a flower.

285
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:07,100
- Ah, but one of the rarest
flowers in the world,

286
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,562
allegedly imbued with
miraculous recuperative powers.

287
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,813
- Really?

288
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,148
- Well, the Mayans swore by them.

289
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:16,067
So did the medicine men of the
Arapaho and Apalachee tribes

290
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,735
in the Southern Everglades.

291
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,572
Professor Samson even brought
one back to UMC in '89.

292
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:22,448
- I remember you talking about that.

293
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,660
But didn't you say the
flower's effects weaken

294
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,828
by the time it takes to
get it back to the lab?

295
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,122
- Correct, but it was
still noted that the petals

296
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,500
showed remarkable healing ability.

297
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,043
- Well, if it's so remarkable,
then why isn't everyone

298
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,460
trying to grow them?

299
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,755
- Pardon the pun, but that's
the root of the problem.

300
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,798
The ghost orchid can
remain inactive for years,

301
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,552
sometimes decades, then
just suddenly bloom,

302
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:45,347
sometimes three times in a
year, never in captivity.

303
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,348
- [Girl] What happens if
we do happen to find one?

304
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,392
(creature growls)

305
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,225
- That's what why we
brought the cooler unit.

306
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,268
It'll keep the petals fresh until

307
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,437
we can get them back to
the lab on the mainland.

308
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,647
- Shh!

309
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:56,190
- Something wrong, Leilani?

310
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,233
(creature growls)

311
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,152
- What was that?

312
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,445
- I don't know, is
everything okay, Leilani?

313
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,572
- Yes, okay.

314
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,327
- Oh my gosh.
- That them, Doctor?

315
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,413
- Yes, it appears we've hit the jackpot.

316
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,832
- Great!

317
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,708
- Ladies?
- Yes, Leilani?

318
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,543
- If you don't mind I'm
gonna step out for a minute.

319
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,462
- Of course.

320
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:19,422
Gimme your knife?

321
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,552
Vicky, do you realize these
plants are only ever seen

322
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,140
by intrepid adventurers who
hike through hip deep swampland

323
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,973
to find them?

324
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,975
- Isn't that exactly what we just did?

325
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,395
- I suppose, gimme the cooler?

326
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,737
(Leilani screams)

327
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,197
- What was that?

328
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,115
- Sounded like Leilani.

329
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:45,990
- Leilani?

330
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,078
Leilani?

331
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,622
(eerie music)

332
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,540
I don't know what's
going on here, but I say

333
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,582
we get the hell out of here now.

334
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,960
- I'm not going anywhere without
the rest of those orchids.

335
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,793
- But--

336
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,797
- I'm not leaving without these flowers.

337
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,925
(dramatic music)

338
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,218
(brush rustles)

339
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,097
(creature hisses)

340
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,555
- Oh my God.

341
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,683
(creature growls)

342
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,352
(dramatic music)

343
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,688
(creature snarls)

344
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,148
(girls whimper)

345
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,735
(creature growls)

346
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:23,903
- [Vicky] No!

347
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,958
- Listen.

348
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,918
Sorry about what happened
yesterday at the pool.

349
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,797
- Seriously, you rubbing
lotion on another woman's

350
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,382
half naked body is a great date.

351
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,802
- Date, you said date,
you did, you said date,

352
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:49,178
that was an official date, then.

353
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,597
- First and last.

354
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,017
- Come on, Rose, sleeping
beauty back there,

355
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,185
she's not my type.

356
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,520
She's just bored, she wanted somebody

357
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,605
to pay attention to her.

358
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:00,107
- Yeah.

359
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,067
(Kimmy snorts)

360
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,862
(idyllic music)

361
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,490
- Nothing happened, I swear.

362
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,955
Give me another chance,
I'll make it up to you, huh?

363
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,748
That's a yes, that is a yes.

364
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,667
- No, maybe.

365
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,795
- It's a maybe, that's a
maybe then, I'll take maybe.

366
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:24,588
- Look, we're 40 minutes late
thanks to this prima donna.

367
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,632
(Kimmy yawns)

368
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,758
- Don't worry about it,
Milo won't even notice.

369
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,760
- Where the hell is Kimmy?

370
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,805
- So sorry, Milo, we got
hung up at the hotel.

371
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,473
It won't happen again.

372
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,685
- Just get her in wardrobe,
we're already running late.

373
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,687
And Bob's assistant, who
I hate, never showed.

374
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,272
- You mean Deb.
- I mean Deb.

375
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,567
Nobody's seen her since yesterday.

376
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,152
- For the love of God, will
somebody get me a latte?

377
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,028
- Let's go, let's go.
- Get her out of here.

378
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,073
What the hell else can go wrong?

379
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,242
And I'm getting dirty.

380
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,995
Okay, you've just seen
your boyfriend slaughtered

381
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:59,248
by a machete wielding maniac,
you're lost, you're scared--

382
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,167
(Kimmy slurps)

383
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,877
Kimmy, are you even listening to me?

384
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,337
- Yeah, Milo, I get it,
I'm lost and scared.

385
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,215
Can somebody get me another one of these?

386
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,842
- After the next take, and it's Milo!

387
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,305
Now let's do this thing,
all right, go, go.

388
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,642
All right, people, while
we're young, let's get one

389
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:17,725
in the can, let's go.

390
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:19,560
- Wish me luck.

391
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,773
(Rose sighs)

392
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:29,362
- Head Chopper three, scene 37, take one.

393
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,030
(marker clicks)

394
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,990
- And action.

395
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,577
- Oh my God, last thing
I knew, it killed Bruce

396
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:38,330
and his head bounced on the
ground like a beach ball.

397
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,373
- Shh, you're safe, Jerry's
out there hunting that maniac

398
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,958
right now, I'm sure we're safe.

399
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,085
- No!

400
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,962
(knife slashes)
(Jack laughs evilly)

401
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,713
(both scream)

402
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:48,840
- Oh my God!

403
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,050
(both scream)

404
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,842
(head groans)

405
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,843
- Help me.

406
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,678
(both scream)

407
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,555
- Not again!
- Help me.

408
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,102
- No, cut, cut, cut, I hate it.

409
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:05,982
(director sighs)

410
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,402
Rachel, honey, a word, please.

411
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:09,402
- Uh-huh?
- It's your scream.

412
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,737
- What's wrong with it?

413
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,613
- We need more?
- More what?

414
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:17,160
- More emotion, more, just
give me more, okay, how's that?

415
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
(phone rings)

416
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,078
Whatever it is you're doing, do more.

417
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,288
- Okay.

418
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,122
- I gotta take this, why
don't you go practice a few

419
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,082
before the next take,
and I'll take this call?

420
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,708
- Okay, Milo.
- Great, thanks.

421
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:28,922
- Talk to me.

422
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:31,590
What?

423
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,720
- I'm sure we're safe, Jerry is out there

424
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,138
hunting that maniac right now.

425
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,767
You have nothing to worry about.

426
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,312
No, God, not again!

427
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:46,563
Shh, you're safe, Jerry
is out there hunting

428
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,275
that maniac right now, you
have nothing to worry about.

429
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:52,778
No, God, not again! (fakes screaming)

430
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,910
(creature growls)

431
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,370
(dramatic music)

432
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,038
(Rachel screams)

433
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,002
(creature snarls)
(Rachel whimpers)

434
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,878
(dramatic music)

435
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:19,805
(creature growls)

436
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,060
(creature roars)

437
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,980
(Rachel whimpers)

438
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:31,233
(creature growls)

439
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,405
(Rachel whimpers)

440
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:39,992
(Rachel screams)

441
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,788
(creature roars)

442
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,250
(both roar)

443
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,962
- That, that's my actress,
I think she's finally

444
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,632
learned how to scream,
but Morrie, come on,

445
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,050
back to this call here, what's going on?

446
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,927
- What's up with Milo?

447
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,512
- I don't know, but
something must be wrong.

448
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,265
- This is the last low budget movie I do.

449
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,397
- That's fine, Morrie, but
my contract says pay or play,

450
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,315
and guess what, you're paying.

451
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:18,865
- Gunner.

452
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:19,698
(men laugh)

453
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,117
- Hey, city black.
- Look at you,

454
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,077
look at you with all your toys,

455
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,495
you got enough explosives here?

456
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,455
- Yeah, no point in
being a pyrotechnics guy

457
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,207
if you can't blow some stuff up.

458
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,167
- I recognize this C4 detonator.

459
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,000
What's the other thing?

460
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,170
- These are blasting caps.

461
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,588
All you gotta do, throw 'em on the ground

462
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,882
and they'll explode.

463
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,425
- Just throw 'em on the ground?

464
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,927
- Throw 'em on the ground.

465
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:39,760
- Just throw 'em on the ground.

466
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,055
- No, not, no, not now.
(Jack laughs)

467
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,475
- All right, everybody, listen
up, I got an announcement.

468
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,477
One of the investors pulled
out of the production

469
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:48,937
and the studio's shutting us down.

470
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,605
- What about our checks?
- Are they good?

471
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,148
- Checks are good, everyone's
gonna get paid, okay?

472
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,985
Don't worry about it, we're
just shutting down, I'm sorry.

473
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,153
(Jack groans)

474
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,822
- Darn it!
- I'm outta here.

475
00:28:58,822 --> 00:28:59,780
- Not my fault.

476
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,200
- I got a good mind to use this for real.

477
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,535
- Yeah, yeah.

478
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,288
(somber music)

479
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,055
- Hey.

480
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:27,267
(woman splashes)

481
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,435
Gee, Jamie, what's your damage?

482
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,687
- Oh, so you remember my name now?

483
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,813
'Cause, like, you forgot it when

484
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,523
miss B movie queen showed up.

485
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,735
- They're not B movies,
they're exploitation films.

486
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:38,737
I told you that.

487
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:41,823
- You were gushing all over her
like some drooling teenager.

488
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,658
(gasps) Are you Kimmy?

489
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:46,118
- Okay, I was a little starstruck.

490
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,453
Let me make it up to you.

491
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,498
I've got a great place picked out.

492
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,500
We'll have to hike a little
ways to get there, but.

493
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,543
- Oh, well.

494
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:57,338
I did just buy some new
cute hiking boots, but

495
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,007
this is on the north side.

496
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,675
Honey, that's the uninhabited
part of the island.

497
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,553
I don't think it's safe.

498
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:05,763
- Of course it's safe, this is Hawaii.

499
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,598
Nothing bad ever happens in Hawaii.

500
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,728
- Yeah, you're right, it's
the sunshine. (giggles)

501
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,565
Let's do it. (giggles)

502
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:18,233
(somber music)

503
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,083
- What now?

504
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,045
I'll be back.

505
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:46,387
What's going on?

506
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,347
- I don't know, let's find out.

507
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,558
(somber music)

508
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:58,817
You need some help?

509
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:02,028
- No, but I'm afraid that you might.

510
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,905
(dramatic music)

511
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,743
- What's going on?
- Looks like a car broke down.

512
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,373
- Freeze, hold it right there, ladies.

513
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,917
(women gasp)

514
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:19,753
- Move!

515
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:20,630
- Move it.

516
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:23,800
- Move!

517
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,093
(women whimper)

518
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,220
- Hey, go easy on her.

519
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,597
(guns fire)
(women scream)

520
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:29,722
- Enough!

521
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,142
(Kimmy gasps in shock)

522
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,605
You, my friend, you are the director, yes?

523
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:38,480
- Uh-huh.

524
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,110
- Well, Mr. 45 here has a change of plans

525
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,987
and now, I am in charge, comprende?

526
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:48,407
Very good.

527
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,158
Now then.

528
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,873
You all work for a very rich movie studio.

529
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:59,460
I am quite certain that
they don't want any harm

530
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:01,378
to come to any of their people.

531
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,717
So they will meet our demands
and you all get to go home

532
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,637
with no bullet holes in your head.

533
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:12,640
This is a win-win for
everyone, yes, don't you think?

534
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,560
(suspenseful music)

535
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,520
(Gunner grunts)
(bomb explodes)

536
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,855
- Go man, go, go, go!

537
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:19,772
- Go, go get them!

538
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,025
Don't kill them, shoot them in the ass!

539
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,653
(Gunner pants)

540
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,657
- Go, go!

541
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:31,325
(dramatic music)

542
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,160
- They're gonna shoot our asses!

543
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,997
- Well, ass, head, we're
still gonna be dead, come on.

544
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,460
- Now I assume that you
all have cell phones.

545
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,045
Please, take them out,
hand them to Kazuto.

546
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,550
(phone rings)

547
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:53,263
Yes, boss, yes, we have
them, well, most of them.

548
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,018
But I would not worry.

549
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,813
I don't think they're going to go far.

550
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,527
Okay.

551
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,112
(eerie music)

552
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,782
- Are we there yet?

553
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,035
- I think the beach is just
about a quarter mile this way.

554
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,245
- Who knows, that guide at
the pool could have given us

555
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,622
good directions.

556
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:19,873
- He probably just wanted us
to take one of his crazy tours.

557
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:20,792
- Ugh.

558
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,252
- Come on, let's hit it.

559
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:23,502
- You said hit it, what?

560
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,923
(suspenseful music)

561
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,013
(men pant)

562
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,265
- We gotta split up.

563
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:37,558
- All right, later, Jay.

564
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,063
(dramatic music)

565
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,982
(Jack grunts)

566
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,858
(dramatic music)

567
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,168
(Jack grunts)

568
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,962
(man grunts)

569
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:08,882
(dramatic music)

570
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,300
(gun fires)

571
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:21,685
(creature snarls)

572
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,982
(Jack pants)

573
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,108
(creature roars)

574
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,278
(suspenseful music)

575
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,955
- Doesn't this beat staying in the room?

576
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,332
- I suppose.

577
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,752
- See, there's more to life
than playing video games.

578
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,295
- Ha, like what, specifically?

579
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,757
- Wait a second.
- What?

580
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,133
- Did you hear something?

581
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,135
- No.
- I know I heard something.

582
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,137
In the bushes.

583
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,765
- Stop it, stop trying to scare me.

584
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,853
(Rose pants)

585
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,395
- Arturo.

586
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,815
- Miguel, why am I looking
only at one man here?

587
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:10,067
Please do not tell me that
you let them get away.

588
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,318
- I'm sorry, Arturo.

589
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,028
- What's going on?
- Shh.

590
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,990
- And where, may I ask, is
this genius partner of yours?

591
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,492
- I haven't seen him since we split up,

592
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,827
but I did find this off of the falls.

593
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:21,870
- A video camera.

594
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,332
Good, we can make a movie.

595
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:28,793
- So what do we do now?

596
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,297
- Now?

597
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,802
I guess we take them to
go see the man, yeah?

598
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,263
Come.

599
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:42,892
Come, come.

600
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:46,312
- You know, this is
kidnapping, really kidnapping.

601
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,647
- Yes, I am aware of this, thank you.

602
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,023
Why don't you just pretend

603
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,983
that you are in one of your movies,

604
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,653
yes, like the Hillbilly Hostage, hmm?

605
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,322
- You saw Hillbilly Hostage?

606
00:35:56,322 --> 00:36:00,283
- Oh, indeed, it was
a truly terrible film.

607
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,662
(Kimmy sighs)

608
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,332
(eerie music)

609
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,795
(camera beeps)

610
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,172
- [Professor] You getting this?

611
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,673
- [Assistant] I'm getting it all.

612
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,675
(creature snarls)
(woman screams)

613
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:19,303
(eerie music)

614
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:22,765
- Dios mio.

615
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:25,643
(dramatic music)

616
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:29,272
- I am sweating like a pound puppy.

617
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,148
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

618
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,650
- I think you're gonna
forgive me real soon.

619
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,402
- Oh, really, is there
a mall around that bend?

620
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,653
- Something even better.

621
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,323
(idyllic music)

622
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:45,412
- Honey, you weren't
kidding, it's so beautiful.

623
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,872
- See, I told you.

624
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,625
- Come on, let's go for a dip.

625
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,920
(both laugh)

626
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,133
I got you, hurry up! (squeals)

627
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,637
Let's go, it's cold!

628
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:04,098
(idyllic music)

629
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,642
(both laugh)

630
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,688
(suspenseful music)

631
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,583
- Boss, there is
something you need to see.

632
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,252
- First give me some good news.

633
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:39,717
- We got the director, we
got the actress and we got

634
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:42,637
that one, whoever the hell she is.

635
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,097
- What happened there?

636
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,432
- The guy tried to be a hero.

637
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,058
- What about the others?

638
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:51,020
- Listen, there is no time
for this, you have to see

639
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,062
what is on here.

640
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:54,565
- Gimme your gun.

641
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:56,650
- What?

642
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,028
- Your 45, give it to me.

643
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:04,033
(man groans)

644
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,827
When I ask a question, you answer.

645
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:11,040
- Two of the prisoners
got away, JC is missing.

646
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,458
I think he might be dead.

647
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:13,375
- Why?

648
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,460
- One of the men brought
this back from the falls.

649
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,338
You take a look what's on
it, I think you'll know why.

650
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,885
- Lock them up with the professor.

651
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:25,680
All right, let's see
what's so damn important.

652
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,265
(eerie music)

653
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,103
- Bad boy! (squeals)

654
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,065
(both sigh)

655
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:37,525
(Jamie laughs)

656
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:38,733
- Still pissed at me?

657
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,402
- Nah, it's hard to stay mad

658
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,028
in a place as beautiful as this.

659
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,363
- Good, 'cause there's a little something

660
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,282
I'd love for you to do for me.

661
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,035
- Ricky, whatever did you have in mind?

662
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:51,413
- First, hold the fort,
I gotta water the plants.

663
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,332
- You're such a geek.

664
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,583
- I'll be right back.

665
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:59,088
- No, take your time, I'm just
gonna go for another swim.

666
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:04,302
- Okay!
(Jamie groans)

667
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,098
(eerie music)

668
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:11,725
(zipper zips)

669
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:17,063
(water trickles)

670
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,567
(creature growls)

671
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,152
(eerie music)

672
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,452
(water trickles)
(gravel rustles)

673
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,372
(man screams)
(creature snarls)

674
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:36,292
(dramatic music)

675
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:41,963
- Rick?

676
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:46,135
(suspenseful music)

677
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:55,643
Rick?

678
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,190
Where are you?

679
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:08,823
Rick, if you're punking me,
consider yourself single!

680
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,248
Heck?

681
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:22,630
(footsteps approach)

682
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:27,593
- Come on, move it, let's go.

683
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:29,428
- Coming.

684
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,765
(Professor chuckles)

685
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:34,308
- One big happy family.

686
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,645
(Rose sighs)

687
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:41,023
(suspenseful music)

688
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:41,898
- Rick?

689
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,572
- You getting this?
- I'm getting it all.

690
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,740
It's fantastic.

691
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,328
It's just like you said.

692
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,667
(professor laughs)

693
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,420
(creature snarls)
(blood splatters)

694
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:04,338
- Stop.

695
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,257
(camera beeps)

696
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:07,675
Run it back from there.

697
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:10,385
(tape rewinds)

698
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,223
(creature snarls)
(blood spatters)

699
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,392
(camera beeps)
(tape rewinds)

700
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,977
- You see, that crazy scientist did it.

701
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,728
He was telling the truth.

702
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,732
We need to get out of here right now.

703
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:24,900
(camera beeps)

704
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,113
(creature snarls)
(blood spatters)

705
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:32,448
- Pike, what is it?

706
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,037
- This is no turtle egg.

707
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:42,292
- Dios mio, it came out
of that thing, didn't it?

708
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:44,253
- Please, come on.

709
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:47,297
- Hey, I hate snakes, okay, you know that.

710
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,467
- We're not dealing with snakes.

711
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:51,052
(man speaks Spanish)

712
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:52,468
- Something much worse.

713
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:57,015
It's like an unholy
union between a piranha

714
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,642
and an anaconda.

715
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,185
- You mean a piranhaconda.

716
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,150
- I can't believe you just said that.

717
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,985
- Guys, please just get rid of this thing

718
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:10,820
before that other one
comes sniffing around here.

719
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:14,408
- You know what, Pike, maybe he's right,

720
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:16,285
I mean, we have lost a guy already.

721
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,413
- This could be worth a fortune

722
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,707
and I never leave money behind.

723
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,625
- What about the ransom?

724
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:26,087
- We stick to the plan, I don't
care if it's Satan himself

725
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:28,838
in that jungle, I don't
leave until I get paid.

726
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:36,013
(eerie music)

727
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,900
(engine fails to turn over)

728
00:42:54,532 --> 00:42:56,158
- Don't bother.

729
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:58,535
They took the distributor cap.

730
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,955
It's like they didn't
want us going for help.

731
00:43:00,955 --> 00:43:04,123
- (sighs) I'm glad you're alive.

732
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,500
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

733
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:09,170
So what do you want to do?

734
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,757
- Well, we go back the
way we came, it's 14 miles

735
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:12,548
back to the highway.

736
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,467
- Uh-huh.

737
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,553
- We follow these treads,
go looking for trouble.

738
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,640
- Lemme get some supplies.

739
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,810
- Hey, Gunner, there's one more thing.

740
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,022
- That guy that was chasing me?

741
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:30,233
It sounded like something
got him, some kinda animal.

742
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,485
- Animal, what kind of animal?

743
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,488
- Like nothing I've ever heard before.

744
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:38,950
- Well, I'll get more supplies.

745
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,588
(director groans)

746
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:55,758
- Why would anybody want to
kidnap a low budget movie crew?

747
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,053
- MGM recently bought our studio.

748
00:43:58,053 --> 00:43:59,972
They've got deep pockets.

749
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:02,975
- Of course, MGM could
decide not to pay a cent.

750
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,312
Hey, Kimmy, kinda curious, how big

751
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:08,730
is the studio's insurance policy on you?

752
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:11,192
- Lock it up, Milo, they'll pay.

753
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:12,818
- It's Milo!

754
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,820
- Whatever, when I get back,
I'm going on Oprah and Leno,

755
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,238
the whole talk show circuit.

756
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,282
This is exactly what my career needed.

757
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,493
- Unless our illustrious
host decides to put

758
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,703
a bullet in your head.

759
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,165
- You know, you're a long
way from the university,

760
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:28,500
Professor, what are you doing out here?

761
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:32,003
- Honey, if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

762
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:33,255
- Why don't you try us?

763
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,885
- When I was a kid, my dad
worked for Santiago oil company.

764
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,388
Him and the whole crew
went into the jungle,

765
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:44,975
never came out, lot of
rumors started to circulate

766
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,977
and people got kind of scared.

767
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,105
A few more disappeared and then

768
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:53,650
everything stopped, all of
a sudden, just like that,

769
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:57,028
real quiet for 50 years.

770
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:03,868
Then two weeks ago, a
tour group disappeared.

771
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,745
- Oh my God, I read about
that on the internet.

772
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:06,663
- Yeah.

773
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,875
Well, it's true, you know.

774
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,042
Something in the river.

775
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,087
Something big.

776
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,922
Something bad.

777
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,883
Something that likes to eat people.

778
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:21,137
- (scoffs) Are you on crack?

779
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:25,390
- Okay, my friends, on
your feet, everybody,

780
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,142
outside, let's move.

781
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:31,313
Ah, no, no, no, you,
lizard man, you can stay.

782
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,982
Come, let's go outside.

783
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,573
Come.

784
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:44,702
(suspenseful music)

785
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,092
All right, stop, that's far enough.

786
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:04,345
- You, hold this.

787
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:07,390
- What's going on?

788
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,060
- That's today's paper,
proves that we're still alive.

789
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,478
(man speaks Spanish)

790
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,730
- Everyone, on your knees, please.

791
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:17,860
(director groans)

792
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:22,238
(camera beeps)

793
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,117
- We have your people, if
you ever want to see them

794
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:28,328
alive again, you will deposit
$3 million into an account

795
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,872
which I shall name later.

796
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:35,127
If you do not comply, we
will mail you their heads,

797
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:40,340
one by one, you have 24
hours to think it over.

798
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,968
(camera beeps)

799
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:45,012
- All right, got it.

800
00:46:45,012 --> 00:46:48,265
(eerie music)

801
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:50,808
- Can't you see this man
needs medical attention?

802
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,063
- You should worry about yourself.

803
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,443
- Okay, people, on your feet.

804
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:02,988
(director groans)

805
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:03,822
Come on, move it.

806
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,367
Or maybe you want us to
shoot the other foot, yes?

807
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,285
- I have to pee.

808
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,747
- Miguel, watch these two.

809
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:13,165
You, come.

810
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,960
(eerie music)

811
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,265
Here you go.

812
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:33,018
Pick a bush, don't be shy.

813
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,645
- I don't really need to go.

814
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:37,813
- Oh really?

815
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,818
Then why don't you tell me
what it is that you do need?

816
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,988
- Your word that you
won't hurt anyone else.

817
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:48,492
- I could maybe do this
for you, but what are you

818
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:50,577
going to do for me in return?

819
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,295
- Okay, wait, slow down, okay? (pants)

820
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:03,673
- Sure, we can take our time, yes, mmm.

821
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:08,470
(man groans)

822
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,682
(dramatic music)

823
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:13,683
- Arturo, what happened?

824
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:17,353
- That loco chica, she was
playing kickball with my cojones.

825
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,815
- You want I should go after her?

826
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,775
- No, I want you to stand
here asking me questions.

827
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:23,693
Yes, go.

828
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,278
- Can I wear Pike's mask?

829
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,155
- I don't care if you wear
flip flops and a speedo.

830
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:28,073
Go get her!

831
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:30,908
- Ain't you coming?

832
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,955
- No, I'm gonna stay here
in case she doubles back.

833
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:40,043
Can't believe he's wearing that mask.

834
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,920
(dramatic music)

835
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:59,312
- Come back here, you little witch.

836
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:03,192
(Rose whimpers)

837
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:08,947
You're dead!

838
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,200
(dramatic music)

839
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,952
I know you're there.

840
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,872
(dramatic music)

841
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:30,427
(man growls)

842
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:32,803
(Rose sobs)

843
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:35,682
(dramatic music)

844
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,275
You're gonna die, girl,
you're gonna die! (growls)

845
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:48,153
(dramatic music)

846
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,368
Stop there!

847
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:01,458
I'll get you. (growls)

848
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:02,500
I got you.

849
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,962
(Rose pants)

850
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:13,887
(Rose yelps)

851
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,893
- So do you think they'll pay?

852
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:24,105
- Well, either they will or they won't.

853
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:26,273
- Wow, what keen insight.

854
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,567
You know, it's a good thing I plucked you

855
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,570
from that strip joint before
you rose to fame in Vegas.

856
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:32,988
My world would be at
such a loss without you.

857
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:34,992
Ow!

858
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,328
Anybody else had done that,
they'd have a hole right here.

859
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,207
- Yeah, well, your gun's
all the way over there.

860
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:45,043
(Pike chuckles)

861
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:49,798
(phone rings)

862
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:53,593
- What is it?

863
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:55,387
- Sorry, boss, I have some bad news.

864
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:56,555
- I hate bad news.

865
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,227
(ominous music)

866
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:12,945
(man pants)

867
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,865
- All right, time to die!

868
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:18,285
- You can't, the ransom, remember?

869
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:20,037
(creature growls)

870
00:51:20,037 --> 00:51:22,788
- You're just the script
girl, who's gonna miss you?

871
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:29,295
(creature growls)
(dramatic music)

872
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,465
(creature roars)

873
00:51:38,555 --> 00:51:40,348
- Dammit, Arturo, I can't
believe you let her get away.

874
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:41,933
Why didn't you go after her?

875
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:46,522
- You kidding me, go after
her, with that freak out there?

876
00:51:46,522 --> 00:51:47,397
- Help!

877
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:53,403
Help, oh my God, it's out
there, it's out there,

878
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:54,320
it ate him!

879
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,280
- We know, we know, get her
back in there with the others.

880
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:57,657
- He's dead!

881
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,577
(dramatic music)

882
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,258
- What is that place?
- Some kind of mill?

883
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,593
Been dead for a while by the looks of it.

884
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:21,138
You got binoculars?
- Yeah, yeah, here.

885
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,935
(ominous music)

886
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,312
(Jack sighs)

887
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,230
- They got Rose.

888
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,063
- Is she okay?

889
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:31,398
- She looks scared.

890
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:35,028
- What's the plan, Jack?

891
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,533
- I don't know.

892
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:41,827
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

893
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:42,785
- (scoffs) Well.

894
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:46,748
As long as I get to blow
some stuff up, I'm okay.

895
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,417
- I think we can work that out.

896
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,293
- Eh.

897
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,547
- Aw, come on.
(Rose grunts)

898
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:55,673
Thought you could swim
away, huh, little fishie?

899
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,510
(Rose whimpers)

900
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:03,055
Maybe next time I don't throw you back.

901
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,353
- Rose.

902
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,187
(Rose sobs)

903
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:10,605
Rose, are you with us, darling?

904
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:14,692
- He's telling the truth,
there's something out there

905
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,653
that's worse than those kidnappers.

906
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,155
- Well, what is it?

907
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:21,575
- I don't know. (sobs)

908
00:53:21,575 --> 00:53:26,120
It's like this giant snake,
but it's not a snake, man.

909
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:28,332
- It's an evolutionary line jumper.

910
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:30,042
- In layman's terms?

911
00:53:30,042 --> 00:53:32,585
- It's a random mutation of enormous size.

912
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:35,505
A hybrid with keen senses.

913
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:37,757
Put simply, it's probably
the most dangerous predator

914
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:41,427
ever known to mankind, I've
been hunting that damn thing

915
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,553
for 20 years.

916
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:45,557
I finally found it.

917
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:48,518
(Kimmy snorts)

918
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:50,437
- You guys are cuckoo for psycho puffs.

919
00:53:50,437 --> 00:53:52,272
If there was something out there,

920
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:54,607
it'd be on National Geographic or YouTube.

921
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,110
- Not if it evolved to avoid detection,

922
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,695
burrowing under the ground
and going into some sort

923
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:02,407
of state of hibernation, coming out

924
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:06,745
every once in a while to fill its belly.

925
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,915
- That's not all it does. (pants)

926
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,670
I fell into its nest of eggs.

927
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,423
(ominous music)

928
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,228
- Freeze right there.

929
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:33,563
- Please don't shoot.

930
00:54:33,563 --> 00:54:36,065
(man grunts)

931
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:38,652
Whoa.

932
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:41,988
- Here you go.

933
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:42,863
- No, I don't do guns.

934
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,407
Hey, you were a Marine, right?

935
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:45,325
- Right outta high school.

936
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:46,492
- Tell me you were some
kind of force recon

937
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,452
badass or something.

938
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,328
- No, motor pool badass.

939
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,247
- Motor pool.

940
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:52,332
- Ready to do this?
- Hell no.

941
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:53,667
Let's do it anyway.

942
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:56,543
(dramatic music)

943
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,882
(bomb beeps)

944
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,925
(gun fires)
(man grunts)

945
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,470
(dramatic music)

946
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:07,472
- What was that?

947
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:08,723
- Trouble, let's go.

948
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:12,560
(dramatic music)

949
00:55:15,022 --> 00:55:17,565
(bomb beeps)

950
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,193
(gun fires)

951
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,113
(dramatic music)

952
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:31,578
(bomb beeps)

953
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,038
- Hey there, you guys missed me?

954
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,957
- Jack, you're alive.

955
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,167
(bomb beeps)

956
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,087
(dramatic music)

957
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:40,880
- Who's this guy?

958
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:44,008
- We'll explain later, let's
get outta here, thanks.

959
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,887
(dramatic music)

960
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,397
- I'm so happy to see you.

961
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:59,065
I thought it got you.

962
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,650
- Thought what got me?

963
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,027
(guns fire)
(all gasp)

964
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:03,152
Come on, this way.

965
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,030
(dramatic music)

966
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:13,287
Okay, we're gonna head
for those SUVs out there.

967
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:15,123
You know how to use this?

968
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:18,333
- Yeah, learned that on the
set of Die, Charlie, Die,

969
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,210
but I should have the machine gun.

970
00:56:19,252 --> 00:56:20,420
That's 50 yards of open ground out there.

971
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,338
You'll never make it alive,

972
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:23,798
not without someone covering you.

973
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,675
- No, Milo, we're not leaving you.

974
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:28,177
- And I can't make that
run, so either we all

975
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,180
stay here and die together
or I give the rest of you

976
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,555
a fighting chance.

977
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,433
- A good thought.

978
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:34,808
- What do you think?

979
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,478
(eerie music)

980
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,608
- Good luck, let's go.

981
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:51,325
- And now here's something
the whole family can enjoy.

982
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:54,245
(dramatic music)

983
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:01,377
(guns fire)

984
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,025
- Almost got it.

985
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,653
- Almost isn't good enough, we gotta go.

986
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:28,947
- Get the hell outta here!

987
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:34,160
(guns fire)
(creature snarls)

988
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,247
(creature roars)

989
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:38,790
- We gotta bigger problem.

990
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,583
(guns fire)

991
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,793
- Oh!

992
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:45,255
(guns fire)

993
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,008
I've got this.

994
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,220
(guns fire)

995
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,805

996
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:57,725
(dramatic music)

997
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:00,018
- No!

998
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,147
(Kimmy screams)

999
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:04,940

(Kimmy screams)

1001
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:12,115
- Gunner!

1002
00:58:12,115 --> 00:58:15,660
(dramatic music)

1003
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,622

1004
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,290
(jazzy music)

1005
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:25,002
- On it, no more, what happened to Gunner?

1006
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:28,463
(rock music)

1007
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:30,925
- He's gone, Rose, he's gone.

1008
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:37,182

1020

It's really real.

1021
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,967

- Be quiet.

1051
01:00:30,378 --> 01:00:32,297
- I won't get to be on Oprah.

1052

you, thank you, thank you.

1068
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:45,118
- We're almost on empty.

1070
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,842
A bullet must've hit the
gas tank, we got lucky.

01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,803
- Excuse me, how is this possibly lucky?

1072
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,763
- Because we didn't die
in a fiery explosion.

1073
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:06,890
We're too exposed on this road.

1074
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,602
- I think there's a marina
out there in the jungle.

1075
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:11,812
Maybe we can get a boat.

1076
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,565
- From here, I'm not sure.

1077
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:17,568
If we follow the river
south, maybe we'll find it.

1078
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:18,987
- Aren't we forgetting something?

1079
01:02:18,987 --> 01:02:21,447
This isn't chicken yolk,
all right, that thing

1080
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,865
is laying eggs out there.

1081
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:25,452
- This day just keeps
getting better and better.

1082
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:27,412
- What's wrong?

1083
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:32,208
- (laughs) Think back to your
sex ed classes, Ms. Weston.

1084
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,460
Takes two to make an egg.

1085
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,878
- There could be another one.

1086
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:37,505
- It doesn't matter, if
we stay on this road,

1087
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:39,590
those kidnappers are
gonna find us for sure.

1088
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,675
We gotta risk it.

1089
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:43,260
(eerie music)

1090
01:02:53,897 --> 01:02:54,897
- So what happened?

1091
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:58,943
- (sighs) The monster's dead,
and so is this crap machine.

1092
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:02,070
- You sure that thing is
dead, because I watched

1093
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,615
about 10,000 rounds bounce off its hide

1094
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:09,537
like they were freaking tic-tacs.

1095
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,872
Okay, good, so now what?

1096
01:03:13,082 --> 01:03:14,292
- So now we go after 'em.

1097
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:20,923
- Listen, Pike, I think maybe
we've gone far enough, yeah?

1098
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:24,843
It's just time to let it go.

1099
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:26,762
- Talia died screaming.

1100
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,598
We're not gonna rest
until they're all dead.

1101
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:37,690
(Arturo speaks Spanish)

1102
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:42,445
(director groans)

1103
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:45,030
(eerie music)

1104
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:12,392
(director grunts)

1105
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,645
(phone beeps)

1106
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,150
(phone rings)

1107
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:26,363
(ringtone plays)
(creature snarls)

1108
01:04:30,827 --> 01:04:32,412
- [Voicemail] Hi, Rick here, I'm in Hawaii

1109
01:04:32,412 --> 01:04:35,413
for the next week enjoying
the wildlife, leave a message.

1110
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:42,128
(phone beeps)
(Jamie scoffs)

1111
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,047
- Hey, lady?

1112
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,175
- Jeeze, what happened to you?

1113
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:50,972
- Oh, not much, I hurt my foot,
do you have a car somewhere?

1114
01:04:50,972 --> 01:04:53,015
- Do I look like I have a freaking car?

1115
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:54,975
- What's wrong?

1116
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:58,812
- (sobs) My boyfriend,
he dragged me out here

1117
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,523
to this beach because he
said it was gonna be romantic

1118
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,775
and then (sobs) he just disappeared

1119
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:08,572
and I don't know, maybe the
jungle swallowed him up or--

1120
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:15,997
- No, lady, you don't
understand, it's not the jungle.

1121
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:17,832
- What are you talking about?

1122
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:21,877
- There's a creature out
there, like a huge snake

1123
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,045
or something, I don't know, all I know

1124
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,338
is that it hunts people.

1125
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:28,675
- Um, Mister, um...

1126
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,387
I think you need some help.

1127
01:05:32,472 --> 01:05:34,390
- No, no, we both need help, listen to me.

1128
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,850
- No, Rick, Rick?

1129
01:05:39,187 --> 01:05:40,145
Rick, Rick!

1130
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:43,898
- This is why I don't get married.

1131
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,443
- Rick, where are you, honey?

1132
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,405
(director groans)

1133
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,407
Rick, Rick?

1134
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:55,327
Honey, come on.

1135
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:57,455
Rick, Rick?

1136
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:03,335
(director groans)

1137
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:06,422
(unsettling music)

1138
01:06:21,353 --> 01:06:22,855
- I could really use a drink.

1139
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:27,610
- It's over here.

1140
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:34,908
Fresh water.

1141
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,537
- Thank you.

1142
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,958
- It's good, huh?

1143
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:46,587
- (sighs) It's good.

1144
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,215
- Everything got so
crazy, I didn't tell you

1145
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:52,385
I'm sorry about Gunner, he was a good guy.

1146
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:54,178
- Yeah, he was a good guy.

1147
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,890
You got yolk all over your shirt.

1148
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:03,187
- It's sticky, I can't get it off.

1149
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:05,355
- Take this, okay?

1150
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:08,983
(romantic music)

1151
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,445
(Rose grunts)

1152
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,613
- Why are you smiling?

1153
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:14,948
- I got you out of your
top and it's not even

1154
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:15,867
our second date.

1155
01:07:15,867 --> 01:07:19,078
- Oh, really, you think you're
gonna get a second date?

1156
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:20,747
- I like my chances.

1157
01:07:20,747 --> 01:07:23,373
- Get us outta here alive and we'll talk.

1158
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,837
(Jack chuckles)

1159
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:31,548
(director grunts)

1160
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:34,135
(eerie music)

1161
01:07:47,607 --> 01:07:50,483
(dramatic music)

1162
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:52,778
- Mmm.

1163
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:59,075
(director coughs)

1164
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:04,665
- Oh, you're on the hate list.

1165
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:10,420
- Oh my gosh, what is all this? (grunts)

1166
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:13,215
(ominous music)

1167
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:23,350
- Lady.
(Jamie gasps)

1168
01:08:23,392 --> 01:08:24,602
- Stay away from me.

1169
01:08:24,602 --> 01:08:26,978
- No, you don't understand, you and I

1170
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,065
are in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1171
01:08:30,983 --> 01:08:31,942
- You're crazy.

1172
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:36,447
- No, that creature I told
you about, this is its nest!

1173
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:39,200
(ominous music)

1174
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:43,953
- You mean--

1175
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:44,830
- Yeah, I mean.

1176
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:47,833
(Jamie gasps)

1177
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,293
- What are you doing?

1178
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:50,335
(Jamie screams)

1179
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:53,297
Lady, stop it, let's just get outta here!

1180
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:56,008
(Jamie grunts)

1181
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,635
(creature snarls)

1182
01:08:58,677 --> 01:09:03,890
(dramatic music)
(Jamie screams)

1183
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,018
(creature roars)

1184
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:14,735
(Jamie screams)

1185
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:17,655
(creature growls)

1186
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:25,703
(Jamie screams)
(creature snarls)

1187
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,460
- God, there really is another
one out there, isn't there?

1188
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,587
- It sounds close.

1189
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,257
- Yeah, a little too close.

1190
01:09:36,257 --> 01:09:37,257
(gun cocks)

1191
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,050
Let's keep going.

1192
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:44,932
(ominous music)

1193
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:54,065
- You can drink when they're all dead

1194
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,902
and not a second before.
- Sorry.

1195
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:02,700
(creature snarls in the distance)

1196
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,493
(ominous music)

1197
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:19,048
- The hell is this?

1198
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,258
- If I live through this, I'm making up

1199
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,718
for every bad thing I've ever done.

1200
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,512
- That's a whole lot, isn't it, hon?

1201
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,430
- Bitch.

1202
01:10:26,932 --> 01:10:27,975
- Wait, what's this?

1203
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,020
- That's mine, that's what it is.

1204
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,272
- No, this is the egg I saw in the jungle.

1205
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:36,067
- When we escaped from those kidnappers,

1206
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:37,442
that thing went after us.

1207
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,027
Lots of easy prey around and it went after

1208
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,612
a speeding SUV?

1209
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,030
- What are you suggesting?

1210
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:46,285
- It wasn't going after us,
it was going after this.

1211
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:48,412
- You said yourself it
has hyper acute senses.

1212
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,622
It was tracking us because of this egg.

1213
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,207
- What are you gonna do, kill it?

1214
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,168
They're a species unknown to mankind.

1215
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,045
Needs to be studied, Jack.

1216
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:58,338
- You put all of our lives at risk

1217
01:10:58,338 --> 01:10:59,423
by bringing this along.

1218
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:00,298
- I guess I did.

1219
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:03,677
- We're not bringing it
back to civilization.

1220
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:05,887
You get in the boat with Kim,
you go back to the docks,

1221
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,180
bring the authorities.

1222
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:08,557
- Where are you going, Jack?

1223
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,102
- The movie vans are close.

1224
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,812
Some of Gunner's pyrotechnics are inside.

1225
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:16,357
Get back in the boat with
Kimmy, go to the docks,

1226
01:11:16,357 --> 01:11:17,190
get the authorities.

1227
01:11:17,232 --> 01:11:20,277
- No, I'm staying with
you, you need my help.

1228
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,195
- Fine.

1229
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,907
- This I gotta see. (chuckles)

1230
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:26,658
- Hey, where are you guys going?

1231
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:30,703
Hello, did anyone bring any sunscreen?

1232
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:34,792
No, are we still going on the boat?

1233
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,630
Why is professor creepy taking
notes like we're some kind

1234
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,465
of lab animals? (sighs)

1235
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:43,967
(bass music)

1236
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:50,140
- I don't trust him.

1237
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,017
- No, me neither.

1238
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:54,645
He might come in handy, though.

1239
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:59,608
- Your trap, it reminds me of something.

1240
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:00,317
- You don't remember?

1241
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:02,152
- It's been a long day, Jack.

1242
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,363
- I got the idea from the
Head Chopper two script,

1243
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:06,532
after our killer eviscerates
the motocross rider.

1244
01:12:06,532 --> 01:12:09,410
- Right, right, Kimmy uses
the head chopper's childhood

1245
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:10,618
teddy bear--

1246
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:15,582
- And lures him into a
fireworks factor, and boom,

1247
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:16,958
big old Hollywood explosion.

1248
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,002
- Sounds dicey.

1249
01:12:18,002 --> 01:12:20,337
- Well, it is dicey, worked in the movie.

1250
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:21,463
- Doesn't mean it's gonna work here.

1251
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:25,133
- In case you haven't noticed,
we're running outta options.

1252
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:27,803
- You could've gone for
help, but you didn't.

1253
01:12:27,803 --> 01:12:29,555
You came back and searched for us.

1254
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:32,933
- There's no way I was
gonna leave you behind.

1255
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,768
Couldn't let anything happen to you.

1256
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,063
- Thank you for saving me.

1257
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,108
- Well, that's how I roll, baby.

1258
01:12:41,108 --> 01:12:42,358
(both laugh)

1259
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,777
(gun fires)
(Jack groans)

1260
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:46,238
(Kimmy screams)

1261
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:47,280
- Run, run!

1262
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:49,700
- Yeah, that's it, run, that
way it'll be more like sport.

1263
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:54,830
- You kill them, you can
say goodbye to your ransom.

1264
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:56,957
- This isn't about money anymore.

1265
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:59,125
That thing killed the
only woman I ever loved

1266
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,668
and you brought it on.

1267
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,257
This won't make us even,
but it'll be a start.

1268
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,133
(creature snarls in distance)

1269
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:07,008
- Wait.

1270
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:09,637
Did you hear that?

1271
01:13:12,932 --> 01:13:14,223
- Hear what?

1272
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,185
- Listen, man, I can kill that thing.

1273
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:19,228
I got a detonator in
here and I can kill it.

1274
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,855
- Maybe it can't hear us.

1275
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,565
- It doesn't need to hear us.

1276
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:29,155
(Kimmy whimpers)

1277
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:30,907
- Guess it was nothing.

1278
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:34,118
(dramatic music)

1279
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,538
(creature growls)

1280
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:38,832
(guns fire)

1281
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:40,333
(girls scream)

1282
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:43,878
(guns fire)

1283
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,303
- Go!
- Jack!

1284
01:13:51,303 --> 01:13:52,303
(creature growls)

1285
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,680
- Get him outta here, I'm
gonna go get the detonator.

1286
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:54,598
- No, Kimmy, I will do that.

1287
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:56,392
- Just shut up, let me do
something good for once!

1288
01:13:56,392 --> 01:14:00,103
(dramatic music)

1289
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:03,065
(creature growls)

1290
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:07,987
(Kimmy whimpers)

1291
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,825
(creature growls)

1292
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:20,623
(creature roars)

1293
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:24,670
(gun fires)

1294
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:26,087
- I'll see you in hell, baby.

1295
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,423
(creature growls)

1296
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:31,302
(dramatic music)

1297
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:37,682
(creature snarls)
- Oh my God. (sobs)

1298
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,355
(Kimmy screams)

1299
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:47,275
(gun fires)

1300
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:50,112
(Kimmy screams)

1301
01:14:51,905 --> 01:14:53,323
- Kimmy!

1302
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:54,950
- She's gone.

1303
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:57,160
- What's this, kitty spit up a hairball?

1304
01:14:57,202 --> 01:14:59,203
- Jack, what are you doing, he's dead.

1305
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:03,750
- That's right, that's why
he's not gonna need this.

1306
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:07,545
(dramatic music)

1307
01:15:11,633 --> 01:15:15,845
- Rose, Rose.
(Rose whimpers)

1308
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:17,180
I want you to get to the
docks, I'm telling you,

1309
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:19,850
you get on the boat and you
get the hell outta here.

1310
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:20,892
- What about you?

1311
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,978
- Gunner's explosives were all set.

1312
01:15:22,978 --> 01:15:25,105
I can still kill that thing.

1313
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:25,980
- The detonator's gone.

1314
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,690
- I got my detonator right here.

1315
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,652
If it doesn't work, I'll get on that ATV

1316
01:15:29,652 --> 01:15:31,403
and I will hightail it outta here.

1317
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:33,405
- You've been shot, Jack.

1318
01:15:33,405 --> 01:15:34,280
- It's nothing.

1319
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:36,283
- Please don't die?

1320
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,662
- I'm a stunt man.

1321
01:15:39,662 --> 01:15:41,203
This is what I do.

1322
01:15:42,957 --> 01:15:44,833
I'll be fine.

1323
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:47,585
(ominous music)

1324
01:16:15,322 --> 01:16:18,033
(engine revs)

1325
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:20,410
(Rose pants)

1326
01:16:20,452 --> 01:16:25,665
- Wait, wait! (sobs)

1327
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:28,293
Kimmy didn't make it, Jack stayed behind

1328
01:16:28,293 --> 01:16:29,837
to finish this thing.

1329
01:16:29,837 --> 01:16:34,340
(monster snarls in distance)

1330
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:36,050
- Sounds like he didn't make it.

1331
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:38,262
Time for an exit.

1332
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:42,432
(dramatic music)

1333
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:17,800
- Oh jeeze.

1334
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:20,178
Well, well, well, this will come in handy.

1335
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,015
So will that.

1336
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:27,018
(dramatic music)

1337
01:17:44,745 --> 01:17:46,372
- [Professor] Hold on tight,
princess, you never know

1338
01:17:46,372 --> 01:17:47,788
what we might bump into.

1339
01:17:52,627 --> 01:17:55,213
- [Rose] I don't see it!

1340
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:57,965
- [Professor] I can feel it, it's near.

1341
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,635
(eerie music)

1342
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,977
It knows we're here.
- How would you know?

1343
01:18:09,895 --> 01:18:11,772
- [Professor] I have a
feeling they developed a taste

1344
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:15,275
for slow moving, halfwit
humans who stuff their face

1345
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:16,150
with fast food.

1346
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:19,988
(dramatic music)

1347
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,910
(creature snarls)

1348
01:18:34,962 --> 01:18:37,755
- I don't understand,
why is it following us?

1349
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:39,590
- I don't know.

1350
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:43,095
It's never been spotted this
far down the river before.

1351
01:18:43,095 --> 01:18:44,847
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.

1352
01:18:50,352 --> 01:18:51,937
- What about this?

1353
01:18:51,937 --> 01:18:54,230
- Give me that.
- No!

1354
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:55,857
- Give it to me!

1355
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,108
(Rose grunts)

1356
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:59,360
Hey, hey, gimme that, hey!

1357
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,408
- Jack could've stopped it.

1358
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:06,868
- There are six billion homo sapiens

1359
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:08,203
running around on the planet.

1360
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:11,163
Biologically speaking we
are a cheap commodity.

1361
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:13,208
That's a priceless evolutionary wonder,

1362
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:16,002
the discovery of which will
probably go down in history.

1363
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:17,878
You can count on that.

1364
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,090
My father taught me to
succeed at any price.

1365
01:19:22,342 --> 01:19:25,095
- You're crazy, it killed your father!

1366
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:29,808
(creature snarls)

1367
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:31,477
- Give me that!
- No!

1368
01:19:31,477 --> 01:19:32,477
- I said give it to me.

1369
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:35,105
(Rose grunts)

1370
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:42,070
This is gonna make me one
hell of an omelet. (laughs)

1371
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,613
(dramatic music)

1372
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:47,242
(Rose grunts)

1373
01:19:50,495 --> 01:19:53,665
You know what, this
isn't over, little bitch.

1374
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:58,670
(eerie music)

1375
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:28,032
There it is.

1376
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:30,285
- You bastard.
(professor shouts)

1377
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:33,580
(dramatic music)

1378
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,455
No!

1379
01:20:35,707 --> 01:20:38,585
(dramatic music)

1380
01:20:40,337 --> 01:20:43,005
- [Professor] Hey, hey!

1381
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:48,262
(dramatic music)
(creature growls)

1382
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:51,890
Hey!

1383
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,062
(creature growls)

1384
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,398
(professor screams)

1385
01:21:00,398 --> 01:21:03,277
(dramatic music)

1386
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,128
- [Jack] Rose!

1387
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:26,633
(Rose grunts)

1388
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:27,633
- Jack!

1389
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,635
It was him, it's him.

1390
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:31,220
- What, where's Lovegrove?

1391
01:21:31,262 --> 01:21:33,265
- He's dead, it's following me.

1392
01:21:33,265 --> 01:21:36,558
- Okay, quick, get on, get on, get on!

1393
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:40,897
Let's get rid of these
things once and for all.

1394
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:43,023
The only way is to get the mama.

1395
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,442
- Yeah, punch it!

1396
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,362
(dramatic music)

1397
01:22:26,652 --> 01:22:28,110
- [Jack] Hang on.

1398
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:35,160
- Did we lose it?

1399
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,830
- Well done, come on, the
falls are this way, come on.

1400
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:44,835
Okay, come on, come on, be
careful, watch your feet.

1401
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:47,547
That slimy snake is down there somewhere.

1402
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:50,133
When she senses her baby
is close, she'll come.

1403
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:52,593
They got a sixth sense for their eggs.

1404
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,803
Come on, show your ugly face.

1405
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:58,057
- (pants) Where is it?

1406
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:03,312
(creature growls)
(ominous music)

1407
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:06,482
- Take this.

1408
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,570
(creature growls)

1409
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:15,950
That's it, keep coming, keep coming.

1410
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:19,412
This is what you want.

1411
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,083
Catch this, you ugly bitch.

1412
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,293
(creature snarls)

1413
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:29,172
(dramatic music)

1414
01:23:30,257 --> 01:23:31,173
- When do we hit the detonator?

1415
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:33,092
- Just before we hit the water.

1416
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,427
- What, oh God!

1417
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:37,972
(bomb explodes)

1418
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,850
(dramatic music)

1419
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:57,117
(Jack laughs)

1420
01:23:57,117 --> 01:24:00,162
Don't you ever do that to me again!

1421
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:03,957
