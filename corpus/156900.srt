Good morning, Logan.

175
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,547
I'd like your definitions of weak
and strong anthropic principles...

176
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,609
on my desk
on Wednesday.

177
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:05,621
That'll be all.

178
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:14,326
- Bye, Professor.
- Bye, Kitty.

00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:23,768
I'm Charles Xavier.
Would you like some breakfast ?

181
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:28,107
- Where am I ?
- Westchester, New York.

182
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:32,342
You were attacked. My people
brought you here for medical attention.

183
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,613
- I don't need medical attention.
- Yes, of course.

184
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,681
- Where's the girl ?
- Rogue ? She's here. She's fine.

185
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:43,453
Really.

186
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:49,397
Ah, Logan, I'd like you to meet
Ororo Monroe, also called Storm.

187
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,629
- This is Scott Summers,

- Hello.

I believe you've already
met Dr.Jean Grey.

You're in my school for the gifted.
For mutants.

191
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:09,241
- You'll be safe here from Magneto.
- What's a Magneto ?

192
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,982

I've been following

The man who attacked you is an associate
of his called Sabretooth.

Hey, no powers!

To the public, we're merely
a school for gifted youngsters.

216
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:35,179
Cyclops, Storm andJean
were some of my first students.

217
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:39,520
I protected them, taught them
to control their powers...

218
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:43,857
and in time,
teach others to do the same.

219
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,954
The students
are mostly runaways.

220
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,056
Frightened, alone.

00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,761
Some with gifts so extreme
that they've become a danger...

222
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,100
to themselves
and those around them.

223
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,662
Like your friend, Rogue.

Incapable of physical human contact,
probably for the rest of her life,

with others her own age,

up to her. Rejoin the world
as an educated young woman...

or stay on

have affectionately called X-Men.

But the school is merely a public face.

The lower levels, however, are
an entirely different matter.

236
00:28:55,701 --> 00:29:00,400

the power to control people's minds,

237

make them think or do
whatever I wanted.

238
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:07,639
When I was 1 7,
I met a young man named Eric Lensherr.

239
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,943
He, too, had
an unusual power.

240
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:14,042
He could create magnetic fields
and control metal.

Believing that humanity
would never accept us,

242
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:19,552
he grew angry and vengeful.

243
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,826
He became Magneto.

244
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:28,126
There are mutants out there
with incredible powers, Logan,

my respect for mankind.

you could use that to your advantage.

which enables him

Are you a God-fearing

That's such
a strange phrase.

303
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,574
I've always thought
of God as a teacher,

- Nowhere near that powerful.

01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:07,351
- Trust me.
- You drop something ?

682
01:24:11,901 --> 01:24:14,028
Now.

683
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:30,245
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

684
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:34,346
We gotta get her out of there.
Cyclops, can you hit it ?

685
01:24:34,423 --> 01:24:37,586
-[ Cyclops ] The rings are
too fast. I'll kill her.
-[ Logan ] Just shoot it.

686
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,992
- Storm, can you get me up there ?
- I can't control it like that.

687
01:24:40,062 --> 01:24:42,929
- You could fly right over the torch.
- Then let me go.

688
01:24:42,998 --> 01:24:47,367
If I don't make it, then at least
you can still blast the damn thing.

689
01:24:48,604 --> 01:24:50,868
All right, do it.

690
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,408
Jean, use your power.
Try to steady him.

691
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:57,074
Hang on to something.

692
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:52,926
Scott, wait.

693
01:26:23,565 --> 01:26:25,965
- I have to.
-Just wait.

694
01:26:27,836 --> 01:26:30,430
I have a shot.

695
01:26:30,506 --> 01:26:32,371
I'm taking it.

696
01:27:12,268 --> 01:27:14,202
Come on.

697
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,924
Hey, this one's alive.
Let's get him out of here.

698
01:29:14,023 --> 01:29:15,957
Welcome back.

699
01:29:16,025 --> 01:29:19,085
I knew you'd find
your way.

700
01:29:19,161 --> 01:29:21,254
I had you to guide me.

701
01:29:23,499 --> 01:29:25,558
How did we do ?

702
01:29:53,028 --> 01:29:55,758
Oh !
Oh, that tickles.

703
01:29:56,932 --> 01:29:58,866
Hey.

704
01:30:00,336 --> 01:30:02,270
Hey.

705
01:30:02,338 --> 01:30:05,603
- How're you feeling ?
- Fantastic.

706
01:30:07,676 --> 01:30:10,042
That was
a brave thing you did.

707
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:15,042
- Did it work ?
- Yeah. She's fine.

708
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,950
She took on a few of your more
charming personality traits for a while.

709
01:30:20,022 --> 01:30:23,617
- [ Chuckles, Coughing ]
- But we lived through it.

710
01:30:27,096 --> 01:30:30,031
I think she's
a little taken with you.

711
01:30:30,099 --> 01:30:34,502
Well, you can tell her
my heart belongs to someone else.

712
01:30:38,907 --> 01:30:42,741
- You know, you and I--
- How's the professor ?

713
01:30:45,547 --> 01:30:48,516
- He's good.
- Good.

714
01:30:54,723 --> 01:30:58,989
There's an abandoned military compound
at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies,

715
01:30:59,061 --> 01:31:00,995
close to where
we found you.

716
01:31:01,063 --> 01:31:05,432
There's not much left,
but you might find some answers.

717
01:31:07,936 --> 01:31:11,138
- Thank you.
- Are you going
to say good-bye to them ?

718
01:31:13,941 --> 01:31:18,037
[ Man On TV] The Mutant Registration
Act lost its main proponent today...

719
01:31:18,112 --> 01:31:20,842
with the dramatic reversal
of Senator Robert Kelly,

720
01:31:20,915 --> 01:31:25,375
who until this time
had provided the loudest voice
in the cry for mutant registration.

721
01:31:25,453 --> 01:31:27,444
I was wrong
on this particular issue.

722
01:31:27,521 --> 01:31:30,888
And I hope in time I may be forgiven.
Thank you.

723
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:35,588
- The Mutant Registration Act
continues to draw support...
-[ Storm ] Mystique.

724
01:31:37,932 --> 01:31:41,231
[ Cyclops ]
Son of a bitch.

725
01:31:41,302 --> 01:31:43,270
from many
Parents Rights groups...

726
01:31:43,337 --> 01:31:47,068
who feel threatened by unidentified
mutants in their school systems.

727
01:31:47,141 --> 01:31:49,769
In a related story,

728
01:31:49,844 --> 01:31:54,281
the body of Senator Kelly's longtime
aide, Henry Guyrich, was found today.

729
01:31:54,348 --> 01:31:59,615
Preliminary coroner reports
seem to indicate that Guyrich
was mauled by a bear.

730
01:31:59,687 --> 01:32:01,416
[ Rogue ]
Hey.

731
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:09,318
- You running again ?
- No, not really.

732
01:32:10,998 --> 01:32:14,126
I have some things
to take care of up north.

733
01:32:19,607 --> 01:32:21,768
I kind of like it.

734
01:32:24,945 --> 01:32:28,403
- I don't want you to go.
- [ Sniffles ]

735
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:42,919
I'll be back for this.

736
01:33:22,036 --> 01:33:24,561
Doesn't it ever wake you
in the middle of the night ?

737
01:33:24,638 --> 01:33:27,505
The feeling that someday
they will pass that foolish law...

738
01:33:27,575 --> 01:33:31,909
or one just like it
and come for you...

739
01:33:31,979 --> 01:33:34,846
and your children ?

740
01:33:37,084 --> 01:33:39,348
It does, indeed.

741
01:33:44,658 --> 01:33:47,684
What do you do when
you wake up to that ?

742
01:33:47,761 --> 01:33:50,924
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...

743
01:33:50,998 --> 01:33:54,661
who comes to that school
looking for trouble.

744
01:34:02,743 --> 01:34:05,371
Why do you come here,
Charles ?

745
01:34:05,446 --> 01:34:08,438
Why do you ask questions
to which you already know the answers ?

746
01:34:08,515 --> 01:34:10,949
Oh, yes.

747
01:34:11,018 --> 01:34:13,418
Your continuing search
for hope.

748
01:34:24,465 --> 01:34:28,765
You know this plastic prison of theirs
won't hold me forever.

749
01:34:28,836 --> 01:34:33,398
The war is still coming,
Charles, and I intend to fight it...

750
01:34:33,474 --> 01:34:35,442
by any means necessary.

751
01:34:37,278 --> 01:34:40,770
And I will always
be there,

752
01:34:40,848 --> 01:34:42,782
old friend.
