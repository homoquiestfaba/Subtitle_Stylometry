1
00:01:47,708 --> 00:02:04,262
THE WAY BACK

2
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:32,684
[speaking Russian]

3
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:48,650
[sobbing]

4
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,505
[door opeans]

5
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:32,759
[door closes]

6
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:39,825
[man shouts in Russian]

7
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,452
[men respond in Russian]

8
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,461
[man speaks Russian]

9
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:16,816
[in Russian]

10
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,831
[Russian chatter]

11
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:14,087
[speaking Russian]

12
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:30,975
(male prisoner)
Look at those poor men.

13
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,559
They've got night blindness.

14
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,645
I saw it in the transit camp.

15
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:37,651
It's vitamin deficiency from starvation.

16
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,749
[groan]

17
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:01,755
[whimpering]

18
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,681
Here, here.

19
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:05,633
[gasping]

20
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,141
You planning on surviving
on half rations, son?

21
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:09,266
Look, he's an old man.

22
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:10,893
I'm an old man.

23
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:13,441
I'll be alive in the morning.
He won't.

24
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,527
Kindness.

25
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:21,404
That can kill you here.

26
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:26,616
He's American.

27
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,292
In Here? How?

28
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:33,290
Stalin hates foreigners,

29
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:35,838
and that includes Poles.

30
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:37,503
You're Polish, no?

31
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,670
Uh-huh.

32
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,634
I like you Poles.

33
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:43,464
Your burning sense of injustice,

34
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:46,140
the yearning for freedom.

35
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:49,640
Khabarov-- Andrei Timofeyevich.

36
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,847
Weiszczek-- Janusz.

37
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,691
Your charge, may I ask, Janusz?

38
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:59,238
58-10.

39
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:01,030
A spy.

40
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:03,028
That's what they told me.

41
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,529
Ten years?

42
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,577
No. 20.

43
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:09,702
58-14. Sabotage. Ten years.

44
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:12,034
And you were on Soviet side of line,

45
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,710
and they arrest you.
They accuse you of spying.

46
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:17,171
Torture you, huh?

47
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:18,714
Did you sign confession?

48
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,208
No.

49
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:22,919
No, I wouldn't sign,

50
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:26,256
so they--they tortured someone else.

51
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:30,060
Forgive me.

52
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:32,224
I was actor.

53
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:33,768
Moving pictures.

54
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:38,522
In my last picture,
I played aristocrat.

55
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:40,854
They arrested me when the film
was released.

56
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:42,405
Why?

57
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,198
it was claimed

58
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:49,746
I was elevating the status
of the old nobility.

59
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,291
So you got ten years
for a performance in a film.

60
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:55,790
I've had better notices.

61
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:01,799
[speaking Russian]

62
00:10:10,562 --> 00:10:11,927
Nyet.

63
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:22,604
The Urki.

64
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:25,441
Do you know who these are?

65
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:28,117
Professional criminals.

66
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:30,445
Murderers and thieves.

67
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,451
Don't stare at them.

68
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,954
The guards let them run things in here,

69
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:36,580
and they are to be feared.

70
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,411
Then why would they
let them run things?

71
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,498
Because they are byproduct of
bourgeois society

72
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:43,584
and so friends of people.

73
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:49,799
We are political prisoners and
so enemies of people.

74
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:53,351
The Soviet Union
has become one vast prison.

75
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:55,429
Slave labor.

76
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:58,640
They are from far reaches of
Soviet Empire,

77
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:03,024
all caught up in same net.

78
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:06,277
And, uh, do any of them
wriggle out of the net?

79
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,406
No, Janusz. You must be more careful.

80
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,700
Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere,

81
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,285
even in here.

82
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,291
If you are not more careful,

83
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,543
you will die after one year.

84
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,216
If not literally,

85
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:31,306
then spirit.

86
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:35,055
And how long have you been in here?

87
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:38,889
Eleven months and 29 days.

88
00:11:38,983 --> 00:11:40,314
[speaking Russian]

89
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,204
[inmates laugh]

90
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:16,096
[man shouting in distance]

91
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:53,383
[man shouting in Russian]

92
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:04,117
[chatter]

93
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:17,510
You do for me.

94
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,215
You want me to draw you?

95
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,392
No. Not me.

96
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,612
[distant voice speaking Russian]

97
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:38,426
Lice?

98
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,254
Eating me alive.

99
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:43,258
For that I have old folk remedy. Come.

100
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:47,728
[explosion in distance]

101
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,640
The mine.

102
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:52,691
They blast at night.

103
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:56,104
What are you doing?

104
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:59,448
We must be quick.

105
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:01,947
Or this will not be
here in the morning.

106
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,370
You're going to
leave it here overnight? Why?

107
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:07,031
You'll see.

108
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:27,973
It can be done.

109
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:29,679
I know a way through the wire.

110
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,139
How?

111
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:33,099
Lazar, my associate,

112
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:35,185
he is overseer of construction.

113
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,486
He showed me.

114
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:40,315
If you ever escape the camps,

115
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:43,443
and I've been waiting
so long for someone like you,

116
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,620
someone with the strength,

117
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,822
the will to see it through.

118
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,828
But to go where?

119
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,001
I mean, we can't go west.

120
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:54,791
I mean, apart from the Germans,
there's the Soviets.

121
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:58,374
And east,
all Soviet right to the Pacific.

122
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,005
No, no, no, no.

123
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:01,673
North. Have to be-- have to be south.

124
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:03,470
Correct.

125
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:06,174
But do you know where we are?
I mean, exactly?

126
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:13,102
I beileve we are about 500 kilometers
north of Lake Baikal.

127
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:15,353
This is the lake.

128
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:16,854
Camp is here.

129
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:18,694
And the border is here.

130
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:20,859
We could follow the edge
of the lake here.

131
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,736
That runs due south.

132
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:25,193
Exactly. Then we cross the
Trans-Siberian Railway

133
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:28,826
to the Mongolian border and freedom.

134
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,577
Spring is already upon us.

135
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:32,249
We will have to wait till autumn.

136
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:33,542
No. Why wait?

137
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:35,582
Why?

138
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:38,380
Because it is a thousand kilometers
to the border, maybe more.

139
00:17:38,384 --> 00:17:42,002
We need careful planning.
We need to stockpile food.

140
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:44,587
I've already begun trading, dealing.

141
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,422
You must do the same.

142
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:49,224
And in autumn,
the weather is more predictable.

143
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:50,893
[chatter in distance]

144
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:57,191
We can use the new snow
to cover our tracks.

145
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:59,610
And we bring my friends.

146
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:01,562
Your friends? You trust them?

147
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,189
Of course.

148
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:06,071
They won't all survive.

149
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:08,153
But they will die free men.

150
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,706
Free.

151
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:15,873
[clanging]

152
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:25,882
[man speaking Russian]

153
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:41,689
That's a really brave man!

154
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,476
First we need big branches!

155
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,521
One on each side
and then one on the back!

156
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,816
Help me, Kazik.

157
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:32,740
These down there,
put it there on the branch.

158
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,317
Yes, yes.

159
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:35,902
Follow me. We'll both go like this.

160
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:37,031
What?

161
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:38,408
Good.

162
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,451
Yes.Put it there.

163
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,171
Zoran! Your blanket!

164
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:50,671
For a wind break.

165
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:53,468
Get in. Come on.

166
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:55,046
Come!

167
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:57,507
Please come with us! We have shelter!

168
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:15,821
I am Zoran, Yugoslav. That's Janusz.

169
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:17,534
And he's Kazik.

170
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:18,610
Horodinsky.

171
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:19,786
They are Polish.

172
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:23,958
Voss. I'm Latvian.

173
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:27,036
It's a League of Nations.

174
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:28,337
And you are?

175
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,547
Smith.

176
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:32,170
And your first name.

177
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:34,547
Mister.

178
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:36,299
Mr. Smith.

179
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,800
That's right.

180
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:11,589
Might as well have shot us yesterday.

181
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:15,167
We're for the mines.

182
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:18,925
[thunderous crashing]

183
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:22,429
[shouting, coughing]

184
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:41,445
These collars same as used by
ancient Egyptian people.

185
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:44,406
Yes, but on their horses, probably.

186
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,283
No. No, no, no. Same for people.

187
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:48,709
How do you know?

188
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:51,082
I was professor of Egyptology,

189
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:53,789
Leningrad University.

190
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:56,250
[men shouting in Russian]

191
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:04,676
[grunting screaming]

192
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:15,444
[heavy breathing]

193
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:18,154
[gasping]

194
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:51,021
[shouting]

195
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:56,648
Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.

196
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:58,270
I've got to get out of here.

197
00:24:58,365 --> 00:24:59,855
I have to get back.

198
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,987
I have to get back.

199
00:25:03,078 --> 00:25:05,569
[man shouting in Russian]

200
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:09,828
[gasping]

201
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:10,950
It can be done.

202
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,410
What can be done?

203
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:13,744
He knows a way through the wire.

204
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:17,752
He has a plan.

205
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:20,175
Shh. Who has a plan?

206
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,841
His name is Khabarov.

207
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:24,387
The actor.

208
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:25,931
Do you know him?

209
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:27,974
He has no intention of escaping.

210
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:32,054
What do you mean?

211
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:33,855
He's a liar.

212
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:36,524
He's been here for years.

213
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:38,860
Seeks out new arrivals.

214
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:40,983
Me, when I first came here.

215
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:43,862
He just likes to talk about escape.

216
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:45,658
I've known others like him.

217
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,862
Why should I believe you?

218
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:50,242
Nothing is for nothing in the camps.

219
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:54,418
From you he gets your energy,
your spirit.

220
00:25:54,505 --> 00:25:56,666
You feed his dream of escape.

221
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,543
You help keep him alive.

222
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,337
He's nothing but a leech.

223
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:03,714
You are a cold bastard, Mister.

224
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:07,845
I'm still alive, that's all I know.

225
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:10,221
But I won't be in another six months,

226
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:11,890
and neither will you. Not here.

227
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,311
Not in these mines.

228
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,615
But if you are serious--

229
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:29,571
really serious about
making a run for it--

230
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:33,249
I'm with you.

231
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:35,371
I thought you were a loner.

232
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:37,544
It can't be done alone.

233
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:41,749
Besides, you have a--a weakness.

234
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,216
You could be useful to me.

235
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:45,043
And what is that?

236
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,095
Kindness.

237
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:48,763
If anything happens to me,

238
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,803
I'm counting on you carrying me.

239
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,772
[whistling of wind]

240
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,599
[Janusz, whispering] Khabarov.

241
00:26:58,694 --> 00:26:59,729
Khabarov, come.

242
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,855
What?

243
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,106
Come with me. Now.

244
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:03,232
What is it? What? What?

245
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:04,312
Come. Look at this.

246
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:05,739
Look at this.

247
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:08,613
We can go. We can go tonight.

248
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,656
The storm will cover our tracks.

249
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:12,284
No, no, no. What are you talking about?
It's a passing storm!

250
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,576
No, it's enough.

251
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,157
Janusz, that is impossible.

252
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:17,493
We need-- We need detailed preparation,

253
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:19,124
we need plans, we need maps.

254
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:21,296
No, no,
the timing will never be perfect.

255
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:23,089
Look, they won't expect it now.

256
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:24,508
Are you crazy?

257
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:26,426
What about the distances, huh?

258
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:28,754
It's, it's a thousand kilometers,
and we need food.

259
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,339
Plenty of food.

260
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:31,765
But, but we have food. You have food.

261
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:33,342
Look, the American is with us.

262
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:35,143
We've been trading, just like you said.

263
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:36,478
How long will that last?

264
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:37,850
Look, I've spent half my life

265
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:39,147
In the woods and mountains.

266
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:41,976
We can live off the land.

267
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:44,148
You don't understand.
You are too young.

268
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:45,191
It cannot be done.

269
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:46,317
What else is there?

270
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:47,485
You hear me?

271
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:48,611
To stay here and die?

272
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:50,238
It cannot be done.

273
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:52,160
Andrei!
How do we get through that wire?

274
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:54,329
I don't know
what you are talking about.

275
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,369
Your friend Lazar--

276
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,951
I mean, he knows, doesn't he?

277
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:00,661
You told me that.

278
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,101
Piss off now.

279
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,405
[grunt]

280
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:29,823
You can't see, can you?

281
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:34,528
Please don't leave me behind.

282
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,155
Promise me, Andrejs.

283
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,411
I can hold onto
your shoulder by night.

284
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:39,912
I can--I can see shapes.

285
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:42,710
By day I can see just fine.

286
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,382
I won't hold you up.

287
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:50,549
Please don't tell the others.

288
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:54,223
In here, I die.

289
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:55,841
[speaking Russian]

290
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:21,992
Swiss.

291
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:04,747
[hawking, spitting, coughing]

292
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:06,794
There are no secrets here.

293
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,463
What do you want?

294
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,962
The game goes against me.

295
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:14,086
Small debt, they take fingers.

296
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,797
Big debt, they take head.

297
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:19,094
Me, big debt.

298
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:22,804
But I never gambie my Wolf.

299
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:24,350
In forest, you need knife,

300
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:26,978
and I need miracle. Get me out of here.

301
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:40,946
[clanging]

302
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,003
[clanging]

303
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:49,416
[short metallic screech]

304
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:56,674
[dogs barking, men shouting]

305
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:57,842
[alarm blaring]

306
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:51,266
Come on! Come on!

307
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:53,101
Look! keep going. Keep going!

308
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:54,527
We must keep going! Get up!

309
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:56,070
Get up!

310
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:57,898
Activity, or we die right now.

311
00:31:57,993 --> 00:32:00,234
You know how fast the dogs are.

312
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:01,951
Run, damn you!

313
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,405
Mister, come on, look at me.

314
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:06,740
Is it time for me to carry you?

315
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:09,038
Come on. Come on.

316
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:10,494
Come on!

317
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:17,592
Janusz, we can't see anything!

318
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,546
The snow is blinding us!

319
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,301
Janusz!

320
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:33,353
(Janusz) I need your knife!

321
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:38,943
Give me the knife!

322
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,861
Your knife!

323
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:51,288
Janusz, we must take shelter!

324
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:52,661
We can't go on!

325
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:55,793
Don't you see? This is perfect!

326
00:32:55,884 --> 00:32:57,465
They'll never find us like this.

327
00:32:57,469 --> 00:32:58,709
Never!

328
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:20,230
[deep silence]

329
00:33:29,668 --> 00:33:33,286
You stare at me like snake at rabbit.

330
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,496
He teach me English.

331
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:37,998
Speak good, huh?

332
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:43,383
Bread for words, wasn't it, cowboy?

333
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:45,384
How far have we come?

334
00:33:45,475 --> 00:33:49,013
Maybe 20, 30 kilometers.

335
00:33:49,104 --> 00:33:50,560
That's all?

336
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:52,638
Less, if we've been going in circles

337
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:54,563
like chicken without head.

338
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:58,985
All right, let's see what we have.

339
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:01,988
Everyone, come on.

340
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:05,909
We share everything.

341
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:07,532
And you?

342
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:08,657
What?

343
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,363
Do you have?

344
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:18,918
And that coat.

345
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:20,374
It's not your coat.

346
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:22,504
That is Khabarov's coat.

347
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:25,838
Yes, he gave me.

348
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:26,967
And...

349
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:34,896
Huh? Huh?

350
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,889
[chuckling]

351
00:34:35,984 --> 00:34:37,064
See?

352
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,106
He was going to inform.

353
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:47,068
Don't worry. I talk to him.

354
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:48,488
Everything okay.

355
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:00,918
(Sm!th)
You've made a bargain with the devil.

356
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:02,249
You realize that?

357
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,750
Do you have a knife?

358
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:14,428
For direction he uses grass
and the mosses. What's that?

359
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,555
I swear to God
he better know what he's doing.

360
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,811
You should be grateful
you're here at all.

361
00:35:18,902 --> 00:35:20,767
Grateful is for dogs.

362
00:35:26,534 --> 00:35:28,490
[howling in distance]

363
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:31,615
What-- What's that?

364
00:35:31,706 --> 00:35:34,288
Woives. It's only wolves.

365
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:36,032
Only wolves.

366
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,519
South.

367
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:44,021
To Lake Baikal.

368
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:53,360
You are the Pakhan.

369
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:54,490
Am I?

370
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:56,697
What is a Pakhan?

371
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:59,541
Boss of Urki.

372
00:36:59,627 --> 00:37:01,834
We are not criminals.

373
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,207
We are escaping from criminals.

374
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:05,705
I have been watching you.

375
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,542
And I swear to God you win my respect

376
00:37:08,636 --> 00:37:10,718
with your sticks and pine cones.

377
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:14,218
I'll come between you and death.

378
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:16,511
So you want to be my bodyguard?

379
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:18,093
It's the Urka way.

380
00:37:18,188 --> 00:37:22,101
You have me, and you have the Wolf.

381
00:37:22,192 --> 00:37:24,057
Huh?

382
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:26,564
Janusz,
how long till we get to the lake?

383
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:27,731
How long?

384
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,604
Three, four weeks.

385
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:31,485
Maybe more.

386
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:43,751
(Janusz) I have us here somewhere.

387
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:46,747
And down here,
the Trans-Siberian Railway,

388
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:49,082
and the border of Mongolia.

389
00:37:49,094 --> 00:37:50,550
[groans]

390
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:52,298
Mongolia seems so far away.

391
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:55,096
Mongolia? I go more.

392
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:58,425
To America.

393
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,435
It's like this--
we have food for another week.

394
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:04,935
We have no more matches.

395
00:38:05,026 --> 00:38:08,063
But still we have Khabarov's flint.

396
00:38:08,154 --> 00:38:09,610
We need meat.

397
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:11,775
I can make traps.

398
00:38:11,783 --> 00:38:14,274
We'll be moving
too fast to wait for traps.

399
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:17,827
We find farms,
villages, get food there.

400
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:20,121
Look, there's a bounty on our heads.
Remember that.

401
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,915
We steal it. At night.
They never know.

402
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:24,458
We are not thieves.

403
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:27,295
Then I'll steal it, and I'll eat.

404
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:28,462
You can watch.

405
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:29,581
What is that?

406
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:30,882
Barbed wire.

407
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:32,800
He's making a fish-hook.

408
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:34,260
That's how we will survive.

409
00:38:34,347 --> 00:38:35,132
With fish?

410
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,300
Uh.

411
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:38,097
But I don't eat fish.

412
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:39,173
Then you'll die.

413
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:43,470
(Kazik) Come on,

414
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:45,977
we need to make a fire.

415
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,474
Come on, lots of wood.

416
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:50,352
It'll be 40 below tonight.

417
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:51,402

No, no, not too much, not too much.

00:39:21,978 --> 00:39:23,093
Kazik?

421
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:29,395
Kazik?

422
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:32,899
He's still out, looking for wood.

423
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:35,230
He has night blindness.

424
00:39:36,993 --> 00:39:38,278

(Kazik) Professor.

433
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:02,071
I came from the mine to find you.

434
00:41:05,206 --> 00:41:07,162
I thought I was alone.

435
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,959
I've been walking with you
for some time.

436
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:13,661
I'll--
I'll just sit for a minute.

437
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:30,095
Not far to go.

438
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:39,070
We made it.

439
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:44,192
We really made it.

440
00:41:47,332 --> 00:41:49,664
Isn't that something?

441
00:42:39,717 --> 00:42:44,211
Lord, take this
innocent soul into thy keeping.

442
00:42:44,305 --> 00:42:49,766
Amen.

443
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:52,138
A free man died here today.

444
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,022
Still, one less mouth to feed.

445
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:03,905

They'll find our bones

452
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:36,699
and say "Look,
a fine example of Early Gulag Man."

453
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:39,159
[angrily] Shut up with your jokes.

454
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,001
Go and find food like the others do.

455
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:42,953
You do the shutting up!

456
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:44,664
Drawing all day
like you're on holiday.

457
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:45,965
I'm sick.

458
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:48,168
I cook. They find food.

459
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:49,342
What do you ever do?

460
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,342
Nothing.

who will be first?

What do you mean, first?

466
00:45:32,348 --> 00:45:34,213
The first to die.

467
00:45:34,308 --> 00:45:37,266
I think the artist.

468
00:45:37,353 --> 00:45:40,561
But better if it was him,
the funny man.

469
00:45:40,565 --> 00:45:44,228
Why better if it's Zoran?

470

474
00:45:57,123 --> 00:45:59,034
We must have meat, or we die here.

You're the Pakhan,
you've thought of it.

We all have.

477
00:46:03,254 --> 00:46:04,915
That's why you brought extra people,
isn't it?

478
00:46:05,006 --> 00:46:05,870
For food?

00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:07,751
No, no, no.

480
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:09,423
We will get more food
when we get to Lake Baikal.

481
00:46:09,427 --> 00:46:11,292
There will be plenty of fish there.

482
00:46:11,387 --> 00:46:15,221
You said we would have
seen lake a week ago.

483

547
00:52:59,503 --> 00:53:01,164
Well, she needs food,
you know, protection.

Oh, come on. She's starving.

We can barely feed ourselves.

560
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:33,317
Yeah,
maybe it's kinder to leave her.

561
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:35,494
No, she was sent to us.
We can't leave her.

562
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:39,199
Janusz, we have no choice.

(Janusz) Hey, hey, hey, hey!

565
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,981
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

566
00:54:14,745 --> 00:54:16,406
Stay back.

567
00:54:16,497 --> 00:54:18,033
Stay back. Careful of the mud.

568
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,332
Easy. Easy. Easy.

569
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:26,954

570
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:28,880
Here you are.

572
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:54,318

574
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:15,878

576
00:55:45,169 --> 00:55:47,535
[chuckle]

577
00:55:47,629 --> 00:55:48,960
Is the soap ready?

578
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:50,287
Yes.

579
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:51,792
Ah, good.

580
00:55:51,884 --> 00:55:53,420

[laughing]

582
00:56:05,856 --> 00:56:07,016
Well?

583
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,640
What's so funny?

584
00:56:09,735 --> 00:56:11,316
Are you--

585
00:56:11,403 --> 00:56:13,564
you are going to the office
this morning?

586

[laughing]

587
00:56:33,926 --> 00:56:35,041
Valka?

588
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:36,170
Valka.

589
00:56:36,261 --> 00:56:37,376
Come on.

590
00:56:37,471 --> 00:56:38,802
You're next. Go, go.

591
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:41,471
(Zoran) Valka, come on!

592
00:56:49,483 --> 00:56:51,064
Now take off your shirt.

593
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,436
Why do we do this?

594
00:56:55,531 --> 00:56:59,740
So we don't look like
thieves and robbers.

595
00:56:59,743 --> 00:57:02,359
Head up.

597
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:07,447

00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:11,247
Very still, please.

[men and Irena laugh, chatter]

606

You know, I, uh,
can't beiieve she's Polish.

607
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:09,180
She's, uh, she's educated.

608
00:58:09,271 --> 00:58:11,307
Speaks good English, French.

609
00:58:11,398 --> 00:58:12,979
Is that right?

610
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:14,977
You don't like her, do you?

611
00:58:15,068 --> 00:58:16,649
Speak to Valka about her.

612
00:58:16,653 --> 00:58:18,564
He doesn't even think she's Polish.

613
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:19,861
Well, I did speak to him.

614
00:58:19,948 --> 00:58:21,609
And the others.

615
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,156
They agree she comes with us.

616
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:27,657
What, you disagree?

617
00:58:27,664 --> 00:58:30,781
There's no room for sentimentality,
you know that.

618
00:58:30,876 --> 00:58:33,743
Apart from food, she'll slow us down.

619
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:48,010
[sigh]

620
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:04,531
(Janusz) No, it won't take our weight.

621
00:59:04,618 --> 00:59:06,358
We'll have to swim across.

622
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:12,406
Can you swim?

623
00:59:13,502 --> 00:59:14,912
Yes, Mister.

624
00:59:15,003 --> 00:59:16,493
You wouldn't lie to me.

625
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:17,828
I'm not lying, Comrade.

626
00:59:17,923 --> 00:59:19,879
And don't call me Comrade.

627
00:59:29,184 --> 00:59:30,219
Irena, no!

628
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:57,872
Here, come on.

629

[speaking Polish]

630
01:00:04,803 --> 01:00:06,339
Here, take the food.

631
01:00:16,523 --> 01:00:18,479
Were your parents arrested with you?

632
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:20,558
They're dead.

633
01:00:20,652 --> 01:00:23,439
We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.

634
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,145
When the Russians came,

635
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,776
they said we were kulaks

636
01:00:26,867 --> 01:00:29,153
and exploiting the peasants.

637
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:33,783
My parents were afraid
and hid me in the barn.

638
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,122
I found them later.

639
01:00:43,633 --> 01:00:47,125
I--

640
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:54,137
I found them face-down in the mud.

641
01:00:54,227 --> 01:00:59,062
They'd been bashed
and strangled with barbed wire.

642
01:01:05,447 --> 01:01:07,813
Later, the Russians caught me

643
01:01:07,908 --> 01:01:12,277
and sent me to a collective farm.

644
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,782
They were cruel to me.

645
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:17,489
I ran away.

646
01:01:17,584 --> 01:01:19,666
I had no food.

647
01:01:19,753 --> 01:01:21,789
And then I saw you.

648
01:01:30,055 --> 01:01:31,886
You can't swim, can you?

649
01:01:35,101 --> 01:01:36,762
What?

650
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:38,514
You've never been near
the water in your life.

651
01:01:38,605 --> 01:01:41,187
But I got across, didn't I?
And you followed.

652
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:44,524
And you said you lived
on a farm near Warsaw?

653
01:01:44,528 --> 01:01:45,813
Yes.

654
01:01:45,904 --> 01:01:47,394
Soviets didn't get that far.

655
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:52,028
That was German territory.

656
01:01:52,118 --> 01:01:55,485
Your parents weren't murdered,
were they?

657
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,821
You made all that up.

658
01:02:01,419 --> 01:02:04,411
We've all done
terrible things to survives.

659
01:02:08,468 --> 01:02:10,629
But don't ever lie to me again.

660
01:02:14,349 --> 01:02:16,590
We've had enough of lies.

(Janusz) We have to go around it.

664
01:02:29,364 --> 01:02:31,605
Quicker through it.

665
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,565
No, they have dogs.

666
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,072
If they raise the alarm,
then we don't stand a chance.

667
01:02:36,162 --> 01:02:37,948
We need food again, Pakhan.

668
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:39,779
Look, I know we need food,

669
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,207
but we can't go into
that town and risk arrest.

670
01:02:42,294 --> 01:02:43,704
We're wasting time.

671
01:03:00,854 --> 01:03:02,765
(Smith) What is it? What's wrong?

672
01:03:02,772 --> 01:03:04,262
Where's Valka?

673
01:03:04,274 --> 01:03:05,764
He was behind Zoran.

674
01:03:05,859 --> 01:03:07,975
Zoran, weren't you watching him?

675
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:12,153
(Zoran) I'm not his keeper.

676
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,855
Damn him.

677
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,941
(Smith)
He could turn us in for the bounty.

678
01:03:16,036 --> 01:03:17,242
And risk arrest?

679
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:19,615
He's a gambler.

680
01:03:19,706 --> 01:03:22,914
Irena,
do you think he would do that?

681
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:24,207
He might.

682
01:03:24,294 --> 01:03:25,659
We don't need his knife.

683
01:03:25,754 --> 01:03:27,665
We can make one out of deer bone.

684
01:03:27,756 --> 01:03:29,872
It's an opportunity to get rid of him.

685
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,341
All right, all right.

686
01:03:34,429 --> 01:03:36,010
Come on, let's go.

687
01:03:36,097 --> 01:03:38,304
(Valka) Watch it funny man?

688
01:03:38,308 --> 01:03:39,798
Hey, hey, hey!

689
01:03:39,893 --> 01:03:42,475
You want to get us all killed? Hmm?

690
01:03:42,562 --> 01:03:44,974
Hmm?

691
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:48,314
Easy, cowboy.

692
01:03:48,401 --> 01:03:51,188
You tear my coat.

693
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:52,268
Idiot.

694
01:03:52,364 --> 01:03:55,822
Idlot? Ha.

695
01:03:55,909 --> 01:03:57,240
Am I?

696
01:03:57,327 --> 01:03:59,158
Let's see who is idiot.

697
01:04:02,374 --> 01:04:05,366
What?

698
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,620
Did I kill?

699
01:04:06,711 --> 01:04:09,999
Yes.

700
01:04:10,006 --> 01:04:11,496
A dog.

701
01:04:11,591 --> 01:04:14,333
Don't believe me, then don't eat.

702
01:04:14,427 --> 01:04:19,217
But you will, won't you,
because you want to survive.

703
01:04:19,307 --> 01:04:21,172
I know about survive.

704
01:04:21,184 --> 01:04:24,972
All my life.

705
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:27,679
And--

706
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:29,522
it's my birthday.

707
01:04:29,609 --> 01:04:33,022
In Russia, that means we drink.

[singing in Russian]

710
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:26,660
She lived in the streets, like me.

711
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:31,204
So the story you told us wasn't true.

712
01:05:31,296 --> 01:05:33,252
I thought that story would be more sad

713
01:05:33,339 --> 01:05:35,125
and you wouldn't leave me behind.

714
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,224
My parents were Polish Communists.

715
01:05:46,311 --> 01:05:50,930
They took us to live in Soviet Union,
to Moscow.

716
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,556
They want to work for the Revolution.

717
01:05:55,695 --> 01:05:57,936
We lived in the Hotel Lux,

718
01:05:58,031 --> 01:06:01,148
with lots of foreign Communists.

719
01:06:01,242 --> 01:06:07,784
But they arrested them in 1937.

720
01:06:07,874 --> 01:06:09,330
They said they were spies.

721
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,127
The people pot me in the orphanage.

722
01:06:15,215 --> 01:06:16,751

I was ten years old.

725
01:06:26,059 --> 01:06:28,516
They called me Rykov,

726
01:06:28,603 --> 01:06:36,601
but I remembered our Polish name--
Zielinska.

727
01:06:36,694 --> 01:06:42,815
I used to say it every night
before I went to sleep.

728
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:44,194
So you ran away.

729
01:06:48,623 --> 01:06:49,738

739

No, it's too risky.

748
01:07:55,273 --> 01:07:56,683
No mosquitoes!

749
01:07:56,774 --> 01:07:57,889
Zoran! Zoran!

750
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:05,571
What's he doing, for God's sake?

751
01:08:10,205 --> 01:08:11,786
[buzzing continues]

752
01:08:22,425 --> 01:08:24,040
Mosquito repellent.

753
01:08:27,931 --> 01:08:30,468
So what you say to him?

754
01:08:30,558 --> 01:08:32,139
Who?

755
01:08:32,227 --> 01:08:33,763
The mosquito man.

756
01:08:33,853 --> 01:08:35,593
Ah.

757
01:08:35,605 --> 01:08:36,936
I'm an escaped convict

758
01:08:37,023 --> 01:08:38,308
who is plagued by mosquitoes.

759
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,764
Yeah, very funny.

760
01:08:39,776 --> 01:08:41,232
No, really, what did you say?

761
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:43,025
Come on, man.

762
01:08:43,112 --> 01:08:44,943
[laughter]

763
01:08:45,031 --> 01:08:46,066
Clown.

764
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,820
(Janusz) Goodbye, Lake Baikal.

765
01:08:53,915 --> 01:08:55,280
Well done.

766
01:09:05,301 --> 01:09:07,462
Mister, did you know Voss is a priest?

767
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:10,169
No, I didn't know that.

768
01:09:10,265 --> 01:09:12,347
And Tomasz is a pastry chef,

769
01:09:12,433 --> 01:09:13,969
but he wants to be an artist.

770
01:09:13,977 --> 01:09:15,638
You don't say.

771
01:09:15,728 --> 01:09:18,936
And Zoran was on business in Moscow,

772
01:09:19,023 --> 01:09:20,934
arrested in Red Square.

773
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:23,687
He said he was
just taking a photo of the Kremlin.

774
01:09:23,778 --> 01:09:26,315
He's an accountant.

775
01:09:26,406 --> 01:09:28,317
Well, I'll be damned.

776
01:09:28,324 --> 01:09:30,315
I never knew a funny accountant.

777
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:33,152
[laughing]

778
01:09:33,246 --> 01:09:35,328
Don't you talk to each other?

779
01:09:35,415 --> 01:09:39,203
In the camps you learn to say
as little as possible.

780
01:09:39,294 --> 01:09:40,875
Mr. Smith?

781
01:09:40,962 --> 01:09:42,953
Working on the Moscow Metro?

782
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:44,662
He's an engineer.

783
01:09:44,757 --> 01:09:46,497
His father was Finnish.

784
01:09:46,509 --> 01:09:49,842
Grew up in America,
but he could speak Russian.

785
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:53,342
And why would an American
move to Russia, for God's sake?

786
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:55,010
The Depression.

787
01:09:55,018 --> 01:09:57,350
His son came with him.

788
01:09:57,437 --> 01:10:00,895
What happened to his son?

789
01:10:00,982 --> 01:10:02,973
They shot him.

790
01:10:03,067 --> 01:10:04,477
He was 17.

791
01:10:30,404 --> 01:10:32,770
[dogs barking]

792
01:10:32,865 --> 01:10:35,402
[loud chatter]

793
01:11:12,459 --> 01:11:13,949
[whispering] The Mongolian border

794
01:11:14,044 --> 01:11:15,750
is on the other side of those tracks--

795
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:17,452
maybe four, five days away.

796
01:11:17,547 --> 01:11:19,458
Can we cross somewhere else?

797
01:11:19,549 --> 01:11:21,039
Here, this is the main line.

798
01:11:21,134 --> 01:11:22,965
It's going to be like this everywhere.

799
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:25,802
He's right. We wait till tonight.

800
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,135
What?

801
01:11:33,229 --> 01:11:34,685
Nothing. just looking.

802
01:11:34,773 --> 01:11:36,434
Don't look.

803
01:11:44,407 --> 01:11:45,647
(Zoran) Valka?

804
01:11:45,742 --> 01:11:47,733
What?

805
01:11:47,827 --> 01:11:50,113
Why do you have assholes tattooed
on your chest?

806
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:52,161
I mean, they should be on your ass

807
01:11:52,248 --> 01:11:54,660
so you can sit on them
every time you take a shit.

808
01:11:54,668 --> 01:11:56,374
You think it's funny?

809
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:58,201
They are great men.

810
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:02,213
Whoa, whoa! Valka! Valka!

811
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:05,337
Don't you know what "Stalin" means,
funny man?

812
01:12:05,428 --> 01:12:07,214
Means Man-of-Steel.

813
01:12:07,305 --> 01:12:09,341
He takes from rich and gives to poor.

814
01:12:09,432 --> 01:12:11,718
Yes, of course he does.

815
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,846
Then he takes both of them

816
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:15,809
and puts them in a Gulag for 25 years.

817
01:12:15,897 --> 01:12:18,138
Watch your eyes, crow bait.

818
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:26,605
[train whistles in distance]

819
01:12:58,982 --> 01:13:01,724
Thank you, Mother Russia,
for your hospitality,

820
01:13:01,735 --> 01:13:03,851
but I will definitely
not be coming back.

821
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:05,060
[chuckling]

822
01:13:32,932 --> 01:13:36,095
You know, they'll-- they'll catch you.

823
01:13:36,186 --> 01:13:39,098
Yeah. Prison is okay.

824
01:13:39,105 --> 01:13:40,595
Debt is bad.

825
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:42,271
But there are many prisons,

826
01:13:42,275 --> 01:13:43,515
they don't find me.

827
01:13:46,362 --> 01:13:49,229
What about America?

828
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:53,442
Oh. It's not for me, freedom.

829
01:13:53,536 --> 01:13:56,198
I wouldn't know what to do with it,
I swear to God.

830
01:13:59,209 --> 01:14:05,956
So we must say goodbye, my Wolf and me.

831
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:08,957
You don't need him anymore.

832
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:18,475
Good luck, Valka.

833
01:14:18,478 --> 01:14:20,469
Goodbye, Janusz.

834
01:15:04,816 --> 01:15:07,523
(Janusz) Look. See?

835
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:10,397
(Irena) Do you think
we'll get there by tonight?

836
01:15:10,488 --> 01:15:12,069
Yes, I think so.

837
01:15:12,157 --> 01:15:13,988
What will we do?

838
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:16,191
We will eat.

839
01:15:16,202 --> 01:15:17,157
Yes.

840
01:15:17,245 --> 01:15:18,735
We will sleep.

841
01:15:23,376 --> 01:15:24,661
(Janusz) We made it.

842
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:26,242
[chatter]

843
01:15:50,361 --> 01:15:51,976
Mister!

844
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:59,359
They're communists.

845
01:16:04,417 --> 01:16:06,282
(Janusz) So it's here too.

846
01:16:15,178 --> 01:16:17,464
This changes everything.

847
01:16:19,849 --> 01:16:21,714
There's nowhere to hide.

848
01:16:38,743 --> 01:16:40,404
(Voss) It's a Buddhist temple.

849
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:43,077
They might take us in.

850
01:16:43,164 --> 01:16:45,621
They might also be
working with the regime.

851
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:47,915
It's a risk.

852
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:46,679
What happened here?

853
01:17:46,686 --> 01:17:49,223
The same as happened in Russia.

854
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:58,312
Churches closed...

855
01:17:58,406 --> 01:18:03,025
priests shot or taken to camps...

856
01:18:03,036 --> 01:18:04,651
religion banned.

857
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:12,659
They came to my church, in Latvia.

858
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,961
Destroyed everything, much like this.

859
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:23,587
I went back later that night,

860
01:18:23,681 --> 01:18:26,343
and there was a lone-- lone guard.

861
01:18:26,434 --> 01:18:30,177
Just a boy.

862
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:32,057
And I strangled him

863
01:18:32,148 --> 01:18:35,106
until his eyes
popped right out of his head.

864
01:18:44,827 --> 01:18:48,740
Valka knew somehow.

865
01:18:48,748 --> 01:18:51,285
He knew I'd killed in cold blood.

866
01:19:01,344 --> 01:19:02,709
(Zoran) How far is China?

867
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:04,419
I don't know.

868
01:19:04,514 --> 01:19:08,757
Maybe five, six hundred
kilometers due south.

869
01:19:08,768 --> 01:19:11,885
600 kilometers?

870
01:19:11,979 --> 01:19:13,219
Is Chlna free?

871
01:19:13,314 --> 01:19:14,474
They're fighting the Japs.

872
01:19:14,565 --> 01:19:15,680
I know that much.

873
01:19:15,775 --> 01:19:17,640
After China is Tibet.

874
01:19:17,735 --> 01:19:20,568
We could go to Lhasa, the capital.

875
01:19:23,783 --> 01:19:27,196
[speaking Polish]

876
01:19:35,795 --> 01:19:37,911
(Voss) What?
What are you talking about?

877
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:39,791
They say we could go beyond Tibet,

878
01:19:39,882 --> 01:19:41,418
over the mountains to India.

879
01:19:41,509 --> 01:19:42,464
What mountains?

880
01:19:42,552 --> 01:19:43,962
The Himalayas.

881
01:19:44,053 --> 01:19:45,509
Join the British Army.

882
01:19:45,596 --> 01:19:47,336
Fight Nazls, then fight the Russians.

883
01:19:47,432 --> 01:19:50,299
Go over the Himalayas?

884
01:19:50,393 --> 01:19:54,011
How? On a magic carpet?

885
01:19:54,105 --> 01:19:56,312
How?

886
01:19:56,315 --> 01:19:58,021
We walk.

887
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:14,196
(Janusz) Careful.

888
01:20:28,097 --> 01:20:30,463
Come on, wake up.

889
01:20:30,558 --> 01:20:33,516
I was in the middle
of this beautiful dream.

890
01:20:33,603 --> 01:20:36,015
I was about to eat some salt.

891
01:20:36,105 --> 01:20:38,141
I almost taste it.

892
01:20:38,232 --> 01:20:41,065
I just want to go back to that dream.

893
01:20:41,152 --> 01:20:42,892
It's a very simple recipe.

894
01:20:42,987 --> 01:20:45,820
You just need two sprigs of rosemary

895
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:47,522
and a pinch of nutmeg.

896
01:20:47,617 --> 01:20:50,029
Nutmeg? What about the salt?

897
01:20:50,036 --> 01:20:52,072
No, we'll--we'll get to that. Now--

898
01:20:52,163 --> 01:20:53,243
add the oil--

899
01:20:53,331 --> 01:20:54,616
Mm-hmm.

900
01:20:54,707 --> 01:20:56,038
and you leave it to marinate

901
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:57,490
while you prepare the chicken.

902
01:20:57,585 --> 01:20:58,324
This is where the salt comes in.

903
01:20:58,419 --> 01:20:59,955
Good.

904
01:21:00,046 --> 01:21:01,707
You rub it into the skin of the chicken

905
01:21:01,714 --> 01:21:03,250
with a little bit of the paprika.

906
01:21:03,341 --> 01:21:04,877
But double the salt.

907
01:21:04,967 --> 01:21:06,377
Look,
you cannot just doubie the sait.

908
01:21:06,469 --> 01:21:07,925
It'll be too salty then.

909
01:21:08,012 --> 01:21:09,718
I don't care, just doubie the sait.

910
01:21:09,722 --> 01:21:11,553
I'm not going to ruin it.

911
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:13,256
just double the salt, please.

912
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:14,716
No.

913
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:15,845
Tomasz--

914
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:16,972
No.

915
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:23,896
[men shouting in distance]

916
01:21:23,903 --> 01:21:25,063
[horses nickering]

917
01:21:25,154 --> 01:21:26,735
[galloping grows louder]

918
01:21:26,822 --> 01:21:28,278
All right, all right.
Everybody keep calm.

919
01:21:28,366 --> 01:21:29,822
Oh, my God!

920
01:21:29,909 --> 01:21:33,072
No, no, no! Don't run! Don't run.

921
01:21:33,162 --> 01:21:35,323
Be calm and smile. Be friendly.

922
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:42,126
Hey, whoa! Whoa!

923
01:21:42,213 --> 01:21:43,544
Everybody smile.

924
01:21:43,631 --> 01:21:47,795
Hello. Hello.

925
01:21:47,885 --> 01:21:49,045
[speaking Russian]

926
01:22:48,404 --> 01:22:50,190
[speaking Russian]

927
01:22:55,578 --> 01:22:56,613
[command to horse]

928
01:23:38,579 --> 01:23:40,035
That's south.

929
01:24:15,157 --> 01:24:17,193
Are we going to eat that?

930
01:24:17,284 --> 01:24:20,196
It's either this or fish.

931
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,209
It looks like a bird's nest.

932
01:24:28,295 --> 01:24:30,536
It will protect you from the sun.

933
01:24:35,469 --> 01:24:37,801
Irena, try this for your feet.

934
01:25:11,422 --> 01:25:12,753
[grunt]

935
01:25:24,268 --> 01:25:25,974
South.

936
01:25:25,978 --> 01:25:27,969
Come on, we keep going.

937
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:36,276
[heavy breathing]

938
01:25:45,122 --> 01:25:47,613
No, it's another mirage.

939
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:48,914
We have no water.

940
01:25:50,461 --> 01:25:51,951
There's trees there.

941
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:55,834
If there's trees, there--there's water.

942
01:25:55,841 --> 01:25:57,206
No, I don't care.

943
01:25:57,301 --> 01:25:59,166
It's east. We're going south.

944
01:25:59,261 --> 01:26:01,798
But, Janusz,
we've got to give it a try.

945
01:26:01,889 --> 01:26:04,346
No, no, no. We must keep going south,

946
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:05,635
or you'll kill us all.

947
01:26:05,726 --> 01:26:07,182
Damn it!

948
01:26:07,269 --> 01:26:11,057
Janusz, we're dying.

949
01:26:11,148 --> 01:26:12,479
We're already dying.

950
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:13,976
Stop.

951
01:26:37,466 --> 01:26:39,127
It's a mirage!

952
01:26:40,344 --> 01:26:42,505
It's just a mirage.

953
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:05,776
[heavy breathing]

954
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:07,656
[bird calls]

955
01:27:14,169 --> 01:27:16,706
[whispering] Mirages don't have birds.

956
01:27:21,427 --> 01:27:23,793
[loudly] Mirages don't have birds!

957
01:27:33,939 --> 01:27:35,645
It's a well!

958
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:52,246
[coughing]

959
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:55,120
Don't fill yourselves. You'll get sick.

960
01:29:28,762 --> 01:29:30,548
(Zoran) At least we have water here.

961
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:32,425
(Janusz) Shh. Shh. You'll wake her.

962
01:29:32,516 --> 01:29:34,381
Yeah, but no food.

963
01:29:34,476 --> 01:29:36,387
(Voss) Maybe nomads
will come to water their flocks.

964
01:29:36,478 --> 01:29:38,184
When?

965
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:40,183
Next week, next month?

966
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:43,016
We should stay here
at least a few more days.

967
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:46,944
Look, without food,
we'll only get weaker.

968
01:29:47,031 --> 01:29:49,898
And then maybe too weak to travel.

969
01:29:49,908 --> 01:29:56,279
I don't know. After these last days--

970
01:29:56,373 --> 01:29:58,455
I don't know if
I can go through that again.

971
01:30:00,794 --> 01:30:02,750
It was a miracle finding this.

972
01:30:02,838 --> 01:30:05,705
Can we count on another?

973
01:30:05,799 --> 01:30:06,914
Janusz?

974
01:30:12,931 --> 01:30:14,796
(Janusz) Okay, give me your best.

975
01:30:21,148 --> 01:30:22,388
Ohh!

976
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:23,768
Ah, ha ha!

977
01:30:23,859 --> 01:30:26,271
(Irena) Wait, wait, wait!

978
01:30:26,278 --> 01:30:27,563
Go, Tomasz!

979
01:30:27,654 --> 01:30:28,689
[happy shriek]

980
01:30:28,781 --> 01:30:30,612
[laughter]

981
01:30:30,616 --> 01:30:31,947
Hat, please.

982
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:37,069
Lower.

983
01:31:46,066 --> 01:31:48,478
Run! Run!

984
01:31:48,569 --> 01:31:50,855
Get back, get back! Take cover!

985
01:31:50,946 --> 01:31:54,279
[thundering wind]

986
01:31:56,869 --> 01:31:58,154
Behind that dune!

987
01:32:04,793 --> 01:32:07,751
Irena! Get down!

988
01:32:07,838 --> 01:32:09,920
[shouting]

989
01:32:10,007 --> 01:32:11,417
Don't be afraid!

990
01:32:11,508 --> 01:32:17,174
[inaudible]

991
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:24,927
[Tomasz, whispering] Irena.

992
01:32:25,022 --> 01:32:29,106
Irena.

993
01:32:29,193 --> 01:32:33,402
Sun-dried fish.

994
01:32:33,488 --> 01:32:34,773
[weakiy] Thank you.

995
01:32:38,035 --> 01:32:39,241
(Tomasz) Here.

996
01:32:52,424 --> 01:32:54,380
Can you find our way back to the well?

997
01:32:54,468 --> 01:32:57,301
It was way off course.

998
01:32:57,387 --> 01:33:00,129
Remember? I mean, way east.

999
01:33:00,224 --> 01:33:01,714
There's no--

1000
01:33:01,808 --> 01:33:04,049
There's no features in this wasteland.

1001
01:33:04,144 --> 01:33:06,430
I could never find it.

1002
01:33:36,969 --> 01:33:39,005
When I helped my father in the fields

1003
01:33:39,096 --> 01:33:40,757
during the hot summers,

1004
01:33:40,847 --> 01:33:43,008
we used to suck on
small stones like these.

1005
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,307
Made us feel less thirsty.

1006
01:33:59,574 --> 01:34:00,859
Janusz!

1007
01:34:21,805 --> 01:34:23,261
Sunstroke?

1008
01:34:30,689 --> 01:34:32,350
I'm becoming a nuisance.

1009
01:34:33,775 --> 01:34:37,518
No, no, no.

1010
01:34:37,612 --> 01:34:40,354
Do they hurt you?

1011
01:34:40,365 --> 01:34:44,483
No, not at all.

1012
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:47,911
They must be swelling
because I've walked so far.

1013
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:53,079
Don't you think, Mister?

1014
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:54,159
Yes.

1015
01:34:57,049 --> 01:34:58,585
You lie back down now.

1016
01:34:58,675 --> 01:35:00,540
I'm gonna cover your legs up for you.

1017
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:20,690
[labored breathing]

1018
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:22,942
Irena, we can stop for a while.

1019
01:35:23,033 --> 01:35:26,400
No.

1020
01:35:26,495 --> 01:35:28,406
just suck on this.

1021
01:35:47,974 --> 01:35:50,260
No! Please, no! No!

1022
01:35:50,268 --> 01:35:53,635
Shh. Shh.

1023
01:36:03,156 --> 01:36:06,193
Come on. We've got to keep going.

1024
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:16,787
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

1025
01:36:16,878 --> 01:36:19,665
Shh.

1026
01:36:19,756 --> 01:36:21,667
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

1027
01:36:21,758 --> 01:36:23,043
Shh, shh, shh.

1028
01:36:41,945 --> 01:36:44,527
Put me on the ground, Andrejs.

1029
01:36:47,993 --> 01:36:50,075
just lay me on the ground.

1030
01:37:57,062 --> 01:37:58,973
It's okay.

1031
01:38:02,150 --> 01:38:04,812
[exhales softly]

1032
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:51,147
(Voss)
Command thine angels to receive her

1033
01:38:51,241 --> 01:38:53,778
and to take her to heaven--

1034
01:38:53,785 --> 01:38:56,652
her country.

1035
01:38:56,746 --> 01:39:01,911
Amen.

1036
01:40:18,203 --> 01:40:19,568
[grunt]

1037
01:40:19,663 --> 01:40:21,119
[flies buzzing]

1038
01:41:24,811 --> 01:41:26,802
(Smith) I really like this one.

1039
01:41:26,896 --> 01:41:28,602
When did you do that?

1040
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:30,931
Second night in the Gulag.

1041
01:41:31,025 --> 01:41:37,237
Poor Kazik,
always in trouble with his feet.

1042
01:41:37,323 --> 01:41:40,781
Who is this?

1043
01:41:40,869 --> 01:41:42,655
You.

1044
01:41:42,746 --> 01:41:45,453
Looks like my father.

1045
01:41:45,457 --> 01:41:46,788
Is that how I look now?

1046
01:41:46,875 --> 01:41:48,160
No.

1047
01:41:48,251 --> 01:41:50,788
Now, you look worse.

1048
01:41:50,795 --> 01:41:52,080
[Voss laughing weakly]

1049
01:41:54,799 --> 01:41:56,790
[inaudible]

1050
01:41:56,801 --> 01:41:59,087
You caught her smile.

1051
01:42:01,431 --> 01:42:02,762
Look.

1052
01:42:02,849 --> 01:42:06,808
This is--just a sketch.

1053
01:42:06,811 --> 01:42:09,644
But I'll work on it.

1054
01:42:09,731 --> 01:42:11,267
I'll do it.

1055
01:42:11,357 --> 01:42:14,349
That's really fine work.

1056
01:42:14,444 --> 01:42:20,155
You're a great artist, Tomasz.

1057
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:21,864
It's almost like a photography.

1058
01:42:21,951 --> 01:42:25,159
It's the shadow.

1059
01:42:25,246 --> 01:42:27,578
It's really nice.

1060
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:08,157
We have to get to those hills.

1061
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:12,366
Water may be trapped there.

1062
01:43:12,377 --> 01:43:16,040
Come on. Come on, get up. Get up.

1063
01:43:20,802 --> 01:43:22,667
Mister.

1064
01:43:22,762 --> 01:43:25,595
Come on.

1065
01:43:25,682 --> 01:43:30,221
Go on without me.

1066
01:43:30,228 --> 01:43:31,809
I'm done.

1067
01:43:35,733 --> 01:43:36,848
Go.

1068
01:43:44,909 --> 01:43:48,197
Zoran...

1069
01:43:48,288 --> 01:43:52,076
you go to the hills and look for water.

1070
01:43:52,083 --> 01:43:53,539
And you wait for us there.

1071
01:43:53,626 --> 01:43:54,615
No.

1072
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:55,791
Yes.

1073
01:43:55,879 --> 01:43:58,165
We'll catch up.

1074
01:44:36,377 --> 01:44:37,662
Did you find water?

1075
01:44:37,754 --> 01:44:38,869
No.

1076
01:44:48,806 --> 01:44:50,421
[rustiing]

1077
01:44:54,938 --> 01:45:03,357
[gasping]

1078
01:45:17,794 --> 01:45:20,160
Show me.

1079
01:45:20,254 --> 01:45:22,461
Please show me.

1080
01:45:28,638 --> 01:45:30,094
Where--?

1081
01:45:37,021 --> 01:45:38,431
Where are you?

1082
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:42,515
[grunting]

1083
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:56,404
There's--

1084
01:45:58,751 --> 01:45:59,866
water!

1085
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:03,161
[slurping]

1086
01:46:16,019 --> 01:46:19,011
[coughing]

1087
01:46:38,207 --> 01:46:40,698
[whispering] Zoran.

1088
01:46:40,793 --> 01:46:42,203
Around here.

1089
01:46:54,891 --> 01:46:56,973
[weak laughing]

1090
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,392
Look at that, uh?

1091
01:46:59,479 --> 01:47:01,765
What if--if it's poisonous?
How can we eat it?

1092
01:47:01,856 --> 01:47:03,892
No, no, no, we cut off its head.

1093
01:47:03,983 --> 01:47:06,474
Here. Give me the knife.

1094
01:47:06,569 --> 01:47:08,981
Ah, look at that.

1095
01:47:18,706 --> 01:47:19,991
[loud sigh]

1096
01:47:31,594 --> 01:47:32,800
Tastes like chicken.

1097
01:47:32,887 --> 01:47:34,548
Yeah.

1098
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:37,631
A big, black,
poisonous chicken with no legs.

1099
01:47:37,642 --> 01:47:39,303
(Janusz) Well, it's not bad.

1100
01:47:42,814 --> 01:47:47,183
You know,
Valka talked of eating each other

1101
01:47:47,276 --> 01:47:48,812
when we were in Siberia.

1102
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,019
He did?

1103
01:47:52,115 --> 01:47:53,525
Yes.

1104
01:47:53,616 --> 01:47:56,403
And? Would you have eaten me?

1105
01:47:56,494 --> 01:47:59,156
[chuckling] Yeah.

1106
01:47:59,163 --> 01:48:01,654
Yeah, of course.

1107
01:48:01,666 --> 01:48:03,827
I would never have eaten you.

1108
01:48:03,835 --> 01:48:05,450
[laughing] Well, why not?

1109
01:48:05,545 --> 01:48:07,081
Too stringy and bitter.

1110
01:48:07,171 --> 01:48:08,957
I'd rather eat snake.

1111
01:48:36,868 --> 01:48:38,654
Here's some water.

1112
01:48:47,128 --> 01:48:49,369
It can kill you, remember?

1113
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:50,711
What?

1114
01:48:50,715 --> 01:48:53,548
Kindness.

1115
01:48:53,634 --> 01:48:56,717
How long can you survive
on mud and snakes?

1116
01:48:58,014 --> 01:49:00,050
Just leave me here.

1117
01:49:04,353 --> 01:49:06,685
You can't, can you?

1118
01:49:14,322 --> 01:49:15,732
Look, Mister--

1119
01:49:15,823 --> 01:49:17,939
What?

1120
01:49:18,034 --> 01:49:23,199
You know,
I may not even know your first name,

1121
01:49:23,289 --> 01:49:25,280
but i, uh--

1122
01:49:25,374 --> 01:49:27,865
I know your son's name.

1123
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:30,747
Irena told you?

1124
01:49:30,838 --> 01:49:32,419
Yes.

1125
01:49:37,136 --> 01:49:38,546
Can I say his name?

1126
01:49:41,849 --> 01:49:42,838
David.

1127
01:49:45,061 --> 01:49:49,976
Saying his name won't bring him back.

1128
01:49:50,066 --> 01:49:51,431
What are you trying to do,

1129
01:49:51,525 --> 01:49:52,605
give me the will to live?

1130
01:49:52,693 --> 01:49:54,103
Is that it?

1131
01:49:54,111 --> 01:49:55,817
Stop me from giving up?

1132
01:49:55,905 --> 01:49:57,645
And are you giving up?

1133
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:00,231
In the camps,
some saw death as freedom.

1134
01:50:00,326 --> 01:50:03,739
Then why didn't you
just kill yourseif?

1135
01:50:03,829 --> 01:50:06,241
Survival was a kind of protest.

1136
01:50:06,332 --> 01:50:09,415
Being alive was my punishment.

1137
01:50:09,502 --> 01:50:11,834
Punishment for what?

1138
01:50:11,921 --> 01:50:14,583
I brought David to Russia.

1139
01:50:22,098 --> 01:50:25,511
And now no one can forgive you.

1140
01:50:25,601 --> 01:50:27,933
And you can't forgive yourself.

1141
01:50:30,564 --> 01:50:35,103
Irena told me...

1142
01:50:35,194 --> 01:50:37,810
that they tortured your wife...

1143
01:50:40,074 --> 01:50:42,565
and she informed on you.

1144
01:50:48,291 --> 01:50:49,781
Yes.

1145
01:50:49,875 --> 01:50:53,618
They did the same thing to my boy.

1146
01:50:53,713 --> 01:50:56,546
Then they shot him in the head.

1147
01:51:03,556 --> 01:51:05,387
My wife is alive.

1148
01:51:08,102 --> 01:51:09,717
She lived--

1149
01:51:09,812 --> 01:51:15,648
and was released. That much I know.

1150
01:51:15,735 --> 01:51:18,067
But she'll never be able
to forgive herseif

1151
01:51:18,154 --> 01:51:20,861
for what she's done.

1152
01:51:20,865 --> 01:51:24,153
You see, only I can do that.

1153
01:51:24,243 --> 01:51:27,235
She will be torturing herself,
just like you.

1154
01:51:27,330 --> 01:51:31,369
So you see, I have to get back.

1155
01:51:31,459 --> 01:51:34,792
I-have-to-get-back.

1156
01:52:01,989 --> 01:52:03,650
Janusz.

1157
01:52:12,124 --> 01:52:14,115
Pack your things, quick.

1158
01:53:45,301 --> 01:53:48,668
[dog barking]

1159
01:53:48,679 --> 01:53:50,215
Janusz!

1160
01:54:36,477 --> 01:54:37,887
(Janusz) Do you hear that?

1161
01:54:37,978 --> 01:54:39,013
[flapping]

1162
01:54:39,104 --> 01:54:40,184
What is that?

1163
01:55:09,635 --> 01:55:11,045
[flapping]

1164
01:55:22,189 --> 01:55:23,474
Tibet.

1165
01:55:23,566 --> 01:55:26,057
[laughing]

1166
01:55:55,764 --> 01:55:58,130
[man speaking native language]

1167
01:55:58,225 --> 01:56:00,591
[all repeat]

1168
01:56:06,108 --> 01:56:07,439
Lhasa.

1169
01:56:13,324 --> 01:56:14,985
(Janusz) And where is India?

1170
01:56:14,992 --> 01:56:17,779
(man) Mmmm.

1171
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:19,610
[man speaking native language]

1172
01:56:21,707 --> 01:56:22,992
India.

1173

[speaking native language]

1174
01:56:59,411 --> 01:57:01,743
India. Yes.

1175
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:06,369
There is the track to Sikkim,
over the mountains.

1176
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:08,542
Many people go there.

1177
01:57:08,629 --> 01:57:10,745
Are there villages on the way?

1178
01:57:10,839 --> 01:57:12,875
Small villages, yes.

1179
01:57:12,883 --> 01:57:14,714
They give you food.

1180
01:57:14,802 --> 01:57:17,043
Fuel for fire.

1181
01:57:17,054 --> 01:57:19,466
But you can't go now.

1182
01:57:19,556 --> 01:57:20,966
Why?

1183
01:57:21,058 --> 01:57:24,892
If big snow comes, very difficult.

1184
01:57:24,895 --> 01:57:28,934
You wait until spring.

1185
01:57:29,024 --> 01:57:31,310
This family keep you.

1186
01:57:36,448 --> 01:57:39,190
Well, we can't cross
the mountains in winter.

1187
01:57:39,284 --> 01:57:42,242
(Janusz)
He said it was difficult
but not impossible.

1188
01:57:42,246 --> 01:57:43,952
Janusz, it's only three months.

1189
01:57:44,039 --> 01:57:46,405
Look, we can't let go.

1190
01:57:46,417 --> 01:57:48,157
What do you mean?

1191
01:57:48,252 --> 01:57:51,870
If we stop now, then we'll give
In to exhaustion.

1192
01:57:51,964 --> 01:57:54,080
No, it's not giving in.

1193
01:57:54,174 --> 01:57:57,416
We are exhausted.

1194
01:57:57,428 --> 01:58:00,261
I will sleep till
spring like a bear in a cave.

1195
01:58:00,264 --> 01:58:03,597
You can study Buddhism
and become a monk.

1196
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:07,639
But first you must learn
how to like their tea.

1197
01:58:07,730 --> 01:58:10,062
I already like the tea.

1198
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:11,434
Good night.

1199
01:58:11,525 --> 01:58:12,856
[man speaks native language]

1200
01:58:15,529 --> 01:58:17,440
What about you, Mister?

1201
01:58:17,531 --> 01:58:20,318
What are you going to do
for three or four months?

1202
01:58:23,036 --> 01:58:24,947
I'm going to Lhasa.

1203
01:58:24,955 --> 01:58:26,911
Our friend has a contact.

1204
01:58:26,999 --> 01:58:29,081
He thinks he can
get me out through China.

1205
01:58:29,168 --> 01:58:33,787
There's a U.S. military mission there.

1206
01:58:33,797 --> 01:58:35,662
Looking out for number one.

1207
01:58:35,758 --> 01:58:37,623
Isn't that what you Americans say?

1208
01:58:37,634 --> 01:58:39,750
Zoran--

1209
01:58:39,845 --> 01:58:40,960
Zoran.

1210
01:58:40,971 --> 01:58:41,960
What?

1211
01:58:42,055 --> 01:58:43,135
We escaped.

1212
01:58:46,059 --> 01:58:47,765
We made it.

1213
01:58:50,022 --> 01:58:51,262
You're right.

1214
01:58:51,356 --> 01:58:53,221
He's right.

1215
01:58:53,317 --> 01:58:57,105
Apart from a few mountains,
we are there.

1216
01:58:57,196 --> 01:58:59,107
We made it.

1217
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:00,984
Not all of us.

1218
01:59:01,074 --> 01:59:04,237
No, not all of us.

1219
01:59:09,166 --> 01:59:11,157
What are you going to do, Mister?

1220
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:12,866
When you go back home.

1221
01:59:12,961 --> 01:59:14,542
Home?

1222
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:15,995
Build Metros?

1223
01:59:16,006 --> 01:59:18,998
Might drift a while.

1224
01:59:19,009 --> 01:59:22,672
I will fight.

1225
01:59:22,763 --> 01:59:27,632
First Germans, then Russians.

1226
01:59:27,726 --> 01:59:29,341
(Zoran) And then?

1227
01:59:29,436 --> 01:59:30,721
(Zoran) Re-build your church?

1228
01:59:30,813 --> 01:59:33,350
No.

1229
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:35,601
I will die fighting.

1230
01:59:38,946 --> 01:59:41,858
I'm going to get Tomasz' pictures to a newspaper

1231
01:59:41,949 --> 01:59:44,406
or get them published somehow.

1232
01:59:44,493 --> 01:59:49,032
And then I'm going to cook his chicken

1233
01:59:49,039 --> 01:59:53,078
but with extra salt,
just--just to annoy him.

1234
01:59:55,838 --> 01:59:58,705
And you, Janusz?

1235
01:59:58,715 --> 02:00:00,876
As long as the communists
are in Poland,

1236
02:00:00,884 --> 02:00:02,670
you cannot go back.

1237
02:00:02,761 --> 02:00:06,424
They'll shoot you, Janusz.

1238
02:00:06,515 --> 02:00:11,384
I'll just, uh--keep going, you know,
until it's over.

1239
02:00:18,318 --> 02:00:20,400
I'll just keep walking.

1240
02:00:36,587 --> 02:00:37,997
He's gone.

1241
02:00:44,094 --> 02:00:46,426
