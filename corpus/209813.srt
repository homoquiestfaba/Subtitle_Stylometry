1
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:29,682
Hey, everybody,
welcome to Bull Mountain...

2
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:34,682
a slice of heaven nestled in the
cleavage of Alaska's high country.

3
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,998
It all started when a young buck
named Herbert Muntz...

4
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:42,126
saw the promise of a new life
and staked his claim to it...

5
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:46,086
the old-fashioned way...
he stole it from the Eskimos.

6
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,159
Round these parts
he became known as Papa.

7
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:53,081
Each year, Papa would say thank you
by droppin' his britches...

8
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,727
and blazin' down that mountain
bare-assed...

9
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:59,436
in one of his famous
"moonshine" runs.

10
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,643
Papa loved to ski...

11
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:04,082
and Papa loved to drink...

12
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:07,443
but most of all,
Papa loved to ski and drink...

13
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:09,438
at the same time!

14
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:14,159
Last year he died
with his boots on...

15
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:18,365
Bull Mountain!
Don't go changin'!

16
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:20,005
and not much else.

17
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:24,365
Nowadays, Papa's boy
runs the mountain...

18
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:29,282
but us locals still carry on
the freewheelin' spirit of Papa's life.

19
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:32,564
You could say that this mountain's
a lot like a woman...

20
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,922
just when you think you know
every inch of her...

21
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:40,127
and you're about to dip your skis
into some soft, deep powder...

22
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:41,481
bam!

23
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,842
You got two broke legs,
cracked ribs.

24
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:49,047
Then you pay your 20 bucks just
to let her punch your lift ticket
all over again.

25
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,241
<i>One</i>

26
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,363
<i>Two</i>

27
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:01,836
<i>Gonna get in the car</i>
<i>with a smile and the burn</i>

28
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:04,122
<i>That / put on my arm</i>
<i>the day you went away, girl</i>

29
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,563
<i>And / probably won't come</i>
<i>back around again</i>

30
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,963
<i>/'m gonna drive all night</i>
<i>through the red lights</i>

31
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,084
<i>Flyin'over the hill</i>
<i>to the county line blind</i>

32
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,159
<i>Forgetting to forget</i>
<i>that you're not mine</i>

33
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:21,280
<i>Or kiss your "apoca-lips"</i>
<i>for the last, last time</i>

34
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,927
<i>Run away, run away, </i>
<i>run away again, fine</i>

35
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:25,679
<i>Anytime you think</i>

36
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,598
<i>You've changed your mind</i>

37
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:30,485
<i>Anytime you want</i>

38
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:35,561
<i>To jump back to me</i>
<i>Anytime</i>

39
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:40,596
<i>jump back to me anytime</i>

40
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:44,123
<i>jump back to me anytime</i>

41
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,998
<i>You come back one more time anytime</i>

42
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:53,603
<i>jump back to me anytime</i>

43
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:57,919
<i>jump back to me anytime</i>

44
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:02,596
<i>Come back one more time anytime</i>

45
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,877
<i>Got no time, reason or rhyme</i>

46
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:10,322
<i>Not gonna stop</i>
<i>gonna ride all night</i>

47
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,682
<i>Got no time, reason or rhyme</i>

48
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:16,203
<i>- Not gonna stop</i>
<i>gonna ride all night</i>
<i>-Anytime</i>

49
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:20,599
<i>jump back to me anytime</i>

50
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:27,158
<i>jump back to me anytime</i>

51
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:31,399
<i>jump back to me anytime</i>

52
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,365
<i>Come back one more time</i>

53
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,041
<i>Kiss your "apoca-lips"</i>
<i>for the last, last time</i>

54
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:39,118
<i>Run away, run away</i>
<i>run away again, fine</i>

55
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,437
<i>Kiss your "apoca-lips"</i>
<i>for the last, last time</i>

56
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:44,678
<i>Run away, run away</i>
<i>run, run, run, jump</i>

57
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:49,325
<i>For the last, last time</i>

58
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:52,365
<i>jump, go</i>

59
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,358
<i>For the last, last time</i>

60
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:09,802
- Bang.
- News flash.

61
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:12,765
- Muntz is selling the mountain.
- The entire mountain?
- Yes.

62
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:15,156
Why... Why would he wanna
get rid of this place?

63
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:16,999
I love this place
exactly the way it is.

64
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:20,318
Maybe the buyer can supply the mountain
with what it really needs...

65
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:22,602
- Hot friggin' chicks!
- Whoa! Whoa! Hey, guys.

66
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:25,042
Guys, you know, more girls?

67
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:27,880
Let's give Lance a chance, all right?
I gotta refuel the tanks.

68
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:32,918
- Hey, yo, Jenny, what's going on?
- Hey, Jenny!
- Jenny!

69
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,918
- Hey.
- Jenny.
- What's up, guys?

70
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,123
What, you drinkin' without me?

71
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:40,403
- Oh!
- Hey, Lance.
- Hey, girlfriend.

72
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:43,126
- Whatcha drinkin'?
- Whatever the lady would like,
just, uh...

73
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,283
put it on my tab.

74
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,403
I will have a beer, then.

75
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:52,479
And five shots of Goldschlager, please.

76
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,035
Rick, you are an idiot
not to go for Jenny...

77
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,641
and don't give me
this "broken heart" rigmarole.

78
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:04,676
Are you sniffing me?

79
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,956
- There you go.
- Thank you.

80
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,446
- Thank you.
- Yep.

81
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,156
Oh, man. If I was her, I'd be gettin'
with every dude on this mountain.

82
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,680
- Hey, boys.
- Hey.
- All right.

83
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,201
- It's on Eric.
- Cheers, big ears.
- Thank you, Eric.
- Good lookin' out, Eric.

84
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:25,117
You're nuts.

85
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:27,926
- People...
- Uh-oh.

86
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:30,123
and Pig Pen,
my poor excuse for a brother.

87
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:36,236
- My boy Rick here has been bitching
and moaning all week long...
- I have not.

88
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:39,205
and I think it's time that we
do something to cheer him up.

89
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:42,324
- Don't you agree?
- Perhaps tonight is the night...

90
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:44,318
that we crown this year's...

91
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:47,285
King of the Mountain.

92
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:50,359
- Did somebody just say King of
the Mountain, mountain, mountain?
- King of the Mountain.

93
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:52,802
King of the Mountain. Oh, say it.
King of the Mountain.

94
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:54,479
King of the Mountain.
King of the Mountain.

95
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,956
King of the Mountain.

96
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,037
- I know you wanna defend your title.
- Yeah!

97
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,879
- Oh, yeah.
- If I must.

98
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:03,446
We're doin' King of the Mountain!

99
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,244
Good evening.

100
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,318
You all know the rules
of King of the Mountain.

101
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:12,320
Rule number one: You do not talk
about King of the Mountain.

102
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,841
- Ooh.
- Rule number two:

103
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:17,999
- There are no rules.
- Uh, what about rule number one?

104
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:21,882
That's more of a guideline
than a rule. Do not interrupt!

105
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:24,242
- All right.
- And now...

106
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:26,318
the three-peat champion
of King of the Mountain...

107
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:27,806
Rick Rambis. Richard.

108
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,799
Ow! Time to pass the title, turkey!

109
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:33,276
Okay, here's how it works.
Everyone must have a beer.

110
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,479
- Got a beer?
- Got a beer?
- Got a beer.

111
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,559
Okay, it's a race to the bottom.
The first one to the statue
of Papa Muntz...

112
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:42,525
with the most beer
in your glass... Pig Pen...

113
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,645
shall be proclaimed
this year's King of the Mountain...

114
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:50,198
and as an added bonus, you also win
the contents of Eric's stolen wallet,
which are, Luke...

115
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:53,279
- Two bucks, condom...
- Nice!

116
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:55,483
- Expiration date: 1 99 7...
- Ow!

117
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:58,365
and a picture of his grandma...
no, that's, uh, Nancy Reagan.

118
00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:00,085
- Oh!
- Nancy Reagan.
- Yes!

119
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:03,318
But most importantly, pushing, shoving
and cheating are encouraged.

120
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:06,524
- Whoo!
- Anthony...

121
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,598
try not to wipe out
like you did last year.

122
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,882
And the year before,
and both years before that.

123
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,719
- Thanks, Luke.
I really appreciate that.
- No problem.

124
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,117
- Pig Pen, if you would.
- Strap 'em in.

125
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:18,516
On your marks, get set.

126
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:23,156
- Everybody ready?
- Tetsuo!

127
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:27,001
- Go! Bunch of suckers!
- Pig Pen, you cheater!

128
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:28,805
Not tonight, Pig Pen!

129
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,925
- You're the man, Anthony!
- <i>You're running fast and missing</i>

130
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:45,396
- Don't wipe out.
- <i>But cannot help convincing</i>
- Don't wipe out.

131
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:49,799
- Don't wipe out. Here I go, baby!
<i>- The reasons you gave me</i>
<i>are all wearing thin</i>

132
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:54,199
<i>/t's not meant to hurt you</i>
<i>but let me assure you</i>

133
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,518
<i>/t's not what /'ve said</i>
<i>but intentions you've read</i>

134
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:02,556
<i>- So when you hold onto</i>
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

135
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,717
<i>- The past then you</i>
- Damn! Damn!

136
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:07,037
<i>- Will break down what little is left</i>
- Damn!

137
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,643
- Yeah!
- <i>/t makes no difference to me</i>

138
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:21,084
<i>When you hold onto</i>

139
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,558
- Whoo-hoo!
<i>- The past then you</i>
<i>will break down what little is left</i>

140
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:29,640
<i>- Yeah, there's nothing more</i>
- Get away from my beer, Pig Pen!

141
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:34,437
<i>You can't ignore</i>
<i>And say it makes no difference to me</i>

142
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:35,880
Stop!

143
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:51,526
Whoa, shit!

144
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:55,441
- Whoo!
<i>- Yeah, there's nothing more</i>

145
00:08:55,527 --> 00:09:00,999
<i>You can't ignore</i>
<i>/t makes no difference to me</i>

146
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:06,240
- <i>/t makes no difference to me</i>
- Ride 'em, cowboy!
- Oh!

147
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:10,286
<i>- /t makes no difference to me</i>
- Move it!

148
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,403
<i>/t makes no difference</i>

149
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,685
- Hey, Pig Pen!
<i>- Yeah, there's nothing more</i>

150
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:21,443
<i>You can't ignore</i>
<i>And say it makes no difference to me</i>

151
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,878
Don't let him pass!
Don't let him pass!

152
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,925
We got him, Jenny!

153
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:39,079
<i>- /t makes no difference</i>
- Go, go, go, go, go!
Come on! We're gonna beat him!

154
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,000
<i>/t makes no difference to me</i>

155
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,123
Where did he come from?

156
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,000
- Whoo!
- Yeah. Come on.

157
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:53,645
His mug's empty.
His mug's empty.

158
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:57,003
- Whoa. Your beer.
- I got beer. I got beer. I got...

159
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:58,759
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

160
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:02,726
- Oh! Come on!
- No way! No way!

161
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:09,725
Time to kiss up to the king now.
Kiss up to me now.

162
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:13,686
- Goin' to drink, everybody!
- Well, actually, I have to turn in.

163
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,359
I have to give Mr Mays
a snowboard lesson in the morning.

164
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:18,280
Yeah, I got, uh, fag practice
in the morning. So I understand.

165
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:23,007
- Walk me home, Your Highness.
- Oh!

166
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:25,203
- All right!
- <i>¡Ay! ¡Ay! </i>

167
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:28,802
- Ohhh.
- Ohhh.
- Ohhh.

168
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,161
Whoo! Hey-hey!

169
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:42,239
Hey, no, guys, stop!
Stop it!

170
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:45,763
If you're planning on coming up
with some lame-ass excuse...

171
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:49,203
to get into my house
just so we can "hook up"...

172
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,766
I might let you.

173
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:53,361
Not that you're being
particularly charming or anything.

174
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:57,998
I guess it's the moonlight and a bottle
of Goldschlager that just brings out
the romance in a girl.

175
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:03,158
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

176
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,761
You broke up with your boyfriend
this summer, right?

177
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:08,566
- Yeah.
- Well...

178
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,400
Are we about to have
another conversation about how
you're still on the rebound?

179
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:15,678
- I guess not.
- Look, Rick, I feel for you
'cause I've been through it...

180
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,486
but it's time to move on.

181
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:22,355
Okay, the general rule of thumb
is one week of mourning for every
six months you were together.

182
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,484
So, you were together,
what, two weeks?

183
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,205
Three weeks.

184
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,323
Oh, okay. Three weeks.
So then that means...

185
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,046
I get it. I get it.
You're right.

186
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,561
- It's stupid.
- Yes, it is.

187
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:37,559
So, still wanna hook up?

188
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:40,636
You're gonna have to try
a lot harder than that, Rick.

189
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,324
So, you still wanna hook up?

190
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,325
- How's that, huh?
- Goodnight.

191
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,079
Goodnight.

192
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:53,601
- See ya tomorrow.
- Later.

193
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:56,360
Oh, hey, listen, uh, you better
enjoy your reign as king now...

194
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:59,200
because next year,
Queen of the Mountain, baby.

195
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:01,243
We'll see about that.

196
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,920
Passed out again.

197
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:04,918
Fire!

198
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,445
Well, boys, what's it gonna be
tonight? We gonna shave his eyebrows?

199
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,483
Passé. Done that, took pictures.

200
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:17,121
I'm gonna need a bucket,
a paintbrush and ten pounds of salt.

201
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:19,163
Lance, get his pants.

202
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:23,126
- Where you taking this guy?
- Come on!

203
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:25,118
Let's drop his fat ass.

204
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,118
Get him.

205
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,358
Oh! Ow!

206
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:16,715
Shoo. Shoo!

207
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,560
Get! Shoo.

208
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:23,003
Good boy. I mean, girl.
Good girl. Good girl. Yeah.

209
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,403
Fu... Ow, my ass is numb.

210
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:32,205
Look alive, Eric.

211
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,923
John Majors. Ted Muntz.

212
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:50,282
It's so good to finally
meet you in person.

213
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:52,358
Welcome to Bull Mountain.

214
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:54,483
You know, the Eskimos
around here have a saying:

215
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,086
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, Nanook.

216
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,556
You're gonna give yourself
an aneurysm.

217
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,678
Oh, you smell that, boys?

218
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:12,558
Smells like money. Oh, this place
has got some serious potential.

219
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,241
Oh, yeah, I can see it now, huh?
Can you see it? Huh?

220
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,283
Condominiums, eateries, shopping...

221
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,165
wine bars, cigar bars...
what the hell, bar bars.

222
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:24,796
Yeah, we can... we can totally sell
this... this whole rustic bit.

223
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,843
Oh, yeah.
This is a diamond in the rough.

224
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:29,521
Ooh, that's good.
Write that down for the brochure.

225
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:32,440
Now, wait, wait. Better yet.
"Black diamond in the rough."

226
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:34,563
You know, sort of a ski thing.

227
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,605
- I'm Eric, by the way.
- Yeah, well, who asked you?

228
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:41,121
Ah, just kiddin', short stack.

229
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:44,005
- It's, uh, some mountain, huh?
- Yeah, but the name.

230
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:47,045
Bull Mountain. It's, uh...
It's a little too...

231
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,684
shitty.

232
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,962
Y-You wanna rename the mountain?

233
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,844
Yeah, somethin' good.

234
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,760
I'm gonna have to polish this turd
if I'm gonna sell my investors on it.

235
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:01,556
I mean, your hotel looks like a Motel 6
ate a yard sale and barfed it out.

236
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:04,480
Hey, Muntz, there's some
really pissed off Eskimos
outside right now, man.

237
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,081
- They say they want their land back.
- Very funny, Rambis.

238
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:11,001
Mr Majors, this is Rick Rambis,
one of our low-to-mid-level employees.

239
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:15,080
- You must be the big hotshot
who's gonna buy the mountain.
- John Majors of Major Resorts.

240
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:18,079
Rick Rambis of, uh, Rick Rambis.

241
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,920
You any good
on that board there, son?

242
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,043
- I'm all right.
- You wouldn't mind
playin' tour guide...

243
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:24,958
to an old fart like me, would ya?

244
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:27,686
Actually, Rick's got
a pretty heavy workload tomorrow...

245
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,076
but I would be delighted
to show you around the mountain.

246
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,919
No offence, short stack,
but you give me the creeps.

247
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,043
I think Rick here
will do just fine.

248
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:36,118
- You don't mind, do ya, Rick?
- No problem.

249
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:38,118
Good. First thing in the morning.

250
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:40,960
I'll take a Geritol
so I can keep up.

251
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:43,003
Hey, chop-chop
with them bags there.

252
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,760
- So what does this mean,
selling the mountain?
- I don't know.

253
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:50,637
Maybe this guy will be cool.
You know, maybe he'll help us
build a lift up to Hangman's Peak.

254
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:53,366
- Can you get an STD from a polar bear?
- What is your brother doing?

255
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:57,037
Pig Pen!

256
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,004
Pig Pen!

257
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:08,358
- What do we got, Whitey?
- Solid Gold Dancers
trapped on Beaver Mountain!

258
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,005
Somebody, help us!

259
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:13,159
- Looks pretty hairy, sir.
- Just the way I like it!

260
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:17,120
Lock 'em and load 'em, boys!

261
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,557
I'm goin' in!

262
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,237
Whoo!

263
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:40,483
- What are we gonna do?
- Ya-hoo!

264
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,163
Whoo!

265
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:01,358
Yeah!

266
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:07,076
Wa-hoo!
Ha-ha-hoo!

267
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:18,325
- My stomach is freezing.
- We're saved

268
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:24,199
Good morning, ladies.
The name's Pen.

269
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,435
- Pig Pen.
- Oh, he's so sexy.

270
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:34,679
I need everybody to be calm
and take your tops off.

271
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:40,323
And tie them together. Now! Move!
I've no time to discuss this!

272
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:45,115
Wicked!

273
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:47,721
You. Grab me around my waist.

274
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:51,197
Lower. Nice. You, the door.
Get the door.

275
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,721
- Ooh.
- Faster, faster.
- Oh, it's stuck.

276
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,843
Just jiggle it.

277
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,842
It's gonna be okay, ladies.
Jiggle more.

278
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:07,877
You have to jiggle the handle.
Jiggle it.

279
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,878
Jiggle it! Jiggle it!

280
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:13,078
- Jiggle it.
- Open the door, Pig Pen.

281
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:15,078
- Oh, yes.
- Open the door. Come on, man.

282
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,557
- Jiggle it.
- Open the door, open the door,
open the door. Pig Pen!

283
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:21,207
- Pig Pen!
- Jiggle it.

284
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:24,962
- I'm coming.
- Oh, he's had a crush on that bench
for a long time.

285
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,158
Did you enjoy your nap?

286
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:37,237
<i>By the way, you know that hope</i>
<i>will make you strange</i>

287
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,761
<i>Make you blink, make you blank</i>
<i>make you sink</i>

288
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:43,556
<i>/t will make you afraid of change</i>
<i>enough to play... </i>

289
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,798
So, Rick, did you
hit it last night, or what?

290
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:49,242
Nah, man, we just talked.

291
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:55,199
God. You know, maybe
we should clarify something.

292
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:58,643
When you won the race last night,
that made you King of the Mountain...

293
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:01,241
not king of the no-ball,
pussy losers.

294
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:04,080
They already have their own king.
My brother.

295
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,759
What?

296
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:08,680
Are you still hung up on Anna?

297
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:12,646
Here's what I don't get, all right,
is you met this chick...

298
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:15,287
- And you got freaky-deaky with her...
- Hey.

299
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,880
and then, poof, she disappears.

300
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,481
How's there a problem with that?

301
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:22,877
Pig Pen, when I want advice
about a good <i>Planet of the Apes</i> film...

302
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:27,563
or maybe how to get the resin
out of my bong, I'll come to you, okay?

303
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:29,603
- Okay.
- But I am not gonna take
romantic advice...

304
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,996
from somebody who cannot spell
"romantic" or "advice."

305
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:35,484
- Or "bong."
- Listen, man.

306
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,876
I just wanna hear the story,
that's all.

307
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,686
I mean, you've never even
told me it, not even once.

308
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,803
Well, if I tell you, will you
promise to shut up about it?

309
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:44,320
No.

310
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:47,245
Okay.

311
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,046
Well, I met her
at the most beautiful...

312
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:54,166
romantic place on Earth:
Cancún, Mexico.

313
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:57,125
There was this little cantina
called Pedro O'Horny's.

314
00:19:57,207 --> 00:19:59,801
Me and Luke, see, we had
just shown up, and I saw her.

315
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:07,359
From the moment we caught eyes, I knew
she wasn't like the other girls there.

316
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:12,604
<i>- When you're on a holiday</i>
- She was French, she had her top on...

317
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:14,484
- Plus she wasn't puking.
- Drink, drink, drink!

318
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,637
Drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink!

319
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:19,878
Drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink!

320
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,161
Yeah!

321
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:24,045
<i>And / wanna feel it too</i>

322
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:27,039
<i>On an island in the sun</i>

323
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,482
We spent every day together
for three weeks.

324
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,924
It was like heaven,
but you couldn't drink the water.

325
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:36,237
And then one day she asked me to go on
one of them tandem bike rides...

326
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:39,319
<i>- / can't control my brain</i>
- But she never showed up.

327
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:45,284
<i>- Hip hip</i>
- I never saw Anna again.

328
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:49,285
- Who?
- God, dumb...
- Ow!

329
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:51,358
- Hey!
- Pig Pen!

330
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,961
- Guys.
- A little sensitivity here!

331
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:57,278
God! Can't you see
this is a dejected man?

332
00:20:57,367 --> 00:21:00,325
Well, Rick get your dejected head
out of your ass.

333
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:02,796
Papa Muntz wanted you
to run this mountain.

334
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,436
Yeah. <i>Carpe</i> the <i>diem! </i>

335
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:08,995
Seize the carp.

336
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:13,124
- "Seize the carp"?
- What?

337
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:14,526
Ow!

338
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:19,197
Make sure you bundle up,
'cause it is freezin' out there, okay?

339
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:22,643
Hey, Toby.
Let me check your boots.

340
00:21:22,727 --> 00:21:25,082
- You're good now.
- Thanks, Jenny.
- You're welcome.

341
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,761
Hey, Jenny, um, do you think
you could tie up my boots?

342
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:29,997
Stewart, I-I think you can
do up your own boots.

343
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:32,806
Well, you know, I kinda like
the way you do it.

344
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:36,766
- Okay, how 'bout I do up one
and you do the other?
- Cool.

345
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,039
<i>- The rabbit and the moose was fast... </i>
- Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.

346
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:44,836
- I can do without the song, you know?
- I kinda like the song, Stewart.

347
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:46,724
- What's up, Rick?
- What's up, dude?

348
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,037
Get outta here.
You're welcome.

349
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:51,482
You're pretty good
with these kids, Jenny.

350
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:56,118
- Yeah? I seem to have a thing
for immature boys.
- Ouch.

351
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:59,483
At least Stewart has his act
together enough to ask me out.

352
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,684
I think we're checking out a movie
right after his nap time. Yes.

353
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:05,327
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

354
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,796
Would you, um...

355
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:10,845
- Would I...
- Would you like to have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

356
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:17,437
I'm sorry. It sounded like you were
askin' me out on a date.

357
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:20,166
We could meet at the inn.
Say 8:00?

358
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,681
- Yes.
- Right now I have to go
seize the carp.

359
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,803
- Wish me luck.
- I'll see you there.

360
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:30,002
- Mornin', Mr Majors.
- Oh, please, please.

361
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,362
My daddy was Mr Majors.

362
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:35,598
Actually, he was Mr Mankowitz.
Just call me John.

363
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,326
Okay, John.
Well, where do you wanna start?

364
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:41,638
- Most people can't do
the whole mountain in one day.
- Yeah, well, I ain't most people.

365
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,797
You try and keep up there, hotshot.

366
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:02,325
Hey, Pig Pen. You ever been on
one of those lesbian chat rooms?

367
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:05,762
- Are they good?
- I don't know.
- No.

368
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,196
See that up there?
That's Hangman's Peak.

369
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:13,324
- Damn. You ski that?
- Yeah. It's awesome.

370
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,841
But, as you can tell,
it's almost impossible to hike.

371
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:20,079
I think that if we put a lift
to the top, it would be the most popular
snowboard park in the entire country.

372
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:24,479
Well, you know, Rick,
what I'll do is I'll think on that,
uh, 'cause I like your style.

373
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,240
- And I might need a little help.
- Yeah?

374
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:30,558
- What for?
- Well, my investors are comin'
to check this place out...

375
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:33,081
and, uh, well,
they spook easily.

376
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:37,126
You know, if this deal's gonna
go through, this whole town's
gonna have to play ball.

377
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,482
I don't think Muntz has
the pull around here to do that...

378
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:42,604
but, uh, you do.

379
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,958
<i>- Can you hear me? </i>
- I don't know. Hopefully...

380
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:50,279
<i>Okay. As most of you have heard, </i>
<i>uh, by next week... </i>

381
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:53,245
Bull Mountain will have
new management.

382
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:56,444
I'm selling it for lots
and lots of American dollars...

383
00:23:56,527 --> 00:24:00,076
to your future boss,
Mr John Majors!

384
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:05,157
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

385
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:07,317
Thank you and good morning.

386
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:11,036
I can't tell you how happy
and excited I am to be here today.

387
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:14,039
Now, I know we're all
gonna be homies...

388
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:16,516
but I do believe
in the golden rule...

389
00:24:16,607 --> 00:24:19,838
and that is, "He who has
the gold card makes the rules."

390
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:25,239
Pipe down, retard. And to publicize
my purchase of the mountain...

391
00:24:25,327 --> 00:24:27,522
I've invited my board members...
that's the board of directors...

392
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:30,804
and my investors here
for the anniversary festival.

393
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:35,642
And as my employees, you're expected
to behave in a manner consistent
with a world-class resort.

394
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:40,403
Any questions you might have will be
answered in your new rule book...

395
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:42,876
which numbnuts here
is gonna pass out.

396
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:48,644
- I think that's you.
- And I have a super-duper
surprise for all of you.

397
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:51,116
A brand new, streamlined,
top-of-the-line...

398
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,004
high-performance uniform!

399
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:57,005
Don't sweat havin' to pay for them.
We'll just deduct the cost
from your first paycheck.

400
00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:59,647
Welcome to the Major Resort family!

401
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:02,844
There's no business
like snow business!

402
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:05,157
I told you.
You... You look great.

403
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:08,922
Well, yeah, it doesn't really
allow my dice to roll down there,
and by "dice" I mean testicles.

404
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,919
- Speaking of testicles,
let me get a beer.
- The suits are not that bad, guys.

405
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:15,363
Rick, these scuba outfits
make us look ridiculous.

406
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,358
Who does this Majors asshole
think he is?

407
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:19,642
I'm not gonna wear
this unitard, period.

408
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,797
Guys, I love Bull Mountain
as much as anyone else...

409
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,843
but a little change, you know,
it's not gonna hurt this place.

410
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:27,715
I don't know, Rick. I mean, wh-why
would we even want this place to change?

411
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:31,766
- We don't want it to turn into Aspen.
- Yeah, but have you seen
the women from Aspen?

412
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:33,075
I... No.

413
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:37,604
I mean, other than the occasional girl
who comes here on the weekend trip,
this place is a sausage factory.

414
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:41,043
There are gonna be some hotties,
some slammin' bods with...

415
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:43,038
pants so tight
it looks like they're painted on.

416
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:47,763
Man, I love chicks.
Chicks love me, so it's all good.

417
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:52,079
Calm down, Lance. Look, Muntz
is gonna sell this mountain,
and somebody's gonna buy it anyway.

418
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,237
You have $ 1 00 million?
I don't. You?

419
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:56,602
No, we're not models.

420
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:02,235
Guys, look. All I'm sayin'
is that, if we play ball,
the mountain will still be ours.

421
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,717
Oh, you foolish, foolish boys.

422
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:07,718
This is how it all starts.

423
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:11,038
I seen it all before.
I was there.

424
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:14,915
I was there.
Yeah, it was called the '80s.

425
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,999
Ford was president,
Nixon was in the White House...

426
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:21,397
and FDR was runnin' this country
into the ground.

427
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:24,206
I was bummin'
in a hole-in-the-wall town...

428
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:26,801
in what is now called Utah.

429
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:31,961
Some fella from Colorado shows up,
starts makin' so-called improvements.
Right?

430
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:35,562
- Before we knew what hit us,
the streets were runnin' with latte!
- No!

431
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:38,798
Yup. It got so bad
that a fella that liked to...

432
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:41,526
you know,
smoke a little grass...

433
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,882
or drink a little Ripple,
crow like a rooster...

434
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:46,959
maybe challenge the mayor's son
to a gentlemen's duel...

435
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:49,845
was uncouth, against God...

436
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:52,122
more like bad
for real estate values.

437
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:55,324
Stumpy had to go!
Richard...

438
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,318
be careful what you wish for.

439
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,001
- You got it, Stump.
- Be careful what you wish for.
- I will.

440
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:02,362
- All right?
- God!

441
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,200
I'm good.

442
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:07,721
Better put somethin' on that.

443
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:10,924
Welcome to our local cantina.

444
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,918
- I like to stop in and have...
- Stumpy's right.

445
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,918
We can't let them do that
to this place.

446
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:17,316
- You know, women or no women,
we've gotta stand up...
- Yes.

447
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:20,319
and I need to stop talking
for a second.

448
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:27,520
Holy sh...

449
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,437
Hey, Rick.
Get your butt over here.

450
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:38,803
No, you know, you guys are right.
This guy's really bad for business.
I'm gonna go let him know.

451
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:40,400
No, no...

452
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:44,798
Rick, this is
my stepdaughter Inga.

453
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:46,206
Hello there.

454
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:48,562
Rick, I'd like you and retard
to show me the kitchen.

455
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:51,445
Sweetheart, I got a little work to do.
Buy yourself a drink at the bar.

456
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:53,438
I won't be long.

457
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,917
- Nice space. When's his lease up?
- Oh, whenever I say it is.

458
00:27:58,007 --> 00:28:00,282
Oh, good. Hey, boys,
look good in those uniforms.

459
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:03,200
- Mr Majors.
- Yeah, the Brick!

460
00:28:03,287 --> 00:28:05,198
Sweet Jesus!

461
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:09,240
Okay, you can stop
staring about now.

462
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,959
Ya-hoo! Whoo!

463
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,961
Whoo! Oh!

464
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,401
- Boys, watch confidence at work.
- Be strong.

465
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:27,283
Oh, God, here she comes.

466
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,518
You, uh, with the...

467
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,446
What my friend's tryin' to say is
welcome to the El Matador...

468
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:39,519
which is Spanish for
"the matador."

469
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:43,919
- Want a drinky-poo?
- I was wondering if you can
make a kind of drink.

470
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:48,558
It's called... Oh, what is
the word in English for this?

471
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:50,763
- Horny-maker.
- Lance, how 'bout a beer?

472
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:53,919
- One Fuzzy Navel for the lady.
- Mm. <i>Danke. </i>

473
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,762
So you're, uh,
like Majors's daughter?

474
00:28:57,847 --> 00:29:00,361
<i>- Nein. </i> Stepdaughter.
- Oh.

475
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,996
I'm supposed to my stepsister
be meeting here.

476
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:06,647
One more Fuzzy Navel for the lady.

477
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,558
- Skol!
- Skol!
- Skol!

478
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:11,878
Hi.

479
00:29:14,807 --> 00:29:17,844
- Luke?
- My stepsister.

480
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:19,758
- It's Anna.
- Luke!

481
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:21,917
- Who?
- Oh, my God!

482
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:24,237
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

483
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:25,840
- Oh, my God.
- How are you?

484
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:27,838
- I'm fine.
- It's been a long time.

485
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:29,440
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

486
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:31,597
- I was havin' a beer.
- In Alaska?

487
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,645
- I-I-I... Well, I like cold beer, yeah.
- Does that mean... Uh, is Rick around?

488
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:36,797
Um, no.
You didn't hear? Uh...

489
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:39,640
Rick perished...

490
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:42,446
in a dog sled accident.

491
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:44,802
- Four-dog sled pileup.
- Uh-huh.

492
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:48,960
- And it's... it's... it's awful.
The dogs survived.
- You used to be a much better liar.

493
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:53,882
Anna, I don't know why you're here,
but leave him alone. Okay?

494
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:59,440
- Play it once, for old times' sake.
- Play what once?

495
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:01,882
Well, the song.

496
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,958
- The... Oh, oh, song.
- Please, play it.

497
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:05,958
Oh, okay.
Well, I think I got, uh...

498
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:08,840

502
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:19,639
- No. That's not it. Very nice, though.
<i>-And a round thing in your face... </i>
- Sure that's not it?

503
00:30:19,727 --> 00:30:22,082
- Please.
You know what song I'm talking about.
- I don't know if I can play the song.

504
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:24,123
- Please.
- I, uh, da-da-da-da-da.

- No. Oh, uh... Okay.

- Thank you.

Hey, Anna. You made it.

513
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:47,961
- Come here, kid. Give me a hug.
- Hi.

514
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,515
Ohh. Oh, sweetheart,
this is Muntz.

515
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:52,245
- Hi.
- And this bright young man is...

516
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:55,239
- Yeah, we've met.
- Hello, Rick.

517
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:57,636
- Hi, Anna.
- Uh...

518
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:59,922
Majors is your father?

519
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:04,558
Yes. He likes to say he's Napoleon
working his way across Europe.

520
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:08,196
His first wife was English, my mother
was French and Inga's mother was Swiss.

521
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:10,642
And I just hired
a Russian girl trainer. Look out.

522
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:15,882
Hey, girls, it's bedtime. We got a long
day ahead of us tomorrow. Come on, Inga.

523
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,083
- Coming, Father.
- Retard, walk me out, huh?

524
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:23,400
I didn't know you were here, Rick.
I'm... I'm really sorry.

525
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:28,678
- Anna.
- I really have to go, but...

526
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:32,555
<i>just a place to call your own</i>

527
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:36,242
<i>As we drift into the zone</i>

528
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,080
Of all the bars
in all the ski towns in Alaska...

529
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:43,957
- Why'd she have to come to this one?
<i>- We'll be playing and having fun</i>

530
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:47,164
- Thanks.
<i>-And it makes me feel so... </i>

531
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:49,204
Here you go, Jenny.
Enjoy it.

<i>/ know she knows</i>

<i>Maybe, maybe she thinks it's fine</i>

536
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:15,122
I don't think
he's coming, Jenny.

00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:18,722
<i>Or maybe she knows</i>
<i>something / don't</i>

- You got him, Lance?

541
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:31,483
- Uh-huh, I got him.
- Come on.
- Okay, go.

542
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:41,001
Get him in.
Get him in here.

543
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:44,636
- All right, that's it.
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

544
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:47,958
- Might give him a heart attack.
- As the inheritor of his estate...

545
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:50,322
I take full legal responsibility.

546
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:53,285
- Come on. Okay, everybody.
- Come on.

547
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,358
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- One, two, three.

548
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:13,764
Pitter-patter, let's "skeedadder."
Spin him.

549
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:22,438
One, two, three.

550
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:28,762

00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:39,525
- Oh, God.
- Oh, help us, Lord.
- Shit.

00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:41,598
Oh. Oh.

All right! Whoo!

557
00:33:57,607 --> 00:33:59,643
This is what you're gonna do
to Bull Mountain, huh?

558
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:02,639
No, no, no, no.
Snownook.

559
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:06,197
- "Snownook"?
- Yeah, that's the name
my people say tested the best.

560
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:14,239

how I invented snowboarding?
- Oh, yeah?

Wait. Hold up.

- I can explain everything.
- Relax.

575
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,318
I stopped by the bar last night.
Pig Pen told me.

576
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:10,126
Look, I'm really,
really sorry about that.

577
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:12,402
I will make it up to you

Oh. Uh, so that means
you're not mad at me?

581
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:27,002
Oh, yeah, I am.
I'll get over it, though.

Well, look,
I really am sorry.

- Uh, yeah. I think so.

615

Anthony, is that you?

616
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:22,955
Can you go get some ice
from the bar?

617
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:26,042
This is Alaska. You're sittin'
on ice, little leprechaun.

618
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:29,915
- Ohhh.
- Yes, go, Anthony.
I will wait here with him.

619

Damn him!
Man, he always does this.

620
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:34,837

- Everywhere.

621
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:55,321
"Duck"?

622
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:59,802
Come in. Come in.

623
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:04,357
- Make yourself at home.
Just don't hit me any more in my nuts.
- Sorry. Oh, my God.

624
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:09,325
- This is good?
- Oh, yes, this is very, very good.

625
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:11,079
Tell me, where did you
get these scars?

626
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:12,646
- Well, let's see.
- Oh!

627
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:14,797

00:41:18,847 --> 00:41:22,283
I bet each one
has its own exciting story. No?

631
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:26,155
No, not really. I skateboarded
off a truck into a fire hydrant.

632
00:41:26,247 --> 00:41:29,159
I never met an American boy before.

633
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:32,478
Are you all so wild?

634
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:35,639
Yeah. We have a saying
around here.

635
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,525
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, "No brains, no headache."

636
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:43,843
- We have saying in Switzerland too.
- Yeah?

637
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:46,077
No swimsuit...

638
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:49,439
no tan lines.

639
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:54,397
We have another saying around here.

640
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:56,284
- Uh-huh, what's that?
- I don't know.

641
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:00,406
I didn't mean to leave you
like that in Mexico.

642
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:03,240
I'm sorry. I just...
Believe me, I had to.

643
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:06,524
Why? Some other guy come
sweep you off your feet?

644
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,882
- You were the other guy.
- I don't understand.

645
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:11,845
I'm engaged.
I was engaged when I met you.

646
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:13,838
And I love him, Rick.
I really do.

647
00:42:13,927 --> 00:42:15,918
And when I met you...

648
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:17,918
I don't know. I just...

649
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:21,795
I fell in love with you, too, I guess.
I didn't know what to do.

650
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:26,202
Ay! It's no problem.
Don't worry about it.

651
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:29,677
You know, I had, like, ten other
engaged chicks fall for me that week,
too, so I barely even...

652
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:33,237
- Which one were you, the brunette?
- Please, I wanted to say goodbye
to you and tell you everything...

653
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:35,966
but when the time came to do it...

654
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:38,322
I didn't think I'd be able to,
so I left.

655
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:44,480
But I really did fall for you.
That's why I left.

656
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:51,802
Well, there. I said what I had to say,
so, uh, I'm going now.

657
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:56,006
W-Wait.

658
00:42:57,447 --> 00:43:01,486
Look. I'm sorry too, okay?
For being a prick.

659
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:04,957
You know, it's just that I was
a little, you know, bummed out.

660
00:43:05,047 --> 00:43:06,799
I deserved it.
It's okay.

661
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,923
You did.

662
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:13,835
- You want some coffee or something?
- That would be really nice.

663
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,122
Yeah! Ooh, yeah!

664
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:21,560
All this making up
is a lot of fun.

665
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:25,481
But I'm ready. How do...
How do you say to <i>schlafenszeit? </i>

666
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,798
Oh, yeah, <i>schlafenszeit. </i>
Anything you say.

667
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:38,843
No, no, no.
Wh-What are you doing?

668
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:41,202
<i>Schlafenszeit. </i>
Sleepy time.

669
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:43,198
- I'm going to bed now.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

670
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,916
- I'm sleepy.
- Oh, no, no, stay. We'll cuddle.

671
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:48,326
We'll cuddle.

672
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:51,285
We'll cuddle.

673
00:43:52,727 --> 00:43:54,445
Goodnight.

674
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,883
<i>Ooh, /'m falling</i>

675
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:04,765
<i>/'m falling in love</i>

676
00:44:04,847 --> 00:44:06,519
<i>With you</i>

677
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:24,959
So, uh...

678
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:28,801
- Your fiancé.
- Barry. He's, uh, in medical school.

679
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:30,798
He's flying up
in a couple of days to see me.

680
00:44:30,887 --> 00:44:34,118
Well, that's gonna be a little tricky,
unless he's a pilot too.

681
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:38,555
He's a pilot too.
He's a doctor and a pilot.

682
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:39,796
Yeah.

683
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:42,845
I think I wanna have sex
with this guy.

684
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:46,558
I have to go now.

685
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:48,956
- Yeah. Let me show you out.
- Okay.

686
00:44:52,727 --> 00:44:54,399
I just, um...

687
00:44:54,487 --> 00:44:58,275
I want you to know
that I am happy for you.

688
00:44:58,367 --> 00:45:03,282
And this Barry guy is, is lucky.

689
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,085
Thank you.

690
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:07,645
Goodnight.

691
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:12,675
<i>What would you think of me now</i>

692
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:17,441
<i>- So lucky, so strong, so proud</i>
- Go.
- Yeah. Bye.

693
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:22,796
<i>/ never said thank you for that</i>

694
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:26,196
<i>Now /'ll never have a chance</i>

695
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:30,724
<i>May angels lead you in</i>

696
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:35,156
<i>May angels lead you in</i>

697
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:44,080
Hey.

698
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:49,245
Oh, my God.

699
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:52,523
You need...
You need help, don't you?

700
00:45:52,607 --> 00:45:54,757
Uh, j-just a sec.

701
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:01,645
How's the hot tub, Luke?

702
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:06,403
You know, the Eskimo have nine words
for a helmet stuck in a hot tub.

703
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:09,638
Hell, they only got
eight words for snow.

704
00:46:11,847 --> 00:46:13,280
There we go.

705
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:15,085
Yeah.

706
00:46:19,287 --> 00:46:21,721
Oh, yeah!

707
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:25,117
Yeah. Physics, really.

708
00:46:25,207 --> 00:46:27,801
Expansion and contraction.

709
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:30,606
Oh. All right.

710
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:34,646
Right here.
One, two...

711
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:36,206
three.

712
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:43,159
Yeah!

713
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:46,239
Whoo! Was it worth it?

714
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,805
- Rough night?
- I've had worse.

715
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:55,765
Thanks.

716
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,283
Anna's getting married...

717
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:07,803
to some rich, asswipe
doctor dude named Barry.

718
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:10,162
- He's coming in day after tomorrow.
- Ouch!

719
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:13,557
- Thanks, man.
- No, I got molested by a hot tub
last night.

720
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:16,207
- It's a long story.
- Oh.

721
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:19,404
You know what I really hate
about this chick is that I... I think...

722
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:23,002
I know that I'm in love with her,
and it sucks.

723
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:25,521
- Well, have you told her this?
- No, not really.

724
00:47:25,607 --> 00:47:29,486
Well, listen, you've got to. And you
gotta do it before it's too late...

725
00:47:29,567 --> 00:47:33,116
before she becomes
Mrs Doctor Asswipe.

726
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:35,277
Otherwise, you're gonna
regret it your whole life.

727
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:37,881
No regrets:
that's my motto.

728
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:41,323
That and
"Everybody Wang Chung tonight."

729
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:43,716
You know what? You're right.

730
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:47,838
You are absolutely right.

731
00:47:47,927 --> 00:47:50,487
I'm not gonna
let Anna get away again.

732
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,161
When this Barry guy gets here,
I'm gonna have to face him.

733
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:56,922
And I'm gonna look at him,
I'm gonna tell him
like a sensible, mature adult...

734
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,963
"Finders keepers,
losers weepers, pal."

735
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:07,720
- I'll have to work on that one, but...
- And if he doesn't like it...

736
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:09,126
we'll kick his ass.

737
00:48:09,207 --> 00:48:11,402
Definitely.

738
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:13,318
<i>Attention, all guests. </i>

739
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:17,045
Where's Jenny?

740
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,118
- Come on. You're going back in line.
- I don't wanna go.

741
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:21,846
Hey, fellas.
Great day, isn't it?

742
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:25,400
Man, who the hell are you?

743
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:27,398
I'm the new Team Snownook
patrol leader.

744
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,762
Keepin' it real,
while keepin' it safe.

745
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:33,237
<i>You on the roof, </i>
<i>knock off the grab-ass. </i>

746
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,683
- What the hell is going on here?
<i>- Don't you eyeball me! </i>

747
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:39,884
Hey, Luke, why don't you mind
your own beeswax...

748
00:48:39,967 --> 00:48:43,516
before my fist makes an appointment
with your ass?

749
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:48,801
Eric, have you ever noticed
that you're always talking about
putting something up my ass?

750
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:51,117
And that time
it wasn't even a threat.

751
00:48:51,207 --> 00:48:53,846
- Technically, that was flirting.
- Hey, grab them for me.

752
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,639
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

753
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:04,197
Where you going with the bull?
Eric. Eric!

754
00:49:04,287 --> 00:49:06,164
<i>Talk to the horn. </i>

755
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:07,839
Where are you taking the bull?

756
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:10,077
Listen. I have had it
with these jackass employees of yours.

757
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:13,318
This morning there was a boy with
his little Elvis stuck in my hot tub.

758
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:16,319
- Now, how in the hell does that happen?
- Well, the jets can feel quite nice...

759
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:18,921
Stop talking.
Effective immediately...

760
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:20,918
I'm taking some steps
to clean this place up.

761
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:23,043
Poured out a perfectly good beer.

762
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,118
And that Czech guy over here decides...

763
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:26,925
Mm, I love that smell.

764
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:30,124
That's the smell
of you all getting fired.

765
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:32,084
- What?
- Fired? What?

766
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:33,805
Welcome to your first
random drug test.

767
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,596
- I'll need you to fill these cups.
- Go make tinkle, or it's your job.

768
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:40,281
I don't have to write a test
to tell you that I take drugs.

769
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:44,485
Pig Pen, you go to the bathroom
in the cup.

770
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:48,879
Okay! Jeez!
You are way too into this.

771
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:01,919
Drink up, half-pint.

772
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:19,083
Pig Pen, I will have your ass!

773
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:22,000
- How you doing?
- That's all right.
- Thanks a lot.

774
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:24,476
Ladies, how you doing?

775
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:29,042
Ladies! Ladies!

776
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:31,561
- Whoa. Private party tonight, guys.
- We're cool, man.

777
00:50:31,647 --> 00:50:33,717
- We're regulars here. Just ask Lance.
- Yeah.

778
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:35,877
What part of"private party"
did you miss?

779
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:39,801
<i>Everybody have fun tonight</i>

780
00:50:41,127 --> 00:50:43,243
Hey there, Rick.
Nice monkey suit.

781
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,842
Wow. I barely even recognize
this place.

782
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:49,487
- Yeah, a little facelift.
- Can I get a beer?

783
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:53,526
Hey, Village Person, why don't you be
a macho man and cut me some limes, huh?

784
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:16,917
- Hello, stranger.
- You clean up pretty nice, Rambis.

785
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,840
Thank you.
Wow. You look amazing.

786
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:22,441
Thank you.
Would you like to dance?

787
00:51:22,527 --> 00:51:24,040
Sure.

788
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:34,637
You're not wearing underwear.

789
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:36,763
You can't with this dress.

790
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:39,315
Well, your excuse
is better than mine.

791
00:51:39,407 --> 00:51:43,320
Hey, hey sweetheart, I need to borrow
Fred Astaire here for one hot minute.

792
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:46,399
- Dance with Tito there.
He loves to boogie. Hi, boys.
- Hi, John.

793
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:50,166
And then I just sneaked in.
I was like...

794
00:51:50,247 --> 00:51:52,841
<i>/ can give you anything</i>

795
00:51:52,927 --> 00:51:56,602
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

796
00:51:56,687 --> 00:51:58,803
What did they do to the bar?

797
00:52:03,847 --> 00:52:05,917
How did...
How did you guys get in?

798
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:08,567
- The back door was unlocked.
- Oh.

799
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:12,720
There's gonna be some big changes
on the mountain once I get in
the driver's seat...

800
00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:14,718
but I-I wanted you
to know that, uh, well...

801
00:52:14,807 --> 00:52:18,277
I want you to stay on and...
to run the day-to-day operations...

802
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:20,801
and be the new manager
of Snownook.

803
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,798
- You serious?
- Of course I'm serious.

804
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:25,720
Here's your contract.
Take a gander.

805
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:29,319
Wow. That's a...
That's a big number.

806
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:30,635
Not bad.

807
00:52:32,087 --> 00:52:34,806
But as a new manager, all my friends
get to stay on board, right?

808
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:37,959
You drive a hard bargain, son,
but, uh, done deal.

809
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:39,799
- Thanks, John.
- Oh, don't thank me.

810
00:52:39,887 --> 00:52:43,323
You deserve it.
Welcome to the team, partner.

811
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:44,681
Oh, you are good.

812
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:46,837
- No, wait!
- You're messing with the wrong...

813
00:52:46,927 --> 00:52:49,805
I'm gonna take kung fu
and kick your friggin' ass.

814
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:54,642
We'll have the party at our place.
We don't need their fancy-schmancy shit
and their blue ropes.

815
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:03,481
What's up, man?
What's, uh, what's going on here?

816
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:05,797
If you ain't on the list, there's
nothing I can do for you, buddy.

817
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:07,843
- Ladies, how you doing? Hi. I'm good.
How you doing?
- Hi. How are you?

818
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:10,441
- Mind if we join you?
- Oh, not at all. Go in. Have fun.

819
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,803
I'm liking that. Come on, man.
Gimme a break. What's up?

820
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:15,161
- Are you from around here?
- No.

821
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:19,206
Okay, then $40.
All the locals in free.
Everybody in free. Come on.

Say hello to the new manager
of the mountain.

833
00:53:56,447 --> 00:53:58,517
You straight?

834
00:54:01,687 --> 00:54:05,760
Hey, everybody.
Hey, cut the music off.

835
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:08,122
Pig Pen, put her down.
Put her down.

836
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:14,316
Our friend, little Rick Rambis, is
the new manager of the mountain, y'all.

837
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:19,040
And you're all fired!
Everyone of you. You're fired!

838
00:54:20,247 --> 00:54:22,442
Oh, does this mean
I have to kiss your ass now?

839
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:23,960
- As long as you shave.
- Shave what?

840
00:54:24,047 --> 00:54:26,197
- My ass!
- Hey, boss...

841
00:54:26,287 --> 00:54:28,926
I'm gonna call in sick
tomorrow, okay?

842
00:54:29,007 --> 00:54:31,840
- No.
- Okay.

843
00:54:31,927 --> 00:54:34,725
- Hey, congratulations, boss.
- Thank you.

844
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:38,884
Oh, I'd watch your hand, mister. I could
sue you for sexual harassment now.

845
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:41,356
I'm gonna get you. Hey, look.
Just because I'm your boss...

846
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:43,358
doesn't mean things change
between us, okay?

847
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,677
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

848
00:54:50,927 --> 00:54:54,124
- She has a fiancé, Rick.
- I know.

849
00:54:55,127 --> 00:54:58,039
Look. Your personal life
is none of my business,
but I don't wanna make a habit...

850
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:00,118
out of being your little shoulder
to cry on, okay?

851
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:02,243
Look. I know.
I was just... I wanna...

852
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:04,397
Yeah, go. Go!

853
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:08,366
Yes. Get outta here. Go.

859
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:26,322
What I have to say isn't
really gonna take that much time.

860
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:31,037
I've been practising.
Anna, I love you.

861
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,846
- Rick, don't.
- Look. I'm not gonna lose you again.

862
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:36,999
Not to Barry.
Not to anybody.

863
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:41,285
I wanna fight for you,
and I-I think...

864
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:44,439
that you should tell Barry
that things are over between you two.

865
00:55:56,647 --> 00:55:59,320
You're really not making
my life easy.

866
00:55:59,407 --> 00:56:02,638
- You know that?
- I'm not an easy guy.

867
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:06,840
Hey, yeah, there you are.
Come inside.

868
00:56:06,927 --> 00:56:11,443
You look so beautiful tonight,
I wanted to see if you wanted to dance.

Ah, yeah.

891
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:19,637
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

892
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:24,519
Why, those dirty little bastards.

893
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:28,723
Oh, I know it sucks that they're
ruining a town and everything...

894
00:58:28,807 --> 00:58:36,157
but this is the best vanilla latte
I have ever had in my entire life.

895
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:41,241
I mean, you can actually taste
the vanilla beans that these...

896
00:58:43,527 --> 00:58:45,882
I don't like the coffee.

897
00:58:45,967 --> 00:58:48,083
Rick, check it.
The doctor is in.

898
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:49,998
It's show time, baby.
Come on.

899
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,919
So, you girls like Porsches?

900
00:58:54,007 --> 00:58:55,918
Later.

901
00:58:56,007 --> 00:58:57,440
Let's kick his ass!

902
00:58:57,527 --> 00:58:59,643
No, let's handle ourselves like adults.
Be mature about this.

903
00:58:59,727 --> 00:59:03,117
Adults kick other adults' asses
all the time.

904
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:13,239
- Rick, this is Barry.
- What's up, Rick?

905
00:59:13,327 --> 00:59:15,602
Hey, guys.

906
00:59:15,687 --> 00:59:17,882
Just give me a second here.

907
00:59:25,807 --> 00:59:29,163
Yeah, I'm having second thoughts
about kicking this guy's ass.

908
00:59:29,247 --> 00:59:31,124
Oh, God!

909
00:59:33,047 --> 00:59:36,039
First floor, Alaska.
What's up, guys?

910
00:59:36,127 --> 00:59:39,403
It's great to finally meet you.
Anna has told me a lot about you.

911
00:59:39,487 --> 00:59:41,717
Uh, who's the Jacuzzi Casanova?

912
00:59:41,807 --> 00:59:44,037
That's him right there.

913
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:48,643
Yeah, they call him that 'cause
he had himself up in it, you know.

914
00:59:48,727 --> 00:59:50,718
Lovin' it strong.

915
00:59:50,807 --> 00:59:52,479
Thank you, Stumpy.

916
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:54,876
- No problem.
- Take these twice a day...

917
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:57,083
and you will be back at the plate
in no time.

918
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:59,806
- Oh. Will these make it bigger?
- Oh, that'd be nice.

919
01:00:01,767 --> 01:00:05,919
So are you, like, a crippled guy?

920
01:00:06,007 --> 01:00:09,158
No, I'm just a really lazy guy.

921
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:11,556
Yeah, it happened at the X Games
a couple of years ago.

922
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,797
Piled into a fence.
Pretty messy.

923
01:00:13,887 --> 01:00:17,482
They show the clip on ESPN all the time
in the intro for <i>Sports Bloopers. </i>

924
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:19,717
- Oh, yes.
- Yes!

925
01:00:19,807 --> 01:00:21,877
- You're that dude?
- I'm that dude.

926
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:24,800
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I wipe out all the time, so I know...

927
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,685
Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted
to be either a doctor or a blooper...

928
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:31,442
so it's basically win-win for me,
except now I can't feel my legs.

929
01:00:32,247 --> 01:00:35,842
- Pig Pen, what are you doing?
- He doesn't feel that.

930
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:39,124
So, anyway, what the hell's a guy
gotta do to get a drink in this town?

931
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:42,199
Uh, actually, I'll catch up
to you guys later. I have to...

932
01:00:42,287 --> 01:00:46,246
- Nice to meet you.
- It used to be my bar,
but they kinda took it away.

933
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:48,921
They got wine if you want wine.

934
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:51,316
- What?
- We can get, like, a keg later.

935
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:06,637
Staff room. Right now.
Or so help me, I will get my boot...

936
01:01:06,727 --> 01:01:09,799
- You don't even have to
say it, Eric. I know.
- Come on. Let's move.

937
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:14,762
Got a little surprise
for you boys.

938
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:24,997
Anthony. Luke. Pierre.

939
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:28,318
Pierre? Your name's Pierre?

940
01:01:28,407 --> 01:01:31,717
Majors is really pissed. He thinks
you're all totally incompetent.

941
01:01:31,807 --> 01:01:35,243
He's given me no choice.
You're fired.

942
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:37,363
Effective immediately.
I'm sorry.

943
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:39,483
- I really am. I've nothing against you.
- What?

944
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:42,639
But it's either this,
or he won't buy the mountain from...

945
01:01:42,727 --> 01:01:45,195
Muntz, how could you do this?

946
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:48,279
I mean, this is all
that we have.

947
01:01:48,367 --> 01:01:51,439
I mean, what's Pierre gonna do?
He's very stupid.

948
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:55,884
And you're gonna side with...
with Majors, who calls you
a-a retard to your face?

949
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:58,720
I mean, we say stuff like that, too,
but not to your face.

950
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:01,958
And you know why?
We're your friends.

951
01:02:02,047 --> 01:02:04,242
You guys brought this on yourselves.

952
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:08,320
The hot tub, the drug test.
You're disrupting the whole town.

953
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:14,880
Now, you didn't help me out;
now I can't help you out.

954
01:02:15,687 --> 01:02:17,245
I'm sorry.

955
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:20,961
- Knock, knock.
- John.

956
01:02:21,047 --> 01:02:24,437
Hey there, Rick.
Welcome to the winning team.

957
01:02:24,527 --> 01:02:28,122
Gotcha a little gift.
I'll see you out there.

958
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:29,959

I'm sorry, guys.
My dad can be a jerk, I know.

965
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:06,683
But it's not like
you get to pick your parents.

966
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:09,201
<i>For anyone</i>

967
01:03:09,287 --> 01:03:15,920
<i>/ don't mean to be so grand</i>

968
01:03:16,007 --> 01:03:19,556
<i>- But /'ll take my time</i>
- Needed burnin'.

969
01:03:19,647 --> 01:03:22,115
I mean, what are we gonna do now?

970
01:03:22,207 --> 01:03:24,198
You know, I'm-I'm not good
at anything else.

971
01:03:24,287 --> 01:03:27,916
Not that I was good at this,
whatever this whole thing was...

972
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:30,043
but at least it was familiar to me.

973
01:03:30,127 --> 01:03:32,004
Hey, I can fly you guys
down to Anchorage if you want.

974
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:34,123
You guys can get rides
from there wherever.

975
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:38,166
Look. If worse comes to worst,
we can always get jobs on an oil rig.

976
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:41,956
Our uncle works on one in Nome,
and, you know, we'd be great at that.

977
01:03:42,047 --> 01:03:44,003
Pig Pen, you're on fire.

978
01:03:47,287 --> 01:03:49,517
Guys on oil rigs
get laid a lot, right?

979
01:03:49,607 --> 01:03:52,440
On their occasional break
from their 1 9-hour workday...

980
01:03:52,527 --> 01:03:55,644
and the freezing sleet, yeah,
they get laid all the time, Pig Pen.

981
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:58,764
- All right, I'm down.
- I'm in.

982
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,955
- Should go and say goodbye to Rick.
- No, no, no.

983
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,481
He knows that we're leaving,
then he's gonna throw it all away.

984
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:08,321
So, we have to do
the honourable thing and...

985
01:04:08,407 --> 01:04:11,285
steal a few street signs, leave town
with our tail between our legs.

986
01:04:13,127 --> 01:04:15,357
God, guys.

987
01:04:15,447 --> 01:04:17,199
What's wrong with you?

988
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:20,245
I don't know where to start.

989
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:23,239
Ever since they took my bar
away from me...

990
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:25,477
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

991
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:27,523
A lot of drinking
and a lot of thinking.

992
01:04:28,887 --> 01:04:31,879
A lot of thinking about
why I act the way I do...

993
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:37,200
why I feel the need to have countless
sexual conquests, one after the other.

994
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:40,996
And I think it's due to the fact
that I'm, uh...

995
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:44,523
I don't know how to say this.
Uh, I'm...

996
01:04:44,607 --> 01:04:47,804
- Gay?
- No. What?

997
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:49,525
Gay?

998
01:04:49,607 --> 01:04:53,361
No! Come on, guys!

999
01:04:53,447 --> 01:04:55,756
Mr October
battin' for the other team?

1000
01:04:55,847 --> 01:04:58,361
Lance, everybody knows.
Nobody cares.

1001
01:04:58,447 --> 01:05:02,804
It's okay, you know.
I mean, if you weren't gay...

1002
01:05:02,887 --> 01:05:04,798
you'd be a pretty weird guy.

1003
01:05:06,687 --> 01:05:09,326
Really.

1004
01:05:17,487 --> 01:05:19,717
- Come on.
- Well, I was just gonna say...

1005
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:24,198
that I was adopted, but...

1006
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,323
since we're having
this conversation...

1007
01:05:32,327 --> 01:05:35,364
Hey, Rick. Lookin' good.
Money suits you.

1008
01:05:35,447 --> 01:05:37,358
Yeah, thanks, Mr Majors.

1009
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:39,358
Mr Majors?
What happened to John?

1010
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:41,836
After all,
you're practically family now.

1011
01:05:41,927 --> 01:05:44,395
And not that bogus
Majors Resort family...

1012
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:47,160
that I tell the minimum wagers
their in either.

1013
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:50,239
- Where are all my friends?
- Well, they're gone, Rick.

1014
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:53,763
Business 1 01.
Listen. I was doing you a favour.

1015
01:05:53,847 --> 01:05:55,917
See, those guys,
they're just deadweight.

1016
01:05:56,007 --> 01:05:58,396
Now you can run this place
to your full potential.

1017
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:02,036
You'll make a boatload.
Maybe you'll marry my daughter.

1018
01:06:02,127 --> 01:06:05,915
- I got work to do.
- Get that statue out of here.

1019
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:13,243
What the...

1020
01:06:14,447 --> 01:06:18,884
<i>Bull Mountain! </i>
<i>Don't go changin'! </i>

1021
01:06:18,967 --> 01:06:21,162
- Get that sign straight, guys.
<i>-And world-class skiing... </i>

1022
01:06:21,247 --> 01:06:25,684
<i>at our five-star, major, major... </i>

1023
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:27,644
Hey, John.

1024
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,324
I quit.

1025
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:35,722
That's a $300 hat, bitch!

1026
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:40,684
- Can't believe I was so stupid...
- Rick!

1027
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,201
Jeez, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1028
01:06:44,127 --> 01:06:46,846
- Barry is flying the guys to Anchorage.
- What do you mean?

1029
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:49,043
They're leaving, Rick.
Come on.

1030
01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:57,999
You know, uh, I've always
wanted to be a flight attendant.

1031
01:06:58,087 --> 01:07:00,521
- You showing a movie today?
- Yep.
- It's not <i>Alive, </i> is it?

1032
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:09,485
- You guys are just gonna leave?
- You can come with us if you want to.

1033
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:14,524
No, Rick, you're not going to
throw your life down the tubes
just 'cause we're incompetent.

1034
01:07:14,607 --> 01:07:18,441
You were born to run this mountain.
This is what you wanna do.
You're staying, period.

1035
01:07:18,527 --> 01:07:21,360
I appreciate that. I really do.
But I just quit.

1036
01:07:22,607 --> 01:07:24,518
Well, in that case, hop on.

1037
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:27,041
We got plenty of room for you
if we throw out one of the kegs.

1038
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:31,518
You can't leave. Bull Mountain
is not just our job, it's our home.

1039
01:07:31,607 --> 01:07:34,360
Not really. I mean, you see
what they've done to the place.

1040
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:36,085
We're not the locals any more.
They are.

1041
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:38,442
Snownook's not our town, Rick.

1042
01:07:38,527 --> 01:07:40,802
You know, Bull Mountain,
that was our town.

1043
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:44,163
Well, technically,
it belonged to the Eskimos,
but we stole it fair and square.

1044
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:46,807
They're right, Rick.
Bull Mountain's gone.

1045
01:07:46,887 --> 01:07:48,798
I mean, they even tore down
the statue of Papa Muntz.

1046
01:07:48,887 --> 01:07:50,525
- What?
- What?

1047
01:07:54,207 --> 01:07:58,041
You guys remember Papa Muntz's last...
his last toast right before he died.

1048
01:07:59,207 --> 01:08:01,243
- No, remind me.
- He held up his beer...

1049
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,319
he looked at the mountain that he loves,
and he said, "Don't go changin'."

1050
01:08:04,407 --> 01:08:06,557
His last words were from
a Billy Joel song?

1051
01:08:06,647 --> 01:08:08,797
- "Don't go changin'."
- Bull Mountain is our home...

1052
01:08:08,887 --> 01:08:12,402
- And I say let's do something about it.
- Yes! Our home.

1053
01:08:12,487 --> 01:08:14,682
- Let's do something.
- It is our town.

1054
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:17,281
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- So, you got a plan?

1055
01:08:17,367 --> 01:08:19,278
- Yeah, you got a plan?
- No.

1056
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,757
- I'm in.
- Me too.
- Same here.

1057
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:25,600
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it! Come on.
- Unpack your bags.

1058
01:08:25,687 --> 01:08:28,247
I'm down.
But if we're staying...

1059
01:08:28,327 --> 01:08:31,797
I've got some unfinished business
to take care of.

1060
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:33,923
Come on.
Where's your spirit?

1061
01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:48,965
Hello, Inga.

1062
01:08:51,807 --> 01:08:54,879
I've never been a man of... of words...

1063
01:08:54,967 --> 01:08:58,755
but there's something
that I have to say to you.

1064
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:03,716
Inga, I've loved you
from the first time that I saw you.

1065
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:08,085
And I love you more than any man's
ever loved a woman...

1066
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:11,716
that he's never actually spoken to.

1067
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,719
I'm only gonna offer this once.

1068
01:09:15,607 --> 01:09:17,518
Inga, will you, um...

1069
01:09:18,727 --> 01:09:20,763
have sex with me?

1070
01:09:26,407 --> 01:09:30,195
Nothing would piss off
my stepfather more.

1071
01:09:31,607 --> 01:09:33,882
Let's do this.

1072
01:09:35,367 --> 01:09:37,278
All right, guys.
You know what to do.

1073
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:40,598
It's time to destroy
this little celebration.

1074
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,917
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on! Come on, guys!

1075
01:09:53,007 --> 01:09:54,918
- Let's do this!
- Come on, guys! Let's go!

1076
01:09:55,007 --> 01:09:56,838
- All right. Let's go. Come on.
- Anthony.

1077
01:09:56,927 --> 01:09:58,838
- Come on. What are you doing?
- Calm down!
- What?

1078
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:00,838
It's time to get back
on that board, man.

1079
01:10:06,687 --> 01:10:09,076
Welcome, welcome,
friends and investors.

1080
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:12,079
We may be 1 0,000 feet above sea level...

1081
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:15,000
but this is the ground floor
you're getting in on today.

1082
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:17,840
Yes, the ground floor of a dream.

1083
01:10:17,927 --> 01:10:20,236
Now, with my signature
and your money...

1084
01:10:20,327 --> 01:10:22,363
we could make this dream come true.

1085
01:10:22,447 --> 01:10:24,961
Yes, sir.
The future is ours.

1086
01:10:25,047 --> 01:10:29,325
Just one beautiful, state-of-the-art,
gondola ride away. Hit it!

1087
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:35,963
Inga!

1088
01:10:40,447 --> 01:10:42,881
Bastard, I thought I fired your ass!

1089
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:46,442
Inga, get your clothes on!

1090
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:49,321
You're just like your mother.

1091
01:10:50,807 --> 01:10:53,526
Guys, if this is gonna be it,
let's make it count.

1092
01:10:53,607 --> 01:10:55,040
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1093
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:57,687
Stay low,
don't hit any kids...

1094
01:10:57,767 --> 01:10:59,997
- And most of all, don't sit down.
- Why not?

1095
01:11:00,087 --> 01:11:01,998
'Cause we're doing this
Papa Muntz style, baby.

1096
01:11:02,087 --> 01:11:05,443
- Ow!
- Get 'em off!

1097
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,438
Come on. Get 'em off!

1098
01:11:07,527 --> 01:11:09,324
Luke, if you'll do
the honours, please.

1099
01:11:09,407 --> 01:11:12,524
Everybody, pants at half-mast.

1100
01:11:15,447 --> 01:11:17,039
Let's put Papa Muntz
back where he belongs.

1101
01:11:17,127 --> 01:11:21,882
All right, then.
One, two, three!

1102
01:11:23,887 --> 01:11:27,436
Four, five!

1103
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:30,081
Sorry about that, folks.

1104
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:32,397
I assure you everything
is under control.

1105
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:37,560
Everything's just fine!
Duck!

1106
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:41,361
What the hell
is Captain Cripple doing here?

1107
01:11:41,447 --> 01:11:43,802
What?

1108
01:11:45,527 --> 01:11:48,758
Aw, come on, honey.
Lock her in the Humvee till he's gone.

1109
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:52,044
Nineteen, twenty.

1110
01:11:52,127 --> 01:11:53,879
Come on, baby.
Twenty-one.

1111
01:11:53,967 --> 01:11:56,800
- All right.
- Don't touch me!
- You better learn
some manners, little lady.

1112
01:11:57,727 --> 01:11:58,955
In!

1113
01:12:00,727 --> 01:12:03,036
- So what's up?
- Guard duty.
- Nice!

1114
01:12:09,927 --> 01:12:13,522
Yee-ha!

1115
01:12:14,887 --> 01:12:18,038
- Everything is fine!
- Whoo-hoo!

1116
01:12:31,007 --> 01:12:32,838
Damn!

1117
01:12:36,847 --> 01:12:38,200
Afternoon, everybody.

1118
01:12:40,247 --> 01:12:42,238
Rick, you ungrateful jerk!

1119
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:48,078
Get outta my way!
Whoo-hoo!

1120
01:12:52,487 --> 01:12:54,443
Stop, thief!
Hey, stop those guys!

1121
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,597
Get those guys outta here!
Bunch of losers!

1122
01:12:57,527 --> 01:12:59,995
Come on, baby!

1123
01:13:01,967 --> 01:13:04,845
- Luke! Luke! Luke!
- What the hell's he doing up there?

1124
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,804
Wait! Stop it!

1125
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:09,003
Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke!

1126
01:13:11,007 --> 01:13:13,999
Major!

1127
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,399
Oh, shit!

1128
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:23,765
- How's that for irony? Medic!
- Ooh! Aah!

1129
01:13:23,847 --> 01:13:25,758
Come on!

1130
01:13:26,647 --> 01:13:28,365
Whoa!

1131
01:13:29,207 --> 01:13:30,765
Rick!

1132
01:13:30,847 --> 01:13:32,838
I'm your father.

1133
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,805
Okay, whatever. Go!
Go! Get outta here!

1134
01:13:35,887 --> 01:13:38,242
Come on! Get 'em!

1135
01:13:40,887 --> 01:13:45,324
All right, at my signal,
unleash hell.

1136
01:13:46,687 --> 01:13:50,362
Wait! Wait! Don't leave!
So there's a few bad apples.

1137
01:13:50,447 --> 01:13:53,007
So my daughter's a whore.
But this is a hell of a deal!

1138
01:13:56,087 --> 01:13:57,566
Now!

1139
01:13:58,687 --> 01:14:01,997
Hey, come on, kids.
Let's play safe. All right, safe.

1140
01:14:06,007 --> 01:14:07,645
Was that a bottle?

1141
01:14:19,847 --> 01:14:22,202
- Wanna go for a ride?
- Where are we going?

1142
01:14:22,287 --> 01:14:23,925
We're getting out of here.

1143
01:14:25,247 --> 01:14:26,965
- Stay back, sir.
- Don't hit me!
- Hang on.

1144
01:14:29,287 --> 01:14:32,085
You want me? Here I come!

1145
01:14:38,887 --> 01:14:44,405
Papa, you will be restored
to your rightful place.

1146
01:14:59,607 --> 01:15:03,202
- Why did you take me around this way?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1147
01:15:03,287 --> 01:15:05,482
- I don't understand.
- Come on.

1148
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,922
I'm gonna stay here so your dad
doesn't know where you went.

1149
01:15:08,007 --> 01:15:10,157
Wait, wait.
Last night you said...

1150
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:12,283
Look. Last night,
we both said a lot of things.

1151
01:15:12,367 --> 01:15:14,881
Some of them were true,
most of them weren't.

1152
01:15:14,967 --> 01:15:17,925
But I thought about it,
and it all adds up to one thing.

1153
01:15:18,007 --> 01:15:21,158
You're getting on that plane
where you belong with Barry.

1154
01:15:23,127 --> 01:15:25,436
Look. We'll always have
Pedro O'Horny's, right?

1155
01:15:26,887 --> 01:15:29,526
We'd lost that until you came here.

1156
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:33,880
<i>Hip hip</i>

1157
01:15:36,527 --> 01:15:37,960
<i>Hip hip</i>

1158
01:15:43,887 --> 01:15:45,718
Go.

1159
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:47,525
Thank you, Rick.

1160
01:15:54,327 --> 01:15:58,320
<i>On an island in the sun</i>

1161
01:15:58,407 --> 01:16:02,195

1165
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:24,563
Think this is funny, retard?

1166
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:30,723
Ow! Damn! What was that? You hit my ear!
You even fight like a retard.

1167
01:16:30,807 --> 01:16:33,640
Do it! Call me retard
one more time! Do it!

1168
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:36,958
- Retard! Retard! Retard!
- I hate you! I hate you!

Ride, Papa, ride!

1172
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:02,838
This is how you repay me? What the hell
you got to say for yourself?

1173
01:17:02,927 --> 01:17:06,715
I got one thing to say to you:
Get off our mountain, asshole!

1174
01:17:09,407 --> 01:17:11,045
All right. Fine.
You win. I'll go.

1175
01:17:11,967 --> 01:17:13,798
But first I'm gonna whomp your ass!

1176
01:17:13,887 --> 01:17:15,843
Bring it on, big man!

1177
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:26,158
- Papa Muntz!
- Yee-hah!

1178
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:29,762
Damn! What the hell was that?

1179
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:32,518
- That was my dad.
- Look out!

1180
01:17:36,727 --> 01:17:39,400
- Stop! Oh!
- Yeah!

1181
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:40,806
Help! Help!

1182
01:17:45,247 --> 01:17:47,124
- Help! Help!
- Whoo!

1183
01:17:54,407 --> 01:17:57,638
Whoa! Whoa! Help!

1184
01:17:57,727 --> 01:18:00,241
Stop! Help!

1185
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:02,045
Where's Anna?

1186
01:18:08,607 --> 01:18:10,325
Where's your boot?

1187
01:18:13,007 --> 01:18:15,316
Let's get a drink.
Come on.

1188
01:18:18,767 --> 01:18:21,361
Yeah, nice work, Lance.

1189
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,041
- Fellas! Fellas!
- Check it out!

1190
01:18:24,127 --> 01:18:28,120
Anthony! Yeah!

1191
01:18:32,087 --> 01:18:35,796
Yeah! Beer!

1192
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:41,565
Oh, hey, hot sluts with tits.

1193
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:43,877
Lance, you don't have to
do that any more, buddy.

1194
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:47,516
Oh, sorry, I...
Old habits die hard.

1195
01:18:47,607 --> 01:18:49,086
I love men!

1196
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:51,078
- Lance, you don't have to
do that either.
- Who wants me?

1197
01:18:51,167 --> 01:18:56,082
Help, retard!
Short stack! Anybody?

1198
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:09,283
Man, you must be proud, huh?

1199
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:11,198
Yeah.

1200
01:19:11,287 --> 01:19:13,482
So, uh, do you ever miss her?

1201
01:19:13,567 --> 01:19:16,445
- Who?
- That is the right answer.

1202
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:21,916
So, um, you wanna
get a drink with me later?

1203
01:19:23,007 --> 01:19:25,726
You're gonna have to try
a lot harder than that, Ricky.

1204
01:19:32,847 --> 01:19:35,566
You know, things worked out
pretty well...

1205
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:38,719
for our friends
up here on Bull Mountain.

1206
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:43,835
Rick and Jenny?
Yeah, they got together and then some.

1207
01:19:43,927 --> 01:19:48,000
Two sweet kids like that,
they can do mighty well by one another.

1208
01:19:48,087 --> 01:19:51,966
Anybody who ever tells you
that money won't buy you love...

1209
01:19:52,047 --> 01:19:53,958
hell, they ain't ever
been to Reno.

1210
01:19:54,047 --> 01:19:58,199
I was at the buffet table. This gal
comes up to me, and I flash them dimes.

1211
01:19:58,287 --> 01:20:02,565
And we went right up to her hotel room...
Well, it was a car.

1212
01:20:03,607 --> 01:20:05,518
This is the good one.

1213
01:20:13,007 --> 01:20:15,919
- Hey, you're pretty good
on that thing, son.
- Yeah, I'm a genius.

1214
01:20:22,487 --> 01:20:25,684
Actually, he was Mr Mankowitz,
but you can call me...

1215
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:28,555
Set.

1216
01:20:28,647 --> 01:20:30,683
Who is under my table?

1217
01:20:30,767 --> 01:20:33,327
Who put a farting machine
under my table?

1218
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:38,198
This uniform makes my nuts "rageous."

1219
01:20:38,287 --> 01:20:41,882
This uniform's really cramping
my hardy boys. It's no mystery.

1220
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:44,162
Well, this outfit
is suffocating my...

1221
01:20:44,247 --> 01:20:46,681
Lance, can I get
a drink for a...

1222
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:49,122
<i>Oh, baby, /'m makin'it</i>

1223

<i>You get it, /'m on it</i>
<i>/ got the milk and honey</i>

1226
01:21:00,887 --> 01:21:03,640
<i>You make me laugh</i>
<i>Ha ha ha</i>

1227
01:21:03,727 --> 01:21:06,685
<i>You make me laugh</i>
<i>Ha ha ha</i>

1228
01:21:06,767 --> 01:21:10,316
Are we still making this movie?
Are we done with this crap?

1229
01:21:32,927 --> 01:21:34,963
<i>Ha ha ha</i>

1230
01:21:36,847 --> 01:21:39,805

<i>Ha ha ha</i>

1232
01:21:42,127 --> 01:21:44,880
When this country
went off the gold standard...

1233
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:46,923
Your paper is paper.

1234
01:21:47,007 --> 01:21:50,238
Nothing more than paper.
And if you don't believe me...

1235
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:52,921
by God, you go talk
to Alan Greenspan!

1236
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:55,726
I swear to God!
He's running this country!

1237

<i>Lookin'at himself</i>

1238
