00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,660
Goddamn it, Ty.

373
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,262
He was here just a minute ago.

374
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:32,412
I... Something's fucked up.

375
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,848
[Growling, yelling]

376
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:37,817
DR. BILLINGTON:
Shoot him, Danger!

377
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,655
Shoot it!

378
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,594
[Gunshots]

379
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,096
I'm gonna pop your cherry!

380
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,063
[Shrieking]

381
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,534
Oh, my God!

382
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,535
Ugh.

383
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,536
Fuck, dude.

384
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,104
You scared me into shit.

385
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,472
I knew you'd get lot.

386
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,040
Well, I'd rather be lost
than covered in shit.

387
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,108
Dude, I'm sorry.

388
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,644
That's shitty.

389
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,545
It's all right, man.

390
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,714
I got wet naps in the tent.

391
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,515
Wet naps?

392
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,695
Out of range.

393
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:29,736
Oh, my God!

394
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,171
No, I'm trapped in this cell!

395
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:35,074
Ah!

396
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,743
DR. BILLINGTON: What the
hell was with that shit?

397
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,077
RICK DANGER: I did
what I had to do.

398
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,012
DR. BILLINGTON: Danger, I know
you may have saved my life,

399
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,348
But we don't know why.

400
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:42,315
He was probably drunk.

401
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,115
Drunk?

402
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,251
No, no, no.

403
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,518
We have to get somebody
from the research desk.

404
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,320
What if Tuck was right
about the... the coons?

405
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,721
Tuck was not right.

406
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:49,922
Look, besides, I
can't let something

407
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,791
Like this get out to the mayor.

408
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,026
I'm sure these unusual
deaths were a one-time thing

409
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,161
And they'll all just blow over.

410
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:06,939
Shit snakes.

411
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,135
Jesus, what the hell happened?

412
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,704
I don't know, shit breath.

413
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,206
You leave the cooler unlocked,
the animals get your food.

414
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,007
He got the whole camp.

415
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,948
Still some shit over there
if you want to eat that.

416
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,551
I'm Dick Weener live
for Network News.

417
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,321
What was a happy summer
break camping trip

418
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,790
Has now gone terribly wrong,
and a college student, Zane,

419
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,426
Affectionately called
"The Train" is now

420
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,094
Dead because of animal attacks.

421
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,396
What's going on?

422
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,833
Some pussy-ass animal derailed
"The Train" last night.

423
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,735
Hey, it's TV's Dick Weener.

424
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,303
Authorities aren't saying much.

425
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,341
Shane, when you
were calling experts,

426
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,376
Did you happen to
call the media?

427
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:17,510
Let's see.

428
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,112
I called the CDC, the
ECA, the local church,

429
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,048
Pest control, and the media.

430
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:22,915
Shit.

431
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,786
Shit snakes, now
the word's out!

432
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:27,587
DR. BILLINGTON: No, no.

433
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:28,388
Danger!

434
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,589
I've done some research.

435
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:30,923
You see?

436
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,526
There is the bacteria that
lives inside the coon's stomach,

437
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,462
And it makes people sick.

438
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:37,296
What is it?

439
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,398
What it is?

440
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,699
What it is... it's called...

441
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:44,303
It's called [inaudible].

442
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,773
Raccoon roundworm.

443
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:49,942
Spread through a coon's scat,
it enters through the mouth.

444
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,511
Burrows in the brain.

445
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,547
Eats away until death.

446
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,283
Right, what... what he said.

447
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:00,286
My name is Chester
D. Charlesworth.

448
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:03,456
Your deputy, Shane, told me
to enter through the back.

449
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:07,460
I'm with the CDC and a
professor at Raccoon University.

450
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,566
That's a real university?

451
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,901
Is that a real mustache?

452
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,641
[Phone ringing]

453
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:40,493
[Dial tone]

454
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:46,833
Hey, guys.

455
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,200
I hate to bother
you, but we just

456
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,602
Heard some disturbing news.

457
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,305
They just brought in a raccoon
expert to research the killing.

458
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,941
Raccoons?

459
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,142
Raccoons?

460
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,010
You mean raccoons are
the fags who killed Zane?

461
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,646
Let's get the hell out of here.

462
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:01,614
[Agreeing in unison]

463
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,050
If some man were to
kill that raccoon,

464
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,018
I'd have sex with them.

465
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,654
I think I'd just
give them a blowjob.

466
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,893
[Chattering]

467
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,868
She meant after
marriage, right?

468
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:24,303
Danger, what has happened?

469
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,705
Rumor around town
is that you have

470
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,273
Something of a critter problem.

471
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,610
Your deputy Shane said I
could enter through the rear.

472
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,644
Howdo, son.

473
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,579
Reverend Pookie.

474
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,282
From Church of
God, Independence.

475
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,083
How do you do?

476
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,619
Ah, shoot, Reverend.

477
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:40,787
We got a coon problem.

478
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,254
Coons?

479
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,289
They got diseases?

480
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:44,557
Distemper?

481
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:45,592
Rabbis?
Rabies.

482
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:46,425
Rabies?

483
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,260
And it could be something more.

484
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,331
Last night, these raccoons
ate some poor kid.

485
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,733
This ain't disease.

486
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,267
Raccoons eating boys?

487
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,170
You know darn well this
is the work of Satan.

488
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,074
What we need is an
exorcism to get him out.

489
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,242
Led by me, of course.

490
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,059
REX: What... What
the hell do we do?

491
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,162
When my dad goes hunting,
he gets totally ripped!

492
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,764
Well, let's get wasted!

493
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:28,668
[Rock music]

494
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,041
ALL: Chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug!

495
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,709
I'd like to catch
one of these bastards

496
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,145
And examine them before
we jump to conclusions.

497
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,513
POOKIE: Nonsense.

498
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:44,316
Danger, just let me
get the old book on it.

499
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,186
Well, either way we're going
to have to come into contact

500
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,188
With the coon, but how?

501
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,223
That's where I come in, fuckers.

502
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,192
You all need a raccoon?

503
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,293
I can get 'em.

504
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:59,431
My name is Jon, I'm
in PR... pest removal.

505
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:03,002
Yeah, your deputy told me I
could slip on in from behind

506
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:06,338
Anytime I want to.

507
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,207
Anyway, I'm here to help.

508
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,950
Well, fine.

509
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,420
Thank you, Mr. Charlesworth,
Reverend Pookie, and Mr. Jones

510
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,689
For coming.

511
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,256
And now, we just got to figure
out what kind of raccoon

512
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,625
We got.
Aw, man.

513
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,493
I'll tell you what it is.

514
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:28,761
It's the same damn
raccoons that's

515
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,830
Been coming here for 20 years.

516
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,631
They're back.

517
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,099
They're back for revenge!

518
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:33,900
Who's this?

519
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,602
Tuck, I told you to stay out.

520
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,671
And I told you yesterday,
man, it's a raccoon.

521
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:39,739
You wouldn't believe me.

522
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,940
I know my shit, dude.

523
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,342
I know these raccoons
better than anyone else

In these woods.

525
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,077
Yeah.

526
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,946

is not to fuck this up.

to get these raccoons.

did they find out?

the darn media.

dance or something.

RICK DANGER: Shane?

558
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,046
Shane?

559
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,982
Shane, are... Shane, can you...

560
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,054
Mmm, fruit.

561
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,723
I love fruit.

ALL: Kill the coons!

563
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:05,925
Kill the...

564
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,193
I'll have to do it myself.

00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:09,461
Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

My fellow campers.

582
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,652
I hear your cry and I
believe in your cause.

583
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,723
We are victim to
great evil that lurks

584
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:41,127
Unbeknownst to us in the
woods and right here among us.

585
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:44,363
Now, these folks that
stand here behind me?

586
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,866
They support your solutions.

587
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:51,003
We must rid this
camp of raccoons,

588
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,872
And we must do so for Zane!

[Cheering]

590
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,181
If these raccoons change
the way we camp, they win.

591
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,549
We must fight!

[Cheering]

593
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,523
God has given you a gift.

594
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:15,627
A gift to spread the word of
the Lord and destroy evil.

595
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:19,431
What we have here is a good old
fashioned coon hunt for Christ!

Hey, hey, hold on, man.

600
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,757
You guys... you guys can't rid
these coons by hunting them.

601
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,259
There's too damn many of them.

Electric shock you
can't fuck with.

604

Don't listen to this fool.

605
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,566
You gotta do what's right.

606
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,936
You gotta pick up
your guns and lead

607
00:28:57,036 --> 00:29:02,574
This fearful fight against
the bandits of the night.

608
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,116
(SINGING) Your friend,
Zane, got a little insane

609
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,618
When he tried to hit the sauce.

610
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:15,487
(SINGING) But if we kill these
coons in the name of Zane, then

611
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,224
His life ain't completely lost.

612
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,726

do is kill the coons!

613

00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:24,696
Gotta, gotta, gotta
kill the coons.

615
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:30,169
Kill the coons until we
just can't kill anymore!

616
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,671
I think I'm gettin' it.

617
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,174
(DEEP SINGING) I'd have it
made if I were to get laid,

618
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,143
And now is really my chance.

619
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:40,146
If I kill these coons
and impress Janine,

620
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:43,115
I'll have some
company in my pants.

621

Kill the coons until we
just can't kill anymore!

Of the bandits of the
night of the bandits

Of the night of the bandits!

629
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,538
The fact is coons are
attacking this town.

630
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,806
We must not falter.

631
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,108
We must step it up.

632
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:12,111
We got to join together in
the spirit of Independence.

633
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:15,347
Together, we must
kill the coons.

Hey, kid.

00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,006
Welcome to the show.

644
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:16,575
Aren't you happy to
be here today, Muffy?

645
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:17,776
I sure am, Clumpy.

646
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:31,390
First thing you all got
to know about hunting... you

647
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,225
Got to be aware of
your surroundings.

648
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,394
You oughta be alert.

649
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,629
Wait, what?

650
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,132
Now that is the position where
you want to hold your gun.

651
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:44,636
You must be wary of your gun.

652
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,705
You mean these guns?

653
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:47,539
No.

654
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,275
No, those are your arms.

655
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,210
Aren't these things
technically arms?

656
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,311
Yeah.

657
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,081
Yeah, some people do
refer to them as arms.

658
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,716
- You mean these arms?
- No.

659
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,286
Now, next thing you all
got to know about hunting

660
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:01,954
Is you gotta be patient.

661
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:05,024
There's one.

Oh, goddamn!

00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,474
We're supposed to be
destroying evil here.

00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,725

Yeah, let's go find a pooper.

681
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,843
It's just as I
suspected, gentlemen.

682
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:00,279
But worse.

683
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:03,449
This scat from the boy contains
the roundworm, all right.

684
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:07,486
And the bite marks that created
the rabies and distemper.

685
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:11,990
It appears that our raccoons
are incredibly diseased.

686
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:14,326
So what exactly are you saying?

687
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,263

There are several

They are sneaky and aren't
afraid of human's trash

698
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:46,024
And waste.

Come on, that tickles.

703
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,500
But if a raccoon is diseased,
pray that it doesn't have

704
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,368
Distemper or aggressive rabies.

705
00:33:56,468 --> 00:34:00,206

on anyone who is vulnerable.

And your raccoons
in particular... I

Don't know how they got
scat in the boy's mouth.

You'd think people
wouldn't eat shit.

Dude, you should really
try pooping over here.

712
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,196
Real nice.

713
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,468
Some people believe
that raccoons

714
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,037
Are even smarter than people.

715
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:34,506
So can these,
uh, raccoons carry

716
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,142
Sexually transmitted diseases?

717
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,046

the ranger station.

734
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,563
What the hell was
wrong with him?

735
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,265
Dude, did he shit in his mouth?

736
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,367
Those are raccoons, man.

737
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,003
The scat of raccoons.

738
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:41,473
Raccoon scat makes men go batty
if it gets in their mouth.

739
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,242
Dude, you fell in
shit last night.

740
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:44,109
Oh, my God.

741
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:44,910
It got in my mouth.

742
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,745
Eww, Ty?

743
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,381
Hold on know, you
fell in by the trail?

744
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,349
Yeah.

745
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,552
Well, that's not
where raccoons poop.

746
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:54,353
That's where I poop.

747
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:07,233
[Shrieking]

748
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,705
[Gunshot, shrieking stops]

749
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,309
Breaking news now
from Raccoon Creek

750
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:20,979
Campground where the killer
raccoon has been shot dead.

751
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,614
Three out of three
experts have confirmed

752
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,816
That the dead varmint
is the same that killed

753
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,618
A college student last night.

754
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:31,557
We have captured the
varmint that was supposedly

755
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,759
Injuring some campers.

756
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,495
It was a coon... raccoon.

757
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,530
The executor of
this masked murderer

758
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,900
Is a timid college student
named Ty Smallwood.

759
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,936
And naturally, everyone
affected at the campsite

760
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,339
Is hailing his name.

761
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,340
I think he's a saint.

762
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,708
Uh, he dropped his
gun on the ground

763
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,410
And shot the thing by accident.

764
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,144
DICK WEENER: There was
some dissension, however,

765
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,747
From a local liberal hippy,
who according to sources

766
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,916
Lives and defecates
in the woods.

767
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:58,717
There's more!

768
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,352
There's a whole family of them!

769
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,820
A whole family!

770
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,455
There's a whole family of them!

771
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:07,693
There's a whole family!

772
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,529
Stop, stop, stop!

773
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:11,897
DICK WEENER: But
for now, campers

774
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:13,565
And authorities
both are determined

775
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,701
To enjoy the happy occasion.

776
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:18,103
We're holding a big
celebration here for Tom today.

777
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:19,137
Ty.

778
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:19,938
Right.

779
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,072

780
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,409

783
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:40,592
There you go.

784
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:41,393
Yeah.

785
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,031
TY: I... I promised
I wouldn't do that.

786
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:50,436
I'd like to propose a
toast to my best friend.

787
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:53,305
He's not a winner,
he's not a loser.

788
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:54,773
He's a "Ty."

789
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:57,609
Thanks, buddy.

790
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:58,410
Hey, pussies.

00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,547
Let's play some cornhole.

792
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,114
Let's get out of here.

793
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,282
What?
Why?

794
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:05,216
I just...

795
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:06,318
Sex.

796
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:07,118
Oh.

797
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,493
Take your time, you two.

798
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:15,694
Come on!

799
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,028
Cornhole!

800
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,597
Didn't two of your
best friends just like,

801
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,098
Die in the past two days?

802
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:23,268
Yeah, but I'm not a pussy.

CHARLESWORTH: Danger, stop
worrying about those kids.

805
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,516
You deserve a break.

806
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,351
RICK DANGER: Still
gotta do my job.

807
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:41,453
Aw, can't what's
his face watch him?

808
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:44,289
No, Shane's off for the night.

809
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,424
Welcome.

810
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,626
I drink to our success
and future endeavors.

811
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:48,694
Naturally.

812
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,996
Who ever thought
raccoons would be so mean

813
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:54,099
And dangerous. [Inaudible].

814

We've done great
work here today.

[Imitating trumpet]

819
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:26,064
DICK WEENER: And we understand
the hero is a virgin.

820
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:30,235
So hopefully after this
event, he will get laid.

821
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,971
God is on his side.

822
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:36,107
Thank goodness the raccoons
are no longer a threat...

823
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:43,649
Ty, you haven't been rewarded
yet for saving the day.

824
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,684
Oh, I don't... I
don't need a reward.

825
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:49,287
Just Ty being Ty, you know?

826
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,256
You have never
had sex, have you?

827
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,695
I think they were going to make
s'mores back at the campground.

828
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,229
They said they were going
to do it right after

829
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,467
They sing the kumba... um...

00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,645

919
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,137
God had nothing
to do with this.

920
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,342
Let's head back to the station.

921
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:45,977
See if we can find
some survivors.

922
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:52,750
Oh, will one of you
fellas put out the fire?

923
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:55,854
I don't want to lose my job.

924
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:59,825
[Rustling]

925
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:06,731
Ah!

926
00:46:06,832 --> 00:46:11,369
Aw, sweet [inaudible], man.

927
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:14,840
[Chirping]

928
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,620
[Louder chirping]

929
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:32,090
Run.

930
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:39,965
Shit snakes.

931
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:46,204
Danger, you might got
yourself a little bit

932
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,472
Of a raccoon problem.

933
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:52,677
RICK DANGER: Looks like we're
going to need a new base.

934
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,645
I know a place they can't get.

935
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,396
RICK DANGER: Well, I
was wrong about this.

936
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:14,332
My God, they got one over here.

937
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:17,869
JONES: Mother fucker.

938
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,038
Them fuckers is armed, too.

939
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:26,945
RICK DANGER: Gentlemen,
think I'm gonna cry.

940
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:33,384
POOKIE: Oh, Danger.

941
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:35,353
Come now.

942
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:38,289
It's all right.

943
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,725
It's OK.

944
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:42,693
It's all right.

945
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:46,097
[Sobbing]

946
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,536
I... I can't watch
another man cry.

947
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:53,404
[Sobbing]

948
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:59,477
Neither can I.

949
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:02,981
[All sobbing]

950
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:14,425
[Hippie music]

951
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,342
ANNOUNCER: Ladies
and gentlemen, Ty!

952
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,187
So you fucked any hot
dead chicks lately?

953
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:43,021
This guy's dead serious.

954
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,496
Let's go down to the morgue and
all get laid by dead chicks.

955
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,144
[Crowd groaning]

956
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:13,584
Ty, you must be strong.

957
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,386
You must conquer your fear.

958
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:17,022
I am with you.

959
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:19,524
I will always be with you.

960
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:20,325
Ah!

961
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:21,126
Janine!

962
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:26,397
Where am I?

963
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,068
Ah!

964
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:31,136
An Arab.

965
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:31,936
Ah.

966
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:32,937
With a lighter.

967
00:49:33,038 --> 00:49:33,904
Easy, friend.

968
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,041
You're safe here.

969
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,475
Are you holding me hostage?

970
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:39,477
He's no bigger
threat than the CIA,

971
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,846
You ungrateful corporate copy.

972
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:43,548
The only thing
holding you hostage

973
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,683
Is a family of angry raccoons.

974
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:48,653
I have been saying all along.

975
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,956
Friend, my name is Al Jazeera.

976
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:53,758
You can call me Al.

977
00:49:53,858 --> 00:49:54,959
Who are you?

978
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,760
Hi.

979
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,728
I... I'm Ty.

980
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,829
AL: Well, Ty.

981
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,165
Welcome to our fort.

982
00:50:00,265 --> 00:50:04,335
It's built for these very
raccoon attacks you survived.

983
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,604
Wha... what do you mean?

984
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:07,972
He's got no idea, man.

985
00:50:08,073 --> 00:50:10,908
The whole public's got no idea.

986
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:11,976
Forgive me.

987
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:13,944
I should mention that
the old man and I

988
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:15,980
Sort of knew the events
of the last few days

989
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:17,848
Were gonna happen.

990
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,484
There were signs leading
up to it all along,

991
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,452
But nobody paid attention.

992
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:24,655
JEFF TUCK: The raccoons are
waging a battle on mankind.

993
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,424
It is their destiny.

994
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,727
AL: He told me about it when
I first came to the woods.

995
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,597
I got kicked out of the
university for, well,

996
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,532
Let's just say for
being different.

997
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:36,734
Brown skin, beard.

998
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,969
Anyway, Tuck said
he'd train me to be

999
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,871
A warrior for a great fight.

1000
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:44,309
We've more or less declared a
jihad on the little bastards.

1001
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:48,379
But unfortunately, coons are
winning at this point... Viet

1002
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:49,580
Cong style.

1003
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,116
But how is this possible?

1004
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:53,684
You knew?

1005
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,087
There's been so much death.

1006
00:50:56,187 --> 00:51:00,691
My best friend, girl I
lost my virginity to.

1007
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,127
Both dead.

1008
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:03,561
AL: That's a shame.

1009
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:04,829
First time's usually special.

1010
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,697
JEFF TUCK: Yeah, first time's
usually pretty special.

1011
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,666
Very cherished memory.

1012
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:09,900
I remember mine.

1013
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,904
I remember it too. [Inaudible].

1014
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,140
I want to be a warrior, too.

1015
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,010
I mean, I know I just met
you guys and everything,

1016
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:25,583
But, uh, I need something
to do with my life.

1017
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,051
You'll have to
tell him the story.

1018
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,257
It was always known
coons would come back.

1019
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:33,224
It was just a matter of when.

1020
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:41,566
See, back in the Roaring '20s,
this land was a raccoon farm.

1021
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:45,670
And raccoon fur coats... 15 coons
would make a nice, plush coat.

1022
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,937
Well, when the
depression came around,

1023
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:51,108
Then facilities rotted
and the farm went under.

1024
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:54,011
Raccoons were left in
their cages to starve.

1025
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,614
Some escaped... escaped to
the mystic Indian worshipping

1026
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:58,115
Grounds.

1027
00:51:58,216 --> 00:52:00,218
They escaped to the
societies of man.

1028
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:02,287
They caught the diseases.

1029
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:04,189
They knew to come back?

1030
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:07,992
The Aztecs used to call
mother racoons [non-english],

1031
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:10,295
She who talks with gods.

1032
00:52:10,395 --> 00:52:11,662
What do you mean?

1033
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:13,798
JEFF TUCK: These raccoons
are like no other animal

1034
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:15,366
Amongst us, man.

1035
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,836
They got no other
enemies except us.

1036
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:22,307
And I had a tussle with one
of them a few years back.

1037
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:29,079
He took my left ball,
and I took him for a hat.

1038
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,949
And after I killed him, it
inspired this little number.

1039
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,488
(SINGING) That old raccoon
in the simmon tree.

1040
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:40,591
That possum on the ground.

1041
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:45,363
Possum say to the raccoon, sir,
please throw these things down.

1042
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:47,365
Raccoon say to the possum, sir,
they smile from down below.

1043
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,437
If you want these good
simmons, then just

1044
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:53,271
Climb up where they grow.

1045
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:01,178
[Farting]

1046
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,348
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1047
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:04,382
God.

1048
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:05,149
Man.

1049
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:05,983
He do this every night?

1050
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:06,784
Yeah.

1051
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,553
Pretty much.

1052
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:09,820
JEFF TUCK: Oh, my God.

1053
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,621
Oh, my God.

1054
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:11,989
Did you guys here that fart?

1055
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:15,260
[Chirping]

1056
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,449
They've surrounded us all right.

1057
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,817
Like fucking "Dallas," man.

1058
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:45,690
I've got it!

1059
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:46,691
I've got it.

1060
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:48,759
Hello, come in.

1061
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:52,630
Hello, can anyone hear me?

1062
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,031
Come in.

1063
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:55,833
Come in.

1064
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:58,002
Is anyone there?

1065
00:53:58,102 --> 00:54:00,471
Hello?

1066
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,006
Mayday!

1067
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:04,174
Roger.

1068
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,377
Mayday, mayday!

1069
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:08,579
Roger, roger!

1070
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,548
Little bird to big bird.

1071
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:11,549
Hello?

1072
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:13,150
This is Ranger Rick Danger.

1073
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,118
Where are you calling from?

1074
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,586
Who is this?

1075
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,522
I'm calling from
Raccoon Creek Campground.

1076
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:19,790
We've escaped to a
hideout on the North hill

1077
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,092
And we're completely
surrounded by raccoons.

1078
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:25,195
Repeat, our position
is surrounded.

1079
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,831
How many of you are there?

1080
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:27,932
There are three of us.

1081
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:30,735
Two in college and
one old hippy man.

1082
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:31,936
Tuck.

1083
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,404
POOKIE: Praise Jesus.

1084
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,072
There are survivors.

1085
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:39,009
Looks like we're gonna
need a rescue party.

1086
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,045
Somebody get their coordinates.

1087
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:41,879
I gotta call the mayor.

1088
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,552
This is going to take
some super strength.

1089
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:52,222
They're sending a rescue party.

1090
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:53,391
And then what?

1091
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,626
JEFF TUCK: Then we
convince them to follow us.

1092
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,928
Follow us where?

1093
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:58,896
To the den.

1094
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:08,138
All right, men.

1095
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,675
These little bastards have
taken a lot of people out.

1096
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:13,243
Now, if we succeed
today, it'll be

1097
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:15,245
The greatest kill of our lives.

Gotta, gotta, gotta
kill the coons.

1457
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,966
Kill the coons until we
just can't kill anymore.

1458
01:19:34,537 --> 01:19:36,906
TY (SINGING): I have it
made if I were to get laid,

1459
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:39,408
And now is really my chance.

1460
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,378
If I kill these coons
and impress Janine,

1461
01:19:42,478 --> 01:19:44,480
I'll have some
company in my pants.

1462
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,316
ALL (SINGING): All he's
gotta do is kill the coons!

1463
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,784
Kill the coons!

1464
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,254
Gotta, gotta, gotta
kill the coons.

1465
01:19:51,354 --> 01:19:54,723
Kill the coons until we
just can't kill anymore.

1466
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:58,694
Night of the bandits of
the night of the bandits

1467
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:03,666
Of the night of the bandits
of the bandits of the night

1468
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:05,568
Of the bandits.

1469
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:07,103
MAN (ON RADIO):
And, as usual, you

1470
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:09,805
Are listening to the
one and only WRZN right

1471
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:10,606
Here in Independence.

1472
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:12,876
All talk radio, all the time.

1473
01:20:12,976 --> 01:20:14,577
And all of us here
at the radio stations

1474
01:20:14,677 --> 01:20:16,980
Encourage you to tell
your friends to listen in.

1475
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,282
Oh, hi, there.

1476
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:21,918
Looks like some little
cuddly forest creatures

1477
01:20:22,018 --> 01:20:23,186
Wandered into our studio.

1478
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:25,288
Hey, my little masked friend.

1479
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:26,455
You're kind of cute.

1480
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,925
Hey, how about a little
bite of my sandwich?

1481
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:29,725
Yeah?

1482
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:30,994
Oh, hey!

1483
01:20:31,094 --> 01:20:33,196
I... I said sandwich,
not handwich!

1484
01:20:33,296 --> 01:20:34,097
