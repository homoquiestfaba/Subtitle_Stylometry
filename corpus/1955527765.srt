1
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:08,065
Once upon a midnight...

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,606
Once upon a midnight...

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,239
dreary,

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,510
while I pondered

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,553
weak and weary...

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,050
Get off of...!

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,683
Over many

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,091
a quaint and curious

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:31,392
volume of forgotten
lore...

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,966
While I nodded,

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,765
nearly napping,

12
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:41,034
suddenly there
came a tapping...

13
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,075
Damn you all.

14
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,635
Why do I keep having
these dreams, Grandpa?

15
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,498
Hmm, nothing to worry,
Lenore.

16
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,735
Dreams, they're just that...

17
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,539
dreams.

18
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,378
- Who is this man? I am afraid of him.
- What man?

19
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,907
He's bald and lives
in a medieval town.

20
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,114
How did you meet him?

21
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,487
He comes to me
every night, Grandpa,

22
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,186
every single night.

23
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,719
Oh, I'm beginning
to understand.

24
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,562
He is a part
of your dreams, hmm?

25
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,365
What exactly does
he want from you?

26
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,839
I don't know but I was told
that I might have to kill him one day.

27
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,838
Who...
who told you that?

28
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,573
- Edgar.
- Oh, I see. Well...

29
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,378
as you know, Lenore,
Edgar Allan Poe

30
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,615
has been dead
for quite some time.

31
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,451
But he speaks to me
every night.

32
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,055
Once upon a midnight...

33
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,789
dreary,

34
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,196
while I pondered

35
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,131
weak...

36
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,067
and weary...

37
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,264
Maybe I should stop...

38
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,706
stop reading
these stories for you.

39
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,768
No, Grandpa,
please don't stop.

40
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,043
All right then,
let me explain to you.

41
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,680
This bald man that appears
in your dreams...

42
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,387
he is part of a story
that I read to you.

43
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,622
"The Mask
of the Red Death,"

44
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,426
do you remember that?

45
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,967
You think so?

46
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,366
I know so, Lenore.

47
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,632
I don't want
to kill him, Grandpa.

48
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,833
But you don't
have to, Lenore.

49
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,933
You don't have to.

50
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,106
Unless, of course,
you do it in your dreams.

51
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,274
You think I'm beginning
to mix up

52
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,511
fantasy with reality,
is that it?

53
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,486
- There you go.
- Anyway, I'm not afraid

54
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,785
because the raven will
always protect me.

55
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:09,089
Exactly.
So stop worrying, Lenore.

56
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,063
The raven is always
on your side.

57
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,759
And he's a very
powerful bird, right?

58
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,301
Oh yes.

59
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,772
He is very very
very powerful.

60
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,332
And I am Edgar's Lenore,
so nothing can ever hurt me.

61
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,902
Mm-hmm.
You've got that right, Lenore.

62
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,949
Nothing will ever hurt you.

63
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,718
That's where I saw him
last year.

64
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,017
He was sitting on top
of that gravestone.

65
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,554
But I've come back here every week
and I've never seen him again.

66
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,155
Oh, he will be back,
I'm sure of that.

67
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,001
Plus don't ever forget,
Lenore,

68
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,436
the raven,
he's everywhere.

69
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,600
Everywhere you think.

70
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,008
Everywhere
you dream.

71
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,137
Everywhere you go.

72
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,082
And by the time you're 25,

73
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,521
your childhood will be nothing
more than a distant dream.

74
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,617
The future is yours,
Lenore,

75
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,219
and all the light
you shall seek,

76
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,958
and all the darkness
you might encounter.

77
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,235
Okay, Lenore, um...

78
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,295
you know, I hate
to tell you this, but...

79
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,940
I'm just not getting
what I need from you

80
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,536
for this song.
I need to get...

81
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,344
I need to get the emotion
and the interpretation

82
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,577
out of this thing and I need
to lay it down,

83
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,212
and I need you to do this.

84
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,153
I'm going to try harder.

85
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:47,715
I've got something in my head, I just
don't know how to put it down yet.

86
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,785
Lenore, where are you?
We need you here.

87
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,262
I know, I know.
I'm sorry!

88
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,822
- Hey!
- Finally!

89
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,926
Where have you been?

90
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,166
- This is ridiculous.
- Always "Lenore, where are you?"

91
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,399
Let's go, great.

92
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,973
## Thank heaven!
The crisis ##

93
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,379
## The danger is past ##

94
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,009
## And the lingering
illness ##

95
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,350
## ls over at last ##

96
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,186
## And the fever
called living ##

97
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:23,126
## ls conquered
at last ##

98
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:28,223
## In the dead
of the night ##

99
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,532
## When the light was
extinguished ##

100
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,368
## He covered my soul ##

101
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,001
## And he prayed
to the angels ##

102
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,705
## To keep me from harm ##

103
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,943
## To the queen
of the angels ##

104
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,452
## To shield me
from harm ##

105
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:54,493
## In the dead
of the night ##

106
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,028
## Oooh ##

107
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,065
## Ooh ##

108
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,794
## I can't keep
on living ##

109
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,201
## In this world
of loneliness ##

110
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,797
## Your dreams hidden
in the shadows ##

111
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,775
## Leave me
only emptiness ##

112
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,707
## Ooh ##

113
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,045
## Ooh ##

114
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,784
## But my heart,
it is brighter ##

115
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,916
## Than the stars
in the sky ##

116
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,156
## For it sparkles
like diamonds ##

117
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,323
## And it glows
with the light ##

118
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,163
## Of the love
that is in me ##

119
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,932
## As I dream
of the light ##

120
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:46,275
## In the dead
of the night. ##

121
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,246
- Excellent.
- Absolutely great! Great job.

122
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,977
- Whoo!
- Wonderful!

123
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,541
Beautiful.

124
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,519
I had always believed

125
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,988
that the black bird
was my protector.

126
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,049
What Grandpa had been afraid
to tell me was

127
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,857
that the raven had
a very dark side.

128
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,956
Death to all.
Skinner is back.

129
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,367
I don't think this
all-girl band's gonna fly.

130
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,846
Yeah, too many lesbians.

131
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,145
She's a lesbian?

132
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,345
I thought she was in love
with that... that guy.

133
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,151
What's he do?

134
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,986
What's he do?

135
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,289
He's fucking dead,
that's what he does.

136
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,348
Hey, check this out, man.

137
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,429
- Shit!
- That's probably

138
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,295
how she
killed Skinner.

139
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,268
I gotta pee.

140
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,538
...While I nodded,

141
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,444
nearly napping,

142
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,178
suddenly there came
a tapping...

143
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,054
As from someone rapping,

144
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,352
as from someone rapping,

145
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,394
rapping at my chamber door.

146
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,062
'Tis a visitor,'
I muttered...

147
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,165
'tapping at my chamber door.

148
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,399
Only this,
and nothing more.'

149
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,237
Ah, distinctly I remember
it was in the bleak December...

150
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,587
and each separate
dying ember

151
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,782
wrought it's shadow
on the floor.

152
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,295
Okay, girls, here's the bridge part.
So let's try this...

153
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,355
After Grandpa's passing,

154
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,093
I had stopped reading poetry

155
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,862
except for "The Raven,"

156
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,734
and I started writing
and composing,

157
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,330
trying to bridge the gap
between life and death.

158
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,341
By the age of 21,
I had become a singer

159
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,438
in an all-girls' band.

160
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,733
One, two, three,

161
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,932
it's as easy
as kill kill kill!

162
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,781
Lt's for you,
Mother Superior.

163
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,912
Thank you, Sister.

164
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,615
Hello?

165
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,817
Oh, hello, Lenore.

166
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,723
How are you, darling?

167
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,490
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

168
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,260
Oh.

169
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,166
Oh, but of course.
Oh, I always have time for you.

170
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,798
And I was hoping
that the raven,

171
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,636
through his light
or his darkness,

172
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,370
would release me
from all earthly bonds.

173
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,645
It was then that a feeling
of unattachment overcame me.

174
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:22,312
And I was praying my life would
end rather sooner than later.

175
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,951
And when everyone around me
began to disappear,

176
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,720
I knew the messenger
of death

177
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,785
was getting closer
every day.

178
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,829
I've been praying,
but God's punishing me.

179
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,100
No, he's not.

180
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,665
Then why does he
allow this to happen?

181
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,506
People just don't
disappear.

182
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,376
There are some things for which
God gives us no reason.

183
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,746
I'm going to die.

184
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,444
I know I am.

185
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,146
Yes, you will someday.

186
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,657
But for right now,
let's pray.

187
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,752
Jesus Christ,
Our Lord and Savior,

188
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,822
forgive us.

189
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,493
You have to step
into the light, Lenore,

190
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,696
and cast away
the darkness.

191
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,098
The world you're looking for
is of the past.

192
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,302
It's of the dead.

193
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,312
It's not for you.

194
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,578
But I'm Lenore.
I can't change that.

195
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,585
Yes, but you're not
his Lenore.

196
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,416
How can you be sure?

197
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,048
I've known you since
you were a little girl,

198
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,924
and watched you grow
into a beautiful young woman.

199
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:40,192
You are not the prisoner
of someone else's poetry.

200
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,941
- Why won't it stay?
- It just needs a flash.

201
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,142
Anyway, should we get
a lighter?

202
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,651
- We should use a lighter instead...
- Wait, hold on.

203
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,711
...of matches.
- Hang on, I can do it.

204
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,053
- Sorta.
- Are you sure?

205
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,255
Maybe.
Maybe not.

206
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,728
Ha, got it.

207
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,230
There we go.

208
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,731
- It went out again.
- I know.

209
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,064
- Gimme your lighter.
- I don't have a lighter.

210
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,433
That's the only problem.
None of us have a...

211
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,496
- My tooth hurts.
- Too much candy.

212
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,542
I'll take you
to the dentist.

213
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,167
It's giving me
a headache.

214
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,439
- I hate the dentist.
- Yeah, but...

215
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,913
it's better than having it
hurt all the time, right?

216
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,149
See this?
I'm breaking everything.

217
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,787
- Don't break my... shit.
- I didn't break it.

218
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,330
- God!
- Jesus.

219
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,662
Why do I keep you around?
Oh, I remember!

220
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,972
- Ha ha ha.
- You're so funny.

221
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,205
- I know.
- Jesus.

222
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,746
- Uh-huh. Yep.
- No.

223
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,248
- I don't like dentists.
- I'll drug you.

224
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,444
- You'll drug me?
- I'll drug you and take you.

225
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,987
You're drugging
enough there.

226
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,455
Um, with the flashing?
Kinda fucking up my high.

227
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,992
Don't you have to do
laundry or something?

228
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,721
Lan, come up.

229
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,559
You can't look too trashed
for tomorrow.

230
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,099
- Hey, that's what makes...
- We've got quite a few interviews,

231
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,725
don't forget.

232
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,134
- Hmm, yeah, I know.
- Do you want some?

233
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,172
Um, maybe.

234
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,901
I'll think about it.

235
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,875
- You're gonna take me tomorrow?
- Yeah.

236
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,740
- Definitely.
- Not you.

237
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:34,972
All right, I won't.

238
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,917
Um, we have to set that
appointment with the dentist

239
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,386
probably no later
than 11:00 a.m.,

240
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,218
- because we have to be...
- When does it end?

241
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,689
At 1:00.

242
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,953
And at 3:00 you've got
an interview

243
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,325
with your fans
and the press, so...

244
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,296
you've got to be there
right after.

245
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,925
You've got a long
busy day.

246
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,434
Well, if I have to do
all that shit tomorrow,

247
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,069
I'd better get
pretty damn high tonight.

248
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,807
- Not too high.
- Yeah yeah.

249
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,372
You gotta get up
early tomorrow.

250
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,420
You gotta take me
to the dentist, remember?

251
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,457
- Ugh.
- Looks like he's an expert here.

252
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,059
Buddy boy.

253
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,503
- Mr. Randy.
- Sorry.

254
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,113
Not too much.

255
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,115
It's all right.

256
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,450
You can't look
too trashed tomorrow.

257
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,887
Hope he gives me a lollipop.

258
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,821
- Are you going to take me tomorrow?
- Yeah.

259
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:40,832
So what time do you have to wake up
for the... to take her to the dentist?

260
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,965
- Like 9:30.
- Oi.

261
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:47,068
Number four is done.
Skinner was here.

262
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,281
All that drilling

263
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,185
and blood goozing
in your mouth. Ugh.

264
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,573
High up in the mountains,
above all things alive,

265
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,278
the raven had his nest.

266
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,082
It's where he kept his prey.

267
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,680
It's where heaven
turns into hell.

268
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,318
My childhood dreams
had always been more real

269
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,192
than anything
in my real life.

270
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,856
So was the death
of Skinner,

271
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,560
which repeated itself
over and over

272
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,263
and became the cornerstone
of my guilt.

273
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,273
Redemption in paradise.

274
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,840
Paradise for me meant
to be in the arms

275
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,007
of a man who would
not leave me,

276
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,382
not abandon me, and that, of course,
would only be in death.

277
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,014
And it would most certainly
have to be Edgar.

278
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,794
I began to further distance
myself from all living things...

279
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:15,959
almost dead, in constant
yearning for Edgar.

280
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,102
And my soul from out
that shadow

281
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,664
that lies floating
on the floor

282
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,576
shall be lifted...

283
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,407
nevermore!

284
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:40,083
Ah, distinctly I remember
it was in the bleak December...

285
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,954
And each separate
dying ember...

286
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,289
it's shadow
on the floor.

287
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:53,635
- Got me a nice bike there.
- You like that one?

288
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,400
- I'm lovin' it.
- You like the skulls?

289
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,340
I love the skulls.
How'd you know it's my favorite color?

290
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,585
A test drive
would be awesome.

291
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,745
- I doubt it.
- I love my bike.

292
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,812
It better not
be worth over $20,000.

293
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,653
It's not worth
over $20,000.

294
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,955
That's nice.

295
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:20,464
- "Buy me this bike."
- That's why I picked my sugar mama.

296
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,727
That's right, baby.
Mama's got some money.

297
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,127
She loves always taking
care of me.

298
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,875
A beautiful bike.

299
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,031
Business or personal account?

300
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,043
Personal, of course.

301
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,916
Unless you've got it,
then maybe we have a deal.

302
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,514
For now, I'm gonna
have to let you go.

303
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,856
Yeah, a new bike
for her boytoy.

304
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,398
I told her nothing more
than $20,000... that's it, 20.

305
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,127
Will you stop it with that?

306
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,102
Lenore, we've got to talk.
Right now.

307
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,665
- I'll be back.
- All right, bye.

308
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,408
What?

309
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,011
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes, I am.

310
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,554
- You just met him.
- That doesn't matter.

311
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,249
- It's a Harley-Davidson.
- It's $20,000!

312
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,688
Lt's not $20,000,
I swear.

313
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,350
Don't you think
that's a little ridiculous?

314
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,520
No. I have the money.
I didn't just meet him, plus...

315
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,564
I mean, he's a great guy.

316
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,123
Great guy...
yeah, for $20,000.

317
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,193
- It's not $20,000.
- Think about it first.

318
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,933
Will you at least think
about it overnight?

319
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,972
I mean, what has he
really done for $20,000?

320
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,275
I just want to buy it for him.
Is that such a big deal?

321
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,941
- Yes, it is.
- It's my money.

322
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,076
No, it's not.
It's everyone's money.

323
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,178
I'm not taking it out
of the business account.

324
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,586
I'm taking it
out of my own...

325
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,148
Whatever goes to your personal
is from the business.

326
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,708
Lust is a deadly sin.

327
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,523
Let me look at you.

328
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,393
Oh, Lenore,
you are so pretty.

329
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,899
I can't believe you're
10 years old today.

330
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,026
It seems just like yesterday

331
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,662
you came to us as
a little tiny baby.

332
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,039
But I want you to know,
now that you're 10 years old,

333
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,667
I think
you're growing up

334
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,212
and there are probably some
things that you should know.

335
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,748
The man
that we called Grandpa...

336
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,613
that you called Grandpa...

337
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:09,619
was actually not your
real grandfather.

338
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:13,623
He is the man that gave you
the beautiful name Lenore.

339
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,024
When you came to us
as an orphan baby,

340
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,326
he was the one who found you
and loved you

341
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,697
and brought you to me
for me to keep for him.

342
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,362
You're okay with that,
aren't you?

343
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,006
He was a dashing
airline pilot,

344
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,703
and he got hurt
and lost sight in his eye

345
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,678
and could never fly again.

346
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,580
But he would hold you,

347
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,879
and kiss you and love you

348
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,353
and read you those beautiful stories
from Edgar Allan Poe.

349
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,483
Well, to tell you the truth
now you know,

350
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,052
when he passes on
to go meet Jesus,

351
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,362
he's left a will.
Do you know what a will is?

352
00:33:56,434 --> 00:34:00,564
A will is a piece of paper
that allows an heir...

353
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,196
which you will
be his heir...

354
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:05,071
to collect all of his
worldly possessions.

355
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,510
That means when Grandpa
goes to meet Jesus,

356
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,104
that big house is yours

357
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,515
and nobody can ever
take that away from you.

358
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,883
You can live there forever.

359
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,520
The man in your dreams,
Lenore, grew up

360
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,789
just like you.

361
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,058
And one day
he became real.

362
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,468
But now you must
confront evil

363
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,665
and go back to the time
when you were 10 years old.

364
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,668
Turn him back into the playful
jester he once was.

365
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:47,041
Don't allow him to have
the power he's seeking.

366
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,723
Become who you were
destined to be

367
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,319
and continue to shape
your own future,

368
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:03,026
neither in poetry
nor in darkness.

369
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,231
And never give up on love.

370
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,933
The raven will show you
the way.

371
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:13,170
He alone knows
your destiny

372
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:17,374
in life, as in death.

373
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,977
I'm going to give you
a break for a minute.

374
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,045
I'm going to go and check
a patient in the other room.

375
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,647
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

376
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,851
While I'm gone, they're gonna
take some x-rays on you, okay?

377
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,052
All right.
Thank you.

378
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,228
- Jackie, how are you doing today?
- Good. How are you?

379
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,859
All right. We were going to do a filling
on the lower left side.

380
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,232
- Okay.
- Are you up for that?

381
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,327
- Yeah.
- Okay.

382
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,271
It's my first cavity.

383
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,541
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

384
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,952
- I'm gonna lower you back.
- Okay.

385
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,896
Okay, open real big.

386
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:19,068
This stuff kinda tastes
like pina colada here.

387
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:22,374
- Are you all right?
- Just close like that...

388
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,977
...and then it's gonna
go to sleep.

389
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,325
- See, that wasn't so bad, right?
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,296
- And you don't feel anything.
- Huh-uh.

391
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,798
- It'll be good.
- I can close my mouth, huh?

392
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,232
Yeah.

393
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,463
- You'll be fine.
- Okay.

394
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,674
- All that sugar.
- I know.

395
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,379
- You've been eating a lot of carbs.
- Thanks to all the tours.

396
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,752
You don't throw it up.

397
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,519
Getting so numb.

398
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,993
- You getting there?
- Yeah.

399
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,087
Starting to, like, not be able
to feel your face?

400
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,495
Oh, it's actually numb.

401
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,726
What do you feel?
You hear it though.

402
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,735
The sound's weird, but...

403
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,794
- Ugh, I hate the drilling.
- Yeah, it sucks,

404
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,237
but you won't feel it,
so that's good.

405
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,537
And when you go back
and you're drinking

406
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,306
over at the house,
you'll be drooling all over yourself.

407
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,216
If you feel any of this,
just make a noise,

408
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,548
- and I will stop.
- Okay.

409
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,680
All right, Jackie, I can't watch this
part. I'll freak out, so...

410
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,815
I'll be out in
the waiting room.

411
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,409
Okay.

412
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,912
- That wasn't too bad, was it?
- Huh-uh.

413
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,039
- Okay.
- Not too bad.

414
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,655
Okay, Johnny,
we're gonna be doing

415
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:49,819
a cleaning on you today.
How's everything going?

416
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,862
That's an interesting
collar you got there.

417
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,229
Okay, open real big.

418
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,247
- Does that hurt at all?
- No, it's fine.

419
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,992
Eye for an eye.

420
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,492
Tooth for a tooth.

421
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,995
You're dead meat.

422
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,909
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

423
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,384
Jackie, we're gonna get...

424
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,420
Jackie?

425
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,677
He came out of nowhere...

426
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,480
Get off!

427
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:18,077
...and went into nowhere.

428
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,887
He raped you.

429
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,937
You killed him.

430
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,205
You were forgiven.

431
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,089
Eagerly I wished
the morrow;

432
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,295
vainly I sought to borrow

433
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,363
From my books
surcease of sorrow...

434
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,968
sorrow for the lost Lenore...

435
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,023
I know you, Skinner,
and you can't hurt me.

436
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,089
You are the ugly man
from my dreams

437
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:12,101
and I should have killed you
a long time ago.

438
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:15,195
But even though you might be able
to kill everything in your path,

439
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,900
you will never be able
to kill me.

440
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:21,502
I am the innocent Lenore
that nobody can kill, ever.

441
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:24,069
I am Lenore
in life and in death.

442
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,647
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

443
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,549
You're playing
the rock star.

444
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:21,063
Bitch.

445
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:24,471
Skinner kills
all bitches.

446
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,710
Nothing happened to her.
Let's not jump the gun.

447
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,215
Didn't you say she was
going to the bathroom?

448
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,511
Are you sure?

449
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,985
Girl, it's messing
with your head now.

450
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,454
- I didn't hear anything.
- It's nothing.

451
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,561
Why can't people
just let me know where they're going,

452
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,325
so I can just not freak out?
They know

453
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,559
that I'm freaked out
about everything

454
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,569
so why can't they say,
"Hey, I'm going here"?

455
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,834
Don't worry about it. I'm sure she just
stepped outside for a minute.

456
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,169
Mm-hmm.

457
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,269
Doree.

458
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,973
Doree.

459
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,445
Doree?

460
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,659
Did you see something?

461
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,225
Yeah, I'm sure
you're just overworked.

462
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,999
You know, we've been
driving so hard

463
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,338
trying to get this recording done
and getting all the girls together.

464
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,104
You know how spacey
they can be.

465
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,738
I could have sworn
I saw him the other night.

466
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,975
It freaked me out.

467
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:27,983
I know. I know
you're freaked out,

468
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,713
but we're gonna go out
and have some fun tonight.

469
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:34,518
Forget about the girls.
They're just missing.

470
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,287
They've disappeared
for a day or so

471
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,055
just because
they've been partying,

472
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,757
but they always come back
and they always call me.

473
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:45,632
Yeah yeah. I mean, I check in
with you guys all the time,

474
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,034
but you know how spacey
they can be though.

475
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,800
I mean,
they're out,

476
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,103
they're running around,
everybody's got a man on the side.

477
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:55,167
I mean, whenever they go out and party
and stuff, it's fine.

478
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,678
Yeah.

479
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,049
Well, we'll all
get together soon

480
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,982
and everyone will be
in one place

481
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,748
and we'll know what's going on.
It'll be fine.

482
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,822
Don't worry so much.

483
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,556
I know it's...
it'll be okay though.

484
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,225
It seems weird, but he's gone.
He's gone.

485
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,961
And the girls,
they're gonna show up

486
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,003
and we're gonna
get back to recording

487
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:22,800
and you're gonna
finish this single.

488
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,501
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be awesome, okay?

489
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,509
You're gonna
get your record done.

490
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,636
You should go in there,
get something good,

491
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,045
get something fun,

492
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:35,209
get some Go-Go's
or some wild Patti Smith

493
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:38,277
or something chill like
some Brahms you can relax to

494
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,687
and clear your head
and get back to your music,

495
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:43,248
get back to your writing.
You're gonna be great.

496
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,794
Thanks.

497
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,796
I love you.
I love all you girls.

498
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,695
Otherwise I wouldn't be
working for you, you know?

499
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:53,031
I love you guys so much.
You're gonna be great.

500
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,970
I love you too.
Thank you.

501
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,007
Okay.

502
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,827
Hey, Sharon. It's me, Loom.
Yeah, I'm with her now.

503
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,890
She went in
to get some records.

504
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,604
I'm trying to chill her out.
She's really anxious,

505
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:06,506
but everything will be okay.
I'm gonna get her there.

506
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,238
We're gonna
continue this record.

507
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:12,042
And hopefully, you know,
the other girls

508
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:14,345
are gonna make
an appearance,

509
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,385
and it's gonna be
all right.

510
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:21,446
Yeah. Yeah. No no no,
she'll be ready.

511
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,992
She'll be ready
for the interview.

512
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,994
It's weird.

513
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,996
Yeah, but she's
gonna be okay.

514
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,999
I promise you,
I'm gonna take care of our girls.

515
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,565
Okay.
Yeah, absolutely.

516
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:47,314
Yeah, I'll have them there,
I promise.

517
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,621
You know I've got it.

518
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,532
Okay.

519
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,831
Yeah, everyone's having
that feeling.

520
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,280
Yeah yeah.

521
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,257
Okay.

522
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,787
Yeah, they'll be all right.
All right, bye.

523
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,751
They had nothing
but crap.

524
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,753
Loom?

525
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,789
Loom.

526
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:58,073
Lizzie was just
watching TV.

527
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:18,555
Doree then went
to the refrigerator.

528
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,513
Nicole just came in here
to fix her hair.

529
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,463
"I command you,
unclean spirit,

530
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,692
wherever you are,
along with all your minions,

531
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,394
now attacking this
servant of God...

532
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:03,703
By the mysteries
of the Incarnation, Passion,

533
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,333
Resurrection, Ascension
of Our Lord Jesus Christ...

534
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,806
By the descent
of the Holy Spirit,

535
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,280
by the coming
of our Lord for judgment...

536
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,323
I bid you tell me
by some sign

537
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,921
your name and the day and hour
of your departure.

538
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,158
I command you, moreover,
to obey me to the letter,

539
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,724
I, who am a minister of God,
despite my unworthiness.

540
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,566
Nor shall you be emboldened
to harm in any way

541
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,436
this creature of God,
or the bystanders,

542
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:41,068
or any of their
possessions...

543
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,382
Amen.

544
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,348
It's time to wake up,
Lenore.

545
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:58,451
You cannot always dream.

546
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:02,055
It's Halloween,
your favorite night of the year.

547
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,993
Remember when you
were 10 years old,

548
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,663
the old house
across the street?

549
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,706
Well, it's still there.

550
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:15,438
Mother Superior often took
you to the cemetery

551
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,445
on All Hallows' Eve

552
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,538
and Grandpa would
read you stories

553
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,380
from Edgar Allan Poe.

554
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:29,314
Later that night,
after you fell asleep,

555
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:33,123
the evil man
would come and visit you.

556
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:37,792
Today all of this
is a faint memory,

557
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:40,597
but Halloween
returns every year,

558
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:44,538
and with it
darkness and fear.

559
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:48,907
The time has come, Lenore,
to face your demons.

560
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:19,892
What are you doing?
Oh my God.

561
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,988
I can't believe you,
Annette.

562
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,363
Damn it.

563
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:37,146
I should just let you
starve to death next time.

564
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,287
You're such
a little brat.

565
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:48,683
This is disgusting.

566
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:55,756
By the way,

567
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,130
I have news from Lenore.

568
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,999
- How is she?
- She has a pact with the devil.

569
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,163
Didn't you know that?

570
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:09,467
You got a lucky break
when you had that car accident.

571
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:13,106
Otherwise you'd still
be a backup singer in Lenore's band,

572
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,150
and that's a one-way
ticket to hell.

573
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,289
A bit unusual
for this time of year,

574
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,848
don't you think?

575
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:26,622
What the hell?

576
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,351
I do not discriminate.

577
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,516
Nothing is sacred.

578
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:33,289
All bitches must die.

579
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:34,408
Lenore, my sweet Lenore,

580
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:38,920
only death shall bring
what you seek in life.

581
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:42,048
But death comes
when death will.

582
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,187
When the time has arrived,
you shall become

583
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,662
the Lenore he created,

584
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,791
the Lenore
only one man knows.

585
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:56,332
When that moment
has come,

586
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:59,863
your longing for love
shall no longer be fantasy and illusion.

587
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:06,144
You wish to undo
what you did, Lenore,

588
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:08,479
but you can't.

589
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:13,181
You have chosen
your destiny.

590
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:22,730
Evil always enjoys
death and destruction.

591
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,234
The man in your dreams

592
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:29,135
must have told you that.

593
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:33,000
It's a game
of cat and mouse.

594
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,746
And love...

595
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:40,475
love is nothing more
than a game to him,

596
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:44,212
like "I love you,

597
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,220
I love you not.

598
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,621
I love you,
I love you not."

599
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:53,962
What will it be
for you,

600
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,497
my sweet Lenore?

601
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,769
And his eyes
have all the seeming

602
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:11,813
of a demon's
that is dreaming...

603
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:18,409
And the lamp-light
o'er him streaming

604
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,921
throws his shadow
on the floor...

605
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:27,121
And my soul
from out that shadow

606
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:32,065
that lies floating
on the floor

607
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:35,035
Shall be lifted...

608
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:37,038
nevermore!

609
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,563
I'm freezing.

610
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,134
I'm going inside.

611
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,338
Good night.

612
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,979
You think you can get away?

613
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:46,350
Think again.

614
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:02,931
No.

615
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,597
She's mine.

616
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,034
It was at this point

617
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,806
that something
very very rare occurred.

618
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:14,542
Hate and revenge
were finally conquered by poetry

619
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,813
and the evil man
suffered.

620
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,820
He suffered
in his own hell,

621
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:23,790
ashamed to find out
that love can conquer everything,

622
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,686
even the messenger of death,
who had to realize

623
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,698
that "An eye for an eye

624
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,700
would make
the whole world blind."

625
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:34,759
And I, Lenore,

626
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:38,273
finally became the Lenore
in Edgar's poem.

627
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:28,581
Wake up, Lenore.

628
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,393
Now that your dreams
have all vanished,

629
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:34,622
it's time to live.

630
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:37,723
No more nightmares.

631
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:40,734
You have redeemed
yourself.

632
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:47,468
From now on the raven shall once more
be your protector,

633
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,376
as it was always
meant to be.

634
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:40,053
Die.

635
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:48,700
From hell I came,

636
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,000
to hell we go.
