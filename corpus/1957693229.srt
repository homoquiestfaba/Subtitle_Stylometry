1
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:03,999
Preacher Rainey used to tell us

2
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:07,930
this old Bible story back in Macon:

3
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:11,205
"Satan tempts Jesus.

4
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:14,999
"This world and all of
its power I will give thee

5
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:17,171
if you worship me."

6
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:19,171
Now, all Jesus has to do

7
00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:22,136
is just fall down on one knee.

8
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,895
But Jesus says,

9
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:28,645
"Satan, thou shalt worship
the Lord, thy God,

10
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,861
and in Him only
shalt thy serve."

11
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:36,645
You see, you got to worship God or Satan.

12
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:39,516

Wow!

51
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,921
We want Little Richard!

52
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,309
We want Little Richard!

00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:45,930
We want Little Richard!

00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,619

We want Little Richard!

57
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,826
Where the hell is Richard?

58
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:52,921
- Where's Richard?
- I don't know.

59
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,343
Where the hell is our brother?

60
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:56,171
I don't know. I was
looking at the front.

61
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:58,102
- You didn't see him?
- No.

62
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:01,067
A man wearing a silver jacket
just can't disappear.

63
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,171
Come on.

64
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,792
We want Little Richard!

65
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:04,895
We want Little Richard!

66
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,412
There you are, Richard.

67
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:17,964
That was bad, big brother.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,723
That was a bad scene last night.

69
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,645
You take off and there
damn near was a riot.

70
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:24,033
What's the matter, Richard?

71
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:25,343
You feeling all right, man?

72
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:31,033
I'm retiring.

73
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:33,171
Look...

74
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:35,171
That's... that's not funny.

75
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:37,688
I'm telling the truth, Robin.

76
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,136
Okay.

77
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:42,162
So, what does that mean, man?

78
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:44,102
It means I'm getting out.

79
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:49,895
God's given me more success
than any country boy

80
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:54,136
from a shotgun house could ever dream of.

81
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:56,645
He's been good to me.

82
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:59,679
Lord, He's been real good to me.

83
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:03,447
I just ain't that sure
I been that good to Him.

84
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:06,102
Why quit now, Richard?
I mean, you...

85
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,964
Why you gonna quit now?

86
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:09,231
He showed me a sign.

87
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:10,792
Like what?

88
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:12,792
- Not that fireball.
- It was a rocket.

89
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:14,748
A Russian rocket.
It was a sputnik.

90
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:17,930
It can be a Russian rocket
and a sign from God.

91
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,309
It can be both.

92
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,792
I saw that thing up there;
I saw it.

93
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,861
But I felt it here.

94
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,861
It was a rocket.

95
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,895
You can't just quit, all right?

96
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,757
Richard, we've been a year and a half

97
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:35,102
fighting to get to the top.

98
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:37,748
That's when you do it... when it counts.

99
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:39,309
Anybody can quit when they're failing.

100
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,481
Chuck is right.

101
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:42,058
You can't just... just walk

102
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:44,102
away from this;
you invented this.

103
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:45,895
You are rock and roll.

104
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:48,205
Now, you want to throw all that away?

105
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,895
Yeah.

106
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:56,067
Yeah, just as easy as I do this.

107
00:04:57,896 --> 00:04:58,896
Richard!

108
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,930
That ring cost ten grand!

109
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:05,136
I won't need it anymore
'cause I'm going home.

110
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:10,274
♪ Beans and cornbread

111
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,481
♪ Beans and cornbread...

112
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:13,516
Here, try this one, Richard.

113
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:16,205
Whoo, it's so hot!
It's so hot!

114
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,309
There is nothing like a little
rose water on a warm day.

115
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm going to pee in my pants

116
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,516
I swear.

117
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:26,378
Child, no. My, my, my, no.

118
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:29,136
More powder, more Westport powder.

119
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:31,343
Richard, you are too...

120
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,447
Richard!

121
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:38,067
Richard.

122
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,343
Boy, come here!

123
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,378
Richard!

124
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:46,447
Come on, you better get
your butt back in here, boy.

125
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:47,516
Come... no, no, no!

126
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:48,826
Let me go! Let go!

127
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,516
Take this nonsense off your head.

128
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,171
What's the matter with you?!

129
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:55,826
Richard! Marquette,
get me my strap.

130
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:57,171
He's going to kill you, Richard!

131
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:58,999
Ooh, it's so hot.

132
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,507
Lord, it sure is some time to be
a seamstress in Macon, Georg...

133
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,033
Hey, hey, hey!

134
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:04,930
Richard boy, what have you done now?

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,196
Nothing.

136
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:07,343
I'll take him.

137
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:10,196
No, no, not this time.

138
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,412
Bud, You beat this boy

139
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:12,507
every time he does something wrong,

140
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:13,999
you gonna kill him.

141
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:16,240
Now, you done whipped him
three times this week.

142
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,516
That's enough!

143
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:21,240
Eva Mae, the boy has dressed as a girl.

144
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,930
I can see.

145
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,516
Just got a little devil in him, that's all.

146
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,196
And I'll whip it out.

147
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,861
No, you won't whip it out of him!

148
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:32,999
Promise me, you're not gonna hit this boy.

149
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:40,205
I won't touch him.

150
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,550
Come on, Richard.

151
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:45,930
Good day, Mr. Penniman.

152
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:48,274
Won't Richard be taking
his piano lesson today?

153
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:49,886
No, Mrs. Clemens.

154
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:52,585
Richard will be getting
another lesson today.

155
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,861
...too many times over
and over again. Get up!

156
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,412
He's bigger than me.

157
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,576
Then you cut him down to your size.

158
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:10,093
I don't wanna.

159
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:13,930
Now, you listen to me, Richard Wayne.

160
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,136
You don't walk right

161
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:18,619
you don't talk right,
and it needs a fixin'.

162
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:21,654
See, man is a warrior.

163
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:24,274
You hear me?
A warrior.

164
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,481
And there ain't no way I'm
raising some sissy boy clown.

165
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:29,136
Now you get in there

166
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:32,102
and you mess that big
boy up good, all right?

167
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:33,265
Go get him.

168
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,102
Come on now, Richard.

169
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:37,481
All right now,

170
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:39,585
get in there, Richard, jab.

171
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:41,964
Jab.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,093
Jab.

173
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,585
Jab!

174
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,654
Get your guard up, boy.

175
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:48,550
Stay in there, Richard!

176
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,654
No, th-that ain't nothing.

177
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,265
Nothing. You never taste
your own blood before?

178
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,516
You get back in there and you hit him!

179
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,136
You go get him bloody, go!

180
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:00,102
Okay, just easy up on the boy, Bud.

181
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:02,412
This is a boxing match;
it ain't baseball.

182
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,723
Now, you don't tell me
how to talk to my own son.

183
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,679
You get in there and you make him hurt!

184
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:09,136
Richard, get the guard up, boy.

185
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,172
Richard!

186
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:13,550
You get in there

187
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,654
and you hurt him!

203
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:27,541
Thank you very much,

204
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,058
Brother Richard Penniman

205
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:32,654
for that fine rendition.

206
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:36,102
Now, today's sermon
is going to be about a subject

207
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:38,619
that a whole lot of you are familiar with.

208
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:40,619
Namely, the Devil.

209
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,403
Any time that you think

210
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:47,412
the Devil is getting ahead, you...

211
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:48,792
you know what you say?

212
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:53,102
You say,
"Get behind me, Satan."

213
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:54,550
Yes, that's so right.

214
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:57,240
"Get behind me..."

215
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,231
We're real proud of him, Reverend.

216
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:00,723
- Hmm-hmm.
- He sings everywhere.

217
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,550
We can barely contain this boy.

218
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,541
Here he is.
Richard.

219
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:06,240
Richard, you know what?

220
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:07,585
There's the Lord's music

221
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,516
and then there's the Devil's music.

222
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:10,576
Yes, sir.

223
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,205
But a voice like yours

224
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:15,102
should be used in the service of the Lord.

225
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:16,137
Yes, sir, I do know that.

226
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:17,206
- Hallelujah.
- I do.

227
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,481
All right, come on home.

228
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,619
We going to get supper
on the table, Reverend.

229
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,274
All right, Ms. Penniman.

230
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,205
Come on, baby.

231
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,102
Choo-choo-choo-choo

232
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:42,102
Choo-choo-choo-choo

233
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:43,231
Choo-choo-choo-choo

234
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,241
Choo-choo-choo-choo

235
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,240
Choo-choo-choo-choo

236
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:46,403
Choo-choo-choo-choo

237
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:47,723
Choo-choo!

238
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:50,619
If you make me come up there

239
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,999
I'm gonna beat you silly.

240
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:57,274
Choo-choo-choo

241
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,550
Hoo-hoo!

242
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:00,654
Robert, Richard, Marquette, get up.

243
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:02,619
Get your clothes.
I need you.

244
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:20,136
Marquette, hand me a can.

245
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:26,645
Richard, for heaven's sake,
keep the light over here.

246
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:29,688
Why can't we just...
dig a big hole

247
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:31,343
and bury the lot?

248
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:33,205
Because the government men

249
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,274
poke sticks in the dirt for holes

250
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,447
but they never poke a garden patch.

251
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:38,861
Well, why is that?

252
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,481
Because this is Georgia,

253
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:43,343
and... collard greens
are sacred.

254
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:44,723
Well, what happens in the winter

255
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,610
when there ain't no more collard greens?

256
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,205
Pumpkins.

257
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,783
After pumpkins?

258
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,378
Potatoes.

259
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:53,783
- After that?
- "After that?"

260
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:56,472
After that, with God's blessing

261
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,447
I'll have my own place.

262
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:01,826
The Tip In Inn, that's what I'll call it.

263
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:03,861
I'm not planning on laying brick

264
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:06,895
and burying cheap corn liquor
forever, no sir-ree.

265
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:09,507
Got to have a plan.

266
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:11,343
Got to have a dream.

267
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,541
Y'all got to have dreams.

268
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,679
When I get older,
I want to own a club, too.

269
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:17,378
Well, I'm gonna be a preacher

270
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:18,723
just like Brother Joe May,

271
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:21,196
the singing evangelist
thunderbolt from the west.

272
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:22,378
You can't be a preacher.

273
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,688
You got too much devil in you.

274
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,240
Ah-ah, I don't know.

275
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:30,679
A lot of good preachers got
a bit of the devil in them...

276
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:31,895
even your granddaddy,

277
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,240
and he was a fine preacher.

278
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:35,481
Reverend Rainey?

279
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:41,343
Reverend Rainey?

280
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,585
Reverend Rainey?

281
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:56,507
Lord, I need to confess.

282
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:57,895
I did a terrible thing.

283
00:12:57,931 --> 00:13:00,343
It was me that wrapped the dog doo

284
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,438
in that pretty red paper
with the flowers on it

285
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:06,619
and sent it to Miss Grady
as a birthday present.

286
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:11,309
Maybe it's the devil in me...

287
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:14,265
and he's been making me think thoughts...

288
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:17,619
about sex...

289
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:19,921
and all...

290
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,792
I guess you know all that...

291
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:25,654
and I feel bad, Lord,
but I still think them...

292
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:29,516
and I know this isn't right
for a future preacher and all.

293
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:32,964
So, that's why I'm asking you
for a sign or something

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,274
or some strength
to help me mend my sorry ways.

295
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:40,550
Who's there?

296
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,481
Lord almighty.

297
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:46,723
Devil, get behind me.
Devil, get behind me.

298
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:28,481
♪ Big leg girl

299
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:31,378
♪ Walk my way

300
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,334
♪ Big leg girl

301
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:35,895
♪ What I say?

302
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:36,895
Whoo!

303
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:39,585
Richard Penniman!

304
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,852
It's blasphemy, is what it is!

305
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:45,688
The boy entered the house of God
and desecrated it!

306
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,378
In all of my 30 years

307
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:51,033
I have never seen such an insult
to the good Lord!

308
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:54,550
It's as if he said,
"Well, come on in, Devil!

309
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:56,550
Come on in
and just sit a while!"

310
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:58,024
We understand, minister.
We understand.

311
00:14:58,034 --> 00:14:59,516
Do you?

312
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:02,136
Because this is sin with a capital S!

313
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:03,585
The boy will be punished.

314
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,140
When I'm through with him, preacher...

315
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:08,481
he'll wish he had never ever saw a piano,

316
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:10,895
and if I ever hear
about him playing one again

317
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:13,093
I'll make him wish he had
never been born at all.

318
00:15:13,103 --> 00:15:15,861
I know it was wrong for him
to be playing them songs,

319
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:17,412
but you can't beat that out of him.

320
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,067
You can't beat that out of the boy.

321
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:23,792
Eva Mae, Eva Mae,
it's not just this incident!

322
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:27,964
Not that I think this is
insignificant, preacher

323
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:31,067
but it's everything about the boy...

324
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:34,403
the way he talks, the way he walks.

325
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:36,033
A father's joy...

326
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,654
is watching his sons grow into men

327
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:43,714
good and strong and make-make one proud

328
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:46,550
but it's clear as the blue sky

329
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:48,861
Richard's not gonna grow into anything

330
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:52,102
but an embarrassment.

331
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,102
I feel ashamed

332
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,895
every time I look at him.

333
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:58,058
I wish he was no son of mine.

334
00:15:58,068 --> 00:15:59,723
He's your son, Bud.

335
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,033
Stop it, Eva Mae.

336
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:02,516
No, Eva Mae's right.

337
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:03,826
You can't give up on your son.

338
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,619
God forgive me but it's true.

339
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,783
You promised me
you wouldn't beat him no more...

340
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:09,205
It's your fault for this

341
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:11,654
'cause you stopped me when I had a plan...

342
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,861
Where you going, Richard?

343
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,654
I'm done with this.

344
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:28,171
Fried chicken's coming right up.

345
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:35,757
Hey, Agnes, got that pecan pie for me?

346
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,654
I got it, Doris.

347
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:39,129

Ooh, child, you gonna get it now.

- Oh, yes, you are.

Doris, your order's up.

358
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:12,171
You better take out
that garbage, Mr. Penniman

359
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:13,999
before you get fired.

360
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:33,102
I ain't breaking my back moving this piano.

361
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,067

No, no, James, come on now.

727
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,792
Get up.

728
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:05,895
Help me get him up.

729
00:36:05,965 --> 00:36:06,965

Uh-huh, James.
Uh-huh.

00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:15,826
You don't want to do that.

732
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:19,334
Come on.
Let's go, James.

733
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,654
Get out of here.

734
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:23,964
I'm gonna kill you.

You go to hell.

736
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:28,343
It ain't worth it.
Come on.

737
00:36:28,379 --> 00:36:30,619
Get out of here and get some fresh air.

738
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:36,654

James LeRoy.

I'm Richard Penniman.
This is my father.

754
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:42,964
Why's his body just laid out
here like this?

755
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:44,403
We want to bring him inside.

756
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:46,067
Can't till the coroner comes.

757
00:37:46,103 --> 00:37:47,205
He'll be along soon.

758
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:48,447
And what about James LeRoy?

759
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:50,412
Y'all gonna give him the electric chair?

760
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,447
Electric chair?

761
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:54,930
We'll take him in,
but I wouldn't be surprised

762
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:57,058
if the D.A. don't dismiss
the whole case.

763
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,792
Why? He killed him, didn't he?

764
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:03,378
Two negroes get in a fight
and one kills the other...

765
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,309
just ain't much of a crime.

766
00:38:08,448 --> 00:38:09,448
Can I talk to him?

767
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:13,171
Yeah, but not too long.

768
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:31,343
You kill my daddy?

769
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,792
Yes, I did.

770
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,447
I'm sorry.

771
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:51,343
Y-Y... Will you forgive me?

772
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,792
No.

773
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,516
I ain't never

774
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:03,024
gonna forgive you, James LeRoy.

775
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:05,516
Never.

776
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,171
Yes, it's our loss,

777
00:39:29,206 --> 00:39:30,516
but you know what?

778
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:32,240
It's heaven's gain.

779
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:33,852
Because Brother Penniman,

780
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:35,343
he ain't feeling no pain.

781
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:39,171
You see, because Jesus
done wrapped him in glory

782
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:40,412
and placed him

783
00:39:40,448 --> 00:39:43,274
in the Lord's unchanging hands.

784
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,447
God be with you, brother.

785
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,343
Until we meet again

786
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:48,930

Amen.

All right.

Oh, he is?

00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,102
Well, um, do you know
whether he's heard my tape?

00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,654
Yeah, did he get the tape?

835
00:43:37,724 --> 00:43:39,757
Listen, that's okay.
I'll sing it to you.

836
00:43:39,793 --> 00:43:41,550
It's starts with a strong bass line

837
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,550

off with an "Ooh!"

This is Mr. Bump Blackwell.

869
00:45:31,448 --> 00:45:32,723
And this is Miss Lucille.

870
00:45:32,758 --> 00:45:34,412
So, Mr. Blackwell,

871
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:36,516
are you going to make our
Little Richard famous?

872
00:45:36,551 --> 00:45:37,551
Excuse me, child.

873
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:39,274
I am already famous.

874
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,369
I meant to people

875
00:45:40,379 --> 00:45:42,447
other than yourself.

876
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:44,369
Oh.

877
00:45:44,379 --> 00:45:45,886
Richard, can I talk to you for a moment?

878
00:45:45,896 --> 00:45:47,240
Yeah, of course.

879
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:48,688
Excuse us, Miss Lucille, thank you.

880
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:50,792
Well, Richard, as you know,

881
00:45:50,862 --> 00:45:52,619
we are ready to get you
down into the studio

882
00:45:52,689 --> 00:45:54,576
and record this record
in New Orleans on the 28th.

883
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:55,654
Well, I know now.

884
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:57,619
Yeah.

885
00:45:57,689 --> 00:46:02,826
However, Mr. Rupe does not
want to use your band.

886
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:04,438
But you heard them, they're great.

887
00:46:04,448 --> 00:46:05,826
Yeah, they are good,

888
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:08,654
but the musicians
in New Orleans are better.

889
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,438
We'll be using all the same boys

890
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:11,507
that cut all Fats Domino's records.

891
00:46:11,517 --> 00:46:12,921
Lee Allen, Red Tyler,

892
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:14,481
Earl Palmer...

893
00:46:14,517 --> 00:46:15,783
I mean, don't get no better than that.

894
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:18,757
Couldn't you talk to him?

895
00:46:18,793 --> 00:46:21,654
I mean, I want to use my boys.

896
00:46:21,689 --> 00:46:25,688
Richard, honestly,
I don't think it would help.

897
00:46:25,758 --> 00:46:27,792
Specialty is going to sign me, right?

898
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,748
Well, that's
Mr. Rupe's decision.

899
00:46:29,758 --> 00:46:31,619
But he will make that decision

900
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:34,550
after he hears the songs you record.

901
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,654
So do we have a date?

902
00:46:36,724 --> 00:46:38,481
I'll be there.

903
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,274
Little Richie sure is purty.

904
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,309
Pretty hair, pretty mustache.

905

1008

1011
00:51:33,275 --> 00:51:35,585
Hotter than fish grease in the summertime

1012
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,826
and prettier than a flower

1013
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:39,895
How you doing?
I'm Little Richard.

1014
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,541
Good to finally meet you, Richard.

1015
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:43,852
Boy, that was one heck of a song
you recorded for us.

1016
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:45,714
Oh, well, you know, I do try.

1017
00:51:45,724 --> 00:51:47,024
So, Richard, you want to sit down

1018
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,171
and talk turkey with me?

1019
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:50,999
And stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce...

1020
00:51:51,034 --> 00:51:52,999
anything you got... come on.

1021
00:51:53,034 --> 00:51:55,171
Richard, this is the standard deal...

1022
00:51:55,206 --> 00:51:57,585
the only deal I give to all my artists.

1023
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,723
I pay for recording, the band,
for Bump to produce you.

1024
00:52:00,758 --> 00:52:04,240
I pay for the record to get
mastered, pressed and released.

1025
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:06,654
When you go with your band on tour

1026
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:08,240
and are worshipped by millions

1027
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:11,067
I pay for the airlines, hotels, limos,

1028
00:52:11,103 --> 00:52:13,861
and grease for the fat union guys.

1029
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:17,619
There's a royalty, which is
five percent of 90% of retail

1030
00:52:17,655 --> 00:52:20,654
not including a broadcast fee
which is calculated

1031
00:52:20,689 --> 00:52:23,265
on the amount of airplay a song receives,

1032
00:52:23,275 --> 00:52:25,585
which in your case will be plenty.

1033
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,619
Any questions?

1034
00:52:27,655 --> 00:52:29,171
Yeah.

1035
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:31,240
I am gonna make some money, right?

1036
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:37,067
I think I can safely guarantee that.

1037
00:52:37,103 --> 00:52:39,619
The most important things
to understand, Richard,

1038
00:52:39,655 --> 00:52:41,067
are this contract is binding,

1039
00:52:41,103 --> 00:52:42,921
you are gonna be famous,

1040
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:44,550

00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:37,274
Covering it?
He's killing it!

1083
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,757
Ooh, when I see that white boy,
he gonna get his back dirty.

1084
00:54:39,793 --> 00:54:41,196
I'm hot! How come
that radio station's

1085
00:54:41,206 --> 00:54:42,757
not playing my record, huh?!

1086
00:54:42,793 --> 00:54:44,231
Richard, maybe you haven't noticed,

1087
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:45,309
but you're not white,

1088
00:54:45,379 --> 00:54:46,895
and that is a white radio station.

1089
00:54:46,931 --> 00:54:48,886
At least Richard can sing.

1090
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:51,205
Listen, look at it as a good thing.

1091
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:53,792
I mean, Boone will cross the tune over

1092
00:54:53,862 --> 00:54:55,964
to all those audiences we can't get at.

1093
00:54:56,034 --> 00:54:57,403
We'll get a whole lot more exposure.

1094
00:54:57,413 --> 00:54:58,861
It's all right, honey.

1095
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,300
At least you get to make some money.

1096
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:01,826
A little.

1097
00:55:01,862 --> 00:55:03,412
What you mean, "a little"?!

1098
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:04,792
That's my song!

1099
00:55:04,827 --> 00:55:06,378
Rupe owns the publishing company

1100
00:55:06,448 --> 00:55:08,274
that buys from his record company.

1101
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,102
You get a half a cent per song.

1102
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:12,516
What...?!
A half a cent?!

1103
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:14,447
Whoever heard of cutting a penny in half!

1104
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:17,274
Hey, you'll get no argument from me.

1105
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,481
So what do I do now?

1106
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:21,516
Nothing. You just
keep recording.

1107
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:23,274
- That's it?
- Yes.

1108
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,472
And-And you sing your songs
and you sing them right.

1109
00:55:26,482 --> 00:55:27,930
You make them so yours

1110
00:55:27,965 --> 00:55:29,930
that no one would dare copy them.

1111
00:55:29,965 --> 00:55:31,412
You understand?

1112
00:55:33,793 --> 00:55:35,309
All right.

1113
00:55:35,344 --> 00:55:36,378

What we need to do
is go talk to Henry Nash.

1202
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:42,792
Robert, Henry ain't here.

1203
00:59:42,827 --> 00:59:44,886
Since you our manager now,
go tell the white boss man

1204
00:59:44,896 --> 00:59:47,274
that his darkies won't be
changing on the bus no more.

1205
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:49,205
Yes, sir, Mr. Penniman.

1206
00:59:49,241 --> 00:59:50,619
I tells 'em straight.

1207
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,679
We'll be using them warm changing rooms.

1208
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:53,481
Oh, yeah, right.

1209
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:55,378
No, but tell 'em
to expect some naked Negroes

1210
00:59:55,413 --> 00:59:56,576
on the premises.

1211
00:59:56,586 --> 00:59:57,783
Oh, that's bad, man, that's bad.

1212
00:59:57,793 --> 01:00:00,378
Yes, sir. Anything else
I should convey?

1213
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:01,792
You want the boss man

1214
01:00:01,862 --> 01:00:03,654
to prepare y'all a little snack?

1215
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:05,102
- Say, some chicken?
- Barbecue!

1216
01:00:05,137 --> 01:00:07,231
Well, if ain't too much trouble

1217
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:08,757
I prefer champagne.

1218
01:00:08,793 --> 01:00:10,274

1219
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,541
Miss Lucille, no trouble no trouble at all.

1220
01:00:12,551 --> 01:00:14,274
Any other requests?

1221
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,999
Yeah, we tired of wearing
all this sissy-ass makeup.

1222
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:33,412
Ri... Richard, I'm sorry

1223
01:00:33,448 --> 01:00:35,792
but, I mean, this stuff

1224
01:00:35,827 --> 01:00:38,067
just don't... just don't seem
to be bothering you

1225
01:00:38,103 --> 01:00:39,723
like it's bothering all the rest of us.

1226
01:00:39,758 --> 01:00:40,852
Being pretty ain't never bothered me.

1227
01:00:40,862 --> 01:00:42,274
Ain't that right, Lucille?

1228
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,723
About the prettiest boy I've ever seen.

1229
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:47,447
Now, sneaking in the back door
so white folks don't see us

1230
01:00:47,517 --> 01:00:48,748
till we on stage,

1231
01:00:48,758 --> 01:00:51,309
eating in a parking lot of some restaurant

1232
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:53,058
I wouldn't even pay to eat
at the counter at...

1233
01:00:53,068 --> 01:00:55,102
Now, that bothers me.

1234
01:00:55,137 --> 01:00:57,102
Being called a sissy?

1235
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:04,792
You looky here.

1236
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,792
Them white kids?
They dancing to our music.

1237
01:01:07,827 --> 01:01:10,343
Okay? They may have Pat Boone
on their record player

1238
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:12,136
in case their parents walk in

1239
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:14,447
but they got my record
underneath their pillow.

1240
01:01:14,482 --> 01:01:16,274
You know this joint we playing here?

1241
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,472
You know how many coloreds
have played here?

1242
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:20,481
None. You know why?

1243
01:01:20,517 --> 01:01:22,136
'Cause they can't.

1244
01:01:22,172 --> 01:01:23,619
I am the first.

1245
01:01:23,655 --> 01:01:25,205
I am the only.

1246
01:01:25,275 --> 01:01:27,757
So if you want to call me sissy, go ahead.

1247
01:01:27,793 --> 01:01:30,550
Knock yourself out, boy.

1248
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:34,309
But you make sure you call me a rich sissy.

1249
01:01:34,344 --> 01:01:37,723
And you do as I do,

1250
01:01:37,793 --> 01:01:40,136
you all gonna be rich sissies, too.

1251
01:01:42,517 --> 01:01:44,205
Now, where my eyeliner?

1252
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:45,861
I want to be a rich sissy.

1253
01:01:45,931 --> 01:01:47,723
Give me that powder puff.

1254
01:01:47,793 --> 01:01:49,792
I like that.
Rich Sissy.

1255
01:01:49,827 --> 01:01:52,300
Now, we want a nice,
clean show, Mr. Richard.

1256
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:55,127

This is Greenville,

and we have standards and decency here.

1258
01:01:57,344 --> 01:01:59,343
I'm sure you won't disappoint us.

1259

A good, clean show, you said.

1260
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,541
Good, clean entertainment.

1261
01:02:02,551 --> 01:02:05,240
You see, we don't want anyone
getting too excited now.

Where's Richard?

1312
01:04:19,586 --> 01:04:23,964
I want to have a party with Richard.

1313
01:04:26,517 --> 01:04:28,990
Little Richard, I love you.

1314
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,817
Yeah, I love you, too, baby.

1315
01:04:30,827 --> 01:04:33,688
I love you, baby.
Baby, I...

1316
01:04:33,724 --> 01:04:35,516
Henry! Henry Nash.

1317
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:36,964
Hey, hey.

1318
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,343
Come on, come on.

1319
01:04:41,655 --> 01:04:43,826
Tutti-frutti, baby.

1320
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,585
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1321
01:04:46,655 --> 01:04:48,679
Done had too much to drink, now.

1322
01:04:48,689 --> 01:04:50,723
Hey, Richard.
Sorry about that.

1323
01:04:50,758 --> 01:04:52,472
I just wanna have a party with Richard.

1324
01:04:52,482 --> 01:04:53,852
Richard.

1325
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:56,990
I need a little money for the bartender.

1326
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,481
Whatever you want, bro.

1327
01:04:59,517 --> 01:05:01,714
Go ahead. Help yourself.

1328
01:05:01,724 --> 01:05:02,964
Thank you.

1329
01:05:03,034 --> 01:05:05,369
Miss Lucille.

1330
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:07,403
Lucille, child.

1331
01:05:07,413 --> 01:05:10,964
Why don't you go get
your king a glass of water.

1332
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:13,723
As you wish, sire.

1333
01:05:21,068 --> 01:05:24,033
Yeah, and you, too, pretty boy.

1334
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:29,886
Mmm... with all
them nice muscles.

1335
01:05:29,896 --> 01:05:32,723
Mmm. What's your name,
young princess?

1336
01:05:32,758 --> 01:05:35,102
- Jesse.
- Ooh, Jesse!

1337
01:05:35,137 --> 01:05:39,895
Where'd you get
all that pretty skin? Mmm!

1338
01:05:39,931 --> 01:05:41,447
Both of you look good.

1339
01:05:41,482 --> 01:05:44,033
Make my big toe just shoot up in my boot.

1340
01:05:46,034 --> 01:05:48,619
Mmm. Why don't y'all kiss
for Little Richard?

1341
01:05:48,689 --> 01:05:51,481
Come on.

1342
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:53,585
It's for Little Richard.
Just a little.

1343
01:05:58,551 --> 01:05:59,551
Come on.

1344
01:06:02,931 --> 01:06:05,067
See you later, Richard.

1345
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,136
Richard.

1346
01:06:09,172 --> 01:06:11,136
Hey, there, Bump.

1347
01:06:11,172 --> 01:06:13,033
Miss Lucille.

1348
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:15,472
Bump Blackwell,
all the way from Los Angeles.

1349
01:06:15,482 --> 01:06:17,205
To what do I owe the honor?

1350
01:06:17,241 --> 01:06:19,645
You're up for a big Hollywood
movie... a Jane Mansfield flick.

1351
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:22,585
Little Richard and Jane Mansfield.

1352
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,481
Hmm. I like it.

1353
01:06:24,517 --> 01:06:26,117
Richard, can I talk to you for a minute?

1354
01:06:26,137 --> 01:06:28,516
Excuse me, child.

1355
01:06:30,172 --> 01:06:32,757
Maybe your daddy won't approve of you.

1356
01:06:32,793 --> 01:06:33,930
Look at this.

1357
01:06:33,965 --> 01:06:35,757
Richard, come here.

1358
01:06:35,793 --> 01:06:38,585
Good times...
tell me about it.

1359
01:06:39,931 --> 01:06:41,127
So what about this movie?

1360
01:06:41,137 --> 01:06:42,999
You know, it's a great deal, Richard

1361
01:06:43,034 --> 01:06:44,645
but I'm worried.

1362
01:06:44,655 --> 01:06:46,783
You see, these Hollywood boys
are a sensitive bunch,

1363
01:06:46,793 --> 01:06:48,127
and I don't think they're ready

1364
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,757
for some out of control wild man.

1365
01:06:49,793 --> 01:06:50,964
Who says I'm out of control?

1366
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,481
Mr. Jackson, Mr. Grant,
and Mr. Franklin.

1367
01:06:53,517 --> 01:06:55,516
Oh, what? You still
Mr. Rupe's errand boy?

1368
01:06:55,551 --> 01:06:57,196
He sent you down here
to go through my pockets?

1369
01:06:57,206 --> 01:06:59,792
That's my money.
That ain't Mr. Rupe's money.

1370
01:06:59,827 --> 01:07:01,541
This has nothing to do with Rupe.

1371
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:03,067
This has everything to do with you.

1372
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,610
Richard, you keep money in a suitcase,

1373
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,196
and you gonna wake up
one morning without any.

1374
01:07:06,206 --> 01:07:08,196
And don't even get me started
about the IRS.

1375
01:07:08,206 --> 01:07:11,714
You are skating on a very thin edge.

1376
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:14,999
Last night's concert was damn near a riot.

1377
01:07:15,034 --> 01:07:16,585
And now you've got this party

1378
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:19,033
two beers and a light switch
away from being an orgy!

1379
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:21,999
An all-out orgy!
With white women.

1380
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:23,541
White women!

1381
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:25,679
Man, have you forgotten
where the hell you are?

1382
01:07:25,689 --> 01:07:27,205
This is the South.

1383
01:07:27,241 --> 01:07:29,757
You think you're too big to be lynched?

1384
01:07:29,827 --> 01:07:31,033
Yes, I do.

1385
01:07:31,068 --> 01:07:33,024
Why? Because you have
a few hits?

1386
01:07:33,034 --> 01:07:35,861
No, 'cause I give people a chance to shout.

1387
01:07:35,896 --> 01:07:38,930
That's right, I am the genie
up out of the bottle

1388
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,688
and I ain't going back in.

1389
01:07:42,551 --> 01:07:47,033
Richard, you are talking completely crazy.

1390
01:07:47,068 --> 01:07:49,654
Says who?
You ain't my father, Bump.

1391
01:07:49,689 --> 01:07:51,024
You can't stand there

1392
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:53,205
and tell me what's crazy and what's not!

1393
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:54,619
If I was your father,

1394
01:07:54,689 --> 01:07:56,129
I'd be whupping your hide right now.

1395
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,861
But you ain't.
So you can go to hell.

1396
01:08:02,655 --> 01:08:05,102
Come on, baby, let's take a drive.

1397
01:08:05,137 --> 01:08:06,274
Come on.

1398
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:14,102
Ooh-wee, Lord, look at them getting it on

1399
01:08:14,137 --> 01:08:16,930
like two pigs in a gunny sack.

1400
01:08:17,896 --> 01:08:20,033
Yeah, go get it now.

1401
01:08:23,172 --> 01:08:24,654
What's wrong with you?

1402
01:08:24,724 --> 01:08:27,102
I need more.

1403
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:28,610
Just wait.

1404
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,093
Okay? He look like he's
about to finish

1405
01:08:30,103 --> 01:08:31,654
and I want to see it.

1406
01:08:31,689 --> 01:08:33,921
Richard, you have this idea of me

1407
01:08:33,931 --> 01:08:35,102
that is not all true.

1408
01:08:35,137 --> 01:08:39,136
You think all I am is this.

1409
01:08:39,172 --> 01:08:40,723
This is Little Richard Weekend.

1410
01:08:40,758 --> 01:08:41,826
Well, honey...

1411
01:08:41,896 --> 01:08:42,921
you are all that.

1412
01:08:42,931 --> 01:08:44,093
With his new hit

1413
01:08:44,103 --> 01:08:45,826

1414
01:08:45,896 --> 01:08:47,955

Maybe you're finding it
difficult to believe

1472
01:11:57,068 --> 01:12:02,481
in your heart that your sin
has been forgiven.

1473
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:05,033
Perhaps you're thinking

1474

"I have lustful thoughts."

1475
01:12:07,965 --> 01:12:09,964
But the fact is

1476
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,033
He has forgiven you.

1477
01:12:13,103 --> 01:12:14,136
You simply need

1478
01:12:14,172 --> 01:12:16,999
to claim His forgiveness

1479
01:12:17,034 --> 01:12:20,964
and believe His promise.

1480
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,309
Psalms 103-11 says

1481
01:12:22,344 --> 01:12:24,955
"As far as the East

1482
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:27,861

1486
01:12:32,862 --> 01:12:34,481
as the East is from the West.

1487
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,274
You've been listening
to the Reverend Grace...

1488
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,516
Yeah.

Oh, brah.

1493
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:17,999
How you doing, baby?

1494
01:13:18,034 --> 01:13:20,930
Oh, it sure is good to see you.

1495
01:13:23,517 --> 01:13:25,619
Look at you, Richard.

1496
01:13:25,689 --> 01:13:30,378
Ma, why you living up here
in this little room?

1497
01:13:30,413 --> 01:13:32,516
I'm comfortable here.

1498
01:13:32,551 --> 01:13:34,412
I take walks.

1499
01:13:34,482 --> 01:13:35,585
Walks?

1500
01:13:35,655 --> 01:13:37,171
Ma, this ain't a park.

1501
01:13:37,206 --> 01:13:38,378
It's a house.

1502
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:40,378
Oh, quit your yelling.

1503
01:13:40,413 --> 01:13:42,550
I got everything I need here.

1504
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:43,852
Everything.

1505
01:13:43,862 --> 01:13:46,999
I got all my things here

1506
01:13:47,034 --> 01:13:48,412
and all my memories.

1507
01:13:48,482 --> 01:13:50,930
But Ma...

1508
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:53,999
Brah, you want a cup of coffee
or a cup of tea?

1509
01:13:58,413 --> 01:14:01,447
Ma, are you happy?

1510
01:14:01,482 --> 01:14:04,481
Happy about what?

1511
01:14:04,517 --> 01:14:07,585
Moving to Los Angeles.

1512
01:14:08,931 --> 01:14:11,265
Oh, child.

1513
01:14:11,275 --> 01:14:14,343
Don't worry about me.

1514
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:18,343
It's just an adjustment, that's all.

1515
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:21,481
You live your life one way,

1516
01:14:21,517 --> 01:14:24,093
and it's hard to change.

1517
01:14:24,103 --> 01:14:28,274
All I ever knew was Macon.

1518
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:31,964
I miss my friends and some of my kin.

1519
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,102
Of course I do.

1520
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:37,654
Now I don't have no regrets now.

1521
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:41,093
I don't have no regrets.

1522
01:14:41,103 --> 01:14:43,240
Now what about...

1523
01:14:43,275 --> 01:14:45,240
what about you, Richard?

1524
01:14:47,551 --> 01:14:49,481
Are you happy?

1525
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,447
I don't know.

1526
01:14:54,482 --> 01:14:56,274
I should be.

1527
01:14:56,310 --> 01:15:00,067
Should be and being
are two different animals,

1528
01:15:00,103 --> 01:15:02,136
now, ain't they?

1529
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:07,136
Yeah, I'd say so.

1530
01:15:09,517 --> 01:15:12,412
You always been uncommon, brah.

1531
01:15:12,482 --> 01:15:16,999
That short leg and your big old head.

1532
01:15:18,517 --> 01:15:22,654
You have a gift that moves people.

1533
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:27,162
Make them feel what you're feeling.

1534
01:15:27,172 --> 01:15:28,481
But in the end

1535
01:15:28,517 --> 01:15:31,688
you got to do what's good for you.

1536
01:15:33,482 --> 01:15:37,240
You got to do what makes you happy.

1537
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:40,334
I just don't know what that is.

1538
01:15:40,344 --> 01:15:44,067
Then you're gonna have to
find out now, ain't you?

1539
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:48,378
I got one more question I need to ask you.

1540
01:15:48,448 --> 01:15:50,447
Tea or coffee?

1541
01:16:24,724 --> 01:16:26,403
Hello, sir.

1542
01:16:26,413 --> 01:16:28,792
My name is Brother Lucher.

1543
01:16:28,862 --> 01:16:30,309
I am a missionary

1544
01:16:30,379 --> 01:16:32,826
for the Church of God
of The Ten Commandments,

1545
01:16:32,896 --> 01:16:36,757
and I have a very simple question for you.

1546
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:39,550
Have you heard the word of God today?

1547
01:16:41,448 --> 01:16:43,516
I know you.

1548
01:16:43,551 --> 01:16:45,447
Joe Lucher.

1549
01:16:45,482 --> 01:16:48,067
You was a musician when I was a kid.

1550
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,757
You was famous.

1551
01:16:49,793 --> 01:16:53,136
Yeah, they used to call you
King of The Mambo, didn't they?

1552
01:16:53,206 --> 01:16:56,412
I gave it up to become an evangelist.

1553
01:16:56,448 --> 01:16:59,067
I run a mission and
a soup kitchen downtown.

1554
01:16:59,103 --> 01:17:00,861
Come on in, now.

1555
01:17:00,931 --> 01:17:02,619
Come on.

1556
01:17:04,655 --> 01:17:08,438
I'm going to Australia
on tour in a couple days.

1557
01:17:08,448 --> 01:17:11,309
And I'm worried.

1558
01:17:11,344 --> 01:17:13,481
What are you worried about?

1559
01:17:13,517 --> 01:17:16,127
It just don't feel right.

1560
01:17:16,137 --> 01:17:17,654
I know I'm tired and all,

1561
01:17:17,689 --> 01:17:22,171
but it just don't feel right no more.

1562
01:17:22,206 --> 01:17:24,792
What is it you want, Richard?

1563
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,619
I want to be free.

1564
01:17:32,379 --> 01:17:37,619
I mean, sometimes
I just want to be totally free.

1565
01:17:41,862 --> 01:17:43,826
Everything's possible

1566
01:17:43,862 --> 01:17:46,447
