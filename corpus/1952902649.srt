1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,620
- Hello?
- Hello.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,220
- Uh, yes?
- Who is this?

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,500
- Who are you calling?
- Who am I speaking to?

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,590
- Wrong number.
- Who was that?

5
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,930
- Oh, nobody.
- Did you pick a movie?

6
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,430
- Yeah, we re gonna go scary: Saw IV.
- Oh, I saw that in theaters. It sucks.

7
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,770
It's not scary, it's gross. I hate all that torture porn shit.

8
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,770
Why, angry feel.

9
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:51,110
- Well, I like Jigsaw. I think he kills people very
creatively. - But she don't give a shit who dies...

10
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,880
...cos there's no character to fill a man.
It's just body parts whipping and blood spewing.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,890
- Who you keep texting? - I have a Facebook stalker.
He keeps leaving me messages.

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,860
- Nah, like what? - Just stuff like: Hey,
what's up? You are hot. I want to kill you...

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,400
- Well, delete him.
- I did it, but he hacked its way back in.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,940
- Or report him.
- He is really hot, tho. You wanna see?

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,800
- That's Channing Tatum.
- It is not. Is it?

16
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,610
Yeah, from his Abercrombie days.
You were being punk'd.

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,700
- Hello?
- Who is this?

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,060
The more impatient version
of the person you just spoke to.

19
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,530
I am sorry. You don't have to be a bitch about it.
- Of course I don't. Eat me.

20
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,600
- You hang up on me and I cut thru
your neck until I feel bone! - Who is it?

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,540
It's for you.

22
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,400
- Hello?
- Who is this?

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,800
- It's Trudie. Who's this?
- This is the last person you ever gonna see alive.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,380
- It's a prank. Hang up.
- Why did you give the phone to me?

25
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,590
- You are the one with a stalker.
- Are the doors locked?

26
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,890
Don't freak out.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Let it ring.

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,340
It's from stalker boy.
He said "Answer the phone".

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,340
For God's sake, it's a joke Trudie.
It's probably Lexie or Karen.

30
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,410
- Where are you going?
- To make sure the front door is locked.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,550
- No, don't open it.
- You're overreacting.

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,160
It's a joke, Trudie, ok? Someone made a
dummy profile. They re just trying to scare you.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,960
Wait. Who is it?

34
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,380
I said, who is it?
Let's call the cops.

35
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,390
"I dare you to open the door."
No, Sherri, don't. No, don't, I'm scared.

36
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,560
It could be anyone that we know.
Lisa, Bailey, Wayne.

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,870
Or the hoped-for long shot, Channing Tatum.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,180
There is nobody out here.

39
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,960
What is it say?

40
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,190
It says "I'm not outside,
I am right beside you."

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,610
Trudie!

42
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,790
- Fucking kidding me?
- What?

43
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,960
That was so fucking stupid. Pure horse shit.
The death of horror right here in front of us!

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,760
- I jumped. It scared me.
- A fucking Facebook killer? You re kidding me right?

45
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,580
I guess now it would be Twitter.
That'd make more sense.

46
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,710
Under articulate teens sit around and deconstruct
horror movies until Ghostface kills them one by one.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,640
It's been done to death. The whole self-aware
post-modern meta-shit.

48
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,980
Stick a fork in 1996 already.

49
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,620
I like the Stab movies. They are scarier.

50
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,020
It's not aliens or zombies
or little Asian ghost girls.

51
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,860
There is something real about a guy
with a knife who just ... snaps.

52
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,880
- It can really happen.
- I can't do it. These people don't know when to stop.

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,140
They just keep recycling the same shit.

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,160
Even the opening scene, there is always
some random girl who gets a call that
undoubtedly ends up getting her killed.

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,780
It's all so predictable.
There's no element of surprise.

56
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,740
You can see everything coming.

57
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,850
Did that surprise you?

58
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,630
- Why?
- Because you talk too much.

59
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,060
Now shut the fuck up
and watch the movie.

60
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,270
Oh my God. I love it.

61
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,440
I've seen it five times,
and it still gets me every time.

62
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:40,420
- You re kidding? I don't get it.
- Ok, it's like the Twilight Zone.

63
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,350
- Twilight zone...
- A movie within a movie.

64
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,090
I get that. But it's illogical..

65
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,730
It begs the question that if the beginning of Stab 7 is
Stab 6 then it's the beginning of Stab 6 Stab 5?

66
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,730
And if so, what is Stab 4 about?

67
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,330
- You re over thinking it.- Am I or did you
ever make it, just under think it, there's
a reason i don't watch these movies?

68
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,900
I can't believe you haven't seen them.
We live in Woodsboro.

69
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,180
It has nothing to do with Woodsboro.
I thought you said Stab was based on true stories.

70
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,550
The first three,
the original trilogy is based off of Sidney Prescott.

71
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,720
But then she threatened to sue em if they used
the true story so they just started making stuff up.

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,150
Stab 5 has time travel, which is by far the worst.

73
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,730
- And don't you have enough about this story every
year? - At least Woodsboro is known for something.

74
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,800
Did you hear that?

75
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,170
Uh, no, I didn't hear anything.

76
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,470
I did.

77
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,170
Jenny, don't try to scare me.

78
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,310
I am not trying to scare you.

79
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,470
You do it all the time.

80
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,710
No, I don't.

81
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,840
Where are you going?

82
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,540
I told you, I heard something.

83
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,150
I know you re trying to scare me.

84
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,980
I am not.

85
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,560
What is it?

86
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,260
I must have left the window in my room open.

87
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,530
- Could you get that? Marnie?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,110
- Hello?
- Hello. Who is this?

89
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,440
Marnie. Who is this?

90
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,550
This is the last person you ever gonna see alive.

91
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,220
What?

92
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,020
- I am sorry. I had to.
- You bitch!

93
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,330
- So not funny.
- Somebody falls for it every year.

94
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,670
- I don't see why you get off on this shi.....
- Marnie?

95
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,340
Marnie? Marnie?!?

96
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,690
Good one, Marnie. Lights out, phone on the floor.

97
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,590
You know, you really should direct horror films.

98
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,760
Wherever you are...

99
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,770
Lemme guess. You want me to walk
by an open door frame so you can pop out, huh?

100
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:20,740
Ok. Timing, timing is perfect. But you don't have the
app on your phone, so you can't talk like Ghostface.

101
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,650
- Can you?
- Yes, I can.

102
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,950
- Who is this?
- Not an app.

103
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,750
- Is this Trevor?
- Do I sound like a Trevor to you?

104
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,460
Think of me as your director. You re in my movie.
You got a fun part so don't blow it.

105
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,000
- What movie?
- Same one Marnie's in, only her part got cut way back.

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,570
But you, you re dumb blond with the big tits.
We'll have some fun with you before you die.

107
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,770
I have a 4.0 GPA (Grade Point Average) and
135 IQ asshole. What did you do with Marnie?

108
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,380
- She's on the cutting room floor.
- That's not funny.

109
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,880
This isn't a comedy, it's a horror film.
People live, people die.

110
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
And you'd better start running.

111
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,260
Marnie?

112
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,060
- What do you think?
- Well, I guess today's the anniversary.

113
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,290
- Kids...
- No, I meant the display.

114
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,970
- It's good.
- Told the owner I'd kill his cat if you didn't get a ring.

115
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,510
Nice...

116
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,850
- Woah, 25 to stay alive!
- Shit! Sorry Sheriff!

117
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,920
Kirby...

118
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,610
Ehi, before you get in the car, you
have to promise not to kill me.

119
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,740
Why? What did you do?

120
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,410
Trevor called me last night.

121
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,980
Why is he calling you?

122
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,480
Because you won't take his calls, he knows
I have your ear and he wants to know.

123
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,550
- Know what?
- How upset you are.

124
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,120
- Can we just not talk about this?
- Fine, fine.

125
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,690
So, Trevor called me last night.

126
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,630
He called you too?

127
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,600
He's afraid your cousin coming to Woodsboro is
distracting you from knowing how sorry he really is.

128
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,670
- Well, that's inventive.
- God...

129
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,340
Oh, by the way, have you seen the Grim Reaper?
Angel of Death?

130
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,680
What are you talking about?

131
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,250
Your cousin. Last stop in a book tour,
first stop in a road to a new life.

132
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,090
It's very dramatic.
She's the reason why I love horror movies.

133
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,560
I'm sure she'd love to hear that.
If I knew her which, I don't really.

134
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,230
Well, wherever she went, peple died.
Other people. It was never her.

135
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,730
I mean, Stab is the wrong franchise for her,
it should be Final Destination.

136
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,230
- And why is Jenny Randall calling me?

137
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,970
- I cannot stand Jenny Randall...
- Hello?

138
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,110
- Oh, Jill...
- Why?

139
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,110
- Shh... Jenny, is this you?

140
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,280
What's your favorite scary movie?

141
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,050
- Ok, who is this?
- What does she want?

142
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,150
- I said, who is this?
- I asked you a question.

143
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,820
What's your favorite scary movie?

144
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,690
I'm hanging up.

145
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,830
Wow, that was original.

146
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,260
I got a call like that this
morning from Marnie the Carnie.

147
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,530
- What?
- Watch out!

148
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,470
- Nice proof asshole!
- Ok...

149
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,770
- You should really stop at sign.
- Sorry...

150
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,880
Angel of Death.

151
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,350
- Mayor wants these down before lunch.
- Only 25 more to go.

152
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,490
- Morning Sheriff.
- Morning Deputy. Joe.

153
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,700
Morning Sheriff.

154
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,070
- Looks like the celebration's begun.
- High School kids probably.

155
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,500
Yeah. One generation's tragedy is the next one's joke.

156
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,310
Sorry you can never get away from this.

157
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,950
You know, I wish I had been old enough to be
part of the Forest when you were solving those crimes.

158
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,720
It's those intense investigations
that really bond relationships.

159
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,290
- Yeah.
- How's Gale by the way?

160
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,490
Gale's good. She's writing... fiction.

161
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,660
Hey I made some lemon squares, they're in my car.

162
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,270
Thanks Deputy, but no, thanks.

163
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,140
Sheriff, you're not cheating on your
wife if you eat my lemon square.

164
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,140
Yeah, but I would be cheating on the diet.

165
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Sheriff Riley! Come in! Sheriff Riley!

166
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,210
This is Sheriff Riley, go ahead.

167
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,250
You gotta get over to the Randall house right
away. It's bad Sheriff, real bad.

168
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,470
The book is "Out of Darkness" and its
author Sidney Prescott is here with us today.

169
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:01,840
Have the 7 Stab movies all based on Gale Weathers'
books about you made it even harder to go on?

170
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:08,680
I don't blame Gale, that's in the past. Now if I was
a victim for too long, it was up to me to reinvent myself.

171
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,250
- That's why I wrote this book. - Sidney
Prescott, everybody. And rave reviews
for her book, "Out of Darkness".

172
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,660
Allright Gale, let's do it. Let's reinvent myself.

173
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:30,830
Except, I have no fucking idea what to write!

174
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,280
- How's that new? - That's the 2.0 upgrade version.
I am totally mobile, man.

175
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,480
Nice.

176
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:53,120
Ouh, this is Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer,
here with the luscious Olivia "Don't
look at my tits, I have a mind" Morris.

177
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,590
Here is my Woodsboro masquerade anniversary
question: What is your favorite scary movie?

178
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,100
Is that all you got? Some stupid douche question?

179
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,630
Yeah, where did you hear that anyway?

180
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,670
It's a line from Stab 1. Hey Charlie.

181
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,870
- You re a genre nut Kirby,
what's your favorite scary movie? - Bambi.

182
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,170
- Dork.
- What?

183
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,870
That's... funny, Kirby.

184
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,280
- Completely unaware you exist.
- No, man, she wants me.

185
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,950
Yeah, I wish, right? Asshole.

186
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:30,330
- I think Charlie likes you. - And I like him.
To tease, to torment, to make him squirm.

187
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,600
You could do a lot worse, trust me.

188
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,200
Oh, hi Trevor. Bye Trevor.

189
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,370
Can we talk?
Somebody cares about you over here you know?

190
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,370
Someone who made you really happy once.

191
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,050
Someone who never should have let you go.

192
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,950
When you re done with a phone call,
you let someone go...

193
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,920
When you take someone to the airport,
you let them go...

194
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,720
When you tell someone you love her, and she gives you
everything, and then you go out with someone else...

195
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,000
that is not letting her go,
that is dumping her. Ok? That's betrayal.

196
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,140
Trevor Sheldon denied live on Hall Pass with
Robbie Mercer. What is your favorite scary movie, man?

197
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,370
I'll show you.

198
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:27,420
Now I began to believe myself that that was all I
was, a victim. And that was unacceptable to me...

199
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:35,390
So, I sat down and began to write
a new role that would be my own.

200
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,000
A role for a woman who could leave the walls
of fear behind and step out into the sunlight.

201
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,670
Out of Darkness.

202
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:50,170
- Thank you. - Ok, we re gonna start the book
signing in a sec, so buy your copies while they last.

203
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,740
- May you ladies.
- New York Times best seller. Rave reviews...

204
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,220
- Gale... I am glad you came.
- Congratulations, Sidney.

205
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,650
- I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but...
- Well, you can get one.

206
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,460
- Dewey! Ehi!
- Hey, Sidney. Gale, you made it.

207
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,830
What's going on Dewey?

208
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,500
Hey, Sid, I am sorry. I gotta do
something... I am really sorry.

209
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,970
Excuse me. This will only take a minute. I need
you all to stay where you are and remain silent.

210
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,170
Nobody leaves, you heard the Sheriff, thanks you.

211
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,210
- Can't this wait 45, I am running an event here.
- M'am this is a police event now.

212
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,250
- What's going on? - Gale, this is police business.
If you could just let us handle this.

213
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,180
I am talking to my husband, Deputy Judy.

214
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,360
Listen. There's a phone we believe may have
been taken from the scene of a crime.

215
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,690
Deputy Hicks has traced its location
back to these coordinates.

216
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,230
- The rest is "need to know".
- And I am not "need to know"?

217
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,060
Shhhh.

218
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,430
Sheriff! Ringing out here!

219
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,140
There.

220
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,250
- It's coming from the trunk
- Yeah.

221
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,750
- Dewey...
- They need everyone to stay back.

222
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,720
- Not now, Sid.
- It's my rental.

223
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,400
- Damn.
- It's now official crime scene. Let's lock it down.

224
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,630
- Crime scene. - Detach him right out of here.
Everybody back. - Give me that camera. - Stand back.

225
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,150
- Give me that camera.
- Stand back.

226
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,070
- Please tell me this is a prank, Dewey.
- I am afraid not, Sid. Come on.

227
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,440
- Amber, you re not gonna believe this...

228
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
- Stand back, Gale. Gale.
- Just wanna see.

229
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,250
Ok, essays are due Tuesday,
"Why Woodsboro is the best..."

230
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,290
Anything with an on-off swith should be off,
that's the rule.

231
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,190
Somebody wanna share?

232
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,260
Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper
were murdered last night. - What?

233
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,970
- What? - Stabbed to death.

234
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,400
- What's your favorite scary movie? - Shut up!

235
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,540
Y'all Tuesday, class is not hold then
- That was fast.

236
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,240
This week marks the anniversary of
the infamous Woodsboro murders.

237
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,950
Two girls killed the exact day local celebrity victim
Sidney Prescott chose to return to her hometown.

238
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,950
It could be something right out of a Gale
Weathers' best seller. And where is she now?

239
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,160
Well, living right here in Woodsboro, cos
she's the wife of Sheriff Dewey Riley - Mrs Riley - Hoss.

240
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,890
- First Lady.
- Perkins.

241
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,260
Excuse me, Gale. He's conducting an interview.

242
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,100
- Great! I love interviews.
- You have to wait, Gale. Sorry, can't let you in there.

243
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,700
What are you gonna do? Arrest me, Deputy Judy?

244
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,510
If it comes to it. Civilian interference with a police
investigation poses many a problem in a court of law.

245
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,550
Ok. Listen to me Judy. I don't mind that
you re working with my hudband.

246
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,680
Or that you re even baking those little treats, as you do

247
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,190
But if you re gonna start acting like him, you gotta
put a mustache on, cos you sound ridiculous - Gale.

248
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,890
- Judy.
- Gale!

249
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,790
Deputy. Gale. Calm please.

250
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,300
- Uh, Sidney, if you don't mind giving us a minute.
- Sid. - Hi, Gale.

251
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,870
Dewey, would you please explain to Betty Crocker
that I have every right to be here?

252
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,540
If there's been another murder in Woodsboro obviusly....

253
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,010
- That is not public information.
- It is all over the Internet, Dewey.

254
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,720
- It is?
- Yes, the whole world knows about it before me.

255
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,090
She wants to be a part of the investigation, Sheriff.

256
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:29,860
Ok. Hang on. Uhm, are you familiar with
the phrase "I wrote a book on this"?

257
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:39,270
- Gale, with all due respect, I don't see how that
pertains to... - Because I wrote the book on this.

258
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,080
"The Woodsboro murders" by Gale Weathers.
- But you re not a reporter anymore, Gale.

259
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,180
- Woh, woh, woh..
- And even if you were...

260
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,780
Woh. Don't treat me like I'm the media.

261
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:54,820
I helped solve these things. 3 times, remember?
You and me, together.

262
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,120
- But I am the Sheriff now, Gale.
- Right?

263
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,560
- What, you re not gonna help you with this?
- I can't.

264
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:12,670
Allright then, I am going rogue. This is what
I am good at, Dewey. This is what I know how to do.

265
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,510
Your lemon squares taste like ass.

266
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,650
- They don't. They really don't.
- Thank you, Sir.

267
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,920
- Sheriff. - Yeah?
- We got a couple high school kids in here.

268
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,390
We got a couple high school kids in here.

269
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,690
Two of em, they say they got threatening phone
calls this morning from the victims' phones.

270
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:41,400
- Names are Olivia Morris and Jill Roberts.
- That's Sid's cousin. Damn.

271
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,670
- Right in here, Sheriff. - Hey, Jill.

272
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,340
- Sidney. Hi.
- Hi.

273
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,670
It's nice to see you, even under the circumstances.

274
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,940
- You ok? - Yeah.

275
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,910
- So two of you got phone calls?
- Yeah, us two. "What's your favorite scary movie?".

276
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,490
It was the killer's voice. From Stab.
From, I mean you know, from your life.

277
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,260
I am Kirby, by the way. I am their friend.

278
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,960
- And the killer didn't call you?
- No.

279
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,060
This is..this is a bad thing? Does that mean
that I am not gonna live as long as these two?

280
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:21,200
No... Maybe. Of course not. Just... just be careful.

281
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,040
- Oh my God, did you hear that? I am gonna be next!
- Dewey, I shouldn't be here. I should leave town.

282
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,310
I am afraid that's not really possible, Sidney.

283
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,180
Look, nobody thinks you re involved but
everyone's a suspect. I am sorry.

284
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,750
And there was evidence in your car connecting
the killer to you. You may be a material witness.

285
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,400
- So, you know, you ll have 24 hour police surveillance.
- That's comforting.

286
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:56,510
It's Rebecca. Oh my fucking God, Henry.
Yes! Its true. Two girls butchered. Pay day.

287
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:03,850
I was so not feeling Woodsboro. Was like lame
PR, am I right? Well, fuck me wow! Best idea ever.

288
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,850
Henry, I ll call you back.

289
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,920
Excuse me. I have to geek out.
I hadn't got a chance to say something earlier,
but it's suck an honor to meet you.

290
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,590
- Thank you. - Rebecca Walters.

291
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,060
- Hi. - When I was a kid it was all
about top story with Gale Weathers.

292
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,360
- You were my 90s!
- Well, it's Gale Riley now.

293
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,600
You gave it all for love, I know that. How
long have you and Dewey been married?

294
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,440
- Ten years.
- Oh, just like your characters in Stab 3. Wow!

295
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,770
Wow...

296
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,440
I didn't mean "bad wow", it's just, it always seemed
like more of a horror movie romance than a real one

297
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,810
because it was a movie,
and in real life it should never be.

298
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,020
Uh, dug a hole. Climbing out, here. So anyway,

299
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,860
Kudos on being brave enough to drop
off the professional map. Any plans
on revitalizing your tarnished brand

300
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,760
Listen, in about 2 seconds I am gonna revitalize
your face... with my tarnished brand.

301
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,830
I still got it.

302
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,930
Uhm, tasty.

303
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,080
She's so pretty. When you think about what
she survived. She must have scars everywhere.

304
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,780
Shhhh, Come on.

305
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,220
Her mom is my sister. I have scars too.
None ever asks me about my scars.

306
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,760
- I am sorry Mrs Roberts.
- She means nice scars, mom.

307
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh, well. Fine.

308
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:37,740
- How are you? How's Gale?
- I am alright. But Gale,

309
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:46,050
it's been hard on her. Small town.
Small town husband. Not much to write about.

310
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:55,930
- You two ok? - Well, i read somewhere once
"Just when you think things can't get any worse,

sometimes they don't... Sometimes, they get better.",
Out of Darkness by Sidney Prescott, page 220.

312
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,410
Gotta get going.

313
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:26,060
- It's nice to see you, Dewey. Been thru a lot together.
- We ll get thru this too, ok?

314
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,920
I ll go.

315
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,010
Be good. It's ok. Relax, relax. It's just me.

316
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,690
- What the hell are you doing here? There are cops
right out front. - No match for the ninja, baby.

317
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:03,730
Anyway, what are you doing in the house
of Sidney Prescott? I mean, that's like
being on Top Chef with Jeffrey Dahmer.

318
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:09,470
Can you please get away from the window?
You've no right to be in here. Not anymore.

319
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:15,070
Hang on. I heard you got a phone call from the killer.
Is that true?

320
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,080
- And you care?
- Don't you think it'd be a lot safer with me around?

321
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,480
- I don't trust you, Trevor. - Hey.
I am just gonna have to make sure that you do. Alright?

322
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,860
Oh, sorry, I didn't...
- No, he's just leaving. Its... it's my ex.

323
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,360
- Oh. - Yeah, the one and only.

324
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

325
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,700
It's cool to meet you... officially. I keep meaning to
pick up a copy of your book, but...

326
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,010
You re smaller in person.

327
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,750
- What?
- Nothing, you just, ehm, you remind me of me.

328
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,320
- Lock your window, ok?
- Yeah, goodnight.

329
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,660
Night.

330
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:18,840
- Sorry about that. Just making my
rounds before taking off. - Great, thanks.

331
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,970
- You don't remember me, do you?
- Sorry?

332
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,610
We went to High School together. Judy Hicks?

333
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:36,820
We had the same Homeroom in. Drama club too.
We were in Peter Pan together. I played a Lost Boy.

334
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:45,330
- You were... Tiger Lily.
- I am sorry, it was a long time ago.

335
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,740
It's ok, ehm. You had a lot of stuff going on back then.

336
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,410
Well, it's nice to see you again, Judy.
- You too.

337
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,520
- Everything ok upstairs?
- You re supposed to be out front, Perkins.

338
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,270
- 4 letter word for... courage?
- Uh, guts.

339
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:34,610
- It's Olivia Morris, she lives next door. She's on the list.
- She can live next door to me.

340
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:42,890
Now seriously, ehm, Mary I am warning you, ok?
I am gonna have to get physical.
I mean it. This is it! Just fuck off!

341
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,800
- Hello?
- What are you guys up to?

342
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,740
Uhm, we re watching Shaun of the Dead. - You know
there's two zombies sitting outside your house in a car?

343
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,740
- Yeah, they are cops. You wanna come up?
- Angel of Death leave?

344
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,350
- No, she's in the guest room.
- Forget it. Next door is close enough.

345
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,920
- Your mom home?
- She's at her boyfriend's. It's creepier in here tonight.

346
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,390
No, the zombies are still in their
car, so you should be alright.

347
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,390
- Call me tomorrow, ok?
- Right.

348
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,060
- She wanna come up?
- She fears the Reaper.

349
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,430
Watch this.

350
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,540
- Who's speaking?
- What's your favorite scary movie, Olivia?

351
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,420
It's the worst imitation I've ever heard, Jill. Speaking of
Stab, you heard where the Stab- a- thon's gonna be at?

352
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,890
No. It doesn't matter to me anyways,
mom doesn't let me go.

353
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,690
- It's Trevor, I'll handle this.
- Trevor is calling... again.

354
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,330
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to Jill.

355
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:05,570
Uhm, no it's Kirby. Sorry, Trevor, Jill is
screening her calls from all past relationships.

356
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,840
- What's going on over there?
- Hang on one sec. What is he saying?

357
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:14,110
- I am not Trevor.
- W-What? I can barely hear you, Trevor.

358
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,620
- This isn't Trevor.
- Oh, oh, alright. Then why do you have his phone?

359
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,720
- Whoever this is. He's trying to do Ghostface.
- He's being weird.

360
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,430
- I wanna talk to Jill.
- Ok, well, she doesn't want to talk to you.

361
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,400
Come on, Mr Ghostface, whisper to me.
Aren't you supposed to ask me a question?

362
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,870
- Alright. How's the movie?
- What movie?

363
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,570
- Shaun of the Dead.
- How did you know that?

364
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:48,680
- Because I'm standing in the closet.
- Stop, you're not.

365
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,210
- What's going on?
- Trevor is being weird.

366
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,180
- I mean, if it is him, I dunno.
- What?

367
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,990
- This is not fucking Trevor!
- Well, then who the fuck are you?

368
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:04,160
- Open the closet door.
- You do know there are cops all over this house?

369
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,030
I think that I have just enough
time to slice someone open.

370
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,700
- I'll talk to him.
- Shhhhhh.

371
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,470
- What's going on over there, you guys? -

372
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:14,700
- S-Sorry, I dunno. Kirby? -Shhhhhh.

373
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,710
S-Sorry, I-I dunno. Kirby?
- Shhhh.

374
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,140
- Kirby.
- Come on, do it.

375
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,350
- There is no way you re in there.
- See for yourself.

376
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,590
Kirby? Kirby, come on, talk to me.
This isn't funny! Kirby!

377
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:42,430
- Liar. I am over this.
- I never said I was in your closet.

378
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,940
Oh my God!

379
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,040
- Olivia! - Oh my God!

380
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,410
Help, in my house!

381
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,180
No!

382
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,260
No. No!

383
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,140
- Hoss!
- Olivia!

384
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,070
Perkins!

385
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,840
Shit.

386
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,600
- What?
- Welcome home Sidney. Preview of coming events.

387
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,540
- Why don't you come for me? You got the balls for that?
- Oh, poor Sidney. You think this is all about you?

388
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,070
- You think you're still the star.
- This isn't a fucking movie!

389
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,740
- It will be. - These are innocent people.

390
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:39,450
Spare me the lecture! You've done very
well by all this blood shed, haven't you?
How about the town you left behind?

391
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:46,020
I ve got plans for you. I am gonna slit your eyelids in
half so you don't blink when I stab you in the face.

392
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:53,260
You'll die when I want you to, Sidney. Not
a moment before. Until then, you re going to suffer.

393
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,930
- Sidney!
- Jill? Stay right there.

394
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,600
- Is she...
- Do not look, ok?

395
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,070
- She said you were the Angel of Death.
- Look out!

396
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,660
- Come look. Look over there.
- He's in here.

397
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:34,500
- Where is he?
- He was...

398
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,970
- What's your status?
- Jill?

399
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,310
- Don't.

400
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,850
What happened? Oh my God, Jill.

401
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,400
Jesus. Your hon, 'Vis. Baby, baby. Come here.
Come on, let's go, let's go. Let's get care of you, right?

402
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,300
- Jill? Oh my God. Are you ok?
- Give me a hand.

403
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,570
- Keep your pressure on it.
- There's somebody back there.

404
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,770
- Call it in.
- Right.

405
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:16,050
- Hey, are you ok?
- You should look upstairs.

406
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,430
Let's get the corners and rub around these.

407
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,900
Thought this was over!

408
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,740
It's all your fault, Sidney.

409
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,940
Just like her mother!

410
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,150
I am sorry of what I said.

411
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,550
- Shouldn't you get that looked at?
- Yeah.

412
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:02,960
- What the hell happened? - Ok, I saw him going
to that yard, two houses down, right before.

413
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,230
- A-A-And I circled around to cut him off.
- And?

414
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,700
- And I met Hoss coming from the other
direction. - No, he must have circled
back around somehow. He's like a ghost.

415
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,240
- Chief, we're sorry.
- We feel terrible.

416
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,470
Alright. Get outta here.

417
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,320
This is Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer
webcasting live in our darkest hour.

418
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,790
What began as a day of remembrance,
has ended with a serial murder.

419
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:44,270
Olivia Morris, who officially would never go out with me,
is dead. So is Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper.

420
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,240
Our local legacy, the Stab movies, is coming to life.

421
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,940
- Excuse me, are you recording with that thing?
- My video blog upload. He's webcasting right now.

422
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,180
- Mind turning it off? A little old school, off the record?
- Can't. Owe it to my audience.

423
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,820
- Turn the fucking thing off.
- Ok...

424
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,790
- So, you two are the boys who run the
movie club at Woodsboro High, huh?

425
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,790
- Oh, Charlie rents it. I'm just VP,
in case he takes a bullet. - It's called Cinema Club.

426
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:17,100
- So you must have a very unique insight
into the movie buffs at your school? - Maybe.

427
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,300
What if we could catch the killer, by working together?

428
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,510
Two generations of cutting edge journalists
intertwining our passions for media.

429
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,240
- What would you say?
- I love you?

430
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:38,190
Very good. Now, you give me your expertise
on the gore geek scene at Woodsboro High
and maybe I give you something in return

431
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:46,200
- Say, a celebrity visit to your Cinema Club... by me?
- What about Sidney?

432
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,230
- What about Sidney?
- Hey, you know her, right? I am you're friends with her?

433
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,170
No offense but, that'd be a big deal for some of the club.
A visit from Sidney Prescott, I mean, she's the star.

434
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,180
Uh, yes she's Daniel Radcliffe to my J.K. Rowling.

435
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,010
- When was the bookshelf in the box office? - Never.

436
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,760
- There's no broken bones. I think you'll be
fine. Maybe just take a couple weeks off.

437
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:22,700
So, Sidney... Uh, ouh. Anyway, long story short
, Random wants to lock you into 3 more books, now.

438
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,500
See the blank line in your contract?
You can name your phrase.

439
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,840
And as soon as you re clear in this investigation,
we re on the next plane to New York.

440
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,910
- I booked Today, The View, Nancy Grace, MTV News.
- Excuse me, can I... can I ask you a question?

441
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:40,450
- Did you read my book?
- Thought I'd wait for the movie.

442
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:51,590
- Book tour is over. - Sidney. Accept your situation.
You re a victim, for life. So, embrace it, use it.

443
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,770
I know you care about your readers.
All those little down-trodden fucks that
just need a light at the end of their

444
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:02,700
tunnels so they don't jump off a bridge.
And a lucky break like this? I am talking a
100 percent increase in sales, minimum.

445
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,740
That's maybe a million more people getting your
message and you get a ton more checks. Win-win.

446
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,450
- I won't be needing you anymore.
- Sidney!

447
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,480
- You re fired.
- Fired?

448
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,450
- Fired!
- Fine.

449
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,980
"What do you think about my book, Rebecca?"

450
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,290
The problem of Sidney is she never gets laid.
Or even a little shit faced once in a while.

451
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,970
She'll call me at 9 to apologize. Just watch.

452
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:16,380
She'll come around. Gotta just give her
time. Sidney will come.... around.

453
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,690
- This is Rebecca.
- Sidney Prescott, please.

454
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,360
I am handling Ms Prescott's calls and appearances.
May I take a message?

455
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:43,310
You are the message. Are you writing this down?
- Yes, I am.

456
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:47,980
But, it's kinda hard to hear you. I'm in a hospital,
with Sidney. If you can just hang on one second.

457
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,810
I've got time. It's you that doesn't.

458
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,690
You know, Rebecca, it doesn't
sound to me like you re in the hospital.

459
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,630
Sounds like you re in a parking garage.
A dark and deserted parking garage.

460
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,040
But if you wanna be in the hospital, I'd be
happy to put you there. In the morgue!

461
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,490
Help! Help! Save me!

462
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,240
Cut and run, you fucking bastard.

463
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:34,410
This is an ongoing investigation.
But rest assured, we re pursuing a number of leads.

464
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,650
- Sheriff
- The less I say about that, the better.

465
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,380
So, I'm taking questions.

466
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,180
- Dewey!
- Gale?

467
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:47,690
Any comment on the fact that these
killings seem to resemble the pattern
of the original Woodsboro murders?

468
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,760
Hun? Later!

469
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,730
What was that, Sheriff?

470
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,760
As I was saying... my officers are hard at work.

471
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,140
We just want the community to know that we re very
close to bringing this whole situation under control.

472
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:12,050
Hey, someone! Get up to the top
of the structure! Go! Go!

473
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,850
- Everyone back! Stay back!
- Back, nobody move!

474
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:16,890
Jenkins, I want a man on this stairwell.

475
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,690
- You see anybody?
- Nobody out there.

476
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,660
There's nobody out there, Sheriff!

477
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:29,630
- It's all under control huh, Sheriff?
- But what am I supposed to say?

478
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:33,940
Listen, I may not be wearing a uniform,
but I happen to have a lead and you don't.

479
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,810
So let me know when you re back on Team Gale.

480
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,210
Move back, I am the Sheriff.

481
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:56,630
Ok, Cinema Club, we re not in session.
Welcome. I'll tell you a little bit about ourselves.

482
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:03,330
We re a sanctioned after school activity, one
rung below the Glee club, two above Nintendo Wii Fit

483
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:08,700
and let me just say to our guest
, Sidney Prescott, it's an honor.

484
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,010
Beyond Jamie Lee Curtis, forget Linda Blair,
I mean, this is the ultimate.

485
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,020
Thanks, I-I guess. This, uhm... you film your entire
High School experience and what, post it on the net?

486
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,890
- Everybody will be doing it someday, Sid.
- It's kind of the one component the killer is missing.

487
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:33,600
- Wait, what do you mean?
- Well, if you wanna be the new "new version",
the killer should be filming the murders.

488
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,770
That's like the natural next step in the psycho
slasher innovation. I mean you film em all real time

489
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:42,140
- and then before you get caught, you upload em into
cyberspace. - Making your art as immortal as you.

490
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,570
- Not to implicate him...
- Not to implicate me...

491
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:50,380
- So who do you think is behind the murders?
- Well, it's a Stab fanatic, clearly.

492
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,250
Working on less of a Screquel and more of a Screamake.
- Copyrighted terms, by the way.

493
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,750
Cos all there are now are remakes.
Only horror the studios green-light.

494
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:02,520
I mean, there are still rules, but the rules have changed.
The unexpected is the new cliché.

495
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,260
Yeah, you gotta have an opening sequence
that blows the doors off

496
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,200
done with some flashy music video direction.
And the kills gotta be way more extreme.

497
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,970
Modern audiences got savvy to the rules of the originals,
so the reversals become the new standard.

498
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:19,210
In fact, the only surefire way to survive a modern
horror movie, you pretty much have to be gay.

499
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:28,180
So, why are you so sure that the killer is
working by the rules of a horror remake? - Well,
the original Stab structure is pretty apparent.

500
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:33,020
- Two kids killed in a house while their
parents are away. - And then the school's
"hot chick" savaged beyond recognition.

501
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,420
- We all know where it goes from there...
- A party.

502
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:42,630
- Exactly. A party. Guaranteed third act main cast blood
bath. - Fingers crossed on some nudity for a change.

503
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,500
- Ok, do you know of a party that's happening tonight?
- Well, there's Stab- a- thon.

504
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:56,310
- Stab- a- thon? - Uh, It's a movie marathon.
All 7 Stabs back to back. We do it every year.

505
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:03,120
- Is tonight? There's a killer out there
patterning his murders after the
original movie. - I know, it's pretty wild.

506
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,390
We have to call it off.

507
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,490
- Uhm, ok, I mean, it's Friday. I am sure we re not
the only party that's going on at Woodsboro.

508
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,760
- But where is this circle-jerk gonna take place?
- So, let's ready for this Q&A.

509
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,470
- No, no. I really want the location. - You know, it's kind
of an underground thing. Email invites. Pretty secret.

510
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,370
What, you re not gonna tell me? Really?
We re working together. Remember?

511
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,710
- So you re ready for the Q&A?
- Fuck you. Let's go.

512
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,020
That was awesome.

513
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,290
- Nobody comes to the house unless we say so.
- Got it.

514
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,290
I feel like I'm under house arrest.

515
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:03,380
You know when people say "I know how
you feel", but you know they re just
saying that because they really have no

516
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:09,450
freaking idea how you feel? I know how you feel.

517
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,620
I am so sorry about Olivia.

518
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,130
I am sorry about your publicist.

519
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:33,610
How do you handle it, people staring at you all the time?
- People stare at me?

520
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:40,580
I could never handle that kind of attention.
I just feel like it would take over your whole life.

521
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:56,130
Uh, all I do is I... try not to think about me.
I have people I care about. I focus on them.

522
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,970
And the rest, uhm, it works out.

523
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:08,910
You saved my life last night. I mean, I know
we re family but... you heard a thing on me.

524
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:15,020
Makes me wonder, you know,
if I'd be brave enough to do the same thing.

525
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:19,420
I really hope you never have to find that out.

526
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,590
Oh, if you need me, you know where to find me.

527
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,030
I'll be up in my cell, oh, I mean, my room.

528
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:57,990
Our rooms are boarded up. That's the
view from my cell. It's really weird.

529
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,860
I think Olivia would understand, ok?
She'd want me to be around other people.

530
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,900
Holy shit. Even if I did just crash land on planet dork.

531
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,270
Speaking of which, Trevor's here.
- Hey, Kirby.

532
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:15,840
- What is he doing there? That is so not his scene.
- I have no idea, maybe he thought you would be here.

533
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:20,750
Yeah, fat chance. After what happened last night?
I mean, my mum is just completely freaked out.

534
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:25,220
- It's not prim. - Alright, you go do your good
girl thing and I'll drink for the both of us.

535
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,490
- I will keep you posted.
- Alright, be safe.

536
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,870
Stab-a-thon!
Stab-a-thon!

537
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:19,710
- Thank you! Thank you. Gracias. Gracias.
- Shhhh.

538
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,950
Cinema Club thanks you for coming
up for our third annual Stab-a-thon.

539
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,050
Thank you, number-3-thon. We thank you in rows.

540
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,750
- Are you ready to drink every time someone
can't get a cellphone signal? - Yeah!

541
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:35,690
- Are you ready to drink every time someone
shuts the refrigerator door and, oh my God,
there's the harmless character right behind it?

542
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,090
Yeah!

543
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,930
- Are you ready to drink every time
somebody screams the word.... - No!

544
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,900
Let's get the Stab-athon started!

545
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,650
Ghostface!

546
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:02,920
Get out in 5!

547
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,220
Move your ass!

548
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:06,790
Screw you!

549
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,520
Yes!

550
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,300
Uh, Yeah. Back on my game.

551
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:56,240
Perfect. New work in progress, chapter 1.

552
00:54:56,570 --> 00:55:03,010
When I moved to Woodsboro, I never in a million
years dreamed that I would again play the critical role...

553
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,480
...in solving another series of these...

554
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:14,890
What the hell?

555
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,950
- Gale, where are you?
- I followed the kids to the Stab-a-thon.

556
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:47,690
There's an old abandoned farm on 4th Dylan Road.
Listen, I-I got it under surveillance,
but I think the killer is about to make his move.

557
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:53,900
- What makes you so sure? - You do a remake
to outdo the original, that's what the kids said.

558
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,100
This party is all about the Stab movies.
Come on, how meta can you get?

559
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:02,040
- How "what the.." can you get?
- I dunno, I heard em say it.

560
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,540
- Dewey, listen to me, you have to get out here. Come
on, you catch the killer, I get the story. It's a win-win.

561
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:13,180
- Well, I thought you were going rogue, Gale.
- Oh come..are you serious? C'mon!

562
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:19,920
- Forget it. Thanks for having faith in me!
I gotta fix my equipment. - Gale!

563
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,590
Shit.

564
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:44,780
Bravo, well... very well done, very, I'm very impressed.
Kind of. Kinda impressed. Not Really.

565
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,880
- That'll do. - Yeah? - Yeah.

566
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,150
- Yeah, she wants you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

567
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,320
Nooooooo!

568
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,460
Ghostface.....

569
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,440
- Hello?
- Hello.

570
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,270
- Who is this?
- Were you expecting somebody now?

571
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,650
You know, I don't even know you...
- ...and I dislike you already.

572
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,660
- Hicks, how far are you from 4th Dylan Road?
- 5 minutes at the most, Sir.

573
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,390
Well, step on it.

574
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:31,890
Look out your window.

575
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,740
Gale! Gale, behind you!

576
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:30,080
No!

577
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,720
Gale!

578
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,440
Freeze!

579
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,190
Get out of the way, you morons!

580
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:11,360
Dammit.

581
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,800
- Ok, put pressure on that.
- Did you catch him?

582
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,840
- No, hopefully your cameras got something.
- They weren't the only ones, Dewey.

583
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,970
- What?
- There's a webcam... set back there.

584
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,680
- He was watching me.
- A webcam?

585
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:31,580
- He's recording the murders.
- What?

586
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,320
This time... he's making the movie.

587
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,760
This Sidney Prescott detail man, I don't like it.

588
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,490
The cops scouting the house, they always get it.

589
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,230
What are you talking about?
- It's a movie cop rule.

590
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:56,040
Sucks to be a cop in a movie. Unless you re Bruce Willis.
- Not all cops die in movies.

591
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,040
No, but if it's your last day before retirement you do.

592
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,480
If you re a rookie, some with a wife
who's pregnant, you do.

593
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:08,880
Or if your partner is better looking than you,
you do, and by the way, I win that one.

594
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,690
You know what, I'll take the next perimeter.
I'll be right back.

595
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,720
Shit.

596
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,600
- I know this one, you re not supposed to say that,
are you? - Eh, new decade, new rules.

597
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:27,470
You know, these days, you might come back,
find me dead. Eyes gouged out,
tongue sticking out. Could go either way.

598
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:31,040
- I gotta learn this shit.
- Eh, I'll take this one.

599
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:38,350
- Hey, Hoss. Be careful.
- I am always careful.

600
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,720
Dead man walking.

601
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:39,040
- Perkins, was there a window open on your
last perimeter check? Perkins, come in. Over.

602
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,270
Anthony?

603
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:11,970
Perkins?

604
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:21,120
- Dammit.
- You should have seen the look on your face, rookie.

605
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:25,290
Hoss! What the fuck!

606
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,320
Holy shit...

607
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,400
Hoss!

608
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:56,850
Fuck Bruce Willis!

609
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:30,080
- Sorry. The wind chimes were over here.
- It was me, I was trying to fix em, sorry.

610
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,820
- I am just back the store.
- Were you shopping?

611
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,090
A stress buster. I got one more bag
in the car. I'll be right back.

612
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,690
Jill, you re gonna get that?

613
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,060
- Roberts residence.
- You re a survivor, aren't you, Sidney?

614
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:18,230
Your one and only skill: You survive.
Well, I have one question for you.

615
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:23,200
What good did to be a survivor in this little
drama if everyone close to you is dead?

616
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,570
- Who are you?
- Turn on the TV to channel 6.

617
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:29,880
- Who the fuck are you?
- Turn it on. Watch the teaser.

618
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:37,450
...But it nearly turned deadly tonight,
with the latest victim of this attack being
the wife of the Woodsboro Sheriff...

619
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:44,360
...Gale Riley, AKA Gale Weathers, who's
in serious condition tonight after being
stabbed. Her assailant then disappeared...

620
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:49,230
in a sea of identic....
- Glad you came home, Sidney. Has it been worth it yet?

621
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:56,000
- Why are you doing this? - Ah, friends count,
but it's the family ties that cut deep. Am I right?

622
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:02,040
- What do you mean? - The ones you care about most.
And what's closer than family?

623
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,810
- The bond of blood.
- Don't.

624
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,050
You can't save them. All you can do is watch.

625
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:10,180
Jill!

626
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,900
- Kate!
- Sid?

627
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,840
- She's not in her room.
- Oh my God.

628
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,940
She's gone at Kirby's. You gotta call her,
get her back here. - Ok.

629
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,050
- Come on, Jill!
- Leave a message.

630
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:44,050
- She's not picking up. What's going on?
- The killer called, he's coming after me.
But he wants my family first.

631
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,690
- Oh God, Jill...
- Let's get the cops.

632
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,450
- The cops aren't there.
- What?

633
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:50,790
They were there when I first came in,
but they re not there now. - Let's get to Kirby's.

634
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,900
Out the front.

635
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,440
Press up on the bottom. Can you?

636
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,410
Let's get out of here.

637
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:17,280
Kate, come on! Kate!

638
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:32,900
- Tell Jill I am so sorry...
- No, no, no, no, shhhh...

639
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,650
Kate...

640
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:04,500
- Hicks. What are you doing? - I just saw
somebody coming around the side of the house.

641
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,430
Where are Hoss and Perkins?
I couldn't get em on the radio.

642
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:13,070
- Whose blood is that?
- Is... Is Kate's, we were just attacked. She's dead.

643
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,240
- Where is she?
- The front door.

644
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:16,940
- Show me.
- Ok.

645
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:22,620
- Stay here.
- Ok.

646
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:33,890
This is Deputy Hicks. I've got a homicide at the
Roberts residence. No sign of Perkins or Hoss.

647
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:36,730
- Copy that. We'll try to locate em.
- I'm so sorry.

648
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:54,210
You're gonna be fine, alright? I swear.
No more on your own. It's you and me, forever.

649
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,380
Easy.

650
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,420
- Dewey.
- Yeah?

651
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,890
Promise me something.
- Anything.

652
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:11,230
- Catch that motherfucker.
- Absolutely. I love you.

653
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:12,100
I love you.

654
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,740
- It was chaos. Utter chaos.
- I can't believe that.

655
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:22,980
The Sheriff's wife, man. She told us to cancel it and
we didn't and now this? What are we supposed to do?

656
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,880
Robbie, calm down. It makes sense.

657
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,850
- This is about the reboots too.
They-they-they one up the original ending.

658
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:33,750
- "The Woodsboro murders" ended at a party, so in the
remake... - ...The party is the false ending. New rules.

659
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,860
- Exactly.
- Ok, no offense guys but I'm gonna put in Stab 7.

660
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,560
- Yes...
- Nobody cancels my film festival.

661
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:45,270
Wohaa, I don't wanna watch that. Not after what
happened to Olivia. - Oh, come on. It was her favorite.

662
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:48,740
Oh, wow Kirby. You have some classics here.
- Yep.

663
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:54,340
"Suspiria","Don't look now"... - You know it.
I can trivia your ass under the table, cinema boy.

664
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:58,410
Oh, yeah? Who played Leatherface first?
- Gunnar Hansen.

665
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:01,180
Wow, did you feel that?

666
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:07,220
- The charge that moved between us, then?
- Oh, that was me. I have powers.

667
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,760
So sexy...

668
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:14,800
You guys are unbelievable. You re playing
fucking trivia games? The cops are gonna come
for us, they are gonna shut down my website.

669
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,060
- We re so dead!
- Yeah. I agree.

670
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:22,140
- Jesus Christ, where did you come from?
- The front door. By the way Kirby,
with everything that's going on right now...

671
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:26,140
...you probably shouldn't leave that unlocked.
- Sorry...

672
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:32,210
- And... May I ask what the hell are you doing here?
- Why, didn't I find the after-party?

673
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:38,290
- No, you found the Anti-party and it's invitation only.
- Yeah, well, I got an invitation. From Jill.

674
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:44,260
So, what's the story?
- What?

675
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:50,130
- You sent me a text message.After-party at
Kirby's house. I mean, it was from your phone.

676
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:57,640
What do you mean, from my phone? Oh, where is
my phone? I think I left it in your car, I didn't text him.

677
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:01,780
I didn't text you. And I'll prove it!

678
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:08,580
So, Charlie, Robbie, how does it feel
to be accessories to a crime, huh?

679
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:12,420
- I mean, really? Dewey's wife?
- My life is over.

680
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,260
So which one of you guys sent me a text
message from Jill's phone, huh?

681
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:22,660
- W-We re just supposed to accept that you re
telling the truth? - Isn't your phone missing?

682
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:27,830
- Got a new one.
- Really? Oh, that's incredibly convenient.

683
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,410
Dewey, it's Hicks.
- What's up?

684
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,010
- Kate Roberts is dead.
- Huh?

685
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:37,980
- And Sidney fled the scene.
- What, what happened to Kate?

686
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,010
- She was stabbed, just like the others.
- And what about Jill?

687
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:44,820
- No sign of her at all
- Where the hell were Hoss and Perkins?

688
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:50,520
They were found dead in their car two blocks away.
Multiple stab wounds.

689
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:55,960
Ok. I'm on my way.
- Yes, Sir.

690
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,110
- Wrong number.
- Who was that?

691
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,510
- Oh, nobody.
- Did you pick a movie?

692
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:13,980
- Yeah, we re gonna go scary: Saw IV.
- Oh, I saw that in theaters. It sucks.

693
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,250
It's not scary, it's gross. I hate all that torture porn shit.

694
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,120
Why, angry feel.

695
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:25,690
- Well, I like Jigsaw. I think he kills people very
creatively. - But she don't give a shit who dies...

696
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:29,660
...cos there's no character to fill a man.
It's just body parts whipping and blood spewing...

697
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,380
Charlie, you wanna sit next to me?

698
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:59,160
Alright... Get ready for a Hall Pass with
Robbie Mercer extra. Now tonight, there
is a good chance that Charlie Walker,

699
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:10,570
yes, my Charlie Walker, may get lucky with
a girl. Now I'm unable to , to publish my
exact location, however, suffice it to say...

700
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:16,380
Woodsboro High may be in store for some geek history.
We'll see.

701
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:30,990
Hello?

702
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:35,330
Who's there?

703
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,300
Oh my God.

704
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,390
- Where are you going?
- To make sure the front door is locked.

705
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,560
- No, don't open it.
- You're overreacting.

706
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,260
Hey, Charlie.
- Yeah?

707
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:15,600
I'm sorry, I know you re into the movie and all , but...
now would be a really good time to make a move.

708
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,370
- For me to make a move?
- Mhh mhh.

709
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:25,680
- Couldn't you make a move?
- I just did.

710
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:35,260
Cos you re actually pretty cute. Especially
when I'm scared... and lonely... and drunk.

711
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:45,770
Ehi, guys. Did... did you see Jill, coming?
I didn't see her outside. - Yes, Trevor. She is upstairs.

712
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:49,140
Thank God you re here to protect
her when you can't even find her.

713
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:56,310
- There's nobody out here. - Oh, dude.
I love this part of the movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
01:13:56,310 --> 01:14:00,580
- What is it say? - Just when you think
they're all safe and comfortable in the house

715
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:03,280
Ghostface comes in and bang!

716
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:15,230
- Did I interrupt something for you? Shut the fuck up.
- Who invited you, Trevor?

717
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:19,600
Alright. Clearly not you. Wow.

718
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:24,770
- I'm moving upstairs.
- Get out of my house!

719
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:33,150
Ehi, ok, I'm a little drunk so,
don't blame your Internet connection.

720
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:39,620
Let's see what Charlie is up to, shall we?
Or the saga of Trevor and Jill...

721
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:43,890
Oh, intrigue of Woodsboro High.
Who needs to kill around with so much drama?

722
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,310
Oh, man...

723
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:03,780
Yeah... That's better.

724
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,230
Wait, no! You can't, you can't, there's rules.

725
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:24,560
I-I-I'm gay, I'm gay. I mean, if it helps...

726
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,510
...some random girl who gets a call that
undoubtedly ends up getting her killed.

727
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:38,040
It's all so predictable. There's no
element of surprise. You can see ev...

728
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:59,070
Kirby! So, my phone was up in your room. There was
no text message sent to Trevor. He is such a liar.

729
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:03,870
- Where is he? - What do you mean, where is he,
he just went upstairs looking for you.

730
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:13,250
- He's not upstairs.
- Trevor! Charlie! Robbie!

731
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:15,650
Maybe they are outside.

732
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:21,760
Jill...................................... No, it's ok,
just I need you to come with me. Sidney! I am sorry,
I should have told you and mom where I was going.

733
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,160
Come with me right now, ok?
Run.

734
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,160
Robbie!

735
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,330
Go!

736
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:35,540
Sidney!

737
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,670
Come on!

738
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,380
- The balcony!
- There's no other way out?

739
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:51,150
- We can jump?
- It's two stories. Where's your cell? Get under the bed.

740
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:54,350
- What? - Just do what I say. Get under
the bed and don't make a sound and
don't come out till I come get you.

741
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:56,090
- Just go. Trust me!
- Ok.

742
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,070
You got it? You ok? Jill, run. Just keep running. Get out!

743
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:33,490
- Hello?
- Dewey!

744
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:37,330
- Sidney, where are you?
- I'm at Kirby's. The killer is here, I need your help.

745
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:38,870
- I'm on my way.
- Ok.

746
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,140
Sid! Sidney!

747
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,240
- I need all units to 329 Whispering Lane.
- All units! 329 Whispering Lane!

748
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,630
Sorry, it's just me. Look, I tried to call 911 with the
land line instead, but someone smashed the router.

749
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,670
I think I called them myself
- Well, where's Jill?

750
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,970
Go, go, go, go!

751
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,180
- There's a room down there. We can lock ourselves in.

752
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:27,710
- I heard you yelling to Jill. Did she get away?
- I think she's safe.

753
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:37,890
- Kirby, let me in!
- Charlie...

754
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:44,530
No, no, no, no, no, don't. I just found Robbie.
It's... It's just his blood, please.

755
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,800
- Please, there is someone else out here. Let me in.
- If you can't trust him, don't open the door.

756
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,740
- My God! Let me in!
- Get away from the door, Charlie.

757
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:57,910
- Kirby, it's me! Please let me in!
- Get away from the door, Charlie!

758
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:02,850
- It's me!
- I'm sorry, I can't...

759
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,820
What the fuck...
- I am sorry.

760
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,950
Behind you! Look out!

761
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:12,690
No, no, no, no, no!

762
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:15,500
Kirby!

763
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:28,610
Oh, no, God, no. He's... Leave him alone!

764
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:30,880
Leave him alone!

765
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:41,920
- It's Charlie's phone. - Tell Sidney heads are gonna
roll tonight. Tell Sidney it's all because of her.

766
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:47,430
- Or maybe she wants into his place.
I promise to be quick. - It's him.

767
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:51,630
Ok, I'm gonna get Jill, she should be in the same place.
Just-just keep him on the phone, I'll be right back ok?

768
01:19:54,730 --> 01:20:00,670
- Let him go, please... - I hear you like horror
movies, Kirby. But do you like em so much as him?

769
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:07,480
- Forget watching Stab. You get to live it.
- No, no, no, no, no. He's the expert, it's not me.

770
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:11,850
- Warm up question: Jason's weapon?
- Uh, it's a machete.

771
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:17,760
- There, you see? You do know the genre.
Michael Mayers? - Uh, butcher knife.

772
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,430
- Leatherface?
- A chainsaw. Please...

773
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:24,260
- Just ask Sidney if you need some help.
Freddy Krueger? - Uh, uh, razor hands.

774
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:29,770
- Name the movie that started the slasher craze:
"Halloween", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre",
"The Last House on the Left" or "Psycho"?

775
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:34,570
- "Psycho". - None of the above. "Peeping Tom".
1960, directed by Michael Powell.

776
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:40,050
- First movie to ever put the audience in the killer's POV.
- Wait, wait. No, no, no, no.

777
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:47,790
- Please, just ask me one more question,
just one more. - Alright, Kirby.
Then it's time for your last chance question.

778
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:52,430
- Name the remake of the groundbreaking
horror movie in which the villain...

779
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:59,070
"Halloween", "Texas Chainsaw",
"Dawn of the Dead", "The Hills Have Eyes",
"The Amityville Horror", "The Last House on the Left"

780
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:04,700
"Friday the 13th", "A Nightmare on
Elm Street", "My Bloody Valentine",
"When a Stranger Calls", "Prom Night"

781
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:11,910
"Black Christmas", "House of Wax", "The Fog", uh,
"Piranha". It's one of those, right? Right?!

782
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:22,660
I got it right. I was fucking right!

783
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,660
Jill?

784
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:41,810
- I won, Charlie. I fucking won. I won.
He tried to beat me, but I fucking won. - It's so great...

785
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:53,090
- Wait, I'm almost there. Just hang tight.
- Kirby? This is making a move.

786
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:02,560
- 4 years of classes together and you notice me now?
You stupid bitch! It's too late!

787
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:09,170
- Shh, shhhh, I know, I know. It's ok, take your time.

788
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:13,870
- Doesn't happen as fast as it does
in the movies, honey. - Charlie...

789
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:40,670
Kirby?

790
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,570
You know, you learn the law when you
watch the movies over and over.

791
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,840
All the plots are about trying to kill you.

792
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:56,020
- Where's Jill? - Oh, you think she's gonna get away?
You think anyone gets away?

793
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:10,030
- Jill?
- Hello, Sidney. Surprised?

794
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:18,070
Watch this. This is the part when,
dear cousin, the cameras... turn off.

795
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:24,240
- Charlie?
- Want her taken care of.

796
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,680
Then I got great footage in my Robbie kill.
Better than Jenny and Marnie or Olivia even.

797
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,590
Good. We'll cut and upload it later.
Make it all traceable to Trevor.

798
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:38,420
Speaking of which... Remind you of anything?

799
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,160
- Jill, please...
- Shut up! Dick.

800
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:45,700
- Everything I learned, I learned from you.
- You think you had a shitty boyfriend, Sidney?

801
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:54,110
Here's one that fucks you, dumps you and doesn't even
make you famous. - What the fuck, Jill, I loved you!

802
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:56,280
- Shut the fuck up, already!

803
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,810
Sure those cops wanted you to have this, Jill.
For your protection.

804
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:03,620
Put it dow...

805
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:12,630
- Ehi, please. - Shouldn't have killed all those
people; Trev. Gone and put it on video even.

806
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:17,300
- But it means a lot that you did it for me.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

807
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:20,200
I am NOT the girl you cheat on.

808
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:30,110
- I've gone thru everything. We're definitely
good on timeline. - Oh, yeah. We're perfect.

809
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:31,680
No, no, no. Please.

810
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:40,120
Ready for act 3?

811
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:47,130
- Have figured it out yet, Sidney? Keeping it to our
remake theme, Trevor is this generation's Billy Loomis

812
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:50,360
and we're the innocent victims: Sidney and Randy.

813
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:56,840
See, with you, the world just heard about
what happened but with us, they're gonna see it.

814
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:02,710
It's gonna be a worldwide sensation. And people gotta
see this shit. It's not like anyone reads anymore.

815
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:09,680
I gonna know fame like you never even dreamed of.

816
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:22,930
Last two teenagers standing. This time Randy gets
the girl. You're amazing. And you're the perfect victim.

817
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:33,240
I was so believable today, wasn't I? I mean,
I told so many lies, I actually started to believe them.
I really think that I was born for this.

818
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:39,710
- How could you do this? - Do you know
what it was like growing up in this family?

819
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:47,690
Related to you? I mean, all I ever heard was:
Sidney this and Sidney that, and Sidney, Sidney, Sidney.

820
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:55,430
- You were always so fucking special! Well, now I
am the special one. - You'll slip, they always do.

821
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:11,110
- Come on, Charlie. Let's go on with this. You have to
be strong and hold still. Ok? - Yeah, yeah, old school,
like Billy and Stu. Come on, baby, get it up. Come on.

822
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:14,580
Shoulder me, shoulder me, shoulder me. Get it up!

823
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,320
Not the way we rehearsed it.

824
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,530
You said it, Charlie: Billy and Stu. Trevor and you.

825
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:38,240
What the media really loves, baby, is a sole
survivor. Just ask you know who. Trevor was
your partner and you, you were the idea man.

826
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:57,560
- Even your friends? - My friends? What world are
you living in? I don't need friends. I need fans.

827
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:05,670
Don't you get it?! This has never been
about killing you. It's about... becoming you.

828
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:11,870
I mean, for fuck's sake, my own mother had to die,
no great loss there, so I could stay true to the original.

829
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:20,580
It's sick, right? Well sick is the new sane.
You had your 15 minutes, no I want mine!

830
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:30,920
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Go to college, grad school, work? Look around,
we all live in public now, we re all on the Internet.

831
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:40,570
How do you think people become famous anymore?
You don't have to achieve anything.
You just gotta have fucked up shit happen to you.

832
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:50,280
So, you do have to die Sid. Those are the
rules. New movie, new franchise. There's
only room for one lead and, let's face it,

833
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,980
your ingenue days, they are over.

834
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:01,290
Don't tell me you didn't know this day would come.

835
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,270
Oh, fuck!

836
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:38,910
Come on! Let's move in!

837
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:51,260
- Check the rooms, both sides and upstairs.
- Yes Ma'm.

838
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:26,190
Jill can you give us a description... Over
here... Jill... Jill, how does it feel to be a hero?...

839
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:43,580
- Jill. You made it. That's all that matters.
- True, Charlie and Trev tried to kill me.

840
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:52,020
And I heard they killed my mom. And Robbie
and Kirby too. - Shhh. Just lay back. Try to rest.

841
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:58,320
- Is-is your wife...
- She's gonna be fine. She's tough.

842
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:09,200
If I ever write a book one day I'd, I'd want
her to write it with me. It'd be a good
team with our matching wounds and all.

843
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:23,250
We're survivors now. I just wish Sidney was too.
- Jill, they re not sure yet. It's still touch and go.

844
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:28,620
But she's in ICU (intensive care unit) and
they think Sidney just might make it.

845
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:38,330
What? I mean, I saw Trevor kill her.
- Look, we don't know yet. But she's hanging on.

846
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:50,110
I-I-I wanna se her. - She's not awake yet.
And, she may not remember anything.
You'll have to help her with that.

847
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:54,510
All in time. Just get some rest now, ok?

848
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:46,430
- She gonna be ok?
- Yeah, she's a strong kid.

849
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:54,870
- She's gonna have to be. - She asked if you were ok.
She thinks you guys should write a book together.

850
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:58,510
- With your matching wounds.
- Why, she was stabbed in the shoulder?

851
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:10,190
- How did she know I was too?
- Shit!

852
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:25,640
You just won't die, will ya? Who are you,
Michael fucking Mayers? Yeah, I don't think so.

853
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,380
Fucking die already!

854
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:56,570
How are those stitches?

855
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:02,440
Sidney!

856
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,250
- Hicks, get to the Sidney Prescott's room
and call for backup! - Be right up, Sir.

857
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:21,760
- Sid? Sid.
- Dewey!

858
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:46,090
Is this how it's gonna be, Sid? The ending
of the movie was supposed to be at
the house. I mean, this is just... silly.

859
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:51,590
Consider this an alternate ending.
You're not gonna get out of this, Jill.

860
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:52,960
- Of course I will.
- Dewey?

861
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:55,530
Sid...

862
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:03,000
- Easy..Wait, wait. What about the book?
- Looks like I'll just have to write it myself.

863
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:06,140
Goddammit!

864
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:11,240
Don't even think about shooting
or I'll blow Dewey's head off.

865
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:16,010
- What, you think I won't do it? Give me your gun!
- Do it.

866
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:30,000
You just had to be the hero, huh? Give me your gun.

867
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:36,870
What are you, deaf? Give me... your gun.

868
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:50,750
- And get up. And keep your hands over your head.
- Don't do anything stupi...

869
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:54,520
Don't fucking tell me what to do.

870
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:58,290
- Oh, God...
- Now, get up bitch.

871
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:03,330
- Ok.
- Get up. Now!

872
01:37:03,330 --> 01:37:17,840
- Ok...
- Come on. Let's go. Get your skinny ass out here.

873
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:24,350
- Ok...
- I'm gonna enjoy blowing your head off.

874
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:32,990
Ok, but can I just have one final word?
- What? Please?

875
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,260
- No...

876
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:41,100
- Clear.
- Clear?

877
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:42,170
Clear!

878
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:51,540
You forgot the first rule of remakes, Jill:
Don't fuck with the original.

879
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,720
- Oh my God, Dewey.
- Uh, what hit me?

880
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:04,760
Don't ask. You ok?

881
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:13,030
- She was standing right behind?
- They always are.

882
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:28,810
- Oh, God...
- Nice one.

883
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:36,590
- Hicks, you're alive?
- Wear the vest, save your chest.

884
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:44,930
I got two officers down,
several injuries and a new suspect.

885
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:49,200
We need a doctor, Goddammit!

886
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:52,270
I dunno about you, but I feel a whole lot better.

887
01:38:56,040 --> 01:39:02,080
We're live at Woodsboro Community Hospital, awaiting
a first public statement from Jill Roberts, survivor.

888
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:06,420
...a survivor of what is now being called
"the Woodsboro Massacre reboot"...

889
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:09,860
...Jill Roberts is her name.
A name the whole world will now know...

890
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:14,830
...who single-handedly put a stop to this
21st century Woodsboro killing spree...

891
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:23,000
...Jill Roberts of Woodsboro,
a girl who's lifted all our spirits tonight.
An American hero, right out of the movies.
