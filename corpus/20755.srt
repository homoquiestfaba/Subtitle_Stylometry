1
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:26,043
-Good sleep?
-Not bad.

2
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:27,567
So where are we?

3
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:28,802
Where you from?

4
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:31,044
San Diego.
Left yesterday.

5
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,966
So you came Honolulu-Guam-Pago-here?

6
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,282
Long trip.

7
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:37,883
What do you do?

8
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,931
l'm a psychologist.

9
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:41,891
Hey, a shrink.

10
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,125
They've called in everything else.

11
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:45,283
How do you mean?

12
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,922
We've ferried people out of Guam
for the last 2 days.

13
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:50,767
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians,
you name it.

14
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:54,130
Everybody being flown to the middle
of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.

15
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:55,328
What's going on?

16
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:59,407
They're not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?

17
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:00,927
There was a plane crash.

18
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:02,765
Do you get called in on crashes?

19
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:07,052
l'm on a list of psychologists the FAA
brings in when a plane goes down.

20
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:09,724
So where exactly are we now?

21
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,850
That's where we're headed.
Over there.

22
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:13,128
Here.

23
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:14,362
Take a look.

24
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:17,041
What is that?

25
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,652
All that for a plane crash?

26
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,043
l never mentioned a plane crash.

27
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:42,931
-Any other gear? Watch your step.
-l'd like to call my family.

28
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:46,085
We'll get you settled in quarters first.
Remain there till we send for you.

29
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,528
-l'd like to get started.
-We'll send for you.

30
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:50,092
-lt's critical l see them--
-Who?

31
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,642
The survivors. lf l don't get to them
in the first 24 hours--

32
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,804
-What survivors?
-The survivors of the plane crash.

33
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,368
Plane crash?

34
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:59,685
l deal in post-traumatic stress
and survival guilt.

35
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,128
Maybe l should talk to someone
who knows what's going on here.

36
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:04,170
-Talk to the ship's psychiatrist.
-l'm a psychologist.

37
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:05,641
That's why l was sent here.

38
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:07,485
l told you people l need a phone.

39
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:08,967
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.

40
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:11,727
That's fine.
Give me a phone, l'll call him.

41
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:12,849
Why are you here?

42
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,653
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who l am?

43
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:17,406
Tell him the name
of the book you wrote.

44
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:20,406
Astrophysics You Can Use. lt was a
Book-of-the-Month Club Main Selection.

45
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,245
Never heard of it.

46
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:26,372
You really thought he read your book.
You haven't changed.

47
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:27,927
lt was written for the layman.

48
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:29,162
He's not impressed.

49
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,766
ls there a phone in here?

50
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:34,847
-l've been trying to call my wife.
-Would you stop touching me?

51
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:36,082
Wait a minute.

52
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:37,842
Beth?

53
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,851
Flight quarters.
All units make your flight quarters...

54
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:48,006
...condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail--

55
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:51,691
Goodman, you been here long?

56
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,446
-l've been here 3 hours.
-Welcome aboard.

57
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,604
This thing scares the hell out of me.

58
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,811
lt's already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back. . .

59
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:02,090
. . .because the damage is done
to the survivors already.

60
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,893
-Hold on. We'll get to that.
-l don't even know who you are.

61
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,088
l know who you are.

62
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,006
Who are you? Navy? Military?
What are you?

63
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,891
You ever hear of the OSSA?

64
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,647
They don't know who l am.
That should reassure you.

65
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:16,168
You haven't talked to anyone about this?

66
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:18,927
-l talked to the helicopter pilot.
-What'd you tell him?

67
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:22,563
l told him l was here to see
the plane crash. That's my job.

68
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,849
Plane crash. Good.

69
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:27,765
There was no plane crash.

70
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:29,886
Spacecraft.

71
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:32,807
A spacecraft.
l guess that explains a lot.

72
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:34,725
-NASA?
-That doesn't surprise you?

73
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:36,605
At least it explains the secrecy.

74
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:40,203
The secrecy's critical, Norman.
You made that explicit in your report.

75
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,002
What report?

76
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,607
ULF.

77
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,802
l wrote that
for the Bush administration.

78
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:49,566
And that's our bible here.

79
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:54,126
But that was a report about a possible
encounter with an alien being.

80
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:58,650
You want to come with me?

81
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:02,687
Oh, boy.

82
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,048
About 3 weeks ago. . .

83
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:07,808
. . .a ship laying fiber-optic cable
between Honolulu and Sydney. . .

84
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,487
. . .hit an obstruction
1 ,OOO feet underwater.

85
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,372
Cut this cable here
clean as a shears.

86
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:16,127
The Navy got interested,
sent out a search ship.

87
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:18,603
lt turned out that what did it. . .

88
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:20,172
. . .was this.

89
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:22,369
We took this with side-looking sonar.

90
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:25,247
This is an aerodynamic fin
longer than a football field. . .

91
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:26,972
. . .bigger than any known wingspan.

92
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:29,007
This is the fuselage.

93
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:33,132
This is ultrahigh-res SLS bottom scan.
Came in a week ago.

94
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:36,365
There it is, buried
under about 8 yards of coral.

95
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:38,970
Something's wrong
with that measurement.

96
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,649
Pacific coral grows an inch a year.
You can set your watch by it.

97
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:43,848
That's right.

98
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:47,768
So you're saying this spacecraft
crashed in the year. . . .

99
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:49,163
1 7O9.

100
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:52,007
So you're saying this spacecraft crashed
3OO years ago?

101
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:53,652
288.

102
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:54,769
That's impossible.

103
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:58,289
lt's not impossible if this spacecraft
came from an alien civilization.

104
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,966
Wait a minute.

105
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,726
You think this is an alien spacecraft?

106
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:04,531
lt's not impossible.
lt's ridiculous.

107
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:08,368
We think there's an Unknown Life Form on
the spacecraft. That's why you're here.

108
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:12,249
You are the contact team that
was recommended in the Goodman Report.

109
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:14,367
We have a biochemist. . .

110
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:17,167
. . .to assess the physiology
of the Unknown Life Form.

111
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,405
A mathematician, because that'll
probably be our common language.

112
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:23,651
And we have an astrophysicist
to locate its place in the cosmos.

113
00:08:23,893 --> 00:08:25,485
-Led by a psychologist.
-Right.

114
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,930
Nowadays, the little green men say,
''Take me to your therapist''?

115
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:30,928
Listen up.

116
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:34,447
''Contact teams meeting
an Unknown Life Form or ULF. . .

117
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,127
. . .must be prepared
for severe psychological impact.

118
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:41,127
Stress reaction of confronting such life
has not been sufficiently studied. . .

119
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:43,682
. . .and cannot be
entirely predicted in advance.

120
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,652
But the most likely consequence
of contact is. . .

121
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,167
. . .absolute terror. ''

122
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:49,812
That's from Norman's report.

123
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,567
l'm sorry, are these parameters correct?

124
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:57,005
You're saying that you have a spacecraft
over a half a mile long. . .

125
00:08:57,253 --> 00:09:00,290
. . .that crashed into the ocean 3OO years
ago and it's completely intact?

126
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:01,768
That's right.

127
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:05,801
And the kicker is, our sonar
is picking up a low-level hum.

128
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:07,247
Something's still running inside.

129
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:10,291
There's no way this coral could've grown
faster than an inch a year?

130
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,725
That's what we're going there to see.

131
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:13,723
What?

132
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:14,803
Who says?

133
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,132
Harry, that's a joke, right?

134
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:20,524
This is the greatest scientific
discovery since Copernicus. Bigger!

135
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:23,492
The idea that we're not alone,
it'll change everything.

136
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:27,482
Evidence of extraterrestrial life.
You don't want to see that?

137
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:31,049
l got to say that l resent
this briefing very much.

138
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:32,362
And how's that?

139
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:35,771
lf Norman's report calls for a biologist,
a mathematician. . .

140
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:38,083
. . .an astrophysicist
and a psychologist. . .

141
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,482
. . .why are you here?

142
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,807
Physical protocols
start in a half an hour.

143
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,561
You always wear glasses?

144
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:47,009
l just started wearing these.

145
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:50,883
Are the glasses a problem?
l don't actually need them.

146
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,168
They're just for reading.

147
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:54,608
And they're more of a crutch.
l see fine without them.

148
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:59,085
But they didn't anticipate
l'd be going 1 ,OOO feet under the water.

149
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,686
Do you take prescription medication?

150
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,809
No.

151
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:03,611
None at all?

152
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:08,370
Once in a while
sometimes l might take like a. . .

153
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,372
. . .a piece of Xanax
or something if l'm nervous.

154
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:12,841
Something like that.

155
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:14,128
But not. . .

156
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:15,806
. . .much.

157
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:19,887
Knee surgery. Complete reconstruction
of ACL, right knee.

158
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:24,092
Still have steel pin here, steel pin
here, little medial collateral damage.

159
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,603
l see that you have a scar
on your neck.

160
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:28,206
Car accident.

161
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,648
-Were you drinking?
-Yeah.

162
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:32,121
But l wasn't driving.

163
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:37,006
Wait, l just want to apologize
for putting your name on the list.

164
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,083
Why?

165
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:42,087
When l made the report a few years ago,
l picked names of people l knew.

166
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,129
And?

167
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:46,410
l know Ted because of his father.

168
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,371
-Yeah, so what?
-Beth was a patient.

169
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,086
lt's a bogus report.

170
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,563
What? Did you tell Barnes?

171
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:55,281
You can't do that.
That's fraud.

172
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:59,203
They came to me, new administration,
right? Political agenda.

173
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:02,650
They said, in case of an alien invasion,
do's and don'ts.

174
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:03,962
Why didn't you just say no?

175
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:06,487
$35,OOO.

176
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:07,961
lt paid the down payment
on my house.

177
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:11,046
New administration wanted to prove
they're doing something new.

178
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,443
How'd you come up with this team. . .

179
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:16,446
. . .of a biologist, an astrophysicist
and a mathematician?

180
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:17,682
Right.

181
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,605
-How?
-l don't know.

182
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:23,050
lt sounded good, right?
Made them come to me.

183
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:25,568
l forgive you, Norman.
l forgive you!

184
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:28,771
But l don't forgive you for Ted.
He's a pain in the ass.

185
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:30,207
l'll talk to him.

186
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:32,444
We'll be there 2 hours.
You don't have to be around him.

187
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,844
He idolizes you anyways, but l'll talk
to him. l'll buy you dinner.

188
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:39,324
-l'm sorry.
-Your secret's safe with me. Come on.

189
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:42,451
l can't believe this thing could. . . .
Like a dream.

190
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:44,285
Have you called your wife?

191
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:45,642
Why not?

192
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:49,004
This'll be a saturation dive.

193
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,972
You'll be going to a habitat
in 1 ,OOO feet of water.

194
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,807
A sub will take you to the Habitat
and you'll transfer aboard.

195
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:58,529
At 1 ,OOO feet, your body
will be pressurized for that depth.

196
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:01,925
You could actually take a quick dip.
The pressure wouldn't bother you.

197
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:05,330
Although l wouldn't recommend it
because the water's so cold. . .

198
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:08,326
. . .you'd freeze to death
in less than 2 minutes.

199
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:10,325
That's the reason for the diving suits.

200
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:13,371
Your helmet has a rebreather
for your air supply.

201
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,408
Following this briefing, l'll take you
to an onboard dive tank.

202
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:19,042
For the next 8 hours. . .

203
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:22,569
. . .you'll train in deep-saturation dive
techniques and emergency procedures.

204
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,851
Once you've gone down 1 ,OOO feet. . .

205
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:28,449
. . .if you surface, you'll have to commit
to several days of decompression.

206
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:32,366
There is no real quick return.

207
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:33,887
However, there is a mini-sub. . .

208
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,328
. . .that may be used as an emergency
escape vehicle.

209
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:39,133
But there must be a ship at the surface
to mate to for decompression.

210
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:42,649
Without decompression,
your body would literally burst.

211
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,921
Under these circumstances,
you're very well-controlled.

212
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:49,483
The dive has been planned well
and professionally monitored.

213
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:14,810
The descent will take about 1 3 minutes,
descending at 8O feet a minute.

214
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:18,167
lt's going to get chilly.

215
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:21,685
Try to relax.

216
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:26,132
Next time, just tell us
when you're going to push the button.

217
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:35,722
Mozart. . .

218
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:38,043
...Horn Concerto in E-flat...

219
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:39,965
...K-447.

220
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,168
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?

221
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:05,766
-l'm loose.
-You're loose?

222
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,162
l'm loose. l'm loose.

223
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:08,809
l'm uptight.

224
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:10,850
-We okay?
-We're in the river now.

225
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,003
What river?

226
00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:14,403
lt's a temperature/salinity
differential.

227
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,723
lt flows like a river
inside the ocean.

228
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:20,489
-Under the ocean and there's a river.
-That's right.

229
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:26,609
You okay?

230
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:29,287
Right now, l'm not okay.
Would you please not touch me?

231
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,683
We're both nervous. Yes?

232
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:35,885
Would you cut that out, please?

233
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:39,284
You're having a stress reaction.
That's Harry's stress reaction.

234
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,533
Those noises we're hearing,
that's normal?

235
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:49,846
Those noises are the water pressure
attacking the sub's integrity.

236
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,293
You know a little something about that,
don't you, Norman?

237
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,967
How the pressure
can attack your integrity.

238
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,244
Come on, you be nice this trip.

239
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,491
Were you nice last time?

240
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,326
You two want to sit together?

241
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,366
My God!

242
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:14,002
Norman, look at this, look at this.

243
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:17,402
Jesus! That's just the fin.

244
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:52,812
That's the Habitat.

245
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:56,688
The Navy moved it in sections
and set it up as a base...

246
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,242
...as soon as the spaceship
was discovered.

247
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,530
lt's manned by 2 naval personnel.

248
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:05,083
lt will be your home-away-from-home
while we investigate the spacecraft.

249
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:07,809
lt ain't the Motel 6.

250
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,571
Approaching docking bay from R-4.

251
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:42,410
All personnel, descent sub one
engaging lock area.

252
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,845
You are now depressurized.

253
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,323
We're going to pressurize you now.

254
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:11,401
lt's hot in there, but you're going to
feel coolness. That's the helium.

255
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:14,407
-Helium?
-Was l the only one paying attention?

256
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:18,766
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same
family as fluorine and chlorine. . .

257
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:20,731
. . .hydrochloric acid,
hydrofluoric acid.

258
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,645
That's why we're breathing helium.

259
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:26,283
Because oxygen at any level
higher than 2.3 becomes toxic.

260
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:29,963
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
l don't speak balloon.

261
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,128
What?

262
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:35,922
That's my voice. The helium resonates
differently with my vocal chords.

263
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:37,925
''Follow the yellow brick road. ''

264
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:40,287
Kiddies, cut it out.

265
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,729
The voice regulators are behind you.
Put them on.

266
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:46,567
The Navy dive team is setting up
a hydraulic robot. . .

267
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,849
. . .in the air lock
outside the spacecraft.

268
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,243
We'll use that to open its door.

269
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:54,006
ls that the door?

270
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:58,644
Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint
it before the divers went down.

271
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:02,329
-How tall is that robot?
-Five feet.

272
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:05,246
And it's roughly the same size
as an airplane door, isn't it?

273
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:07,848
-Excuse me, Ted.
-l think that's worth taking note of.

274
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,250
Excuse me. Tell them our team
is in place and ready, okay?

275
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:13,404
This is Habitat to Navy dive.

276
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:16,487
Has it occurred to anyone
maybe we shouldn't open that door?

277
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:18,322
Why do you say that?

278
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:20,131
We assume they'll be green. . .

279
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:21,772
. . .or insect-like,
but basically human.

280
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:24,971
But what if they inhale air
and exhale cyanide gas? lt's plausible.

281
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:27,408
Or live forever,
like a virus or a yeast.

282
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:30,731
But why would you assume that a ULF
would want to kill us?

283
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:33,203
An immortal creature wouldn't think
killing was right or wrong.

284
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:34,772
lt'd have no concept of it.

285
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,891
lnstant eradication. lt's what all the
serious scientific stuff talks about.

286
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,486
What little there is on the subject.

287
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:41,570
You did put that in your report?

288
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:43,081
lt's in there.

289
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:49,451
Get us the ETD for team's departure
to surface.

290
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,570
Tell them we're in ready
and thank them.

291
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:54,281
Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team's ready to take over.

292
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,001
Descent sub ready
for your return to surface.

293
00:18:57,253 --> 00:19:00,051
Thanks for all your help.
We'll let you know what we find.

294
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:13,649
l'm not too thrilled
at the prospect of this.

295
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,730
What if you have to go to the bathroom?

296
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:17,292
Just go down your leg, Ted.

297
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,088
Really?

298
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,652
You can urinate in these?

299
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:21,769
You can.

300
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,368
The question is, do you want to?

301
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,812
Where's the switch?

302
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:44,851
Okay, let's go.

303
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:16,331
All right, Fletcher. . .

304
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:19,890
. . .we're at 1 ,O22 feet.

305
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:23,491
The ambient temperature,
34 degrees.

306
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:25,810
Heading out north-northwest...

307
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,732
. . .33O.

308
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:29,962
lt's a firm bottom.

309
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:31,282
lntermittent coral.

310
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:35,883
This is great, you guys.

311
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:01,328
Look at the size of that thing!

312
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:08,363
My God!

313
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:16,171
You see that tunnel?

314
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:18,931
That's where we're going.

315
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,650
lnto the heart of darkness.

316
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,882
We're in the coral pipe now, Fletcher,
approaching the air lock.

317
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:43,882
l'm feeling pressure in my ears.
ls that normal?

318
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,124
Just use your equalizer.

319
00:21:47,093 --> 00:21:48,242
A little better.

320
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:52,051
The most toxic creatures on Earth
live down here.

321
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:55,444
The venom of the land animal
is nothing by comparison.

322
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:59,403
Even the weakest sea snake
is invariably lethal.

323
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:02,043
ls that supposed to make me
feel good, Beth?

324
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:05,488
This is our air lock.

325
00:22:06,853 --> 00:22:09,845
lt'll take us from a wet
to a dry environment.

326
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,288
We're assuming the inside
of the ship is sealed.

327
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,410
This thing is enormous.

328
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:25,732
That's not budging, is it?

329
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,885
-Turn it at 45 degrees.
-What's happening here?

330
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,202
ls that piston broken?

331
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:32,047
Can you get the suction cup
flat to the plane of the door?

332
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,686
Maybe it's the hydraulics.

333
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:36,322
The pressure messes everything up
at this depth.

334
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:40,322
Time for a demonstration
in basic physics, gentlemen.

335
00:23:47,413 --> 00:23:48,243
What is it, Harry?

336
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,608
Take a look.

337
00:23:49,893 --> 00:23:50,882
lt's chipped.

338
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,407
All right, it's chipped.
So what?

339
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:55,247
l thought you said this thing
wasn't damaged when it crashed. . .

340
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:58,883
. . .that this titanium alloy was
so super-strong, you can't hurt it.

341
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:00,408
l did.

342
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:03,561
So why does it chip when this scientist
just bangs it with a hammer?

343
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:05,252
ls there heat coming off this thing?

344
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:08,529
You're right. Get out of there.
Back up.

345
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:10,001
Just a minute.

346
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:11,965
l mean, get back now!
Get back.

347
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:14,608
Jesus.

348
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:30,045
Anybody else wonder who the hell
opened that door?

349
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,127
How did that happen?

350
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:39,131
l'm not sure about the atmosphere.
Helmets stay on.

351
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:40,488
All right.

352
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,929
We come in peace.

353
00:24:44,773 --> 00:24:46,126
Always wanted to say that.

354
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,610
Fletcher, inform the Navy
we've gained access. . .

355
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:55,605
... to the spacecraft.

356
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:58,361
There's a hell of a lot of
radiation shielding in here.

357
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:03,252
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing. . .

358
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,845
. . .and a lot of steam.

359
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,801
lt's endless.
We'll stay in touch here.

360
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:23,322
Somebody's been here.

361
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:27,087
There's footsteps
and they ain't ours.

362
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,285
So what do you say, Norman?
Time to turn back?

363
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:34,812
l'm a little curious.

364
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:38,450
Break up into 2 squads. We'll
never cover the territory otherwise.

365
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:39,569
Split up?

366
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:43,362
He's got a point. We've only got about
a half-hour of breathing time left.

367
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:45,649
Ted and Harry,
you come with me.

368
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:48,691
Beth, Norman, stick together.
Come on.

369
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:51,768
l think the people who built this place
would call that ''divide and conquer. ''

370
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:55,204
Whoever built this thing wanted us dead,
we'd be dead already.

371
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:01,289
These guys offer a federal grant to
study the effects of an alien invasion.

372
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,125
l told all this to Harry.

373
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:04,601
You made up the report?

374
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:07,287
No, not all of it. l mean,
l did research on half of it.

375
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:08,608
Who did the other half?

376
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:12,010
l borrowed from, you know,
good writers.

377
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:14,528
lsaac Asimov, Rod Serling. . . .

378
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,448
Rod Serling?

379
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:20,686
Who would've thought anyone even reads
those government reports. You know?

380
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:23,606
l show up here,
half the Pacific fleet is here.

381
00:26:23,893 --> 00:26:26,805
l just didn't know what to do.
l wanted to tell you, that's all.

382
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:31,047
ls this in the same category as,
''Beth, l thought you knew l was married''?

383
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:35,610
l don't think we have enough oxygen--

384
00:26:40,253 --> 00:26:42,687
-Oh, my God.
-Did you push something?

385
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:44,965
No. lt did it on its own.

386
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:15,288
That must be the cockpit.

387
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:17,562
Hold on.

388
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:24,646
Look at this. Cross-stress bracing
on the outer hulls.

389
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,929
All axes supported.
Look at this stuff.

390
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:30,643
This is interesting.
Soft and strong at the same time.

391
00:27:30,893 --> 00:27:33,646
lt's, like, better than rubber,
better than steel.

392
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:35,207
You know a lot
about this stuff.

393
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,842
l studied aeronautical engineering
at M.l.T.

394
00:27:38,093 --> 00:27:39,765
lsn't that where you got your Ph.D.?

395
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:42,368
lt's where l got mine.
All 3 of them.

396
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:43,728
l hated M.l.T.

397
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:44,570
Envy?

398
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:45,529
Puberty.

399
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:46,523
How old?

400
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,571
First Ph.D., 1 8.

401
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:49,723
Damn.

402
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:52,123
One year, Harry.
You beat me by one year.

403
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:53,972
Let's push on.

404
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:55,203
Let's go.

405
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:58,684
Man, they didn't tell you how heavy
these things were out of the water.

406
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:03,042
Look at this.

407
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:04,607
Come here.

408
00:28:08,693 --> 00:28:09,921
''Trash. ''

409
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:11,288
''Basura. ''

410
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:13,647
Trash?

411
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:27,961
Oh, God.

412
00:28:30,573 --> 00:28:32,370
Jesus!

413
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:35,772
lt's human.

414
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:38,048
You mean humanoid.

415
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:41,085
No, Norman, l mean human.

416
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:42,602
Blunt force trauma.

417
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,368
You can see by the direction
that the fracture runs. . .

418
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:47,086
. . .that he was hit
in the back of the head.

419
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:48,723
What's in his hand?

420
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:50,572
l don't know.

421
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:54,767
What is it?

422
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,086
''Smokehouse Almonds''?

423
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:04,243
My God, it's an American spaceship.

424
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,085
lt can't be
an American spaceship.

425
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,006
lt's 3OO years old. There weren't
even Americans, let alone spaceships.

426
00:29:09,253 --> 00:29:11,164
lt can't be, but it is.

427
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:15,202
Let's see if there's some kind of
flight recorder or data computer. . .

428
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,683
. . .where we can ring up
some kind. . .

429
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:19,764
. . .of a flight history.
l mean. . . .

430
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:27,048
Look at this. lt's in English.
Come here.

431
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:31,327
Okay, good.

432
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:33,612
Right there.

433
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:35,366
And there.

434
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,485
Look at the dates!

435
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:45,248
Can't be.

436
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:47,409
Could be.

437
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,769
lt could be 2O43 or 1 643.

438
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:51,651
l don't know
which one is weirder.

439
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:01,250
''Unknown Entry Event. ''
Press it.

440
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:04,567
You sure?

441
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,166
This is Barnes, Norman.

442
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,244
Yeah, l can hear you.

443
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:17,285
l can't explain it, but l think
we're inside an American spaceship.

444
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,811
lt gets better.

445
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:27,721
What the hell is it?

446
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:31,249
Whatever it is, it seems to be
what this bird was designed to do.

447
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:35,122
Go out into space and gather
things like this up and bring it back.

448
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:36,886
Yeah, but back from where?

449
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:38,566
Don't get too excited, Ted.

450
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:42,125
Turn this thing over,
it'll probably say ''Made in Korea. ''

451
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:43,852
Somehow l doubt that.

452
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:45,447
No doors.

453
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:47,649
No hinges of any kind.

454
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:53,411
l'll bet if you put a laser micrometer
on this, it'd be a perfect sphere.

455
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:58,166
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That's a message in and of itself.

456
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,125
-Really?
-What do you mean?

457
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:05,406
When Pope Benedict asked Giotto
to prove his worth as an artist. . .

458
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:08,773
. . .Giotto drew a perfect circle. . .

459
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:10,566
. . .freehand.

460
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:13,647
Perfection.
lt's a powerful message.

461
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:17,290
-l know what the Zen masters would say.
-What's that?

462
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,289
''This ball wants to be caught. ''

463
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:23,566
Nobody built this thing
looking into their third eye.

464
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:26,407
They went to a lot of trouble
and they didn't do it for nothing.

465
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,770
Something put this thing out there
to get picked up and brought back here.

466
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:33,005
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
lt could be a trap.

467
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,891
Don't you think
that's a little paranoid?

468
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:38,605
No, l'm going to put a video camera
on this thing and keep an eye on it.

469
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:42,286
Can l ask you something
about this reflective surface?

470
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:44,689
Yeah, it appears to be mercury,
doesn't it?

471
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:47,163
Except mercury's liquid
at this temperature.

472
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:48,971
That's not what l'm talking about.

473
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:52,963
What worries me is that
it's reflecting everything but us.

474
00:32:57,093 --> 00:33:00,210
l hate to be the one non-scientist
that picks this up, guys.

475
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:02,121
You know what l mean?

476
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,166
What do you think it is?

477
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:08,202
l don't know.

478
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:10,646
Whatever it is. . .

479
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:13,087
. . .it's alien.

480
00:33:21,493 --> 00:33:24,530
Okay, an American spacecraft,
materials, technology. . .

481
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:27,333
. . .more advanced than what we know,
crashes into the ocean.

482
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:28,642
Why wasn't it damaged?

483
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,533
The materials are
obviously super-strong.

484
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:33,809
lf that's true, why did it chip
when you hit it?

485
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,368
Better:

486
00:33:40,693 --> 00:33:42,126
lt didn't crash.

487
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:43,967
lt arrived. . .

488
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:45,852
. . .3OO years ago.

489
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:48,163
-From where?
-Not ''where. '' When.

490
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:50,768
So you're saying this thing
took a wrong turn?

491
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:52,924
That's right.
l mean, what if the craft. . .

492
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:55,323
. . .inadvertently flew
into a black hole?

493
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:58,212
lt arrived in our past from its present.

494
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,852
The dates
in the flight record--

495
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:01,446
43, 47.

496
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,003
That has to be 2O43, 2O47.

497
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,324
The image you saw,
what you described. . .

498
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:08,723
. . .sounds like a black hole,
a tear in the space--

499
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:10,452
We know
what a black hole is.

500
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:11,728
l don't know.

501
00:34:11,973 --> 00:34:15,648
lt's a collapsed star with so much
gravity it's like a vacuum cleaner. . .

502
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:18,691
. . .sucking everything into it,
light, interstellar dust, time--

503
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,889
-Time?
-lt's possible, but not plausible.

504
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:23,693
lt's more than probable.
lt's rudimentary astrophysics.

505
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:26,527
We just haven't been able
to fly into one and prove it.

506
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:48,086
l just got off the horn topside.
They're expecting a bad blow up there.

507
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:50,005
And they're pulling us out.

508
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:53,251
Pulling us out? Wait a minute!
What do you mean?

509
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:55,245
What part of ''pull out''
don't you understand?

510
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:57,171
Extraction.
We're leaving.

511
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,811
That's ridiculous. We haven't even
begun to scratch the surface here.

512
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:05,331
lf you've ever seen a Pacific cyclone,
what we call a tornado is a little fart.

513
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:08,691
So l suggest you go back
to the dormitory and take a nap.

514
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:11,731
You need to lower your metabolism
before we start the decompression.

515
00:35:11,973 --> 00:35:14,771
You're leaving a time-traveling
spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?

516
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,366
l'm just following my orders.

517
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:19,127
We're the aliens' Welcome Wagons.
But, no aliens.

518
00:35:19,373 --> 00:35:21,125
-lt was made in America.
-What's your point?

519
00:35:21,373 --> 00:35:24,206
My point is, l'm a biochemist
and there's no life down here.

520
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:25,768
What is wrong with you?!

521
00:35:26,013 --> 00:35:28,686
That doesn't mean there's
nothing to learn, to explore!

522
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:29,888
She's right.

523
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:33,523
You guys are the human contact team
for an Unknown Life Form.

524
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:37,049
There is no Unknown Life Form,
so we pull out at O9OO.

525
00:35:37,293 --> 00:35:39,011
-Please say something to him.
-What?

526
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:41,323
l don't know. Do you not have
an opinion about this?

527
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:42,807
l'm delighted
we're going back up top.

528
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:44,562
You know what l mean?

529
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:47,486
This may look like a roadside diner,
but in the meantime. . .

530
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:50,372
. . .my ears won't pop and if l pull
this thing away from my neck. . .

531
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:53,764
. . .l sound like someone's squeezing
my testicles. Let's go home.

532
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:00,691
Barnes is wrong, you know.

533
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,210
You mean,
wrong about the storm?

534
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,443
No, about the Sphere.

535
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,692
What about the Sphere?

536
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,161
lt's alive.

537
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:20,531
Why do you say that?

538
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,486
There's something inside it.

539
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:28,691
How can there be anything inside it?
There's no door, no seams.

540
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:32,803
The Sphere chooses what it will
and won't reflect.

541
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:36,045
Doesn't that seem like the actions
of a conscious being to you?

542
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:41,487
Pop psychology. l think,
for whatever it's worth, you're angry. . .

543
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,167
. . .towards our friend Ted in there. . .

544
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:46,449
. . .because he figured this out
before you did.

545
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:50,328
You really think so?

546
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,923
l don't know. This is
my first underwater session.

547
00:36:58,893 --> 00:36:59,962
You're right.

548
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:03,723
Ted did figure it out first,
didn't he?

549
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,047
Good shrinkage.

550
00:37:14,053 --> 00:37:16,328
We're all going to die down here,
you know.

551
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:19,768
What?

552
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:22,208
What?

553
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:27,324
You see, it's curious.

554
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:30,007
Ted did figure it out.

555
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:33,683
Time travel. And when we get back,
we're going to tell everyone. . .

556
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:37,084
. . .how it's possible, how it's done,
what the dangers are.

557
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:40,325
But why 5O years in the future, when the
spacecraft encounters a black hole. . .

558
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:43,007
. . .does the computer call it
an ''Unknown Entry Event''?

559
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:44,652
Why don't they know?

560
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:46,009
lf they don't know. . .

561
00:37:46,773 --> 00:37:48,684
. . .it means we never told anyone.

562
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,844
And if we never told anyone. . .

563
00:37:51,093 --> 00:37:53,129
. . .it means we never made it back.

564
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,442
Hence. . .

565
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,610
. . .we die down here.

566
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:59,687
Just as a matter
of deductive logic, Norman.

567
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:09,811
Damn, l wish l could
get inside that Sphere.

568
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:21,931
-What's wrong?
-Talk to Mr. Barnes.

569
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:23,652
-Where is he?
-Video feed room.

570
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:26,487
Where is that? l don't know
where the hell anything is.

571
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,162
Where am l?

572
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:29,847
Where?

573
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,088
What's going on?

574
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:33,652
l don't know.
You tell me.

575
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:39,484
-What the hell is he doing?
-l don't know.

576
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:41,644
Do you know what he's doing?

577
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:43,611
-l need to know what you know.
-Nothing.

578
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:44,968
He wanted to go inside.

579
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:47,249
We are inside.
You mean outside?

580
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:50,053
-He said, ''inside. ''
-What? lnside the spacecraft?

581
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,409
l think inside the Sphere.

582
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:43,122
Holy shit!

583
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:45,003
My God.

584
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:46,528
Did he go inside?

585
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,050
-l don't think so.
-What the hell's going on?

586
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:51,242
He didn't just disappear.

587
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,569
l think it's a glitch in the video.

588
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,485
Give me playback on that.

589
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,172
You'll have it in a minute.

590
00:39:57,373 --> 00:39:59,125
You knew he was doing this
and you said nothing.

591
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:01,770
-You didn't think!
-l didn't think it possible.

592
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:03,008
Where are Beth and Ted?

593
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:07,047
l don't know. l woke up, l heard
bells ringing and l started running--

594
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:09,170
l'm not getting an image
on the sub.

595
00:40:10,093 --> 00:40:11,845
lmpossible!
l got a cable in my quarters!

596
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:13,367
They'll be here in 25 minutes or less!

597
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:16,406
The only logical explanation
is that the sub is still at the surface.

598
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:18,604
ls it also logically possible
your sonar is messed up?!

599
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:20,571
Let's just calm down, all right?

600
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:23,373
He didn't just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.

601
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:27,322
You got that right. l am not going to
lose a civilian on my watch.

602
00:40:27,653 --> 00:40:29,564
You have just screwed up
our trip to the surface.

603
00:40:29,773 --> 00:40:31,126
We are not going up to the surface.

604
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:33,091
Harry!
We are not going up!

605
00:40:33,293 --> 00:40:34,772
Harry!
Can you hear me?

606
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:36,651
Harry, can you hear me?

607
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:39,886
Norman, this is not a triage situation.

608
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:45,006
Go find me Ted and Beth.

609
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:54,047
Norman, stop.

610
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:12,608
Still no reading on the sub.

611
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:15,122
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.

612
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:19,366
When Beth and Ted get here, make sure
they don 't go anywhere. All right?

613
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:04,532
What the hell?

614
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:06,081
Can you hear me?

615
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,562
ls he alive?

616
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:25,050
We have a problem.
Harry's out cold. His pulse is normal.

617
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:27,563
All his vitals are normal...

618
00:42:27,973 --> 00:42:29,326
. . .but l don't get it.

619
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:48,491
Hello. Hello!

620
00:42:57,293 --> 00:43:01,605
Norman, can you hear me?
We lost video here. Can you hear me?

621
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:06,204
-That tears it.
-What, sir?

622
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:08,087
We're on internal power.

623
00:43:08,813 --> 00:43:09,643
l don 't follow you.

624
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:13,967
They cut us loose, Teeny.
For some reason the sub turned back.

625
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:16,170
Break out your 5-day deodorant pads.

626
00:43:16,413 --> 00:43:18,131
We're here for the duration.

627
00:43:27,253 --> 00:43:28,527
Everything's normal.

628
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,490
What's going on?
ls he all right?

629
00:43:37,973 --> 00:43:40,203
ls it true? Did he go inside?
What did he say?

630
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,530
He didn't say.
He's aphasic.

631
00:43:43,773 --> 00:43:45,092
He's asleep, Ted.

632
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:48,091
l can't believe he went inside.
He didn't say anything?

633
00:43:48,413 --> 00:43:50,643
There's no door, no entry.
How did he get in?

634
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:01,250
Can l have your attention, please?

635
00:44:01,493 --> 00:44:03,290
We've lost contact with the surface.

636
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:06,730
The Habitat is now operating
solely under internal power.

637
00:44:07,293 --> 00:44:09,648
We have plenty of food, oxygen
and fresh water...

638
00:44:09,893 --> 00:44:11,770
... to sustain us
until the storm is over...

639
00:44:11,973 --> 00:44:14,533
...and we reestablish contact
with the surface.

640
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:18,050
But until that time,
this mission is subject...

641
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:20,563
. . .to emergency authority
under my command.

642
00:44:47,573 --> 00:44:49,291
l'm taking this out
to the mini-sub.

643
00:44:49,493 --> 00:44:52,212
-Are you up on the duty roster?
-Yes, sir.

644
00:44:54,453 --> 00:44:55,568
Where's she going?

645
00:44:55,853 --> 00:44:59,050
lt's procedures.
Everything in the Habitat is videoed.

646
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:04,204
Every 1 2 hours we take the videos to
the mini-sub and press the reset button.

647
00:45:04,853 --> 00:45:07,572
The idea is, if something happens to us
and we don't reset it. . .

648
00:45:07,813 --> 00:45:10,452
. . .the sub goes to the surface
automatically.

649
00:45:10,693 --> 00:45:14,572
lf we're all dead, they at least have
a partial record of what went wrong.

650
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:16,926
Cheerful thought, huh?

651
00:45:17,973 --> 00:45:19,406
Mind the store a minute.

652
00:45:20,573 --> 00:45:22,052
l'm going to the head.

653
00:46:02,653 --> 00:46:04,052
What the hell's that?

654
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:14,971
lt's so beautiful down here.

655
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,091
lt's so tranquil.

656
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:20,927
This is beautiful.

657
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:23,886
lt's hard to believe we have a typhoon
1 ,OOO feet above our heads.

658
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:26,969
Hey, it's snowing down here.

659
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:29,810
You see them?
There's got to be a million...

660
00:46:30,013 --> 00:46:31,412
. . .jellyfish down here.

661
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:34,404
Man, this is really beautiful.

662
00:46:37,173 --> 00:46:39,926
These jellyfish are getting
a little friendly.

663
00:46:40,773 --> 00:46:42,491
Having a hard time seeing.

664
00:46:44,053 --> 00:46:47,363
Hey, guys, you getting this?
lt's getting thick down here.

665
00:46:47,613 --> 00:46:49,092
Hello, hello.

666
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:53,372
l can 't see what l'm doing.

667
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:58,329
They're sticking to my faceplate.

668
00:46:58,653 --> 00:47:02,168
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding. Just
swim through them. They're harmless.

669
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:06,366
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.

670
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:09,451
Fletcher, get out of there.

671
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:11,405
What are jellyfish doing at 1 ,OOO feet?

672
00:47:11,653 --> 00:47:13,962
l think they feel
the heat from my body.

673
00:47:15,613 --> 00:47:17,171
l can't get them off me!

674
00:47:19,373 --> 00:47:21,329
They're stinging through my suit!

675
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,325
Get back to the Habitat
on the double.

676
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:26,290
l can't move my legs!

677
00:47:27,893 --> 00:47:28,928
Come back to the Habitat.

678
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:31,091
They're inside my suit!

679
00:47:32,173 --> 00:47:33,891
Keep moving!
Just keep moving!

680
00:47:41,813 --> 00:47:43,132
Help me!

681
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:19,962
Jesus, Barnes, she's dead!
There's no bubbles.

682
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:29,968
Edmunds.

683
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:30,923
Yes, sir?

684
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:32,892
Come on down here.

685
00:48:33,373 --> 00:48:34,442
Something...

686
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:36,172
...happened to Fletcher.

687
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:05,482
God!

688
00:49:08,253 --> 00:49:11,051
When l was 5 years old
l went out on a boat with my father.

689
00:49:11,773 --> 00:49:15,243
He told me not to jump in the water,
so of course l did and. . . .

690
00:49:18,013 --> 00:49:19,890
Oh, my!

691
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:22,807
l jumped right into a school
of these guys.

692
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:24,612
Not this big, though.

693
00:49:25,653 --> 00:49:28,963
l think every one had a shot at me.
l don't know what this lady felt. . .

694
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:32,888
. . .but, man, it went beyond pain.
l've been. . .

695
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:34,962
. . .afraid of them since.

696
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:38,330
Would you feel any better if l told you
this wasn't exactly a jellyfish?

697
00:49:38,573 --> 00:49:39,210
You mean. . .?

698
00:49:40,213 --> 00:49:42,932
l mean, jellyfish like this
are unheard of.

699
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:46,649
l don't know what this is,
but it isn't God's creation.

700
00:49:58,813 --> 00:50:02,123
Here l am
Your special island

701
00:50:04,013 --> 00:50:05,765
Come to me

702
00:50:08,733 --> 00:50:10,291
Bali Ha 'i

703
00:50:21,573 --> 00:50:22,926
You can come in.

704
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:29,881
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?

705
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,363
-No, thanks.
-How well do you know Dr. Halperin?

706
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:36,003
l used to teach at UC San Diego
years ago. She came for her master's.

707
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:40,246
Don't take it personally, but l assume
she wasn't a romantic interest.

708
00:50:40,493 --> 00:50:41,721
Don't take what personally?

709
00:50:41,973 --> 00:50:43,884
She's a tall, vibrant,
younger woman.

710
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,088
What's your point?

711
00:50:45,213 --> 00:50:46,362
You knew her as a patient.

712
00:50:46,573 --> 00:50:49,007
l'm not at liberty to discuss that.
You understand.

713
00:50:49,253 --> 00:50:52,609
l understand an exotic-gas environment
1 ,OOO feet under water. . .

714
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:54,172
. . .with no lifeline to the surface. . .

715
00:50:54,413 --> 00:50:57,132
. . .is about the most dangerous
environment on the planet.

716
00:50:57,373 --> 00:50:59,250
lf there's a problem,
l got to know about it.

717
00:50:59,813 --> 00:51:01,804
-Beth is fine.
-''Beth is fine. ''

718
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:03,612
-Beth's fine.
-She's very fine.

719
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:06,526
Would you like to read this
and tell me what it says?

720
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,769
-Are these my actual notes?
-What does it say?

721
00:51:08,973 --> 00:51:11,567
-How in the world did you get--
-Does it say ''suicide attempt''?

722
00:51:11,813 --> 00:51:14,486
''Electroshock therapy''?
lsn't that what it says?

723
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:15,529
What's your point?

724
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:17,968
Didn't it seem important enough
to tell somebody?

725
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:20,129
You were willing to jeopardize
these people's lives. . .

726
00:51:20,373 --> 00:51:23,285
. . .to have someone here
who could be mentally unstable?

727
00:51:23,573 --> 00:51:24,972
Are you aware of the term,
''overreact''?

728
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:26,401
We're 1 6O fathoms down.

729
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:29,406
And we've got a nutbag down here
who can flip out and crack up.

730
00:51:29,613 --> 00:51:31,683
You selected the team.
Why didn't you tell me?

731
00:51:31,933 --> 00:51:34,288
When l wrote this, l didn't know
the team would be 1 ,OOO--

732
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:38,452
1 ,OOO or 1 O, it makes no difference!
Why didn't you tell me about Beth?

733
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:39,682
lt wasn't pertinent.

734
00:51:39,853 --> 00:51:41,252
That was not your call to make!

735
00:51:41,493 --> 00:51:43,529
Yes, it was and it still is.
lt was a passive attempt.

736
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:44,683
A passive attempt?!

737
00:51:44,933 --> 00:51:48,369
Those who really want to kill themselves
shoot themselves or go over a bridge.

738
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:51,969
They don't call their boyfriend and say,
''l just took 2O Nebutol. Help me. ''

739
00:51:52,253 --> 00:51:55,086
She took 2O yellows,
and you're telling me she's perfect.

740
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,368
What is it?
Come in.

741
00:51:58,773 --> 00:51:59,569
lt's Harry.

742
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:00,888
What?
He's awake?

743
00:52:01,093 --> 00:52:02,003
He's really awake.

744
00:52:04,093 --> 00:52:05,811
Man, oh, man!

745
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:08,566
You're going to have
a problem with me.

746
00:52:08,773 --> 00:52:11,731
lf my good buddy Norman keeps cooking
like this, l ain't going nowhere.

747
00:52:11,973 --> 00:52:13,406
This toast is good.

748
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:15,804
Bacon? Better.

749
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:20,012
But these eggs!
These eggs are fantastic!

750
00:52:20,813 --> 00:52:22,804
Norman, what did you put
in these eggs?

751
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,209
No, no, wait.
Don't tell me.

752
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:28,528
Parsley.

753
00:52:28,773 --> 00:52:31,241
Chives.
Tarragon and. . . .

754
00:52:31,813 --> 00:52:32,962
What is that?

755
00:52:33,853 --> 00:52:35,252
Chervil?
ls that chervil?

756
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:36,568
Yes, it is.

757
00:52:36,813 --> 00:52:38,804
l'm glad you like it, Harry.

758
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:40,691
l love eggs!

759
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:44,166
They sure seem
to cheer you up.

760
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:45,886
Do you remember what happened?

761
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:49,251
Yeah. l went inside.

762
00:52:49,573 --> 00:52:51,962
How did you get inside?
There are no doors.

763
00:52:52,373 --> 00:52:55,763
There are doors all over this place
and we can't get out.

764
00:52:56,013 --> 00:52:57,810
-We're still here.
-Yes, we are.

765
00:52:58,053 --> 00:52:59,691
You didn't answer my question.

766
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,406
Why are you looking
at me like that?

767
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:08,042
Harry, are you saying
we shouldn't still be here?

768
00:53:08,373 --> 00:53:10,728
Where's Teeny?
l thought she did all the cooking.

769
00:53:11,013 --> 00:53:14,050
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.

770
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:16,765
Killed? How?

771
00:53:18,493 --> 00:53:19,926
Jellyfish.

772
00:53:22,453 --> 00:53:23,932
Jellyfish?

773
00:53:24,373 --> 00:53:25,283
That's strange.

774
00:53:25,533 --> 00:53:27,046
Yes, it is strange, isn't it?

775
00:53:27,773 --> 00:53:28,967
Here you go, Harry.

776
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:33,245
-Little onion rings. Look at that.
-lt's not onion rings.

777
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:34,846
Good, though.

778
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:36,448
Guess what it is.

779
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:37,609
Calamari!

780
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:43,566
You all right?

781
00:53:44,813 --> 00:53:46,405
Cough, cough, cough.

782
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:49,607
-No, you're doing it wrong.
-l know what l'm doing.

783
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,682
Bring it up.

784
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:52,762
Come on, bring it up.

785
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:55,887
He's trying to say something.
He's trying to talk.

786
00:53:57,493 --> 00:53:59,688
You don't listen.
He wants to say something!

787
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:02,923
-l'm not choking, you asshole!
-See?

788
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,492
l hate squid.

789
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:08,446
l hate squid.

790
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:12,646
l'm sorry.

791
00:54:12,893 --> 00:54:14,406
l was trying to help.

792
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:21,043
You okay?

793
00:54:23,413 --> 00:54:25,131
Harry, let me ask you something.

794
00:54:26,093 --> 00:54:29,768
Before you went in the Sphere,
you were convinced we would die here.

795
00:54:31,173 --> 00:54:32,526
Yeah, l remember that.

796
00:54:35,173 --> 00:54:36,322
You still believe it?

797
00:54:40,093 --> 00:54:42,129
You afraid of dying, Norman?

798
00:55:04,573 --> 00:55:06,928
Bullshit!
He's hiding something and you know it.

799
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:09,971
He went inside the Sphere and whatever
it is he saw, he won't tell us.

800
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:12,852
-He said he doesn't remember anything.
-You bought that?

801
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:15,930
The whole food thing
was all a diversion.

802
00:55:16,173 --> 00:55:19,131
The guy's willing to put
all of our lives on the line. . .

803
00:55:19,373 --> 00:55:21,409
. . .because he doesn't want
to share information.

804
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:24,963
l can see it. He's making notes for a
book. He wants to win the Nobel Prize.

805
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:26,402
And you don't?

806
00:55:28,573 --> 00:55:31,212
Norman, you've known me
since l was 1 7 years old.

807
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,409
l would love to be
the guy who gets--

808
00:55:33,653 --> 00:55:34,927
Do you know
how respected--

809
00:55:35,173 --> 00:55:39,883
l'm not! l've written one
''Fun With Dick and Jane'' book on physics.

810
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:41,566
l mean, Niels Bohr. . .

811
00:55:41,813 --> 00:55:45,442
. . .he published ''The Quantum Theory
of Atomic Structure'' at 28.

812
00:55:45,693 --> 00:55:49,083
Einstein, relativity, 26.
Newton, gravity, 23.

813
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:52,848
ln physics, if you haven't done it
by 35, chances are you never will.

814
00:55:53,093 --> 00:55:56,688
This doesn't have anything to do
with your competitiveness with Harry?

815
00:55:57,453 --> 00:55:58,852
1 9. Wunderkind!

816
00:55:59,093 --> 00:56:00,412
l rest my case.

817
00:56:00,973 --> 00:56:02,486
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.

818
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,409
Why?

819
00:56:03,613 --> 00:56:05,524
Something's wrong
with the computer system.

820
00:56:14,493 --> 00:56:17,451
-Try purging it.
-l tried. lt just keeps coming back.

821
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:19,252
Discharge from the buffer memory?

822
00:56:19,453 --> 00:56:21,250
l ruled that out.

823
00:56:21,933 --> 00:56:25,005
The helium is getting to the chips.
lt's probably a saturation effect.

824
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:28,450
-lf that's true, what are our options?
-You have to change all the chips.

825
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:31,765
Forget it. Run this place on manual?
lt's going to be a long 4 days.

826
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:33,367
Hey, boss.

827
00:56:35,013 --> 00:56:37,481
-Figured that out yet?
-lt's a saturation effect.

828
00:56:37,733 --> 00:56:41,646
l don't think so. lf it's a saturation
effect, it would be random.

829
00:56:42,253 --> 00:56:43,288
What do you mean?

830
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:45,604
This has a pattern.

831
00:56:53,373 --> 00:56:54,965
See? lt's like a code.

832
00:56:55,253 --> 00:56:56,652
A code from where?

833
00:56:58,773 --> 00:56:59,649
How'd you do that?

834
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:00,763
How'd you see that?

835
00:57:00,973 --> 00:57:02,167
Try binary.

836
00:57:09,613 --> 00:57:11,126
See? Letter breaks.

837
00:57:21,413 --> 00:57:23,290
You think this is coming
from the Sphere?

838
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:24,602
Don't know.

839
00:57:25,173 --> 00:57:29,086
This mission is ultra top-secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.

840
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:33,646
lf you were it,
how would you know our alphabet?

841
00:57:33,893 --> 00:57:36,043
Same way it's configured on a keyboard.

842
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:39,609
But reflected in an orb,
spherically.

843
00:57:40,093 --> 00:57:42,288
A keyboard, but spherical.

844
00:57:42,853 --> 00:57:44,252
Take a keyboard. . .

845
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:45,812
. . .wrap it around a sphere. . .

846
00:57:46,053 --> 00:57:48,726
. . .then starting at the center key, G,
number the letters. . .

847
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:50,770
. . .spiraling out.

848
00:57:51,453 --> 00:57:53,444
-You the man!
-l still got it.

849
00:57:53,773 --> 00:57:55,411
l still got the juice.

850
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:02,802
Keyboard.

851
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:04,528
They let you keep those?

852
00:58:05,293 --> 00:58:06,646
Here, you want them?

853
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:11,928
All we got to do now
is plug in the numbers.

854
00:58:37,173 --> 00:58:38,288
Friends. . .

855
00:58:38,733 --> 00:58:42,885
. . .in the 8,OOO years
of recorded history, this is a first.

856
00:58:43,613 --> 00:58:47,083
You're now on-line
with an alien intelligence.

857
00:58:47,853 --> 00:58:50,526
You got to be kidding.
You must've messed up the translation.

858
00:58:50,733 --> 00:58:51,688
l don't think so.

859
00:58:51,893 --> 00:58:54,361
lf this is right,
this alien sounds like an idiot.

860
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:58,725
That's something to consider.
A stupid alien. They must have them.

861
00:58:59,053 --> 00:59:03,251
l will admit the message is childlike,
but actually it's quite perfect.

862
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:05,683
lt's short, to the point,
non-threatening. . .

863
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:08,572
. . .kind of the way you talk
to a small child or a dog.

864
00:59:10,933 --> 00:59:12,252
Look at this.

865
00:59:13,573 --> 00:59:15,450
He's making a speech.

866
00:59:26,453 --> 00:59:27,852
Ask him for his last name.

867
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:28,923
What?

868
00:59:29,173 --> 00:59:31,448
l want a full name for my report.

869
00:59:32,053 --> 00:59:35,523
l'm not putting in my report l lost
a crew member on a deepsat expedition. . .

870
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:37,172
. . .to find an alien named Jerry.

871
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:38,362
Please! ''Jerry''?

872
00:59:38,613 --> 00:59:40,808
We ought to tell him
that we're enjoying it too.

873
00:59:41,053 --> 00:59:42,691
Ask him where he's from.

874
00:59:44,453 --> 00:59:46,808
Where are you from?

875
00:59:53,053 --> 00:59:56,329
''l make a journey. You make a journey.
We make a journey together. ''

876
00:59:56,573 --> 00:59:59,246
l think Jerry's channeling
Deepak Chopra.

877
01:00:00,173 --> 01:00:01,845
A journey from where?

878
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:16,728
He's happy.

879
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:18,248
He's crafty.

880
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:22,689
What happened?

881
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:25,045
Damn, l think we lost him.

882
01:00:26,653 --> 01:00:28,052
We're not alone.

883
01:00:28,973 --> 01:00:30,645
We are definitely. . .

884
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,212
. . .not alone.

885
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:34,843
lt's trying to make contact with us.

886
01:00:35,413 --> 01:00:39,645
Whatever it is, it was inside
that Sphere. Now it's out, free to act.

887
01:00:39,933 --> 01:00:41,002
What do you mean by that?

888
01:00:41,253 --> 01:00:42,971
Free to take over our computers. . .

889
01:00:43,213 --> 01:00:46,569
. . .call us on the phone,
come knock on the door if it wants to.

890
01:00:47,693 --> 01:00:48,842
A physical presence.

891
01:00:49,253 --> 01:00:50,527
What are you thinking about?

892
01:00:50,733 --> 01:00:52,325
That last part where he said,
''l am happy. ''

893
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:54,410
Don't you want Jerry to be happy?

894
01:00:54,773 --> 01:00:55,922
Honestly?

895
01:00:56,213 --> 01:00:57,168
What's on your mind?

896
01:00:57,373 --> 01:01:00,365
l would be happy if Jerry
had no emotions whatsoever.

897
01:01:00,693 --> 01:01:03,002
Because the thing of it is,
here's Jerry. . .

898
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:08,008
. . .an emotional being, cooped up
for 3OO years with no one to talk to. . .

899
01:01:08,253 --> 01:01:10,813
. . .none of the socialization,
the emotional growth. . .

900
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:13,567
. . .that comes from contact
with other emotional beings. . . .

901
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:15,127
So?

902
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:18,408
What happens if Jerry gets mad?

903
01:01:37,773 --> 01:01:39,092
What is that sound?

904
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:40,652
Did you hear it?

905
01:01:41,813 --> 01:01:42,802
You hear that thump?

906
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,327
What is that sound?

907
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:48,211
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?

908
01:01:49,493 --> 01:01:50,846
You are a hell of a woman.

909
01:01:51,053 --> 01:01:53,806
l wish l knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were--

910
01:01:54,053 --> 01:01:56,362
Norman told you what?

911
01:01:57,973 --> 01:02:01,727
Let's put it this way,
that if Jerry could read your mind. . .

912
01:02:01,973 --> 01:02:03,964
. . .he'd be bored with ours.

913
01:02:07,013 --> 01:02:08,844
What is that sound?

914
01:02:09,613 --> 01:02:10,966
Can you hear me?

915
01:02:14,013 --> 01:02:15,332
This is Norman.

916
01:02:15,573 --> 01:02:19,361
l get no answer from Edmunds and there's
strange noises. Something's going on.

917
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:34,043
lt looks like Edmunds is up
on the side of the Habitat.

918
01:02:36,493 --> 01:02:40,042
l'm not getting anything on sonar,
but watch yourselves out there.

919
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:55,769
Would you hit
your callback buttons, please?

920
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:58,165
What'd you tell Barnes?

921
01:02:58,773 --> 01:02:59,922
About what?

922
01:03:00,573 --> 01:03:01,767
About me.

923
01:03:03,133 --> 01:03:06,682
You told him l took 2O Nebutol
and tried to kill myself.

924
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:07,843
Didn't you?

925
01:03:08,093 --> 01:03:10,084
He had my notes.
What do you want me to do?

926
01:03:12,093 --> 01:03:14,288
Did you tell him who l called?

927
01:03:21,213 --> 01:03:22,328
Oh, God.

928
01:03:32,053 --> 01:03:33,202
Come in.

929
01:03:52,613 --> 01:03:54,649
Did you guys find that thumping yet?

930
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,326
l don't get it.
What could've done this to her?

931
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,647
My God!

932
01:04:37,693 --> 01:04:39,206
She's like a rag doll.

933
01:04:40,573 --> 01:04:42,803
Her body's been completely pulverized.

934
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:44,168
My God.

935
01:04:46,773 --> 01:04:50,129
''--tentacles 27 feet long.
That would make a formidable monster. ''

936
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:57,162
Let's go. Come on.
What?

937
01:05:00,253 --> 01:05:01,481
What is that?

938
01:05:05,213 --> 01:05:06,566
What does this mean?

939
01:05:07,253 --> 01:05:08,447
Talk to me.

940
01:05:08,773 --> 01:05:10,491
What does this mean, Beth?

941
01:05:10,693 --> 01:05:12,684
There's something up there!

942
01:05:13,093 --> 01:05:15,687
Guys, l'm getting
a reading on the sonar.

943
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:18,487
You're not alone out there.

944
01:05:18,813 --> 01:05:22,044
What the hell makes eggs this size?!
Come on! Jesus, let's go!

945
01:05:22,413 --> 01:05:23,641
All right!

946
01:05:28,093 --> 01:05:30,607
Norman, let's go.
Come on. Let's go!

947
01:05:34,693 --> 01:05:36,172
What the hell is going on?

948
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:40,325
lt's 8O yards and closing.

949
01:05:40,653 --> 01:05:41,972
Get out of there.

950
01:05:44,413 --> 01:05:45,368
What the hell?

951
01:05:47,013 --> 01:05:48,446
What the hell is it?!

952
01:05:48,693 --> 01:05:51,082
Come on, Norman!
Come on, let's go!

953
01:05:51,693 --> 01:05:53,411
6O yards.
How close are you?

954
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:57,322
What is it?

955
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,165
What the hell is it?!

956
01:06:00,693 --> 01:06:02,411
4O yards. Move, move!

957
01:06:03,533 --> 01:06:05,808
Come on. lt's something big!
Let's go!

958
01:06:06,573 --> 01:06:08,848
Where is it?
What is it?

959
01:06:09,453 --> 01:06:10,932
2O yards! Move!

960
01:06:41,893 --> 01:06:43,008
l need a report.

961
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:46,245
l don't know what's going on out there.
There are eggs everywhere.

962
01:06:46,493 --> 01:06:48,085
You should've brought one back.

963
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:51,484
l wasn't up for an Easter egg hunt.
Maybe that's what Edmunds was doing.

964
01:06:52,453 --> 01:06:54,045
l want to talk to Jerry.

965
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:03,688
lf we're going to talk to this thing,
we got to have a game plan.

966
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:05,079
Specific.

967
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:08,202
We have to have an objective.
We have to know what we're addressing.

968
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,045
Jesus.

969
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:22,519
Can you hear me?

970
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,365
You've heard everything
we've talked about.

971
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:29,804
That's great.

972
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:33,319
This is Ted here.

973
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:37,963
l'm the guy who decoded
the keyboard thing that you--

974
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:39,765
Shut up!

975
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,160
Tell him we need to discuss this alone.

976
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:46,006
Use your words.

977
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:48,839
He's mad.

978
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:51,525
-Use your words.
-Let's just pull the plug.

979
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,044
lt may not be that simple.

980
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:55,929
lt's that easy. We leave him alone,
he leaves us alone.

981
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,240
Maybe he doesn't want to be left alone.

982
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:03,518
He's been down here in isolation
for 3OO years. Maybe Jerry's lonely.

983
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,040
What's that?

984
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:14,244
lt's our sonar picking up
something outside.

985
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:19,568
Jerry, we all think
that you're a fascinating. . .

986
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:20,799
. . .and wonderful entity. . .

987
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:24,725
. . .and wish to talk to you for hours.
You know that, don't you?

988
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:28,606
ln your great understanding
and wisdom. . .

989
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:31,648
. . .you must know that
entities such as ourselves. . .

990
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:35,603
. . .need to be private.
We have to talk alone sometime.

991
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:39,884
You know what it is?

992
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:45,880
Where'd he go?

993
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,199
Shit!

994
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:52,724
Something's clogging everything up
out there.

995
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:01,684
lt's back.

996
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:05,525
Positive thermals
on the in-line perimeter.

997
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,765
What's that?

998
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:12,129
Something is hitting the sensor grid.

999
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:13,645
Do we have any defenses?

1000
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:17,082
We can run a high-voltage current
on the skin of the Habitat.

1001
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,446
But every time we try it,
we start an electrical fire.

1002
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:23,205
Peripheral sensor's activated. l'll try
to image it on the fast-acting sonar.

1003
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:24,840
Building an image.

1004
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,042
8O yards, closing fast.

1005
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:29,721
Jesus Christ, it's 4O feet long.

1006
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:31,085
5O yards.

1007
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:32,359
Re-imaging.

1008
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:35,164
That's the same image l saw
when you were looking for Edmunds.

1009
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:37,128
lt looks like a giant squid.

1010
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:40,402
A squid the size of the entire Habitat?
There's no such animal.

1011
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:42,766
That may be,
but that doesn't mean it isn't here.

1012
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,880
Re-imaging. 3O yards.

1013
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,601
What the hell is going on?

1014
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:58,442
Jerry, if you can hear me,
it's Norman.

1015
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:00,726
lf we've made you angry. . . .

1016
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,079
We got a pressure drop.

1017
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:03,723
Go to the control room and wait for me!

1018
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:05,528
Just go, please!

1019
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,279
Go! l'll tell you!

1020
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:10,519
What's that sound?
What is that?

1021
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:12,004
lt sounds like it's right above us.

1022
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,679
l know where it is,
but what is it?

1023
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:49,170
l'm in the control shaft!
We got a leak in here!

1024
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:50,969
Hello?!

1025
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:03,809
Holy shit!

1026
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,525
Do you hear me?

1027
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:10,319
You got to increase the positive
air pressure and drive the water out.

1028
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:13,727
lncrease the pressure?
Won't that use up our air supply?

1029
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,928
lf the Habitat is full of water,
you'll be dead.

1030
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:18,808
Open the red gate valve.

1031
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:24,082
The pressure is dropping!
We'll be crushed like a tin can!

1032
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:27,362
Find the red knob!
lt's the only one in the room!

1033
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:28,918
Got it!

1034
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:33,765
Good.

1035
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:35,968
We're getting positive pressure.

1036
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:39,920
Not too much.

1037
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,609
Start to ease it back.

1038
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:54,964
Turn it back!

1039
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:57,246
The pressure is too high!

1040
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,368
We'll explode!
Can you hear me?

1041
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,329
Turn it back!

1042
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:14,919
We're here!

1043
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:15,920
Jesus!

1044
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,040
Can you hear me?

1045
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,478
l got him!

1046
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:21,803
Turn the red gate valve.

1047
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:22,920
Which way?

1048
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,239
Clockwise.
Close it.

1049
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:31,805
Done!

1050
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,884
We're still leaking!

1051
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:38,405
lt's not the shell.
lt's the internal pipes.

1052
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:39,685
We're okay.

1053
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:45,479
What the hell is out there?!

1054
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,005
Listen to me.

1055
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,808
Whatever it is,
it's not letting go.

1056
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:55,883
Pull the green lever marked
''high-voltage defense system. ''

1057
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,923
He said it would start a fire!
Don't do it!

1058
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,683
You said it would start a fire!

1059
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:03,120
We're going to die down here.
Pull it.

1060
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:04,718
Barnes, do you hear her?

1061
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:07,200
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.
Pull the green lever.

1062
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,598
Pull the lever!

1063
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,358
He's trying to pull something!
Don't do it!

1064
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:17,645
Do you hear her?!

1065
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:20,040
Don't listen to her.
Pull the goddamn lever!

1066
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,246
Don't do it.
lf we start a fire. . .

1067
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,086
. . .it'll eat up all of our oxygen!

1068
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:26,809
Don't do it!

1069
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:35,888
We've got failures all over the place!
We're taking on water!

1070
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,087
lt'll set a fire!
There's no way out!

1071
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:40,087
Shut up!
What am l going to do?!

1072
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:42,767
You're going to be squid food!
Pull it!

1073
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:45,319
What am l going to do?
We're falling apart!

1074
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,198
We're okay.

1075
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:05,520
You don't have to be right all the time.

1076
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:10,242
Anybody got some Advil?

1077
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:14,002
We got a fire in the comm room.

1078
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:17,127
Get up there. l'll meet you
with gas masks, in case we need them.

1079
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:33,320
Extinguishers?!

1080
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:34,798
There's one there.

1081
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:35,965
l got it!

1082
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:39,159
-How do you work it?
-Pull the pin.

1083
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:45,643
Are there any more?

1084
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:46,839
ln the dorm.

1085
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:57,723
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1086
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,046
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors secured.

1087
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:05,008
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1088
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:14,359
Wake up!

1089
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:15,964
What are you doing?

1090
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,729
Harry, wake up!

1091
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,279
Shit!

1092
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:47,648
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1093
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,887
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1094
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,359
Doors secured.

1095
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:59,446
lt's coming through the ceiling panels.
Try to get it through the cafeteria!

1096
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:02,284
Okay, l'm going up.
Get back!

1097
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,369
Don't, Jerry!
Don't.

1098
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:31,241
You okay?

1099
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:32,326
Hang on!

1100
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,284
Get out!

1101
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:55,919
Get out!

1102
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,161
This is Norman, Jerry.
Can you hear me?

1103
01:17:58,770 --> 01:18:01,364
lt's Norman.
ls that you, Jerry?

1104
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:03,841
Who put out the fire?

1105
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:06,961
Who put the fire out?

1106
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:16,003
He's dead. Barnes is dead.
He got cut in half by the door.

1107
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,081
Beth and l put him
in a body bag.

1108
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:23,120
l know. Something
happened to Ted, Jerry.

1109
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:26,799
l can't.

1110
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,648
lt's not in my power.

1111
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:35,448
There was a fire and. . . .

1112
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,328
And l froze.

1113
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:43,809
l didn't help him.

1114
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:48,085
l wanted to,
but l didn't help him.

1115
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:55,761
l knew him since he was 1 7 years old,
and l let him go.

1116
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:58,604
But l'd like to just deal with this
at a later time.

1117
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:06,203
You made that, Jerry?

1118
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,403
No, that's all right.

1119
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,486
Very important.
Nothing more right now. Please.

1120
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,166
You have to stop.

1121
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:23,644
Listen to me.

1122
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,926
This is critical.

1123
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:33,963
Your manifestations injure our entities.

1124
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:37,487
And pretty soon there'll be
no more entities left to play with. . .

1125
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:40,164
. . .and you'll be all alone again. . .

1126
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:42,605
. . .because you can't control yourself.

1127
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:47,526
Because with all your power, you
don't have the power to stop, do you?

1128
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:56,723
What name do you want?

1129
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,883
What name do you want?

1130
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:29,288
Hi, Harry.
How you doing?

1131
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,084
Can you believe what happened?

1132
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:34,240
What?

1133
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:36,799
You know, the attack on the Habitat.

1134
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:41,285
You know there was an attack
on this place?

1135
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:44,602
l must've slept through it.

1136
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:47,962
-You slept through it.
-l was dead tired.

1137
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:52,882
Smoke didn't bother you?

1138
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,369
All the leaking?

1139
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:59,127
You ever read this book,
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea ?

1140
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:02,885
l found it in the john.
Someone's misguided attempt at levity.

1141
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,361
l always loved this book.

1142
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:08,289
Could never get past page 87 though.
Too scary.

1143
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,999
You seem strangely detached,
given our predicament.

1144
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:12,928
l don't know, Norman.

1145
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:16,369
With all your running around,
what have you accomplished?

1146
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:18,680
You knew l was running around?

1147
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,166
Have you seen Beth?

1148
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,207
No. Thought she's
with the others.

1149
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:28,408
What others?
Barnes and Ted are dead, Harry.

1150
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:32,965
There's nobody left down here
that knows how to run the place.

1151
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:34,325
Right?

1152
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:37,159
The fire screwed up the electronics.

1153
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,563
We've used up. . .

1154
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:42,000
. . .most of our reserve gas.

1155
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:45,088
You're reading your book.

1156
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:51,922
Somebody has to go reset the mini-sub.

1157
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:55,128
lf you don't reset it every 1 2 hours,
it'll float to the surface.

1158
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:56,880
l'll go.

1159
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:59,647
-l'll go.
-You sure?

1160
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:02,566
lf the storm clears. . .

1161
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:04,727
. . .it might be our only way out.

1162
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:06,801
Can l talk to you for a second?

1163
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:10,685
l don't want Harry anywhere near
that mini-sub.

1164
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,079
Think he'll leave without us?

1165
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:15,720
l think he already left without us.
Harry's in a whole other place.

1166
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:20,327
He slept through the attack.
You don't find that a little strange?

1167
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,726
l guess it's just you and me, babe.

1168
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:26,404
You and me?

1169
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:29,961
l'll keep my eye on you
from the control room.

1170
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:58,164
Reset.

1171
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,687
Reset, where are you?

1172
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:02,479
There you are.

1173
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:24,679
Are there supposed to be bubbles. . .

1174
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:26,483
. . .coming out of. . .

1175
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:28,969
. . .out of here too?

1176
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:35,523
l think l have bubbles coming out
of my hose or something.

1177
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:42,480
Can you tell me what to do?
lt's fogging me all up here.

1178
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:46,368
There's something wrong here!

1179
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:49,403
l got to get out of here!
Tell me what to do! What do l push?

1180
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:50,958
Where the hell are you?

1181
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,285
Help me.

1182
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:59,530
l don 't think l'll ever get back!

1183
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:06,638
Tell me what to do!

1184
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,684
l can't breathe!

1185
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,767
Watch out for that rock.

1186
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,401
lt's me, Harry.
Come around the rock.

1187
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:17,766
Go to the right of the stanchion.

1188
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:19,887
Tell me what to do.
l'm hurting.

1189
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:22,122
Come around which way?

1190
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,358
l can't breathe!

1191
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:26,163
Yes, you can breathe.

1192
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:29,686
lt's just a faulty valve.
lt won't kill you. You got plenty of gas.

1193
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:31,283
l can 't tell which way l'm going!

1194
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,885
See the air lock?
Right in front of you.

1195
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:37,480
l can 't bear the feeling in my ears!

1196
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:39,209
And l can't breathe.

1197
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:04,488
-Where is she?
-Slow your breathing.

1198
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,927
-You'll hyperventilate.
-She said she'd keep an eye out for me.

1199
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:11,208
l looked all over the Habitat for her.
l thought she was with you.

1200
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:15,123
Where is she?

1201
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:16,719
Where is she?!

1202
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:28,201
Did she tell you she was going out?

1203
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:32,523
l can 't hear you.

1204
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:34,249
lf she can't hear,
why'd she answer?

1205
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:35,559
What are you doing?

1206
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:38,165
l went looking for food.
We're out of food.

1207
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:42,041
l was just up there. Stuff all over,
but there's plenty of food.

1208
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:45,566
You went to look for food in the
spacecraft. That seems a little odd.

1209
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,363
No. What seems odd about it?

1210
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:51,047
Even if there was food,
wouldn't it be at least 3OO years old?

1211
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:53,804
l was hoping for a cryogenic freezer,
you know?

1212
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:55,927
Maybe a bottle of Bordeaux.

1213
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:58,845
She's lying.
She's lying about everything.

1214
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:01,202
ls Harry up there with you?

1215
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,966
Why don't we talk when you get back.
Meet me in the galley.

1216
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:12,486
l'll buy you a cup of coffee.
There's still coffee, isn't there?

1217
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:16,519
Very funny. l'll take mine black,
like my mood.

1218
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:18,408
All right. See you soon.

1219
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:24,163
We got 2 ingredients here:
Beth and this underwater environment.

1220
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:27,527
Put them together,
you got one big-ass bomb.

1221
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:38,488
How did it go in the mini-sub?

1222
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:40,886
lt was a little disconcerting
out there, actually.

1223
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,685
Weren't you supposed to be watching out
for me from the control room?

1224
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:46,243
Yeah, but. . .

1225
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:50,403
. . .Harry said he'd take over for me.
You sat down at the monitors.

1226
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:53,919
What happened?

1227
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,278
l was in trouble.

1228
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:57,485
Where were you?

1229
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:02,600
-What's going on?
-''What's going on?''

1230
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:06,002
Going out to look for 3OO-year-old food
in that spaceship. . .

1231
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:09,128
. . .when there's plenty of food here
isn't exactly normal.

1232
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:10,644
''Plenty of food''?

1233
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:12,608
There isn't any. . . .

1234
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:20,248
A veritable horn of plenty.

1235
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,285
He must have hidden it.

1236
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:35,367
You think l hid all that food?

1237
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,369
l don't know what's going on.

1238
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:41,729
l was standing right here.

1239
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,360
And there was no food
in the cupboards.

1240
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:49,081
And there was no food
in the fridge.

1241
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:50,240
Why?

1242
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:53,050
Why would Harry do that?
Why would he set you up?

1243
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:54,928
l don't know.

1244
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:57,679
You don't know?

1245
01:27:57,930 --> 01:27:59,204
l'm telling you. . .

1246
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:01,202
. . .l was standing here. . .

1247
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:03,282
. . .and this food was not here!

1248
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:07,085
Calling Dr. Halperin. Dr. Beth
Halperin. Please return to reality.

1249
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:08,769
Shut up.

1250
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,808
You can see what he's doing to me.

1251
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:12,847
You said you'd watch me.
You didn't.

1252
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:14,808
You think Harry
said something he didn't. . .

1253
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:16,688
. . .that cupboards are empty
when they're full.

1254
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:20,479
Clinically, we would call that
evidence of a psychotic break.

1255
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:22,329
l am not crazy, Norman!

1256
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:25,121
You going to write me a prescription?

1257
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:29,363
And just get rid of me again?
lt's not that convenient down here!

1258
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:30,804
l am not psychotic!

1259
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:32,364
How about a mini-psychotic break?

1260
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:33,639
That's not fair.

1261
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:34,646
What?!

1262
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:38,968
l'm down there. l can't breathe.
l'm hyperventilating. The man saved me.

1263
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:40,485
Wait a minute!

1264
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:43,085
You want me to believe
that he set you up! Why?

1265
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,202
This isn't Alice ln Wonderland !

1266
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:47,241
Remember, ''just you and me, babe''?

1267
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:50,439
ls it unrealistic to think
that at this point. . .

1268
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:53,602
. . .you are a danger to yourself,
to all of us. . .

1269
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:58,088
. . .because of your anger toward me,
which happened 1 O or 1 5 years ago. . .

1270
01:28:58,330 --> 01:28:59,968
. . .which is so distorted
in your head!

1271
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:01,719
l was out there.

1272
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:03,602
You almost got me killed!

1273
01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:07,405
The man tried to save my life!
You now want me to disbelieve Harry?!

1274
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:10,722
Yes, l want you to disbelieve Harry!
l want you. . .

1275
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:13,530
. . .to look at me
and believe for one time.

1276
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,602
Look at me.
Am l telling you the truth?

1277
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:18,925
You weren't there.

1278
01:29:20,410 --> 01:29:24,244
You want to believe Harry,
then that's fine.

1279
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:28,086
Because he's done everything but part
the sea for you since we've been here.

1280
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:31,528
But l'm telling you. . .

1281
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:33,369
. . .that he is not. . .

1282
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:35,646
. . .telling you the truth.

1283
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:37,159
This is not about Harry.

1284
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:39,439
ls it?

1285
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:42,283
Who's this about?

1286
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:47,208
He didn't tell you what's
inside the Sphere, did he?

1287
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:51,800
You didn't tell him
what's inside the Sphere.

1288
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:55,120
And how would you know that?

1289
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:01,805
Did you go inside?

1290
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:08,240
Answer me.
Did you go inside the Sphere?

1291
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,362
Why won't you answer me?

1292
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:19,045
lt's a question.

1293
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,087
You don't want to talk to me.

1294
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:22,479
Remember?

1295
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:25,209
Answer a question.

1296
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:31,409
What do you think?

1297
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,966
You think she went in the Sphere?

1298
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:47,445
Here.

1299
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,448
You dropped your book.

1300
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:21,728
What isn't Harry telling me?

1301
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:24,685
l know you're there.
You're always there.

1302
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:28,367
What's inside the Sphere?

1303
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:31,999
Harry is reading this book. . .

1304
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:34,565
... Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea.

1305
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:37,804
What makes me nervous
is that after page. . .

1306
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:39,642
. . .87. . .

1307
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:46,161
. . .it's all blank pages.

1308
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:51,365
Why?

1309
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:55,646
Why did he go into the Sphere. . .

1310
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:00,767
. . .and come out like this?
Why?

1311
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,529
Why?
Why, Jerry?

1312
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:04,766
Why is this book half a book, Jerry?

1313
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:06,879
Why? Why?

1314
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:08,723
What's going on?

1315
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:16,478
He's got G equals one.

1316
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:18,483
That's right.

1317
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:22,043
He's got B equals two.

1318
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:25,639
He's got. . .

1319
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,806
. . .H equals three.

1320
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:29,998
That's not right.

1321
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:32,446
Harry's got the code wrong.

1322
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,885
H doesn't equal three.

1323
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:55,641
Harry not only makes it real
for himself, Beth.

1324
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:58,245
He makes it real for you.
He makes it real for me.

1325
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,765
He has made it real for everybody.

1326
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:05,089
lt's really frightening because you
don't know whether it's really real. . .

1327
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:09,687
. . .or whether he's made it real
for us to believe it's real.

1328
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:12,641
And it's because of the Sphere.

1329
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:17,727
Our Harry is Jerry?

1330
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:20,609
Come on, l'm just as tired
as you are.

1331
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:23,041
l know you can get this.
Okay?

1332
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:29,840
Harry said he couldn't get past page 87
because he said it was too scary.

1333
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:32,201
There's nothing on the pages.
Where's the rest?

1334
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:34,202
Read what's on page 87.

1335
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:37,680
''According to calculations
of some naturalists. . .

1336
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:42,082
. . .one of these animals, only 6 feet
long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.

1337
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,761
That would make a formidable monster. ''

1338
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:47,003
What does Harry hate?

1339
01:35:47,530 --> 01:35:48,883
Squid.

1340
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,206
And when he read that,
it scared him.

1341
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:53,363
Getting the picture?

1342
01:35:53,770 --> 01:35:55,408
Remember all those. . .

1343
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:57,322
. . .jellyfish that attacked?

1344
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:59,288
What was Harry doing then?

1345
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:00,680
Sleeping.

1346
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:02,323
He was dreaming.

1347
01:36:03,730 --> 01:36:06,164
And this is the really wild part:

1348
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:07,720
What he dreamed. . . .

1349
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:08,846
Happened?

1350
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:10,609
lt happened.

1351
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:13,565
You're telling me that. . .

1352
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:18,008
. . .because Harry went inside the Sphere,
he now has the power to manifest. . .

1353
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:20,889
. . .his dreams, his fantasies. . . .

1354
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:22,962
Manifest.
He manifested it.

1355
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,404
He made it happen.

1356
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:26,003
We better not piss him off.

1357
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:28,770
lt's not that different
from a child, right?

1358
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:32,526
A child imagines that
what it's imagining happens.

1359
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:33,839
But it doesn't.

1360
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:35,762
But with Harry, it does.

1361
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:39,320
ln fact, it's so real, it's not only
real to Harry, it's real to all of us.

1362
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:42,483
And what l can't understand is that
ever since he went in the Sphere. . .

1363
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:44,249
. . .the Sphere has a power. . .

1364
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:48,005
. . .that projects every subconscious
thought Harry has onto the computer.

1365
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:50,639
lt prints it out
and we interact with it.

1366
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:53,927
We thought it was Jerry.
lt's not Jerry. lt's Harry.

1367
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,399
Harry's Jerry.

1368
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:57,129
Does Harry know this?

1369
01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:59,930
But you went in the Sphere
and nothing happened.

1370
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,286
Obviously, l didn't go in the Sphere.

1371
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:06,648
You never went inside the Sphere?
You didn't go in there?

1372
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:10,085
l was so angry at you.

1373
01:37:11,290 --> 01:37:13,281
l wanted you to be scared.

1374
01:37:14,290 --> 01:37:15,643
Maybe you had a right to be.

1375
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:17,524
Thanks.

1376
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:20,402
You sure you didn't go in there?

1377
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:25,808
l don't know about you,
but l don't feel like dying down here.

1378
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:28,365
What we're going to do
is find something to put Harry under.

1379
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:31,602
We can put him in some
kind of deep unconscious sleep.

1380
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:33,203
Dreamless sleep, l hope.

1381
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:35,202
A dreamless sleep, yes.

1382
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:36,883
How do we do that?

1383
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:38,802
l got a bunch of drugs up there.

1384
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:40,719
Fancy that.

1385
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:42,449
-''Diphenylpyraline. ''
-Burns.

1386
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,965
-''Ephedrine hydrochloride. ''
-Motion sickness.

1387
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:46,723
''Valdomet''?

1388
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:49,404
-Ulcers. You might want to keep that.
-''Sintag. ''

1389
01:37:49,650 --> 01:37:52,926
Sintag is a synthetic opiate.
lt's a painkiller.

1390
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:54,569
l might want to keep that.

1391
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:57,165
-What about ''parasolutrine''?
-Really?

1392
01:37:57,410 --> 01:38:00,129
l got paracin trichloride.
That's an anesthetic.

1393
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:01,485
Do you combine it?

1394
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:04,369
You give about 2O cc's of this one,
6 of this one.

1395
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:05,486
You're in business.

1396
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:07,243
Here's some more paracin trichloride.

1397
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:10,243
Good. We'll knock him out
for about 3 to 6 hours.

1398
01:38:22,330 --> 01:38:24,127
l'm going to hold him.

1399
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:33,520
What's going on?

1400
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:34,964
Go back to sleep.

1401
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:42,969
l didn't know
it would be that fast-acting.

1402
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:45,729
We didn't kill him, did we?

1403
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:47,449
l don't think so.

1404
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:51,205
Okay.

1405
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:01,007
Come on, come on.

1406
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:07,285
Here we go.

1407
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:12,845
lt's a code.

1408
01:39:18,330 --> 01:39:20,127
How the hell are we supposed--

1409
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:21,849
lt's decoding itself.

1410
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:27,126
''Weather normal.
Surface support vessels return. ''

1411
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:29,964
6 hours and counting,
we're out of here.

1412
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:32,724
lt's over.

1413
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:40,082
lf you trust it.

1414
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:43,600
You know me,
l believe everything.

1415
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:02,165
Get out!

1416
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:03,884
Get off!

1417
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:29,648
They're Belcher sea snakes, Norman.

1418
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:31,528
The most poisonous snakes in the world.

1419
01:41:32,370 --> 01:41:34,759
But they're nocturnal.
They're only dangerous at night.

1420
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:48,604
Norman, can you meet me
at the lab, please?

1421
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:51,205
l have something
l need to show you.

1422
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,204
What are you doing?
l'm here.

1423
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:16,239
What are you doing?

1424
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:26,209
Why are you locking me in?

1425
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:39,562
You manifested the snakes.

1426
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:42,089
Norman, up here.

1427
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:45,482
You're the only one
who could be manifesting these snakes.

1428
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:49,439
Turn around.
Turn around and look on the table.

1429
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:55,361
-See the hypodermic needle?
-Yeah.

1430
01:42:55,650 --> 01:42:57,561
l want you to inject yourself.

1431
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:00,359
lt's the same thing. . .

1432
01:43:00,570 --> 01:43:02,003
. . .that we used to inject Harry.

1433
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:06,408
We gave Harry this stuff because
he was manifesting and we wanted to--

1434
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:09,045
You're manifesting your fears. . .

1435
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:10,645
. . .the jellyfish. . .

1436
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:12,369
. . .now the snakes.

1437
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:14,885
The squid thing was Harry,
but he's asleep.

1438
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:19,448
He's in a dreamless sleep. lt couldn't
be him. You are the only one left.

1439
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:23,559
What would the snakes have to do
with me? l didn't go in the Sphere.

1440
01:43:24,370 --> 01:43:25,598
See the jars?

1441
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:29,923
l put the snakes in there and they
disappeared in front of my eyes.

1442
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:32,400
Who's manifesting them, Norman?

1443
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:33,800
You are.

1444
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:35,603
l don 't have anything
to do with snakes.

1445
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:39,644
lf you don't use the hypodermic needle,
l'm going to have to defend myself.

1446
01:43:40,010 --> 01:43:41,728
l'd remember
if l went in the Sphere!

1447
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:44,728
Don't make me do this.
l don't want to do this.

1448
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:46,159
l didn 't manifest anything.

1449
01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:49,487
l didn 't manifest the squid.
l didn 't manifest the....

1450
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:51,322
l shouldn 't be
talking to you like this.

1451
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:55,929
Why are you taking the gas out
of the room? That's my air.

1452
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:08,481
What's with this water?!

1453
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:12,120
Think it through. Whose childhood fears
were the jellyfish?

1454
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:13,849
-Jellyfish?
-Remember, Norman?

1455
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:16,041
l'm not the only one
who's afraid of jellyfish.

1456
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,808
This wasn't exactly a jellyfish.

1457
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:19,443
Jellyfish like this are unheard of.

1458
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:20,969
Anybody can be. . .

1459
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:24,843
. . .afraid of jellyfish.
A lot of people are afraid of them.

1460
01:44:25,330 --> 01:44:28,766
lsn't it possible
that you went inside the Sphere. . .

1461
01:44:29,450 --> 01:44:31,168
. . .and you just don't remember?

1462
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:34,328
l didn't go inside the Sphere!
You would've seen it on the video!

1463
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:37,008
l didn't go inside the Sphere.

1464
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:38,046
Yes, you did.

1465
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:39,239
ls he alive?

1466
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:40,485
You went inside the Sphere...

1467
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:43,523
...and you just don 't remember.
That's the problem.

1468
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:49,641
lt's not me!
l'm not going to use it!

1469
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:52,279
lnject yourself
with the hypodermic needle.

1470
01:44:58,570 --> 01:45:00,049
lt's your snakes.
See?

1471
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,888
lt's all a fear.
lt's just a fear.

1472
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:05,242
You can make it go away.
Just use the hypodermic needle.

1473
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:08,528
And the ships will come
and we'll get out of here.

1474
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:12,524
What are you doing?!
You're going to kill me!

1475
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:17,679
You can stop it.

1476
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:21,282
Try to pull yourself together.

1477
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:24,526
Your fears are going to kill
all of us.

1478
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:40,121
Please, don't open the hatch.

1479
01:45:40,450 --> 01:45:42,759
You'll freeze to death in the water.

1480
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:49,683
You'll kill yourself!
Don't open the hatch!

1481
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:20,408
l know enough
not to get killed down here.

1482
01:46:20,610 --> 01:46:22,726
Are you the most qualified
in your field?

1483
01:46:22,930 --> 01:46:25,205
What exactly are your qualifications?
Why are you here?

1484
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:27,361
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

1485
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:31,842
Are you the most qualified?

1486
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:34,724
You almost got me killed.

1487
01:46:36,210 --> 01:46:37,438
You're a danger to all of us.

1488
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:40,402
Come back to reality.

1489
01:48:59,290 --> 01:49:00,769
What are you doing?

1490
01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:29,003
Are you real?

1491
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:37,363
As real as the water
that almost drowned me.

1492
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:42,322
You tried to kill me.

1493
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:47,923
What are you doing there?

1494
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:54,690
Beth, you went into the Sphere.

1495
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:59,365
Didn't you?

1496
01:50:22,170 --> 01:50:23,205
Answer me.

1497
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:26,601
l don't know what to think.
l feel like l can't breathe.

1498
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:29,646
l'm losing it, you know?

1499
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:33,283
l'm trying to keep it together, but. . . .

1500
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:35,809
What's going on?

1501
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:37,489
Why'd you put me out?

1502
01:50:38,610 --> 01:50:40,521
What are you guys up to?

1503
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:42,642
You went in the Sphere, Harry.

1504
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:44,284
So did Beth.

1505
01:50:44,730 --> 01:50:45,879
So did l.

1506
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:47,520
l think.

1507
01:50:48,090 --> 01:50:49,762
And if so, what?

1508
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:52,281
Everything that we feel or think. . .

1509
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:53,480
. . .just. . .

1510
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:54,799
. . .happens.

1511
01:50:55,050 --> 01:50:57,120
That's what happened
to the astronauts.

1512
01:50:57,330 --> 01:51:00,367
The astronaut in the chair,
what did you say about his head?

1513
01:51:00,890 --> 01:51:02,005
He had. . .

1514
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:05,084
. . .blunt force trauma.
He got hit in the head.

1515
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:07,168
They went into the Sphere one by one. . .

1516
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:10,402
. . .became afraid of each other,
till they killed each other off.

1517
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:12,800
And we're doing the same thing.

1518
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:15,408
l don't want to kill you.

1519
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:20,362
Your attention, please.

1520
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:23,761
All construction personnel
must exit the blast area...

1521
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:25,000
...immediately.

1522
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:28,003
Panther explosives
are now activated.

1523
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:30,718
Mark 13 minutes and counting.

1524
01:51:31,450 --> 01:51:33,168
Want to tell me who that voice is?

1525
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:37,679
They had explosives down here
to blow up the coral.

1526
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:42,606
So when l went out before, l set up a
defense perimeter around the spaceship.

1527
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:44,329
Something must have triggered it.

1528
01:51:45,530 --> 01:51:47,327
Something from inside the Sphere.

1529
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:51,284
-Nothing in the Sphere. You know that.
-Then what?

1530
01:51:51,810 --> 01:51:52,526
l don't know.

1531
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:55,365
Then who?

1532
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:00,998
lt's me.

1533
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:03,409
Oh, God.

1534
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:06,723
l was just thinking
about the explosives.

1535
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:10,167
lt just flashed inside my mind.
lt must've triggered them.

1536
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:18,041
l was thinking about wanting to die.

1537
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:21,566
You put explosives near the spacecraft?

1538
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:23,803
Yeah, l did.

1539
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:27,121
But they're about 1 OO yards away.

1540
01:52:27,770 --> 01:52:30,568
There's a lot of liquid hydrogen
left on that spacecraft.

1541
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:33,000
lf it explodes,
it'll disintegrate everything.

1542
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:37,721
Mini-sub, now!
Let's go!

1543
01:52:41,690 --> 01:52:43,726
l hope there's a ship up there.

1544
01:52:46,090 --> 01:52:47,239
Your attention, please.

1545
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:52,046
All construction personnel must exit
the blast area immediately.

1546
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:55,362
Panther explosives
are now activated.

1547
01:52:55,730 --> 01:52:57,766
Mark 1O minutes and counting.

1548
01:53:09,370 --> 01:53:10,644
Let's go! Let's go!

1549
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:12,439
Come on, come on!

1550
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:20,449
Come on, move!

1551
01:53:20,770 --> 01:53:21,725
Keep moving.

1552
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:24,208
We're not going to make it!

1553
01:53:28,090 --> 01:53:30,285
There's not enough time.

1554
01:53:30,530 --> 01:53:31,724
Just keep moving.

1555
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:35,082
We're not out of time. We're
not going to die here. Keep moving.

1556
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:49,968
Let's go, Norman.

1557
01:53:50,450 --> 01:53:52,441
lt's not like l drive subs, okay?

1558
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:53,879
You're driving one now.

1559
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:59,004
Oh, my God!

1560
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:00,878
What's going on?

1561
01:54:01,170 --> 01:54:02,080
l don't know.

1562
01:54:02,490 --> 01:54:03,889
Why are we inside the spaceship?

1563
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:05,125
l don't know.

1564
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:07,087
Let's go!

1565
01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:10,767
Now alert, alert.
5 minutes and counting.

1566
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:15,124
We're not moving.
Anybody hit the button?

1567
01:54:16,610 --> 01:54:17,360
What the hell?

1568
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:21,598
Wait a minute,
this was an elevator before, right?

1569
01:54:21,850 --> 01:54:23,920
Which one of us is doing this?

1570
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:25,000
Oh, God.

1571
01:54:25,490 --> 01:54:27,958
Alert, alert.
Panther explosives armed.

1572
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:30,007
Wait, wait.
We were here already!

1573
01:54:32,050 --> 01:54:34,006
How much time we got?!
Come on!

1574
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:35,520
lt's a dead end.

1575
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:37,163
Where are we?

1576
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:38,440
An illusion.

1577
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:40,203
Doesn't look like it.

1578
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:43,442
Beth, which way?
Harry, where do we go?

1579
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:45,488
Where?
Where's where, Norman?

1580
01:54:45,730 --> 01:54:47,322
Around that corner?

1581
01:54:47,650 --> 01:54:48,799
And what's there?

1582
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:52,406
Just another blind alley
in the maze of our minds. lllusion.

1583
01:54:52,730 --> 01:54:53,640
Maybe he's right.

1584
01:54:53,890 --> 01:54:55,687
We believe that,
we're dead.

1585
01:54:56,010 --> 01:54:57,682
Just go on. Leave me.

1586
01:54:58,010 --> 01:55:02,242
You're not going to die down here.
l'm not going to let you die. Come on.

1587
01:55:03,890 --> 01:55:05,528
l'm not going to die.

1588
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:09,842
You have to push the button.

1589
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:11,239
l can't see a button.

1590
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:12,559
l can't see the button.

1591
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:13,959
l can't see the button.

1592
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:15,563
lt's no use.

1593
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:17,329
We die down here.

1594
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:20,520
We're running out of time.
They all look the same.

1595
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:23,682
l don't know where we are
or what we're stuck in.

1596
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:26,922
Where we are is stuck in the illusion
that we can change the future.

1597
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:28,404
lt's a dead end.

1598
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:30,920
Just like l said all along:

1599
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:32,405
We die down here.

1600
01:55:32,650 --> 01:55:33,924
Maybe he's right.

1601
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:35,358
Maybe he's right.

1602
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:36,884
l'm not going to die.

1603
01:55:37,130 --> 01:55:38,119
Beth's not going to die.

1604
01:55:38,330 --> 01:55:39,763
And you're not going to die.

1605
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:41,483
Look, just leave me.

1606
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:45,684
We're not in the spacecraft!
We're in the mini-sub! This isn't real!

1607
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:47,966
This is your manifestation!
Let it go!

1608
01:55:48,170 --> 01:55:48,807
lt's a dead end.

1609
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:50,489
We're not going to die here.

1610
01:55:50,730 --> 01:55:51,560
lt's not our time.

1611
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:10,323
Thank God, we're out of here.

1612
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:11,963
Don't start celebrating yet.

1613
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:12,727
Why not?

1614
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:14,602
l don't think
we're going fast enough.

1615
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:15,760
For what?

1616
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:18,888
An underwater blast creates a suction.
lt'll suck us into it.

1617
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:21,206
That is, if the shock wave
doesn't kill us first.

1618
01:56:22,290 --> 01:56:25,521
Alert, alert.
Mark 2O seconds and counting.

1619
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:27,960
Panther explosives are now activated.

1620
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:35,408
64O feet.

1621
01:56:35,650 --> 01:56:36,321
63O.

1622
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:38,244
62O.

1623
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:47,086
61 O. You a religious man, Norman?

1624
01:56:47,330 --> 01:56:49,525
Atheist. But l'm flexible.

1625
01:57:18,250 --> 01:57:20,047
Pull up, Norman!
Pull up!

1626
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,164
Come on, pull up!

1627
01:57:53,050 --> 01:57:54,483
This is Escort 7.

1628
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:57,961
We have sighted OSSA mini-sub,
bearing 1O5.

1629
01:57:58,210 --> 01:57:59,165
Repeat. Bearing 1O5.

1630
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:03,290
Preparing to make contact
for decompression procedure.

1631
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:17,004
What's going on?

1632
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,729
More of nothing.

1633
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:26,123
l want to thank you for saving my life.

1634
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:29,685
lnteresting life to save.

1635
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:35,400
You get some sleep.

1636
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:38,687
l have no idea what to tell them
when they debrief us.

1637
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:51,203
My back is killing me.

1638
01:58:51,770 --> 01:58:55,809
Next time l have to remember to stretch
before l jettison from a mini-sub.

1639
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:10,490
We've been trapped in here
for about 3 days.

1640
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:14,120
They want an explanation. We ought
to figure out what we want to tell them.

1641
01:59:14,690 --> 01:59:17,488
Killer jellyfish, squid, sea snakes. . .

1642
01:59:17,730 --> 01:59:21,962
. . .and an alien being in the form
of a giant totemic golden ball? Please.

1643
01:59:23,010 --> 01:59:27,447
We destroyed $1 OO million worth
of equipment down there and people died.

1644
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:30,559
They want answers.
What do you guys want to tell them?

1645
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:33,359
Why aren't we dead?

1646
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,640
What?

1647
01:59:34,890 --> 01:59:35,640
You said. . .

1648
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:37,688
''The future can't be changed. ''

1649
01:59:38,490 --> 01:59:39,718
lt can't.

1650
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:43,400
But in the spaceship they called it
an Unknown Entry Event.

1651
01:59:44,130 --> 01:59:47,600
Like we never got here alive
to tell them about it.

1652
01:59:48,210 --> 01:59:52,806
You said we wouldn't survive. lf you
can't change the future, we'd be dead.

1653
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:55,402
We're alive.
We're not dead.

1654
01:59:57,490 --> 02:00:00,482
And in 2 minutes we'll be in a room
full of military guys.

1655
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:02,402
They know about the Sphere.

1656
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:06,563
We know Barnes got ahold of them
before we lost contact to the surface.

1657
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:07,845
What do you want to tell them?

1658
02:00:08,610 --> 02:00:10,840
Why bother?
The Sphere's destroyed.

1659
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:13,445
But we still have the power,
am l right?

1660
02:00:16,090 --> 02:00:19,048
l don't know if l trust them with it.
l don't know if l trust you.

1661
02:00:19,410 --> 02:00:23,403
l don't want to not be able to sleep,
afraid l'll wake up. . .

1662
02:00:23,650 --> 02:00:25,720
. . .having manifested
some nightmare. . .

1663
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:28,689
. . .and there's all kinds
of weird things in my apartment.

1664
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:30,199
That's a frightening thought.

1665
02:00:30,450 --> 02:00:31,644
No kidding.

1666
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:33,839
So. . .

1667
02:00:35,130 --> 02:00:36,848
. . .if we still have the power. . .

1668
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:39,722
. . .what do you want to do with it?

1669
02:00:45,010 --> 02:00:46,648
God knows what they'll do with it.

1670
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:51,119
Are you worried what will happen
if it falls into the wrong hands?

1671
02:00:51,450 --> 02:00:53,884
Yeah. Frankly, l don't know
what the wrong hands are.

1672
02:00:54,130 --> 02:00:56,644
Or what's worse:
the wrong hands or our hands.

1673
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:58,608
We are the wrong hands.

1674
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:00,603
We proved it.

1675
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:05,247
You know, the 3 of us are enlightened
people, we're intelligent. . .

1676
02:01:05,490 --> 02:01:07,560
. . .we even recycle
our cans and bottles.

1677
02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:11,684
But when we got our shot,
we manifested every mean. . .

1678
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:16,003
. . .distorting, vengeful,
paranoid thought you could think of.

1679
02:01:16,530 --> 02:01:17,645
We did.

1680
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:18,447
Right?

1681
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:20,722
You believe we still have the power.

1682
02:01:21,330 --> 02:01:23,924
Of course we still have it.

1683
02:01:24,730 --> 02:01:27,164
And that's the answer to the equation.

1684
02:01:27,770 --> 02:01:29,488
We can't change the future.

1685
02:01:29,730 --> 02:01:33,120
We're not dead.
But they don't know. Why?

1686
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:35,799
l'm not following you.

1687
02:01:36,610 --> 02:01:39,283
Because we have the power. . .

1688
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:41,169
. . .to forget.

1689
02:01:43,930 --> 02:01:45,204
To forget.

1690
02:01:45,810 --> 02:01:47,641
You want us to agree to forget?

1691
02:01:47,890 --> 02:01:50,688
Wait a minute, are we sure
that we want to do this?

1692
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:52,204
Yes.

1693
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:57,684
This is the greatest discovery
in the history of mankind.

1694
02:01:57,930 --> 02:02:00,285
We're just going to white it out
like it's a typing error?

1695
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:02,958
l'm sure.

1696
02:02:05,530 --> 02:02:06,929
What about you, Beth?

1697
02:02:07,770 --> 02:02:09,283
What's the matter, Norman?

1698
02:02:09,530 --> 02:02:11,521
lt's a little hard to let go of.

1699
02:02:11,770 --> 02:02:13,044
Something that could've been. . .

1700
02:02:14,010 --> 02:02:15,443
. . .this gift?

1701
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:18,120
The power to make your dreams
come true.

1702
02:02:18,650 --> 02:02:21,483
We're given the greatest gift
in the history of mankind.

1703
02:02:21,850 --> 02:02:23,408
We're given this magic ball.

1704
02:02:23,650 --> 02:02:24,639
And it says...

1705
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:29,042
''lmagine what you will
and you can have it. ''

1706
02:02:30,450 --> 02:02:33,726
That's an extraordinary gift,
but we're so primitive we. . . .

1707
02:02:35,730 --> 02:02:38,802
We manifested the worst in us,
because what we have inside us. . .

1708
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:43,202
. . .is what we have inside of us, instead
of the best of us. What does that say?

1709
02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:47,402
We weren't ready, Norman.

1710
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:51,283
We have what's called an imagination.

1711
02:02:53,370 --> 02:02:56,487
l mean, look what we're capable of.

1712
02:02:56,730 --> 02:02:57,845
We can. . . .

1713
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:05,003
We're not ready.

1714
02:03:10,690 --> 02:03:12,248
A long time ago. . .

1715
02:03:13,530 --> 02:03:15,441
. . .l did something very. . .

1716
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:18,568
. . .very inappropriate with you,
and l'm sorry.

1717
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:20,720
Okay?

1718
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:21,846
Okay.

1719
02:03:22,810 --> 02:03:26,769
l don't have any answers, Norman,
but these guys are coming so let's. . . .

1720
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:30,128
Okay, we're going to agree to forget. . .

1721
02:03:30,930 --> 02:03:32,045
. . .the Sphere. . .

1722
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:33,879
. . .the power. . .

1723
02:03:34,650 --> 02:03:36,083
. . .all that ever was.

1724
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:45,407
l don't know how to get this going.
You're the mathematician.

1725
02:03:45,730 --> 02:03:47,209
How about we just count to 3?

1726
02:03:47,610 --> 02:03:49,328
l couldn't have come up with that.

1727
02:03:52,530 --> 02:03:53,849
l'll start.

1728
02:03:57,370 --> 02:03:58,007
One.

1729
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:05,965
Two.

1730
02:04:08,890 --> 02:04:10,118
Three.

1731
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:22,242
Can somebody tell me
what the hell that's supposed to be?

1732
02:04:31,410 --> 02:04:32,843
Why are you holding my hand?

1733
02:04:33,090 --> 02:04:35,365
No, you were holding my hand.

1734
02:08:26,010 --> 02:08:28,001
