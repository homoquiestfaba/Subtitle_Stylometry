IS HAS TO BE HERE.

1742
01:18:58,784 --> 01:19:00,150
DON'T DENY IT.

1743
01:19:00,185 --> 01:19:04,471
GRANT, DARLING,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1744
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,173
I THINK YOU JUST NEED
TO TAKE A LITTLE REST.

1745
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:08,108
NO. TELL THEM!

1746
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:09,743
YOU TELL THEM
WHAT'S UP THERE.

1747
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:16,400
IT'S SANTA'S VALLEY.

1748
01:19:16,435 --> 01:19:17,968
THE WORKSHOP,
THE REINDEER, THE ELVES.

1749
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,069
IT'S ALL THERE.

1750
01:19:19,104 --> 01:19:20,404
THIS IS THE REAL SANTA.

1751
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:22,873
THIS IS THE REAL SANTA.

1752
01:19:22,908 --> 01:19:24,157
I HAVE PICTURES.

1753
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:27,127
YOU CAN SEE IT ALL.

1754
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:29,529
GO ON. TELL THEM.

1755
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:33,467
HONEY, THIS IS
THE PETTING ZOO.

1756
01:19:33,503 --> 01:19:36,653
PLEASE UNDERSTAND.
GRANT IS REALLY TRYING TO HELP.

1757
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,088
I JUST THINK HE MIGHT NEED
A LITTLE...TIME OFF.

1758
01:19:38,123 --> 01:19:42,859
GRANT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEANT BY
THIS PRACTICAL JOKE,

1759
01:19:42,895 --> 01:19:46,614
BUT YOU HAVE PULLED US
ALL AWAY FROM OUR
FAMILIES ON CHRISTMAS EVE

1760
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:49,983
TO PITCH US THIS
RIDICULOUS PROJECT.

1761
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:54,021
NOW, I THINK THAT YOU
OUGHT TO RECONSIDER YOUR
POSITION IN THE COMPANY.

1762
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:56,807
BECAUSE I KNOW I WILL.

1763
01:19:58,678 --> 01:20:00,877
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I AM SORRY.

1764
01:20:00,913 --> 01:20:02,412
I APOLOGIZE.

1765
01:20:02,447 --> 01:20:05,231
MY REGARDS
TO YOUR FAMILIES.

1766
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,167
AND WE WILL
SEE EACH OTHER...

1767
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:09,636
AFTER THE HOLIDAYS.

1768
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:10,370
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS PERFECT.

1769
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:12,072
OKAY, DON'T YOU SEE?

1770
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,774
THERE'S A MONORAIL,

1771
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,475
AND IT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH
THE WORKSHOP.

1772
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,494
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S A BAD IDEA.

1773
01:20:17,529 --> 01:20:19,196
THERE'S NO MONORAIL.
THANK YOU, HOLLY.

1774
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,530
NO, GUYS, HEY, THIS IS--

1775
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,432
COME ON,
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.
OKAY.

1776
01:20:22,467 --> 01:20:23,917
THIS IS--THIS IS
A PRELIM, DRAFT 1.

1777
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:26,619
HEY, WE'RE STILL ON FOR
RACQUETBALL FRIDAY, RIGHT?

1778
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,955
YOU AND ME, BUDDY,
WE GOT IT, WE'LL DO IT.

1779
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,690
HEY, UH...

1780
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:33,593
I'LL STAY HERE.
YOU GUYS GO ON.

1781

GET OUT OF HERE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS. GO--

1782
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:38,381
MR. HAMILTON,
DO ME A FAVOR

1783
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,784
AND DON'T BE TOO HARD
ON GRANT.

1784
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:44,471
UH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
MS. CLASS.

1785
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,139
IT IS THE SEASON
OF FORGIVENESS.

1791
01:20:58,837 --> 01:21:01,438
THANKS.

1792
01:21:01,473 --> 01:21:03,573
FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING.

1793
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,426
IS THERE ANYTHING
I COULD DO FOR YOU?

1794
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:09,730
YES. THERE IS ONE THING.

1795
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:19,923
I WAS HOPING
TO HAVE IT REPAIRED
FOR MY GRANDSON.

1796
01:21:22,394 --> 01:21:23,460
I THINK I KNOW SOMEONE

1797
01:21:23,495 --> 01:21:25,946
WHO MAY BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU OUT.

1798
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:26,813
EXCELLENT.

1799
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,083
EXCUSE ME. I...

1800
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:32,019
HAVE TO GET HOME.

1801
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:38,008
AND I'M SURE
THAT YOU HAVE THINGS
TO DO YOURSELF.

1802
01:21:39,445 --> 01:21:42,546
ACTUALLY, I DO.

1803
01:21:42,581 --> 01:21:44,831
TAKE CARE, MS. CLASS.

1804
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:47,867
YOU, TOO.

1805
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,969

01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,452
I THINK
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

1810
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:07,154
WELL, THERE'S JUST
ONE MORE THING.

1811
01:22:09,825 --> 01:22:11,792
I NEVER GOT WHAT I
WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS.

1812
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:31,377
WOW.

1813
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:33,780
I'M REALLY GONNA DO THIS.

FOR ME?

KIND OF ON THE FENCE
