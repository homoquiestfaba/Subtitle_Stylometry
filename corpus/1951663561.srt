1
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:20,940
<i>Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to be clever.</i>

2
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:25,110
<i>Some people are born clever the same
way some people are born beautiful.</i>

3
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,947
<i>I'm not one of those people.
I've had to work at it.</i>

4
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:32,742
<i>If there's a question, I
have to know the right answer.</i>

5
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:36,246
<i>Crystalline or glassy in appearance, which
of the three principal classes of rock</i>

6
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,248
<i>is formed by the cooling
of molten earth material?</i>

7
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,541
What do you reckon, Brian?

8
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,335
Volcanic.

9
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:42,919
<i>- Is it igneous?
- Igneous is correct.</i>

10
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,839
That was nearly right.

11
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,217
<i>Derived from the Greek
words for wing and finger,</i>

12
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,721
<i>what name is given to a flying lizard
of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods?</i>

13
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,930
Pterodactyl.

14
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,849
<i>- Cronin, Oxford.
- Is it a Pterodactyl?</i>

15
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,809
<i>- Pterodactyl is correct.
- Yes!</i>

16
00:01:58,227 --> 00:01:59,937
Clever little thing, aren't you?

17
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,526
<i>As Francis Bacon once
said, knowledge is power.</i>

18
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,738
<i>Which is why I want to know everything.</i>

19
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,618
<i>I want to know about Plato and
Newton, Tolstoy and Bob Dylan.</i>

20
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:17,538
<i>What the words "dialectic"
and "peripatetic" mean.</i>

21
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,541
<i>I want to know why
people actually like jazz.</i>

22
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,418
<i>If I'm going to find the answers,</i>

23
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:26,630
<i>I need to be in a place where
people have a passion for knowledge,</i>

24
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,842
<i>think it's important. Sacred, even.</i>

25
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:34,512
That's why I hope you'll accept
my application to this university.

26
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:45,523
So, was that the correct answer?

27
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:51,822
Well, it's not really a question of correct
or incorrect, but it's certainly been...

28
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:54,241
entertaining.

29
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,622
I think that's everything, Brian.

30
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:06,837
Thank you.

31
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,220
We'll see you in October, Mr Jackson.

32
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,723
Yes!

33
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,309
<i>So this is it. I made it.</i>

34
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:23,312
<i>Of course, there are going
to be some pretty big changes.</i>

35
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:27,315
<i>Leaving home, moving to a new city
away from people I've known all my life</i>

36
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,110
<i>and friends who've always supported me.</i>

37
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,320
You're not gonna turn
into a wanker, are you?

38
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,614
What?

39
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,616
I mean, you're not gonna get all
poncey, start saying, "One does"

40
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:38,118
and wearing a cloak and talking Latin.

41
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:40,537
Yes, Tone. That's exactly
what's gonna happen.

42
00:03:41,747 --> 00:03:43,415
- Let's get out of here.
- All right.

43
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:57,429
Oi, slow down.

44
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:08,815
Why do we always have to listen to this?

45
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,026
- Because...
- Because what?

46
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:13,236
- 'Cause it's Motörhead.
- And?

47
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:15,030
And the Head rule.

48
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,614
Because you say so?

49
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,533
'Cause it's my ghetto blaster.

50
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:21,244
- Which ghetto is that, then, Tone?
- It's Westcliff on Sea.

51
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,412
Yeah, good one, Bri.

52
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:25,123
Tell you what, why don't you
stick on a bit of Kate Bush, yeah?

53
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:27,334
We'll have a really good dance,
listening to Kate Bush, yeah?

54
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,712
We'll have a really good time, we'll listen
to Kate Bush, have a great dance, yeah?

55
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:33,423
Bloody hell, Spencer!

56
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,227
I did this for you.

57
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:49,439
Trick your new mates into
thinking you got some taste.

58
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,734
Cheers, Spence. That's amazing.

59
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:56,238
It's only a tape, bro. There's
no need to get all gay about it.

60
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:59,449
So, you think you will
retake your exams or...

61
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,117
- Oh, don't start.
- Start what?

62
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:03,036
The careers guidance.

63
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,830
- I think it's a waste, that's all.
- Fuck off, it's waste.

64
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:08,250
Sitting on your arse for three
years reading poems, that's a waste.

65
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:10,336
It's not just about that.

66
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:12,212
It's about life experience.

67
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:15,049
Expanding your mind, grappling
with the big questions.

68
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:18,218
- Making exciting new friends.
- As opposed to boring old ones?

69
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:23,140
- I didn't say that, did I?
- I'm fine as I am, thanks, Brian.

70
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:27,519
Besides, there's always Tone to
debate the weighty issues of the day.

71
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,938
Never get that again. Thanks, mate.

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,233
- Best tape I ever made...
- Let's get him.

73
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,944
...in the sea. What?

74
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:38,238
No. Hang on. What...

75
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:40,615
- Let's get him!
- Right!

76
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,117
That's it!

77
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,244
Spencer! Take it easy.

78
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:10,228
- Is that what you're wearing?
- You don't mind, do you?

79
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,314
No. No, no, of course not.

80
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:15,025
No, it's very smart.

81
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:19,321
- Now, bread, do you need bread?
- I'll get bread there.

82
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:22,032
- Chip pan?
- I'll miss the train, Mum.

83
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,909
- Don't drink too much.
- I won't if you won't.

84
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:25,745
And don't be cheeky.

85
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:28,830
Now, you sure you don't want
me to walk you to the station?

86
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,916
Mum, I'm all right. Honestly.

87
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:33,627
- Here, take this.
- No.

88
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,422
- No, you can't afford it, Mum.
- Just take it.

89
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:39,841
Try to eat a piece of fresh
fruit every now and then.

90
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:44,930
He'd have been so proud of you.

91
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,734
Yes!

92
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,612
Take that!

93
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:30,536
Hi there. I'm your
housemate, Brian Jackson.

94
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:32,830
Hello, Brian Jackson.

95
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:35,041
- I'm Josh, this is Marcus.
- Hello.

96
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,334
Hello.

97
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,129
Want me to show you to your quarters?

98
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:41,839
Yeah.

99
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:48,720
Hope you don't mind but
we allocated the rooms.

100
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:52,641
- Bit small, isn't it?
- Yes.

101
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:54,143
Yes, it is.

102
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,021
Well, we'll leave you to get
ready for the party, then.

103
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:58,230
Party?

104
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:00,023
Tarts and vicars.

105
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,026
You are coming?

106
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:04,319
Oh, actually.

107
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:08,240
I think I'm gonna stay here.

108
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,243
Unpack and do some reading.

109
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:27,509
Right. I'll purchase
the alcoholic beverages.

110
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,720
You got any money, Barry?

111
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:33,640
Any cash? It's just, I
don't have any pockets.

112
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:36,810
Okay.

113
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,314
- Cheers,
squire. - Ta-ta.

114
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,331
- I just got back from India.
- Oh, right.

115
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,416
Amazing experience.

116
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:03,337
Transformed me in ways I
never could have imagined.

117
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:05,422
Such as?

118
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:07,341
Do you use toilet paper?

119
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:09,135
Well, now and then.

120
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:12,512
Not cool, you know.

121
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:14,848
Terrible for the environment.

122
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,225
So...

123
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,938
how do you... you know?

124
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:23,024
I use my hand,

125
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:25,317
and a bucket of water.

126
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:27,445
You should try it sometime.

127
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,446
Sorry, I've just seen somebody I know.

128
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,822
All right.

129
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:34,243
Hi. Do you mind if I
pretend to know you.

130
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:36,537
Has he been asking
you about toilet paper?

131
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:38,831
It's uncool, apparently.

132
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:41,417
Yeah, well, so is gastroenteritis.

133
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,048
The ironic thing is,
I actually am a vicar.

134
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,928
So what'd you come as?

135
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:54,847
A normal person.

136
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:56,432
You could at least have come as a vicar.

137
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:58,642
- Except I'm Jewish.
- Really?

138
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,019
Wow. I've never met a Jew before.

139
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:02,729
Not properly, anyway.

140
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:05,650
Which is strange, really, because
loads of my heroes are Jewish.

141
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,610
Woody Allen, Marx,
Einstein, Dustin Hoffman.

142
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:11,113
- Jesus.
- Jesus, Freud, Kubrick.

143
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:14,450
Yeah. God, there certainly
have been some amazing Jews.

144
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:16,619
My people thank you.

145
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:23,417
- Here you go, squire.
- Don't waste any time, do you, Barry?

146
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:24,919
Nice work, Barry.

147
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:26,712
Was there any change?

148
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,047
Sorry.

149
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:33,135
Well, nice talking to you, Barry.

150
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:35,137
Actually, it's Brian.

151
00:11:36,222 --> 00:11:39,141
- But he just called you Barry.
- Yeah, he did.

152
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,435
What, you didn't correct him?

153
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:43,937
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

154
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:46,024
Rebecca. Rebecca Epstein.

155
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:48,150
Rebecca Epstein.

156
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:50,444
That's a Jewish name, isn't it?

157
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,530
<i>Shalom, Brian.</i>

158
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,323
Right, absolutely.

159
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:14,236
Bring it on!

160
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:44,016
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:49,021
Oh, excuse me. What's the hurry?

162
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,233
- Rebecca.
- Right.

163
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,609
Come to our demonstration.

164
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,236
Can't stop. I've got
an important meeting.

165
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,822
Oh, right. More important than
the struggle against apartheid?

166
00:13:57,947 --> 00:14:01,241
Listen, I'm really, really interested
in this. It's just that I'm late.

167
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:02,618
Yeah, I know.

168
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:04,912
Contemporary Jewish studies.

169
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,417
Oh, sorry.

170
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,213
Halt.

171
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,841
- Hi, I'm here for the...
- Fingers on buzzers, first question.

172
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:18,342
- What's that in your hand?
- It's a poster.

173
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:20,219
And why is it in your hand
rather than on the wall

174
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,721
where everyone can see it?

175
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:24,348
Never mind. Fill this in, will you?

176
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:26,517
- Anyone else waiting out there?
- I don't think so. No.

177
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:28,144
Really? Bugger.

178
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,439
- Subject?
- English literature.

179
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:34,441
But I'm pretty good on sciences.

180
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,318
Newton's Third Law of Motion?

181
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:39,238
Reaction is equal and
opposite to action.

182
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:43,451
Take a seat, please.

183
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,038
Anywhere?

184
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:54,837
Right. Let's get started then, shall we?

185
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:56,839
I'm sorry there aren't more of us.

186
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:59,926
It seems that vandals have
been tearing down the posters.

187
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,345
I'm Patrick Watts
from Ashton-under-Lyne.

188
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:05,347
I'm reading mechanical engineering.

189
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:08,809
Some of you may recognise me
from last year's TV tournament.

190
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,148
Once again I'll be
captaining this year's team.

191
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:15,650
- Why?
- Sorry?

192
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,819
If we lost last year, why
are you still the captain?

193
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:22,949
Well, because I'm a post-grad and I've
been captain for the last three years.

194
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:24,450
Yeah, we've lost for
the last three years.

195
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:27,036
Look, let's just crack on, shall we?

196
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,750
In order to qualify, you'll need to
answer 30 questions in 30 minutes.

197
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:36,838
And the top three scores join me,
the captain, in this year's team.

198
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:39,424
I have some lively
little questions in there,

199
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:41,551
so I think you're in
for a pretty good time.

200
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:44,428
But it is against the clock.
So, people, if you're ready.

201
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:47,014
Let's quiz!

202
00:15:58,443 --> 00:15:59,444
Hi.

203
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:04,240
- Sorry, I'm late.
- That's fine.

204
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:10,830
- Can I borrow this?
- Of course you can.

205
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:12,248
Thank you.

206
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:39,734
<i>Okay, concentrate. Question six.</i>

207
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,111
<i>Question six is...</i>

208
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:44,822
<i>Why's she smiling at me?</i>

209
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:47,241
<i>That's not question six. Concentrate.</i>

210
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:48,910
<i>Must concentrate.</i>

211
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:51,830
<i>Look at the paper. Look at the paper.</i>

212
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:53,623
<i>Don't look at her.</i>

213
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:56,042
<i>Don't look at her legs,</i>

214
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,712
<i>or the curve of her neck.</i>

215
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:02,924
<i>Just concentrate. Right. Question sex...</i>

216
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,842
<i>Six. Six.</i>

217
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:25,947
<i>Hey, handsome.</i>

218
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:29,950
<i>Would you mind giving me the
answers to three and five?</i>

219
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,036
<i>Thanks.</i>

220
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:35,414
<i>Cheating.</i>

221
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:38,334
<i>She wants me to cheat. I can't do that.</i>

222
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:44,423
<i>With pleasure. Three is
potassium permanganate,</i>

223
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:47,134
<i>and five is Papua New Guinea.</i>

224
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:34,641
Support our nurses. Support our nurses.

225
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:40,437
Brian, can I help you? I'm
here for the team meeting.

226
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:43,816
- Alice. Hello. Come in.
- Hi.

227
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:46,820
Brian, you're not on the
team. Alice here beat you.

228
00:18:46,945 --> 00:18:49,948
- Only by one point.
- Well, even so, Brian's still the loser.

229
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:52,324
Well, loser's a strong word.

230
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,410
He is first reserve.

231
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,830
Shoes off, please. Follow me.

232
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,625
Brian, I am so sorry.

233
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:03,210
If you hadn't given me those
answers, you'd have been on the team.

234
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:05,338
Alice, it's no big deal.

235
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:07,423
- Really?
- Yeah.

236
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:09,717
All right, but I owe you.

237
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:22,438
<i>Watts, Bristol.</i>

238
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:26,150
<i>Sorry, going to have to hurry you.</i>

239
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:29,028
<i>Is it...</i>

240
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:31,447
<i>Schubert, Death and
the Maiden. Schubert!</i>

241
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:35,035
<i>Tchaikovsky?</i>

242
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:37,120
<i>No, I'm afraid that's not
the correct answer. Anyone?</i>

243
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:39,413
<i>- Salmon, Queens.
- Schubert, Death and the Maiden.</i>

244
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,541
<i>Is correct. That's
the sound of the gong.</i>

245
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,919
<i>The winners of this year's grand
final are Queens' College, Cambridge.</i>

246
00:19:56,723 --> 00:20:00,143
Obviously, I take no pleasure
in showing that to you.

247
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:03,730
But, as someone once
wrote, "To err is human."

248
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:04,814
Anyone?

249
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,025
<i>Alexander Pope's Essay On Man?</i>

250
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,527
And, you know, I really
feel that with dedication

251
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:12,614
and good old-fashioned teamwork,
that this could be our year.

252
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:16,743
Which is why we're all assembled here
today. The Fantastic Four, if you will.

253
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,038
Each with his or her own special powers.

254
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:21,914
Colin, history, politics.

255
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,042
Lucy, science, medicine.

256
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,335
Alice, art and literature.

257
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,048
And myself as a sort of
floating Renaissance man.

258
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:34,010
Brian! Coaster, please.

259
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:38,931
Now, the qualifying heats
are in two weeks' time.

260
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:40,016
It's untelevised, of course,

261
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:44,728
but we'll still need to be in good form
if we're to show them what we can do.

262
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:46,022
- Brian.
- Shall I come along to that?

263
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:48,023
- That won't be necessary.
- He is first reserve.

264
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:51,026
- And I'd be more than happy.
- Team members only, Brian.

265
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:53,821
I'm sure we can manage without you.

266
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:57,617
I'm so sorry.

267
00:20:57,742 --> 00:20:59,618
Now, quantum mechanics, anyone?

268
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:05,624
<i>Dear Spencer, just a quick note to
let you know how things are going here.</i>

269
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,545
<i>My housemates are really interesting.</i>

270
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:11,714
<i>It's great to meet people
from different backgrounds,</i>

271
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,925
<i>and we are all having
a really good laugh.</i>

272
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:19,221
I'm so sorry.

273
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:22,016
<i>I've also become increasingly
politically active,</i>

274
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:25,937
<i>and have so far protested against
apartheid, nuclear weapons, nuclear power,</i>

275
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:29,149
<i>gay bashing and sexual
exploitation of women.</i>

276
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:33,236
...rather than mere objects for
the sexual entertainment of men.

277
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,447
<i>Did you know that,
under the bastard Tories,</i>

278
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:41,035
<i>seven percent of the country
currently own 84% of the wealth?</i>

279
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:44,247
<i>It's the same old story.
The rich get richer,</i>

280
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:46,750
<i>and the most vulnerable
in our country suffer.</i>

281
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:50,211
<i>Anyway, how are you?
How's the job hunt going?</i>

282
00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:53,715
<i>Got anything more permanent,
or are you still signing on?</i>

283
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,218
<i>I know there's not much out there at
the moment, thanks to bloody Thatcher.</i>

284
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:59,429
<i>But I'm sure something
will come up soon.</i>

285
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:01,723
Hey! Piss off out of here.

286
00:22:01,848 --> 00:22:03,724
<i>Must sign off now,
as I've got a lecture.</i>

287
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,018
<i>I'm currently wrestling
with the Romantic poets.</i>

288
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:09,313
<i>Not literally, of course, as they
have been dead for some time now.</i>

289
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:14,820
What do the so-called Romantic
Poets mean by the term "Romance"?

290
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:16,946
It's certainly not hearts and flowers,

291
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,824
though an appreciation of extreme beauty

292
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:21,617
was a vital source of inspiration.

293
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:28,124
But the notion of the Romantic poets
as swooning lovelorn fops is a fallacy.

294
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:33,046
Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley in
particular, were all passionately...

295
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:34,338
Come on!

296
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:39,427
- Shouldn't you be at the qualifiers?
- That's the thing.

297
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:41,221
Colin's been knocked over by a bus.

298
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:43,723
He's okay, but it means
you're on the team.

299
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,016
Yes!

300
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:49,020
So glad that he's okay.

301
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:54,317
Fifty questions, 30 minutes.
Conferring is allowed.

302
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:59,822
And to make the grade, we need
a score of 70 percent or higher.

303
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:03,909
Excuse me, but we're trying to do a
quiz here and it's against the clock.

304
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:06,037
It's got to be done sometime.

305
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:09,415
<i>This man has been sent from the
offices of University Challenge!</i>

306
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,424
So, if we're ready.

307
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:22,512
Sergeant Troy, Fanny Robin
and Bathsheba Everdene

308
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:24,847
all appear in which
novel by Thomas Hardy?

309
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:26,432
<i>- Return Of The Native.
- Return Of The Native.</i>

310
00:23:26,516 --> 00:23:28,643
<i>Actually I think it might be
Far From The Madding Crowd.</i>

311
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:31,228
<i>- Oh, of course it is. Go with Brian.
- Far From The Madding Crowd.</i>

312
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:32,314
Correct!

313
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:36,025
Passer Domesticus is the scientific
name for which commonly known bird?

314
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,736
- The common house sparrow.
- Correct.

315
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,445
- Inflammation of the pancreas.
- Correct.

316
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:41,322
- The Sistine Chapel.
- Is the correct answer.

317
00:23:41,448 --> 00:23:42,532
- The rings of Saturn.
- Correct.

318
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:43,950
- The 38th parallel.
- Correct.

319
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:45,827
- They carry their young in pouches.
- Correct.

320
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:47,037
"My love is like a red, red rose."

321
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,246
1664!

322
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,123
- Prime numbers. Diaghilev. The spleen.
- Correct.

323
00:23:50,248 --> 00:23:52,416
The Berlin Airlift. Trick question.

324
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,835
Gamma rays. Longshore
drift. The Venus de Milo.

325
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:55,920
Correct.

326
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:58,048
And your final question.

327
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:00,925
Which decade saw the invention
of the replaceable razor,

328
00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:03,136
the formation of the Ford Motor Company,

329
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,930
and the death of Oscar Wilde?

330
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:06,222
- The 1890s.
- 1900s

331
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:09,017
- 1890s.
- I'm pretty sure it's the 1900s.

332
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:12,145
I am going to have to hurry you.

333
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:13,730
Lucy, what do you think?

334
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:16,650
Actually, I think Brian's right.

335
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:22,613
Is the answer the 1900s?

336
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:24,032
Correct.

337
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:29,537
Right. Well, then.
Congratulations, team.

338
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,250
Brian, glad to have you on board.

339
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:38,130
- You were great.
- Thanks.

340
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:39,547
Bye.

341
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:41,549
Brian.

342
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:45,011
I've never seen anything like it.

343
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:48,723
You're a general knowledge God.

344
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,518
<i>So what made you wanna
take the Challenge anyway?</i>

345
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:53,019
<i>The Challenge!</i>

346
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:57,023
Well, I want to be an actress,
or a TV presenter, or something.

347
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:59,817
- It's all experience, isn't it?
- Yeah.

348
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,737
How about you? How come
you know all that stuff?

349
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:04,030
Misspent youth?

350
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:08,910
And I suppose I've always just
liked that feeling of knowing things.

351
00:25:09,036 --> 00:25:10,746
For some reason it all
goes in and stays there.

352
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:12,914
And it's just useless knowledge.

353
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,625
You think there's such a
thing as useless knowledge?

354
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:18,920
Well, sometimes. I wish I
hadn't learned to crochet.

355
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:21,631
You are joking, aren't you?

356
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:25,135
Oi, watch it.

357
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:28,638
Hey!

358
00:25:29,514 --> 00:25:32,517
Better not. There might
be dog poo in there.

359
00:25:33,644 --> 00:25:35,145
Right.

360
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:37,647
Oh, God, I just
remembered! Mask workshop.

361
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:40,817
I've gotta run. See you
at the next rehearsal.

362
00:25:42,736 --> 00:25:45,447
Alice, what are you doing on Friday?

363
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:48,450
It's just, it's my birthday.

364
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,410
You're having a party.
Well, of course I'll come.

365
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:54,121
Not a party, exactly. I was,
I was thinking more dinner.

366
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,541
Or something...

367
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,710
Just me and you?

368
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:01,921
Mmm-hmm.

369
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:06,134
Brian, I'd love to.

370
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:08,219
Is the correct answer.

371
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:13,349
Okay. Friday.

372
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:54,349
Something wrong?

373
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:58,311
No. No, I just think you could've
put in a bit more effort, that's all.

374
00:27:01,648 --> 00:27:03,524
So, where are you taking me?

375
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:16,037
It's a good job I reserved a table.

376
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:18,040
- This is great.
- Are you sure?

377
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:20,917
It looked posher from outside,
with all the candles and everything.

378
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:24,212
But I love pizza. And
they do one with chips on.

379
00:27:25,714 --> 00:27:27,340
"King Edward."

380
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:34,222
Hello. Hi. Excuse me.

381
00:27:39,144 --> 00:27:42,522
The Lambrusco Bianco,

382
00:27:43,816 --> 00:27:45,442
could you tell me what year it is?

383
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:46,651
1985.

384
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:52,324
No, I know. I know what year it
is. I meant what year is the wine?

385
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:53,533
1985.

386
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:56,119
Very well.

387
00:27:56,829 --> 00:28:00,040
We'll have the white
Lambrusco Bianco '85, please.

388
00:28:04,837 --> 00:28:07,714
Look! Breadsticks. Hooray!

389
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:28,609
You know, I think I'm going
to have these garlic mushrooms.

390
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:31,446
Well, you won't be
snogging anyone tonight.

391
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:39,413
So, have you had many boyfriends, or...

392
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:43,124
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know. I'm just curious.

393
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,835
What, you really want to know? Okay.

394
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:50,340
When I was 15, there was Charlie,

395
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:53,343
who was the lead singer in this band.

396
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,429
He was incredibly handsome.

397
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:58,348
Gorgeous.

398
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:01,643
I left him for Rufus. We
then had a nine-month affair.

399
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:03,645
I then went out with his best friend.

400
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:06,815
And then I had a fling with a
lovely Italian guy called Alessandro.

401
00:29:07,816 --> 00:29:09,651
He was, like, skinny
because he was younger,

402
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,820
but he had, like,
muscles and definition.

403
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:16,032
Gregor was lovely, but
incredibly possessive.

404
00:29:17,034 --> 00:29:21,038
In the end we had to call the
police and I think he was deported.

405
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,624
And I think that that's about it.

406
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:30,839
Funny, isn't it, how many of them
end up being mad, or suicidal?

407
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:33,842
- Or in prison.
- I know.

408
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:37,429
Rufus, you know the performance
artist, the one who set fire to himself?

409
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:41,350
He used to say I had the kiss of death.

410
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:45,812
That's why I'm giving it all
up. Concentrate on my work.

411
00:29:46,814 --> 00:29:49,024
Get me to a nunnery.

412
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,736
- Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 1.
- You never stop, do you?

413
00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:55,447
What do your parents do again?

414
00:29:57,032 --> 00:29:59,743
Mum works in a shoe shop and Dad's dead.

415
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:04,915
It's all right. You don't need to get
all serious. It was a long time ago.

416
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,541
What happened?

417
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,044
Well, he was a salesman. Double glazing.

418
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:13,048
You know, working on commission.
Long, long hours. He hated it.

419
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:18,136
Anyway, it must've been eating away at him
because one day he just fell over, apparently.

420
00:30:18,637 --> 00:30:22,432
In this old couple's living room,
selling polyurethane windows.

421
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,727
Forty-one years old. Let's, uh...

422
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:30,148
Let's get another drink. Excuse me.

423
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:33,443
- Do you think about him?
- Yeah, of course. Every day.

424
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,449
But we never really got to know
one another. Not as adults, anyway.

425
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,244
I really only remember sitting
in front of the telly with him.

426
00:30:42,328 --> 00:30:44,121
Quizzes. He loved quizzes.

427
00:30:44,246 --> 00:30:46,623
Nature programmes, anything educational.

428
00:30:46,749 --> 00:30:48,041
Knowledge.

429
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,919
That was the key, he
said, to being happy.

430
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:54,048
Not ending up doing some job you hate.

431
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:58,844
Where's that waiter?

432
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:01,638
- He'd have loved you.
- You think so?

433
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:05,142
Of course. Don't you?

434
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:07,519
Don't know.

435
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:11,523
I think he might've thought I
was a bit weird, to be honest.

436
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:14,318
- Oh, he'd have been very proud of you.
- Why?

437
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:18,739
Going to university.
Star of the quiz team.

438
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,245
- Doing all the things he never got to do.
- Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

439
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,248
Anyway, Alice, excuse me,

440
00:31:28,332 --> 00:31:31,126
do you mind if I just
pop off to the loo?

441
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:37,215
You are such a lovely man.

442
00:31:47,726 --> 00:31:49,644
I'm sorry about tonight.

443
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:53,022
I don't usually cry until
much later in the evening.

444
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:54,941
You mustn't apologise.

445
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:58,319
It was very illuminating.

446
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,616
Brian, what are you doing at Christmas?

447
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:06,828
Just the usual. Watching telly
with Mum, eating cheap chocolate.

448
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:09,748
That kind of thing, really. Why?

449
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:12,417
Well, it's just that we've
got this cottage in Suffolk.

450
00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:15,129
And it's so dull when it's
just Michael and Rose and me.

451
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:17,422
- Who are Michael and Rose?
- My parents.

452
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:20,842
I thought, maybe you
could come and stay.

453
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:29,017
- I can't really leave Mum.
- No, but after Christmas. For New Year.

454
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:31,437
My parents keep themselves to
themselves most of the time,

455
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,941
so it'd just be me and you,
walking, reading, hanging out.

456
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:39,945
- But if the idea fills you with dread...
- Yes!

457
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:45,450
No... Yes... That would be really good.

458
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:47,828
It's decided, then.

459
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:50,830
Thank you.

460
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:56,545
Good night.

461
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,732
So I take it it went okay then, Romeo?

462
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,611
Well, you know, it went all right.

463
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:23,530
So is love in the air?

464
00:33:23,614 --> 00:33:25,240
Not love.

465
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:29,620
- Like.
- Like is in the air.

466
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:54,228
Mum, I'm home.

467
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:57,439
Mum?

468
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:14,247
Brian! Get out! Get out now!

469
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:21,421
<i>Our obligation to make our own
individual contributions, however small...</i>

470
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:31,724
<i>His name's Des, a widower
from down the road.</i>

471
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:33,642
<i>An ice cream man.</i>

472
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:37,146
<i>You know when he's coming round
because you can hear the chimes.</i>

473
00:34:37,229 --> 00:34:40,440
<i>They've been keeping each
other company ever since I left.</i>

474
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:42,442
<i>Twice a day, sometimes.</i>

475
00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:44,319
These are nice, Julie.

476
00:34:44,445 --> 00:34:47,030
Little sausages wrapped in bacon, Des.

477
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:50,034
Eat your sprouts, you'll get rickets.

478
00:34:50,117 --> 00:34:53,328
Rickets is calcium deficiency,
Mum. You're thinking of scurvy.

479
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:56,415
Brian, I don't care.
Just eat them, will you?

480
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:03,130
<i>And I hope that we shall all try to
make some good news in the coming year.</i>

481
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:06,926
By the way, I've got
an announcement to make.

482
00:35:07,718 --> 00:35:09,428
What's that, then?

483
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:12,014
It's just something
that happened last term.

484
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:15,517
- Oh, God, Brian.
- Mum, don't worry, it's a good thing.

485
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:17,227
Tel me, then.

486
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:20,940
<i>I'm gonna be on University Challenge.</i>

487
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,943
What, that thing on the telly?

488
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,029
Yeah.

489
00:35:27,822 --> 00:35:30,616
Congratulations, Brian.
That's brilliant news.

490
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:33,034
- Oh, God, what a relief.
- Why?

491
00:35:34,036 --> 00:35:37,539
Well, to be honest, Brian, I thought
you were gonna say you were gay.

492
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:03,649
- What're you doing, Mum?
- Oh, just telling him what you're up to.

493
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:06,318
How you're going to be
on telly and everything.

494
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:09,321
What does Dad say?

495
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,618
He doesn't say anything, Brian.

496
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,751
How long you down for, then?

497
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,211
Actually, I'm leaving
the day after tomorrow.

498
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:26,421
You're not coming out New Year?

499
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:29,550
No, I'm gonna go stay with
my mate Alice, in her cottage.

500
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:32,219
Cottage? What is she, a milkmaid?

501
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:33,846
Are you shagging her, then?

502
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:36,431
- Tone, it's platonic.
- What does that mean?

503
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:38,433
Means she won't let him shag her.

504
00:36:41,937 --> 00:36:44,022
- Get lost, Tone.
- What?

505
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:04,752
- All right, where now? Ritzy's? Manhattan's?
- Not Manhattan's.

506
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:08,213
- Actually, I think I'm gonna go home.
- Come on, Jackson, you wuss.

507
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,215
No, no, I'm all right.
I've got reading and stuff.

508
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:12,843
- But I'll see you soon, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, piss off.

509
00:37:18,432 --> 00:37:20,517
What's up with you?

510
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,728
Why are we always telling
each other to piss off, Spence?

511
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:27,650
What's wrong with "Good night",
"Sleep well", "Happy Christmas"?

512
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:30,736
I just don't get all this hostility.

513
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:35,032
Listen, Bri. You're my oldest mate.

514
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:36,616
You're my best mate and I love you.

515
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:39,745
And I think it's great you're going
out there, meeting all these new people,

516
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:41,330
staying in cottages.

517
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:43,416
All that stuff.

518
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:48,546
Promise me one thing, yeah? Promise
me you haven't turned into a wanker.

519
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,810
Oi, Spence. Spence, wait for me.

520
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:13,237
- Now, take a towel.
- I'll use their towels.

521
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:15,614
- You can't use their towels.
- Bye, Mum.

522
00:38:15,948 --> 00:38:18,450
- All right, at least take this.
- What is it?

523
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:22,120
Cold meat. You know, turkey, ham.
Couple of those little sausages.

524
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,248
Mum, I really don't think
that they're gonna need that.

525
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:26,625
Oh, take it. It'll only go off. Please.

526
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:29,628
Just stick it in.

527
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,840
You sure you don't want
to stay for New Year?

528
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:35,843
No, not this year, Mum. Besides,
you've got Mr Whippy now, haven't you?

529
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:37,511
Brian. That's enough.

530
00:38:37,637 --> 00:38:41,432
- What?
- You know what. Go on, then.

531
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:45,435
Have fun.

532
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,043
Happy Christmas, Brian.

533
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,714
It's so good to see you.

534
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:19,344
It's an actual fact that bees hum by
blowing air through their spiracles.

535
00:39:19,428 --> 00:39:22,514
- Spiracles. It's fascinating.
- I know.

536
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:25,517
Isn't that fascinating, Michael?

537
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:27,227
Sorry, I was somewhere else.

538
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:30,314
So, Brian, is this your
first time in Suffolk?

539
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:33,525
No, I was here once before
on a climbing holiday.

540
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:34,818
Really?

541
00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:37,112
Isn't it very flat for climbing?

542
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,032
I was misinformed.

543
00:39:43,453 --> 00:39:45,913
- Brian's joking, Rose.
- Oh.

544
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:01,637
Oh, my God, I love this song.

545
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:05,849
I lost my virginity to this
on a mime course in Tuscany.

546
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:09,311
- Yeah?
- Let's set the mood.

547
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:14,942
Michael and Rose have gone to bed.

548
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:29,040
No, thanks.

549
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:32,835
- What's up?
- I just can't smoke.

550
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,839
- You can't smoke?
- No, I've never learned.

551
00:40:37,423 --> 00:40:39,842
Oh, my God, Brian,
how can you not smoke?

552
00:40:40,426 --> 00:40:42,511
Smoking's what I do best.

553
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:44,847
Or second best, anyway.

554
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:49,352
All right, we'll try
a different approach.

555
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:52,729
On your knees, facing me,
hands behind your back.

556
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:58,152
Now, I'm gonna blow the
smoke into your mouth,

557
00:40:58,236 --> 00:41:01,530
and you're going to inhale,
very deeply. Understood?

558
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:24,720
- Nice?
- Very nice.

559
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:27,139
- Again?
- Please.

560
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:28,724
Are you sure? It's very strong.

561
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,143
- I can take it.
- Okay, here goes.

562
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:53,040
You really should exhale now.

563
00:41:55,335 --> 00:42:00,048
This is a terrible idea.
Kiss of death. Remember?

564
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:14,728
Actually I... I feel a little bit...

565
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:21,152
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Good night, Brian.

566
00:42:29,952 --> 00:42:31,119
Oh, shit.

567
00:42:37,543 --> 00:42:39,211
Here it is.

568
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:07,823
Oh, my God!

569
00:43:10,743 --> 00:43:12,911
Well, hello, Mrs Harbinson.

570
00:43:13,121 --> 00:43:15,623
Brian. You scared me.

571
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:22,338
Still, I expect you've seen
hundreds of naked women before.

572
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:25,132
You'd be surprised, Mrs Harbinson.

573
00:43:25,216 --> 00:43:27,218
I've told you before,
please don't call me that.

574
00:43:27,343 --> 00:43:29,928
It makes me feel so old. Call me Rose.

575
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:36,018
Are you trying to
seduce me, Mrs Harbinson?

576
00:43:37,812 --> 00:43:39,021
What?

577
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,942
I said, are you trying to
seduce me, Mrs Harbinson?

578
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:45,528
No, Brian, I most certainly am not.

579
00:43:45,612 --> 00:43:49,449
No, I know. It's just a quote.

580
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:51,034
You know, like Mrs Robinson...

581
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:53,536
I haven't the least intention
of trying to seduce you.

582
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,247
I know. And I don't want
to seduce you either.

583
00:43:56,331 --> 00:43:58,833
That's not to say you're
unattractive, because, obviously,

584
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:01,628
you've got a beautiful body
for someone of your age.

585
00:44:01,628 --> 00:44:03,046
I beg your pardon!

586
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:04,630
What's going on down here?

587
00:44:04,714 --> 00:44:06,048
Nothing's going on.

588
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:07,424
Hello, Mr Harbinson.

589
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,134
What the hell are you talking about?

590
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:12,722
Nothing. I just came down for a
glass of milk and I bumped into Brian.

591
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:15,140
Right. I think I'll
just head back upstairs.

592
00:44:15,225 --> 00:44:17,644
Brian, where are your trousers?

593
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:19,645
Well, you can talk, big guy.

594
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:23,733
Brian, are you... Are you stoned?

595
00:44:26,027 --> 00:44:27,820
No way, man.

596
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:41,834
I'm so sorry about all this.
We only found out this morning.

597
00:44:41,918 --> 00:44:44,837
Granny fell down the stairs in the
night, and fractured her hip apparently.

598
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:47,632
We just thought we better go and
see her in hospital down in Dorset.

599
00:44:47,715 --> 00:44:50,926
Mum and Dad set off early this morning.
They send their love, by the way.

600
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:53,929
They're so sorry you can't
be here for New Year's Eve.

601
00:44:54,013 --> 00:44:57,224
Actually, I bumped into them
in the kitchen last night.

602
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:00,144
- Really?
- Did they say anything?

603
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:03,231
- No. Not at all.
- Great.

604
00:45:04,023 --> 00:45:07,943
Listen, Brian, the train's
not for six, seven minutes yet.

605
00:45:08,027 --> 00:45:10,320
Do you mind if I don't hang around?

606
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:13,824
Of course not.

607
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:27,421
Hello. Anyone home?

608
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:35,221
No. Thought not.

609
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:50,736
Excuse me, come to our demonstration.

610
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,532
- Come to our demonstration?
- Sorry, no thank you.

611
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:00,037
Protesting on New Year's Eve?

612
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:02,039
Injustice never rests.

613
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,043
Well, methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

614
00:46:08,922 --> 00:46:11,215
It's from Hamlet. It's a joke.

615
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:13,551
I think I'll be the judge of that.

616
00:46:13,635 --> 00:46:15,845
- Good Christmas?
- Not really. You?

617
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:19,933
We're secular Jewish non-Zionist
socialists. We don't really do Christmas.

618
00:46:20,016 --> 00:46:21,851
Right. Sounds a riot.

619
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:24,019
Why do you think I'm back here?

620
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:25,312
What's in the bag?

621
00:46:25,438 --> 00:46:27,022
It's New Year's Eve dinner.

622
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:32,528
Individual chicken pie
and a tin of sweetcorn.

623
00:46:32,612 --> 00:46:34,530
Fasten your seatbelts.

624
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:37,117
Yeah, except for a souvenir tea towel.

625
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:39,244
Well, I hope you had some clothes on.

626
00:46:39,327 --> 00:46:41,412
Socks, shoes, no trousers.

627
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:43,623
What, and then she chucked you out?

628
00:46:43,748 --> 00:46:45,416
- She didn't chuck me out, Rebecca.
- No?

629
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:46,918
No. Alice's elderly grandmother

630
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:49,837
accidentally had a fall down
the stairs and fractured her hip.

631
00:46:53,425 --> 00:46:56,344
- She could've been telling the truth.
- Yeah, of course she was telling the truth.

632
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:01,015
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

633
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:02,350
Sorry.

634
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,228
So, what are we gonna do tonight?

635
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,316
- Haven't you got a party to go to?
- I think I can skip that.

636
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:15,613
I've got an individual chicken pie.

637
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:18,824
Oh. Well, then, how
could I possibly refuse?

638
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,952
I'm only flesh and blood.

639
00:47:28,626 --> 00:47:31,045
I've never been very good
at those parties, anyway.

640
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:35,424
Two hundred drunk students hurling
themselves at each other in a tiny room.

641
00:47:36,843 --> 00:47:40,847
Then at 3:00 in the morning,
some lager-breathed stranger

642
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,015
trying to rub his face on me.

643
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:45,143
I think I'm safer here.

644
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:50,231
So you don't have
a... What's the word...

645
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:53,442
Boyfriend, or partner?

646
00:47:53,526 --> 00:47:54,818
What, comrade?

647
00:47:55,612 --> 00:47:57,614
Not as such.

648
00:47:57,614 --> 00:48:00,617
Never seemed to have much
luck in that department.

649
00:48:00,742 --> 00:48:02,952
I don't know why.

650
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:05,747
I don't know why, either.

651
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,833
- Brian, are you trying to flirt?
- No.

652
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:12,419
Then why are you putting on that voice?

653
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,130
Look, I just mean...

654
00:48:14,714 --> 00:48:19,051
I'm sure you could have a, you
know, boyfriend if you wanted one.

655
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:22,930
I have my amorous moments, I suppose.

656
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:25,016
Once in a while.

657
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,646
What's this?

658
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,023
It's my notebook. It's...

659
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:36,819
That's just for jotting down ideas,

660
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:39,113
bits of poetry.

661
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:44,034
Brian, you have to promise me something.

662
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:48,039
Promise me that you will never,
never show me your poetry.

663
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:50,834
I wouldn't dare, Rebecca.

664
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:59,925
- Hey, what's the time?
- It's... 11:56.

665
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:04,138
We can't start 1986
listening to this moaning.

666
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:06,432
- We?
- Right.

667
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:24,242
- Well, I hope you're not too disappointed.
- What?

668
00:49:24,326 --> 00:49:27,412
Stuck here with me instead of blondie.

669
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:32,042
Rebecca! Of course not. I... Look.

670
00:49:33,418 --> 00:49:35,420
I'd much rather be here.

671
00:49:35,629 --> 00:49:37,047
Is that right?

672
00:49:42,218 --> 00:49:45,221
- Hey, what's the time?
- It's 11:58.

673
00:49:45,722 --> 00:49:48,349
Two minutes to go.

674
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:51,436
So, what shall we do to pass the time?

675
00:50:24,636 --> 00:50:26,429
Wait. Hang on a sec, Brian.

676
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:29,140
What? I'm sorry, was that wrong?

677
00:50:29,224 --> 00:50:31,434
Wrong? No, it's not that. Look.

678
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,423
Happy New Year, Brian.

679
00:51:02,632 --> 00:51:04,216
Happy New Year, Alice.

680
00:51:08,013 --> 00:51:09,222
Alice?

681
00:51:15,812 --> 00:51:16,813
Rebecca.

682
00:51:16,938 --> 00:51:20,441
Rebecca! Look, it was
a slip of the tongue.

683
00:51:20,525 --> 00:51:22,318
What, the tongue you had
down my throat, you mean?

684
00:51:22,444 --> 00:51:24,112
You really are a complete
and utter prat, Jackson!

685
00:51:24,237 --> 00:51:26,614
- I know.
- Christ knows I've met some prats in my time,

686
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,241
but you really do win the award.

687
00:51:28,325 --> 00:51:29,951
Let me help you with that.

688
00:51:30,035 --> 00:51:31,745
Get your hands off of me!

689
00:51:32,746 --> 00:51:35,123
Well, thanks for a
memorable evening, Brian.

690
00:51:35,248 --> 00:51:37,416
And have a Happy New Year.

691
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:55,435
Happy New Year!

692
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:07,822
- Hello, Brian.
- Hi.

693
00:52:41,732 --> 00:52:47,237
"My heart aches, and a drowsy
numbness pains my sense,

694
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:50,531
"as though of hemlock I had drunk,

695
00:52:50,615 --> 00:52:54,452
"or emptied some dull
opiate to the drains."

696
00:52:55,746 --> 00:52:56,830
Brian.

697
00:52:58,123 --> 00:52:59,916
Stay on afterwards, will you?

698
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:04,045
"One minute past and
leafy woods had sunk."

699
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:07,424
Are you experiencing emotional problems?

700
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:09,050
Emotional problems?

701
00:53:09,926 --> 00:53:13,930
Affairs of the heart, anxieties of
a romantic, or perhaps sexual nature.

702
00:53:14,014 --> 00:53:17,642
And believe me, Brian, I'm finding this
at least as embarrassing as you are.

703
00:53:18,935 --> 00:53:20,811
What makes you ask?

704
00:53:20,937 --> 00:53:23,940
When I interviewed you, a
year ago now, you struck me as

705
00:53:24,024 --> 00:53:25,942
being a particularly
passionate young man.

706
00:53:26,026 --> 00:53:28,820
A little incoherent, maybe a little
gauche. Is that fair, do you think?

707
00:53:28,945 --> 00:53:30,029
Go on.

708
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,116
But you also seemed to have a
sincere passion for knowledge

709
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:35,326
that's missing from some
our, what shall we say,

710
00:53:35,452 --> 00:53:38,037
some of our more privileged students.

711
00:53:38,038 --> 00:53:39,914
And that's why I was
happy to offer you a place

712
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,625
because I knew that you'd
actually fought for it.

713
00:53:43,835 --> 00:53:45,628
But looking at your grades this year,

714
00:53:45,712 --> 00:53:50,049
7 4%, 68%, 57%.

715
00:53:51,843 --> 00:53:54,846
It seems you're actually
becoming less intelligent.

716
00:53:54,846 --> 00:53:59,350
And that, strangely enough, is
not what an education is for.

717
00:54:00,435 --> 00:54:02,228
- Jackson, Bristol!
- Toad and Badger.

718
00:54:02,312 --> 00:54:04,230
Is the wrong answer.

719
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:06,316
The T-S in T.S. Elliot stands for.

720
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:08,151
- Jackson, Bristol!
- Thomas Stewart.

721
00:54:08,235 --> 00:54:10,528
- Once again, the wrong answer. Lucy?
- Thomas Stearns.

722
00:54:10,612 --> 00:54:11,738
- Correct.
- Patrick, I just want...

723
00:54:11,822 --> 00:54:13,323
The studio conditions, Brian.

724
00:54:14,241 --> 00:54:17,452
In anatomy, where might you find the
arcuate fasciculus, Wernicke's area...

725
00:54:19,413 --> 00:54:20,414
Jackson, Bristol.

726
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:22,040
Sorry. Is Alice coming today?

727
00:54:22,124 --> 00:54:24,835
Apparently not. I'm not
delighted about it, either, Brian.

728
00:54:24,918 --> 00:54:26,920
In 24 hours we're making a
recorded appearance in front of

729
00:54:27,045 --> 00:54:31,632
a TV audience of millions and you think
Thomas Elliot's middle name was Stewart!

730
00:54:31,633 --> 00:54:33,426
Once again.

731
00:54:33,427 --> 00:54:35,512
The arcuate fasciculus,
Wernicke's area...

732
00:54:44,438 --> 00:54:46,523
So this is where it all happens, is it?

733
00:54:47,024 --> 00:54:49,151
Spencer? What are you doing here?

734
00:54:49,234 --> 00:54:52,111
I thought I'd pay you a
visit. You don't mind, do you?

735
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:54,031
No.

736
00:54:57,618 --> 00:55:00,746
Really good to see you, Spence,
just a bit of a surprise, that's all.

737
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:01,913
Who let you in, anyway?

738
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:04,541
Some wanker in a velvet waistcoat.

739
00:55:05,751 --> 00:55:07,544
You were nice to him,
though, weren't you?

740
00:55:07,628 --> 00:55:09,129
I don't know. Should I have been?

741
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:12,715
It's just, I do have to live
with him, and I just asked?

742
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:14,843
Yeah? Are you writing poetry?

743
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:18,430
No. Give me that! Give me that!

744
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:22,642
- Give me that.
- Who's Alice anyway?

745
00:55:23,435 --> 00:55:24,727
With the big bosoms?

746
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:26,145
You're not serious?

747
00:55:27,147 --> 00:55:29,732
You are serious. Bloody
hell, Spencer. What now?

748
00:55:29,816 --> 00:55:32,026
I'm being prosecuted for
fiddling me unemployment benefit.

749
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:33,236
What's gonna happen?

750
00:55:33,237 --> 00:55:35,530
I don't know. Depends
on the judge, I suppose.

751
00:55:36,448 --> 00:55:39,617
But you still got the arcade job, right?

752
00:55:39,743 --> 00:55:43,037
Not as such, no. They sort of
found me with my hand in the till.

753
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:44,539
What do they think you took?

754
00:55:44,623 --> 00:55:46,750
- Couple of hundred.
- How much did you take?

755
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,626
Yeah, couple of hundred
sounds about right.

756
00:55:48,752 --> 00:55:49,919
Spencer.

757
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:52,922
You're a socialist. I thought you
approved of the redistribution of wealth.

758
00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:56,718
By acquiring the means of
production. Not by just nicking stuff.

759
00:55:56,843 --> 00:55:59,136
Can we talk about something else?

760
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:01,932
I came here to get away from all that.
Have a bit of a laugh, bit of fun, yeah.

761
00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:04,934
Okay. Yeah, we can do that.

762
00:56:07,229 --> 00:56:09,814
- Is she gonna be there?
- Who?

763
00:56:10,023 --> 00:56:14,235
You know, the posh one.
The one in the poems.

764
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:17,447
Alice? I hope so. Be
nice, though, won't you?

765
00:56:17,531 --> 00:56:20,534
Who, me? I'm always nice.

766
00:56:20,617 --> 00:56:23,244
This hand and a bucket of water...

767
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:25,830
Look, let's move on.

768
00:56:25,914 --> 00:56:27,832
# With many cheerful facts
about the square of hypotenuse

769
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:30,043
# With many cheerful facts
about the square of hypotenuse

770
00:56:30,127 --> 00:56:33,839
# With many cheerful facts
about the square of hypotenuse

771
00:56:33,922 --> 00:56:36,132
# I am the very model
of a modern Major-General

772
00:56:36,216 --> 00:56:39,427
# I've information, vegetable,
animal, and mineral... #

773
00:56:39,553 --> 00:56:40,637
Pub?

774
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:45,433
lt'll liven up. Come on, let's see
what's happening upstairs, yeah?

775
00:56:50,731 --> 00:56:52,315
Come here.

776
00:56:55,027 --> 00:56:56,528
That's her.

777
00:56:58,113 --> 00:57:00,031
In the leotard.

778
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:02,617
- Well, introduce us, then.
- What for?

779
00:57:02,743 --> 00:57:04,619
- You told me to be nice.
- Yeah, but

780
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,912
I thought we'd go have
a drink or something...

781
00:57:06,038 --> 00:57:08,331
- She's coming over. She's coming over.
- What?

782
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:09,624
Hello.

783
00:57:13,837 --> 00:57:15,547
Hi.

784
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:17,132
So, who's this, then?

785
00:57:17,216 --> 00:57:19,134
Alice, this is Spencer.

786
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:22,846
Oh, the famous Spencer.
I've heard all about you.

787
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:24,222
- I've heard all about you.
- Oh, good.

788
00:57:24,348 --> 00:57:26,725
- Drink, anyone?
- Tell me, what have you heard?

789
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:28,935
I don't think I can say.

790
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:30,645
- Anyone want a drink?
- What have you heard?

791
00:57:30,729 --> 00:57:31,813
- You first.
- No, you first.

792
00:57:31,939 --> 00:57:34,024
I'm gonna just go and
get some drinks, yeah?

793
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:39,237
# Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

794
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:43,533
# Without no seams nor needlework... #

795
00:57:50,749 --> 00:57:52,125
You're not gonna hit me, are you?

796
00:57:54,545 --> 00:57:56,421
I haven't decided yet.

797
00:57:59,424 --> 00:58:00,842
Rebecca.

798
00:58:00,926 --> 00:58:02,552
- I'm sorry about...
- Look, Brian.

799
00:58:02,636 --> 00:58:04,638
I got drunk. I was having a nice time

800
00:58:04,721 --> 00:58:08,433
and I fancied a bit of
human, whatever, contact.

801
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:14,022
And I made a mistake. Misread the signals.
Very embarrassing, but not a big deal.

802
00:58:14,148 --> 00:58:16,024
I'm sure I'll learn to love again.

803
00:58:25,242 --> 00:58:28,245
Have you got your fluffy mascot
packed ready for the big match?

804
00:58:28,328 --> 00:58:30,121
No, think it's all a bit
silly, that mascot stuff.

805
00:58:30,247 --> 00:58:32,832
Brian, you're such a maverick!

806
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:34,250
So, are you gonna come
along and watch, then?

807
00:58:34,334 --> 00:58:36,544
What, see you in action?
You must be joking.

808
00:58:36,628 --> 00:58:38,421
I wish you would.
There's a free minibus.

809
00:58:38,547 --> 00:58:40,549
Yeah, what do you care anyway?

810
00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:43,927
Just like you to be there, that's all.

811
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:47,639
Only don't say anything to my mate
Spencer. He'd only take a piss.

812
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:49,015
Oh, my God, Patrick!

813
00:58:51,018 --> 00:58:55,147
Brian, I hope that's not an
alcoholic beverage in your hand there.

814
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,315
- Big day tomorrow and all.
- Why's that, then?

815
00:58:57,441 --> 00:58:59,443
'Cause he's the team's
star player, aren't you?

816
00:58:59,443 --> 00:59:02,112
<i>- What team?
- This year's University Challenge team.</i>

817
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,823
- You're joking?
- No.

818
00:59:05,824 --> 00:59:07,116
You?

819
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:09,118
Me, Alice, Lucy and Patrick.

820
00:59:09,244 --> 00:59:11,037
- What, actually on telly?
- Yeah.

821
00:59:11,038 --> 00:59:14,833
- Bloody hell, Brian. You dark horse.
- Something funny?

822
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:16,627
No, not at all, mate.

823
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:19,045
Just always wondered what
kind of bizarre nerdy swot

824
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:21,548
would wanna go on a programme like
that, turns out it's you, Brian.

825
00:59:21,632 --> 00:59:24,134
- I didn't want to tell you.
- So...

826
00:59:24,218 --> 00:59:26,929
Where are you studying, mate?

827
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:30,348
Actually, Patrick, Spencer
is taking a year out.

828
00:59:30,432 --> 00:59:33,435
- No, I'm not. I'm unemployed.
- I see.

829
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:36,438
- Social Security, then.
- That's right, yeah.

830
00:59:36,522 --> 00:59:39,149
Or he was, until those bastards
decided to prosecute him.

831
00:59:39,233 --> 00:59:42,444
- Are you being prosecuted, Spencer?
- Only for fiddling his dole.

832
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:44,321
Do you think you'll go to prison?

833
00:59:44,446 --> 00:59:46,239
I'm sure if he didn't
do it, he'll be fine.

834
00:59:46,323 --> 00:59:49,951
But he did. He had to, didn't
you? Just to make a living wage.

835
00:59:50,035 --> 00:59:52,328
- So you did have a job? -
Bit of cash-in-hand, yeah.

836
00:59:52,413 --> 00:59:54,331
Well, then, I have to
say best of luck, mate.

837
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:56,917
Well, hang on. Do you have any idea
how much the government pay a week?

838
00:59:57,042 --> 00:59:58,835
So, there's obviously
plenty of work out there.

839
00:59:58,919 --> 01:00:00,629
That's a little harsh,
Patrick, some people...

840
01:00:00,713 --> 01:00:03,424
- There's three million unemployed.
- Yes, but he isn't one of them, is he?

841
01:00:03,424 --> 01:00:04,550
If his job wasn't paying him enough,

842
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:05,925
he should get on his bike
and find a better one.

843
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:08,344
He certainly shouldn't steal
from law abiding citizens...

844
01:00:09,346 --> 01:00:11,639
Here's a question for
you, mate! What is my name?

845
01:00:11,724 --> 01:00:12,850
- What?
- Spencer put him down.

846
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:14,643
You heard me, what is my name?

847
01:00:14,852 --> 01:00:16,812
- I'll have to hurry you.
- Spencer, I'm serious, put him down.

848
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,438
- My name is?
- Patrick, say Spencer.

849
01:00:18,522 --> 01:00:20,232
- Spencer, Spencer.
- Correct.

850
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:23,652
And if you got something to say to
me, you say it to my face! All right?

851
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:28,532
Patrick.

852
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:30,742
Spencer!

853
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:05,653
The party's over.

854
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:12,951
Your friend was looking for you.

855
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:17,539
- Why do you think I'm sitting out here?
- Yeah.

856
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,042
Quite a handful, isn't he?

857
01:01:24,546 --> 01:01:26,130
Is Alice all right?

858
01:01:30,928 --> 01:01:35,349
Brian, sometimes the people
you care about the most just

859
01:01:35,933 --> 01:01:37,935
basically they don't
give a toss about you.

860
01:01:38,018 --> 01:01:39,936
Look, you don't know that.

861
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:41,730
Well, go on, then. Try. I dare you.

862
01:01:41,814 --> 01:01:44,024
Go and see her right now
and tell her how you feel

863
01:01:44,024 --> 01:01:46,818
and then maybe we can
all get some bloody peace.

864
01:02:19,018 --> 01:02:20,853
Come on, Alice, open up.

865
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:27,817
Oh, my God, Brian. What's up?

866
01:02:28,819 --> 01:02:31,029
Could I come in, do you think?

867
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,824
- I'll get some clothes on.
- All right.

868
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,250
Okay, you can come in.

869
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:49,047
All right, I'm sorry about tonight.

870
01:02:50,216 --> 01:02:52,218
I love Spencer, but he can
be such a wanker sometimes.

871
01:02:52,218 --> 01:02:54,053
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

872
01:02:54,553 --> 01:02:58,431
I know I probably shouldn't say this,
but it was actually quite exciting.

873
01:02:58,516 --> 01:03:00,726
Like Roman gladiators
or something and that...

874
01:03:03,354 --> 01:03:05,230
I've been dying to do that for so long.

875
01:03:07,233 --> 01:03:08,734
Oh, please don't.

876
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,153
What? We did it before.

877
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,031
We've got a big day tomorrow. Can
we just talk about this some other...

878
01:03:14,114 --> 01:03:16,032
I love you, Alice.

879
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,745
At least, I think I do.

880
01:03:21,038 --> 01:03:23,623
I thought that we had
something. Didn't we, Alice?

881
01:03:23,749 --> 01:03:28,920
Some kind of chemistry, or
electricity, or whatever but...

882
01:03:32,424 --> 01:03:34,551
All right, mate?

883
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,225
We were talking...

884
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,148
Bri, Bri.

885
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:53,027
Look, I know you might not believe this,
I was actually putting a good word for you.

886
01:03:53,154 --> 01:03:54,822
Spencer, mate, you were half-naked.

887
01:03:54,947 --> 01:03:57,616
We was only fooling around,
it's nothing serious.

888
01:03:59,952 --> 01:04:03,538
Look, Bri, if you've got something to
say, just say it 'cause this is stupid.

889
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,042
You knew how I felt about her.

890
01:04:07,126 --> 01:04:10,712
You knew, Spence. I told you. And
you couldn't keep away, could you?

891
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:13,048
- She started it.
- Well, that's all right then, isn't it?

892
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:15,634
And what about the fight? Was
that somebody else's fault as well?

893
01:04:15,634 --> 01:04:17,552
What do you expect? He was
trying to make me look stupid.

894
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:18,928
So you resorted to violence?

895
01:04:19,013 --> 01:04:20,723
No, I didn't resort to it.
Violence was my first choice.

896
01:04:20,848 --> 01:04:22,724
All right, that's cool.
That's very hard, mate.

897
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:26,228
Well, I didn't exactly see you going
out of your way to help me, did I, Judas?

898
01:04:26,228 --> 01:04:28,813
- I was sticking up for you!
- Oh, that's what you were doing.

899
01:04:28,939 --> 01:04:30,649
You see, for a moment I
thought you were just flapping

900
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,235
your social conscience around
in front of your girlfriend!

901
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:35,738
You made me feel like a prick, Bri.

902
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:38,448
- You are a prick.
- Don't push your luck, Jackson.

903
01:04:38,532 --> 01:04:41,243
What is it, Spencer, this
need to smash things up?

904
01:04:41,327 --> 01:04:43,454
You know, it's all very well
messing your own life up,

905
01:04:43,537 --> 01:04:45,539
but why do you have to do it with
people that care about themselves?

906
01:04:45,623 --> 01:04:47,750
People who're trying
to achieve something,

907
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:50,627
- make something of their lives?
- What, like you, you mean?

908
01:04:51,629 --> 01:04:54,548
- You're just jealous of me.
- Jealous? What, of you?

909
01:04:55,049 --> 01:04:58,218
You think because you read a couple
books you're suddenly better than me?

910
01:04:58,344 --> 01:04:59,845
That's not what Alice seems to think.

911
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,439
I want you gone, Spencer. I
want you on the first train.

912
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:13,233
I don't care how much trouble
you're in. You've gotta go.

913
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:17,237
Brian. Where are you going, Brian?

914
01:05:22,326 --> 01:05:23,827
I'm sorry.

915
01:05:26,747 --> 01:05:30,542
Wake up! We have to be in
Manchester in two hours.

916
01:05:30,835 --> 01:05:32,044
Brian!

917
01:05:35,715 --> 01:05:37,425
Two minutes, Brian.

918
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:46,224
Patrick, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure they can cover that up

919
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,518
- with make-up or...
- Just get in, will you?

920
01:05:51,522 --> 01:05:52,731
Hey, there.

921
01:05:55,943 --> 01:05:58,028
Here we are then, the Fantastic Four.

922
01:06:04,243 --> 01:06:07,329
The duodenum and ileum form
part of which bodily system?

923
01:06:07,413 --> 01:06:08,914
- The digestive system.
- Correct.

924
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,126
<i>The Wild Duck and Rosmersholm
are by which Nordic playwright?</i>

925
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:16,046
Patrick, can I just ask, do you think
by some kind of freakish coincidence,

926
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:17,840
these questions are
going to be on the show?

927
01:06:17,923 --> 01:06:20,842
Because if they're not, it's a
bit of a waste of time, isn't it?

928
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:24,513
It's a warm-up, Brian, for those of us
who aren't feeling too fresh this morning.

929
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,433
What about Alice, then?
Late night was it, Alice?

930
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,726
- Not here, Brian.
- Right, so,

931
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,521
just the four of us today or
is someone hiding in the back?

932
01:06:32,647 --> 01:06:33,939
Later, okay?

933
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,150
Will someone please tell
me what the hell's going on?

934
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:38,235
I know. Let's listen to some music.

935
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:59,214
Finally. I'll let them know you're here.

936
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:01,717
Brian, where are you going?

937
01:07:01,842 --> 01:07:03,844
Just give me five minutes. All right?

938
01:07:03,844 --> 01:07:05,846
- We're already late because of you.
- Leave him, Patrick.

939
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,223
All right. But five minutes only.

940
01:07:10,017 --> 01:07:11,435
Mum, it's not for hours yet.

941
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:14,647
I know. We set off at dawn. We
thought we'd make a day of it.

942
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,148
I brought Des along.
You don't mind, do you?

943
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,650
No. No, that's fine.

944
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:21,028
- What do you think, Bri?
- I've got to go.

945
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,240
Brian, is something wrong?

946
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,242
What could possibly be wrong, Mum?

947
01:07:26,325 --> 01:07:28,243
Is it Des, Brian?

948
01:07:28,327 --> 01:07:31,621
Brian? Get back here
this minute, young man!

949
01:07:37,628 --> 01:07:40,047
Brian, I wish your Dad
was here today, too.

950
01:07:40,131 --> 01:07:41,841
But that's not going to happen, is it?

951
01:07:42,717 --> 01:07:45,344
I'm sorry you don't like Des, but I do.

952
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:48,139
And he likes me. And he makes me laugh.

953
01:07:48,222 --> 01:07:51,225
Which, believe me, hasn't happened
much in the last ten years.

954
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:53,226
Jackson, we're waiting.

955
01:07:54,645 --> 01:07:55,729
Now!

956
01:07:57,732 --> 01:07:59,233
I've gotta go.

957
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,323
Everything all right?

958
01:08:08,242 --> 01:08:10,827
Brian, I can't stand
this, us not talking.

959
01:08:10,828 --> 01:08:12,746
What is there to talk about, Alice?

960
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:19,044
I'm sorry if I led you on.
And I'm sorry about Spencer.

961
01:08:19,253 --> 01:08:25,842
I didn't intend to, it was just a sort
of physical, animal attraction. Sex thing.

962
01:08:25,843 --> 01:08:28,053
This isn't necessarily
helping me, Alice.

963
01:08:34,727 --> 01:08:35,936
Oh, my God.

964
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:42,818
So.

965
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:45,821
We meet again.

966
01:08:55,122 --> 01:08:56,623
Isn't that the team that...

967
01:08:56,749 --> 01:08:58,417
Beat us last year. Yes,
Lucy, that's correct.

968
01:08:58,543 --> 01:09:00,336
Okay, people, let's quiz.

969
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,630
- How many vertices has a dodecahedron?
- Twelve.

970
01:09:04,048 --> 01:09:05,215
Wrong. Minus five points.

971
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,051
So they're really,
really good, aren't they?

972
01:09:07,134 --> 01:09:09,845
- The so called Hammer of the Scots, which...
- Henry II.

973
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:12,223
Minus ten points.

974
01:09:12,223 --> 01:09:14,350
- So basically we're screwed.
- Edward II?

975
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:17,352
Okay, Brian, here's a question for
you. If you don't know the answer,

976
01:09:17,436 --> 01:09:19,312
why the hell do you bother
even opening your mouth?

977
01:09:19,438 --> 01:09:21,731
Nobody else was answering so I
thought I might as well have a stab.

978
01:09:21,816 --> 01:09:23,150
Okay, everyone, let's just calm down.

979
01:09:23,234 --> 01:09:26,320
That's your problem, isn't it?
Always having a stab without a clue.

980
01:09:26,445 --> 01:09:28,613
Stab, stab, stab, getting everything
wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

981
01:09:28,739 --> 01:09:30,031
- I'm off to find a pub.
- It's fun, remember?

982
01:09:30,116 --> 01:09:32,118
I don't even know why I let you
on this team in the first place.

983
01:09:32,243 --> 01:09:33,619
You are completely ignorant.

984
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:35,621
Worse even than that thick
yob of a friend of yours.

985
01:09:35,621 --> 01:09:37,748
- You started that.
- You turn up drunk, reeking of booze

986
01:09:37,832 --> 01:09:40,251
- Iooking like a tramp on national television.
- Don't do that, Patrick.

987
01:09:40,334 --> 01:09:42,336
It's true what they say, isn't it?
You can take the boy out of Essex,

988
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,921
but you can't take Essex out of a boy.

989
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:48,050
Ow!

990
01:10:05,151 --> 01:10:08,529
Of course, what we witness
here is a basic misunderstanding

991
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:10,323
of the principle of the headbutt.

992
01:10:12,325 --> 01:10:14,827
You're meant to hit the
soft part of their nose

993
01:10:14,952 --> 01:10:17,829
with hard part of your forehead,
not the other way around.

994
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:20,625
Here, here, how many
fingers am I holding up?

995
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,627
- lf I get it wrong, do I lose five points?
- No, not this time.

996
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:25,838
Three.

997
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:27,340
Battle of Agincourt?

998
01:10:28,341 --> 01:10:29,633
1415.

999
01:10:29,717 --> 01:10:31,844
Yeah, I think you're gonna be all right.

1000
01:10:35,223 --> 01:10:36,933
I'm glad you came.

1001
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:42,146
What, you lying unconscious
in a pool of your own blood?

1002
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:44,523
Wouldn't have missed that for the world.

1003
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:50,238
Mr Jackson, we need you now.

1004
01:10:50,321 --> 01:10:51,530
All right.

1005
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:58,120
Oh, and this is for you. I managed
to get most of the blood out.

1006
01:10:58,246 --> 01:10:59,914
Thank you so much.

1007
01:11:01,749 --> 01:11:02,916
Yeah?

1008
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:06,754
Yeah. Oh, hang on, you might
want to... Here, let me.

1009
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:14,053
That's all right.

1010
01:11:14,846 --> 01:11:16,722
Now, Mr Jackson.

1011
01:11:18,516 --> 01:11:20,017
Wait... Brian,

1012
01:11:21,728 --> 01:11:24,439
you show those stuck-up
bastards what you're made of.

1013
01:11:29,027 --> 01:11:33,031
- lf you'd like to wait here.
- Okay.

1014
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,325
Ah, there's Bamber. Wait here please.

1015
01:11:53,426 --> 01:11:54,635
Oh, my God.

1016
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:10,317
<i>Which constellation of seven bright
stars includes Merak, Megrez and Mizar?</i>

1017
01:12:10,735 --> 01:12:14,321
<i>Ursa Major or the Great Bear,
also known as the Big Dipper.</i>

1018
01:12:14,822 --> 01:12:16,114
I knew that.

1019
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,419
Oh.

1020
01:12:28,419 --> 01:12:30,212
There it is.

1021
01:12:30,338 --> 01:12:32,048
Okay, everybody. Two minutes.

1022
01:12:44,644 --> 01:12:46,354
I'm sorry about that.

1023
01:12:46,437 --> 01:12:50,816
It's all right. In retrospect, it's
possible I wasn't entirely faultless.

1024
01:12:55,446 --> 01:12:56,613
What?

1025
01:12:57,532 --> 01:12:59,825
You think it's too much?

1026
01:13:00,034 --> 01:13:02,619
Okay. If you'd like to take your seats?

1027
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,249
All right, team.

1028
01:13:09,043 --> 01:13:11,253
Let's take these mothers out!

1029
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:32,025
Coming to the studio
live in three, two, one...

1030
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,442
Intro Bamber.

1031
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:38,114

questions, Bamber Gascoigne.</i>

1032

Minneapolis, reading Medicine.

1048
01:14:23,618 --> 01:14:29,040
Without further ado, here's your first starter
for ten. Listen carefully before you buzz.

1049
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,043
For a straight line graph of Y against
X where the gradient of the line is two

1050
01:14:32,043 --> 01:14:34,628
and the Y intercept is five, what
is the value of Y when X is ten?

Salmon, Queens'.

1052
01:14:36,047 --> 01:14:38,049

What was identified by Hegel
as the tendency of a concept

1055
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:50,228
to pass over into its own negation as
the result of conflict between its...

1056
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:51,645
Watts, Bristol.

1057
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:57,234
- I'm sorry, I don't know the answer.
- Well, I'm afraid you lose five points.

1058
01:14:57,235 --> 01:14:58,319
Salmon, Queens'.

1059
01:14:58,444 --> 01:15:00,237
- Is it dialectics?
- Dialectics indeed.

1060
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:02,448
So three more questions for you.

1061
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:07,327
- Chang, Bristol.
- The adrenal gland?

1062
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:09,038
Correct. Puts you back in the game.

Three bonus questions on geography.

1064
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:13,626
Which is the only African

01:15:18,923 --> 01:15:20,049
Algeria.

1067
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:21,342
I have to hurry you.

1068
01:15:22,635 --> 01:15:23,844
Algeria.

1069
01:15:23,845 --> 01:15:26,013
No, I'm afraid the answer is Morocco.

1070
01:15:28,016 --> 01:15:30,018
Now, look at your monitors.

1071
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:33,520
Watts, Bristol.

1072
01:15:33,646 --> 01:15:36,023

1074
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:39,944
Is the correct answer.

- De Havilland, Queens'.
- Calcium carbonate.

1076

- Jackson, Bristol.
- Calcium sulphate.

1078
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:48,327
Calcium sulphate is correct.

1079
01:15:52,332 --> 01:15:54,751
<i>It's the Oresteia by Aeschylus.</i>

1080
01:15:54,834 --> 01:15:56,752
<i>The Oresteia by Aeschylus.</i>

1081
01:15:56,836 --> 01:15:58,629

1087
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,323
- Is it an Oxbow lake?
- It is indeed an Oxbow lake.

1088
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:30,119
Oh, let's just go home.

1089
01:16:30,245 --> 01:16:31,746
There still may be
just time to catch up,

1090
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,540
so here's another starter
question for ten points.

1091
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:37,126
Derived from the Greek words for
wing and finger, what is the genus...

the ora serrata,

1096
01:16:51,015 --> 01:16:55,644
- and is it the fovea centralis?
- It is indeed.

1097
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:00,024
Which American poet
and Fulbright Scholar...

1098
01:17:00,024 --> 01:17:02,026
- Harbinson, Bristol.
- Plath! Sylvia Plath.

1099
01:17:02,152 --> 01:17:04,654
Sylvia Plath is correct so
three more questions for you

1100
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:06,614
on quotations from Shakespeare.

1101
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:08,032

Come on.

1107
01:17:17,042 --> 01:17:18,752
Go with Brian.

1108
01:17:19,252 --> 01:17:22,546
<i>- Is the answer King Henry V?

1117
01:17:48,823 --> 01:17:50,115
phosphorescence...

1118
01:17:52,327 --> 01:17:53,536
Come on.

1119
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:56,414
- Incandescence.
- All correct. Amazing recovery.

1120
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:03,254
All to play for now, just five points
behind with one minute on the clock.

1121
01:18:03,338 --> 01:18:05,048
For ten points, on a
question on astronomy.

1122
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:07,633
- Jackson, Bristol.
- Ursa Major, or The Great Bear.

1123

The Big Dipper?

1124
01:18:22,649 --> 01:18:29,322
Rather amazingly, that is the correct
answer, so perhaps we'd better stop recording.

1125
01:18:33,326 --> 01:18:34,744
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

1126
01:18:34,828 --> 01:18:37,330
Does anyone know what
the hell just happened?

1127
01:18:37,414 --> 01:18:39,416
Does anybody know how he knew the answer

1128
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:41,835
when I didn't even ask
him the bloody question?

1129
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:32,426
Can we just get going, please?

1130
01:19:56,034 --> 01:20:00,038
Brian, we'll laugh about this one day.

1131
01:20:33,154 --> 01:20:34,238
Hello.

1132
01:20:35,448 --> 01:20:37,450
I'll just see if he's here.

1133
01:20:41,746 --> 01:20:43,247
No, I'm sorry.

1134
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:46,417
I'll tell him you called. Bye.

1135
01:20:49,254 --> 01:20:51,422
I don't know why you won't talk to her.

1136
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,926
You know why not. I made
a complete idiot of myself.

1137
01:20:55,135 --> 01:20:56,553
No, you didn't.

1138
01:20:56,636 --> 01:20:58,512
Mum, you were there, remember?

1139
01:20:58,638 --> 01:21:00,431
All right, you made a prat of yourself.

1140
01:21:00,515 --> 01:21:01,641
Thanks, Mum.

1141
01:21:01,725 --> 01:21:03,435
Look, Brian.

1142
01:21:03,435 --> 01:21:06,938
The people who really care about
you don't mind if you make mistakes.

1143
01:21:07,147 --> 01:21:08,940
It's what you do next that matters.

1144
01:21:09,733 --> 01:21:11,526
And if you can't see that,

1145
01:21:11,651 --> 01:21:14,028
then you're not as smart
as I thought you were.

1146
01:21:54,736 --> 01:21:56,529
There's someone here to see you.

1147
01:21:57,948 --> 01:21:59,324
I can't, Mum.

1148
01:22:00,534 --> 01:22:03,537
Brian, you've been moping around
for weeks now and I'm not having it.

1149
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:06,039
There's been far too much of
that already in this house.

1150
01:22:09,543 --> 01:22:12,254
It's Spencer. I'm not going
to tell him to go away.

1151
01:22:19,052 --> 01:22:21,345
Never thought I'd see the
day you were wearing a suit.

1152
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:24,724
The magistrate liked it. She only
gave me six months' probation.

1153
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:34,442
Hiding in the wardrobe, Spence.

1154
01:22:36,737 --> 01:22:38,029
It's not funny.

1155
01:22:38,155 --> 01:22:41,116
Well, maybe you weren't
so perfect yourself, mate.

1156
01:22:42,534 --> 01:22:44,035
I suppose not.

1157
01:22:48,415 --> 01:22:50,625
What're you still doing here, Bri?

1158
01:22:51,418 --> 01:22:54,045
- What do you mean?
- Well, why haven't you gone back yet?

1159
01:22:54,046 --> 01:22:55,714
I've gone off the idea.

1160
01:22:58,341 --> 01:23:00,634
Besides, it's all a waste of time.

1161
01:23:00,635 --> 01:23:02,637
How can it be a waste of time?

1162
01:23:02,637 --> 01:23:04,221
You've changed your tune.

1163
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:10,144
It was a waste of time for someone
like me, but you, you love it.

1164
01:23:10,437 --> 01:23:12,522
Maybe I'm just not as
clever as I thought I was.

1165
01:23:12,647 --> 01:23:14,148
Of course you're clever.

1166
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:19,445
It's just every now and then you
do some stupid things, that's all.

1167
01:23:24,242 --> 01:23:25,743
I got you this.

1168
01:23:30,624 --> 01:23:32,042
Thanks, Spence.

1169
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:33,626
Cheers.

1170
01:23:33,835 --> 01:23:36,629
It's only a tape, Brian. No
need to get all gay about it.

1171
01:23:41,551 --> 01:23:43,135
I'll see you soon, yeah?

1172
01:24:22,551 --> 01:24:23,927
Do you need more towels?

1173
01:24:24,052 --> 01:24:25,428
I've got towels, Mum.

1174
01:24:25,637 --> 01:24:27,930
Bread? Sugar? Bag of potatoes?

1175
01:24:30,017 --> 01:24:31,852
Bye, Mum.

1176
01:24:33,228 --> 01:24:35,021
See you, Des.

1177
01:24:36,231 --> 01:24:37,315
See you, Bri.

1178
01:24:39,026 --> 01:24:40,527
All right.

1179
01:24:41,737 --> 01:24:42,821
Brian.

1180
01:24:44,948 --> 01:24:49,452
Don't take this the wrong way, but
I'm really glad to see the back of you.

1181
01:24:55,834 --> 01:24:58,419
Remember. Fresh fruit.

1182
01:25:06,219 --> 01:25:11,432
<i>I admit it. I've made some
mistakes. Okay, some big mistakes.</i>

1183
01:25:12,017 --> 01:25:13,643
<i>Loads of them.</i>

1184
01:25:13,727 --> 01:25:17,021
<i>But you can't hide in your room
forever feeling sorry for yourself.</i>

1185
01:25:17,648 --> 01:25:19,441
<i>It's not practical.</i>

1186
01:25:19,524 --> 01:25:23,236
<i>At some point you've got to get
back out there, face up to things,</i>

1187
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,447
<i>and confront your demons.</i>

1188
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:28,324
Well, well. Mr Jackson.

1189
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,035
Could this possibly mean you're back?

1190
01:25:32,621 --> 01:25:33,913
Yes, if...

1191
01:25:35,415 --> 01:25:38,626
So, we'll see you tomorrow, then.

1192
01:25:41,046 --> 01:25:42,422
Thank you, Doctor.

1193
01:25:46,552 --> 01:25:50,514
<i>And yes, I've made some
bad choices, lost my head.</i>

1194
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:53,725
<i>Let people down. People I care for.</i>

1195
01:25:54,226 --> 01:25:56,853
<i>But there still might be
time to get something right.</i>

1196
01:25:59,314 --> 01:26:00,732
You came back.

1197
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:04,235
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

1198
01:26:05,028 --> 01:26:07,947
Now listen, you mustn't worry about
what people are going to say, okay?

1199
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:09,741
So you made a silly
mistake. But the thing is...

1200
01:26:09,825 --> 01:26:14,454
Can I just stop you there for a minute, Alice?
I'm sorry, but I'm looking for someone else.

1201
01:26:19,751 --> 01:26:22,920
<i>Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to be clever.</i>

1202
01:26:23,046 --> 01:26:26,632
<i>Some people are born clever the same
way some people are born beautiful.</i>

1203
01:26:26,633 --> 01:26:29,844
<i>I'm not one of those people.
I'm gonna have to work at it.</i>

1204
01:26:29,845 --> 01:26:33,515
<i>Put in the effort. And if I
mess it up, I'll learn from it.</i>

1205
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:37,435
<i>Besides, sometimes it's not
about knowing the right answer.</i>

1206
01:26:37,853 --> 01:26:40,730
<i>Sometimes it's about
asking the right question.</i>

1207
01:26:40,814 --> 01:26:43,650
<i>We want the money spent on
nuclear weapons to be brought</i>

1208
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:47,945
<i>into our health system.
Our nurseries and schools.</i>

1209
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:49,614
<i>Our universities.</i>

1210
01:26:50,616 --> 01:26:51,742
<i>What do we want?</i>

1211
01:26:51,825 --> 01:26:52,951
Nukes out.

1212
01:26:53,035 --> 01:26:54,244
<i>- When do we want it?
- Now.</i>

1213
01:26:54,328 --> 01:26:56,038
<i>- What do we want?
- Nukes out!</i>

1214
01:26:56,038 --> 01:26:57,622
<i>- When do we want it?
- Now!</i>

1215
01:26:57,623 --> 01:26:59,124
<i>- What do we want?
- Nukes out!</i>

1216
01:26:59,249 --> 01:27:00,833
<i>- When do we want it?
- Now!</i>

1217
01:27:09,843 --> 01:27:10,927
Hello.

1218
01:27:11,845 --> 01:27:13,054
Hello.

1219
01:27:13,847 --> 01:27:15,348
Think we could talk?

1220
01:27:15,432 --> 01:27:18,143
Somewhere a bit less angry?

1221
01:27:18,852 --> 01:27:21,646
All right. Yeah.

1222
01:27:27,027 --> 01:27:30,822
You've got a nerve, Brian Jackson,
not answering my phone calls.

1223
01:27:30,948 --> 01:27:34,618
Look, I know. And I'm
sorry. I just... I wanted to.

1224
01:27:34,618 --> 01:27:37,245
I just needed time to
make sense of everything.

1225
01:27:37,329 --> 01:27:40,623
I see. So does
everything make sense now?

1226
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:44,628
Yeah, almost. I just need
to ask you one question.

1227
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:51,426
Okay. One question. Ten points.

1228
01:27:52,928 --> 01:27:54,846
You think you can forgive me?

1229
01:27:55,639 --> 01:28:00,143
For all the mistakes, all the
wrong answers and stupid remarks?

1230
01:28:09,737 --> 01:28:11,947
Brian, you already know the answer.
