1
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,192
Oh, the royal coach!

2
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:41,570
Come on, Walter!

3
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,676
Get her!

4
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,597
Come on now.

5
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,409
Annyrose, Annyrose, look at these beauts.

6
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:00,272
Jemmy, they've torn it all up again.

7
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:03,458
People with doors don't have dogs in the parlor.

8
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:06,046
Look, I've promised you lodgings, haven't I?

9
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,539
~ When?
~ Soon.

10
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:10,525
Get your things and come on.

11
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,212
Proper lodgings.

12
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:19,681
You won't get a lot for those flowers I'll bet.

13
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,370
Come on, how much do you reckon, then?

14
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:24,361
Uh-oh!

15
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:26,551
Look out!

16
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:31,924
Yes!

17
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,512
Rats! Stop, stop!

18
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:41,479
My roses! Look what you did.

19
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,970
Ratcatcher, give me those rats.

20
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,166
Not likely! I won them.

21
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,553
Do you know who I am?

22
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:49,147
Who doesn't?

23
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,835
I'm Horace, prince of Brattenburg.

24
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,318
~ Prince Brat.
~ What? What did you say?

25
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:56,613
~ Prince...
~ Nothing.

26
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:59,599
~ She didn't say nothing!
~ Hand over those rats.

27
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:01,789
~ Now!
~ Catch your own rats!

28
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:03,381
I aim to sell these.

29
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:04,975
Walter, get him!

30
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:10,749
Dear me, guv...

31
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:12,935
Quick, run!

32
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:35,425
Sorry, your Highness, the little bugger gave me the slip.

33
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:39,805
I'll track you down, Ratcatcher!

34
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:55,030
Jemmy? Jemmy?

35
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:09,160
Come on. We've got business.

36
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:17,321
Come back with some money, old boyo, or don't come back.

37
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,899
~ Jemmy. Annyrose.
~ Smudger.

38
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,985
He's got a new dog. Eleven rats in three minutes.

39
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:28,549
~ Eleven rats?!
~ Yeah. So don't let Blind George fiddle you.

40
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:29,544
Thanks.

41
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,825
It's called gaming, not watching, gentlemen.

42
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:35,219
See to that.

43
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:54,324
More rats! More rats! More rats!...

44
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,858
The sound is going to put me into an early grave! We've got to do something!

45
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:09,849
Get me some more rats!

46
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:19,103
Unfortunately, I don't need no rats today.

47
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:24,080
~ Is that so? I'll call back tomorrow.
~ Hold on! Hold on!

48
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,862
Where are your manners? I didn't say I wouldn't look at them, did I?

49
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:35,027
Oh! Oh! Sickly, peaked, the lot!

50
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:38,212
Well, they'd faint at the sight of the hound.

51
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:41,496
Prime fighters. Fisher's brewery rats.

52
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:48,861
Prime fighters?! And you want to grow up to be the king of the ratcatchers like your pop?

53
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:50,255
~ Rest in peace.
~ Rest in peace.

54
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:55,004
~ Little Annyrose, she does look hungry...?
~ No I ain't.

55
00:06:55,801 --> 00:07:00,279
~ I'll give you tuppence and call myself a fool.
~ You'll give me tuppence each!

56
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:05,130
And nothing less. The prince himself had his eye on our rats.

57
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:10,048
The prince himself --- is that so! What have you been eating?

58
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:15,010
You've been feeding her cauliflower? That'll do it!
That'll addle you for the market!

59
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:20,291
More rats, more rats!

60
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,155
Nine pence.

61
00:07:27,342 --> 00:07:34,294
~ You're trying to put me in the poorhouse.
~ We'll try to stay out of it.

62
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:50,905
~ Wait! Maybe she'll buy me roses.
~ Keep your flowers. Come on!

63
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:53,662
~ Where are we going?
~ You'll see.

64
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:58,266
Ballads f or sale! Hear about the  most horrible villain the world's ever known!

65
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:01,826
Cuts up small children before they're full grown!

66
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,387
Hold-your-nose-Billy and Cutwater, his friend.

67
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:08,981
If you meet them on the highway, your life you will defend...

68
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:13,060
Hiding in the forest, they leaps out through them bones...

69
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:17,306
You'll face a brace of pistols while they help you of your gold.

70
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:21,186
~ He gave me a shiver.
~ Come on, Scaredy.

71
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:27,075
Get out and don't come back.

72
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:30,076
Go! Can you believe that bloke?

73
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:37,429
~ Mrs. Chestney, Ma'am?
~ Is that you again? What do you want?

74
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:43,436
We want to see lodgings. I told you --- I've been saving.

75
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:46,270
I've got money.

76
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,753
All right, come on up!

77
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:55,196
Go on.

78
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:06,120
~ Rent in advance, of course. That's my policy.
~ We ain't said we'd take it yet.

79
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,997
~ Oh, Jemmy, I love it.
~ There's a view from the window.

80
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:15,923
~ You call that chimney a view?
~ Can we stay?

81
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:25,519
We'll take it 'til this Wednesday.

82
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:30,686
No running up and down stairs. No shouting and no games. Understood?

83
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,689
There is a respectable house.

84
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,485
Is it true, Jemmy? Are we really live here?

85
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:42,932
It's not much of a view. We can't even see the river.

86
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:50,368
It's the best view in the world.

87
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,929
The sun's getting up. So should you.

88
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:32,823
Hey, hey get off me. What are you doing? Get off me. I ain't done nothing.

89
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:49,777
He still smells strong enough to lift a Roman.
Where did you find him, in a sewer?

90
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,509
Exactly, Molly.

91
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:55,423
~ What's the prince want him for?
~ New whipping boy.

92
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,701
Poor lad!

93
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:08,110
Leave me alone! I do not want these things. I ain't wearing these.

94
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:11,226
~ Hold still, child.
~ I ain't staying here, neither.

95
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:14,749
~ My sister don't know where I am.
~ Walter!

96
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:20,785
~ Let me go!
~ Easy, lad. Behave yourself, now.

97
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:24,188
~ You can't keep me here!
~ Tuck in your shirt, child.

98
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:31,196
~ You again?!
~ Ratcatcher, what's your name?

99
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,988
~ None of your business.
~ His name is Jemmy, your Majesty.

100
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:39,318
~ I'm clearing out.
~ But you can't, Jemmy from the street.

101
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,760
~ You're my new whipping boy.
~ Not me! What's a whipping boy?

102
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:48,031
When father wants me punished, he have you whipped in my place.

103
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:52,202
~ You mean they'll whip me instead of you?
~ Of course. ~ Why?

104
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:58,197
~ It wouldn't be proper to whip a prince...would it?
~ Why not?

105
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:03,355
I? The future king? I've never been spanked in my life.

106
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:08,685
And when you're whipped, you're to bellow, good and loud. Understood?

107
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:14,167
~ I'm not staying here.
~ Yelp and bellow. Those are my rules.

108
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,809
Furthermore, you're to bow when I enter a room.

109
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,006
Yeah, pigs will fly first!

110
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:27,307
Get off!

111
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:39,802
You can't lock me up! I ain't done nothing!

112
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:43,054
Let me out of here!

113
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:55,486
But I ain't done nothing.

114
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,496
Jemmy? Jemmy, is that you?

115
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:05,132
~ No, I ain't him.
~ Have you seen him, Smudger?

116
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,290
No, I ain't seen him. All I know is that that competition in this burg has become considerably less.

117
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,538
I can't find him anywhere!

118
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:19,057
Look, you ain't me sister, and I ain't got time for tykes. See? Time and rats wait for no man.

119
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:55,709
~ I assure you, he cannot possibly hear the peacocks from there.
~ Good, good. Now this is a very delicate situation

120
00:13:55,872 --> 00:14:00,708
~ Lord Chancellor, I want no mistakes to be made.
~ There is really no need to worry.

121
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:05,949
King Philip's ambassador confounds me, Lord Chancellor. He threatens me with war,...

122
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:09,863
yet he brought Philip's court painter to do a portrait of the Queen Mother.

123
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:13,751
He encourages compromise, yet he assumes inflexible positions.

124
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:17,870
Yes, he's a very clever and a very demanding gentleman, Your Majesty...

125
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:23,952
~ but perhaps he's trying to throw you off balance.
~ I hope that is all it is.

126
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,952
Who dares to spy upon the king? Show yourself!

127
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,275
~ Horace, what were you doing there?
~ I wanted to remind you of our chess game today, Father.

128
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:41,801
~ I've been working on my opening.
~ I'm sorry, Horace, we will not be having our chess game today.

129
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:45,717
~ I have to continue ,y talks with the ambassador.
~ But you promised...!

130
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:49,360
Leave us, Falconhurst, I'll join you in a moment.

131
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:53,434
Why can't you talk to the stupid ambassador some other time?

132
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:59,325
Horace, you know we've had a continuing dispute with Cousin Philip about the borders between our two countries.

133
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:03,358
~ So?
~ If I am to resolve our differences peaceably, it must be done quickly.

134
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:07,124
~ But you promised...
~ Horace, you are NOT listening.

135
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:10,002
You always promise, and then you're too busy.

136
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:16,126
You are old enough to know that affairs of state take precedence over royal recreation.

137
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:20,690
Could we play tomorrow?

138
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:29,527
Ambassador, welcome. Will you walk with me in the garden?

139
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:31,890
A pleasure, Your Majesty.

140
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:41,415
I am very pleased with cousin Philip, sending you along with the ambassador.

141
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:47,210
Everyone in Brattenburg has heard of your genius.

142
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:53,096
Oh, yes, and everyone has heard of the Queen Mother by Brattenburg, Your Majesty.

143
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:58,019
I was delighted when King Philip asked me to apply my poor talent...

144
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,139
to strengthen relations between our two countries.

145
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:07,133
Well said, painter. Horace, must you do that?

146
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:10,978
~ I'm bored.
! Princes are supposed to be bored.

147
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:15,735
~ It's part of the burden we have to carry.
~ Father canceled out chess game.

148
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:20,655
Kings are not free to do everything they wish. And tuck in your shirt.

149
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:24,142
The head, Your Highness.

150
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,898
I never do anything I wish.

151
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:33,300
Go and do it somewhere else. You're driving me mad!

152
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,623
Whatever is the matter with that child?

153
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,742
Let me in. I've got to see Blind George.

154
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:09,643
Ye'd better learn to fight rats, and fast. And the same goes for the rest of me fine clientele.

155
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:16,828
~ You again?
~ Blind George --- do you know where Jemmy is?

156
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,517
Likely out making a pauper of some other honest entrepreneur.

157
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,279
~ I can't find him anywhere.
~ Well, he'll turn up. I'll keep me good eye open.

158
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,957
Thanks.

159
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,761
What is that foul odor?

160
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:43,155
Melady...

161
00:17:57,808 --> 00:18:04,282
~ Do you want some garlic?
~ Mr. Bill and Mr. Cutwater...

162
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,400
~ Aye --- with the goods, too.
~ Been working, I see.

163
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:12,450
How much you give us for that?

164
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:16,810
Well, it's a fair piece...Where do you think it was made, do you think?

165
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:22,048
I do not know where it was made, sire, but it hatched for us in the Forest Lane.

166
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:30,533
~ And the original owner?
~ He used to wear his head on top.

167
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:33,933
It made him a might muddled when we moved it.

168
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,060
Where is that infernal boy?

169
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:14,620
Punctuality is the politeness of kings, but not always of princes.

170
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,697
True.

171
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:25,579
~ Are the new quarters to your liking, Your Excellency?
~ Oh, yes, Your Majesty.

172
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:29,464
I can hardly hear the peacocks.

173
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,740
May I suggest we toast the Queen Mother...

174
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,504
whose loveliness has inspired me to the highest standards of my art?

175
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:45,426
~ A toast to the Queen Mother.
~ The Queen Mother!

176
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,712
You are all too kind.

177
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:53,466
And to peace and tranquility in our two great nations.

178
00:19:54,835 --> 00:20:00,035
~ To Rittenstein.
~ And Brattenburg.

179
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,831
~ How dare you? Where have you been?
~ Helping the chef, father.

180
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:50,760
A dish in your honor, Your Excellency.

181
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,809
What is this?!

182
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:32,774
A curious embellishment for a delicate negotiation, Your Majesty.

183
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:37,535
And one which does not carry the royal sanction, I assure Your Excellency. We are deeply embarrassed.

184
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,773
Fetch the whipping boy!

185
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:48,011
Fetch whipping boy!

186
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:01,820
Come on, son, come on!

187
00:22:13,787 --> 00:22:17,178
You continue to try the royal patience, Horace!

188
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:20,739
This time, you have thoroughly offended Royal Philip's ambassador.

189
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:24,420
And you know I won't stand for this kind of behavior.

190
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,509
Let me go! Where are we going?

191
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:33,628
Six strokes!

192
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:36,791
As Your Majesty commands.

193
00:22:36,993 --> 00:22:39,461
What are you doing? You can't...!

194
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:05,272
Let this be a lesson to you. We have a kingdom to rule...

195
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:10,156
~ and it's time you understood your place in it.
~ Yes, Father.

196
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:16,072
Here's for your pains, Whipping Boy.

197
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:25,720
~ You didn't obey my rules.
~ I ain't springing no tears for you to go over.

198
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:31,039
~ You'll bawl rivers if I say so, Jemmy from the street.
~ Not by half I won't.

199
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:34,682
~ I'll have you thrown you back in the gutters.
~ Better there than here!

200
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:39,085
~ I suppose you had all those fine nice clothes and...
~ I had me friends.

201
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:43,686
~ Friends? In the sewers?
~ More friends than you.

202
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:47,598
A prince doesn't need friends.

203
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:34,209
Open the door! Let me out!

204
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:44,138
~ Give up, lad.
~ I won't stay here. They can't force me.

205
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:47,182
Unfortunately, they can.

206
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:51,815
I'm Peckwith, tutor to His Royal Highness, for my sins.

207
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:56,735
~ And you're Jemmy, new whipping boy, are you not?
~ Not for long.

208
00:24:56,945 --> 00:25:02,465
Accept it, son. You'll be well fed and clothed here. You could have an education...

209
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:07,503
But you don't understand, sir. It's my sister Annyrose --- she's all alone.

210
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:10,862
She'll be worried sick.

211
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:17,629
Good morning, Master Peckwith. I'm late again. Six strokes, do you think?

212
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,302
This once, I'll overlook it. Now --- do you have your writing book?

213
00:25:24,512 --> 00:25:31,305
No, and I haven't even practiced my letters so that's 15 strokes at least.

214
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:36,265
Your Highness, one day, you will be king.

215
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:41,675
And you can't so much as write your own name.

216
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:47,553
What's the good of being prince if I can't get someone to write my name for me?

217
00:25:49,037 --> 00:25:51,313
~ Dismissed.
~ But I haven't been punished.

218
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:55,918
~ Dismissed.
~ That's all right...

219
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:59,989
I'd rather go riding with my father, anyhow.

220
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:07,796
~ Dismissed --- that means you, too.
~ He can't even write his own name.

221
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:11,359
~ And you can, I suppose?
~ Well, not so as to be proud...

222
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:16,096
~ but I did learn my letters with my Mom. Rest in peace.
~ Rest in peace.

223
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:20,763
Do you expect me to believe that? A boy
from the street who can write?

224
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:25,118
She also taught me not to tell no lies.

225
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:29,885
Leastwise not to gentlemen.

226
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:39,399
Well, confound me, boy! You do know your alphabet.

227
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:45,009
Let me show you how to put those in the proper order.

228
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,607
~ Then you could write a letter.
~ Me? Who to?

229
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:52,408
That sister you spoke of. I'll see she gets it.

230
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:57,165
Can I put this in, so I'll know she can buy her vittles?

231
00:26:57,453 --> 00:27:00,844
Certainly. I'll get some fresh paper.

232
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:11,612
~ Mrs. Chestney? ~ Yes.
~ That's for Miss Annyrose.

233
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:16,414
I'll see she gets it, as soon as she nips back home.

234
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:22,488
What we have here, my dearie?

235
00:27:33,222 --> 00:27:36,612
Come into quite a fortune, haven't we?

236
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:41,701
The slip of a girl won't never know the difference.

237
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:50,224
God helps those who help themselves, I always say.

238
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:10,941
~ Late as usual.
~ I can't be cross with you today, Horace.

239
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,623
I'm too happy. I have been immortalized.

240
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:20,663
I'm looking forward to it, Grandmamma.

241
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:30,711
Gentlemen of the court of Brattenburg. I reveal to you my masterwork.

242
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:35,104
The portrait of the mother of your country.

243
00:28:35,356 --> 00:28:41,910
Presented as a gift of friendship gift from King Philip, by way of his distinguished ambassador.

244
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:45,986
~ Who is with us for this momentous occasion.

245
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:48,630
And now...

246
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:17,283
A unique boy.

247
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:22,802
Once again, Your Excellence, please accept the apologies of this court.

248
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:37,445
~ Fetch the whipping boy!
~ Fetch the whipping boy!

249
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:54,446
~ 12 strokes.
~ 15.

250
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:02,646
And let this be a lesson to you.

251
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:17,809
~ I told you to yelp and bellow
~ Leave me alone!

252
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,896
~ You'll yelp and bellow next time if you know what's good for you!
~ Never, never, never, never!

253
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:22,897
~ You will!
~ Never!

254
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:27,012
You are the worst whipping boy I ever had!

255
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:35,976
Jemmy?

256
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:41,982
~ Whoa, Dearie --- I've got a letter for you.
~ A letter --- all for me?

257
00:30:42,585 --> 00:30:47,138
~ Right tight, you'll notice. Carefully sealed.
~ It has to be from Jemmy.

258
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:52,177
Nobody else knows I'm alive. Would you read it to me?

259
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:55,426
I never read other folk's mail.

260
00:30:56,509 --> 00:31:01,504
I'll be needing your rent at the end of the week, Dearie. You pays up or out you go.

261
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:09,505
~ Blind George, Blind George, give it a look for me.
~ This, you say? You want me to read this?

262
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:17,547
Writing. No good can ever come of it. Who knows what's in here?

263
00:31:17,754 --> 00:31:24,149
You know, the Devil himself might have sent this. Did you ever think of that? No, child, for your own good...

264
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,865
~ Can't you read?
~ Of course I can read.

265
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:32,469
I can read the Lord's Prayer on the head of a pin if I'm of a mind to.

266
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:40,352
I get a pension from the King for not seeing, and that includes not reading.

267
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:47,239
~ Oh, please. It is from Jemmy. I know it is.
~ Oh, let's see here...

268
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:49,791
Well, it says here...

269
00:31:52,922 --> 00:31:58,156
~ Why don't you use your good eye?
~ Because I'm saving it.

270
00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:07,154
It says, um...He ran off to the Sargasso Seam Jemmy has.

271
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:13,162
~ We don't have any sea.
~ Well, he took a boat downriver.

272
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:16,717
Jemmy can't even swim. He's feared of the water.

273
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:20,967
Well, there's no need for him to be, with a stout ship under his feet. Wouldn't I know that?

274
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:23,724
Twenty years afloat I was!

275
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:28,327
It says here that he'll be back one fine day with a fortune.

276
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:34,767
In the meantime, you are to get your sleep and eat your vegetables. There you go.

277
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,928
You can't read.

278
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:46,090
God knows, sharper than a serpent's tooth is an ungrateful urchin!

279
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:10,776
~ Sir, sir? Would you read this letter for me?
~ Get away from me, you little guttersnipe.

280
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,456
~ Or I'll have the guards on you.
~ Oh, could you please??

281
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:22,781
~ Sir, your handkerchief!
~ Thief. Thief!

282
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:30,182
Here, I was thinking to hand it back to you, and none to clean it is, neither.

283
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:35,620
Cheeky little strumpet! She lifted my handkerchief right out of pocket.

284
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:39,820
I did no such thing. It fell out. I ain't fibbing!

285
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:42,257
Well?

286
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:48,865
Come along. The king's justice takes a dim view of thieves.

287
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:52,346
I ain't no thief! Let me go!

288
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:20,190
This is very impressive. You had a good teacher in your mother.

289
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:22,552
~ Rest in peace.
~ Rest in peace.

290
00:35:16,689 --> 00:35:18,840
Enter.

291
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:25,683
~ It's Prince Horace, Father.
~ Horace, what are you doing here?

292
00:35:26,411 --> 00:35:30,200
Why are you dressed like that? Shouldn't you be at your lesson?

293
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:36,330
~ Look, Father, new boots. Just like yours.
~ They're very splendid. Wherever did you get them?

294
00:35:37,174 --> 00:35:40,724
You ordered them, Father --- from the royal bootmaker.

295
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:44,286
Yes, yes, of course I did...

296
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:51,928
~ Can we go riding? ~ Now?
~ Please, can we?

297
00:35:52,257 --> 00:35:58,494
~ Not now, Horace. There's much to be done.
~ This afternoon, then? Please?

298
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,850
~ I'll have the Lord Chancellor put it on my agenda.
~ Promise?

299
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:09,610
Without fail.

300
00:36:15,863 --> 00:36:20,142
Four years in Waldbach Prison. Next!

301
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:28,016
~ Your first offense, I see.
~ No, sir, I never stole nothing in my life.

302
00:36:28,546 --> 00:36:35,498
Confession is good for the soul, child. I have been known to reduce sentence if only people would tell me the truth.

303
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:39,465
But I didn't nick that hanky, sir!

304
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:45,466
We have a sworn affidavit here from a most substantial citizen that says otherwise.

305
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,830
Three years in Waldbach Prison.

306
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:56,222
But I didn't, sir! I didn't!

307
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:59,431
Next, and quickly!

308
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:04,950
Da Vinci's assumption was that if one could construct a winged apparatus...

309
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:11,072
which had the essential qualities of a bird, one could duplicate the phenomenon of flight.

310
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:14,307
I have it, sir!

311
00:37:15,557 --> 00:37:19,915
I'm not sure if Mister da Vinci would approve.

312
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:25,274
But I suppose we should try it.

313
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,270
Let it go! Scientists must be daring.

314
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:40,357
~ Look, sir, look! It's flying!
~ Indeed it is!

315
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:44,157
Here, look at that!

316
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:48,681
Come now, come on, my girl!

317
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:54,760
I have to get down there! Let go of me!

318
00:37:54,926 --> 00:37:58,602
~ Jemmy, what is it, lad?
~ It's Annyrose!

319
00:38:00,687 --> 00:38:06,479
~ That's my sister down there.
~ Hardly, lad. Those are prisoners, judged and sentenced.

320
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:09,237
And on their way to Waldbach Prison.

321
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:21,369
Jemmy, I think our first flight was a great success.

322
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:28,605
Now, other designs of Mister da Vinci are much more elaborate.

323
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:37,644
Keep buffing them, Walter, until they shine like Father's!

324
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:43,888
A message from His Majesty, Your Highness. I'm sorry to inform you...

325
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:48,330
that the press of events has obliged His Majesty to postpone your outing today.

326
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:52,578
~ But he promised!
~ He did, and His Majesty regrets, but...

327
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:59,099
he must ride with the ambassador to discuss counter-proposal on boundaries.

328
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:02,619
He promised...!

329
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:18,257
Your Excellency, we'll ride by the river. I hope you'll like the stallion.

330
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:41,386
Your Excellency. Thank Providence you are unhurt. Who is responsible for this? How could this happen?

331
00:39:45,912 --> 00:39:48,745
Goose grease...

332
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:56,744
An insult to me, and an affront to my royal master, King Philip.

333
00:39:56,954 --> 00:40:02,666
Your Excellency, once again, please accept our most humble apologies.

334
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:08,993
~ King Philip did not sent me to collect the royal apologies, Your Majesty.
~ Your Excellency...

335
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:16,154
What I took to be the thoughtless conduct of am overly spirited boy seems to have a disturbing pattern.

336
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,072
~ Your Excellency, I can assure you it is pure coincidence.
~ That is of no consequence now.

337
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,435
Diplomacy has failed. More drastic measures may be in order.

338
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:30,919
I'll return to my country immediately.

339
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:41,199
Come here.

340
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:44,363
Do you understand what you have done?

341
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:49,801
You have endangered our entire kingdom. I thought I was raising a prince.

342
00:40:50,006 --> 00:40:54,000
~ Father...
~ Silence! I am at my limit, Horace!

343
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:58,884
There will be no whipping boy for you this time.
You yourself will be severely punished

344
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,042
~ Punish me?
~ Yes, You are willful, spoiled, and not fit to inherit this kingdom!

345
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:08,446
not fit to inherit this kingdom! Now go to your chambers.

346
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:23,205
Clever of him to use his son like that to humiliate us.

347
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:27,807
~ It defies all conventions of diplomacy.
~ The poxy brat!

348
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:33,053
~ Why did you bring that?
~ Perhaps I can repair it.

349
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:36,886
The horse is really good.

350
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,979
~ Why are we stopping?
~ Do you smell something?

351
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
Stand and deliver!

352
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,891
~ Highwaymen!
~ And a pleasant evening to you, fine gentlemen.

353
00:41:58,222 --> 00:42:00,817
Today is your good fortune.

354
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:06,377
You have been detained by them two world-famous paladins of the open road!

355
00:42:06,544 --> 00:42:12,655
Hold-your-nose Billy and Cutwater. I give you me congratulations.

356
00:42:12,826 --> 00:42:18,982
Now, if you would be so kind as to pass down some of that expensive-looking baggage, me good man,...

357
00:42:24,548 --> 00:42:27,621
Excuse me, sir. Do you know who I am?

358
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,941
I think not.

359
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:48,628
Whipping Boy!

360
00:42:51,555 --> 00:42:54,069
Wake up...!

361
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,549
~ So there you are.
~ What are you doing here?

362
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:15,110
I'm running away and I need a manservant.

363
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,833
Ain't going to be me. Me sister's in Waldbach Prison, and I'm going to get her out.

364
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:26,680
~ Small matter to me where we go.
~ "We" ain't going nowhere! Now leave me be.

365
00:43:28,043 --> 00:43:33,243
I know where Waldbach Prison is. I'll wager you don't.

366
00:43:33,684 --> 00:43:38,156
You stupid whipping boy! You'll never leave here without my help.

367
00:43:38,406 --> 00:43:42,319
I know how to past the guards.

368
00:43:45,727 --> 00:43:50,563
Well, bring the basket.

369
00:43:54,464 --> 00:43:56,364
* Quiet, he'll hear you!

370
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,046
~ King's business, soldier.
~ Open up!

371
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:31,812
How long we got to do this? I can't get me breath.

372
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:41,169
~ I think we're lost.
~ You told me you knew the way to Waldbach Prison.

373
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,691
~ So?
~ That does it! I quit!

374
00:44:44,901 --> 00:44:49,259
~ From here on I can go faster on me own.
~ Wait! Stay here, I command you.

375
00:44:49,662 --> 00:44:54,578
You command nothing. I only went along because you said you could help me find my sister.

376
00:44:54,823 --> 00:44:59,454
If your sister's in Waldbach Prison, she's a murderer or a thief.

377
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:04,344
She's neither one. And you run away of your own self.

378
00:45:06,546 --> 00:45:10,142
I command you not to leave me here alone!

379
00:45:12,987 --> 00:45:17,140
I command you not to leave me here alone!

380
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:24,309
Do you smell something bad? Ow --- get your hands off me!

381
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:30,947
~ What are you doing?
~ I've got me another one, Mister B!

382
00:45:34,112 --> 00:45:39,313
~ Let go or I'll have you flogged.
~ Belt up, or I'll give you a cuff you'll never forget!

383
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:43,954
~ Sparrows is all...food for pigs.
~ Let me go!

384
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:50,389
Now, now, young sir. A true gentleman of the road is my friend Billy here...

385
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:55,990
but a stickler for good manners! You don't want to be taking the wrong side of him!

386
00:45:56,197 --> 00:46:03,150
~ Hold-your-nose Billy and Cutwater.
~ The very ones, young sir.

387
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:08,514
Famed in song, verse, and the annals of criminality.

388
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:16,111
~ Hey, they have some fine victuals.
~ Leave that alone! That's our lunch!

389
00:46:16,282 --> 00:46:19,798
La-di-da saddle on a fine beast, too.

390
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:25,199
Bright plumage for sparrows.

391
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:29,320
Mayhap we have ourselves a real prize here, Mister B.

392
00:46:29,565 --> 00:46:33,764
What you'll have is your heads in a basket if you don't let us go.

393
00:46:33,966 --> 00:46:36,959
I'm the crown prince.

394
00:46:38,647 --> 00:46:42,163
And I'm the grand turnip of China.

395
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:46,647
We've topped a few ourselves, boy, so you'd better think on being more polite.

396
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:52,248
~ Polite to rogues, scoundrels, and thieves?
~ You forgot "vicious murderers".

397
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:55,363
But only in the line of duty.

398
00:46:57,332 --> 00:47:02,407
Skin me! That there is the royal crest!

399
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:07,483
~ I told you, didn't I?
~ Oh, dear.

400
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:13,333
~ We stole it.
~ Aye, but first you packed a pretty picnic basket, hey?

401
00:47:14,336 --> 00:47:18,694
~ We stole that, too!
~ I'm not a thief, I tell you! I'm Prince Horace,...

402
00:47:18,897 --> 00:47:24,495
heir to the throne of Brattenburg. And if you know what's good for you, you'll bow down.

403
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:29,688
A word, Mister B. ...

404
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,740
Aye --- if you try to flee, it'll go hard on you!

405
00:47:40,222 --> 00:47:44,057
~ The lad's tiresome enough to be a prince.
~ What suitable ransom do you think?

406
00:47:44,183 --> 00:47:49,383
His weight in gold. Everyone agrees that's the usual ransom.

407
00:47:49,584 --> 00:47:51,973
No more, no less.

408
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:56,897
90 pounds.

409
00:47:57,506 --> 00:48:04,026
Oh, you're as good at measurement as ever was, Mister B. I count on your discernment.

410
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:19,989
~ 93.
~ Oh, you couldn't get a fairer verdict in church, says I!

411
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:25,826
Mount up, lads! We got grand plans for you.

412
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:29,952
We'll be dog rich, we will.

413
00:48:33,474 --> 00:48:37,912
I'm not going in there! I demand you let me go!

414
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:41,910
Let you go? Not likely, boy!

415
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:56,110
The first requirement for seeking ransom, Mister B., is a ransom note.

416
00:48:56,279 --> 00:49:00,637
~ And that could present a difficulty.
~ Didn't we steal an inkwell once?

417
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,631
Last night --- what we took off them toffs.

418
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:11,955
Paper...Pen, ink, wax.

419
00:49:12,163 --> 00:49:17,284
The ones that had the painting of the lady and a horse...! I like that.

420
00:49:17,484 --> 00:49:22,718
There's a more vexing problem, Mister B. Who's going to do the scribblement?

421
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:25,599
We can't write.

422
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:43,121
Gentlemen born though we is, Mister B. nor I never did have much in the way of an education.

423
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:50,281
So, young sir, you'll write the ransom note.

424
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:54,731
I don't take orders from villains and cutthroats.

425
00:49:55,053 --> 00:50:02,006
Now --- think of your poor old dad...He'd be very much obliged to know you're safe and hardy.

426
00:50:02,535 --> 00:50:07,564
Now do us that document, or I'll shoot off a toe or two. And then your fingers...

427
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:10,689
...And then your ears, and then your nose!

428
00:50:10,897 --> 00:50:16,848
Mister B., Mister B., you're frightening the poor lad. Now I'm sure that if we just talk to him real nice...

429
00:50:17,018 --> 00:50:20,216
~ No, I won't!
~ He can't write.

430
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:27,139
And crows don't caw. Princes and the like are learned to write when they're tots. Now hop to it, boy.

431
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:32,053
He's right. I can't so much as scratch my own name.

432
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:36,660
~ Are you trying to pull the wool...?
~ Give it to me. I'll write it.

433
00:50:36,863 --> 00:50:41,494
~ You? ~ That's right. My whipping boy's a wizard with letters. Try him.

434
00:50:46,065 --> 00:50:50,059
~ What are you thinking, Mister C?
~ There's something amiss here.

435
00:50:50,346 --> 00:50:54,499
~ The shipping boy writes but the prince don't?
~ I smelt it right off.

436
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:58,343
They're trying to flummox us by taking each other's parts.

437
00:51:00,588 --> 00:51:04,741
Now --- no more playing us for fools, you hear?

438
00:51:05,189 --> 00:51:08,580
Certain as eggs is eggs, you're the prince!

439
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:12,659
Him? He's my servant. An ignorant street boy!

440
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:16,069
Ignorant? He can write!

441
00:51:17,112 --> 00:51:20,901
My whipping boy ain't got the sense of a gnat.

442
00:51:21,113 --> 00:51:25,630
I'd be obliged if you sent him to the castle with the note.
So's I'll be shed of him.

443
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:31,472
You witless guttersnipe! How dare you! He's an imposter. I'm the prince!

444
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:34,474
Not a peep. There's business being done.

445
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:41,117
Now what we want is Your Royal Highness's weight in gold. That's exactly 93 pounds.

446
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:43,633
~ 93...
~ Uh-oh...

447
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,433
~ 87. Exactly.
~ We'll stick with the 93.

448
00:51:57,601 --> 00:52:03,553
Now: make it known to the King that we're desperate men.

449
00:52:03,763 --> 00:52:08,758
You'll take the desperate measures...

450
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:13,721
if you don't get the ransom.

451
00:52:14,325 --> 00:52:18,956
That's the spirit! Tell him we're...dangerous men.

452
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:23,206
With reserved places in Hell, you might say!

453
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:28,799
I refuse to be ransomed for a paltry 93 pounds in gold!

454
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:33,447
My father'll pay far more than that.

455
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:38,207
You won't be ransomed no ways. If we didn't have use of you to carry that message...

456
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:41,370
I'd wear your head for a hat.

457
00:52:45,052 --> 00:52:48,250
~ Perhaps there's a better plan.
~ You fool!

458
00:52:48,413 --> 00:52:52,009
Can't you see I've got their brains so muddled they'd turn you loose?

459
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:56,845
~ I don't wish to go home.
~ This isn't some kind of lark.

460
00:52:57,135 --> 00:53:00,287
If you stay here, they kill you.

461
00:53:02,776 --> 00:53:07,568
This is a disaster. Who knows what cousin Philip's reaction will be?

462
00:53:07,738 --> 00:53:14,133
Nevertheless, your compromise was well received by
his ambassador, Your Majesty.

463
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:18,373
Lord Chancellor, the ambassador left here aggrieved and insulted.

464
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,533
I don't think he'll recommend any plan of mine to Philip.

465
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:28,653
~ What is it?
~ Forgive me, Sire. We've searched the entire castle. There's not a sign of His Royal Highness

466
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:34,981
~ The prince didn't come to his lesson, Your Majesty.
~ Is that so unusual?

467
00:53:35,184 --> 00:53:40,657
~ I'm sure you'll find him somewhere.
~ There's also a horse missing from your royal stables, Sire.

468
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:46,339
~ And I'm afraid the whipping boy's gone, too, Sire.
~ Yes, well, gentlemen: look again.

469
00:53:46,547 --> 00:53:51,064
Children often hide when they're sulking. I was a but harsh with Prince Horace yesterday.

470
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,981
I'm sure they'll turn up.

471
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:59,300
Now, where were we, the Chancellor? I do not know what move we should make next.

472
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:04,750
"Your obedient son, Prince Orris..."

473
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:10,151
~ "Horace."
~ of Brattenburg.

474
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:22,984
Here...

475
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:32,989
Here...what we took off one of them toffs.

476
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,791
The seal gives it importance.

477
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:04,321
~ Now you watch them boys. They're slippery.
~ I treat them like they was my own.

478
00:55:04,525 --> 00:55:08,485
Until we're ready to feed them to the bears.

479
00:55:08,686 --> 00:55:11,200
~ Dog Rich!
~ Hog rich!

480
00:55:11,406 --> 00:55:14,843
How are we going to keep from picking our own pockets?

481
00:55:16,728 --> 00:55:19,640
Too small...you stay if you want.

482
00:55:19,808 --> 00:55:24,803
When Cutwater returns, you tell him I went up that chimney.

483
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:29,201
You'll leave me here alone? Your Prince?

484
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:37,889
What were you saying? Where's the prince?

485
00:55:38,093 --> 00:55:43,214
~ My whipping boy is over there.
~ Where? Where is he?

486
00:55:44,494 --> 00:55:51,095
~ In the straw!
~ Ah, you little blackguard! Come back here!

487
00:55:54,536 --> 00:56:00,693
He's only a whipping boy. I'm the prince!

488
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:09,658
Hold, you treacherous brat!

489
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,730
Come back here!

490
00:56:22,223 --> 00:56:25,181
Stop and take your punishment!

491
00:56:54,710 --> 00:57:00,230
You don't stand a tinker's chance, boy. I've got the eyes of a hawk!

492
00:57:12,955 --> 00:57:16,630
Nobody gives old cutwater the slip.

493
00:57:46,882 --> 00:57:49,272
Whipping Boy?

494
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:56,398
Jemmy?

495
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:17,362
Bear! A bear...!

496
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,561
Think.

497
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:31,009
Drop the basket. Drop the basket.

498
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:35,089
Drop the basket!

499
00:58:41,095 --> 00:58:46,612
Come on! Come on! Quick!

500
00:58:54,498 --> 00:59:00,096
~ You're thick as a post. How'd you get to be a prince?
~ I was born to it.

501
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:04,816
~ And you pinched on me, too!
~ You were going to desert me.

502
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,011
I should have let the bear eat you.

503
00:59:09,582 --> 00:59:13,496
Open the gates! It's a royal horse!

504
00:59:21,944 --> 00:59:24,618
Easy now!

505
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:38,420
~ I've decided to forgive you for deserting me, Whipping Boy.
~ I don't care in. I'm on me way.

506
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:42,343
~ But I haven't dismissed you from my service.
~ I've dismissed myself.

507
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:45,468
~ Petunia?
~ Watch out!

508
00:59:50,831 --> 00:59:56,669
Petunia? Petunia?

509
00:59:56,953 --> 00:59:58,944
Come to Betsy.

510
00:59:59,313 --> 01:00:03,944
Petunia? Petunia?

511
01:00:06,195 --> 01:00:10,826
I've got some comb honey, Petunia. May the devil take me...!

512
01:00:10,996 --> 01:00:15,593
~ We mean you no harm, Miss. We're lost.
~ Are you lost coming from or going to?

513
01:00:15,757 --> 01:00:19,467
We're going to Waldbach Prison, to save me sister Annyrose. She's innocent.

514
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:24,034
Aren't we all? Well, it's that way through the forest. Just follow the river.

515
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:28,870
~ We couldn't find the river.
~ You two are on the way to being hopeless.

516
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,400
It's where it always has been. Between the trees there, just follow it.

517
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:37,794
~ Thank you, Miss.
~ Hold on --- whyever were you hiding like that?

518
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:42,201
We were chased by some villains and then a huge ferocious man-eating bear!

519
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:48,081
~ A bear? A dancing bear?
~ Well, it wasn't dancing when we saw it.

520
01:00:48,365 --> 01:00:51,994
~ It's over there --- having a picnic.
~ Our picnic.

521
01:00:52,205 --> 01:00:56,199
Much obliged to you. Petunia?

522
01:00:56,486 --> 01:01:02,961
I recognize the ink, the paper. And look: the royal seal of King Philip.

523
01:01:03,808 --> 01:01:08,564
~ I can't believe it!
~ Sire, consider the language.

524
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:13,649
Did not the ambassador warn us of desperate measures...

525
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:16,564
when he left us so abruptly?

526
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:21,169
~ True enough.
~ And he has a well-deserved reputation for using headstrong tactics.

527
01:01:22,853 --> 01:01:28,884
The conclusion is inescapable: the ambassador has kidnapped your son.

528
01:01:29,214 --> 01:01:35,484
~ By why? Why would he ask for gold?
~ To embarrass our sovereign. To make a mockery of our kingdom.

529
01:01:36,896 --> 01:01:39,774
He is using this as a provocation.

530
01:01:39,977 --> 01:01:44,972
He has already intimated that King Philip is bent on war.

531
01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:49,777
He made the poor boy write it himself.

532
01:01:49,979 --> 01:01:54,178
What are you talking about? Horace didn't write that.

533
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:00,615
~ Of course he did, Mother. Here's his signature.
~ Your son cannot write.

534
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:05,217
Why didn't...why didn't you tell me?

535
01:02:07,663 --> 01:02:12,294
Your Majesty, with all due respect...I tried.

536
01:02:16,865 --> 01:02:19,141
Should I marshal the army, Sire?

537
01:02:20,986 --> 01:02:26,698
No. Send out a patrol. Try to intercept the ambassador before he reaches the border.

538
01:02:27,307 --> 01:02:31,426
Let us hope cousin Philip has no part in this and there may yet be peace.

539
01:02:31,588 --> 01:02:34,786
But above all: find my son.

540
01:02:46,752 --> 01:02:53,022
~ Mister B. ...
~ How come you ain't guarding them boys?

541
01:02:53,274 --> 01:02:56,903
~ They slipped way.
~ Say what happened.

542
01:02:57,074 --> 01:03:00,385
~ Or I'll pull your arms off.
~ I'm here to tell.

543
01:03:00,635 --> 01:03:06,872
A huge creature, Mister B., the most fiercesome I've ever seen...like a bear.

544
01:03:07,077 --> 01:03:11,515
But much, much larger! More like a hippopotamus with fur, it was.

545
01:03:11,758 --> 01:03:14,910
Cutwater, you skinny lying scum!

546
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,915
Look! Look!

547
01:03:32,043 --> 01:03:37,118
~ Does it look like gold to you?
~ More like trouble for the likes of us.

548
01:03:37,324 --> 01:03:41,796
~ Them boys foxed us good.
~ And you're the one that let them run free!

549
01:03:42,005 --> 01:03:45,078
The only thing to do is get them again!

550
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:52,600
Aye. Only this time, we'll know how to treat them.

551
01:03:57,929 --> 01:04:03,288
~ I'm hungry.
~ You're a prince. Go order up a banquet somewheres.

552
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:09,484
~ And I'm tired.
~ And I'm tired of dealing with you. Go home.

553
01:04:09,611 --> 01:04:12,080
Look out! Soldiers!

554
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:26,807
~ They're looking for us.
~ Looking for you. They'll get me in the bargain.

555
01:04:30,216 --> 01:04:34,847
Ain't you had enough of this running away? Why don't you just call to them?

556
01:04:35,057 --> 01:04:38,130
I don't want to go home.

557
01:04:55,862 --> 01:05:02,622
~ I didn't know you could catch fish with your hands.
~ You would have if you'd asked me.

558
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:20,626
Get it, get it!

559
01:05:25,429 --> 01:05:27,385
I got it!

560
01:05:49,354 --> 01:05:53,109
~ I got one!
~ This is better than eating them!

561
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:06,955
I've got one, I've got one!

562
01:06:47,088 --> 01:06:50,525
~ Give me a hand.
~ What do you want me to do?

563
01:06:50,729 --> 01:06:55,485
~ Blow.
~ How am I supposed to know that?

564
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:58,488
You ain't got the sense of a flea.

565
01:07:31,138 --> 01:07:36,133
~ That wasn't a very nice thing to say.
~ What? ~ That I'm stupid.

566
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:40,814
~ I never said you were stupid.
~ That's what you meant.

567
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:46,494
And just because I don't know how to make a fire, doesn't mean I'm stupid.

568
01:07:46,782 --> 01:07:52,813
Look, I'm just trying to say that if you want warm clothes and a fish supper, you  better give me a hand.

569
01:07:52,983 --> 01:07:58,695
~ I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
~ It's OK. What kind of fish are these?

570
01:07:58,864 --> 01:08:00,981
The kind you eat.

571
01:08:02,785 --> 01:08:08,100
They're trout. Now help me clean them --- or we'll never eat them.

572
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:59,150
Why do you think your sister's in Waldbach Prison?

573
01:08:59,318 --> 01:09:04,030
Not for doing no harm top no one, I can tell you. We taught her right from wrong.

574
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,919
~ Who did?
~ Me and me mom.

575
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:13,279
~ How come your mother doesn't get her out?
~ Winter fever carried her away.

576
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,438
Rest in peace.

577
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:21,720
Mine was thrown by a horse. Rest in peace.

578
01:09:29,645 --> 01:09:33,195
Your father must be having a fit by now.

579
01:09:34,127 --> 01:09:37,756
I might as well be stuffed and hung on a wall like a stag's head...

580
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:43,447
~ for all he notices me.
~ But you've got to go back. You're a prince.

581
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:49,962
I might never go back. This is the best time I've ever had.

582
01:10:35,021 --> 01:10:39,698
You know, Mama, he's becoming quite a good chess player.

583
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:44,581
~ Who would have thought I'd miss him so much?
~ I know.

584
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:57,622
~ Can't you walk a little slower?
~ Can't you walk a little faster?

585
01:11:07,308 --> 01:11:12,508
~ Stop! Stop!
~ Whoa!! Who calls? Whoa!!

586
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:19,186
Sir, would you take a passenger, please? I need to get to Waldbach to save my sister.

587
01:11:19,391 --> 01:11:22,702
Hop on up! Saving sisters is serious business.

588
01:11:26,433 --> 01:11:32,953
I'm going to the market meself. I'm selling God's most amazing fruit: potatoes.

589
01:11:33,074 --> 01:11:36,829
Captain Nip's specialty. These I have in here are the finest in the world.

590
01:11:36,995 --> 01:11:40,955
Stop! Wait for me! Stop!

591
01:11:44,557 --> 01:11:48,836
Captain Nip. Please stop! We left me friend behind.

592
01:11:48,998 --> 01:11:52,787
Well, why didn't you say? We can't have that, can we? Whoa, whoa!

593
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,190
"My friend"?

594
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:07,152
Good lads, now the two of you. Hop in back. You won't harm the potatoes none.

595
01:12:07,362 --> 01:12:09,593
They're tough as a sailor ashore!

596
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:18,519
Quit your grinning at me!

597
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,420
Dinner's up, ladies!

598
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:43,967
~ Oh, what are you in for, Dearie?
~ For not pinching a noserag.

599
01:12:44,371 --> 01:12:48,729
Dinner! We get free food in here. It's that grand?

600
01:12:50,252 --> 01:12:52,813
~ Come and get your slops.
~ I ain't eating...

601
01:12:53,013 --> 01:12:56,050
until they admit I'm innocent.

602
01:13:08,296 --> 01:13:13,052
~ Hey, Gypsy, have you seen anyone like this on the road?
~ What's he wanted for, sir?

603
01:13:13,297 --> 01:13:18,931
~ That's Prince. Can't you read?
~ No, no, more's the pity. I never had the time.

604
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:23,859
But he can read the signs and all, you know.

605
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:29,612
~ Look out!
~ Please, Your Worship, put away the firearm.

606
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:34,492
~ I did see the prince, now that you mention it.
~ Where?

607
01:13:36,863 --> 01:13:40,903
In the royal carriage. Cuddles in his blessed mother's arms.

608
01:13:41,344 --> 01:13:43,984
Why is it you can never get sense out of a gypsy?

609
01:13:44,745 --> 01:13:48,341
Because you're up there, Your Worship, and we're down here.

610
01:13:49,546 --> 01:13:52,379
Witless fool!

611
01:14:12,751 --> 01:14:17,462
~ Whoa!
~ Stand and deliver! Raise them high!
~ And be quick about it!

612
01:14:17,672 --> 01:14:20,312
Remember, it's me they want, not you.

613
01:14:20,513 --> 01:14:22,549
Stand and deliver, I say! Come on!

614
01:14:22,754 --> 01:14:26,064
Potatoes --- that's all I'm carrying. Would you like them with salt or pepper?

615
01:14:26,274 --> 01:14:31,475
~ We're looking for two runaway apprentices.
~ Apprentice Highwaymen?

616
01:14:32,116 --> 01:14:34,107
There's always something new in the world.

617
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:38,116
Well look what's here! The young whipping boy hisself.

618
01:14:41,758 --> 01:14:45,195
~ Well, where is he? Where's your master?
~ I don't know.

619
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:51,236
~ You don't know? Come on, I'll shake it out of you!
~ I don't know and I wouldn't tell you if I did.

620
01:14:53,081 --> 01:14:56,630
Haroo --- here's the potato we're after!

621
01:14:58,602 --> 01:15:01,675
Come here, me young sir. Come here.

622
01:15:03,923 --> 01:15:08,315
* That's enough now. Man on mere boys. You'll deal with Captain Benedict Nip of the Queen's Ar...

623
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:16,677
~ Now what did you write in that poxy letter?
~ I don't get your meaning.

624
01:15:16,886 --> 01:15:20,004
You don't, do you? Well, you'd better begin to.

625
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:25,846
That wasn't gold coming out of your old fellow's castle --- it was soldiers! Soldiers!

626
01:15:26,248 --> 01:15:30,879
~ Which means no good for the likes of us.
~ I don't have nothing --- nothing to say.

627
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:36,481
I'm going to lay a whipping on you you'll never forget.

628
01:15:36,651 --> 01:15:43,330
A word, Mister B. Now there's mayhap good reason that gentry don't whip their own.

629
01:15:44,372 --> 01:15:49,084
They have reasons for everything they do, even though some are a mite peculiar.

630
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:55,967
~ Aye. What do you think?
~ Do what they do. Whip the whipping boy.

631
01:15:56,175 --> 01:15:59,373
Like the gentlemen we are.

632
01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:16,975
Hey! Stop it! Put me down!
Oh, what are you doing? Let me go!

633
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:21,732
~ Let him alone. I'm the prince!
~ And he's the whipping boy.

634
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:25,451
You won't fox us again, young sir. We know what's proper.

635
01:16:30,383 --> 01:16:37,336
~ Why are you holding that boy upside down?
~ Fits. Gets terrible fits if we don't rush the blood to his head.

636
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:45,259
~ Shake him again, Mister B.!
~ Have you seen the prince on this road?

637
01:16:45,907 --> 01:16:49,503
~ What's he look like?
~ Like a prince, you fool.

638
01:16:49,668 --> 01:16:52,660
~ You mean with a crown and all?
~ Witless fool!

639
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:02,779
~ Lay on hard!
~ Stop, stop!

640
01:17:02,991 --> 01:17:06,108
Do not tell them a thing! I command you.

641
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:09,344
You command? You're not better than us!

642
01:17:16,154 --> 01:17:21,468
Put a bit more sting into it, Mister C. You didn't raise a peep out of him.

643
01:17:29,197 --> 01:17:32,109
What's going on here?

644
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:36,678
Go on, take them!

645
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:43,636
Go on, cry out! I won't tell anyone.

646
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:57,358
Shoot it!

647
01:17:57,883 --> 01:18:00,637
No!

648
01:18:04,605 --> 01:18:07,484
Run, run!

649
01:18:08,126 --> 01:18:10,196
Yes! Good girl!

650
01:18:17,488 --> 01:18:20,481
Don't leave me here! Wait!

651
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:29,480
You should have given them what they wanted. And cried out!

652
01:18:29,651 --> 01:18:33,327
~ You never did.
~ Fair enough...

653
01:18:39,853 --> 01:18:42,846
Where are they? I'll beat them red and blue!

654
01:18:43,534 --> 01:18:49,246
I crush their coconuts! Blackguards! Where'd they go?

655
01:18:53,616 --> 01:18:57,246
~ Betsy, is it you here, darling?
~ Yes, it's me.

656
01:18:57,537 --> 01:19:01,497
You can rest easy. Petunia ran them off, good and proper.

657
01:19:03,499 --> 01:19:08,733
A happy thing for them they didn't contend with the Captain of the Queen's Own. I'd have paid them back ten for one!

658
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:14,571
I have here herbs and ogrun. Let me treat where they put those stripes on you.

659
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:22,302
Sweet Betsy. Light of my eyes! Where've you been? I looked for you at the fair at Grosport..

660
01:19:23,423 --> 01:19:29,694
I keep losing you, darling. So marry me and you'll have potatoes every day for the rest of your life.

661
01:19:29,985 --> 01:19:33,058
Don't be daft.

662
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:39,575
Excuse me. I am grateful, but we got to get to Waldbach right away.

663
01:19:39,747 --> 01:19:45,459
~ Is it straight down the road?
~ Bless you, boy. Aren't we all going there?

664
01:20:13,955 --> 01:20:17,710
~ Just past the cathedral, boys. You can't miss it.
~ Thanks!

665
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:46,356
Well --- we're here.

666
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:58,715
~ What do you want?
~ Me little sister's in there.

667
01:20:58,885 --> 01:21:01,400
I need to see the governor.

668
01:21:09,048 --> 01:21:13,247
~ Well?
~ Please, sir...me sister's only eight years of age --- and she's innocent!

669
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:15,804
Innocent?

670
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:20,965
Jemmy, let me see to it.

671
01:21:22,971 --> 01:21:26,487
~ Open up!
~ What now?

672
01:21:26,692 --> 01:21:30,732
I command you to allow us to enter. I am your prince.

673
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:34,131
Prince of ragamuffins! Clear out!

674
01:21:34,694 --> 01:21:39,371
I'm the missing Prince Horace. I demand you to let us in!

675
01:21:42,135 --> 01:21:47,928
Let my sister out! Annyrose! Annyrose!

676
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:06,210
~ Jemmy --- we'll think of something. I know we will.
~ I've lost my sister for good.

677
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:08,858
It's me own fault...

678
01:22:16,183 --> 01:22:20,063
~ I know a way.
~ Not likely.

679
01:22:20,664 --> 01:22:27,617
I do. I'll ask my father to pardon
Annyrose. A king can pardon anyone.

680
01:22:28,226 --> 01:22:33,017
You'd do that? But you'd have to go back to the castle.

681
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:39,426
Royals cannot always do what it wishes. Come on. Come on!

682
01:23:04,195 --> 01:23:08,154
~ We need some silver.
~ What do you have for me?

683
01:23:08,355 --> 01:23:13,385
~ Nothing.
~ More of a nature of a loan betwixt gentlemen.

684
01:23:13,797 --> 01:23:18,872
~ But what...What would this loan be for, might I ask?
~ Horses.

685
01:23:19,598 --> 01:23:24,878
Well, of course, of course. I can see it would be embarrassing in your profession not to have any.

686
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:30,838
It wouldn't be impolite to ask what prospects do you have for repaying this loan?

687
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:34,915
Not that I have any I doubts, you understand. But what are your prospects?

688
01:23:36,522 --> 01:23:39,117
Show him, Mister B.

689
01:23:45,844 --> 01:23:49,884
We had the young prince here twice in our hands.

690
01:23:50,085 --> 01:23:53,476
But he gave us the slip. But we aims to get him again.

691
01:23:54,606 --> 01:24:00,240
~ The other lad here is his whipping boy.
~ Aye. And we whipped him good, too, when the price gave us trouble.

692
01:24:04,008 --> 01:24:09,448
~ You flogged this boy?
~ Right, the whipping boy, yes. It's a way to much him up, it is.

693
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:16,842
Gentlemen, this is the prince you whipped. The other is a  street boy from around these parts here.

694
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:21,283
We flogged the wrong boy!

695
01:24:22,653 --> 01:24:28,206
No greater offense there is in the kingdom. Now if you wouldn't mind leaving, boys...

696
01:24:28,414 --> 01:24:31,725
I'd prefer to hang for something I've done.

697
01:24:31,855 --> 01:24:34,848
~ We whipped the prince?
~ Ah, Mister B., that's a good one!

698
01:24:35,056 --> 01:24:38,936
We flogged the prince! We flogged the prince!

699
01:24:45,098 --> 01:24:48,375
If that little rat tells his father, there's no place to hide.

700
01:24:48,499 --> 01:24:51,536
But a prince has always got to return to his castle.

701
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:57,211
Now if we could be there to lay our hands on them...

702
01:24:58,861 --> 01:25:04,732
~ And wring their cheeky necks...
~ No one will ever know.

703
01:25:06,263 --> 01:25:09,142
We do think alike, don't we?

704
01:25:09,344 --> 01:25:15,261
Ever since I got this shot in me smeller, I knew we'd make a fine pair.

705
01:25:29,428 --> 01:25:33,308
~ I've never been so weary in my life!
~ We're almost there.

706
01:25:33,709 --> 01:25:34,609
Quick!

707
01:25:37,409 --> 01:25:39,109
I've got you now!

708
01:25:41,711 --> 01:25:44,351
Stop them! They're thieves!

709
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,852
Hurry up!

710
01:26:47,446 --> 01:26:49,403
This way!

711
01:26:51,967 --> 01:26:54,402
Down here!

712
01:27:10,332 --> 01:27:12,892
Go on!

713
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:29,971
~ They're catching up! I can hear them.
~ Keep running!

714
01:27:34,137 --> 01:27:38,097
~ Come on, Cutwater.
~ Right behind you, Mister. B.

715
01:27:39,658 --> 01:27:45,576
~ Not that one! Stop! No! That's the brewery rats.
~ So ? You're a ratcatcher.

716
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:50,451
Not these! Everyone's afraid of them. They get big on malt and barley.

717
01:27:50,621 --> 01:27:53,694
And they're real mean drunks.

718
01:27:55,022 --> 01:27:57,662
I don't like this place.

719
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:02,260
How do you like hung, drawn, and quartered?

720
01:28:33,231 --> 01:28:38,226
No, they are hiding in the dark cover.

721
01:28:59,197 --> 01:29:02,270
They're everywhere!

722
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:06,870
Get them away from me!

723
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:38,204
Hey! State your business!

724
01:29:39,126 --> 01:29:43,678
Look closely at me, soldier. I'm Prince Horace, returned.

725
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:53,206
Bless me! It IS you...! Open the gates --- it's the prince!

726
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:56,368
~ Open the gates!
~ Open the gates!

727
01:30:07,893 --> 01:30:10,282
Prince!

728
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:43,213
General, prepare my horse. I ride with the advance guard. We depart within the hour.

729
01:30:43,381 --> 01:30:46,419
Falconhurst! I want an emissary to King Philip immediately.

730
01:30:46,622 --> 01:30:51,299
Tell him that I expect my son to be turned over to me at the border, otherwise I will invade!

731
01:30:51,463 --> 01:30:54,024
I want no excuses, no delays!

732
01:31:02,065 --> 01:31:05,024
~ Horace?
~ Hello, Father.

733
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:19,940
What have they done to you? I'll have their heads for this! Prepare for war!

734
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:24,269
~ Without delay, Your Majesty.
~ Show no mercy to these kidnappers!

735
01:31:24,471 --> 01:31:27,110
But I wasn't kidnapped.

736
01:31:29,952 --> 01:31:31,908
I ran away.

737
01:31:35,113 --> 01:31:37,070
You ran away?

738
01:31:37,834 --> 01:31:41,544
I didn't think you'd notice I was gone.

739
01:31:42,555 --> 01:31:47,346
But why? How could you possibly think that?

740
01:31:58,879 --> 01:32:02,269
I think I should know the answer to that question.

741
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:10,830
But you've come home now. That's all that matters.

742
01:32:12,922 --> 01:32:15,561
~ Father...
~ No, no!

743
01:32:17,683 --> 01:32:22,997
I think I should send the soldiers home now. What do you think?

744
01:32:25,645 --> 01:32:29,275
I'm sorry, Father...For all the trouble I've caused.

745
01:32:29,446 --> 01:32:31,596
No, no...

746
01:32:34,727 --> 01:32:40,724
I'm sorry. Because, you see, I'd forgotten what it's like to be twelve years old...

747
01:32:41,769 --> 01:32:44,283
and the son of a king.

748
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:53,087
With this treaty is the border dispute resolved.

749
01:32:56,172 --> 01:33:01,531
Cousin Philip has agreed that it would be shameful for us to destroy what our fathers...

750
01:33:01,773 --> 01:33:07,007
took so long to create. A point that seemed to have been lost upon his ambassador.

751
01:33:07,935 --> 01:33:13,647
And now, bring me the young rogue who stole away our son in the middle of the night...

752
01:33:13,816 --> 01:33:19,175
~ But Your Majesty...
~ And brought him back a better son.

753
01:33:21,018 --> 01:33:23,578
To a better father.

754
01:33:24,819 --> 01:33:29,336
~ Nevertheless, bring me the whipping boy.
~ Father, he's my friend.

755
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:34,451
And the best friend you've ever had. So there'll be no more whipping boys.

756
01:33:37,101 --> 01:33:41,300
~ But what about my sister?
~ I'm coming to that.

757
01:33:41,742 --> 01:33:45,531
As a result of the obvious injustice that she has suffered...

758
01:33:45,863 --> 01:33:49,937
Annyrose shall  be given a full pardon.

759
01:33:50,745 --> 01:33:53,213
No...!

760
01:33:55,506 --> 01:33:59,341
No? What is this, Child?

761
01:33:59,587 --> 01:34:04,184
I don't want no pardon. I'm innocent, and nothing less.

762
01:34:06,908 --> 01:34:12,143
~ Very well. I declare you innocent.
~ I accept, Your Majesty.

763
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:18,549
An unusual child.

764
01:34:19,591 --> 01:34:24,825
I now proclaim you both members of the royal household.

765
01:34:27,633 --> 01:34:30,626
Show them to the chambers, Horace.

766
01:34:32,874 --> 01:34:35,753
Cor, lodgings!

767
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:41,031
Come on, Annyrose...

768
01:34:41,956 --> 01:34:44,152
Proper lodgings!
