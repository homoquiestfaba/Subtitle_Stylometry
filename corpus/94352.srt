1
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:54,085
Good morning, it´s 7:00 a.m.

2
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:58,370
Got the Godfather of Soul comin´ at you
and he wants to know, how do you feel?

3
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,320
Anybody home?

4
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:45,524
-You the foreman?
-Yeah, Im the foreman. I dont want any.

5
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:48,331
-Im your new carpenter.
-What?

6
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:51,365
I read the ad in the newspaper
for carpenters. Here I am.

7
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:54,762
No, no. We filled that job.
Got a full house, buddy. Sorry.

8
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:58,444
Youre making a big mistake here.
Im a precision machine, man!

9
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,285
I can do twice the work
of any of these guys. I swear.

10
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:03,363
Great. Ill alert the media.

11
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:05,363
-The media?
-The media.

12
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,851
-East Coast?
-Yeah.

13
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:10,086
New York, upstate? Syracuse?

14
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:11,921
Where?

15
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,401
-Im from Binghamton.
-Binghamton! I was close!

16
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:15,891
I dont believe this!

17
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:16,768
What?

18
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:17,807
Look.

19
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,451
Give me this. This first day,
I work for free.

20
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,968
I give it to you, its a gift.
Second day, you pay me for two days.

21
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:26,764
Third day, I have your job.

22
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:35,045
-One day! One day!
-All right. One day.

23
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:38,130
-Start upstairs. On the roof.
-Thanks. Youre a good man.

24
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:40,562
Binghamton! Man, Im embarrassed!

25
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:49,561
Where do I go, man? Give me a job!

26
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:51,965
-Work with him.
-Okay.

27
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:54,527
Hey, guys!

28
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,765
Whats your name, man?

29
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:06,165
Howard. Whats yours?

30
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:44,723
What the fuck are you doing?

31
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:47,927
Seven kids.

32
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:52,881
-Right.
-Right. You got it. Boys, girls?

33
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:58,688
-Five girls, two boys.
-Thats great, man. Thats great.

34
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:01,926
-Congratulations.
-All right.

35
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,729
A lot of mouths to feed there.

36
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:06,965
You got that right.

37
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:14,606
Take them all out to dinner. Do that.

38
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,849
-Whats this?
-I just found it on the street. Its $100.

39
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:20,765
-Just take them out to dinner.
-Im not taking your money.

40
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:24,049
No, really. Ill tell you what happened.
Its the truth.

41
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:26,965
Im walking down the street,
I look down and there it is.

42
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:28,531
I bend down to pick it up...

43
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:30,887
...a voice out of nowhere says,
´Give it to Howard.´

44
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:34,123
I didnt know a Howard until today!
It must be you! Your lucky day.

45
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:37,363
-Im not taking your money.
-Take the money! Its not a big deal.

46
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:39,010
Take it! For the kids.

47
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:41,526
Take them to dinner.
A couple of Big Macs.

48
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:45,041
´I feel good

49
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:47,729
´Like I knew that I would now

50
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,160
´I feel good´

51
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:03,685
You like chop suey?

52
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:06,962
Ill make it up to you. Trust me.

53
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:14,452
Hello? Hi.

54
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,446
How are you?

55
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,047
Fine. Yeah.

56
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:19,881
Tonight?

57
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:25,770
Tonights fine. No!
No, nothing that I cant cancel.

58
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:32,571
Okay. So, I guess Ill see you tonight, then.
Okay. Bye.

59
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:57,851
Come on up, man.

60
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:00,411
Look at this shit.

61
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:10,446
Man! Do you ever feel like flying, Howard?
Just taking off?

62
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:14,450
-Just fly away!
-Why the hell not?

63
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:15,608
Fly.

64
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:19,366
´Why the hell not?´
Exactly, why the hell not?

65
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:23,648
No goddamn reason why not, Howard.

66
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:27,044
What are you doing, man?

67
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:30,046
Now, if you look at the situation here...

68
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:32,482
...what we got here is a roof...

69
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:35,609
...75% pitch, which is very nice.

70
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:42,683
I wouldnt go no further, man.

71
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:45,566
What were looking for here is a balance.

72
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:50,008
All we gotta do is find a little...

73
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,240
...equilibrium.

74
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:59,525
We got the westerlies coming in.
Fourteen, fifteen miles an hour.

75
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,450
Come on. Step back here, man.

76
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:07,286
Howard, let me tell you something, man.
This is basic physics, okay?

77
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:10,523
All you gotta do is find
a little equilibrium here.

78
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,172
Some equilibrium and a little balance.

79
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,967
Give me a rope, somebody.
Give me a rope!

80
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:21,406
Its equilibrium. Balance, Howard.
Lots of balance. Balance.

81
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:24,290
-Balance.
-Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed.

82
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:25,561
Balance....

83
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:30,244
The force of the thrust against the drag.

84
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,724
And then you get lift-off!

85
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:35,571
-Feels good?
-It feels great!

86
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:36,880
-Come on, baby!
-Im coming!

87
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:39,406
Its all right! Ill take care of you.

88
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:41,722
-Were gonna fly!
-I know. We gonna fly!

89
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,564
Yes, indeed. We gonna fly.

90
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,085
Got the drag on there.

91
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:46,924
-Got the drag on, man.
-I feel it.

92
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:48,968
Now dont turn away from me!
Come here!

93
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:50,644
-Talk to me.
-Here we come!

94
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:52,165
Dont move away from me!

95
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:54,004
-Stay with me.
-Here we come!

96
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:56,560
Dont go no further! Dont go no further!

97
00:08:56,772 --> 00:09:00,685
You dont have to do this.
You dont have to do this, man. Okay?

98
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,645
Come on, come on.

99
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:11,362
Stay right there. Let me talk to you.
Just stay right there.

100
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:18,004
Im a plane! Im gonna swoop down!
Im gonna fly!

101
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:29,362
-Howard?
-Look at me, man. Look at me.

102
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:31,249
This is what were gonna do.

103
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:34,290
Were gonna fly down,
come around the front of the ambulance...

104
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:37,330
...come around the back.
Im gonna land right on that bed!

105
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:40,324
In fact, Ill go around it three times
and then let down!

106
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:43,802
So just move the bed around a little bit!
Ill slide right in!

107
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,327
-Youre late.
-Youre later. Shell be mad.

108
00:09:58,412 --> 00:09:59,731
Im terrified.

109
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:04,761
The Psychiatric Emergency Room is closed
almost daily because of the staff cuts.

110
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,171
The situation here...

111
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:13,405
...is also dire.

112
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:17,883
Our unofficial policy is evaluate...

113
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:20,887
...medicate, vacate.

114
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,531
Sound cold-blooded?

115
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,321
It is.

116
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:28,491
They need the treatment
and we need the beds.

117
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,730
At this point, Id like to turn you over
to two of my staff...

118
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:34,372
...Dr. Elizabeth Bowen and Dr. Patrick Shea.

119
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:37,442
Theyll show you around the facilities.

120
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:40,490
I trust youll enjoy your visit. Thank you.

121
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,368
-Good morning.
-Good afternoon.

122
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:48,683
In the years 1970 to 1975,
four US mental hospitals....

123
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:49,966
I must speak with....

124
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:53,806
Okay. Welcome.
That was our good friend, Mr. Wilson.

125
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:57,642
Dr. Bowen and I will be going on rounds,
so follow us, please.

126
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,570
Come in. Move around there,
let everyone in. Dont be shy.

127
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:07,290
He wont bite, we hope.

128
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,010
What have we got here?

129
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:15,091
We have a male Caucasian.

130
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:17,925
Hes approximately 35.
Was brought in by the police.

131
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,321
He was doing a high-wire act on a roof.

132
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:25,363
When he came in, he was highly agitated,
delusional, having auditory hallucinations.

133
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:28,604
Has anyone examined him yet?

134
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:32,128
The resident made a preliminary diagnosis
of paranoid schizophrenia.

135
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,167
What did they give him?

136
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:36,528
Haldol, 10 milligrams. Thats pretty heavy.
It seems to have worked.

137
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,172
This is a new patient.
Whats the first thing we do?

138
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:43,404
-Assess the patients orientation.
-Very good, very good. Elizabeth?

139
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,324
Can you tell me your name?

140
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:53,968
No name, no history.
No one on the job knew him.

141
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,009
Do you know what day this is?

142
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:01,647
What?

143
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,767
Jones.

144
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:19,288
Whatd he say?

145
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,364
I think he said, ´Jones.´
His name is Jones.

146
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:25,321
Jones....

147
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:40,168
-Hi.
-Hi.

148
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,050
Im so glad to see you.

149
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:52,009
What did you do to your hair?

150
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:55,562
-You look great! You look wonderful!
-Thanks. Is this a bad time?

151
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:58,689
No, no. The paintings in the bedroom.
And, you have....

152
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:03,130
You have some mail.

153
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:04,924
-Libbie....
-Hi.

154
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:06,326
This is June.

155
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:08,769
Its so nice to meet you.

156
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:11,841
You know, its been six months, Libbie.

157
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,446
I just thought it was time
you should meet her.

158
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:20,002
Take your crap out of the medicine cabinet,
while youre at it.

159
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,366
All right, okay.

160
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,443
Youre a robot, you know that?

161
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:28,091
I cant hear you.

162
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:31,289
Youre not a real person.

163
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,126
Only a mutant would pull a stunt like this.

164
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:40,008
Are you talking to yourself, Libbie?

165
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:46,129
Yeah, Im talking to myself.

166
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:52,243
Who would have thought
that Id be on the Johnny Carson Show?

167
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,685
Did you know, when I was born...

168
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:56,002
...I didnt have a name
till I was 3 years old?

169
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:56,888
Why?

170
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:59,884
Because my father,
whos this really rigid old Chinese guy...

171
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,601
...told me that when I was little,
there was an ancient Chinese tradition...

172
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:07,162
...where the unborn child knows its name
before its even born.

173
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:10,005
So the parents listen for it
and they try to get the name.

174
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:12,208
Obviously, in my case,
they couldnt hear it.

175
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:15,045
Its not like they werent listening,
it was on purpose.

176
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:19,251
My mother wanted to name me Miranda
because she liked to dress like that.

177
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:23,530
With fruit and stuff.... I mean, hats!
I dont understand these hats.

178
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,491
But she couldnt say, ´Miranda´ because
it was ´Melanda´ and didnt sound right.

179
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:29,722
She wanted to avoid
the whole ´L´ and ´R´ thing.

180
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:32,121
So they called me Amanda. Amanda!

181
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:38,610
Shes never understood me.

182
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,850
She always has this...

183
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:49,163
...big smile on her face!

184
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,329
As if nothings wrong,
as if everything is okay.

185
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,761
Always.

186
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:04,728
My work is very important.
The Pentagon is aware of this.

187
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:09,203
I have received communication
from CBS News, 6"30 p.m., every night.

188
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:13,401
´Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson? Where are you?
Where are you?´

189
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:16,849
I cannot return the communication
if my mind is clouded...

190
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:19,492
...and if poison is being placed in my food!

191
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:50,165
´Im late, Im late
For a very important date´

192
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:53,688
Hi, Im a doctor! Im also a ´lateaholic.´
Im late! I work late!

193
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:58,649
I get up late. I sleep late. I eat late.
Its too damn late to do anything about it.

194
00:15:58,732 --> 00:16:01,451
-Mr. Jones?
-Where? Where? Get the net!

195
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,929
-Are you leaving us?
-Yes! Yes! I am leaving!

196
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:06,765
How are you feeling?

197
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:10,731
Did you do that to your husband
every morning? ´How are you feeling?´

198
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:14,202
I bet that just popped him right up
out of bed, didnt it?

199
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:17,247
Youre wondering how I knew
you were married?

200
00:16:17,332 --> 00:16:20,324
Elementary, my dear Miss Watson.
May I have your hand?

201
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:23,560
A slight discoloration on the ring finger.

202
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:29,523
And this rather fragile air about you
as if youve been recently damaged.

203
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,052
-Beautiful accent though. Swedish, isnt it?
-Yes.

204
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:38,807
I find your country to be very lovely.
Cold, but....

205
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:46,965
-Bye, Elizabeth.
-Howd you know my name?

206
00:16:48,612 --> 00:16:51,206
Have you tried the drugs here?
You should, you know.

207
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:53,852
You shouldnt be allowed to prescribe
unless you know.

208
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:59,086
You see, because we hear
everything in the room.

209
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:04,449
-Be careful what you say.
-Sorry we didnt get to talk.

210
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:08,844
Yeah, Im sorry too. Im sorry. Sorry.
We could talk. We could talk.

211
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:12,364
Do you like choral music?
Beethoven" Ninth Symphony, Ode to Joy?

212
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:15,808
You could use a little joy. I know I could.
I got tickets tonight.

213
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:19,680
Well go. Well fill our empty hearts.
Well find an all-night café.

214
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:23,651
Well be there all night long talking
as long as you want. What do you say?

215
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:26,610
Try, ´yes.´ Give me your number.
Ill call you.

216
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,206
I didnt mean that.

217
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,681
-What did you mean?
-I mean, we could talk.

218
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:33,605
We are talking. But you need to talk.
I want you to talk.

219
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:34,966
We should talk here.

220
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,964
You were very distressed yesterday.
I think you need treatment.

221
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:40,407
-Yes, late! Late! Gotta go!
-Heres my card.

222
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,928
-Will you please call me?
-Absolutely! ´Dr. Elizabeth Bowen!´

223
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:47,488
-Good-bye! Late! Gotta go!
-Will you call?

224
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:49,325
Yeah, probably not.

225
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,842
This was a standard-procedure release.
Whats the problem here?

226
00:17:56,932 --> 00:18:00,208
-I think he was misdiagnosed.
-How so?

227
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:03,841
He was psychotic but not schizophrenic.
He was expansive...

228
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:07,726
...intrusive, inappropriate, euphoric.
I think hes a manic.

229
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:12,723
Okay, fine. Fine. Hes manic.
You know, the guy refused medication.

230
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,647
It wouldve meant a hearing.
We wouldve lost.

231
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:18,963
Give him a few more hours
and hell think he can fly again.

232
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:22,521
´I feel good

233
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:25,288
´Like I knew that I would now

234
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,000
´I feel good

235
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,443
´Like I knew that I would now

236
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:32,881
´I feel good

237
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:34,207
´So good

238
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,520
´I got you´

239
00:18:58,092 --> 00:19:01,084
-She didnt have an account number--
-She said you were rude.

240
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:03,889
I just asked for verification.

241
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:07,009
Were the second largest
savings institution in this state.

242
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,811
We didnt get that way by being snotty.

243
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:13,371
You have a customer.

244
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:15,651
Hi, can I help you, sir?

245
00:19:15,732 --> 00:19:19,486
Yes, I would like a double cheeseburger,
fries and a chocolate shake.

246
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:22,360
Just kidding.

247
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:27,010
-Id like to close my account, please.
-You just opened this account last week.

248
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,088
Yeah, Im a fickle kind of guy.

249
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:32,051
Oh, my goodness.

250
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:36,845
Okay, you have $12,752 in your account.
Do you want that in hundreds?

251
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:40,012
Ill leave that up
to your impeccable judgement.

252
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:43,289
I just want to make sure that
I have a nice big fat wad of fives...

253
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:46,091
...for all the valet parking I plan to do.

254
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:50,402
-Dont forget the interest.
-Certainly.

255
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:51,607
-On five days?
-Yeah.

256
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,887
-Thats 5.5 percent....
-That would be....

257
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:56,964
Compounded daily, that is $9.60.

258
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:03,083
-How did you do that?
-Its easy. Its so easy. So easy.

259
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,210
-Keep one of those hundreds for yourself.
-I cant do that!

260
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:10,045
-No, youre gonna need it.
-I am? Why?

261
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,010
Youre taking me to lunch.

262
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:19,123
We need his-and-hers chilidogs!
His-and-hers, with all the fixings.

263
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:21,328
One for the lady, coming up. One more.

264
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:22,811
Here you go.

265
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:26,806
-Are you nuts? I cant break a $100 bill.
-Keep the change.

266
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,771
Music heaven.

267
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:45,529
This is a body. These are bodies.
Theyre womens bodies.

268
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:48,287
All over here. Look at this.

269
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,691
30-percent off before the sale,
another 25-percent off....

270
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:06,525
You can take this piano home
for less than half--

271
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:08,241
I hear Bach.

272
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:11,281
Excuse me.

273
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:14,891
Im hearing it also.

274
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:20,369
-No. Can you play it faster? Really fast?
-Absolutely!

275
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:34,722
Sold?

276
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:38,841
A piano....

277
00:21:56,252 --> 00:21:58,846
More. We need more.
More piano. More piano.

278
00:23:08,492 --> 00:23:10,050
-Whats your name, man?
-Pedro.

279
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:11,451
Pedro, have fun.

280
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,723
-Thank you.
-Get out of here.

281
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:19,963
Thank you, sir. If theres anything else
you need, just let me know.

282
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:26,646
I mean, you know, men will say that
youre good, but I know Im good.

283
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:29,811
Totally uninhibited.

284
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:32,921
Very smooth.

285
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,530
I make a lot of noise.

286
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:38,000
They like that.

287
00:23:39,972 --> 00:23:42,042
I pretend that Im out of control.

288
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:49,046
I always pretend that Im out of control,
but Im never out of control.

289
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:52,570
You know what I mean?
Im never out of control.

290
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:58,206
It isnt that far! Come on.

291
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:00,248
-Maybe we should go to the hotel.
-Stay here.

292
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,721
-Buddy, can you spare some change?
-Sure. Here.

293
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:05,167
-Here you go, here you go.
-Hey, thanks, man.

294
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:11,644
You like that music, huh?

295
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:14,842
All men are brothers...

296
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:18,688
-What are you, a musician?
-...beneath your soft wings.

297
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:21,886
No. No, but I was a music student.

298
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:26,563
I had this wonderful,
beautiful girlfriend named Ellen.

299
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:30,284
And she was a composer.
She was really an extraordinary person.

300
00:24:30,372 --> 00:24:32,124
-I think of her all the time.
-What happened?

301
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:36,603
-She died. Its okay.
-Im very sorry.

302
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:45,521
-Point it out.
-The second row.

303
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:05,202
Careful with the boots!

304
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:08,090
They got weights on them!
Look at the boots!

305
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:11,244
Hey, flying boots! Fly! Fly! Fly!

306
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:15,210
Im relaxed! Its too tight!

307
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:18,284
Its too tight. Im not struggling, all right?

308
00:26:18,372 --> 00:26:21,444
Its too tight. Its too tight. I cant....

309
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:26,804
You two, come here. Come here a second.
I want to talk to you!

310
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:29,452
I have a doctor here! I have a doctor!

311
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:32,764
Dr. Elizabeth Bowen! I have a doctor!

312
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:35,483
Give me that. Give me that.

313
00:26:35,652 --> 00:26:39,884
Come back, come back.
Zero, zero. Zero, zero, three, three.

314
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:43,169
Surprise, surprise. I know, I know.
Dont even say it.

315
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:47,370
Its like trying to stop a space shuttle
with a rubber band.

316
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,124
What did you give him?

317
00:26:49,932 --> 00:26:52,810
-Well, we waited for you.
-Why?

318
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,248
Well, youre his doctor.

319
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,601
Mr. Jones.

320
00:26:59,972 --> 00:27:01,200
Mr. Jones?

321
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:03,007
Elizabeth.

322
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:05,887
-You gotta get me out of here.
-I cant do that.

323
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:07,166
Not right now.

324
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:11,131
Right. I know the rules.
Seventy-two hours. I know.

325
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:15,330
But you can do it. You can do it. Please?
Please? Please, Im dying!

326
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:18,768
-Get me the fuck out of here.
-Mr. Jones, you have a disease.

327
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:21,088
Manic-depressive disorder.

328
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:24,970
Its like having diabetes.

329
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:28,682
No shit! And here I thought
I was just having a bad day!

330
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:31,606
Its a highly treatable chemical imbalance.

331
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,684
-Weve had a great deal of success--
-Look, fuck-face!

332
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:37,765
I have been in and out of hospitals
for 20 years!

333
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:40,764
There are two words that I really
do not appreciate!

334
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,042
One is ´great,´ the other ´success.´

335
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:44,970
Im going to tell you something.

336
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:47,327
Both of you listen,
you might learn something.

337
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:51,166
It is not a disease! Okay?
Not a disease! I do not have a disease.

338
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:54,165
This is who I am! I like who I am!
You got it?

339
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:57,605
Forget it. Dont even think
about that fucking needle!

340
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:00,081
Ill give you some medication
so you wont hurt yourself.

341
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:02,606
Im not hurting myself,
theyre hurting myself.

342
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,327
-Look, Mr. Jones....
-What?

343
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:06,606
-Youre here?
-Yeah.

344
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:08,330
-You asked for me?
-Yes.

345
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:09,522
I came.

346
00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:14,488
You did come. Thank you.
Youve made me very happy. Thank you.

347
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,642
-Now, youre very agitated.
-I am agitated.

348
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:19,405
-And very tired.
-Im not tired! Im not tired.

349
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:21,801
Id like to give you something
to help you rest.

350
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:24,452
Forget the Haldol! Im not taking Haldol.
Forget it!

351
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:25,726
Thats not Haldol.

352
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:27,291
-What is it?
-This is Amytal.

353
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,646
-Youve heard of it?
-Yeah.

354
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:30,370
-Its a sedative.
-Its good.

355
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:32,329
-Youll sleep.
-I know what it is.

356
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:34,846
-Something to help you rest.
-To help me rest.

357
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:35,523
Okay?

358
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:38,445
Okay. Youre awfully pretty
when you smile.

359
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:42,644
Here. Let me help you out.

360
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:44,570
This is going to be good.

361
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,285
Glass of Chardonnay?

362
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:52,321
Think of this as a whole bottle.

363
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:58,445
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I enjoyed that.

364
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:02,365
Now youll go home...

365
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,290
...and have some wine.

366
00:29:06,132 --> 00:29:07,804
Ill have a glass of wine.

367
00:29:09,812 --> 00:29:12,246
Youll think of me and have some wine.

368
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:16,208
Ill think of you getting better.

369
00:29:19,252 --> 00:29:21,812
Okay. Ill rest, but I wont sleep.

370
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:24,966
-You dont have to sleep.
-Thank you very much.

371
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:29,844
Youre pretty. Elizabeth, my Elizabeth.

372
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:31,681
Okay.

373
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:35,088
Elizabeth, where do they all go?

374
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:38,648
Where did he go? He was 18.

375
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:46,331
Where did he go?

376
00:29:47,132 --> 00:29:48,850
Where...? Mommy?

377
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,283
I had such a bad dream.

378
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,560
Do you understand why you´re here?

379
00:29:57,412 --> 00:29:59,528
Yes. This is a competency hearing.

380
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,807
Do you understand the consequences
of these proceedings?

381
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:09,007
Yes, I do. I am facing involuntary
commitment to a mental hospital...

382
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:11,083
...with indeterminate release.

383
00:30:11,692 --> 00:30:13,364
Attorney, you may proceed.

384
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:16,564
-Please state your name.
-Dr. Elizabeth Bowen.

385
00:30:16,772 --> 00:30:20,321
And Dr. Bowen, are you board-certified
to practice in this state?

386
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:21,567
Yes, I am.

387
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:25,246
Why do you think Mr. Jones should be
on a hold?

388
00:30:25,412 --> 00:30:28,961
I believe that he is suffering from
bipolar manic-depressive disorder...

389
00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:30,963
...and hes currently in a manic cycle.

390
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:34,727
What behaviours or attitudes can
you report to support this assumption?

391
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:36,211
Two incidents.

392
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:40,604
In the first, he had to be restrained
on a roof for his own safety...

393
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:43,652
...after claiming he was going to fly.

394
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:47,448
Its actually, it was a fairly creative act,
if you keep your mind open.

395
00:30:47,532 --> 00:30:49,648
Okay, all right. Sorry.

396
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:53,212
In the second, he was brought to us
by the police...

397
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,760
...after disrupting a symphony orchestra.

398
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:58,770
Excuse me, is the original conductor
here also?

399
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:02,004
Mr. Jones, please.
Youll have an opportunity to respond.

400
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:04,401
Thank you. Thank you very much,
Your Honour.

401
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:05,971
Continue, Dr. Bowen.

402
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:11,250
I think that his judgement is impaired
and that he is a danger to himself.

403
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:12,522
In what way?

404
00:31:12,612 --> 00:31:15,445
The manic state is usually followed
by depression.

405
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:17,841
What are the symptoms of depression?

406
00:31:19,012 --> 00:31:22,243
Hopelessness. Despair.

407
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:28,084
The inability to experience pleasure,
the inability to function.

408
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:30,641
Mr. Jones?

409
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:37,209
´Despair.´ ´Hopelessness.´

410
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:41,523
´The inability to experience pleasure.´

411
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:44,006
Now, Doctor...

412
00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:47,606
...are these words and phrases that come...

413
00:31:47,692 --> 00:31:49,887
...spontaneously to you
when you look at me?

414
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:52,850
Are they? I dont think so.

415
00:31:52,932 --> 00:31:56,288
I deeply respect Dr. Bowen.
She is a wonderful doctor.

416
00:31:56,452 --> 00:32:00,889
I respect her and her advice,
but I graciously say no.

417
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:03,085
No, thank you.

418
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:07,848
The fact is, that the doctor and the other
fine healers have decided that Im bipolar...

419
00:32:07,932 --> 00:32:11,811
...and this is without regard to the fact
that they have not one shred of evidence.

420
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:14,964
Theyve never observed me
once have a depressive symptom.

421
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:18,089
-Is that not true?
-Yes.

422
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:22,609
Thank you very much. Now, the fact is,
maybe I never get the blues.

423
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:25,845
Maybe Im just a happy-go-lucky guy
all the time.

424
00:32:27,092 --> 00:32:30,050
Your Honour, the truth is,
this is a very simple case.

425
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:34,091
If we go to the issues and see the case
on its merits, its very simple.

426
00:32:34,572 --> 00:32:36,927
Now the fact is
Im a productive human being.

427
00:32:37,012 --> 00:32:38,843
Last year in this country alone...

428
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:43,926
...over 75,000 people suffering
from depression killed themselves.

429
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:47,890
Your Honour? Your Honour,
will you please look at me?

430
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:49,690
Do I look suicidal?

431
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,407
What do you have to say
about these incidents...

432
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,403
...that Dr. Bowen mentioned?

433
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:57,290
Like the flying scam? I talked about it.

434
00:32:57,532 --> 00:33:00,763
This is not a big deal!
This is nothing! Its kids stuff!

435
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:04,565
Im a big personality! Im grandiose!

436
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:08,281
Im a kid, all right? I always will be.
Im sorry.

437
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:10,922
Your Honour, I swear....

438
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:13,530
I swear on my life...

439
00:33:14,732 --> 00:33:19,522
...I could have done a better job conducting
that Beethoven piece. I mean it!

440
00:33:22,172 --> 00:33:24,288
Please? Please, Your Honour?

441
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:28,449
Please, Your Honour,
please do not lock me up.

442
00:33:28,532 --> 00:33:31,763
You dont have to do this.
I promise Ill be a good boy.

443
00:33:31,852 --> 00:33:35,640
There are people who really are sick
and need that bed more than I do.

444
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:38,410
Sit down, Mr. Jones.

445
00:33:38,492 --> 00:33:42,405
Okay. I just want to thank you again.
Thank you, Your Honour.

446
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:56,370
Want to go bowling?

447
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:00,363
Do you want to do me a favour?

448
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:04,001
Next time youre in trouble,
dont ask for me. Im a busy person.

449
00:34:04,932 --> 00:34:07,446
I didnt expect youd be a bad loser.

450
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:09,284
Were not competing.

451
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:13,449
What is going on here?

452
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:17,721
I was fighting for freedom in there.
I dont know what youre in this for.

453
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:19,962
Tell me something. Do you crash?

454
00:34:21,212 --> 00:34:22,167
What?

455
00:34:22,572 --> 00:34:24,051
Do you get suicidal?

456
00:34:25,852 --> 00:34:26,762
Do you?

457
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:36,162
How can I get suicidal?
I have my little friends here. Lithium.

458
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:38,768
Four a day, every day...

459
00:34:39,132 --> 00:34:40,884
...keeps those highs and lows away.

460
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:42,166
If you take them.

461
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:45,050
Elizabeth. Elizabeth, wait a second.

462
00:34:46,692 --> 00:34:49,729
Id be happy to make an appointment
with you if you want.

463
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:51,643
Im worried about you.
Something happened.

464
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:52,926
-Good-bye.
-Is it your ex?

465
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:55,242
Take your medicine, pay your taxes....

466
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:56,526
Is his girlfriend pregnant?

467
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:58,364
Shes not pregnant.
You know nothing about me.

468
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:00,727
Is it the yuppie doctor?
Is he hitting on you?

469
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,565
I dont know how I shall put this. Shut up!

470
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:15,882
Im sorry. I didnt mean it.

471
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:33,050
What are you doing?

472
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:36,602
I dont live very far from here.
I thought maybe you could give me a ride.

473
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:39,684
Im a psychiatrist. If you have
a psychiatric problem, call me.

474
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:43,128
If you have a transportation problem,
you call a cab, okay?

475
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,882
I guess maybe I do have a problem.

476
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,290
I dont have any money.

477
00:36:01,532 --> 00:36:05,127
So, tell me. When did you
first notice the symptoms?

478
00:36:08,052 --> 00:36:10,122
-Elizabeth, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

479
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:11,201
Good.

480
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,806
Say you go to the theatre tonight, right?

481
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:18,452
You go to the theatre.
You run into your gynaecologist.

482
00:36:18,532 --> 00:36:19,681
He says to you"

483
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:22,332
´Good evening, Elizabeth,
are you enjoying the play?

484
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:25,848
´How about that little condition
you came to me about last week?

485
00:36:25,972 --> 00:36:27,849
-´Lets have a look.´
-Its not the same.

486
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:29,570
Its exactly the same thing!

487
00:36:29,652 --> 00:36:31,449
Youre at the theatre, with your dress up....

488
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:34,251
Me, on a beautiful day like this,
with a woman like you....

489
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:35,811
Its exactly the same thing.

490
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:39,168
The minute the doctor shows up,
and starts poking around in things...

491
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:44,406
...that he or she is uninvited
to be poking around in, its rude.

492
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:48,288
I guess I never thought of it that way.

493
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,691
-Im sorry.
-Yeah.

494
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:54,085
-Yeah. Ill forgive you.
-Thanks.

495
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,488
-If you feed me.
-I cant.

496
00:36:57,612 --> 00:37:00,604
Cant? This is America.
You can do anything you want!

497
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:03,729
-I have appointments!
-I have hunger.

498
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:05,886
Mucho hunger.

499
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,000
I really cant.

500
00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:11,882
Who needs you more today than me?

501
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:14,532
There cant be anyone. Im desperate.

502
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:18,128
You want to do this, I know you do.

503
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:20,401
There! There it is!

504
00:37:20,492 --> 00:37:22,926
You see it? The road to forgiveness.

505
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:26,883
Ill talk about me. I will.

506
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:34,207
Just turn. Come on.

507
00:37:34,612 --> 00:37:37,445
Yes! I knew it! I knew shed do it! Yes!

508
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,971
So, what were you doing
on the stage that night?

509
00:37:50,052 --> 00:37:51,770
Picking up the tempo.

510
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:53,610
Why would you do that?

511
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:59,160
Look, Ode to Joy was meant
to be played allegro vivace"

512
00:37:59,252 --> 00:38:00,810
Quickly, with life.

513
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:05,045
Beethoven might have been stone deaf,
but he had an impeccable sense of time.

514
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:07,965
If he wasnt dead, hed have dragged
that bastard offstage.

515
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,964
Truth be known, I was just there
protecting my friend Ludwig.

516
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:13,771
-You know a lot about music, dont you?
-Yeah, yeah.

517
00:38:16,132 --> 00:38:17,326
Do you play?

518
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,251
There. Go ahead.

519
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:26,044
Have you ever played?

520
00:38:34,132 --> 00:38:36,885
-Shall we dance?
-No way.

521
00:38:36,972 --> 00:38:40,408
Come on, Elizabeth! A couple of steps up,
everythings different.

522
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,130
I dont want different.

523
00:38:43,372 --> 00:38:46,330
Want to know who I am?
You gotta go where I am.

524
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:49,926
If you dont get down right now, Im going.

525
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:53,441
Its all right. Fear is allowed here.

526
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:56,166
Its just that I even get dizzy in high heels.

527
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:59,289
I know its silly.
I know its just a childhood thing.

528
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:02,762
Theres nothing I can do about it.

529
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:09,203
Do you ever have flying dreams?

530
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:12,321
I dont know. Maybe when I was a kid.

531
00:39:12,572 --> 00:39:13,891
You know, interesting.

532
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:17,851
Ive asked that question all over the world
and everyone says the same thing.

533
00:39:19,012 --> 00:39:23,164
Why is it only children have flying dreams?

534
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:28,290
Shes late. Shes late.

535
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:32,841
Not yet.

536
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:44,691
How did you get started?

537
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:48,003
A little psychiatric kit
for Christmas one year?

538
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:49,768
No.

539
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:54,370
Whyd you give up dancing?

540
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:55,726
Howd you know that?

541
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:59,202
The feet! You got crunched toes
heading east and west...

542
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:02,443
...and you walk like a duck
when youre not paying any attention.

543
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:04,568
-I dont.
-You do! Its cute. I like it.

544
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,404
You still dance?

545
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:09,290
-What do you mean, ´east and west´?
-Look at them!

546
00:40:09,732 --> 00:40:12,690
If your legs followed your feet,
youd split in half.

547
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:17,331
Were you a little ballerina
with ribbons in your hair?

548
00:40:17,412 --> 00:40:19,482
-They do not.
-They do!

549
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:23,568
What happened to her?
This ´Little Miss Twinkletoes´?

550
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:27,124
I had a wild couple of months
where every morning Id wake up...

551
00:40:27,212 --> 00:40:28,565
...and something was different.

552
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:32,486
Like somebody was stretching
my body parts when I was asleep.

553
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:37,968
I felt like I had arms down to my knees
and a neck about 18-inches long.

554
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:40,204
I didnt even want to leave my room.

555
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:43,204
I thought I looked like Lurch,
from the Addams Family.

556
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:44,486
Yes, I know.

557
00:40:48,972 --> 00:40:51,042
-Its hell, isnt it?
-What?

558
00:40:53,812 --> 00:40:54,961
Growing up.

559
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:58,451
Yeah. It stinks.

560
00:41:03,052 --> 00:41:05,805
My new boots! Damn!

561
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,763
Yeah. Home sweet home.

562
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,842
Youre an interesting man, Mr. Jones.

563
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:37,048
-Would you want to make me ordinary?
-No.

564
00:41:38,612 --> 00:41:40,011
I want you to be well.

565
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:43,084
´Well´? Im well, believe me.
I am ecstatic.

566
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:46,449
You want to cure me of that?

567
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:48,602
Thats just your chemistry talking.

568
00:41:49,492 --> 00:41:50,891
Chemistry again?

569
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,806
Its all chemical.
The whole universe is chemical.

570
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:56,962
Youre chemicals. Im chemicals.

571
00:41:57,092 --> 00:42:00,243
Love, sadness, pain, grief.

572
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:02,762
If I touch you, touch you here...

573
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:05,209
...you feel something, right?

574
00:42:08,412 --> 00:42:10,403
If I touch you back here....

575
00:42:10,492 --> 00:42:12,210
Lean forward a little bit.

576
00:42:12,332 --> 00:42:16,769
Lean forward. Drop your head.
Drop your head a little more.

577
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:18,241
Right there.

578
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:22,372
You hold your tension right there,
dont you?

579
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:29,730
Just an observation.

580
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:40,130
-Wonderful afternoon, wasnt it?
-Yes.

581
00:42:43,692 --> 00:42:45,011
Thanks for the ride.

582
00:42:45,092 --> 00:42:46,320
-Bye.
-Bye.

583
00:42:52,172 --> 00:42:53,207
Mr. Jones!

584
00:43:00,692 --> 00:43:01,920
Your chemicals.

585
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,811
-All right. Then 3"00.
-Thats good.

586
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:36,646
-What do you want?
-I just want my tools, thats all.

587
00:43:36,732 --> 00:43:39,485
Dont worry about your tools.
Worry about staying out of trouble.

588
00:43:39,572 --> 00:43:41,927
I wanted to thank you
about giving me the chance.

589
00:43:42,012 --> 00:43:44,924
-No problem.
-Im sorry, I was a little strange.

590
00:43:45,012 --> 00:43:48,084
-Why dont you get lost?
-Maybe you could give me another chance.

591
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:51,721
Hey, pal, Im telling you,
why dont you get lost, all right?

592
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:54,571
You gotta be fucking joking,
you fucking lunatic.

593
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:58,208
Ill come back tomorrow. Thats better.
Thats a lot better. Okay?

594
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:00,522
Ill come back.... What about my tools?

595
00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:08,081
Hey, man.

596
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:11,686
How you feeling?

597
00:44:12,612 --> 00:44:15,922
Im okay. I appreciate what you did for me.

598
00:44:16,012 --> 00:44:20,881
Thats all right. Listen, I got your tools
at the house. You want to come get them?

599
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:31,444
Okay, everybody. All right, Peytan,
you lead everybody in grace.

600
00:44:32,332 --> 00:44:35,085
Thank you for the food
that were blessed to have.

601
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,642
Thank you for our health, our home...

602
00:44:38,852 --> 00:44:41,446
...and our family. Amen.

603
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:47,885
Mr. Jones, may I have your plate, please?

604
00:44:54,252 --> 00:44:55,765
Pass that glass down.

605
00:44:56,452 --> 00:44:57,931
Pass that glass down.

606
00:45:10,932 --> 00:45:11,921
Hi, kid.

607
00:45:14,132 --> 00:45:15,201
Whats up?

608
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,408
Do you know how to do this?

609
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,283
What do you got there, math?

610
00:45:37,372 --> 00:45:41,047
All right, now the thing you gotta
remember about long division...

611
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:44,681
...is that its short division,
just smaller numbers.

612
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:13,411
I can do this.

613
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:12,566
Hello, yeah. I understand youre the doctor
whos treating Mr. Jones?

614
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,769
What can I do for you?

615
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:20,361
You know, Doctor!

616
00:48:20,892 --> 00:48:21,642
What?

617
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,644
I dont know, he seems
like hes really having some problems.

618
00:49:26,612 --> 00:49:27,647
Mr. Jones.

619
00:49:58,532 --> 00:50:00,966
I cant stop the sadness!

620
00:50:05,132 --> 00:50:07,851
Its all right. Its all right.

621
00:50:22,092 --> 00:50:25,129
´Taking showers used to be a bore

622
00:50:25,612 --> 00:50:28,843
´Now it isnt boring anymore

623
00:50:28,972 --> 00:50:33,045
´Cause the shower situation
stimulates imagination

624
00:50:33,652 --> 00:50:36,564
´And I found my inspiration in the shower´

625
00:50:37,092 --> 00:50:41,051
You can join in anytime.
We can do this as a round, if youd like.

626
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:43,049
´Taking showers....´

627
00:50:44,452 --> 00:50:46,647
My dad and I had a fight.

628
00:50:47,852 --> 00:50:49,365
My mother was crying.

629
00:50:49,972 --> 00:50:52,088
And I stayed up all night waiting.

630
00:50:54,692 --> 00:50:56,205
I broke their hearts.

631
00:50:59,812 --> 00:51:01,086
Are you taping this?

632
00:51:01,412 --> 00:51:02,322
Yeah.

633
00:51:03,972 --> 00:51:05,087
Do you mind?

634
00:51:10,092 --> 00:51:11,571
Doesnt matter.

635
00:51:16,052 --> 00:51:19,601
Mr. Jones, the way I see it,
were dealing with two problems here.

636
00:51:20,852 --> 00:51:23,412
One is chemical, and were treating that.

637
00:51:25,572 --> 00:51:27,449
And the other one is...

638
00:51:27,572 --> 00:51:28,766
...I think...

639
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:30,846
...your pain.

640
00:51:32,452 --> 00:51:37,572
Itll take hard work
for us to get at those feelings.

641
00:51:39,092 --> 00:51:40,491
Do you understand?

642
00:51:42,772 --> 00:51:44,649
Will you work with me?

643
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:48,650
Do we have a deal?

644
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:53,161
Now, what we want to do is
let our movement express how we feel.

645
00:51:53,572 --> 00:51:56,609
Okay? Let yourself move
through the space...

646
00:51:57,612 --> 00:51:59,807
...and express your inner life.

647
00:52:01,012 --> 00:52:03,003
Okay, just be gentle, all right?

648
00:52:03,252 --> 00:52:05,812
Thats right. Yeah. Just let it out.

649
00:52:06,212 --> 00:52:11,127
Just let it come up somehow. Its in here?
Its in there? Just let it out.

650
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:22,486
Mr. Jones? What are you being?

651
00:52:27,012 --> 00:52:28,331
An erection.

652
00:52:32,772 --> 00:52:34,364
I have no memory.

653
00:52:35,092 --> 00:52:36,650
You cant remember anything?

654
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:37,960
Sometimes.

655
00:52:38,612 --> 00:52:41,206
What happens when
you can´t remember anything?

656
00:52:41,452 --> 00:52:43,044
I can´t stop. It makes me....

657
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:49,081
Good.

658
00:52:51,172 --> 00:52:52,366
Very good.

659
00:52:53,252 --> 00:52:56,562
Mr. Jones, how about you?
Dont you want to paint something?

660
00:52:57,092 --> 00:53:00,004
This is your opportunity
to really express yourself.

661
00:53:07,452 --> 00:53:10,012
Tell me about the first time
you got into trouble.

662
00:53:13,332 --> 00:53:14,401
Okay.

663
00:53:16,452 --> 00:53:20,491
Now I will tell you the first time...

664
00:53:21,652 --> 00:53:23,722
...I got into trouble.

665
00:53:29,652 --> 00:53:33,361
I was working in a construction crew,
building tract houses.

666
00:53:34,132 --> 00:53:38,091
And I was a pretty tough guy
and I was getting into things...

667
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:41,562
...with guys, and no one was gonna
mess with me ´cause I was very tough.

668
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:44,291
I was a tough guy.
I am a very, very tough guy.

669
00:53:44,652 --> 00:53:49,362
At the same time, I was also like going out
with a really groovy girl named Ellen.

670
00:53:49,612 --> 00:53:52,445
And, Ellen went and died, you know.

671
00:53:52,532 --> 00:53:55,046
And then I did things that werent good.

672
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:58,408
And I broke things and hit people and stuff.

673
00:53:58,492 --> 00:54:01,370
Then they took me to jail, right?
So they took me to jail...

674
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:04,125
...and I´m sitting in jail,
then I´m climbing the bars...

675
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:07,090
...and I´m like doing stuff
and I´m climbing up there...

676
00:54:07,212 --> 00:54:09,726
...and I´m screaming out
that I´m King Kong.

677
00:54:12,572 --> 00:54:16,770
And all this stuff. You know, so then
they take me away to a mental hospital.

678
00:54:17,532 --> 00:54:20,000
-Where?
-Houston.

679
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:24,642
-Why are you lying?
-Im not lying.

680
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:30,685
Im not lying!

681
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:34,889
Yeah. You were King Kong
in a jail in Houston.

682
00:54:35,612 --> 00:54:36,647
Houston.

683
00:54:37,172 --> 00:54:38,161
Houston.

684
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:40,927
Yeah.

685
00:54:46,092 --> 00:54:48,560
Okay. You want to come back tomorrow?

686
00:54:50,332 --> 00:54:51,321
Okay.

687
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:04,851
I was in college.

688
00:55:07,332 --> 00:55:08,481
What happened?

689
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:11,410
I swallowed some aspirin.

690
00:55:13,132 --> 00:55:14,121
How many?

691
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:20,207
Seventy-three heavy-duty,
full-strength Tylenol.

692
00:55:23,372 --> 00:55:24,487
I was young.

693
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:27,004
It was on a full stomach...

694
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:30,168
...and my roommates found me.

695
00:55:32,252 --> 00:55:34,447
Theres something I want you to know.

696
00:55:35,892 --> 00:55:37,848
Ever since that night...

697
00:55:39,932 --> 00:55:41,331
...I have never...

698
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:44,361
...ever...

699
00:55:45,892 --> 00:55:47,291
...had a headache.

700
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:53,847
True story.

701
00:55:55,212 --> 00:55:56,645
I believe you.

702
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,843
How you doing, man?

703
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,045
Howard?

704
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,005
Howard!

705
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,083
-What are you doing here?
-Ive come to see you, boy.

706
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,648
Did they get you, too?

707
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:35,448
-You look good, man.
-Yeah.

708
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:39,248
-For real.
-Im getting there. Im getting there.

709
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,120
-How long have I been in here?
-A month.

710
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,729
Month. Time flies.

711
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:52,007
Excuse me, sir. Im sorry to interrupt,
but could I ask a question?

712
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:52,920
Sure.

713
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,648
-Did you drive here?
-I did.

714
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,802
-What kind of car do you have?
-Pickup.

715
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,962
You know youre injecting poisons
into our food and our bodies?

716
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,927
Okay, Mr. Wilson. Thank you.

717
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:10,279
-Thought that guy was your doctor.
-Its hard to tell sometimes.

718
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,366
Like with these three over there.

719
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,360
Now, Howard, you tell me.
Which one there is the patient?

720
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,280
The lady. The sad-looking lady.

721
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,009
That is my doctor.

722
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:30,759
What about these over here?
The little girl?

723
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,765
Tried to kill herself three times.

724
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:37,359
And the big lady over here, big fat lady?

725
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:41,443
All right. Okay. All right. All right, man.

726
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:45,404
-I came to see you. Okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

727
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,925
Come on, man. Come on.

728
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:53,367
When can you get out of here?

729
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,359
I dont know.

730
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:58,524
I dont know.

731
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,887
And this woman is so awful to me.

732
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:07,526
You got my number. Call me anytime.

733
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,886
What is this? What is this? What?

734
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,281
You will not believe this, man.

735
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:16,440
You wont believe what happened to me.

736
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:19,328
Im walking down the street,
day before yesterday.

737
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,162
The sky opens up....

738
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,008
Listen, I hear this voice saying"

739
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:28,446
´´Give this to Mr. Jones. ´´

740
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,844
Mr. Altman?

741
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,886
Mr. Altman, I dont think youre supposed
to be off the unit.

742
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,205
-Mr. Altman?
-My wife....

743
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,250
Whats the matter with your wife,
Mr. Altman?

744
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,489
She didnt come.

745
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:02,802
You expected her to come today
and she didnt come?

746
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:06,885
Is that it?

747
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:12,728
-She did not come to visit.
-I understand.

748
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:26,362
Okay. Why dont we go back to your room
and then you can call her.

749
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:29,799
Mr. Altman?

750
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,324
Mr. Altman?

751
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:38,440
Do you think shes fucking around?

752
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:44,844
I do. I think shes fucking around on me.

753
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:48,002
Just lets walk back, you and I,
to your ward and call her.

754
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,284
Is that okay?

755
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,005
Come on.

756
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:31,085
Hey, Arnie! Arnie!
I gotta talk to you, man.

757
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,922
I gotta talk to you about something!

758
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,649
Hey, you look good, man! You look good!

759
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:38,927
-My wife is fucking around!
-That aint your wife! Thats a doctor.

760
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,079
Your wifes not here!

761
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:43,162
-She didnt come to see me!
-Shell come. Heres protection.

762
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,923
You feel good! You feel real good!
Feel good!

763
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,160
-You feel real good!
-I feel good.

764
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,402
Have you seen my wife?

765
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,721
We need a medic over here.

766
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:57,443
Wait a minute! Shit!

767
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,090
No! Its the wrong guy!

768
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:01,359
Wait a minute!

769
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,920
No! I feel good! I feel good!

770
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,359
Wait. Wait. You okay? You all right?

771
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:12,967
Dr. Bowen, are you all right?

772
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:18,122
What happened? Did he hit you? Where?

773
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,320
Here.

774
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:48,924
I just wanted to say thank you.
I thought about buying you something...

775
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:51,570
...but what do you buy a person
who saves your life?

776
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,003
Its no big deal.

777
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:56,082
Yes. Very big deal. Biggest deal there is.

778
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:00,727
Now you got a war story.

779
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:05,328
Something you can tell around
the campfire to the kiddies.

780
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,128
Scare them to death.

781
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:12,522
You cant let that big guy corner you
like that again.

782
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,479
Youre ´Old Doc Twinkletoes,´ remember?

783
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,846
-Ill remember.
-Okay. You do that.

784
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,569
-Mr. Jones?
-Yeah?

785
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,159
Want to play?

786
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,279
With you?

787
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,125
Love-one.

788
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:25,799
My serve.

789
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:30,846
Love-two.

790
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:34,002
All right! We know its two-love.
Thank you very much.

791
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:40,769
-I had to do it.
-Its my point.

792
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:41,760
Love-three.

793
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,442
-Whose point?
-Her point.

794
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,488
-Who the fuck made you scorekeeper?
-Official tournament rules.

795
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:47,719
My point.

796
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:51,761
-Dont cheat.
-Im not cheating, youre cheating.

797
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,445
My point.

798
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:58,448
-You cant do that!
-It didnt hit the table.

799
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:10,488
-Yes!
-I got it!

800
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:13,960
-It was off the table. Whats the score?
-Wilson, it hit!

801
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:16,245
-One-three.
-No! It is not her point!

802
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,686
-Touched the table.
-It wasnt her point! It did not hit!

803
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,443
Bad manners, you lose a point!

804
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:24,124
We got ten people watching this.
I got the point.

805
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:26,485
-Well play the point over.
-It was my point.

806
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,720
It was my point, but well play it over.

807
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:30,562
-Come on, lets go.
-Wait a minute.

808
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:33,403
Why is it I keep winning
and she gets the points?

809
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,765
My point.

810
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:39,081
It touched the table. Tournament rules!

811
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:42,606
What do you mean? That was my point!

812
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:43,884
Shut the fuck up!

813
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:46,768
You shut the fuck up!
Im going to win this game!

814
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:48,886
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

815
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:51,319
Fuck you, too! You son of a bitch!

816
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:53,363
Fucking nutsos.

817
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:56,164
-Ready?
-Okay, all right.

818
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,559
My point again.

819
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:01,403
Okay, all right, give me the ball.
Give me the ball.

820
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,004
Wait a minute here. Give me the ball.

821
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,523
-I havent got it!
-I saw you!

822
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:06,565
I didnt--

823
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:10,563
-Give me the ball. Were playing a game!
-Bad manners, you lose a point!

824
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:15,049
´´Escalator to manager´s office. ´´

825
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,441
So I have to go to him!

826
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:28,601
Mr. Jones, medication for you.

827
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,884
Mr. Jones, its time for your medication.

828
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,247
Im watching the cartoon.

829
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,398
Let me get to the bottom of this!

830
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:42,164
-Its time for your medication.
-I said, not today.

831
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,684
-Mr. Jones, its time for--
-I said, dont!

832
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:50,325
Im sorry.

833
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:53,439
Im sorry.

834
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:01,447
I cant do this anymore.

835
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,089
I appreciate you trying so hard.

836
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:13,485
I gotta get out of here.

837
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,282
Is it the medication?

838
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:20,883
Elizabeth, I am a junkie.

839
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:24,242
I really need my highs.

840
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:31,399
I really miss my highs very badly.

841
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:34,638
And the lows?

842
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:38,724
Yeah, well...

843
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:42,361
...guess Ill take my chances.

844
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:44,684
Listen to me.

845
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:48,838
When you first came to this hospital
you were suicidal, right?

846
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:51,126
I didnt come to this hospital.

847
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:54,084
I came to you.

848
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:03,400
I guess maybe I owe you my life.

849
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:08,641
Well, then, were even.

850
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,566
Thank you again...

851
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:18,038
...for helping me the other day.

852
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:30,287
It was so wonderful to see the way
you dealt with Mr. Altman.

853
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:39,326
You have such a gift with people.

854
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,368
You do, I envy you.

855
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:46,608
You have so much to offer.
Please, dont give up.

856
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,408
When I was 3 years old...

857
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:52,608
...I played Mozart.

858
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:00,724
By the time I was 12,
I had read everything.

859
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,609
When I was 18...

860
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:08,600
...I was the centre of the universe.

861
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:15,406
And then I woke up one day,
and I was in a mental institution.

862
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,684
Im not normal.

863
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:24,248
Ive never been normal.

864
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:39,644
I cant live down here anymore.
I cant do it. I cant.

865
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:42,730
I cant do it by myself.

866
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:47,924
No. Not by yourself.

867
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:51,159
It hurts.

868
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,808
Were grateful for all youve done.

869
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:33,609
But we feel that we can handle it
from this point on.

870
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:37,443
We do have a large and supportive family.

871
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:41,486
Dr. Bowen, what do you think?

872
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:46,404
I think youre ready to go back to school.

873
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:48,925
Youre so much stronger now.

874
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:53,087
You feel stronger, dont you?

875
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:54,885
Yeah.

876
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:02,725
But I do think we need
to continue your treatment.

877
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:07,325
So well just go back
to our Tuesday morning sessions.

878
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:08,809
Okay, Amanda?

879
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:23,247
Actually, my parents have this friend
thats a therapist...

880
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:27,006
...and they would like me to try
a few sessions with him.

881
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:31,725
-Bye.
-Bye.

882
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:33,363
-Thank you.
-Good-bye.

883
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:34,839
Bye.

884
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,924
So, you call me if you need me? Promise?

885
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:49,929
Okay? Okay.

886
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,368
Lets be optimistic.

887
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:02,447
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-I have a meeting.

888
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:04,445
I can be late.

889
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,521
-No. No, thats all right.
-Tomorrow?

890
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,521
Yeah, I needed to talk to you.

891
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:11,080
-You find me!
-Okay!

892
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:18,168
Libbie. Libbie, come here a minute.

893
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:23,078
All right, I want you to meet Dr. Bowen.

894
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,726
All right? This is Susan.

895
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,479
Hello.

896
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:31,000
She was with Mr. Jones
at the Beethoven concert.

897
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:34,403
-Shed like to have a word with you.
-Okay.

898
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:40,806
He was just so special.
He was unexpected and exciting...

899
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:45,441
...and just crazy enough
to make the afternoon interesting.

900
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:47,766
In what way, crazy?

901
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:52,204
Well, crazy.

902
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:55,879
Like, for instance,
we were in this hotel and...

903
01:12:56,410 --> 01:13:01,120
...this room-service guy comes
with some champagne and...

904
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:05,442
...he calls this guy right into the bathroom.

905
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:08,842
We were both in the bathtub.

906
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:13,685
And he just stood up, you know?
He was, like, completely naked.

907
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:18,287
I guess you had to be there.

908
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:22,004
Even if he were here,
it would be confidential.

909
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:25,560
And were not allowed to give out
any information about patients.

910
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,402
Im really sorry.

911
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:34,048
Can I just give you my phone number,
in case?

912
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,802
Yeah, of course.

913
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:48,243
You know, I dont think hes married
or anything.

914
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:53,048
He did talk about another woman
in his life though.

915
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:57,447
Ellen. Ellen something?

916
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,248
She was a music student.

917
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:01,321
Do you remember her last name?

918
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:04,008
Ellen something.

919
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:07,683
He said she died.

920
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:13,444
I figured that gave me
a little edge over her.

921
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,480
So, who is it that were looking for?

922
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:21,965
-A music student.
-Yes?

923
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,888
-Female.
-Yes?

924
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:26,765
-Here in the mid 70s.
-Yes?

925
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:29,239
-First name, Ellen.
-Yes?

926
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:33,449
-Thats it?
-Thats it.

927
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,688
This could take a while.

928
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:47,525
What do you want me to talk about today?

929
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:48,963
Anything you like.

930
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:51,961
Anything? Lets talk about you.

931
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,762
Okay, you choose.

932
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:00,879
Ellen.

933
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:06,522
-Ellen? Which Ellen?
-Your Ellen.

934
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,684
My Ellen? Yeah, my Ellen. Sure.

935
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,285
Ellen.

936
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,200
Ellen was probably the only person...

937
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:23,521
...who ever really loved me.

938
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:29,405
The most beautiful red hair.

939
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:35,322
She thought I could be...

940
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:41,925
...Mozart, Shakespeare, Einstein,
Picasso, Nijinsky.

941
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:46,808
And then she was gone.

942
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:49,048
How did she die?

943
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,321
She fell off a trapeze.

944
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:05,084
No, she was run over by a cement mixer.

945
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,844
What difference does it make?
Shes gone. Shes dead.

946
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:08,885
None.

947
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,568
What was her last name?

948
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:16,202
I dont remember.

949
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:17,809
Was it Ryan?

950
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:24,604
Ellen Ryan?

951
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:40,963
You are one very, very sick motherfucker.

952
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:44,880
What have you been doing,
spying on me? Miss FBI?

953
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:47,449
I spoke to her.

954
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,125
Ellen Ryan is now Mrs. Ellen Naughton.

955
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,724
She lives in Iowa. She has two children.

956
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:56,368
She was so happy to hear
that you were being helped...

957
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:59,560
...because the whole time
you were together...

958
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:02,369
...you would never admit
that there was anything wrong.

959
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:05,362
Thats why she had to leave you.

960
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:08,482
No. She died.

961
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:10,288
-No.
-She died.

962
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,769
She didnt die.

963
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:17,165
-Are your parents still alive?
-My parents never were alive.

964
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:28,082
Fuck you, you sick motherfucker.

965
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:30,566
Who the fuck do you think you are?

966
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:36,238
You think youre a fucking doctor?
Youre full of shit! Youre sick!

967
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:39,962
Im not sick! You dont treat me
like a fucking sick person!

968
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:42,166
I dont skulk around! I dont fucking spy!

969
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,923
Youre not a sick person,
youre a person with a sickness.

970
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:47,683
Dont fucking talk to me about sick!
Youre sick!

971
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:51,445
The disease is not who you are.
Its separate from you, and can be treated.

972
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:54,249
I am what I am! This is what I am!
And fuck you!

973
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:57,686
Youre not a friend of mine!
You have no right to talk to me!

974
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:01,607
I dont need this. What am I doing?
I dont fucking need this.

975
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:04,682
I dont need it at all.
I dont have to be here. And Im going.

976
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:06,647
Bye, see you around, pal.

977
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:16,359
Damn!

978
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,680
Why? Why? Why? Dumb!

979
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:25,928
What do you expect?
You go there to see some stupid....

980
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:32,005
Dont you ever do it again!
Why am I doing it again?

981
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:35,608
What do you expect?
You go to a hospital looking for....

982
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:40,366
All right. Stupid!
Stupid, why do you do this? Stupid!

983
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:44,562
-Dont do it again.
-Get in the car!

984
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:47,687
-Please! Lets talk.
-Get out of here!

985
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:49,965
Please, just get in the car!

986
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:52,763
Cant we just talk?

987
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,726
-I dont want to talk.
-Please!

988
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:59,569
Get away from me!
Youre sicker than I thought you were!

989
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:00,924
Get out of here!

990
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:06,610
Can you please just stop and listen to me?

991
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:28,882
All right, what? What do you want?
What?

992
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:30,881
You dont even know, do you?

993
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:37,561
All right, all right, I forgive you.
Now, just get the hell away from me.

994
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:41,845
Look, I was wrong, okay? Ive never
violated a patients privacy before.

995
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:44,444
And you still havent.
Cause Im not your patient!

996
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,963
I never was! You get it?

997
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:48,610
I checked myself in! I checked myself out!

998
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:52,764
My mistake was looking for a friend
in a hospital! Im not gonna do it again!

999
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:55,569
Ellen said she thinks
about you all the time.

1000
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:57,482
She never passes a music store...

1001
01:19:57,570 --> 01:20:00,403
...or a concert hall without looking
for your work.

1002
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:01,206
Shut up!

1003
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:03,281
-Whyd you say she was dead?
-Im warning you!

1004
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,725
Whyd you say it? Tell me!

1005
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:09,366
Because she is dead, thats why!
And so are you!

1006
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:16,206
What about my work? My work?

1007
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:18,567
Why didnt she come looking for me?

1008
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:21,448
She couldnt do that, could she?
Why the fuck not?

1009
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,048
Too much trouble, thats why.

1010
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:26,690
I was too much fucking trouble
for everybody!

1011
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:31,406
My whole fucking life, everyone I met,
too much trouble!

1012
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:37,285
Let me tell you something,
you get it together.

1013
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:40,362
Find a way to make it all right!
Dont think you will, but you do!

1014
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:44,238
-You feel sorry for yourself, dont you?
-I got this really good little trick.

1015
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:47,766
You see, youre not human anymore!
None of you! Youre not human!

1016
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:49,681
Youre like goldfish! All of you!

1017
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:53,046
-One dies, I get another one!
-You want human? Ill give you human!

1018
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:55,360
Youre going to blow the back
of your head off!

1019
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,840
Or jump, or hang or do anything
to turn off the pain! Arent you?

1020
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:00,729
-Admit it!
-Im warning you!

1021
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:02,528
Youre gonna do it and you know it!

1022
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:03,565
Take your hands off me!

1023
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:06,722
When you finally do, when all your charm...

1024
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:10,604
...and all the wonderful things
that you could be are gone forever...

1025
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:12,641
...Ill just be left here...

1026
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:17,601
...with an intensely human,
unprofessional rip in my heart.

1027
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:21,046
That terrifies the hell out of me.

1028
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,330
-Elizabeth.
-What?

1029
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,640
What the hell are we doing here?

1030
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:20,489
I dont know.

1031
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:04,923
Would that be a problem for you, Libbie?

1032
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:12,760
Sorry?

1033
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:16,445
Would it be a problem for you
to supervise some additional cases?

1034
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:19,130
No. No, of course not. Thats fine.

1035
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,478
Dr. Bowen?

1036
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:41,443
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1037
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:46,726
You have the most beautiful smile.

1038
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:52,087
I just wanted to say, ´Hello.´

1039
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:09,842
Youre a doctor. You can fix my life.

1040
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:12,525
Right?

1041
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:44,167
-Can I talk to you?
-Yeah, just a sec. Did you see this?

1042
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:57,444
I want to take myself off the Jones case...

1043
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:00,569
...and I was hoping
that you could take over.

1044
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:04,599
-Why?
-What?

1045
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:05,680
Why?

1046
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:13,164
Because I really think its for the best.

1047
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:14,564
The best?

1048
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,522
Its not the best for me.

1049
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:20,129
I slept with him.

1050
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:23,648
You want to say that again.

1051
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:27,202
I slept with him.

1052
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:44,160
For Christs sake! What the fuck
do you think you were doing?

1053
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:50,287
Twelve years of training as a psychiatrist,
and you blow it off!

1054
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:52,008
First of all, youll be fired.

1055
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,605
Then, if Mr. Jones, solid,
stable citizen that he is...

1056
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:59,640
...chooses to press charges,
you could be prosecuted.

1057
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:01,243
You could go to jail.

1058
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:04,768
You could go to fucking jail!
Do you understand that?

1059
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:07,319
-Ill resign.
-Great! Fine! Beautiful.

1060
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:09,122
You fuck one of the patients...

1061
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:12,122
...and all the rest of them lose
one of the best therapists--

1062
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:15,998
Patrick, please. Help me.

1063
01:26:20,530 --> 01:26:22,009
Okay. Come here.

1064
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:28,881
All right, this is the deal.

1065
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:31,963
You cannot see him again.

1066
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:35,247
-I have to see him once to explain.
-Libbie, listen to me.

1067
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:39,801
You cannot see him again.
If you do, I will turn you in.

1068
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:44,438
This is not about protecting myself,
the hospital. Its about him, the patient.

1069
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:46,566
It has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

1070
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:49,881
I would do that. Do you understand?
I would turn you in.

1071
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:51,483
Do you understand me?

1072
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:53,402
-Do you understand me?
-Yes.

1073
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:59,766
There is a line here, all right?
You cannot cross it.

1074
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:04,483
You dont understand.
Its too late. Its too late.

1075
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:11,843
Then Im gonna transfer him
to another hospital.

1076
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:26,919
Mr. Jones?

1077
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,162
Will you please come back?

1078
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:33,887
Mr. Jones, come back!

1079
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:38,278
Mr. Jones!

1080
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:41,278
Come back!

1081
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:45,764
Are you in there?

1082
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:47,323
Mr. Jones, can I help you?

1083
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:48,638
Elizabeth!

1084
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:50,238
Elizabeth!

1085
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,118
Maybe I can help you?

1086
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:54,405
I dont think you can.
Elizabeth can help me.

1087
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:56,208
Youll be moved to another hospital.

1088
01:27:56,290 --> 01:27:57,723
Excellent facility.

1089
01:27:57,930 --> 01:28:01,969
In the meantime, Dr. Rosen will be glad
to help you. Lets go back to the unit.

1090
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:03,608
I dont care about you or him.

1091
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:07,046
If Elizabeth wants me transferred,
I want her to tell me to my face.

1092
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:11,203
Lets talk about it back at the unit.
She cannot talk to you right now.

1093
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:14,043
Dont touch me. I said dont touch me.

1094
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:17,327
Thats okay.

1095
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:19,248
Dont fucking touch me!

1096
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:52,959
Libbie?

1097
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:00,965
Patrick.

1098
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:04,649
Good morning.

1099
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:11,368
-What time is it?
-Its 8"00 p.m.

1100
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:19,118
Im so tired.

1101
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:23,683
Listen, I just wanted to let you know that...

1102
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:26,519
...hes out.

1103
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,558
Who told you?

1104
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:35,203
I have a friend whos a resident at Cal.
They assessed him as being stable...

1105
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:37,804
...and found him co-operative
with the drug program.

1106
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:40,006
So he got himself released.

1107
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,801
Why are you telling me?

1108
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:48,929
-He may try to contact you.
-No.

1109
01:29:51,290 --> 01:29:52,484
No, he wont.

1110
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:55,123
Not me, not anymore.

1111
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:58,199
Im dead.

1112
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:52,719
Hello?

1113
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:57,168
-I´m trying to contact Dr. Bowen.
-This is Dr. Bowen.

1114
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:40,000
I eat take-out Chinese food, right?

1115
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,361
I´m not afraid of death.

1116
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:51,683
People build it up to be something...

1117
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:57,364
...that you should be frightened of, but...

1118
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:02,202
...I´m so ready.

1119
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:07,806
It would be a big relief, actually.

1120
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:12,044
Like a warmth.

1121
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:15,959
Dr. Bowen?

1122
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:20,406
Do you think I´m pretty?

1123
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:34,406
It was like that day we went to the pier
and I got up on the railing.

1124
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:36,560
You thought it was stupid, right?

1125
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:40,607
I can see now you still do.
Yeah, really dumb.

1126
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:44,319
Yeah, I´m going to fall and break my neck.
What´s the point, right?

1127
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:49,768
You see, you don´t understand.
Being up there is the point.

1128
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:56,807
They´re willing to risk everything to get it.

1129
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:05,049
Hi, Elizabeth.

1130
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:10,486
What would you risk everything for?

1131
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:14,443
Is there anything that means
that much to you?

1132
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:22,770
You´re going to listen to this later?
I hope you do.

1133
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:25,410
Save this one, this was a good one.

1134
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:33,725
Whats up?

1135
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,165
Whats this?

1136
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:45,160
-Its my resignation.
-Whatd you do? Kill somebody?

1137
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:52,603
Ive made a mistake.

1138
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:58,082
Ive done something very bad.

1139
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:06,239
Jones?

1140
01:34:19,650 --> 01:34:20,878
Hey, buddy.

1141
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:24,238
-Your bike?
-Yeah.

1142
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:28,886
-What is it, 67?
-68.

1143
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:32,280
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
These are so sweet.

1144
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:35,649
-You got the original Girlings.
-Yeah.

1145
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:38,121
Oil pan problems? Unbelievable.

1146
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:41,759
-You do the paint job too?
-I have an English guy who helps me out.

1147
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:43,442
-Nice, isnt it?
-This is great.

1148
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:45,805
Lets put the key in.
Lets see what its like.

1149
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:48,563
-The engines a little fresh....
-Yeah.

1150
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:52,484
-Sweet, man! Good tune job!
-Yeah.

1151
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:55,403
-This is great. Whered you get it from?
-A shoot.

1152
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:57,202
-What do you do?
-Im a director.

1153
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,882
-Direct what?
-Rock videos.

1154
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:00,289
Rock videos!

1155
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:04,278
Hey, buddy!

1156
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:12,764
Jeffrey, hes got a bike just like yours!

1157
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:21,999
Jones, Mr. Yes.

1158
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:27,799
I would appreciate a call back
as soon as you hear anything at all.

1159
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,120
Hes back! Hes back!

1160
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:44,888
Look at you! Hey, look at this!

1161
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:53,242
I came for my tools, man.

1162
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,161
-I came for my tools!
-Cut the engine!

1163
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,002
Ive come for my tools!

1164
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:01,199
They let you go?

1165
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:04,521
Yeah, tried to keep me, couldnt do it.
Got out, flew away!

1166
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:07,928
-You doin all right?
-Yeah, Im fine. Right as rain.

1167
01:36:08,410 --> 01:36:09,889
Need the tools.

1168
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:14,169
Yeah, I got your tools. Davon,
why dont you go on in the house.

1169
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:19,040
-Davon, 1,492 divided by 68?
-Yeah.

1170
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:21,324
-You got a job?
-Yeah.

1171
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:22,968

01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:29,282
-Broad Street?
-Yes!

1174
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:33,246
-They finished that job.
-No.

1175
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,685
I went there last week.
They finished that job.

1176
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:39,399
No. Talked to the foreman.
Got the job back. Need the tools.

1177
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:42,085
All right.

1178
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:45,443
Ill go get them.

1179
01:36:53,370 --> 01:36:54,485
Relax, man.

1180
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:58,603
Ill be right back.

1181
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:19,007
-Hey, come on in the house.
-Yeah, give me the tools.

1182
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:21,285
You going to stay and have some lunch?

1183
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:23,247
Come in the house and have some lunch.

1184
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:25,969
-Those are my tools?
-Yeah, theyre your tools.

1185
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,684
-Come on, man, what--
-Give me the fucking....

1186
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:33,328
Give me the tools.

1187
01:37:40,210 --> 01:37:41,120
Yeah.

1188
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:49,519
Im sorry.

1189
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:55,407
Thank you for....

1190
01:37:58,570 --> 01:38:00,288
Its not necessary.

1191
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:03,921
Now, the kids would really like
to see you, you know.

1192
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:08,768
Why dont you park the bike,
come in the house and have lunch with us?

1193
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:10,602
How does that sound?

1194
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:17,084
Why dont you ask your wife first?
Ask her.

1195
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:22,088
-I aint got to ask my wife.
-I dont feel right about it. Ask her.

1196
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:24,843
All right. Hey, Thiel!

1197
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:27,842
-No, man, go on.
-All right. Dont you go nowhere, okay?

1198
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:29,045
No, Im....

1199
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:35,365
Watch him.

1200
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:38,559
Hey, man.

1201
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:42,644
