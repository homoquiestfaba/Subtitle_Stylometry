- Hey!
(frenzied music)

17
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:36,188
Hey, hey, hey!

18
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,393
(man exclaims)

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,939
I'm okay, I'm okay.

20
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,772
I'm okay.

21
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:47,294
Don't you tell anyone
what you just saw here.

22
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:48,923
- [Assistant] Yes sir.

23
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:51,298
- I want everyone that
owns a dog executed.

24
00:01:51,298 --> 00:01:52,612
- [Assistant] Executed sir?

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,466
- Fired.

26
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:54,508
- Yes sir.
- Right now.

27
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:55,341
- Yes sir.
- Go!

28
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:56,323
Do it!
- I'll clean it up

29
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:57,573
right away sir.

30
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:01,174
- I've come to the conclusion

31
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:02,512
that you have the ability to run things

32
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:04,935
in my way in my absence.

33
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:06,623
- Thanks.
- Do you hear me?

34
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:09,103
- Yeah, I hear ya.
- Good.

35
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:10,738
- You know it never ceases to amaze me,

36
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:13,002
you put a little bit of
pressure on our opponent

37
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:15,134
they way you did this morning,

38
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,986
they come right around
to our way of thinking.

39
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:19,324
I really had a good time.

40
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:21,349
- It always works.

41
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,069
And everything we do in this company

42
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,916
from now on is gonna work.

43
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,892
Don't forget out
appointment in the morning.

44
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:30,168
I want to play my virtual
reality CD-ROM for you.

45
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:31,118
- Right, at 11.

46
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,848
Hey, why don't we do it now?

47
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:33,860
I've got time.

48
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,382
- No, no.

49
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:39,514
We'll both do it together in
the morning when we're fresh.

50
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:41,190
No, no, I have a better idea.

51
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,570
You will show the CD-ROM at
the stockholder's meeting

52
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,870
a week from today.

53
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,912
Then they will know our cutbacks,

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,030
they will understand your bonus,

55
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,929
and they will see how I can
cut to the bone like a butcher.

56
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:55,673
And if any of those idiot
savant snot pocket kids

57
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:57,347
come up and threaten to quit,

58
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,779
tell 'em they've already been fired.

59
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,446
- You got it.
- Okay.

60
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,587
(spy music)

61
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:15,254
(machine beeping)

62
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,332
Oh boy.

63
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:29,499
It's not easy.

64
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,514
No.

65
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,022
(upbeat music)

66
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,988
And so we will be making sizeable cutbacks

67
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:57,319
in order to remain profitable
for the coming season.

68
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,787
In my absence, Dexter Pearlsley
will be Commander in Chief.

69
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,232
We will be cutting salaries,

70
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:05,365
extended vacations will
be limited to one week.

71
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:08,201
Yearly bonuses will be
eliminated this year

72
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:11,633
and Dexter will discuss our
new animal control policy,

73
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,101
which is very strict, by the way.

74
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,584
There are other sweeping changes

75
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:18,445
which Dexter will send
out to you on your e-mail.

76
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:20,381
And for those of you who wish to,

77
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:23,357
you might start looking for another job.

78
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:26,297
In fact, find one, because in my opinion,

79
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:27,621
you're useless here

80
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:30,301
when you don't have
the courage that I have

81
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:33,145
to make profit no matter what it takes.

82
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:36,553
(tires pealing)
(dramatic music)

83
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:39,720
(thunderous crashing)

84
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,327
- [Woman] What are we to do with him?

85
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,591
- He has no redeeming value whatsoever.

86
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:48,341
The man has never done a good deed

87
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:49,545
in his entire life.

88
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:51,429
- What about the dog?

89
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:53,415
He didn't run over the dog, did he?

90
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:55,564
- His jerking of the
steering wheel was a reflex,

91
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:57,047
hardly an achievement.

92
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,214
(thunderous rumbling)

93
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,194
- That was cool.

94
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:05,148
Where am I?

95
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:10,527
- We've looked long and hard
and couldn't find one moment

96
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,718
that you actually helped
someone other than yourself.

97
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:16,841
- He doesn't like the dogs.

98
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,841
(angels whispering)

99
00:05:25,852 --> 00:05:27,935
- If he wants to go back.

100
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,963
- Well that's cool.

101
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:36,603
They just made a mistake.

102
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:40,059
That's okay, everyone makes mistakes.

103
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:42,441
- That's not what you told your employees.

104
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,597
You remember the ones that made mistakes

105
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:47,391
and then you fired, don't you?

106
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,355
- Yeah.

107
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,369
- Like the temp you fired last week.

108
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:52,737
She needed that job; her mother's sick.

109
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:54,879
Or have you forgotten
about the pregnant girl

110
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,443
who has no insurance
because you cut benefits.

111
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:00,107
- Look at all the cruel and inhuman jokes

112
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:02,887
you played on your brother
and most loyal employee,

113
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:04,304
Dexter Pearlsley.

114
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,829
- So, when do I get to go back.

115
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:13,829
(thunderous rumbling)
(dog barks)

116
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:23,895
- Do you have a problem with dogs?

117
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:25,155
- Yes.

118
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:26,587
- He didn't hit the dog.

119
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,587
(angels whispering)

120
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,092
- It's been decided.

121
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:37,804
They want you to go back as a dog.

122
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:40,268
- Me, as a dog?

123
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:41,185
Going back?

124
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:44,269
I can't stand dogs.

125
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,186
- Your name is Quigley.

126
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:51,533
(playful music)

127
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:54,135
(Quigley barks)

128
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:56,513
- Please tell me you can see me.

129
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:58,035
- Oh they said I'll be the only one

130
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,448
who'll be able to see
you as you once were.

131
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:03,615
Everyone else will see you as Quigley.

132
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,055
- Am I a talking dog?

133
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:08,850
- Oh no, I'm afraid not.

134
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,959
You can talk to me, but I can't help you.

135
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,328
Say you could bark if you like.

136
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:14,557
(scoffs)

137
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:15,559
Why don't you give it a try?

138
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,392
Just.

139
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,652
(barks)

140
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:22,253
That was alright.

141
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:25,003
(dramatic music)

142
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:32,459
(thunder rumbling)

143
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,607
(men exclaiming)

144
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:36,857
You okay there?

145
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:42,703
- You gotta help me.

146
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,367
- Oh not an option Archie.

147
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,537
I'm here to watch and
keep you out of trouble

148
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,475
without lifting a finger to assist you.

149
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:50,021
- Well this isn't good.

150
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,453
Tell me what to do.

151
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:52,961
- They gave you two assignments.

152
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,405
And if you do them well, I
suspect they might consider

153
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:57,811
allowing you through the gates.

154
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,877
- What if I can't do them?

155
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:02,633
- Oh I think they'll find someone else.

156
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:04,716
Someone more cooperative.

157
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:08,987
- Okay.

158
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:09,898
Let's get it over with.

159
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:14,898
- Oh, I don't think they'd
approve of your hurried attitude.

160
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:17,803
- That was a dumb thing to say.

161
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:20,053
Dogs are always in a hurry.

162
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:23,333
(groans)

163
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,166
- Come on.

164
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,097
- Oh, oh, okay.

165
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:27,753
- On your way, on your way.

166
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:30,420
(playful music)

167
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:36,108
- Oh baby, you're so cute.

168
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:38,839
What's his name?

169
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,869
- His name is Quigley and he
loves to have his ears pinched.

170
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,018
- Oh, so precious.

171
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,509
- I know, we have to go right now.

172
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,953
But I'm sure Quigley thanks
you for the ear pinches.

173
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:49,120
Don't you boy?

174
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:51,943
You owned all of this

175
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:55,526
and you never did
anything nice for anyone?

176
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:59,279
- I was in a hurry.

177
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,153
I wanted to be a
multi-billionaire before I was 40.

178
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:03,619
- There's something you need to do

179
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,335
and there isn't much time.

180
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:06,923
- I'm a dog.

181
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,299
- What's that got to do with anything?

182
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,613
- Because dogs don't get along with me.

183
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:11,731
They've never liked me.

184
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,045
They chase me, they bite me.

185
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:14,331
I step in their poop.

186
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:15,569
I hate dogs.

187
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:18,169
- Well that's gonna make
things a bit more, challenging.

188
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:19,002
Isn't it?

189
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:23,109
Well, you're on your own.

190
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:24,967
And good luck.

191
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,603
- Okay, tell me what you want me to do.

192
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:28,292
- It's not what I want you to do.

193
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,961
This is something you
have to do for yourself.

194
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,404
From deep down within your own heart.

195
00:09:33,404 --> 00:09:34,584
If you have one.

196
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:36,965
- I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

197
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:38,224
- I'll see you when you're finished.

198
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:39,641
- Give me a hint.

199
00:09:44,478 --> 00:09:46,679
(thunder rumbling)

200
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:49,012
(spy music)

201
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,314
- What is this?

202
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,392
How many times have I told people

203
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:11,475
to keep this door locked?

204
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:18,408
(door lock clicks)

205
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,234
Well?

206
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:23,672
- I don't know what Archie did with it.

207
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:25,652
- Where could he have hidden the only copy

208
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:28,735
of his prized virtual reality CD-ROM?

209
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,957
The stockholder's meeting is tomorrow.

210
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:32,790
- I know, I know.

211
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,217
- I gave him my word I'd
play the CD on his behalf.

212
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,672
- Well short of tearing his office apart,

213
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:38,641
I'm not sure what else to do.

214
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:39,474
- This is not a good way

215
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:42,705
for me to celebrate my
35th birthday, Sarah.

216
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:43,538
- I...

217
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,256
But happy birthday anyway.

218
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:50,261
Come on, things are gonna work out fine.

219
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:51,094
You'll see.

220
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:55,261
I mean isn't there anything
I can do to help this?

221
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,466
- I was just reading the
last memo I got from Archie.

222
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,393
He envisioned our interactive games

223
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:07,941
to perform like no others.

224
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:10,059
He saw the AC Diamex

225
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:13,711
with the dual pads and
the triple joysticks

226
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:16,155
to be playing in every home in America.

227
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:18,563
- Well I mean they are really fun to play.

228
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,525
You know when you have
to drop one joystick

229
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,501
and just as quickly pick
the other one up again,

230
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:23,334
I mean you can't help

231
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:25,881
but become completely
obsessed with this game.

232
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:26,714
- Exactly.

233
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:30,977
But there are flaws in the system, Sarah.

234
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:33,977
(suspenseful music)

235
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,561
(Quigley whimpers)

236
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:46,421
(man speaking in foreign language)

237
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:50,004
- How someone has been
in my supply closet.

238
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:56,041
(man speaking in foreign language)

239
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:06,195
Someone has placed a
chair in front of the door

240
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:08,528
without folding it up first.

241
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:13,358
I swear this place is full of morons.

242
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:16,142
What is this?

243
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,823
(tense music)

244
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:36,320
(speaking in foreign language)

245
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,964
So, you were here and now you're not.

246
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:58,808
But, I will find you.

247
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:11,085
- Alright, the order of the
day is to find that CD, Sarah.

248
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:14,168
Archie must've had a unique hiding place,

249
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,339
someplace he knew that
none of us would look in.

250
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,578
- Okay, well why is the
CD so important Dex?

251
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:21,396
I mean did Archie solve the
flaws of the AC Diamex player?

252
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:22,229
- No, no, no, no.

253
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:24,879
But I think I've figured out
how to correct the player.

254
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,038
The cost is another matter.

255
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:26,871
I just,

256
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,952
I just don't want everyone thinking

257
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:32,996
that the cutbacks and
the changes are my idea.

258
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:34,913
Archie--
- Is gone, Dex.

259
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,160
Archie is gone.

260
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:40,758
He put his trust in you,

261
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:44,296
so I would have to assume
that whatever changes you make

262
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:48,213
in his absence would be
made with his blessing.

263
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:56,175
- Let's just say that I want
to keep Archie's wishes intact,

264
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:57,008
for now.

265
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:04,089
Now, get somebody downstairs
and have another look around.

266
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,504
That CD's gotta be somewhere.

267
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:06,711
And let's find it.

268
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:07,544
- Alright.

269
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:13,218
(happy music)

270
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:21,579
(spy music)

271
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:31,916
- If Archie thought I was
gonna take responsibility

272
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:36,583
for all these changes, he
really did have a screw loose.

273
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:41,545
Archie!

274
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,254
I know you're wondering what I'm doing.

275
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:47,315
I'm gonna do everything I can

276
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:50,542
to make sure that your last wish happens.

277
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,542
But know this, after I play that CD,

278
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:57,505
I'm doing things my way.

279
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,887
(determined music)

280
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:27,777
- What did you do that for?

281
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,784
I hope God forgives you.

282
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:32,279
- Did you hear what he said?

283
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,536
- I thought you were
learning some self control.

284
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:38,280
Don't you feel some remorse or something?

285
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,759
- Okay.

286
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,762
I'm sure I picked up the keys.

287
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:43,519
But I need the keys to get in my office.

288
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,235
- And what about the really
nice move you just made

289
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,275
on the briefcase?

290
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:49,291
- When dogs have to go, they go quick.

291
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:53,478
And I hurt my knee, lifting my leg to pee.

292
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:56,130
It's not easy being a dog.

293
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,402
I wanna know are you
here to help me or what?

294
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:00,561
- I'm here to observe, not help.

295
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,860
- No one will know.

296
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,676
Are you telling me he
knows every move I make?

297
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,343
- Every single move.

298
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:12,001
- That's not good.

299
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,501
- I'll be outside.

300
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:18,418
(dramatic music)

301
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:45,467
- You must be kidding me.

302
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:49,199
What do they think I am,
the cleaning service?

303
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,199
I am Frank, the janitor.

304
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,976
(scoffs)

305
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,596
what a sad state of
affairs we are living in.

306
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:22,679
(scoffs)

307
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:30,429
(determined music)

308
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:02,237
- Oh, that's, that's
great, that's terrific.

309
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:04,955
I see you really know how to
take great care of yourself.

310
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:05,995
- What's that supposed to mean?

311
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:09,233
- Well I don't see any food or water.

312
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:12,247
This could be a very long night Archie.

313
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:13,080
- Okay.

314
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:16,603
How do I say I'm sorry?

315
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:17,577
- It's a little late for sorry.

316
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:19,551
- No, I'm sincere.

317
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:22,503
I'm sorry, I want to apologize.

318
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,686
- What are you apologizing for?

319
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,549
- Everything.

320
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:26,143
- That's not how it works, Archie.

321
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:29,743
You don't even have a clue
what you've done, do you?

322
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,538
You're so used to being
a jerk all the time,

323
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:34,802
you think that doing wrong is right.

324
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:37,129
I'll see you in the morning.

325
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,712
- Wait, wait, wait.

326
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,440
I am a control freak.

327
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:45,028
I am number one.

328
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:51,768
Until, until just recently.

329
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:55,091
- That's the whole point, Archie.

330
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:57,008
There is no number one.

331
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:00,811
You should've had some friends.

332
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:02,839
And maybe even a girlfriend.

333
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,672
- Why?

334
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:08,199
You can't trust men, you
can't trust your friends,

335
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,680
and women are like dogs.

336
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,385
- You're gonna have a really
hard time with that one.

337
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:14,037
Say listen, while we're on the subject,

338
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:15,441
let me ask you something.

339
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:16,274
- Okay.

340
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:19,057
- What do fire escapes,
bullet proof vests,

341
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,281
windshield wipers and laser
printers have in common?

342
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:23,423
- That's a trick question.

343
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,943
- Nope, but I'll tell you the answer,

344
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:27,519
just so you don't lose any sleep tonight.

345
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,622
All of those things I just named,

346
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:31,539
were invented by women.

347
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:33,967
- No they weren't.

348
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,217
- Have a good night Archie.

349
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:44,478
(gentle music)

350
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:56,949
(Quigley whimpers)

351
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:05,098
- Hi cutie.

352
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:07,643
Hi sweetie.

353
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:12,332
What are you doing in a broom closet, huh?

354
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:13,868
Archie'd have a heart attack if he saw you

355
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:16,052
in his beloved building.

356
00:20:16,052 --> 00:20:18,312
But he isn't here anymore, so.

357
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:20,822
The only person we have to worry about is.

358
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:21,810
- [Dexter] Frank!

359
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,575
Get in here!

360
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:24,707
- Dexter.

361
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:26,920
(dramatic music)

362
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,974
- Frank, there are paw
prints on this desk.

363
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:31,714
- This is impossible.

364
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:33,354
- Could someone have left
a window open last night?

365
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:35,092
(speaking in foreign language)

366
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:37,640
- Not unless someone is
going home after I did.

367
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,140
And I do believe I was the last one

368
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,984
out of the building last night.

369
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:43,453
- Frank, if there is a wild
animal loose in this building,

370
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:46,770
I want it found by
whatever means necessary.

371
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,437
- This I will do, Mr. Pearlsley.

372
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,606
- [Sarah] You're so cute.

373
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:52,439
- Sarah!

374
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:54,827
Is that you?

375
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,693
Sarah?

376
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,422
Sarah what is that?

377
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:08,530
- This is looking like
a dog Mr. Pearlsley.

378
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,697
- Well get it.

379
00:21:11,224 --> 00:21:12,680
- [Frank] Now?

380
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,886
- Yes now.

381
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:14,719
Go!

382
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:17,969
(playful music)
- Doggie!

383
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:19,294
Doggie!

384
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,466
Where are your papers.

385
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:21,299
- Don't hurt him.

386
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,080
- Don't hurt him?

387
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,405
Sarah how could you touch
a wild animal like that?

388
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:27,510
Call the guards.

389
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,424
Call animal control.

390
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:32,916
And someone bring my fishing nets.

391
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,324
Once we have captured that little beast.

392
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:37,754
I want to have a word
with you in my office.

393
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,914
And did you find that CD last night.

394
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:41,824
- No, Dex, we tore Archie's office apart.

395
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:42,694
We didn't find anything.

396
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:43,527
- Oh great.

397
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:44,360
That's just great.

398
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,192
Now I've got a wild animal
loose in the building,

399
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:49,624
a missing CD and a
stockholder's meeting in,

400
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:50,541
four hours.

401
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:55,424
I expected a lot more of you.

402
00:21:55,424 --> 00:22:00,424
Archie would've been very, very
disappointed in you, Sarah.

403
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,530
- Archie didn't even know me Dex.

404
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:09,721
(Frank speaking in foreign language)

405
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:17,046
(Quigley barks)

406
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,807
- You're not a very nice doggie.

407
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,926
If I am not knowing better,

408
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:35,269
I would say as if you are
trying to get even with me.

409
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:38,466
There's something funny here.

410
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:41,887
You wait and see, Mr. Smarty Pants.

411
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:44,804
What goes around, is coming around.

412
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,636
- Got him trapped.

413
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:06,050
You two stick with me.

414
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,002
- What do we do?

415
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:09,249
- Stay with me.

416
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:10,134
- Okay.

417
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:10,967
- Where?

418
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:11,800
- We're going upstairs.

419
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,717
- What for?

420
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,023
- To catch the dog.

421
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:18,998
We're trying to catch a dog, remember?

422
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,754
- Yeah well, why do you
think the dog went upstairs?

423
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:23,394
- I don't know.

424
00:23:23,394 --> 00:23:26,344
Maybe he thought he was
trapped or something.

425
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:27,927
- Who set the trap?

426
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,482
- You know, why don't you
guys just go downstairs

427
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:35,354
and guard the gate?

428
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:38,354
I think I can handle this on my own.

429
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:47,702
- Well someone must
know where the trap is.

430
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:50,020
I don't know what the big deal is.

431
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,853
- How big is the trap?

432
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,940
(dramatic music)

433
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,308
(pensive music)

434
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:11,843
(dramatic music)

435
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,115
- [Dexter] That dog, my desk.

436
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:33,671
- Here, let me get it, I.

437
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:35,987
- Guards, come down to
my office right away.

438
00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:38,937
That dog is waiting here
for you to throw him out.

439
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:39,911
Over.

440
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:40,992
- [Man] Who is this?

441
00:24:40,992 --> 00:24:44,854
And what office are you calling from?

442
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:48,113
- I'm Dexter Pearlsley, who do you think?

443
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,936
- [Man] Uh, I can't hear you very well.

444
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:51,288
Over and out.

445
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:52,871
- Here, tie him up.

446
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,811
- I really think he's trying
to tell us something, Dexter.

447
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:58,489
Look, look in his eyes.

448
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:00,205
- Carol, this Dexter.

449
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:01,896
I want you to get those guards down here.

450
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:05,572
Call animal control so I
can get this filthy beast

451
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:06,705
out of my office.

452
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,538
- [Carol] Yes, Dexter.

453
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,332
- I think I'm gonna keep him.

454
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:17,053
- Don't be ridiculous Sarah, that's a dog!

455
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:18,949
You know how Archie hated
those little varmints.

456
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:21,251
- Dex, Archie is gone!

457
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:22,694
You're the boss now.

458
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:24,541
- Yes, I know.

459
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:27,311
And as the boss, I think
that the company should be

460
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:30,261
run exactly as Archie wanted it run.

461
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:31,665
I mean look at how successful he was.

462
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:32,979
Look at what he accomplished.

463
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,539
- He was miserable.

464
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:35,372
And angry.

465
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:38,127
- Sometimes you just
have to make sacrifices.

466
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:40,272
- So in Archie's case, you
really think all those sacrifices

467
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,439
were worth it?

468
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:45,633
(thoughtful music)

469
00:25:47,406 --> 00:25:48,656
- I don't know.

470
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,365
Why have I never seen you before?

471
00:25:56,365 --> 00:25:57,328
Where have you been?

472
00:25:57,328 --> 00:26:00,578
- I've always been right down the hall.

473
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:04,269
- Look Sarah, we both
have long term contracts,

474
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:06,958
but if we make any mistakes
running this company,

475
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,402
we can be replaced.

476
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:11,109
- Okay well what can I do?

477
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:14,461
- Just organize another
search of Archie's office

478
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:17,423
and I'll take care of this dog thing.

479
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:20,444
(tense music)

480
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:22,864
(growls)

481
00:26:22,864 --> 00:26:23,697
Carol!

482
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,420
- What are you trying to do?

483
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,221
This is incredible.

484
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,384
This absolutely incredible.

485
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:43,846
(pensive music)

486
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,339
You are so cute.

487
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:52,666
I don't get it.

488
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:57,472
Do you want me to open the drawer?

489
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:11,190
What, did you hide something
in there earlier, huh?

490
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,257
There are no dog bones in here.

491
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,007
Trust me on that one.

492
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,303
Oh, I'm not sure what
we should do with that.

493
00:27:25,303 --> 00:27:29,946
There's supposed to be some
pretty disturbing things on it.

494
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:31,363
Wait, Archie wanted that

495
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:34,037
played at the stockholder's meeting.

496
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:35,037
Put it down!

497
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:37,772
No! (gasps)
(CD cracks)

498
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:38,605
No.

499
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:42,642
Oh no.

500
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:48,996
Look what you've done!

501
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:50,715
Look at this.

502
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:53,704
(Quigley barks)

503
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:55,108
- Not a trace of him sir.

504
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:55,977
- Where did you look?

505
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:57,227
- Look, we, um.

506
00:27:59,414 --> 00:28:00,997
I don't know what you mean sir.

507
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:02,423
- The dog.

508
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:04,065
I'm talking about the dog.

509
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:06,180
- We had to look for the nets.

510
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,974
So we wouldn't get attacked. (laughs)

511
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:10,346
But we're ready now sir.

512
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:11,736
That's if you are.

513
00:28:11,736 --> 00:28:13,659
- Who hired you two?

514
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,076
- To do what sir?

515
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:17,637
- Nevermind.

516
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:18,727
Just follow me.

517
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,310
And don't get lost.

518
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:24,022
- Who got lost?

519
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,502
- Lost?

520
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:27,205
How did someone get lost?

521
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,288
Come on, before he tries to ditch us.

522
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,592
- Is that?

523
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:40,359
- [Sarah] Yes.

524
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:47,357
- That was the only copy.

525
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:50,367
What have you done?

526
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:56,716
I'm glad the CD broke.

527
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:58,224
I didn't wanna play it anyway.

528
00:28:58,224 --> 00:29:01,448
- Well what are you gonna
tell the stockholders?

529
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:05,177
- I'm gonna tell them that
our new multi-media player

530
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,208
is gonna knock the socks
off of the competition

531
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:11,003
and that we're gonna need
a larger advertising budget

532
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:11,836
than we thought.

533
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:14,175
- Well should we anticipate
any changes, Dex?

534
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:15,733
- No, no.

535
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:17,399
No changes.

536
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,868
I think Archie would be very proud

537
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:20,777
of what we're about to do.

538
00:29:20,777 --> 00:29:21,610
We're going to see to it

539
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,465
that he didn't life his life in vain

540
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:27,298
and that AC Tech lives on forever.

541
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:31,044
(gentle music)

542
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:33,803
- See, you don't really have to be as mean

543
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:37,136
as people believed Archie to be, do you?

544
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,226
- I hope not.

545
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,595
- This dog is so cute.

546
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:49,791
- Yeah.

547
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,455
- Pet him.
- Huh?

548
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:53,005
- Come on, pet him.

549
00:29:53,005 --> 00:29:54,555
- I don't pet dogs.

550
00:29:54,555 --> 00:29:55,452
- Try.

551
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:56,285
Come on.

552
00:29:58,406 --> 00:29:59,883
- [Dexter] Hello.

553
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,192
- See it's not so bad, is it?

554
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:03,025
- Hey.

555
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:06,965
- Wouldn't it be fun to
have a dog like this?

556
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:09,250
- Would you like to have
dinner with me this evening?

557
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,578
- Yeah, I would.

558
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:11,411
(dramatic music)

559
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:14,031
(guards exclaiming)

560
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:16,459
- [Taller Guard] My arm, my.

561
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:17,765
- [Shorter Guard] Do we get it?

562
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:19,807
- [Taller Guard] I got it.

563
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:20,808
- [Shorter Guard] Alright.

564
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:23,743
(exclaiming)

565
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:24,826
- Stop, stop.

566
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:28,001
- Get out of here.

567
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:30,973
- We just.

568
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:32,723
- This way, this way.

569
00:30:34,145 --> 00:30:37,344
- I'll meet you in my
office in 10 minutes.

570
00:30:37,344 --> 00:30:40,261
- Maybe we're just on a break here.

571
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,549
- Now, where were we?

572
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,690
(gentle music)

573
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,406
Dogs.
- Yes.

574
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:49,239
- I agree.

575
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:52,111
I think dogs would be a great idea.

576
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,603
I mean, who knows,

577
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:57,804
it might be just what I need
to smooth all my rough edges.

578
00:30:57,804 --> 00:31:01,304
Keep me from being so mean, as you put it.

579
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:07,243
Speaking of dogs, where is he?

580
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,910
(Quigley barks)

581
00:31:13,546 --> 00:31:15,296
- This is so strange.

582
00:31:17,317 --> 00:31:21,817
- And wasn't Archie the only
one who knew where the...

583
00:31:24,168 --> 00:31:26,835
(playful music)

584
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:37,830
- So, how'd it go?

585
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,665
- I don't wanna talk about it.

586
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:41,197
- You have a hard time seeing
the good side of things

587
00:31:41,197 --> 00:31:42,483
most of the time, don't you?

588
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,719
- Sweeney, I'm not in the mood.

589
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,747
What is the next assignment, what's next?

590
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:49,205
(thunder rumbling)

591
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:50,538
- Oh I gotta go.

592
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:54,839
- What did I do wrong now?

593
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:56,916
Oh.

594
00:31:58,603 --> 00:32:01,307
(comical music)

595
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:03,724
(man groans)

596
00:32:21,094 --> 00:32:23,011
- You can come out now.

597
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:28,155
- You.

598
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:31,349
(thunder rumbling)

599
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,240
You have no idea how hard this is.

600
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,233
- I think if I'm not
mistaken, they refer to it

601
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:37,880
as a dog's life.

602
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,294
- What's next?

603
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:42,386
- I'm sorry, you in a hurry Archie?

604
00:32:42,386 --> 00:32:45,007
- I'd have a better time
cleaning a short person's teeth.

605
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:45,904
- Oh I see.

606
00:32:45,904 --> 00:32:47,464
So it's just rush in and rush out

607
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:49,648
and that solves everything, right?

608
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:50,848
- They won't let me in heaven

609
00:32:50,848 --> 00:32:53,313
until I complete your assignments.

610
00:32:53,313 --> 00:32:54,676
- I've completed one.

611
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:56,252
Which one is the next?

612
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:59,126
This dog thing is getting old!

613
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:00,512
- Let's take a walk huh?

614
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,316
What do you say big guy?

615
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,847
There's a young family
man, a very good man,

616
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:07,852
who's in dire financial straits.

617
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,700
- As Archie I could easily help.

618
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,440
- Archie's gone.

619
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,028
But they would like Quigley to
try to help with the matter.

620
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:15,861
- Quigley.

621
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,172
(barks)

622
00:33:19,172 --> 00:33:20,436
Who is this guy?

623
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:22,284
- Your brother, Woodward.

624
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:24,117
- My brother Woodward?

625
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,574
I haven't talked to my brother in years.

626
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,491
Woodward is a sap head.

627
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:34,716
He spends more time being married

628
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:38,772
and raising children
than he has sense for.

629
00:33:38,772 --> 00:33:40,152
- So what are you saying?

630
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,620
- I'm saying you can't
help a guy like Woodward.

631
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,948
- Well did you ever try?

632
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:47,494
- (laughs) No reason to.

633
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:48,940
- Tell me something Archie,

634
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,408
do you even know what
he does for a living?

635
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:53,741
What his passion in life is?

636
00:33:56,105 --> 00:33:58,144
- I didn't know he had one.

637
00:33:58,144 --> 00:34:00,054
And I don't care because Woodward takes

638
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:03,278
a lot of his measly salary
and gives it to charities.

639
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:05,216
Now if that's not a sign of weakness,

640
00:34:05,216 --> 00:34:06,330
you tell me what is.

641
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,345
- Giving to charity is a
sign of great strength.

642
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:12,156
You'll understand that Archie.

643
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:13,656
And we have to go.

644
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:18,268
- Wait!

645
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:20,660
You're always walking away.

646
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,160
(happy music)

647
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,622
(dog barking aggressively)

648
00:34:40,057 --> 00:34:41,139
(dramatic music)

649
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,889
(officer laughs)

650
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:53,606
- Okay.

651
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,593
(happy music)

652
00:35:13,075 --> 00:35:16,257
(tense music)

653
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:18,535
(exclaims) Yeah!

654
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:19,368
Yes!

655
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:24,192
(laughs)

656
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:26,858
Oh yeah, I got ya.

657
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,401
I got ya.

658
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:29,234
Oh yeah.

659
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:36,023
(sad music)
(thunder rumbles)

660
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:37,844
- I failed.

661
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:45,522
In my carelessness I lost him.

662
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:49,600
(bluesy music)

663
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:53,715
(dogs barking)

664
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:05,876
(thoughtful music)

665
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:17,308
Quigley, come here boy.

666
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:23,621
I know.

667
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:28,450
Say, you're so omnipresent.

668
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,618
Why don't you tell me where he is?

669
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:32,321
(thunder crashes)

670
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:33,702
I'm sorry.

671
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:35,035
I am, I'm sorry.

672
00:36:38,836 --> 00:36:39,669
Stupid.

673
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:49,283
No, I'm not ready to give up.

674
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:51,689
You gotta remember, I'm
relatively new at this.

675
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:55,106
It's only been maybe, what, 60, 62 years?

676
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:58,384
(dog growling)

677
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,218
(laughs)

678
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,801
(dog barking and growling)

679
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:22,046
Someone musta taken him.

680
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,678
But where would someone take a dog?

681
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:31,595
(thunder rumbling)

682
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:40,669
(jazzy music)

683
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:43,451
- In you go.

684
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:44,701
And in ya stay.

685
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:08,252
(suspenseful blues music)

686
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:27,063
(clattering)
(dogs barking)

687
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:34,212
(laughing)

688
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:36,521
- This isn't funny!

689
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:38,529
- Of course it is.

690
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:41,454
Hey, I'm just happy to see you.

691
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:42,469
You look okay.

692
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:43,520
- I'm not.

693
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,847
Look carefully.

694
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:47,732
A grown man, locked
inside of the dog pound.

695
00:38:47,732 --> 00:38:51,412
Now get me outta here, or adopt me.

696
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,579
Just adopt me.

697
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,133
- How does an observing guardian angel

698
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,133
stage a dog pound break?

699
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:02,396
(door rattles)

700
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:04,943
- They're sending another
dog in here with me.

701
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,943
(suspenseful music)

702
00:39:16,306 --> 00:39:18,889
(bluesy music)

703
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:23,034
(officer babbles)

704
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:26,242
- Into your little jail cell.

705
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:28,242
(sighs)

706
00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:31,964
Ah.

707
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,135
(blows raspberry)

708
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:36,344
Okay.

709
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:37,451
Stay.

710
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,725
(energetic music)

711
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,115
(whistles)

712
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:43,698
(dogs barking)

713
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:51,816
Okay, that's not funny.

714
00:39:53,911 --> 00:39:55,239
That's not funny.

715
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,109
Alright?

716
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:58,140
I'll get 'em both back, you'll see.

717
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,723
Nobody runs away on Wally
Sprigs and gets away with it.

718
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,289
- What's my first move?

719
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:10,031
Because I don't know my brother at all.

720
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:12,853
- Well the way I see it, Archie
didn't know your brother.

721
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:15,770
But you're not Archie now, are you?

722
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,703
- What do I do now that I'm Quigley?

723
00:40:19,703 --> 00:40:20,795
- You got me.

724
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:21,915
- Well I'm drawing a blank.

725
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:23,655
I'm lost, I can't figure it out.

726
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,267
- Well that's fine, but there's a fog bank

727
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:28,017
waiting to collect us if we fail.

728
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:33,875
- Hey, do you remember
you helped me escape

729
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,146
from the dog pound?

730
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:36,111
- I did not!

731
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:36,944
- Yes you did!

732
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:37,777
- I did not!

733
00:40:37,777 --> 00:40:38,957
I only whistled.

734
00:40:38,957 --> 00:40:40,488
It was that stupid man who let you out.

735
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:41,517
I had nothing to do with the fact

736
00:40:41,517 --> 00:40:44,287
that the gate opened wide
enough for you to escape.

737
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:45,591
(growls)

738
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:47,055
- I coulda done that if I was Archie.

739
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:49,113
- You're right, you could have.

740
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,608
Now I'm gonna go take a walk.

741
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:53,402
I'll be around in case
you get, lost again.

742
00:40:53,402 --> 00:40:54,859
- I didn't get lost.

743
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:56,346
- Right.

744
00:40:56,346 --> 00:40:58,596
- I never get lost.
- Right.

745
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:04,719
(thoughtful music)

746
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:09,045
(happy music)

747
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:17,195
(tense music)

748
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:20,738
(barking)

749
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:26,879
(gentle music)

750
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:28,304
- Hey!

751
00:41:28,304 --> 00:41:29,982
What's your name?

752
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:31,526
(giggles)

753
00:41:31,526 --> 00:41:33,373
I'm Megan Channing.

754
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:36,014
Would you like to meet my family?

755
00:41:36,014 --> 00:41:36,847
Okay.

756
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:41,304
You have to be real quiet, okay?

757
00:41:41,304 --> 00:41:44,863
My mommy's name is Joanne and
my brother's name is Brian.

758
00:41:44,863 --> 00:41:47,323
But I guess you don't
have to know that, right?

759
00:41:47,323 --> 00:41:48,866
'Cause you're a dog.

760
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:51,033
(giggles)

761
00:41:59,054 --> 00:42:01,016
- Where'd you get the dog Megan?

762
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:02,538
- He saved my life.

763
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:03,808
- How did he do that?

764
00:42:03,808 --> 00:42:05,658
- Well there was this
truck coming towards me

765
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:07,398
and he pushed me out of the way.

766
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:09,974
- Oh my, when did this happen?

767
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:11,024
- Just now.

768
00:42:11,024 --> 00:42:13,170
My ball bounced in the
middle of the street

769
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,458
and there was this big
truck coming towards me

770
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:17,930
and he pushed me out of the way.

771
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,320
- Cool.

772
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,710
- You should hug the doggie Mama.

773
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,064
- Well yes, I guess I should.

774
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:24,378
(chuckles)

775
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,910
Well he looks well fed.

776
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,224
Why don't we get you both cleaned up

777
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:28,576
and then we'll go look for his owner

778
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:29,914
so he can go back home?

779
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,318
- Can we play with him first?

780
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:34,244
- Well I think someone
must miss him very much.

781
00:42:34,244 --> 00:42:35,245
Don't you guys?

782
00:42:35,245 --> 00:42:37,364
- Can we make up signs that
say that we found a dog?

783
00:42:37,364 --> 00:42:38,322
- Yes, of course we can.

784
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,456
That is a wonderful idea.

785
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:43,306
- If no one wants him,
can we keep him Mama?

786
00:42:43,306 --> 00:42:46,242
- Well it's a little early
to discuss that Brian.

787
00:42:46,242 --> 00:42:47,268
But you know what,

788
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:49,569
why don't you go and get
some of Frisky's food

789
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:52,699
and see if this little guy's hungry?

790
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:54,305
- Frisky was our old dog.

791
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,267
But he died of old age.

792
00:42:56,267 --> 00:42:58,736
He went to heaven where
he can run in the flowers

793
00:42:58,736 --> 00:43:00,712
and tall grass.

794
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:01,585
Huh Mom?

795
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:03,613
- That's right.

796
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:05,613
- We really miss Frisky.

797
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:10,110
- You know why don't we
get you guys cleaned up

798
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,700
and get everybody fed.

799
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,793
And then we'll go make those signs up.

800
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,987
- Can he come with us
when we hang up the signs?

801
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:18,562
- Yeah, of course he can.

802
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,784
We'll use Frisky's old leash.

803
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:21,838
- Okay.

804
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:24,924
(happy music)

805
00:43:24,924 --> 00:43:25,841
Thanks boy.

806
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,081
(playful music)

807
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:35,081
(kids exclaiming)
(Quigley barking)

808
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:51,124
Go get it.

809
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:51,957
Good boy.

810
00:43:55,751 --> 00:43:58,418
(body thudding)

811
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:04,879
(thunder rumbling)

812
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:05,712
- I know.

813
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:10,571
I'm just making sure he
doesn't get lost again.

814
00:44:10,571 --> 00:44:11,988
I won't help him!

815
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:14,954
- [Woodward] Hey guys.

816
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:15,918
- Hey honey.

817
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:17,726
- Hey, who's this?

818
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:21,782
- Well he doesn't have a collar
so we don't know who he is.

819
00:44:21,782 --> 00:44:23,512
- He saved my life Daddy.

820
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:24,823
- He did?
- Um hmm.

821
00:44:24,823 --> 00:44:27,724
- He pushed her out of
the way from a big truck.

822
00:44:27,724 --> 00:44:29,648
So she wouldn't get smashed.

823
00:44:29,648 --> 00:44:31,572
- [Megan] We hung up signs
all over the neighborhood.

824
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:33,639
So his owner can take him back home.

825
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:34,906
- Well that's really smart.

826
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:36,284
Who thought of that?

827
00:44:36,284 --> 00:44:37,414
- I did.

828
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:38,416
- High five.

829
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:39,249
Good job.

830
00:44:39,249 --> 00:44:41,215
- I think we should keep him.

831
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:45,033
- Well, I do owe you a
great deal of gratitude

832
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:47,217
for saving my little girl.

833
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,504
Has he been fed and given some water?

834
00:44:48,504 --> 00:44:49,505
- Yes Daddy.

835
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:53,134
We've been playing with him all day.

836
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:55,652
- Well, so how was your day?

837
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:58,332
- (laughs) You go first.

838
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:02,048
- Well, the delivery service told me

839
00:45:02,048 --> 00:45:03,740
they were cutting back my hours.

840
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,428
So I'll have to find another night job.

841
00:45:05,428 --> 00:45:07,545
But the consulting business is kinda fun.

842
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:08,666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

843
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:10,001
I just wish it paid a little bit more.

844
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:11,252
But I did tell to this guy
how to run his business

845
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:12,514
and he offered me a job.

846
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:13,837
- What kinda job?

847
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:15,360
Good job?

848
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,193
Bad job?

849
00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:17,231
None of the above?
- Well.

850
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:19,314
Nah I mean it's a, it's be a paycut.

851
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:20,576
So it's not gonna work out.

852
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:22,018
- Look, everything will work out

853
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:24,164
when you finish your new video game.

854
00:45:24,164 --> 00:45:25,866
- Look, it's never gonna happen.

855
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:28,414
There's just, there's just
not enough time in the day.

856
00:45:28,414 --> 00:45:31,638
- Your video games are sensational.

857
00:45:31,638 --> 00:45:33,604
And they're almost finished.

858
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:36,582
Besides, you made a promise
to me a long time ago

859
00:45:36,582 --> 00:45:38,492
that you were gonna make
video games for kids,

860
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:41,492
even their parents would approve of.

861
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,335
If only your brother would've
helped us in some small way.

862
00:45:48,335 --> 00:45:51,443
- Look, just, let's not go there, okay?

863
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:54,443
Archie's in his own world someplace.

864
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,132
Look, I asked him for help once, once.

865
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,799
And he completely humiliated me.

866
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:06,552
- You're not angry about the dog, are you?

867
00:46:06,552 --> 00:46:07,385
- No, no.

868
00:46:08,982 --> 00:46:12,164
- Daddy, can the dog go to bed with us?

869
00:46:12,164 --> 00:46:14,297
- No, the dog's still a stranger.

870
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:15,546
But I'll tell ya what.

871
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:18,290
Let's make a bed for
him in the utility room

872
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,746
and put some paper down for him.

873
00:46:19,746 --> 00:46:21,891
That way if he barks if
won't bother any of us.

874
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:23,426
- Okay.
- Alright.

875
00:46:23,426 --> 00:46:24,675
- Bye.
- Goodnight.

876
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:25,925
- Bye.
- 'Night.

877
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:28,876
- We got good kids.

878
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:31,376
(happy music)

879
00:46:42,404 --> 00:46:43,237
Joanne.

880
00:46:48,064 --> 00:46:50,323
- Oh, isn't he cute?

881
00:46:50,323 --> 00:46:53,073
- I think he's reading the paper.

882
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:57,254
- And I think you've
been working too hard.

883
00:46:57,254 --> 00:46:59,959
Why don't you come sit down
and have some breakfast?

884
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:01,387
- No, no, no.

885
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:03,867
I swear, his eyes are
going back and forth,

886
00:47:03,867 --> 00:47:08,784
like he's reading the, the
stock exchange thing down there.

887
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:13,229
(exhales)

888
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:14,865
- Come on.

889
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,198
Okay everybody, grab a hand.

890
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:24,735
Lord, thank you for our many blessings

891
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:28,256
and for the miracle of
life and our health,

892
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:29,647
which we treasure.

893
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:30,730
- [All] Amen.

894
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:34,833
- Looks good.

895
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,251
So has anyone called for the dog yet?

896
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:37,537
- Not one.

897
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:38,758
- Good, we can keep him.

898
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:39,925
- Not so fast.

899
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:43,217
You know that dog belongs
to somebody out there guys.

900
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:44,821
And it's our responsibility to make sure

901
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:46,145
that they get back together.

902
00:47:46,145 --> 00:47:48,419
- Maybe we can check the signs
and see if they're still up.

903
00:47:48,419 --> 00:47:49,577
- Okay.

904
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:52,385
- While we do that, can we bring the dog?

905
00:47:52,385 --> 00:47:53,385
- Excuse me?

906
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:58,297
- While we do that, can we bring the dog?

907
00:47:58,297 --> 00:48:00,781
- Speaking of which, why
don't you take the dog

908
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:04,265
into the backyard and see
if he has to go potty?

909
00:48:04,265 --> 00:48:05,515
- [Megan] Okay.

910
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:09,511
(happy music)

911
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,946
(thunder rumbling)

912
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:26,872
- How you doing, you making progress?

913
00:48:26,872 --> 00:48:28,380
- I might have made a mistake.

914
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,368
- Might've?

915
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:30,450
What's that supposed to mean?

916
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,656
- I shoulda helped him.

917
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:32,723
- [Sweeney] You can still do that.

918
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:35,640
(thunder rumbling)

919
00:48:41,394 --> 00:48:42,604
- No, I can't.

920
00:48:42,604 --> 00:48:43,592
It's too late.

921
00:48:43,592 --> 00:48:44,916
- It's never too late to change Archie.

922
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:46,035
- Look at me.

923
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:47,738
I'm only 10 inches tall.

924
00:48:47,738 --> 00:48:51,201
(playful music)

925
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:52,526
What can I do?

926
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:53,359
- Go help them.

927
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,109
I have to get back in the bushes.

928
00:48:59,863 --> 00:49:01,760
- That was a nice move.

929
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,760
- Thank you.

930
00:49:12,003 --> 00:49:14,836
(Quigley yipping)

931
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:25,567
- [Video Game] You have just
finished level three Megan.

932
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,335
Push the red button to continue.

933
00:49:27,335 --> 00:49:28,838
Use the correct button quickly.

934
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:31,873
You must hurry or start all over.

935
00:49:31,873 --> 00:49:33,641
- Oh, I almost got him.

936
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:35,527
- [Video Game] Lift
off, lift off, lift off.

937
00:49:35,527 --> 00:49:36,670
(kids laughing)

938
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,647
Oh sorry Megan, not enough to give.

939
00:49:38,647 --> 00:49:39,635
- Here.
- Okay.

940
00:49:39,635 --> 00:49:40,468
- [Video Game] Welcome Brian.

941
00:49:40,468 --> 00:49:41,301
It's your turn.

942
00:49:41,301 --> 00:49:42,675
Welcome.
- Hi.

943
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:44,745
Wanna watch my daddy's game?

944
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:46,447
- You think he can play with us?

945
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:48,364
- No, but he can watch.

946
00:49:49,255 --> 00:49:51,505
Come here and sit down.

947
00:49:51,505 --> 00:49:52,338
Come on.

948
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:55,430
This is really neat.

949
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:58,109
- [Brian] You think he understands?

950
00:49:58,109 --> 00:49:59,731
- [Megan] Probably not.

951
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:00,946
- [Video Game] Lift
off, lift off, lift off.

952
00:50:00,946 --> 00:50:01,779
Yes!

953
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:02,612
You made it to level four.
- That's too bad.

954
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:04,392
We could use an extra player.

955
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:05,626
- Three people?

956
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:07,498
- With Mom it would be four.

957
00:50:07,498 --> 00:50:09,630
- You think you could play?

958
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,463
(Quigley barks)

959
00:50:10,463 --> 00:50:11,603
- [Brian] Let's show him how

960
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:14,986
and see if he can use the stick.

961
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:17,017
- He needs hands and fingers.

962
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:18,172
Nevermind.

963
00:50:18,172 --> 00:50:20,474
You can watch if you like.

964
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:21,307
- Hello.

965
00:50:21,307 --> 00:50:22,140
- Hey.

966
00:50:24,048 --> 00:50:25,986
I have something I wanna show you.

967
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:27,948
- Oh yeah?
- Um hmm.

968
00:50:27,948 --> 00:50:28,781
Come here.

969
00:50:30,756 --> 00:50:31,589
- Yes!

970
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:34,787
- Nice one.

971
00:50:34,787 --> 00:50:36,309
- That is the reason

972
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:41,309
you're going to finish your
video games, Mr. Channing.

973
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:45,226
- What would I ever do without you?

974
00:50:45,226 --> 00:50:48,099
- You'd think of something.

975
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:49,349
- Unimaginable.

976
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:52,912
(kids laughing)

977
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:55,214
(Quigley barks and growls)

978
00:50:55,214 --> 00:50:57,547
(chuckling)

979
00:51:01,273 --> 00:51:02,975
- Do you think if the signs are still up

980
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:05,704
we'll be able to keep the dog?

981
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:07,513
- If no one wants him back,

982
00:51:07,513 --> 00:51:10,500
I'm sure Mom and Dad
would let us keep him.

983
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,025
- But what if the signs are gone?

984
00:51:13,025 --> 00:51:15,584
- Then we'll have to make up more signs.

985
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:17,869
- We don't wanna keep
someone else's dog, do we?

986
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:19,369
- No, I guess not.

987
00:51:20,226 --> 00:51:22,878
- Promise me you won't
tell anyone where I went.

988
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:23,711
Promise?

989
00:51:24,971 --> 00:51:26,155
- Yeah.

990
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:27,582
But you promise to come right back

991
00:51:27,582 --> 00:51:30,473
after you check if the
signs are still up, right?

992
00:51:30,473 --> 00:51:31,759
- I'll come right back.

993
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:32,851
- Okay.
- Now stay in my room

994
00:51:32,851 --> 00:51:34,359
and pretend we're playing together.

995
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:35,359

(bright country music on radio)

1013
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:08,819
- (laughs) you're not very funny.

1014
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:12,526
(barking)

1015
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:14,276
You have to go potty?

1016
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,927
What, are you afraid
I'm gonna lock you out?

1017
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:25,323
How about if I leave the door open?

1018
00:53:25,323 --> 00:53:28,445
Listen to me, I'm talking to a dog.

1019
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:29,278
Oh boy.

1020
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,633
Why aren't you playing with the kids?

1021
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,613
Hmm.

1022
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:40,761
Megan, Brian?

1023
00:53:49,523 --> 00:53:51,069
Megan!

1024
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:51,902
Brian?

1025
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:57,708
Brian, where's your sister?

1026
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:58,779
- I don't know.

1027
00:53:58,779 --> 00:53:59,612
- What do you mean?

1028
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:00,533
She was just up here playing with you

1029
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:01,366
a few minutes ago.

1030
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:02,419
Wasn't she?

1031
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:03,252
- Yeah.

1032
00:54:03,252 --> 00:54:04,821
- Well then where is she?

1033
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:05,654
Brian!

1034
00:54:08,877 --> 00:54:09,841
- She went out.

1035
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:10,947
- She went out?

1036
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,191
What do you mean she went out?

1037
00:54:12,191 --> 00:54:13,443
Where, when?

1038
00:54:13,443 --> 00:54:14,285
- I don't know.

1039
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:16,118
- Brian, Brian, think.

1040
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,446
- I don't know!

1041
00:54:19,446 --> 00:54:20,619
- Alright, come on, let's go.

1042
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:23,869
(tense dramatic music)

1043
00:55:20,578 --> 00:55:23,487
Woodward, Megan went out this morning

1044
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,421
and I can't find her anywhere.

1045
00:55:25,421 --> 00:55:27,377
(Woodward's voice garbles)

1046
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:30,604
No, I haven't called the police yet.

1047
00:55:30,604 --> 00:55:31,904
(Woodward's voice garbles)

1048
00:55:31,904 --> 00:55:32,737
Okay.

1049
00:55:59,382 --> 00:56:00,602
- Do you wanna go after him?

1050
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:02,970
- Uh, he can find his way back.

1051
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,303
Um, what about our daughter?

1052
00:56:06,894 --> 00:56:08,142
- Nothing yet.

1053
00:56:08,142 --> 00:56:09,768
But it's just been a short while.

1054
00:56:09,768 --> 00:56:13,378
She's probably right here in
the neighborhood somewhere.

1055
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:15,037
- Our baby's out there all alone.

1056
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:16,968
Please help us find her.

1057
00:56:16,968 --> 00:56:20,182
- Do you have a recent photo
of your daughter Ms. Channing?

1058
00:56:20,182 --> 00:56:21,804
- Of course.

1059
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:23,054
Please come in.

1060
00:56:26,432 --> 00:56:28,932
(tense music)

1061
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:35,593
- Hey, we're gonna need some help.

1062
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:36,426
- I know.

1063
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,320
- Well do something then!

1064
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,153
- I can't.

1065
00:56:38,153 --> 00:56:39,452
- No, do something, do something.

1066
00:56:39,452 --> 00:56:40,285
- I can't.

1067
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:41,668
I'm just an observing guardian angel.

1068
00:56:41,668 --> 00:56:43,126
Listen Archie.

1069
00:56:43,126 --> 00:56:43,959
- What?

1070
00:56:46,135 --> 00:56:48,201
- Can I have a hug?

1071
00:56:48,201 --> 00:56:49,228
- What?

1072
00:56:49,228 --> 00:56:50,344
- A hug.

1073
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:51,177
- No!

1074
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:53,697
Hey, hey!

1075
00:56:53,697 --> 00:56:56,947
(barking and growling)

1076
00:56:59,314 --> 00:57:01,666
Why did you do that?

1077
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:03,997
- I hope you have what it
takes to solve this problem.

1078
00:57:03,997 --> 00:57:05,080

Oh my God are you okay?
- Megan.

1120
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,574
- That's quite a dog you've got there.

1121
01:00:13,574 --> 01:00:14,488
- What do you mean?

1122
01:00:14,488 --> 01:00:15,903
- He found her and was bringing her home

1123
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,653
when we located them.

1124
01:00:18,735 --> 01:00:20,789
- Thank you boy.

1125
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:22,233
Thank you.

1126
01:00:22,233 --> 01:00:24,075
- Well everything seems to be okay.

1127
01:00:24,075 --> 01:00:25,873
You folks have a good evening.

1128
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:27,928
- Thank you.
- thank you.

1129
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:29,178
- Our pleasure.

1130
01:00:30,718 --> 01:00:31,749
- Are you okay?
- Uh huh.

1131
01:00:31,749 --> 01:00:32,727
- Alright?

1132
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:35,560
- [Joanne] You scared us to death.

1133
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:42,418
(thunder rumbling)

1134
01:00:49,121 --> 01:00:50,538
- So I was wrong.

1135
01:00:54,307 --> 01:00:58,585
Hey, isn't this the reason
we never give up on people?

1136
01:00:58,585 --> 01:00:59,661
- Yeah.

1137
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:01,015
- Come on.
- Good boy.

1138
01:01:01,015 --> 01:01:02,031
- Look, lookie, lookie.

1139
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:02,948
Oh, oh, oh.

1140
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,243
(laughing)

1141
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,071
Nice going Brian.

1142
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:15,239
- Nice going Brian.

1143
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:17,097
Bet you can't throw one that far.

1144
01:01:17,097 --> 01:01:19,971
- How are we gonna get
the ball back smartie?

1145
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:22,638
(playful music)

1146
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:31,083
(Sweeney exclaims)

1147
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,340
- Hey.

1148
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,262
(laughs)

1149
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:41,364
That's funny.

1150
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,108
Why are you so muddy and wet?

1151
01:01:43,108 --> 01:01:44,592
- Have you forgotten something?

1152
01:01:44,592 --> 01:01:45,656
- Such as?

1153
01:01:45,656 --> 01:01:46,984
- The reason you're here.

1154
01:01:46,984 --> 01:01:50,506
- Oh, I'm still trying to figure that out.

1155
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:53,546
But it's not easy for a
dog to give man money.

1156
01:01:53,546 --> 01:01:55,602
- You're not supposed to
give him money Archie.

1157
01:01:55,602 --> 01:01:56,770
- I'm not supposed to give him money

1158
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:59,006
but I'm supposed to help
him with his finances?

1159
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,819
That doesn't make sense.

1160
01:02:00,819 --> 01:02:03,468
- You're supposed to save him from ruin.

1161
01:02:03,468 --> 01:02:04,301
Remember?

1162
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,952
Now you have until tomorrow.

1163
01:02:06,952 --> 01:02:07,992
- That's impossible.

1164
01:02:07,992 --> 01:02:09,174
- Look, I gotta go.

1165
01:02:09,174 --> 01:02:10,162
I'm filthy.

1166
01:02:10,162 --> 01:02:11,656
- Shake yourself dry.

1167
01:02:11,656 --> 01:02:13,348
- [Sweeney] That's your job Archie.

1168
01:02:13,348 --> 01:02:15,515
- Just shake yourself dry.

1169
01:02:18,808 --> 01:02:22,058
(bright country music)

1170
01:02:27,553 --> 01:02:28,867
- Hey.
- Hey.

1171
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:29,737
Hey kids.

1172
01:02:29,737 --> 01:02:31,320
- Hi Dad.
- Hey Dad.

1173
01:02:37,145 --> 01:02:39,291
- Thank you for all of your help kids.

1174
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:40,124
- Um hmm.

1175
01:02:41,288 --> 01:02:43,801
Can we play video games
before we go to bed?

1176
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,999
- For one hour and not a minute longer.

1177
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:46,832
- But Mom!

1178
01:02:46,832 --> 01:02:48,159
- If you argue.

1179
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:49,163
(laughing)

1180
01:02:49,163 --> 01:02:50,717
- Brian, no arguing.

1181
01:02:50,717 --> 01:02:52,357
- Okay.
- Come on.

1182
01:02:52,357 --> 01:02:54,440
Come on doggie, let's go.

1183
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,903
(gentle music)

1184
01:03:07,045 --> 01:03:08,878
- What happened today?

1185
01:03:11,082 --> 01:03:13,832
- Well, first they cut the hours.

1186
01:03:15,143 --> 01:03:17,393
And then they cut the jobs.

1187
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:24,258
And mine was one of the ones eliminated.

1188
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,106
- I have to go back to work Woody.

1189
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:33,332
- Look, the kids need you here.

1190
01:03:33,332 --> 01:03:34,433
It'll be alright.

1191
01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:37,753
- You know I could, work part time.

1192
01:03:37,753 --> 01:03:39,217
Some place close to the house.

1193
01:03:39,217 --> 01:03:42,235
That way I wouldn't be
gone for long periods.

1194
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:45,473
- No, I, I don't want some
stranger coming into this house

1195
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:47,137
taking care of the kids.

1196
01:03:47,137 --> 01:03:49,191
Look, what I'll do is
I'll put the games on hold

1197
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:50,024
for a couple of weeks

1198
01:03:50,024 --> 01:03:53,024
until I can find another second job.

1199
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:58,992
You've already got a
full time job right here.

1200
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:10,550
(playfully suspenseful music)

1201
01:04:48,423 --> 01:04:50,669
- [Video Game] Welcome to Tiny-Tails!

1202
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:52,892
Player, identify yourself.

1203
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:57,211
Welcome Archie, what would you like to do?

1204
01:04:57,211 --> 01:04:59,107
Let's start a new game.

1205
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:02,607
Come on Archie let's play skip the stones.

1206
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:14,305
Up higher, higher, higher.

1207
01:05:14,305 --> 01:05:17,305
Sorry Archie, better luck next time.

1208
01:05:31,284 --> 01:05:33,951
Welcome to episode four, Archie.

1209
01:05:36,654 --> 01:05:38,615
Are you ready to play the game?

1210
01:05:38,615 --> 01:05:40,782
Let's play surprise party.

1211
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,504
Good choice.

1212
01:05:43,504 --> 01:05:45,754
This is a fast game Archie.

1213
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:49,674
Buckle up.

1214
01:05:51,863 --> 01:05:53,160
(toilet flushing)

1215
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,660
(tense music)

1216
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:18,603
You are now starting episode five.

1217
01:06:18,603 --> 01:06:20,631
You have entered the surprise area.

1218
01:06:20,631 --> 01:06:22,464
You decide if you can.

1219
01:06:25,907 --> 01:06:27,259
Good choice Archie.

1220
01:06:27,259 --> 01:06:29,592
Let's see how smart you are.

1221
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,907
(rooster crows)

1222
01:06:38,387 --> 01:06:41,304
(thunder rumbling)

1223
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,333
(sad music)

1224
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:09,118
- Hey, everybody up.

1225
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:13,201
Last one to the kitchen
has to do all the dishes.

1226
01:07:29,491 --> 01:07:31,741
What's that crazy dog done?

1227
01:07:35,173 --> 01:07:38,006
- (gasps) No dog.

1228
01:07:41,777 --> 01:07:42,880
- [Megan] What did he do?

1229
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,207
- Everybody just get in the car.

1230
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:46,299
Let's go, he's got my game!

1231
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:47,133
Get in the car, get in the car.

1232
01:07:47,133 --> 01:07:48,419
- [Megan] What are we gonna do?

1233
01:07:48,419 --> 01:07:49,597
- [Woodward] Get in the car,
we're gotta get the car.

1234
01:07:49,597 --> 01:07:50,430
- [Brian] I don't know.

1235
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:52,489
(frantic music)

1236
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:53,676
- Where is he going?

1237
01:07:53,676 --> 01:07:57,784
- I don't know, but
those are my only copies!

1238
01:07:57,784 --> 01:08:00,701
(brakes squealing)

1239
01:08:10,972 --> 01:08:11,979
What got into him?

1240
01:08:11,979 --> 01:08:14,514
- Maybe he wants to play
the games all by himself.

1241
01:08:14,514 --> 01:08:16,780
- Wow, can he do that?

1242
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,613
- Maybe.

1243
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:21,544
- This crazy dog.

1244
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:22,882
- Don't be so hard on him.

1245
01:08:22,882 --> 01:08:24,064
He's just a puppy.

1246
01:08:24,064 --> 01:08:25,897
- I know Dad, come on.

1247
01:08:34,862 --> 01:08:36,445
- Where's he going?

1248
01:08:49,134 --> 01:08:49,967
(tense music)

1249
01:08:49,967 --> 01:08:51,800
- [Business Man] Whoa!

1250
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:57,744
(guards exclaiming)

1251
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,802
- What kind of a place is this?

1252
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,034
- Some sort of technological
development place I think.

1253
01:09:03,034 --> 01:09:04,117
Come on kids.

1254
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:08,590
- Hey there little fella.

1255
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:09,423
Hi.

1256
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,193
Sarah!

1257
01:09:12,256 --> 01:09:15,754
Look, an old friend
stopped by to say hello.

1258
01:09:15,754 --> 01:09:16,846
Hi.

1259
01:09:16,846 --> 01:09:18,064
(chuckles)

1260
01:09:18,064 --> 01:09:19,457
- He looks thirsty.

1261
01:09:19,457 --> 01:09:21,003
I'll get him some water.

1262
01:09:21,003 --> 01:09:21,836
- Thanks.

1263
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:25,177
(Quigley whimpers)

1264
01:09:25,177 --> 01:09:26,400
- Okay yeah, now I really think

1265
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,150
he's trying to tell us something.

1266
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:32,194
(Quigley barks)

1267
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:33,027
- What, do ya think the dog

1268
01:09:33,027 --> 01:09:36,343
wants to play the CDs or something?

1269
01:09:36,343 --> 01:09:39,331
- Yeah, I definitely think
he wants you to play the CD.

1270
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:42,077
- Sarah the dog's cute,
but this is ridiculous.

1271
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,244
Alright, alright, alright.

1272
01:09:49,277 --> 01:09:52,027
- [Guard] He has that crazy look.

1273
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,490
- Where do you look to see crazy?

1274
01:10:04,003 --> 01:10:04,842
(Dex laughing)

1275
01:10:04,842 --> 01:10:05,927
- [Video Game] Farther, farther, farther.

1276
01:10:05,927 --> 01:10:07,633
- This is the best game I've ever played.

1277
01:10:07,633 --> 01:10:09,595
I mean it's far better than
anything we've ever developed.

1278
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:10,635
- [Sarah] Oh yeah.

1279
01:10:10,635 --> 01:10:11,927
- [Video Game] Sorry
Dexter, maybe next time.

1280
01:10:11,927 --> 01:10:12,831
- There he is.

1281
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:14,939
Hey, hey, what are you
doing with my games?

1282
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:15,772
- Your games?

1283
01:10:15,772 --> 01:10:17,059
The dog brought them in.

1284
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:18,566
- Why do you look so familiar to me?

1285
01:10:18,566 --> 01:10:20,959
- Look, I've never seen you
people before in my life.

1286
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:22,443
Just give me back my games.

1287
01:10:22,443 --> 01:10:23,276
- Wait a minute, wait.

1288
01:10:23,276 --> 01:10:24,715
Do you know what we do here?

1289
01:10:24,715 --> 01:10:25,964
- You're into technology.

1290
01:10:25,964 --> 01:10:26,797
- Partly.

1291
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,553
- Can we take it from the top?

1292
01:10:29,553 --> 01:10:30,461
- No.

1293
01:10:30,461 --> 01:10:33,387
I want my games back and
then we'll all just leave.

1294
01:10:33,387 --> 01:10:34,299
- Daddy.

1295
01:10:34,299 --> 01:10:36,083
- Not now Megan.

1296
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:39,027
- My name is Dexter Pearlsley.

1297
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:42,241
And I run this place with
a bunch of other people,

1298
01:10:42,241 --> 01:10:43,991
including Sarah here.

1299
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,843
These games are the best we've ever seen.

1300
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,389
And we've been developing video games here

1301
01:10:49,389 --> 01:10:50,414
for over 10 years.

1302
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:51,351
- Daddy!

1303
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:52,470
- Uh yes, Pumpkin?

1304
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:54,537
- They make some of the
games you call trash.

1305
01:10:54,537 --> 01:10:55,370
See?

1306
01:10:59,023 --> 01:10:59,958
- She's right.

1307
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:00,791
She's right.

1308
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:02,455
It's all garbage.

1309
01:11:02,455 --> 01:11:04,808
But do you have any more like these?

1310
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:06,975
- Several unfinished ones.

1311
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:10,685
- Well, if we were to offer you,

1312
01:11:10,685 --> 01:11:14,004
say half a million dollars
to develop video games

1313
01:11:14,004 --> 01:11:17,355
exclusively for us, what
would you say to that?

1314
01:11:17,355 --> 01:11:20,021
(stifling laughter)

1315
01:11:20,021 --> 01:11:21,521
- Please, say yes.

1316
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:24,301
When can he start?

1317
01:11:28,795 --> 01:11:29,712
- Uh hello?

1318
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:31,509
Hi.

1319
01:11:31,509 --> 01:11:32,511
Dexter.

1320
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:33,344
You are?

1321
01:11:33,344 --> 01:11:35,357
- Oh I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1322
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:36,477
Woodward, Woodward Channing.

1323
01:11:36,477 --> 01:11:38,438
And this is my wife Joanne
and these are my children.

1324
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:40,013
This is Megan and Brian.

1325
01:11:40,013 --> 01:11:41,013
- I knew it.

1326
01:11:41,989 --> 01:11:45,213
You're Archie's brother, aren't you?

1327
01:11:45,213 --> 01:11:48,555
- Archie's brother, I didn't
know Archie had a brother.

1328
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:50,021
- Well for the most part

1329
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:53,296
I didn't know I had a brother either.

1330
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:56,001
- Well why didn't he
ever bring you in here?

1331
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:57,759
I mean, did he know what you can do?

1332
01:11:57,759 --> 01:11:59,381
- Um, no, no.

1333
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,709
We weren't very close.

1334
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:01,981
- Well we wouldn't have
known about you at all

1335
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:03,087
if it weren't for your dog.

1336
01:12:03,087 --> 01:12:03,920
- Yeah.

1337
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,375
- Oh he's not their dog.

1338
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:09,001
I saw the signs you put
up in the neighborhood.

1339
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:11,315
And then when I came
over you all raced out

1340
01:12:11,315 --> 01:12:14,648
and I had to rush over here to find you.

1341
01:12:15,704 --> 01:12:18,063
- Is he really your dog?

1342
01:12:18,063 --> 01:12:18,896
- Yes.

1343
01:12:22,053 --> 01:12:26,136
His name is Quigley and
he's my very best friend.

1344
01:12:27,825 --> 01:12:29,489
I've been looking all over for him.

1345
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:32,072
(Quigley yips)

1346
01:12:33,776 --> 01:12:36,929
Well, I can't thank you enough

1347
01:12:36,929 --> 01:12:38,385
for taking such good care of him.

1348
01:12:38,385 --> 01:12:40,718
It really means a lot to me.

1349
01:12:43,467 --> 01:12:47,247
Are you ready to go home now Quigley?

1350
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:48,747
- Goodbye Quigley.

1351
01:12:54,595 --> 01:12:57,262
- Yeah, now we lost two doggies.

1352
01:13:00,173 --> 01:13:02,090
- I, I just wanna know,

1353
01:13:03,903 --> 01:13:04,903
if he can't,

1354
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,733
how did you guys...

1355
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:12,832
Nevermind.

1356
01:13:12,832 --> 01:13:14,499
- Um, you know kids,

1357
01:13:16,627 --> 01:13:20,321
Sarah and I were so fond of that dog

1358
01:13:20,321 --> 01:13:23,063
that we went out and we found
a whole litter of puppies

1359
01:13:23,063 --> 01:13:26,063
that look exactly like your Quigley.

1360
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:29,719
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking Dex?

1361
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:32,423
- I think we're on the same page.

1362
01:13:32,423 --> 01:13:34,243
To seal the deal,

1363
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,989
why don't you follow us
downtown this afternoon,

1364
01:13:36,989 --> 01:13:39,925
when we go to pick up our puppy.

1365
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:42,217
- There are five puppies.

1366
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,811
- And they all look like Quigley?

1367
01:13:43,811 --> 01:13:44,644
- Exactly.

1368
01:13:47,361 --> 01:13:49,920
- Well that would be wonderful.

1369
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,107
If he turns out to be
half the dog Quigley was,

1370
01:13:52,107 --> 01:13:53,774
we'll be very lucky.

1371
01:13:55,057 --> 01:13:57,057
- Can I show you around?

1372
01:14:06,259 --> 01:14:07,483
(determined music)

1373
01:14:07,483 --> 01:14:08,585
- Okay.

1374
01:14:08,585 --> 01:14:11,835
That went pretty well, don't you think?

1375
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:17,721
(thunder rumbling)

1376
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:19,804
It's not too bad, was it?

1377
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:33,827
- I'm glad I'm finally
getting to know my brother.

1378
01:14:36,243 --> 01:14:37,576
He's a nice guy.

1379
01:14:41,127 --> 01:14:43,210
(laughs)

1380
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:48,175
(thunder rumbles)

1381
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:49,384
- [Sweeney] I think you did great.

1382
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:51,801
Personally, I'm on your side.

1383
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,907
- Ah, phew, well I'm back.

1384
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:00,000
And, I did good.

1385
01:15:02,075 --> 01:15:05,742
- You did the no no on
that man's briefcase.

1386
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:12,253
- That was wrong.

1387
01:15:12,253 --> 01:15:16,569
- [Man] You almost caused
several accidents in your haste.

1388
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:17,571
You continue to behave

1389
01:15:17,571 --> 01:15:21,238
as though are the only
one that's important.

1390
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:24,161
- I did find the girl.

1391
01:15:24,161 --> 01:15:26,967
- Yes, after you forgot to watch her

1392
01:15:26,967 --> 01:15:29,947
and she slipped out of the house.

1393
01:15:29,947 --> 01:15:33,937
- You're still rough around
the edges, Archer Channing.

1394
01:15:33,937 --> 01:15:37,437
Still taking shortcuts at others' expense.

1395
01:15:38,593 --> 01:15:39,426
- I know.

1396
01:15:41,009 --> 01:15:41,935
Next time--
- There is

1397
01:15:41,935 --> 01:15:44,483
no such thing as next time.

1398
01:15:44,483 --> 01:15:47,225
There are no second
chances Archie Channing.

1399
01:15:47,225 --> 01:15:50,709
You are what you are, a
miserable human being.

1400
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:52,775
The only thing you've ever cared about

1401
01:15:52,775 --> 01:15:54,141
is yourself.

1402
01:15:54,141 --> 01:15:57,058
(thunder rumbling)

1403
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,111
- I mean when I go back.

1404
01:16:04,111 --> 01:16:06,694
- [God] There is no going back.

1405
01:16:09,155 --> 01:16:09,988
- Ah.

1406
01:16:13,783 --> 01:16:16,004
There gotta be a way.

1407
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:17,971
There has got to be a way to do this.

1408
01:16:17,971 --> 01:16:20,633
I can't leave everything like it is.

1409
01:16:20,633 --> 01:16:22,547
- Unfortunately--
- No, no,

1410
01:16:22,547 --> 01:16:24,729
I can't leave everything like it is.

1411
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:26,783
- [God] What you've done is done.

1412
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:29,200
And nothing will change that.

1413
01:16:31,228 --> 01:16:32,811
- I'll do anything.

1414
01:16:34,879 --> 01:16:36,157
Wait!

1415
01:16:36,157 --> 01:16:38,355
- [God] You cannot earn
your way into heaven

1416
01:16:38,355 --> 01:16:41,409
by doing good deeds Archie.

1417
01:16:41,409 --> 01:16:45,826
The only way into heaven is
by faith and faith alone.

1418
01:16:56,425 --> 01:16:58,675
(exclaims)

1419
01:17:03,406 --> 01:17:05,953
- Is the dog alright?

1420
01:17:05,953 --> 01:17:06,824
- Dog?

1421
01:17:06,824 --> 01:17:08,488
- Yes, there was a dog.

1422
01:17:08,488 --> 01:17:10,963
- I don't think there
was a dog Mr. Channing.

1423
01:17:10,963 --> 01:17:11,910
You're a very lucky man

1424
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:14,986
to have survived such a terrible accident.

1425
01:17:14,986 --> 01:17:17,486
God must be watching over you.

1426
01:17:18,382 --> 01:17:19,215
- Hmm.

1427
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,469
Oh, why are you saying that?

1428
01:17:23,596 --> 01:17:24,803
- Well you only have a few scratches

1429
01:17:24,803 --> 01:17:26,522
and not one broken bone.

1430
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:30,605
The police still can't
believe that you're alive.

1431
01:17:34,672 --> 01:17:35,505
- Whew.

1432
01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:39,297
I gotta use a phone.

1433
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:40,493
- Of course.

1434
01:17:40,493 --> 01:17:44,160
And then you can check out and go home.

1435
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,577
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1436
01:17:57,014 --> 01:17:58,026
- Hello Dexter?

1437
01:17:58,026 --> 01:17:59,029
- [Dexter] Hello.

1438
01:17:59,029 --> 01:18:01,550
- I'm ready to come
home from the hospital.

1439
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:03,138
Could you please come and get me?

1440
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:04,764
- [Dexter] Yeah, yeah okay.

1441
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:07,218
- Yes, and have you found the CD-ROM?

1442
01:18:07,218 --> 01:18:08,466
- [Dexter] Nope, I can't find it.

1443
01:18:08,466 --> 01:18:10,522
- Okay, that's not good.

1444
01:18:10,522 --> 01:18:11,690
We have to destroy that.

1445
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:13,342
I don't want anyone to
see what's on there,

1446
01:18:13,342 --> 01:18:14,644
because it's not good.

1447
01:18:14,644 --> 01:18:15,684
- [Dexter] Yeah, yeah--

1448
01:18:15,684 --> 01:18:17,802
- No, it's not good.

1449
01:18:17,802 --> 01:18:20,818
And I have other things I
wanna talk to ya about too.

1450
01:18:20,818 --> 01:18:23,318
(happy music)

1451
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,430
- Amazing how fast you recovered.

1452
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:32,020
Don't forget to take your medication.

1453
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:33,887
- Okay, thank you.

1454
01:18:33,887 --> 01:18:35,554
Thank you very much.

1455
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:37,527
Did you get it?

1456
01:18:37,527 --> 01:18:38,360
- Yes.

1457
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,193
I got it.

1458
01:18:39,193 --> 01:18:41,257
It is a little confusing though.

1459
01:18:41,257 --> 01:18:43,299
(laughing)

1460
01:18:43,299 --> 01:18:44,819
- Good, let's go.

1461
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:46,986
(mutters)

1462
01:18:53,056 --> 01:18:57,760
There's gonna be some more
changes to the company as well.

1463
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,790
People who have pets,
now have my permission

1464
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:02,780
to bring those pets to
work with 'em every day

1465
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,280
so they can be close together.

1466
01:19:06,354 --> 01:19:09,082
And there will be immediate raises

1467
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:12,476
for every employee that
has a job well done.

1468
01:19:12,476 --> 01:19:14,414
And I'm beginning this right now.

1469
01:19:14,414 --> 01:19:16,664
Our profit sharing program.

1470
01:19:17,548 --> 01:19:21,798
So all employees can be
rewarded for their loyalty.

1471
01:19:24,984 --> 01:19:27,244
- Are you alright sir?

1472
01:19:27,244 --> 01:19:28,827
- Yes, I'm alright.

1473
01:19:30,194 --> 01:19:32,458
I wanna go see my brother.

1474
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:33,291
- Your brother?

1475
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:35,786
I didn't know you had a brother.

1476
01:19:35,786 --> 01:19:37,918
- I haven't seen him in years.

1477
01:19:37,918 --> 01:19:39,346
Let's surprise him.

1478
01:19:39,346 --> 01:19:40,846
1461 Juniper Lane.

1479
01:19:46,894 --> 01:19:47,727
Thank you.

1480
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,180
- You say something Archie?

1481
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,180
- Yes I did.

1482
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:57,998
Thank you for putting up
with me during my bitterness.

1483
01:19:58,902 --> 01:20:00,485
And my selfishness.

1484
01:20:03,808 --> 01:20:05,641
I am going to ask you.

1485
01:20:08,096 --> 01:20:10,253
I've already made up my mind.

1486
01:20:10,253 --> 01:20:11,753
You're my partner.

1487
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:13,623
Equally.

1488
01:20:16,638 --> 01:20:18,888
How do you feel about that?

1489
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,254
- Thanks Archie.

1490
01:20:22,254 --> 01:20:25,087
(exuberant music)

1491
01:20:40,805 --> 01:20:43,472
(Quigley barks)

1492
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:51,476
- Who is this?

1493
01:20:57,483 --> 01:20:59,733
Oh you've gotta be kidding.

1494
01:21:05,531 --> 01:21:06,364
- Oh.

1495
01:21:09,951 --> 01:21:11,965
I want to know if you
could find it in your heart

1496
01:21:11,965 --> 01:21:13,132
to forgive me.

1497
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:16,694
- What do you want Archie?

1498
01:21:16,694 --> 01:21:19,779
- I want to know you for who you are.

1499
01:21:19,779 --> 01:21:21,977
I wanna know your family.

1500
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:25,485
And I want you to know
me for who I am now.

1501
01:21:25,485 --> 01:21:26,671
- Why?

1502
01:21:26,671 --> 01:21:27,504
- Why not?

1503
01:21:29,815 --> 01:21:30,855
- Why not, exactly.

1504
01:21:30,855 --> 01:21:31,688
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1505
01:21:31,688 --> 01:21:34,783
This is my partner, Dexter Pearlsley.

1506
01:21:34,783 --> 01:21:36,561
(whispering)

1507
01:21:36,561 --> 01:21:39,435
- Look, is this another one
of your cruel jokes, Archie?

1508
01:21:39,435 --> 01:21:42,114
Because if it is, you should just leave.

1509
01:21:42,114 --> 01:21:43,685
- It's been a long time.

1510
01:21:43,685 --> 01:21:46,138
- It's been too long.

1511
01:21:46,138 --> 01:21:49,210
Brian, Megan, I'm your long lost uncle,

1512
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:52,095
that hadn't been here for
ya like he shoulda been.

1513
01:21:52,095 --> 01:21:54,386
And I found something very unknown to me.

1514
01:21:54,386 --> 01:21:55,919
- What did you find?

1515
01:21:55,919 --> 01:21:56,752
- Life.

1516
01:21:57,673 --> 01:21:58,506
My life.

1517
01:21:59,431 --> 01:22:01,119
I didn't know I had one.

1518
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:02,904
I didn't even know it was there.

1519
01:22:02,904 --> 01:22:05,709
- (scoffs) Are you alright?

1520
01:22:05,709 --> 01:22:08,531
- I'm better than I've ever been.

1521
01:22:08,531 --> 01:22:12,281
I just, came out of a
never ending nightmare.

1522
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:17,928
So I've come here to ask
for your forgiveness.

1523
01:22:20,633 --> 01:22:24,391
- You've always been
welcome at our house Archie.

1524
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:25,391
- Oh Joanne.

1525
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:29,868
Thank you.

1526
01:22:29,868 --> 01:22:31,618
It means a lot to me.

1527
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:37,831
I want to know everything
about your games.

1528
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:40,146
- How do you know about my games?

1529
01:22:40,146 --> 01:22:43,773
- I've been to a very special place.

1530
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:46,761
I don't know how I got there,
I don't know where it is,

1531
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:50,727
but I was given good
visions of who I really am.

1532
01:22:50,727 --> 01:22:53,549
This is the bravest thing I've ever done.

1533
01:22:53,549 --> 01:22:55,466
Because it's the truth.

1534
01:22:58,867 --> 01:23:01,617
I have a surprise for the family.

1535
01:23:07,662 --> 01:23:08,495
(kids exclaiming)

1536
01:23:08,495 --> 01:23:10,162
His name is Quigley.

1537
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:12,801
- Hi.

1538
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:13,801
Oh hi there.

1539
01:23:19,003 --> 01:23:19,984
- Let's go.

1540
01:23:19,984 --> 01:23:22,019
We're a family again.

1541
01:23:22,019 --> 01:23:22,983
Let's go to the car kids.

1542
01:23:22,983 --> 01:23:24,983
