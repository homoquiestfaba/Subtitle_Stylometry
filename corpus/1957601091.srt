We'll need the identification
of the body.

4
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:34,801
Get somebody on that, Charlie.

5
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,595
Not the best day
in the world for it.

6
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:38,347
Not exactly of our choosing.

7
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:40,474
Uh, it's just that everyone
in Strathcroy

8
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,309
had been up all night
at the big dance.

9
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,019
What? Including the deceased?

10
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:45,354
More than likely, I'd say.

11
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:46,813
-Everyone.
-Oh, everyone?

12
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,482
Is that a fact now?

13
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,525
[man 1] How long's the body
been in the water?

14
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,444
[man 2] No more
than a couple of hours.

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,905
[man 1] What did you think?
Accident, was it?

16
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:57,783

Henry, what's it to be,

00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,887
[Edie] Good morning, Mrs. Aird.

It's a beautiful day.

-We're going to Gleneagles.
-Are you?

Well, I hope the weather
lasts for you.

Excuse me, Isobel.

Oh.

That's good.

and Lord Balmerino

52
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:15,290
actually own the village?

53
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,541
[Isobel] Oh, not anymore.

54
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,668

with Aird Electronics?

Yes. It's his firm.

60
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:28,470
You might meet his wife.

61

No, if he's ready.

-Henry.
-Henry, come on.

71
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,051
Bye, sweetie. Mwah.

72
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:10,095

73
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:18,645

-Thanks.

00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:20,271
Come on.

00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,023
[Henry] Bye.

76
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:23,108
Love you, baby.

77
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,609
[Henry] See you this afternoon.

78
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,331
Here. Henry, get me the office,
will you?

[phone ringing]

80
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,801
Hello, Balnaird.

81
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:50,802
Hi, mommy.

82
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:52,137
Well, hello, Henry.

83
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:54,013
-[Henry] You okay?
-Yes. I'm doing very well.

84
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,349
-How are you?
-[Henry] I'm fine.

-I love you, mommy.
-You have a great day.

I love you, sweetie.

87
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,312
-[Henry] Bye, mommy.
-[chuckles] Bye.

88
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,612
Morning, Vi.

89
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:11,072
Hello, Archie.

90
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,616
Oh, feeding the 5,000?

91
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:16,703
Uh, well, the tourist season
is upon us already.

92
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,705
Oh, indeed. I just met them.

93
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,750
What would my father
have thought, eh?

94
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,420
Lord Balmerino running errands?
What's the world coming to?

95
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,465
He'd probably have said,
"My son's a bloating idiot."

96
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,133
Bye, Vi.

97
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,016
-Vi.
-Oh.

98
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:39,726
Oh, let me drop you home.

99
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:42,020
No. I'm fine, Verena.

100
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,856
Nonsense. This shopping's
far too heavy.

101
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:47,400
Actually, I have a favor
to ask you.

102
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,195
Oh? Well, what's it this time?

103
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,947
Library petition,
off-road horses?

104
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:56,034
Agnes and I are planning a dance
for Katy's 21st.

105
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:58,203
A really big one,
with a proper band

106
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:00,080
for the reels
and highland fling.

107
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,123
A disco for Katy's
London friends.

108
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:03,249
A marquee.

109
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,251
[Violet] Heavens.
When is this to be?

110
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,920
September, I thought, the 16th.

111
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:09,589
The day after my birthday.

112
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:16,930
So the dance can be
your birthday party as well.

113
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,683
Oh, I always have a picnic
up by the loch.

114
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:22,894
Hmm, personally,
I always find the loch

115
00:08:22,894 --> 00:08:24,145
rather gloomy, don't you?

116
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,524
Well, I find it beautiful.

117
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:29,150
The loch's very special.

118
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,444
I'm inviting everyone.

119
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,530
The Blaires,
the Ferguson Crombies,

120
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,782
the Melbournes,
Lord and Lady McCliston, I hope.

121
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,450
Then there's you, of course.

122
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,370
[Violet] I thought
you had a favor to ask me.

123
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,454
Yes.

124
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,790
I want to send an invitation
to Archie's sister.

125
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,583
Pandora? But...

126
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,753
[dramatic music playing]

127
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:52,257
But she was long
before your time, surely.

128
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:54,884
Yes. We are newcomers after all.

129
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:56,886
We've only lived here 10 years.

130
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,805
Look.

131
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,058
Vi, my dear, I wouldn't dream
of asking personal questions,

132
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:05,603
but, well, Pandora's name
comes up from time to time,

133
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:07,355
and there's this stiffening.

134
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,024
I assume there's some
ancient scandal

135
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:11,901
but nobody will say anything.

136
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:15,864
You Scots are so frightfully
well-behaved, aren't you?

137
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:17,490
In public, anyway.

138
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,827
Oh, are we?
Biscuit, Verena?

139
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,453
You're doing it now.

140
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:25,874
Look, this is
a little awkward.

141
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:29,419
It seems that Lord
and Lady McCliston

142
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,796
met Pandora at some gallery
in Monte Carlo

143
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:33,715
and took quite a shine to her.

144
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:37,969
Well, I've rather given them
the impression that--

145
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:40,013
Pandora's coming to the dance.

146
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:42,849
[Verena] They'll definitely
be expecting to see her.

147
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:45,184
And I rather hope that you...

148
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:46,853
Certainly not.

149
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,148
She hasn't been here
for nearly 20 years.

150
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:52,984
I really don't think

151
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:54,861
this is a very good idea,
Verena.

152
00:09:56,404 --> 00:09:58,573
Yes. Well...

153
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,911
Alexa's still living
it out in London, is she?

155
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,714
[Martin] Hi.

156
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:17,550
Can we join you?
My name is Martin.

157
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,760
-Oh.
-Hi.

158
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,220
I'm a designer,
fabrics and textiles.

159
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,597
-Really?
-Yes.

160
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,265
Hope you didn't design that tie.

161
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:27,936

We're going on.

168
00:10:57,465 --> 00:10:59,342
There's a stack of logs
to split.

169
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,718
I best get on with it.

170
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,929
I hate it when the change over
is on the same day.

171
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:03,888
It's such a rush.

172
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:06,057
And the silver needs cleaning.

173
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:07,809
I'm good at that.

174
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:09,811
I'll give you a hand later.

175
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,690

[Neil] Hi, Alexa.

178
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,299
Uh, remember me?
From the nightclub.

179
00:11:39,674 --> 00:11:41,259
Hmm, no.

180
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:43,136
[door closes]

181
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,351
[doorbell buzzes]

182
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:53,896
[Alexa] Oh, great.

183
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:02,363
-[Isobel] Darling, tea.
-Yes.

184
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,906
I'll, um... I'll put it down.

185
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,617
[Archie] Leave it, darling.
I'll do it.

186
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:09,162
Oh, it's all right.
It's really not that heavy.

187
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,423
Here you are, Neil.

188
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:21,424
Thank you.

189
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:24,135
I recognize this face.

190
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,138
[Alexa] Possibly.
It's my father.

191
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,058
Aird? Edmund Aird?

192
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:31,392
Yeah.

193
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:33,478
Of Aird Electronics, yeah?

194
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:36,731
Yes. I don't usually
tell people.

195
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:41,319
[Neil] Oh. I'm impressed.

196
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:46,240
And, uh, this must be
your mother.

197
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,910
No, no, no, no.
That's my stepmother.

198
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,747
My-- my mother died
when I was really young.

199
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,211
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,796
-Um...
-Well...

201
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,509
Look, um, thanks for the drink.

202
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:06,094
Um, I better get going.

203
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:07,178
Not at all.

204
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:09,472
Thanks very much for bringing
my address book around.

205
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,558
I'm sorry I was so rude
on the doorstep.

206
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,643
That's all right.

207
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,394
Not the first time
I had a front door

208
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,397
slammed in my face,
nor the last, I should think.

209
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,439
-Goodbye.
-Um...

210
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,692
I was just gonna get myself
something to eat.

211
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:25,613
You could stay for some supper,
if you like.

212
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,282
Well, uh, thank you.

213
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:30,493
Yeah. I'd like that very much.

214
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:34,831
[cheerful music playing]

215
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:48,261
[indistinct chatter]

216
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,107
Here we are. Just in time.

217
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,942
I think that's
your bus over there.

218
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,652
Just a moment.

219
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,321
It's been lovely having you.

220
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:08,656
-Thank you so much.
-I do hope you come back.

221
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:09,824
It's so nice.

222
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:11,701
[indistinct chatter]

223
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:15,538
-Oh.
-Oh. Hello, dear.

224
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:16,747
Isobel?

225
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:17,832
Verena.

226
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,294
The new brochures.

227
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,795
Ah. Rather good.

228
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,505
-Don't you think?
-Yes.

229
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:28,426
"Stay as a guest
in a private house.

230
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:30,636
Experience the hospitality
and grandeur

231
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,472
of Scotland's loveliest homes.

232
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,682
Meet as friends,
the ancient families

233
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,225
who live in them."

234
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,186
We're not
an ancient family, Verena.

235
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:39,270
Ancient enough,

236
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,564
as soon as they hear
Archie's a lord.

237
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:44,025
Archie's grandfather
had a factory.

238
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,860
No need to go into that, dear.

239
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,740
Ladies and gentleman,
this is Lady Balmerino,

240
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,284
-[man] How do you do?
-your hostess for the next week.

241
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:55,077
Why don't you all
have another cup of tea?

242
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:58,706
And I'll tell Lady Balmerino
about the slight change of plan.

243
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:00,625
Now, Isobel, the thing is,

244
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,418
your two chaps
have had really rather...

245
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:05,046
-[phone ringing]
-Oh, excuse me.

246
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:10,885
Verena Steynton.

247
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:12,428
-[man] Uh, Mrs. Steynton?
-Yes?

248
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,805
-It's about your marquee.
-Oh, yes.

249
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,100
Now, we shall want
your largest marquee.

250
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:20,102
September the 16th.

251
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,479
Oh, good.

252
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:24,315
Next Wednesday at 11:00.

253
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,067
Excellent.

254
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,194
Goodbye.

255
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:30,780
I've been meaning to tell you,

256
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,200
we're giving a dance
for Katy's 21st.

257
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,118
Everyone's coming.

258
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:37,411
Lord and Lady McCliston.

259
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:38,871
I hope you and Archie,
of course.

260
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,706
And Lucilla must come.

261
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,166
Well, I don't know about
Lucilla.

262
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,918
She's still wandering
about Europe.

263
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:46,128
She may not be back
before the end of the summer.

264
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,756
I think you have to be
a little firm, Isobel.

265
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,300
Katy had odd ideas too,

266
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,344
but I told her
the year in Switzerland

267
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:55,429
and the secretarial course
came first.

268
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,181
She could do anything
after that.

269
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,058
They're children, dear.

270
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,434
Oh, yes.

271
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:03,062
And I'm thinking
of inviting Pandora.

272
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:05,982
Pandora?

273
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,818
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

274
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:09,944
What on Earth's the problem?

275
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,696
Everyone behaves as though

276
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,698
she was some sort
of social outcast.

277
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,701
Nonsense.

278
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,788
She and Archie were very close.

279
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,873
So tell me,
what's all the fuss about?

280
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:24,083
You knew her.

281
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,003
How would you describe Pandora?

282
00:16:30,214 --> 00:16:31,841
[Isobel] Pandora was...

283
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,930
the most beautiful creature
I've ever seen.

284
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,476
Full of life, high spirits,

285
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:45,396
dazzling.

286
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,149
Sounds like
the perfect party creature.

287
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:49,608
Good.

288
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:51,902
-[Edmund] Mr. Samada.
-[Mr. Samada] Hello.

289
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:53,070
[Edmund] It's Edmund Aird.

290
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,196
Good morning, Mr. Aird.

291
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:56,991
Listen, as my colleague
explained to you when you met,

292
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:59,327
we both have a deal
awaiting signature in Malaysia,

293
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:03,164
but we need a more positive
reaction from your people.

294
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:05,499
[Mr. Samada] Well, we have been
very flexible in that point.

295
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:06,917
Now, we both have the figures.

296
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,711
I think we should settle this
without delay.

297
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:11,213
I can be in Kuala Lumpur
on, uh...

298
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:12,423
Friday.

299
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:13,507
-On Friday.
-Okay. Well,

300
00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:15,926
I believe I can bring
new proposals to the table.

301
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:16,802
Good then.

302
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,263
Good on Friday.
I'll see you then, yes.

303
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:20,765
-Goodbye.
-[Mr. Samada] Bye.

304
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:22,933
George, I'm flying out
to meet Samada.

305
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,311
I've told them
they have to improve the deal.

306
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,438
[George] I've been leaning
on them as hard as I dared.

307
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:29,065
Yes, I know that.

308
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,524
The point is, so do they.

309
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:32,026
Malaysians like to speak
to the boss.

310
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:33,152
It makes a difference.

311
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,403
[George] If you say so.

312
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:36,822
Jane, the conifer investments,

313
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,283
can you get out all the
correspondence on that?

314
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:40,910
And make fresh copies
of everything,

315
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,745
including the accountant's
breakdowns.

316
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:46,666
And, uh, mark one to the
attention of Lord Balmerino.

317
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:52,046
Oh, and get on
to Temple Hall School.

318
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:53,839
I want to speak
to the headmaster at home.

319
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,341
Tell him it's urgent.

320
00:17:58,719 --> 00:17:59,845
Edmund.

321
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:05,434
Look, I understand you stepping
in on the Malaysian deal.

322
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:07,144
I couldn't swing it
and you saved the day

323
00:18:07,144 --> 00:18:08,687
and I'm grateful to you for it.

324
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,273
But the supercomputer
is my special field.

325
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:12,817
I've been in it
from the beginning.

326
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,276
Well, we had to ride fast.

327
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,028
Do you realize
how many millions are riding

328
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,822
on this particular set
of signatures?

329
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:20,408
Yes. I prepared the figures,
if you recall.

330
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:22,618
I should have taken
the Malaysian meeting.

331
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,537
Look, I'm late
for a meeting, George.

332
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,413
We'll settle it later.

333
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:28,249
That's exactly the problem.
You're never here.

334
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:31,335
Edmund, you can't take on
everything yourself.

335
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,671
The company needs you here.

336
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:36,549
I happen to own
this company, George.

337
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,176
I'm fully aware what it does
and does not need.

338
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:40,553
Thank you.

339
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:47,560
Daddy, what's a supercomputer?

340
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,771
Well, that's, uh-- that's
rather difficult to explain.

341
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:54,358
But, basically, they all compute
at an unbelievable rate.

342
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,444
But even that is
all old hat now.

343
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,447
It's all Pentium technology now.

344
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,740
Pentium? Oh, I learned
about that in school.

345
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,825
Good.

346
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,994
Here, put that in the car,
would you?

347
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,873
You know, he really
coming along very well.

348
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:11,625
I'm not sure he's getting
enough stimulation

349
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,626
at his local school.

350
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:14,545
When I get back, we'll look
into that whole question

351
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:15,796
of boarding school again.

352
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,548
[Virginia] But you know
how I feel about that.

353
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:20,759
[Edmund] Yeah, but think
about the boarding schools...

354
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,844
[Virginia] Edmund.

355
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,554
[Edmund] Boarding school.
Boarding school.

356
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:25,222
Boarding school.

357
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:26,682
[computer beeping]

358
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,019
Wow.

359
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:33,481
[Henry] I don't really
have to go

360
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:35,191
to boarding school, do I?

361
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:37,234
[Virginia] Try not to worry
about it now.

362
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,153
I'll talk to your dad
when he gets home.

363
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:41,655
[Henry] If dad bought you
a supercomputer,

364
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,658
you could ask it to do
millions of things.

365
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,204
It sort of breaks down
the questions into little bits,

366
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:52,124
and all the bits get put back
together at the same time.

367
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,959
It's magic.

368
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,004
[Violet] Henry,
it sounds very clever.

369
00:19:57,505 --> 00:20:00,090
I'm going to come up and see
your computer in a moment,

370
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,635
but I just want to have a word
with your mother.

371
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,761
[Henry] Okay.

372
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,226
-[Violet] Virginia.
-Yeah?

373
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,727
Are you all right?

374
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:13,604
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

375
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,899
You know, with Edmund gone
all the time.

376
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:21,737
He mentioned, uh,
boarding school

377
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:23,364
for Henry again.

378
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:25,699
I guess we have to have
a proper discussion.

379
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:28,452
Discussion? With my son?

380
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:30,704
Oh, dear.

381
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:34,083
Would you like me to try and...

382
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,876
No, no, no. I can handle it.

383
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:41,215
It's just that,
even after all this time, I--

384
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:45,553
sometimes, I still feel...
I feel like an outsider.

385
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:50,891
[dramatic music playing]

386
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:52,935
[Isobel] You're about to see
another of Strathcroy's

387
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:54,311
favorite lost causes.

388
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:57,648
Although it seems help is at
hand from the grouse syndicate.

389
00:20:58,274 --> 00:20:59,733
The village church.

390
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:04,321
Archie's grandfather built it,
but it's about to fall down,

391
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:06,574
-I fear.
-[woman] Oh, dear.

392
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:08,033
Oh, there's no need to worry.

393
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,452
I don't think it's likely
to collapse this very minute.

394
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:13,038
[car engine rumbles]

395
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,178
[Archie] Hello, Virginia.

396
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:30,681
-[Virginia] How are you?
-Hmm. Fine, thanks.

397
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:32,391
-Is Edmund home?
-No, he's not.

398
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,726
He's away on business.

399
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,269
Kuala Lumpur of all places.

400
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:38,731
Oh. Well, I wonder if you could
give him a message for me?

401
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,025
I've had a letter
from the grouse syndicate.

402
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,067
What letter?

403
00:21:42,443 --> 00:21:45,654
Well, they're offering to cover
the cost of the church rewiring.

404
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,282
-[Virginia] Really?
-How marvelous.

405
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:49,366
Yeah. That's great.

406
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:51,577
Well, no, I'm not
entirely happy about it.

407
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,954
In fact, I mean,
the grouse syndicate

408
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:55,539
is a commercial activity.

409
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:58,959
We have to ask ourselves
what they want in return.

410
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:01,253
Well, I'm afraid
you'll have to talk to Edmund

411
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,047
-when he gets back.
-No. Uh, I mean,

412
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:05,591
I really rather had enough
of the grouse syndicate

413
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,051
behaving as if
they own the place.

414
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:09,178
Which, in a way, they...

415
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:11,430
Which, in a way, they do.
Point taken, Vi.

416
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,684
Um, anyway, would you thank
Edmund for his offer?

417
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,519
I wouldn't like him
to think me rude.

418
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,937
Well, I'll mention it to him.

419
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,481
Although, I don't know
what he'll say.

420
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:22,983
Thanks. Well, I'll see you soon.

421
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:24,360
Vi, can I give you a lift?

422
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,070
Oh, I think I'll walk.
Thanks.

423
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:29,531
Right. Oh, right. Well,
is Edie not with you today?

424
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:32,034
[Violet] Poor Edie has got
rather a lot in her mind

425
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,035
at the moment.

426
00:22:33,744 --> 00:22:36,080
Remember her cousin, Lottie?

427
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,373
[Archie] Oh, heavens, yes.

428
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:39,500
That awful woman used to
work here for a while.

429
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,585
Used to snoop around
hiding behind doors,

430
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:43,504
just smashing the crockery.

431
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:44,588
That's the one.

432
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,256
Dotty Lottie,
we used to call her.

433
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:47,841
I must say she gave me
the shivers.

434
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:50,177
I had visions of her rushing in
with a carving knife.

435
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:51,845
[Virginia] Oh.

436
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,899
Lottie, that's getting
on everyone's nerves a bit.

437
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:05,609
Could you not stop it, now?

438
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,947
I like the sound it makes.

439
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,370
[Archie] Nice to see you,
Virginia.

440
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,663
-[Virginia] Bye-bye.
-Bye.

441
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,711
-Archie.
-Something on your mind, Vi?

442
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:26,964
You ever hear from Pandora?

443
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:29,591
Occasionally.

444
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,552
The odd postcard, you know.

445
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:35,014
Verena Steynton's planning
to invite her to the dance.

446
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,849
What? She can't do that.

447
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,017
If she does, who'll tell Edmund?

448
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:43,522
Well, she won't come so there's
no point in discussing it.

449
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,901
Archie, it's been 20 years.

450
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:50,279
You were so close once.

451
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,823
Can you honestly say
you don't want to see her?

452
00:23:56,785 --> 00:24:00,164
Verena said something to me
which actually made sense.

453
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:05,961
She said, "You Scots
are so horribly well-behaved."

454
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,713
Don't you think
there's something to be said

455
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,923
for actually blowing up
once in a while?

456
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,467
No. Lord, no.

457
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:14,344
Heat without illumination
is not very useful.

458
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:16,930
Bye, Vi.

459
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:33,280
[dramatic music playing]

460
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:45,561
[grunts]

461
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:52,943
[dramatic music playing]

462
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:02,160
[Virginia] Go on out.
I'll feed you later.

463
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,829
[Edmund] Hello? I'm back.

464
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,540
Hello. You're early.

465
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:08,917
-Mm.
-Mm.

466
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,294
I don't wanna get butter
on you.

467
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:12,254
Hmm. Hey, that looks good.

468
00:26:13,297 --> 00:26:14,548
Where's Henry?

469
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:15,549
Not back yet.

470
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,175
Good. I wanna talk to you.

471
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:19,845
I didn't come directly home.

472
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,847
I went down to Temple Hall
to see the headmaster.

473
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,600
-Why?
-Oh, to talk things over

474
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,476
and get things settled.

475
00:26:27,144 --> 00:26:28,395
What things?

476
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,689
What things?

477
00:26:31,648 --> 00:26:34,401
Temple Hall can take Henry
in September.

478
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:36,028
As a boarder?

479
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:39,239
[scoffs] Well, he could
hardly attend as a day boy.

480
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,661
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

481
00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:46,872
-What?
-You had no right

482
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,332
to go there without me.

483
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:51,418
Henry is my child
as much as he is yours.

484
00:26:51,418 --> 00:26:53,128
And you go sneaking off
behind my back

485
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:54,171
without even a word?

486
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,758
I did not sneak off
and I'm telling you now.

487
00:26:57,758 --> 00:26:59,760
Well, now it is completely done.

488
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,555
Look, Henry goes back to
the village school in two weeks.

489
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,390
He's getting on
really well there.

490
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,226
He's made great friends.

491
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,394
Edmund, did you
even think about that?

492
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,521
Listen, the place came up
at the very last moment,

493
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:12,439
so I decided...

494
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:14,274
You decided?

495
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:17,069
Why do you always make
the decisions?

496
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,154
Oh, because I always have,
I suppose.

497
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:22,449
Look, you have always known
that I don't want Henry

498
00:27:22,449 --> 00:27:24,618
to go away to school.
Not yet.

499
00:27:24,618 --> 00:27:25,577
He's too young.

500
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:27,329
-I went.
-Oh, yes.

501
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:29,289
I know you went when
you were eight years old,

502
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,500
but why should he?
It's barbaric.

503
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,294
It's crazy to send little kids
away from home.

504
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,798
Look, he can go to Strathcroy
until he's 12,

505
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:39,633
then he can go away
to boarding school.

506
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:41,426
But not yet, no.

507
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,553
[Edmund] But why mock
him out as an oddity?

508
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:45,430
I know that American kids
seem to...

509
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,599
[Virginia] This has nothing
to do with being American.

510
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,103
This is what any normal mother
feels about her child.

511
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:53,647
It is you who's on
the wrong track, Edmund,

512
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:57,109
but you could never even admit
that possibility, could you?

513
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,610
You're just
thinking of yourself.

514
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,320
No. I am thinking of Henry.

515
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:03,073
Henry's just eight years old.

516
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:04,700
He's barely had
a good nursery.

517
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,452
He needs his home.
He needs us.

518
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:09,997
[Edmund] Of course,
it'll be hard on Henry.

519
00:28:09,997 --> 00:28:12,249
It's hard on all of them.
It's competitive and tough.

520
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:14,459
And the sooner they
realize that, the better.

521
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:17,170
In my view, Henry's far
too dependent on you.

522
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,672
-[Virginia] I'm his mother.
-Yes,

523
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:20,465
and you're behaving
like a spoiled child,

524
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,800
and maybe that's my fault.

525
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:25,012
I think it's time
you damn well grew up!

526
00:28:25,012 --> 00:28:26,680
Bull shit!

527
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:28,223
[door slams]

528
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,686
[dramatic music playing]

529
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,118
[thunder rumbles]

530
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:58,086
[Isobel] Quickly, everybody.

531
00:28:58,086 --> 00:28:59,296
Get inside. That's it.

532
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:00,797
[indistinct chatter]

533
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,342
[Archie] Now, you said
you'd like to see

534
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,469
the countryside
at another time of year.

535
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:08,055
Well, this is how it looks
in September.

536
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,601
[woman] You know, Archie,
you could put all this on video

537
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,436
and make your life
a whole lot easier.

538
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:18,482
[dramatic music playing]

539
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:20,567
Good gracious.

540
00:29:21,902 --> 00:29:24,738
Well, this isn't just
old family stuff.

541
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:26,615
I'd forgotten
it was on this roll.

542
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:28,283
[Violet] Who's that?

543
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:30,452
[Archie] Ah. Well, now.

544
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:32,746
That's my sister, Pandora.

545
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:10,867
[man] Reservations.
Can I help you?

546
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:11,910
Yes.

547
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,411
I'd like to book a flight.

548
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,205
Your first flight to London
in the morning.

549
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:16,623
[man] Passenger's name, please?

550
00:30:16,623 --> 00:30:17,958
Name is Aird.

551
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,543
Virginia Aird.

552
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:21,253
[man] Will you be paying
by credit card?

553
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,420
Yeah.

554
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,424
[dramatic music playing]

555
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,688
[Archie groaning]

556
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:43,233
[explosions]

557
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,915
[Archie screams]

558
00:30:58,915 --> 00:31:01,126
[Isobel] It's all right.
It's all right. Shh.

559
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,377
It's just a nightmare.

560
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:04,045
Shh, shh.

561
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:05,505
It's all right.

562
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:07,966
It's all right. Shh.

563
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:14,806
Oh.

564
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,327
Come on, Lottie.
Let's get you to bed.

565
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,371
Come on. Come on.

566
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:41,541
Don't forget, your cousin, Edie,

567
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,501
is coming to take
you home tomorrow.

568
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:47,547
[dramatic music playing]

569
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,188
Come on, Edie.
You're getting so fat.

570
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,732
No wonder
that you can't keep up.

571
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:11,988
[bird caws]

572
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,092
[suspenseful music playing]

573
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:01,079
What do you keep
that rubbish for?

574
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:05,292
Edmund Aird.

575
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:09,796
I wouldn't sleep easy in my bed
if I were him.

576
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:12,757
And Pandora,

577
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,385
the wicked bitch.

578
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:17,887
What are you talking
about, Lottie?

579
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:20,015
I know what I know.

580
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:24,019
That woman's no better
than the murderers.

581
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:33,153
-Mr. Cocklin.
-[Mr. Cocklin] Hello?

582
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:36,823
We will not go into unfortunate
matter of the misprint.

583
00:33:36,823 --> 00:33:38,491
That is behind us.

584
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:39,576
But this...

585
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:41,244
[Mr. Cocklin]
What's that, madame?

586
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:45,332
You have printed the invitations
on the wrong side of the card.

587
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:49,669
Are you awake?

588
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:50,670
[Neil] No.

589
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,965
-Oh.
-You are now.

590
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,550
[Neil] I'm gonna get you
for that.

591
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:58,178
Look what I got.

592
00:33:58,178 --> 00:33:59,471
[Neil] What's that?

593
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,139
An invitation to a ball.

594
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,432
[Neil] Great.

595
00:34:02,682 --> 00:34:03,808
You gonna go?

596
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,102
Hmm, No, I don't think so.

597
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:08,980
Why not?

598
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:12,067
Because I don't want to go
without you.

599
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,865
You haven't told them
about me, have you?

600
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:21,326
-You little ratter.
-Maybe not. Maybe not.

601
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,577
They couldn't cope with it.

602
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:25,288
Well, you're not trying,
are you?

603
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:26,414
I know that.

604
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,335
What's-- what's the problem?

605
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:32,837
[sighs] It's just...

606
00:34:34,964 --> 00:34:37,133
They wouldn't approve of me,
would they?

607
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:38,927
I don't believe this.

608
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:44,057
It's... it's just there would be
a full-scale inquisition,

609
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:45,308
that's all.

610
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,852
Would you come?

611
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,732
Tribal dances
on the grass moors?

612
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,193
I'd rather shoot
myself in the foot.

613
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,238
Lovely.

614
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:00,448
Letter from Lucilla.

615
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:01,825
[Isobel] Oh, good.

616
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:03,284
I hope there would be.

617
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:05,995
And the stiff one,
hand-delivered,

618
00:35:05,995 --> 00:35:07,914
looks like a summons
for the queen.

619
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:10,125
That must be Verena's invitation

620
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,293
-to the dance.
-Then two more of the same.

621
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:16,297
One for Lucilla and another
for Pandora, to be forwarded.

622
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:18,425
I told Verena
it was not a good idea.

623
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:21,636
Open Lucilla's letter
That's much more important.

624
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:27,767
"Darling, mom and dad...

625
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:32,564
just to let you know I'm fine
and having a great time.

626
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:36,860
I'm traveling with an
Australian boy called Jeff,

627
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:40,196
a sheep farmer farming
around Europe.

628
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:45,452
Might nip down to the Riviera
to see if Pandora's still there.

629
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:48,663
I'm bit short of cash.
Any chance of a loan?"

630
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:54,210
And there's a bit about a
Matisse exhibition she went to.

631
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:57,297
Well, farming around Europe.

632
00:35:57,297 --> 00:35:59,799
-[sighs] Sheep farmer.
-Hmm.

633
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,509
Might be worst, I suppose.

634
00:36:05,138 --> 00:36:06,639
I wish she'd come home.

635
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,683
Who?

636
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:11,311
Lucilla.

637
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:15,023
Oh, yes. Of course.

638
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,194
Well, I'll get a
check off to her.

639
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:07,742
[dramatic music playing]

640
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:11,371
[Pandora] Don't you
understand, Archie?

641
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,747
I'm having a baby.

642
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:15,083
I can't believe
you won't help me.

643
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:23,716
[Archie] Did you ever think
of anyone apart from yourself?

644
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:55,582
-[Alexa] Virginia. Hi.
-Hi.

645
00:37:55,582 --> 00:37:56,791
Here.

646
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,793
[Alexa] Excellent.
Oh, let me help you.

647
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:00,670
Come in. Come in.

648
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,089
I didn't even know
you were in London.

649
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:05,508
A spur of the moment thing.
I decided to do

650
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:07,552
-a bit of shopping.
-A bit?

651
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,637
You got half of
Knightsbridge in here.

652
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:10,555
[laughs]

653
00:38:13,683 --> 00:38:16,477
Oh, wow. This is gorgeous.

654
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:17,645
Yeah.

655
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:23,651
How's Fa?

656
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:25,737
He's fine.

657
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,322
I thought you'd given up?

658
00:38:27,697 --> 00:38:31,034
Oh, I have, I have.
This is temporary.

659
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:34,787
I've been a bit frazzled lately.

660
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:37,206
You all right?

661
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,125
Yeah. Sure.

662
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,752
[phone rings]

663
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,003
Oh, sorry.

664
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,797
Hello?

665
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:46,049
Oh, hi. Um...

666
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,470
yeah, uh, look, Friday night,

667
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,680
I'm really not sure
what I'm doing at the moment.

668
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:07,320
I didn't mean to pry.

669
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:11,324
So, um, when did he move in?

670
00:39:11,324 --> 00:39:12,950
A couple of weeks ago.

671
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,118
Is it serious?

672
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,536
I hope so.

673
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,915
Well, you better tell Edmund
before somebody else does.

674
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:21,167
Men can be trouble gossips.

675
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,212
Actually, I was gonna ask.
Could you tell pa and gran?

676
00:39:24,504 --> 00:39:26,214
Would it be really
difficult for you?

677
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:28,549
No. Vi takes
everything in stride.

678
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:31,886
And as for your father,
at the moment,

679
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,596
I don't really care
what he thinks.

680
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:36,641
I knew there was
something wrong.

681
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,559
Here I've been banging on
about my love life.

682
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,436
Oh, it's all right.
We've just come across

683
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:42,563
a cold war situation
at the moment.

684
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:44,565
Oh, God. That isn't why
you're here, is it?

685
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,693
No. I'm here because
I wanted to cheer myself up

686
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:48,653
by taking it out
on his credit card.

687
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:50,154
It'll sort itself out.

688
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:53,991
Edmund's made up his mind.

689
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,910
And when pa makes up his mind,

690
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:58,746
it's like talking
to a brick wall.

691
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:01,374
He'd be more human
if just once in his life

692
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:04,502
he really screwed up
and had to admit he was wrong.

693
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,549
Let's have some of this wine,
shall we?

694
00:40:21,144 --> 00:40:23,187
Edmund, anything wrong?

695
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,313
Hmm.

696
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:27,859
Just thought I'd drop by,
have a chat.

697
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:30,319
Well, I'm sorry you didn't feel
you could accept

698
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,446
our offer of help.

699
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:35,199
Forgive me, Edmund, but your
colleagues are businessmen,

700
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,534
not a charity.

701
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,077
What's in it for them?

702
00:40:38,077 --> 00:40:41,164
You are an absonant bastard,
Archie. It isn't the Syndicate.

703
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,916
Do you think they give a damn
about what happens

704
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,668
in the village,
all they're concerned about

705
00:40:45,668 --> 00:40:47,044
is the grouse shooting.

706
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:50,089
The church rewiring was my idea.

707
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:52,341
I was thinking of you.
I talked to them into it.

708
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:56,512
Good PR I said.
And you made me look stupid.

709
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:01,142
-Well, I'm very sorry.
-Well, you should be.

710
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:03,686
You are hardly in a position
to be so choosy

711
00:41:03,686 --> 00:41:05,062
over the offer of a gift.

712
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,190
Well, now,
that's an interesting thought,

713
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,649
the role of gifts.

714
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:11,444
A Trojan horse can come
in many shapes.

715
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:13,988
You were always
a stubborn bastard, Archie.

716
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,531
I didn't think you were a fool.

717
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:18,242
I'll be on my way.

718
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,418
Edmund, I'm sorry,
I'm being unfair.

719
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,504
If the offer still stands...

720
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:32,340
[sighs]

721
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:34,592
It does.

722
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:39,055
Oh, and...
I meant to give you this.

723
00:41:39,722 --> 00:41:41,265
Take a look at it.

724
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,767
I value your opinion.

725
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,561
Heart of a plantation.

726
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:47,772
Well, now, one of those
get-rich-quick schemes

727
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,440
for absentee landlords, is it?

728
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,442
There you go again,
jumping into conclusions.

729
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,445
The tax loophole
was closed years ago.

730
00:41:54,987 --> 00:41:56,823
This could be
real local benefit.

731
00:41:57,323 --> 00:41:58,866
Will you at least read it?

732
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,827
Oh, I'll read it.

733
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,542
Good heavens.
What was Edmund doing here?

734
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:10,128
-And what's that?
-Looks harmless, doesn't it?

735
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,879
But I think it's a Trojan horse.

736
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:23,432
[Alexa] Oh, right. That's the
new Recluso film, isn't it?

737
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:24,517
Did you like it?

738
00:42:24,517 --> 00:42:27,103
Neil. I didn't hear you.

739
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,772
Virginia, Neil Keeling.

740
00:42:29,772 --> 00:42:31,107
So this is Neil.

741
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:33,025
-Hello, Virginia.
-Hello.

742
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:34,360
My stepmother.

743
00:42:51,752 --> 00:42:53,629
You're welcome
to the dance though.

744
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:55,882
No, 'cause I'm gonna
hate it out there.

745
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:57,425
'Cause of all those
wide open spaces,

746
00:42:57,425 --> 00:43:00,303
and the gale-force winds,
and men in skirts.

747
00:43:00,303 --> 00:43:01,888
You know, I can't cope
with that.

748
00:43:01,888 --> 00:43:03,598
Long prayers and lots of Scots.

749
00:43:03,598 --> 00:43:05,641
The sun has been known
to shine, hasn't it?

750
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:07,476
Barkley Square please.

751
00:43:07,476 --> 00:43:09,228
I'm gonna get my hair done.

752
00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:11,397
-Bye, sweetie.
-Take care. Pamper yourself.

753
00:43:11,397 --> 00:43:13,774
-Thanks.
-You will come though?

754
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:16,527
Only if you save me a tango.

755
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,446
-Uh... I promise.
-You heard her.

756
00:43:18,446 --> 00:43:20,072
She promised.
You heard that, didn't you?

757
00:43:26,454 --> 00:43:27,997
-Evening, Mrs. Ishak.
-Hello.

758
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:30,750
Listen, I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I need a bunch of flowers.

759
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,877
You know, the sort of thing
my wife likes.

760
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:33,961
Of course.

761
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:37,131
-[Lottie] Mr. Aird.
-Hmm.

762
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:39,133
I've seen you
around the village,

763
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,551
but you're always
in such a hurry.

764
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,553
Never had a chance
to have a chin-wag.

765
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:44,180
Yes.

766
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,141
Remember me?
Lottie Carstairs.

767
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,853
I used to work for old
Lady Balmerino for a while.

768
00:43:50,853 --> 00:43:53,105
Yes. Uh, yes, of course,
I remember you.

769
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:56,651
I was there when Lord Balmerino
was getting married.

770
00:43:56,651 --> 00:43:59,487
Well, that, uh--
that was all a long time ago.

771
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:02,073
What times they were, eh?

772
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:04,075
You're still married
to Caroline,

773
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,827
and Pandora buzzing about
like a bee after honey,

774
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:08,496
and then running off.

775
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:12,083
But then she was always
a bit of a bad penny.

776
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:14,126
You and I know that.

777
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:18,297
Don't worry, Mr. Aird,
you more than anyone--

778
00:44:18,297 --> 00:44:21,300
Sorry, Mr. Aird,
I couldn't find any paper.

779
00:44:22,218 --> 00:44:23,219
[bell chimes]

780
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,014
Oh. That's all right.

781
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:28,432
Just put it on the account,
will you?

782
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:30,017
I think...

783
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,229
Oh, it's a wee bit
chilly tonight, Henry.

784
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:35,731
Would you put a match
to the fire.

785
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:48,953
[suspenseful music playing]

786
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,331
Henry? What is it?

787
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,750
Do you think Edie
is going to be all right?

788
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:57,670
I don't think Edie
is in actual danger.

789
00:45:09,598 --> 00:45:10,725
[sighs]

790
00:45:11,017 --> 00:45:12,309
Lottie.

791
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,646
Lottie.

792
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:24,363
[suspenseful music playing]

793
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,621
-[glass breaks]
-[screams]

794
00:45:37,793 --> 00:45:41,005
Just slipped out of my fingers.

795
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,050
I'll be at boarding school
on my birthday.

796
00:45:45,468 --> 00:45:47,720
Won't be the same without you.

797
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,971
[sighs]

798
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:50,848
I don't want to go.

799
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,976
Mommy doesn't want me
to go either.

800
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,312
She'll miss you.

801
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,898
They both will.

802
00:45:59,565 --> 00:46:01,108
They've been quarreling.

803
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:03,027
I know.

804
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,904
How do you know?

805
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,492
I may be old, darling,
but I'm not stupid.

806
00:46:10,117 --> 00:46:12,244
And your father is my son.

807
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:15,873
And I'd like to shake
him sometimes.

808
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,628
[airplane engine rumbles]

809
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:22,046
[tires screeches]

810
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:27,676
Did you get a dress
for the dance?

811
00:46:28,427 --> 00:46:29,595
Yeah.

812
00:46:29,845 --> 00:46:31,806
And I got my hair done.

813
00:46:31,806 --> 00:46:33,432
Yeah, I noticed.

814
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:35,226
I like it.

815
00:46:36,685 --> 00:46:37,853
Did you see Alexa?

816
00:46:38,813 --> 00:46:40,022
Yes.

817
00:46:40,773 --> 00:46:43,442
Promise you won't go
all Victorian on me.

818
00:46:43,776 --> 00:46:45,653
I have some news for you.

819
00:46:45,945 --> 00:46:48,489
She met a guy
and she's crazy about him.

820
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,200
She wasn't sure
how you were gonna take it,

821
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,327
so she gave me the job
of telling you.

822
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:56,622
He's some sort of
financial whiz kid.

823
00:46:56,622 --> 00:46:58,541
Venture capitalist,
I think what she said.

824
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,126
Ha. Definitely a charmer.

825
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:01,836
[Edmund] Oh, you mean
a ladies' man?

826
00:47:02,378 --> 00:47:04,421
[Virginia] I guess you
could put it that way.

827
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,840
[Edmund] Alexa's innocent.

828
00:47:06,132 --> 00:47:09,343
Now, she's met up
with some city slicker.

829
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:12,513
-I don't want her to get hurt
-Nor do I.

830
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,558
But don't you think she's old
enough to take her own risks.

831
00:47:15,558 --> 00:47:18,018
Well, she's hardly
in the position to judge.

832
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:21,272
Prince Charming can come in
pretty funny packaging.

833
00:47:21,522 --> 00:47:23,816
I mean, my parents weren't
exactly over the moon

834
00:47:23,816 --> 00:47:26,527
about some Brit with a kid
on his hands.

835
00:47:26,527 --> 00:47:28,612
I'm much too old for you, huh?

836
00:47:31,157 --> 00:47:32,825
[sighs]

837
00:47:32,825 --> 00:47:34,493
You took on a lot.

838
00:47:36,328 --> 00:47:37,830
I loved you.

839
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:39,999
That was the miracle.

840
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:43,127
Thank you.

841
00:47:46,338 --> 00:47:47,631
Edmund...

842
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,592
I know this is tough on you,

843
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:51,886
but you have to let go.

844
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:55,014
All I want is to do
the right thing.

845
00:47:55,014 --> 00:47:56,015
Edmund...

846
00:47:56,265 --> 00:47:57,975
I have something to say.

847
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:02,313
I think that you're making
a big mistake about Henry.

848
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:04,857
He's far too young
to be sent away.

849
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:06,650
But I don't want...

850
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,569
[dramatic music playing]

851
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:12,072
[sighs]
...this to go on between us.

852
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:15,159
I've missed you...

853
00:48:17,286 --> 00:48:19,121
and I do love you.

854
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:22,166
[exhales]

855
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:25,252
I shouldn't have settled
the matter without...

856
00:48:25,252 --> 00:48:27,671
-consulting you.
-No.

857
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,090
You shouldn't have.

858
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,052
[dramatic music playing]

859
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:35,387
Truce?

860
00:48:35,387 --> 00:48:37,181
On one condition,

861
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:39,350
the day that Henry
has to go to Temple Hall,

862
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,559
you take him.

863
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,187
I can't face him.

864
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:45,856
I'll take him.

865
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,192
I promise.

866
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,779
[dramatic music playing]

867
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:53,072
Here.

868
00:48:53,072 --> 00:48:54,240
Thank you.

869
00:48:54,907 --> 00:48:56,033
Oh...

870
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,745
coming home present.

871
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,751
Oh.

872
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,544
Put them on for me.

to your left, Gary.

[Archie] Edmund.

882
00:50:47,102 --> 00:50:48,312
[Edmund] Oh, hello, Archie.

883
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:49,855
Have you had the chance
to read my--

884
00:50:49,855 --> 00:50:51,940
No. I've not read
your presentation.

885
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,442
I see little point in doing so.

886
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:56,195
What was all that guff
about valuing my opinion,

887
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:58,447
since you've obviously
gone ahead with your dreadful

888
00:50:58,447 --> 00:51:00,991
carnival scheme
without my valued opinion.

889
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,659
[Edmund] Well,
if that's way you feel--

890
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,703
Well, at least,
I know where we stand.

891

[tires screeches]

893
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:13,087
Mommy, you're back.

894
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,798
Hello. Hmm.

895
00:51:16,715 --> 00:51:19,134
Hmm. How are you?

896
00:51:19,134 --> 00:51:21,136
-I'm all right.
-Hmm. I've missed you.

897
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,555
[chuckles]

898
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:30,270
Keep it. Cheers.

00:51:50,332 --> 00:51:53,335
[laughter]

901
00:51:53,794 --> 00:51:55,462
Alexa, I'm so sorry, darling.

902
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:57,297
-I'm late--
-[Jasmine] Neil? It's fine.

903
00:51:57,297 --> 00:51:59,174
-Jasmine?
-Oh, what a surprise?

904
00:52:00,342 --> 00:52:02,761
Haven't seen you
since you went off to New York.

905
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:04,513
[Neil] Well, no.
I've been, uh...

906
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:05,389
busy.

907
00:52:06,432 --> 00:52:09,309
Hey, whoa. Hey,
these catalog numbers or prices?

908
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:11,645
And since when have you
been interested in art?

909
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:14,940
Hmm, I'm not really.
Alexa is the patron here.

910
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,191
[Alexa] Hi.

911
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:17,943
Right. That explains it.

912
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:23,115
All right. When you see
anything you like,

913
00:52:23,115 --> 00:52:25,826
-just give me a wave.
-[Alexa] This one is beautiful.

914
00:52:25,826 --> 00:52:26,869
Really exquisite.

915
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:29,955
Oh. I've got the man
who painted it over here.

916
00:52:30,372 --> 00:52:31,331
Follow me.

917
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:33,417
Barry?

918
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,171
Alexa, meet Barry Miller.

919
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:38,839
-Hi. Alexa Aird.
-[Barry] Hi. How are you?

920
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:40,758
-I'm a big fan of your work.
-Oh.

921
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,384
I'll show you a piece
you might like.

922
00:52:42,384 --> 00:52:43,969
-Over here.
-Jasmine?

923
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:46,263
-Yes?
-Can you keep a secret?

924
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:47,139
I don't know.

925
00:52:47,848 --> 00:52:49,391
What have you got in mind?

926
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,310
[indistinct chatter]

00:53:05,491 --> 00:53:07,701
-Oh, I think that's Archie.
-Oh, it is.

930
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:08,785
Hello, Archie.

931
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:15,542
Lord Balmerino,
I was looking for you.

932
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:17,377
You'll have
to excuse me, Lottie.

933
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:18,837
I'm rather busy.

934
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:25,886
[car engine starts]

935
00:53:28,055 --> 00:53:30,307
I'd have looked after the baby.

936
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:32,518
I wanted to.

937
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,103
They wouldn't listen.

938
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,563
Lottie?

939
00:53:36,563 --> 00:53:38,690
I think it's time
we went home, Lottie.

940
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:42,110
No. I wanna talk...

941
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:45,113
-to Lord Balmerino.
-Lottie, dear,

942
00:53:45,113 --> 00:53:48,200
I really think that you should
go home with Edie now.

943
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,120
But why do you come and have
a cup of tea with me one day.

944
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:54,373
Can we go to Edenborough?

945
00:53:54,373 --> 00:53:56,208
I could do with a bit of life.

946
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:57,876
Go shopping.

947
00:53:57,876 --> 00:53:59,127
Very well.

948
00:53:59,127 --> 00:54:00,963
We'll arrange an outing.

949
00:54:00,963 --> 00:54:03,549
-Don't forget.
-No, I won't forget.

950
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:06,218
-Of course, I won't forget.
-[Lottie giggles]

951
00:54:06,718 --> 00:54:09,721
[suspenseful music playing]

952
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:19,022
[Archie] Oh, Pandora,
don't be such a fool.

953
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:22,276
He doesn't love you.

954
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:25,946
And the last thing
he wants is your baby.

955
00:54:25,946 --> 00:54:27,906
[Lottie] Mr. Archie...

956
00:54:27,906 --> 00:54:29,741
I know what to do.

957
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:31,660
I can help.

958
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,120
[Pandora] I hate you, Archie.

959
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:38,041
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you, Archie.

960
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:40,085
Argh.

961
00:54:42,504 --> 00:54:43,755
-Isobel.
-Come in.

962
00:54:43,755 --> 00:54:47,509
My dear, I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

963
00:54:47,926 --> 00:54:51,471
I know why Napoleon lost
the Battle of Waterloo.

964
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:54,266
You simply cannot rely
on anyone.

965
00:54:54,266 --> 00:54:56,018
Has Lucilla replied yet?

966
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:57,477
She has not.

967
00:54:57,477 --> 00:54:59,730
Nor Pandora, I might add.

968
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,316
You can't rely on Pandora
to reply to anything.

969
00:55:02,316 --> 00:55:05,068
But I did have a favor
to ask you.

970
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:07,279
Could you be a darling
and have a stray man

971
00:55:07,279 --> 00:55:08,655
to stay for the party.

972
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:09,990
-Of course.
-Oh.

973
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,075
-Who is it?
-Oh, some American.

974
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,453
Katy met him at a dinner
in London.

975
00:55:14,453 --> 00:55:16,788
His wife just died,
and he's over here

976
00:55:16,788 --> 00:55:19,291
for a bit of a holiday.
Poor man.

977
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:21,001
She thought it would
cheer him up,

978
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,669
but I'm full to the rafters.

979
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:24,755
-Oh, of course, we will.
-Oh, you're an angel.

980
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,424
-What's his name?
-Yes.

981
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,134
What is his name?

982
00:55:30,052 --> 00:55:32,763
Plucka-- no. Tucker. That's it.

983
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,306
Conrad Tucker.

984
00:55:34,306 --> 00:55:35,766
He's sounds rather sad.

985
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,225
Anyway, I must fly.

986
00:55:38,477 --> 00:55:39,353
No tea?

987
00:55:39,728 --> 00:55:41,855
My dear, I have to put
the band and the pipers,

988
00:55:41,855 --> 00:55:44,483
and something called
a portable disco.

989
00:55:44,483 --> 00:55:47,527
I suppose it'll be some ghastly
young skinhead with spots.

990
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:48,820
[Isobel] Oh.

991
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,325
I was 15...

992
00:55:53,325 --> 00:55:55,661
when my mother put me
into service.

993
00:55:55,994 --> 00:55:58,413
A half day off a week we had.

994
00:55:59,247 --> 00:56:00,791
No way...

995
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,376
you could meet a young man.

996
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:05,379
Go to the cinema
or a dance hall.

997
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:08,840
I'd have liked to have joined
the police force.

998
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:10,258
Had some fun.

999
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,178
But I didn't know
how to go about it.

1000
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,307
Lottie, I think you said you
needed to do some shopping.

1001
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,810
I need a yard
of boiling knicker elastic.

1002
00:56:20,102 --> 00:56:21,978
The haberdashery will have it.

1003
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,147
Well, I really don't know
if they sell...

1004
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,607
Oh, dear.

1005
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,656
[phone ringing]

1006
00:56:35,867 --> 00:56:36,827
Croy.

1007
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,246
-Surprise.
-Who is that?

1008
00:56:39,246 --> 00:56:40,372
Dad it's me.

1009
00:56:40,956 --> 00:56:42,541
Lucilla.

1010
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:44,751
-Where are you?
-I'm in London.

1011
00:56:44,751 --> 00:56:46,837
I'm at the Dorchester
of all places.

1012
00:56:47,421 --> 00:56:49,464
We'll be with you
tomorrow evening, all of us.

1013
00:56:49,464 --> 00:56:52,634
-Come on.
-Get off me, you pig.

1014
00:56:53,427 --> 00:56:55,887
Hello?
No, no, no. Not you.

1015
00:56:55,887 --> 00:56:57,180
Dad, that was Jeff.

1016
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,473
You remember, I wrote about him.

1017
00:56:58,473 --> 00:57:00,308
Is there any chance of getting
to Scotland this year?

1018
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:01,852
Shh. Yes. Ugh.

1019
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:03,353
Look, Dad, I've got to go.

1020
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:04,646
Okay. Yes.

1021
00:57:04,646 --> 00:57:06,982
Hey, we've got a real surprise
for you.

1022
00:57:06,982 --> 00:57:08,650
We'll be coming up with Pandora.

1023
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,069
So Lucilla thought
she'd see if Pandora

1024
00:57:11,069 --> 00:57:12,654
was still at the same address.

1025
00:57:12,654 --> 00:57:13,947
And that was it. She was.

1026
00:57:13,947 --> 00:57:15,574
And she invited them to stay.

1027
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:18,368
Then announced that she
would come to the dance,

1028
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:19,786
if they drove back with her.

1029
00:57:20,662 --> 00:57:22,164
Why didn't she let us know?

1030
00:57:22,164 --> 00:57:23,248
The Dorchester?

1031
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:25,333
Lucilla's never stayed
in a proper hotel in her life.

1032
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:27,711
Couldn't she have chosen
something a little less grand?

1033
00:57:28,086 --> 00:57:29,880
[Archie] Well, I don't suppose
Pandora knows

1034
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,256
anywhere less grand.

1035
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:34,468
Well, sure beats a sleeping bag.

1036
00:57:34,468 --> 00:57:36,553
Jeff, are you really sure
we've got everything...

1037
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:37,971
-Here you go.
-...this time?

1038
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:39,556
Straight in there.
Thanks a lot.

1039
00:57:41,516 --> 00:57:42,601
Do you want a hand?

1040
00:57:42,601 --> 00:57:44,561
-[man] There you are, sir.
-Yup. There you go.

1041
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:45,562
Thanks very much. Okay.

1042
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:47,397
[door creaks open]

1043
00:57:56,364 --> 00:57:59,409
[dramatic music playing]

1044
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,627
[Pandora] Dearest Archie,

1045
00:58:08,627 --> 00:58:11,755
I can't bear to think
of that last time I saw you.

1046
00:58:12,464 --> 00:58:14,966
All those dreadful things
we both said.

1047
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:18,345
That's what you call it,
a problem?

1048
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,265
Don't you understand, Archie?
I am having a baby.

1049
00:58:23,058 --> 00:58:24,893
I can't believe
you won't help me.

1050
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:28,522
[Archie]
Did you ever think of anyone,

1051
00:58:28,522 --> 00:58:30,315
apart from yourself?

1052
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:35,487
[Pandora] Yes.
I'm thinking of Edmund.

1053
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:37,364
I can make him happy.

1054
00:58:37,364 --> 00:58:39,157
And you can't stop me.

1055
00:58:39,157 --> 00:58:42,160
[dramatic music playing]

1056
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:45,956
[Pandora] I just wanted
to let you know,

1057
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:48,166
the little problem...

1058
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:50,043
no longer exists.

1059
00:58:50,418 --> 00:58:52,921
So you can all
breathe again.

1060
00:58:52,921 --> 00:58:56,925
The family name is untainted,
and I'm perfectly all right.

1061
00:58:57,342 --> 00:58:59,135
Don't worry, darling.

1062
00:59:03,348 --> 00:59:06,351
[phone ringing]

1063
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:14,276
-Hello?
-[Isobel] Hello, Vi.

1064
00:59:14,276 --> 00:59:15,902
Oh, Isobel.

1065
00:59:15,902 --> 00:59:18,071
[Isobel] I think you better
be sitting down for this.

1066
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,115
I am sitting down.

1067
00:59:20,115 --> 00:59:23,493
Just had the most exhausting day
blabbering with Lottie.

1068
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:26,371
[Isobel] Pandora's coming home
for the dance.

1069
00:59:26,371 --> 00:59:27,497
What?

1070
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,207
It's true.

1071
00:59:29,207 --> 00:59:31,459
Archie said
she'd never come back.

1072
00:59:31,459 --> 00:59:32,419
Well, she is.

1073
00:59:33,795 --> 00:59:36,006
[sighs]
How extraordinary.

1074
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:39,009
What made her decide
to come now?

1075
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:40,552
Oh, Vi...

1076
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:42,721
I do hope there's not
gonna be trouble.

1077
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,063
[car engine rumbles]

1078
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,693
[car horn honks]

1079
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,332
[Archie] Edmund...

1080
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,168
Isobel is giving a lunch party
on Sunday.

1081
01:00:13,168 --> 01:00:15,545
She very much hopes you both
would like to come.

1082
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,380
Henry too of course.

1083
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,216
Forgive me if this
sounds rude, Archie.

1084
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,136
But, uh, we all know
where we stand.

1085
01:00:23,136 --> 01:00:25,680
You think I'm a shit?
I think you're a fool.

1086
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:28,934
This is not a good basis
for a lunch party.

1087
01:00:28,934 --> 01:00:30,936
[Archie] Oh, I thought you
might have heard this,

1088
01:00:30,936 --> 01:00:32,479
to be a guest of honor...

1089
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:34,981
Pandora.

1090
01:00:35,857 --> 01:00:37,025
Here?

1091
01:00:41,988 --> 01:00:42,989
[car door slams]

1092
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:44,157
Why?

1093
01:00:44,491 --> 01:00:46,743
Verena invited her to the dance.

1094
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:47,619
She's accepted.

1095
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:49,704
[sighs]

1096
01:00:49,704 --> 01:00:51,998
And we're all gonna
have lunch together?

1097
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:55,085
Well, this is grotesque.

1098
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:57,003
Well, you have to meet sometime.

1099
01:00:58,213 --> 01:00:59,464
Do we?

1100
01:01:01,675 --> 01:01:04,678
[dramatic music playing]

1101
01:01:10,225 --> 01:01:11,351
[Henry chuckles]

1102
01:01:11,351 --> 01:01:13,645
[Virginia] Give it more
of a spiral this time.

1103
01:01:14,312 --> 01:01:16,773
-Yeah, that's good.
-[Henry] Come on. Pass. Pass.

1104
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,275
[Henry] Okay. [chuckles]

1105
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,028
-Hi.
-[Edmund] Hi.

1106
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:25,407
Mm. I missed you today.

1107
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:27,659
-Hiya.
-You too.

1108
01:01:28,493 --> 01:01:29,703
Missed you.

1109
01:01:29,703 --> 01:01:31,329
-Wanna have a cup of tea?
-[Edmund] Sure.

1110
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:32,831
That's not American
football, is it?

1111
01:01:32,831 --> 01:01:33,915
-[Henry] Yes, it is.
-Yeah.

1112
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:36,501
Whatever happened
to good old rugby?

1113
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,086
[Henry] It's much better.

1114
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,005
[Edmund] Come on. Here.

1115
01:01:40,005 --> 01:01:41,840
Here. Come on. Catch.

1116
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,383
[Henry] Hey, come here.
Come here.

1117
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:47,470
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

1118
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,639
We have an invitation
for Sunday.

1119
01:01:50,348 --> 01:01:51,891
Family lunch at Croy.

1120
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:53,852
I thought you and Archie
we're having a row.

1121
01:01:53,852 --> 01:01:56,604
Yes. It's a bit bizarre
but there it is.

1122
01:01:57,355 --> 01:01:58,523
The thing is...

1123
01:01:58,523 --> 01:02:00,358
Archie's sister has come home.

1124
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:02,610
Oh, that's fantastic.
I'm dying to meet her.

1125
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:04,487
Look, um...

1126
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,990
Look, I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but...

1127
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,993
Pandora may not be, uh...

1128
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:12,454
entirely friendly.

1129
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,916
It's all in the past now,
but, uh, there were...

1130
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,003
-What family feuds?
-[sighs]

1131
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:22,589
Well, some people
harbor grudges, and...

1132
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:25,300
I don't want you to get upset.

1133
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:27,594
Don't worry about me.

1134
01:02:27,594 --> 01:02:29,929
After all, I'm an outsider,
aren't I?

1135
01:02:29,929 --> 01:02:31,973
Oh, it'll be great to meet her.

1136
01:02:31,973 --> 01:02:35,685
[dramatic music playing]

1137
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:38,688
[birds chirping]

1138
01:02:44,986 --> 01:02:48,031
[car horn honking]

1139
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:51,076
[dramatic music playing]

1140
01:02:58,416 --> 01:03:01,419
[birds chirping]

1141
01:03:15,183 --> 01:03:16,351
Pandora?

1142
01:03:20,271 --> 01:03:22,107
Where are the horses?

1143
01:03:26,444 --> 01:03:28,196
Where are the horses?

1144
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:31,699
We sold them...

1145
01:03:32,033 --> 01:03:33,034
ages ago.

1146
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:35,703
[sighs]

1147
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:41,084
Stables are empty.

1148
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,295
The parkland is all plowed over.

1149
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,339
It's just fields.

1150
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:50,009
Local farmers rents.
And I wrote about that.

1151
01:03:50,009 --> 01:03:51,094
[sighs]

1152
01:03:54,848 --> 01:03:56,224
Hello, Pandora.

1153
01:03:56,224 --> 01:03:59,394
[dramatic music playing]

1154
01:04:03,398 --> 01:04:04,983
Sold the horses.

1155
01:04:07,026 --> 01:04:08,570
Why are you wearing a fur coat?

1156
01:04:09,904 --> 01:04:11,906
I'm mink, you mean, why not?

1157
01:04:12,157 --> 01:04:13,366
It's September.

1158
01:04:15,702 --> 01:04:17,996
Oh, I can't stand the cold.

1159
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,124
This is a savage country,

1160
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:22,459
ghastly climate.

1161
01:04:27,172 --> 01:04:30,216
[dramatic music playing]

1162
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:32,260
Welcome home.

1163
01:04:34,721 --> 01:04:35,805
Archie.

1164
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:38,433
[dramatic music playing]

1165
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:40,059
Archie.

1166
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:42,395
Oh.
[chuckles]

1167
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:44,564
I'm so happy to see you.

1168
01:04:44,564 --> 01:04:47,317
And to be back is so wonderful.

1169
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:52,155
-I can't believe...
-Wonderful.

1170
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:54,157
[Archie] Ah, there they are.

1171
01:04:54,449 --> 01:04:57,577
Oh, Pandora, it's wonderful
to have you back.

1172
01:04:57,577 --> 01:04:59,287
[Archie] Hmm, darling.

1173
01:04:59,287 --> 01:05:00,371
And you must be Jeff.

1174
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:02,498
-Good day. Good to meet you.
-Hello. Welcome to Croy.

1175
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:03,958
Thank you very much.

1176
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:05,710
Archie, they've been
absolutely angelic,

1177
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,128
did particularly
all the driving.

1178
01:05:07,128 --> 01:05:09,505
Oh, we have to.
We wanted to get here.

1179
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,633
He always drives like a maniac.

1180
01:05:11,633 --> 01:05:14,469
These children have no respect
for their betters.

1181
01:05:14,802 --> 01:05:16,846
I don't want any more
bad news today.

1182
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,890
-Sold the horses.
-Come along.

1183
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:20,391
I'll show you all
to your rooms.

1184
01:05:20,391 --> 01:05:22,227
Yes. Come on.
Let's go and have a drink.

1185
01:05:22,227 --> 01:05:23,478
Yeah. Great.
I'd love one.

1186
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:26,397
[indistinct chatter]

1187
01:05:26,397 --> 01:05:29,901
[dramatic music playing]

1188
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:31,611
Isobel, wait for me.

1189
01:05:32,612 --> 01:05:34,489
-Should I take your coat?
-Yes.

1190
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,033
Oh, God.

1191
01:05:38,117 --> 01:05:40,161
[sighs]

1192
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,748
[dramatic music playing]

1193
01:05:49,087 --> 01:05:50,838
I've missed this so much.

1194
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:52,549
The Americans have all gone,

1195
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,384
so I have given you
the panic room.

1196
01:05:56,302 --> 01:05:57,887
Isobel, could I see my old room?

1197
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:00,139
Oh, yes, of course.
I don't think--

1198
01:06:01,015 --> 01:06:02,642
It's been years
since we've used it.

1199
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,989
Can I sleep here?

1200
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:18,283
But it hasn't been
redecorated or anything.

1201
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,704
It's so tattered
and the bed needs airing.

1202
01:06:23,788 --> 01:06:25,415
Where are my things, Isobel?

1203
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:26,541
My records?

1204
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:29,127
Oh, it's all safe,
boxed away in the attic.

1205
01:06:29,127 --> 01:06:30,837
[dramatic music playing]

1206
01:06:37,677 --> 01:06:39,846
[Pandora] I've dreamt
of this for years.

1207
01:06:42,515 --> 01:06:45,268
That gray and purple and green.

1208
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,854
I've laid the table
in the dining room.

1209
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:50,398
All the best China, crystal.

1210
01:06:50,398 --> 01:06:53,067
I thought we'd have a really
grand family dinner.

1211
01:06:53,067 --> 01:06:54,485
Isobel...

1212
01:06:54,485 --> 01:06:57,280
what I'd love is--
is supper in the kitchen,

1213
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,948
like we used to.

1214
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:02,160
Oh. Yes, of course,
if that's what you really want.

1215
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:04,370
I tried to teach the locals
the Highland fling.

1216
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:06,497
They always stated I looked like
the Pasodoble.

1217
01:07:06,497 --> 01:07:09,000
-[laughter]
-It was hopeless.

1218
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,128
Hey, what about those three
buskers in Santa Fe?

1219
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:15,048
Oh, darling.
They were so lonely.

1220
01:07:15,048 --> 01:07:17,342
No one paid any attention.

1221
01:07:17,675 --> 01:07:19,761
So Pandora invites them
to join us.

1222
01:07:19,761 --> 01:07:22,055
-Well, they were too charming.
-[Lucilla] You liked them.

1223
01:07:22,055 --> 01:07:24,015
-I thought they were great.
-Were they great.

1224
01:07:24,015 --> 01:07:25,933
-They really were great.
-[indistinct chatter]

1225
01:07:25,933 --> 01:07:28,853

1228
01:07:36,027 --> 01:07:39,113
[laughter]

1229
01:07:39,781 --> 01:07:41,324

[indistinct chatter]

1233
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,634
[Isobel] Why don't take
your glass to--

1234
01:07:59,634 --> 01:08:01,052
Done.

1235
01:08:03,304 --> 01:08:06,099
So, I can't wait.
Tell me everything.

1236
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:08,976
[sighs]

1237
01:08:08,976 --> 01:08:11,521
You know the Airds are coming
to lunch on Sunday.

1238
01:08:13,606 --> 01:08:14,607
Is that all right?

1239
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,984
Perfectly all right.

1240
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,534
What's Edmund's new wife like?

1241
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,495
[sighs]
Not exactly...

1242
01:08:27,495 --> 01:08:29,831
you. It's been 10 years.

1243
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:30,832
She's warm...

1244
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:32,792
generous.

1245
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:35,420
She's been wonderful to Alexa.

1246
01:08:41,968 --> 01:08:44,387
Warm, generous?

1247
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:45,847
She sounds blissful.

1248
01:08:45,847 --> 01:08:48,266
Well, you'll meet them all
at the dance anyway.

1249
01:08:51,269 --> 01:08:52,895
Have you bought
a new dress yet?

1250
01:08:53,688 --> 01:08:55,731
Oh, no. I can't afford it.

1251
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:58,568
But, darling,
you have to have a new dress.

1252
01:08:58,568 --> 01:08:59,944
Don't be so silly.

1253
01:09:02,655 --> 01:09:03,990
Are things that bad?

1254
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:06,701
Yes, actually.

1255
01:09:08,494 --> 01:09:11,747
[dramatic music playing]

1256
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:22,175
What is it, Isobel?

1257
01:09:25,052 --> 01:09:26,512
It's everything.

1258
01:09:28,306 --> 01:09:30,433
It's Archie losing his leg.

1259
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:34,479
It's having to be nice to people
because they're paying

1260
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:36,522
to sleep in your spare bedrooms.

1261
01:09:38,357 --> 01:09:40,985
Archie finds life difficult.

1262
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:47,575
He seems to think
he's let us down.

1263
01:09:47,575 --> 01:09:49,535
He's lost his zest for living.

1264
01:09:50,828 --> 01:09:52,997
I sometimes think
he wishes he hadn't survived

1265
01:09:52,997 --> 01:09:54,707
the Falklands War.

1266
01:09:58,669 --> 01:10:00,463
Is there anything wrong
between the two of you?

1267
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:03,925
No.

1268
01:10:06,928 --> 01:10:09,138
He always waits until he's sure
that I've gone to sleep

1269
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:10,765
before he comes to bed.

1270
01:10:11,349 --> 01:10:13,142
[Pandora] And are you always?

1271
01:10:13,768 --> 01:10:16,896
No, but I pretend to be.
It's easier that way.

1272
01:10:18,689 --> 01:10:20,107
No demands.

1273
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:22,151
Hmm. No sex you mean?

1274
01:10:23,945 --> 01:10:25,196
[sighs]

1275
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,369
He's locked away
inside himself.

1276
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:34,747
And when he finally
does get to sleep...

1277
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,835
he has nightmares.

1278
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:44,715
-[Pandora] Come now.
-[crying]

1279
01:10:49,637 --> 01:10:53,349
[dramatic music playing]

1280
01:11:02,233 --> 01:11:03,651
[Pandora] You all right?

1281
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:05,528
Thank you.

1282
01:11:23,963 --> 01:11:26,966
[wind blowing]

1283
01:11:32,346 --> 01:11:33,848
I hear you're sleeping badly.

1284
01:11:36,142 --> 01:11:38,311
You must be worn out
with all that driving.

1285
01:11:39,645 --> 01:11:40,855
No.

1286
01:11:42,982 --> 01:11:44,317
Archie...

1287
01:11:45,276 --> 01:11:46,569
sometimes...

1288
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:51,407
you have to allow people
to know things.

1289
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,785
You have to let them
into your life.

1290
01:11:56,537 --> 01:11:57,913
Why?

1291
01:11:57,913 --> 01:11:59,999
To give them the chance
to help you.

1292
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:06,589
No one can help.

1293
01:12:08,299 --> 01:12:10,593
So it's best to put up
the shutters and say nothing.

1294
01:12:11,177 --> 01:12:12,637
I think so.

1295
01:12:13,137 --> 01:12:16,015
[wind blowing]

1296
01:12:16,015 --> 01:12:18,309
Hmm, what a wonderful smell.

1297
01:12:18,684 --> 01:12:20,936
Yes. Tobacco plants from seeds.

1298
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,605
It's Isobel's latest triumph.

1299
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:23,856
Hmm.

1300
01:12:28,027 --> 01:12:29,153
Hmm.

1301
01:12:32,865 --> 01:12:35,826
Did you ever receive
the letter I send you after I...

1302
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:38,954
ran off like a mad thing?

1303
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:39,872
Yes.

1304
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:42,500
You never replied.

1305
01:12:44,043 --> 01:12:46,003
I stationed in Germany,
if you remember.

1306
01:12:46,003 --> 01:12:48,089
By the time it reached me,
you were in America.

1307
01:12:48,089 --> 01:12:49,715
It was too late.

1308
01:12:53,386 --> 01:12:54,929
You shouldn't
have done it, Pan.

1309
01:12:57,515 --> 01:12:59,850
You're not gonna take
the high moral tone with me now,

1310
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,268
are you, Archie?

1311
01:13:05,856 --> 01:13:07,400
Would you walk me back
to the house?

1312
01:13:09,777 --> 01:13:12,905
[dramatic music playing]

1313
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:15,741
Now then,
this lunch on Sunday--

1314
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:18,369
Ooh. I think it's gonna be
fascinating...

1315
01:13:18,369 --> 01:13:20,496
in a ghastly kind of way.

1316
01:13:21,956 --> 01:13:24,333
I haven't made up my mind.

1317
01:13:26,252 --> 01:13:28,421
Shall I behave well...

1318
01:13:29,046 --> 01:13:31,257
or shall I be naughty...

1319
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:32,925
hmm?

[dramatic music playing]

1326
01:14:30,816 --> 01:14:32,109
Hi.

1327
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:34,528
Lucilla, where did you
spring from?

1328
01:14:34,528 --> 01:14:36,989
Jeff and I just went down
to the gate to walk off

1329
01:14:36,989 --> 01:14:38,282
that fantastic dinner.

1330
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,535
Pandora went to bed.
She looked exhausted.

1331
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,038
Oh, she'll be fine
in the morning.

1332
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,666
Awfully thin, ain't she?

1333
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:50,753
Well, she's so hyper, dad.
She burns everything up.

1334
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:54,006
Champagne, zapping around
the mountain bends,

1335
01:14:54,006 --> 01:14:56,258
and suddenly she crashed out
in the back of the car

1336
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:58,177
wrapped up in that mink.

1337
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:02,181
I know, Dad. I know
I'm not allowed to say so,

1338
01:15:03,015 --> 01:15:04,642
but this is really great.

1339
01:15:05,142 --> 01:15:06,936
Don't think she's on something,
do you?

1340
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,521
Oh, dad.

1341
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:11,565
No, I just thought that
you'd probably know more

1342
01:15:11,565 --> 01:15:12,942
about these things than I do.

1343
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:16,028
Hmm, you think I'm part
of the drug culture, do you?

1344
01:15:18,531 --> 01:15:20,115
Well, she's...

1345
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:24,078
I think she sort of, changed
in some way or something.

1346
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,873
Did you meet
any of her friends?

1347
01:15:27,873 --> 01:15:29,792
Yeah. There was one guy.

1348
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:31,085
I think he was called Carlo.

1349
01:15:31,085 --> 01:15:32,545
He is quite good looking.

1350
01:15:32,545 --> 01:15:35,798
Yeah, I got the feeling they
knew each other pretty well.

1351
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:37,299
Do you think he might be--

1352
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:40,678
Well, I mean, it's not exactly
your usual Latin love,

1353
01:15:40,678 --> 01:15:41,887
if that's what you mean?

1354
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,935
-You think she's happy though?
-Yeah. Why not?

1355
01:15:47,935 --> 01:15:50,938
Lovely house, pool,
loads of loot.

1356
01:15:50,938 --> 01:15:52,022
No, but...

1357
01:15:52,773 --> 01:15:54,817
I mean, you know...

1358
01:15:54,817 --> 01:15:57,194
Dad, she's really happy
to be here, right?

1359
01:15:59,113 --> 01:16:00,614
Come on.

1360
01:16:01,448 --> 01:16:03,367
Don't start your worrying.

1361
01:16:05,369 --> 01:16:07,413
-God bless you, darling.
-Uh-hmm.

01:16:07,872 --> 01:16:09,915
-Bye.

there is a season,

and a time to every purpose

A time to be born...

1369
01:16:54,919 --> 01:16:57,213
and a time to die.

1370
01:16:57,922 --> 01:16:59,673
A time to plant...

1371
01:16:59,673 --> 01:17:01,717
and a time to pluck up

1372
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,761
that which is planted.

1373
01:17:04,511 --> 01:17:06,430
A time to kill...

and a time to heal.

Is it indeed?

1402
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,610
And how old are you, Henry?

1403
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,486
I'm eight.

1404
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:51,905
Ah, the best possible age to be.

1405
01:20:53,031 --> 01:20:54,741

01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:04,751
-Let's go have lunch.
-[Henry] Okay.

1409
01:21:10,174 --> 01:21:11,258
Pandora.

1410
01:21:13,552 --> 01:21:15,179
[sighs]
Lovely to see you, Edmund.

1411
01:21:17,181 --> 01:21:18,724
How are you?

1412
01:21:18,724 --> 01:21:20,309
Extremely well.

1413
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:25,939
You look...

1414
01:21:26,607 --> 01:21:27,691
absolutely wonderful.

1415
01:21:28,066 --> 01:21:30,819
Oh, please don't go over
the usual clichés.

1416
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:33,197
I always know I'm looking
ghastly when people tell me...

1417
01:21:33,197 --> 01:21:34,281
I look wonderful.

1418
01:21:34,281 --> 01:21:37,284
I was merely gonna comment
on the elegance of your outfit

1419
01:21:37,284 --> 01:21:38,577
and how good it looks.

1420
01:21:39,912 --> 01:21:42,122
Not even lip service
to flattery.

1421
01:21:42,122 --> 01:21:44,249
Must be looking worse
than I thought.

1422
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:46,835
[Violet] Oh, Archie.

1423
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:48,253
Where would you like us to sit?

1424
01:21:48,253 --> 01:21:50,506
[Archie] Uh, why don't you come
and sit here?

1425
01:21:51,381 --> 01:21:53,550
And Pandora...

1426
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,093
We'll plant ourselves here.

1427
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,596
-Honey.
-Okay.

1428
01:21:57,596 --> 01:22:00,641
[indistinct chatter]

1429
01:22:01,058 --> 01:22:03,310
Well, I shall sit next to Henry.

1430
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:05,520
-May I?
-Of course.

1431
01:22:09,608 --> 01:22:12,653
[indistinct chatter]

1432
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:25,123
So, Henry, tell me,
what do you like to do best?

1433
01:22:25,123 --> 01:22:28,126
[dramatic music playing]

1434
01:22:28,126 --> 01:22:31,171
[indistinct chatter]

1435
01:22:49,773 --> 01:22:51,525
It'll end in tears.

1436
01:22:51,525 --> 01:22:53,443
Always did.

1437
01:22:53,443 --> 01:22:56,446
[indistinct chatter]

1438
01:22:58,949 --> 01:23:02,035
[indistinct chatter]

1439
01:23:11,128 --> 01:23:15,674
[Archie] Uh, Virginia,
you need to aim just there.

1440
01:23:16,883 --> 01:23:18,802
Quite impressed with what
you have in mind.

1441
01:23:20,137 --> 01:23:22,014
-[Archie] Great put.
-Oh. [chuckles]

1442
01:23:22,014 --> 01:23:23,432
[Henry] Come on, Sasha. Come on.

1443
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:25,642
Here's the stick.
Go fetch, girl.

1444
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:28,645
Come on, Sasha. Come on.

1445
01:23:31,523 --> 01:23:33,150
Come on.

1446
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:37,404
Nice child, your Henry.

1447
01:23:38,572 --> 01:23:40,699
[Edmund] Yes. He's a good boy.

1448
01:23:41,366 --> 01:23:43,493
I try to imagine, sometimes,
what it would be like

1449
01:23:43,493 --> 01:23:45,037
to have a child?

1450
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:47,414
Pandora, don't do this.

1451
01:23:47,748 --> 01:23:48,999
What?

1452
01:23:49,416 --> 01:23:50,917
I went through hell.

1453
01:23:50,917 --> 01:23:52,419
Oh, did you, sweetie?
What a shame.

1454
01:23:52,419 --> 01:23:54,046
What I'm trying to say
is that--

1455
01:23:54,046 --> 01:23:56,673
What you're trying to say is "Go
away, you embarrassing woman.

1456
01:23:56,673 --> 01:23:58,884
Don't mess up my nice,
tidy life again,"

1457
01:23:58,884 --> 01:24:01,178
-isn't that right?
-You know, it's not.

1458
01:24:01,178 --> 01:24:03,347
What are you trying to say,
Edmund?

1459
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:04,973
Do tell.

1460
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,267
I'd like to get to know
the new improved Edmund.

1461
01:24:07,267 --> 01:24:08,769
[sighs]

1462
01:24:11,271 --> 01:24:12,856
Why did you come back?

1463
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:16,526
Reasons?

1464
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:19,821
This Verena Steynton party.

1465
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:21,323
No. I can't believe that.

1466
01:24:23,742 --> 01:24:25,827
Well, maybe...

1467
01:24:26,703 --> 01:24:29,706
I just wanted to see how well
you'd all settled down.

1468
01:24:30,957 --> 01:24:32,918
Shake you up a bit. Hmm.

1469
01:24:35,295 --> 01:24:37,672
-Are you happy?
-Don't be silly.

1470
01:24:40,676 --> 01:24:42,052
Are you?

1471
01:24:44,137 --> 01:24:45,722
Are you happy, Edmund?

1472
01:24:45,722 --> 01:24:48,767
[dramatic music playing]

1473
01:24:50,519 --> 01:24:51,937
[sighs]

1474
01:24:51,937 --> 01:24:53,438
Are you?

1475
01:24:54,272 --> 01:24:56,483
After Caroline was killed...

1476
01:24:58,694 --> 01:24:59,986
You knew about that?

1477
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:01,488
Yeah.

1478
01:25:07,285 --> 01:25:08,829
Archie wrote me.

1479
01:25:09,955 --> 01:25:11,373
Drunk driving he said.

1480
01:25:15,168 --> 01:25:17,921
I began several letters
but I didn't finish them.

1481
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:18,839
I'm sorry.

1482
01:25:19,089 --> 01:25:21,675
Well, I decided that keeping
busy was the only thing.

1483
01:25:22,008 --> 01:25:24,219
Fill every second
of the day with work.

1484
01:25:25,846 --> 01:25:27,639
It was good for the firm.

1485
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:29,766
Bad for the soul, I'm afraid.

1486
01:25:31,101 --> 01:25:33,353
Luckily, Virginia came along.

1487
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,524
I can't imagine life
without her.

1488
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,194
Does that answer your question?

1489
01:25:42,195 --> 01:25:44,698
[chuckling]

1490
01:25:44,698 --> 01:25:47,492
I hope your board members
are more impressed

1491
01:25:47,492 --> 01:25:49,411
by your eloquence, Edmund dear.

1492
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:51,788
-Hmm?
-I think it's time for tea.

1493
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,457
Pandora?

1494
01:25:57,127 --> 01:25:58,753
Tea?

1495
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:00,881
Edmund, would you get me
a cup of tea?

1496
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:03,675
I can't move.

1497
01:26:10,807 --> 01:26:14,060
It's been a beautiful day,
Isobel. Thank you.

1498
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,396
It's lovely to see Archie
looking so happy.

1499
01:26:16,813 --> 01:26:18,064
Yes.

1500
01:26:18,064 --> 01:26:21,651
And Pandora, so... at home.

1501
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:24,404
Makes one wonder.

1502
01:26:25,489 --> 01:26:27,491
Well, this isn't getting
the tea made.

1503
01:26:30,702 --> 01:26:32,829
Vi, come. Come sit.

1504
01:26:39,002 --> 01:26:40,295
Here I am.

1505
01:26:41,338 --> 01:26:43,548
Oh. [chuckles]

1506
01:26:44,007 --> 01:26:47,135
-[sighs]
-You always look so happy.

1507
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:49,262
That's the way I remember you.

1508
01:26:50,889 --> 01:26:53,517
Archie was frantic, you know,
when you went off.

1509
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:55,727
He tried to find you.

1510
01:26:56,603 --> 01:26:58,855
The next thing we knew,
you were in America.

1511
01:26:59,898 --> 01:27:01,942
I supposed I was lucky in a way.

1512
01:27:03,902 --> 01:27:05,111
If it happened today,

1513
01:27:05,111 --> 01:27:06,947
the tabloids
would be full of it.

1514
01:27:07,697 --> 01:27:11,076
"School girl seduces
married millionaire."

1515
01:27:11,535 --> 01:27:12,661
Shock, horror.

1516
01:27:13,745 --> 01:27:15,163
Why Pandora?

1517
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:17,624
Hmm...

1518
01:27:18,041 --> 01:27:20,836
thought it was, glamorous,
grownup.

1519
01:27:22,879 --> 01:27:24,297
I was bored, I expect.

1520
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:27,759
Boredom can be dangerous.

1521
01:27:27,759 --> 01:27:30,053
When children are bored,
they sometimes...

1522
01:27:30,053 --> 01:27:31,137
smash up their toys.

1523
01:27:31,471 --> 01:27:33,473
Well, you don't want
to listen to me chatting on.

1524
01:27:33,473 --> 01:27:36,142
You want to catch up
with everyone's news.

1525
01:27:36,142 --> 01:27:38,728
After all, you won't be
staying long, will you, Pandora?

1526
01:27:39,646 --> 01:27:41,731
Just till the dance, I suppose.

1527
01:27:45,735 --> 01:27:48,363
Well, I knew the prodigal son
got the fatted calf

1528
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,115
but I didn't know
they went on to say,

1529
01:27:50,115 --> 01:27:52,325
"You'll just be staying
till the end of the feast then."

1530
01:27:56,079 --> 01:27:58,623
I haven't really decided
what I'm going to do...

1531
01:28:00,166 --> 01:28:01,042
yet.

1532
01:28:03,962 --> 01:28:05,213
Well...

1533
01:28:07,173 --> 01:28:09,217
I want my tea.

1534
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,553
Oh, dear.

1535
01:28:18,602 --> 01:28:20,228
[Lucilla] Wow. Good one.

1536
01:28:21,938 --> 01:28:23,023
Very good.

1537
01:28:23,023 --> 01:28:25,150
Oh, careful. Careful. Oh, no.

1538
01:28:31,114 --> 01:28:34,034
Lucilla, would you take
Pandora her tea?

1539
01:28:34,034 --> 01:28:35,994
-We have to go.
-Sure.

1540
01:28:38,622 --> 01:28:40,123
We're going?

1541
01:28:41,124 --> 01:28:42,250
Uh-hmm.

1542
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:45,837
Henry.

1543
01:28:51,635 --> 01:28:53,553
Hey, how about a walk?

1544
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:56,056
Had a walk this morning.

1545
01:28:59,059 --> 01:29:00,727
Hey, what's with this?

1546
01:29:01,269 --> 01:29:02,937
I thought you were done
with that.

1547
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:04,689
Can't take it to school
with you.

1548
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,524
I know that.

1549
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:11,529
[door slams]

1550
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:13,281
There's eight of us.

1551
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:15,492
I'm the eldest
and the best looking.

1552
01:29:15,867 --> 01:29:17,702
Then there's Olive,
she's the married one.

1553
01:29:17,702 --> 01:29:18,578
Laurette...

1554
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,085
Henry all right?

1555
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:27,629
He's dreading it.

1556
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:32,300
It was interesting
meeting Pandora.

1557
01:29:33,426 --> 01:29:35,470
Was she like you remembered her?

1558
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:38,515
[sighs]

1559
01:29:38,515 --> 01:29:39,808
Well, it's all more than...

1560
01:29:40,225 --> 01:29:41,434
20 years ago.

1561
01:29:48,441 --> 01:29:50,777
[suspenseful music playing]

1562
01:29:50,777 --> 01:29:53,029
[Pandora] I told you not
to call me here.

1563
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:56,991
[man] I'm not checking
up on you,

1564
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:58,410
I just want to know why?

1565
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:00,286
Why?
-[man] Yes, why?

1566
01:30:00,286 --> 01:30:03,039
-You know it's dangerous.
-Look, I can handle it.

1567
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:05,208
[man] Can you? Really?

1568
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:08,920
-What the hell do you expect--
-I have things to settle here.

1569
01:30:09,754 --> 01:30:12,424
[man] Pandora, I know you're
concerned, but you--

1570
01:30:12,424 --> 01:30:14,217
Don't call me again.

1571
01:30:14,759 --> 01:30:16,970
-[man] But--
-Don't call me again.

1572
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:18,555
[man] As you wish.

1573
01:30:20,432 --> 01:30:23,601

01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:30,525
