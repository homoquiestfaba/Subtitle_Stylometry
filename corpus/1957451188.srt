00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:27,020
That's all I got in here, but I
can show you the rest later.

365
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,022
Yeah, I'd love to.

366
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:32,459
[Fred] So what do you guys want
to do today?

367
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:35,462
We can go for a ride,
for a hike.

368
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:38,265
We can go to my friend's winery.

369
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:40,167
This is his wine actually.

370
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,369
I think I gotta go back to bed.

371
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:44,706
Oh. Jet leg killing you?

372
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:49,243
Yeah, I'm just not feeling it
all of a sudden.

373
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:53,615
Okay.

374
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:56,383
Well, I need to practice anyway.

375
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,725
Actually, tonight
there's a party.

376
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,993
It's Valerie's birthday.

377
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:07,361
Oh, really?

378
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:08,395
Yeah.

379
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:10,197
Lane, you're going to love it.

380
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,369
Like a lot of great people,
really nice, calm and intimate.

381
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,971
We usually end up playing.

382
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,474
Maybe a good chance for you to get
back into a couple of songs, babe.

383
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:24,211
Maybe.

384
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:28,182
Babe, it's going to get harder
if you don't push through.

385
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:31,519
And plus this is the best
environment to practice in.

386
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:34,254
People are going to get drunk
and have fun.

387
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,426
Don't push yourself
if it's not gonna feel good.

388
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:50,437
So there's this massage therapy
training program in Barcelona

389
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:52,740
and I think I'm going to do it.

390
00:32:52,774 --> 00:32:54,776
So, Fred, I could really use
your help writing

391
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,277
to the instructor,
kind of talk about my plans.

392
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,615
Massage therapy?

393
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:01,716
Mm-hmm.

394
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:04,284
You know, it's just like
something I really wanna do.

395
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,119
I can do it anywhere.

396
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:09,122
And I'm sick of trying
to work for other people.

397
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:12,025
It seems kind of random.

398
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,261
Couldn't you find something like
that to do around here?

399
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:16,330
And when does it start?

400
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:17,665
I was thinking next week,

401
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:19,601
but, you know,
it's actually kind of flexible.

402
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:23,470
It's just like with this woman
in her house, so.

403
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,176
What?

404
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:30,410
[laptop trackpad clicks]

405
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:44,792
[shuts laptop]

406
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:55,670
[thud]

407
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:02,510
[piano playing downstairs]

408
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,359
Did I wake you?

409
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:20,695
Mm-mm.

410
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:33,541
Did Fred tell you to
bring those?

411
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:35,677
Mm-hmm.

412
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,715
My God, he's so worried.

413
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,685
Should he not be?

414
00:34:47,855 --> 00:34:51,491
Pills is not what I need,
nor what I want.

415
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:58,566
[piano music continues]

416
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,248
[Lane] Did Fred go out?

417
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,684
He's at a rehearsal.

418
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:19,520
[piano music continues]

419
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,737
[breathing heavily]

420
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,220
Lane.

421
00:35:57,257 --> 00:35:59,927
Lane, Lane.

422
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:01,495
[exhales]

423
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:18,880
[guitar and accordion music]

424
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:21,139
She was lucky,
she had done movies before.

425
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:23,517
Well, let's not exaggerate.

426
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,936
Yes, it's true!

427
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:30,190
[laughter]

428
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:31,984
No, no, no.

429
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:35,529
Yes, well, it was us.
Our concerts were the best.

430
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,072
What?

431
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,490
- You can say it.
- All right, all right.

432
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:42,077
Without a problem, you can say it.

433
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:14,234
Are you all having a good time?

434
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:15,986
Just goofing around.

435
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,197
As usual.

436
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,117
Marianne, if you don't mind could you
start with the bathroom upstairs?

437
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,828
No problem at all. I'll get started.

438
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,246
- See you later.
- <i>Merci.</i>

439
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:31,953
[indistinct chatter]

440
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,182
Hey. How are you?

441
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:47,434
- I'm good. And you?
- I'm good.

442
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:50,687
And your Grandma?

443
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,231
She is not good at all. It is what it is.

444
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:56,443
So haven't you left for your tour yet?

445
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,153
Wednesday.

446
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:03,784
Since when have you been working here?

447
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:07,454
It's been a while. They're kind.

448
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,333
How's Bertie?

449
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:13,460
She's better.

450
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,587
Our ex came to see us.

451
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:18,924
Always the same story with you.

452
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:23,387
Aren't you tired
of being surrounded by all these women?

453
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:25,848
You need to concentrate, Mr. Carnot.

454
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:27,724
Isn't all that a distraction?

455
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,854
No, on the contrary.

456
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:42,155
So, you don't need a new singer
for your tour anymore, right?

457
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,240
Since she's better.

458
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:47,202
I'm ready to go.

459
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,739
[guitar music]

460
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:04,679
- Oh, hey, good choice.
- [Bertie chuckles]

461
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:11,476
Shall we?

462
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,521
Let's go.

463
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:17,992
[dramatic music]

464
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:38,880
[inaudible dialogue]

465
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:57,999
[keyboard solo, groovy music]

466
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:30,932
[indistinct chatter]

467
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:49,884
Are you sure?
That was when...

468
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,102
Man, I cannot
understand anything

469
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,103
some of these people are saying.

470
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,571
I thought my French was good,

471
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:11,906
but I don't know what is going
on here.

472
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:13,174
Yeah, they're super southern.

473
00:41:13,207 --> 00:41:14,041
It's crazy.

474
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,549
Look, about earlier...

475
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:22,216
My bad.

476
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:25,786
I mean, you're married now,
right?

477
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,254
That'd be like adultery.

478
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:29,824
You know that's illegal
in some countries?

479
00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:32,660
Well, I guess the same countries
where being gay is illegal.

480
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:34,795
So we'd be screwed either way.

481
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,632
Yeah, well, France,
isn't one of those countries.

482
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:39,900
Fair point.

483
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,071
And so we're clear,

484
00:41:44,105 --> 00:41:45,706
it has nothing to do
with me being married.

485
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,141
I got it.

486
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,811
Who's that?

487
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:55,816
[Bertie] Oh, that's Noa, she's
from Israel.

488
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,784
Really?

489
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:58,652
She was in the army
for, like, a few years.

490
00:41:58,686 --> 00:41:59,854
Like how many?

491
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,756
How many? I don't know.

492
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,958
But longer than she had to be.

493
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:15,102
How was your anti-occupation
work going by the way?

494
00:42:15,136 --> 00:42:17,171
Are you still boycotting
that brand of hummus?

495
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:19,840
Are you not still boycotting
that brand of hummus?

496
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:22,309
The French aren't into hummus.

497
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:24,712
But there's this fish dip thing
that they eat a lot.

498
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:26,714
Oh, I forgot...
I forgot what it's called.

499
00:42:27,882 --> 00:42:29,050
It's so good though.

500
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:33,788
Oh, God.

501
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:35,689
- What's wrong, Bert?
- You're doing that thing.

502
00:42:35,723 --> 00:42:36,724
What thing?

503
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:38,292
With your eyes, stop it.

504
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:40,094
I don't know what you're
talking about.

505
00:42:42,296 --> 00:42:44,198
Are you going to pick
a fight with her?

506
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:45,933
Please don't get all
political on me.

507
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:47,701
No, she's cute.

508
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:48,836
I might learn a thing or two.

509
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,004
- Hey.
- [Noa] Hey.

510
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:51,172
- Hey, Noa.
- Bertie.

511
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:52,873
- How are ya?
- How are you?

512
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:58,813
Hey, and you are, the bartender?

513
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:00,714
- I can be.
- Yeah?

514
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:01,682
What are you drinking?

515
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:02,716
I take whisky.

516
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,952
All right.

517
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,187
So you're back from Israel?

518
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,189
Yeah, yeah,
my brother married a French guy,

519
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:10,124
and then Valerie just said I
could come,

520
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:12,026
stay here for the rest
of the summer.

521
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:13,994
Just work on some paintings.

522
00:43:14,028 --> 00:43:15,329
- Okay.
- I promised myself I won't get

523
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:17,031
too drunk tonight
like last year though.

524
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:18,399
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

525
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:21,635
Last summer at Valerie's party
I got,

526
00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:25,706
I got a little too crazy
and Bertie here saved my life.

527
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:26,740
She's good at that.

528
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:27,908
- Yeah.
- Here.

529
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,343
Thanks.

530
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:30,644
I'm Noa.

531
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:31,912
Lane.

532
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:43,090
You guys seen Valerie's
new car yet?

533
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:45,092
No. She got another one?

534
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:48,395
[Lane] Damn.

535
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:50,397
I know.

536
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:51,265
You wanna drive?

537
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:54,335
Can't drive stick.

538
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:55,436
Americans.

539
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,404
[Lane] You all drive stick
in Israel?

540
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:58,973
Some of us do.

541
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:01,041
Learning something already.

542

723
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:36,456
Yeah, it's super funny.

724
00:57:38,025 --> 00:57:40,161
I can't stand those things.

725
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:41,562
Why?

726
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:43,064
All those crazy animals.

727
00:57:43,097 --> 00:57:44,231
Could kill all those kids.

728
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,034
Isn't that the point?

729
00:57:48,703 --> 00:57:51,272
[both chuckle]

730
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:52,273
[door opens]

731
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:53,874
Good morning.

732
00:57:53,908 --> 00:57:55,676
- Good morning.
- Morning.

733
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:56,944
Hi.

734
00:58:15,696 --> 00:58:16,530
You guys sleep okay?

735
00:58:16,564 --> 00:58:18,666
Yeah. Very well.

736
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:19,567
Like a rock.

737
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,235
Yeah, me too.

738
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,771
Think I'm finally
getting over that jet lag.

739
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:25,206
[Noa] I love that you don't have
air conditioning.

740
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:28,109
I keep begging Valerie
to turn hers off all summer.

741
00:58:28,142 --> 00:58:29,977
Oh, yeah? You like to sweat?

742
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:31,645
[Noa] I like sweating
when I sleep.

743
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:33,147
[Lane] Hmm. Me too.

744
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,849
I guess we were sweating
a lot last night.

745
00:58:37,718 --> 00:58:39,887
You're a Saints fan?

746
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,756
I'm a science fan?

747
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,257
Saints, do you, are you a fan?

748
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:46,827
- It's your shirt.
- Oh, yeah, big one.

749
00:58:50,998 --> 00:58:55,836
So me and Fred,
we were just talking

750
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,238
about going to the river today.

751
00:58:57,271 --> 00:58:58,606
[Fred] Yes?

752
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,107
You wanna come?

753
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:03,611
I'd love to, I don't wanna
intrude though.

754
00:59:03,644 --> 00:59:06,013
No please, come.

755
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:09,083
Our car has four seats.

756
00:59:09,116 --> 00:59:13,687
[clarinet solo,
traditional jazz music]

757
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:15,322
Yeah, yeah. We should go.

758
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:17,124
- All right.
- [Lane] Yeah, we should.

759
00:59:17,158 --> 00:59:19,026
- Babe, can you hand me some of that?
- [Lane] I got it.

760
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:25,266
[Fred] Cool.

761
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:28,102
[traditional jazz music swells]

762
00:59:56,997 --> 01:00:00,034
[indistinct chatter]

763
01:00:05,072 --> 01:00:08,876
[Lane] So how old is Noa anyway?
Like 25?

764
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:09,877
[Bertie] Probably.

765
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,345
[Lane] And?

766
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:14,215
[Bertie] Nothing. You just
usually like them older.

767
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:17,184
She spoke Hebrew to me
while we were having sex.

768
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:18,319
Really?

769
01:00:18,352 --> 01:00:20,387
It messed me up,
I was super into it.

770
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:25,860
[Bertie] Damn.

771
01:00:25,893 --> 01:00:27,261
I know.

772
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:30,965
Yeah, soccer is very popular.

773
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,035
- You wanna get my back?
- Mm-hmm.

774
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:45,913
Are you really serious about
this massage therapy thing?

775
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:47,948
I think so.

776
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:50,684
You sure it's not an excuse for you
to keep touching people all the time?

777
01:00:50,718 --> 01:00:52,086
Whatever.

778
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:55,222
All right, well,
let's see what you got.

779
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,125
Okay.

780
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:03,097
Did you see that...

781
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:04,999
[Bertie] Damn,
I'm not gonna lie.

782
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:07,735
I miss having sex with women.

783
01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:09,136
Ouch!

784
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,771
So what, there's no queers
around here?

785
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:13,374
No, and if there are, I don't
know where they're hiding.

786
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:18,946
Hey.

787
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:20,147
- Hi.
- Hi.

788
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:25,753
How's the water?

789
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:27,821
Fucking freezing.

790
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:28,789
How's the massage going?

791
01:01:28,822 --> 01:01:31,759
Yeah, she's all right.
Needs a little work.

792
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,227
Fuck you.

793
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,763
What, I'm just kidding.

794
01:01:35,796 --> 01:01:36,830
You were great.

795
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:38,032
Can I try?

796
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:41,035
You know I'm not gonna say no.

797
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,316
Oh.

798
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:56,984
They teach you this in army?

799
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:59,353
Oh, yeah.

800
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:02,489
I got so good I could ask
whatever I wanted from anyone.

801
01:02:02,524 --> 01:02:05,192
Oh, I bet you could.

802
01:02:05,226 --> 01:02:07,895
What kind of things
you trade for?

803
01:02:07,928 --> 01:02:11,365
Uh, depended I guess.

804
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:17,271
Sometimes a favor,
sometimes just cleaning my gun.

805
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:18,372
Oh.

806
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:22,510
You ever trade it for sex?

807
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:25,446
No, never needed to
trade for sex.

808
01:02:27,515 --> 01:02:30,484
Did you even get horny
during all that army time?

809
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:32,786
Like all that violence,
isn't that a turn off?

810
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,088
Bertie, come on.

811
01:02:34,121 --> 01:02:35,189
What, I'm interested.

812
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:36,857
No, you're not.

813
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:37,726
Yes, I am.

814
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,997
You should get yourself
a massage therapist.

815
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,164
You're really tight.

816
01:02:53,474 --> 01:02:54,842
Sorry.

817
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:57,177
It's okay.

818
01:02:57,211 --> 01:03:00,881
[bell tolling distantly]

819
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:04,218
[slow French music]

820
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:24,138
[French song playing]

821
01:04:02,943 --> 01:04:06,614
[song continues]

822
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:15,289
[sheep bleating]

823
01:04:30,104 --> 01:04:33,641
[song continues]

824
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:20,220
[song continues]

825
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:39,473
[slow big band music]

826
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,010
Hey.

827
01:05:43,745 --> 01:05:45,379
Hey.

828
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,420
Come dance with me.

829
01:06:03,096 --> 01:06:06,568
[Fred sighs]

830
01:06:16,443 --> 01:06:18,378
- Lane.
- Hmm.

831
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:22,517
What are you doing?

832
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:27,387
What do you mean
what am I doing?

833
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:33,628
I thought you came here to
figure things out with Bertie.

834
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:39,166
I did.

835
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:43,638
Right, so you're just doing it
the Lane way?

836
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,709
Do you think I should be getting
down on my knees

837
01:06:47,742 --> 01:06:50,778
and begging her to take me back?

838
01:06:50,812 --> 01:06:54,649
Don't you think you
owe her that?

839
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:57,484
No, I don't.

840
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:04,124
And if you really think that's
the way to get Bertie's attention,

841
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:06,661
then I really wonder
if you even know her at all.

842
01:07:08,395 --> 01:07:11,365
Look, stop fucking around.

843
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:17,170
Do you think this is fun for me?

844
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:21,609
Well, that's you,
just thinking about having fun.

845
01:07:26,146 --> 01:07:29,416
When are you going
to take things seriously?

846
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:32,554
You want me to come move to France
and play happy family with you guys?

847
01:07:37,457 --> 01:07:38,693
Do you still love her?

848
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:50,672
Do you?

849
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:55,810
You know that her career is the
most important thing to her.

850
01:07:55,843 --> 01:07:59,547
More important
than either of us has ever been.

851
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:01,783
And she hasn't sung
like she sung last night.

852
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:04,686
Since you left.

853
01:08:09,624 --> 01:08:12,492
And I know I'll never have that
effect on her.

854
01:08:17,732 --> 01:08:20,602
This really is all
about your tour.

855
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:23,705
Isn't it?

856
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:31,713
[thunder rumbling]

857
01:08:53,868 --> 01:08:56,436
[thunder rumbling distantly]

858
01:09:36,443 --> 01:09:39,580
[indistinct chatter]

859
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:20,287
<i>Merci!</i>

860
01:10:22,857 --> 01:10:23,858
<i>Merci!</i>

861
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:26,561
<i>Excusez moi! Excusez moi.</i>

862
01:10:31,298 --> 01:10:32,100
What'd you get?

863
01:10:33,366 --> 01:10:35,268
Some fish,
I'm going to cook tonight.

864
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:36,537
Catfish?

865
01:10:36,571 --> 01:10:38,873
[laughs] No, similar.

866
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:41,509
They don't have catfish here
but similar.

867
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:42,910
All right.

868
01:10:42,944 --> 01:10:44,545
Doesn't Fred hate
the catfish though?

869
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:45,880
He has a gig tonight.

870
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,583
Can I invite Noa?

871
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:54,387
No, nope, no, just, yup,
kidding.

872
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:55,957
Oof. Okay.

873
01:11:09,604 --> 01:11:12,707
[pan sizzling]

874
01:11:48,643 --> 01:11:49,944
Do you want me to stay?

875
01:11:57,685 --> 01:12:01,722
Because I could go. If you
don't, I could go tomorrow.

876
01:12:07,595 --> 01:12:08,796
Lane, you disappeared.

877
01:12:11,165 --> 01:12:12,567
With no explanation.

878
01:12:16,637 --> 01:12:18,105
How could you do that?

879
01:12:21,943 --> 01:12:24,812
And now you're back,
again with no explanation.

880
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:30,651
Sitting here trying to get me
to tell you what to do.

881
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,523
Do you want me to just
love up on you?

882
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:36,423
Like I used to?

883
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:41,829
Just because you came back?

884
01:12:44,464 --> 01:12:46,667
I don't know
what Fred has been telling you,

885
01:12:46,701 --> 01:12:52,006
but my happiness
is not tied to you

886
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:54,842
and it's not tied to him.

887
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:57,778
If you want to stay, fine.

888
01:12:57,812 --> 01:13:00,848
Great, we'll see how it goes.

889
01:13:00,882 --> 01:13:03,184
But if you want
to go fuck around in Madrid,

890
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:05,853
you can do that too.
And that'd be fine with me too.

891
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:11,692
I don't care. I...

892
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:14,161
I don't have the space to care.

893
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:16,530
You don't have
to hold everything on your own.

894
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:18,833
There's two of us here
who care about you,

895
01:13:18,866 --> 01:13:23,804
who love you, who are willing to
catch you if you would just let us.

896
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:29,810
What the hell happened
in your life

897
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:31,812
that made you wind up here
trying to get back into mine?

898
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:37,718
Because that's what you do,
right?

899
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,188
You get up, set shit on fire

900
01:13:41,222 --> 01:13:44,959
and find another creek
to fish in.

901
01:13:44,992 --> 01:13:50,164
