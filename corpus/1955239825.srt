1
00:00:06,638 --> 00:00:08,739
The story of the
American frontier

2
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:12,477
is a tale of conquest
but also one of survival,

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,146
persistence and the
grit of the people.

4
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:18,750
It's 20 years after
a bloody Civil War.

5
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:22,887
Despite Abraham Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation,

6
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:25,656
slavery is alive and
well in the Wild West,

7
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:29,562
in the form of prostitution,
the world's oldest profession.

8
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:33,998
In Kansas and most of
the western territories,

9
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:37,803
women are bought, sold
and traded like property.

10
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:43,293
<b>TRADED</b>

11
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:47,316
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

12
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:03,161
Come on Pa, show me how!

13
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:04,396
All right, all right,

14
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:07,299
now I'm gonna do this
one time, all right?

15
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:11,869
Now the idea is when
the tyin's bein' done,

16
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:13,806
you wanna flex your muscles.

17
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:20,046
Blow your chest
up like a rooster.

18
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:23,482
What's a rooster do?

19
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:27,218
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

20
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:28,520
That's right, now you see,

21
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:32,023
when the tyin's done,
you relax your muscles,

22
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,958
blow all the air
outta your chest...

23
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:39,230
And now look,

24
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:41,098
the rope gives ya
just enough room

25
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,169
so you can get yourself free.

26
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:46,705
Show me how Pa, show me how!

27
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,005
Maybe after supper.

28
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:49,640
And your studies.

29
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,977
The capital of
Kansas is Topeka,

30
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:53,712
and the President
of the United States

31
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,014
is Chester Alvin Arthur.

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,716
Chester Alan Arthur.

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,287
Chester Alan Arthur.

34
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,092
Can we ask him now, Ma?

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,531
Before the day's activities
sour his disposition?

36
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:22,106
What do you care about
some stupid old dance anyway?

37
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:23,708
You hush up!

38
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,143
Do my eyes deceive
me? Is that a...

39
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:27,379
Apple pie.

40
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:29,615
I picked, peeled and
sliced all the apples,

41
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,651
and then spiced
them with cinnamon.

42
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,088
Clay, Lily was
invited to a tie dance,

43
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,955
over at the Tigman Ranch.

44
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:41,892
You know apple
pie is my favorite.

45
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,229
Spiced with cinnamon.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,903
The dance is the girls
wear a calico dress

47
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:55,640
and they bring a matching
tie for the boys to choose.

48
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:59,110
Now I am familiar
with the procedure

49
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:01,246
of a tie dance, young lady.

50
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:04,717
In fact, there was a time...

51
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,321
It wasn't so long ago,
as a matter of fact...

52
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:21,866
Flies in the buttermilk?

53
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:22,800
Yuck!

54
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:26,671
Well Pa, can I go?

55
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:35,813
I'm sorry Darlin'.

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,716
Maybe next year.

57
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:39,285
But Pa!

58
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,089
You know what this pie needs?

59
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:45,824
My teeth?

60
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:46,892
Some honey.

61
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,660
I'll fetch some.

62
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,219
Well last summer you let
me work at the Mercantile.

63
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:18,657
Nellie Wilcott is 16 and
she's been proposed to.

64
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,226
Darlin'...

65
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:25,296
Nellie Wilcott is not my
beautiful little girl.

66
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,933
It's just a tie dance Pa.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,803
Besides, if I ever do find
a beau, once he meets you,

68
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:35,272
he'll be too scared to
ever call on me again.

69
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,976
Darlin', I'm sorry.

70
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,410
Now this matter is settled.

71
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:41,946
I wanna have my dinner in peace.

72
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:50,354
How long does it take that
boy to fetch some honey?

73
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:52,825
I'll get him.

74
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:02,834
They're gonna
come callin' Clay.

75
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,537
And we both know that extra
year is for you, not her.

76
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:08,140
Amelia you's the
one what told me

77
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,940
what your dancin' days led to.

78
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,210
I was dancin' at the
Broken Spoke Saloon,

79
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:14,779
not the Tigman's front parlor.

80
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,916
And I didn't have
two loving parents.

81
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:21,386
That's my little girl.

82
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,790
If I ain't gonna protect her,

83
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,025
who's gonna?

84
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:45,410
Ma! Pa!

85
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:47,912
Lily?

86
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,517
My god!

87
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,453
Jake?

88
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:57,055
Jake!

89
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:58,491
What happened?

90
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,460
Come here.

91
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,029
Watch out, watch out!

92
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,755
You can take
comfort, Mr. Travis,

93
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:21,560
in knowing that Jake is
in a much better place.

94
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,162
All due respect Reverend,

95
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,634
I'd rather have my boy
standing right here beside me.

96
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,670
I am sorry for your loss.

97
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,695
For the life of me,

98
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:01,332
I just can't remember
the sound of his voice.

99
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:06,605
I'd give anything to hear
his voice one more time.

100
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:11,777
He was my little boy.

101
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:15,780
He's an angel.

102
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:27,358
Blame me.

103
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,428
Just say it.

104
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,299
I'm the one who
asked for the honey.

105
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,770
Blame me.

106
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:42,106
-Amelia.
-Blame me!

107
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,341
Come on!

108
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,642
Blame me!

109
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,111
Blame me!

110
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,378
Blame me!

111
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:50,180
Blame me, blame me, blame me!

112
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:52,516
I need you to!

113
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,118
Please blame me!

114
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:55,352
Please?

115
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,710
We're nearly outta firewood.

116
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:31,689
I'll go chop some.

117
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:37,161
Mama.

118
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:40,465
I love you, it's gonna be okay.

119
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,888
Where are you off to?

120
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:38,956
Going to the lake.

121
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,592
I...

122
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,961
Need you to stay here and
help me with the canning.

123
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,630
But Ma, you never asked
me to help you before.

124
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:46,931
I thought you said
canning's the one job

125
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:49,800
you like to do all by yourself.

126
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,635
This time I want you helpin' me.

127
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:53,004
I done all my chores,
all my bookwork,

128
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:56,641
I was really lookin' forward
to going to the lake.

129
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:58,509
There's no tellin'
who's out there.

130
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:01,779
Last time I was out there,
it was just old man Hill.

131
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:04,283
That was nearly
a year ago and...

132
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:07,251
Just had to help
him bait his hook.

133
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:11,755
I also want your daddy
checkin' that boat for leaks.

134
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,958
But Ma, the boat is fine.

135
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,562
You're stayin' here and
helpin' me can these tomatoes!

136
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,797
Why are you bein' silly?

137
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,466
Don't you dare call me names.

138
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,969
Amelia.

139
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,276
Isn't that just like you?

140
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,411
Takin' her side.

141
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,681
Lily, Darlin',

142
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:40,550
I want you to stay here and
help your Mama with the canning.

143
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:43,287
Just for today, this one time.

144
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:54,399
Sweetie, I'm gonna go down
and check that boat for leaks.

145
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,933
Okay?

146
00:13:58,803 --> 00:13:59,803
Be a good girl.

147
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,406
Don't be doin'
me any favors Clay.

148
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:25,323
Lily get up, you've
slept long enough!

149
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:33,531
Lily!

150
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:43,475
Lily!

151
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:48,713
Lily, your Mama
is callin' you.

152
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:08,732
Probably just in the
privy or the barn.

153
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,101
Not possible.

154
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,537
I was awake before dawn.

155
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:39,997
Lily's horse is missing, I'm
going over to Jane Thompson's.

156
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,845
Can't find Lily nowhere.

157
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:30,614
Took her horse and left in
the middle of the night.

158
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:35,454
Jane Thompson.

159
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:40,892
You tell Mrs. Travis what
her daughter confided in you.

160
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,727
Or that matchin' blue bonnet
goes right back to Abilene!

161
00:17:58,642 --> 00:17:59,844
Woah.

162
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:06,518
She's gone to Newton to
catch a stage to Wichita.

163
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:10,554
She read an advertisement
about becoming a Harvey girl,

164
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:12,858
waitress like Jane's sister.

165
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,232
Thank you.

166
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:28,873
I'd like a ticket
to Wichita please.

167
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,844
Just one?

168
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:36,714
Yes sir.

169
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,184
That'll be 50 cents.

170
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:43,321
Visitin' family, are ya?

171
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,891
No, my family lives
'round these parts.

172
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,763
Employment?

173
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,064
Why yes,

174
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,601
I'm hopin' to get a
position as a Harvey girl.

175
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:00,837
I've heard a lot of
good things about that

176
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:02,841
outstandin' company.

177
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,015
Coach leaves in 10 minutes.

178
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:13,883
Thank you.

179
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,952
Good luck with your...

180
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:17,922
Job huntin'.

181
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,176
How do you do ma'am?

182
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,177

183
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,780

184
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:44,214

185
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:46,217
Well, Lily like a flower.

186
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:48,620
Pleased to meet you.

187
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,023
Has anyone told
you that you look

188
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,225
like sunshine in the morning?

189
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:13,344
You think you're
gonna need that?

190
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:24,889
Lily's horse, all cooled down.

191
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:26,957
Limber and well-fed.

192
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,860
You won't find a
finer animal in town.

193
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,396
Where's the owner?

194
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:36,266
You're lookin' at him.

195
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:39,838
That's my daughter's
horse, where is she?

196
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,174
I don't know.

197
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,376
Fella gave me a dollar
to ride that horse back.

198
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:48,746
Where did she go?

199
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,915
I don't know.

200
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:52,917
But I'm keepin' that dollar.

201
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,334
This girl been in here?

202
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:16,874
What's she to you?

203
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:19,343
She's our daughter.

204
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,416
The boy's a spittin'
image of you.

205
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:27,819
We're lookin' for the girl.

206
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,855
She has reddish-brown hair.

207
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:32,856
Down to here.

208
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:35,058
Reddish-brown you say?

209
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:36,961
Have you seen her?

210
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,398
She don't look nothin' like you.

211
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:43,300
Have you seen the girl?

212
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,370
Did she buy a ticket?

213
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,372
No.

214
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,842
Pretty little girl like that,

215
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:53,378
that hair?

216
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,246
I'd remember her.

217
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:58,349
You son of a bitch.

218
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:01,151
Clay.

219
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:03,321
Clay, let's go, come on now.

220
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,401
Maybe she changed her mind
and she's still in town?

221
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:23,908
Fella in there
is lyin' to you.

222
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:34,351
I think it's time you
told me everything you know.

223
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:44,394
She left a couple hours
ago on the stage to Wichita.

224
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:47,431
Honest to god,
or strike me dead.

225
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:52,402
I'm going to get her.

226
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:54,438
You head back to the ranch.

227
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:57,976
I'm not losing
another child, Clay.

228
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:02,947
Go to mercantile,
get us some supplies.

229
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,515
I'm gonna go in and
deal with this fella.

230
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:07,785
Be back here in five minutes.

231
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:12,557
Clay, Lily told Jane she
ran off because of our...

232
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,428
Because of my ill
temper and distress.

233
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,432
Five minutes.

234
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,282
Take your glasses off.

235
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:39,416
Pardon me?

236
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:41,886
Take your glasses off.

237
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,088
You son of a bitch!

238
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,534
Ma'am?

239
00:23:58,201 --> 00:23:59,035

240
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:02,172
he gave me a note to give ya.

241
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,946
He said you'd give me two bits.

242
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,256
Thank you ma'am.

243
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:26,096

244
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:27,530

245
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:31,335
I'll find our daughter and
I'll bring her home safely.

246
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:33,571

251
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,034

294
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,129

You're gonna be
pleased with these sir.

314
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,351
You made 10% more

315
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,419

316
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:50,653

Must've been from those...

319
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,959
Cowboys came through on that
cattle drive, you figure?

320
00:29:57,026 --> 00:30:00,363
Yeah, they came
through in bundles.

321
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,231
They were generous.

322
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:02,665
They were generous.

323
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:07,336
Well did you have Doc check
the girls out after they left?

324
00:30:07,403 --> 00:30:09,672
I hope they weren't
too generous.

325
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:11,507

Checked them out sir,

326
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:13,509

327
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:14,510

330
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:26,823

331

00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:35,966
one of them got the
shit beat outta her.

335
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:39,236
This drunk, just stomped her.

336
00:30:39,969 --> 00:30:42,773

351
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:30,754
It won't happen again sir.

352
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:34,623
Something else we
don't abide by...

353
00:31:39,963 --> 00:31:43,634
Trash like you fuckin'

354
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:49,506
Son of a bitch wanted
to hurt my sweetie.

355
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:58,516
Somebody come in here

356
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:16,900
Lookin' for someone mister?

357
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:18,168
Yeah.

358
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:20,603
I got somethin' that
belongs to Rig Marlowe.

359
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:24,342
Haven't seen him all day.

360
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:29,347
Any idea where
I might find him?

361
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,515
Anywhere he can put his
hands on a pretty girl,

362
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:34,552
or a deck of cards.

363
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:39,357
If I see him, who
should I say is callin'?

364
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,360
Chester Alan Arthur.

365
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,500
He a friend of
yours, Mr. President?

366
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:54,471
Never met the man.

367
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:57,674
Just delivering his
property, you say?

368
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:01,411
Yes sir.

369
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:06,682
Spinning Wheel
Saloon, across the way.

370
00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:09,486
You ain't lookin' for
trouble now son, are ya?

371
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,860
You remind me of a young'in
that passed through here,

372
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:19,463
fire in his eyes like yours.

373
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,500
I'm gonna tell you the
same thing I told him.

374
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:26,068
There's a battle in every man.

375
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:29,740
Two wolves that exist
inside each of us.

376
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,777
One's evil and anger,

377
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:36,846
the other's love and hope.

378
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:39,115
You know which one wins?

379
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:42,653
The one you feed.

380
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,101
Which one you gonna feed, Hoss?

381
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:49,986
What can I do ya for?

382
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:51,287
I'm lookin'
for Rig Marlowe.

383
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:53,023
Gent with the red vest,

384
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,124
poker table with
Charlie and Silas.

385
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:56,693
You got
chips at the bar here?

386
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,961

387
00:34:58,028 --> 00:34:58,829
Thank you.

388
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,598
Much obliged.

389
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:05,635
You gentlemen
lookin' for a fourth?

390
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:09,706
If you stop this man
from stealin' our money.

391
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,775
Just a run of luck.

392
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:13,510
Have a seat.

393
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:17,880
Name's Rig Marlowe.

394
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:20,282
This here's Charlie, Silas.

395
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:23,018
Haven't had the privilege
of their surnames yet.

396
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:24,889
Arthur Alan.

397
00:35:25,988 --> 00:35:28,891
Well Arthur with
two first names,

398
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,294
two dollar ante.

399
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,162
You boys
from around here?

400
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:35,666
Ain't nobody from around here.

401
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:39,869
What you have in mind?

402
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:44,006
Well, I'm lookin' for a
little female companionship.

403
00:35:44,073 --> 00:35:46,209
I'm partial to the young ones.

404
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:49,345
All the girls in here...

405
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:51,081
Little long in the tooth.

406
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,316
Well you haven't
even seen 'em all yet.

407
00:35:55,218 --> 00:35:56,853
You just got here.

408
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,555
Five dollars.

409
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:00,289
How many?

410
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:01,890
I'll take one.

411
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:03,193
Two.

412
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,162
Two more.

413
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,867
Let's have a look Silas.

414
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:13,402
Two pair.

415
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,639
Guess you are lucky, Mister.

416
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,340
I mean, at least for me anyway.

417
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:20,644
The Rusty Spur has the
youngest whores in town.

418
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,912
And they don't put a
hole in your pocket.

419
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:24,414
Ain't that the truth?

420
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,850
What about you, Mr. Marlowe?

421
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:29,252
You know anywhere to
find the young ones?

422
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:33,790
Seems like you're lookin'
for a particular girl, Arthur.

423
00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:35,324
Five dollars.

424
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:37,695
They're all particular.

425
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,633
-How many?
-Two.

426
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:45,970
Same here.

427
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:48,104
Ten.

428
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,840
Ten it is.

429
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:55,844
Well well, we find ourselves
in the same predicament.

430
00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:57,347
Marlowe?

431
00:36:57,414 --> 00:37:00,316
You never did answer
me, Mr. Marlowe.

432
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:02,386
About the young ones.

433
00:37:07,023 --> 00:37:08,825
What you got?

434
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:09,893
Full house.

435
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,628
Queens over tens!

436
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:19,336
Silas, woah, woah.

437
00:37:21,438 --> 00:37:24,307
Silas, what the
hell you doin' boy?

438
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:26,776
Funny thing is
I got queens too.

439
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,079
Let's not be hasty, friend.

440
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:31,881
You know this is
the second time today

441
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:34,249
that I counted five queens.

442
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:36,686
-You sure 'bout that?
-Hell yeah.

443
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:40,389
How do we know where
the fifth lady came from?

444
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:41,257
You were the dealer!

445
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,293
That's exactly how I know!

446
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,361
All right, now just
put that gun away,

447
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:48,497
sit down and we'll work
this out peaceful like.

448
00:37:48,564 --> 00:37:50,733
Are you in on this with him?

449
00:37:57,374 --> 00:37:58,875
You son of a bitch!

450
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:00,744
You arrived this
morning from Newton

451
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,013
with my daughter
Lily, Lily Travis!

452
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,815
Now where is she?

453
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:08,352
Where?

454
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:13,356
Shit.

455
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:36,211
Find what you were
lookin' for Hoss?

456
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:37,546
Yeah.

457
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:40,050
And now I'm lookin'
for your boss.

458
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:44,186
That'll be Ty Stover.

459
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:46,289
And where do I find him?

460
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:50,793
Top of the stairs,
first door on the right.

461
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:31,101
You Ty Stover?

462
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,604
Yeah, I'm Ty Stover.

463
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:36,907
I'm lookin' for my daughter.

464
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:39,275
She's 17,

465
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:41,510
got reddish brown hair.

466
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:44,112
Named Lily Travis.

467
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,381
She was walkin' to your saloon

468
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:47,550
this morning with Rig Marlowe.

469
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,456
Haven't seen her.

470
00:39:55,959 --> 00:40:00,063
But I'm in and out
all day, I'm...

471
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,834
Wichita's Fire Chief.

472
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:10,374
Maybe you outta ask Marlowe.

473
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,477
I did.

474
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,180
Well if Marlowe
doesn't know, then...

475
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:21,584
Whoever gave you that
information must be mistaken.

476
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:24,419
It's not that he didn't know,

477
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:26,423
he couldn't tell me.

478
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:31,895
He's dead.

479
00:40:37,032 --> 00:40:39,535
Mr. Travis?

480
00:40:40,302 --> 00:40:41,336
Clay Travis.

481
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:43,438
Mr. Travis.

482
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:45,909
I may run a brothel...

483
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,080
But I run it in
accordance with the law.

484
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,628
Maybe you're right.

485
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:08,497
'Bout my information
bein' wrong.

486
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,472
I apologize for
takin' your time sir.

487
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:19,175
It's quite all right.

488
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:24,046
Close the door.

489
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,235
Have you seen this girl?

490
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:48,303
She's got reddish-brown hair.

491
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:50,139
17 years old.

492
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,276
No, I haven't seen her Sugar.

493
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:11,627
Why are you singin' that song?

494
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:14,463
I heard one of the
girls singin' it today.

495
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,099
Can't seem to get
it outta my head.

496
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:18,935
Was it this girl?

497
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:21,004
Look at the picture.

498
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,338
Was it her?

499
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:25,140
Look at the picture
Darlin', she's my daughter.

500
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:27,010
Have you seen her?

501
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:29,644
Yeah.

502
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:30,746
Yeah, that's her.

503
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,315
Where?

504
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:33,582
Where did you see her?

505
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,284
I don't know.

506
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:36,352
It's my daughter!

507
00:42:41,323 --> 00:42:42,691
Hands off the girl.

508
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:45,628
We don't want no
trouble here Son.

509
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,581
Time for you to
go outside buddy.

510
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,039
Jesus.

511
00:44:49,218 --> 00:44:51,521
You got two seconds to
tell me what I wanna know

512
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,756
before I pump you full of lead.

513
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:56,192
Where is she?

514
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:57,494
Where?

515
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:03,733
Get the hell outta here.

516
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,104
We don't want that
kind of trouble.

517
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,130
I guess we know
which wolf won.

518
00:45:35,264 --> 00:45:38,334
What did you expect?
It's his daughter.

519
00:45:39,535 --> 00:45:42,372
What would you do if someone
disappeared one of your kin?

520
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:47,811
I reckon I'd feed
the same hungry beast.

521
00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:25,840
Son of a bitch!

522
00:47:25,907 --> 00:47:27,976
Where is she?

523
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:30,445
Mr. Travis! You
have to believe me!

524
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:31,980
Where?

525
00:47:32,048 --> 00:47:35,818
When I tell ya that I have
no idea where your daughter is.

526
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:38,287
I don't know what
Marlowe did with her!

527
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,389
Where is she?

528
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:44,860
Fuck you!

529
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:47,997
I should've killed
you in my goddamn bar!

530
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,001
You son of a bitch!

531
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,406
Where is she?

532
00:47:56,472 --> 00:47:58,675
Cut me loose
and I'll tell you!

533
00:48:02,811 --> 00:48:05,347
Cut me loose.

534
00:48:05,414 --> 00:48:07,383
Tell me first!

535
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,421
I traded her!

536
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:13,856
You traded my daughter?

537
00:48:13,923 --> 00:48:14,890
That's
right, I traded her.

538
00:48:14,956 --> 00:48:16,025
Traded her for what?

539
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,961
I traded her for
that fuckin' bell!

540
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:23,032
You traded my daughter
for a goddamn bell?

541
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,534
Yeah. I did.

542
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:27,037
To who?

543
00:48:31,974 --> 00:48:34,044
LaVoie!

544
00:48:36,711 --> 00:48:38,480
Where the hell is he?

545
00:48:40,715 --> 00:48:42,684
He's on a train.

546
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,519
Train to where?

547
00:48:44,586 --> 00:48:46,922
Dodge City.

548
00:48:48,557 --> 00:48:52,927
Now, set me free...

549
00:48:52,994 --> 00:48:55,931
Or you'll die in this town.

550
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,801
You're a dead man.

551
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:59,834
You'll die right here,
you won't ever get out.

552
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:00,970
I'll set you free.

553
00:49:01,037 --> 00:49:03,105
Set me free goddamn it!

554
00:49:03,171 --> 00:49:05,074
Yeah,
I'll set you free!

555
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,698
Train to Dodge?

556
00:49:29,764 --> 00:49:31,934
Train just left.

557
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:38,007
Clay Travis.

558
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,709
Damn, I knew it was you.

559
00:49:41,776 --> 00:49:44,046
You killed five men in Abilene.

560
00:49:45,046 --> 00:49:46,849
Nearly 15 years ago.

561
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:48,918
Yeah.

562
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,053
You killed my best
friend Willie Parker.

563
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,455
Just turned 17.

564
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,158
He drew first.

565
00:49:56,057 --> 00:49:58,427
That ain't what he
told me before he died.

566
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,602
Some men choose
to cast themselves

567
00:50:06,668 --> 00:50:09,605
in a brighter light before
they meet their maker.

568
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:11,974
And Kansas soil's full of fools

569
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:14,443
who thought they were quicker.

570
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:39,767
Ya! Come on!

571
00:50:39,834 --> 00:50:41,736
Come on, come on!

572
00:50:41,803 --> 00:50:44,606
Ain't no damn way he's
gonna catch that train.

573
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,082
Lily?

574
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:03,519
I'm sorry ma'am.

575
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:15,631
Ticket.

576
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:19,001
I didn't have a
chance to buy a ticket.

577
00:52:19,068 --> 00:52:20,736
Five dollars.

578
00:52:20,802 --> 00:52:22,538
Five?

579
00:52:28,677 --> 00:52:30,813
How long does it
take to get to Dodge?

580
00:52:34,215 --> 00:52:36,184
Day's end.

581
00:52:36,251 --> 00:52:38,287
If nothin' goes wrong.

582
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:45,794
What do you got in
that coach back there?

583
00:52:47,162 --> 00:52:48,764
Empty.

584
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:50,633
Like your goddamn head.

585
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,001
Maybe I'll take
a seat back there.

586
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:55,204
Maybe you'll sit your
ass right where you're at.

587
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:56,939
Train's movin'.

588
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:58,841
It's dangerous.

589
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:21,163
Five minutes to Dodge City.

590
00:53:21,229 --> 00:53:22,865
Five minutes.

591
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,997
Hey! Get outta there!

592
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,179
Apples, fresh apples,
two cents a piece.

593
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,949
Three for a nickel.

594
00:54:47,015 --> 00:54:48,684
Apple? Two cents a piece.

595
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:54,256
Apples, fresh apples.

596
00:54:54,322 --> 00:54:56,692
Two cents a piece,
three for a nickel.

597
00:54:57,358 --> 00:54:58,360
Care for an apple sir?

598
00:54:58,427 --> 00:54:59,894
Two cents a piece.

599
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:01,363
Care for an apple sir?

600
00:55:03,097 --> 00:55:04,032
Fresh apples.

601
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:05,834
Two cents a piece.

602
00:55:20,182 --> 00:55:22,118
Mister, are you alive?

603
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,378
Who are you?

604
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:52,047
Name's Girl.

605
00:55:53,615 --> 00:55:55,150
Girl?

606
00:55:56,584 --> 00:55:58,253
They call me Girl 'cause
I'm too ugly to have a name.

607
00:56:04,026 --> 00:56:05,027
Where am I?

608
00:56:05,093 --> 00:56:07,396
Shack. Dodge City.

609
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:15,004
This your sweetheart?

610
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,472
Give me that.

611
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,076
That's my daughter.

612
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:22,445
Right pretty.

613
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,550
You live here by yourself?

614
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:32,888
Me and my Pa.

615
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,256
He's not my real Pa, but...

616
00:56:35,323 --> 00:56:38,927
He was married to my Ma before
she was took by the angels.

617
00:56:38,994 --> 00:56:40,496
Where is he?

618
00:56:41,363 --> 00:56:43,131
Workin'.

619
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:46,301
He'll be home tonight.

620
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:48,503
He always comes
home every night.

621
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:04,887
I gotta use your privy.

622
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:07,122
Out back.

623
00:57:11,392 --> 00:57:14,095
Pa's got the key.

624
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:28,644
This here's silk.

625
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,580
It still smells like my
Mama's lavender scent.

626
00:57:31,646 --> 00:57:34,548
She said she got it from France?

627
00:57:34,615 --> 00:57:35,749
I don't know where that is,

628
00:57:35,816 --> 00:57:37,285
but I know it ain't
anywheres near here.

629
00:57:38,653 --> 00:57:42,057
Europe. France is in Europe.

630
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,961
Know what I made
outta this here silk?

631
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,497
A dress?

632
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:51,166
Why would I waste it on that?

633
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:53,302
I made this fine table covering.

634
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,537
For fancy company.

635
00:57:56,572 --> 00:57:57,539
Well with what you got left,

636
00:57:57,606 --> 00:57:59,374
you should make
yourself a dress,

637
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:01,510
I bet you'd look
real pretty in it.

638
00:58:07,148 --> 00:58:09,183
You got a wife Mr. Clay?

639
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:11,254
Yes I do.

640
00:58:13,689 --> 00:58:16,092
Your ranch very large?

641
00:58:18,293 --> 00:58:20,595
It's big enough.

642
00:58:22,697 --> 00:58:23,932
After you find your daughter,

643
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:26,101
maybe I could go back
to your ranch with you?

644
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:28,436
I'm a real hard
worker and I can cook,

645
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:30,572
and I hardly eat anything.

646
00:58:33,575 --> 00:58:35,243
What about your Pa?

647
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:36,644
Ain't he gonna miss ya?

648
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:39,148
Ain't you gonna miss him?

649
00:58:41,582 --> 00:58:43,952
Well...

650
00:58:51,793 --> 00:58:53,427
Yeah,

651
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:55,997
skin him, cook him up for stew.

652
00:58:56,064 --> 00:58:57,465
Yes Pa.

653
00:58:57,532 --> 00:59:01,335
This food here,

654
00:59:01,403 --> 00:59:03,539
ain't for free, stranger.

655
00:59:04,572 --> 00:59:07,008
I appreciate your
daughter tendin' to me.

656
00:59:07,075 --> 00:59:10,144
I give you my word
I'll repay you.

657
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:14,082
Well we can't eat
promises, now can we?

658
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:18,352
I'm presently lookin'
for my own daughter.

659
00:59:18,419 --> 00:59:21,590
I believe she's been
imprisoned in town as a whore.

660
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:25,126
Tomorrow you give
me a full day's work

661
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:28,529
and then I'll decide
if it's enough.

662
00:59:28,597 --> 00:59:30,265
Time is crucial to me, sir.

663
00:59:30,331 --> 00:59:32,034
I'd appreciate it.

664
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:33,735
Hey!

665
00:59:33,802 --> 00:59:36,137
You can't leave
me shackled here!

666
00:59:36,204 --> 00:59:37,305
Girl!

667
00:59:38,439 --> 00:59:41,043
Give him a pot to
relieve himself with.

668
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:44,612
And you get your ass
in the back room.

669
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:47,283
Now!

670
01:00:40,568 --> 01:00:43,304
Oof! Son of a bitch!

671
01:00:44,238 --> 01:00:46,409
We start work at
sun up 'round here.

672
01:00:56,952 --> 01:01:00,289
I hope you like bacon, eggs
and hot biscuits Mr. Clay.

673
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:06,328
Now what's this?

674
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:08,662
I made a fine table covering

675
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:11,066
outta my mama's silk from Paris.

676
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,468
Paris?

677
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:18,474
This came from your
mama's shack in Abilene.

678
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:23,677
A horny merchant came by and...

679
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:25,846
He exchanged

680
01:01:25,914 --> 01:01:30,151
this red silk for
some afternoon pussy.

681
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,755
You see, her mother was a...

682
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:35,724
Silver dollar whore.

683
01:01:36,825 --> 01:01:40,428
And she deserved every
purple trophy that she got.

684
01:01:40,494 --> 01:01:41,595
You're a rotten liar.

685
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:43,365
Say that again Girl!

686
01:01:44,765 --> 01:01:46,434
Nothing.

687
01:01:53,508 --> 01:01:58,380
I hope we didn't rile
your slumber last night.

688
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:02,317
I mean we, Girl and me,

689
01:02:02,383 --> 01:02:05,887
well we rattled them
floorboards didn't we Girl?

690
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:11,426
You know she got a
face that'll kinda

691
01:02:11,492 --> 01:02:13,594
break a lookin' glass.

692
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:15,397
But thank the Lord.

693
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,401
She got her mama's pussy.

694
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:26,707
This is a feast fit
for the mayor himself.

695
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:32,381
I may have to have you
work two days for me boy.

696
01:02:36,517 --> 01:02:37,887
Damn!

697
01:02:39,287 --> 01:02:41,423
You know how I like my biscuits.

698
01:02:42,657 --> 01:02:45,260
Smothered with honey.

699
01:02:47,963 --> 01:02:50,365
Now you go and
bring me that honey.

700
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:13,188
Unshackle me.

701
01:03:24,999 --> 01:03:27,468
10 dollars I
squirreled away from Pa.

702
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:29,837
Take it Mr. Clay.

703
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:32,341
You'll be needin' it
to find your daughter.

704
01:03:33,608 --> 01:03:35,878
Thank you.

705
01:04:09,977 --> 01:04:13,581
Hey mister, someone's lookin'
for you in the Lady Gay.

706
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:14,716
Who's lookin' for me?

707
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:16,050
Room nine.

708
01:04:16,117 --> 01:04:19,387
You sure you got
the right fella?

709
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:36,371
Hey Sugar, do you wanna poke?

710
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:38,872
I'm lookin' for
room number nine.

711
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,498
Long time.

712
01:05:05,967 --> 01:05:07,970
Nell Craft.

713
01:05:08,736 --> 01:05:10,673
Damn you Clay Travis.

714
01:05:11,972 --> 01:05:13,374
I was hoping you'd
be all scarred

715
01:05:13,441 --> 01:05:15,809
and wrinkled like
a dried-up prune.

716
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:17,878
Been a long time.

717
01:05:17,945 --> 01:05:19,113
You work here?

718
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,715
Not much interest in
a 40-year-old whore.

719
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:23,584
I own the place.

720
01:05:24,084 --> 01:05:25,653
Nell, you look great.

721
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,323
The hell I do.

722
01:05:28,122 --> 01:05:29,923
I wasn't quite
sure how you'd react

723
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,460
if we ever saw each other again.

724
01:05:32,894 --> 01:05:34,863
Likewise.

725
01:05:35,497 --> 01:05:37,999
Is there somethin' I
could've done different Clay?

726
01:05:38,066 --> 01:05:40,735
Anything different
to get you to stay?

727
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:41,803
Nell...

728
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:42,871
Because I believe
I did just about

729
01:05:42,936 --> 01:05:45,006
everything a girl
could possibly do.

730
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:49,544
And then some.

731
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,445
In the end,

732
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:54,416
I guess I just ended up falling
in love with a different...

733
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:55,684
Whore?

734
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:59,787
Different woman.

735
01:05:59,854 --> 01:06:02,956
How is our dear Amelia?

736
01:06:03,023 --> 01:06:04,959
She's out of sorts.

737
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:08,497
For old time's sake...

738
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:12,567
Can I trust you Nell?

739
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:16,037
For old time's sake.

740
01:06:17,706 --> 01:06:19,675
This is our daughter.

741
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,976
Pretty thing.

742
01:06:22,677 --> 01:06:24,445
How old?

743
01:06:24,512 --> 01:06:26,381
She's 17.

744
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:28,783
She arrived this morning,

745
01:06:28,849 --> 01:06:30,985
by train in a cattle car

746
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:32,921
with a few other young girls,

747
01:06:32,988 --> 01:06:35,691
under the gun of a
man named LaVoie.

748
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:39,126
LaVoie recruits new girls.

749
01:06:39,193 --> 01:06:41,729
The demand exceeds
the supply in Dodge.

750
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,401
Where do I find LaVoie?

751
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:49,103
Even you are no
match for LaVoie.

752
01:06:49,169 --> 01:06:52,673
Samuel Colt's been known
to make all men equal.

753
01:06:53,842 --> 01:06:55,642
If he's got your daughter,

754
01:06:55,709 --> 01:06:58,713
she'll never be the same
little girl you remember.

755
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,482
My advice to you?

756
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:01,682
Go home.

757
01:07:01,749 --> 01:07:04,052
Be with your Amelia
and that little boy.

758
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:07,523
I can't do that.

759
01:07:08,122 --> 01:07:10,224
Then stay here with me.

760
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:12,994
Let me show you what
you've been missing.

761
01:07:14,863 --> 01:07:17,166
Where's LaVoie, Nell?

762
01:07:20,668 --> 01:07:23,504
He took possession of a
whore house across the way.

763
01:07:24,104 --> 01:07:26,608
Calls it the French Chateau.

764
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:31,713
Good seein' ya again Nell.

765
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:36,017
Likewise.

766
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:46,595
While you boys are
gallivanting around town,

767
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,197
I need you to gather
me up some strays.

768
01:07:49,264 --> 01:07:50,465
You mean girls?

769
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:53,735
Cats, roans living here
outnumber the whores.

770
01:07:53,802 --> 01:07:55,070
I found me a rat

771
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,905
almost the size of a
beaver this morning, Daddy.

772
01:08:00,008 --> 01:08:01,109
Wasn't Uncle Barkley
supposed to be

773
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:02,777
on the train this morning?

774
01:08:04,178 --> 01:08:06,615
He has some important
business to attend to, son.

775
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:08,617
Now.

776
01:08:10,251 --> 01:08:14,756
My brother has had his shortcomings
in the past, it's true.

777
01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:19,227
But when I left that man
at that depot in Wichita,

778
01:08:19,294 --> 01:08:22,830
he was clear-eyed and sober.

779
01:08:22,897 --> 01:08:24,566
Praise the lord.

780
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,800
Mama always said Uncle Barkley

781
01:08:26,867 --> 01:08:29,571
was gonna find the Lord's hand.

782
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,104
I ain't never been
accused of being

783
01:08:31,171 --> 01:08:33,707
a church-going man
now have I Kipp?

784
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:34,942
No sir.

785
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:36,911
But in this case,

786
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,813
I'm gonna have to align myself

787
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,049
with your Mama.

788
01:08:42,116 --> 01:08:45,719
Because nothin', now
you all listen up,

789
01:08:45,786 --> 01:08:51,058
nothin', and I mean
nothin' in the whole world,

790
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:54,662
is more important than family.

791
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:59,000
A family,

792
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:01,135
in harmony,

793
01:09:01,201 --> 01:09:03,604
will prosper.

794
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:05,706
In everything.

795
01:09:07,008 --> 01:09:09,644
That's an old Chinese proverb.

796
01:09:10,111 --> 01:09:12,613
That's one we
should all live by.

797
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,848
Yeah Daddy.

798
01:09:15,015 --> 01:09:17,184
Bless the Chinese.

799
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:18,786
Come in.

800
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,724
Before you start talkin',

801
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:26,026
I need one of ya to
talk for both of ya,

802
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:27,696
understand?

803
01:09:28,929 --> 01:09:30,865
All us girls got some demands.

804
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:33,968
We want to be treated proper.

805
01:09:34,035 --> 01:09:38,106
Enough sleep so we don't
got darkness under our eyes.

806
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:41,709
A few minutes to
ourselves between turns.

807
01:09:41,776 --> 01:09:43,177
A day off.

808
01:09:43,244 --> 01:09:44,445
Proper doctoring,

809
01:09:44,512 --> 01:09:47,616
not just a quick sideways
glance at our snatch.

810
01:10:13,073 --> 01:10:15,309
Anything else?

811
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,946
That's the gist of it.

812
01:10:45,173 --> 01:10:47,974
Anything else
you wanna discuss?

813
01:10:50,178 --> 01:10:52,313
Now when they ask you,

814
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:55,248
you tell 'em that
whore's snatch went dry,

815
01:10:55,316 --> 01:10:59,120
and she left town to try
her luck in Colorado,

816
01:10:59,187 --> 01:11:00,988
understand?

817
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:04,257
Anything else...

818
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:06,695
You'll end up just like her.

819
01:11:07,128 --> 01:11:08,964
Now get!

820
01:11:25,946 --> 01:11:27,180
Afternoon gents!

821
01:11:27,247 --> 01:11:29,217
Welcome to the French Chateau.

822
01:11:29,284 --> 01:11:31,753
Women to the left,
liquor to the right.

823
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:32,920
Hey.

824
01:11:34,022 --> 01:11:35,357
Afternoon.

825
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,060
Lee Crawford.

826
01:11:39,126 --> 01:11:40,861
But you can call me LaVoie.

827
01:11:47,602 --> 01:11:51,305
Hey Kipp, get this gentleman
here my best glass of whiskey.

828
01:11:51,371 --> 01:11:53,206
Yes Daddy.

829
01:11:53,273 --> 01:11:54,843
That's my son.

830
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:56,544
Welcome.

831
01:11:56,611 --> 01:11:57,845
Good boy.

832
01:11:59,112 --> 01:12:01,282
What brings you out 'round
these parts here, friend?

833
01:12:03,116 --> 01:12:04,385
A girl.

834
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,155
Girl?

835
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:10,792
Well Cowboy, you
in the right place.

836
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,895
Tess!

837
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:15,295
This here Tess.

838
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:20,934
She's awful purdy and young,

839
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:23,037
but I'm lookin' for
somethin' a little different.

840
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:26,140
-Different?
-Different.

841
01:12:28,543 --> 01:12:30,946
Well this one ain't for sale.

842
01:12:32,112 --> 01:12:34,281
But it's your lucky day, Cowboy.

843
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:36,249
We just got a shipment
of young gals,

844
01:12:36,317 --> 01:12:38,219
just ripe and fine
for the plucking.

845
01:12:38,286 --> 01:12:40,388
But they ain't cheap, see that?

846
01:12:41,656 --> 01:12:43,759
Ten dollars.

847
01:12:50,197 --> 01:12:51,499
All right.

848
01:12:51,566 --> 01:12:54,367
Tess, take this fine
gentleman upstairs right now!

849
01:12:54,434 --> 01:12:55,602
And I'm gonna send
a girl up there

850
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:57,906
once they have her all
polished up for you.

851
01:12:58,906 --> 01:13:01,809
All right, I ain't
gonna forget you now.

852
01:13:02,576 --> 01:13:04,945
Hey Kipp, what do you think?

853
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:05,981
I don't like him.

854
01:13:06,046 --> 01:13:07,180
I don't
like him either.

855
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:08,916
I don't like him at all.

856
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:14,921
This way, Honey.

857
01:13:14,988 --> 01:13:17,191
We'll take real
good care of you.

858
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:31,973
Don't worry, the curtains are
for the three dollar whores.

859
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:34,942
You paid for a private room.

860
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:46,454
Don't be nervous Sweetie.

861
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:49,156
We cater to all types here.

862
01:13:49,223 --> 01:13:51,092
The new girl will help you out.

863
01:13:57,165 --> 01:13:58,064
No!

864
01:13:58,131 --> 01:13:59,166
No!

865
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,302
No!

866
01:14:12,679 --> 01:14:14,249
Please.

867
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:17,451
Shut your mouth!

868
01:14:18,518 --> 01:14:21,354
Get up, you son of a bitch!

869
01:14:21,421 --> 01:14:22,555
Pa!

870
01:14:22,622 --> 01:14:24,457
-Hey!
-Go ahead.

871
01:14:24,525 --> 01:14:26,995
I'll put a bullet right
between your eyes.

872
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:29,129
Please help.

873
01:14:30,497 --> 01:14:32,066
Come on Darlin',

874
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:33,235
come on.

875
01:14:34,302 --> 01:14:35,871
Come on now.

876
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:42,243
Jed!

877
01:14:42,309 --> 01:14:43,644
What?

878
01:14:51,486 --> 01:14:53,086
Come on daughter.

879
01:14:53,153 --> 01:14:54,488
Son of a bitch!

880
01:14:57,592 --> 01:14:59,460
Goddamn it, go get him!

881
01:15:09,336 --> 01:15:10,972
Come on, damn it!

882
01:15:16,076 --> 01:15:17,510
Take her outta here!
I'm not leavin' you!

883
01:15:17,577 --> 01:15:19,379
I'm so sorry!

884
01:15:19,446 --> 01:15:20,647
Run!

885
01:15:20,714 --> 01:15:23,616
You better run
little girl, run run run!

886
01:15:23,683 --> 01:15:26,253
Can't have you runnin' off
and stealing the merchandise!

887
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,488
We got a surprise for you today!

888
01:17:10,457 --> 01:17:12,326
What you want Mills?

889
01:17:14,795 --> 01:17:17,365
Telegraph for your father.

890
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:33,648
Get the fuck on!

891
01:18:01,776 --> 01:18:04,345
God, what have I done?

892
01:18:04,411 --> 01:18:05,411
It's all right.

893
01:18:05,478 --> 01:18:07,481
I'm so sorry.

894
01:18:07,548 --> 01:18:08,682
Clay Travis.

895
01:18:08,749 --> 01:18:11,418
I believe you're familiar
with a Nell Craft?

896
01:18:11,485 --> 01:18:12,686
You did her quite an injustice,

897
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:14,688
years back in Abilene.

898
01:18:15,755 --> 01:18:18,291
You neglected to tell me

899
01:18:18,358 --> 01:18:20,827
that you had kinfolk
under my roof Mr. Travis.

900
01:18:20,894 --> 01:18:24,697
I'll pay you whatever you
want to leave my daughter alone.

901
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:28,302
I bet you would!

902
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:29,836
But money ain't an issue.

903
01:18:29,903 --> 01:18:33,308
See, you killed a man,

904
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:35,876
in Wichita.

905
01:18:36,509 --> 01:18:37,811
He drew on me first!

906
01:18:37,878 --> 01:18:39,713
And that man.

907
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:41,381
Was my brother.

908
01:18:47,921 --> 01:18:49,523
You kill my family,

909
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,425
I will have my pound of flesh.

910
01:18:52,492 --> 01:18:54,195
Now I could just put a
bullet in your fuckin' head

911
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:56,597
right now, but why do that?

912
01:18:56,664 --> 01:19:00,268
Why not have some fun, why not?

913
01:19:02,937 --> 01:19:05,573
Blacksmith said this was the
best he could muster up boss.

914
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:06,874
All right, that's good enough.

915
01:19:06,941 --> 01:19:08,910
Tie him up, tie him good.

916
01:19:24,457 --> 01:19:26,260
Hell yeah!

917
01:19:26,861 --> 01:19:28,929
Good fortune done brought
you back here, friend.

918
01:19:28,995 --> 01:19:31,331
But I don't reckon
you'd agree, would ya?

919
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,702
Sir, a lady's causin'
a ruckus downstairs

920
01:19:35,769 --> 01:19:36,836
about the girl you shot.

921
01:19:36,903 --> 01:19:38,371
I don't care!

922
01:19:38,438 --> 01:19:39,307
These women, you
can't live with 'em,

923
01:19:39,372 --> 01:19:40,909
and you can't live without 'em.

924
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:43,009
Now another thing
I took away from

925
01:19:43,076 --> 01:19:45,312
my time with the Chinese...

926
01:19:46,946 --> 01:19:48,882
Gatherin' info.

927
01:19:50,985 --> 01:19:52,320
See, during the war,

928
01:19:52,385 --> 01:19:55,022
say when you're in a position
with some information,

929
01:19:55,089 --> 01:19:56,756
this here done did the trick.

930
01:19:58,858 --> 01:20:01,794
Opened them Union boys right up.

931
01:20:01,862 --> 01:20:04,298
See, this rodent here?

932
01:20:04,365 --> 01:20:06,501
The only thing on
this rodent's mind,

933
01:20:07,535 --> 01:20:10,470
is this here fire, and
how to get away from it.

934
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:13,740
I seen grown men

935
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:15,976
call out for their mamas.

936
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:20,214
Beggin' for a
bullet in the head.

937
01:20:22,482 --> 01:20:24,817
And when that rat realizes
there's no way out,

938
01:20:24,884 --> 01:20:27,420
he's gonna start gnawin'
away at your skin.

939
01:20:27,487 --> 01:20:30,790
He's gonna gradually eat his
way through your insides.

940
01:20:30,857 --> 01:20:34,294
Tears a hole from your
gut through your back.

941
01:20:36,563 --> 01:20:37,697
Yeah.

942
01:20:37,764 --> 01:20:39,566
Now you two, you stay here,

943
01:20:39,633 --> 01:20:43,437
until our little rat friend
here has done his job.

944
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:45,939
And that's when you
can see this table

945
01:20:46,005 --> 01:20:48,776
through his stomach, okay?

946
01:20:48,843 --> 01:20:51,512
And no matter how much he begs,

947
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:54,715
don't put a bullet in him.

948
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,986
Hey! Travis.

949
01:20:59,053 --> 01:21:01,488
I'll be seein' ya friend.

950
01:21:27,447 --> 01:21:30,918
I can abide by
shootin' an unruly whore.

951
01:21:31,619 --> 01:21:35,322
But no man should be
tortured like this.

952
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:38,326
And it's gross.

953
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:46,901
Jed.

954
01:21:47,968 --> 01:21:50,671
Jed, come back.

955
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,094
It doesn't seem right
for her to leave town

956
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:16,663
without saying a word,
she was my friend.

957
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:19,532
Ivory said she heard
gunshots from your office.

958
01:22:19,599 --> 01:22:21,401
Yeah, yeah that's right.

959
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:23,137
Gunshots?

960
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:26,907
Fellas, you and Mills
showin' off your draw.

961
01:22:26,973 --> 01:22:27,740
Right Mills?

962
01:22:27,808 --> 01:22:30,544
Yeah, yeah, that was me!

963
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:32,546
Dumb son of a bitch.

964
01:22:32,612 --> 01:22:33,780
It's not right for her,

965
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:34,948
she would not leave town
without saying a word.

966
01:22:35,014 --> 01:22:38,718
She did express a
very strong desire

967
01:22:38,786 --> 01:22:41,422
to leave Dodge City.

968
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,125
And I obliged.

969
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:49,129
Now, I suspect your
paths will cross...

970
01:22:49,696 --> 01:22:50,963
Again.

971
01:22:51,031 --> 01:22:54,068
Sooner or later.

972
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:56,437
In Colorado, yes?

973
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:01,909
Now either of you got
any other complaints

974
01:23:01,974 --> 01:23:03,876
about how you're being treated?

975
01:23:03,943 --> 01:23:06,046
If you do, you come see me.

976
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,081
And I'll arrange your travel.

977
01:23:09,148 --> 01:23:12,919
Just like I did for Fran.

978
01:23:12,987 --> 01:23:14,855
Now get back on
that goddamn floor

979
01:23:14,921 --> 01:23:17,759
and sell those asses, now!

980
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:20,994
Son of a...

981
01:23:21,061 --> 01:23:22,563
What the hell?

982
01:23:24,798 --> 01:23:25,999
What the hell?

983
01:23:26,066 --> 01:23:27,668
I want him dead!

984
01:23:27,735 --> 01:23:28,768
You know where to look,

985
01:23:28,835 --> 01:23:30,504
go kill that son of a bitch!

986
01:23:32,805 --> 01:23:34,674
Son of a bitch!

987
01:23:38,545 --> 01:23:40,746
Kipp, Jed, get your
asses down here!

988
01:23:40,813 --> 01:23:42,549
Now!

989
01:23:43,884 --> 01:23:44,785
What you need boss?

990
01:23:44,852 --> 01:23:46,086
Yes Daddy?

991
01:24:45,379 --> 01:24:48,616
You killed her, you
killed that poor girl!

992
01:24:52,052 --> 01:24:54,222
Son of a bitch!

993
01:25:06,066 --> 01:25:08,269
You touch my daughter?

994
01:25:10,036 --> 01:25:12,638
I'm gonna send you
straight to hell!

995
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:49,676
Quit hidin' you coward!

996
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,323
Come out here, you chicken shit!

997
01:26:18,237 --> 01:26:20,674
How do you like that?

998
01:26:21,174 --> 01:26:22,742
Shit.

999
01:26:24,244 --> 01:26:25,780
Fuck you!

1000
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:45,298
I'll be damned, Mr. President.

1001
01:26:45,365 --> 01:26:47,702
You caught the damned train.

1002
01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:51,438
I've been thinkin' about
what you said at the Spur.

1003
01:26:51,504 --> 01:26:54,206
Figured you could use a hand.

1004
01:26:54,273 --> 01:26:56,242
Obliged, friend.

1005
01:26:57,143 --> 01:27:00,112
I ain't for anyone
beatin' no women.

1006
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:02,249
One wolf to another,

1007
01:27:02,316 --> 01:27:05,218
I reckon I'd done
the same thing.

1008
01:27:05,285 --> 01:27:07,220
And if it was my daughter,

1009
01:27:07,286 --> 01:27:09,990
I'd kill that son
of a bitch dead.

1010
01:27:13,093 --> 01:27:15,729
Now go get the son of a bitch.

1011
01:27:24,204 --> 01:27:25,205
Come upstairs with me?

1012
01:27:27,107 --> 01:27:28,375
I'm just here for whiskey,

1013
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:30,077
I'm not armed, I'm not armed.

1014
01:27:30,143 --> 01:27:32,379
Somebody's
shootin' downstairs!

1015
01:27:39,018 --> 01:27:40,655
Where's he at?

1016
01:27:42,054 --> 01:27:43,322
Drop it, drop it!

1017
01:27:43,389 --> 01:27:45,057
-Easy.
-Where is she?

1018
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:46,293
She ain't here.

1019
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,862
Lips or lead boy,
you're gonna show me.

1020
01:27:48,929 --> 01:27:49,996
You're gonna show me!

1021
01:27:50,062 --> 01:27:52,031
You son of a bitch.

1022
01:27:52,098 --> 01:27:53,165
Behind you!

1023
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:05,012
Son of a bitch!

1024
01:28:15,455 --> 01:28:17,758
Where's my daughter?

1025
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:24,964
Kipp!

1026
01:28:29,503 --> 01:28:32,205
I'm not askin' again.

1027
01:28:36,442 --> 01:28:38,978
I ain't afraid
to meet my maker.

1028
01:28:41,615 --> 01:28:42,883
Family?

1029
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:46,487
When one piece is missin',
whole thing's broken.

1030
01:28:48,287 --> 01:28:49,923
You broke mine!

1031
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:52,159
You know what
this was gonna be?

1032
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:54,193
This was gonna be
the best goddamn

1033
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:57,897
whore house west
of the Mississippi.

1034
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:02,235
And your daughter's pussy

1035
01:29:02,302 --> 01:29:04,405
was gonna buy me a couple farms.

1036
01:29:05,906 --> 01:29:07,941
Open your mouth!

1037
01:29:08,008 --> 01:29:09,744
Open!

1038
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,880
Bite down on the barrel.

1039
01:29:27,059 --> 01:29:30,430
Now someone tell me
where my daughter is.

1040
01:29:52,652 --> 01:29:55,522
Ain't no trains
for a good minute.

1041
01:29:56,423 --> 01:29:58,325
No sir.

1042
01:29:58,392 --> 01:30:01,061
Long ways back
where you come from.

1043
01:30:02,094 --> 01:30:03,530
Yes sir.

1044
01:30:04,964 --> 01:30:07,901
Longer still on
your own two feet.

1045
01:30:10,202 --> 01:30:12,572
Reckon you could use a horse.

1046
01:30:14,206 --> 01:30:16,442
I reckon I got a horse.

1047
01:30:17,177 --> 01:30:18,912
What will you do?

1048
01:30:20,613 --> 01:30:22,982
Reckon I'll go
somewhere quiet,

1049
01:30:23,049 --> 01:30:27,053
put my feet up and
retire these here boots.

1050
01:30:29,289 --> 01:30:31,957
It's been a long road,

1051
01:30:32,025 --> 01:30:33,960
and I'm tired.

1052
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:37,597
But I'll find my way home.

1053
01:30:41,268 --> 01:30:43,604
Take care friend.

1054
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:22,509
Pa, who was that man?

1055
01:31:22,576 --> 01:31:25,880
He's just
an old friend.

1056
01:32:08,054 --> 01:32:09,656
Ma!

1057
01:32:11,424 --> 01:32:13,026
Ma?

1058
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:19,566
Ma?

1059
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:25,939
Ma!

1060
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:31,211
Maybe she's in the barn?

1061
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,776
Lily!

1062
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,378
Wait!

1063
01:33:39,446 --> 01:33:41,215
Lily!
