you spread it.

You spread it
and then you fuck it.

What up?
Dude, you gotta
see this, dude.

177

Okay, okay.
You have to see this.

Oh, hey, man.

What's up, dude?
You live here, too?

00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:36,321
Neat. This is Redge,
over here. He owns the place.

sleep on the floor.

Cool, thanks, man,
I appreciate it.

186
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,931
Yeah, man,
no problem, just,

187
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,767
the toilet doesn't work
so you've gotta pee-pee
in the sink

and poo-poo at 7-Eleven.

189
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,102
Fantastic.

That was fun.
What was that?

It's air sex.

what air sex...

laying on the ground
being sixty-nined,

should do a ghost routine.
Listen, okay, that's fine,

a ghost, we have to
introduce in the first act,

that you're fucking a ghost.

of free alcohol.

coming out of it

with that sometimes."

little microwave.

No.
Is hairy?

No.

in the past tense.

But it doesn't mean
you can't still bang some
strange this evening, buddy.

339
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,404
Okay, yeah. It's been
a long time

340
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,706
since you entered
the field of battle,

341
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,574
that's true.
Uh-huh.

342
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,509
And you're worried
about hatching out
of your shell

343
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,877
before you're
fully incubated.

344
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,545

they're disgusting.

That's not
gonna be an issue,

346
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,516
because I'm gonna give
you a couple of arrows
to put into your quiver.

Okay.

I'm just assuming
that you...
Follow me here, Stan.

350
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,890
Girls guard the vagina.

351
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:19,924
Yeah, they guard it
with their life.

352
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,760
Okay? So we have
to guard the penis.

353
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,196
Oh, okay.

you know?

355

He doesn't like them,
so we're not
gonna use metaphors.

Stan?

357
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,870
You've gotta let them know
they can't have this.

358
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,374
Because people always want
what they can't have.
What they can't have...

359
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,710

So, you've gotta be
an asshole!

360
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,213
Yeah, but not
a giant asshole.
Right.

361
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,548
You can't be
an unfuckable asshole,

362
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,749
you have
to be discreet.

363
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,618
You have to
say things to women

364
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,754

nice at first...
Very discreet.

365
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:52,356
Right. They appear
nice, but really,
they're kind of mean.

382

Okay, so,
for example, um...

383
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,824
You would say something
like, "That's a beautiful
dress you have on,

384
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,626
"it really makes
your ass look small."

385
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,728

"You're a fat ass,

"but you're really
not that big."

a beauty mark,

388

"or do you just have
some shit on your face?"

389
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:10,801
That's really good.

390
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,337
That's really...
Can I use that?

391
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,373
Yeah, of course.
That's a good line.

392
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,942
Essentially, what
we're doing, Stan,

393
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,910
is we're lowering
their self-esteem

394
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,312
so that then
they look to us
for validation

395
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,381
and we can...

396
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:28,519
you tell girls they're
ugly so they'll want
to have sex with you.

397

That's awesome. Hi!

686
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,357
Hold this, please.

687
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,392
Hello, ladies.

688
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,661
How you doing?

689
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,631
Hey, I just wanna say
I thought that you did
absolutely incredible.

690
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,399
Whatever, Dinocock.
Fuck off.

691
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,567
Uh. I am not kidding.
I'm not kidding.

692
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,937
I'm just on our
way out, so...

693
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:18,909
Oh, well, if we would
have had your candy-ass
cheerleaders

694
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,510
on our side then
maybe we would have.

695
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,878
Okay, can I speak with
you for a second?

696
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,480
No, no.

697
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,382
Um, yeah.
No, no.

698
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,716
Okay.
Seriously?

699
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,251
Hey, nice to meet you.

700
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:29,519
Nice to meet you.

701
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,687
Yeah, you, too.
Yeah. Okay.

702
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,324
How do you do it?

703
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,227
What?
How do you do the splits?

704
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,697
Oh! Um...

705
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,199
Drill team.
Drill team?

706
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,800
Yeah.
Okay.

707
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,435
Can you, um...
Can you teach me?

708
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:46,870
What?

709
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,539
Those teabags are
looking at us.

710
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,647
Oh!

711
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,683
It's on, bro.

712
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:00,483
Oh, hell yeah,
it's on, bro.

713
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:03,954
Is there something
on my face?

714
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:05,455
No.

715
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:06,790
It's just beautiful.

716
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:09,659
Oh!

717
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,397
We don't need
you all to be doing
no pornos in here.

718
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,266
We are so sorry.

719
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:18,435
He might have had
a few too many
drinks this evening.

720
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:20,737
This is a family place.

721
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,905
We completely understand.

722
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,811
Nicely done, guys.

723
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:30,447
Oh, God. What?
Are you serious?
Perfect.

724
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:31,748
Deal's a deal.

725
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,717
Of course, I'm serious.
You know, I'm...

726
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,385
Come on, Timmy, you're
not the boss of me.

727
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:36,786
Leave the girl alone.

728
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,288
All right, all right.
Let's go home.

729
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,356
All right. Whatever.
All right?

730
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,858
Yes.

731
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,560
No, no.
No, she said yes. Dude!

732
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,562
All right, out the door.

733
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:47,530
Ladies, we'll be outside.
This is...

734
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:48,732
Just let me go.
I know.

735
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,838
Are you...
That little weirdo's dick
is fucking enormous.

736
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,640
I don't care if it's
six feet long.

737
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:58,008
You're just gonna
leave me here?

738
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,311
I'm leaving you with
the "Midnight Cowboy".

739
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:03,947
And I am taking
one for the team.

740
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,683
This isn't college anymore.

741
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,752
Pretend.

742
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,688
You are getting horny.

743
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,457
Very horny.

744
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,926
Have fun.

745
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:17,961
I will if you will.

746
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,598
Cool, bro.
All right, let him go.

747
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,634
Ah!

748
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,935
Hey.

749
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:29,306
Oh, God. Oh, my...

750
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:30,740
Bye, Katie.
I did this for you.

751
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:31,741
It's Cathy.

752
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:35,779
Where are they?

753
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,482
I don't see 'em
and they were
following us, right?

754
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,617
Jeff, they were
following us, yeah?

755
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:41,418
They will be here.

756
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,324
Stan?
Hmm?

757
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,491
What are you doing?

758
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,659
Nothing.

759

(WHINING)

760
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:53,496
My name is Stan.
I made a mistake
and I want you back.

761
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,767
That was an excellent
impersonation of me.

762
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,669
That was... It was like
looking in a mirror.

763
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,838
Here they come.

764
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,740
Here they come.
Yes.

765
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:04,641
It's all right.
Bring it on, ladies.
Bring it in.

766
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,777
REDGE: Come on, right here.

767
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,346
Maybe I wasn't even thinking
about her just now, dude.

768
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,348
Maybe I was thinking
about another girl.

769
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,049
Like, maybe a girl
I met tonight.

770
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,518
I don't know, maybe she
gave me her number.

771
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:17,787
Why are you just telling
me this just now?

772
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,757
Well, suddenly
you're interested.

773
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,058
Did you tell her that she
had shit on her face?

774
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,893
No, she did
that to me.

775
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,096
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

776
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,697
What are you doing here with
your dick in your pants?

777
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,898
You should have your dick
in her mouth, buddy.

778
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,066
Come on, this is good.

779
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,501
This is good.

780
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,502
I love this.

781
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,137
Very good.

782
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:37,507
I will take you...
Oh, yes. I will take you.

783
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,442
You wanna do that?
Okay, let's do...

784
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,577
Mule train?
No, I'm all right.

785
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,778
Okay, okay. Well...
No thanks.

786

(ALL CHATTERING)

787
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,452
Okay.

788
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,021
So, Stan,

789
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:55,091
there are four guys and
three girls and you have a
phone number in your pocket.

790
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,127
I think you need to
make a phone call.

791
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:58,595
Now...
You got a short window, buddy,
you need to lay some track.

792
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,430
I don't...

793
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,066
Hello.
Ooh!

794
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,041
I don't... I think
I'm just gonna text,
dude, right?

795
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,877
Probably texting
is better at this
stage 'cause,

796
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:15,845
you know...

797
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,715
Oh, I wish I had her email.

That's been broken
for a while.

00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:29,012
Oh, yeah.

805
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:30,280
There's a 7-Eleven
I could walk you to
to finish your business.

806
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:32,982
Come here.

807
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,719
I think that something
is moving in there.

808
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,154
You should see
the bathroom,
totally gross.

809
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:39,989
What's she doing?

810
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,091

Breathing, that's not
gonna be an issue

from that angle.

become a vet?

in the Marines.

Yeah. Bomb sniffing
dogs, just kinda...

Just like fell
into it.

You were in
the Marines?

860
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:51,921
Yeah, yeah. But the
dogs started making
better conversations

861
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:54,090
than some of those
jarheads I was
working with.

862
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:55,992
Right.
So I had to get out of
there as fast as I could.

863
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:58,061
So, that makes
you like a...

A vet vet.

865
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:02,865
Yes.

866
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:04,367
Yes, it does.

867
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,704
Wow.

868
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:08,304
I had fun tonight.

869
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,306
Yeah, I did, too.

870
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,378
Well, let's
do it again.

871
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,347
Thank you for the dance.

872
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:19,916
Thank you

873
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,820

REDGE: Oh, come on,
I don't hear anything.

875
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:26,856
Hey, guys.
How's it going?

876
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,124
You guys hear anything
in there, I don't think
they're fucking.

877
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:29,292
Oh, hey, dude.

878
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,294
Hey, they're not fucking.

879
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,963
I didn't give up my room
for you guys not to fuck.

880
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:34,964
Let's go.
It's just really gross here.

881
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,934
It's like so gross.

882
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,202
I can't get the keys
because she's got them
in there with that creep.

883
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,737
Hey, I got brews here
if you wanna...

884
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,371
No, I'm all right.
No, no, you have them.

What is it?

887
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,252
Is it real?

888
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,155
Is it from the internet?

889
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:01,057
I mean, have you seen
a penis this big before?

890
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:02,158
Could you put
that away, please?

891

If you don't get out
of the bedroom right now,
we're leaving!

894
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,869
Hey, um...

895
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,037
Can I take you to
breakfast in the morning?
What?

896
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,472
No, I wanna take you
to my Saturday place.
Please, please, please.

897
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:21,310
I love talking to you so
much so I just want to keep
this conversation going on.

898
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,945
Uh.
Please?

899
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:23,980
I'll think about it.
Okay.

900
00:46:23,982 --> 00:46:26,516
Do you like migas?

901
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:27,483
Hey, beautiful, don't
knock so hard.
Fuck off.

902
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:29,051
It was... So sorry.

903
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,853
Yeah. Oh, yeah,
I bet you're sorry.

904
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:33,022
I wanna get the fuck
out of here.

905

Hey, honey,
I think I see
something on your face

906
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:35,424
Don't touch me!

907
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:38,361
What the fuck
just happened?

908
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,231
I thought I got her wet...

909
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,133
I think she loved you.
I was clear on that.

910
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:44,834
Yeah, that was well played.

911
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,208
Yeah?

912
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,544
Captain fucker, you were only
in there for seven minutes.

913

Where are you going?

917

El Azteca.

918
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:41,157
El Azteca?

919

You wanna wait
for me, man?

920
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,333
Mmm.
This is so good.

921
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:52,034
You cannot find migas
like this in New York.

922
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,302
Ugh!

923
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:55,438
Why did you let
me drink so much?

924
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,576
So, what happened
with Ralphie?

925
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,545
We tried.

926
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,146
I threw up.

927
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:05,948
All over his face.

928
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,085
Oh, God, Kara.

929
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:10,353
And he actually wanted
to keep going.

930
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,088
Can you believe that?

931
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,492
Puke all over his
face and he's like,

(IN A DEEP VOICE)
"I don't mind."

933
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,364
You always get
the normal ones.

934
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:35,511
Okay.

935
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,247
You ready?

936
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,482
For breakfast?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Yeah.

937

Okay.

939

Okay.

940

Speaking of which,
did you guys do it?

941
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,562
No.

942
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:55,097
Why not?
Because I'm not...

943
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,266
Like me?

944
00:48:59,069 --> 00:48:59,702
I didn't say that.

945
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,640
Yeah, it's okay.
If it wasn't for sluts no
one would get laid, right?

person in this situation.

No. What...
What situation?

He's here.

952
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,125
He just came
through the door.

953

Oh, shit.
Be strong.

I'm gonna go say hi to
a friend over there.
Okay.

958
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:38,107
And I will be right back.

959
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:40,509
If I turn around and he
is with some whore...
Just be strong, Kara.

fucking place to the ground.

Breathe.

962

Hey!
Take the knives.

taken up photography.

here to buy you breakfast.

that you've bought breakfast

you slept with last night.

Yeah. You know,
she looks really familiar.

I'm sorry.

up in my clothes, too?

like your clothes.

didn't look like you.

looks like me.

00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:03,879
Yeah.

1042
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:06,815
Delete on three.

1043
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:08,951
One.

1044
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:10,753
Two.

1045
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,555
Three.

1046
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:24,800
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

1047
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:31,540
You know what, that...

1048
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,243
I think that actually
feels good.

1049
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:44,720
You okay?

1050
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,829
She drinks my cum, man.

1051
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,400
She actually likes it.

1052
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,310
Where am I gonna
find somebody who's
that cool ever again?

1053
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:12,715
It's...

1054
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:16,952
No. Yeah, that's
really cool of her.

1055
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,256
(ENGINE STARTS)

1056
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,757
Yep. Okay. We're moving on.

1057
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,826
We're moving on up,
like the mother-fucking

1058
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:25,394
Jeffersons.

1059
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:29,798
Okay, men.

1060
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,899
REDGE: Yeah, let's
get fucked up.

1061
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:33,402
We are not leaving
this apartment

1062
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:36,505
till we come up with
an air sex routine
that is so depraved

1063
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:39,341
and so sick that we will
be ashamed to look our
own mothers in the eye

1064
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:42,278
for another year.

1065
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,546
TIM: (ON PHONE) <i> Maybe this</i>
<i>is a coincidence, but I was</i>
<i>just sitting here thinking,</i>

1066
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:45,714
<i>"What am I gonna do</i>
<i>for dinner tonight?"</i>

1067
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,686
That sounds like
fate to me.

1068
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:54,056
<i>Well, I was probably</i>
<i>just gonna microwave</i>
<i>this gas station burrito.</i>

1069
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:56,692
<i>Setting the timer now,</i>
<i>but I'm thinking between</i>
<i>the two of us,</i>

1070
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:58,060
<i>we could come up with</i>
<i>something better</i>
<i>than that, right?</i>

1071
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:00,462
Right.
<i>I'll come by around</i>
<i>eight, okay?</i>

1072
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,463
Okay, bye.

1073
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,533
Oh, my God.

1074
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,335
Oh, that voice.

1075
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:07,703
I may have to wring
out my panties.

1076
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:09,905
Kara, what am I doing?

1077
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:12,041
What do you mean?
You're moving on up,

1078
00:55:12,043 --> 00:55:13,876
like the mother-fucking
Jeffersons.

1079
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:17,546
Okay, guys, you know what
we're gonna do tonight?

1080
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:19,481
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna break free.

1081
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,017
We're gonna break free
from their petty needling.

1082
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,853
We're gonna break free
from their impossibly
high expectations,

1083
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,789
and their fucking harassment

1084
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:28,590
about what lamp is
gonna look better
in that corner.

1085
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:30,392
Fuck that corner.

1086
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:32,661
Fuck that corner.
Guys, I really need
you on my team

1087
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,096
and I feel great
about tonight.
Can we do this together?

1088
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:34,797
REDGE: Yeah.
JOE: Yeah.

1089
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:38,801
Stan, am I bothering you?
Nope.

1090
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,838
Who are you texting?
Nobody.

1091
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,039
Hey!
Is it someone with a vagina?

1092
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:44,807
Nope. Let's do this.

1093
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,810
Let's fuck the air.

1094
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:49,845
Yeah, you must fuck the air.

1095
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,647
ALL: You must fuck the air!

1096
00:55:51,649 --> 00:55:52,815
ALL: You must fuck the air!

1097
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,685
You are a miracle worker.

1098
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,053
Mmm-hmm.
I've got boobs.

1099
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,691
Normally, it's just like two

1100
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,992
sensitive freckles.

1101
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:06,428
(BELL RINGS)
Ooh! I'll get it.

1102
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,529
Help! Help!
Oh, what?

1103
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,532
Now, listen, okay.

1104
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,034
Be careful.
Careful?

1105
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,403
Yeah, if his dick is as
big as his brother's,

1106
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:15,838
you will be coming home
in a hospital gurney.

1107
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,473
Oh, that sounds fun.

1108
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:20,576
Okay, I put condoms
in your bag.
Kara!

1109
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,544
What? Don't be
afraid to say yes.

1110
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,480
No, no. I'm going
home tomorrow.

1111
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:26,415
I can't leave you
alone tonight.

1112
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:26,982
Who says I'm gonna be alone?

1113
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,052
Not Ralphie?

1114
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,054
KARA: No, barf-boy,
are you fucking kidding me?

1115
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,757
Hello. Welcome.
TIM: Hello. Thank you.

1116
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:37,726
Come in. Come in. O-M-G.

1117
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,863
Hi. How you doing?
He brought flowers.
Are you from this century?

1118
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:42,831
You totally didn't
need to do this.

1119
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:47,870
See, I did bring flowers,
but they're not for you,
they're for you.

1120
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:49,438
I'm sorry. I would have got
you flowers, but I didn't.

1121
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,038
Oh, um...

1122
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,141
(CATHY LAUGHS)

1123
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:55,778
It's not funny.
No, it is.

1124
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,147
Yeah. He had a moment
the other night,

1125
00:56:58,149 --> 00:56:59,148
but he's a real sweet guy.
What?

1126
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,983
Right.

1127
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:02,050
Okay!
Bye.

1128
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:03,619
Bye-bye.

1129
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:04,520
All right. All right.
You ready to go?

1130
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:05,754
Bye, Kara.

1131
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:06,855
Be safe.

1132
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,792
Yes. Yes.
We will. We will.

1133
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:11,460
Good night.
Goodbye.

1134
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,063
Ugh!

1135
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:20,569
So, the Marines...

1136
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:22,104
That's...

1137
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:22,805
Yeah.
Yeah.

1138
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:28,444
So, um...

1139
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,946
Did you ever...

1140
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,215
Go to war, shoot
someone, get stabbed?

1141
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:35,217
Oh, does everybody
ask you that?

1142
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,452
All the time. Yeah.

1143
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:37,486
So sorry.

1144
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,154
You should be.

1145
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,760
So, did you?

1146
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:45,661
You didn't notice
my wooden leg?

1147
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,899
No, I took some shrapnel

1148
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,636
to the shoulder.

1149
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,206
Wall exploded and piece
of pipe lodged in there.

1150
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,041
Had to cut it out.

1151
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,642
Oh, my God!

1152
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:01,477
Yeah.

1153
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,779
It sounds worse
than it was but...

1154
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,019
Can I see it?

1155
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,124
Like, now?

1156
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:17,759
Yeah.

1157
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:19,061
Seriously?
Absolutely.

1158
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:20,896
I... We were, um...

1159
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:22,564
We're studying

1160
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,068
wound care in
class right now

1161
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,704
and it would be highly,
highly educational.

1162
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,207
I think they're
gonna let us in.

1163
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:34,610
Okay, people.

1164
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:37,646
The air sex finals
are beyond sold out.

So,

1167
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:46,922
we're gonna seat
the finalists
and their guests first.

1168
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:48,557
So, when I call your name
you can go on in.

REDGE: I'm a little worried
'cause they've got vaginas,

1174
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:08,076
and that always gives you
the upper hand.

1175

Nazi Assfucker.

1176
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:15,784
You know that girl
I met here, uh,

1177
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:18,020
she's playing a show nearby.
She's been texting me.

(CHEERING)

1183
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:28,864
So, you're gonna
bail on me again.

1184
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,067

bailing on you...

1186

I'm going to hang
out with a girl.

1187
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,073
Isn't that what you
want me to do

1188
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,576
this weekend, right?
Isn't that the whole...

1189
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:42,110
Yeah.
You really need me
here for this?

1190
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:45,013
You're right.
Go, go. Yeah.

1191
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:47,916
Fuck her in the butt.
Okay, so you're going to hold
this against me, really?

1192
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:48,917
Why is it so
important to you?

1193
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:52,888
Yeah, because everything
in my life is going so
incredibly right now, dude.

1194
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,623
I'm fucking sleeping
on a couch

in a corpse.

Beverly Hills making
my dreams come true.

Making my... Right.
I'm fucking working at
a pizza parlor in Pasadena.

1198
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:04,266
So, then you went out there
for no reason. That's...

1199
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,301
I moved, dude.

1200
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:08,303
I don't know why you're
taking it so personally.

1201
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:11,206
Because ever since you
broke up with Cathy,

1202
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,609
you broke us all up.
Things have never been the
same between me and Kara...

1203
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:14,376
That's my fault?
...since you left.

1204

Dude, I'm responsible
for my own fucked up
relationships, not yours.

Right, okay.

fucked up friendships?

You know, and another...
If this is all, like weird
for you, it makes...

1208

You know, you don't approve
of this, you can ignore me.

awesome at it.

I don't care, but you gotta
get her off the phone
with my girlfriend,

1543
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:39,033
because she's blocking me
from getting the pussy
that I deserve.

1544
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:40,167
KARA: Deserve?
Shut up.

1545
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,535
Fuck you!
Shut up!

1546
01:20:41,537 --> 01:20:43,237
Wait, she's on the phone
with Kara, right now?

1547
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:44,505

<i>to each other.</i>

1550
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:54,515
Guys, talk.
Use your words,
please, go.

either belong together
or you don't,

1553

but this
wishy-washy-in-between
shit has gotta go.

1554
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,364
Actually, Stan, I know
what you should do. Listen,

1555
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:12,933
there's edible underwear
in the medicine cabinet
at Redge's house.

1556
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:14,869
The red ones taste terrible,
but the other...
How do you know that?

JEFF: <i> Because, we were stoned</i>
<i>and we had no food</i>

1558
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:19,440
Just shut up, shut up.
Or...

1559
01:21:19,442 --> 01:21:21,275
Forgive each other
for ruining
a great relationship

1560
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:23,944
<i>and move on.</i>
<i>Either way we love you.</i>

1561
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:27,248
Stan, for bailing on me
because I was incredible
on stage tonight.

1562
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,016
Oh, I fucking
destroyed you!
Everybody knows that...

1563

really that small?

Honestly?

1581
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:17,484
I love it.

1582
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:25,259
And what about

1583
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:27,094
my cavern?

1584
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:32,366
It's like
a little child's.

01:24:32,368 --> 01:24:34,134
Better not know
what that fucking
feels like, you pedo.

1586
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,106
I was complimenting
your vagina.

1587

I said a nice thing.

1588
01:24:42,812 --> 01:24:44,244

in the fucking ear
with a chip.

Just give me two minutes,
I can take you.

heard you, um...

Nope, we did not.

1599
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:25,185

We did not talk at all.

I'm sorry, dude.

It's no problem.

I'm actually very surprised
to see you in pants
this early.

last night, huh?

a good cuddler.
What are you doing?

Get off me!
You're not doing it right.

you do that.
