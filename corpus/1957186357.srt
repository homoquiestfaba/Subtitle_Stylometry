Do you...

7
00:00:57,203 --> 00:01:00,506
Do you not know that your bodies

8
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,442
are temples of the holy spirit?

9
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:08,247
Who is in you.
[eerie music]

10
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,817
Whom you have received from God.

11
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:16,624
You, [clears throat] you are not
your own.

12
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:22,696
You were bought, you
were bought at a price.

13
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,866
Therefore, honor God with your

14
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,703
There will be terrible
times in the last days.

15
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:33,874
People will be lovers of

Abusive.

Treacherous, rash, conceited.

Lovers of- lovers of-

21
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:49,155
Lovers of pleasure rather
than lovers of God.

22
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:53,326
Having a form of Godliness
but denying its power

23
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:57,330
Have nothing- have nothing
to do with such people.

24
00:01:57,363 --> 00:02:01,234
They are the kinds [clears

[Narrator] Sordico, the genus
purpiceps.

52
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,627
The dark-purplish buds
on this head of wheat

53
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:17,396
are the so-called sclerotia of
sordico,

54
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:19,833
from the genus purpiceps.

55
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,539
This indicates the beginning
of the sexual stage...

00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:30,611
[motorcycle engine roars]

57
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:33,080
Once winter is over,
the sordico will sprout

58
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,182
to mushroom-like structures,

59
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,751
which will create the sexual
spore stage,

60
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:42,421
which takes place throughout
the spring season.

61
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:45,993
This stage will be discharged

62
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:48,494
from the fruit bodies
by the fungus and dicem-

00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:52,132

- [Narrator] After the
infection takes hold,

72
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:18,424
the asexual spore stage is
created.

73
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,828
This is called the purpolia
stage,

74
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:27,701
which creates its spores in a
honeydew-

75
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,037
- A fucking chance!
[tense music]

76
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,139

[Narrator] Poisoning,
caused by sordico of wheat

79
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,248
is referred to as sordicism.

80
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,917
There are two types of
symptoms that can occur

81
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:45,518
in cases of serious poisoning.

[Driver] I've got a purpose.

00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:51,625
[Narrator] Gangrenous
sordicism

85
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:54,194
is common in grazing farm
animals.

86
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,931
It causes gangrene to
occur by constricting

87
00:06:57,965 --> 00:07:00,466
the blood vessels that
lead to the extremities.

88
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:04,071
Convulsive sordicism is
characterized

89
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,139
by disfunction within the
nervous system,

90
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,911
where the animal twists and
contorts its body in pain.

91
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:15,949
Trembling and shaking.
[driver whispers]

92
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:20,954
Typically, when a bovid
becomes infected by sordico,

93
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:22,521
it must be put down,

94
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,892
and the entire crops from
that season destroyed.

95
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:38,271
Symptoms of gangrenous
and convulsive sordicism

96
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:42,009
can occur in varying degrees
in any animal or human

97
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:44,778
who has consumed sordico.

98
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,749
In the Middle Ages, unaware of
the risks,

99
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,185
the common folk of Europe
rarely made the effort

100
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,087
to remove the sordico from the
wheat,

101
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:58,058
so the fungal wheat flour was
often baked into the bread.

102
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,629
There are extensive accounts
of these ignorant peasants

103
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:05,032
suffering from burning
sensations in their limbs,

104
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,533
amputations due to gangrene,

105
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,971
dizziness, nausea, and,

106
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:16,977
if consumed over a long period
of time, gradual insanity.

107
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:23,250
These symptoms were titled Godly
flames,

108
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:29,256
as many considered them
a punishment from God.

109
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:33,026
A tribulation for the sins of
the people.

110
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,729

113
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:07,727
[Sam] The fucking GPS lost
service.

114
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:08,762
[Rylie] Did you mess with it?

115
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:10,063
[Sam] What do you
mean, did I mess with it?

116
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:10,931
[Rylie] What are you doing?

117
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:12,732
[Sam] I think one of the tires
is low.

118
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,868
- The tires don't feel low.
- Just shh.

119
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,236
[Woman] It's not
supposed to lose direction

120
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,704
where there's no signal.

121
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:18,638
Did you touch it?

122
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:20,640
[sighs]

123
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,742
It's literally like two
and a half minutes away.

124
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:24,911
I'll get us there without GPS.

- On the bike.

00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:30,016
[Woman] What the fuck?

128
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:32,853
[Actor] I'm gonna
ask him for directions.

129
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:33,920
[Woman] Sam, no.

130
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:35,822

to Albuquerque to get fucked.

Hey, Jim.

153
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,040
Remember that night in Vegas,

154
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:38,979
when we met those two broads at
Caesar's?

155
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,548
Well, there's something I never
told you.

Hey, Jim.

I'm sorry and please pardon my
French,

but I just get nervous around
cool guys,

168
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:23,651
and when I got on that plane, I
just-

169
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:25,085
- You hate me.

170
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:26,252
Hm?

171
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,221
I've just been crazy
pre-occupied.

172
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,522
It's fine.

I swear, it's fine.

Yes.

I 100% don't hate you, it's
totally fine.

We're both distracted right now.

[distant owl hoots]

184
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,991
Hell of a haunch.

185
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,493
Thanks to you.

186
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,261
Yeah, that's what eating raw

187
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,964
and burning 35,000 calories
a month will get you.

188
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,999
Yeah, that and a stomach full
of acid.

189
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:15,435
Did you take your-

190
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,070
- Yes!
- All right.

191
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:26,546
[Sam] Ow, what the fuck,
Rylie?

192
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,247
Sorry!

193
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,416
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry!

194
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:32,118
[engine roars]

195
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,963
Hello?

196
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:44,964
Hello?

197
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:56,142
- Hello?
- Hello?

198
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,013
[Man] Anybody home?

199
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:02,315
Yeah, what the-

200
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:03,516
- Shh.

201
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,251
Yeah, who is, who's there?

202
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,622
[Man] Sorry if I scared ya.

203
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:09,690
Can we help you?

204
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:14,695
[Man] You're on my property.

205
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:24,237
[Rylie sighs]

206
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,513
Oh, great.

[zipper unfastens]

209
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:53,634
Sorry if I scared ya!

210
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:57,070
[Rylie] This is your property?

211
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,774
[Man] 500 acres.

212
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:03,476
Between Cedar and Hillside.

213
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,678
Oh, you're kidding.

214
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:11,050
Nope...

215
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:15,689
Two of you in there?

216
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:19,359
[Rylie] Huh?

217
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:23,797
[Man] Are there two of you in
there?

218
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:24,698
Yeah?

219
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:30,436
So, do we need to pack up?

220
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:33,741
Yeah.

221
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:39,647
All right.

222
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,183
What, what's your name?

223
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:46,219
[Man] Eulis.

224
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:47,387
What, what was that?

225
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,558
Eulis!

226
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:53,326
I, I can't-

227
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,161
- E-U-L-I-S.

228
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,699
Oh, Eulis.

229
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,334
Do you know anything that
might be open this late?

230
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,836
Like a motel or...

231
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,805
[distant creaks]

232
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:05,739
[hurried footsteps]

233
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,308
Not right in town that I can
think of.

234
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:12,580
There might be something further
north.

235
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:16,784
[hurried footsteps]

236
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:26,192
Might be something further
north.

237
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:29,429
Okay.

238
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,296
Thanks.

239
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:36,670
I'll come back around,
next couple hours.

240
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:39,172
Make sure you're outta here.

241
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,140
Yeah, we'll be out in a bit.

242
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:43,309
Make sure to douse that fire.

243
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:44,510
Yeah, will do!

244
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:48,782
Get home safe.

245
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:51,652
Yeah, thank you.

[distant owl hoots]

249
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:15,643
We're probably gonna have
to drive out a couple miles

250
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:16,877
before we get any service,

251
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,412
but I think I can get
us into town on my own.

252
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,224
[engine turns]

253
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:31,925
Nope.

254
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,396
Fucking nope.

255
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,197
Sam.
[engine churns]

256
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:39,198
Fucking nope!

257
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:39,967
Sam!

258
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,668
Did you leave the hazards on?

259
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:42,268
Did I leave the hazards on?

260
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,203
[percussive vocal music]

261
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:47,373
Once we get to the main road
that should bring us into town.

262
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,509
Worst case, we call AAA from
there.

263
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,411
Be home by five AM.

264
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:52,813
[Sam] As long as that's the
worst case.

265
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:54,347
Oh, that's the spirit.

266
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:58,351
I have 47% battery, how much do
you have?

267
00:18:58,384 --> 00:18:59,053
30.

268
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,421
- Is it on low power?
- Yes.

269
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,356
- All other apps-
- All apps are off.

270
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:04,725
[Rylie] Brightness all the way
down?

271
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:06,426
Whoa, what the...

Jesus Christ.

273
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,736
What the fuck?

[suspenseful music]

275
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:30,316
We couldn't just do a nice day
hike, nope.

276
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:31,952
Will you just give it a rest,
Sam?

277
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:34,822
[Sam mumbles to himself]
Just, will you shut up?

278
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:37,558
- Excuse me?
- Just shut up.

279
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,250
Wait.

280
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:05,853
Sam?

281
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:10,490
It's okay, I forgive you!

282
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,390
Idiot.

283
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,595
Nice.

284
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:15,696
- Look.
- What?

285
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:18,732
There.

286
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:22,603
[Sam] What, the light?

287
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:24,838
No, the darkness surrounding
the light.

288
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:27,875
God, come on.

Oh, my god, Sam.

297
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:07,380
God, you're really something
tonight.

298
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:08,749
I'm something tonight?

300
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:21,360
- Not to mention the five-
- Shh!

00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:24,097
- If you shush me one more-

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,374
What's that smell?

[door creaks]

306
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:39,713
- Hi!
- Oh, hi there.

307
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:40,848
Hi.

308
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:42,082
We're so sorry to bother you.

309
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:46,385
We were just wondering if we
could maybe borrow your phone?

310
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:49,455
See, we were camping a little
ways in, near the wheat fields

311
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:52,425
and the land owner told
us that we had to leave.

312
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,027
[Woman] Oh, my goodness.

313
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:57,530
Yeah, so we were all set to
drive home,

314
00:21:57,564 --> 00:22:00,033
and then our car wouldn't
start and we weren't able

315
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,835
to track down any cell service.

316
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:10,476
[distant owl hoots]

317
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:15,949
So, we were wondering if
maybe we could use your phone

318
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:17,885
to call AAA for a jump?

319
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,090
Hi, I'm Sam.

320
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:24,157
Hi, Sam.

321
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:31,198
Should...

322
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:33,667
Oh, please, please!

323
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,702
Where are my manners?

324
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:37,738
Ah, thank you so much.

325
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:39,072
[Woman] Thank you so much.

326
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:41,141
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

327
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,111
- I'm Karen.
- Hi, Karen.

[door slams]

329
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:50,449
AAA won't do you any good over
here.

330
00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:55,856
Take 'em two-three hours just to
get here.

331
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,891
Not worth it just for a jump.

332
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:04,231
Now, my neighbor, Pete, he
could be here in 30 minutes.

333
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:06,633
Settle for a T-bone steak

334
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,970
and a glass of milk for
compensation. [chuckles]

335
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:12,239
Wouldn't have to spend a nickel.

336
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:13,206
That'd be great.

337
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,876
Are you sure that he's
awake? It's already-

338
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:16,977
- Pete?

339
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,211
Karen.

340
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:21,214
I've got a sweet couple here.

341
00:23:21,248 --> 00:23:23,684
Had their camping trip wrecked

342
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:26,553
by some scum sucker over by...

343
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:29,156
Did you get his name?

344
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:31,191
Eulis.

345
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:32,759
You-us?

346
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:33,660
Eulis.

348
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:39,166
Oh, Eulis. [chuckles]

349
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:41,500
You know a, a Eulis?

350
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:44,671
Eulis.

351
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:46,773

Oh, okay.

354
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,847
Okay.

355
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:56,515
Okay.

356
00:23:57,617 --> 00:23:59,619
So I'll see you in a bit.

357
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:02,089
See ya in a bit!

358
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,559
And if you've got your teeth in,

359
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:09,196
I'll fix ya a cut and a fresh
loaf.

360
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:10,797
[chuckles]

361
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:12,699
All right, my dear.

[sighs]
[dark percussive music]

363
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,543
Did he say how long he might
be?

364
00:24:24,578 --> 00:24:25,812
Eulis?

- We don't wanna overstay.
- Oh, please, please, please.

369
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:37,157
He shouldn't be more than 30

Worst case, 45, since he's
gettin' on.

Must've really disrupted
the industry over here.

00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:18,618
Where?

731
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:19,786
In your tum tum.

Window washer.

736
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:33,967
[Sam] Of course.

737
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:35,035
Of course.

738
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:38,171
This is so predictable.

739
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,040
I have zero appetite.

740
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:41,875
Is this place open?

741
00:57:46,313 --> 00:57:47,581
What's gonna happen to him?

742
00:57:47,614 --> 00:57:48,281
Shh!

743
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:52,886
It's just there are moments

744
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:55,255
hanging in the ether that could
be mine.

745
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:57,124
Oh, for Christ sake.

747
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,600
Oh, shoot.

748
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,735
[Rylie] It really
isn't as bad as it looks,

749
00:58:08,769 --> 00:58:09,870
and to be honest,

750
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:13,807
I think you're being a little
bit of a Letdown Larry.

751
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:17,244
Oh, I can't talk to you right
now.

752
00:58:17,277 --> 00:58:20,013

758
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:29,649
For Christ's sake.

759
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,723
I've got purpose."

760
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:41,862
What a piece of shit.

Hey, Gunni, come on!

Come on, come on, come on.

812
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:56,042
[Operator] 911, what's your
emergency?

813
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:59,613
[Sam] Hi, yes I'm calling
about a girl who's gone missing.

814
01:05:01,214 --> 01:05:02,683
My girlfriend just disappeared.

815
01:05:02,716 --> 01:05:05,051
- We're staying with this woman-
- What's the address, sir?

816
01:05:05,084 --> 01:05:07,454
[Sam] Yeah, I think it's,
uh, it's Cormorant Way

817
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,322
between, um, I think

818
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:12,593
between Pleasant Street and
Trouble Street, I believe.

819
01:05:12,626 --> 01:05:14,994
[Operator] I'm going to
need an exact address, sir.

820
01:05:15,028 --> 01:05:18,264
[Sam] Okay, yeah, I don't
know, it's a white house.

821
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:20,266
[Operator] Sir, I'm gonna
nee...

822
01:05:22,035 --> 01:05:22,703
Hello?

823
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:25,338

[rattling]
[engine hums]

832
01:08:36,997 --> 01:08:39,967
[Woman] Do you not know that
your bodies

833
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,670
are temples of the holy spirit?

834
01:08:43,804 --> 01:08:44,938
Who is in you.

835
01:08:46,974 --> 01:08:50,443
Whom you have received from God.

836
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:51,344
You.

837
01:08:53,312 --> 01:08:54,915
You are not your own.

838
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:57,417
[cutlery clinks]

839
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,451
You were bought.

840
01:08:59,419 --> 01:09:02,656
You were bought at a price.
[fire crackles]

841
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:05,826
Therefore, honor God with your
bodies.

842
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,631
There will be terrible
times in the last days.

843
01:09:10,664 --> 01:09:13,232
People will be lovers of
themselves.

844
01:09:13,266 --> 01:09:14,735
[static crackles]

845
01:09:14,768 --> 01:09:16,235
Lovers of money.

846
01:09:17,638 --> 01:09:18,504
Boastful.

847
01:09:19,472 --> 01:09:20,339
Proud.

848
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:22,676
Abusive.

849
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:27,948
Treacherous, rash, conceited.

850
01:09:29,016 --> 01:09:34,220
Lovers of, lovers of the planet
rather than lovers of God.

851
01:09:34,555 --> 01:09:36,790
[suspenseful music]

852
01:09:36,824 --> 01:09:40,359
Having a form of Godliness
but denying its power

853
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:44,598
Having nothing, have nothing
to do with such people.

854
01:09:44,631 --> 01:09:49,435
There are kinds [clears
throat] who worm their way

855
01:09:49,469 --> 01:09:54,273
into homes and gain control
over gullible women.

[Rylie whines]

861
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:42,823
[Rylie] What's going on?

862
01:10:42,856 --> 01:10:44,691
Are you okay?

[chair clunks]

867
01:12:28,128 --> 01:12:29,528
Don't get up.

868
01:12:32,498 --> 01:12:33,166
Karen.

869
01:12:35,068 --> 01:12:35,936
Karen.

870
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:39,172
What's, what's going on?

[static crackles]

877
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:22,515
Karen!

[Karen sighs]

883
01:14:06,293 --> 01:14:07,160
Rylie.

884
01:14:10,297 --> 01:14:11,164
Sam.

885
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:18,271
We are livin' in a... [coughs]

886
01:14:19,272 --> 01:14:22,175
Livin' in a time of tribulation.

887
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,946
Eul', darnit with that!

888
01:14:28,582 --> 01:14:30,150
To put it simply.

889
01:14:31,318 --> 01:14:36,223
We have perverted God's divine
love,

890
01:14:36,256 --> 01:14:38,725
through abuse of his gifts.

891
01:14:38,759 --> 01:14:40,794
[Gunni sneezes]

892
01:14:40,827 --> 01:14:43,830
We were overindulgent in God's
feed,

893
01:14:45,866 --> 01:14:48,335
and so he took it away.

894
01:14:48,368 --> 01:14:52,039
Forcing us to seek a
more immediate source,

895
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:56,643
so that he may not forsake
us in the end times,

896
01:14:57,744 --> 01:15:02,149
which, my babies, are
nearer than you may think.

897
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:09,656
But we have been given an
opportunity for absolution.

898
01:15:11,825 --> 01:15:16,196
A second chance to sustain life
entirely

899
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:19,633
through consumption of what we
can access

900
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:23,904
of our own flesh and available
earth,

901
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:26,740
so we may be judged in his
image.

902
01:15:28,308 --> 01:15:30,977
Now, that's what I call mercy.

903
01:15:32,312 --> 01:15:33,246
So...

904
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,185
Came up with a sorta
redemption-type program.

905
01:15:39,653 --> 01:15:41,254
A rationing effort.

906
01:15:42,222 --> 01:15:47,227
We've had a number of
participants

907
01:15:47,894 --> 01:15:49,329
over the years.

908
01:15:50,931 --> 01:15:53,633
I think we've worked out all the
kinks.

909
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:56,236
Just about.

910
01:15:57,370 --> 01:16:02,342
This little sweetheart's
been with us for a while now.

911
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:06,346
[scratching]

912

[eerie music]

913
01:16:11,184 --> 01:16:14,688
If there was ever someone
who needed a good sortin'...

914
01:16:18,024 --> 01:16:21,161
Quite the pig. [chuckles]

915
01:16:21,194 --> 01:16:23,430
But from his gluttony,

916
01:16:23,463 --> 01:16:26,133
we were blessed with two cheeks

917
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,402
and a beefy round.

918
01:16:29,436 --> 01:16:30,571
[Gunni screams]

919
01:16:30,605 --> 01:16:34,808
He's also taught us a heck
of a lot about perseverance.

920
01:16:36,376 --> 01:16:41,381
And loyalty.
[Gunni groans]

921
01:16:44,484 --> 01:16:48,054
And now that we're done with his
bottom,

922
01:16:49,289 --> 01:16:51,358
we gotta take from the top.

923
01:17:28,495 --> 01:17:31,431
[hums melodically]

924
01:17:37,871 --> 01:17:40,373
[fire crackles]

925
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:02,362
You've probably been wonderin'

926
01:18:02,395 --> 01:18:07,334
[chuckles] what the heck is in
this thing.

927
01:18:15,008 --> 01:18:18,211
[strained breaths]

928
01:18:18,245 --> 01:18:20,780
[lid creaks]

929
01:18:27,854 --> 01:18:29,856
This is our daughter.

930
01:18:29,889 --> 01:18:32,058
My god.

931
01:18:32,092 --> 01:18:33,026
[Karen] Delilah.

932
01:18:36,162 --> 01:18:38,765
[eerie music]

933
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,172
She's given us just about
everything

934
01:18:46,206 --> 01:18:48,541
she's got over the years.

935
01:18:48,576 --> 01:18:51,244
A true model of self-sacrifice.

936
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:55,782
Come on, girlie.

937
01:18:58,852 --> 01:19:01,454
[Delilah whines]

938
01:19:06,126 --> 01:19:11,131
Oh.
[Delilah whines]

939
01:19:12,966 --> 01:19:15,569
[Delilah chokes]

940
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,009
All right, all right. [chuckles]

941
01:19:23,043 --> 01:19:25,245
I'm honin' in on breakfast.

942
01:19:27,615 --> 01:19:29,082
Oh, okay, honey.

943
01:19:30,584 --> 01:19:34,854
It's on its way, my love.

944
01:19:34,888 --> 01:19:38,091
[meat sizzles]

945
01:19:38,124 --> 01:19:40,994
[static crackles]

946
01:19:42,062 --> 01:19:44,998
[Delilah gasps]

947
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:47,167
Ah, that's her language.

948
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,301
That blinkin'?

949
01:19:48,335 --> 01:19:50,638
She's sayin' "feed me, darn it!

950
01:19:50,671 --> 01:19:54,874
Feed me that's boy's sweet rear
end."

951
01:19:54,908 --> 01:19:57,110
[chuckles]

952
01:19:58,579 --> 01:20:00,980
[chuckles]

953
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:07,420
Let's get this old girl fed.

954
01:20:07,454 --> 01:20:08,321
Shall we?

955
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:15,895
See how you compare to Buggy
Boy.

956
01:20:16,996 --> 01:20:18,431
Bless us, O Lord, and these, thy
gifts,

957
01:20:18,465 --> 01:20:20,133
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty.

958
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:24,137
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.
[chuckles]

959
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:27,173
[eerie vocal music]

960
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:31,378
There you go.

961
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:37,317
Oh, oh, oh, oh! [chuckles]

962
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:39,018
Slow down, darlin'.

963
01:20:41,121 --> 01:20:45,959
She's like, "where the hell's
this been all my life?"

964
01:20:45,992 --> 01:20:49,195
[laughs] Oh, mama mia!

965
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:55,335
[Gunni grunts]
[chair rattles]

966
01:20:57,437 --> 01:21:00,373
Yum, yum, yum, gimme, gimme,
gimme.

967
01:21:02,308 --> 01:21:03,543
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

968
01:21:03,577 --> 01:21:05,478
Pace yourself, darlin'.

969
01:21:12,653 --> 01:21:14,988
Grade-A prime cut, Samuel.

970
01:21:19,325 --> 01:21:22,195
[Delilah wheezes]

971
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:29,235
[Gunni groans]
[chair rattles]

972
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,643
All right.

973
01:21:35,676 --> 01:21:37,343
That'll do for now.

974
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:47,320
[Gunni groans]
[chair rattles]

975
01:22:10,443 --> 01:22:13,313
[Delilah wheezes]

976
01:22:24,357 --> 01:22:28,428
Made from all the brightest
suns of the Universe.

977
01:22:29,362 --> 01:22:31,030
And volumes beyond.

978
01:22:43,343 --> 01:22:47,280
[Gunni groans]
[chair rattles]

979
01:22:47,313 --> 01:22:52,318
[rapid thuds]
[tense music]

980
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:03,396
You better believe we're
still aimin' for grand babies.

981
01:23:06,366 --> 01:23:08,802
Bring some sunshine into this
black world.

982
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:13,674
Goon here seems to be working
with an empty cartridge.

983
01:23:15,609 --> 01:23:19,279
[static crackles]

984
01:23:19,312 --> 01:23:23,283
There's another little piece
here, babies.

985
01:23:25,485 --> 01:23:26,352
Goon bug?

986
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,122
Gunni?

987
01:23:30,658 --> 01:23:31,524
Gunni!

988
01:23:33,894 --> 01:23:36,529
One more little piece.

989
01:23:37,765 --> 01:23:42,603
Eulis here was the go-to farm
vet, once upon a sometime.

990
01:23:43,536 --> 01:23:46,472
He performs all our procedures.

991
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:49,777
We have a little,

992
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:52,145
little sorta security system.

993
01:24:05,258 --> 01:24:06,125
Eulis?

994
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:10,496
Eulis.

995
01:24:15,168 --> 01:24:15,836
Eulis?

996
01:24:18,672 --> 01:24:19,539
Eulis.

997
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,409
I've got money.

998
01:24:27,347 --> 01:24:28,548
I've got money.

999
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:33,486
Money, I have got money.

1000
01:24:34,387 --> 01:24:37,156
[Eulis chuckles]

1001
01:24:40,928 --> 01:24:42,195
Money, money, money.

1002
01:24:49,402 --> 01:24:51,605
[Sam sobs]

1003
01:24:55,441 --> 01:24:57,343
Eulis, please.

1004
01:24:57,377 --> 01:25:00,781
[Rylie whines]
Please, please.

1005
01:25:00,814 --> 01:25:03,483
- Eulis, come on.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1006
01:25:04,918 --> 01:25:05,819
Turn it up, Goon.

1007
01:25:09,757 --> 01:25:10,691
Goon bug?

1008
01:25:14,293 --> 01:25:16,864
Eulis.
[gas hisses]

1009
01:25:16,897 --> 01:25:17,765
Eulis.

1010
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,901
Please, Eulis, please.

1011
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:24,672
[Eulis] This is an
orbitoclast.

1012
01:25:29,475 --> 01:25:32,579
Wasn't an entirely unpopular way
of

1013
01:25:33,981 --> 01:25:37,517
giving people an overhaul, at
one time.

1014
01:25:39,019 --> 01:25:40,888
Please, Eulis, don't do this.

1015
01:25:40,921 --> 01:25:42,455
I'll do anything.

1016
01:25:43,356 --> 01:25:44,992
Eulis, I'll do anything.

1017
01:25:45,025 --> 01:25:47,828
Can't guarantee you
won't try to run off.

1018
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:49,195
Oh, look at Gunni there.

1019
01:25:50,698 --> 01:25:53,767
Sweet as a baby chipmunk, and
happy, too.

1020
01:25:54,835 --> 01:25:55,703
Truly.

1021
01:25:56,536 --> 01:25:58,839
You're not gonna feel a damn
thing.

1022
01:25:58,872 --> 01:26:00,641
Well, a little pressure, maybe.

1023
01:26:00,674 --> 01:26:03,543
Then it's bright eyes and sweet
smile.

1024
01:26:04,611 --> 01:26:06,647
[Eulis] Not gonna make this
any easier,

1025
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,548
whippin' around, Pork Chop.

1026
01:26:08,582 --> 01:26:10,918
No more strainin', Sam.

1027
01:26:10,951 --> 01:26:14,287
Not one more wracked nerve,
darlin'.

1028
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,426
Eulis!

1029
01:26:21,862 --> 01:26:22,863
Come on!

1030
01:26:23,897 --> 01:26:27,668
Bright eyes and sweet smiles.

1031
01:26:28,969 --> 01:26:32,873
No, no!
[Rylie sobs]

1032
01:26:32,906 --> 01:26:36,309
[Eulis] Bright eyes and sweet
smiles.

[siren wails]
[car approaches]

1034
01:26:44,885 --> 01:26:45,753
Shit.

1035
01:26:46,754 --> 01:26:49,355
[Rylie and Sam scream]

1036
01:26:49,388 --> 01:26:50,958
- Help!
- Help!

1037
01:26:50,991 --> 01:26:52,559
Help!

1038
01:26:52,593 --> 01:26:53,594
- [Sam] Help!
- [Rylie] Help!

1039
01:26:54,695 --> 01:26:55,896
- [Sam] Help!
- [Rylie] Help!

1040
01:26:55,929 --> 01:26:57,064
You shut it.

1041
01:26:57,097 --> 01:26:58,464
You shut it!

1042
01:26:58,498 --> 01:26:59,733
- Help!
- Help!

1043
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:01,668
[Eulis] You shut it, or she
gets it!

1044
01:27:02,535 --> 01:27:03,904
[Karen] Hey, fellas.

1045
01:27:03,937 --> 01:27:06,372
You shut it, or she gets it.

1046
01:27:08,609 --> 01:27:10,309
[muffled chatter]

1047
01:27:10,343 --> 01:27:11,678
So help me, God.

[radio chatter]

1049
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,759
One more squeak,

1050
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:30,329
and she'll pop him, right
between the peepers.

1051
01:27:31,031 --> 01:27:33,901
[muffled chatter]

1052
01:27:47,714 --> 01:27:51,417
[Karen] Yeah, no, it's
been a pretty good year.

1053
01:27:51,450 --> 01:27:53,954
Well, it's good to see ya.
It's always good to see ya.

1054
01:27:53,987 --> 01:27:55,354
Yeah, yeah.

1055
01:27:55,388 --> 01:27:58,025
[Officer] ...come and check it
out.

1056
01:27:58,058 --> 01:28:01,762
[distorted radio chatter]

1057
01:28:01,795 --> 01:28:02,863
Hey, Gunni.

[gas hisses]

1059
01:28:08,902 --> 01:28:09,770
Gunni.

1060
01:28:11,705 --> 01:28:12,906
Gunni, come on.

1061
01:28:13,874 --> 01:28:16,342
Gunni, take off my mask.

1062
01:28:19,746 --> 01:28:22,149
Gunni, go up the stairs.

1063
01:28:22,182 --> 01:28:23,717
Take off my mask.

1064
01:28:32,893 --> 01:28:37,396
Take off my mask, yeah, yeah.

1066
01:28:43,704 --> 01:28:45,572
Gunni, take off her mask.

Yeah.

1068
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,909
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Rylie pants]

1070
01:28:50,777 --> 01:28:52,846
Yeah, that's good, Gunni.

1071
01:28:54,214 --> 01:28:56,449
Gunni, listen to me.

1072
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:59,620
Take the tape off our wrists.

1073
01:29:01,554 --> 01:29:02,756
Un-tape our hands.

1074
01:29:06,226 --> 01:29:07,094
Yeah.

1075
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:10,964
[tense music]

1076
01:29:10,998 --> 01:29:12,933
Oh, my god, good.

1077
01:29:12,966 --> 01:29:13,967
Good, Gunni.

1078
01:29:15,002 --> 01:29:16,069
That's great.

1079
01:29:18,872 --> 01:29:19,740
Yeah.

1080
01:29:21,241 --> 01:29:22,643
Now, Gunni, listen to me.

1081
01:29:23,677 --> 01:29:25,178
Listen to me, Gunni.

1082
01:29:25,212 --> 01:29:26,479
Cut the tape.

[ominous tones]

1084
01:29:35,822 --> 01:29:37,523
Gunni, Gunni.

1085
01:29:37,557 --> 01:29:38,491
Look at me.

1086
01:29:40,027 --> 01:29:43,030
Pull out the knife and cut the
tape.

1087
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:45,699
Yeah.

1088
01:29:46,767 --> 01:29:47,634
Yeah.

1089
01:29:48,602 --> 01:29:49,535
Right here.

1090
01:29:50,737 --> 01:29:51,738
Good.

1092
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:54,808
Yeah.

[cutting]

1094
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,747
Quicker.

1095
01:30:02,015 --> 01:30:04,084
