1
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,006
Ryan, Jeanette's on the phone.

2
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:57,347
I'm not home.

3
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,774
She's crying, Ryan.

4
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:02,513
When isn't she crying?

5
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,988
Well, Well, can you just talk to her?

6
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,495
Otherwise she's going to keep me
on the phone half the night.

7
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,395
Hang up on her, Wade.

8
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,159
I can't... do that.
Will you just talk to her?

9
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:21,371
Just-- tell her I'm in the bathroom
and I'll call her back later.

10
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,275
Please.

11
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,340
I'm in the bathroom, Wade.

12
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,786
Yeah, Jeanette?

13
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:45,031
Yeah. Um, he says he's going to...
be in the bathroom.

14
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,259
He'll call you back.

15
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:50,970
You know,
I should probably go over to my mom's.

16
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,139
I was supposed to be there,
like, two hours ago.

17
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,233
Hm. I wouldn't worry about her.

18
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,977
She made a pact with the devil,
remember?

19
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:10,956
Good rest ye merry cheating wives,
nothing you dismay.

20
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:19,159
But that won't be a problem
if you never would have strayed.

21
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:24,395
What do you think?

22
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,029
Maybe I'll cut a record, huh?

23
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:31,439
Think it's got potential?

24
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:34,379
What are you doing here, Keith?

25
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:38,809
What am I doing here?

26
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,611
It's, uh... it's a good question.

27
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:51,452
I, uh... I don't know. Not anymore.

28
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,039
Oh my god.

29
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:04,335
Relax, sweetheart.

30
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:06,906
I'm not here to hurt you.

31
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,177
Just want you to see something.

32
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:17,512
No!

33
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,002
Well look who finally decided to show up.

34
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,431
You have any idea what time it is?

35
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,837
Couldn't help it.
Something terrible happened. Keith s--

36
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,882
I know. Larry called.

37
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,146
He heard it on the police scanner.

38
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:48,954
He always said he would.

39
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,923
I just didn't believe him.

40
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,258
I never thought for
a second he would have--

41
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:56,854
Don't. Don't. Don't cry.

42
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,362
It's too late for tears now.

43
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:06,664
What you did to Keith,
there's no escaping it.

44
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,907
Did you get your medication?

45
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,104
I forgot.

46
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,273
Shelley.

47
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:18,444
Bruce! Oh my god! Hey!
What are you doing here?

48
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,445
Moved back.

49
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:19,945
You moved back--

50
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:21,113
Just got here a couple days ago.

51
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,816
Well, I never think you would come back,
living in Vegas and all.

52
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,018
Yeah, Vegas didn't treat me so good.

53
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:26,652
Oh.

54
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,554
I got to like gambling a little too much.

55
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,356
Been working up near
Truckee last couple years.

56
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,557
Yeah? Doing...

57
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,926
Law enforcement. If you can believe that.

58
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:34,627
Very nice.

59
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,629
I just transferred to Meadville.

60
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,263
Great.

61
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,031
Shelley, your order's up.

62
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,498
Hold on a second, Bruce.

63
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:45,571
Right. Here.

64
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:50,142
Avocado and noodles.
You guys good? Yeah.

65
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:52,745
And- and you? What's new with you?
How's your mom?

66
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,881
Um... pretty much the same, actually.

67
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,882
And, and Keith?

68
00:06:56,882 --> 00:07:01,820
Sorry. That's, uh, that's actually
a long story, Bruce.

69
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,622
Oh. You look good.

70
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,824
Aw, thanks. So do you.

71
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,960
Um, I was hoping I'd run into you.

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,729
I've been so busy since I got back
I haven't seen anybody from school,

73
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:11,830
and-- Shelley?

74
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,334
Bucktoothed moron by
the window wants his check.

75
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,670
Oh. Bruce, you kind of...
you caught me at a really busy time.

76
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,605
Is there any way we can do this...

77
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,943
Maybe we can get together sometime,
and- and really catch up.

78
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,179
I would really like that.
I want to hear all about Vegas.

79
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,148
Yeah. There's a lot to tell.

80
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,240
Later, Bruce!

81
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:06,984
Where's that good looking deputy
we just hired?

82
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,095
I'm going to go home and-
and grab a little sleep.

83
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,730
I got a long night ahead of me.

84
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,699
Me too. They put me on a double.
Can you believe that?

85
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:36,949
Hey, excuse me, can you tell me
how to get to Pine Grove Avenue?

86
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,952
Uh, yeah, just, uh go down to the light,

87
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,421
and, uh, make a right, and, uh,
go about two blocks.

88
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,422
You should see it right there.

89
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,324
You look like a whore.

90
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,094
You know, the kind of woman that makes
a man leave his wife and child.

91
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,654
Kind of woman that makes a man
take his own life.

92
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,632
Who are you?

93
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:57,369
You know it's- it's really not a problem
with me if you're a whore,

94
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:01,169
but then again, I isn’t one of
the ones you been hurting'.

95
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,049
You've never seen him before?

96
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,073
Never.

97
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,953
He- he doesn't sound like
anybody Jeanette would know.

98
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:16,655
How do you know who Jeanette knows,
Ryan?

99
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:19,691
He- he- he could be a hit man.
You know how crazy she is.

100
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:20,859
She's not that crazy.

101
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:23,829
Oh no? Calling us at three, four,
five o'clock in the morning, Ryan?

102
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,265
Calling my own mother to
have her turn against me?

103
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,733
Your mother was already against you.

104
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,335
Yeah, well you know at least
she didn't get somebody to show up

105
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:31,503
at my work and call me a whore.

106
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:33,305
You don't know that was Jeanette.

107
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:35,674
Who else would it be, Ryan?

108
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:38,811
She's- she's- she's going around town
telling everybody lies about me.

109
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,547
You know, people think I killed Keith.

110
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,049
Nobody thinks you killed Keith.

111
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:47,985
Everybody thinks that, Ryan,
or else they think you did it.

112
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,524
I just- I'm going crazy.

113
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm going out of my mind, Ryan.

114
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,492
Okay. Okay. Whoa. Come on.

115
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:05,333
Why don't we just go out somewhere.

116
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:09,308
I don't want to go out.
People just stare.

117
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,111
Wade told me about this party way up
in Pulaski.

118
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:12,811
Pulaski?

119
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,473
Yes. Nobody knows us out there.

120
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,083
We're supposed to get,
like, two feet of snow.

121
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,948
I have four wheel drive.

122
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:33,532
Larry, it's me.

123
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,933
I know it's you.

124
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:37,169
There's a thing called caller lD,
you know.

125
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,238
Or are you too drunk to remember?

126
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,506
Don't start with me.

127
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,740
Hey, I didn't start anything.

128
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,401
You called me.

129
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,944
So what favour can I do for you?

130
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:48,580
You really think I only call
if I want something, don't you?

131
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,517
No, I don't think, I know.
So what is it?

132
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,385
Are you listening to
your scanner right now?

133
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:54,820
I'm always listening.

134
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,857
Well, Shelley was supposed to come by
a couple hours ago, and she didn't.

135
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,325
That's typical Shelley.

136
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,995
Yeah, well,
she's a little later than usual,

137
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,165
and I got a little worried, so...

138
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,066
Well, I haven't heard anything
about any accidents.

139
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,301
Does that set your mind at ease?

140
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,435
It does.

141
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:12,995
Good. Bitch.

142
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,534
Jerk.

143
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,859
Well, damn. Look at all that snow.

144
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,054
You sure you don't want to
stay the night?

145
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,931
No, we should get going before
it gets too bad.

146
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,132
Already bad.

147
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,566
We'll be fine.

148
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:50,463
Go away! You're not welcome here.

149
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:54,268
Hey, watch it!

150
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:03,611
Friendly local morons.

151
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,353
Damet, open the door!

152
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,855
I will break this damn door down.
Don't think I won't.

153
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,257
Jeanette, he's not here.

154
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,091
Yeah.

155
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,059
Bull crap he's not.

156
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:45,163
Where is he?

157
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:47,633
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all night.

158
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:52,271
I'm sick and damn tired of him
not picking up my phone calls.

159
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,673
He is the father of my child.

160
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,010
How does he know Eliot's
not sick or something?

161
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,278
Is Eliot sick?

162
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,812
That's not the damn point.

163
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:04,283
The point is he's irresponsible...
running around with that slut,

164
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,019
and ignoring his duty as a father.

165
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,281
You want a beer?

166
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,968
It's Jeanette, isn't it?

167
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,802
Yeah.

168
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,536
Oh my god!

169
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:27,072
How many times is
she going to call tonight?

170
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,574
As many times as she calls
every other night.

171
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:33,874
Why don't we just...
why don't we just keep going?

172
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,616
Why don't we just run away, right now?

173
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,450
Look, we can't do that, all right?

174
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,952
I got a kid, and you have your mother
to take care of.

175
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:42,020
Yeah, I don't care anymore.

176
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,356
She can find somebody else
to look after her.

177
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,757
You can call for Eliot later.

178
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:48,385
Yeah.
Jeanette would never let that happen.

179
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,096
Then let's steal him.

180
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,862
Let's go over there right now
and take him.

181
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,435
You want to?

182
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,303
Yeah. What's to stop us?

183
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:00,498
I mean, he's your son.

184
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:04,509
How long has that car been behind us?

185
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:05,477
What car?

186
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,813
The one behind us.

187
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,906
I never noticed.

188
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,818
Just- just make the next turn you can.

189
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:13,452
Why?

190
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,943
Just do it.

191
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,427
It's him.

192
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:23,195
Who?

193
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,229
The man outside the diner.

194
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:27,756
It's him, Ryan. He's following us.

195
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,368
You think?

196
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,036
Yeah, I think.

197
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,272
Oh my god,
he- he probably wants to kill us.

198
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:37,309
He- he's going to try to run us off
the road and kill us.

199
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,009
Go faster.

200
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:39,611
Ryan, you got to go fast--
I can only go so fast in all this snow.

201
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:41,545
Just- just- just -just--

202
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:47,786
He must have run off the road.

203
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:48,620
He disappeared.

204
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,644
What--

205
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,953
Oh my god, Ryan! Stop!
What--

206
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,159
You hit him!

207
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,026
I did not!

208
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:57,429
Yes you did! Just stop the car.

209
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,764
A minute ago you tell me to drive faster.
Now you want me--

210
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,165
Just stop the truck, Ryan!

211
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,359
Fine.

212
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,407
Hello?

213
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,880
Hello?

214
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,939
Is anybody there?

215
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,584
I'm sure I didn't hit anybody.

216
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:22,075
Ryan, I saw him, okay?

217
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,789
There's no blood.

218
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,629
There, look! Look!

219
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,196
Where?

220
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,798
There.

221
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,933
There's blood e- everywhere. Oh.

222
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,067
Oh my god.

223
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:36,902
Oh my god, you're right.

224
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,004
Oh my- what- are you sure it was,
like, it was a person?

225
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,405
It wasn't, like, a deer or something?

226
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:43,341
I mean, I don't know, Ryan.
I just saw it for a second. It ju--

227
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,332
Come here. Well, where is he?

228
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,108
Hello?

229
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,446
Where are you?

230
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:07,692
Do you think we should call the sheriff?

231
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,425
No.

232
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,273
Because they'll think
we did it on purpose.

233
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:16,675
Why- why would they think that?

234
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,143
Because it was him.

235
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:18,844
Who?

236
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,779
That guy.
The guy from the diner earlier.

237
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,379
It was him.

238
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,515
I mean, I only saw it for a second,
but I'm pretty sure.

239
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,918
Shelley, come on. How could it be him?

240
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:30,655
How could he be behind us one second
and then in front of us the next?

241
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:35,456
I don't know, okay?
But l- I really think it was him.

242
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,865
You didn't happen to see the name of
the road we're on, did you

243
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,767
Uh... why?

244
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,670
I just got a little turned around,
that's all.

245
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,672
You- you- do you need a map?

246
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:51,768
No, Shelley, the map is not going to do any
good if I don't know where I am.

247
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,040
Well, are we lost?

248
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,851
We're a little lost.

249
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:02,843
Is that like being a little pregnant?

250
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,425
No.
Look, we're going to be okay, all right?

251
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:10,161
We- we've been driving for, what,
an hour now?

252
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,391
We can't be too far from home.

253
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,901
Is that a car up there?

254
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,640
Yeah.

255
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,609
What's it doing in the middle of
the road with no lights on?

256
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,679
May- maybe they're in trouble
and need some help.

257
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,806
We could use a little help ourselves.

258
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:32,843
Be right back.

259
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:02,581
That's so weird.

260
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,583
Weird? What was weird?

261
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,085
Uh, there's insects inside the car.

262
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:07,719
Insects?

263
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,821
Yeah. Flies or something.

264
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:11,156
No people? What--

265
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,216
No. Nothing but flies.

266
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,830
We're playing the songs of
the season here at KPOX,

267
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,400
and we've got a big old storm
brewing outside right now.

268
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,235
Hello?

269
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:27,772
Miranda, it's Gayle. Shelley's mom?

270
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:29,574
Oh. Hi.

271
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,876
Has- has Shelley called
you by any chance?

272
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:35,175
Uh, tonight? No, why?

273
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,648
Well, I haven't heard from her,

274
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,917
and I was, uh,
was getting a little concerned.

275
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,287
It's snowing like
you can't believe outside.

276
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,822
Oh, global warming.

277
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,889
I'm sorry?

278
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,826
We're going to get a lot more snow because
of global warming.

279
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,095
We're going to get a lot more of everything.

280
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:54,065
Sweetie, you might want to renew
your subscription to Time Magazine,

281
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,002
if you ever had one.

282
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:01,371
Um... I also, I don't think that's
how global warming works.

283
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:07,479
And if Shelley calls, I will make sure
that I don't get a hold of you.

284
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,179
I'm sorry?

285
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,916
Um, nothing.
I'm just going to go to bed, okay?

286
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,747
Have a good night.

287
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,615
Painkiller.

288
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:22,750
You bastard.

289
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,565
The National Weather Service is calling
for as much as three feet of snow.

290
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:28,266
And if we're lucky,

291
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:32,037
they'll taper off before morning,
with temperatures as low as zero.

292
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,164
Yeah, that's right, we're talking zero.

293
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,878
Hey, hey, hey,
there's a sign right there.

294
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,645
Where? Where?

295
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:41,913
Right there, right there. Slow down.

296
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:42,380
What?

297
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,007
Roll down the wind--

298
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:45,750
Yeah. You see it?

299
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,412
No, I can't see anything.

300
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,880
No, it's fine. I got it.

301
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:52,585
All right.

302
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,761
Ryan! Ryan!
What? Whoa, what happened?

303
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,762
Just saw Keith.

304
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,298
Hey, hey! It's okay.
What- what happened?

305
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,096
Just go, Ryan!
Just start the car and let's go!

306
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,149
Ryan! Ryan!

307
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:51,816
What are you doing?

308
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:52,417
Ryan!

309
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,551
Get off of me!

310
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:56,884
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan!
Kill us both! Stop it get off!

311
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,948
Ah!

312
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:02,984
Ow!

313
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,431
I'm s- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

314
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:12,199
Ow! What- what-

315
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,444
Why- I'm sorry.

316
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,148
There's somebody outside of the car,
and I know this sounds crazy,

317
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:23,948
but I really think it's Keith.

318
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:27,485
Stop it! We just need to get home.
Okay?

319
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:33,685
We'll just get home,
and we'll be all- all better.

320
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,365
Come on!

321
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,755
Nine-one-one emergency.

322
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,658
Hello? Hello? Hey, hey,
I'm- I'm stuck in the snow. Hello?

323
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,792
You're stranded?

324
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,160
Look, we really need some help out here.

325
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,763
No, no, no, no, no. Who is that?

326
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,198
I think he's coming back.

327
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,632
Why do you think he's coming back?

328
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:16,434
Baby, are you sure the doors are locked?

329
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:17,435
Hold the doors.

330
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:18,369
Yes, sweetheart, the doors are locked.

331
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:21,506
Sir? Sir, who's in the car with you?

332
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,474
Come on! Hel- who- are you there?

333
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:25,577
Sir, who do you have in the car with you?

334
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,711
Uh, that's my girlfriend.

335
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:30,181
And, uh, what is she talking about
somebody coming back?

336
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:33,985
Look, no- nobody-- Look, we just- we may
have seen a couple people out here,

337
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,888
and we think that they may be
trying to hurt us.

338
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,623
And why would they want to do that?

339
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,727
Well, you know,
I think-- l- we- we think...

340
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:46,397
that... there- there may have been
an accident a while back.

341
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:48,199
And- and- and we think that
the other driver,

342
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,467
that he might be trying to hurt us.

343
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:52,036
Because you hurt him in the accident?

344
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:55,106
Maybe. But l- l- I don't even know
if there was an accident.

345
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:56,274
Have you been drinking?

346
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,343
No, no. I haven't had a drop to drink
all night long,

347
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,644
and neither has my girlfriend.

348
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,913
Okay. And exactly where are you?

349
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:02,814
We're- we're- uh,

350
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,782
we're- we're- we're near,
uh, Deer Tail Road.

351
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:05,950
My girlfriend said she saw a sign
that said that said Deer Tail Road.

352
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,185
Deer Tail Road.

353
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,286
I saw a sign that said Deer Tail Road.
I saw--

354
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,921
And that's- that should be about
a mile and a half from

355
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,354
I saw it back there. I don't-

356
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,968
Ten-twelve, we got a stranded vehicle
in the vicinity of.

357
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:28,439
Yeah, we got a white jeep,
license plate three H-E-L five eight one,

358
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:31,738
registered to a Ryan Edward Dunbar.

359
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:36,114
Oh, man, Ryan, l- I haven't seen Ryan
since high school.

360
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,016
Well, he and his girlfriend are stuck
in a ditch out about

361
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,247
a mile and a half from twenty-eight
seventy-six Montpelier.

362
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,890
Two eight seven six Montpelier?

363
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,591
That's right.

364
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,422
Did he happen to mention
his girlfriend's name?

365
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,762
Uh, he didn't, no.

366
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,431
Uh, but he said he thought they might
have been involved in a hit and run.

367
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,667
He thought they might have been?

368
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,368
That's right. That's what he said.

369
00:23:57,368 --> 00:24:01,005
Um, he thought maybe the other driver
was trying to harm them in some way.

370
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:01,439
I don't know.

371
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,169
It didn't make a hell of a lot of sense,
if you ask me.

372
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,977
Oh.

373
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,342
What do you want?

374
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:45,616
You're blitzed out of your head, huh?

375
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:49,153
No, I just almost fell over trying to
open the damn door.

376
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:52,323
Oh, maybe if you weren't drinking
you wouldn't almost be falling.

377
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:55,126
I'm crippled, Larry. Remember?

378
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,718
Yeah, in more ways than one.

379
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,697
Did you come all the way over here
just to insult me?

380
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:01,733
No, but as long as I'm here,
I figured I might as well.

381
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,700
That's hilarious.

382
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,303
You're- you're- you're just a real riot.

383
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,838
Well, you used to think so.

384
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,539
Well I came to my senses.

385
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:11,167
So if you're here to insult me,
just leave.

386
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,273
Shelley's stuck in a ditch.

387
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,018
What?

388
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,086
I heard it on my scanner.

389
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:23,421
Well how do you know it's her?

390
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,089
Boyfriend's name is Ryan, right?

391
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:27,291
Oh, that jerk. Don't remind me.

392
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,761
Yeah.
Well, uh, he called police dispatch,

393
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,596
gave your address and everything.

394
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,997
And, sounds like they've been
in an accident.

395
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:34,432
Uh, with somebody else, I mean.

396
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,466
Well, is she okay?

397
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:36,567
I didn't hear anything about
any injuries.

398
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,058
All I heard was that
they're stuck in a ditch.

399
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:41,806
Well, go pull her out.

400
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,609
N- you know, the sheriff's on it.

401
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,144
I- l- l- I was on my way home.

402
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,745
I just thought maybe you'd like to know.

403
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:49,781
Well, Larry, why can't
you just go pull her out?

404
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:53,451
Because. I've been working
since seven o'clock this morning.

405
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,719
I'm exhausted.

406
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,120
I'm going to go home and
get a little bit of shut eye.

407
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,955
Oh, on a night like this?
Bull.

408
00:25:57,955 --> 00:25:59,057
You're not going to go to sleep.

409
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,218
There's too much business out there.

410
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:03,528
You know, sheriff's on it.

411
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,829
I'm- I'm on my way home.

412
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,564
I just thought you might want to know.

413
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,700
You're going to leave my daughter stuck in
a ditch to get back at me?

414
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,936
Oh, since when do you care
about your daughter?

415
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:14,338
Since when do you care about anybody?

416
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:16,636
I care about a lot of people.

417
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,710
Fact, there's just one person
I don't care about.

418
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,815
Always a pleasure, Gayle.

419
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,629
Some tow truck driver.

420
00:26:57,181 --> 00:27:04,747
Dear God, please keep Shelley safe.
Please.

421
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,341
Not without protection.

422
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,626
I don't want to get pregnant,
stuck in this town forever.

423
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,852
Are you sure you got
the location correct?

424
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,520
Because I've been up and down Montpelier
two times already.

425
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,756
I'm not seeing any stranded white jeep.

426
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,124
You want to get some more guys on this?

427
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,853
Yeah, I think we better, yeah.

428
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,236
Want to hit this?

429
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,369
Don't mind if I do.
Yeah.

430
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:35,739
It's kind of weird that
he hasn't come home yet.

431
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,046
I hope he's dead.

432
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:39,808
Oh, you don't hope that

433
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:41,912
No, I don't.

434
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:49,289
But you know what,
I don't really love him anymore.

435
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:54,424
If you would a asked me that a month ago,
I would have said yeah.

436
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,963
But not now.

437
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,399
I started seeing someone else.

438
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,733
Who?

439
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,777
This guy. He really loves me, too.

440
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:08,840
You want to see a picture of him?

441
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,087
He is ugly.

442
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,883
He is, isn't he?

443
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,733
Nine-one-one emergency.

444
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,034
Hey, yeah.

445
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:35,006
This is, uh, this is Ryan Dunbar,
the guy who's stranded?

446
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:35,973
I know who you are.

447
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:38,609
We've got people out there
looking everywhere for you.

448
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,338
Well, what's the hold up?

449
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:41,946
We can't find you.

450
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,814
Are you sure you gave us
the correct location?

451
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:45,182
What's she saying?

452
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:46,083
Uh, yeah- yeah.

453
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,252
Wait, what's she saying?
Pretty sure.

454
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:50,988
They said they can't find us.

455
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:52,223
Well then, let's just walk.

456
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,524
It's not that far.

457
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:59,697
Wait, Ryan, did I hear her say
something about walking?

458
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,756
Yeah. Yeah.

459
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,268
Well, that's a very bad idea.

460
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:06,837
It's five below right now.

461
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,172
Doesn't feel that cold.

462
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:08,873
Well, it is.

463
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,309
And I'm not even adding
in the wind chill.

464
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,504
You- you got your heater running, right?

465
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:16,138
Yeah- yes. It's on.

466
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,649
And you got plenty of gas?

467
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:19,583
Full tank.

468
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:20,718
Then just sit tight.

469
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,153
We're going to find you, you know.

470
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,177
Don't worry about it.

471
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:33,793
I wish l- I wish I could fall asleep,
and wake up in my own bed.

472
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,202
You can fall asleep on my shoulder
if you want.

473
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,102
No, it's not going to happen.

474
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,705
I can't sleep right now.

475
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,458
My god. Bruce, how long has it been?

476
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,792
A long time.

477
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:03,627
You're working for the sheriff,
what do you know about that.

478
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:06,528
Yeah, well, it's been interesting.

479
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:08,532
Do you mind if I come in?

480
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:09,965
Oh, of course.

481
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:13,371
Uh, you're catching me
at kind of a weird--

482
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,572
Yeah, I know.

483
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:18,442
I've been out looking for her,
saw your lights on,

484
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,745
thought I'd come by and see
if you knew where she might be.

485
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,805
Me? Oh, she doesn't call me.

486
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:28,953
You know, she stops by once a day
to bring me groceries,

487
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:34,118
or help around the house,
but she doesn't call unless she has to.

488
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,322
She doesn't really take my calls, either.

489
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:42,733
You know,
I honestly think you were pretty lucky,

490
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,496
not ending up marrying her.

491
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,601
Well, I don't know about that.

492
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:51,063
I do. You know about Keith, don't you?

493
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:56,076
Blew his brains out. About a month ago.

494
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:01,352
She'd already dumped him for that
criminal she's running around with.

495
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,553
Uh, you mean Ryan?

496
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,088
You know about him?

497
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:08,959
Yeah. My mom filled me in.
I thought Ryan got married?

498
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:14,098
He did. He did.
He left his wife and baby last summer,

499
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:19,136
moved in with some drug addict friend of
his who lives out near the flats.

500
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:21,105
They've both had run ins with the law.

501
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:28,170
I had Lynn pull Ryan's record,
and... Dull, bar fight, nothing major.

502
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,749
I didn't raise Shelley to run around
with somebody like that.

503
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:35,052
But oh, no, she loves him to death.

504
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:39,390
She didn't even come to her senses after
Keith killed himself.

505
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,620
Oh, she was always selfish like that.

506
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,224
She wasn't selfish, Gayle.

507
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:49,199
Like hell. You remember what happened
the night of my accident?

508
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:56,474
I mean, I'm almost dead in a car wreck,
my spine and my legs are crushed,

509
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,309
and they- they ask me
who should they call,

510
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,510
and I said of course call my daughter.

511
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,980
And they call her,
and she didn't show up at the hospital

512
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,348
until nine or ten the next morning.

513
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:07,718
I mean, my god,
her own mother, almost dead,

514
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:11,322
and she can't even be bothered to
show up at the hospital?

515
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,584
That's not true.

516
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,726
I was with Shelley that night.

517
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:17,523
And I drove her to the hospital.

518
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,865
They wouldn't let her in to see you.

519
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,167
We both stayed up all night waiting for
you to get out of surgery.

520
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,270
It had been me,
and Shelley had been in an accident,

521
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,262
they would have had to hold me down
to keep me from seeing her.

522
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,002
She wasn't even that upset
when I did see her.

523
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:36,944
Come on, mom. Got to eat something.

524
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:39,046
We're going to go to therapy.

525
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:42,786
Oh, what's the point?

526
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:45,084
It's not like I'm ever going to walk again.

527
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,390
That's not true.

528
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,759
You just- you got to
have the right attitude.

529
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,694
Hon, I'm still going to be handicapped.

530
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:53,857
I mean, how am I supposed to
take care of myself?

531
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,462
I wish your grandmother was still alive.

532
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:01,405
And Larry, he's no good.

533
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:05,075
That's not true. Larry loves you.

534
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,508
You should marry Larry.

535
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:14,952
He's not going to marry me.
Not now. And you.

536
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:18,022
You're going to run off to college in
a few months and forget all about me.

537
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,786
I'm not going to run off to college, mom.

538
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,161
If you need me, I'm going to be here.

539
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:27,289
Just- don't guilt me into it.

540
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:33,096
Guilt? Sweetie, I'm not trying to guilt
you into anything.

541
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:35,732
Well, you know Shelley.

542
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,531
She had a lot of plans.

543
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,311
I guess that's part of the reason
why she broke up with me.

544
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,114
I wasn't ambitious enough.

545
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:49,444
That's funny, you're the one
that ended up leaving.

546
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,214
Well, I'm back now.

547
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,051
And to tell you the truth,
she's a big part of the reason why.

548
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,596
I guess I was kind of hoping
that one way or another

549
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,963
we'd find our way back to each other.

550
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:05,634
You know, I think you could.

551
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,539
You're a deputy now.

552
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:13,344
I mean, you, uh,
figure out how to put away this Ryan

553
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:17,178
and I think there could be a little hope.

554
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,200
Horizon Unlimited,

555
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,103
can I have the name and phone number
you're calling from please?

556
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:42,506
This is the Delmore County Sheriff's
dept in Meadville, California.

557
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:45,643
We have two people stranded in the snow
in sub freezing temperatures,

558
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,944
and we can't seem to locate them.

559
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,012
Stranded in what?

560
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,848
Snow. We got a blizzard here,
and I can't find these people,

561
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,751
and we wanted to see if there's some way
you could help us locate them.

562
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,320
They're calling from a number
we traced to your company.

563
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,956
Can you tell us which cell tower
their calls are coming from?

564
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,559
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I can't give that
information over the phone.

565
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,427
But they're stuck.

566
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,928
They could be freezing to death.

567
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:06,330
And I understand that.

568
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,066
But we don't know for sure you are
who you say you are.

569
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:12,603
So you're going to half to talk to
someone in our legal department.

570
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,238
Could I please?

571
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,373
Well, first
you have to talk to my manager.

572
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:18,102
Whatever it takes.

573
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,355
Sheriff's department.

574
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,222
Uh- uh- just- just a second.

575
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:41,694
Uh, hold- hold on. Can I help you?

576
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,435
I'm looking for your roommate,
Ryan Dunbar.

577
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,969
I don't really know where he is.

578
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,438
Do I smell marijuana?

579
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,605
Um, this is, uh--

580
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:53,542
I know who she is.
Hey Jeanette. Long time.

581
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:57,614
Yeah. Wow. You're a cop now?

582
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:58,849
Yeah, looks like.

583
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,851
Is Ryan in any trouble?

584
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,409
You might say that.

585
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:04,682
Uh, where's your stash, Wade?

586
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,956
Ryan go out and score some more?

587
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:09,485
Is that where he is right now?

588
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,954
I don't really know.

589
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:20,270
Uh... I don't know, there was this party
I was supposed to go to up in Pulaski,

590
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,004
I told Ryan about it.

591
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:24,872
I don't know, maybe...
maybe he went without me.

592
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:26,577
What kind of party?

593
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,341
Just a- just a party, you know.
Some people.

594
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,548
This guy Nathan, some friends of his.

595
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:34,483
Yeah, friends of yours too, right Wade?

596
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,110
Ah, that can't be good.

597
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:56,603
Think I should call the sheriff's again?
Shelley?

598
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:00,809
What's that?

599
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:02,606
What?

600
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,811
That. It sounds like a party.

601
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,117
You don't suppose it's possible that

602
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,745
we went in a circle and now
we're right back at Nathan’s, do you?

603
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,013
Why- maybe.

604
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:21,165
Ryan, it's them!

605
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:21,665
Are you sure- are you sure?

606
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,033
We're back by Nathan’s and
we didn't even know it.

607
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:26,236
Yes! Who else is having a party
on a night like this?

608
00:38:26,236 --> 00:38:29,262
Come on! Come on!

609
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,921
So then he's, like,
I want you to poop on the bed.

610
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,622
And I'm, like, what?

611
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:46,857
You got to be out of your mind.

612
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:47,524
Get out of here.

613
00:38:47,524 --> 00:38:51,620
No, it's true. He used that word, too.
He said poop.

614
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,632
Guy must be, like,
five years old in the head.

615
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:58,402
Yeah, well, he was,
like, sixty in the sack.

616
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,336
What a pervert.

617
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:06,777
Are you Nathan?

618
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:07,766
Yeah.

619
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:55,123
It's them. Those guys,
those skinheads we saw before.

620
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:04,462
They've got Eliot! No!

621
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,047
Wha- wha- wha- they still have Eliot!

622
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:17,877
Come on!

623
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:31,695
I can't seem to locate anyone in
our legal department right now.

624
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:32,562
It is five in the morning.

625
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:34,665
Five in the-- where exactly are you?

626
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,632
Florida.

627
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:38,435
Well, maybe you don't understand
the seriousness of the situation.

628
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,603
We have a thing called snow.

629
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,437
Do you know what I mean?

630
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:42,639
All right, there's no need to get snippy.

631
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,708
I understand this is
an emergency situation,

632
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,977
so I'm going to go ahead
and authorize us to give you

633
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,979
the information you need to find those p.

634
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,879
Thank you.

635
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,675
Him I met a couple of times.

636
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,648
I never partied with him,
just met him in passing is all.

637
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:02,989
And her?

638
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,395
I'm not going to jail, right?

639
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:08,723
I gave you my word.

640
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:16,500
I never saw her before tonight.

641
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:04,821
Hey, everybody.
This is, uh, Ryan and Shelley?

642
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:05,288
Yeah.

643
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:06,490
They're friends of Wade's.

644
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,293
Where is Wade? He owes me fifty bucks.

645
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:12,662
When did you ever have fifty bucks?

646
00:42:12,662 --> 00:42:14,097
I got my ways.

647
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:15,165
Is that coke?

648
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:19,903
Coke? I wouldn't touch that stuff
if my life depended on it.

649
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:22,269
Coke is for chicks and queers.

650
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,437
Okay.

651
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:29,468
So no coke, huh? Just meth?

652
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:40,047
Are you listening to me?

653
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:53,728
Get off me.

654
00:42:57,307 --> 00:43:02,712
Yeah. Yeah,
we were- we were all doing meth.

655
00:43:02,712 --> 00:43:04,441
Crystal meth. The good stuff.

656
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:09,145
Were you snorting it?
Smoking it? Both?

657
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,458
Well, some people like it one way,
some people like it the other.

658
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,619
But I don't go near the pipe myself.

659
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,118
I don't smoke anything.

660
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,693
I respect my body too much.

661
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,758
And they were doing it with you?

662
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,836
Well, not at first. She was upset.

663
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:32,742
About what?

664
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:33,834
How the hell would I know?

665
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,370
She wasn't too talkative.

666
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,547
Well, not at first.

667
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:39,606
I'm so glad I came!

668
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:10,310
Yeah, god dam! Hm, hm, I said damn.

669
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:12,015
All right, come here.

670
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:13,250
Let me- let me- let me see that.

671
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,017
Ryan.

672
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:16,987
What?
Come on, I just want to give it a try.

673
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,055
There you go.
Really quickly, not for you.

674
00:44:19,055 --> 00:44:22,292
Come on. It'll be okay.

675
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,351
Okay. It's your turn now.

676
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,472
I told you to take that one.

677
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:39,409
I told you to take that one. Jesus.

678
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:40,277
That one. How about- how about
giving me that one over here? Come on.

679
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:43,146
You're fucking' crazy.
No more. Here you go.

680
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:43,880
Oh, thank you.

681
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,349
Right there. Not too much.

682
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:47,179
Okay.

683
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:00,197
You're stupid.
Ow.

684
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,164
All right, well you give it a try.

685
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:01,965
Yeah, right.
Come on.?

686
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:02,966
Yeah, right.
What?

687
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:03,833
Yeah, right.

688
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:04,367
Yeah? Pussy.

689
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:06,336
You don't want any?

690
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,327
Well, I don't- I don't know.

691
00:45:10,373 --> 00:45:12,209
Okay, you need to slow down.

692
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,733
You're doing too much.

693
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,771
Hm.

694
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:21,084
Oh, yeah. Oh!

695
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:24,247
Look what you did. You're crazy.

696
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:28,091
Come on, just- just a little.

697
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:28,525
No.

698
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,426
Just a little bit.

699
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,494
Oh! Get out of the way!
Okay.

700
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:32,662
I'll get out of the way.
Okay.

701
00:45:32,662 --> 00:45:33,897
Professional is in the house.

702
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,466
No. Yeah, right. Whatever.

703
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:38,868
Okay, do the knife thing, or whatever.

704
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:40,003
Come on, do the knife thing.

705
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,805
Do the knife thing. Just do it.

706
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,273
Okay, little one.

707
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,674
I'm doing a little one.

708
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:45,642
Little one. Little girl one.

709
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:46,910
Little girl one. A little girl one.

710
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,777
I'm doing a very,
very little- here you go.

711
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:48,979
This looks so dirty right now.

712
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,844
Go ahead.

713
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:52,882
Oh!

714
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:55,373
It burns!
You- you missed about half of it.

715
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,887
There you go. There you go.

716
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,055
There, I finally did it.

717
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:00,490
You- almost.

718
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,718
All right, do it again.

719
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,257
You're wasted. Wasted.

720
00:46:06,129 --> 00:46:07,221
I'm not going to--

721
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,432
I'm really hot right now.

722
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:10,834
She's wasted.

723
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,301
All right.

724
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:15,939
You're so awful.

725
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,307
Oh my god.

726
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,172
See? See?

727
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,245
Well, that was it, you know?

728
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,247
Once he did a little,
he started doing a lot.

729
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:58,915
What do you mean a lot?

730
00:46:58,915 --> 00:47:01,318
I mean a lot, for two.

731
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,752
Really smoothed her out, too.

732
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:04,879
She started getting real friendly.

733
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:13,163
Used to always tell me,

734
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,965
but I never believed them because
I never thought I was pretty enough.

735
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:18,535
But, dude, they used to always say that.
High five.

736
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:21,304
Yes. Yes. That's right. That's mine.

737
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:22,172
Hi- you

738
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,573
That's mine.
You--

739
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:26,142
Um, I was going to go take a-
I was going to go- did you know that?

740
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:26,776
You didn't even know this.

741
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:28,211
I was going to go take acting class
when I went down to college,

742
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:31,214
but then I never went to college,
I never took acting class.

743
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:31,715
But you know what?

744
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,450
I am totally going to go down to L.A.,

745
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,884
and I'm totally going to
try to do the whole-

746
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:37,821
the whole acting carpet magazine thing,

747
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:40,623
because, like, hi, hi,
I could totally do it.

748
00:47:40,623 --> 00:47:41,725
I think you could.

749
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,625
I think you would be a great actress.
I do.

750
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,228
I know, right? I know.

751
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:47,664
This talent is going to waste,
you know what I'm saying?

752
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,100
This talent, ready to blow up.

753
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,101
Screw it.

754
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,569
Let's make out.
Yeah.

755
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,072
I mean, I'm a first rate mechanic, man.

756
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:57,273
You give me something electrical
that's broken,

757
00:47:57,273 --> 00:47:59,909
I'm going to put that sucker back together
in no time. Swear.

758
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:00,477
I'll prove it to you.

759
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:01,378
You give me something right now.

760
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:01,978
Give me your toaster.

761
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:02,579
You got a toaster?

762
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,413
You give me your toaster,

763
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,981
I will take that sucker apart
and I will put it back together,

764
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:06,783
and you won't believe how goddamned good
that toast tastes.

765
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:10,553
Seriously. Seriously.
I swear, man. Seriously.

766
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:11,354
My toaster's fine.

767
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:12,378
I'm hot in here.

768
00:48:39,048 --> 00:48:41,151
Mmm, snookers.

769
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,419
Angel cheeks.

770
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,686
You're so pretty.

771
00:48:43,686 --> 00:48:45,355
You're pretty. You're pretty.

772
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,879
You're pretty. You're pretty.

773
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:48,925
Hey, it's snowing like hell.

774
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,427
Why is it snowing so damn much?

775
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,625
Global warming.
Beautiful, isn't it? Stop it.

776
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:28,398
And it was your impression that
she'd never done it before?

777
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,026
That's how it looked to me. Him too.

778
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,236
So why didn't you warn them?

779
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,931
Warn them about what?

780
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,841
All right, I told you, let me be alone.
Jeez.

781
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:40,241
Well, you must have known that
they were doing too much.

782
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,643
You definitely knew that
there was a blizzard outside.

783
00:49:44,714 --> 00:49:46,181
So why didn't you tell them not to leave?

784
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,048
Well, I tried. We all did.

785
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:52,054
But they wouldn't listen.

786
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:57,749
So we just packed them a little
something for the road and off they went.

787
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:00,159
You mean that you gave them some more?

788
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:03,523
We figured it was a friendly thing to do.

789
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,193
Nine-one-one emergency.

790
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,694
They got my kid.

791
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:32,962
I'm sorry?

792
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:33,897
The skinheads.

793
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:35,598
They're torturing people.

794
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:36,966
They almost got me and Shelley.

795
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:38,067
Ryan, is that you?

796
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:40,236
I can barely hear you.
You got to speak up.

797
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:42,005
Okay. They might hear me.

798
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,206
Who might hear you?

799
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,141
The skinheads.

800
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:46,175
They're all around us.

801
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:48,111
You mean all around the truck?

802
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,446
No. We're not in the truck.

803
00:50:50,446 --> 00:50:53,550
Ryan, you're not outside, are you?

804
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,386
You can't be outside.
You'll freeze to death.

805
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,150
We can't move. They have us trapped.

806
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:01,824
Ryan, listen to me very carefully.

807
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:04,060
Nobody's got you trapped.
You're imagining things.

808
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,530
No. No. No. No, no, we saw them.

809
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,499
They were- they were torturing people.

810
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:12,068
They almost got Shelley.

811
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,704
Where is Shelley?
Can I speak to Shelley please?

812
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:19,108
Shh. Hey. Hey.
They want to talk to you.

813
00:51:19,108 --> 00:51:21,344
You think you can?

814
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,012
Okay. Hello?

815
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:24,647
Shelley.

816
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:26,616
You guys have got to get back
in the truck and stay there.

817
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:29,252
Do you understand?
We spoke to Ryan's cell phone company.

818
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:32,188
It looks like he's got
his GPS turned off.

819
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:33,256
Why- I don't- what? What?

820
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,324
GPS.

821
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,224
Help the cell phone company trace...

822
00:51:35,224 --> 00:51:39,718
Please, send somebody to get us.
Cold. Please.

823
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,497
Skinheads?

824
00:51:41,497 --> 00:51:42,765
That's what they said.

825
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:46,302
But they promised they would get back
inside the truck and stay there.

826
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:47,804
Who'd you speak to, him or her?

827
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,396
Both.

828
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,307
How'd she sound?

829
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:54,834
Pretty coherent,
considering how much she's done.

830
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:09,926
Shelley?

831
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,258
It's me. I got bad news.

832
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:16,529
Shelley's on drugs and she's running
around outside in the snow.

833
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,351
It's not there!

834
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,028
Someone took my car away.

835
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,030
Are you sure that's where it was?

836
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,731
Yeah, yeah, pretty sure.

837
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:50,700
They must have dragged it out of
the ditch and taken it away.

838
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,395
Larry?

839
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,137
What was that?

840
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:54,971
What? What?

841
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,634
Shelley, are you out here? Answer me!

842
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:00,677
Mom, you--

843
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,112
What in the world do you
think you're doing?

844
00:53:03,112 --> 00:53:05,910
I've been worried half to death.

845
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:08,518
Mom, you can walk!

846
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,153
Well, of course I'm walking fine.

847
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:12,417
I always could.

848
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,024
I was going to walk right out of this town,

849
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:16,559
but then I got pregnant with you, and--

850
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,762
You were faking to keep me here
this whole time?

851
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:21,898
Well, you kept me here.

852
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,901
You think I've never had
any dreams of my own?

853
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:28,971
So why shouldn't I strand you
the way you stranded me?

854
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:32,372
You bitch! I'll kill you!

855
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,584
No, Shelley! Shelley, relax!

856
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:42,819
Hey! Hey!

857
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,387
It's me!
Who were you talking to?

858
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,822
My mother.

859
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:46,622
What?

860
00:53:46,622 --> 00:53:48,988
Ryan, she lied.

861
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,161
Calm down.

862
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:54,630
Hey, hey! I think I found the car.

863
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:57,100
It's right over there.
It's going to be okay.

864
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,624
All right?

865
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:19,346
I've got them. I've got the truck.

866
00:54:37,673 --> 00:54:39,834
Shelley!

867
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,403
Shelley!

868
00:54:52,955 --> 00:54:55,116
That's not your car.

869
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,194
You think anybody lives here?

870
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,185
Would you?

871
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:08,271
Hello in there! Hello?

872
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,603
Hello?

873
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,084
Come on. Oh...

874
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,129
Whoa.

875
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:52,515
It's a kitchen.

876
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,982
Yeah.

877
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:21,426
Come on. Help me out.

878
00:57:36,185 --> 00:57:37,553
Give me your, uh, your lighter.

879
00:57:37,553 --> 00:57:39,214
Yeah. Hold on.

880
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,426
Ryan, I can't find it.

881
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,727
Oh, come on, don't tell me you lost it.

882
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,786
Didn't you see me with it?

883
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,000
Ha. There.

884
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,934
Come on, turn.

885
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,642
Maybe it's.

886
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,337
Dammed.

887
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,076
It's okay.

888
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,156
What is it?

889
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:34,577
It's about time.

890
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,212
Is Eliot okay? Is he there with you?

891
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:37,046
Eliot?

892
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,514
Since when did you ever
give a damn about Eliot?

893
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:39,682
Come on, is he there with you or not?

894
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,851
Yes, of course.

895
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,652
And do you know where we are?

896
00:58:43,652 --> 00:58:44,720
Your place.

897
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,356
Hey, you wouldn't answer your phone
so I came over looking for you.

898
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:49,859
And you'll never guess who stopped up.

899
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:50,493
Who?

900
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,862
Bruce Davis, that's who.

901
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,197
And he's a deputy sheriff now.

902
00:58:55,197 --> 00:58:56,599
And he arrested Wade.

903
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:57,867
What for?

904
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,165
Possession.

905
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,573
I thought he was going to
arrest me too, but he didn't.

906
00:59:04,573 --> 00:59:08,044
But he is going to haul your ass in
as soon as they find you.

907
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,246
What- what- wait- wait- what- what for?
What did I do?

908
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,481
Well, it's your trailer too, right?

909
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:18,010
You're both going down for possession,
and I couldn't be happier.

910
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:21,021
Hello?

911
00:59:21,924 --> 00:59:23,926
Hello?

912
00:59:23,926 --> 00:59:27,521
Ryan,
I know you did not just hang up on me.

913
00:59:29,665 --> 00:59:31,360
I'm in trouble.

914
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,465
Why- why? What do you mean?

915
01:00:05,434 --> 01:00:07,561
I'm not getting any answer.

916
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:09,738
The phone's gone dead?

917
01:00:09,738 --> 01:00:10,773
Well, it's ringing,

918
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,110
and usually when a phone goes dead
it goes straight to voice mail.

919
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,670
And he never turned on his GPS?

920
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,181
I'll check again with
his cell phone company,

921
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:21,843
but no, I don't think he ever did.

922
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,887
Ready?

923
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,724
Yeah.
I- I really appreciate this, Larry.

924
01:00:28,724 --> 01:00:32,328
Know. You know what?
We're going to find her.

925
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,727
Okay.

926
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:17,432
Mm.

927
01:01:20,609 --> 01:01:22,804
You want some?

928
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:25,881
Well, I am. May as well.

929
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:27,940
I'm going to jail anyway.

930
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,785
No.

931
01:01:29,785 --> 01:01:34,051
I'm not going to let them take you
somewhere I can't be with you.

932
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:37,287
You really do love me, don't you?

933
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:40,257
You have to ask?

934
01:01:41,263 --> 01:01:43,799
I guess a small part of me
never believed it.

935
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:47,169
I mean, come on, you're just so perfect,
and I'm- I'm a screw up.

936
01:01:47,169 --> 01:01:49,933
I am so not perfect.

937
01:01:50,372 --> 01:01:53,075
That was the problem with me and Keith,
you know?

938
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:57,535
He was perfect. I was just bored.

939
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,616
I needed trouble, Ryan Dunbar.

940
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:03,219
Trouble? I gave you that.

941
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,916
Oh, trouble's not the right word.

942
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:10,926
I needed excitement, you know?

943
01:02:10,926 --> 01:02:14,196
Something, anything, just to feel alive.

944
01:02:14,196 --> 01:02:16,630
Yeah, tell me about it.

945
01:02:17,499 --> 01:02:21,629
Why can't they just leave us alone?
You know?

946
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:28,611
I love you, you love me,
should be simple, right?

947
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:29,845
But no.

948
01:02:29,845 --> 01:02:33,212
Ever since we go together
they've been trying to break us up.

949
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:36,018
I mean, marriages break up.

950
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,486
What's the big deal?

951
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:38,721
Especially if they're mistakes
to begin with.

952
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,823
Exactly.

953
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:45,094
Why can't they just live
their lives and let us be happy?

954
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,662
They're jealous.

955
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:47,529
Oh yeah?

956
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:48,163
Yeah.

957
01:02:48,163 --> 01:02:49,531
Of what?

958
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:53,262
Because you and I haven't given up,
like they have.

959
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,473
Is that the sheriff?

960
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:58,474
That's got to be the sheriff.

961
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,909
Ryan, we have to answer that.

962
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:01,510
Hello?

963
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:04,179
Shelley?
Thank god, I thought you were dead.

964
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:05,714
You're not taking Ryan away from me.

965
01:03:05,714 --> 01:03:07,739
Nobody said they were.

966
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:11,387
I swear, just tell me where you are.

967
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,822
Tell me that you're someplace safe,
inside.

968
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:16,592
We're- we're out in those camps,

969
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:19,495
where people take their kids out
in the country.

970
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:20,229
Inside?

971
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:22,131
Yeah. But there's no heat.

972
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,900
There's a fireplace,
but we can't get a fire started.

973
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,069
That's all she said, they're in a camp?

974
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,538
There's at least ten of those places
in this county alone.

975
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:31,273
Well, she also said
there was a van outside.

976
01:03:31,273 --> 01:03:33,475
Does that help at all?

977
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:34,476
Not really.

978
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:36,478
They can't have gotten that far on foot,

979
01:03:36,478 --> 01:03:39,648
and the truck is...
where'd you find it again?

980
01:03:39,648 --> 01:03:41,250
Meridian Way. Out.

981
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:41,917
You heard that, right?

982
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:43,111
Yep. Hang on.

983
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:51,193
We're not going to get stuck, are we?

984
01:03:51,193 --> 01:03:52,785
Don't worry about it.

985
01:03:59,134 --> 01:04:00,569
Frank Van nick.

986
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:01,537
What?

987
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:02,738
Do you remember Frank Van nick?

988
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,741
He- the guy who used to be the bartender
at The Red Line a few years back?

989
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:06,608
He's bald, kind of stocky?

990
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:07,876
Used to come on to you quite a bit?

991
01:04:07,876 --> 01:04:08,877
Yeah, he did.

992
01:04:08,877 --> 01:04:09,978
And you used to encourage him?

993
01:04:09,978 --> 01:04:10,879
No, I didn't.

994
01:04:10,879 --> 01:04:11,814
Yeah, you did.

995
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,682
Uh, can we not get into this?

996
01:04:13,682 --> 01:04:14,750
Did you sleep with him?

997
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,152
No, but I think he had a van.
Didn't he?

998
01:04:17,152 --> 01:04:18,220
I have no idea.

999
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,722
No, remember? He had a van.

1000
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,223
It used to break down all the time.

1001
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:22,925
I think he got a job out
at Camp Castanoan,

1002
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,593
and he was a caretaker or something.

1003
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:25,861
How- how many times
did you sleep with him?

1004
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:26,895
I didn't sleep with him.

1005
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:28,197
But I think that's where they are.

1006
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,566
I bet they're at Camp Castanoan.

1007
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:31,767
Can I use your phone?

1008
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:32,968
Why, so you can call him?

1009
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:36,267
No, smart ass, so I can call the sheriff.

1010
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:58,460
What was that?

1011
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,155
Let me see.

1012
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:06,366
No, no, no, no, just stay there.
Stay there.

1013
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:27,355
We're surrounded!
We got to get out of here! Come on!

1014
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:43,238
Oh, no.

1015
01:05:43,238 --> 01:05:44,227
Oh!

1016
01:05:45,674 --> 01:05:48,142
Freeze! You're under arrest.

1017
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:51,413
Bruce! Hush.

1018
01:05:51,413 --> 01:05:54,246
Bruce, oh my god,
I'm so glad to see you.

1019
01:05:55,317 --> 01:05:56,750
Shot!

1020
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,687
Ryan, baby, baby! Baby!

1021
01:06:01,089 --> 01:06:02,925
No. No. No.

1022
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:06,728
Look, you see?
You see what you did to me?

1023
01:06:06,728 --> 01:06:08,630
No. No. No!

1024
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,121
Shelley! Hey! Come on!

1025
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:17,773
What? oh! No! Did to me!

1026
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:20,309
No! Ryan! Ryan!

1027
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,970
Look, you see?

1028
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:35,777
Did you find her?

1029
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:36,712
No.

1030
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,447
They were here,
but they're not here now.

1031
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,780
Oh my god. Oh my god.

1032
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:42,584
Don't panic.

1033
01:08:42,584 --> 01:08:43,819
She's been drinking.

1034
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,421
Shut up!
My daughter's going to freeze to death

1035
01:08:46,421 --> 01:08:48,490
and you're giving me crap about drinking?

1036
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:49,691
Geez, why would they leave?

1037
01:08:49,691 --> 01:08:52,661
I don't know, but they're on foot
so they couldn't have gotten far.

1038
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:54,196
Yeah.
This is all my fault.

1039
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:55,497
You know,
you're really not helping, Gayle.

1040
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:58,200
You have no idea what I'm going through.

1041
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,035
I know better than you do, Gayle.

1042
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:01,803
You know what else?

1043
01:09:01,803 --> 01:09:03,828
This is your fault.

1044
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:08,276
She wouldn't be in this mess
if she'd stayed with me.

1045
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:12,214
You were the one
that came between me and Shelley.

1046
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,850
You did everything
you could to break us up.

1047
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,478
You did everything you could.

1048
01:09:20,288 --> 01:09:21,778
Sorry.

1049
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,791
I like that kid.

1050
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,241
Give me a second.

1051
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:48,813
Just give me a second.

1052
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:49,618
I'm burning up.

1053
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,781
Suddenly... so tired.

1054
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,181
Have no choice.

1055
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,561
You lied to us.

1056
01:09:59,561 --> 01:10:00,395
I'm sorry?

1057
01:10:00,395 --> 01:10:02,531
You said you weren't going to arrest me,
but you are.

1058
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,832
You're with them.

1059
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:04,900
With who?

1060
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,170
The skinheads, my wife,
Bruce, you're all in this together.

1061
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:08,970
Ryan, listen to me.

1062
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:11,406
No! You listen to me.

1063
01:10:11,406 --> 01:10:13,575
We do not need your help anymore.

1064
01:10:13,575 --> 01:10:14,242
We'll find our way out ourselves.

1065
01:10:14,242 --> 01:10:17,212
Ryan, please, we're just trying to get
the state to[unintelligible].

1066
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:19,407
Don't call anymore.

1067
01:10:32,994 --> 01:10:35,397
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1068
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,331
Hey, come on.

1069
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:38,834
No, Ryan. I need to sleep.

1070
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,435
I want to sleep.

1071
01:10:40,435 --> 01:10:43,305
I know. I do, okay.

1072
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:44,239
We can't sleep.

1073
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,373
They're going to find us.

1074
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:46,675
Just a little longer. No.

1075
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:47,242
Come on.

1076
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:47,876
Ryan, there's snow up here.
There's more.

1077
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:54,049
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. I got you.

1078
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:58,754
Just...
Okay. Just trust me.

1079
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,688
I'll get you out of here.

1080
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,860
Come on. Come on.

1081
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:09,456
Just help me out.
Stand up. Almost done.

1082
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:14,536
He's right, you know.

1083
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,766
Who's right?

1084
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:21,143
Bruce.
I did come between him and Shelley.

1085
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:23,612
I'm the one who set her up with Keith.

1086
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,815
Yeah, I remember.
Never quite understand that one.

1087
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,551
I mean, Keith was a -- well,

1088
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:32,320
Let’s just say he wasn't exactly
going to set the world on fire.

1089
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,123
Exactly. He wasn't going anywhere.

1090
01:11:35,123 --> 01:11:37,785
Just a small town boy, you know?

1091
01:11:38,059 --> 01:11:41,296
But with Bruce, Shelley had him wrapped
around her little finger,

1092
01:11:41,296 --> 01:11:46,134
and l... guess I was afraid one day
she'd talk him into leaving.

1093
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:51,439
So yeah, I did everything
I could to break them up.

1094
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:54,067
You're that scared of losing her.

1095
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:57,946
She's all I have.

1096
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,081
Well, you still have her.

1097
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:02,242
I hope.

1098
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:06,588
You had me too, you know.

1099
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:08,890
I loved you, Gayle.

1100
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:11,760
Guess in a kind of strange way,
I still do.

1101
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,895
But you threw me away.

1102
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:16,031
You didn't want to be with me.
Not after the accident.

1103
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,099
That's a lie and you know it.

1104
01:12:18,099 --> 01:12:19,501
It didn't matter to me.

1105
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,493
I would have stayed with you
no matter what.

1106
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:26,741
I know.

1107
01:12:26,741 --> 01:12:29,266
So then why?

1108
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:33,014
Shelley.

1109
01:12:33,014 --> 01:12:36,585
As long as I had you,
she knew she could leave.

1110
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,086
You know,
I had someone to take care of me.

1111
01:12:38,086 --> 01:12:39,888
If I didn't have you...

1112
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,356
Then she'd have to stick around.

1113
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:46,786
That's how badly
I wanted to hang on to her.

1114
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:50,332
I've never admitted this to anyone.

1115
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,367
May- probably not even myself.

1116
01:12:52,367 --> 01:12:55,937
But, after the accident,

1117
01:12:55,937 --> 01:12:59,998
I think I knew I'd found a way
to keep her with me.

1118
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,479
I always figured that's what happened.

1119
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:06,344
I'm sorry.

1120
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:13,585
Well, it stopped snowing.

1121
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:30,005
Rest ye merry cheating wives,
and nothing you dismay.

1122
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:38,470
For that won't be a problem
if you never would have strayed.

1123
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:55,163
Look out!

1124
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:57,265
I'm looking! I'm- I'm- I'm looking.

1125
01:13:57,265 --> 01:14:00,068
No, you're not. You're exhausted.

1126
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,737
Come on,
we're getting loaded up on coffee.

1127
01:14:02,737 --> 01:14:07,071
Yeah? Your place or mine?

1128
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,772
Neither.

1129
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,803
I'm so hot.

1130
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,075
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

1131
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,310
Okay. Okay.

1132
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:54,622
Ryan?

1133
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:55,557
Hey.

1134
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,286
Ryan?

1135
01:14:58,326 --> 01:15:00,760
Will you marry me?

1136
01:15:01,896 --> 01:15:05,354
Of course. Of course.

1137
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,394
No, I mean now.

1138
01:15:08,703 --> 01:15:10,572
We don't need anybody to tell us
we're married,

1139
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:13,006
just as long as we believe it.

1140
01:15:15,443 --> 01:15:19,072
Then- then we're married.

1141
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:23,084
Okay. Come on. Okay.

1142
01:15:23,084 --> 01:15:24,853
I don't want to die in--
Come on.

1143
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,454
What? No.

1144
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:28,023
No, you're not going to die.

1145
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,650
You're not going to die.

1146
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:34,362
But I'll die a married woman.

1147
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:41,302
Wait!

1148
01:15:41,302 --> 01:15:43,668
Oh! Come on. Come on.

1149
01:15:51,646 --> 01:15:52,447
Hold- hold on.

1150
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,283
Hey! Hey, look! Look, it's a house!

1151
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:58,186
You see it? Oh, we're saved!

1152
01:15:58,186 --> 01:15:59,721
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

1153
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,022
We don't know who's in that house, okay?

1154
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:02,090
They could be waiting for us.

1155
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,591
They could be waiting to kill us.

1156
01:16:03,591 --> 01:16:05,927
No. No. I'm going to go check it out.

1157
01:16:05,927 --> 01:16:08,496
I'm going to check it out.
And- and- and when I come back,

1158
01:16:08,496 --> 01:16:10,726
if it's safe I'm going to get you.

1159
01:16:11,232 --> 01:16:11,633
What?

1160
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:15,303
No, just- give me your phone,
and, and call me if it's safe.

1161
01:16:15,303 --> 01:16:16,235
Okay.

1162
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,479
Lynn, what's happening?

1163
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:58,413
We spoke to state.

1164
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:01,116
We might be able to get some search and
rescue teams out there in about an hour.

1165
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,084
An hour? They can't get
anybody sooner than that?

1166
01:17:03,084 --> 01:17:04,252
I tried to get them sooner.

1167
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:06,087
That's the best they could do.

1168
01:17:06,087 --> 01:17:07,989
And Shelley hasn't called you?

1169
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:09,524
I think they turned
their phones off again.

1170
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,526
They haven't picked up
the last few times I called.

1171
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,460
What's the number?

1172
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:22,126
Ow. Oh.

1173
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:32,944
Oh.

1174
01:17:36,317 --> 01:17:37,909
No.

1175
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,891
Ryan! Is it safe?

1176
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:44,759
Shelley, it's Bruce.

1177
01:17:44,759 --> 01:17:47,996
Oh. Why are you calling Ryan's phone?

1178
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,198
I can't- I can't wait- I can't tell you

1179
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,500
how happy I am to hear your voice,
Shelley.

1180
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,301
Where are you?

1181
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:55,403
I'm- I'm- um, we found a house,

1182
01:17:55,403 --> 01:17:57,705
and I'm waiting for Ryan
to see if it's safe.

1183
01:17:57,705 --> 01:17:59,274
He left you there alone?

1184
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:04,234
He had to. There are all these people
chasing after us, Bruce.

1185
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:07,782
He's the one that
you need to worry about.

1186
01:18:07,782 --> 01:18:11,019
You would not be in this position
if it wasn't for him.

1187
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,820
You don't know what you're talking about.

1188
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:15,490
No, I know that I love you, Shelley.

1189
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:18,050
I know that I've always loved you.

1190
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:23,932
I thought that if I went away,
that I'd stop thinking about you.

1191
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,196
But I never did.

1192
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:31,070
And I've been looking for you
for a long time before tonight.

1193
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,541
It's too late.

1194
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:35,566
It's not too late.

1195
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,580
I'm going to find you.

1196
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:42,016
I'm going to find you,
and I'm going to take care of you.

1197
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:45,153
Whatever you want me to be, I'll be.

1198
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,822
You want to leave this place,
then we'll leave.

1199
01:18:47,822 --> 01:18:49,691
I'm not going anywhere without Ryan.

1200
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:52,894
But you deserve
so much better than that!

1201
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,920
Few years ago you wouldn't
have gone near him.

1202
01:18:56,464 --> 01:18:58,299
I was a different person then, Bruce.

1203
01:18:58,299 --> 01:19:02,937
That person died.
Everything dies in this town.

1204
01:19:02,937 --> 01:19:05,440
Ryan brought me back to life again.

1205
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,642
Shelley!

1206
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:09,777
Come here, Shelley! It's okay!

1207
01:19:09,777 --> 01:19:11,312
There's somebody calling.

1208
01:19:11,312 --> 01:19:12,880
Who?

1209
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,681
I can't tell.

1210
01:19:13,681 --> 01:19:17,276
Shelley, it's okay! Ryan's with me.

1211
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:19,420
Oh, Bruce, I got to go.

1212
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,722
Shelley, stay on the phone!

1213
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:22,056
Don't hang up. Just stay with me.

1214
01:19:22,056 --> 01:19:23,524
It's okay, Ryan's safe.

1215
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:24,559
Shelley, don't you understand?

1216
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:26,857
He's never going to be safe.

1217
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:30,657
'Course I know. That's why I love him.

1218
01:19:58,459 --> 01:20:00,484
Shelley!

1219
01:20:00,828 --> 01:20:03,661
Come here, Shelley! It's okay!

1220
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:25,045
Miranda.

1221
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:34,227
It's okay.

1222
01:20:35,496 --> 01:20:36,097
You're bleeding!

1223
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,530
It's okay.

1224
01:20:39,233 --> 01:20:40,902
How's Ryan? Is he safe?

1225
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:42,737
Come here. Yeah, he's inside.

1226
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:47,674
I was lying in bed, and-- oh no!
Oh, god.

1227
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,439
I was lying in bed, and.

1228
01:20:58,319 --> 01:20:59,387
Poor baby.

1229
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:03,458
He walked in, sat down,
and a second later he passed out.

1230
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:04,492
It's been a long night.

1231
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:05,927
Listen to me.

1232
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:06,994
We're going to have to
take you to the doctor.

1233
01:21:06,994 --> 01:21:09,030
No. They'll just call the sheriff.

1234
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,098
What are you talking about?

1235
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,132
Are you guys in some kind of trouble?

1236
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:12,533
We were, but we're find now.

1237
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:14,057
Shelley!

1238
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,605
Baby.

1239
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:20,233
Oh, hey sweetheart.

1240
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:23,568
I'll get you a blanket.

1241
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,784
What are we going to do?

1242
01:21:33,354 --> 01:21:39,156
We're going to rest here a little bit,
and then we're going to leave.

1243
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,630
We're going to leave for good, okay?

1244
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:44,393
Yeah.

1245
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:49,931
And we're always going to be together.

1246
01:21:51,205 --> 01:21:52,797
We are.
