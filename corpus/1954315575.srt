- Yeah.
- How'd it go?

30
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,851
It fucking sucked, Bob.

31
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,844
My heart goes out to you.

32
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,165
You have my carburetor?

33
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,606
Yeah, it's right over there
on the counter.

34
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,366
Good to see you, too, buddy.

35
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,931
Ah, hold it.
Not so fast.

36
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,287
God damn it.

37
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,323
You owe me 60 bucks.

38
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,403
- That's 50 bucks.
- That's all I got, Bob.

39
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,123
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you, too, buddy.

40
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,569
Jesus Christ.
Un-fucking-believable.

41
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,530
Thatta boy.
She is back to life.

42
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,489
Good boy.

43
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,448
Crazy old fuck.

44
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,806
I got a question for you.

45
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,681
You ever hear of a guy's name
who's Robert Wolf?

46
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,802
Toss me the brake cleaner.

47
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,680
Who's asking?

48
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,049
Couple of suits.

49
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,407
Said they were federal agents.

50
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,087
The only Bob I know is you.

51
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,804
Why don't you shut up and listen?

52
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,962
This case has been
floundering for six months.

53
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,804
You dropped the ball.
I'm sending Williams.

54
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,000
Williams is a robot.
Nobody likes him.

55
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,322
Yeah, he's gonna hold your hand.

56
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,324
Just stay put.
Don't have an original thought.

57
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,642
- Hey, Al.
- Hey, Joe.

58
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,564
You look like shit.

59
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,450
So what do you got?

60
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,568
Our perp is Robert Wolf.

61
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,570
He's a native
from the Mojave reservation.

62
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,764
He comes off the reservation
and kills this Charles...

63
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,491
- Grigsby.
- That's right. With a rock.

64
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,523
Schaeffer is too close to this.

65
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,524
He can't see the forest
for the trees.

66
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,160
That's why I need you to go
down there and take care of this.

67
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,603
I can smell you from here, son.

68
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,646
Thanks, Pops.

69
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,842
Make yourself useful and bring over
a piece of that dacite.

70
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,166
- What are you making?
- Same old, same old.

71
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,124
Making blades.

72
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,607
Yeah? Let me see.

73
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,001
Here you go.

74
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,529
So where you been?

75
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,284
Up in the Sierras mostly.

76
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,082
How you taking care of yourself?

77
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,041
Find a couple odd jobs.

78
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,567
Helps me get by.

79
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,242
You know, you look
like shit, boy.

80
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,561
Yeah, feel like shit, Dad.

81
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,561
Well, go in and get yourself
cleaned up.

82
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,404
Go get yourself
something to eat.

83
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,085
Yeah.

84
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,770
Have the feds been here?

85
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,491
Not since the funeral.

86
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,008
How was the ceremony?

87
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,246
Good.

88
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,129
She was loved by many.

89
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,923
Have you seen your sister?

90
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,287
No.

91
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,563
I haven't seen her or Irish.

92
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,281
I told you what would happen.

93
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,924
Yes, you did.

94
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,371
And we tried it your way
and look where it got us.

95
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,363
And look at what
your actions got you.

96
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,966
I couldn't let him walk free.

97
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,407
You're not the law.

98
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,722
No, I'm not.

99
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,690
But when justice isn't served,
then what, Dad?

100
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,640
And your justice,
what has it given you?

101
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,685
When they catch you,
it'll be life.

102
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,726
I'm here for Mom's ashes.

103
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,769
I want to take her back
to where her life began.

104
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,009
I want to take her
so she can start her journey.

105
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,730
That's why I'm here.

106
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,003
Her ashes are with your sister.

107
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,210
Son, come with me to honor her.

108
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,327
Yeah.

109
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,890
Well, first up, I guess, in turning over
six months of my hard work,

110
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,250
take you up here
to the site of the murder.

111
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,683
Take you through it
as best I can.

112
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,561
Here it is on the left.
1402 Shithole Street.

113
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,329
This is where it all went down.

114
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,681
Well, this is where is happened.

115
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,888
Chuck Grigsby's last stand.

116
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,088
He lived in this palace here.

117
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,723
Wolf got all done up
in the war paint.

118
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,168
Found red and black everywhere.
That's the Mojave's colors.

119
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,890
Then Wolf had that dacite club knife
thing that he'd made.

120
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,522
Beat the scalp right off of him
there in the house.

121
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,001
Charlie goes boogeying
through here,

122
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,441
blood all in his face.

123
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,409
Wolf caught up to him,

124
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,246
beat every bone
in that guy's body

125
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,050
from his toes to his sternum.

126
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,928
Turned the guy into a maraca.

127
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,088
What a fucking way to go.

128
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,685
Too good for him.
Piece of shit deserved it.

129
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,090
Anyway, he...

130
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,803
Hello?

131
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,766

Is that your bike?

145
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,560
It's a nice bike.

146
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,883
You're bleeding.

147
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,042
Yeah.

148
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,164
I was teaching someone how to fight.

149
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,721
You should probably go
get that looked at.

150
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,929
Nah.

151
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,121
You know how to play that thing
or you just carry it around for show?

152
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,964
It's for show.

153
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,203
Come on down here
and have a drink with me.

154
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,684
Hey, here.
Hold this, brother.

155
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,241
Help yourself.

156
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,364
They say if you drink enough
bourbon, you'll have a time travel.

157
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,761
Excuse me?

158
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,968
You go into the...

159
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,361
...the future.

160
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,489
I used to be in a band,
but not anymore.

161
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,563
I'm sorry, what?

162
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,530
I play music, too.

163
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,251
Here.

164
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,006
Oh, thanks, man.

165
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,404
You got someone
you can call, get you home?

166
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,325
Mm-hmm.

167
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,245
Mmm.

168
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,324
Ah, the future.

169
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,490
Morning, sunshine.

170
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,644
How's the head?

171
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,883
What happened?
What'd I do?

172
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,088
I'm sorry.

173
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,609
Will you help me find my bike?

174
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,364
Yeah.

175
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,408
Thanks.

176
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,249
So, Bob.

177
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,886
When's the last time
you saw old Robert Wolf?

178
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,008
I told you before,
I don't know him.

179
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,041
Yeah, well, I brought you a picture
this time to help with your memory.

180
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,605
You seen him now?

181
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,127
I don't know him,
so I ain't seen him.

182
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,123
Uh-uh-uh.

183
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,443
Don't touch the fucking car, man.

184
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,287
Got to tell your dog to stop
snooping around in my garage.

185
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,363
I will, Bob.

186
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,205
Hey, what happened to the Panhead
that was here a couple days ago?

187
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,170
I put a new carburetor
into it yesterday

188
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,651
and the client came and picked it up.

189
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,802
Yeah? When was that?

190
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,883
Yesterday.

191
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,405
What was the client's name?

192
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,126
I don't recall.

193
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,281
What'd he look like?

194
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,244
Don't recall that, either.

195
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,966
God damn it, Bob.

196
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,043
You're gonna have to start
recalling something.

197
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,890
I'm a federal agent.

198
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,646
Do you want to go back inside?
You're on parole.

199
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,246
I'll make a call.
You can be in there tomorrow

200
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,447
with your
granddaughter visiting...

201
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,241
Let me tell you something.
You want to arrest me, do it.

202
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,968
Or else get the fuck out
of my shop.

203
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,328
Damn, man.

204
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,523
Oh, I needed that.

205
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,130
Hell of a bike, man.

206
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,169
What year is that?

207
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,522
Mabel's a '57 Pan
with a '48 Springer.

208
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,763
She act up on you much?

209
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,321
- She's got a little bit of attitude.
- Oh, yeah, I bet.

210
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,088
I dig that suicide shift.

211
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,371
Nice shot.

212
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,207
Used to have
a '48 Knuckle myself.

213
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,885
Yeah? Where is she?

214
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,280
Alimony.

215
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,523
That's why I ride
this piece-of-shit Yamaha.

216
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,485
She looks like shit
and she sounds like shit,

217
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,921
but the faithful bitch won't die.

218
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,323
Yeah, well, it's not about the bike,
you know?

219
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,081
It's about getting on the road
and being free.

220
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,242
Yeah.

221
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,564
It's better than the wind.

222
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,563
What's her name?

223
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,202
Dirty Fucking Whore,
after my ex-wife.

224
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,041
So, where you headed?

225
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,441
South. I'm gonna go see some family.

226
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,046
Oh, mind if I join you?

227
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,328

You come to take me away?

Wolf needs a woman
that can cook, not eat.

What did you say?

252
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,444
You stay away from my husband.

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,370
Hey, man, where you going?

254
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,091
- This is your job.
- What's that?

255
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,208
Entertain the ladies.

256
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,521
Ooh.

257
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,690

I love you.

Jesus Christ.

261
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,210
Have a bite.
It's good stuff.

262
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,525
I'm good, bud.
It's all you.

263
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,610
What do you mean you're good?

264
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,610
Come on, have some waffles.

265
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,689
It's all you.
There you go.

266
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,683
- You don't want any?
- No.

267
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,763
- You're sure?
- I'm positive.

268
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,287
All right.
Can I borrow some cash?

269
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,324
Well, I'm a little short,
so you're gonna have to get this one.

270
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,850
Christ, Wolf.
I don't have any money for this.

271
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,968
What?

272
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,602
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Dude, we can't walk out.

273
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,762
You guys don't have
any money, do you?

274
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,047
You mean American money?

275
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,611
That's really cute.

276
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,640
I'm gonna call the police.
How about that, okay?

277
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,206
Listen, hey, I', s...
we can work something out, okay?

278
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,283
Please?

279
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,444
Dude, I didn't follow you
to do charity work.

280
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,284
I didn't ask you to follow me.

281
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,482
I got to make money.
And not the fucking hard way.

282
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,643
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, excuse me.

283
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,881
Where you going?

284
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,520
I'm going to take a piss, Todd.
You got an itch to hold it?

285
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,843
You know what? I gave you a break
and let you try to work off your debt.

286
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,081
Shut up.

287
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,044
I don't need to be disrespected
by either one of you guys.

288
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,323
Hey, man, he's not my buddy, okay?

289
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,130
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna do the dishes.

290
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,806
I'm almost done, okay?
I apologize. He's an asshole.

291
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,124
Just finish up and please
don't come back here anymore.

Numay's Mojave
for mountain lion.

- Did you, now?

355
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,088
You know, he's...

356
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,571
he's got a point there.

357
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,688
Look, we're getting off on
the wrong foot here, Numay.

358
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,081
We just want to find Wolf.
We want to keep him safe.

359
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,605
You know where he's at?

360
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,171
No.

361
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,766
We're getting calls every five minutes.
I know he's in town.

362
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,082
You know he and I
don't see eye to eye.

363
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,281
Yeah.

364
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,249
Well, I guess that doesn't surprise me

365
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,290
seeing as you're a lawman
and he's a wanted fugitive.

366
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,604
Mr. Williams, my wife
was raped and beaten in our home.

367
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,287
I abided by the law.
I arrested him.

368
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,489
And you see where that got me.

369
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,405
Well, I deeply sympathize
with your family's loss,

370
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,087
but you can't go around taking the law
into your own hands, now, can you?

371
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,130
So why don't you and I
stop wasting each other's time

372
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,760
and you tell me
where he's going?

373
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,764
Unfortunately,

374
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,447
glory cases
are not my department.

375
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,521
- That a '56?
- '55.

376
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,284
Looks good.

377
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,681
Better when she runs.

378
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,604
What's wrong with her?

379
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,205
Radiator's shot.

380
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,521
I can help.

381
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,047
I can handle it.

382
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,846
Oh, fuck.

383
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,483
Still want to help?

384
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,040
Come on, is that all you got?

385
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,765
Almost.

386
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,526
- Thanks, Bob.
- Nice to meet you, Cash.

387
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,523
Good luck.

388
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,125
Thank you.

389
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,362
- We did it.
- You did it.

390
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,205
- Wolf.
- Wolf. I like that, Wolf.

391
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,283
Um, Magdalena.

392
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,204
Magdalena.

393
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,442
Um...

394
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,768
so I have another
favor to ask you.

395
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,285
What?

396
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,562
I live about a mile
down the road.

397
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,087
I could obviously use a ride.

398
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,846
- Would you?
- Love to.

399
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,571
Great.
I'll grab my stuff.

400
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,046
You know how hard it is
to sell a house in today's market?

401
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,168
- Hard.
- Very hard.

402
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,368
Especially when it's been trashed.

403
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,363
This is why we're not
together anymore, Cash.

404
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,888
You sabotage everything.
Seriously, you're like a child.

405
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,281
I've got potential buyers
standing there with me

406
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,521
and I look like an asshole.

407
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,409
Now, would you rather
file for bankruptcy?

408
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,210
Because that's the only option
you're leaving me with.

409
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,761
Just sell
the fucking house, Linda.

410
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,284

Up north country.

428
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,449
Oh, yeah?
What's up there?

429
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,365
There's this lake.

430
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,887
I want to spread
my mom's ashes there.

431
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,848
She passed a couple months ago.

432
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,729
I'm sorry.

00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,810

435
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,089
Yeah.
It's beautiful.

436
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,204
So what about you?

437
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,201
What about me?

438
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,881
I don't think I've smiled
this much in a long time.

439
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,642
My face hurts.

440
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,643
Sorry.

441
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,010
What are we gonna do with these?

442
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,844
What shall we do with those?

443
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,405
What are you gonna make me?

444
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,449
We can squeeze 'em.

445
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,447
Let's go squeeze some oranges.

446
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,446
Sounds like a plan.

447
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,449

You missed out.
I fell in love last night.

537
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,051
You sure?

538
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,568
Come on, bud.
Get out of there.

539
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,088
- Shit, be easy on me.
- Oh, God damn, you're heavy.

540
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,645
Fucking Christ.

541
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,928
That hurt?

542
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,044
You all right?

543
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,770
No.

544
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,089
No, I'm not all right.

545
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,525
I figured out
some shit last night, though.

546
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,601
When anyone tries to love me...

547
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,930
I push them away,
make them hate me.

548
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,203
I also figured out
I might have a drinking problem.

549
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,124
Maybe.

550
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,322
Then I was thinking, man...

551
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,487
I don't really like myself, man.
You know?

552
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,768
Fuck.

553
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,924
Come on.

554
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,407
Where's he at?

555
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,291
He's out back.

556
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,843
Guard that with your life.

557
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,522
Step outside.

558
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,281
Shh.

559
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,964
You know who I am?

560
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,205
Mm-hmm.

561
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,091
Do you know why I'm here?

562
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,842
I'm looking for
a great big Mojave

563
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,971
going by the name
of Robert Wolf.

564
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,088
He came by here yesterday.

565
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,811
What did he want?

566
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,689
Money.

567
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,569
And?

568
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,129
Came by with a white guy.

569
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,169
Was it Irish?

570
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,687
No, some other white guy.

571
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,571
Irish doesn't live here anymore.

572
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,321
Good.

573
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,165
Now, which way did he go?

574
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,129
I don't know.

575
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,084
You don't know?

576
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,206
And you know where Irish lives,
don't you?

577
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,809
Don't know.

578
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,762
You know what?
I believe you.

579
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,403
Who's Irish?

580
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,322
Um, you know, Irish.
He's Timmy Murphy.

581
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,369
You know,
married to Wolf's sister.

582
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,410
They used to run together.
It's in the report.

583
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,728
- It's in the report?
- Yeah.

584
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,010
Yeah, I think.
Maybe not.

585
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,642
I don't know.
Irish is Timmy Murphy. There.

586
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,965
Well, I'd like to meet him.

587
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,329
Yeah, well, you can't.
He's 500 miles away.

588
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,727
They're up north now.
They're out of the picture.

589
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,166
We got people on it,

590
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,330
but there's no way
Wolf's going over there for dinner.

591
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,767
Guy's wanted for murder
and he's not an idiot.

592
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,326
Get in the fucking car
and take me to Irish.

593
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,201
Damn.
You are fun.

594
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,647
Okay, we'll do that.

595
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,169

That man is raping her.

612
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,847

00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,286
Wolf, wait!
Can you show me where she is?

00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,727
Okay.

619
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,964
Help me!

620
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,006

That you don't love me
or need me.

624
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,041
Let's see how many
we can get in there.

625
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,601
No.

626
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,450
Three.

627
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,568
- No!
- Shut the fuck up.

628
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,484
Cash!

629
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,569

00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,609
Cash!

631
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,761
Cash!

632
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,561
Can't see it, man.

633
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,249
Bust through.
Go. The other way.

634
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,084
Get through.

635
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,040
Help!

636
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,644
Help!

637
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,122
- What happened?
- She was raped.

638
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,442
- Take her. Help them.
- Come on.

639
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,523
Come here, buddy.

640
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,685
- Help them out.
- Come on.

641
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,569
Go. Come on, buddy.
We got to go.

642
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,210
- I need to talk to you guys.
- What are you talking about?

643
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,840
Stop right there.
Stop right there. Freeze!

644
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,769
Show me your hands!

645
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,042
Walk back to the sound
of my voice.

646
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,646
Back. Back. Back.

647
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,643
Stop right there.

648
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,689
Now turn around.

649
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,604
What are your names?

650
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,728
Cash Guirgis.

651
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,126
Robert Wolf.

652
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,081
Now, what happened?

653
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,248
We're coming up the road there
on our motorcycles

654
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,528
and we saw the boy
on the side of the road.

655
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,808
He had blood on his shirt.
He has blood on his face.

656
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,604
We stopped.

657
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,730
We followed him down
to the ravine about half a mile back.

658
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,161
- Down there there's a white guy.
- Stop right there.

659
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,971
- We were just trying to help.
- Shut your mouth.

660
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,565
This is Officer Sosi.

661
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,367
I have two suspects at gunpoint
at the ranger 103.

662
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,601
- Send help now.
- No, we're just trying to help.

663
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,762
Shut your mouth!

664
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,126
Are you armed?

665
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,645
No, sir.

666
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,723
Are you armed?

667
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,450
No.

668
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,648
The both of you
turn around for me.

669
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,882
Robert Wolf?

670
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,927
Are you Numay's son?

671
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,091
Yeah.

672
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,890
This is Officer Sosi.

673
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,646
I have one white male suspect
down by the river entrance.

674
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,325
Send help now.

675
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,490
They're coming.
You guys need to go quick.

676
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,164
Thank you.

677
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,805
Let's go.

678
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,281
They're coming.
Get out of here.

679
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,408
Why the hell are we running?

680
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,848
You got something
you want to tell me?

681
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,406
Look, Wolf,

682
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,211
just be straight with me, man.
That's all I'm asking.

683
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,968
My mom was raped.

684
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,486
When my father found her
in our house...

685
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,850
she was beaten so badly,
he couldn't even recognize her.

686
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,249
We had to put her on life support

687
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,886
'cause she couldn't breathe
on her own.

688
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,281
She couldn't eat.

689
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,010
She couldn't speak.

690
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,806
She was gone.

691
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,122
They catch the guy?

692
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,931
Tribal police found him
and they arrested him.

693
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,129
But because he wasn't native,
he's got to be tried in a federal court.

694
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,843
Federal prosecutors
declined the case

695
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,847
because apparently
it wasn't serious enough.

696
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,241
They hold him for a year

697
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,926
and then they release him.

698
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,884
Six months ago, I tracked
the man down and I killed him.

699
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,128
Been on the run ever since.

700
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,762
Morning, sunshine.

701
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,882
Coffee?

702
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,043
It's hot.

703
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,690
Sorry I went through your pack.

704
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,842
Breakfast?

705
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,123
You know you got
a snoring problem?

706
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,931
- Really?
- Yeah, it's disgusting.

707
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,081
- Seriously.
- Fuck you.

708
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,524
Cheers.

709
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,169
Thanks, man.

710
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,809
So, where we going?

711
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,369
This place is amazing.

712
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,369
Something I can help you with?

713
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,524
Yeah, you sure can.

714
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,405
How much for this?
All this stuff.

715
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,609
All these knickknacks
and whatnot.

716
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,207
I'd like to buy it, your place.

717
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,727
It's not for sale, my man.

718
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,680
Well, I was hoping maybe we could
work out an arrangement.

719
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,207
Get the fuck off my property.

720
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,761
Ooh, tough guy!!-

721
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,570
I fucking knew it!

722
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,530
You got seven seconds to get off
my property, motherfucker.

723
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,288
Fuck!

724
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,009
Who is that?

725
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,401
That's Cash.
Irish, Cash.

726
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,847
- How you doing?
- You motherfucker.

727
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,606
I almost fucking
tuned you up, man.

728
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,491
God damn it.

729
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,324
You want a beer for that?

730
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,682
Oh, I'd love a beer.

731
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,604
I would, too.

732
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,683
When do you not?

733
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,362
I got something
I got to show you.

734
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,529
Come with me.
Come here.

735
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,808
Come, come.

736
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,483
Wolf, meet Wolf.

737
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,684
This is your godson.

738
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,170
Good job.

739
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,162
Where is she?

740
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,164
Oh!

741
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,642
Let's go get that drink.

742
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,969
- He has Mom's spirit.
- Really?

743
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,248
- Mmm.
- He looks beautiful.

744
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,324
Thank God he looks like you.

745
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,767
I miss this.

746
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,203
Can you stay?

747
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,850
I wish I could, but I can't.

748
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,241
You know I can't.

749
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,568
You seen Dad?

750
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,562
- You talk to him?
- No, no.

751
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,802
You know, not...

752
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,368
Not since the funeral, no.

753
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,204
I want to take Mom's ashes.

754
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,089
I want to take her to the lake.

755
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,641
She would have wanted it that way.

756
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,201
Yeah. I think... yeah.

757
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,209
- I think she'd...
- Hey.

758
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,971
- She wanted that.
- Yeah, she did.

759
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,123
But, you know, I also...

760
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,408
kind of wanted to spread
her ashes around here

761
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,404
'cause I want Wolf to know
that she was around.

762
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,724
I just think so.

763
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,844
- I just want to take some.
- Okay.

764
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,843
- Okay?
- Yeah.

765
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,288
- We're just gonna share, okay?
- Yeah, we'll share.

766
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,844
I'm not sorry for what I did.

767
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,328
Not at all.

768
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,483
I'm sorry for what I've lost.

769
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,922
Cash, I sold the house.

770
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,487
I sold the house
first thing this morning.

771
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,051
Wow, that's...

772
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,328
I mean, it wasn't
our asking price,

773
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,608
but it's not bad
considering the market.

774
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,203
Cash?

775
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,442
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

776
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,604
So where are you?

777
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,849
Um, I'm with a friend.

778
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,124
So... so that's it, then.

779
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,891
I guess we're done.

780
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,129
Take care of yourself, Cash.

781
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,486
I mean that.

782
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,165
Yeah.

783
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,651

God damn it.

802
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,802
Wasn't sure I was gonna
see you again.

803
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,526
You know something, Wolf?

804
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,926
I'd have done the same
fucking thing you did.

805
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,570
I just wanted you to know that.

806
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,044
You're a good man.

807
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,249
I love you.

808
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,880
All right, you ready?

809
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,928
Come on, man,
I'll take you up to the lake.

810
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,844
What's wrong, baby?

811
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,044
Irish.
Welcome home.

812
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,609
Who the fuck are you?

813
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:08,367
Agent Williams, FBI.

814
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,171
Sweetie, can you take
Wolf upstairs, please?

815
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,004
Wolf?

816
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,400
Touching.

817
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,086
After your brother the murderer?

818
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,687
One Robert J. Wolf.
Where is he?

819
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,525
Listen here, you son of a bitch.
I know my rights.

820
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,610
So unless you got a goddamn warrant,
you get the fuck off my property.

821
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,321
A goddamn warrant.

822
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,360
You know, I don't like this
any more than you.

823
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,761
But we're here because your brother
brought us here

824
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,924
to your house and your son.

825
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,684
You know, you're a very
lucky man, Irish.

826
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:55,243
Now, tell me where he is.

827
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,121
Agent Williams,
I'd like to help you out,

828
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,124
but the truth is we haven't
seen him in years, right?

829
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,562
So you can go fuck yourself.

830
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,046
That was a federal offense.

831
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,451
Now you listen to me, you fuck.
I'm gonna tear your family apart.

832
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,728
You want to harbor a fugitive,
you're federally fucked for life.

833
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,645
And you, Eva, you're an accomplice.
Two years minimum.

834
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,609
Child services
aren't what they used to be.

835
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,130
Schaeffer, take Mrs. Murphy
to the car.

836
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,281
- No, no, no. Don't.
- No, no, no, no.

837
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,442
- I'll take the child.
- No!

838
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,331
' - Baby! Baby!

839
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,130
Let go of my son!

840
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,770
Bring my wife back!

841
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,083
Put my son down,
you sick motherfuck!

842
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,289
Irish, I know he's been here.

843
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,249
- Bring my wife back.
- You're gonna tell me where he is.

844
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,404
- Bring my wife back.
- Shh. That's a good baby.

845
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,722
Look at me, you sick fuck!
Put my baby down!

846
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,963
- Irish, his bike's in the garage.
- God damn it!

847
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,566
- Shh.
- Look at me. Look at me.

848
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,324
Look at me,
you sick motherfucker.

849
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,608
- Daddy's got a dirty mouth.
- Let go of my son.

850
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,762
Put my son down.
Put my son down.

851
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,843
Daddy's gonna tell us
where he is.

852
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,441
He is, yeah.

853
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,410
Tell me where he is.

854
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,609
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
Let's make a deal.

855
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,802
Let's make a deal.

856
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,201
No deal.

857
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,681
Tell me where he is.

858
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,604
Fucking son of a bitch.

859
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,728
Then let's talk.

860
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,200
Tell me where he is.

861
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,327
- Just bring my wife back.
- Tell me where he fucking is!

862
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,609
Tell me where he is!

863
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,762
Stop, stop, stop.

864
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,764
At the lake.

865
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,363
How much further?

866
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,091
It's at the base
of that mountain.

867
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,485
You sure?

868
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,808
Yeah.

869
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,884
Ooh!

870
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,201
The lake's this way.
It's over here.

871
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,647
What are you doing?

872
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,527
You gonna...
all right.

873
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,001
If you guys want
to be lost in the woods.

874
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,844
This is it.

875
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,923
It's pretty-

876
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,721
- I'll be over there, all right?
- All right.

877
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,242
Wolf! Run!

878
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,528
Run!

879
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,769
- Schaeffer!
- Shit.

880
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,883
Wolf, freeze right there!

881
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,202
Take the shot!
Take the shot!

882
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,046
Schaeffer, take him down!

883
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,202
Wolf, freeze, God damn it!

884
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,409
Schaeffer, take him
fucking down!

885
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,045
Shut the fuck up!

886
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:26,409
Wolf!

887
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,568
God damn it.

888
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,449
Sorry, Wolf.

889
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,683
Fuck!

890
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,408
No! Wolf!

891
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,040
No!

892
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,123
Help!

893
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,163
Stay with me, buddy.

894
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,368
