1
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:39,906
<i>  Moments... This is one. </ I>

2
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,785
<i> Right here, right now, is definitely a time
. </ I>

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,620
Tessa?

4
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:48,873
<i> Anything can happen at once. </ I>

5
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:50,582
- Tessa!
- What?

6
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:53,043
- You're not listening.
- If I'm listening.

7
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,506
- What did I just say?
- I was not listening...

8
00:00:57,673 --> 00:00:58,716
He said that this is a big night for you
.

9
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:02,224
- Number one on the list.
- There is no list.

10
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,137
But you do list.

11
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,139
I have not started.

12
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:07,767
Start now.

13
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:09,809
Go!

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,815
Claro, which is what you want,
truth does not bother me.

15
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,485
- The blonde.
- The blonde? Are you sure?

16
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,738
- You want it?
- Like I said, I do not care.

17
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:24,032
- You can have the blonde.
- Only if you're sure...

18
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:29,329
- So...
- What baby?

19
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,124
If I do this with someone who does not know
.

20
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,584
Does that make me a slut?

21
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:37,587
It makes you feel alive.

22
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:57,357
So this club...
Do you always go?

23
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:00,110
No. .. Do you?

24
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:01,652
Sometimes.

25
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,072
Sure...

26
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:11,871
Is there another side we can go?

27
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:19,460
Do you want a cup of tea or coffee?

28
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:22,966
Sure if... Anything.

29
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:26,177
Do not have coffee...

30
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:28,513
Okay.

31
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,850
- I can not find the tea...
- A little water is fine.

32
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:52,703
- So... What is your favorite...
- Do you want to kiss me?

33
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:55,747
I can?

34
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:14,975
Jesus Christ!

35
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:16,476
Okay!

36
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,561
- Jesus Christ!
- It's okay!

37
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:20,482
- What happened?
- Got out the hair.

38
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,946
Did you laugh?! It's not funny!

39
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:46,758
So what usually disguised sales?

40
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:48,717
How fake hair?

41
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:53,179
Not get anything, so.

42
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,725
- Just as I am.
- Really?

43
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,268
Right.

44
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:26,672
Not supposed to do that, a little longer?

45
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:28,798
Not think so.

46
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:31,970
Wait... Can you look at me for a second
?

47
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,556
It's my first time.

48
00:04:35,888 --> 00:04:37,433
Wow that's amazing!

49
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:40,353
Obviously not yours.

50
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:41,477
Stop talking already.

51
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:44,272
Yes, well no.

52
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,692
- What?
- I'm sorry.

53
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:49,654
Not going to happen.

54
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:51,947
Are you kidding?

55
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:55,451
- You get this far and...
- I'm sorry, really.

56
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:59,536
Whatever.

57
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,961
Okay...

58
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,840
Okay.

59
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,811
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

60
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,155
Do not understand. I just do not understand
always tell me everything.

61
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,991
- I never say anything.
- Why not start now?

62
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:43,868
What were you doing last night.

63
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:46,205
Dad keeps asking,
for 15 th time is a charm.

64
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:51,709
Hi, I'm Caroline, producer.
Spoke on the phone.

65
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:54,630
- Hello, it's good to meet you in person.
- And she should be Tessa!

66
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:57,172
Me.

67
00:07:57,674 --> 00:08:00,509
The elevator is not working,
mind using the stairs?

68
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:02,887
- Yes, you are right.
- Okay.

69
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:07,392
Tessa Scott and his father.

70
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:10,061
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

71
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:12,481
- Sit.
- I'm happy to be here.

72
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,399
- Yes, we are big fans.
- Great, let's talk a bit.

73
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:19,175
Most natural
and I can help you. Right?

74
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,671
What angle will be?
Is this "girl dying"

75
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:22,784
Original or have something planned?

76
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,126
- Excuse me?
- Tessa!

77
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:29,331
I know it's difficult, but try to keep him quiet
, OK?

78
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:32,980
And now I am delighted to have as my...

79
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:36,254
... Guest in the studio, a very brave young lady
...

80
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,300
Tessa Scott Tessa
has lived with leukemia for the past four years.

81
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,636
Y is here with his dad,
to talk about it.

82
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:47,057
Tell us, when you realized that Tessa was ill
?

83
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:51,227
4 years ago, her mother and I think she had the flu
.

84
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:57,442
But flu would not leave,
blood test confirm our worst fear.

85
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:00,027
They said there was
chance to survive.

86
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:03,489
The point is, Tessa said...

87
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,866
... Had no choice, more
than chemo therapy.

88
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,293
Tessa So, you decided to stop treatment
,

89
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:10,720
that's a big decision,
for a 17 years.

90
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:13,561
If I could... The more aggressive treatments
,

91
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:16,210
only have prolonged the life of Tessa, slightly.

92
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:18,627
There are other ways to maintain their health.

93
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:21,215
- Dad... - For example, studies show that
good nutrition...

94
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:23,175
Can replace a system entirely.

95
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:25,345
's Why we
here, really...

96
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:26,845
- Dad!
- What?

97
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:30,724
He's going to have to stop at some point
.

98
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,519
Tessa Stop what?

99
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:35,812
He knows he has to go.

100
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,439
But
can not help but wait, that does not happen.

101
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:43,278
Is true that if I continue with the chemo therapy
,

102
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,904
probably live a little longer.

103
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,993
But I feel very bad.

104
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:50,119
And there are things I want
do before dying.

105
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,581
Things?

106
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:56,583
If... I have a list.

107
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:00,921
- Oh! Your dad did not mention that.
- Is why it does not know.

108
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:02,921
Most of what I want, is illegal.

109
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:06,093
But mostly I have sex last night.

110
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,595
Which is
something against the law, of course.

111
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:10,596
But it was so bad, the guy should be arrested
equally.

112
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:12,766
Okay...
I think it's all we have time for.

113
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:15,268
I plan to take drugs too, do you have any advice for
which should take?

114
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:17,814
- That's enough, Tessa.
- Very funny.

115
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:20,272
Sex, drugs and rock n 'roll.

116
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:22,484
Ladies and gentlemen, I think they agree
...

117
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:24,528
... That is a young,
taking life by the horns.

118
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:26,740
Thank you to Tessa and her dad.

119
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:28,656
Thank you.

120
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,119
And now the weather, as always this morning...

121
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,290
's Cloudy, a little chilly afternoon clearing
and the rest of the week.

122
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:44,006
- Is he out?
- No.

123
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,131
Dad.

124
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,260
Wait...

125
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:51,514
It's after nine.

126
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:54,307
- Do not tell me?
- Hi honey, happens.

127
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:55,810
Hi Mom!

128
00:10:57,228 --> 00:11:00,899
- You look stressed.
- Cúlpala it! Back-to four.

129
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:10,490
Is a new trick mom,
I can make a coin disappear.

130
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:13,450
- Want to see?
- No honey, not before coffee.

131
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:18,457
- Nothing before coffee, show your sister.
- She is never interested.

132
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,252
- She does not mind!
- Sure.

133
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:25,464
- I really do not care.
- Why do not you go see CBBS or something?

134
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:27,842
Because I have nine years.

135
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:33,012
I heard you on the radio...

136
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:36,225
Met a guy.

137
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:38,727
Tessa, promise me you'll use a condom always
.

138
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:43,357
It may seem great, but no one is saved
gonorrhea.

139
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:46,609
Can you stop? But my panic attack,
have a panic attack.

140
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:50,572
And do not have casual sex.

141
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,869
- Really?
- No honey.

142
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:57,246
Always try as much as possible.

143
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:04,420
I have to get a tattoo.

144
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:05,962
I want one in a while.

145
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:09,175
Length
About me and bigger tits.

146
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:14,760
- What about?
- He's a fucking liar.

147
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:16,932
- Who?
- Scott.

148
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:19,810
- Said he'd be here.
- Is that why you came?

149
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:22,688
I can not believe I planted,
I gave him the best sex of his life.

150
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,438
- Fucking idiot.
- Look.

151
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:27,025
- What?
- Is there.

152
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,239
Hi handsome.

153
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:32,864
What about?

154
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,491
Well...

155
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:35,409
Well...

156
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:41,788
- Hello.
- Hello!

157
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,505
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

158
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:49,213
I know you leave nothing,
the other night, I just wanted...

159
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:50,507
No. .. No, it was my fault.

160
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:54,803
- What?
- I just...

161
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:58,097
- I could have been a little more...
- Did she tell you?

162
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:00,474
- What?
- You did it?

163
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:02,727
You told on me.

164
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:04,939
Should not have done that.

165
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,189
Tessa waiting!

166
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:09,858
Tessa!

167
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:34,841
You missed lunch.

168
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,136
You Eat.

169
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:47,146
- What's with all this?
- There is a fire in the next door.

170
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:50,901
Do not do that.

171
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:54,194
Please do not, if your
do not want these things, I do.

172
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:58,826
This is Spain! We were in remission.

173
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:01,118
Teaching me to whistle, you took that picture.

174
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,080
I said I would never forget my first whistle.

175
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:08,041
If...

176
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:09,877
But if I want to.

177
00:14:56,256 --> 00:14:58,009
What are you doing?

178
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:01,721
Do you mind?

179
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:04,681
Surely not.

180
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:07,517
'm Adam.

181
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,730
And you... You Tessa.

182
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:13,899
I've seen around here
since you moved.

183
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:16,945
Do not know how to introduce myself.

184
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:18,781
There are love letters.

185
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:20,947
Not my business.

186
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:22,239
Just saying, I
let anyone or anything like that.

187
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:24,744
Not thought of that.

188
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:30,207
Anyway, I have more things to burn.

189
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:33,752
Great, go ahead.

190
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,091
This will also leave.

191
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,385
It is probably best.

192
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:44,180
Is a dangerous dress.

193
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,936
Are you okay?

194
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:02,865
Tessa?

195
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:07,994
You fainted.

196
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:11,708
Are you diabetic? Need sugar?

197
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:14,792
Take a little of this.

198
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,008
- This warm.
- I'm sorry.

199
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,342
It sound like a bad thing.

200
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:28,014
Very good, excellent, nothing embarrassed, ashamed at all
.

201
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:29,599
Do not worry, it's okay.

202
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,269
Do not worry, I never had that effect on someone before
.

203
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,812
And as I like.

204
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:40,695
- It's a nice garden.
- If you, is like that... What I like.

205
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:43,446
- If you are not happy.
- What about your dad?

206
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:45,240
Only the two of us.

207
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:49,161
- I should go home.
- OK, if you need help...

208
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:51,747
Not exactly far.

209
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:55,416
So, if you burn more than
...

210
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:58,212
O if
I fainted in front of someone.

211
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:03,133
- You know where to come.
- Right.

212
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:16,396
When Tessa dies,
we go on vacation?

213
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:19,483
God!
That's something horrible, what you say!

214
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:21,401
Can not remember when we went to Spain.

215
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,572
Was so long ago, that
may not be true.

216
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:25,863
- Enough, go to your room!
- Dad!

217
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,448
- What happened?
- Go!

218
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:30,201
What I said was wrong?

219
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:36,250
- She will leave in peace.
- No, of course not.

220
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,835
It's your day.

221
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,088
- What does that mean?
- That you can do whatever you want.

222
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:45,049
- Buy more?
- Sure.

223
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:47,010
Where does the money go?

224
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:50,263
A credit card
buy now and pay later.

225
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:52,723
O you know... Never.

226
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,144
Careful where you fly, lest you be
serves someone's eye.

227
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:58,481
Really wish I could fly.

228
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:00,691
OK?

229
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:13,913
Awesome!

230
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:19,250
That was better than the best in the world!

231
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,254
- I can do it again?
- I think it's time for your sister.

232
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:24,715
- I'm fine, I just want to see.
- Are you sure?

233
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:27,925
This patient can not
do such things.

234
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:30,720
Okay buddy, that fix
there again.

235
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:36,434
The truth... You know what? I will.

236
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:40,397
- Ready?
- List!

237
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:43,190
Tessa ! Not sure if that...

238
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:15,515
- Right?
- Right! Just who is ill.

239
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:27,736
- It was not your money.
-'re Late...

240
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:30,361
Did you hear what I said?

241
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:33,867
- Promised to come.
- Tessa!

242
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:36,827
- Want to be refunded?
- Why should he be punished?

243
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,623
- What are you doing?
- Does this have to do with your list?

244
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,500
- I have a list.
- I said that to the guy on the radio.

245
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:46,045
- It was an invention.
- Yes, it was an invention.

246
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:49,214
Equal cheated him and me.

247
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:51,509
How do you think that makes me feel?

248
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:54,179
I do not care how you feel,
she's not coming, let's do it.

249
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:04,940
Tessa,
feel a prick and you burn something.

250
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:07,439
And then anesthesia will effect do you think?

251
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,821
Okay, now pulled up and down.

252
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:15,491
To break the fabric,
around the point of incision.

253
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:18,118
You may feel pain around the chest
.

254
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,288
Once the glue line, simply slide
.

255
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,250
Now, of course I can not reinsert the cavity
.

256
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:27,337
Would you recommend other treatment?

257
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:30,839
- I'm saying is that you can change your mind
. - Do not change my mind.

258
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,133
Daddy?

259
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:36,845
Not going to change my mind.

260
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:38,849
Very well, then.

261
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,856
Grab that for me.

262
00:20:49,193 --> 00:20:50,942
Good girl.

263
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:52,695
Do you want to stop doing that?

264
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:57,824
- What? No! - Then I tried
like a horse.

265
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:04,039
I'm sorry.

266
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:08,711
Hey, it's done now.

267
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:11,254
's Done.

268
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,592
- You know you watch?
- If.

269
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,178
Fever, headache, chills.

270
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,640
Bleeding, loss of strength.

271
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:24,058
're Good.

272
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:25,893
Thanks for all your help.

273
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,983
- He likes you.
- I doubt it.

274
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:32,985
I mean, you got something there!

275
00:21:33,653 --> 00:21:36,112
You should ask her out.

276
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:38,657
Tessa! Wait, I'm here.

277
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,660
Already low, stay there.

278
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:51,085
Oh God, how I missed it?
Time I went out, but there was crazy traffic.

279
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,962
Definitely went out on time.

280
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:55,090
- Just...
- Sure, whatever.

281
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:57,969
- Tessa!
- I do not care.

282
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:00,846
- Do not be like that.
- How do you expect?

283
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:03,474
Sorry
Does this have something to do with you?

284
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,060
- Is that a serious question?
- Yes, it is.

285
00:22:06,228 --> 00:22:08,019
Enough!

286
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:11,253
Both stink  one is
obsessive with cancer...

287
00:22:11,254 --> 00:22:14,193
... And one can not even get to the Hospital
.

288
00:22:14,194 --> 00:22:16,488
Which is fine, I understand.

289
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:18,862
But neither is what I need.

290
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,491
Are just wasting my time.

291
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:30,501
- All I'm saying is that...
- It will not be what you say.

292
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:33,046
- All I'm saying is...
- Say no more.

293
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:35,464
All I'm saying is that you have to stay with me
.

294
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,382
You can go out and see your friends more often
.

295
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:40,094
- Okay.
- That's all I'm saying.

296
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:47,851
Did you ever use drugs?

297
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:51,355
Excellent Have you met my mother?

298
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:57,444
- Hello!
- Hello.

299
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:00,615
All I used were
fungi, which are natural.

300
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:02,825
And not strictly...

301
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:05,076
Legal ...
My friend gave me, but thought...

302
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:07,120
... That something else would be
ugly, so...

303
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:08,873
Ate mushrooms.

304
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,711
See you inside.

305
00:23:19,174 --> 00:23:21,343
- Well...
- I think so.

306
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:25,972
- How much did you eat?
- Not much.

307
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:28,683
- I do not know, really do not know.
- I do not either.

308
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,562
Look, I'll take you somewhere,
to keep you out of trouble.

309
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:33,313
I'm not sure how much effect do
delay.

310
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:42,572
Do not both?

311
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,138
- Do not be afraid.
- What?

312
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:51,933
What?

313
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,602
What did you say?

314
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:05,197
All right, look I have here.

315
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:08,030
Here I can see them going crazy.

316
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,118
Do not want to go crazy, for nothing!

317
00:25:12,454 --> 00:25:14,204
I'll only be up here.

318
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:16,581
What are you doing?

319
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,376
Low  Okay!

320
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,044
- Let's get down to three!
- No!

321
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:21,505
Come on down.

322
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:24,298
- Please!
- Why, force me down?

323
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,924
No, I'll tell you one low.

324
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:30,514
Okay.

325
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:33,557
Thanks.

326
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:36,560
Where is Tessa?

327
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:38,814
What?

328
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:09,217
- We have to go after her.
- I do not even know where it went.

329
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,722
- We have to find it now!
- He'll be back, no big deal.

330
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,267
- I mean... Here there is no danger.
- Yes, of course.

331
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,811
Why?

332
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:22,271
- Zooey? -
Is supposed not to tell you.

333
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:25,151
What?

334
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:31,824
Tessa!

335
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:39,123
Tessa!

336
00:26:48,132 --> 00:26:50,175
I just discovered something.

337
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:58,685
Are you okay? Can you come down?

338
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:01,686
Not want.

339
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:07,525
Just wait... Wait, I'm coming.

340
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,834
Just wait for me !

341
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:43,646
Tessa! You have to download please.

342
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,356
Please let me help you down.

343
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:48,982
I'm going to tell you something.

344
00:27:50,194 --> 00:27:52,988
And you must promise
not tell anyone okay?

345
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:03,080
I do not feel sick... No more.

346
00:28:04,376 --> 00:28:07,460
I just need to stay here.

347
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:11,714
I have to be away from the modern world.

348
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:15,468
And then I will not be sick.

349
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,513
You can stay with me if you want.

350
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,765
I would like if you did.

351
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:25,437
And build things, shelter traps...

352
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:27,898
Will cultivate vegetables.

353
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:31,068
We'll be safe.

354
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,072
- Tessa...
- No!

355
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:40,285
Please... Do not say anything.

356
00:28:57,177 --> 00:29:00,014
- Tessa!
- What?

357
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:02,933
You still be your brother when you die?

358
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:07,811
Still be here.

359
00:29:08,606 --> 00:29:10,148
Are you going to haunt me?

360
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:12,402
No, if you want.

361
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:16,488
Only  not scare me.

362
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,031
Well, dad says
go down, when you're ready.

363
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,710
Enjoying your cake?

364
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,881
Is adorable, thanks Tessa.

365
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:43,139
Do not look as if you feel well.

366
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,597
You would feel good?

367
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,019
Do not take it personal.

368
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,105
's Been like for the past few weeks.

369
00:29:50,773 --> 00:29:52,148
Shauna, I think this is called
the other girl who came.

370
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:56,110
Do not pretend you've forgotten your name
dad invited her to dinner.

371
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:57,861
And she said no.

372
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:01,741
'll Be next.

373
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,601
Does everything wrong.

374
00:30:07,832 --> 00:30:11,500
- How do you feel about that?
- I laugh.

375
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,421
Know... There are support groups, you can...

376
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:18,383
... Meet people in the same situation as you
.

377
00:30:19,927 --> 00:30:21,510
I went to one of those once.

378
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:22,930
My advisor called Angela.

379
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:26,266
Why
not talk to her about all this?

380
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:28,101
Because he died.

381
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:30,812
The last time I make that mistake.

382
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,730
Are we done?

383
00:30:48,998 --> 00:30:50,707
Not have to look at me like that.

384
00:30:51,374 --> 00:30:53,835
I'm just dying, not contagious.

385
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:58,965
- How are you feeling today?
- Fancy a ride?

386
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,289
Always answer a question with a question?

387
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:02,924
Does that bother you?

388
00:31:03,844 --> 00:31:05,804
I have to fix this thing.

389
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,890
I'm cleaning the engine.

390
00:31:08,184 --> 00:31:09,351
Do you feel more comfortable with?

391
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,102
What do you mean? Not a problem.

392
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,689
At least this is productive.

393
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:26,993
- Where did you say you were going?
- I said nothing.

394
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:48,804
Climbing THROUGH A nice field.

395
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,579
Maybe my biggest problem is...

396
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,768
...
I have no much energy to burn.

397
00:31:53,103 --> 00:31:55,271
Yeah, right.

398
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:08,827
Was worth it?

399
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:11,787
If.

400
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:21,922
What's the story with you and your mom?

401
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,800
My dad died last year.

402
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,139
And I had a place in
college, but...

403
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,267
Rejected him.

404
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:36,605
Should go yet.

405
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:42,191
I'm not sure it's good for something.

406
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:48,783
Are you afraid?

407
00:32:53,746 --> 00:32:55,621
It comes and goes.

408
00:32:58,168 --> 00:33:00,461
Most believe that when these
sick, you become brave and courageous.

409
00:33:02,587 --> 00:33:03,464
Not so.

410
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:10,263
Most of the time is like
be stalked by a psychopath.

411
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:12,890
As you enter
in shock for a second.

412
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:17,686
Sometimes I forget if I go or come.

413
00:33:18,478 --> 00:33:19,855
What makes you forget?

414
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,734
That's another thing.

415
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:27,155
I should think that, all afternoon.

416
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:33,618
Look.

417
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,166
Now I feel no fear.

418
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:42,395
- Why do not you want to go?
- I should not say that other thing.

419
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,982
Do not think you can go now?

420
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:47,358
- The party who is?
- I'm not sure.

421
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,404
- Did not I invited?
- Not how it works.

422
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,948
- But all your friends are going.
- I guess so.

423
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:58,160
It's complicated.

424
00:34:58,454 --> 00:35:00,037
Two of us.

425
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,222
Hey, wait for me here,
'll bring something to drink.

426
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:20,765
If.

427
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:34,114
- Or better come with me?
- Okay, I'll go with you.

428
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:46,418
- Hey There!
- Hey guys.

429
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:50,296
Sorry to bother you, only
know someone who looks like your friend.

430
00:35:50,755 --> 00:35:52,716
'm Tessa, a pleasure to meet you.

431
00:35:53,174 --> 00:35:55,218
On behalf of the entire house,
it's good to meet you too.

432
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:57,005
How's college?

433
00:35:57,135 --> 00:36:00,097
Good place to learn, you should try it.

434
00:36:00,098 --> 00:36:00,723
Yeah, yeah...

435
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:07,438
- You Drinking down this?
- Yes! Actually yes.

436
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,320
Yeah, well, the girls did not appear at parties
and...

437
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,405
... Easy, but when you
it, you are no longer welcome.

438
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,074
So, you have a serious problem with me
.

439
00:36:18,618 --> 00:36:20,493
You should get out more.

440
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:22,579
Well, not everyone has the desire
right?

441
00:36:23,163 --> 00:36:26,542
- This is in L.A.?
- Contrary.

442
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:31,337
The girl hit my jaw,
when he was pointing at my nose.

443
00:36:33,173 --> 00:36:35,717
- You have to be careful.
- No, of course not.

444
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,135
That's the thing...

445
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,138
See you then?

446
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:44,976
- What do you mean?
- This is your house.

447
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,445
Nonsense, come on, you
led to the door of your house.

448
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:48,186
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, Sure, no problem.

449
00:36:50,772 --> 00:36:52,817
See?

450
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:57,029
Thanks .

451
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,297
Hello.

452
00:37:58,174 --> 00:37:59,926
Hello?

453
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,301
- You dropped that.
- What?

454
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:03,970
That.

455
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:05,179
You dropped.

456
00:38:05,515 --> 00:38:07,141
Not mine.

457
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:09,435
I saw it out of his pocket.

458
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:11,770
- Really?
- If.

459
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:15,272
Because I was fixing.

460
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:21,821
Thanks.

461
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:33,125
- That was so cool!
- I was completely.

462
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:35,335
Broke the rules? Always do that?

463
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:38,173
No!
You who came at the perfect time.

464
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:40,758
- Now what? - Now we are going to get and
money and party.

465
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:42,031
With the card?

466
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:43,219
- Okay.
- And what is the number?

467
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:45,761
What do you mean?

468
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:48,890
- Did not you see the number?
- No, you had to have.

469
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,808
I'd dash!

470
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:54,020
- Stunk like criminals.
- Probably for the best.

471
00:38:54,188 --> 00:38:55,521
Is better right?

472
00:38:55,897 --> 00:38:56,481
Maybe we should try to return the card.

473
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:59,068
- How do we do that?
- Do not interrupt anything right?

474
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:26,344
Go! The card!

475
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:40,359
Come with Cole, I know he's crazy about me.

476
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:43,028
- How do you know?
- Why is man?

477
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:45,571
I would not believe much, either.

478
00:39:45,572 --> 00:39:47,281
Well why did not you call me last night?

479
00:39:47,282 --> 00:39:48,909
There's something I have to tell you.

480
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:49,992
Let's do it quick.

481
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:52,162
Remember to steal, it's all security
you have.

482
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:53,872
You need to be ready.

483
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:57,417
There, we separated.

484
00:39:57,541 --> 00:40:00,086
- Why not together?
- Will be more suspect. Come.

485
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:41,795
- Tessa? Tessa? Scott?
- No, sorry.

486
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:43,880
Yes, you.

487
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:46,173
Do not we remember?

488
00:40:46,174 --> 00:40:47,340
In school.

489
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,554
Oh yeah!

490
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,221
You left when you were eleven you?

491
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,143
So how's it going?

492
00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:59,310
Still with all this treatment?

493
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:03,441
- Not anymore.
- So are you better?

494
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:05,819
No.

495
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,906
What want you two?

496
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,616
- Zooey Hello!
- Why are you here?

497
00:41:14,577 --> 00:41:16,413
- Ready to go?
- If.

498
00:41:16,538 --> 00:41:18,415
Is it true you've been dating Scott
?

499
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:24,002
- What do you care? Do you know him?
- Okay, let's go.

500
00:41:24,128 --> 00:41:28,133
Everyone knows him, came to me
sister for about half an hour.

501
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:30,635
Oh, yeah?

502
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:33,054
I have to go collect my funeral invitations
.

503
00:41:33,431 --> 00:41:35,348
- Really?
- If.

504
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:37,120
Also  I have to read a lot, so...

505
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:38,684
... See that damn poem
put on my grave.

506
00:41:39,268 --> 00:41:42,271
- Let go.
- Are idiots, they know nothing.

507
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:44,148
No. ..

508
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,527
- I have to go find it.
- Now?

509
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:50,694
Yeah, sorry, I have to go.

510
00:41:54,993 --> 00:41:57,161

Sit.

513
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:34,907
Empty your pockets.

514
00:42:40,706 --> 00:42:43,792
Well, I'd call that evidence
do not you?

515
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:47,461
Name, address, number of parents.

516
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,005
Do not call my dad.

517
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:53,510
We have an option we can
call him or the police.

518
00:42:53,677 --> 00:42:54,563
Police.

519
00:42:54,886 --> 00:42:58,556
- Anytime.
- I told the guy from outside, which would handle.

520
00:42:59,558 --> 00:43:01,057
- And if you do not...
- Listen.

521
00:43:08,775 --> 00:43:09,775
This is for chemo therapy.

00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:13,279

Please componte your shirt.

525
00:43:18,993 --> 00:43:21,704
Do you know what that is?

526
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:24,583
- No, I'm afraid I do not know.
- Is cancer.

527
00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:34,674
Even so, I have to call your dad.

528
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:38,013
Do you?

529
00:43:38,512 --> 00:43:42,099
- What's your excuse?
- What took her?

530
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:45,560
A Clear Blue pregnancy test.

531
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:03,705
That was on the list? Does stealing?

532
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:14,589
What you Tessa? What are you doing?

533
00:44:14,758 --> 00:44:16,635
Doing all I can,
as fast as you can.

534
00:44:17,135 --> 00:44:18,386
Well, you should stop.

535
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:20,949
Prefer to spend the rest of my life, below...

536
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,055
... The blankets on the couch, with my head
on your shoulder.

537
00:44:24,683 --> 00:44:27,917
If... I wish. Can you blame me?

538
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:31,940
Yes, of course I would.

539
00:44:34,734 --> 00:44:36,237
Look, my point is...

540
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:38,988
My point is,
I like strong women.

541
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:40,490
Always want to be loaded to bed.

542
00:44:40,616 --> 00:44:42,242
Once carried me to the bed.

543
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:44,955
I do not understand, is going to a party.

544
00:44:45,163 --> 00:44:47,747
Y appear with a very young pixie Warlock!

545
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:52,377
She is not a Warlock,
say, she started a fight.

546
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:00,551
Apparently if you can.

547
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:13,440
What are you doing here?

548
00:45:14,066 --> 00:45:16,024
I've been harassed all day.

549
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:18,361
Just did not have the courage to warn.

550
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:21,865
- Really?
- No.

551
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:27,078
My dad's in store.

552
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,710
It's nice to see your friends again.

553
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,965
Always becoming apparent.

554
00:45:45,223 --> 00:45:50,436
- Well... See you around, maybe...
- Sure, yes.

555
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:57,442
I know you're looking!

556
00:45:58,067 --> 00:45:59,777
I'm not looking.

557
00:45:59,945 --> 00:46:01,905
Liar !

558
00:46:09,453 --> 00:46:10,997
You should think about going back to school.

559
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:13,833
Normalize your life.

560
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,336
Not return to school.

561
00:46:16,753 --> 00:46:19,006
I should give many tests.

562
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:24,344
I'm kidding.

563
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:27,721
Daily.

564
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,645
Take care friend!

565
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,855
Idiot!

566
00:46:36,981 --> 00:46:38,691
He wants!

567
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:55,667
Tessa where are you going?

568
00:46:55,751 --> 00:46:57,211
? Tessa?!

569
00:46:59,714 --> 00:47:01,964
Tessa!

570
00:47:41,546 --> 00:47:42,795
That was very good.

571
00:47:43,756 --> 00:47:48,469
You drive a motorcycle, in fact
was on my list.

572
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:50,179
Tell me more you have.

573
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:53,472
Fame.

574
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,643
How famous will you be?

575
00:47:57,645 --> 00:47:59,940
Enough
that the world does not do, what you are doing.

576
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:03,777
And personally come to say goodbye when I die.

577
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:06,696
Do not think you're asking too
there?

578
00:48:09,742 --> 00:48:12,035
Only
I have my name in the world out there.

579
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:16,121
Not worry, I will not forget
Tess.

580
00:48:21,253 --> 00:48:22,044
Enough?

581
00:48:29,177 --> 00:48:30,887
If.

582
00:48:32,473 --> 00:48:33,890
What are you doing?

583
00:48:35,851 --> 00:48:37,810
Just want to swim.

584
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:41,396
Do not go swimming without clothes.

585
00:48:41,564 --> 00:48:43,982
Of course not, do you think I'm crazy?

586
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,528
No naked.

587
00:48:47,738 --> 00:48:50,281
Tess! Tess!

588
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:03,876
Okay, on the count of three right?

589
00:49:04,797 --> 00:49:07,381
- What?
- Come on, just run.

590
00:49:09,174 --> 00:49:11,302
- Deal.
- Sure...

591
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:14,514
- Demons.
- Here we go.

592
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,265
One, two, three!

593
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:31,487
You are evil!

594
00:49:31,823 --> 00:49:36,035
- How about this?
- Yes, really very good.

595
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:38,829
- Really?
- No!

596
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,208
Come What are you afraid of?

597
00:49:42,209 --> 00:49:43,667
A nothing!

598
00:50:10,568 --> 00:50:12,363
The great thing is...

599
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:15,949
That truth, I always wanted to try to dry myself with
half.

600
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,664
I'm glad you did that to me!

601
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,248
Do not worry.

602
00:50:28,296 --> 00:50:29,838
The stars around us.

603
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:32,759
If...

604
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,012
See that group of five, up there?
In the form of a curve did you see?

605
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:39,431
- Do you see?
- If...

606
00:50:39,807 --> 00:50:41,348
I have no idea how they are called.

607
00:50:52,988 --> 00:50:54,654
Keep.

608
00:50:55,698 --> 00:50:58,033
No. ..

609
00:51:01,704 --> 00:51:03,287
What?

610
00:51:04,998 --> 00:51:06,708
I'm sorry.

611
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:09,085
Do not you like me?

612
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:12,714
Not that.

613
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:18,260
Not think I can handle it.

614
00:51:21,265 --> 00:51:22,600
See you later.

615
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:25,142
Tess, Tess wait!
We Tess! Come!

616
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:27,604
No, I made a mistake.

617
00:51:29,022 --> 00:51:31,483
What? What error?

618
00:51:34,068 --> 00:51:35,986
Can not save.

619
00:52:35,756 --> 00:52:38,258
When you were a baby...

620
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:42,552
Your mom and I used to stay awake at night
, watching you breathe.

621
00:52:46,766 --> 00:52:48,519
We were convinced that if we stopped looking...

622
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:51,145
Just forget the how.

623
00:52:54,817 --> 00:52:57,611
When children grow up, is a different kind of concern
.

624
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,657
Never as a ghost.

625
00:53:04,242 --> 00:53:06,826
Please think about it.

626
00:53:07,286 --> 00:53:12,751
You know I prefer when I yell?

627
00:53:23,637 --> 00:53:25,679
Tessa?

628
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,994
Nurse!

629
00:53:48,078 --> 00:53:49,787
Okay sweetie.

630
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:56,877
Do not worry about that.

631
00:53:56,878 --> 00:53:59,171
I'm sorry.

632
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:02,300
- Sorry.
- Okay sweetie.

633
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,427
Tessa Hello how are you?

634
00:54:07,055 --> 00:54:09,723
Well, I think I did well vomit.

635
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:15,312
We did some tests last night.

636
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,692
And I fear that the cancer has spread to your
spinal fluid.

637
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,567
Things are progressing faster than we think.

638
00:54:21,277 --> 00:54:22,570
Have advanced beyond the limit line.

639
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:26,739
How much further?

640
00:54:29,537 --> 00:54:32,078
Encourage you to do the things you want to do
.

641
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:38,753
That attempt.

642
00:54:51,434 --> 00:54:54,768
- Adorable.
- Boring! Runs other!

643
00:54:55,812 --> 00:54:57,146
What to do?
I shot a rocket?

644
00:54:57,354 --> 00:55:00,482
- Yes! A rocket!
- Okay.

645
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:01,692
Remind me again why you're here?

646
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:06,738
Your father told me to cut the legs
if not come.

647
00:55:07,449 --> 00:55:10,117
Well, this will be very noisy.

648
00:55:18,544 --> 00:55:19,792
Okay...

649
00:55:20,253 --> 00:55:23,212
- Right?
- Okay.

650
00:55:27,218 --> 00:55:31,263
- Not bad what else you got?
- Enough for a show.

651
00:55:31,264 --> 00:55:33,139
YES! Runs more!

652
00:55:34,391 --> 00:55:37,019
Ready? Okay, here we go.

653
00:55:40,899 --> 00:55:43,610
One, two...

654
00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:45,361
Three...

655
00:55:46,653 --> 00:55:48,864
Four...

656
00:55:49,615 --> 00:55:51,657
Five!

657
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:54,496
Six, seven...

658
00:55:54,996 --> 00:55:57,539
Eight, nine...

659
00:56:40,873 --> 00:56:43,377
Tessa.

660
00:56:44,128 --> 00:56:46,338
What's the worst that could happen?

661
00:56:47,843 --> 00:56:50,049
Do not know.

662
00:56:50,717 --> 00:56:52,803
'm Ready.

663
00:57:10,321 --> 00:57:13,282
Zooey was right, I feel alive!

664
00:57:40,392 --> 00:57:41,809
Good morning Dad!

665
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:43,186
Did you sleep well?

666
00:57:43,313 --> 00:57:45,230
Who are you and what have you done with my daughter?

667
00:57:46,106 --> 00:57:48,024
Sit.

668
00:57:48,608 --> 00:57:50,694
Eat, drink coffee.

669
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:06,626
- Dad, I want you to meet someone.
- Oh God!

670
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:10,630
- He is Ajon, Ajon he is Dad.
- Nice to meet you Lord.

671
00:58:11,674 --> 00:58:14,758
- No need to call Him Lord.
- Lord, be well.

672
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:18,930
- Excellent, who wants a piece of toast?
- Can go.

673
00:58:19,056 --> 00:58:20,849
And miss the fun?

674
00:58:21,226 --> 00:58:24,143
Okay Tess.

675
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:31,650
- Sit.
- If.

676
00:58:40,536 --> 00:58:41,515
Is terrible
life of a man, the...

677
00:58:41,516 --> 00:58:42,494
... Day her daughter
brings a boy home.

678
00:58:45,331 --> 00:58:48,250
Always thought that if he killed the
first, the others would voice.

679
00:58:52,925 --> 00:58:54,548
- Are you going to college?
- Yes, I had a place.

680
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:56,049
Only
I have to do some things first.

681
00:58:56,926 --> 00:58:59,470
Is what happened, I'm sorry for your loss
.

682
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,890
- If...
- How's your mom?

683
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,935
Some days are good, if...

684
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:07,603
Should think Tessa.

685
00:59:08,355 --> 00:59:10,398
- You know, about your condition.
- I told him.

686
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,608
No, of course not.

687
00:59:13,695 --> 00:59:17,739
Want
find her attractive and believe me, has not told you everything.

688
00:59:21,075 --> 00:59:22,910
How old are you?

689
00:59:23,161 --> 00:59:24,744
Why?

690
00:59:25,122 --> 00:59:27,123
Because at your age, you should not have to be
caring for someone.

691
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:30,043
- Tessa needs no care.
- Yeah, sure you do.

692
00:59:31,212 --> 00:59:31,961
Every day more.

693
00:59:32,712 --> 00:59:35,380
And you, my friend, you are not
height task.

694
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,386
So why do not we
do everyone a favor...

695
00:59:39,387 --> 00:59:40,761
... And let live
what's left of his life.

696
01:00:00,742 --> 01:00:02,324
How did you make your dad
lend the car?

697
01:00:03,118 --> 01:00:04,952
Do not do not you talking?

698
01:00:05,663 --> 01:00:08,747
Knew there was one thing I forgot to ask
.

699
01:00:11,544 --> 01:00:13,586
Well, thanks for the ride.

700
01:00:14,796 --> 01:00:17,548
I thought all the girls would be
clutching handkerchiefs and crying.

701
01:00:19,176 --> 01:00:20,509
I can at least pay for privacy.

702
01:00:23,388 --> 01:00:25,139
You'll get over.

703
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:28,100
No, never.

704
01:00:29,186 --> 01:00:30,644
Never exceed He hates me.

705
01:00:35,023 --> 01:00:36,566
Do you hate me?

706
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,863
Only talk to them today.

707
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:42,739
On another visit?

708
01:00:44,992 --> 01:00:47,327
Yes, I want to finish. Yes?

709
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:49,829
Zooey Walker?

710
01:00:50,207 --> 01:00:51,791
We're ready for you now.

711
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:53,792
Just want it out.

712
01:01:05,347 --> 01:01:06,931
Do you hear that?

713
01:01:07,432 --> 01:01:11,184
- It was not my fault.
- The brake must be wrong.

714
01:01:13,396 --> 01:01:14,813
Okay.

715
01:01:16,357 --> 01:01:18,108
Tess, you know I have no choice.

716
01:01:19,861 --> 01:01:21,988
Do not even know that those words mean.

717
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:28,409
You should not go with me, if
not going to agree.

718
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,329
Because that's why you asked.

719
01:01:57,774 --> 01:01:59,692
Good night.

720
01:02:01,235 --> 01:02:01,818
It was the first time you drive.

721
01:02:01,986 --> 01:02:03,735
The first in the world.

722
01:02:04,279 --> 01:02:06,990
- Well, you did great.
- You think so?

723
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:10,493

changes.

deserves what he gets.

725

- Just try to keep you safe.
- I think that ship has sailed do not you think?

726
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:26,842
Do you want to go on a date with me?

727
01:02:27,553 --> 01:02:29,784

Why?

735
01:03:06,341 --> 01:03:07,843
Because I have an appointment.

736
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:14,724

737
01:03:33,285 --> 01:03:36,079

01:03:42,253 --> 01:03:44,754
No, Tessa is going to sea.

741
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:47,423
What should I do?! I do not know...

742
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:52,178

- I have to be somewhere.

744
01:03:58,518 --> 01:03:59,393
Call your father.

745
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:02,022
Should  call your father?
Do not know what to do, tell me to do.

746
01:04:02,148 --> 01:04:03,690
- Just bring me ice.
- What?

747
01:04:03,774 --> 01:04:07,151
Ice! A bag of frozen peas
would be much better.

748
01:04:08,777 --> 01:04:10,947
Sure, frozen peas.

749
01:04:18,372 --> 01:04:19,913

01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:50,504
What good, there you are!

765
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:55,258
Great, any sign of bleeding

766
01:05:57,137 --> 01:05:58,637

767
01:05:59,223 --> 01:06:02,265
- I'm sorry, did I?...
- I've been with a headache?

768
01:06:02,351 --> 01:06:04,558
Did you notice any bruises?

769
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:07,855
- I set, to be honest.
- When was your last incision?

770
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:10,525
I'm not sure, I can try to find
.

771
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:13,109
Did you use some kind of aspirin
recently?

772
01:06:13,193 --> 01:06:16,321
I do not know... Sorry, I have no answers
to all those questions.

773
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,700
The last transfusion was  May 18.

774
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,702
Okay, thanks, do not talk.

775
01:06:21,787 --> 01:06:24,496
Mom! Grab the hand of your daughter.

776
01:06:25,832 --> 01:06:27,479
Okay, grab the hand of your mother,

777
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,127
once to say "yes"
and twice for "no".

778
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,712
Understood? Do not talk.

779
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,882
- If...
- Any sign of back pain?

780
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:38,093
- Headaches? Bruises??
- No.

781
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:42,515
- Did you use t-gel or other anti-inflammatory
? - No, no.

782
01:06:43,142 --> 01:06:46,185
I'm afraid we'll have to cauterize your nose
.

783
01:06:46,563 --> 01:06:48,228
You been seared before?

784
01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:49,520
- If.
- Okay.

785
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,022
We will need many units of blood.

786
01:06:53,985 --> 01:06:56,194
It will be a tough night, coming home tomorrow
.

787
01:06:57,739 --> 01:06:59,657
Already know everything in the end.

788
01:07:21,889 --> 01:07:25,641
They said it was  a nosebleed,
you know, the kind of bad.

789
01:07:28,602 --> 01:07:32,815
Had to close his nose...

790
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:36,653
- Gauze obstructive.
- Yeah, that.

791
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:40,404
And before transferring units,
I did a little cleaning.

792
01:07:43,158 --> 01:07:45,452
's Stable.

793
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:56,379
You did good.

794
01:08:00,802 --> 01:08:02,261
I'm home,
can go now if you want.

795
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,681
I can stay?

796
01:08:11,312 --> 01:08:13,480
YES!

797
01:08:58,358 --> 01:09:00,150
How are you feeling?

798
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,989
Sleepy, thanks for being there.

799
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:09,660
It was a little difficult,
for your guy too.

800
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,457
But it was understandable.

801
01:09:18,295 --> 01:09:19,961
This is a sweet pastry.

802
01:09:22,717 --> 01:09:25,217
Yes, it is exactly as you describe.

803
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:27,219
What would you say?

804
01:09:29,973 --> 01:09:32,182
Well, not with me, so I think
left me.

805
01:09:34,812 --> 01:09:40,275
- Did not call or come after us?
- No.

806
01:09:42,027 --> 01:09:43,820
Perhaps  panic.

807
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,035
Oh my God!

808
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,413
- What?
- Look at the bridge.

809
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:03,004
Are you serious?

810
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:12,347
Tessa wrote everywhere!

811
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:32,744
I did.

812
01:10:34,287 --> 01:10:36,245
Put ​​my name in the world.

813
01:10:47,216 --> 01:10:49,510
Juggling sticks!
Would I buy this?!

814
01:10:50,177 --> 01:10:52,429
- Happy Birthday!
- Can you teach me?

815
01:10:52,807 --> 01:10:55,808
If... A little, yes.
I will help you to practice then, if you want.

816
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:59,145
- Dad I can stay for dinner??
- No.

817
01:10:59,897 --> 01:11:02,273
- Mom?
- I do not know honey.

818
01:11:03,233 --> 01:11:05,483
- Thanks.
- But let it stay.

819
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:07,820
It's a conspiracy!

820
01:11:09,282 --> 01:11:11,615
Okay, on with the show of magic
.

821
01:11:12,033 --> 01:11:14,118
Choose a letter...

822
01:11:15,162 --> 01:11:16,662
Five of hearts.

823
01:11:16,829 --> 01:11:18,623
No. ..

824
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:21,959
Why  I can not say right?!
And that day, shall be in the pants.

825
01:11:22,627 --> 01:11:24,628
Cute,
was about to say that right?

826
01:11:24,879 --> 01:11:26,879
Demons!

827
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:53,241
Fall into the hands of fate.

828
01:11:57,953 --> 01:11:59,747
How goes the list?

829
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:02,916
The things that I thought mattered
no longer interested.

830
01:12:05,502 --> 01:12:08,548
- What about you?
- Have something you want to put in there?

831
01:12:09,717 --> 01:12:11,926
I want to fly.

832
01:12:13,136 --> 01:12:16,512
Never think of that sort of thing... Right?

833
01:12:17,974 --> 01:12:19,558
But... I guess so.

834
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:27,483
Come on, you know, just like you.

835
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:30,193
- Adam...
- Yes?

836
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,154
Stick your head in the game.

837
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,119
Think.

838
01:12:40,162 --> 01:12:41,370
What are your expectations?

839
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,250
Your dreams...

840
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:50,588
- Right now?
- If...

841
01:13:00,183 --> 01:13:04,353
- Hands off me!
- Right!

842
01:13:04,354 --> 01:13:06,395
If your nose gets elsewhere.

843
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:10,359
Anda, runs through
other hand, you can.

844
01:13:12,195 --> 01:13:13,947
Running, well, concentrating.

845
01:13:15,615 --> 01:13:19,785
That's it! Tessa Scott is in the house!

846
01:13:23,623 --> 01:13:26,834
How do you stop?! Use the wall.

847
01:13:30,045 --> 01:13:31,503
Hello you.

848
01:13:32,004 --> 01:13:34,007
Hello.

849
01:13:36,593 --> 01:13:38,095
You had to leave.

850
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:41,765
I kept falling, my bones ache.

851
01:13:50,816 --> 01:13:52,694
We're staying with the baby.

852
01:13:56,447 --> 01:14:01,285
- Really?
- If...

853
01:14:01,785 --> 01:14:03,201
If...

854
01:14:04,872 --> 01:14:07,916
Y is a girl... We're having a girl.

855
01:14:10,378 --> 01:14:12,419
And call her Lauren.

856
01:14:13,714 --> 01:14:15,631
I will.

857
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,094
I want to be there!

858
01:14:20,053 --> 01:14:22,847
If you do not want me at birth, I can sit outside and enter
then.

859
01:14:27,145 --> 01:14:29,810
I want to be the first person to
the world, to embrace your baby.

860
01:14:34,443 --> 01:14:36,194
Will be in 5 months.

861
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:39,070
So I have a goal.

862
01:15:11,354 --> 01:15:13,355
Some people find this very beautiful.

863
01:15:14,232 --> 01:15:16,610
All I can think is that
is killing my poor plants.

864
01:15:19,988 --> 01:15:21,490
What about Tess?

865
01:15:23,324 --> 01:15:25,493
Not enough.

866
01:15:27,288 --> 01:15:28,247
What do you mean?

867
01:15:29,749 --> 01:15:30,998
Stay with me.

868
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:33,084
Stay at night.

869
01:15:34,961 --> 01:15:37,463
Tess do you want?

870
01:15:38,216 --> 01:15:42,636
At night, sleep together and wake up together
.

871
01:15:43,596 --> 01:15:45,098
Breakfast...

872
01:15:46,516 --> 01:15:49,014
What you really want?

873
01:15:53,105 --> 01:15:55,398
I want you with me.

874
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:00,110
You to hold me.

875
01:16:00,735 --> 01:16:02,237
You take care and follow me loving

876
01:16:05,783 --> 01:16:07,325
help me when I'm scared something.

877
01:16:11,456 --> 01:16:14,082
That touches the edge of my bed and see
is there.

878
01:16:20,132 --> 01:16:21,716
What would happen if
make things right?

879
01:16:23,636 --> 01:16:26,051
Is impossible to do it wrong.

880
01:16:44,156 --> 01:16:46,032
For you.

881
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,659
Is a snow angel.

882
01:16:59,671 --> 01:17:01,672
- No, no, no and no.
- Dad!

883
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,632
This is in the list?

884
01:17:04,008 --> 01:17:05,552
That a guy will get to sleep?

885
01:17:05,927 --> 01:17:08,761
- Forget it, no.
- You know? This is not easy for me.

886
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:10,972
Well, it's easy for me
, answer that.

887
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:13,559
I thought you wanted to talk.

888
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,143
Not about this, do not let
, end of discussion.

889
01:17:16,187 --> 01:17:17,979
Do not be like me.

890
01:17:18,521 --> 01:17:20,607
I have rights, I am your father.

891
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:23,652
Not by much.

892
01:17:31,745 --> 01:17:35,997
- Are you ready?
- Is very far.

893
01:17:36,207 --> 01:17:39,044
- Just jump!
- Too far!

894
01:17:39,794 --> 01:17:41,836
- Good night, then.
- Wait!

895
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,341
- What are you doing?
- I can not jump.

896
01:17:46,384 --> 01:17:48,551
Not going to step

897
01:17:50,888 --> 01:17:53,180
Oh my God!

898
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:56,393
- Are you okay?
- No, I broke my nose.

899
01:17:57,228 --> 01:18:00,438
- And both arms.
- I broke everything.

900
01:18:02,692 --> 01:18:05,193
- Hello.

He's in there right?

903
01:18:52,825 --> 01:18:53,993
If.

904
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,078
I told you not want that.

905
01:18:59,582 --> 01:19:00,958
Why not?

906
01:19:01,584 --> 01:19:03,251
Do you know why?

907
01:19:03,836 --> 01:19:05,627
I think so.

908
01:19:05,796 --> 01:19:09,967
Tessa's a good guy, but guys...
You can not trust them.

909
01:19:11,302 --> 01:19:12,969
Can you disappointed.

910
01:19:13,846 --> 01:19:15,597
It will not.

911
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,599
What if is that if you do?

912
01:19:20,186 --> 01:19:22,895
So, although you'll have to you.

913
01:19:24,356 --> 01:19:26,525
As always.

914
01:19:46,462 --> 01:19:47,962
This is too good.

915
01:19:48,338 --> 01:19:50,297
Except for onion.

916
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:52,551
For just eat at home.

917
01:20:04,103 --> 01:20:06,397
- I wish I could do that.
- If you can.

918
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:10,983
No. .. I can do two and you.

919

- Many things.

922

Spring.

Roasted Potatoes.

A train journey.

925
01:20:32,799 --> 01:20:36,176

- Breakfast in bed.

926
01:20:36,427 --> 01:20:38,011
A joint bank account.

927
01:20:39,182 --> 01:20:41,224
Hearing you snoring years and years.

928
01:20:41,809 --> 01:20:44,601
- Do not snore... Or if?
- You will, when you are old.

929
01:20:46,146 --> 01:20:48,772
Fighting for parenthood, but
know that our son is a genius.

930
01:20:49,525 --> 01:20:51,608
Actually, our three children.

931
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,111
Three children.

932
01:20:53,194 --> 01:20:54,780
Justin, Marilyn and Daysi.

933
01:20:56,031 --> 01:20:57,741
God!

934
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:03,245
<i> Be with you, be with you... </ i>

935
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:07,875
<i> Just to be with you. </ I>

936
01:21:11,337 --> 01:21:13,505
So you still love doing her magic
?

937
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:17,050
- You tell me about it. - Should
recommending to all my patients.

938
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,761
YES! I got a text message!

939
01:21:18,971 --> 01:21:21,349
It has a new cell .

940
01:21:21,724 --> 01:21:23,850
- Is growing.
- E51.

941
01:21:24,225 --> 01:21:26,643
That was by the fountain in the park
, that I put E1.

942
01:21:27,936 --> 01:21:29,772
Account
what you've been doing recently.

943
01:21:30,274 --> 01:21:32,568
Oh yeah, I'm doing
hidden treasure games.

944
01:21:32,735 --> 01:21:36,111
Tyre
garlic all doors and corners.

945
01:21:36,614 --> 01:21:40,241
Which is disgusting, but I thought...

946
01:21:41,951 --> 01:21:43,410
What?

947
01:21:44,787 --> 01:21:46,748
What happens?

948
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:53,919
Tessa?

949
01:21:55,215 --> 01:21:59,345
- Where is your father?
- Saying something my mom.

950
01:22:00,803 --> 01:22:03,055
What is he saying?

951
01:22:03,305 --> 01:22:05,474
Hopefully come right?

952
01:22:06,852 --> 01:22:08,603
I'm the one who is sick, not them.

953
01:22:08,935 --> 01:22:11,021
Not them.

954
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:14,275
How sick please?

955
01:22:18,653 --> 01:22:21,031
Your spread of cancer is very high.

956
01:22:23,534 --> 01:22:25,663
Your immune system is collapsing.

957
01:22:28,538 --> 01:22:30,165
Cancer is now everywhere.

958
01:22:34,003 --> 01:22:36,213
How long more do I have?

959
01:22:37,924 --> 01:22:39,925
I will not go to timescales.

960
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:43,928
Not sue if he was wrong.

961
01:22:47,726 --> 01:22:49,810
My best friend gave birth in April.

962
01:22:52,565 --> 01:22:54,314
Can I know your baby?

963
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:01,613
No.

964
01:23:38,151 --> 01:23:40,317

Oh no! I'm sorry honey,

967
01:24:01,466 --> 01:24:03,636

- Inauguration Day?
- If college.

970
01:24:11,685 --> 01:24:15,227
I was so happy when he said he would take his place
in September.

971
01:24:16,022 --> 01:24:19,149
There were times when I thought,
would lose another 12 months.

972
01:24:19,777 --> 01:24:21,525
Not want to be the oldest among all.

973
01:24:21,902 --> 01:24:23,778
Right?

974
01:24:24,613 --> 01:24:25,906
No.

975
01:24:26,991 --> 01:24:29,453
No one wants that.

976
01:25:37,103 --> 01:25:39,395

977
01:25:40,022 --> 01:25:42,231

Monster!

981
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,506
Do you want to leave me with nothing?

982
01:26:12,055 --> 01:26:14,681
Is this all?

983
01:26:14,974 --> 01:26:16,558
Does the list?

You should show me.

986
01:26:29,947 --> 01:26:31,739
I could have helped with a couple.

987
01:26:33,492 --> 01:26:35,868
Just wanted to help.

988
01:26:36,827 --> 01:26:39,037
I could not help.

989
01:26:39,581 --> 01:26:42,208
I can not help.

990
01:26:42,961 --> 01:26:44,919
Not want you to go.

991

I will be I,
to stay here alone.

1002
01:27:59,243 --> 01:28:01,956
Do not you dare feel bad about yourself
, because you'll be left behind.

1003
01:28:02,331 --> 01:28:05,041
- Do not you dare!
- This was what you wanted.

1004
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:09,460
Come on, I know, this is what

Grande, many buildings, I missed.

1013
01:29:12,068 --> 01:29:13,860
We'll manage.

1014
01:29:16,028 --> 01:29:18,197
- Shall we?
- If...

1015

You'll want to sleep much.

Hello.

1029

I keep thinking about my own baby.

I think you hit the worst luck in the world
.

1038

And if I were in your shoes
, be afraid.

If... It was very boring.

1072
01:35:25,646 --> 01:35:27,106
How Mr. Welmont?

1073
01:35:27,483 --> 01:35:29,858
Says it was fine, so
that mom bought me this.

1074
01:35:30,151 --> 01:35:33,320
- I turn around and make sounds like that.
- Yes, but not in the house.

1075
01:35:36,073 --> 01:35:37,949
How come you awake?

1076
01:35:37,991 --> 01:35:41,202
These all sweaty.

1077
01:35:41,203 --> 01:35:43,371
- I'll change your sheets for you.
- I will.

1078
01:35:43,414 --> 01:35:47,208
- I can make your bed.
- Not a nurse.

1079
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,084
Not true!

1080
01:35:49,252 --> 01:35:53,173
Okay! I'll do without.
Listen Tess, like whistling.

1081
01:36:05,852 --> 01:36:08,104
Coming.

1083
01:36:36,759 --> 01:36:41,261
'll Be okay.

1084
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:05,870
- Adam.
- If beauty?

1085
01:37:06,871 --> 01:37:10,208
- Do not let me fall.
- I have.

1086
01:37:10,292 --> 01:37:12,878
- I'm falling.
- No you're falling.
