1
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:56,949
Break's over. Back to
the dance floor. It's swing time.

2
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:05,253
What's cookin', Guy?

3
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:08,733
Hey, you look like your wife
just ran off with the mailman.

4
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:11,896
I can't laugh, Shirl.
I'm really upset.

5
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,803
What is it?

6
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:17,809
Break's over.
You got a customer waitin'.

7
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:19,845
Hey, that's not important.

8
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:23,041
If I have to pick between
business and people...

9
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:24,583
it's people every time.

10
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:27,376
Shoot.

11
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:30,446
It's about one of the employees.

12
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:33,321
Oh, forget it.
You go on to your customers.

13
00:02:33,393 --> 00:02:35,953
No, no, it's okay.
Go ahead.

14
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:40,398
This employee is a real sweetheart,
but she can't keep her yap shut.

15
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:44,198
She's so busy talking to the stupid
customers about their stupid problems...

16
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,204
it takes her forever
to get to her next lesson.

17
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:48,604
You want me to talk to her?

18
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:51,405
I'm good with helping people
with their problems.

19
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:54,276
I've tried.
It doesn't do any good.

20
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:58,249
What more can I do? Tattoo
"Time is money" on my forehead?

21
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,948
Well, I hate to say this
'cause I see you care.

22
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:05,753
Maybe you're just gonna
have to let her go.

23
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:10,659
Consider it effective immediately.

24
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,230
Me?

25
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,201
You could've knocked me over
with a feather.

26
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,500
Boy, he really set you up.

27
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:22,700
I can't believe I actually
recommended firing myself.

28
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:25,973
Sometimes I dream about
seeing Guy dropped on his head...

29
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:27,980
from a tall building.

30
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:30,573
Wait a second.
I have to make a wish.

31
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,347
Shirl, you got to do this every day?

32
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,412
Do you have a coin?

33
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,016
If I don't make my wish,
somethin' bad's gonna happen.

34
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:42,527
It already happened.
You got fired.

35
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:46,156
That's just great, Shirl.

36
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:48,427
What are we supposed to live on now?

37
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:51,937
I thought you might try
lookin' for a job again.

38
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:53,768
In this stinkin' town?

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,833
There ain't no jobs in this town.
I'm sick of lookin'.

40
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:01,677
This might be a great time
for us to move to Chicago.

41
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:04,546
Pack our bags
and head to the big city.

42
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:06,050
What do you say?

43
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:08,110
You want to pick up
and leave everyone...

44
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:10,315
leave all our friends.

45
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,188
This town's dyin'.
We're dyin' with it.

46
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,750
You been out of work how long?
Eight months, nine?

47
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,094
I know you've looked hard,
but it's like you've given up.

48
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:21,963
Chicago, huh?

49
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:24,469
What is so goddamn great
about Chicago?

50
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:28,473
What's so great about Chicago
is that it's not Flat River.

51
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,475
You can't even cook, Shirl.

52
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:32,841
You can't even keep
a half-assed job...

53
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:35,472
pushing some old farts
around the dance floor.

54
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:38,745
Everything you do gets screwed up.

55
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:42,678
- Where you goin'?
- Get a couple of beers.

56
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:45,691
You got a whole
six-pack left.

57
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,159
I'm goin' out, Shirl.

58
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:50,526
Steve, I'm leavin'.

59
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:53,898
I'm leavin', Steve!

60
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:56,458
Go on then.

61
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,834
What about us gettin' married?

62
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:01,135
Ain't you been married enough?

63
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:03,573
I'll see you when I get home.

64
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:08,273
- I won't be here.
- You wanna bet?

65
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:38,066
I'm taking your bowling bag.

66
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:42,080
It's been a long dark night

67
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:46,881
And I been waitin' for morning

68
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:50,821
It's been a long hard fight

69
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:56,829
But I see a brand-new day
a-dawnin'

70
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:02,892
I been lookin' for the sunshine

71
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:09,238
'Cause I ain't seen it in so long

72
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:14,303
Everything's gonna work out just fine

73
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,575
Everything's gonna be all right

74
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,914
That's been all wrong

75
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:25,788
'Cause I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

76
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:31,991
I can see the light
of a brand-new day

77
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:38,903
I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

78
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:40,997
And everything's gonna be all right

79
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:43,838
It's gonna be okay

80
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,341
It's been a long, long time

81
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:56,184
Since I've known the taste of freedom

82
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:59,851
And those clinging vines

83
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:05,956
That had me bound
Well, I don't need 'em

84
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:11,595
'Cause I am strong and I can prove it

85
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:18,201
And I got my dreams to see me through

86
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:22,578
It's just a mountain I can move it

87
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:29,316
And with faith and love
there's nothing I can't do

88
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:35,294
And I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

89
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:41,095
And I can see the light
of a brand-new day

90
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:48,071
I can see the light of
a clear blue morning

91
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,074
And everything's gonna be all right

92
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:54,203
It's gonna be okay

93
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,617
I can see the light,
I can see the light

94
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:05,214
I can see the light,
I can see the light

95
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:10,659
Oh!

96
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,994
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

97
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:30,673
Hey.!

98
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,411
Hey!

99
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,565
Ohh!

100
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,630
I gotcha!

101
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,896
Hold on! Hold on!

102
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:29,566
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

103
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:32,907
I gotcha.
Don't look down.

104
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:36,846
Put your foot there.

105
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,352
Put your arm around me.
Put your arm around my neck.

106
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:42,387
Okay, ready?

107
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:45,686
Don't look down.

108
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:49,322
Are you okay?

109
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:53,525
Are you nuts? Get away from me.
You almost killed me.

110
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,295
Wait a minute.
I just saved your life.

111
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:59,065
You could've killed me,
and I lost my 20 bucks.

112
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:01,868
You weren't trying to kill yourself?

113
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:04,705
Why should I?
You were gonna do it for me.

114
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:08,611
- Then I guess I didn't save your life.
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.

115
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:12,447
Maybe somebody'll try to
kill themselves tomorrow.

116
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:15,043
Well, you don't have to get
sarcastic about it.

117
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:17,555
It's breakfast time.
Check out the restaurants.

118
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:21,423
You might find somebody not choking you
can give the Heimlich maneuver to.

119
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:25,794
I took time off work to stop you
from jumping off a bridge.

120
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,390
It isn't my fault you
weren't trying to jump.

121
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,628
Okay, you were just tryin' to help.

122
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:34,639
- Okay, here, here. Take this.
- What are you doin'?

123
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:37,403
If you're willing to risk
your neck for $20...

124
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:39,376
you need it more than I do.

125
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:41,879
It shouldn't cost you money
to do a good deed.

126
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:45,644
But the next time you want to save
somebody, make sure they need saving.

127
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:50,082
Hey, lady, everybody needs saving.

128
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:22,418
120, 140, 160, 180.

129
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:24,769
Doesn't leave me much
for breakfast, does it?

130
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,050
I wouldn't know.

131
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,220
Doesn't hurt your mouth
to give a smile.

132
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:55,648
Remember that city hall
deficit scandal piece you did?

133
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,985
That was a great story.

134
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:01,493
And that convicted child molester
who they hired...

135
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,551
to drive a school bus in Waukegan.

136
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:06,530
They do background checks
on new drivers based on that.

137
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,239
I don't have anything
new for you, Milo.

138
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,159
Nothing?

139
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:11,169
Nothing's panned out yet.

140
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:13,353
It's a big city, Jack.
Find me something.

141
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:15,469
Don't I always?

142
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,805
Remember, you're only as good...

143
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:19,811
...as your next story.

144
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,211
Big city, Jack.

145
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:39,187
Thanks, lady.

146
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:47,971
Miss, I'll have that
early bird special and coffee.

147
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:52,805
One big spender, comin' up.

148
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:54,971
That's one juice.

149
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:58,450
Thank you.

150
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:01,402
Excuse me, would you
pass me the sugar?

151
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:03,085
Sure.

152
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:07,091
- Oh, damn it to hell!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,649
I am so sorry.

154
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:13,960
It's not the coffee.
I am just so ticked off.

155
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,695
You want to talk about it?

156
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:21,570
Did you ever try dating a workaholic
when their work's not going so great?

157
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,074
No, I never did date a workaholic.

158
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:26,805
I sometimes wish I had, though.

159
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,439
The guys I date don't
work at all mostly.

160
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:31,449
Believe me, it's no picnic.

161
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:34,611
He makes dates, breaks them,
stays at the office all night.

162
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:38,885
Another woman I could fight, but
how do you compete against a job?

163
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:41,482
Where are you when
he breaks these dates?

164
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,221
Waiting for him.

165
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,321
- Maybe that's your problem.
- What do you mean?

166
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:49,526
Why should he hurry home
if he knows you're there?

167
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:53,059
He's taking you for granted.
Get on with your life.

168
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:56,505
If he wants you, you're busy.
He'll come around or he won't.

169
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:58,873
Either way you'll
be livin', not waitin'.

170
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,478
That makes sense.

171
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:07,645
Sometimes you got to get out
and honk your own horn.

172
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:11,185
The early bird special.

173
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:15,788
Boy, the bird part's right.

174
00:14:27,873 --> 00:14:31,536
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was an all-nighter, again.

175
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,478
I didn't call 'cause I kept
thinking I was gonna finish up.

176
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:39,005
I didn't wanna wake you.
I hope you didn't wait up.

177
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:41,848
No, I didn't wait up.

178
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,946
Uh, as a matter of fact, I went out.

179
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:48,356
Oh good, good.
What do you mean "out"?

180
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:52,523
- I went out with a friend.
- Good. Good.

181
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:54,793
What do you mean, "a friend"?

182
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:56,562
Why are you so suspicious?

183
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:59,536
I don't question you
about being at work.

184
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:02,039
If I say I'm at work, I'm at work.

185
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:04,598
I can vouch for his being at work.
That's what he told me.

186
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:06,268
Why would he lie to me?

187
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:08,370
- Oh God!
- You know each other?

188
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:10,881
He tried to push me off
a bridge this morning.

189
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:13,349
I tried to stop you from jumping.

190
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:16,046
- I was not tryin' to jump.
- Excuse me.

191
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:19,284
- I'll make it up to you tonight.
- I'm busy tonight.

192
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:21,622
- Are you gonna eat that?
- Go right ahead.

193
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:24,253
How can you be busy tonight?

194
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,025
- I made other plans, Jack.
- What other plans?

195
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:29,567
I want to go on with my life.

196
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:31,569
I want to live, not wait.

197
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:35,664
I'm going to honk my
own horn for a change.

198
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:38,039
What have you done with Janice?

199
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,045
I didn't realize how much
you'd been taking me for granted...

200
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:43,081
until it was pointed out to me.

201
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:46,049
What brilliant mind pointed that out?

202
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:49,110
You want to wreck
my entire day, lady?

203
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:51,713
I don't want to get
in the middle of this.

204
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,457
It's a little late.

205
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,138
This is not about
her, this is about you.

206
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:58,129
You wanna know what your
problem is? You're at work.

207
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,631
When you're not at work,
you're brooding about work.

208
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:03,133
So let me tell you
where I'm gonna be.

209
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:06,933
I am going to be out with
someone that really values me.

210
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:09,997
- This woman...
- Shirlee.

211
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:13,602
...made me see that
I can do a lot better.

212
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,613
So long, Jack.

213
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:27,658
Thank you...

214
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:30,661
- Shirlee.
- Shirlee.

215
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:33,095
It's been a great thrill meeting you.

216
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:36,032
I wish it were
a little later in life...

217
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:38,467
like on my deathbed.

218
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:56,215
It's a dirty job
but somebody's gotta do it

219
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:59,382
Better get to it Somebody's
gotta do it whatever it takes

220
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:03,888
Shh!

221
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,826
A ny work at all is better than none

222
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,562
Better buckle down to it
gotta get the job done

223
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:12,900
Gotta earn my pay

224
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:14,836
I gotta earn my pay

225
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:18,570
Excuse me. I came
to see about the job.

226
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:23,103
I don't think so.

227
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:26,446
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

228
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:29,009
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

229
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,578
Somebody

230
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:34,922
I can think of better
things I'd rather do

231
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:37,689
I might get lucky and I'm hoping to

232
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:42,860
But until I do I gotta compromise

233
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:45,733
The job ain't much
but at least it's mine

234
00:17:45,804 --> 00:17:48,238
It beats standing in
the unemployment line

235
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:52,573
Put pride aside and I improvise

236
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:55,909
Even if I do get a better job

237
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:59,280
Somebody else has got to fill my spot

238
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:02,047
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

239
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,782
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

240
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:07,416
Somebody's gotta do it, do it

241
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:10,689
Somebody, somebody

242
00:18:10,762 --> 00:18:12,787
Somebody's gotta do it

243
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:15,594
Somebody's gotta do it, yeah

244
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:21,162
It's a funky job,
it's a low-down dirty job

245
00:18:27,346 --> 00:18:30,543
Great, Angel.
Now show us your tits.

246
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:45,862
Even if the rules
are too hard to follow

247
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,695
Even when pride
is too hard to swallow

248
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:52,066
- It was a "dry" T-shirt contest.
- You are funny, Bob.

249
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:55,300
Bill, there's something really
ugly crawling up your shirt.

250
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:58,810
- That's my tie, Bob.
- Sorry, Bill.

251
00:18:58,877 --> 00:19:02,677
It's time for the morning traffic.

252
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:05,842
Today's morning traffic
report brought to you by...

253
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:09,216
Chateau J. Simpson, the wine
that used to play football.

254
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:12,916
W-N-D-Y. I'll put you right through.

255
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:17,587
Okay, ice cream delivery,
waitress, cocktail waitress...

256
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:20,631
- bartender.
- I was just workin' my way up.

257
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:23,167
Waitress, manicurist...
no reception work.

258
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:28,331
- Hello, W-N-D-Y.
- Not exactly, but I have a phone.

259
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:31,672
I've answered phones.
Who hasn't?

260
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:35,201
I'd really like to hire you, but you
need experience to work a VMX-2000.

261
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,942
Hello, W-N-D-Y.

262
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:40,007
W-N-D-Y.
Hold please.

263
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:43,020
Hello, W-N-D-Y.
Mr. Perlman.

264
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:45,352
Yes, I'll put you right through.

265
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:48,882
I may not be exactly
what you're huntin' for...

266
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,794
but sometimes a dog runs
the wrong squirrel up the right tree.

267
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:54,456
Pardon me?

268
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:58,264
It's something my daddy used to say.

269
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:01,430
That's a good-lookin' man.
Is that your husband?

270
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:04,304
That's my soon-to-be
ex-husband.

271
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:06,537
Like a punch in the gut, huh?

272
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:08,943
Girl, you don't know.

273
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:12,074
Oh, I do know.
Believe me, I do know.

274
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,380
I agree. Stanford
was a little dull.

275
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:17,684
People fell asleep at
the wheel listening to her.

276
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:19,986
I made a slight error in judgment.

277
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:23,926
If Stanford was a slight error,
what was that last bozo you hired?

278
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:26,225
I want someone with a PhD.

279
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:29,290
The other stations get them
and they're killing us in the ratings.

280
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:32,825
People want to confide
their problems to a doctor.

281
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:36,806
So who did you hire to
destroy my ratings now?

282
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,242
This one's perfect.
Her name's Dr. Kendall.

283
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:43,748
Three cities were dying for her.
I outbid 'em all.

284
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,840
I interviewed her personally.

285
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:49,182
- She's just what you wanted.
- A doctor?

286
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:52,553
A trained clinical psychologist.
Three letters after her name.

287
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:54,819
I don't want anyone
too dry and technical.

288
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:56,653
She's willing to talk
down to our audience.

289
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:58,021
Not talk down.

290
00:20:58,096 --> 00:21:00,030
Talk with.
That's what I meant.

291
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:03,659
She'd better be all you say she is
for your sake, Alan.

292
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:06,203
All right, let's go, go.

293
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:11,903
You can ignore this row. It goes
straight to the Stanford show.

294
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:13,705
- Stanford?
- The call-in shrink.

295
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:17,544
Actually, there's a new one coming
in today. Name's Dr. Kendall.

296
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:19,810
You gonna be all right?

297
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:21,613
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

298
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:25,520
W-N-D-Y. Hello, this is Shirlee.

299
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:28,524
- You just put 'em on hold.
- Oh, yeah.

300
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:32,688
- Now you just cut 'em off.
- That was a personal choice.

301
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:36,130
- I'll be back real soon.
- Okay.

302
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,102
W-N-D-Y. Hello, this is Shirlee.

303
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:43,231
Can I put you through?
I'm sure gonna try.

304
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:48,611
Pet Corner. Do you have a question?

305
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:50,528
My bull terrier...

306
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:52,376
We're only taking
questions on reptiles.

307
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,385
- Pet Corner.
- Do snakes have nipples?

308
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:57,148
Good question.

309
00:21:57,221 --> 00:22:01,885
W-N-D-Y. Please hold.
W-N-D-Y. Please hold.

310
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:06,191
W-N-D-Y. I know you've been
holding and you should be grateful.

311
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:08,731
Everybody else got cut off.

312
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,202
Five minutes.
...

313
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,296
- Yo.
- Where's this new doc?

314
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:20,310
- You got me. What if she doesn't show?
- Play yesterday's news.

315
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:23,006
Then a right and I'm
in the coffee room.

316
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,572
- Got it. Thanks.
- Oh, Shirlee.

317
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,584
Oh!

318
00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:34,322
A three-car pileup has
the left lane of Kennedy...

319
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:36,622
snarling traffic in the O'Hare area.

320
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:39,322
Traffic in the western suburbs
is moving smoothly.

321
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:42,662
Folks along Lake Shore Drive
are battling construction...

322
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:46,965
and a disabled vehicle,
closing the right lane.

323
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,235
Where's the coffee
machine? Thanks.

324
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:53,071
Temperatures are expected
to top out in the mid-80s.

325
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:55,738
Look for relief within
the next couple of days.

326
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:59,249
A high-pressure front
is headed back east...

327
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:04,481
bringing lower temperatures
and a possibility of rain.

328
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:08,047
In sports, the Cubbies win after going
extra innings against the Pirates.

329
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:13,028
A sacrifice fly by Andre Dawson
homered in the winning run.

330
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:21,598
This must be our girl.

331
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:23,196
Kendall. Kendall?

332
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,435
Kendall, behind you. Kendall.

333
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,909
- Yes, hello.
- It's Kenyon.

334
00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:31,414
- Shirlee Kenyon.
- I'm sorry. I have Kendall.

335
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:33,712
I ought to know my own name.

336
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:36,685
You got any real cream?
This stuff will kill you.

337
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:39,018
I'm Tony de Santis, your producer.

338
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,388
That's Gordon Sussman.
He's the engineer.

339
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:44,019
- Hi, Kendall.
- Kenyon.

340
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:46,586
- 20 seconds.
- Nice meetin' ya.

341
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:48,632
No time for jokes.

342
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:52,157
The hold button says hold.
The kill button's next to it.

343
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:56,070
Kill button?
I just came in for coffee.

344
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,573
Put your headphones on.

345
00:23:57,641 --> 00:24:01,941
- You want me to go on the radio?
- That's very funny.

346
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:04,378
Hey now, my job description...

347
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:06,712
W-N-D-Y,
Chicago radio...

348
00:24:06,784 --> 00:24:09,344
invites you to participate
in a program...

349
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,854
designed to help you find
a more productive life.

350
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:14,550
Talk radio is about
sharing your concerns...

351
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,957
and helping to find answers
through creative solutions.

352
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:21,487
And now, W-N-D-Y's
Dr. Shirlee Kendall.

353
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:23,499
Kenyon.

354
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:26,058
Hello? Hello, Dr. Kendall?

355
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,605
My son and my husband
are fighting again...

356
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,106
Hang on.
...

357
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:33,803
This was not in my job description.

358
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:35,971
Hello, are you there?

359
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:38,378
Last night, my son hit my husband.

360
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:42,283
He's 18 and a bodybuilder.
My son, not my husband.

361
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:46,255
- Who is this?
- This is Gladys from Northbrook.

362
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:48,587
Do I know you?
...

363
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:52,117
I tried calling before.
...

364
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:54,630
The girl at lunchtime
when I was up front.

365
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:57,633
I must've cut you off.
Lord, I'm sorry about that.

366
00:24:57,701 --> 00:25:00,101
It was crazy around here.

367
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:03,402
Go ahead, Gladys.
What happened then?

368
00:25:03,474 --> 00:25:05,567
Tell me everything.

369
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:09,477
Oh, my gosh.
That's just terrible.

370
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:11,742
Maybe you could...

371
00:25:11,815 --> 00:25:14,511
Gladys, I don't know what to say.

372
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:16,883
Well, say something. God!

373
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:19,889
That's one of the worst
things I've ever heard.

374
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:23,324
This is a doctor?
I could be saying this stuff!

375
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:27,330
This is Donald. I'm 50.
My mother's in her 70s.

376
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:31,596
She moved in with me and she
still treats me like a child.

377
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:34,433
She tells me what to do
in my own home.

378
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:36,439
She's just drivin' me crazy.

379
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:39,943
Have her put to sleep.
No, I'm just kiddin'.

380
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,501
- She's your mother.
- Okay, okay.

381
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,548
Excuse me.
Comin' through.

382
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:47,345
One mama can take care of ten kids...

383
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:50,717
but ten kids can't
take care of one mama.

384
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:52,881
Let's go! Let's go!

385
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:55,391
You've stopped sleeping
with your wife.

386
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:59,691
- Isn't that what you're tryin' to say?
- I guess it is, yes.

387
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:03,631
- So who you foolin' around with?
- It's not that at all.

388
00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:06,261
I just lost interest in her.

389
00:26:06,337 --> 00:26:08,931
Yeah, and who are you
foolin' around with?

390
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:11,201
A girl in my office.

391
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:15,473
You got a wife, and
you got a girlfriend in the office?

392
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:18,344
Did you say your name was
"Bud"or "Stud"?

393
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:20,645
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:24,745
You're livin' your life so crooked,
you have to screw your socks on.

395
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:27,814
Havin' an affair is like
shootin' pool on two tables.

396
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:31,486
You may have the balls, but
you're gonna wear out your stick.

397
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:34,463
What is going on over there?

398
00:26:34,531 --> 00:26:36,556
Hi, this is Tina.

399
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:39,159
Tina, this is Shirlee.
What's cookin'?

400
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:44,640
The boss gave me notice. I was the
hardest-working waitress in the place.

401
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:47,233
He said I was messin' up
too many orders.

402
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:50,337
When I came home
and told my husband Ken...

403
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:53,383
he looked at me like
I was somethin' horrible.

404
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,945
And he said... I don't think I can
handle this on the radio.

405
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:01,924
Take your time, Tina.
I got no place to go.

406
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:06,190
He said that I was a loser,
that I couldn't hold a job...

407
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:09,755
the house was always a mess...

408
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,927
and if it weren't for him
I couldn't make it.

409
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:18,270
- He said all that to you?
- Yes, he did.

410
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:20,936
You sure?
Sure you're sure.

411
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:24,276
Tina, listen. I want you
to march up to this guy.

412
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:27,715
Tell him that you're doin'
the very best you can.

413
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:30,948
If he can't appreciate it,
you're not gonna take this crap...

414
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:34,252
that you can do just fine
on your own, thank you...

415
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:36,759
and that he's gonna be damn sorry.

416
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:41,457
Then grab your bowling bag
and get the hell out of there!

417
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:43,762
Sometimes you gotta
honk your own horn.

418
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:46,234
If you don't, nobody's
gonna know you're comin'.

419
00:27:46,303 --> 00:27:49,170
That's it.
Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

420
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:51,002
Say "bye." Bye-bye.

421
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:53,305
Oh, say good-bye.

422
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:56,346
It's been real nice spendin'
this time with you.

423
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:58,472
And like my daddy used to say...

424
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,848
quickest way to forget your problems
is to listen to somebody else's.

425
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:17,231
Move that car.!

426
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:23,103
Oh, sorry.

427
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:26,573
That was unbelievable. I have
never seen anything like that.

428
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:29,009
I didn't fall asleep once.

429
00:28:29,078 --> 00:28:32,639
That was the most horrifying...

430
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:35,980
the worst display of, of, of...

431
00:28:36,052 --> 00:28:37,986
Who are you?

432
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:40,147
- Who is she?
- Dr. Kenyon.

433
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:42,783
- Who is Dr. Kenyon?
- You just hired her.

434
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,459
I didn't hire her.
I hired Dr. Kimball.

435
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,657
Kendall.

436
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:48,663
Kenyon. What's the difference?
She's a natural.

437
00:28:48,731 --> 00:28:51,495
You don't talk.
Maybe never again.

438
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:54,866
I'm gonna make my way
back to the switchboard.

439
00:28:54,938 --> 00:28:57,964
Walk past the switchboard and get
your butt out of this building.

440
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:01,704
This is not her fault.
Your Dr. Kendall didn't show up.

441
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:04,645
I thought Kenyon was Kendall
and I put her on the air.

442
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:09,141
Oh! Oh!

443
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:14,947
I want to be absolutely
fair about this.

444
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:18,289
You're both fired!

445
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:26,868
Yeah, I've got her
leaving the building.

446
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:46,182
Blue me

447
00:29:46,255 --> 00:29:50,851
Blue me

448
00:29:52,528 --> 00:29:55,190
Hello, Steve.
It's me, Shirlee.

449
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:59,030
I can't talk long.
I ain't got much money.

450
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,331
Well, I'm sorry you went bowling
and didn't have your bowling bag.

451
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:08,207
Don't you even want
to know where I am?

452
00:30:08,277 --> 00:30:13,010
Well, if I was comin' back, I wouldn't
forget your precious bowling bag.

453
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:15,949
But I ain't comin' back
'cause I got this great job...

454
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,953
and I'm startin' tomorrow.

455
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:20,717
All my dreams are gonna come true.

456
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,953
I'm blue

457
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:27,861
I'm just as blue as can be

458
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,898
Blue me

459
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:32,730
Blue me

460
00:30:34,604 --> 00:30:36,618
Hey, Kenyon.

461
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:38,631
I just checked out.
Forwarding address unknown.

462
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:43,236
Mr. Riegert from W-N-D-Y sent me
to take you down to the station.

463
00:30:43,312 --> 00:30:45,678
- Shirlee Kenyon?
- Uh-huh.

464
00:30:45,748 --> 00:30:48,182
Hey, look, I didn't
want to be on the radio...

465
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,913
but there's no law
against it, is there?

466
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:55,390
- I thought you were great.
- You did? Who are you?

467
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,586
Name's Casey. It will be
my pleasure to drive you.

468
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:02,119
That's very sweet of you, Casey,
but I won't be needing the ride.

469
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:10,831
Why don't you do us both a favor...

470
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:13,205
and tell them I wasn't here.

471
00:31:13,276 --> 00:31:17,337
Please, Miss Kenyon. You don't
want to get me in trouble, do you?

472
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:20,211
- No.
- Then let me do my job.

473
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:33,023
Do you know what's happened
since you left here yesterday?

474
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:36,122
You hired someone else
to answer the phone?

475
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:39,862
We've received over 500 calls.

476
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:41,904
I might've cut a few people off...

477
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:44,371
We've never seen anything like it.

478
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,342
They love you.
They absolutely love you.

479
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:50,379
Look at these.

480
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:56,051
- That's right.
- Are there any more?

481
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,350
Yes, yes! Hundreds.

482
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:01,356
Wow!

483
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:05,393
I am prepared to offer
you your own program.

484
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:07,793
My own program?

485
00:32:07,864 --> 00:32:11,231
It's two hours a day, five days a
week at... What were we paying you?

486
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,134
- 250.
- I'm prepared to double that.

487
00:32:15,204 --> 00:32:18,662
Double my salary
and no reception work?

488
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:21,209
No reception work.

489
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:26,529
Hey, wait a minute.
This says Doctor Shirlee.

490
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,645
Right.

491
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:31,551
The boss wants a doctor,
so that's what you are.

492
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:33,714
Sign it.
It's not important.

493
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:36,724
Of course it's important.
It's not true.

494
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,893
Okay, $800 a week.

495
00:32:40,963 --> 00:32:43,591
But it still says Doctor Shirlee.

496
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,657
Listen, listen.

497
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:48,636
Captain Kangaroo
wasn't really a captain.

498
00:32:48,704 --> 00:32:50,695
He wasn't even a kangaroo.

499
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:53,537
Besides, no one's ever going to know.

500
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:56,578
I'm gonna come up with
a first-rate bio for you.

501
00:32:56,646 --> 00:33:00,104
It's just gonna be between
you and me and the lamppost.

502
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:02,378
In fact, not even the lamppost.

503
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:08,981
I just don't feel comfortable
pretending to be something I'm not.

504
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:11,891
If I thought I was doing
a disservice to the public...

505
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:14,862
I would be the first to say so.

506
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,456
You already went on
the air as a doctor.

507
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:20,195
If you go on and say,
"I'm not a doctor,"

508
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:22,260
what are your listeners gonna think?

509
00:33:22,338 --> 00:33:25,364
They're gonna think I'm not a doctor.

510
00:33:26,943 --> 00:33:31,403
Hey, you... you are a doctor...

511
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,414
of the heart.

512
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:35,416
You're a doctor of the heart.

513
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:37,543
You help people.

514
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,884
Look at these telegrams.
They love you.

515
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:42,584
Are you gonna let these people down?

516
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:45,786
Hmm?

517
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:50,461
The man's a real ball buster.

518
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:52,660
That's not a problem for me.

519
00:33:52,735 --> 00:33:54,760
He can be very difficult.

520
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:58,773
Don't forget.
It's doctor, doctor, doctor.

521
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:00,707
And also...

522
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,788
Also wear clean underwear
in case I get in a wreck.

523
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:04,704
Gene, this is...

524
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,943
The woman that saved
that damn shrink spot.

525
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:10,451
Oh, you've got the real common touch.

526
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,510
I like that, Kendall.

527
00:34:12,588 --> 00:34:14,988
Uh, Kenyon. My mistake.

528
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:17,457
Uh, but there...

529
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:21,860
there is a question that I'm afraid
I'm going to have to ask you, Kenyon.

530
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:28,329
Whatever it is, Mr. Perlman,
you'll get a truthful answer.

531
00:34:28,404 --> 00:34:33,205
Then tell me, how did you
get to be so darn pretty?

532
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:40,215
I want to publicize
the hell out of her.

533
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:42,274
Ads, promos, billboards.

534
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:46,583
Or maybe we should give Shirlee
a little time to settle into it...

535
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,487
and then build an audience.

536
00:34:48,557 --> 00:34:51,993
But that's how we
build an audience, Alan.

537
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:56,225
Why keep our biggest
potential asset under wraps?

538
00:34:58,301 --> 00:35:01,228
You were fantastic in there.

539
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:05,798
You played him like a violin.
You're my girl.

540
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:10,778
I wish Steve could see me now.
Boy, he'd eat his words.

541
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:12,780
Steve's the ex-husband?

542
00:35:12,848 --> 00:35:15,146
No, Steve's the guy
I was living with...

543
00:35:15,217 --> 00:35:17,481
after the last time
me and Leland got divorced.

544
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:20,784
The last time?
How many times you been...?

545
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:23,791
Three times. You've been
married three times?

546
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:27,158
- Yeah, but to the same guy.
- Oh.

547
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:30,824
He left, he came back.
We got married, we got divorced.

548
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,233
He got put in jail for shooting
a ready-teller machine.

549
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:36,703
We got divorced.
It went on and on.

550
00:35:36,772 --> 00:35:39,366
It was such a mess.

551
00:35:49,518 --> 00:35:53,386
You tell no one anything
about your past.

552
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:56,254
Anything.
I don't want you ever...

553
00:35:56,325 --> 00:35:59,692
Don't talk about your past
at all, to anyone.

554
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:02,595
No interviews 'til I make up
something right for you.

555
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:05,964
- Okay?
- Now wait a minute.

556
00:36:06,035 --> 00:36:08,697
I don't think I'm
gonna feel comfortable...

557
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:11,035
lyin' about who I am
and where I'm from.

558
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:13,166
You've got a lot to offer...

559
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:17,008
and I would hate to see
people miss out on it...

560
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,379
because of a few little mistakes you
might have made in your past.

561
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,418
Let me handle your life.

562
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:26,284
You just go out, live it.

563
00:36:29,258 --> 00:36:31,692
Ohh

564
00:36:34,797 --> 00:36:36,958
Gimme some straight talk,
straight talk

565
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:39,000
And hold the sugar please

566
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:41,161
Straight talk, straight talk

567
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:43,432
Sounds plenty sweet to me

568
00:36:43,506 --> 00:36:47,374
Don't talk to me in circles
in some mumbo-jumbo jive

569
00:36:47,443 --> 00:36:50,640
Gimme just straight talk,
straight talk

570
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:53,045
And we're gonna be all right

571
00:36:54,984 --> 00:36:56,918
Hi, this is Dr. Shirlee.

572
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:59,750
What the announcement said,
I really mean.

573
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:02,882
I'm here to talk about
your problems and concerns.

574
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,949
Anything goes so let's not be shy...

575
00:37:05,027 --> 00:37:06,619
'cause you're among friends.

576
00:37:06,695 --> 00:37:09,926
Our first caller...
Oh, good grief.

577
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,729
Look at me.

578
00:37:12,802 --> 00:37:15,066
What a mess!

579
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:18,903
I wish this was on TV so you
could see how messy I really am.

580
00:37:18,974 --> 00:37:22,410
I'm busier than a one-legged man
in a butt-kickin' contest.

581
00:37:22,478 --> 00:37:25,914
Straight talk, straight talk

582
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:28,575
So come on let's talk turkey

583
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:32,052
Just straight and to the point
about passions, about problems

584
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:34,316
A bout noses out of joint

585
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,655
Now I want you all to know I care

586
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:39,921
And I do understand

587
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:42,862
And hey thanks for lendin' me
an ear out there in radio land

588
00:37:42,932 --> 00:37:45,730
No, Martha, it isn't fair,
but life isn't fair.

589
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:48,235
Even the Declaration
of Independence...

590
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:51,239
only guarantees life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.

591
00:37:51,307 --> 00:37:53,741
It doesn't say anything about fair.

592
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:57,336
Doesn't even say you have a right
to be happy, just to pursue it.

593
00:37:57,413 --> 00:38:00,780
But no one
appreciates me and I try to be fair.

594
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,183
Get down off the cross, honey.
Somebody needs the wood.

595
00:38:06,322 --> 00:38:10,452
Straight talk, straight talk
there's nothin' like the truth

596
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:12,517
Just tell me all your troubles

597
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:15,155
Pretend I'm Donahue

598
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:17,426
So don't be shy 'cause we can talk

599
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,197
- Is that for me?
- It's all yours.

600
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,670
I feel like Mary Kay!

601
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:25,934
Hello, Shirlee here.

602
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:29,273
Yeah, hi, Dr. Shirlee.

603
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:32,906
Um, I think I'm falling in love
with a girl at work.

604
00:38:32,982 --> 00:38:35,542
I don't know how to tell her.

605
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:43,817
You little flirt.

606
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:46,612
And now Nancy will
continue our week-long

607
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:49,331
series on talk radio psychologists.

608
00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:53,732
Talk radio psychology. Quick cash,
instant breakfast, minute rice.

609
00:38:53,802 --> 00:38:56,737
The only thing that's getting
slower are traffic and service.

610
00:38:56,805 --> 00:38:59,239
Who's your favorite
talk radio personality?

611
00:38:59,308 --> 00:39:02,709
Dr. Shirlee!

612
00:39:02,778 --> 00:39:05,076
This is not news, in case
anybody's interested.

613
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:08,116
- You listen to talk radio?
- Only Dr. Shirlee.

614
00:39:08,183 --> 00:39:11,482
The hottest new personality
in Chicago radio is forthright...

615
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:13,488
she's funny.

616
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:17,515
Able to solve problems in 30 seconds
and still leave time for commercials.

617
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:21,256
Hey, pal, you wanna bag that?
I like Dr. Shirlee.

618
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:25,130
Okay, fine. Who the hell
is Dr. Shirlee anyway?

619
00:39:26,702 --> 00:39:28,363
What's cooking with her?

620
00:39:28,437 --> 00:39:32,897
Although at this time Dr. Shirlee has
refused all requests for an interview...

621
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:37,878
we do have here in our studio W-N-D-Y
program director Alan Riegert.

622
00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:40,541
Alan, who is Dr. Shirlee?

623
00:39:40,616 --> 00:39:42,584
Who is Dr. Shirlee?

624
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:46,246
Dr. Shirlee is, and I don't think
it's an exaggeration...

625
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:51,658
the best thing that's happened to
Chicago since deep-dish pizza.

626
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:54,821
I think of her as my gift.

627
00:39:54,897 --> 00:39:58,890
I think of her as
my gift to Chicago...

628
00:39:58,968 --> 00:40:02,131
which is the city I love.

629
00:40:02,204 --> 00:40:05,469
Milo, there's a story here.
I know her personally.

630
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:09,739
- She doesn't know I'm a reporter.
- Doesn't sound like much.

631
00:40:09,812 --> 00:40:12,440
One day she's risking
her neck for 20 bucks...

632
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:15,574
and the next, she's Chicago's
answer to Dr. Joyce Brothers.

633
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:18,586
- It smells.
- You're wasting your time.

634
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:22,055
Don't count on it.

635
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:51,846
Why are they holding
a cocktail party at the aquarium?

636
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,152
Rich people like to dress up
and be seen in strange places.

637
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:59,786
I feel like a kid dressed up
in my mama's clothes.

638
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,594
I really don't feel like
I belong here at all.

639
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,858
Ten minutes.

640
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:08,869
Shake a hand, have a drink,
save a whale.

641
00:41:08,937 --> 00:41:11,201
I'll be with you every second.

642
00:41:18,113 --> 00:41:21,879
Look at you.
Look at you!

643
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,544
I can't get over the transformation.

644
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,716
You look like a million bucks.

645
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:31,555
You make me very proud
of myself tonight.

646
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:33,754
You're my discovery.

647
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:36,730
Alan, I am not the atom.

648
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:40,567
- How much?
- It's gratis.

649
00:41:40,636 --> 00:41:43,696
I didn't ask what it was.
I asked how much.

650
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:45,706
It's complimentary.

651
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:48,902
And it's on the house,
without charge, free.

652
00:41:48,977 --> 00:41:52,071
No kidding?
Well, thank you.

653
00:41:54,116 --> 00:41:56,516
If you don't know
what something means...

654
00:41:56,585 --> 00:41:59,315
pretend you do and follow my lead.

655
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:02,482
You're supposed to be
a college graduate.

656
00:42:08,897 --> 00:42:10,831
Excuse me.

657
00:42:12,901 --> 00:42:16,393
- Jack Russell, press.
- Invitation?

658
00:42:16,472 --> 00:42:18,571
Our society columnist
is covering the shindig.

659
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:20,670
Mr. Sindell is already here.

660
00:42:20,743 --> 00:42:23,473
His wife went into labor.
I'm relieving him.

661
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:25,137
His wife is with him.

662
00:42:25,214 --> 00:42:27,808
His wife is hyperventilating
in the back of a station wagon.

663
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:30,613
An attractive temp from
the typing pool is with him.

664
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:35,453
- If you'd like to break the news...
- No, please go in.

665
00:42:35,524 --> 00:42:36,923
Thank you.

666
00:42:43,965 --> 00:42:47,731
- Thinkin' of jumpin' in?
- Not unless you push me.

667
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:51,738
So this is where you hang out when
you're not dangling from bridges.

668
00:42:51,806 --> 00:42:53,967
Doesn't seem like your kind of party.

669
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:57,205
I don't want to know what
you think my kind of party is.

670
00:42:57,278 --> 00:42:59,212
Not the stuffed-shirt brigade.

671
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,407
I don't know about you,
but I'm bored.

672
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:04,781
If you hate being here, why don't
you go somewhere you'd rather be?

673
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:08,447
I'd rather be with Janice, but thanks
to you, Janice isn't around anymore.

674
00:43:08,523 --> 00:43:12,550
I want you to know I feel
bad about what happened.

675
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:15,755
No, don't.
You had me pegged right.

676
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,264
My record relationship is 17 weeks.

677
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,700
When you consider it takes longer than
that to grow a good-looking lawn...

678
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,737
it isn't much of a record.

679
00:43:23,805 --> 00:43:25,921
But you keep doing the
same thing over and over.

680
00:43:25,922 --> 00:43:28,037
I guess so.

681
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:30,543
If a guy keeps wrecking
his car every six months...

682
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:34,741
you'd begin to wonder about
his driving, wouldn't you?

683
00:43:34,816 --> 00:43:38,946
You're one of those guys that always
has to hold a part of himself back...

684
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,547
always keeping that one cookie
in the cookie jar.

685
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:44,818
Would you like a little free advice?

686
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:47,326
It's like you're allergic
to cornflakes...

687
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:51,331
so you start to buy stuff,
like a can of peas.

688
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:54,334
You open the can and
inside... cornflakes.

689
00:43:54,402 --> 00:43:57,428
So you pick a TV dinner and...

690
00:43:57,505 --> 00:43:59,166
cornflakes.

691
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,764
What does that mean?

692
00:44:00,842 --> 00:44:04,505
The girls you go out with,
outside they're all different packages.

693
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:06,012
Inside...

694
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,243
Cornflakes.

695
00:44:09,317 --> 00:44:11,251
So...

696
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:14,550
- so what do I do?
- Over here.

697
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:19,184
I have to get out of here.
It was nice to see you again.

698
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,228
Hey, wait a minute!

699
00:44:23,698 --> 00:44:25,632
Hey, wait a minute.

700
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,932
You tell me my life is cornflakes and
cookies, and then you walk away?

701
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:32,529
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Shirlee.

702
00:44:32,607 --> 00:44:35,633
You're a doctor, huh?
What kind of doctor?

703
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,178
I'm a doctor of the heart.

704
00:44:38,246 --> 00:44:40,806
Dr. Shirlee.
You're the radio shrink.

705
00:44:40,882 --> 00:44:45,251
I had no idea Janice was
getting advice from a pro.

706
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:48,584
Dr. Shirlee, wow.
So, uh, oh...

707
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:50,590
Um, uh... thanks.

708
00:44:50,658 --> 00:44:53,684
So what do I do?

709
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:57,094
Maybe you should try datin'
a different kind of woman...

710
00:44:57,165 --> 00:45:01,067
someone whose insides look
better than their outsides.

711
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:03,968
Someone whose name begins with
"S" and ends with "E"?

712
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:07,906
- If you know someone named Sylvie.
- No.

713
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:10,944
- I know a guy named Shane.
- Ask him out.

714
00:45:11,012 --> 00:45:13,503
I'd rather ask you out.
Friday night.

715
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:15,913
- It's a date.
- It is?

716
00:45:31,866 --> 00:45:34,300
Excuse me. Moritz, hi.

717
00:45:34,368 --> 00:45:36,393
Nice to see you, Jack.

718
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:41,602
I'll do the best I can, but it's
gonna be a half-hour wait.

719
00:45:41,676 --> 00:45:45,476
- Do you think maybe...
- Dr. Shirlee. Well, well, well.

720
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:47,980
We're honored to have you here.

721
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:51,212
We have a beautiful table
for you, right this way.

722
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:57,047
Medium rare and very well done.

723
00:45:57,124 --> 00:45:59,058
Thank you.

724
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:02,357
- So you're not from Chicago?
- No, I'm not from Chicago.

725
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,898
Compliments of the house.

726
00:46:04,966 --> 00:46:08,561
- Is it gratis tonight?
- It is for you, Dr. Shirlee.

727
00:46:08,636 --> 00:46:11,104
Just for me?
How come?

728
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:13,732
Well, because...

729
00:46:13,808 --> 00:46:15,969
because you're Dr. Shirlee.

730
00:46:16,043 --> 00:46:19,444
That's real nice,
but it doesn't seem fair...

731
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:22,449
for these other people who are
not Dr. Shirlee to be penalized.

732
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:26,749
I'll pay for a bottle of this
champagne for every table.

733
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:30,154
This is very expensive champagne.

734
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:32,590
Money's meant to be spent, right?

735
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,154
What good's it gonna do in
the bottom of my panty drawer?

736
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:41,434
It's $200 a bottle.

737
00:46:41,502 --> 00:46:44,938
Bad idea. Just forget it.

738
00:46:45,006 --> 00:46:47,839
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

739
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:49,934
That's more than
I used to make in a week.

740
00:46:50,011 --> 00:46:53,503
- I thought shrinks were rich.
- Are they?

741
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:57,312
Not all of them,
at least not at first.

742
00:46:57,385 --> 00:46:59,876
Why would you keep
your money in a drawer?

743
00:46:59,954 --> 00:47:02,479
Aren't you afraid
somebody's gonna steal it?

744
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:07,017
I figure it's safer in my room
than in a bank these days.

745
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:09,619
If somebody's gonna steal it...

746
00:47:09,697 --> 00:47:12,097
I'd rather it goes to
somebody that needs it...

747
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,964
than some vice-president
of a savings and loan.

748
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:18,872
What?

749
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,966
I just... love the way
you look at things.

750
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:24,375
You're really interested
in me, aren't you?

751
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,572
- Yes, I am.
- That's great.

752
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:29,878
Most men just want
to talk about themselves.

753
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:33,819
I want to know everything.
How did you lose your virginity?

754
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:41,688
You don't want to start with "Where
you from, how long you been in town"?

755
00:47:41,762 --> 00:47:46,222
If you want. Where you from?
How long you been in town?

756
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:52,270
- Under the bleachers.
- You're from under the bleachers?

757
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,434
No, that's where I lost my virginity.

758
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:59,377
Our high school had just
lost the state championship...

759
00:47:59,447 --> 00:48:03,474
and my boyfriend,
he was the tight end...

760
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:06,952
and it was the only way
I could make him feel better.

761
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,289
Who did you lose it to?

762
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,055
- My virginity?
- The state championship.

763
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:17,757
- To the Lamont Lions.
- Mmm.

764
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:21,791
How about you?
How'd you lose yours?

765
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,929
How's my star?

766
00:48:25,006 --> 00:48:27,167
I thought I saw you
sitting over here.

767
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:29,505
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

768
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:33,138
Alan, this is my friend Jack.
Jack, this is Alan, my boss.

769
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:35,876
I don't think of myself
as just your boss.

770
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,919
I prefer to think of myself
as a friend and mentor.

771
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:41,079
I discovered Shirlee.

772
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:43,089
You make her sound like penicillin.

773
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:45,785
Funny guy.

774
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,454
Zim Zimmerman's sitting over there.

775
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:50,690
I'm gonna get you on his show.

776
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:53,461
Come over and win
a few points for us.

777
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:55,968
I thought I wasn't supposed
to give interviews.

778
00:48:56,037 --> 00:48:58,277
Yeah, I thought she wasn't
supposed to give interviews.

779
00:48:58,278 --> 00:48:59,234
How do you know?

780
00:48:59,306 --> 00:49:03,072
I just heard her say so.

781
00:49:03,144 --> 00:49:05,374
Excuse us.

782
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:09,644
Listen, I told Zim
you'd be a great guest.

783
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:12,777
I sort of went out on
a limb for you on this.

784
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:16,482
Don't saw it out from
underneath me please.

785
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:31,896
Well, this is where I live.

786
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:36,306
You are full of surprises.

787
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:40,073
- I had a great time.
- So did I.

788
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,672
In fact, I'm having way too much fun.

789
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:45,217
What's wrong with that?
It's good, isn't it?

790
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:47,753
Not for me, Jack.

791
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:50,688
I have a bad track record with men.

792
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:54,284
I find men that want to
change me, hurt me, use me...

793
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:56,795
never just love me.

794
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:03,696
But what the heck. Records
are made to be broken, right?

795
00:50:21,555 --> 00:50:23,147
We're ready, Dr. Kenyon.

796
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:26,386
Oh, God.
Okay, here we go.

797
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,428
Now remember...

798
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:31,191
undergraduate work,
University of Georgia.

799
00:50:31,264 --> 00:50:33,391
Graduate studies,
you went to Stanford.

800
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:36,664
- You were tops in your class.
- I am not sayin' all that.

801
00:50:36,736 --> 00:50:38,727
I'm not gonna lie.

802
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:41,638
You want to say you're
qualified to hand out advice...

803
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:45,144
based on being a three-time
loser dance instructor...

804
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:48,545
who's never even been near a college?

805
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:51,049
Okay, you're nervous.
I see that now.

806
00:50:51,117 --> 00:50:53,517
I went over all
the questions with him.

807
00:50:53,587 --> 00:50:55,635
The only way to get
in trouble is if you

808
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,683
deviate from the responses
I've given you...

809
00:50:57,757 --> 00:50:59,737
or he puts down his
clipboard, which means

810
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:01,716
he'll ask you something
we didn't discuss.

811
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:04,195
But he assured me
he's not gonna do that.

812
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:06,755
Which leads me to
the following, Dr. Shirlee.

813
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,926
You're aware of the furor...

814
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:11,197
You bastard!
You lyin' bastard!

815
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:15,264
- He said he wasn't gonna do that!
- We're working here!

816
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:18,038
What do you mean?

817
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:20,978
Specifically, how it
denigrates a profession...

818
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:23,777
exploits it for its commercial ends.

819
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:26,045
Is that what you think?

820
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,984
Have you listened to my program?

821
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:32,150
Of course I have, but we're not
discussing my opinions here.

822
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:34,989
Why not?
It's your show.

823
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:37,495
Let's be straight.

824
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:39,930
The people you deal with
are total strangers.

825
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,026
You have little or no
knowledge of their history...

826
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:46,266
and yet you try and solve their
problems in less than five minutes.

827
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:50,799
Don't you worry that to give advice
with so little information...

828
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:53,107
can have serious repercussions?

829
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:55,409
People just give me a holler.

830
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:58,417
I tell 'em what I think
and hope it helps.

831
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:01,818
I don't know all the answers.
Do you, Zim?

832
00:52:01,888 --> 00:52:03,515
Don't you think you can hurt?

833
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:06,184
Don't you worry that
you may give advice...

834
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:08,250
without enough knowledge
of the person...

835
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:11,695
I just tell the truth as I see it.

836
00:52:11,765 --> 00:52:14,893
To my knowledge, the truth
has never caused any damage.

837
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:17,163
Pain sometimes, but not damage.

838
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:19,535
Very nice.

839
00:52:19,606 --> 00:52:21,540
Very nice.

840
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:24,805
- Shut him up or get him out of here.
- Sorry.

841
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:31,644
Let's welcome my special guest...

842
00:52:31,718 --> 00:52:35,552
renowned radio psychiatrist
Dr. David Erdman.

843
00:52:37,857 --> 00:52:40,758
Welcome, Dr. Erdman.

844
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:43,227
Oh shit! Oh shit!

845
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:45,355
I'm glad to have a second opinion.

846
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:49,493
Let's start with...

847
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:53,335
what are you looking for
in a caller, Dr. Erdman?

848
00:52:53,406 --> 00:52:57,433
I like a caller that fits my listeners'
demographic profile.

849
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,172
I like healthy callers
with healthy problems.

850
00:53:00,246 --> 00:53:03,044
If their questions happen to
tie in with a tape I'm promoting...

851
00:53:03,116 --> 00:53:04,981
so much the better.

852
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,713
No, seriously.

853
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,585
I'm here to help anyone
in my listening audience...

854
00:53:10,657 --> 00:53:14,184
who wants to come to a deeper
understanding of themselves.

855
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,888
- Dr. Shirlee.
- What am I looking for in a caller?

856
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:19,364
I'm looking for someone
that needs help.

857
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:21,764
And?

858
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:24,963
And they have to eat
Froot Loops for breakfast.

859
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:28,633
And what? Someone with
a problem. Isn't that enough?

860
00:53:31,177 --> 00:53:35,079
Let's proceed with what I feel is the
most interesting part of the program.

861
00:53:35,148 --> 00:53:36,172
Uh-oh.

862
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:38,240
We have a caller who has a problem.

863
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:41,617
We're gonna ask each of our doctors
to respond to that problem...

864
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:43,952
in order to let you see...

865
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:46,288
the different approaches
to radio psychology.

866
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:48,520
Oh!

867
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:50,563
Hi, you're on the air.

868
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,064
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear, Joan.

869
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:57,069
This is Joan. She's 48.
She has a marital problem.

870
00:53:57,137 --> 00:53:59,298
Please doctors,
in the interest of brevity...

871
00:53:59,372 --> 00:54:01,567
keep your responses
to Joan's problem...

872
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:04,667
down to a minute.
Go ahead, Joan.

873
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:07,975
My husband's been
having an affair for a year...

874
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:11,142
and I found out about it
about six months ago.

875
00:54:11,217 --> 00:54:13,879
I asked him to stop, but he won't.

876
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:16,080
I wrote a letter to
the woman he's seeing...

877
00:54:16,156 --> 00:54:19,148
and asked her not to see him,
but she showed it to him.

878
00:54:19,225 --> 00:54:22,456
Hey, will you get outta there?
What is he doing?

879
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:27,489
I'm so filled with anger toward him,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

880
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:29,660
- Dr. Erdman.
- Hold that shot.

881
00:54:29,736 --> 00:54:34,196
- Joan, do you want a divorce?
- No.

882
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:37,710
Then I suggest that
you let sleeping dogs lie.

883
00:54:37,777 --> 00:54:40,211
- What!
- You'll have your turn.

884
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,545
Joan, you do not hate your husband
for doing this. You hate yourself.

885
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:45,846
Give me one.

886
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:48,217
If you felt better about yourself...

887
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:51,257
maybe your husband
would want to be with you.

888
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:53,656
It's her fault
her husband's cheatin'?

889
00:54:53,727 --> 00:54:56,059
I'm simply suggesting
that she look to herself.

890
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,256
Maybe she's too demanding in bed.

891
00:54:58,331 --> 00:55:00,925
You talk to your callers like that?

892
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,199
You should be disbarred or derailed
or whatever they do to doctors.

893
00:55:06,272 --> 00:55:07,864
Derailed?

894
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:10,876
Where did you receive
your training, Doctor?

895
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:14,471
- Where did I receive my training?
- Yes.

896
00:55:14,547 --> 00:55:16,714
I'm a graduate of
Harvard, postgraduate

897
00:55:16,715 --> 00:55:18,881
studies at the Sorbonne.
Where did you train?

898
00:55:18,952 --> 00:55:21,682
Where did I train?
I trained at Screw U.

899
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:28,150
You know who came up with the
expression "Let sleeping dogs lie"?

900
00:55:28,228 --> 00:55:29,661
A dog.

901
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:34,523
And, Joan, honey, you are
not going to change him.

902
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:36,865
You gotta live with it or end it.

903
00:55:36,936 --> 00:55:41,305
Tinkle or get off the potty. Either way,
you'll start to like yourself again.

904
00:55:42,942 --> 00:55:46,400
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
Oh, Shirlee!

905
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:52,708
We love you.!

906
00:55:52,786 --> 00:55:56,415
She was so good!
Oh, God!

907
00:55:56,489 --> 00:56:00,687
- You guys are great.!
- We'll be right back.

908
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,160
This show is fantastic.!

909
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:09,130
This is great.

910
00:56:09,201 --> 00:56:12,227
She blew both of those guys away.
When can I get the story?

911
00:56:12,304 --> 00:56:15,239
- So now you think it's a story.
- It's a story.

912
00:56:15,307 --> 00:56:18,401
- How much have you got on her?
- Almost enough.

913
00:56:18,477 --> 00:56:20,809
Get on it.

914
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,973
Nail her and fast, huh?

915
00:56:28,587 --> 00:56:31,147
Shirlee, what's the matter?
Where you going?

916
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:34,681
Let's go back inside.
We didn't say good night to Zim.

917
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,921
Alan, I'm tired.
I want to go.

918
00:56:36,996 --> 00:56:38,930
- You're the pink Mercedes.
- No, I'm not.

919
00:56:38,998 --> 00:56:41,398
No, I'm Shirlee Kenyon.
I drive a pink Mercedes.

920
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:48,262
- I'm depressed.
- Oh, come on!

921
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,865
What are you talking about?
You should be on cloud nine.

922
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,877
You just buried
those two clowns in there.

923
00:56:52,945 --> 00:56:55,812
That's great, but all
this "doctor" stuff...

924
00:56:55,881 --> 00:56:59,977
and what Zim said about
what if somethin' happened?

925
00:57:00,052 --> 00:57:03,146
Let's face it.
I'm not trained.

926
00:57:03,222 --> 00:57:06,316
Maybe Dr. Erdman is a jerk...

927
00:57:06,392 --> 00:57:09,520
- but at least he's been to school.
- Dr. Erdman!

928
00:57:09,595 --> 00:57:12,928
Dr. Erdman knows about
as much as you do.

929
00:57:12,998 --> 00:57:17,230
I oughta know. He was my shrink
for five years and look how sick I am!

930
00:57:17,303 --> 00:57:19,999
Oh, come on, Shirlee, lighten up!

931
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:22,199
I'm not a doctor.

932
00:57:22,274 --> 00:57:25,038
And I'm certainly not my Mercedes...

933
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:27,545
so who am I?

934
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:37,721
I'm a Cadillac.

935
00:57:39,825 --> 00:57:43,761
Dr. Shirlee, we have Sean on the line.
He's a sober alcoholic.

936
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:46,627
Shirlee, thanks for taking my call.

937
00:57:46,699 --> 00:57:49,793
I've been sober for two years
and my wife is an alcoholic.

938
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:52,064
I don't know what to do.

939
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:55,301
If I stay around her I could drink
again and she doesn't want to quit.

940
00:57:55,374 --> 00:57:58,104
You got kids, Sean, or
is it just the two of you?

941
00:57:58,177 --> 00:58:00,509
It's just us.

942
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:04,811
In that case, tell her you can't
be with her if she's drinkin'.

943
00:58:04,884 --> 00:58:07,216
If she loves you enough,
she'll try to quit.

944
00:58:07,286 --> 00:58:11,017
If she doesn't, you have to love
yourself enough to walk away.

945
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,115
Like my daddy always said...

946
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:15,319
a bird and a fish can fall in love...

947
00:58:15,394 --> 00:58:17,794
but where do they make a home?

948
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:19,888
I saw that!

949
00:58:19,965 --> 00:58:23,025
My helper is makin' faces
at my choice of words.

950
00:58:23,102 --> 00:58:25,969
But what I'm sayin' is true.
Sometimes the only way...

951
00:58:26,038 --> 00:58:30,065
you can get somebody to change
their bad habits is to leave 'em.

952
00:58:30,142 --> 00:58:33,600
And if they don't, at least
one of you's gotten out alive.

953
00:58:38,484 --> 00:58:40,577
What's cookin', Gene?

954
00:58:40,653 --> 00:58:43,247
You made quite an impression
last night, Shirlee...

955
00:58:43,322 --> 00:58:45,586
and not just on Zim Zimmerman.

956
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:48,718
Mr. Perlman, sometimes
my mouth just runs off...

957
00:58:48,794 --> 00:58:50,989
without checkin' with my brain first.

958
00:58:51,063 --> 00:58:55,625
- I didn't mean to offend him.
- No!

959
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:58,431
No, Shirlee.
A good impression.

960
00:58:58,504 --> 00:59:00,404
The network called this morning.

961
00:59:00,472 --> 00:59:02,463
They want to take you national.

962
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:05,908
Promotional tours,
ad campaigns, the works!

963
00:59:05,978 --> 00:59:09,414
Listeners calling Dr. Shirlee
from coast-to-coast.

964
00:59:09,481 --> 00:59:11,881
- How many people's that?
- Millions!

965
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:15,045
- Millions?
- You've got work, Alan.

966
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,850
I want a photo layout.
"People" magazine.

967
00:59:17,923 --> 00:59:20,585
"Chicago's favorite
doctor at home."

968
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:23,719
At home?
I don't think...

969
00:59:23,796 --> 00:59:26,390
Don't think, Alan.
Do it! Do it!

970
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:29,059
Spotlight's on it's shining bright

971
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:31,864
And I like standing in it

972
00:59:31,937 --> 00:59:35,168
It's only superficial light

973
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,607
We'll take it just the way it is.

974
00:59:37,676 --> 00:59:40,941
- Alan, I don't need a place this fancy.
- Really?

975
00:59:41,013 --> 00:59:43,641
Maybe we should get Avedon
to do a photo shoot of you...

976
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:47,015
at the Hotel Roosevelt, at home.

977
00:59:47,086 --> 00:59:50,954
I want to claim as mine

978
00:59:51,023 --> 00:59:57,622
Fancy clothes, a magic coach
and happy ever after

979
00:59:57,696 --> 00:59:59,891
- Like something from a storybook
- Get over there.

980
00:59:59,965 --> 01:00:02,798
- A Cinderella chapter
- She's coming over.

981
01:00:02,868 --> 01:00:05,530
But when the clock strikes midnight

982
01:00:05,604 --> 01:00:08,767
And I lie awake in bed

983
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:11,708
These lines the teacher told me

984
01:00:11,777 --> 01:00:15,406
Keep running through my head

985
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:18,848
You gotta walk
the straight and narrow

986
01:00:18,918 --> 01:00:22,081
And to thine own self be true

987
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:24,679
You gotta aim straight as an arrow

988
01:00:24,757 --> 01:00:28,659
A ll eyes are upon you

989
01:00:28,727 --> 01:00:34,495
But sometimes it feels so good
that I can almost justify

990
01:00:34,566 --> 01:00:37,433
Living a l-l-lie

991
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,336
Living a lie

992
01:00:40,406 --> 01:00:44,308
Living a l-l-lie

993
01:00:46,378 --> 01:00:49,006
Living a lie

994
01:00:58,857 --> 01:01:02,623
Shirlee Kenyon? Hey, Steve,
do we know a Shirlee Kenyon?

995
01:01:02,695 --> 01:01:06,187
Yeah. Who wants to know?

996
01:01:06,265 --> 01:01:08,460
This guy down here.

997
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:10,502
How well do you know her?

998
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:14,130
I know her well.
I know her very, very well.

999
01:01:14,206 --> 01:01:17,607
Huh. How did you meet her?

1000
01:01:19,211 --> 01:01:21,577
How did I meet who?

1001
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:25,684
Shirlee Kenyon.

1002
01:01:28,253 --> 01:01:31,313
Well, my best friend
married her three times.

1003
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:36,054
When he got done marrying her,
she moved in with me...

1004
01:01:36,128 --> 01:01:40,155
and I didn't even
have to marry her once.

1005
01:01:40,232 --> 01:01:43,497
- She married the same guy three times.
- Yeah.

1006
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:45,816
Why are you asking
all these questions?

1007
01:01:45,817 --> 01:01:48,063
Credit check.

1008
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,303
What'd you say your name was?

1009
01:01:52,411 --> 01:01:54,641
- Mack.
- Listen, Mack.

1010
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:01,911
Do you give credit...

1011
01:02:01,987 --> 01:02:05,388
to people who steal
other people's bowling bags?

1012
01:02:11,296 --> 01:02:14,493
And I sacrificed my honor

1013
01:02:14,566 --> 01:02:17,034
My values and my pride

1014
01:02:17,102 --> 01:02:21,402
Living a l-l-lie

1015
01:02:24,643 --> 01:02:28,010
You don't by any chance
dance, do you?

1016
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,641
Living a lie Living a lie

1017
01:02:31,717 --> 01:02:35,483
Living a lie

1018
01:02:35,554 --> 01:02:38,785
Ow! Watch
what you're doin', Jack.

1019
01:02:38,857 --> 01:02:42,418
Just look at me and stop
thinkin' about your feet.

1020
01:02:42,494 --> 01:02:44,928
- Where'd you learn all this?
- I used to teach.

1021
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:47,261
- Oh, when?
- A long time ago.

1022
01:02:47,332 --> 01:02:49,527
- Where was that?
- What?

1023
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:52,399
- Where?
- It was before I became a doctor.

1024
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:55,963
- Loosen up, Jack. Just relax.
- Ohh!

1025
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:59,067
- Did I ever tell you about my novel?
- No! Did you write a novel?

1026
01:02:59,144 --> 01:03:01,078
I had an idea for a novel.

1027
01:03:01,146 --> 01:03:03,842
I started talking about this book
I was gonna write.

1028
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:08,478
The guys at the office would say,
"Jack, you started that book yet?"

1029
01:03:08,554 --> 01:03:12,957
One day I got so sick of
saying "no, " I said "yes."

1030
01:03:13,025 --> 01:03:17,052
Then it was, "Jack, how's the book
coming?" "It's coming along."

1031
01:03:17,129 --> 01:03:21,156
Then, "Have you finished
that book yet?"

1032
01:03:21,233 --> 01:03:24,930
One day I just said,
"Yes, it's finished."

1033
01:03:25,003 --> 01:03:28,234
Funny thing was,
I hadn't started it yet.

1034
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:30,474
I didn't mean to lie.
It just happened.

1035
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:32,641
What are you tryin' to do?

1036
01:03:32,711 --> 01:03:35,544
What are you tryin' to do?

1037
01:03:35,614 --> 01:03:39,345
The fox-trot, rock step? What?

1038
01:03:39,418 --> 01:03:43,286
- I'm just trying to dance.
- Well, just watch me!

1039
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:48,285
Rock step, step.
Rock step, step.

1040
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,590
Move those hips.
Move those hips!

1041
01:03:50,662 --> 01:03:54,860
Looking good.
Mmm! Ha!

1042
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:02,307
I guess nothing like that
ever happened to you, huh?

1043
01:04:02,374 --> 01:04:07,277
- Like happened to me with the book?
- Jack, shut up and dance.

1044
01:04:38,177 --> 01:04:41,271
Outside.! Ball three.

1045
01:04:41,346 --> 01:04:42,904
Nice shot.

1046
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:46,610
The coach is walking to the mound,
not looking good for the doctor.

1047
01:04:46,685 --> 01:04:49,347
It may be a long trip
back to the bullpen.

1048
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:51,469
Put your index finger here.
Thumb on the outside.

1049
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,517
Okay.

1050
01:04:53,592 --> 01:04:56,755
She's winding up.
The form is looking good.

1051
01:04:59,331 --> 01:05:02,858
A little high and outside again.
Try again.

1052
01:05:05,737 --> 01:05:09,571
If you ever do write that novel,
what's it gonna be about?

1053
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:12,235
- That was truly pitiful.
- Why, thank you.

1054
01:05:12,311 --> 01:05:16,645
I don't know. Despair? Greed?
Corruption? All my favorite things.

1055
01:05:16,715 --> 01:05:20,879
Why don't you write about somethin' you
love instead of something you hate?

1056
01:05:20,953 --> 01:05:22,887
- Like what?
- Like baseball.

1057
01:05:22,955 --> 01:05:25,685
Write a book about baseball.

1058
01:05:25,757 --> 01:05:28,817
Just what the world needs,
another baseball novel.

1059
01:05:28,894 --> 01:05:32,591
Sure they do...
if it's great.

1060
01:05:32,664 --> 01:05:35,497
And I bet if you wrote it,
it would be.

1061
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:38,661
I love when you talk sweet to me.

1062
01:05:38,737 --> 01:05:42,298
- You haven't even heard sweet yet.
- How long do I have to wait?

1063
01:05:42,374 --> 01:05:46,640
- Oh, we're gettin' closer.
- Hey, guys?

1064
01:05:46,712 --> 01:05:48,805
Oops. Game called
on account of cops.

1065
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,976
It's late... and
this ain't no ballpark.

1066
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:55,178
Can I see some I.D. please?

1067
01:05:55,254 --> 01:05:57,950
- We'll take a rain check, Jack.
- I'll pray for rain.

1068
01:05:58,023 --> 01:06:00,685
- I.D.!
- Thank you, Officer...

1069
01:06:00,759 --> 01:06:04,422
for keeping Chicago safe
from flying lemons.

1070
01:06:04,496 --> 01:06:05,363
Whoop.

1071
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:06,164
Whoop.

1072
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:09,190
"Shirlee Kenyon."

1073
01:06:09,267 --> 01:06:11,235
Dr. Shirlee Kenyon?

1074
01:06:11,303 --> 01:06:14,329
It'll work out, Phil.
You call me.

1075
01:06:14,406 --> 01:06:16,567
I will. Thanks!

1076
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:19,940
Okay. Good night.

1077
01:06:20,012 --> 01:06:22,446
Sorry. Phil's daughter, Carol...

1078
01:06:22,514 --> 01:06:26,541
- ran away twice in the last month.
- Good for her.

1079
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:36,594
You wanna come up
and check out my carpet samples?

1080
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:40,529
Is that a line?

1081
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:43,693
Dusty rose, Christmas green,
or elephant gray?

1082
01:06:45,604 --> 01:06:47,162
Nah!

1083
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:49,867
- We'll forget about the elephant gray.
- Great apartment.

1084
01:06:49,941 --> 01:06:51,841
Oh, thanks.

1085
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:54,708
I was worried about takin' it,
paying all this rent and all.

1086
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:58,147
But Alan says my job's pretty secure.

1087
01:06:58,216 --> 01:07:01,276
It really is great.
The money, the car, this apartment.

1088
01:07:01,353 --> 01:07:04,049
But if my audience
gets tired of me...

1089
01:07:04,122 --> 01:07:06,454
I don't think losin' it
would just kill me.

1090
01:07:08,527 --> 01:07:10,586
So...

1091
01:07:10,662 --> 01:07:14,098
what do we decide? The Dusty
rose or the Christmas green?

1092
01:07:27,779 --> 01:07:30,247
Carpet samples turn you on.

1093
01:07:30,315 --> 01:07:33,807
I tried everything else.

1094
01:07:40,225 --> 01:07:42,145
You probably think you
just heard the doorbell.

1095
01:07:42,146 --> 01:07:43,786
Trust me, you're hallucinating.

1096
01:07:43,862 --> 01:07:47,889
See, most women, right after they kiss
me, tell me they hear a doorbell...

1097
01:07:47,966 --> 01:07:50,400
followed by
the faint scent of orchids.

1098
01:07:50,469 --> 01:07:54,405
- Do you smell the orchids yet?
- No.

1099
01:07:54,473 --> 01:07:57,965
Just the pungent aroma of bullshit.
...

1100
01:07:58,043 --> 01:08:01,535
Wait, wait! No one with any class
shows up unannounced.

1101
01:08:01,613 --> 01:08:04,081
- Ignore it.
- What if it's "The Millionaire"?

1102
01:08:04,149 --> 01:08:06,743
Did you ever see that show
where Michael Anthony...

1103
01:08:06,818 --> 01:08:09,685
shows up with a million dollars
from John Beresford Tipton?

1104
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:13,315
But there's a catch.
You have to answer the door.

1105
01:08:13,391 --> 01:08:16,292
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Oh, Jack.

1106
01:08:16,361 --> 01:08:18,443
You're a great kisser...
but a million dollars?

1107
01:08:18,444 --> 01:08:20,525
You got a point.

1108
01:08:20,599 --> 01:08:23,500
Stay puckered.

1109
01:08:23,568 --> 01:08:26,867
Coming, Mr. Anthony.

1110
01:08:29,074 --> 01:08:30,871
Hello, baby.

1111
01:08:30,942 --> 01:08:34,241
Surprised to see me?

1112
01:08:36,148 --> 01:08:40,676
Wow, you're doin' very well.

1113
01:08:40,752 --> 01:08:42,686
Very, very well.

1114
01:08:42,754 --> 01:08:44,722
Steve, what are you doin' here?

1115
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:49,817
I heard you made out, so I thought
I'd come by and see for myself.

1116
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:53,262
Went by that radio station
and told 'em I was...

1117
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:57,597
your long-lost brother home from
the Navy just dying to surpr...

1118
01:08:57,669 --> 01:09:00,695
Who the hell is this?

1119
01:09:00,772 --> 01:09:03,536
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, you don't.

1120
01:09:03,608 --> 01:09:06,406
- Jack, this is Steve. Steve, Jack.
- How you doin'?

1121
01:09:06,478 --> 01:09:10,608
- Don't I know you?
- No! No, I don't think so.

1122
01:09:10,682 --> 01:09:13,014
You never been to Arkansas?

1123
01:09:13,084 --> 01:09:17,020
- We better do this another time.
- Do what another time?

1124
01:09:17,088 --> 01:09:19,386
It's none of your business.

1125
01:09:22,294 --> 01:09:24,228
I don't like your attitude.

1126
01:09:24,296 --> 01:09:27,959
That's a big word for you, attitude.

1127
01:09:28,033 --> 01:09:31,332
Why don't you just
give your mouth a rest?

1128
01:09:31,403 --> 01:09:34,099
Damn you, Steve.!

1129
01:09:34,172 --> 01:09:37,266
Want me to throw him out?
'Cause I'll do it. Ow.

1130
01:09:37,342 --> 01:09:40,106
- I don't like you.
- Oh, really? Too bad.

1131
01:09:40,178 --> 01:09:42,578
I was gonna ask if you want
to spend Thanksgiving together.

1132
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:44,046
Steve, get out!

1133
01:09:44,115 --> 01:09:46,811
I don't know why you're here...

1134
01:09:46,885 --> 01:09:50,912
or what you think,
but you can forget it, it's over!

1135
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:54,720
Well, maybe yes and maybe no.
But it'll keep.

1136
01:09:54,793 --> 01:09:56,818
I know you.

1137
01:09:56,895 --> 01:10:00,888
I can't put my finger on it,
but believe me, it'll come to me.

1138
01:10:00,966 --> 01:10:02,490
Tell Shirlee...

1139
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:05,730
I like the Dusty rose.

1140
01:10:08,873 --> 01:10:11,273
Wait a minute.!

1141
01:10:11,343 --> 01:10:14,176
I do owe you something!

1142
01:10:23,221 --> 01:10:25,849
- Ow.
- Head back, head back.

1143
01:10:25,924 --> 01:10:29,018
- I was gonna kick his ass.
- I know.

1144
01:10:29,094 --> 01:10:33,155
Except I'm really more
of a lover than a fighter.

1145
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:36,826
I can see that.

1146
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:45,173
Ow, ow! Now see?
Ow, ow.

1147
01:10:45,243 --> 01:10:48,440
- Maybe we better make it another time.
- Yeah, maybe.

1148
01:10:51,516 --> 01:10:55,350
On the other hand...

1149
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,878
We can... work around it.

1150
01:11:12,137 --> 01:11:15,300
- Want to come in?
- Before I do...

1151
01:11:15,373 --> 01:11:18,467
there's something I should tell you.

1152
01:11:18,543 --> 01:11:20,340
You're gay?

1153
01:11:20,412 --> 01:11:22,346
No.

1154
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:26,473
- Married?
- No.

1155
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:28,883
Will it spoil the mood?

1156
01:11:28,953 --> 01:11:31,012
It might.

1157
01:11:31,089 --> 01:11:33,387
Will it keep?

1158
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,819
Yes.

1159
01:12:12,864 --> 01:12:18,097
- Holy moley!
- Is that all you can say?

1160
01:12:18,169 --> 01:12:21,468
Holy moley.!
...

1161
01:12:29,681 --> 01:12:32,081
Holy moley!

1162
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:34,846
Yeah. Yeah.

1163
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:49,957
"If I died tomorrow,
I'd go with a smile.

1164
01:12:50,034 --> 01:12:53,094
Meet me at our
coffee shop at noon."

1165
01:12:54,973 --> 01:12:57,601
Couldn't wait 'til noon?

1166
01:13:00,845 --> 01:13:03,075
I just remembered
where I saw that guy.

1167
01:13:04,516 --> 01:13:06,507
I told him it'd come to me.

1168
01:13:06,584 --> 01:13:08,779
Milo?

1169
01:13:08,853 --> 01:13:11,378
Milo, you wanna see me?

1170
01:13:11,456 --> 01:13:15,415
We're putting the weekend edition
to bed. Where's my story?

1171
01:13:15,493 --> 01:13:18,462
- There is no story.
- What do you mean, there's no story?

1172
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:21,363
Okay, there is a story,
but I'm not writing it.

1173
01:13:21,432 --> 01:13:23,400
Are you going funny on me?

1174
01:13:23,468 --> 01:13:28,371
- Milo, I'm sorry. I just can't do it.
- You know what I think?

1175
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:32,705
I think maybe you like this Dr. Shirlee
a little too much to tell the truth.

1176
01:13:32,777 --> 01:13:35,746
Is that it?
Let me tell you something.

1177
01:13:35,814 --> 01:13:39,716
A real reporter is somebody who maybe
cries when he writes the story...

1178
01:13:39,784 --> 01:13:43,618
but he writes the story because
the public deserves to know.

1179
01:13:43,688 --> 01:13:45,679
What? What do
they deserve to know?

1180
01:13:45,757 --> 01:13:48,248
Every stupid fact
that comes a reporter's way?

1181
01:13:48,326 --> 01:13:51,056
Maybe sometimes the thing
to do is keep your mouth shut.

1182
01:13:51,129 --> 01:13:54,792
Some facts don't matter to anyone except
the person you're telling them about.

1183
01:13:54,866 --> 01:13:56,993
Don't pull this on me.

1184
01:13:57,068 --> 01:13:59,901
What do you think?
I'm going to admire your backbone?

1185
01:13:59,971 --> 01:14:02,496
You think I'm gonna respect
you for standing up to me?

1186
01:14:02,574 --> 01:14:05,099
Let me tell you something.
I hate backbone!

1187
01:14:05,176 --> 01:14:07,906
I despise people who stand up to me.

1188
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:10,948
- Please, don't make me fire you.
- You won't have to fire me.

1189
01:14:11,015 --> 01:14:14,746
- Thanks. I'm glad.
- You won't have to fire me...

1190
01:14:15,854 --> 01:14:18,482
because I quit.

1191
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:23,155
Three's about done,
another fifteen minutes.

1192
01:14:27,632 --> 01:14:31,159
- Hey, hey!
- What were you doin' in Flat River?

1193
01:14:31,236 --> 01:14:33,153
And why were you askin'
questions about me?

1194
01:14:33,154 --> 01:14:35,070
Flat River?

1195
01:14:35,139 --> 01:14:37,539
You talked to Steve.
He told me.

1196
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:40,169
Give me a chance to explain.
Let's talk about it.

1197
01:14:40,245 --> 01:14:43,806
- All I want is an answer.
- It's not that simple.

1198
01:14:43,881 --> 01:14:45,841
You're a reporter. You
were doin' a story on me.

1199
01:14:45,842 --> 01:14:47,612
No.

1200
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:51,143
Yes... I was but I'm not.

1201
01:14:51,222 --> 01:14:54,089
That's why you wanted to spend
time with me? Be with me?

1202
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:57,355
So you could get the dirt on me?
I thought you were different.

1203
01:14:57,428 --> 01:15:00,591
- I thought my luck had finally changed.
- Wait a minute, Shirl.

1204
01:15:00,665 --> 01:15:04,431
- You don't understand.
- You did a good job, Jack.

1205
01:15:04,502 --> 01:15:06,527
They say you shouldn't
take your work to bed.

1206
01:15:06,604 --> 01:15:11,007
- In this case, I guess they were wrong.
- Man!

1207
01:15:11,075 --> 01:15:12,508
Shirlee!

1208
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:16,138
I didn't write the story, okay?
I quit my job over it.

1209
01:15:16,214 --> 01:15:19,081
- Why should I believe anything you say?
- It's the truth.

1210
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:21,778
- Don't talk to me about the truth.
- Don't talk to you?

1211
01:15:21,853 --> 01:15:24,822
- Why? Because you are such an expert?
- You lied to me.

1212
01:15:24,889 --> 01:15:26,969
- You lied to the whole world.
- It's not the same.

1213
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:29,859
I hate to burst your bubble...

1214
01:15:29,927 --> 01:15:33,522
- but of course it is the same.
- Good-bye, Jack.

1215
01:15:33,598 --> 01:15:35,362
Now what are you gonna do?

1216
01:15:35,363 --> 01:15:37,125
I never said I was too
good to take a bus.

1217
01:15:37,201 --> 01:15:40,432
Okay, Shirlee, it all started, yes...

1218
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:42,973
because I wanted
to get a story on you.

1219
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:45,942
Then I began to care and...

1220
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:49,502
Geez, Louise!
God, you can be so pigheaded!

1221
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,309
Look.

1222
01:15:51,382 --> 01:15:53,976
No! Shirlee!

1223
01:16:24,315 --> 01:16:28,081
Burning to know you

1224
01:16:28,152 --> 01:16:31,815
Burning to show you

1225
01:16:31,889 --> 01:16:38,988
And I've felt this way from the start

1226
01:16:39,063 --> 01:16:42,157
Burning with passion

1227
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:46,897
I thought it was lasting

1228
01:16:46,971 --> 01:16:52,705
Now it's burning a hole in my heart

1229
01:16:52,777 --> 01:16:57,476
Here's Dr. Shirlee arriving to her
very first coast-to-coast broadcast.

1230
01:16:57,548 --> 01:17:00,574
A small but enthusiastic group of fans
has been waiting patiently...

1231
01:17:00,651 --> 01:17:02,812
to see their favorite
talk-show host.

1232
01:17:02,887 --> 01:17:04,752
Now they're showing
their appreciation.

1233
01:17:04,822 --> 01:17:07,655
Let's try to get her over here.

1234
01:17:07,725 --> 01:17:10,785
You shouldn't have told him to leave!

1235
01:17:10,862 --> 01:17:12,227
Who are you?

1236
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:13,908
You shouldn't have
told Sean to leave me.

1237
01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:15,359
Sean?

1238
01:17:15,433 --> 01:17:19,563
You destroy someone's life
and you don't even remember?

1239
01:17:19,637 --> 01:17:23,573
Sure! Sean was the sober alcoholic
and you wouldn't quit drinkin'.

1240
01:17:23,641 --> 01:17:25,802
All you know is his side.

1241
01:17:25,877 --> 01:17:28,117
We got drunk together for
years and I took care of him.

1242
01:17:28,118 --> 01:17:30,211
I took care of everything.

1243
01:17:30,281 --> 01:17:33,409
Then he sobers up and all of a
sudden he wants to be in charge.

1244
01:17:33,484 --> 01:17:36,510
He was so different it scared me.

1245
01:17:36,587 --> 01:17:40,079
I was afraid I was gonna lose him
so I got drunk a few times.

1246
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:41,648
Like now.

1247
01:17:41,726 --> 01:17:44,126
But I was trying to get help
when he left with the kids.

1248
01:17:44,195 --> 01:17:46,226
Did he tell you that?

1249
01:17:46,227 --> 01:17:48,256
Lady, you got a problem,
call her on the show.

1250
01:17:48,332 --> 01:17:51,699
- Let's go.
- Just wait a minute!

1251
01:17:51,769 --> 01:17:54,567
He told me you didn't have kids.

1252
01:17:54,639 --> 01:17:58,097
You think everybody that calls
is telling nothing but the truth?

1253
01:17:58,176 --> 01:18:02,374
I thought... Well, sure!
Why would they lie?

1254
01:18:02,447 --> 01:18:05,167
They're not talking to a friend on
the phone, they're on the radio!

1255
01:18:05,168 --> 01:18:07,849
Of course they're not going
to tell you the whole truth.

1256
01:18:07,919 --> 01:18:11,446
You tell them what to do and you don't
even know what's going on with 'em.

1257
01:18:11,522 --> 01:18:14,980
Are you gonna go?
Or do we have to move you?

1258
01:18:18,329 --> 01:18:20,991
I'm sober now.

1259
01:18:21,065 --> 01:18:26,196
And I am trying to get
my family back together.

1260
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,262
I just thought
you should know, is all.

1261
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:33,299
Great, well, thanks.
Can you believe that?

1262
01:18:33,377 --> 01:18:37,143
These whiny little people thinking they
can blame you for their pathetic lives?

1263
01:18:37,215 --> 01:18:40,343
What a loser! Geez.

1264
01:18:40,418 --> 01:18:42,443
Hey, lady?

1265
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,988
- Come on, guys!
- Look out, Mac.

1266
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:52,996
Excuse us.

1267
01:19:02,139 --> 01:19:04,073
W-N-D-Y...

1268
01:19:04,141 --> 01:19:08,908
is proud to present Chicago's
foremost radio psychologist...

1269
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:11,608
Dr. Shirlee!

1270
01:19:11,682 --> 01:19:15,812
"This is Dr. Shirlee and I want
to welcome our new listeners.

1271
01:19:15,887 --> 01:19:19,186
"I feel privileged to have you
listenin' in and I hope you'll call...

1272
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:21,418
"because without you...

1273
01:19:24,195 --> 01:19:26,823
without you..."

1274
01:19:51,989 --> 01:19:53,957
I'm sorry.

1275
01:19:54,025 --> 01:19:58,485
I can't do this.

1276
01:19:58,563 --> 01:20:01,930
I just can't!

1277
01:20:01,999 --> 01:20:04,126
I've been lying to you.

1278
01:20:04,201 --> 01:20:07,034
I'm not a doctor.

1279
01:20:07,104 --> 01:20:12,007
In fact, my last job was teachin'
dancin' in a place called Flat River.

1280
01:20:12,076 --> 01:20:15,534
I've been lyin' to all you people.

1281
01:20:15,613 --> 01:20:19,947
I'm not qualified to give you advice.

1282
01:20:20,017 --> 01:20:22,542
Maybe nobody is.

1283
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:27,023
After talkin' to you two or
three minutes on the radio...

1284
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:30,549
I'm givin' you advice based
on the version of the truth...

1285
01:20:30,628 --> 01:20:34,029
that you want me and
the listeners to hear.

1286
01:20:34,098 --> 01:20:35,895
Sean...

1287
01:20:35,967 --> 01:20:39,960
if you're out there,
Lord knows I hope you're listenin'.

1288
01:20:40,037 --> 01:20:43,302
If you left your wife
because I told you to...

1289
01:20:43,374 --> 01:20:46,434
well, you left for the wrong reasons.

1290
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:51,345
Never let anybody tell you
whether to stay or go...

1291
01:20:51,415 --> 01:20:53,508
whether to take this job
or that job...

1292
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:58,351
whether to put up with
your mother or tell her off.

1293
01:20:58,422 --> 01:21:00,515
You know why?

1294
01:21:00,591 --> 01:21:04,755
Because it's your life.
It's gotta be your decision.

1295
01:21:06,998 --> 01:21:11,128
Maybe what's right for somebody
else, may not be right for you.

1296
01:21:13,204 --> 01:21:15,297
Sean...

1297
01:21:15,373 --> 01:21:17,466
Ann loves you.

1298
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:21,307
Talk together.
Work it out together.

1299
01:21:21,379 --> 01:21:23,370
You decide what to do.

1300
01:21:23,447 --> 01:21:26,644
Lord, I've never come up
with a solution in my own life...

1301
01:21:26,717 --> 01:21:29,311
that wasn't worse than the problem
I had in the first place...

1302
01:21:29,387 --> 01:21:32,447
so who in the hell am
I to be tellin' you anything?

1303
01:21:32,523 --> 01:21:35,549
I can't do it anymore.

1304
01:21:35,626 --> 01:21:38,595
I'm done lyin' to you.

1305
01:21:38,663 --> 01:21:41,826
I thank you for listenin'.

1306
01:21:41,899 --> 01:21:44,231
This is Shirlee signing off.

1307
01:21:55,212 --> 01:21:58,739
I'm returnin' the car.
It goes with the job.

1308
01:22:01,519 --> 01:22:04,488
Wherever you're going,
you'll need a car.

1309
01:22:04,555 --> 01:22:07,854
Nobody needs a $60,000 car.

1310
01:22:07,925 --> 01:22:11,292
Anyway, I'm not really a Mercedes.

1311
01:22:11,362 --> 01:22:15,162
I'm just a plain old Pontiac.

1312
01:22:16,901 --> 01:22:19,131
Maybe a Chevy.

1313
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:37,752
- So you haven't seen her?
- No sign of her, sir.

1314
01:22:50,234 --> 01:22:52,202
Go ahead. You're on.

1315
01:22:52,269 --> 01:22:55,238
- Hi, this is Debbie from Glen Oaks.
- Hi.

1316
01:22:55,306 --> 01:22:58,673
Maybe we could do something
to show Shirlee we care about her.

1317
01:22:58,743 --> 01:23:00,677
And what would that be?

1318
01:23:00,745 --> 01:23:03,259
She was always talking
about honking your own horn.

1319
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,773
Yeah.

1320
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:10,344
Maybe we could honk our
horns at, like, midnight.

1321
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:13,083
Great! Great!

1322
01:23:13,157 --> 01:23:15,990
Honk your horns
for Shirlee at midnight!

1323
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:20,827
There's no flight anywhere near Flat
River, Arkansas, tonight at all?

1324
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,964
Okay, yes, sorry. Thanks.

1325
01:23:26,403 --> 01:23:29,429
Hey, I thought you got fired.

1326
01:23:29,507 --> 01:23:31,873
Close. I quit.

1327
01:23:31,942 --> 01:23:34,342
Just making a phone call.
It was a toll-free number.

1328
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:15,080
Don't jump!

1329
01:24:15,152 --> 01:24:18,849
- Don't jump. Don't jump!
- Not again.

1330
01:24:18,923 --> 01:24:21,915
Law of averages,
this time you'll kill me.

1331
01:24:21,992 --> 01:24:23,789
What are you doing here?

1332
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:25,920
Wishin'.

1333
01:24:25,996 --> 01:24:27,759
Wishin' for what?

1334
01:24:29,934 --> 01:24:33,301
Wishin' I knew what to wish for now.

1335
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,304
You were right.

1336
01:24:35,372 --> 01:24:39,536
I'm just a dance teacher with some
cheap advice and easy answers.

1337
01:24:40,878 --> 01:24:43,346
No, I wasn't.

1338
01:24:43,414 --> 01:24:46,679
Not according to your listeners.

1339
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:49,344
They've been calling
since you walked off.

1340
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:53,584
Talking about how much they
love you, how you've helped them...

1341
01:24:53,657 --> 01:24:56,405
how the days and nights
are easier thanks

1342
01:24:56,406 --> 01:24:59,152
to Shirlee's laughter,
Shirlee's wisdom.

1343
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,198
It's you they need, Shirlee.

1344
01:25:01,265 --> 01:25:04,860
It doesn't matter if you're a
dance teacher or trapeze artist.

1345
01:25:04,935 --> 01:25:08,268
It doesn't matter! It's you.

1346
01:25:08,339 --> 01:25:10,807
What about Sean?
I could've wrecked his marriage!

1347
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:14,003
Sean called right after you walked off.
He was gonna leave her anyway.

1348
01:25:14,078 --> 01:25:16,069
He just wanted somebody
to agree with him.

1349
01:25:16,146 --> 01:25:19,138
If it hadn't been you,
it would've been someone else.

1350
01:25:19,216 --> 01:25:21,980
What's that?

1351
01:25:22,853 --> 01:25:24,912
Stay right here.

1352
01:25:26,557 --> 01:25:28,582
It's 12.00...

1353
01:25:28,659 --> 01:25:31,651
and if you're not honking your horn
for Shirlee, you should be.

1354
01:25:31,729 --> 01:25:34,163
They're honkin' for me?

1355
01:25:34,231 --> 01:25:36,631
Perlman had this idea that
everybody who cared about you...

1356
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,695
should honk their horns at midnight.

1357
01:25:38,769 --> 01:25:42,296
Everybody who cares about me
is honkin' their horn?

1358
01:25:42,373 --> 01:25:44,841
Everybody who loves you
is honking their horn.

1359
01:25:47,711 --> 01:25:49,702
Shirlee...

1360
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:53,614
what do you think about
the idea of a fresh start?

1361
01:25:58,689 --> 01:26:00,919
I'm sorry, Jack.

1362
01:26:00,991 --> 01:26:04,984
I just don't have another
fresh start left in me.

1363
01:26:25,849 --> 01:26:27,908
I'm sick of cornflakes.

1364
01:26:30,354 --> 01:26:32,754
Cornflakes?

1365
01:26:32,823 --> 01:26:36,589
I don't want to keep any more
cookies in the cookie jar.

1366
01:26:50,808 --> 01:26:53,402
Release the woman.!

1367
01:26:53,477 --> 01:26:56,105
Release the woman and place
your hands on your head.

1368
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,547
- What?
- They think you're tryin' to murder me.

1369
01:26:59,616 --> 01:27:01,550
Hands on head!

1370
01:27:04,088 --> 01:27:06,168
They think you're tryin'
to push me off the bridge.

1371
01:27:06,169 --> 01:27:07,922
Very funny.

1372
01:27:07,992 --> 01:27:10,756
Hey, Dr. Shirlee.
It's me, Phil, remember?

1373
01:27:10,828 --> 01:27:13,194
How's your daughter?

1374
01:27:13,263 --> 01:27:16,460
She's back in school and doing well
thanks to you, Dr. Shirlee.

1375
01:27:16,533 --> 01:27:19,559
- It's just Shirlee now.
- What?

1376
01:27:19,636 --> 01:27:22,605
I'm just Shirlee!

1377
01:27:31,882 --> 01:27:34,373
Gimme some straight talk
straight talk

1378
01:27:34,451 --> 01:27:36,976
And hold the sugar please

1379
01:27:37,054 --> 01:27:40,922
Straight talk, straight talk
sounds plenty sweet to me

1380
01:27:40,991 --> 01:27:45,257
Don't talk to me in circles
in some mumbo-jumbo jive

1381
01:27:45,329 --> 01:27:49,959
Gimme just straight talk
and we're gonna be all right

1382
01:27:50,034 --> 01:27:53,629
Hello, Shirlee here.
What can I do for you?

1383
01:27:53,704 --> 01:27:56,070
I feel women are
more evolved than men.

1384
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,074
Maybe the world is tougher for them.

1385
01:27:58,142 --> 01:28:00,235
But I know I'll be happier
as a woman.

1386
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:02,335
I'm already a female inside.

1387
01:28:02,413 --> 01:28:06,645
I want to be one on the outside too,
so I'm getting the change.

1388
01:28:06,717 --> 01:28:10,619
I was wondering if
you had any advice for me.

1389
01:28:10,687 --> 01:28:15,522
Gary, if you're sure that's what
you really want, all I can say is...

1390
01:28:15,592 --> 01:28:18,561
don't try to perm your own hair...

1391
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:21,792
and don't wear high heels
on a soggy lawn.

1392
01:28:21,865 --> 01:28:24,857
Shirlee here.
What's cooking?

1393
01:28:24,935 --> 01:28:27,665
Pick up the phone you're not alone

1394
01:28:27,738 --> 01:28:29,831
We've all got something to say

1395
01:28:29,907 --> 01:28:34,344
Listen in and listen up
we'll find a better way

1396
01:28:34,411 --> 01:28:39,212
With honesty and common sense
it's really hard to miss

1397
01:28:39,283 --> 01:28:43,720
Straight talk, straight talk
just tell it like it is

1398
01:28:43,787 --> 01:28:48,087
Straight talk, straight talk
don't sugar-coat it please

1399
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:52,322
Straight talk, straight talk
sounds sweet enough to me

1400
01:28:52,396 --> 01:28:56,992
Don't talk to me in circles
in some mumbo-jumbo jive

1401
01:28:57,067 --> 01:29:04,769
Straight talk, straight talk
and we're gonna be all right

1402
01:29:04,842 --> 01:29:08,778
Straight talk, straight talk
makes plenty sense to me

1403
01:29:08,846 --> 01:29:13,215
Don't talk to me in circles
in some mumbo-jumbo jive

1404
01:29:13,283 --> 01:29:17,276
Give me just straight talk
and we're gonna be all right

1405
01:29:17,354 --> 01:29:19,879
Give me just straight talk,
straight talk

1406
01:29:19,957 --> 01:29:23,120
And we're gonna

1407
01:29:23,193 --> 01:29:25,193
Be all right

1408
01:29:36,273 --> 01:29:42,269
I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

1409
01:29:42,346 --> 01:29:47,841
I can see the light
of a brand-new... day

1410
01:29:47,918 --> 01:29:50,751
Yes I can see the light

1411
01:29:50,821 --> 01:29:54,655
Of a clear blue morning

1412
01:29:54,725 --> 01:29:57,455
Everything's gonna be all right

1413
01:29:57,528 --> 01:30:00,429
Everything's gonna be all right

1414
01:30:00,497 --> 01:30:02,863
Everything's gonna be all right

1415
01:30:02,933 --> 01:30:05,993
It's gonna be okay

1416
01:30:06,069 --> 01:30:08,799
'Cause I can see the light

1417
01:30:08,872 --> 01:30:12,330
Of a clear blue morning

1418
01:30:12,409 --> 01:30:17,813
I can see the light
of a brand-new... day

1419
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:24,684
I can see the light
of a clear blue morning

1420
01:30:24,755 --> 01:30:28,623
Everything's gonna be Gonna be okay

1421
01:30:33,648 --> 01:30:37,648
