0
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,436
I'm very sorry to learn
of your abrupt departure,

1
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,606
Princess Ordana.
Urgent matters require

2
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,908
my immediate presence back home.

3
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:23,477
Speaking of home, how
are things back on Earth?

4
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,313
It's not looking good for
humankind.

5
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,550
Sorry to hear so. I hope all
works out.

6
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,218
We'll see.

7
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,287
The best of luck to you
and Earth, Princess Ordana.

8
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,658
Thanks, General. We're gonna
need it.

9
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,694
Engage departure process.

10
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,634
Here we go.

11
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,775
We're on our way back to good
old Earth.

12
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,311
Captain, can you connect
me to Senator Orden,

13
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,716
security code 991142.

14
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,852
Yes, Princess Ordana. One
moment.

15
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:07,655
Senator Orden. It's an
honor to speak with you again.

16
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,391
Princess Ordana. It's a
blessing to hear your voice.

17
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,468
I'm on my way back to join you

18
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,595
at the World Protection
League Assembly, Senator.

19
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,832
Don't expect good news.
It's a dangerous situation.

20
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,300
There is chatter of a
saboteur being deployed

21
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,970
inside our operations.

22
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:25,472
Did you hear from our old
friend?

23
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,775
You mean Captain Robert Tomlin?

24
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:31,445
Last I heard was he is fighting
with the American Raiders

25
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,949
in the Outlands border region,
fighting back the Neo-Chrome.

26
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,718
- Is Melanie with him?
- She is working

27
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:38,485
in the environmental labs.

28
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,022
They are under constant threat
of attack.

29
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,758
Please let them know that
I send my warmest wishes

30
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,594
and that I look forward
to seeing them again soon.

31
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,931
I will try to get a message
through to them if possible.

32
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:53,467
Thank you, Senator. I
hope they're all right.

33
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,397
Here we go.

34
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,335
Woo! American Raiders to the
rescue!

35
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:32,806
Come on!

36
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,009
American Raiders, take
the battle to the enemy.

37
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:43,878
Let's kick to Neo-Chrome butt!

38
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,660
Neo-Chrome's on the
run and I've got him.

39
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,563
He won't get far. I'm right on
his ass.

40
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,833
Got him right in my crosshairs.

41
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,870
Woo, got him!

42
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,852
Failure to realize the
reality of their defeat

43
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,288
and certain termination
of the United States.

44
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,991
While Central Asia, the Middle
East,

45
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,959
Europe and much of South America

46
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,962
have already been overrun by
our glorious, Neo-Chrome Army,

47
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:17,865
it's the arrogant Americans
who refuses to let themselves

48
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,634
be ruled by the superior
Neo-Chrome Rulership.

49
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:26,173
How much more blood must
be shed, red or black,

50
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,576
before the United States
will accept their demise

51
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,745
and will forever cease to exist?

52
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,516
Death to America!

53
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,918
Death to America!

54
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:41,655
Death to America! Death to
America!

55
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,991
Death to America!

56
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:46,594
Death to America!

57
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,630
The situation is getting
worse by the minute.

58
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,666
The forces of darkness
are about to take over.

59
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,703
We've been able to
fight off the Neo-Chrome

60
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,905
for the past three years,

61
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,974
but the severity of the
situation

62
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,209
cannot be underlined enough.

63
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:06,680
The Neo-Chrome advances on US
soil have been unprecedented.

64
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,063
Oh God! No more protection!

65
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:26,067
The flagship is burning! God,
no!

66
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,635
It's a bloody ambush!

67
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:29,970
We're being attacked!

68
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,640
It's a surprise attack.

69
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:38,712
Come on! Let's send 'em
straight back to hell!

70
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,014
Ah, it's too late. Uh!

71
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,086
The World Protection League
Flagship is going implode.

72
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,621
It's gonna go! No!

73
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,784
Eagle One, requesting
disengagement.

74
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,255
Mission Retaliation is a go,
over.

75
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:58,692
Repeat, Mission Retaliation is a
go.

76
00:10:58,726 --> 00:10:59,727
Here we go.

77
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,429
Not much time.

78
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,791
Sir, the World
Protection League Flagship

79
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,092
has been destroyed, sir.

80
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,161
That can't be, soldier.

81
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:35,763
- Sir-
- That's not possible,

82
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,131
soldier, you know that.

83
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,767
- It happened, sir.
- Any survivors?

84
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,402
- None.
- What about my daughter?

85
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,505
Princess Ordana is, we lost her.

86
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,443
Neo-Chrome's on the run, 104.

87
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:02,856
Let's send 'em straight back to
hell.

88
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,026
Here we go.

89
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,998
For all of humankind.

90
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,904
Target hit. Target hit.

91
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,739
Good hit. Good hit.

92
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,910
Heading back to base.

93
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:26,548
The target's hit.

94
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:29,183
Copy that. Good job, Eagle
One.

95
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,818
Mission completed. Over.

96
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,228
Assemble the American Raiders.

97
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,296
I wanna talk to them.

98
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:44,598
Yes, sir.

99
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,070
They are our last hope.

100
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:00,847
No!

101
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:38,085
Melanie!

102
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,187
American Raiders assembled.

103
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,223
You are here today to unite and
fight

104
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,560
for the future of our very
existence.

105
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:48,896
I want you to know, I'm proud of
you.

106
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,065
Semper Fi.
Semper Fi!

107
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,452
Get in, come on! Come on,
let's go!

108
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,485
Get over here!

109
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,090
Move!

110
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,599
Go, put out the fire, dammit!

111
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,195
Let's go! Move this thing!

112
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,277
- Hey, Tomlin.
- Listen,

113
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,646
sequence reports.

114
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,380
I need them. How are they
coming?

115
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,759
I need to find out if
there's any mistakes,

116
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:24,752
glitches or snags before
I roll this one out.

117
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:27,221
The last thing I wanna do
is piss off any customers

118
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,223
now that business is booming,
okay?

119
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,496
And Tomlin, you come to the
club, we'll take care of you.

120
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:33,628
All right, brother. I'll see you
up there.

121
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,317
What do you say, Melanie?

122
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,353
I wanted

123
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,188
to ask you something.

124
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,392
And I know that we talked about
it before,

125
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,862
but I want you to really
think about it this time.

126
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:42,362
What is it, Melly?

127
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:46,634
Well, we've been
together for nine years.

128
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:49,436
I mean, don't you think it's
time that we got married?

129
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:54,074
As soon as the war is
over me, Melly. I promise.

130
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,145
Hmm.

131
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,714
Do you think we're soul mates?

132
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,116
We must be me, Melly.

133
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,319
We must be.

134
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,589
We've been together all these
years. Okay?

135
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:10,324
Oh, I got something for you.

136
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:17,164
I want to open it here.

137
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,398
What is this?

138
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:23,236
It's a sign of our love.

139
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,275
Thank you, baby.

140
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:36,283
I love you, baby.

141
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,585
I love you too.

142
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,237
Hey, Tomlin. I was just
checking on ya.

143
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,305
Everything all right?

144
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:05,713
- What do you want?
- I was just checking on you.

145
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:09,249
Hey, uh, you got any sequences
you need help checking?

146
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:11,686
On mine?

147
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,187
Come on, man, give me a chance

148
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,457
because I wanna play with the
best.

149
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,627
Plus, I know that you have
access

150
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:21,228
to all the latest sequences.

151
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:25,667
Oh yeah? And how do you know
that?

152
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,903
Please. Man, I got skills,
Tomlin.

153
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:29,971
I looked you up.

154
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:32,507
You were one of the hardcore
gamers

155
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,617
back in the original Ice Age.

156
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:34,509
Come on.

157
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:37,444
Just give me a chance to play
with you

158
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,312
and show you how good I am.

159
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:43,551
I know that you test sequences
for Calvin.

160
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:46,688
What changed you, Tomlin?

161
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:47,721
Was it the war?

162
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:50,924
It's her, isn't it?

163
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,729
You've never been the
same since you lost her.

164
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,265
I know she was your soul mate.

165
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,468
I know what that means.

166
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:08,810
I know what it's like to lose
someone

167
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:10,945
that you have an eternal
connection with.

168
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,750
And it's, it's easy to feel lost

169
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:18,385
after you lose your best friend.

170
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:23,558
I too lost my dad to the war.

171
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,528
I'll never get over it,

172
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,833
and I know you'll never
get over what happened

173
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,535
to you and her, but Tomlin,

174
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:38,472
we're still breathing
and we owe it to them to,

175
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:42,275
to keep going because they're
watching

176
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,612
and because they want us to live

177
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:48,983
and well 'cause it matters.

178
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:03,030
I have a new sequence
Calvin wants me to run.

179
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:04,264
Wanna tag along?

180
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:08,870
I would be delighted to.

181
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:12,507
You're so not gonna regret
this, man.

182
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:25,980
Bomb salute.

183
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:31,145
Uh!

184
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:55,503
- Oh, shit.
- Nice job.

185
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:57,671
Yeah. Not bad.

186
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:52,026
Are you looking for me?

187
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:55,930
Yeah, you ugly cockroach.

188
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:08,776
It's a glitch. The game froze.

189
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,813
You need a driller bullet.

190
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:14,281
See his core is in a shell.

191
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,060
The only way to kill him is
with a drill-head bullet.

192
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:18,285
The one with the red tip.

193
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,856
It'll drill right through his
shell.

194
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:22,923
And they go

195
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:24,959
for a million points.
Really?

196
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:30,197
Are you ready to get outta here?

197
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,735
Um, hey.

198
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,837
Tomlin, Tomlin, I...

199
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:38,739
Well I wanted to, um,

200
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,008
well I wanted,

201
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:43,811
I wanted to thank you

202
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,648
for, you know,

203
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:51,752
like taking me with you and
stuff.

204
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,023
Okay.

205
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,294
I'll see you later. All right?

206
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:03,697
Yeah, totally. You'll
see me later.

207
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:06,967
Um, you know, like if
you need anything at all,

208
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:08,002
you can call me

209
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:12,640
because you know you're gonna
need me.

210
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:20,381
He'll need me one day.

211
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,032
How is she?

212
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,402
Her condition's unchanged.

213
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,805
There's no indication at
all she's coming back.

214
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:54,708
All we can do is keep the
machines going

215
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,210
and hope for the best.

216
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:03,143
Drink it immediately.

217
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:04,417
- Fun.
- Mm, thank you, brother.

218
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:05,445
Here you go.

219
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:10,951
- Sorry I'm late.
- Yeah, no.

220
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:11,995
Hold on, brother. I'm confused.

221
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:14,488
So where's the glitch?

222
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,225
It's at the end of the game.

223
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:20,571
It's at the final stage when
you're about to kill Neo-Kahn,

224
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:22,296
the action suddenly freezes up
on you.

225
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,565
Which is what I told you.

226
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:24,798
Okay. Why?

227
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,877
It has to do with the fact
that there aren't enough points

228
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:31,171
in the game in order to
terminate the son of a bitch.

229
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:34,174
See, I don't, I don't
know what that means.

230
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,810
You have to have at least
a million points accumulated

231
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:38,021
because in order to kill Neo
Kahn,

232
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:40,447
because you have to trade in
for a red drill-head bullet.

233
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:44,151
And we only have 957,000.

234
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:46,120
Right, I mean, is that,
is what she's saying,

235
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:47,154
is that right?

236
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:49,356
There's not enough points
to be had in the game?

237
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:52,035
Tell your guy that forgot to
put you

238
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,995
on that special object is gonna
earn you a million points.

239
00:29:56,598 --> 00:30:00,301
Everything else is shoot
'em up sequence stuff

240
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:03,337
based on an original Dorian
Terrell 3-D game engine,

241
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:06,608
modified with Neo-Chrome
graphics, all standard stuff.

242
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:09,943
Tomlin, you gonna come program
some new sequences for us.

243
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,378
This shit's exploding right now

244
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:13,247
and nobody can do it like you.

245
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,482
Calvin, I can't do it anymore.

246
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:18,553
Come on, Tomlin. We miss you.

247
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:21,989
No, I'll troubleshoot the
occasional sequence for you

248
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:23,558
and that's it.
Ah, war must have been

249
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:25,059
a little rough on you, huh?

250
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:27,026
How is she?

251
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:30,564
Still the same.

252
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:33,400
Well, listen, we're
gonna go and let you do

253
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:35,078
whatever the hell it is
you do in that apartment

254
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:35,903
of yours, right?

255
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:38,005
Here's some money for you. Thank
you.

256
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:41,075
- Thanks.
- Yeah, of course.

257
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,080
Tomlin, if there's anything you
need,

258
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:49,183
anything whatsoever, don't
hesitate to call, okay?

259
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:50,918
Our lines are always open.

260
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:52,186
All right?
Always open all.

261
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,987
- All right.
- All right?

262
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,523
Ah, um. All right.

263
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:57,458
- All right.
- Oh, you kidding me?

264
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:58,892
Mm. Bye, buddy.

265
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:01,328
Send her my regards.

266
00:31:22,983 --> 00:31:25,085
Hey, kind of late to be alone
at night.

267
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,282
All right.

268
00:31:57,552 --> 00:32:02,256
Let's go, come on, let's go.
Hey, let's get out of here.

269
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:59,547
We're here.

270
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:45,720
I had you brought here
because you are the best.

271
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:46,554
For what?

272
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:49,389
For the job I'm about to offer
you.

273
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:51,124
I'm a damn legless cripple.

274
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:54,796
Trust me, Mr. Tomlin.

275
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:58,800
There is only one man
for the job, that's you.

276
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:02,870
What job exactly are you
referring to?

277
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:06,340
A mission. A rescue
mission, if you will.

278
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:08,308
- To rescue what?
- Our World.

279
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:10,712
The planet is fucked.

280
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:12,880
And there's no way
back. We both know that.

281
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:15,315
What if I tell you there is a
way?

282
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:16,551
I'd tell you you're crazy.

283
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:17,795
You can call me that if you
like,

284
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:20,588
but that wouldn't change my
resolve

285
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:24,391
in pursuing certain options
that are available to me.

286
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:26,193
- What options?
- Oh, come to that

287
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,662
in a moment.

288
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:30,497
First we have to make sure
we're all on the same page.

289
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:41,208
As president, I have
tremendous responsibility.

290
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:43,745
I have to make sure that certain
things

291
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:45,479
are executed to the T.

292
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:49,517
Even if I don't agree
with measures sometimes,

293
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:54,354
but sometimes tough measures
get tough things accomplished.

294
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:03,764
Melanie.

295
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:19,647
What did you inject her with?

296
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:21,415
Very sorry, Mr. Tomlin.

297
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:23,518
A virus has infected Private
Hendy.

298
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:27,655
No!

299
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:41,703
We don't have much time, Mr.
Tomlin.

300
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:43,203
The clock is ticking.

301
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:47,675
The virus is moving towards
her heart as we speak.

302
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:51,512
Once it reaches it,
Private Hendy will pass.

303
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:52,613
What are you saying?

304
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,616
There is only one
way to clean the system

305
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,352
from the invading forces as
well as destroy the virus

306
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,990
in Private Hendy's bloodstream
before it reaches her heart.

307
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,659
What do you want me to do?

308
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,661
Are you sure you are ready for
this?

309
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:08,596
I'll do whatever it takes.

310
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:25,823
Now that I have your attention,

311
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:28,015
we can talk constructively.

312
00:37:28,683 --> 00:37:30,785
- I'm all ears.
- Have you ever heard

313
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:33,286
of Dorian Terrell?

314
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,690
You mean the inventor of
the original 3-DS Engine?

315
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:37,992
Do you know whatever happened
to him?

316
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:40,393
Nobody knows for sure, I think,

317
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,672
I think he died in the late
60's.

318
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:44,498
What else do you know?

319
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:47,034
Many people compare
him to that other guy

320
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:48,903
from the early 20th century,
Einstein.

321
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:51,572
His theories and thecalculations
are the very foundation

322
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:53,708
in which the 3-DS Grid was built
upon.

323
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:57,011
Terrell was a genius. No
doubt.

324
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,349
He also knew that one day
the grid couldn't withstand

325
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:04,317
an attack from the outside.

326
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:08,723
That's why he integrated a
security measure into thesystem,

327
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:12,325
a switch, so to speak,
in the event evil forces

328
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,461
should ever attempt to overrun
the system.

329
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:18,699
A total reboot of the
system in order to wipe out

330
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:21,068
any and all invading elements.

331
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:23,905
I never heard of that.

332
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:29,944
Terrell was a dreamer, a,
a gamer, a child at heart.

333
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:32,980
You are a gamer.

334
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:38,385
This is your chance to
save the World, Mr. Tomlin.

335
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:41,388
As well as Melanie.

336
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:43,958
- What's the mission?
- You need to find the switch.

337
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:46,961
It's also known under a
different name.

338
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,130
- What's that?
- The Indochine.

339
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:50,865
Ever heard of it?
No.

340
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:53,067
You need to find it and switch
it on.

341
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,736
That's the only way to destroy
the virus

342
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,873
and the invading forces
before they destroy us all.

343
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,942
You've got 18 hours.

344
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:03,044
I wouldn't know where to begin.

345
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:06,047
Before Mr. Terrell passed in
2062,

346
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,549
he gave this to his wife Emily.

347
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,450
The Eye of the Beholder.

348
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:13,120
It's a Masonic symbol
from two centuries ago.

349
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,992
Or new Order of the Ages.

350
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:19,527
Beginning of a new era.

351
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,096
His wife Emily sent it
to the residing president

352
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:25,099
of the United States just before
she died

353
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:28,002
and joined her husband being
frozen.

354
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:30,037
It has been passed on from
president

355
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:31,873
to president since then,

356
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:35,576
till the day its secret
would have to be uncovered

357
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,410
as it would hold the last chance

358
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:39,614
for survival for the human race.

359
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:42,617
Farewell, Mr. Tomlin.
We're all counting on you.

360
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:06,200
Yeah, Ben Gordon here.

361
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:07,234
Lieutenant Gordon.

362
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,705
Captain R. Tomlin. How are you?

363
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:16,043
Tomlin? Robert Tomlin.

364
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:17,712
You old hound dog. How you
doing?

365
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:19,513
Uh, we haven't talked since-

366
00:41:19,547 --> 00:41:21,115
- Since I lost her and my legs.

367
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:24,919
Yeah. Sorry.

368
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:26,120
How you holding up, man?

369
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:29,523
Look, Gordon. I don't
have a lot of time.

370
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:32,126
I've got a job and I need
good men to help me execute.

371
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:36,230
What'd you say if I asked you
first?

372
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,001
What kind of job are we talking?

373
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:42,970
That's classified at
this point, but, uh,

374
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:45,239
let's just say it comes from
the highest authorities.

375
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:47,008
- From who?
- More importantly,

376
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,709
Private Hendy's life depends on.

377
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,579
Private Hendy? What
are you talking about?

378
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,047
I thought she was in a coma.

379
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,958
A deadly virus is heading
towards Melanie's heart

380
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:57,284
as we speak, we have 14 hours to
execute.

381
00:41:58,252 --> 00:41:59,720
Okay. All right.

382
00:42:00,388 --> 00:42:03,758
Gordon, there's one more
thing I have to tell you.

383
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:05,926
This might be a mission with no
return.

384
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:14,702
A suicide mission, huh?

385
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:19,673
Wow. I wouldn't have any other
way.

386
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:24,078
Oh, and Gordon, I'll need
the usual band of brothers.

387
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:27,014
Don't worry about that.
I'll bring three of my best.

388
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:28,215
Do I know any of them?

389
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:30,084
Nah. They're all new material.

390
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:32,119
Are they good enough for the
job?

391
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:33,296
- They're the best.
- Look forward

392
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,156
to meeting them.
All right.

393
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:38,993
When and where do we meet?
3DS. universe.

394
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:44,031
5238. dragon square. street.
Main grid.

395
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,032
20 minutes.
Okay.

396
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:48,235
I'll see you there, my
friend. Over and out.

397
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,968
Been too long, man.

398
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:56,070
Another two, please.

399
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:01,775
I am very grateful for your
help, Gordon. I mean it.

400
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:03,043
I gotta tell you though,

401
00:44:03,944 --> 00:44:07,281
I was only able to commit
two men to this mission.

402
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:08,692
'Cause of the short notice, you
know?

403
00:44:08,716 --> 00:44:11,919
I mean.
We'll work with what we've got.

404
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:14,355
All right.

405
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:19,093
All right.

406
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:20,794
They should be here any minute.

407
00:44:29,136 --> 00:44:31,739
Sergeant Ramirez reporting
for active duty, sir.

408
00:44:32,607 --> 00:44:36,143
Sergeant Ramirez. Glad
that you could make it.

409
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:38,279
This is a very important mission
here.

410
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:41,115
I'd like you to meet
the old friend of mine.

411
00:44:41,148 --> 00:44:42,983
Captain Robert Tomlin.

412
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:45,052
Captain. A pleasure to meet
you.

413
00:44:45,085 --> 00:44:46,187
I've heard lots about you.

414
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,722
Well, it's good to meet
you too, Sergeant Ramirez,

415
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:50,316
I'm looking forward to working
with you.

416
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:54,461
My sincere condolences
about what has happened

417
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:55,930
to your loved one, sir.

418
00:44:57,398 --> 00:44:59,833
Oh, thanks, Sergeant Ramirez.

419
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,335
Appreciate your thoughts.

420
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,404
My brother was lost in the war
as well.

421
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:06,774
Sorry to hear that.

422
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:09,009
I would do anything
to make him proud, sir.

423
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,979
All right. At ease, Sergeant.

424
00:45:13,948 --> 00:45:15,216
Here's Sergeant Vargaz now.

425
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,420
Lieutenant Gordon.

426
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:22,823
It's an honor to serve
with you again, sir.

427
00:45:24,225 --> 00:45:25,492
You must be Captain Tomlin.

428
00:45:27,228 --> 00:45:29,230
It's an honor meeting
you, Sergeant Vargas.

429
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:33,133
That's it. That's the team.

430
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:35,936
So you gonna brief us in?

431
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,938
It's on a need-to-know basis.

432
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:39,873
Tomlin, I would normally never
take a,

433
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:42,876
a mission like this under
these circumstances,

434
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,246
but I trust you.
Yes, I know.

435
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:57,424
Hey, looks like you
could use another man.

436
00:45:58,959 --> 00:45:59,793
What are you doing here?

437
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:02,296
This is a dangerous job, not a
game.

438
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,532
Hey. We all gotta die sometime
right?

439
00:46:04,566 --> 00:46:07,001
Might as well die doing
something worthwhile.

440
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:10,004
I got skills, Tomlin.

441
00:46:10,037 --> 00:46:11,037
All right.

442
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,908
Gordon, this is Minnesota and
she's an exceptional player.

443
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:18,178
All right. Welcome aboard.

444
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:20,114
Glad to have you.

445
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:22,283
All right. Well, let's go do
this.

446
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:42,436
Look. This is the great seal.

447
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:45,472
What are you talking about?

448
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:49,076
The great seal, man.

449
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:51,078
Thank you. Thank you very
much.

450
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:03,090
So what is this?

451
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:06,126
That's the symbol
leading to the Indochine.

452
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:09,129
The Indo what?

453
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:12,166
The item we're looking for.

454
00:47:14,636 --> 00:47:17,004
All right, let's, let's
get some of these boxes

455
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:18,038
out of the way.

456
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:34,088
So what do you want us to do
with this?

457
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:35,198
- Let's move it.
- All right.

458
00:47:35,222 --> 00:47:36,390
You heard him. Let's go.

459
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:41,127
Let's go.

460
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:45,599
Oh, come on.

461
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,150
Gordon, tell the men to clear
the area.

462
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:05,085
All right. Let's step back.

463
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:15,529
Holy cow.

464
00:48:33,981 --> 00:48:38,085
Well, well what do we have here?

465
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:47,662
Looks like a tunnel to
the building next door.

466
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:50,297
Looks like somebody doesn't
want us to go in there.

467
00:48:58,338 --> 00:48:59,750
Are you man enough for the
challenge?

468
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:01,743
My men will follow me
to the end of the World

469
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:02,776
if I tell him to.

470
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:06,681
It's fine with me.

471
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:09,049
No problem here, sir.

472
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:11,218
How about you?

473
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:13,187
- Hey.
- All right.

474
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,022
Let's enter the belly of the
beast.

475
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:19,561
Uh!

476
00:50:02,637 --> 00:50:03,637
What's that?

477
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,173
Toothpick.

478
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:08,308
- Why now?
- I'm trying to quit

479
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:10,210
smoking these damn cigars.

480
00:50:11,613 --> 00:50:13,213
- Yeah, right.
- Excuse me.

481
00:50:34,368 --> 00:50:36,470
Must have been
abandoned a long time ago.

482
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,670
Uh.

483
00:51:11,606 --> 00:51:13,240
Welcome to St. Augusta.

484
00:52:18,906 --> 00:52:21,341
So how's that toothpick
working out for you?

485
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:28,482
Well, it ain't no cigar that's
for sure.

486
00:53:05,385 --> 00:53:06,385
Clear.

487
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:54,067
Tomlin.

488
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:03,544
Seriously, man, this is not
funny.

489
00:54:04,846 --> 00:54:07,782
Seriously, man, this is not
funny!

490
00:54:07,815 --> 00:54:09,282
Oh, hey. How are ya?

491
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:14,287
Zombies!

492
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:22,530
Damn.

493
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:25,566
Ah, zombies.

494
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:27,601
Why zombies?

495
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:31,371
Yeah, I'd rather deal with
Neo-Chromes if you ask me.

496
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:32,673
I hate zombies.

497
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:07,074
Mm-hmm.

498
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:32,533
Minnesota!

499
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:34,836
Right here!

500
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:37,037
Shit.

501
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,542
Looks like the party's started.

502
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:04,899
Looks like we stirred the
hornet's nest.

503
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,480
The more we shoot them,
the more new ones appear.

504
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:22,683
Watch out! The classic
watershed routine.

505
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,659
The more you dig a problem,
the bigger it gets.

506
00:56:40,635 --> 00:56:42,203
Whoever designed this earlier
knew it.

507
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:46,741
There has to be a back
door out of here somehow.

508
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,011
Yeah, but what if there isn't
one?

509
00:56:51,512 --> 00:56:53,214
Prepare to have your brains
eaten.

510
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,792
Going to run out of ammo soon.

511
00:57:10,865 --> 00:57:12,133
They're getting closer!

512
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:21,709
There's gotta be an
elevator in here somewhere.

513
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:23,142
Elevator. There must be an
elevator.

514
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:25,947
Bingo. That must be it.

515
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,882
- Must be what?
- The back door.

516
00:57:27,915 --> 00:57:29,050
The way to level one.

517
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:32,887
Ramirez, you see an elevator
down there?

518
00:57:36,257 --> 00:57:38,926
I can see it, sir.
It's down that hallway.

519
00:57:41,228 --> 00:57:44,031
Okay, let's get there.
Let's move, move, move, move!~

520
00:57:52,907 --> 00:57:53,907
Let's go!

521
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:03,050
Move!

522
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:19,600
Get the door!

523
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:41,621
Move it!

524
00:58:42,323 --> 00:58:43,991
Come on! Come on!

525
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,798
It's coming!

526
00:58:54,635 --> 00:58:57,705
Move, move, move, move, move,
move!

527
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,676
Where's that elevator?
It's coming!

528
00:59:13,754 --> 00:59:16,357
Where the hell is that elevator?

529
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,959
Oh shit! I'm out of ammo!

530
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:21,028
Be torn to pieces!

531
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:22,596
Get me the elevator!
Hurry!

532
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:31,337
Come on!

533
00:59:43,284 --> 00:59:44,351
Hold!

534
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:58,165
All right, go on move back,
move back!

535
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:00,267
Come on, we gotta move back,
move back!

536
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:05,773
All right.

537
01:00:06,974 --> 01:00:11,946
Come on. We gotta move back.

538
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:14,247
Come on!

539
01:00:22,756 --> 01:00:26,260
Get back, back up in here, in
here!

540
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:28,062
Back, back, get in!
Let's go, get in!

541
01:00:28,095 --> 01:00:30,264
Get in! Let's go!

542
01:00:37,338 --> 01:00:39,974
Get those doors closed!

543
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,110
Gordon!

544
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:49,183
Get those closed!

545
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:52,720
Get him off!

546
01:00:58,893 --> 01:00:59,893
Got bit.

547
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:01,794
Gordon, you okay?

548
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:03,998
Everybody reload.

549
01:01:07,301 --> 01:01:10,171
Shit. That was close.

550
01:01:31,892 --> 01:01:33,694
Give me your hand.

551
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:37,064
You know they're gonna
come after us. Right?

552
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:39,900
I'll stay behind and hold
them back as long as I can.

553
01:01:40,669 --> 01:01:42,403
You have to continue on your
way.

554
01:01:43,837 --> 01:01:44,506
You sure about that, Ramirez.

555
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:46,307
She knows what she's doing.

556
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,409
You've gotta get going.
There won't be much time.

557
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:49,843
I've got your backs.

558
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:53,012
All right.

559
01:02:10,164 --> 01:02:12,433
Let's go.

560
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:15,402
Go.

561
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:21,808
Ramirez.

562
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:26,447
Keep radio contact.

563
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:31,284
Yes, sir.

564
01:02:34,488 --> 01:02:35,488
All right.

565
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:48,536
I don't want you to do this,
Ramirez.

566
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:49,570
It's suicide.

567
01:02:51,573 --> 01:02:53,907
Don't worry about me, captain.

568
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:55,009
I know what I'm doing.

569
01:02:57,378 --> 01:03:00,981
Besides, if my brother
can sacrifice himself

570
01:03:01,015 --> 01:03:03,551
for his country, so can I.

571
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:07,821
Hmm. Sure?

572
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:10,356
Yes, sir.

573
01:03:11,593 --> 01:03:13,027
Go save your loved one.

574
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:15,395
Do it for me.

575
01:03:29,443 --> 01:03:30,443
Thank you.

576
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:36,150
Here.

577
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:37,183
Thank you, sir.

578
01:03:46,226 --> 01:03:48,630
Good luck, sir. See you on the
other side.

579
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:19,860
- Hear that?
- Yeah, yeah.

580
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:23,430
Vargaz, you wanna check that
out?

581
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:25,332
Go ahead. Go ahead.

582
01:04:29,036 --> 01:04:30,672
Hey. Be careful.

583
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:36,175
Let's go.

584
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:38,138
- What's your name?
- Emily.

585
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:39,172
Uh.

586
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:44,311
What are you drawing there?

587
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:45,344
You.

588
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:48,448
A shark?

589
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,322
Hey, where are you going?

590
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:57,324
- Vargaz, come in.
- Yes, sir.

591
01:05:57,357 --> 01:05:58,225
Everything okay over there?

592
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,360
I got everything under control
here.

593
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:11,566
Tomlin.

594
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:18,806
- Hey little boy.
- Hey.

595
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,642
Hi. How are you?

596
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:23,377
- Who are you?
- I'm Robert Tomlin.

597
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:26,748
And this is Lieutenant Gordon
and my friend Minnesota.

598
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,616
What's your name? Dorian
Terrell?

599
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:31,786
How do you know that?

600
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:33,453
- Just a hunch.
- Why are you here?

601
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:34,722
Are you gonna play with me?

602
01:07:34,756 --> 01:07:37,592
Actually, we are here

603
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:39,359
with a very special plea,
Dorian.

604
01:07:40,193 --> 01:07:45,232
I have a friend who is also my
soulmate and she's very ill.

605
01:07:45,265 --> 01:07:47,200
What's wrong with her?

606
01:07:47,234 --> 01:07:49,771
A virus has her in its control,

607
01:07:50,872 --> 01:07:54,474
a very deadly virus and it's
traveling towards her heart

608
01:07:54,509 --> 01:07:57,311
and when it gets there,
it's gonna be too late.

609
01:07:57,344 --> 01:08:00,848
So a very important person told
me

610
01:08:01,749 --> 01:08:04,184
that there's only one
thing that can save her.

611
01:08:04,217 --> 01:08:05,217
What's that?

612
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:08,790
They told me it's called the
Indochine.

613
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:13,093
Indochine. Hmm.

614
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:15,806
I'm not sure, but maybe it
can be that thing upstairs

615
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,164
leading up to the tower.

616
01:08:18,733 --> 01:08:21,435
- What thing upstairs?
- I'm not sure what it's for,

617
01:08:21,468 --> 01:08:23,838
but it seems to be very
important.

618
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:25,740
I can show you.
Yeah.

619
01:08:46,661 --> 01:08:48,730
- Is this what you mean?
- Ah.

620
01:08:48,763 --> 01:08:50,364
Look like some sort of map.

621
01:08:50,397 --> 01:08:52,600
Or a set of instructions of
some sort.

622
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:55,937
What about the lights
and the rays coming out?

623
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:58,205
It's the light of truth.

624
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,642
"When the seal of God is broken,

625
01:09:00,675 --> 01:09:04,712
the light of truth will
ignite and reveal itself.

626
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:06,748
To the true believer."

627
01:10:11,445 --> 01:10:14,247
Ramirez, you okay? We heard
the shots.

628
01:10:14,281 --> 01:10:15,315
Everything all right?

629
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:18,686
Gordon,

630
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,923
you're going to have to
continue the mission without me.

631
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:23,891
Ramirez, are you okay?

632
01:10:23,925 --> 01:10:27,662
Don't worry, Gordon.
I've got you covered.

633
01:10:34,836 --> 01:10:37,572
Roger that, Ramirez. Roger
that.

634
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:44,912
Ah, Neo-Chrome's on the
mainframe.

635
01:10:44,946 --> 01:10:46,313
That's some serious trouble.

636
01:10:46,346 --> 01:10:48,448
I think Ramirez is out.

637
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:52,319
I'm sorry to hear that, Gordon.

638
01:10:52,352 --> 01:10:53,688
Let's do her proud, shall we?

639
01:10:55,089 --> 01:10:58,960
"This is a message to
all the true seekers.

640
01:10:58,993 --> 01:11:02,063
The final three letters that
conclude

641
01:11:02,096 --> 01:11:04,297
the account of creation.

642
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:10,738
God created us to do.

643
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:13,508
Together spell the word truth.

644
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:17,310
Truth is everything from
the cradle to the grave

645
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:21,983
Only the righteous child

646
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:25,753
have access to the path of the
Indochine.

647
01:11:25,787 --> 01:11:29,023
Be aware. This message will
self distract after you read it.

648
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:32,527
The righteous man must
answer three questions."

649
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,829
Are you ready for this?

650
01:11:34,862 --> 01:11:36,030
- I'm ready.
- "Question one.

651
01:11:36,063 --> 01:11:40,668
What is on the mind of the
seeker on his quest for truth?"

652
01:11:40,701 --> 01:11:42,469
Honesty and honor.

653
01:11:46,507 --> 01:11:49,309
"The path of the
Indochine has been revealed.

654
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:52,647
Question two.

655
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,050
What is the motivation
of the righteous man?"

656
01:11:59,787 --> 01:12:00,787
True love.

657
01:12:07,028 --> 01:12:11,666
"From the cradle of life,
the Indochine comes alive.

658
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:13,701
Question number three.

659
01:12:13,734 --> 01:12:17,738
What is the ultimate
power of the universe?"

660
01:12:17,772 --> 01:12:20,373
- Uh...
- One more time.

661
01:12:20,407 --> 01:12:25,412
"What is the ultimate
power of the universe?"

662
01:12:31,052 --> 01:12:32,052
Faith.

663
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:37,792
"The grave at the end of life.

664
01:12:37,825 --> 01:12:41,762
The Indochine is lowered into
its place

665
01:12:41,796 --> 01:12:44,999
and it begins the process of
resurrection.

666
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:49,604
The beginning is the end
and the end is the beginning

667
01:12:49,637 --> 01:12:51,706
from the cradle to the grave,

668
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:53,741
and the rest is up to you."

669
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:14,461
He's coming and he's very
hungry.

670
01:13:15,897 --> 01:13:18,532
- Who's coming?
- The shark.

671
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:23,671
Don't worry, little princess.

672
01:13:23,704 --> 01:13:25,405
There are no sharks around here.

673
01:13:26,107 --> 01:13:27,474
Are you sure?

674
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:32,779
Who did all this?

675
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:36,183
You did.

676
01:13:36,217 --> 01:13:40,187
You made the entire 3D-S
mainframe universe possible.

677
01:13:40,221 --> 01:13:42,165
Seems like you placed yourself
into your own creation

678
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:43,591
as a little boy.

679
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:49,429
We need to get out of here now.

680
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:56,871
Let's get back to
the elevator. Run, run!

681
01:14:05,913 --> 01:14:07,248
The shark's coming.

682
01:14:44,986 --> 01:14:47,888
Let's go! Let's get in here!

683
01:14:47,922 --> 01:14:49,223
Why don't you go ahead?

684
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:50,725
Go, go, go, go!

685
01:14:55,262 --> 01:14:58,299
Gordon, come on, let's go!

686
01:14:58,332 --> 01:14:59,332
Gordon!

687
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:03,004
Hurry, hurry, Gordon! Come on!

688
01:15:03,037 --> 01:15:04,638
Come on! Let's go!

689
01:15:10,978 --> 01:15:12,580
Sergeant Vargaz?

690
01:15:13,714 --> 01:15:16,617
Sergeant Vargaz, come in.

691
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:18,185
The life sign's gone.

692
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:49,817
Hey, this way.

693
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:05,208
Hope you know where you're
going, kid.

694
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:06,232
This way.

695
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:08,202
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

696
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:11,205
No one's ever been here before.

697
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:14,008
- You designed it.
- I haven't actually yet.

698
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:18,345
This kid's getting smart on us.

699
01:16:20,114 --> 01:16:22,116
Come on. This way, this way.

700
01:16:25,986 --> 01:16:28,756
Hey, Tomlin. I gotta tell you
something.

701
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:35,296
- Hey, what is it?
- Ah.

702
01:16:35,896 --> 01:16:40,334
Look, not, not a lot of
things scare me. You know.

703
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:41,936
Like being married, you know.

704
01:16:45,739 --> 01:16:47,608
That's one of 'em.

705
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:52,847
Tight places, tight, tight
places,

706
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,116
Small places. They scare me.

707
01:16:55,149 --> 01:16:59,286
Small spaces, tight places,
tight places scare me.

708
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,320
You know.

709
01:17:01,822 --> 01:17:03,257
I respect you telling me,
Gordon.

710
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,925
- Yeah.
- But you told me

711
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:07,795
only way to victory is to face
your fears.

712
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:10,965
Take a deep breath, okay.

713
01:17:10,998 --> 01:17:13,067
- Yeah, okay.
- You can do this, buddy.

714
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,235
Yeah, yeah.

715
01:17:15,936 --> 01:17:16,936
Yeah. Okay.

716
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:20,241
Okay.

717
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:32,219
Okay. Move, move, let's go,
move.

718
01:17:32,253 --> 01:17:33,253
Move, kid.

719
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:42,796
What was that?

720
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:49,436
I hope that's not what I think
it is.

721
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:51,472
Oh shit.

722
01:17:51,506 --> 01:17:53,107
The walls.

723
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,441
The walls are moving in!
Crap!

724
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:55,919
Move, move, move!
They're moving in!

725
01:17:55,943 --> 01:17:57,287
- Come on!
- The walls are moving in!

726
01:17:57,311 --> 01:17:59,246
Go, go! Come on!

727
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,816
Go, go!

728
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:13,127
Come on, they're closing!
Let's move!

729
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,895
Come on, move, move!

730
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:18,765
Go!

731
01:18:20,267 --> 01:18:22,836
Get out of here! All of you,
move!

732
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:26,373
Get out of here!
Here we go!

733
01:18:26,407 --> 01:18:27,374
Come on!
I can't hold it!

734
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:29,743
Come on! Give me your hand!

735
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:32,079
Come on. Give me your hand,
Gordon!

736
01:18:32,112 --> 01:18:34,481
Minnesota, help me!

737
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:40,487
Come on!

738
01:18:40,522 --> 01:18:41,522
Come on!

739
01:18:42,524 --> 01:18:44,158
You get out of here. I can't
hold it!

740
01:18:44,191 --> 01:18:46,260
I'll hold it for you!

741
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:51,899
Goddamn!

742
01:18:51,932 --> 01:18:56,337
It's too late.

743
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,938
Goddamn toothpick.

744
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:03,043
You save private Hendy.

745
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:10,484
You save private Hendy for me.

746
01:19:10,518 --> 01:19:12,786
No!

747
01:19:18,959 --> 01:19:19,959
Dammit!

748
01:19:30,371 --> 01:19:33,440
Gordon was a good man, Tomlin.

749
01:19:33,474 --> 01:19:35,042
He was a good man.

750
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,078
I'm all right. Okay.

751
01:19:39,913 --> 01:19:40,913
It's okay.

752
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:53,860
Hey.

753
01:19:56,096 --> 01:19:57,096
It's this way.

754
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,135
That's what the hieroglyphics
showed.

755
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:36,837
This must be the cradle of life.

756
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,241
That's where the Indochine is.

757
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:43,377
Look, I'll be right back.

758
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:45,513
You guys stay right here. Okay?

759
01:20:45,547 --> 01:20:48,282
You never know what might be out
there.

760
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:49,315
Hey.

761
01:20:50,384 --> 01:20:52,252
Be careful. All right?

762
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:23,518
That's some big light bulb.

763
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:44,938
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

764
01:21:44,972 --> 01:21:46,273
Tomlin! Tomlin!

765
01:21:46,306 --> 01:21:48,308
Tomlin, oh my God!

766
01:21:48,342 --> 01:21:49,544
Tomlin, come on, we gotta go!

767
01:21:49,577 --> 01:21:50,612
The walls are falling!

768
01:21:50,645 --> 01:21:53,313
Come on, Tomlin! Hurry, Tomlin!

769
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:56,416
Let's go!

770
01:21:59,987 --> 01:22:03,023
Tomlin, Tomlin, Tomlin! Oh my
God, Tomlin!

771
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:13,967
Well,

772
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:15,513
it looks like you guys
are gonna have to finish

773
01:22:15,537 --> 01:22:16,538
this one without me.

774
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:20,642
You did good, Minnesota.
You did real good.

775
01:22:21,408 --> 01:22:24,679
Thank you.
Hey Tomlin, listen to me.

776
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:28,550
You don't let her go. Okay?

777
01:22:32,419 --> 01:22:34,354
I promise. I promise.

778
01:22:36,758 --> 01:22:38,425
Good.

779
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,995
Hey you guys, look out,
Neo-Chromes!

780
01:22:42,029 --> 01:22:45,132
Get out of here, get out of
here, go, go, go, go, go!

781
01:22:45,165 --> 01:22:47,267
Hurry, Tomlin! To your left!

782
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:49,503
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

783
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,425
Minnesota!

784
01:23:23,136 --> 01:23:24,539
Come on. Let's go.

785
01:23:25,472 --> 01:23:27,307
Let's go, let's go.

786
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:28,341
Okay.

787
01:23:33,213 --> 01:23:34,616
Keep going. Don't look back.

788
01:23:34,649 --> 01:23:36,283
Where does this lead to?

789
01:23:36,316 --> 01:23:37,417
You tell me.

790
01:23:49,496 --> 01:23:50,496
We made it.

791
01:23:54,334 --> 01:23:55,603
That's the elevator below us.

792
01:23:58,105 --> 01:23:59,105
Smart kid.

793
01:23:59,707 --> 01:24:01,241
Where are we going?

794
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:03,143
Well, according to your own
program,

795
01:24:03,176 --> 01:24:04,454
we're going to the top of the
tower.

796
01:24:04,478 --> 01:24:05,478
Hold on.

797
01:24:06,814 --> 01:24:08,650
Hold on tight.
All right.

798
01:24:13,688 --> 01:24:14,756
Ready?
Yeah.

799
01:24:17,725 --> 01:24:22,730
Whoa!

800
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,108
All right, kid?
I think so.

801
01:24:35,142 --> 01:24:37,144
- You sure?
- Yeah.

802
01:24:55,228 --> 01:24:56,698
The grave at the end of life.

803
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:00,266
That's it.

804
01:25:01,536 --> 01:25:05,138
The end of all things, I
guess. Huh.

805
01:25:11,211 --> 01:25:12,580
From the cradle to the grave.

806
01:25:32,634 --> 01:25:33,634
Emily?

807
01:25:43,377 --> 01:25:44,377
Emily?

808
01:25:59,594 --> 01:26:01,929
Not gonna screw up
anything by doing this, kid?

809
01:26:06,299 --> 01:26:07,802
I guess we'll have to find out.

810
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:12,874
Rest is up to you.

811
01:26:18,445 --> 01:26:20,515
Thanks for your help, kid.

812
01:26:20,548 --> 01:26:21,649
Thanks for everything.

813
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:24,384
We couldn't have done it without
you.

814
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:31,458
I hope you save Melanie.

815
01:26:33,828 --> 01:26:36,698
The end is the beginning.
The beginning is the end.

816
01:26:36,731 --> 01:26:39,299
The end is the beginning.
The end is the resurrection.

817
01:26:39,332 --> 01:26:42,770
The light of truth is
the re-birth of life.

818
01:27:00,988 --> 01:27:04,559
Go. From the cradle to the
grave.

819
01:27:04,592 --> 01:27:06,592
The beginning is the end.
The end is the beginning.

820
01:27:13,366 --> 01:27:16,303
It is the cradle of life and
death.

821
01:27:19,974 --> 01:27:22,810
Go for it.

822
01:27:22,844 --> 01:27:24,311
Put it in the cradle!

823
01:27:29,817 --> 01:27:30,817
You did it.

824
01:27:38,092 --> 01:27:39,092
It's working.

825
01:27:41,394 --> 01:27:43,698
You have no idea who
you're messing with.

826
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:45,633
I will kill you.

827
01:27:48,903 --> 01:27:52,540
We're through here. Kill them.

828
01:27:52,573 --> 01:27:53,875
Kill them both now.

829
01:31:01,228 --> 01:31:04,065
Mr. Tomlin, I don't know what
to say,

830
01:31:04,098 --> 01:31:05,733
but a miracle has happened.

831
01:31:05,766 --> 01:31:09,170
Not only has the virus
been stopped and defeated,

832
01:31:09,203 --> 01:31:11,572
it's been completely eradicated.

833
01:31:11,605 --> 01:31:14,275
Why don't you come down to the
hospital as soon as you can?

834
01:31:14,308 --> 01:31:15,643
Hey sweetie.

835
01:32:22,343 --> 01:32:23,677
Hey, sweetie.

836
01:32:24,345 --> 01:32:25,980
I Love you, Melanie.

837
01:32:26,013 --> 01:32:27,214
I love you too.
