1
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:49,587
- Is that you mom?

2
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:50,868
- Who else would it be?

3
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,418
- Just making sure.

4
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,088
- What have I told you about
keeping that door locked?

5
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,278
Some psycho could come wandering in here.

6
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,908
- Pretty sure one just did.

7
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,698
- Stop it, I'll show
you how psycho I can be.

8
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,178
- Oh, I know.

9
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,158
- So what are you getting
all dolled up for?

10
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,468
I thought we were gonna stay
at home and eat Halloween candy

11
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,368
and watch scary movies.

12
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,018
You know, our usual tradition?

13
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,948
- Yeah Well, Sage wants to
go out tonight with them.

14
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,838
- Them? who's them?

15
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,678
- Just Sage.

16
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,068
- And I suppose Kyle and Riley

17
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,343
will be there too?

18
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,218
- Yeah.

19
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,228
- Mm-hmm. So what are
you gonna do tonight?

20
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,208
- We don't know yet, it's Halloween,

21
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,758
so there's lots of stuff to do.

22
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,878
- Which means all the
crazies are gonna be out.

23
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,368
- Just like every other night.

24
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,708
- Just be careful.

25
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,978
- We will, don't worry.

26
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,378
- And no drinking.

27
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,528
- We're not gonna drink.

28
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,278
- Alex, give me a little bit of credit.

29
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,208
I was not born yesterday.

30
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,168
- I promise there'll be no drinking.

31
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,146
- Okay. And I want you home at 12.

32
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:48,398
- 12? On Halloween?

33
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,025
Can't I stay out a little later than that?

34
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:51,108
- No, 12.

35
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,068
Take it or leave it, Alex.

36
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,428
- Fine.

37
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,178
- Yes. I will save you some candy

38
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,988
and we'll watch a movie when you get home.

39
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,268
- All right. Sounds good.

40
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,158
- All right. Good girl.

41
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,298
Well, you have fun.

42
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,958
And don't do anything crazy.

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,158
- Something crazy?

44
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,158
What do you think I'm gonna do?

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,378
Raise the dead.

46
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,078
- Well, if you do something like that,

47
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,498
you're definitely grounded.

48
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,149
Now go on, get outta here.

49
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:12,982
- Okay, bye.

50
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:15,748
- Oh, honey, you're a big girl.

51
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,018
And you tell everyone when I said hello.

52
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,851
- I will.

53
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:18,890
- All right.

54
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,723
My hands down.

55
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:20,556
- Bye mom.

56
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:21,389
- Bye baby.

57
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,638
Have fun.

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,268
See y'all.

59
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,113
I'll just eat the candy myself.

60
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,558
Not all of it.

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,393
Most of it.

62
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,063
I'll save you one, two, punishment.

63
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,748
- Where are we going?

64
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,828
- To the lame ass fairgrounds.

65
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,958
- Wait, why are we going
to the fairgrounds?

66
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,418
- Cause, Riley claims it's haunted.

67
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,428
Some stupid shit like that.

68
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,168
- It is haunted.

69
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,483
- Okay man, whatever you say.

70
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,418
I think you're full of shit though.

71
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,968
- Look, I don't care what you think.

72
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,468
I've heard all sorts of
goofy shit about this place.

73
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,301
- Me too.

74
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:00,818
- There was a carnival
here back in the day.

75
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,128
And one night a girl got killed on a ride

76
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,408
when it fucked up.

77
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,900
- It was the electric swings, right?

78
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:07,376
That's what my said.

79
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:09,658
- Right. she
was the one that came loose

80
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,298
and it threw her ass halfway
across the.

81
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,558
It broke most of the bones
in her body when it landed.

82
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,388
Hella people say they
still see a ghost wandering

83
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,388
around up in it.

84
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,242
- My cousin said that he saw
her when he was a little kid.

85
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:21,138
Really creeped him out.

86
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,558
- Yeah. And would that be
your same cousin that claims

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,868
he saw Bigfoot jerking
off in the woods behind

88
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,848
his house that one time?

89
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,948
Hell, that's a reliable source.

90
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,208
- Fuck you.

91
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,308
- Then there's the whole
thing with the knife door.

92
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,528
Like apparently he got a little
too drunk one night before

93
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,418
his planted
a knife right in between

94
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,648
his assistant's eyes.

95
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,388
- Let me guess, her
ghost supposedly haunts

96
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,858
the place too, right?

97
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,968
- His too, actually.

98
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,638
He was so upset about the whole thing

99
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,108
that he blew his fucking brains out

100
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,010
in the trailer before the cops showed up.

101
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:52,138
- Are you listening to this shit?

102
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,948
- Look, I don't
you believe me or not.

103
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,511
I'm just saying there's a
ton of cool stories about

104
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:57,838
this place and it might be
awesome to check it out.

105
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,448
Especially tonight

106
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,518
- You don't really think

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,788
we're gonna see a ghost
or something, do you?

108
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,878
- I don't know, maybe.

109
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,831
Stranger things have happened.

110
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,500
- Creepy.

111
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,903
- Check that out.

112
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,030
- That's fucked up.

113
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,648
- Give me a break.

114
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,164
What did you two come out here earlier

115
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,718
and set this up to try and scare us?

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,838
It's not working.

117
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,628
- We had nothing to do with this.

118
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,823
- Of course you didn't.

119
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,838
- Wanna go check it out?

120
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,005
- Yeah, let's go.

121
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:58,998
- All right.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,833
- I don't know.

123
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,181
- Y'all coming or what?

124
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:05,138
- Come on. This is stupid.

125
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,971
Let's get outta here.

126
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:07,653
There's gotta be something better to do.

127
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,618
Come on Sage.

128
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,828
Let's go check this out and
get it over with so we can get

129
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,053
the hell outta here, all right?

130
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,658
- Okay.

131
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,398
- Yo, you're scared, ain't you?

132
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,498
Little bitch.

133
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,483
- Fuck no.

134
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,160
I am worried we might die of boredom.

135
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,973
Let's go.

136
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,818
- You don't really expect
us to go in there, do you?

137
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,587
- Come on, don't punk out.

138
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:32,635
It's gonna be fun.

139
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:34,155
We're already here.

140
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,397
- Oh,

141
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,109
- I'm not going in after him.

142
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:43,671
Hey, come on.

143
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,160
- Yo, Riley, Reggie, how?

144
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:05,588
- It's like an adventure man.

145
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,590
Check out new stuff.

146
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,312
- It looks like good will.

147
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:11,868
- So you should feel right at home.

148
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,536
- Oh, hey Riley, look
it's your ex-girlfriend.

149
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:15,810
Huh, wow.

150
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:22,170
Is there a light switch in here?

151
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:24,859
Gotta get a switch.

152
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:01,445
Dude.

153
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,728
- Fascinating.

154
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,561
- Yeah, yeah.

155
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,396
Can we go now?

156
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:40,978
- Come on man, let's check
some of this stuff out.

157
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,104
- Dude, why? There's nothing in here?

158
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:45,808
It's just a fucking old ass warehouse.

159
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,536
- Right, think
that's what it looks like.

160
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,369
I can hear it.

161
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:49,202
Check this out

162
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:50,690
- Now he's going through shit.

163
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,343
Not surprised.

164
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,530
- Yeah. Nothing here he says.

165
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,478
- Babe, how do I look?

166
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,058
- Like a moron, as usual.

167
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,498
- So fucking funny.

168
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,443
- Typical Riley.

169
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,288
- I wonder why all this stuff is here.

170
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,348
- Maybe it's fidget stuff.

171
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,088
- What the fuck's a fidget.

172
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,998
- He was the midget clown that
used to work at the carnival.

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,978
They had him in the
dunking booth and stuff.

174
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,115
- Used to insult the people
that tried to dunk him.

175
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:23,548
One day, he pissed off
a bunch of rednecks.

176
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,058
Went a little too far.

177
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,698
- What happened to him?

178
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,708
- Things didn't work out too well for him.

179
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,768
Pretty sure they beat him up and hung him.

180
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,668
- Something like that.

181
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,583
- Actually they beat him
profusely and set him on fire.

182
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,608
Poor little guy.

183
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,808
With his dying breath,

184
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,028
he vowed to one day of return
and make those responsible

185
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,648
for what happened to him pay.

186
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,606
Perhaps tonight will be that night.

187
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:48,788
- Yo, who the fuck are you?

188
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,048
- Ah, forgive my manners.

189
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,928
I am Bogo the Magnificent,

190
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,427
but you can call me The Ring Master.

191
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,031
- So what are you doing here?

192
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,118
Setting up a carnival or something?

193
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,068
- Something like that.

194
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,008
The others will be here shortly,

195
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,011
but until then I will
be glad to be your host.

196
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:09,844
- For what?

197
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:11,778
- For the wonderful tales
I'm about to tell you.

198
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,028
Please join me, make
yourselves comfortable.

199
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,378
- Great, fucking story time!

200
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,968
Yeah. Wonderful.

201
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,968
Thanks a lot Riley.

202
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,942
Now I could be at Nina
Bloomfield Halloween party

203
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:25,578
right now getting drunk.

204
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,228
But instead we're here doing this shit

205
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,578
with this fucking clown.

206
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,758
- Her parties are the same every year.

207
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,278
They're like super trash.

208
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,198
- Oh, I think you'll enjoy them.

209
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,998
For they're not just any stories

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,808
and not for the faint of heart,

211
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,668
but ones that I have gathered
around my many travels around

212
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,828
this magnificent country of ours.

213
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,931
- So, what's with the box?

214
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:48,638
- What we have here are certain artifacts

215
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,878
that are connected to each
story I'm about to tell you.

216
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,848
- Oh awesome, he's a prop comic.

217
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,578
Just what we need.

218
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,538
Well, hopefully he's
better than Carrot Top.

219
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,763
- The stories I have for
you are not exactly funny,

220
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,588
though I guess one with
a twisted sense of humor

221
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,718
might find them as such.

222
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,678
No, these stories are guaranteed to grant

223
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,708
you many sleepless nights.

224
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,858
- Sure they are.

225
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,628
- Now please, make yourselves comfortable

226
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,730
and we'll get started.

227
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,713
This particular item belonged to a fellow

228
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:26,293
that came from a town, not like your own.

229
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,820
You're free to take a look at it.

230
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,128
- Is that blood?

231
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:32,963
- Indeed it is.

232
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,678
- So what's the good news?

233
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,668
- Wish I had some,

234
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,513
they discovered another
body a couple of hours ago.

235
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,173
- Jesus.

236
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:53,488
This one was 19 years old.

237
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,558
She had her whole life ahead of her.

238
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,413
- I know.

239
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,518
Her parents reported
her missing last week.

240
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,928
We were hoping it was gonna
be another runaway situation,

241
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,053
but obviously that's not the case.

242
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,208
- What did the sheriff say this time?

243
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,041
- Not much.

244
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,868
He's still can convinced
that these murders

245
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,213
and disappearances aren't connected.

246
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:17,198
- And what's your opinion on the subject?

247
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,408
- That he's a fucking idiot.

248
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,071
I mean, anyone with half a brain can see

249
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:23,085
that they're linked somehow, you know,

250
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,938
but he's one of those backwards,

251
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,928
everyone's related, sheriffs.

252
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,428
I'm not surprised by any of the way

253
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,722
he's handling it right now.

254
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:32,684
- I mean, it's his town.

255
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:35,638
I mean, you would think he
would know better than anyone.

256
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,958
- I think he's covering for someone,

257
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,743
maybe even involved himself.

258
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:41,750
- I think somebody's been watching

259
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:44,050
a few too many conspiracy
videos on YouTube.

260
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:47,928
- Maybe. I just think it's odd.

261
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,118
You know, his behavior,

262
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,358
it's raising more than a few
red flags that he doesn't seem

263
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,198
at all concerned that several
people in his jurisdiction

264
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,558
have gone missing or just plain
dead in the last year or so.

265
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,948
- Now that sounds like a woman

266
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,423
who has some pretty severe trust issues.

267
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,988
- I can't argue with you there.

268
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,398
Hey, who did you send out?

269
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,858
- Culver and Skies.

270
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,858
They left early this morning
and should be arriving anytime.

271
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,948
I'm hoping to hear from
them any minute now.

272
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,100
- Just the two of them.

273
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:19,208
- They're the best we've got.

274
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,988
- Well, I agree with you on that,

275
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,138
but do you think that
that was a wise decision?

276
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,580
- They can take care of themselves.

277
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:27,658
- I'm not saying that they can't,

278
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,158
but we don't really know
what's going on out there.

279
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,308
If they get into trouble
and we need to send help,

280
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,688
it could take hours.

281
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,028
We could be putting them and
more potential victims at risk.

282
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,208
- Allison, they have the
cooperation of the sheriff,

283
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,748
as well as his.

284
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,468
- Unless they're in on it.

285
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,303
- Enough!

286
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,608
Look, once they find out what's going on,

287
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,218
and they will,

288
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,818
we can send agents out at that point.

289
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,568
We're already short staffed
as it is due to the cutbacks.

290
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,988
There is no sense in
sending our people out there

291
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,788
for a wild goose chase
until we know exactly

292
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,003
what we're dealing with.

293
00:17:04,914 --> 00:17:08,293
- Okay. I see your point.

294
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,338
Listen, off the record,

295
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,235
what do you really think
is happening out there?

296
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:15,313
- I have my theories.

297
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,810
- Care to share them.

298
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,593
- Not particularly, no.

299
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:23,804
- May I ask why not?

300
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,318
- May I be frank?

301
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,508
- Of course.

302
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,598
- In all honesty, it's
above your pay grade.

303
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,208
You have the uncanny ability
to consistently forget

304
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,778
who's in charge here.

305
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,453
So a reminder, it's me,

306
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,288
and I don't appreciate
being constantly questioned

307
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,058
about my decisions.

308
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,478
Bottom line, I'm your superior officer.

309
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,328
If you don't like it,

310
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,668
you are more than welcome
to put in a transfer.

311
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,788
Hell, I'll write you a
letter of recommendation.

312
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,288
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I have work to do.

313
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,068
Not all of us have the luxury
of crying Chicken Little

314
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,263
every time they believe
the sky is falling.

315
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:05,576
- Right.

316
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,753
Why don't I let you get at it.

317
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,473

318
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,800

One guy out here to the county

went missing in the last year.

349

Seven of them turned up
dead and he didn't do shit.

00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,974
- It is.

362
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,633
- Yeah. This would be
a good place to live.

363
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:48,423
Well, if it wasn't
a psychotic killer?

364
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,404
- Exactly the thing that will
drive down property value.

365
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:53,729
- Right?

367
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:02,045

370
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:07,873
- Here we go.

371
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,113
- That didn't take long.

372
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:10,740
- Please, please stop.

373
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:12,348
Please, you've gotta help me.

374
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,278
My sister, she's been taken,

375
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,763
three men took her, please.

376
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,087
- Did you see where they took her?

377
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:20,068
- Oh, I think so.

378
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,518
- Okay. Relax.

379
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,415
Hop in the back seat, okay?

380
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:24,317
- Okay. Thank you.

381
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,718
There, she's in there.

382
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,100
Please. Please go save my sister.

383
00:22:47,102 --> 00:22:48,138
- Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

384
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,143
Calm down, just try to relax, all right.

385
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:53,918
We're gonna do everything
we can to help your sister.

386
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,158
Just stay here with the car.

387
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,914
And we'll be right back, okay?

388
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:58,747
- Okay.

389
00:22:58,749 --> 00:22:59,582
- Okay.

390
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:05,737
We'll be back.

391
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,210
Do you believe her?

392
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,310
Think she's on the level?

393
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:02,419
- I have no idea.

394
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,238
- We can walk into a set up.

395
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,631
- Yeah, maybe.

396
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:13,113
But the fact is, if
she's telling the truth,

397
00:24:14,373 --> 00:24:15,251
I mean, somebody's getting murdered

398
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,471
in this right now

399
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:19,677
and we have no choice but to check it out.

400
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:29,545
- Help!

401
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:33,839
Somebody, help!

402
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:49,899
Help!

403
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:53,989
Leave me alone!

404
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:54,824
Please.

405
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,632
- I'm going round to the other side.

406
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:01,465
- Okay.

407
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,908
- When you see me busting over there.

408
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,741
- Okay.

409
00:25:03,743 --> 00:25:04,574
- You bust in over here, okay.

410
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:05,409
- All right. Got it.

411
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:19,417
- Please, please don't do this.

412
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,291
- I told you to stay in the car.

413
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,623
I could have shot you.

414
00:26:09,064 --> 00:26:11,211
- Where'd your sister go?

415
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,432
- Help!

416
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:38,768
- Folks, you come with me.

417
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,502
Phil, you stay here.

418
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:02,806
- Somebody, please help me!

419
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:05,696
Anybody!

420
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,835
I just need help.

421
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:10,909
Please.

422
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:15,949
Please.

423
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:20,347
- Put the weapon down and put
your hands in the air now!

424
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:46,787
- Hey. Can you understand me?

425
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:47,622
- Yeah.

426
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,690
- Can you walk?

427
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:57,910
- Who are you?

428
00:27:57,912 --> 00:27:59,088
- Chris, my name is Chris.

429
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,128
- My name is Kelly.

430
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,175
- Kelly, it's nice to meet you,

431
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:02,375
but right now it's not the best time

432
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:03,648
for a formal introduction.

433
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,138
- Those men, they want to kill me.

434
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,233
- Really? No shit!

435
00:28:10,594 --> 00:28:11,962
We need to run.

436
00:28:11,964 --> 00:28:13,078
All right, what I'm gonna do is,

437
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,468
I'm gonna lay some fire down, all right.

438
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,807
My car's upfront.

439
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:17,545
All right, this is what you do,

440
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:18,378
I'll lay down fire.

441
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,211
You slip through the woods.

442
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,088
You keep going north, all right?

443
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,688
Keep going until you see the main road.

444
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,738
Once you see the main road, you stop.

445
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,658
Don't flag anybody down until
you know it's absolutely safe.

446
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,110
Stay out of sight, all right?

447
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,898
- Why are you doing this?

448
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,068
Those men, they have no interest in you.

449
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,908
I'm the one they want.

450
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,672
Why would you sacrifice
your for me?

451
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,398
You don't even know me or
why they're doing this.

452
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,546
They may have a good
reason for wanting me dead.

453
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:45,858
- It doesn't matter if they
have a good reason or not.

454
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,518
It doesn't give them the right to torture

455
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,318
and kill anybody, you understand?

456
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,708
I need you to go, okay.

457
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,737
You can run, right?

458
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:52,570
- You're gonna get hurt.

459
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:53,403
- It doesn't matter.

460
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:54,236
Don't worry about me.

461
00:28:54,238 --> 00:28:55,555
Listen, can you run?

462
00:28:55,557 --> 00:28:57,288
All right. I need you to get outta here.

463
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,038
You need to go as fast as possible.

464
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,933
Run. Just go, please go.

465
00:29:28,756 --> 00:29:30,598
All right Bob,

466
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,994
let's do this.

467
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:07,657
Do it!

468
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,458
What the fuck are you waiting for?

469
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,960
Just fucking kill me, come on.

470
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:16,508
You not going to find her.

471
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,468
She is fucking miles away.

472
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,353
She is gone.

473
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:24,268
And whatever it is that you

474
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,483
and your fucking goat
fucking friends had going on,

475
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:31,069
it's fucking over!

476
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:37,528
And your buddies,

477
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,633
oh, they got off easy.

478
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,598
Oh, cause Bob,

479
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,003
when they catch up with
you here in this state,

480
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:48,728
oh, they do not take kindly

481
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,513
to people killing
federal fucking officers.

482
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,283
You are going to fucking fry.

483
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,767
You are going to fucking fry!

484
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,672
No! No!

485
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:08,746
What are you doing?

486
00:31:08,748 --> 00:31:11,034
Don't even fucking.

487
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:11,895
No!

488
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:12,730
No! No!

489
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,438
- Kai, you have served me and my son well.

490
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,713
You will be rewarded.

491
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:27,314
- I don't understand, what's going on?

492
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:29,216
I die trying to save you.

493
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:33,061
I'm fucking done!

494
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:35,635
- And you have our gratitude.

495
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:36,970
- Our gratitude?

496
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,798
- Yes. This is my home.

497
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,213
And these are my faithful
and obedient subjects.

498
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:45,352
- I still don't fucking get it.

499
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:47,365
What, who the fuck are you?

500
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,298
- I'm afraid the answer to that question

501
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,228
is beyond your ability to comprehend.

502
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,508
But I could tell you the
story of my people begins long

503
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,028
before the creation of this world.

504
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,593
And now by right, it will be ours to rule.

505
00:32:05,313 --> 00:32:09,202
- Why was killing us fucking necessary?

506
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:13,768
- Because as inferior and inconsequential,

507
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,278
as you, as your people are as a species,

508
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,658
your existence has
threatened our existence.

509
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,337
- What fucking threat are we to you?

510
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,798
- The presence of human beings
on this world was unplanned.

511
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,431
That you evolved at all
is still inexplicable.

512
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,208
And the fact that you are,

513
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,191
threatens our ability to lay claim to it.

514
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:40,943
- What the fuck is you talking...

515
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,173
- What we needed was someone of character,

516
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,593
of strength, of courage,

517
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,968
a hero, a willing sacrifice.

518
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,563
You prove worthy where others failed.

519
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,423
We thank you.

520
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,323
It's time.

521
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,749
- What's going on?

522
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:57,484
What the fuck is...

523
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:02,380
- Finally, the scriptures
have come to pass

524
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,238
and my son shall rule this world

525
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,573
and everyone who resides there in.

526
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,813
- Is it done?

527
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,710
So they've both been taken care of then?

528
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,343
What's that?

529
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,043
dead too.

530
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,193
Well, that's unfortunate, but
not completely unexpected.

531
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,253
And the rebirth was successful.

532
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,118
Wonderful.

533
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,953
Praise him.

534
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,570
You have nothing to worry about
that, I'll take care of it.

535
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,273
Because I'm in charge here
and I know what I'm doing.

536
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,140
I've kept them off your
back this long, haven't I?

537
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,480
Just trust me and do as I say.

538
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,120
Yeah, there's just,

539
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,398
there's just one more last loose end

540
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,800
that I have to take care of.

541
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,062
It's a new world out there because of us.

542
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:33,438
I'll be in touch.

543
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,273
Praise him.

544
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,300
Alison, can you come to my office please?

545
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,178
- You wanted to see me, sir.

546
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,630
- Can you have a seat please?

547
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,738
I wanna start by apologizing
for my actions earlier.

548
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,278
I was completely out of line

549
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,333
and I owe you a tremendous apology.

550
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,438
I should have recognized
your abilities on this case.

551
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,603
And for that, I am truly sorry.

552
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,743
- Well, I appreciate the sentiment, sir.

553
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,648
Do you mind if I ask
where this is coming from?

554
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,300
- We just heard back from Culver.

555
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,378
You were absolutely right.

556
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,958
- They're in on it.

557
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,943
- The sheriff, his men,

558
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,628
and it gets worse.

559
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,038
- How so?

560
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,708
- We have reason to believe that someone

561
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,168
from our own agency is involved.

562
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,408
- Seriously.

563
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,168
- Now, I have to ask,

564
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,818
have you shared your
theories about this case

565
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,958
with anyone else in this office?

566
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,008
- No.

567
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,338
No, absolutely not.

568
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,408
- No phone calls, no emails.

569
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,243
- Nothing.

570
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,173
- Good.

571
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,210
That's really good.

572
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,308
We don't need this leaking out any further

573
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,128
than it already has.

574
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,018
I have already underestimated
your abilities once,

575
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,913
I will not let that happen again.

576
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,868
I'd like you to head up
this case from here on out.

577
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,620
I believe this file belongs to you.

578
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,613
- I appreciate your confidence in me, sir.

579
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,973
How soon do I leave?

580
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,133
- Oh, you'll be going very soon.

581
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,490
- I won't let you down.

582
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:07,531
- Oh, I know you won't.

583
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:08,923
Praise him.

584
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:14,578
- Damn, that's messed up.

585
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,058
- So wait, you're saying
that's a true story.

586
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,688
All that really happened.

587
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,110
- Indeed it did.

588
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:22,818
- I call bullshit.

589
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,028
If that really happened,

590
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,138
then how come the baby
and its freaky ass mother

591
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,748
haven't taken over the world yet?

592
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,608
- Because that time
has not yet come to be.

593
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,419
Be patient my friend.

594
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:35,238
All will happen in due time.

595
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,558
Maybe you'll be one of
the lucky ones spared,

596
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,768
should they find you worthy enough.

597
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,098
- You know what?

598
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,128
I'll mark my calendar for all that.

599
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,468
- I don't think that would be a bad idea.

600
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,618
- Okay. All right.

601
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,878
So can we go now?

602
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,138
I mean, seriously, this is fucking stupid.

603
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,971
- Bro.

604
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:55,618
- No, you guys go ahead and stay.

605
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,668
I'm gonna get another beer.

606
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,246
At least that will bring me up.

607
00:38:58,248 --> 00:38:59,085
- I'll come with you.

608
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,137
- Oh, I bet you will.

609
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,638
- Sit down. Please.

610
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,218
- Don't worry, it never
takes him long anyway.

611
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,913
At least that's what Sage says.

612
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,838
- Huh, well, your mom didn't complain

613
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,258
the other night, so..

614
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,518
- Get some new material.

615
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,918
- Whatever.

616
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,568
Anyways, continue on with your next story,

617
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,918
without a side show, Bob, okay.

618
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,458
We've got better things to do.

619
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,547
And I've.

620
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,020
Come on, babe.

621
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:31,848
- Yo, just don't do it in my car.

622
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,338
- No promises.

623
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,548
- I'm dead ass.

624
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,878
I'm not trying to burn
my back seats later.

625
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,668
- I'm sure we can get along without him.

626
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,743
Now, where was I?

627
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:44,228
Ah, yes.

628
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,453
Here it is.

629
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,378
This belonged to a group of friends

630
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,358
who went on a fishing trip one weekend.

631
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,658
Unfortunately for them,

632
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,397
they got a little more
than they bargained for.

633
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,950
- Oh my God.

634
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,468
- What's your problem?

635
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,996
- Look I don't have any service out here.

636
00:40:05,998 --> 00:40:08,278
- Yeah. We're out in
the middle of nowhere.

637
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,378
What do you expect?

638
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,211
- I know that.

639
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:13,038
It's just, I figured I
would have like something.

640
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,238
- Okay. We came out here to relax.

641
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,533
So, put the phone down,

642
00:40:19,883 --> 00:40:21,138
and relax.

643
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,490
- What have you been doing?

644
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,008
- I'm baking you a cake, honey.

645
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,060
- What are you doing?

646
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:30,198
- Oh my God, I'm building a campfire.

647
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,350
What does it look like?

648
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,968
- Okay. Whatever.

649
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,028
I just don't want McGruff to come out here

650
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,168
and start freaking out about forest fires

651
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,078
and being on drugs.

652
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,838
- What in the fuck are you talking about?

653
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,468
- What? Don't you remember
in like grade school McGruff

654
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,518
would come to our schools
and he would go off

655
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,183
about setting forest
fires and being on drugs.

656
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,188
- Sweetie, McGruff wanted
you to, I don't know,

657
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,490
take a bite out of crying.

658
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,999
Smokey the Bear cared about forest fires.

659
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,128
- Oh, oh yeah.

660
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,593
I totally get them like
confused all the time.

661
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:07,318
- Of course you do.

662
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,648
- Why are you even doing this?

663
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,068
It is hot as hell out here.

664
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,818
- Cause I brought some hot
dogs we can roast later.

665
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,878
- That's nasty.

666
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,258
I don't like hot dogs.

667
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,338
- It's okay, I got marshmallows too.

668
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,428
- Well, I don't like those either.

669
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,208
They look like balls.

670
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,288
- Okay. How about if we
sit around the campfire

671
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,798
and tell ghost stories?

672
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,618
- Oh, I like ghost stories.

673
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,788
You know what my favorite one is?

674
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,308
Oh my God, it's so scary.

675
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,268
It's the guy with the hook for the hand.

676
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,118
It's so scary.

677
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,928
- Sweetie, that's not a ghost story.

678
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,598
That's an urban legend.

679
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,158
- What does that mean?

680
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,160
- See, a ghost story generally
contains one or more ghosts.

681
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,958
That's just a story about a
dude with a hook for a hand.

682
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,791
- Well, I don't care.

683
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:50,688
It was really scary

684
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,108
and my uncle used to tell
it to me all the time,

685
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,668
and I would have like
nightmares for weeks.

686
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,573
- Speaking of scary.

687
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,118
Have you heard about
all the disappearances

688
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,568
around here lately?

689
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,918
- The what?

690
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,318
- There are people who've come out here

691
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,968
and they just disappear without a trace.

692
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,803
- What people?

693
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,218
- Like campers, hikers.

694
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,108
They just come out here

695
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,312
and no one ever sees them again.

696
00:42:15,314 --> 00:42:16,391
- Here?

697
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:17,426
- Yeah.

698
00:42:17,428 --> 00:42:19,218
Right here. These woods.

699
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,693
- Well what happened to them?

700
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,308
- They disappeared without a trace.

701
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,188
So nobody knows what happened to them.

702
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,845
- Well, why would you bring us here then?

703
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,928
- That'd be fun for shits and giggles.

704
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,128
- Well, you're a shit and I don't like it.

705
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,443
It's scary.

706
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,228
- Don't worry, honey.

707
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,098
I'll protect you.

708
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,983
- Well, you can't even start a fire.

709
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,893
I'm sorry.

710
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,818
I love you.

711
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,263
- Yeah. Now you do.

712
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:50,119
Are you a little more relaxed now?

713
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:51,741
- I could be.

714
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:54,178
- A little more relaxed.

715
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,593
- Definitely now.

716
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,798
- I'm sure you do

717
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,218
more relaxed now.

718
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,623
- Oh, I definitely could be.

719
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,300
- What was that?

720
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:15,852
- What was what?

721
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,210
- Oh, didn't you hear that?

722
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,783
- No. What did you hear?

723
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,740
- What if it's the guy with the hook?

724
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,938
- Sweetie, you do know
animals live out here, right?

725
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,957
- Well, what if it's a ghost?

726
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,008
No!

727
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,148
- It's a good thing you're hot.

728
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,983
- Right?

729
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,418
- I'll go check it out, okay.

730
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,748
- No don't go.

731
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,943
- Don't worry.

732
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,308
Look, I'm armed and dangerous, okay.

733
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,477
Be right back.

734
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,048
- You better be.

735
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,683
- I'll be right back.

736
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,423
Hey Mr. Racoon.

737
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,823
Sorry if I have to bludgeon you,

738
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,333
but apparently my
girlfriend's a.

739
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:18,283
And a food snob.

740
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,950
Who doesn't like girl scout cookies?

741
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:29,775
Yeah, just as I suspected, nothing.

742
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:52,261
- Miranda?

743
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:56,820
Where are you?

744
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,818
Okay. I am done with urban ghost legends.

745
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,403
Like I just wanna go home.

746
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,633
Miranda!

747
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:13,993
Fuck this.

748
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,833
Miranda!

749
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,358
Miranda, this is not funny.

750
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,063
I wanna go home.

751
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,032
Miranda?

752
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,203
Miranda?

753
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,818
Miranda, this is not funny.

754
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,562
I wanna go home.

755
00:46:12,692 --> 00:46:13,921
- My sunscreen.

756
00:46:13,923 --> 00:46:16,568
I got my bug spray.

757
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,788
Gotta have my toothbrush.

758
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:20,698
Let's see, I got my..

759
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,018
- Good morning.

760
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,978
- Morning. I got my

761
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,728
- Really? I mean seriously,
do you have everything?

762
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,998
- I think so, babe.

763
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,648
- Because you know, you can't
fit much more in that bag.

764
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,554
- You can never be too prepared, hun.

765
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,458
- Aw, my little boy scout.

766
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,178
You're always so prepared.

767
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,898
- Rather have it than not need it

768
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,388
than need it and not have it, babe.

769
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,068
- Okay. Well, how come
you didn't have condoms

770
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,558
when we were first dating? Hmm.

771
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,618
- Well, because baby, I'm a
allergic to latex, remember?

772
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,918
- I am still trying to
believe you on that one.

773
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,798
- It's true, scout's honor.

774
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,083
- Yeah. Okay, whatever.

775
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,608
- Are you sure you don't wanna go?

776
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,441
- I'm sure.

777
00:46:56,443 --> 00:46:59,608
I mean, I think when we go
camping is not a good idea.

778
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,318
The last time I went was in middle school

779
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,928
and that was a total nightmare.

780
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,363
So I'm perfectly contentious staying home.

781
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,828
- It's not a camping trip,

782
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,498
it's a fishing trip, babe, come on.

783
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,498
- They're the same thing.

784
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,988
Okay. You go to the lake,

785
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,448
you're in a cabin, in the
woods, somewhere scary.

786
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:17,698
And there aren't any people
around for like miles away.

787
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,928
I'd say it's the same exact thing.

788
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:20,928
It's totally different.

789
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,223
It's not the same thing.

790
00:47:23,618 --> 00:47:25,623
It's not the same thing, babe.

791
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,488
Oh, I guess they're here.

792
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:29,321
I'm gonna miss you.

793
00:47:29,323 --> 00:47:30,154
But guess what?

794
00:47:30,156 --> 00:47:30,987
When I get back,

795
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:31,897
you're gonna have the biggest fish fry

796
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:33,738
you've ever seen in your entire life.

797
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,678
- Okay. Yeah.

798
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,858
And I'm gonna go to the market
and get some fish sticks.

799
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,971
Just to, you know, play
it on the safe side.

800
00:47:37,973 --> 00:47:39,108
- All right, babe, I love you.

801
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,571
- I love you too, be careful.

802
00:47:41,573 --> 00:47:42,404
- I will.

803
00:47:42,406 --> 00:47:43,237
- Be safe.

804
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:44,070
- I will.

805
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:45,918
- Come home in one piece.

806
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,751
- Always.

807
00:47:46,753 --> 00:47:47,888
- Okay. Whatever.

808
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,813
I love you, bye.

809
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:02,133
- last night.

810
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:05,508
- Your cousin?

811
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,341
- Oh fuck you.

812
00:48:06,343 --> 00:48:07,567
It wasn't my cousin.

813
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:11,088
- Then who the hell was it?

814
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,918
- Mary Joe Bartlet.

815
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,335
Yeah. You want some?

816
00:48:15,337 --> 00:48:17,250
- Get that shit out of my face.

817
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,168
- Yep. Just jealous.

818
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,541
- Nope. Still don't want
to catch nothing from you.

819
00:48:23,543 --> 00:48:25,308
- Hope you wore two rubbers.

820
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,848
Oh, Mary Joe so nasty,

821
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,758
her crabs have herpes.

822
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,344
- Finger-licking good.

823
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,628
- No talking about work, right?

824
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,888
We're here to fish.

825
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:57,952
We're here to fucking party.

826
00:48:57,954 --> 00:48:58,785
have some fun.

827
00:48:58,787 --> 00:48:59,618
Get whatever you guys want.

This is some place here, isn't it?

835
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,615
- Hey my man.

836
00:49:18,617 --> 00:49:19,728
How's the fish biting today?

837
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:20,934
- Wouldn't know.

838
00:49:20,936 --> 00:49:21,767
Been here all day working.

- It doesn't matter.

848
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:36,888
That place has been fished out for years.

849
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,721
Just worms.

- Yeah. Real generous guy.

869
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,228
- What are you doing here?

870
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,048
I told you to stay the
hell away from here.

871
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,498

- I just wanna apologize
for Mr. Sunshine in there.

I'm Edgar.

- Hey Edgar, Howie, Randy and John.

881
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,621
Nice to meet you.

00:50:36,623 --> 00:50:37,454
- How you doing?

- Hey, did I hear you guys were planning

884
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,958
on going fishing up at Axtell?

885
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,791
- That's right.

886
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:43,498
- You might wanna listen to Mr. Sunshine,

887
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,448
'cause yeah, that place been fished out

888
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,098
for a couple years now.

889
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,931
- Oh, really?

890
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:49,748
- Oh yeah. It's empty.

891
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,568
I do know a better place though.

892
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:52,898
- Where's that?

893
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,458
- It's called Cove Ran.

894
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,378
I fish some great
outta there about a week ago.

895
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,288
Place is so stocked, fish
would be jumping in your net.

896
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,598
- Yeah. But the only thing
is, it's private property.

897
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,431
- Yeah, it is.

898
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:04,648
It's my sister's place.

899
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,798
I was planning on doing some
fishing up there myself.

900
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,648
Your boys are welcome to tag along.

901
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:09,624
- You know what? I appreciate.

902
00:51:09,626 --> 00:51:11,268
But we already gotta place
a cabin out in Axtell.

903
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,508
- I hate to inform you boys,

904
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,898
but those cabins got
bulldozed a few months ago

905
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,338
to make room for a new titty bar.

906
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,171
- What?

907
00:51:17,173 --> 00:51:18,004
- A titty bar?

908
00:51:18,006 --> 00:51:18,837
- I knew we should have
called ahead of time.

909
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:20,608
What are we supposed to do now?

910
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,388
Go camping out in the
woods without a tent?

911
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,358
- Fuck that.

912
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,928
- Well, my sister's got a cabin up there.

913
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,628
Y'all welcome to sack
out there and no charge

914
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,978
since you're in a little bit of a pickle.

915
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,548
- I don't know. What do you guys think?

916
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,548
- Sounds fine to me.

917
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,738
- It's not like we got any choice.

918
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,278
- So what's verdict boys?

919
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,148
- Guess we'll take you up on your offer.

920
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,109
Certainly appreciate it.

921
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:40,942
- You welcome.

922
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:41,958
All right, well just follow me up.

923
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,338
It's just up the road a piece.

924
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,173
- Let's go.

925
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,908
- Finally we get here.

926
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,808
- Thought he said it was just up the road.

927
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,588
- Yeah. About an hour up the road.

928
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,423
- Oh man.

929
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:51,413
- This is it guys.

930
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,568
- Well boys, I'm gonna
head on down to the lake.

931
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,838
Y'all are welcome to a company me

932
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,308
or you wanna get yourself
situated in the cabin,

933
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,598
get your stuff in there.

934
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,738
Door's unlocked.

935
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,688
Help yourself.

936
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:03,068
- I'm ready to do some fishing now.

937
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:03,901
- Yep.

938
00:53:03,903 --> 00:53:04,872
- You know what guys?

939
00:53:04,874 --> 00:53:05,808
I don't think it's a good idea to leave

940
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:06,778
our stuff in the car.

941
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,078
Let's take our stuff in first.

942
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,438
- You take it in man, I'm going fishing.

943
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,271
- Oh, hell yes!

944
00:53:11,273 --> 00:53:12,258
- Yes.

945
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,868
- There's a path just behind the cabin,

946
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,828
lake's just a little ways down the path.

947
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,730
You can't miss it.

948
00:53:18,276 --> 00:53:19,107
- Just behind the cabin.

949
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:20,768
- Yeah, just five or six miles.

950
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,653
- Yeah. Right?

951
00:53:23,627 --> 00:53:25,264
- , huh guys?

952
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:26,228
- Guess so.

953
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,108
- Thanks a lot.

954
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,018
- Here, take this,

955
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,488
by time you get down there it'll be dark.

956
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,441
See you in a bit.

957
00:53:30,443 --> 00:53:31,274
- Thank you.

958
00:53:31,276 --> 00:53:32,408
And don't forget,

959
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,568
we're all counting on you.

960
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,703
- Don't forget my tip.

961
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,664
- Jeez, some friends they are.

962
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:05,934
- What the..

963
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:23,228
- What was that?

964
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:24,408
- We got a lot of birds out here,

965
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:27,354
make some pretty in interesting noises.

966
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,268
- Jesus Christ, man!

967
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,198
Are we almost there or what?

968
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,138
- Yeah. And if I known we're
gonna be blare witching it out

969
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,928
in this bitch, I would've
brought a machete with me

970
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:44,761
to clear the way.

971
00:54:44,763 --> 00:54:45,858
- Right?

972
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,078
- We're almost there boys.

973
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,818
It's just a up yonder a piece.

974
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,677
- Oh, just up yonder a piece now.

975
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:52,098
- Just up yonder a piece.

976
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,604
- Come on.

977
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,288
- Pretty cool, huh?

978
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,248
- Very cool.

979
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,188
- Yeah.

980
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,508
- And hanging out with
you guys is worth it.

981
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,328
- It was a long trip, but we made it.

982
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:12,168
- You boys here to catch
fish or scare fish?

983
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,268
- Ah, the fish can't hear above water.

984
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:15,648
Don't worry about it.

985
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:16,481
Hey, you know what though?

986
00:57:16,483 --> 00:57:18,223
Howie should have been back by now.

987
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:20,010
It's been a while.

988
00:57:20,012 --> 00:57:21,338
- Who cares about Howie?

989
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,948
Why do we even bring him along?

990
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,298
He's not even drunk yet and he's already

991
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,618
a big pain in the ass.

992
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,481
- He's been up there a while.

993
00:57:26,483 --> 00:57:28,378
I think I'm gonna go get him.

994
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,211
- You do what you want.

995
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:30,488
I'm staying right here.

996
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:32,528
- I don't think you want
to head up there alone.

997
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,098
These trails can get pretty tricky.

998
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,118
Especially with it
starting to get dark soon.

999
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,075
I'll come up with you.

1000
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:38,748
You watch my pole?

1001
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,377
- Yeah, sure. All day.

1002
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:42,626
- We'll be back.

1003
00:57:42,628 --> 00:57:43,459
- Come on, let's go.

1004
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:44,447
- See you guys when you get back,

1005
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:46,840
I gotta take a piss.

1006
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:07,961
♪ River ♪

1007
00:58:07,963 --> 00:58:11,291
♪ Wider than a ♪

1008
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,743
- What the hell!

1009
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,338
Looks like somebody got murdered.

1010
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,173
- Somebody did.

1011
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:47,849
- What the fuck?

1012
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:48,990
- I'm sorry.

1013
00:59:48,992 --> 00:59:53,992
I really am.

1014
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,791
- You killed Howie!

1015
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:03,378
You fucking killed all of them!

1016
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,438
- I didn't kill anybody, she did.

1017
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,978
- What you talking about you sick fuck?

1018
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,973
Who's she?

1019
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,428
- Look, I had to bring
everybody here, all right.

1020
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,428
I had to let her eat.

1021
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:17,278
I couldn't just let her starve.

1022
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,778
- Well, come on, relax man.

1023
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,698
- It's not her fault either.

1024
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,889
It's that thing that bit her that night.

1025
01:00:22,891 --> 01:00:24,316
- What thing?

1026
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:25,618
- I don't know what the hell it was,

1027
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,708
something out in the woods.

1028
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,898
Ever since it bit her,
she's been like this.

1029
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,278
I couldn't just leave her.

1030
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,788
- Why didn't you get help for her?

1031
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,563
- Who the hell's gonna believe me?

1032
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:39,338
- Point taken, but it
wasn't our fault either.

1033
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,613
And you killed everybody!

1034
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,548
And we trusted you.

1035
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:43,405
And what are you gonna do now?

1036
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:45,398
You're just gonna kill me.

1037
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,643
That's fucked up.

1038
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,378
- You should go.

1039
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,228
You should just go.

1040
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,568
She's already eating your buddy,

1041
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:53,318
I'm sure she's fine for a while.

1042
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,358
Just go.

1043
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,688
- Okay. But you come with me.

1044
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,328
- I can't, she's my sister.

1045
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,158
I can't just abandon her.

1046
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:01,993
Just go.

1047
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:18,753
- Get the fuck away from me bitch.

1048
01:01:18,755 --> 01:01:19,838
You just ate.

1049
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,678
- Lily, I'm sorry.

1050
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,150
I love you, but I cannot do this anymore.

1051
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:28,936
I'm sorry, I just, I can't do it.

1052
01:02:33,005 --> 01:02:34,005
- Thank you.

1053
01:03:01,853 --> 01:03:03,582
- Fuck you sun.

1054
01:03:09,725 --> 01:03:10,558
God damn!

1055
01:03:20,499 --> 01:03:22,199
- Where is that bunch of assholes?

1056
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,099
- What the fuck?

1057
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,310
- Randy, come on.

1058
01:04:33,312 --> 01:04:34,847
around.

1059
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:39,354
Randy?

1060
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,895
- Oh my God!

1061
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:29,328
- All right, now that story, that was hot.

1062
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:30,168
I like that one.

1063
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:31,268
That was cool.

1064
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,408
- Definitely makes me never wanna go

1065
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,444
to my uncle's cabin ever again.

1066
01:05:34,446 --> 01:05:37,118
- Facts. But nah, that
was a very good one man.

1067
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,388
- Too bad your friends weren't
here to enjoy it as well.

1068
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:41,853
- Their loss.

1069
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,098
- They've been gone quite some time.

1070
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,788
You don't suppose
anything is wrong, do you?

1071
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:50,338
- Other than Kyle having sex,

1072
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:53,149
'cause that's just wrong
anyway you look at it.

1073
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,068
- Nah, I'm sure they fine.

1074
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,848
Don't worry about them.

1075
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,773
I'm actually happy they're gone anyway.

1076
01:05:57,775 --> 01:05:58,606
to hear more

1077
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:00,388
of Kyle's stupid ass comments again.

1078
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,221
- Amen.

1079
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,353
- Good. Now let's get
on with it, shall we?

1080
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,388
- Something wrong?

1081
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:09,221
- Not at all.

1082
01:06:09,223 --> 01:06:11,218
I'm just having a little
trouble locating the item

1083
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,788
that goes along with our next story.

1084
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:15,818
I must have left it in my trailer.

1085
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,098
Do be patient my friend.

1086
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:20,003
I shall return momentarily.

1087
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:28,688
- I didn't see a trailer
when we came in, did you?

1088
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,523
- No.

1089
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,638
Can we go?

1090
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,458
He's creeping me out.

1091
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,291
Now's the perfect time to go.

1092
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:39,298
His eyes, like, something's
not right with him.

1093
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,968
- Come on, stop being so scared.

1094
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,708
Like, matter of fact,
let's check some stuff out

1095
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:43,541
while he's gone.

1096
01:06:43,543 --> 01:06:44,649
- No, no.

1097
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:45,808
- Babe, please, come on.

1098
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,988
I promise, it's gonna be okay.

1099
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:49,440
We're gonna be fine, come on.

1100
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:52,093
- Stupid.

1101
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:56,188
- It's okay, it happens sometimes.

1102
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,858
- Not to me it doesn't.

1103
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,808
Must be 'cause all the
fucking beer we drunk

1104
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,228
or something, I don't know.

1105
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:04,478
- It's fine. Don't be upset.

1106
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,308
- For God's sake, don't tell Alex,

1107
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:08,628
whatever you do, I'm serious.

1108
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,058
I'd never hear the end of it.

1109
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,038
That's why she fucking.

1110
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,798
- We can try again later if you want.

1111
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,998
I mean, if you're up for it.

1112
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,078
- The fuck that supposed to mean?

1113
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,988
- Nothing. That's not what I meant.

1114
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:21,018
You know what I mean.

1115
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,143
- I know, I don't know
what you fucking mean.

1116
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,548
- Where are you going?

1117
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:27,568
- To take a fucking piss!

1118
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,220
At least it's good for that, huh?

1119
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,320
- I knew I should have given
him one of them blue pills.

1120
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,332
- Fucking bullshit.

1121
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:46,479
- Sage?

1122
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:48,898
Riley?

1123
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:57,818
Riley if that's you, I swear to God,

1124
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,520
I'm gonna beat the shit outta you.

1125
01:08:00,545 --> 01:08:02,453
Not in the mood for your fucking bullshit.

1126
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:05,385
And what the are you supposed to be?

1127
01:08:28,993 --> 01:08:31,080
- What is taking him so long?

1128
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:45,431
Takes forever.

1129
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:46,933
It's fucking true.

1130
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:49,340
Kyle?

1131
01:08:51,027 --> 01:08:51,860
Kyle?

1132
01:08:54,638 --> 01:08:55,638
Is that you?

1133
01:09:00,025 --> 01:09:01,577
Kyle, stop playing...

1134
01:09:23,977 --> 01:09:26,527
Who the fuck are you?

1135
01:09:39,598 --> 01:09:40,600
Stop!

1136
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:47,856
Stop!

1137
01:09:58,232 --> 01:09:59,065
Stop!

1138
01:10:00,787 --> 01:10:02,968
Please, help me.

1139
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,358
Help me.

1140
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,548
- Now, why would I do something like that?

1141
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:08,383
- What?

1142
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,729
- As you were.

1143
01:10:15,005 --> 01:10:15,838
- Stop!

1144
01:10:19,446 --> 01:10:21,380
Stop! Get off me!

1145
01:10:21,382 --> 01:10:22,215
Stop!

1146
01:10:25,143 --> 01:10:25,974
Stop!

1147
01:10:59,075 --> 01:11:00,868
- this place really is, babe.

1148
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:02,070
- Why are we still here?

1149
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,438
- this is cool.

1150
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,271
- No, it's not.

1151
01:11:05,273 --> 01:11:06,104
We need to...

1152
01:11:06,106 --> 01:11:08,108
- Terribly sorry about that.

1153
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:09,948
- Nah, you good, man.

1154
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:11,097
You found what you were looking for?

1155
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:11,930
- I certainly did.

1156
01:11:11,932 --> 01:11:15,038
I can't believe I left it back there.

1157
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,248
After all, it is the crown jewel

1158
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,088
of our collection in many ways.

1159
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,193
I acquired it just this very morning.

1160
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,153
- What's that?

1161
01:11:25,493 --> 01:11:30,493
- Yo, I had one of these when I was a kid.

1162
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:32,498
I loved that thing.

1163
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,488
- So did the person I acquired it from.

1164
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:38,190
You may say it one time, it
was his only.

1165
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:42,888
- Aw, that's sad.

1166
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:44,398
- This is dope.

1167
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,548
- One may say it is even
sad what happened to him.

1168
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:48,818
- What happened to him?

1169
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:51,288
- He was a shy little guy.

1170
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:54,488
His mother forced him to go to
a birthday party thinking it

1171
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:57,328
would help him make friends.

1172
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:00,193
It was a decision both of
them would learn to regret.

1173
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:15,738
- Okay. everyone.

1174
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,990
Are you ready for the main event?

1175
01:12:17,992 --> 01:12:18,825
- Yeah.

1176
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:23,155
- Let me introduce, Chuckles the Clown.

1177
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,268
- Where'd you find this guy?

1178
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:37,008
He is awesome.

1179
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:38,608
Maybe a little too good.

1180
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:39,441
- I know, right?

1181
01:12:39,443 --> 01:12:42,108
Listen to them, they're eating it up.

1182
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:43,668
Fine by me though.

1183
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,308
That means they'll pass out early

1184
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,628
and then I can have some cake on my own.

1185
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,958
- Thought men were
supposed to be the pervs?

1186
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,005
- Well, lucky for you, they're not.

1187
01:12:52,007 --> 01:12:53,968
Now get the candles on
the cakes so we could get

1188
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,988
the presents started
for these little shits.

1189
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:59,248
It's sad that Brian and
Tracy couldn't make it today.

1190
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,428
- Yeah, but Nick's sick.

1191
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:02,508
We'll see them next week.

1192
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:04,700
- Uh oh, we have a frowner.

1193
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:07,368
- You get the candles on the cake

1194
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:09,422
and I'll take care of that.

1195
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,798
Hey, big guy, in case nobody
told you the party's outside.

1196
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,305
What are you doing moping
around in here for?

1197
01:13:25,307 --> 01:13:26,658
- I don't really know.

1198
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,338
- You're sad 'cause your buddy
Nicholas couldn't make it.

1199
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,293
- Yeah, I guess so, he's sick.

1200
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,798
- Just has a fever,

1201
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,398
you'll be push him in the
mud again in a day or two.

1202
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,978
You're missing the clown.

1203
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,528
He's pretty cool.

1204
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:41,448
I bet he could make you
a shark or an alligator

1205
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,532
or something out of a balloon,

1206
01:13:43,534 --> 01:13:45,338
or is that too lame?

1207
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:48,908
- It's too lame, and
plus, I don't like clowns.

1208
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,531
I don't like their faces.

1209
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:52,998
- Nah, he's not too bad at all.

1210
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,308
You know who has a much scarier face?

1211
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:58,063
Miss Christina.

1212
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,718
All right big guy, I'm
gonna head back outside.

1213
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,768
Don't stay in here too long

1214
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,780
'cause we're gonna do cake and pizza soon.

1215
01:14:04,782 --> 01:14:05,615
- Okay.

1216
01:14:06,918 --> 01:14:07,918
- All right.

1217
01:15:42,813 --> 01:15:45,523
- That day replays in my
head every single night.

1218
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:48,895
When I'm trying to sleep,

1219
01:15:48,897 --> 01:15:52,038
it's like a never ending nightmare.

1220
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,608
It's like the clown is
the master of my dreams,

1221
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:57,168
and he's controlling
me and he's watching me

1222
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:59,118
and he's every single night.

1223
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,858
- Cam, we've been through
this multiple times

1224
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,338
in the last 15 years.

1225
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,798
You know there's nothing to be afraid of.

1226
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,665
You told me yourself, the clown is dead.

1227
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:10,233
- But what if he's not dead?

1228
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,543
What if he's still out
there waiting for me?

1229
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:18,609
I don't know, lately I felt a presence,

1230
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:23,548
you know, like somebody's
waiting for me or watching me

1231
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:26,688
or just hiding behind my eyes.

1232
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:31,068
- Sometimes when we
experience a traumatic event,

1233
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:34,998
our bodies find a way
of framing the event.

1234
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,528
Sort of like a freeze frame
of that moment in time,

1235
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:40,768
where your brain just can't let go of it.

1236
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:45,148
But we try and we try as hard
as we can to get past it.

1237
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:47,538
But it always stays with us.

1238
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,128
It's our own choice.

1239
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:51,058
If we wanna let it consume us

1240
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,313
or if we wanna fight back
and regain our control.

1241
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:58,208
- I'm guessing you're
going somewhere with this.

1242
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:01,206
- The point is to concentrate on today.

1243
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:04,955
- Well, I wish today would
be over with already.

1244
01:17:04,957 --> 01:17:07,768
- Well, I think this will help you.

1245
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:08,828
- What is it?

1246
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:10,588
- It's an antipsychotic.

1247
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:12,283
I want you to take it once a day.

1248
01:17:13,502 --> 01:17:14,333
- Okay.

1249
01:17:14,335 --> 01:17:16,748
- But only take the prescribed dosage.

1250
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,698
Otherwise you could have
symptoms of delirium

1251
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,300
and that would make things much worse.

1252
01:17:22,302 --> 01:17:23,808
- All right, I got it.

1253
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:26,978
- Cam, you've been coming to
me ever since you were a kid,

1254
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,355
and I am really proud of you

1255
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:30,588
and the progress that you've made.

1256
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:33,408
I know this time of year
can be troublesome for you,

1257
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,483
it always has been,

1258
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:40,610
but you are here, I'm
here and we're a team.

1259
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:44,148
Now, you can do this.

1260
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:46,198
You've always had this within you.

1261
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,118
- Yeah. I guess you're right.

1262
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,935
It's been 20 years.

1263
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,468
- Well, I guess we're all done for today.

1264
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,198
Same time next week okay?

1265
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,618
- Yeah. Yeah, sounds good.

1266
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:02,623
But what if I do start seeing him again?

1267
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,493
- Cam, I want you to repeat after me,

1268
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,253
this isn't real.

1269
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,428
- This isn't real.

1270
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,358
- The clown is gone.

1271
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,068
- The clown is gone.

1272
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:18,908
- He cannot hurt me anymore.

1273
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:21,278
- He cannot hurt me anymore.

1274
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,438
- I'm in full control.

1275
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,968
- I am in full control.

1276
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,763
- Now, see?

1277
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,800
Don't you feel better?

1278
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:36,248
- Yeah, actually a little bit.

1279
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:39,978
- Okay. Well, so I'll see you
at the same time next week.

1280
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:42,068
And remember if you need
me, you can call me.

1281
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:44,218
My phone is always on for you.

1282
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,768
- All right. Thanks.

1283
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:46,603
- Sure.

1284
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:53,233
Oh Cam, Happy Halloween.

1285
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:55,497
- Yeah, you too.

1286
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,171
Yes, 911.

1287
01:19:40,173 --> 01:19:41,004
I need help immediately.

1288
01:19:41,006 --> 01:19:42,438
Somebody broke into my house.

1289
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,088
It's 322 Maple Avenue.

1290
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:45,043
Please, hurry!

1291
01:19:48,278 --> 01:19:50,258
Come on, come on.

1292
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,328
Nick, Nick, dude, you gotta
get into my house right now.

1293
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,453
Somebody broke in.

1294
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,351
I don't fucking know.

1295
01:19:55,353 --> 01:19:56,283
Just get here.

1296
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:02,708
- Well Cameron, we can
definitely classify it

1297
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,148
as a breaking and entering.

1298
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:05,438
The bright side is,

1299
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,858
it doesn't look like anything is missing.

1300
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:10,578
- You sure? None of like my
hockey stuff or anything?

1301
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,718
- No, nothing. It checks out clean.

1302
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,968
The only room that was roughed
up a little bit was yours,

1303
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:19,420
but it was just a couple
of things thrown around.

1304
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,008
- It's fine, I guess.

1305
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:25,068
- I know. I'm sorry.

1306
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,348
But you know, we usually do
get a couple of break ins

1307
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:28,998
around this time of year.

1308
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,628
I mean, Halloween is tomorrow.

1309
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:33,338
- Yeah, I know.

1310
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,868
Thanks for coming over so quick.

1311
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:37,818
- It's part of the job,
bud, but you're welcome.

1312
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,673
Say if you ever need anything,
you give me a call, you hear?

1313
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,138
- Good news is you didn't lose

1314
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,717
any of your Star Wars.

1315
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:04,019
- Yeah, that would've
been an act of violence.

1316
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,588
- But besides all this
bullshit, are you okay?

1317
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:09,678
How was your appointment
today with Dr. Harris?

1318
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,638
- It's the same as usual.

1319
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,228
You know, a lot of, "how
do you feel about that?"

1320
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:14,647
And, "you're doing great."

1321
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:17,218
She did tell me I've been making a lot

1322
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,425
of progress lately though.

1323
01:21:18,427 --> 01:21:21,078
And that actually felt pretty good.

1324
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,508
She said I was one of her best cases.

1325
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:23,958
- Hey, good.

1326
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,223
See, you got this.

1327
01:21:26,223 --> 01:21:28,378
I mean, you've been doing
this stuff for what? 10 years?

1328
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,947
It's bound to sink in at some point.

1329
01:21:30,949 --> 01:21:31,780
You can't be running around here

1330
01:21:31,782 --> 01:21:33,668
like one of those other psychopaths.

1331
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:35,370
- Yeah, only when I'm off my meds.

1332
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:38,016
Well look, thanks for coming over, man.

1333
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:38,849
I appreciate it.

1334
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:39,948
- Hey, no problem, dude, anytime.

1335
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:41,616
- Still over tomorrow?

1336
01:21:41,618 --> 01:21:42,618
- Hell yeah.

1337
01:21:44,121 --> 01:21:45,030
Have a good night.

1338
01:21:45,032 --> 01:21:45,865
- You too.

1339
01:22:01,275 --> 01:22:02,978
Not again, not again.

1340
01:24:04,544 --> 01:24:05,711
Don't do this.

1341
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:07,813
It isn't real.

1342
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,048
None of this is real.

1343
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:11,950
You're in control.

1344
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,734
This happens every year.

1345
01:24:15,736 --> 01:24:16,903
It's not real.

1346
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:19,236
It's not real.

1347
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:29,505
It isn't real, it isn't
real, it isn't real,

1348
01:24:29,507 --> 01:24:30,674
it isn't real.

1349
01:24:44,794 --> 01:24:46,348
What are you doing here?

1350
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:48,938
- I came over to get a beer,
I didn't expect to die for it.

1351
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:50,278
- Why didn't you call me first?

1352
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,818
- I did. You didn't get it?

1353
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:53,495
- No, obviously.

1354
01:24:53,497 --> 01:24:55,228
Why are you laughing?

1355
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,913
- Cause it's funny, dude.

1356
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:00,238
- Drunk as shit, six
o'clock in the morning,

1357
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,348
sun's already up.

1358
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:02,508
We're working our way home.

1359
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:06,948
We pass by a playground
with a tether ball thing.

1360
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:10,388
We decide it's a great idea
to play Drunk Tether Ball.

1361
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:11,221
- Oh God.

1362
01:25:11,223 --> 01:25:12,128
- Five minutes in,

1363
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:15,708
I spike it straight down
into the girl's face.

1364
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:16,541
- You did not!

1365
01:25:16,543 --> 01:25:17,374
- I swear to God.

1366
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:18,298
- Oh my God.

1367
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,325
Was she bleeding?

1368
01:25:19,327 --> 01:25:21,078
- No, dude, it didn't even leave a mark.

1369
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,208
It just made a loud sound.

1370
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,648
And I felt that for like a second.

1371
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:25,998
- Oh my God.

1372
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,963
Dude, that's funny.

1373
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,008
Hey, I know today was a lot,

1374
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:37,177
but honestly, are you okay?

1375
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,548
- I don't know man.

1376
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:44,113
Something weird's going on.

1377
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:45,993
- Like what?

1378
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,313
- I keep seeing stuff.

1379
01:25:51,761 --> 01:25:54,138
- I told you to stay off
your sister's Tinder.

1380
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:56,647
- Man, shut the fuck
up. I'm being serious.

1381
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:01,391
I Keep seeing clown stuff, man.

1382
01:26:01,393 --> 01:26:02,328
And it's not just any clown,

1383
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:06,047
it's the clown from the
birthday party, man, I..

1384
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:08,753
- Jesus Christ, Cameron.

1385
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:11,708
We've been over this.

1386
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:12,828
There is no clown.

1387
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:15,163
You didn't see anything, okay.

1388
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,458
Look, I don't know where
any of this is coming from,

1389
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,488
but we've been over this a million times.

1390
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:22,890
- They never caught the guy.

1391
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,133
- What?

1392
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,623
- After I got away,

1393
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:31,878
I told the cops and they came

1394
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,798
and they couldn't find any sign of him.

1395
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,633
He was gone.

1396
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:40,430
They never caught him.

1397
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:44,888
I couldn't sleep for years.

1398
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:46,348
I had to do something.

1399
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:48,928
So I made myself believe that he was dead.

1400
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:50,653
I even told my therapist that.

1401
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,253
- So all this time,

1402
01:26:57,770 --> 01:27:01,078
you've been lying to me

1403
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,393
and to everyone else.

1404
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,438
I can't believe you, Cameron.

1405
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,168
Like that is literally the
shittiest thing I've ever heard.

1406
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,638
How could you not tell
me the whole story, dude?

1407
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,648
Like, I can't believe you, man.

1408
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:22,650
- I don't know, it was just
my way of coping, I guess.

1409
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:24,018
You don't know what it was like, man,

1410
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:26,198
I was terrified every night.

1411
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,888
- I'm just at a loss of words, Cam.

1412
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:32,373
'Cause like, you lied
to your therapist too?

1413
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:34,853
What the fuck!

1414
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:37,688
They're trying to help you, dude.

1415
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:40,418
Like, you honestly think
that the guy is still alive.

1416
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:42,483
It's been 20 years, 20 years.

1417
01:27:43,827 --> 01:27:44,658
- I don't know, man.

1418
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:45,598
If they've never caught him like...

1419
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,150
- Listen, listen, let's
just stop talking about it.

1420
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:50,053
- Yeah.

1421
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:59,908
You been on my sister's Tinder lately?

1422
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:01,598
- What? Fuck no.

1423
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,560
- Come on, man.

1424
01:28:02,562 --> 01:28:05,186
I know the way you look
at her when she's around.

1425
01:28:05,188 --> 01:28:07,113
- I'm getting another beer.

1426
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,631
- Hey, grab me one too.

1427
01:28:10,633 --> 01:28:14,673
- You got it.

1428
01:28:17,694 --> 01:28:19,277
- Nick! Nick! Nick!

1429
01:28:28,617 --> 01:28:30,028
Nick, I just saw him.

1430
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:30,861
He's outside.

1431
01:28:30,863 --> 01:28:31,694
- Who?

1432
01:28:31,696 --> 01:28:32,658
- The clown!

1433
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:33,778
- There's no clown, dude.

1434
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,638
- Nick, dude, I swear to God, I saw him.

1435
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,471
He was right there.

1436
01:28:36,473 --> 01:28:38,008
He was right across the fire.

1437
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:38,868
- There's never been a clown.

1438
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:40,043
It's all in your head.

1439
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:42,661
What?

1440
01:28:42,663 --> 01:28:43,568
- He's in the house!

1441
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:44,401
- Where dude?

1442
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:45,908
- He's up, he just went out the stairs.

1443
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:47,208
- Listen, I'm gonna go up and check,

1444
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:49,038
but then I'm gonna get you a Valium.

1445
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:49,963
- Nick, wait!

1446
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,488
- You know, out of the two of us,

1447
01:29:03,490 --> 01:29:05,398
I pinned you to be the smarter one.

1448
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,342
But today I won the golden ticket.

1449
01:29:07,344 --> 01:29:08,288
- What the hell does that mean?

1450
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:10,148
- It means that there's
no one else in this house

1451
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:11,568
except for the two of us.

1452
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:12,508
And I'm going home.

1453
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:13,958
- Nick, I'm serious, man.

1454
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,748
- Me too, man.

1455
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,178
Look, I love you dude,

1456
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:21,567
but later this week we're
having a serious conversation.

1457
01:30:18,941 --> 01:30:20,024
- Isn't real.

1458
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:23,085
Isn't real.

1459
01:31:47,145 --> 01:31:47,978
Nick.

1460
01:31:49,428 --> 01:31:50,261
Nick!

1461
01:31:54,921 --> 01:31:56,504
I'm so sorry, Nick.

1462
01:32:08,966 --> 01:32:10,698
It isn't real.

1463
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:11,910
It isn't real.

1464
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,590
You're not real.

1465
01:32:16,804 --> 01:32:18,137
You're not real!

1466
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:30,500
yourself together.

1467
01:32:31,535 --> 01:32:32,702
It's not real.

1468
01:32:41,345 --> 01:32:42,178
No!

1469
01:32:43,923 --> 01:32:45,428
- Holy shit!

1470
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:46,263
- What?

1471
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,910
- I've heard all this stuff before.

1472
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:52,708
Well, the birthday stuff anyway.

1473
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:54,668
- How'd you hear about it?

1474
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,928
- My parents and older brother,

1475
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:58,680
they used to live in the same
town before I moved here.

1476
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:01,098
I wasn't born yet though.

1477
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,048
I don't talk about it.

1478
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:03,858
- Are you serious?

1479
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:04,693
- Yeah.

1480
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,088
Ask my mom that about it sometime.

1481
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:09,418
- Creepy.

1482
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:10,251
- Yeah.

1483
01:33:10,253 --> 01:33:13,018
- And do you want to know
what the best part is?

1484
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:13,851
- What's that?

1485
01:33:13,853 --> 01:33:17,678
- When Cobalt kills his
victims, their souls become his.

1486
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,738
There is no going to heaven or hell,

1487
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:25,578
they have to do what he tells
them to for all eternity.

1488
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,788
Do you want to know how I know this?

1489
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:28,868
- How?

1490
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:31,098
- Because I was at that party too.

1491
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,338
I went there to take my little brother.

1492
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:37,038
He insisted I escort
him inside to the door,

1493
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,033
because there was a
clown and he was afraid.

1494
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,071
- You're shitting us, right?

1495
01:33:43,073 --> 01:33:45,838
Like this is all part of your act, right?

1496
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,228
- No, I'm not shitting you.

1497
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:49,673
I belong to Cobalt.

1498
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:53,488
And now, so do you.

1499
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:54,323
- What!

1500
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,968
- Ah, come on in, don't be shy.

1501
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:01,363
They're waiting for you.

1502
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:06,208
- This isn't happening.

1503
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:07,673
This isn't happening!

1504
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:09,323
- Ah, but it is.

1505
01:36:23,573 --> 01:36:25,811
- All right, we gotta get back to the car.

1506
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:27,192
Okay, c'mon.

1507
01:36:27,194 --> 01:36:28,027
- Okay.

1508
01:36:43,751 --> 01:36:44,668
Get off me!

1509
01:36:58,167 --> 01:37:01,500
- Strawberry.

1510
01:37:05,955 --> 01:37:07,753
- Somebody help me.

1511
01:37:14,862 --> 01:37:16,068
Oh, God.

1512
01:37:25,941 --> 01:37:26,774
Oh my God!

1513
01:37:34,201 --> 01:37:35,118
Help! Help!

1514
01:38:04,603 --> 01:38:05,436
Please.

1515
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,033
- Alex, help me please, help.

1516
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,342
Alex, I'm hurt.

1517
01:38:17,344 --> 01:38:18,436
- Sage, is that you?

1518
01:38:18,438 --> 01:38:20,590
- Please help me.

1519
01:38:20,592 --> 01:38:21,423
- Are you hurt?

1520
01:38:21,425 --> 01:38:22,318
Where are you?

1521
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,151
- I'm hurt.

1522
01:38:23,153 --> 01:38:24,148
Alex, help me please.

1523
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:24,981
- Sage.

1524
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:25,814
- I'm hurt.

1525
01:38:25,816 --> 01:38:26,649
- Where are you?

1526
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:29,155
- Please help me.

1527
01:38:29,157 --> 01:38:31,143
- Okay, I'm gonna come and get you, okay.

1528
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:36,125
- Alex, help, I'm over here.

1529
01:38:36,127 --> 01:38:37,258
- I can't find you.

1530
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:39,053
- I'm hurt really bad.

1531
01:38:40,118 --> 01:38:40,951
Please!

1532
01:38:43,648 --> 01:38:44,566
- Sage.

1533
01:38:44,568 --> 01:38:45,399
- Alex!

1534
01:38:45,401 --> 01:38:46,734
- Where are you?

1535
01:38:47,743 --> 01:38:48,576
Sage?

1536
01:38:51,683 --> 01:38:52,516
Sage!

1537
01:38:54,808 --> 01:38:56,397
Sage?

1538
01:38:56,399 --> 01:38:57,230
Sage?

1539
01:38:57,232 --> 01:38:58,288
Come on, we gotta get outta here.

1540
01:38:58,290 --> 01:38:59,863
Go to the car.

1541
01:38:59,865 --> 01:39:04,111
My God, Sage!

1542
01:39:04,113 --> 01:39:07,164
- Thank you for coming to the show, Alex.

1543
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:42,508
- Hello, Alex?

1544
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:43,343
Where are you?

1545
01:40:44,907 --> 01:40:46,998
You should have been home hours ago.

1546
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,278
- Hello.

1547
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,113
- Who is this?

1548
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,588
This is not funny.

1549
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:54,978
Stop messing around, Alex.

1550
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:56,183
- I'm sorry dear.

1551
01:40:57,390 --> 01:41:01,318
She's busy enjoying the show.

1552
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,513
- Where's Alex?

1553
01:41:03,611 --> 01:41:04,611
Who is this?

1554
01:41:05,966 --> 01:41:08,205
Where's my daughter?

1555
01:41:08,207 --> 01:41:09,419
Where's my baby?
