Elsa, sweetheart, I know you too well.

4
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,250
You tell me everything.

5
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:43,375
Do the bombs closer?

6
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:50,708
We could you and the children
further inland to pass.

7
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:58,625
Yes, let me speak to him.

8
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,042
What?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
I.

10
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,583
Uli?

11
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:18,208
I did not know you were promoted to field marshal.

12
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:23,750
Max would not really
Field Marshal may tease.

13
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,500
Customize your good to your mother?

14
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:34,042
Now you're the man of the house.

15
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,583
On your marks!

16
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:42,500
Do not cry, Uli.
All is well.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,792
Everyone is sometimes afraid, Uli.

18
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:54,292
Watch.
Make a eagle. I do it too.

19
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:00,583
High from heaven.
On rocks and hills...

20
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,500
Sees both of us...

21
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,833
And keeps us safe.

22
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,792
I love you too.

23
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,750
Preparing.

24
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,167
Aim.

25
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,958
Fire .

26
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,583
Schmidt.

30
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,917
The goal was to occupy southern France.

00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:13,708
517de The Parachute Regiment combat
was used for this purpose.

Provence, France
5:03 pm

34
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,167
Jump over five minutes.
Get ready!

35
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:55,083
Please note that the Americans.

36
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,542
Stay together.

37
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,708
Stand up. Hands up.
- Do not shoot.

38
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,042
Do not shoot!
- Come here.

39
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,542
Do not shoot.

40
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,833
Do not shoot.

41
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,708
What have we here?

42
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,125
What is that?

43
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,083
Where is your unit?
Tell me!

44
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,625
On your knees.

45
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,875
Are you alone?

46
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,458
Are you alone?

47
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,417
Grenade!

48
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,083
Never been so happy to see you.

49
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,833
I'm alone.
- What?

50
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,083
I'm alone.

51
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,333
Where's the rest of your unit?

52
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,958
No idea.
Where's the rest of yours?

53
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,500
My name is Curtis.
- I'm Rossi.

54
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,792
Thank you.

55
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,125
Pleasure.

56
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:55,000
What are you looking for?
- I promised my buddy a souvenir.

57
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,875
A SS skull ring, Luger,
or something.

58
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:02,750
I have no idea where the landing zone from here.

59
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:06,208
You got a compass?
- Yes, I have.

60
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,750
Give me a minute.

61
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,292
Where is yours?
- Lost in the jump.

62
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:21,208
This sleeve was faster than I expected.
A drop in the night gives a rough landing.

63
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,208
This mountain range there...

64
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,875
Says that we are here.

65
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,083
More than 20 km from the landing zone.

66
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,083
How is it that we so far have landed?
- Blame it on the scouts.

67
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,125
When I jumped, I swear to you, for giving me
above the sea already left jump.

68
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,042
That was hellish.

69
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:43,167
I hope they wait for us in Les Arcs.
- That is 3 km past the landing zone.

70
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,208
Here, we better go.
Are you ready?

71
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,792
Yes, only grab my gun.

72
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,583
Rossi!

73
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,375
Okay.

74
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,167
Let's see.
I'll go first.

75
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,583
No, I will go.
And you give me coverage.

76
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,958
Okay. Go ahead.

77
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,625
Do not move.

78
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,083
Democracy.
- Lafayette.

79
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,875
Curtis?

80
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,750
Sergeant?

81
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,708
Are you but two?
- We could not find anyone else.

82
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,500
This is Corporal Rossi.
- Sergeant Jones, Bravo Company.

83
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,833
What are you singing?

84
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,042
This is an old song.

85
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,792
That's not really uplifting.
Can you remember anything else?

86
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,708
Not directly.
- What happened to you?

87
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,167
My platoon did.
Seemed like a good idea when.

88
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,875
What would your mother think? If everyone
of a bridge jump, do you do it?

89
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,958
All my friends jump out of airplanes.
That's pretty much the same.

90
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:07,458
What is the reason that there should be?
- It's a warrior thing.

91
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,583
Ten battle.

92
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,708
I'd best explain it, but do not
that you would understand.

93
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,042
Also good.

94
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,750
What are we gonna do, Sergeant?

95
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:29,167
We can not just sit here and wait.
The Germans will broadcast patrols.

96
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,958
Who knows how long it takes for us is our unity.

97
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,583
The battalion would have to meet in Les Arcs.
That's what we do.

98
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,167
With luck we are in the evening.
- How far is that?

99
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:43,000
I would say...

100
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,792
A 19 kilometer.
- I need to know in miles.

101
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,417
Can not convert kilometers in miles?
That was one of the first lessons.

102
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,375
They gave lessons in there, but
I have no lesson learned.

103
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,250
This is... about eleven miles.

104
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,875
I do not know what you think, but I
joined the paratroopers to be properly disposed.

105
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,417
Not that I should wear my shoes
to have to search.

106
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:13,083
Way we will probably encounter a lot of Germans.

107
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,375
Yes, like you assume.

108
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:20,792
We'll have to improvise.
What did Colonel Graves again?

109
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:26,208
<i> A few men can really make much
problems as they are on the right place. </ I></i>

110
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:30,500
We do what we practiced.
Then we get it.

111
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,167
Why we're here, is not it gentlemen?
A plane jump...

112
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:39,583
Countries behind enemy lines in the middle of the night.

113
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:43,792
And all for $ 50 extra per month.

114
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,042
I'm a parachutist.
I am a commando.

115
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:50,042
I jump with a parachute from any plane in flight.

116
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:54,167
I give this to me as a volunteer,
I've known the dangers all too well.

117
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:58,583
<i> I serve a mighty force,
famous for his actions during war... </ i></i>

118
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:04,125
<i> known for its usability and peace.
It is my honor and prestige oath to uphold... </ i></i>

119
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:08,167
<i> in everything I am and do. </ I></i>

120
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,458
I said to myself every day.

121
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,583
Why not surprise me that, Curtis?
Let you feel invincible?

122
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:28,000
When I was little, I went with friends
to the pier at the beach of Long Beach.

123
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:31,333
There was a roller coaster.
- Cyclone Racer.

124
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,583
The Cyclone Racer, you know him!
- Yes, that is famous.

125
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:38,250
They say the first fall is so steep,
thing people are dying.

126
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:41,250
Yes, exactly.
We bought our tickets.

127
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,542
We ran the first place.
And when we left...

128
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,958
We went that steep slope.
We made the security release...

129
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,667
And climbed onto the front of it trolley
and dangled our legs over.

130
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,125
And then suddenly...

131
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,333
160 km per hour.

132
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,583
Your legs tremble and I think to myself,
I'm coming!

133
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,917
I'm going to lose weight and fall to pieces.

134
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,458
Could not you have anything less adventurous can do
like a mohawk your hair do?

135
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,083
It gets better.

136
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:13,458
At the moment we come out of that first dive,
we climb out of the front cart...

137
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,042
And go back.
By the time that the ride to an end...

138
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,917
Seated completely in the last carriage.

139
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,333
Do not sure why I did it.

140
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,542
Maybe I liked
to the death to outsmart.

141
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:32,167
Was that the story you told
to the 517de to get?

142
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,208
Should I disagree.

143
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:38,333
Major siez looked at me once to
and knew that I was perfect.

144
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,083
Keep going.

145
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,792
Have you ever heard of that Nazi Aryan babies?

146
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:27,250
No, tell me.

147
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,833
Nazi Hitler want a pure race, right?
- Yes.

148
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:35,917
So he looks for people with Aryan features
and take their babies away.

149
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,750
Once they are born, comes the Third Reich
to come and take them away.

150
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,042
Nazis come in and take the baby away
from their mothers when they are born?

151
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:48,667
Yes, that is correct. Hitler has those places where he
all those young Aryan people gather...

152
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:53,875
Nazis to small babies to make.
As a factory, they are like horses bred.

153
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,500
They do some tests.
Put them in a room together.

154
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,833
They have never met each other,
they know each other at all.

155
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,833
Not "delicious perfume, nice to meet you"?
- No, nothing like that.

156
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,792
Throw balboekje out
and there is the door.

157
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:11,417
I've got to admit, I did not know
.

158
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,792
Wait.

159
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,917
You know, they have a name
for such places.

160
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:22,667
Yes, but those places are not directly intended
for kids to make.

161
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,833
Kids who grow up, put on uniforms,
conquer the world, our guys dead...

162
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:32,625
They will foot the bill.
If not in this life then in the afterlife.

163
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:36,250
You really think so?
- Yes, I'm sure.

164
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,125
Wait.
I want the map view.

165
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,208
Now look.

166
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:40,167
What do you think?
Is it me?

167
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,583
It is short...

168
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,833
But handsome.

169
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,417
My own handsome soldier.

170
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,500
They are beautiful.

171
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,083
Is that for me?

172
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,958
I do not know.
Is yet to be seen.

173
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,875
Hey, handsome.
Do you even open the door?

174
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,500
Careful.
- Thank you.

175
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,708
Beware of your head.

176
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:20,125
Good. We can continue.

177
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,792
What do you think if we jump?
- What do you mean?

178
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:41,750
You know, where do you think
if you jump from the plane?

179
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,917
Some count the seconds before they hit the ground...

180
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,125
Others think about how they are going to die.

181
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,083
Just want to know what you think.

182
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,125
I actually think of anything.

183
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,750
To what do you think?

184
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:02,000
Mostly about my girlfriend, Charlotte.

185
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,375
This seems mostly to calm.

186
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,833
What are you doing?

187
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,875
There is a pebble in my shoe.

188
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,708
Throw it.

189
00:23:58,042 --> 00:23:59,667
All clear.

190
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,583
I think you got him to graze.

191
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,792
Damn pebble in my shoe.

192
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,750
You know, Rossi?

193
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:17,042
I'm going to recommend this
for a medal.

194
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,042
Go in search of your Luger, Gates.

195
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:26,875
Let's see what you were doing,
you naughty, naughty Germans.

196
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,417
What do we have here.

197
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,833
Guess whose face at work I look.

198
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:41,542
Please mein Fuhrer beautiful.

199
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:55,250
What have we passed, 5 to 6 km?
What do you think, Curtis?

200
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:00,333
I think so about.
- How much is that in miles?

201
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,167
Multiply it by 0.62.

202
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,167
I was never good at math.
Probably because I'm kicked out of school so much.

203
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,083
Why?
- Usually by fighting.

204
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,750
I've seen you fight.

205
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:17,125
Really? Where?

206
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,750
Camp McCall.
You had the record for the most knockouts.

207
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,708
Right?
- Yeah, I've always though.

208
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,083
Is that you?

209
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,667
I thought you were bigger.

210
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,167
What you got there, Sergeant?

211
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,042
My father has given me.

212
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:42,917
Would not you should go to church?
- Yes, that's right.

213
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,833
Mother is Catholic, Baptist's father.

214
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,417
Ben while growing
far been to church.

215
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,000
Why are you not a chaplain?

216
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:55,375
One of those sacred kneusjes.

217
00:25:55,833 --> 00:26:00,292
I can also "holy" are
among the Gentiles.

218
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,625
Will you sometimes repent?

219
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,833
Let me know when you're ready.

220
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,167
Well, grab your stuff.

221
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:11,958
Come on, let's go further.

222
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:31,542
Your mother waits in the car.

223
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:34,583
I'm sorry.
I was the time it lost.

224
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,458
It is best to wait,
because they sit on comfortable chairs.

225
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:45,833
Dad, I think I know what I must do.
I feel it.

226
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,083
But I... It is hard.

227
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,583
If you feel the calling to serve,
you should follow it.

228
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,917
You will be much more useful as a chaplain.

229
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:04,167
But I feel that it is not enough.

230
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:10,667
What do you mean?

231
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,792
I enlisted in the paratroopers.
- No.

232
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,083
I'm going to be commando.
- Really.

233
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,333
It's already happened.
- No!

234
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,542
Have you seen the 2nd Battalion?
- They are an hour ago that direction assumed.

235
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,958
Warning.

236
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:04,333
Go look.

237
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,250
I grab him!

238
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,750
Come on, who's got my Luger.

239
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,292
Hey, take my picture again.

240
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,292
Come on, quickly.

241
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:05,417
I'm gonna send home to my mother.
Will her proud.

242
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,083
You look like a big game hunter.

243
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,417
What are you doing?

244
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:18,833
Put ââthe camera down.
We go.

245
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,667
What is it?

246
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,125
Someone's watching us.

247
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,292
At the dike, on the right flank.

248
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,917
Are you sure?

249
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,417
Yes. I'm sure.

250
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,667
Do not shoot.

251
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,375
Do not shoot.

252
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:47,708
Are you alone?

253
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,500
Yes.

254
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,000
Step forward.
Slow.

255
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:13,792
I'm Sergeant Jones.
- I'm Emilie Moreaux.

256
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,917
Do you know French?
- My mother is French-Canadian.

257
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,958
Do you speak English?
- A little bit.

258
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:22,917
Can you bring us to Les Arcs.
There are more Americans.

259
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,708
I can take you over there.
I am of the resistance.

260
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,667
Resistance Friends are captured,
they keep them fixed, not far from here.

261
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,625
I can bring you to Les Arcs
if you first help me to free them.

262
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,875
Germans, how much?

263
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,875
Five, maybe six.

264
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,125
Can they help us or not?
What is she saying?

265
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:43,292
Her name is Emilie. She says she
can help us but wants our help first.

266
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,708
With what?
Help with what?

267
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:48,792
She wants us
a group of her friends liberate resistance.

268
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,292
The Germans keep them here not far from fixed.

269
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,417
No.
You bring us to Les Arcs.

270
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,125
And then we come back to help you,
but not before.

271
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:02,708
We got many soldiers.
- Then it's too late, they're going to kill them.

272
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,333
Please, I beg you.

273
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:09,542
She says that it can not wait.
Then it may be too late.

274
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,958
Dan let her just here.
We do not need her help.

275
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,083
We can find it yourself Les Arcs.

276
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,625
Please,
I need your help.

277
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,833
Please.

278
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,083
How do we know this is not a trap?
They can best collaborate with the Nazis...

279
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,292
And lead us right into a trap.

280
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:35,083
I think not.

281
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:47,250
Agreed.
Take us there.

282
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,917
Thank you.
Follow me.

283
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,125
What did you tell her.

284
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:57,958
I said that a few men a lot of problems
make, as they are on the right place.

285
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:01,792
Of course, you did.
You are the Holy Jones.

286
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:05,417
The patron saint of strangers in the woods.

287
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,208
Forward.

288
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,500
Wait.

289
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:36,708
Can I?

290
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,250
Is good.
- Thank you.

291
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:44,458
There's a parachute.

292
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,042
An American?

293
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,625
Yes, it looks like this.

294
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,167
We need to be sure.

295
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:12,917
Lie!

296
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:22,333
It's one of ours.

297
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:27,083
Did he see us?
- Yeah, you know. He swings his wings.

298
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,208
What the hell?

299
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:39,250
To the other side of the field.
Move!

300
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,792
Is he gone?

301
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,333
Yes, I think he's gone.

302
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:31,125
Curtis, help me to cover him.

303
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,875
I'm speechless.

304
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:48,042
I saw it in the pawn shop of Mr.
. Steven.

305
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:50,875
Thank you.

306
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,667
You want our last day together
not wasting me to kiss.

307
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,750
You need me every week to send a picture.

308
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:08,625
So I can see what you see.

309
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:13,333
What would I do without you.

310
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,667
This is easy.

311
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,250
First, close your eyes.

312
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,625
Close your eyes.

313
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,458
Remember me that you hold.

314
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,500
And then you breathe.

315
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,417
What if I do not return.

316
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,125
I come get you.

317
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,667
What is the purpose?

318
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,875
Nothing has changed.
- Think.

319
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:10,792
She has brought us further away
and we know nothing about her.

320
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,792
You know nothing about her.
- Put us a try?

321
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,833
Her father was a doctor. Moisture in the first
war, would then no longer touch weapon.

322
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:21,750
The Germans invaded, they joined the Resistance
. He did not think they did.

323
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:25,250
Three weeks ago the Gestapo
learned about her, seized her father and brother.

324
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,375
And they tortured and executed.

325
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,583
She's got more than you invested.

326
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,875
What is your real name?

327
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:56,583
I know you understand me,
more than let you know.

328
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,125
Why do you ask?

329
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:08,000
Because I want to trust.

330
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,667
Trust me.

331
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,375
We will soon be doing, or
it is not our work.

332
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:11,000
Rossi, I'll take these two.
You go around along the East.

333
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:14,167
Fri
Make the back and we see each other again at the front.

334
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:24,042
You and Emilie remain here and give me coverage.

335
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:28,292
Stay here with Curtis and
keep the Germans in the eye.

336
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:51,250
I'm a parachutist.
I am a commando.

337
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:54,708
I jump with a parachute from any plane in flight.

338
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:58,792
I give this to me as a volunteer,
I've known the dangers all too well.

339
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,167
Sorry.

340
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:19,000
It is my honor and oath
prestige to uphold...

341
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:22,417
In everything I am and do.

342
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:26,167
I serve a mighty force
famous for...

343
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:29,542
Sorry, I'm ready.

344
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,667
Hands up!
- No, do not shoot.

345
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,042
Do not shoot!

346
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:46,917
Warning.

347
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:05,292
Safe.

348
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:10,583
All is well.
Those soldiers are there to help us.

349
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,875
That was good cover fire.
- She can shoot pretty.

350
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:18,708
Where is Gustave?
- They took him in for interrogation.

351
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:22,833
We got him all night
screaming.

352
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,583
There is still a prisoner.
Look after the other building.

353
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:31,625
Mr. Lieb, Mr.. Jacques.

354
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,500
Thank you.
- Anytime.

355
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:36,750
Hello.
- Jacques.

356
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:05,583
Open the door!

357
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,750
The door is locked.

358
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,708
Let me inside.

359
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,042
Rossi, come on.
Open!

360
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:34,708
He's dead.

361
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,208
He's dead.

362
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,417
Let's get you cleaned up.

363
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,917
But you special talents and a calling.
You're a preacher.

364
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,833
God does not want you die
in some foxhole.

365
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:01,750
He does not want anyone
in a foxhole dies, Dad.

366
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:06,917
But your calling is special.
You have to find another way to serve.

367
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,250
A safer way.
- Exactly, you have not thought about it.

368
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,708
I've thought about it,
I've done nothing...

369
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:19,958
Then think about this.

370
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:24,292
It is good to support and provide guidance...

371
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:27,042
If I can do that, I will do that.

372
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:31,917
I know I should be,
I can do the most good.

373
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:36,792
Yes.

374
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:44,667
I have you learned your own choices.

375
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:49,250
This changes everything.

376
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,833
I'll wait in the car with your mother.

377
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:08,833
Thank you.
- We must bring them to Les Arcs.

378
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:11,208
This is the least we can do.

379
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:16,250
We are here, right?
- No, actually we're here.

380
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:22,875
In order to Les Arcs, we must take this road
, but that is full of German patrols.

381
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:27,375
What do we do?
- Here is a path through the hills.

382
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:30,208
This is used by shepherds.

383
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:37,958
This is a detour.
At least five kilometers.

384
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:42,458
But much safer. We know that forests
good and the Germans never.

385
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:48,375
It will take longer, but it is safer
?

386
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:51,917
Is that it?
- Much safer, yes.

387
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,792
Waiting.

388
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,917
There's a vehicle.

389
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,000
Stop!
Hands up.

390
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:31,917
Soldiers of the 517de.
Good to see you.

391
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:38,917
Sergeant Jones.
- Lt. Woodward, this is my driver, Stewart.

392
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,833
Are the Allies already far
broken through in one night?

393
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:44,917
Yes, certainly. We have the Krauts harshly.
Have you encountered resistance?

394
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:49,208
Yes, a few.
We have a German postal disabled.

395
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,708
Some partisans liberated.

396
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,583
Then you will be pleased to hear that
10 km away, this way you sit battalion.

397
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,583
That's good to know.

398
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:02,167
I think we have a leak or something,
against something we will have driven.

399
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:06,958
Yes, that's a ruptured fuel line.
That I might recover.

400
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,208
Do you sometimes thirsty?

401
00:48:10,292 --> 00:48:16,125
So, Lieutenant, what are you doing here exactly?
- I care for the recovery of ammunition.

402
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:20,083
It's just you and Stewart?
- For now.

403
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:23,333
There is a war going on, people
no surplus.

404
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:31,250
Have you heard of that officer
that his head was cut off?

405
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:36,000
No, I do remember.
- Was in a small town in Italy.

406
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:37,875
I can not remember its name
, but...

407
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,292
Across the street had the Germans
a piano to use.

408
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,875
It was guillotine  thread.
- Whatever.

409
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,583
If you tell it you may call the guillotine wire.

410
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:50,208
So which officer sits in his jeep with his
windshield folded down.

411
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,125
He drives maybe a good 25 km / h.

412
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,125
This thread grabs him right in his throat.

413
00:48:56,958 --> 00:49:00,167
It was his mouth.
- I heard it was his throat.

414
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:02,167
His head came immediately.

415
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,792
I have all of his teeth picked.

416
00:49:08,042 --> 00:49:10,167
It was his mouth.

417
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:17,042
Well, that should be it.

418
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:22,125
Thank you've helped me.
- No problem.

419
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:26,167
Whence are you?
- Seattle, Washington.

420
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,958
There it is wet and rainy.

421
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:36,542
Many totem poles.
- Sometimes I feel small on the totem pole.

422
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,292
The lonely man.

423
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,208
Excuse?

424
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:43,083
Do not you mean the lone man on the totem pole
?

425
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:46,125
Yeah, right.
Lonely man.

426
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,708
And you then?

427
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:51,708
Whence are you?
- Albuquerque, New Mexico.

428
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:55,292
Torrance, California, born and raised.
- Good.

429
00:49:55,375 --> 00:50:00,292
Since I've never been.
Have never been outside the Northwest.

430
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:05,250
Have you fought?
- We are no opposition encountered.

431
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,875
Have been a few times been fired,
but it's pretty quiet.

432
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Besides, if we are attacked,
we burn the paper and...

433
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:14,375
We have no lists or inventories.
- Can I see your gun here?

434
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,875
Excuse?
- May I?

435
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:21,583
I'm sorry, I do not understand what she says.
- She wants the gun.

436
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:32,667
Beautiful.

437
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,250
Can I shoot it?
- Did you hear that, Rossi?

438
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:39,542
She thinks you're beautiful rifle.

439
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:42,167
She can fold
fixed and stabbing into her handbag.

440
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:47,208
I know we normally have to be frugal with our
ammunition, but she wants it fires.

441
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,208
Do you mind?
- I have no problem with that.

442
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:53,792
The Germans are long gone.
- Yeah, try it.

443
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,750
You need to convert the safety.

444
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,792
Can he shoot well?

445
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:25,750
He ââis not as good as he thinks he is.

446
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,958
I heard you my name,
which you had it?

447
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:33,333
I'm sure I can shoot better.
You want to bet?

448
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:36,833
What is she saying?
- She says she wants a shooting.

449
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:39,500
She thinks she's better than you.
- I really want to see.

450
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:42,292
No, we're not...

451
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:44,250
She wants to bet.

452
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Okay.
I take her money.

453
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:55,708
He says he does not like
money will decrease.

454
00:51:56,667 --> 00:52:00,958
He's too cocky.
Why are we betting?

455
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:03,792
What you got, Rossi?

456
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:13,833
This is good. Yes.
- She does not mind.

457
00:52:13,917 --> 00:52:15,792
What do you want?

458
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,500
I said I do want her money, but...

459
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:22,000
A kiss for me as well.

460
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:23,833
A kiss?

461
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:28,958
Yes, a kiss just as
French women can give.

462
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:33,292
Agreement.

463
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,042
Looks like we have a deal.
- This is going to be awesome.

464
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,458
Is this the fair sometimes?
- It is 1000 meters, about anyway.

465
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:05,333
That's not fair, she can never touch.
I can maybe not.

466
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:07,750
That's the idea.

467
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:11,542
I'm a fool but you just set.

468
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:16,375
You must first let the lady go.
- Yes, but do your best.

469
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,375
No, I prefer the second.
- She wants you to show how to do it.

470
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:26,333
What the lady like.

471
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:30,292
Well, three shots. Nothing more.
Three bullets, that's good?

472
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:31,750
Yes, that's good.

473
00:53:42,417 --> 00:53:44,667
Do you want to...

474
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:15,500
Thank you.

475
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,583
Handsome shot.

476
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,000
It is pretty nice shoot.

477
00:54:24,417 --> 00:54:27,125
Standing  she never hit.

478
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:37,083
She does it standing and put you fool.
That's what she'll do.

479
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:41,917
Congratulations, that was impressive.

480
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:53,458
Thank you.

481
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:03,417
I admire your courage. Countries in
enemy territory without artillery support.

482
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:07,250
No knowledge of the area.
I have a cousin who is in the Navy,

483
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:10,875
for them is totally different. They
sleep every night in the same bed, hot food...

484
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:14,167
Daily news of home movies.
I'm not saying it's easy...

485
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,958
But it's not what you do.

486
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:19,792
Movies?

487
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,583
I can not remember when I've seen one.

488
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,625
Yes, sir?

489
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:29,125
When the last time you saw a movie?
Do you remember that?

490
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:31,333
It's been a while ago.

491
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,708
"Watch on the Rhine" with Paul Lukas.

492
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,375
Lieutenant, I wanted to ask you...

493
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:42,167
Where were you before you landed in Provence?
- We were in Italy.

494
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,667
We.

495
00:55:43,917 --> 00:55:45,708
Where exactly?

496
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:49,250
We landed in the south.

497
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:52,958
In Suvito Vecchia?
- Sergeant, we need to go.

498
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,167
You need to your battalion.
You may be entitled to...

499
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:58,708
What are you landed?
- I do not have time for your questions.

500
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:02,833
You need to get away, and that's an order.
- I ask you a simple question.

501
00:56:02,917 --> 00:56:05,375
What are you landed in Italy.

502
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:07,417
Are you crazy?

503
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:11,375
They are Germans.
Take their weapons, search them.

504
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,500
You're going to tell us exactly who you are.

505
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:22,667
I hate nothing worse than
sneaky nasty Nazis.

506
00:56:40,292 --> 00:56:41,875
Seat.

507
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,375
Frisk them again.

508
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:50,167
Look after his pockets.

509
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,833
Nothing forgotten.

510
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:07,667
They have nothing.

511
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:11,667
Who is Francois Poulenc?

512
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:15,000
I have to just give my name and rank.

513
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,417
Who is Francois Poulenc?

514
00:57:18,708 --> 00:57:22,000
Schneider, Klaus.
Soldier.

515
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:25,250
Why are you here?
What is your mission?

516
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:29,292
Material destroy officers
murder, inquire, what?

517
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,875
Talk!

518
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:34,750
I need to know what your association with this man!

519
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:38,250
I'm not mad, Sergeant.
I know how it goes in your country.

520
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:40,750
Americans injure no prisoners.

521
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:46,625
You tell me right now
or I swear I blow your head off.

522
00:57:47,292 --> 00:57:49,542
That you did not do.

523
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:54,583
Now...

524
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,125
All bluff.
That's all this is.

525
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:15,083
Like I said.

526
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,875
I know Americans.

527
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:34,750
This fine French people,
who are not like Germans made.

528
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:38,833
I need to know who Francois Poulenc and
why you see his name on paper with you.

529
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:40,292
And it immediately.

530
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,542
Poulenc was one of our best informants
in Provence.

531
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,958
And you would 'm going to meet.
- In Le Tournay, in his apartment.

532
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:51,042
And then?
- We had to relieve him...

533
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:54,958
Fear that the Allies
him with important data would intervene.

534
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,667
I would not worry.
The resistance will be to him care.

535
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,292
Jacques will bring the prisoner and return with reinforcements.

536
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:14,208
Where does he go?

537
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:18,042
For his final journey.
- I do not care.

538
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:21,792
All I know is that
he returns with reinforcements.

539
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:25,000
Emilie and I will bring you to Les Arcs.
- Good.

540
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,542
He knew that the Germans were you?

541
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:38,667
A U.S. soldier with a German binoculars?

542
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:42,208
Did you know that buyer that wearing?
We do not on the battlefield.

543
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:46,750
Yes, officer back.
Patton drove even always easy front.

544
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,917
That was close.

545
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:42,458
This is the way to Les Arcs.

546
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,917
Good.

547
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,958
Do not shoot, it's Jacques.

548
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,750
And? Everything went well?

549
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:02,625
Kill these guys Germans?

550
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:05,625
Yes, I suppose so.

551
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:07,708
And they eat them.

552
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:12,667
How did you find us.
- You have left traces everywhere.

553
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:16,583
Is everybody ready?
Good. Then we go.

554
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:31,583
We have a tank and a halftrack.

555
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:37,750
Maybe 12-15 infantry.
- Are we, or do we wait?

556
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:43,667
No, we have a task to accomplish.

557
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:46,667
A few men and a lot of problems.

558
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,417
We need that tank off.

559
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,542
That will not be easy.

560
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,250
We must destroy that tank.
Can we count on you?

561
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:03,042
This is our country.
Course we help you.

562
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:07,958
Stay here on this ridge.
Then can you halftrack flank.

563
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:11,167
I want you out firing rifle grenades.
- Understood.

564
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:17,000
I, Rossi, Philippe, we go to the
riverbed. Wait until they pass.

565
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:20,583
And then we accompany them on their left.
Clear?

566
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:23,500
Then we have that tank off.

567
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:27,458
What we have for that tank?
- A surprise.

568
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:30,542
A magnetic charge.
This is perfect.

569
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,250
You, come with us.

570
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:34,750
Jacques.

571
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:40,208
Take it.

572
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:42,333
For luck.

573
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,125
Thank you.

574
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:44,042
Wait until they disappear.
Not before.

575
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:11,917
Everybody out.

576
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,750
Fast.
- In coverage.

577
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:10,167
Go left!

578
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:27,458
I need that tank to get you.

579
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:37,292
Lie!

580
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:17,792
Warning.
In coverage remain.

581
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,167
Do you...

582
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,917
I do not recommend for a medal.

583
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:32,500
You have a medic needed.
Medic!

584
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,500
Is okay.

585
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,583
You're a bad liar.

586
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:41,125
Is okay.

587
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,250
Grenade!

588
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,833
Do not go.
I'll get you out of here.

589
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,458
I'll get you out of here.

590
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:07,792
I do not recommend for a medal.
- Do not go. I'm getting you out of here.

591
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:16,500
Dad, I think I know what I must do.
I feel it.

592
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:21,167
If you feel the calling to serve,
you should follow it.

593
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:26,792
I enlisted in the paratroopers.

594
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:30,792
God does not want you die
in some foxhole.

595
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:40,875
I'm a parachutist.
I am a commando.

596
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,458
I jump with a parachute from any plane in flight.

597
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:48,500
I give this to me as a volunteer...

598
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:56,333
I'll have to come get you.

599
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:59,792
I'm sorry.

600
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:04,875
Close your eyes.

601
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:07,458
Close your eyes.

602
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:09,792
Close your eyes.

603
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,042
Close your eyes.

604
01:09:21,917 --> 01:09:24,667
Remember me that you hold.

605
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:31,250
Remember me that you hold.

606
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,750
And then you breathe.

607
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:42,958
And then you breathe.

608
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:04,167
I've wound as best connected.

609
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:07,667
But I had no relationship.

610
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,917
How do you feel?

611
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,125
It tastes good.

612
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:53,167
Please, take some.

613
01:16:07,417 --> 01:16:09,833
You need to eat.

614
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:12,542
You should be healthy again.

615
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,083
Eat.

616
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,333
Food.

617
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,125
Eat.

618
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:47,167
Usually, it's terrible.

619
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,750
But if you have not eaten for days...

620
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:54,125
Then it's not so bad.

621
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:08,375
My name is Erich Neuman.

622
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:13,167
Erich.

623
01:17:15,417 --> 01:17:16,917
And you?

624
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,833
What is your name?

625
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:28,417
Your name?

626
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:42,125
Are you an officer?

627
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:44,125
Excuse?

628
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,000
I do not know what you mean.

629
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:51,583
Your stripes.
Officer?

630
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:55,083
Officer, yes.

631
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,833
This is my brother.

632
01:18:21,042 --> 01:18:23,792
He has learned English.

633
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:26,708
He's interpreter.

634
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:32,500
A translator.

635
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:39,750
He tried to persuade me
to learn English.

636
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,417
This is your brother?

637
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,792
Yes.

638
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:50,667
Can he English?
- Yes.

639
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:57,917
Where is he?

640
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:03,792
Where?

641
01:19:07,417 --> 01:19:09,708
He's...

642
01:19:09,792 --> 01:19:12,500
He was killed in Italy.

643
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,917
Italy?

644
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:20,458
Then he lucky.

645
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:22,917
I've been to Italy.

646
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,708
Is he still there?

647
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:32,917
He's dead.

648
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:36,292
What?

649
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:43,833
Death.

650
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:54,208
I had a friend...

651
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,625
Together with me in Italy.

652
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:04,167
He was my best friend.

653
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:13,708
I do not even know why I'm talking to you.

654
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:17,708
I do not know if you understand me.

655
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:25,667
I promised his mother...

656
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:29,500
I would keep him safe.

657
01:20:44,708 --> 01:20:47,667
Do you have a family?

658
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:52,667
Yes.
- Yes, kids?

659
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:56,000
I have a son.

660
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:59,000
Do you have a picture of him?

661
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:19,292
Is this your son?

662
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:26,875
He's wearing your uniform.

663
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:41,000
I hate that uniform.

664
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:52,125
And I'm supposed to hate you too.

665
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,542
I'm supposed to want to kill you.

666
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:12,875
Do you miss your brother?

667
01:22:17,917 --> 01:22:20,792
And would you not kill me?

668
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:34,417
I...

669
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:36,542
'm...

670
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:40,958
Tired.

671
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,000
I'm too tired.

672
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,667
Sorry.

673
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:53,958
High from heaven.
On rocks and hills...

674
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:58,125
Sees both of us...

675
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:01,667
And keeps us safe.

676
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,583
Elsa!

677
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,792
Uli.

678
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:26,083
You make me think of my son.

679
01:25:56,208 --> 01:25:58,833
Someone's coming.
Wake up.

680
01:26:14,042 --> 01:26:16,250
Wake up.

681
01:26:17,792 --> 01:26:19,542
Wake up.

682
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:22,792
Democracy - Lafayette.

683
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,708
I'm coming.

684
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:31,292
He's wounded. We are only two of us.

685
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:33,792
Captain, everything is safe.

686
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:47,417
That's been there.

687
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:49,583
Corporal...

688
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:52,375
Have you shot him.

689
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,458
No, I did not.

690
01:26:57,083 --> 01:27:02,125
We have a wounded soldier.
Remove the medic.

691
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:19,917
Captain, he's my prisoner.

692
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:23,208
So I find that I toehoort.

693
01:27:25,417 --> 01:27:27,000
Also good.

694
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:30,250
This is a beautiful Luger.

695
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,667
I want you to inform the emergency room.
Let them know we're coming with injuries.

696
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:45,333
How did you do with the progress report?
- It's almost done.

697
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:46,625
Excuse me.

698
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,167
Can you tell me whether Sergeant Caleb Jones
was brought here?

699
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,833
Jones?

700
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:03,667
Jones, wounded, transferred to a
first aid in Draguignan.

701
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:10,458
And Harland Curtis?

702
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:13,792
This is a corporal.
- Corporal Curtis...

703
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:17,625
"K".

704
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:25,792
I'll be back.

705
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,792
You have nothing.

706
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:39,417
Is there anyone else with you?

707
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,167
No.

708
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:45,125
But they have destroyed the tank.

709
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:50,125
I thought you'd want.

710
01:29:51,333 --> 01:29:54,042
Is this Curtis?

711
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:58,083
Thanks, Emilie.

712
01:29:58,917 --> 01:30:01,333
Emilie's not my real name.

713
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:05,208
Yes, I know.

714
01:30:07,917 --> 01:30:10,250
Do you have a real name?

715
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:26,000
I'm sorry. Can you wait outside,
I need him further care.

716
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,458
I'm sorry about your family.

717
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,917
I'm sorry about your friends.

718
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:21,708
Can it?

719
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:31,125
In memory of Harland "Bud" Curtis
and the brave men of the 517de PRCT.
