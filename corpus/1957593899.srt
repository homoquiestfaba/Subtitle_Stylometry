00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:04,566
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:19,570
(medieval instrumental music)

3
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:22,887
(swords clanging)

4
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,080
(heroic orchestral music)

5
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:18,176
- Sir Lancelot, I yield!

6
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,920
Well fought.

7
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,980
- You do me honor, Sir Gawain.

8
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,250
It is King Arthur's good fortune

9
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,430
to count thee among his
best and bravest knights.

10
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,010
- Lady Vivian.

11
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,990
Why comes the Merlin's witch?

12
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,670
- Forget thee not,

13
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,020
she is my guardian mother.

14
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,890
- You are looking well, Lancelot.

15
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,990
- Greetings, my lady.

16
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,680
We are well met.

17
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,740
What brings you to Camelot?

18
00:04:57,232 --> 00:05:00,649
(light orchestral music)

19
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,650
- What does the Merlin wish?

20
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,090
- He commands that I accept the quest

21
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,150
which only I may hazard.

22
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,590
The fate of the realm
depends on my success.

23
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:27,180
- The Sword of Glamis
has been kept for you

24
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,310
for this very day.

25
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,885
It is a weapon of great power.

26
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:34,802
(magical whirring)

27
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:46,464
(sword whooshing)

28
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,430
(soft orchestral music)

29
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,910
To accept this quest, place
this ring on thy finger.

30
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,560
It is from the Merlin.

31
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:35,128
- Sir Lancelot.

32
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:40,010
You would honor me to
accompany you on this quest.

33
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,500
Your fellow knight and friend.

34
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,280
- Brave Sir Gawain, my thanks.

35
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:48,993
The Merlin awaits.

36
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,175
(exciting orchestral music)

37
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:33,970
(thunder crashing)

38
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,464
(soft orchestral music)

39
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,630
- [Gawain] Was not this village burned?

40
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,130
- Aye, by the command of
the sorcerer Wolvencroft.

41
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:57,510
But forget thee not, by the Merlin's spell

42
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,197
we travel in a time before Arthur is king.

43
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:02,780
- Might not the castle fiends
still haunt this place?

44
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,240
- Aye, and the sorcerer Wolvencroft

45
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,260
may yet inhabit the castle Raven's Keep.

46
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,093
Come!

47
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:18,258
(donkey braying)

48
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,776
(cow mooing)

49
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,693
(thunder crashing)

50
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:46,501
(chanting in foreign language)

51
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:50,084
(intense orchestral music)

52
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,310
- You must leave this place!

53
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,790
- Come on, my horse will carry us both.

54
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,989
- No, Lancelot!

55
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,810
You must go and fulfill the quest!

56
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,500
- She'll never forgive you if
you die in battle without me!

57
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,180
- A sad day when a
Knight of the Round Table

58
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,263
cannot fare such as thee.

59
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:14,957
Now go!

60
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:24,468
(laughing) Come on, come on!

61
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:28,051
(flowing orchestral music)

62
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:49,043
(thunder crashing)

63
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,803
- Wolvencroft!

64
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:03,230
- Sir Lancelot, welcome to Raven's Keep.

65
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,370
Or, shall I say, welcome to the past.

66
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,180
I presume that meddling
old wizard sent you.

67
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,285
He is the Merlin of Britain,

68
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:15,510
and I am come at his behest.

69
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,390
I am come for the young
squire that you have stolen.

70
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:23,996
- (gasps) Could this be the
young squire that you seek?

71
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,980
Well, as you can see, he his quite safe.

72
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,270
But you may not have him.

73
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,100
Stay where you are, sir,

74
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,180
or I shall finish off the boy's life now

75
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,940
and the future will be decided.

76
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,750
- I have seen the future of Britain.

77
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,620
Like thee, I live within that time.

78
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,860
Here all this is but a
shade of things past.

79
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,710
- You fool, you think the
future cannot be changed?

80
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,450
- How can that be
changed which already is?

81
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,240
- Do you not understand who that boy is?

82
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,850
What future power lies
quite truly in his hands?

83
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,333
You know nothing?

84
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,880
Oh, by the gods.

85
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,740
The Merlin has brought
you here in ignorance!

86
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:15,015
Go back to your time, sir.

87
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:16,370
(laughing)

88
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,120
Go back to your Merlin.

89
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,890
There will be no shame in it.

90
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,280
If the old wizard wishes a fair encounter,

91
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,270
let him come see me himself.

92
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,100
- I have come to free the
young squire, Wolvencroft,

93
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,384
and so I shall.

94
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,634
(grunting)

95
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,730
Release the boy, and I will let thee live.

96
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,670
The Merlin has so instructed me.

97
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,260
- The Merlin is weak and bent with age.

98
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,800
What use his power if not used?

99
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,510
- Yield the boy, Wolvencroft.

100
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,460
- Consider this, Lancelot.

101
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:59,818
I can grant thee a future
beyond thy wildest dreams.

102
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,250
Would you wish to be king?

103
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,400
Oh, I could use a swordsman such as you.

104
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,330
Your skills are very noteworthy.

105
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,933
No?

106
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:16,777
Pity.

107
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:20,628
(squealing)

108
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:23,057
(swords clanging)

109
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:26,640
(intense orchestral music)

110
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,690
- You'll find me a more worthy opponent.

111
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,740
- Another time.

112
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:25,383
(chanting in foreign language)

113
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:30,718
Wolvencroft!

114
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,503
Reach, squire!

115
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:33,875
Reach, boy!

116
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,755
- You are too late. (mumbles)

117
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:36,588
You have failed.

118
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:37,861
- Never.

119
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:38,694
Reach, boy!

120
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:39,861
Reach, squire!

121
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,633
Reach, squire!

122
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:42,672
Reach, boy!

123
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:43,505
Reach, squire!

124
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:46,467
(thunder crashing)

125
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:50,134
(dramatic orchestral music)

126
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:10,621
(soft orchestral music)

127
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,110
- So they've got you on
carousel duty today, eh?

128
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,040
- And it's hard work, let me tell you.

129
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,013
- Well?

130
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:34,636
The book?

131
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,230
- [Liz] I finished it last night.

132
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,063
- And?

133
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,550
- Wow.

134
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,693
- You like it?

135
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:44,443
- (laughs) Yeah.

136
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,400
Katherine, it is a terrific book.

137
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,140
I wouldn't change a word of it.

138
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,910
Maybe one or two, but that's it.

139
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,370
- You don't think it's too
hard on the male population?

140
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,760
- Men of Romance: Myth and Reality.

141
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,250
It's a little cynical
from my point of view,

142
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,470
but cynicism sells.

143
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,730
- I don't know, I don't
think it's cynical.

144
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,460
I think I'm just being honest.

145
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,320
- Come on, really?

146
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,220
- What happened to all the chivalrous men?

147
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,540
What happened to men who
cherish us, treasure us?

148
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,350
- I think we killed them
off with radical feminism.

149
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,960
- Well, I still have hope

150
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,586
that there's at least
one somewhere out there.

151
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:23,370
(magical whooshing)

152
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,870
- Hey, what the...

153
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,570
- I regret that once again
we may not match swords.

154
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,101
(phone ringing)

155
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:41,939
- Somebody's gotta talk to me.

156
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:42,772
- Well, of course.

157
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:43,605
This is precisely the reason

158
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:44,730
why I don't own one of these things.

159
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,220
- Yeah, well I wish we could go back

160
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,896
to the days with no phones.

161
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:48,860
- I wish.

162
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,970
- Can you give me just a second?

163
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,980
- Yeah, go ahead.

164
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,280
- [Liz] Yeah.

165
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,113
No, that's fine.

166
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,530
Friday.

167
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,390
Hi, this is Liz.

168
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,794
Right, no, that's when we...

169
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:02,483
- Are they filming a movie here?

170
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,610
- I don't know, I don't think so.

171
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,643
It's LA.

172
00:17:05,643 --> 00:17:06,476
(mumbling)

173
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:07,510
No, no, no.

174
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,520
Of course.

175
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,740
- Why swear you allegiance to Wolvencroft?

176
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,912
He has abused the ancient ways,

177
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,640
betrayed his vows of power.

178
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,360
- And you serve the great Merlin,

179
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,460
a toothless old woman.

180
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,158
Here.

181
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,530
Give this to your Merlin.

182
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,083
(horse whinnying)

183
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,990
He will know its meaning.

184
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,871
- Where is the young squire, Blackpool?

185
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:46,309
- I fear you shall never know.

186
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,309
(magical whooshing)

187
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,763
- No, no, no.

188
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:59,133
Sorry.

189
00:17:59,133 --> 00:17:59,966
What?

190
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:02,030
- I just saw a great
looking guy on a horse.

191
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,870
- Where?

192
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,540
- I don't know, he was
just there a second ago.

193
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,850
- Mmm-hmm.

194
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,975
- I'm going crazy, aren't I?

195
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:10,280
(laughs) Either that or I'm
just hungry, I don't know.

196
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,880
- I think you're hungry.

197
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,210
You're gonna sign this for me, right?

198
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,043
- Of course I will.

199
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:15,600
- Thank you.

200
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,570
Come on, let's go.

201
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,780
Let's eat.

202
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,120
You know what?

203
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,030
I do think they exist.

204
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,770
- I'm still hoping there's at
least one out there somewhere.

205
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,490
- Oh, a closet romantic?

206
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,913
(hooves clopping)

207
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,783
- Pardon, sir.

208
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,570
Pardon, sir, I require assistance.

209
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,403
- Just a minute.

210
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,430
(soft orchestral music)

211
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,263
Whoa!

212
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,460
- I seek another who
has arrived as I have.

213
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,630
- Nice outfit!

214
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,780
Hey dude, do you need a
permit to ride that horse?

215
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,350
- Sir, the information
I seek is desperate.

216
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,460
- Hey, is this stuff real?

217
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,850
I mean, like authentic?

218
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,150
- [Lancelot] Sir, Wolvencroft is his name.

219
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,040
- Wow, because it's
great, I mean that sword,

220
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,650
I mean, it's incredible, that
sword is really incredible!

221
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,690
- His name is Wolvencroft!

222
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,660
- Hey, you know, beach weather
must play heck with it,

223
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,980
I mean, how do you keep it from
rusting and stuff like that?

224
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,300
- Sir, you must attend me.

225
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,760
A boy's life is in danger.

226
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,560
- Okay, all right, okay, okay, calm down,

227
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,310
take it easy, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

228
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,983
Listen, I'm Michael.

229
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:44,816
Mike to my friends.

230
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,100
You know, come to think of it,

231
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,060
I really don't have so many, so...

232
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,510
I'm glad to meet you, what
did you say your name was?

233
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,730
- I am Sir Lancelot du Lac.

234
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,520
- Yeah, okay, why not, I'll play.

235
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,960
- Sir, there is no time for playing.

236
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,360
A boy's life is in danger.

237
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,050
In this place, where do
the men of power reside?

238
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,930
- Reside?

239
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,100
You know, I'm not really even
sure who the men of power are,

240
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,220
to tell you the truth.

241
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,460
Listen, don't look so surprised.

242
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,720
You know, some people don't keep track

243
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,640
of that kind of thing.

244
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,040
You know, I don't even
like the 20th century!

245
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,560
- What?

246
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,981
What year say you?

247
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:18,814
- What do you mean?

248
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:20,030
It's the 20th century.

249
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,470
- Say you that we stand
within the 20th century?

250
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,303
- Yeah.

251
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:29,070
- Know you of King Arthur
and his Round Table?

252
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,530
- Aye, yeah, I grew up on all that stuff.

253
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,180
You know, King Arthur and Robin Hood

254
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,010
and the Knights of the Round Table,

255
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,930
and damsels in distress,
and all that kind of thing.

256
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,140
- The wizard will have chosen
his time and place carefully.

257
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,179
- Oh, now there's a wizard?

258
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:42,491
- Aye, Wolvencroft.

259
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,950
He will have positioned
himself with priests and kings.

260
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,990
Where do these men reside?

261
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,850
- Priests and kings?

262
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,180
I have no clue.

263
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,810
You know, but I'll tell
you what, my sister might.

264
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,643
You know what I mean?

265
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:54,310
She keeps up on all the who's
who in the world and stuff.

266
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,880
- Then perhaps our meeting
was no mere coincidence.

267
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,980
We must not tarry.

268
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,750
- Okay.

269
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,990
Alright, well I'll tell you what,

270
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,800
let's go grab a cup of cappuccino,

271
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,880
then we'll go check with
my sister, all right?

272
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,810
- Pray--
- What?

273
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,830
- What place is this?

274
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,810
- Venice, why?

275
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,270
- Nay, Vinaccia?

276
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,390
Say you so?

277
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,223
- Yeah!

278
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:15,600
- Be these the famed blue
waters of the Mediterranean?

279
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,900
- Mediterranean?

280
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,830
No, man, this is the Pacific!

281
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,750
It's Venice, you know, it's California.

282
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,100
Where do you think you are?

283
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,160
Come on, let's go.

284
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,286
(eagle screeching)

285
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,427
(tense orchestral music)

286
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,420
- You're certain?

287
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,660
Lancelot is returned?

288
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,860
- Oh, indeed, milord.

289
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,930
I did use the spell as you instructed.

290
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,360
- I have warned you, you may
call me sir, or Mr. Wolf,

291
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,080
but milord is unacceptable.

292
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,780
- My apologies, sir.

293
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,300
- And the newspaper?

294
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,940
The knight has taken it with him?

295
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,180
- Oh yes.

296
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,130
- Then, by the gods, I have the Merlin.

297
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,320
- How so, milord?

298
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,889
Sir.

299
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:22,806
(electric zapping)

300
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,640
How so, Mr. Wolf?

301
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,300
- When Lancelot discovers that he

302
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,790
has returned to Arthur's court,

303
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,620
he will report to Merlin,
and bring the newspaper.

304
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,070
Will he not?

305
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,320
- Then it is a trap to
bring the Merlin here.

306
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,700
- Quite so.

307
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,170
Then I will have the boy and his wizard,

308
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,470
and here they shall remain.

309
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,750
- And all that is Camelot, will it vanish?

310
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,971
- As a mist in the wind.

311
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,430
(laughing)

312
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,263
Understand?

313
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,930
I have grasped the use of time,

314
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,490
and snatched back history.

315
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,260
They are mine to do with as I wish.

316
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,370
- And without Arthur, the
sword remains in the stone.

317
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:09,460
There will be centuries of chaos!

318
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,520
- Chaos is my hunting ground.

319
00:23:12,931 --> 00:23:15,681
(birds chirping)

320
00:23:20,897 --> 00:23:23,980
(electronic beeping)

321
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,100
- Everything has changed, and yet,

322
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,950
I see so much that is familiar.

323
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:46,950
- Here it comes, here it comes.

324
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,700
Lance, come here, look, this is it.

325
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,093
This is it.

326
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,090
- This box.

327
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,710
It can foretell the future?

328
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,060
- No, no, just the present.

329
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:02,266
(humming)

330
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,099
(horse whinnying)

331
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,440
- Michael Anthony Shelley,
could you please come down here?

332
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,780
- Oh lord, the horse.

333
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,780
She's gonna kill me.

334
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,063
- Should I?

335
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:17,610
- No, no, no, just stay here.

336
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,443
It's safer.

337
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,943
- [Katherine] Michael?

338
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:28,776
- Yeah?

339
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:29,609
- Got a question for you.

340
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:30,442
- Okay.

341
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:31,770
- What's that?
- What's what?

342
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,180
- That large thing.

343
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,480
- That?

344
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,840
- Yeah.

345
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,673
- It's a horse.

346
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:44,850
(electronic beeping)

347
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,150
- Yes, thank you for clarifying that.

348
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:46,983
I realize it's a horse.

349
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:48,766
I'm just kind of curious as
to what that horse is doing

350
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:51,020
in our garden, eating my flowers?

351
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,110
- Uh, it's hungry.

352
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,943
- That's great.

353
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:55,070
Who does this horse belong to?

354
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,200
- It belongs to our guest.

355
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,260
- We have a guest with a horse?

356
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,170
- [Michael] Uh, well...

357
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,220
- Lady Katherine.

358
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:02,980
(light instrumental music)

359
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,580
I am Lancelot du Lac.

360
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,650
Of thee Michael has spoken,

361
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,470
but the vision of thee far
surpasses his kindest praise.

362
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,410
- Michael...

363
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,860
- He told you you look great.

364
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,800
- I grieve to have
caused you any distress,

365
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,700
but I humbly request indulgence.

366
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:23,529
Michael?

367
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,643
- Look, look--

368
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:27,107
- Michael, if this is a joke,
I'm not in the mood at all.

369
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:28,700
- Just listen for just a second.

370
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,230
This incredible thing happened to me today

371
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,063
you would never believe.

372
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,040
- [Katherine] I can hardly
wait to hear this one.

373
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,348
- [Michael] You would never believe.

374
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:36,265
(eagle screeching)

375
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,670
(phone ringing)

376
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,503
- Yes?

377
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Very well, I'll be waiting.

378
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,050
It'll be soon be here, Merlin.

379
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,660
I have your precious Arthur,

380
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,590
and soon, your precious stone.

381
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,423
- Come on, Kat.

382
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:03,770
What if his story's true?

383
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,110
What if it's possible?

384
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,410
Just think about it, all right?

385
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,500
Just think about it!

386
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,400
What an incredible
adventure this could be,

387
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
and we could be part of it.

388
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,290
- You've been designing one
too many computer games, Mike.

389
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,720
Look, I'm just having a little
bit of a hard time with this.

390
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,650
I'm trying to absorb it all.

391
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,740
- Alright, well just this once.

392
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,430
Just this once, for me,
think with your heart,

393
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,100
and don't try to dissect everything.

394
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,190
- I'm gonna give it a shot, all right?

395
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,640
Let me get this straight now.

396
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,083
You are--

397
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,690
- Lancelot of Camelot.

398
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,880
Knight of the Round Table.

399
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,713
And the Merlin--

400
00:26:34,713 --> 00:26:36,000
- The Merlin sent you back to a time

401
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,420
before Arthur was a king

402
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,250
so that you could track
down this other wizard.

403
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,220
- Aye, Wolvencroft.

404
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,800
A most vile fiend.

405
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,000
- Now Wolvencroft, he's the
one who kidnapped the boy.

406
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,270
- And by his hand, here
I am in your 20th century

407
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,620
to find the boy and return
him unto Merlin's care.

408
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,770
- Didn't you say that this Wolvencroft

409
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,400
wore a very distinctive ring?

410
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,550
- A ring in the shape of a wolf's head,

411
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,930
and a dragon claw pendant
clutching a black crystal.

412
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,610
Both are sources of great power.

413
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,550
- Is that how he got here?

414
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,790
- Michael, please, you're
getting a little bit

415
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,000
carried away here, aren't you?

416
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,100
This is impossible.

417
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,400
- And yet, here I am.

418
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:17,696
And Wolvencroft's theft is
a danger to all of Britain.

419
00:27:17,696 --> 00:27:19,696
What more need you know?

420
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,860
- Okay, how about who is this kid,

421
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,740
and why would Wolvencroft
choose to take him

422
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,680
from a time from your own past,

423
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,847
and why am I asking you silly questions?

424
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,267
- Blackpool charged me,
"Show this to the Merlin."

425
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:50,970
- Arthur...

426
00:27:55,477 --> 00:27:56,310
Arthur...

427
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,523
Arthur...

428
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:12,762
Arthur...

429
00:28:19,342 --> 00:28:20,175
- Merlin?

430
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,190
- This was meant for the Merlin.

431
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,860
Wolvencroft shows him what is to be.

432
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,693
Why?

433
00:28:42,693 --> 00:28:43,900
- And check out the date!

434
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,380
- Yeah, but this can't be right, Michael.

435
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,510
The sword is still in the stone.

436
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,730
- I could not find
anything, nothing at all,

437
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,110
on the museum's antiquities expert, okay?

438
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,520
He sets up the whole exhibit,

439
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,170
but he just seems to
pop up out of nowhere.

440
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,150
Kind of like you, Lance.

441
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,770
- This place of the
antiquities, where is it?

442
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,180
If the sword is there, there
shall I find the sorcerer.

443
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,730
- Alright, well hold on,
because it's closed now,

444
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,030
but we should definitely
check it out tomorrow.

445
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,240
Lance, when was this sword
first pulled from the stone?

446
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,370
- On the first day of the new year

447
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,330
when the abbey bells chimed the 12th hour.

448
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,800
- Well that's tomorrow.

449
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,980
First day of the new year.

450
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,680
- Only the rightful King Arthur

451
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,380
may draw the sword from the stone.

452
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,370
I search for a boy.

453
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,300
- A squire.

454
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,133
No name.

455
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,053
- Arthur.

456
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,670
- And didn't the Merlin
send you back to a time

457
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,000
before Arthur was king?

458
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,440
- So you're saying that
this boy is Arthur?

459
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,153
The Arthur?

460
00:29:37,153 --> 00:29:39,080
And that Wolvencroft has changed history?

461
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,860
Come on, that's impossible.

462
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,830
- But it hasn't changed yet, Kat.

463
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,850
It's still only a possibility
if Wolvencroft succeeds.

464
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,760
- Succeeds at what?

465
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,110
- Succeeds in uniting the sword of power

466
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,310
with Arthur of Britain,

467
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,900
in a time far removed from
Merlin's power and protection.

468
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:04,265
Wolvencroft, thou art a demon.

469
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:21,580
- The sword that was forged when the world

470
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,930
was yearning with power

471
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,820
to unite a nation and build a legend.

472
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,783
Mine!

473
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:33,740
I have the sword, I have the boy.

474
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,768
These things the Merlin cannot,

475
00:30:35,768 --> 00:30:37,518
need must not ignore.

476
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:40,776
- When will he come?

477
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:42,430
- Soon.

478
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,660
At noon tomorrow.

479
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,230
He has no choice, when
the boy draws the sword

480
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,100
and all that is past is undone.

481
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,903
Then...

482
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,960
Then time will be mine.

483
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:01,631
And I will decide what is to be.

484
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,580
- Whence comes this vision?

485
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,413
What means it?

486
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:38,246
- Check this out.

487
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,850
- This gift of conjuring
is truly wondrous.

488
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,040
In my day, only the
Merlin had such a glass

489
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,050
for seeing beyond the here and now.

490
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,650
- Trust me, Merlin's gift is a lot better.

491
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,990
Nowadays everybody's got one of these,

492
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,610
and you can only see what
the guys on the other end

493
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,770
want you to see.

494
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:58,730
- Aye, but is that not always
the truth with a vision?

495
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,780
The seer may receive
only that which is sent.

496
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,880
The seer may not demand more.

497
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,230
- You started this, why
don't you explain it to him?

498
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,920
- Okay, well, without having
to go through centuries of--

499
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:12,870
- Can you not see him?

500
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,870
The man I seek.

501
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,141
- Is that Wolvencroft?

502
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:16,974
- Aye.

503
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:18,270
The sorcerer himself.

504
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,300
- Look, it's the ring!

505
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,980
It's just as he described it.

506
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,840
- We may lose all if we hesitate.

507
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,350
- Do either of you have a plan?

508
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,960
- Well, we're working on it.

509
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,360
- There's no time to spare.

510
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,330
- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

511
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,360
You can't go out on the
street with a sword like that.

512
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,608
- I'm prepared, and the
Merlin bad may be quick.

513
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:37,386
- Well then you're gonna get arrested.

514
00:32:37,386 --> 00:32:39,610
- These are indeed strange times.

515
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,830
- You're just asking
for trouble like that.

516
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,710
- Perhaps it is not seemly for the lady

517
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,870
to be further involved.

518
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,260
- Whoops.

519
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,270
- Please, I'm coming along

520
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,120
so neither of you do anything stupid!

521
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,087
- She's warming up.

522
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:58,793
(cars honking)

523
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:01,626
(loud rock music)

524
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:34,300
- Somebody answer me this.

525
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,250
Unlike my brother, I am a
rational, reasonable human being.

526
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:39,690
So what am I doing here?

527
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,380
- Following your heart for once.

528
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,770
- What happens if we don't find Arthur?

529
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,383
- A fate too terrible to contemplate.

530
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,083
- I don't know, guys.

531
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,550
It looks like it's closed.

532
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,380
- This is the place of the antiquities?

533
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,540
- You know what, let's drive around back,

534
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,024
see if we can get in
through the loading dock.

535
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:17,857
- Okay.

536
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:34,557
Here we are.

537
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:37,132
This is the back entrance.

538
00:34:37,132 --> 00:34:40,132
- 'Tis no higher than a castle wall.

539
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:45,650
Wolvencroft.

540
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,660
- Take it easy.

541
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,010
He's not gonna go anywhere.

542
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,220
- Look, I've got an idea.

543
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,810
Why don't I keep him busy
while you look for Arthur?

544
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,090
- Be sure, Katherine.

545
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,210
Wolvencroft is a most dangerous adversary.

546
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,630
- I wrote the book on his type, remember?

547
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,020
- Thy books will be of little avail

548
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,520
should he discover the
true purpose of thy intent.

549
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,740
- I'll be okay.

550
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,460
- Let's give Kat five minutes,

551
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,910
then we'll slip in after her.

552
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,950
Don't worry, she can handle this guy.

553
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:07,562
- Hello, Wolf.

554
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:08,395
- Yes?

555
00:36:08,395 --> 00:36:09,860
- How do you do, I'm Katherine Shelley.

556
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,820
- [Wolvencroft] How do you do?

557
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,960
- I was wondering, could I
have a moment alone with you?

558
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,870
- How may I help you, Katherine Shelley?

559
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:28,530
- We're good to go.

560
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,600
- What?

561
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,570
What say you, good to...

562
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,460
- Uh, by thee hence.

563
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,400
- Aye.

564
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,380
- And I'm researching for a new book idea

565
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,858
on influential men in the 20th century.

566
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:54,025
- (chuckles) And you've
chosen me, an unknown scholar?

567
00:36:55,185 --> 00:36:58,185
Very interesting, could you explain?

568
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,750
- I was just thinking that with
the historical significance

569
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,840
of your latest exhibition,
and your vast knowledge

570
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,190
of medieval British history,

571
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,220
that you would make a fantastic subject.

572
00:37:57,146 --> 00:37:59,500
- Are you sure you're not
here just to see the exhibit?

573
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,538
- [Katherine] Well, I must
admit that I'm fascinated

574
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:05,350
by the legend of the sword in the stone.

575
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,360
- Hey, Hercules!

576
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,802
Which way to New Jersey?

577
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:09,849
- Hey, you're not supposed to be in here!

578
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:10,911
- Do you know where New Jersey is?

579
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:11,890
- Yeah, I know where New Jersey is!

580
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,880
- Legend has it that as long
as the sword in the stone

581
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,600
remain on English soil,

582
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,560
they are protected by
an ancient enchantment.

583
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,393
- So you mean to tell me

584
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:22,570
that this is the first time in history

585
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,850
that they're actually unprotected?

586
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,683
- Yes.

587
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,740
Tantalizing thought, is it not?

588
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,417
- That's a fascinating
ring, is that an antique?

589
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:36,190
- You might call it a family heirloom.

590
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,330
- Down the door to the left.

591
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,163
- Would you mind showing me?

592
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:39,272
- Absolutely, right this way.

593
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:40,200
- [Michael] This way?

594
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,033
- [Worker] Yeah.

595
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:42,731
- [Michael] Thank you very much.

596
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:46,148
(light orchestral music)

597
00:40:03,954 --> 00:40:05,287
- Aye, a forest!

598
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,370
Praise the gods!

599
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:28,175
(squealing)

600
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,770
- It's funny, I've always been
interested in antiquities.

601
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,540
The reason why I want
this exhibition in my book

602
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,830
is because I'm really interested

603
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,130
in British history particularly.

604
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:41,980
- Enough.

605
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,670
You've convinced me that
you may be a writer,

606
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,100
but why are you here?

607
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,060
- I was sent.

608
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,893
- By whom?

609
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,113
- By Merlin.

610
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,790
- What name did thee speak?

611
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,620
- What name did thee speak?

612
00:42:05,463 --> 00:42:06,296
Lancelot.

613
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,127
- Lancelot!

614
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:26,210
(exciting orchestral music)

615
00:42:44,284 --> 00:42:46,001
Disarm him, but kill him not.

616
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:47,584
He is needed alive!

617
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,210
- What have thee done with
the young squire Arthur?

618
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,420
- Well, as you can see, he is not here.

619
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,670
I fear that once again you are too late.

620
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,920
Arthur's destiny is but a few hours away.

621
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,940
The course of history is shifting.

622
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,278
- You steal him from
a time that needs him.

623
00:43:38,278 --> 00:43:39,780
- Ah, yes.

624
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,370
And because of that, I
have in my grasp today

625
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,940
power beyond measure, which
only the young squire may unlock

626
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,740
at the appointed time.

627
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,907
- You dare to speak of the
sword in the stone, traitor?

628
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,180
- Go to your Merlin.

629
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,290
Bid him come challenge me face to face.

630
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:03,224
(roaring)

631
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,680
- For Katherine's freedom,

632
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,710
and your word that we may leave in safety,

633
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,880
I shall return the crystal.

634
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:05,623
- Done.

635
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,497
- Once again, your twisted
fate has saved you.

636
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:27,469
Go!

637
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:38,580
- It does appear that
Lancelot is still with us,

638
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,420
does it not?

639
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,630
- I did use the spell.

640
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:43,380
- I despise disappointment.

641
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,951
(magical whooshing)

642
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,900
Not very original, I'm afraid.

643
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:56,808
(sighing)

644
00:45:56,808 --> 00:45:58,225
It'll do for now.

645
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,503
(medieval instrumental music)

646
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,932
(tense instrumental music)

647
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,870
- Hey, what happened?

648
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:16,703
Didn't you find him?

649
00:46:16,703 --> 00:46:17,870
- Wolvencroft said Arthur wasn't there,

650
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:18,703
but I think he's lying.

651
00:46:18,703 --> 00:46:20,180
He must be.

652
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,210
- Lies become the bitter truth

653
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,220
if on the morrow Arthur
fulfills his destiny

654
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,750
and draws the sword from the stone.

655
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,630
- Well what happens if
Wolvencroft succeeds,

656
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,010
how can that help him?

657
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,820
Wasn't the sword meant
to be used for good?

658
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,690
- As the blade is double
edged, so cuts the sword.

659
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,760
Either way, for good or evil.

660
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,500
He who controls the
sword controls history.

661
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,184
We have but one day to write
that which shall last forever.

662
00:46:37,184 --> 00:46:40,003
(thunder crashing)

663
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:44,760
- My dealings with Merlin must
be postponed, but no matter.

664
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,860
In time, in time.

665
00:46:46,751 --> 00:46:48,800
(toad croaking)

666
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,700
All is in place for the morrow.

667
00:47:00,532 --> 00:47:03,115
(bell ringing)

668
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:10,845
The squire is what?

669
00:47:15,951 --> 00:47:19,076
(magical zapping)

670
00:47:19,076 --> 00:47:20,826
When did this happen?

671
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,950
- Not long past, sir.

672
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:28,260
- You had Wolvencroft.

673
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,210
You should have forced him
to tell you where Arthur is.

674
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,750
- Blackpool had you, milady.

675
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:32,680
- Well, I know, but I--

676
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,279
- The chivalric code does not permit

677
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:37,219
the endangering of a woman.

678
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:39,170
- A little old-fashioned, but I like it.

679
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:42,150
- Words of truth are timeless, Katherine.

680
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,190
- Listen, this is all very nice,

681
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,140
but what are we gonna do about the kid?

682
00:47:47,601 --> 00:47:50,934
(soft orchestral music)

683
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,660
- [Wolvencroft] Where
would one such as he go?

684
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,860
- A place familiar, sir.

685
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,280
Away from that which
he does not understand.

686
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,220
Perhaps a garden or a park.

687
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,210
The park, sir.

688
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,433
- Very clever.

689
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,710
Don't come back until you've found him.

690
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,798
Use whatever means you must.

691
00:48:29,798 --> 00:48:30,965
- Aye, milord.

692
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,350
(people chattering)

693
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,845
(dog barking)

694
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:49,012
(soft medieval music)

695
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:14,786
(grill sizzling)

696
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:24,683
- Hey!

697
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:29,180
Hey, that's our stuff, man.

698
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,147
What are you doing?

699
00:49:31,147 --> 00:49:33,110
- He's jacking our food!

700
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:36,330
- Look, wiener boy, put the
hot dog down, all right?

701
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,780
Put it down!

702
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,790
Look, spaz, put the hot dog down!

703
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:48,030
- That's smooth, AJ.

704
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,460
Hey look, just give us our stuff back

705
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,480
and get the hell out of here.

706
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,380
- Go get him, Joe.

707
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:55,250
Kick his butt!

708
00:50:00,217 --> 00:50:03,217
- Where are you, boy, where are you?

709
00:50:05,674 --> 00:50:09,007
(lively medieval music)

710
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,470
- I have no quarrel with
thee, but by the dragon,

711
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,430
I shall fight thee!

712
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,263
- Yeah?

713
00:50:23,263 --> 00:50:24,096
Bring it on.

714
00:50:24,096 --> 00:50:24,929
- Come on, AJ, just leave him alone.

715
00:50:24,929 --> 00:50:26,680
It's not like he's from around here.

716
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,070
- Look, I don't care what
museum this punk escaped from,

717
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,120
I'm gonna drop him!

718
00:50:32,543 --> 00:50:33,376
- Where...

719
00:50:35,224 --> 00:50:36,350
- Hey, go get him, AJ!

720
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,200
- Shut up, Ricky.

721
00:50:38,183 --> 00:50:40,167
- Give me that!

722
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah!

723
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,255
(fist thudding)

724
00:50:43,255 --> 00:50:44,172
- Hey, hey!

725
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,010
- Do you yield?

726
00:50:48,398 --> 00:50:49,930
- Yield?

727
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:50,930
Dude, who are you?

728
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,150
- One who shall teach
you a lesson in courtesy!

729
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,270
Do you yield?

730
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:56,720
- Yeah, I yield.

731
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,981
Uncle.

732
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:58,814
Uncle!

733
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,863
Nice hook.

734
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,003
My name's AJ.

735
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,000
The guy with the mouth, that's Ricky.

736
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,880
This is Joe.

737
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:14,720
What's your name?

738
00:51:15,696 --> 00:51:16,613
Name, name?

739
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,530
- Arthur.

740
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:20,363
I am Arthur.

741
00:51:20,363 --> 00:51:21,330
- Nice to meet you, bro.

742
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,333
Who's hungry?

743
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:25,393
- [Ricky] I am!

744
00:51:25,393 --> 00:51:27,810
- I'm sure Dutch boy could use a snack.

745
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:28,643
Want to join us?

746
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,463
- Yes!

747
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,470
- Alright, let's go.

748
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:33,720
- That was fun.

749
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,927
- Then did Pendragon
find himself surrounded

750
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:45,260
by the villainous Saxons!

751
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,270
He fought like a lion, and
more than 20 Saxons did die

752
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,980
before the king was slain!

753
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:56,364
Pierced to the heart with a lance...

754
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:58,149
(groaning)

755
00:51:58,149 --> 00:52:00,234
(clapping)

756
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:01,817
- Well played, boy.

757
00:52:03,023 --> 00:52:03,856
Well played.

758
00:52:03,856 --> 00:52:05,740
But now it is time you come with me.

759
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,930
- I have no desire to go with thee.

760
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,270
- Foolish knave.

761
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,610
- Who is this guy, Arthur?

762
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,150
Your parole officer?

763
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,430
- Yeah, what'd you do, break curfew?

764
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,601
He doesn't want to go with you.

765
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,627
Buzz off, buttmunch.

766
00:52:18,627 --> 00:52:20,140
(laughing)

767
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,310
- Brave words.

768
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,863
Fools.

769
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,060
- Leave us, this quarrel is not yours.

770
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,480
- No.

771
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,120
No, it won't be that easy.

772
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,410
Your friends may leave in
safety if you come with me.

773
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,410
- I don't think so.

774
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,300
- I dare not.

775
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,720
Yet your fear must also be great.

776
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,840
You and your creatures
against four weaponless boys?

777
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,910
- Insolent wretch!

778
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,510
I fear no one.

779
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:53,950
- No?

780
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,410
Prove this.

781
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:58,800
If you'll not let us
go, then a fair fight.

782
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,690
If you understand the meaning.

783
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:01,523
- Yeah.

784
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:05,762
(squealing)

785
00:53:07,724 --> 00:53:11,363
- Your friends will pay for your insults.

786
00:53:11,363 --> 00:53:14,946
(intense orchestral music)

787
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:21,799
(fists thudding)

788
00:54:16,161 --> 00:54:19,578
- We gotta get the hell out of here, man!

789
00:54:36,999 --> 00:54:38,010
- Your little friends.

790
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,950
Do you wish them to live?

791
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,610
- My life for these three men.

792
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:44,443
I yield.

793
00:54:50,926 --> 00:54:51,843
- So be it.

794
00:54:55,061 --> 00:54:56,503
- Hey, they're gone!

795
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:57,336
Dude!

796
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,820
- Time as a toad has
improved Blackpool's wits.

797
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,370
- For this treachery, by
the dragon, thee will pay!

798
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,490
- What happened?

799
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:18,810
- How did we get--

800
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,940
- Guys, I think this is one of those

801
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,230
if I didn't see it, you
didn't see it situations.

802
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,710
Am I right?

803
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:27,950
- About what?

804
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,750
- Yeah man, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

805
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,490
- Michael has the gift of many abilities.

806
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:52,057
And you were clever and
bold today, brave Katherine.

807
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,170
If I may take my leave, my lady,

808
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,610
I wish to think on what
has happened this day.

809
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:05,575
- Of course.

810
00:56:18,218 --> 00:56:20,718
(owl hooting)

811
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:25,000
(magical whirring)

812
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,360
- Guardian mother, I know not what to do.

813
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,710
Merlin...

814
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:34,400
What would you have me do?

815
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,330
I know so little of these times.

816
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,980
For all of this you did not prepare me.

817
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:42,930
- [Merlin] Lancelot...

818
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,833
- Merlin.

819
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,470
- Rise, Sir Lancelot, I am here.

820
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,740
You are not lost.

821
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,940
You wear the ring that I may find you.

822
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,010
- I cannot find Arthur.

823
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:09,490
- On the morrow, at the appointed hour,

824
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,740
go to the place of the stone.

825
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,290
There will you find what you seek.

826
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:16,130
- But these times are not mine.

827
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,130
On the morrow perchance
Arthur shall be rescued,

828
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:20,963
but what then?

829
00:57:20,963 --> 00:57:23,700
I know nothing of the
magic that brought me here.

830
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,000
- The black crystal
which Wolvencroft wears.

831
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,960
You have seen it.

832
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,160
This is the key.

833
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,410
Speak the words that I shall tell thee.

834
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,997
The black crystal shall return you

835
00:57:35,997 --> 00:57:38,930
and the boy Arthur to Raven's Keep.

836
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:42,790
Once there, I shall return you to Camelot.

837
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,533
- And the boy?

838
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:48,500
- He must remain in the past.

839
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,630
He awaits his destiny.

840
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,960
The boy Arthur will go
on to build a kingdom

841
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,100
and a legend for all time.

842
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:02,010
Knew you the boy's true identity?

843
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:05,370
- I was not certain until
Wolvencroft confirmed it.

844
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,230
- Yet, your heart remained
true to the quest.

845
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,640
- How could it be otherwise?

846
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,440
- Kneel, noble knight.

847
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:23,900
Listen, and heed what I tell thee now.

848
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:38,895
(soft orchestral music)

849
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,850
- Mind if I join you?

850
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,003
- Please.

851
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,020
It is a true marvel.

852
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:57,170
Here I find myself
centuries from all I know,

853
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,360
and yet, the stars have not changed.

854
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,130
- I don't understand why
Merlin didn't tell you

855
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:03,080
the boy was Arthur.

856
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,200
You've been risking your life,

857
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,370
and you didn't even know why.

858
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,720
- He's a strange one, the Merlin.

859
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,730
No mere mortal.

860
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,210
Perhaps he feared that
even I might succumb

861
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:16,990
to the desire for power.

862
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,900
- No, not you.

863
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,060
It just seems dangerous for you to be here

864
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,400
without any preparation.

865
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,233
- No.

866
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,990
But I was not meant to come so far.

867
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,107
Merlin had commanded me stop
Wolvencroft at his castle.

868
00:59:34,056 --> 00:59:34,889
- I see.

869
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,860
So then, you and I would have never met.

870
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:40,843
- True.

871
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,110
It is indeed my good fortune
that we did, Katherine.

872
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,720
This I suspect the Merlin did influence.

873
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,553
- Merlin?

874
00:59:51,557 --> 00:59:52,390
How?

875
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,430
- How, I cannot say.

876
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:56,070
His powers are vast and wonderful.

877
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,740
But in some way, he was my guide,

878
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:04,050
and I have found Michael and you here.

879
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,670
So very near the heart of my quest.

880
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,093
- Maybe you're right,

881
01:00:12,093 --> 01:00:14,160
maybe Merlin did have
something to do with it.

882
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:18,180
In your time...

883
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,640
Do you have somebody?

884
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:30,180
A lady, a wife?

885
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,950
- My devotion is to God and king.

886
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,430
But if I were to give my heart freely

887
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:43,260
to any maiden, brave Katherine,

888
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,790
it would be to one such as thee.

889
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,610
Be safe on the morrow.

890
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,050
Should the plan fail,

891
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,280
protect Michael and thyself.

892
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,270
Promise me this.

893
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:02,762
- But I--

894
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:03,595
- Promise.

895
01:01:10,532 --> 01:01:11,532
- I promise.

896
01:01:15,535 --> 01:01:16,368
- Good.

897
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:36,680
Thou art worthy of the heart of a knight.

898
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,350
Lady Katherine.

899
01:01:44,572 --> 01:01:47,739
(soft medieval music)

900
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:05,931
(eagle shrieking)

901
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,560
- Come, my boy.

902
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:21,183
Rise.

903
01:02:27,323 --> 01:02:29,990
Your time to be king draws near.

904
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:40,066
Try not to lose him this time, Blackpool.

905
01:02:40,066 --> 01:02:42,746
(cars honking)

906
01:02:42,746 --> 01:02:45,996
(light medieval music)

907
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:52,370
- Remember thy promise, milady.

908
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:54,080
Be safe this day.

909
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:54,913
- I will.

910
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,690
- Do not underestimate Wolvencroft,

911
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,420
nor take this quest too lightly.

912
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,310
- Understood, but Kat's
job is to drive us in

913
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:04,580
and drive us out.

914
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,710
That should keep her pretty safe,

915
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:07,370
and then it's just left
for me to nab Arthur.

916
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,370
- Aye, but the Wolvencroft is no fool.

917
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,480
He will be well guarded.

918
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,750
That shall be my concern.

919
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,670
That, and acquiring the black crystal.

920
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:15,503
- Isn't there any other way

921
01:03:15,503 --> 01:03:17,350
to get back to your time
without the crystal?

922
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,820
- It is the way that I have chosen.

923
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,160
We have not much time, we must hurry.

924
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,410
- 15 minutes, let's rock.

925
01:03:27,248 --> 01:03:30,831
(tense instrumental music)

926
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:38,289
(engine sputtering)

927
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:40,666
- I can't believe this is not starting.

928
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:41,590
- [Michael] Just try it again.

929
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:42,760
- I've tried it three times, Mike.

930
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,889
- [Michael] Try it one more time.

931
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:46,348
(engine sputtering)

932
01:03:46,348 --> 01:03:48,059
- I see the Merlin's hand in this.

933
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:50,860
And if I am late, all is lost.

934
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,860
Our ride through the park must be swift.

935
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,630
- Look what you did!

936
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,580
- [Katherine] I didn't do anything!

937
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,880
- Just pop the hood, okay?

938
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,293
Give it another try.

939
01:04:04,293 --> 01:04:05,729
- Nothing!

940
01:04:05,729 --> 01:04:06,562
- Nothing?

941
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:08,500
- Try it one more time.

942
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,333
(horse whinnying)

943
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,200
- Stop!

944
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,420
Don't you think this is mine to do?

945
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,273
- Yes, sir.

946
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:30,824
- Haven't I waited long enough?

947
01:04:30,824 --> 01:04:32,824
- [Blackpool] Of course.

948
01:04:33,779 --> 01:04:36,612
(magical zapping)

949
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,540
- I see the Merlin still
enjoys his games, does he?

950
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,572
Well let's see how far he will take it.

951
01:04:42,572 --> 01:04:43,405
- [Blackpool] Why?

952
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:44,238
- Blackpool...

953
01:04:44,238 --> 01:04:45,891
- Should we not wait, sir?

954
01:04:45,891 --> 01:04:47,580
(bell chiming)

955
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,980
The boy's time comes.

956
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:59,163
(intense instrumental music)

957
01:05:00,365 --> 01:05:03,282
(tires screeching)

958
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:11,973
- Come, Arthur.

959
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:13,663
Come.

960
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:18,450
Fulfill your destiny.

961
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,660
Draw forth the sword of power.

962
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:34,720
Draw the sword, and give it to me.

963
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,263
Come, boy.

964
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,483
Do it.

965
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:47,453
(bell chiming)

966
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,150
Draw the sword, and give it to me!

967
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,113
Now!

968
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:08,304
Do it!

969
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:10,772
- Arthur, no!

970
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:14,150
(heroic instrumental music)

971
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:17,400
- You have much to lose here, Lancelot!

972
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,593
Hold thy sword.

973
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,110
I could offer thee a kingdom and a crown!

974
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,630
- You have nothing to
offer that I would accept.

975
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:29,550
- Oh, well then consider this.

976
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,810
Just let the boy draw forth the sword

977
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:34,580
and Camelot shall be yours.

978
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,570
- Well, you know that if Arthur

979
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:39,260
were to draw the sword here and now,

980
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,110
there would be no Camelot.

981
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:46,270
- I have seen the past and the future.

982
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,687
The boy's destiny and your fate are one.

983
01:06:55,981 --> 01:06:59,148
Should Arthur become king in his time?

984
01:07:01,514 --> 01:07:05,347
You will destroy him,
and all that is Camelot.

985
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,130
- Arthur shall be king,

986
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:30,020
and I will fulfill Merlin's quest!

987
01:07:30,932 --> 01:07:33,514
(sword whooshing)

988
01:07:33,514 --> 01:07:35,097
Michael, the stone!

989
01:07:36,449 --> 01:07:39,389
(magical zapping)

990
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:42,806
(intense medieval music)

991
01:07:46,475 --> 01:07:47,308
- Michael!

992
01:07:57,081 --> 01:07:59,582
- Long live King Arthur.

993
01:07:59,582 --> 01:08:02,582
(magical whooshing)

994
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:19,980
- You have not finished with me, Lancelot.

995
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,550
By the dragon, you are not.

996
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,242
- Reach boy, reach squire!

997
01:08:25,242 --> 01:08:28,159
(thunder crashing)

998
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:48,746
Be you unharmed, my lord?

999
01:08:48,746 --> 01:08:50,392
- Aye.

1000
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,892
What has happened, why am I...

1001
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,600
I know you.

1002
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,433
Do I not?

1003
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:00,634
- Not as such, my lord.

1004
01:09:02,065 --> 01:09:05,780
- I have no memory of
this place, yet I know it.

1005
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,613
Why?

1006
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:10,830
- Perhaps such answers were
best left for the Merlin.

1007
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:13,258
- Merlin?

1008
01:09:13,258 --> 01:09:15,008
- [Lancelot] My lord.

1009
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:21,393
- Come on, come on!

1010
01:09:22,722 --> 01:09:25,337
(squealing)

1011
01:09:25,337 --> 01:09:28,699
(swords clanging)

1012
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:32,282
(intense orchestral music)

1013
01:10:13,787 --> 01:10:16,704
(eagle screeching)

1014
01:10:22,307 --> 01:10:23,186
Lancelot!

1015
01:10:23,186 --> 01:10:24,019
- Gawain.

1016
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,460
- I grow weary of your
interference, knight.

1017
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,740
Give me the boy!

1018
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,220
- Never be, go find Merlin.

1019
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,310
Stop at nothing!

1020
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,280
- He will never reach the Merlin.

1021
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,040
And now, Sir Lancelot...

1022
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,080
How shall I deal with you and your friend?

1023
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,280
- I counsel thee, yield thyself and live.

1024
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,113
- Arrogance.

1025
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:56,480
Pride run wild.

1026
01:10:59,120 --> 01:10:59,953
- At last.

1027
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,090
- You have much to learn.

1028
01:11:24,377 --> 01:11:25,960
- Very impressive.

1029
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,627
Let's see what you do with this.

1030
01:11:42,824 --> 01:11:45,497
(squealing)

1031
01:11:45,497 --> 01:11:48,176
(swords clanging)

1032
01:11:48,176 --> 01:11:51,759
(intense orchestral music)

1033
01:12:05,448 --> 01:12:06,365
- Lancelot!

1034
01:12:12,737 --> 01:12:15,070
(squealing)

1035
01:12:22,013 --> 01:12:22,846
- Gawain!

1036
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,080
Be these injuries mortal?

1037
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:30,060
(grunting)

1038
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,340
- Fulfill the quest.

1039
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:33,740
The land needs a king.

1040
01:12:41,764 --> 01:12:43,910
- By the power of the Merlin,

1041
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,090
be thee vanquished!

1042
01:12:46,422 --> 01:12:49,422
(magical whooshing)

1043
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,153
I shall return for you, my friend.

1044
01:12:55,464 --> 01:12:58,797
(soft orchestral music)

1045
01:13:20,985 --> 01:13:24,014
(laughing)

1046
01:13:24,014 --> 01:13:26,309
(squealing)

1047
01:13:26,309 --> 01:13:27,226
- Ho there!

1048
01:13:27,226 --> 01:13:28,882
Steady, steady!

1049
01:13:28,882 --> 01:13:32,465
(tense instrumental music)

1050
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:37,755
You are my only hope.

1051
01:13:37,755 --> 01:13:38,755
Fail me not.

1052
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:43,730
Fear not, I shall not harm thee.

1053
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:44,910
But I pray you, stand back.

1054
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:47,759
The horse has no love of thy kind.

1055
01:13:47,759 --> 01:13:51,047
Have no fear, I am nothing but a squire!

1056
01:13:51,047 --> 01:13:54,119
Thy master will wish me unharmed.

1057
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:55,869
I wish a bit of luck.

1058
01:13:57,763 --> 01:13:58,596
Aye...

1059
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:00,810
Is that your master?

1060
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,150
I bid you, prepare!

1061
01:14:05,366 --> 01:14:06,621
- Stop him!

1062
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:08,954
Seize him, don't let him go!

1063
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,030
- Arthur has bested you after all.

1064
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,740
- I could kill you with but a gesture.

1065
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,130
Far sweeter...

1066
01:14:34,528 --> 01:14:37,195
Will be the revenge of my sword.

1067
01:14:39,117 --> 01:14:40,842
(heroic orchestral music)

1068
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:43,675
(swords clanging)

1069
01:15:29,813 --> 01:15:33,480
(dramatic orchestral music)

1070
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:40,340
Are you ready to serve
your new master now?

1071
01:15:57,655 --> 01:15:59,810
- As you covet history,

1072
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:01,380
so should you fight for it.

1073
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:06,091
(tense orchestral music)

1074
01:16:06,091 --> 01:16:08,924
(swords clanging)

1075
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,774
- You wouldn't kill a sorcerer.

1076
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:02,879
There are so few of us remaining.

1077
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,580
- The Merlin has charged me

1078
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,260
deal with thee thus.

1079
01:17:13,405 --> 01:17:15,738
(screaming)

1080
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:21,090
Britain shall have her king,

1081
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:23,929
and her legend.

1082
01:17:25,459 --> 01:17:28,792
(heroic medieval music)

1083
01:17:47,315 --> 01:17:48,790
- This really happened.

1084
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:51,020
- Oh yes, yes it did.

1085
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,270
I've always told you,
it's a strange world.

1086
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,390
- Yeah, but you never told me exactly

1087
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:55,370
how strange it could be.

1088
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,150
- Yeah, but it was fun, wasn't it?

1089
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,900
- It was fun.

1090
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,093
A lot of fun.

1091
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,253
I'm gonna miss him, you know?

1092
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:07,580
- Yep.

1093
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,660
- For the first time in my life,

1094
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,940
I actually started to believe

1095
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:14,107
that heroes and romance and all
that stuff actually existed.

1096
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:18,410
Not just in my hopeless imagination.

1097
01:18:19,248 --> 01:18:20,081
- Oh, Kat.

1098
01:18:23,045 --> 01:18:23,878
It's okay.

1099
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,424
- He's gone, isn't he?

1100
01:18:27,424 --> 01:18:30,591
(soft medieval music)

1101
01:19:11,503 --> 01:19:12,586
- I think so.

1102
01:19:13,696 --> 01:19:15,290
- For good?

1103
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:16,241
- Maybe.

1104
01:19:16,241 --> 01:19:19,679
- (laughs) I'm okay.

1105
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,183
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1106
01:19:21,183 --> 01:19:22,496
- What are you gonna do?

1107
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:23,546
- Just gonna go get something to eat.

1108
01:19:23,546 --> 01:19:24,443
- You want to watch some TV?

1109
01:19:24,443 --> 01:19:25,912
- No.

1110
01:19:25,912 --> 01:19:27,380
- All right.

1111
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:28,213
- Thanks.

1112
01:19:33,008 --> 01:19:36,341
(soft orchestral music)

1113
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,270
- Fair Katherine,

1114
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:52,250
this glove is for remembrance only.

1115
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,900
If you wish it, we shall meet again.

1116
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,620
But place the ring upon thy finger,

1117
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,670
and I will find thee, my lady.

1118
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:02,650
Thy true servant amore, Lancelot du Lac.

1119
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:13,519
(light medieval music)

1120
01:20:26,539 --> 01:20:29,372
(magical ringing)

1121
01:20:39,421 --> 01:20:42,254
(hooves clopping)

1122
01:20:55,719 --> 01:20:58,219
I told thee I would find thee.

1123
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:03,290
Welcome to Camelot, Lady Katherine.

1124
01:21:08,189 --> 01:21:11,522
(bright medieval music)

1125
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:56,209
(MultiCom Jingle)
