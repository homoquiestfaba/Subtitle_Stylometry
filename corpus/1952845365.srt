1
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,368
Where's Julio's old lady, man?

2
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,076
Jesus! A setup!

3
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,886
<i>Call the police. Call an ambulance!
Comprende?</i>

4
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,162
- What do you see?
- Nothing, Lieutenant.

5
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,324
Bullshit! What do you see?

6
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,628
<i>Nada, Lieutenant!</i>

7
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,329
The gun, honey dripper.
You see that gun in his hands?

8
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,795
<i>Sí, Lieutenant.</i>

9
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,537
What do you see?

10
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,512
<i>- l see a gun. A gun, señor!
- Where?</i>

11
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,807
His right hand!
His right hand got a gun.

12
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,612
Okay. Calm down.
Calm down!

13
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,482
Wait!

14
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,859
Wait right here!

15
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,131
<i>- Yeah?
- ReiIIy?</i>

16
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:20,263
<i>Is this Assistant District Attorney
AIoysius Francis ReiIIy?</i>

17
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,132
Yeah.

18
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,237
This is Kevin Quinn,
Chief of Homicide Bureau...

19
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,972
...Office of the District Attorney,
County of New York.

20
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,604
<i>You've heard of me?</i>

21
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,874
Jesus. Yes, this is me.

22
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,014
<i>- Who?
- Al Reilly, sir.</i>

23
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,183
Aloysius Francis Reilly.

24
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,656
All right. That's better.

25
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,818
<i>- Are you catching tonight?
- Yes, sir, I am.</i>

26
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,055
A squad car is on the way to pick you up.

27
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,030
l've already alerted the duty stenographer.
Make note of the time.

28
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,399
<i>It's 3.:05 a.m. You have time to shower.
Be here by 4.:00 a.m.</i>

29
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,233
What precinct, sir?

30
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,436
Tony Vasquez has been shot,
it belongs to us, Homicide Bureau.

31
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,670
l know this is your first case for us.

32
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,681
Don't make me feel like an idiot
for requesting you here.

33
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,479
<i>Homicide Bureau, my office, sixth fIoor.</i>

34
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,513
Come in, please.

35
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,853
Shut the door behind you.

36
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,351
Sit down, please.

37
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,961
Aloysius Francis Reilly?

38
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,261
Yes, sir. My friends call me Al.

39
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,031
Background, Francis. Tell me about it.

40
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,240
<i>Well...</i>

41
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:47,471
Queens. Grew up in Elmhurst.
Catholic school.

42
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,005
A little minor league ball, long enough
to find out l couldn't hit a curve.

43
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:51,948
Law degree?

44
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:52,881
Brooklyn.

45
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,313
Why not St. John's?

46
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,351
My father thought the Jesuits
were too left-wing.

47
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,791
Your father's death was a great tragedy.
Not only for your family...

48
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,726
...but for the police force as well.

49
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,765
Yes, sir. He was killed
in the line of duty in the 23.

50
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,934
l see you served in Harlem, also.

51
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,496
lt's bad there.

52
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,303
Yes, sir. lt is.
Those people have a tough time.

53
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,903
lf you want to serve as the house liberal...

54
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,443
...l can transfer you back
to Mr. Bloomenfeld's office.

55
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,173
l don't care if a man
is black, white, green, polka-dot...

56
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,340
...or was thrown
in the garbage at birth...

57
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,078
...or he started wearing
women's clothes at 14.

58
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,817
lf he breaks the law
and it crosses this desk, he pays for it.

59
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,087
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

60
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,854
- And you agree?
- Yes, sir.

61
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,627
Yeah.

62
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,163
Your father was everything
the Police Department used to be.

63
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,964
He was part of a tradition
that had been built by our people.

64
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,837
A tradition that justified
the use of those words, ''The Finest.''

65
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,172
That's why l brought you in here.

66
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,506
l want to hold on to those values
and the people who reflect them.

67
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,777
- l hope you'll be one of them.
- l'll certainly be trying.

68
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,340
Your first case
as an Assistant District Attorney...

69
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,944
...began with my phone call at 3:05 a.m.

70
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,284
A classic case of justifiable homicide.

71
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:11,152
A piece of vermin, one Tony Vasquez,
attempted to ambush Lieutenant Brennan.

72
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,831
Mike Brennan is the personification
of the finest.

73
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,337
The toughest, most dedicated police officer
it's been my pleasure to know.

74
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,065
He gets rough sometimes.

75
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,607
lf he takes shortcuts,
they never hurt us in court.

76
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,371
l know, because this office
has tried all his cases...

77
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,776
...never lost one.

78
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,837
Never been reversed on appeal.

79
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,781
You'll meet him shortly.

80
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,752
Your job is to collect the facts, present them
to a grand jury and close this out.

81
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,086
You will advise Brennan of his rights
and get a statement from him.

82
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:42,626
The TV unit is occupied,
so you'll be using the court stenographer.

83
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:43,889
His name is Lubin...

84
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,524
...and even now he's struggling
to find his way here from Far Rockaway.

85
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,636
Do you have any questions about how
to conduct your investigation for this office?

86
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:55,299
- l don't think so, sir.
- Good. Well, it's cut-and-dried.

87
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,872
Thank you, sir.

88
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,074
One word of caution:
Do not speak too rapidly.

89
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,912
Make sure everything said
and everything that happened...

90
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,316
...has been recorded
by the court stenographer.

91
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,322
From now on, for all intents and purposes,
the Q&A defines what really happened.

92
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,254
lf it's not in the Q&A...

93
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,990
...it didn't happen.

94
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,830
Wait outside with the other witnesses
until Lubin arrives. Questions?

95
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,497
l'm not to discuss anything
with anyone until Lubin arrives.

96
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,093
- Correct?
- That's correct.

97
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,669
Welcome.

98
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,809
l don't know what this guy's on.

99
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,544
But he just sits there
with a shit-eating grin on his face!

100
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,872
So, fuck it.

101
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,509
l figure l've got to straighten him out
a little bit.

102
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:44,613
So l say, ''You've got a right to remain silent
as long as you can stand the pain.''

103
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,853
There's nothing.
Not a fucking dent.

104
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,018
Not a fucking dent!

105
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,359
l decide to fingerprint him in the back room.

106
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,727
He pulls away from me.

107
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,323
He's a big motherfucker.
He's 260 or 270.

108
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:59,565
He starts yelling, ''You fucking harp, this!
You fucking harp, that!''

109
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,938
l say, ''Mr. Calabrese, don't upset me now.''

110
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,206
l go to put his hand on the printer.
He pulls his hand away...

111
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,612
...he says, ''You can't print me! l'm made!''

112
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,215
He throws the fucking ink pad!

113
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,348
And l'm standing there...

114
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,181
...and l'm looking
at my new light-blue jacket.

115
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:23,023
l've got ink all over my fucking white shirt.

116
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,994
He just ruined my fucking jacket.

117
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,795
l'm seeing red. l'm pissed, right?
l'm going to get that motherfucker!

118
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,060
l grab him by the ass and the neck...

119
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,800
...and very quietly l say,
''All right, you guinea, you bought it.''

120
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,473
l threw the fucker out the window!

121
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,512
Threw him right out the window.

122
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,674
He goes right through the wire mesh,
out the window.

123
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,809
Now remember, this guy's stoned
so he thinks he's gonna die.

124
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,615
<i>He thinks he's on the second floor,
and he goes...</i>

125
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,017
Shits his pants.

126
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,550
He shit his pants.

127
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:56,287
He wasn't hurt too badly.
lt was the ground floor.

128
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,193
He had some cuts, that's about it.

129
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,165
Now, we gotta go get the guy and he smells.

130
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,066
We bring him in the back.
l'm going to take him in.

131
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,229
l take him back to print him...

132
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,899
...and l make him put his hands
down in his pants...

133
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,967
...and he gets some of that shit
on his fingers.

134
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:16,146
l say, ''Mr. Calabrese,
we ain't got no more ink pads.

135
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,307
''You've got to use your own shit.''

136
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,517
No more out of Mr. fucking Calabrese.

137
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,854
l'm Mike Brennan.
You're the Homicide ADA?

138
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,624
- Yeah. Hi. Al Reilly.
- Al Reilly, it's a pleasure.

139
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,091
l guess l'm the guest of honor, so to speak.

140
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,101
l'll do the introductions.

141
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,861
This is Captain Flynn.

142
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,997
This is Lieutenant Keely,
from the PC's office.

143
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,003
Officers Corbin and Ramon,
first on the scene.

144
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,744
Detective Valentin here.

145
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,838
He's working the case
with Detective Chapman from Homicide.

146
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,406
Call me Chappie.
We're your arms and legs, Reilly.

147
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,248
- You want a Pepsi, Chappie?
- Yeah.

148
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,949
So, you're a lawyer now?
You don't do no running around no more.

149
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,925
That's right, you was a cop once, right?
ln the 23?

150
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,621
- That's right, Lieutenant.
- lt's a pleasure.

151
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,961
lt's about time they brought them
from the force into here, right?

152
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,360
lt's a pleasure. l knew your old man.
lt's cops like that that made us the finest.

153
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,997
We were just telling some old war stories.

154
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,200
<i>Mike was just telling us
what cojones he got.</i>

155
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,539
The jungle bunny over here
is laughing his ass off-

156
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,136
You ain't nothin' but a nigger
with straight hair.

157
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,115
Gentlemen. You're in violation
of Police Department directives.

158
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,219
Racist epithets are not permitted.

159
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,513
Excuse me, sir.

160
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,322
Who's a racist? Me and Chappie?
We're the minorities, man.

161
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,189
You're damn lucky to get us.

162
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,957
lf we quit, some Federal judge
take away your money.

163
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,363
Brennan, he ain't no racist.
He hates everybody.

164
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,931
He's an equal-opportunity hater.

165
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,832
Lubin, what the fuck took you so long?

166
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:53,902
l almost got mugged on the subway.
Where were you pricks when l needed you?

167
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,877
Would all present please leave their name...

168
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,216
...badge and assignment number
with the stenographer before leaving?

169
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,619
Thank you.

170
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,590
Now at approximately 12:30 this morning...

171
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,025
...something happened.

172
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,390
Right, Lieutenant?

173
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,057
Correct, Mr. Reilly.

174
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,732
Where did this something happen?

175
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,535
At 3111 Park Avenue,
city and county of New York.

176
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,671
Tell us in your own words,
tell us what happened.

177
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,806
Whose words is he going to tell it in?

178
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,716
Lubin, l make the jokes around here.

179
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,753
Yes, Your Holiness.

180
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,256
l think it best not to include
that last exchange, Lubin.

181
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,588
Not if l'm gonna be off
on Passover.

182
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:51,595
Earlier this evening, l was at the 23
on 104th Street between Park and 3rd.

183
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,440
l was investigating
the homicide of one Julio Sierra.

184
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,338
lnvestigation revealed
that Sierra's lifelong friend and associate...

185
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,841
...Antonio Vasquez, had been cheated
out of a vast sum of money...

186
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,044
...by the aforementioned Sierra.

187
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,112
So a little after midnight,
l get a call from a reliable informant...

188
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,682
...as to the whereabouts
of this Antonio Vasquez.

189
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,456
l realized that this Vasquez should
be questioned in the murder of Sierra...

190
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,189
...as he had ample motive.
He's got a long yellow sheet of violence.

191
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,862
l went to this after-hours joint,
a club at 3111 Park Avenue.

192
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:31,334
The door was open.
l saw the deceased, Tony Vasquez.

193
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,311
He was known to me as Tony
from previous encounters.

194
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,382
l said, ''Tony, come here.
l want to talk to you.''

195
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,144
Or words to that effect.

196
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,619
l don't expect nothing. l'm nonchalant.

197
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,616
Tony comes over and we talk.

198
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:50,627
l no sooner say the words ''Julio Sierra''
to Tony and he goes crazy.

199
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:55,656
He starts screaming at me, ''l'll kill you!''
Or words to that effect.

200
00:13:55,901 --> 00:14:00,895
l don't mind saying that l was scared
because Tony is known as a shooter.

201
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,200
l saw him reach.
l saw a flash of metal...

202
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,370
...and in fear of my life,
l drew my gun and popped him.

203
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,211
And God was with me.
l hit him in the head.

204
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,242
Then the people emerged from the club
and started shouting abuse at me.

205
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,982
They were pushing and shoving.

206
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:20,184
l pointed out to them
that the deceased had a pistol in his hand.

207
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,159
Then l held them back at bay
until reinforcements arrived.

208
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,326
Ballistics is now checking out
whether the gun of the deceased...

209
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,358
...is the same gun that killed Julio Sierra
because they were both.45 caliber.

210
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,203
That's about it, Mr. Reilly.

211
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,108
Anyhow, l'm sick a human life was lost.

212
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,108
But Jesus, l mean, it was quick!
lt was him or me!

213
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,752
Lieutenant, you certainly covered everything.

214
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,648
You want that last remark
on the record, Mr. Reilly?

215
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,685
That was a spontaneous, refreshing reaction.
l'd leave it in, Reilly.

216
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,060
Yes. Leave it in.

217
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,394
l'll be happy to answer
any more questions, Mr. Reilly.

218
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,695
We have no more questions.
Do we, Mr. Quinn?

219
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,633
That's up to you to decide.

220
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,408
Okay, thank you. End of statement.

221
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,976
All right, thank you, gentlemen.
Everybody go home and get some sleep.

222
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,311
- You handled that well, Francis.
- lt's pretty cut-and-dried.

223
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,413
lt's a good case
for you to cut your teeth on.

224
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,151
All you need for the grand jury is...

225
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,956
...statements from the witnesses at the club,
ballistics and autopsy reports...

226
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,463
...and a statement from Brennan's informant.

227
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:38,128
l want you to shield the identity
of the informant from everybody.

228
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,671
- ls that clear?
- Yes, sir.

229
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,036
Good night, everybody.

230
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,268
Good night.

231
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,843
He's pretty impressive, isn't he?

232
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,974
As Durante used to say,
''You ain't seen nothing yet!''

233
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,741
The rifling and ridges match up
with the.45 found in Vasquez's hand.

234
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,812
Ballistics will confirm it was the same gun
used in the Julio Sierra killing.

235
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,648
We're wrapping up two homicides.
We're looking good here.

236
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,314
That's a great introduction
to the Homicide Bureau.

237
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,686
Please, it's Al.

238
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,555
l was a cop too long,
l'm not used to second names.

239
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,288
<i>l rode with Sabartelli, Forenzi, Mullins...</i>

240
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,228
Moon Mullins!

241
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,300
You couldn't call him that to his face.

242
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,131
That fucking Mullins,
he was happy doing his stint in uniform.

243
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,231
Sure, man.
Why you go and ruin a good thing?

244
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,900
What about the witnesses?

245
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:56,471
Let's see here, we got Santo Rivera,
Maxie Correa...

246
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,679
- ...Angel Delgado-
- Rice and bean choirboys.

247
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,778
Fuck you, night fighter.
We got Luis Alvarado...

248
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,346
...Jose Castillo, Mauricio Valdes...

249
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,416
<i>...Roberto Texador,
also known as Bobby Tex...</i>

250
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,526
Bobby Tex.

251
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,587
<i>We got some funny fish in the net,
two scungiIi up there, too.</i>

252
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,566
- ltalians in a PR joint?
- Fellas, we gotta be alone.

253
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,872
We've got Lorenzo Franconi,
a.k.a. Larry Pesch...

254
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,773
...and his bodyguard, Bruno Valli.

255
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:29,712
Larry Pesch, Bobby Tex. That's heavy stuff.
These guys don't go uptown.

256
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,477
Not for a long time, man.

257
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,008
l used to see Bobby Tex
playing stickball up by San Juan Hill.

258
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,147
Now he's living on Sutton Place
and l'm still stuck in the projects.

259
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,692
Get into dope.
That's the trouble with these PRs.

260
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,955
They breed like rabbits,
don't do any work...

261
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,589
...and expect Welfare
to put them on Sutton Place.

262
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,793
Up yours, darker-than-me.
l get twice the work done around here.

263
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,358
- You know why?
- Why is that?

264
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,735
Because you're always stopping
for watermelon.

265
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,866
What's up with you people
and that watermelon?

266
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:57,873
Who else?

267
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:02,879
We got Bobby Tex's old lady,
Nancy something. Nancy Bosch.

268
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,041
Who?

269
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,407
That's what it says, Nancy Bosch.

270
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:10,448
She's been with Bobby Tex a few years.
We keep a file on him.

271
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,252
You should read about the parties
this guy throws.

272
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,486
One time he had the whole cast over
from some Broadway show.

273
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,760
They had to bring in the coke
in wheelbarrows.

274
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,128
l guess l'll get mine when l get to heaven.

275
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,832
The only way you'll get to heaven
is if they have their groceries delivered.

276
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,101
Let's say we stop this shit.

277
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,838
Chappie, you finish up ballistics
and the autopsy report.

278
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,743
Valentin, you take the witnesses...

279
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:40,251
...but l want to see Franconi,
Bobby Tex and Nancy Bosch.

280
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,944
So get them down here.

281
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,622
Hey.

282
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,561
l'll never get used to it, Al.

283
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:59,293
You got DAs at one table, you got
judges at another and defendants at a third.

284
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,532
How many deals do you think get cut
in the men's room? Don't answer that.

285
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,640
- What are you drinking?
- Some soda. Can l have a soda?

286
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,813
An lrishman turning down a drink?

287
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,577
The prophet Elijah's coming
for Passover this year.

288
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:16,480
Mr. Bloomenfeld, an honor.

289
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,884
Once again, we meet.

290
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,185
Pearlstein, fuck off!

291
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:24,286
l'm seen talking to you and
shooflies will follow my children's children.

292
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,331
Al, this is Preston Pearlstein.

293
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,533
When Jesse Jackson used
the word ''Hymie,'' he meant him.

294
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,170
What a character!
How do you do? l'm delighted.

295
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:38,733
That's it, Pearlstein. Don't spoil my appetite.
We haven't eaten yet.

296
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,204
What a character.

297
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,339
Look at that son of a bitch.

298
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,577
Twenty years ago he was wearing the jacket
from one suit and the pants from another.

299
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:54,257
Now he's living in 516, his wife
just bought half of West Palm Beach...

300
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,692
...and l'm sitting here pulling my putz.

301
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,793
We'll eat here at the bar, Phil. The usual.

302
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,764
What is this, Tuesday? Yes, it must be.

303
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,234
You're crying in your Scotch again.

304
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,726
You're right.

305
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,704
How come my generation of Jews drink?

306
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,670
My parents, they come over from Poland,
they used to sing this song:

307
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,146
l'll translate for your mick ears.

308
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,724
''A drunk is a gentile.''

309
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:32,462
<i>And then l forget... ''He has to drink,
because a gentile is a drunk.''</i>

310
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,202
Leo, you know the DA's office
would fall apart without you.

311
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,200
- You're the best tactician.
- Yeah, that and a token...

312
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,206
...will get you a ride on the subway.

313
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,500
Thirty years.

314
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,910
Thirty years in this fucking office.
l should've quit years ago.

315
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,339
Gone private. Made some money.
Molly deserves better.

316
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,747
So, why didn't you?

317
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,181
Because l had the same disease you've got.
l thought l could make a difference.

318
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,751
- You're blushing.
- Am l?

319
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,491
Choirboy, l hope they don't break your heart.

320
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,359
How do you like your new boss?

321
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,467
He's a pisser.
Tough but fair. l like that.

322
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,630
And decisive.

323
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,799
All we heard about in law school
was his track record, his memory.

324
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,742
He was reading my summary...

325
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,303
...and he said,
''You've got Vasquez's record wrong.

326
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,909
''We've brought him in 11 times
but he's had two convictions, not three.''

327
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,453
l looked it up.
On the Xerox of the yellow sheet...

328
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,887
...the ''2'' was smudged
and it looked like a ''3.''

329
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,049
He was right.

330
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,824
He's a prick. He's a racist
and an anti-Semite and a prick.

331
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,596
He wants to be Tom Dewey and he will be.

332
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,296
He married for politics and
all he can see is his way clear to...

333
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,766
...God knows how high up.

334
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,206
Years ago,
when we still had executions in the state...

335
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,300
...he used to volunteer as a witness.

336
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,346
His first murder case...

337
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,247
<i>...he was a young ADA then,
l'm talking years ago...</i>

338
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,316
The case was shaky,
largely circumstantial...

339
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,753
...and he wanted
a recommended death penalty from the jury.

340
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,688
Before he finished he had them believing
that poor black kid had raped their mothers.

341
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,423
He goes up to Sing Sing
for the electrocution.

342
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:16,099
And the next day we're sitting around
drinking coffee and...

343
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,604
...he walks in with this shit-eating grin
on his face.

344
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,198
And somebody says, ''Hey, how'd it go?''

345
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,305
He says casually, ''He fried!''

346
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:30,171
And then he says, ''l sure hope
he was guilty.'' Then he laughs.

347
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,815
Fuck him. Now and forever.

348
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,445
Two corned beef.
Anything to drink, gentlemen?

349
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,887
- Nothing, thanks.
- Make it a single, Phil.

350
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,852
You drew the Brennan-Vasquez case, huh?

351
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,198
Cut-and-dried.
Vasquez had a.45 in his hand.

352
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,236
Vasquez never carried a.45 in his life.

353
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,563
He did that night.

354
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,630
Schmuck, listen to me.
l also have a memory.

355
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,278
ln 11 arrests, they never found anything
on him but a.32.

356
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:05,075
That's one of the two times they ever
got him for carrying a concealed weapon.

357
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,547
He had this little.32 made
special so it would fit in his boot.

358
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,220
Check your yellow sheet.
You'll see l'm right.

359
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,985
- Maybe he had two guns that night.
- Tony Vasquez?

360
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,660
He used to say he had three balls.

361
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,395
All that Latino macho shit.

362
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:22,092
''l don't need no stinking pistols,
l take 'em out with my bare hands!''

363
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,102
Two guns, bullshit!

364
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,039
l don't give a fuck what he told you.
l didn't see no gun.

365
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,310
Thank you, Mr. Alvarado. You're excused.

366
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,881
You okay?

367
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,354
l want to set this up a little differently.

368
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,124
We should question Bobby Tex with
his old lady and the goombah in the room.

369
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,623
We've been doing it individually so far.

370
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,896
Alberto, l know my people, man.
Bobby Tex l know from the street.

371
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:02,530
He can't take the needle,
not in front of his old lady.

372
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,665
He's a hothead.

373
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,903
Why do we want to get on Bobby Tex's ass?

374
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:10,641
Larry Pesch and Bobby Texador
in a Harlem joint with Tony Vasquez?

375
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,747
Come on, Chappie.
There's fish in the stream.

376
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,218
Maybe we'll get lucky.

377
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,356
Yeah?

378
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:25,360
Mr. Reilly, my clients have been waiting
a half an hour.

379
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,795
We're ready. Please come in.

380
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,026
- Everybody been sworn?
- lt's done already.

381
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,662
Mr. Reilly, these are my clients,
Mr. Franconi, Mr. Valli...

382
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,070
...and Mr. and Mrs. Roberto Texador.

383
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,973
Mr. and Mrs.?

384
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,706
l thought you told me
Mr. Texador was single.

385
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:50,619
You know how it is, living together.
Times have changed, haven't they?

386
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,721
You know, common-law wife.

387
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,789
Counselor, common-law marriages
were abrogated in New York in '31.

388
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,093
- You should know the law.
- That's the way we're gonna play it?

389
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,457
- Listen, kid.
- Don't call me ''kid.''

390
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:06,799
l've seen you standing outside of night court
with a vaudeville hook waiting for clients.

391
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,306
We don't have to take this. Everyone out!

392
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:14,641
Take it easy. You've brought your clients
down here in good faith. You always do.

393
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,371
This is a bullshit case.

394
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:20,383
Pardon me, ma'am. We'll just ask a couple
of questions and everybody can go home.

395
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,249
Nobody's going to get hurt here.

396
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,087
lt's over. Water under the bridge.
Pearlstein never takes it personally.

397
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,489
However, l would like to state
for the record...

398
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,122
...that Larry here, Mr. Franconi...

399
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,963
...refuses to say anything,
invoking his privilege...

400
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,401
...under the Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendments.

401
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,702
- ls that on the advice of counsel?
- Not necessarily.

402
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,103
l can't believe an advocate
as respected as you...

403
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,771
...would advise his client to plead the Fifth.

404
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,377
He's not the target of this investigation.

405
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,815
Do you want us to become suspicious of...

406
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,548
...Mr. Vito Franconi, a.k.a. Larry Pesch...

407
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,115
...Pleasant Avenue and points south?

408
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,760
''Pesch'' means ''fish'' in the
mother tongue, right, Mr. Franconi?

409
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,155
Do you want us to grant him immunity?

410
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,668
March him upstairs to Part 30
and have him imprisoned for contempt?

411
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,397
You want me to talk with
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics...

412
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:16,235
...see if they have any problems?
lnternal Revenue Service?

413
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,300
- l'm not saying l'd do any of these things-
- Wait.

414
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,680
Do you mind if l talk with
my clients outside, Counselor?

415
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,279
- Of course, Preston.
- Thank you, Al.

416
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:58,475
Al, it's all straightened out.
Mr. Franconi will make a statement.

417
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:06,956
Me and my chauffeur here was driving
on Park Avenue around midnight.

418
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,384
All of a sudden, l had to take a piss.

419
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,920
l said, ''Bruno, find me someplace.
l gotta take a piss.''

420
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,960
l didn't want to go in the street
on account of the neighborhood, you know.

421
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,395
So, Bruno pulls over by this joint.

422
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,900
l go in. l take a piss. l come out.

423
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:27,002
And there's this guy. He's waving
a piece and yelling, ''Stay here!''

424
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,110
l figured he was a cop, so l stayed.

425
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,979
ls that your recollection, Mr. Valli?

426
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,344
l'm with him.

427
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,409
l'm a little confused here.

428
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,855
The after-hours club on Park Avenue
had a sign saying, ''Members Only.''

429
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,850
What made you think you could get in?

430
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,732
What is this, the third degree?
l come down here on my own time.

431
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,230
<i>l've got no...
l've got a poultry business to run.</i>

432
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,329
l've got no time to be jerking around.

433
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,739
Pearlstein, straighten this guy out, will you?

434
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,672
My client has cooperated
in every way possible.

435
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,145
This interview was
a half-hour late in starting.

436
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,445
l'd like the two gentlemen to stay
just a little longer, in case...

437
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,978
- ...any conflict develops in the testimony.
- Of course, we're cooperating fully, Al.

438
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,181
Mr. Texador.

439
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:24,957
Suppose...

440
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,904
...you give us your version
of what happened?

441
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:34,578
l'll be happy to, Mr. Reilly.
l know Mauricio Valdez from the old days.

442
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,910
ln fact we used to live in the barrio.

443
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,607
Last Thursday, my wife and l here,
we decided to give his club a visit.

444
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,449
Excuse me, Bobby Tex. Your wife?

445
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,083
l'm talking to Mr. Reilly.

446
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,155
Detective Valentin and Chapman
are assigned to the case.

447
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,161
They're allowed to ask questions.
Continue.

448
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,460
They're allowed questions,
yes, but not snotty insinuations.

449
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,696
- Right?
- Right, please continue.

450
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,230
We went to the club
to pay our respects and leave.

451
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,072
l won't stay late.
The crowd's too rough in these places.

452
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,169
Do you know, l remember you now?

453
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,848
- You served the 23rd Precinct, no?
- That's right.

454
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,042
You had a good reputation
among the Latinos.

455
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,452
Tough but fair.

456
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,956
- l can't stand this shit.
- Hey, Luis, please.

457
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,788
He's blowing smoke up your ass
and you're taking it.

458
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,854
l've got my wife here now, Mr. Reilly.
l don't want any profanity.

459
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,296
Okay, l'm sorry, all right? l'm sorry.

460
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,761
Please continue, Mr. Texador.

461
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,395
We had a drink.

462
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,737
All of a sudden, there's a lot of noise.

463
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,972
- Like shots?
- l can't say, but noise.

464
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,977
l go outside and there's like a big guy there.

465
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,018
But something was in his hand.

466
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,885
And a little guy, he's laid out.

467
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,615
Another big guy,
he pulls his badge, and he says:

468
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,922
''Hey, nobody moves,''
you know, like they do.

469
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,362
And then more cops came. That was it.

470
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,566
You know Mr. Franconi
and Mr. Valli from before?

471
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,897
No, l can't say l do.

472
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,130
But you saw them
when you came in the club?

473
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,832
That's a big noisy club. How-

474
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,307
You're trying to tell us that two big wops...

475
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,867
...walk in like hit men,
and you don't see them?

476
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:18,041
Those racist remarks are an outrage!
l'll call the Civil Rights League.

477
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,640
- l object!
- All right!

478
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,517
<i>Detective Valentin...</i>

479
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,356
l'd like to apologize to everyone.

480
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,956
This office does not condone any...

481
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,659
...racial epithets.

482
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,998
Now, let's just settle down
and get this over with.

483
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:45,774
This guy that was laid out
was Tony Vasquez, right?

484
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,835
- That's what l heard later.
- You knew him?

485
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,710
- Sort of, yes, from around the neighborhood.
- Sort of?

486
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,147
Look, Bobby Tex, with my own eyes
l've seen Tony Vasquez save your life.

487
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,117
<i>lt was when that guinea... ltalian gang...</i>

488
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,558
...caught you on 114th and
Pleasant Avenue in the playground there.

489
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:07,859
What you was, maybe 18, 19 years old?
And your ass was grass, man.

490
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,459
And he waded in there
with a lead pipe and he saved your ass...

491
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,334
...and now you're going to deny him
over his dead body?

492
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,234
<i>- Man, cobarde!
- Cobarde?</i>

493
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,299
Yeah, you fucking coward!
Tony loved you like a brother, man!

494
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,538
- He worked for you since then.
- Hey!

495
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,977
Fucking honey dripper.

496
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,975
You know, we knew you was a punk then,
but you're being a punk now.

497
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:30,519
Detective? Come on.
You couldn't find a Jew in Rockaway.

498
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,614
You got a badge and a gun
but you're still a punk so shut up-

499
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,886
- Bobby, please!
- Shut up, shyster. l'm talking here.

500
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,520
You're finished, Bobby Tex.
You're over and finished!

501
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:42,191
The baddest guy is me, because l'm the law
and this case is wrapped!

502
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,564
This case is clear self-defense
and the Lieutenant gets his medal...

503
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:49,334
...and l can make first grade!
So, fuck you, man, fuck you!

504
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,669
No, fuck you!

505
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,476
Come on, what are you talking about?
Little Tony Vasquez is 120 pounds.

506
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,810
Are you telling me
he's carrying a.45 and a.32? How?

507
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:02,046
- Wearing pants with no belt?
- You're a detective now?

508
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,587
You're right!

509
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,351
You see his.32 sticking out
his boot when he fell.

510
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:11,088
- Everybody knows that's all the man carried.
- You're saying Brennan whacked Tony?

511
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,791
l guess that's for me to know
and you to find out, Detective Valentin!

512
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,964
l'm really sorry, Mr. Reilly.
You know what it is, l'll tell you.

513
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:26,339
A couple of PRs from the old neighborhood,
we get together, it's always like this.

514
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:31,508
- Luis, l'm sorry. You're beautiful.
- No hard feelings.

515
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,084
You're so beautiful. No kidding.

516
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,582
You know something? l'm no detective,
but sometimes l run off at the mouth.

517
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,823
What about it, Mr. Reilly?
l got chickens to pluck.

518
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,599
l'm with him.

519
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:57,701
Will the witnesses please remain
in the waiting room just five more minutes?

520
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,710
l want to make sure there's no conflict
in the statements...

521
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,336
...so we don't have to
bring you down here again.

522
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,416
Thank you.
Lubin, you can take a break.

523
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,721
The feces has struck the air conditioner.

524
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,356
- You were great, Val.
- You wasn't too bad yourself, Alberto.

525
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:26,335
While you two pricks are congratulating
yourselves, you better realize...

526
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,634
...maybe you put Brennan's neck in it.

527
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:32,540
- l don't want to hurt a cop.
- You just did. lt's now on the Q&A.

528
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,044
- Welcome, shooflies.
- This whole thing stinks.

529
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,877
Look, Chappie, l know my people
like you know yours.

530
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,349
There's no way that Tony knocked off Julio.

531
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:44,411
Those two guys and Tex, shit man,
l seen them take on a gang of 10 guineas...

532
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,458
...with nothing but a knife
and a broken bottle in their hand.

533
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,720
They called themselves the Sinners then.

534
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:53,252
l'm talking 25 years
these guys been together, you know?

535
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,162
They're how Tex formed his gang.

536
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,066
You were moving
against the Mob in those days...

537
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,366
...so you had to be tough
to move in on dope.

538
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:04,238
Them junkie motherfuckers will fall out
over anything. A kilo, a broad.

539
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:08,904
Tony Vasquez didn't jam Sierra.
We're not talking about Columbians here.

540
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,477
l know my people.

541
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,516
<i>This case is dirty, man.
l feel it in the cojones, you know?</i>

542
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,678
You're listening to a piece of shit
like Bobby Tex.

543
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,717
The day you start believing
a goddamn dope-dealing spic...

544
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,225
...against a cop like Mike,
that's the day l hand my badge in.

545
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,289
Mike Brennan is the best cop l ever saw.

546
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,198
First one through the door,
the window, the skylight.

547
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,565
He stepped in front of a bullet for me once...

548
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,731
...caught it in his left hand
and shoved it up the punk's ass.

549
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,737
Now, unless you know, don't blow.
This is serious.

550
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,508
Fuck you, bean-eaters.

551
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,072
They were in the Marines together,
you know?

552
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,640
Chappie?

553
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,421
Just suppose Brennan comes up wrong.

554
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,850
- You ready for that?
- l'll do my job, but l won't take him in.

555
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,954
l'll leave that up to
the pride of San Juan Hill here.

556
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,727
Thank you very much, thank you.

557
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:07,066
You know that fucking gorilla would
shove me up his ass easy as Preparation H.

558
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:11,404
Then it's simple. We find the stool,
Roger Montalvo, and that should settle it.

559
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,944
Superfag? He's worse than Bobby Tex.

560
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,536
He's a stool, a pusher,
a beater and a shooter.

561
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,243
The Feds pay him $500 a month
and hands off while he deals his own shit.

562
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,445
He sets you up,
or shoots you in the back.

563
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,353
lf we're depending on him,
we'll all wind up indicted.

564
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,653
- What about the girl?
- What about her?

565
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,285
Let's get her in.
Maybe she'll say something.

566
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:34,627
You look at her with those baby blues.
Who knows where it might lead, you know?

567
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,226
Why should all the bad guys
get all the good pussy?

568
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,966
l'm sitting on something.
l've got to say it to your face, Counselor.

569
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:45,804
Say it.

570
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,710
What l've got to say,
maybe you don't want these guys to hear.

571
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,144
- Say it.
- Say it and get out.

572
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,943
What do you think, you're smart?

573
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:56,609
You think l don't know why you got me
down here on this cockamamie case?

574
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,520
She's with me now, whitebread.

575
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,452
l know all about you and my old lady.
She told me everything.

576
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,266
lf l catch you sniffing around her...

577
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,097
...you'll get much more
than you could ever handle.

578
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:16,162
l really don't care if you're the law
or whatever the fuck you are. Okay?

579
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,943
You were warned.

580
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:24,704
You ever point your finger at me again,
l'll break it off and shove it up your ass.

581
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,146
Okay.

582
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,911
l guess now, we've both been warned.

583
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,991
Hey, Flo. Come here.

584
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,264
Bring your friend.

585
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,806
Call your girlfriends over here.

586
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,150
Come on, girls. Come on.

587
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,686
You know better than to run from me, Flo.

588
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,093
- Lieutenant, l was just-
- You was just bullshit.

589
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,322
All right, who we got here?

590
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,094
We got Min, Sherry, Lola...

591
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,665
<i>...Carrie, Sue Ellen...</i>

592
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,234
Oh, and that star of stage,
screen, and cocksucking. Sylvester, right?

593
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,109
My name is Sophia.

594
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,645
Sophia?

595
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,448
What's this, Sophia?

596
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:49,021
This feels like little balls
and a cock and a Kotex, right, Sophia?

597
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,728
Don't you come in my hand,
you cocksucker, or l'll rip it off.

598
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,964
Jesus, Lieutenant, you're hurting me.

599
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,697
Not as bad as l'm going to.
Now, what's your name?

600
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,269
- What's your name?
- Sophia!

601
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,607
- What's your name?
- Sylvester.

602
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:15,957
l'm looking for Roger Montalvo.
l mean now, l'm really looking.

603
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,657
Whoever lets me know,
l owe them one, okay?

604
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:23,391
You got it, Lieutenant. Anything else?

605
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:29,172
Flo, if l wanted anything else,
l'd call Sylvester here.

606
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:33,068
l mean, look at this mouth.

607
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,605
This is an experienced mouth,
right, Sylvester?

608
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:38,876
Please, Lieutenant.

609
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,644
Now listen, cocksucker.

610
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,948
Montalvo's boyfriend, what's his name?

611
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,387
Jose Malpica.

612
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,584
That's right. Jose Malpica.

613
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,955
You run in the same circles.
You run into him on the daisy chain...

614
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,892
<i>...you tell him l want to see him.
Comprende?</i>

615
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,661
Yeah.

616
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,331
Get back to work. Get back to work!

617
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:14,773
l heard.

618
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,913
Got the word.

619
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,568
Nancy, please.

620
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,215
Nancy, please!

621
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,694
Don't be this way.

622
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,350
Are you going to your mother's?

623
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,557
Of course. You've got a tap on us.

624
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,755
And a tail on Bobby,
so l knew when you'd be going out.

625
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:35,890
lt figures.

626
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,029
- l want to talk to you.
- Don't even try!

627
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,077
- There's a lot to talk-
- Not another word.

628
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,106
Look, it's raining...

629
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,153
...and cabs are really tough,
especially going uptown...

630
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,350
...but l will be out of this car
in one second if you open your mouth.

631
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,718
Now, which is it gonna be?

632
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,121
Okay.

633
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,723
Do you remember where it is?

634
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,823
Hello, Mrs. Bosch.

635
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,087
<i>Alberto...</i>

636
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,524
Well, long time.

637
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,566
This is my mother's house.
You can't come in here.

638
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,799
Let me talk to you. Please, Nancy.

639
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,468
l don't want to start rehashing everything.

640
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,703
We never talked about anything.

641
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:33,006
You left me standing on a corner,
and six years later you walk into my office-

642
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,948
Stop it!

643
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:41,190
Whatever he is and whatever he does,
he is a lot more honorable than you are.

644
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:47,294
He is what he is, but he has one face,
not two, and he's colorblind.

645
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,231
Please. Understand...

646
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,437
...l was taken by surprise.

647
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,037
<i>You never told me your father was...</i>

648
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,605
Say it! Say it!

649
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,340
My father was what? Say it!

650
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:07,241
Was a nigger?

651
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:10,543
Cops say it all the time. Just say it, okay?

652
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,283
Was a nigger, was a dinge, was a coon!

653
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:18,120
He was the best man that l ever knew,
and you turned pale when you met him.

654
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,663
And it is pretty goddamn hard
to see you go pale.

655
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:24,861
Nancy, we were together for two years,
and you never told me your father was black.

656
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,694
ls that what you thought?

657
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,275
You thought l was hiding my father
from you?

658
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,438
l'll tell you what l thought.

659
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,543
l thought, ''l'm in love.

660
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,644
''l'm in love with a cop from the 23.

661
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,449
''l'm in love with this baby that l'm carrying.

662
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,663
''l'm in love with a great man.''
lt was my father.

663
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:03,505
We're coming home and he's
coming around the corner with his sea bag.

664
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,574
He's been away two years.

665
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,845
And at that moment, l have
everything that l could ever possibly want.

666
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:19,016
And l say, ''Al, this is my father.''

667
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,517
And then, l see your face.

668
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,560
What did you see in my face?

669
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,824
A look.

670
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,422
- A look?
- Yes!

671
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,202
One look can tell you something
that changes two peoples' lives?

672
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,831
Yeah, one look.
You know, it's what we're like.

673
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:38,431
lt's our sixth sense.

674
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:49,342
What happened to the baby?

675
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,910
What baby?

676
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,157
You know, those lrish eyes are not smiling.

677
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,890
l'm as Catholic as you are,
but l'm just not as strict.

678
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,259
These words are useless.
Just get out of my house.

679
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,393
Nancy, l don't want to leave like this.

680
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,529
You don't have a choice. Just get out.

681
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,231
Just go. Go!

682
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:15,342
Get out! lf you don't get out, l'm gonna go!
Just go!

683
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,135
Out!

684
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,345
Get out of my house! Go!

685
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,419
This is idiotic, Francis.

686
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,432
You've complicated
what should be a simple self-defense.

687
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,901
l will not allow an officer
of Brennan's stature to be dragged...

688
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,336
...through the slime
by some Puerto Rican scum.

689
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,864
You won't present this to the grand jury.
There's no corroborative evidence.

690
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,137
lt's in the Q&A.

691
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:51,141
The Q&A is for the record.
lt's like the other paperwork.

692
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,342
The grand jury will go where you lead them.

693
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:59,286
They won't ask for the Q&A,
they will accept your quotes from it.

694
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:04,427
Don't complicate this, Francis.
Don't let me lose my faith in you.

695
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:09,361
Yes, sir. We'll find the stool, Montalvo.

696
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:13,363
And l'm sure that will corroborate
Lieutenant Brennan's version.

697
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,498
Francis?

698
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,736
You're not working
for lnternal Affairs, are you?

699
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,571
No, sir.

700
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,304
Keep in touch.

701
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:27,709
Yes, sir.

702
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,151
- Hey, Alberto. Can we do Joan Rivers?
- What?

703
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,189
''Can we talk?'' Just a question.

704
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,557
Yeah. Now okay?

705
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:41,392
Al, Chappie told you
about him and Brennan being tight.

706
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:45,265
l don't have anything to tell,
but we've got to be honest.

707
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:48,168
lf we push this,
who are we pushing against?

708
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,466
What're you saying?

709
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,032
That scene the other day.
You've got to admit, that's a bit unusual.

710
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:56,440
You and the lady,
an old roll in the hay or what?

711
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:02,285
We met, we were going to get married.
We didn't get married.

712
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,410
Why?

713
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,820
l fucked up.

714
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,182
Okay. That's cool.

715
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,492
You got my respect and silence,
Alberto, okay?

716
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,493
Thank you.

717
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,901
The other day,
you looked like you were still hurting.

718
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,696
Every little breeze, Val.

719
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:48,626
We need you downtown for your statement,
nothing complicated.

720
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,600
Your report will cover all of it.
Say hi to Delgado.

721
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,434
Glad to see l'm not the only case
you're working.

722
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:57,632
Hey, Mike.

723
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,273
l came to see you...

724
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,040
...because l think you've got
the wrong idea about me.

725
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,047
l've got no idea about you, Mike.

726
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:09,950
Come on, Reilly.
lf l want my prick pulled, l'll do it myself.

727
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:14,083
Look, fuck it. lt's no secret.
l believe in kicking ass.

728
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:17,823
l've kicked ass in the 32,
the 25, the 30...

729
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,854
...the 34, the 6, you name it,
but l'm respected.

730
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,126
l mean, my first night on patrol,
at 147th and Lennox...

731
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,535
...l told those niggers on the corner:

732
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:32,405
''When l'm on the post, the baddest
motherfucker on the block is me.''

733
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,179
And then some jive-ass gives me
that stick and gun shit.

734
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,238
He said, ''You motherfucker,
l shove that stick up your ass.''

735
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,978
l say, ''Okay, asshole.''
l hand him to my partner...

736
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:44,179
...we go in the alley, and wham-bam!

737
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,213
That scumbag loses his teeth.
He goes to the fucking hospital, right?

738
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,054
But things got better when l was there.

739
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:55,621
l heard about you when l was still
at the Academy, and Chappie's told me.

740
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,223
Chappie knows it, too.

741
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,151
l don't get this.

742
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,187
They're fucking animals.

743
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,587
l mean, two cops are just driving by, Al,
and some fucking animal...

744
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:27,459
...drops a rock
through their fucking windshield.

745
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,058
lt's all coming apart, Al.

746
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,371
l want it the way it used to be.

747
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:43,340
l mean, you lose control of this jungle,
and you're finished.

748
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,272
You know, you've been on the street.

749
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,949
So, l break a couple of heads?

750
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:55,116
You know what we're fighting out there,
and they know it!

751
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:57,685
That's why they hate me out there.

752
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:02,159
This Texador, this Montalvo!
They want to set you up!

753
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:05,065
You can always find somebody
to set you up, right?

754
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,366
Not if you're clean.

755
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,937
Bullshit.

756
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,871
Like you rode with Moon Mullins, right?

757
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:17,914
Yeah.

758
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:21,983
<i>He's retired now. He's in Miami.
lt's Moon over Miami.</i>

759
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,383
Let's say some eager-beaver Assistant DA
gets ahold of old Moon:

760
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,219
''We know you were taking.
We got your nuts in our hand.

761
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,724
''We know who you rode with.

762
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,785
''He didn't report us,
so he must've had his hand in, too, right?''

763
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,558
Cops don't rat that easy, Mike.

764
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:35,996
l know that, Al.

765
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,364
l know that, but you've got to picture Moon.

766
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,461
His pension could go.

767
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,063
ln the meantime,
this DA is crooning in his ear:

768
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,974
''Give some names,
we'll give you immunity. Give us cops.''

769
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,773
You think Moon will sit on that?

770
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,177
He'll give them the whole PBA roster.

771
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,980
Listen to me, Mike.
lf you're dirty, you're going.

772
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,020
Anything you say to me from now on,
say it to me in the Q&A.

773
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,669
l gotta stand here...

774
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:22,243
...and take this shit
from Kevin Reilly's little boy?

775
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,080
l wish you were dead.

776
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:32,785
lf your father was alive,
he'd raise a glass to that, too.

777
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,286
Hey, guys. Come here.

778
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,465
Hey, buddy!

779
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,066
There ain't nothing on Roger the Dodger.

780
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,838
Come on, l'll buy you a drink.

781
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:01,449
Things have really calmed down in here.
Remember a couple of years ago?

782
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:02,883
What will it be, Lieutenant?

783
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,387
- Coffee. Chappie?
- Scotch.

784
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,100
They're looking to hurt me, Chappie.

785
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,900
This will all blow over
in a couple of days, Mike.

786
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,733
No. They want to hurt me.

787
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:32,041
That phony Reilly, night-school commando.
Looks like a fucking choirboy.

788
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,913
All those years he rode
with that bagman Moon Mullins...

789
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,044
...you don't tell me he didn't take.

790
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,953
Nobody knows what goes on
inside a police car, right, Mike?

791
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,388
You're fucking right.

792
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:45,020
And this spic, Valentin,
what a fucking nut case.

793
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,493
He spent all his time undercover,
sleeping in abandoned buildings...

794
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:52,023
...palling with the junkies.
Christ, who can trust a narc, Chappie?

795
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,069
l always heard he was clean.

796
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:57,636
Clean? l know my ass is clean,
because l wipe it.

797
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,473
Who do you trust, Mike?

798
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,338
You. l trust you, Chappie.

799
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,575
Because we've been through it
together and separately.

800
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:12,811
You're the whitest black man l ever knew.
That's the truth, Chappie.

801
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,015
Come on, help me. They want my ass.

802
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,018
How?

803
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,828
Promise me.
l'm glad you're looking for Montalvo...

804
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:25,425
...but you have to promise me.
lf you find him, l talk to him first.

805
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,160
You know what a fucking snake he is.

806
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,163
l want him before you bring him downtown.

807
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:35,234
l don't know him. l don't know where he is.
Valentin's got a line on him.

808
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,075
You got Luis' home address?

809
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,308
l got it, but l don't know.

810
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,486
Come on, this is me you're talking to,
Mike Brennan!

811
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,646
Come on, Chappie. Come on!

812
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,451
Ten bucks.

813
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:56,865
Oh, Jesus. Look at these prices, man.
You couldn't go somewhere else?

814
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:00,864
Okay, okay! Here, l'm giving you $25.

815
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,906
l'm going to the video store.
What do you want to see tonight?

816
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,875
Whatever you want. You decide.
'Bye, Junior.

817
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,875
Hey, Mike. What are you doing up here?

818
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,379
Seeing you, Luis. That's what l'm here for.

819
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,114
How'd you find us?

820
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,979
What's your boy's name?

821
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,014
- Lucito.
- Lucito, huh?

822
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,260
l've got to see you alone, Luis. Now.

823
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,653
Sure, man. Come on.

824
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,667
Here okay, Lieutenant?

825
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:44,535
Perfect.

826
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,747
Shoot, Lieutenant.

827
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,882
l'm the wrong guy to say that to, huh?

828
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:56,415
You got a line on Montalvo
and his corn-hole buddy, Jose?

829
00:54:56,759 --> 00:54:58,659
Not yet, man, but we'll find him.

830
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,719
l got the stool brigade out looking.

831
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,527
Takes a stool to find a stool,
huh, Lieutenant?

832
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,223
You'll take him to Reilly?

833
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,893
Sure, man, where else?

834
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,663
l have to talk to him first, Luis.

835
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,105
Your friend Bobby Tex is trying to hang me.

836
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,666
l have to talk to him first before Reilly.

837
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,478
l don't know. That's rough, Lieutenant.

838
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,413
Jesus Christ.

839
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,081
Luis, you were in narcotics, right?

840
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:26,253
Yeah.

841
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,857
You worked with Alvarez,
Lopez and them guys?

842
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:31,892
Yeah.

843
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,092
$10,000.

844
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,463
What?

845
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:42,595
Don't play boy scout with me,
you nigger with straight hair.

846
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,098
You worked with Alvarez,
Lopez and them guys.

847
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,972
l'm clean, Lieutenant.

848
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,943
Don't pull my prick, Valentin.

849
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,407
l know everything that goes on.

850
00:55:56,085 --> 00:55:57,211
Everything.

851
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,511
You want particulars?

852
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,387
The Rubelo case.

853
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:05,253
- $80,000. You split it five ways.
- Four, l never went upstairs, Mike.

854
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,853
- ''Lieutenant'' to you.
- l'm clean, l swear to my kid.

855
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,262
Don't look down!

856
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,027
You look me in the face.

857
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,767
Now, are you in...

858
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,531
...for $10,000?

859
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:18,372
Yes, Lieutenant, yes.

860
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,206
The contract's closed.

861
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:26,807
$10,000, cash,
when you bring me Roger Montalvo.

862
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,584
Don't fuck with me on this one, Luis.

863
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,748
lf you fuck with me...

864
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,951
...better you piss a kidney stone
through your hard-on.

865
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,793
l understand, Lieutenant.

866
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,402
That's a nice kid.

867
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,904
<i>- Chappie, it's me.
- Yeah.</i>

868
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:55,437
He was here.

869
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:58,105
<i>- He caught me, too.
- That figures.</i>

870
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,648
Don't talk on the phone.

871
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,479
<i>- I'II see you tomorrow.
- Chappie.</i>

872
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:05,009
l'm all shook up.
This fucking guy's scaring me.

873
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,385
Have a good day off.

874
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:07,445
Chappie?

875
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,586
- That's right, $10,000.
- Wow.

876
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,751
One good thing.

877
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:16,456
You can trust Chappie and Valentin,
they didn't have to tell you.

878
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,663
- What do l do, Bloomy?
- Did you tell Quinn?

879
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,403
- l'm seeing him at 2:30.
- Don't tell him.

880
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,598
He and Brennan go back much too far.

881
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,142
From now on, you keep me informed
of everything.

882
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,576
None of this departmental-loyalty crap.

883
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,973
My boss is higher than your boss.

884
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,543
You're a lawyer now, don't forget that.

885
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:37,151
Your final responsibility is to the DA.

886
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:39,944
We can have this walk anytime you need me.

887
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:42,483
Don't worry.

888
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:47,323
Even if l were wearing a wire,
this noise would wreck the tape.

889
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,963
l thought this was going to be a simple case.

890
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,506
My final word of advice is this, Francis.

891
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:02,200
You're letting a purveyor of narcotics, a liar
and a criminal affect your judgment.

892
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,508
There are not too many of us left in this city.

893
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,340
There's only room now for a select few.

894
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,477
Stay with us, Francis.

895
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:15,082
l'm having friends in on Wednesday
for dinner and drinks. Please come.

896
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,183
The Montauk Club, 9:00 pm.

897
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:18,983
Come alone, Francis.

898
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:20,584
l want to say what l have to say,
and then l'll take you where you want to go.

899
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,792
Yes, l was shocked that day.

900
00:59:25,294 --> 00:59:27,785
l'm an lrish cop from Queens.
My father was a cop.

901
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,332
All l knew about black people was
they hated me...

902
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:32,264
...and they made my job very hard.

903
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:36,103
When we met at Brooklyn Law,
everything changed for me.

904
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,073
They're right.
Love can do that to you.

905
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:41,508
l loved being in love with a girl from the 34.

906
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:44,011
lt made me feel anything was possible
in this city.

907
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,139
l loved our life together, the school,
subway...

908
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,378
...walking you home,
the two weeks we took in St. Thomas.

909
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,053
Whatever that look on my face said to you...

910
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,022
...that wasn't how l felt.

911
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,794
l've died a thousand times since.

912
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:07,029
Every unanswered phone call, every time
you ran away from me on the street...

913
01:00:12,341 --> 01:00:15,242
...every time l looked at
your empty chair in class.

914
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,473
Then you disappeared,
and l've been dying since.

915
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:21,244
A little piece of me every day for six years.

916
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,288
All l do is work.
l got this new apartment with...

917
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,784
...no furniture in it.

918
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:41,801
l loved you then.

919
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,934
l loved you while you were gone.

920
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,306
l love you now.

921
01:00:56,852 --> 01:00:58,945
Nancy, l'll do whatever you want.

922
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,600
You know, something can happen...

923
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,462
...a little thing...

924
01:01:17,873 --> 01:01:19,602
...and everything changes.

925
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,107
Like one time, l was with this guy...

926
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,272
...and he came into my bedroom...

927
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,374
...and he was naked,
except he still had his socks on.

928
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,750
And l just started to laugh.

929
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:34,913
And just like that,
l wasn't in love with him anymore.

930
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:43,456
So that's what happened
the day that you met my father.

931
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,092
Everything went out of me then.

932
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,537
Everything left me.

933
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,003
Good-bye, rainbow people...

934
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,271
...good-bye, good times...

935
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,902
...good-bye, paralegal.

936
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,180
lt was everything.

937
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,720
Maybe you were right about one thing.

938
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,089
Maybe l was testing you.

939
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,955
Maybe l didn't want to tell you
that my father was black.

940
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,018
Maybe l wanted to see your face...

941
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:16,087
...naked, no guard up, how you really felt...

942
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,792
...hoping l would be wrong
about something that l knew my entire life.

943
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,667
lf l was testing you...

944
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:25,104
...l found out...

945
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,308
...and you failed, white boy.

946
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,176
You can do one thing for me.

947
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:36,245
lf you're going after Bobby,
don't do it because of you and me...

948
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,184
...because of us.

949
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:43,449
Things were not so great for me
all those years that l was gone.

950
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:48,189
He found me and he got me off dope.

951
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:52,164
He takes care of my mother
and my little brothers. He loves me...

952
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,793
...as much as you do.

953
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:01,132
l'm going to Broadway 96, you know it?

954
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,183
Yeah, l know it.

955
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,505
You're so beautiful.

956
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:18,144
Gentlemen, my wife, Nancy.

957
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,745
Honey, l want you to meet
Hank Mastroangelo.

958
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,088
Stand up, Hank.

959
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:25,048
Come on.

960
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:26,890
Come on, yeah.

961
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:31,524
His friend whose name l don't know.
You know Larry and Bruno, of course.

962
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,398
Armandito and Alfonsito Segal.

963
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,680
l can't stand this spic shit.

964
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:50,183
l'm going to the bar.
Have Bobby join me for a drink.

965
01:04:50,252 --> 01:04:53,813
Tell him to come alone. l don't want
those two cokeheads anywhere near me.

966
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:56,449
Bobby Tex is okay, he's done all right for us.

967
01:04:56,992 --> 01:04:58,755
You made money with Bobby, huh?

968
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,921
We all have, he's a good kid.

969
01:05:01,096 --> 01:05:03,530
- You know what's going on?
- Well, no.

970
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,894
Then mind your own fucking business.

971
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:46,867
Bobby, you've been with us
a few years, right?

972
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:48,874
- And we looked out for you.
- Always.

973
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:51,242
- No static on the street, right?
- No, no.

974
01:05:51,313 --> 01:05:53,372
- No interference from us, right?
- Never.

975
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:57,014
You always get first crack
on the merchandise and the price is fair?

976
01:05:57,086 --> 01:05:59,350
l've always done the right thing back to you.

977
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:02,117
- No complaints, you're reliable-
- What's the beef?

978
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,955
These two shooters
you just brought up from Miami. Why?

979
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:08,019
- They're two nice Jewish boys from Cuba.
- You're kidding me.

980
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,463
- Cuban Hebes?
- Sephardic.

981
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,061
That means no hits on Saturday, huh?

982
01:06:13,435 --> 01:06:15,926
Bobby, don't shit me.

983
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:19,040
l need some protection now from Brennan.

984
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:22,066
- He's gonna whack me.
- What makes you say that?

985
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,339
He killed Julio, now Tony. He's after me.

986
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:27,246
l'm not sitting still and letting him do this.

987
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,307
The balance is very delicate, right?

988
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,580
We can't disturb what's going on downtown.

989
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,248
l keep my hands in my pockets
while he's tracking me?

990
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:37,781
Take a vacation, let things cool off.
We'll straighten this out.

991
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,420
But do not hurt that person, you understand?

992
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:41,585
No way.

993
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,957
Don't forget, you dropped him in.

994
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,999
You want to protect yourself
and your quiff, okay.

995
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,804
But stay away. You've been told.

996
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,846
Bad news or what?

997
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:05,142
Brennan plucked my wings,
he's trying to muzzle my beak.

998
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,517
We'll fuck him.

999
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,258
lt's taken care of.

1000
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:14,989
Mr. Texador.

1001
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:21,696
Nothing to worry about.

1002
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:24,031
They did pretty good, huh? Come on.

1003
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,973
Mr. Texador, please!

1004
01:07:33,048 --> 01:07:35,516
You don't come at me like that!

1005
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,477
Of course, l'm sorry.

1006
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:43,317
l'm Jose Malpica, Roger Montalvo's friend.
l design his clothes-

1007
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,485
What do you want to see me about?

1008
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,593
They're okay.

1009
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:51,163
l've been waiting all night
for those guineas to leave.

1010
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:55,727
l've been dancing my ass off, my feet
are killing me, these shoes are too small.

1011
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,838
lt's Roger, he wants to see you.

1012
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:02,572
Good. You don't mind coming along.

1013
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:24,462
Where are we going?

1014
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,262
He's in my dressing room.

1015
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,699
- After you-
- No way, Jose, you first.

1016
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:02,059
Montalvo, my man.

1017
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,396
<i>HoIa, puss.</i>

1018
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,069
l'm upset. l want her with me.

1019
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:09,406
Loose lips sink ships, send her home.

1020
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:12,545
l'll call you later.
l'll let you know where l'll be.

1021
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:14,707
Want to get the fuck out of here?

1022
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:23,515
- Want some snort?
- No, thanks. l'm a seller, not a buyer.

1023
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,413
- Brennan's gonna kill me, Bobby.
- l know.

1024
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:48,540
- You know he's going to kill you, too.
- He's gonna try.

1025
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:50,808
That's why l got my two friends now.

1026
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:53,787
Please, he'll crush them
into wine, honey.

1027
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,490
l want to tell you something.

1028
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,889
l'm gay,
and on the street that means tough...

1029
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:01,191
...but Brennan scares the shit out of me.

1030
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,629
lt's his eyes, you know, he's a fag killer.

1031
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:07,100
And like all those guys, he's gay.
He doesn't know it, but the man is gay.

1032
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:09,466
You faggots say that about everybody.

1033
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,502
l hate him so fucking much.

1034
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,704
You stool for him, fuck.

1035
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:16,472
lt was four years ago. He got me out of stir.

1036
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:19,146
l'm a three-time loser, Bobby.

1037
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:21,673
l'm not getting any younger.

1038
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,342
You went to work for him.

1039
01:10:23,418 --> 01:10:26,546
lt wasn't easy, but he did get me out.

1040
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,919
l'm always hiding from him,
but he finds me.

1041
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,925
lt's like a fucking nightmare.

1042
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,353
Anyway, last year he comes to me.

1043
01:10:33,428 --> 01:10:36,989
He wants some names checked out.
Who was where, who's doing what.

1044
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,928
So, you know, l find out.

1045
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,869
And l realize it was the old Sinners gang.

1046
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,404
My club? Really?

1047
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,799
- We split up 20 years ago.
- That's what l said.

1048
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,401
Four of you guys got wasted
one way or another...

1049
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,174
...and only three were left.

1050
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:55,148
There was Sierra
and there was Tony and me.

1051
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:57,276
Tony and Sierra were working for you.

1052
01:10:57,352 --> 01:11:00,219
- You fingered Tony for him.
- There was nothing l could do.

1053
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,780
He found me that night.
He can't do it in the club...

1054
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,383
...so he makes me call Tony outside,
and he jams him.

1055
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,826
Thing is, now you're the only one left.

1056
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:11,757
You're a faggot motherfucker.

1057
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,402
He's probably waiting outside
for me right now.

1058
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:18,132
l won't do that to you, Bobby.

1059
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:21,233
You think l'm gonna team up
with some faggot stool-pigeon.

1060
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,244
You fucking little douchebag.

1061
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:26,246
l'll take you out right now,
for Tony and Sierra.

1062
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:28,510
- Yeah, but you won't.
- Don't be sure.

1063
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,379
You gonna knock off a police lieutenant?

1064
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:34,183
Not unless you're crazy, baby,
and crazy you are not.

1065
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:36,952
l'm your witness,
with me you can take him out legally.

1066
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:40,688
- l'm the one who can-
- You're a dead man when he finds you.

1067
01:11:40,762 --> 01:11:43,959
What do think l contacted you for?
So that you could tell me this?

1068
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:47,524
You got the money, the boats,
the planes and you need me...

1069
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:49,326
...alive.

1070
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,108
l can't go to the grand jury without him.

1071
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:57,038
There's no doubt now,
Brennan took Tony out.

1072
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:00,604
That's why he offered money for the stool.
Any word on where he is now?

1073
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:02,513
No man, nothing's happening.

1074
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:08,388
Chappie, you said that if Brennan
came up dirty, you won't take him in.

1075
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:10,721
l'll accept that. But nothing short of it.

1076
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:12,384
You want me to tail him?

1077
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,520
- lf he gets to the stool-
- All right.

1078
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,621
- You're a cop, Chappie.
- No shit.

1079
01:12:16,698 --> 01:12:20,156
You're a natural shadow Chappie,
invisible in the night.

1080
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,792
Fuck you, fartmaker.

1081
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:25,272
Should l put somebody else on this?

1082
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:28,309
No, man, he'll do it.
He'll hate it, but he'll do it.

1083
01:12:44,726 --> 01:12:47,593
l'll ask you straight.
You been in touch with Brennan...

1084
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:50,757
- ...since this investigation started?
- No, why?

1085
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,963
l think he's getting some information
about what we're working on.

1086
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,369
Fuck this shit. Fuck this shit, man.

1087
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,397
l had to ask, that's all.

1088
01:12:59,474 --> 01:13:03,570
Look, choirboy, l don't spy, lie, or cheat.
You knew how l felt.

1089
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,079
- You want me off, l'm off.
- No, your work's good.

1090
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,639
- Sorry l had to ask.
- Anything else?

1091
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,184
Got to admit, you and Brennan is
not exactly a natural combination.

1092
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:14,552
Yeah? Why not?

1093
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:19,154
<i>Jesus Christ,
l mean every word out of his mouth...</i>

1094
01:13:19,227 --> 01:13:20,888
You'd know better than anybody.

1095
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:25,059
lt's no big deal, it's just his way.
At least with him, it's out in the open.

1096
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:27,496
How do you take it?

1097
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,094
l told you, no problem. He's him. l'm me.

1098
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:34,207
What about the others?

1099
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,801
- What others?
- The ones not so out in the open.

1100
01:13:36,878 --> 01:13:39,972
Fuck them. They're them, l'm still me.

1101
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,343
<i>Can you...</i>

1102
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,819
Can you spot them?

1103
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:48,381
Shit, yeah.

1104
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:54,186
You see,
they ask a lot of dumb questions...

1105
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:57,188
...about what it's like
being a black policeman.

1106
01:13:57,265 --> 01:13:58,562
Shit like that.

1107
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:01,130
Anything else?

1108
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:03,430
No, Chappie.

1109
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:07,371
Listen, Al, you're not a bad kid,
but get one thing straight about me.

1110
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,844
You want to know what color l am,
inside and out?

1111
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:12,002
l'm blue.

1112
01:14:12,647 --> 01:14:17,584
When l was in the corps, l was olive drab,
or camouflage, or dress blues...

1113
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,153
...or whatever was
the fucking uniform of the day.

1114
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:23,854
- You got it?
- l got it.

1115
01:14:26,661 --> 01:14:29,255
Y'all take care now, you hear?

1116
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,648
Oh, God, it should have come to this.

1117
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,913
- You'll be comfortable very soon.
- Where are we going?

1118
01:15:25,987 --> 01:15:28,455
Puerto Rico. You'll stay on a nice boat.

1119
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,985
l get seasick. l absolutely hate boats.

1120
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:34,153
Don't be an asshole. lt's tied up at my dock.

1121
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:38,499
All the candy you need.
A nice baby-sitter. You want a baby-sitter?

1122
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:41,602
l'm going to try to be true to Jose.
lt'll do me good.

1123
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,195
<i>Ay Dios mío, what did l ever do
to deserve this?</i>

1124
01:15:44,272 --> 01:15:45,398
Everything.

1125
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:49,642
Anything l can do for you
while l'm down here?

1126
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,077
Sorry, Nancy, but l just don't eat fish.

1127
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,149
<i>Now listen to me, maricón.</i>

1128
01:15:56,284 --> 01:15:59,720
Sometimes you're not that funny,
you know what l mean?

1129
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:01,587
Just keep respect.

1130
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:06,017
Oh, you brute.

1131
01:16:31,419 --> 01:16:34,547
That ends my official duties.
l will leave you now.

1132
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:39,090
Dirty stories are okay, even stag films...

1133
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,161
...but there will be no girls.

1134
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:45,055
- Send Gerald back with the car.
- l will. Goodnight, everybody.

1135
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,225
Goodnight.

1136
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,280
Leave those. Thank you.

1137
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,879
What conclusion did you reach, Bob?

1138
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:06,943
The best.

1139
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:11,353
Your recognition factor is almost as high
as the Governor's or the Mayor's.

1140
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:15,055
The image factor couldn't be better.
Crime fighter, straight as an arrow.

1141
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,098
Poor boy who made it, ex-cop.

1142
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:21,158
You're strong in Queens, Staten lsland,
the Jewish and ltalian parts of Brooklyn.

1143
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,170
Nassau and Suffolk are a wrap.

1144
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,738
Now, the good news.

1145
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:28,540
Stronger as we move upstate
except for isolated pockets of blacks...

1146
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,704
...around Troy, Utica, Buffalo.
Nothing we didn't expect.

1147
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,871
But that together with Levy for governor...

1148
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:38,246
...Amalfitano for lieutenant governor...

1149
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,384
...it's the perfect ticket.

1150
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:45,259
Money clearly is no problem.
Just look at this crowd.

1151
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:48,158
And that's not counting Agnes' dowry.

1152
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,096
That's a lot to invest
for an Attorney General.

1153
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,561
l'm ahead of you.

1154
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,761
Levy thinks he can be
the first Jewish president.

1155
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,463
l told him it's not time yet...

1156
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:58,870
...but when he gets the bug,
what do you do?

1157
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,238
He figures, at worst, vice president.

1158
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:05,041
ln two years time,
he's gonna make a run for it.

1159
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,215
He resigns the governorship,
Amalfitano moves up.

1160
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,547
- lf we take it that year.
- We will.

1161
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:14,180
We move Amalfitano to the Supreme Court,
maybe even the Federal bench.

1162
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:17,885
That leaves you sitting in the catbird seat
for the special election.

1163
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:20,291
So, Kevin?

1164
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,228
Let's go for it.

1165
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:24,921
Kevin...

1166
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,525
...you've fought the good fight.

1167
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,769
Holding fast year after year.

1168
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,135
Here's to the next Attorney General.

1169
01:18:34,442 --> 01:18:35,568
Hear, hear.

1170
01:18:40,815 --> 01:18:43,375
You need a Puerto Rican skag peddler?

1171
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:46,450
For six years l've been with you wops.

1172
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:50,389
l've saved you guys from big junk collars,
traced lost stuff, fingered stools.

1173
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:53,427
l've even gone on
special assignments for you, Nick.

1174
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:57,889
You're telling me you need Bobby Tex?

1175
01:18:57,999 --> 01:18:59,728
He runs a good operation, Mike.

1176
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:02,167
Let's wait, see if we can straighten this out-

1177
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,637
lf you had a square asshole,
you'd shit bricks.

1178
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:07,539
- l don't want to hear that shit.
- Watch your mouth.

1179
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:10,309
You're gonna put on your Al Capone face?

1180
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:13,541
You want to step out right now?
You want guns right here?

1181
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:16,846
You want to go in the kitchen with knives?
You're talking to me.

1182
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,887
l chew up you fucking wise guys
and spit out fags! You hear?

1183
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,857
Mike, come on my friend.

1184
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:26,060
We're all friends here.

1185
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,151
Why are you so angry?

1186
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:30,424
l'll tell you why Nick, l know you guys.

1187
01:19:30,498 --> 01:19:33,194
You'd crawl over your dying mother
to fuck your sister.

1188
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:36,260
<i>When l need you, me, a harp...
l know how you talk about me.</i>

1189
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:39,034
l get this ''he runs a good operation'' shit.

1190
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,243
l'm telling you Nick,
if l go down on this one...

1191
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:45,703
...l'm taking everybody with me.

1192
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:49,546
And listen,
if you're thinking of taking me out...

1193
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:52,916
...they got this new Assistant DA Reilly.
He's a real choirboy.

1194
01:19:52,987 --> 01:19:55,319
He likes me. He thinks l'm hot shit.

1195
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:58,484
He gets a big envelope
the first day l don't show up for work.

1196
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,298
Mike is right.

1197
01:20:08,169 --> 01:20:13,368
What are we talking about here,
this Bobby Tex, a spic stool-pigeon?

1198
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:17,368
We're going to lose
a man like Mike here for that?

1199
01:20:17,645 --> 01:20:18,942
Bury him, Hank.

1200
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,641
Larry, you set it up. You're close to him.

1201
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:24,344
We'll get on it tonight, Nick.

1202
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,408
Done.

1203
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,012
You see, Mike, no reason to get angry.

1204
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:32,890
l understand...

1205
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:36,220
...it's not like the old days.

1206
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:41,266
We got spics and niggers
mixed up with everything.

1207
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:46,069
With us, the police force,
detectives, inspectors.

1208
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:51,974
You come to a crime scene,
you don't know who to shoot.

1209
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,145
Go home, Mike, it's over.

1210
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:01,144
Okay.

1211
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:04,351
Sorry, Hank.

1212
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:22,367
He's trouble.

1213
01:21:23,244 --> 01:21:24,802
lt's too bad.

1214
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:27,781
- He was good for us.
- Right away, Nick?

1215
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:31,579
No. Tex first, that'll calm Mike a little...

1216
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:36,389
...while we check out this Reilly guy.
lt's probably bullshit.

1217
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,049
lt is. l've seen the guy. We're covered.

1218
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:43,261
You see what happens
when you go outside your own?

1219
01:21:44,732 --> 01:21:48,293
Maybe it's better this way.
Clean out the pipes.

1220
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,529
Start a whole new operation.

1221
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,768
Anybody know any chinks?

1222
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,444
- Phillie.
- How's it going?

1223
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:05,543
Danny, how do you like San Juan?

1224
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:06,676
lt's hot.

1225
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:11,221
<i>PIease don't Ieave your cars unattended
whiIe waiting for passengers to disembark.</i>

1226
01:22:23,304 --> 01:22:24,293
Yes?

1227
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,930
lt's me, Larry. l just got in.

1228
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:30,203
- How about some dinner?
- You got it, my friend.

1229
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:33,845
How about the Gobernador?
You took me there once. lt was terrific.

1230
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:35,746
<i>That's sweII with me, Larry.</i>

1231
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:38,717
8:30. Pick me up
in the lobby of the Marriott.

1232
01:22:39,153 --> 01:22:41,314
And Bobby, l'm alone.

1233
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:44,517
Leave the Cubans at home.
They scare the shit out of me.

1234
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:45,982
8:30.

1235
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:54,064
You guys get here around 8:30.
l'll get here at 9:00.

1236
01:22:54,435 --> 01:22:57,268
Danny, you stay on the wheel
on that side of the island.

1237
01:22:57,338 --> 01:22:59,363
Phillie, when you start to us...

1238
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:02,443
...l'll get out of his car.
He'll be on the driver's side.

1239
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,809
You pop him, go for the head,
then vroom, you're out of here.

1240
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:08,412
Separate flights back, it's a snap.

1241
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:09,609
You got it.

1242
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:38,911
Danny, pour me another margarita.

1243
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:15,243
That's some sign
you got on the door out there.

1244
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,379
l guess since l'm here, l got no choice, huh?

1245
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:20,079
Lieutenant.

1246
01:24:20,421 --> 01:24:22,787
Boy, that's some show you guys put on.

1247
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:26,293
No, really.

1248
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:29,555
- You were there tonight.
- Damn right.

1249
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:33,797
Jesus, l could have sworn
those were girls up there dancing.

1250
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:41,107
That chorus, they work really hard.

1251
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,474
Jesus, that end guy, what legs.

1252
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,105
That gets a guy horny, you know?

1253
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,615
His name is Michael, like yours.

1254
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:56,122
No shit? Wow.

1255
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:02,463
You look pretty good up there yourself.

1256
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,332
You want it, Mike.

1257
01:25:07,935 --> 01:25:09,334
Yeah, $100.

1258
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:11,705
l pitch, you catch.

1259
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:15,205
Let me get some of this crud off.

1260
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,437
All right, let me help you.

1261
01:25:18,112 --> 01:25:20,444
We'll go over to your place, all right?

1262
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:24,174
We'll take this Vaseline here.

1263
01:25:24,519 --> 01:25:27,181
And l've got K-Y.

1264
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:33,224
Just wipe this off, a little bit.

1265
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:12,432
So, what would you like me to wear?

1266
01:26:13,367 --> 01:26:16,268
Bra? Panties?

1267
01:26:17,371 --> 01:26:18,668
Garter belt?

1268
01:26:20,641 --> 01:26:22,040
Whatever, lover.

1269
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:24,703
Give me a few minutes.

1270
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:55,806
<i>This is Marty.
You come Iate again tonight, you're fired.</i>

1271
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:03,784
<i>This is Vince. CaII me.</i>

1272
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:13,718
<i>Hi, it's Roger.
You better be home tonight, you faggot.</i>

1273
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:16,920
<i>I'm on a boat in fucking Puerto Rico.
Can you beIieve it?</i>

1274
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,295
<i>It's too tacky.</i>

1275
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:21,231
<i>He caIIs it The Nancy. I couId vomit.</i>

1276
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:25,136
<i>I'm so IoneIy, I couId die.
CaII me tonight or I'II go crazy.</i>

1277
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:28,175
<i>809-555-7171.</i>

1278
01:27:28,242 --> 01:27:32,042
<i>There's a payphone at the end of the pier.
I can hear it ring from the boat.</i>

1279
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:33,910
<i>Let it ring a Iong time.</i>

1280
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:38,008
<i>Bobby Tex has a boat with no phone.
Can you beIieve it?</i>

1281
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:51,324
Don't be scared, lover.

1282
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,698
This isn't your first time, is it?

1283
01:27:58,072 --> 01:27:59,164
Come here.

1284
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:04,068
Come here. Come on.

1285
01:28:15,489 --> 01:28:16,649
Turn around.

1286
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:53,655
Larry, it's this way.

1287
01:28:55,062 --> 01:28:56,552
lt's this way.

1288
01:29:14,348 --> 01:29:16,248
Something on your mind, Larry?

1289
01:29:16,817 --> 01:29:19,445
No, l'm just feeling the jet lag.

1290
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,645
Really? How come? lt's the same time.

1291
01:29:39,473 --> 01:29:42,533
Jesus, Bobby,
l never thought you'd do this to me.

1292
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,335
l came down here to warn you.
They want to hurt you.

1293
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:46,402
Cut the shit.

1294
01:29:48,215 --> 01:29:50,080
Your two gunsels are out of action.

1295
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,251
You're left holding it.

1296
01:29:53,321 --> 01:29:57,052
Jesus, Bobby, we made money.
Didn't l make money for you?

1297
01:29:57,124 --> 01:29:59,615
<i>Chicken-plucking guinea,
if you make it back...</i>

1298
01:30:00,761 --> 01:30:02,490
l ain't decided that yet.

1299
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:06,389
When you make it back,
carry this message for me to your bosses.

1300
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:08,958
- l didn't put the finger on you-
- Shut up.

1301
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:12,404
l'm getting out now.

1302
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:17,007
l'm going to bury your boy Brennan,
but legally. l got my proof.

1303
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,315
He jammed Sierra and Tony.
l want his ass.

1304
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:26,016
lf they stay in this corner,
they'll have another war on their hands.

1305
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:29,147
l'll make Miami look like a little place
where the monks live.

1306
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:33,491
lf they let me settle this now,
between me and Brennan...

1307
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,155
...they're never going to see
or hear from me again.

1308
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:39,563
They can name whoever they want
to run things uptown. l'll disappear.

1309
01:30:39,633 --> 01:30:41,328
l don't ask for separation pay.

1310
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:44,534
l think you know my word is good.

1311
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:46,363
So do they.

1312
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:48,701
Can l leave now?

1313
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:50,903
Sure, get out of here, scumbag.

1314
01:30:53,547 --> 01:30:56,983
l've got nothing against you, Bobby.
l take orders like everybody else.

1315
01:30:57,051 --> 01:31:00,282
Get out of here,
before l make you beg for your life.

1316
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:28,270
Yeah.

1317
01:31:28,482 --> 01:31:30,541
<i>Is this the Assistant DA ReiIIy?</i>

1318
01:31:30,851 --> 01:31:32,580
Yeah, who's this?

1319
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,353
<i>Bobby Tex.</i>

1320
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:38,919
What's up?

1321
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:42,258
How about that whole fucking city,
if you don't do what l say?

1322
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:47,825
l'm at the Hilton. l'm here in San Juan,
and l want you on the first plane out.

1323
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:50,097
And that leaves Kennedy at 7:00 a.m.

1324
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:51,293
<i>Why?</i>

1325
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:53,135
l got Roger the Dodger.

1326
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:57,000
Does he finger Brennan?

1327
01:31:57,078 --> 01:31:59,103
<i>Brennan is the Ieast of it.</i>

1328
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:01,414
How would you like Quinn?

1329
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:03,072
What?

1330
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:06,119
<i>- You want me to keep taIking on the phone?
- No, l'm on my way.</i>

1331
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,779
Three things:

1332
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:11,086
You talk to anybody, all bets are off,
we've got to disappear.

1333
01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:13,350
<i>- Two, no wires, please.
- Okay.</i>

1334
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:16,794
<i>And three, no Chappie.
'Cause that spook...</i>

1335
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:20,167
l want to tell you that
he's been ratting you out to Brennan.

1336
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:24,263
<i>- l'll bring Valentin and one other.
- Okay.</i>

1337
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:28,540
lf you're not here on the first plane,
l'll know you went to your bosses...

1338
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:32,272
...and then you're going to have
to look for us. So you just obey me.

1339
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:35,338
You know, you're in over your head as it is.

1340
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:38,312
That's the whole reason
they put you on this case.

1341
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:55,993
Bloomy, were you asleep?

1342
01:32:57,571 --> 01:33:00,039
Of course, what's up?

1343
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:03,940
l've got to go to Puerto Rico, first plane.
The eyewitness is there.

1344
01:33:04,011 --> 01:33:05,171
<i>What witness?</i>

1345
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:07,347
The Tony Vasquez killing.

1346
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:09,913
lt was no self-defense,
Brennan took him out.

1347
01:33:10,818 --> 01:33:11,807
Jesus.

1348
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:13,681
You told Quinn?

1349
01:33:13,954 --> 01:33:15,854
l can't, Bloomy, he's in it.

1350
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:20,785
My God, Quinn.

1351
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:24,360
l don't know how yet, but...

1352
01:33:24,598 --> 01:33:27,726
...l trust this witness
and that's why l have to be on that plane.

1353
01:33:27,801 --> 01:33:30,770
Leave a night message
you won't be in tomorrow.

1354
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:33,266
Not a word of this to anyone.

1355
01:33:33,974 --> 01:33:36,534
<i>- Take your flight.
- Yeah, I'd Iike to bring two men.</i>

1356
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:40,808
Anything you need, l'll call administration
and have them authorize the tickets.

1357
01:33:42,316 --> 01:33:45,752
<i>- Al? l have to take this to my boss, the DA.
- Yeah.</i>

1358
01:33:47,354 --> 01:33:50,289
<i>This is very big, you taIk onIy to me.</i>

1359
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:54,417
Be careful. Good luck.

1360
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,771
That's the best phone call l've ever gotten.

1361
01:34:04,838 --> 01:34:06,931
Back to the land of my fathers, you know?

1362
01:34:07,007 --> 01:34:10,204
Not going to have time to enjoy it,
we're coming back tonight.

1363
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:13,371
You're kidding me.
What the hell is going on?

1364
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,914
l'm meeting Bobby Tex,
that's all l can tell you.

1365
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:19,077
We may have to bring someone back.
lt's going to be your ass...

1366
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:21,314
- ...if anything happens to him.
- Shooting?

1367
01:34:22,623 --> 01:34:24,523
Zucker, you're still a virgin, man?

1368
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:27,322
You heard about this guy, Al?
They call him ''The Virgin.''

1369
01:34:27,494 --> 01:34:30,895
Eighteen years on the force,
six on Narcotics, four on Safe and Loft...

1370
01:34:30,965 --> 01:34:32,830
...and the guy's never fired a gun.

1371
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,461
Four years and l bury the damn thing.

1372
01:34:35,703 --> 01:34:39,469
<i>TWA FIight Number 413 to San Juan...</i>

1373
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:09,858
Taxi.

1374
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,273
Takes your breath away, don't it?

1375
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:03,376
You hate guys like me, don't you?

1376
01:37:04,685 --> 01:37:07,848
Well, $1,600 worth of silk on my back.

1377
01:37:09,289 --> 01:37:11,655
And you with those
Delancey Street originals.

1378
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:13,192
l'm cops, you're robbers.

1379
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,785
Not to mention our little competition here.

1380
01:37:16,063 --> 01:37:18,554
Some of this is going to get tough on you.

1381
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:20,031
Because l want out.

1382
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:24,126
l want to get away from you cops
and wops and junkies.

1383
01:37:24,204 --> 01:37:25,501
Are you turning?

1384
01:37:25,606 --> 01:37:27,665
Who the fuck are you?

1385
01:37:29,643 --> 01:37:33,272
You're talking to Roberto Texador,
not Roger ''the Dodger'' Montalvo, okay?

1386
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:39,542
You know, you better look around.

1387
01:37:40,854 --> 01:37:42,549
There's a whole world out here.

1388
01:37:42,756 --> 01:37:44,621
A nice one, maybe.

1389
01:37:45,225 --> 01:37:47,420
l want to take a look.

1390
01:37:47,494 --> 01:37:50,463
Right now, l'm sitting around here.
l'm waiting for a bullet.

1391
01:37:50,964 --> 01:37:51,726
Nancy.

1392
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:55,435
She deserves better, don't you think?
l mean, who knows, maybe kids.

1393
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,769
l really love her...

1394
01:37:58,338 --> 01:37:59,635
...and she likes me.

1395
01:38:00,274 --> 01:38:02,174
We're good together, you know?

1396
01:38:05,245 --> 01:38:07,236
l told you, this can get tough.

1397
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:10,077
So now that you're a good guy,
what about the bad guys?

1398
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:11,344
Okay.

1399
01:38:11,485 --> 01:38:13,453
Do you know Brennan's on a contract?

1400
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:17,016
l'm the last installment
and that troubles me.

1401
01:38:17,758 --> 01:38:19,817
Roger put me onto this.

1402
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:23,630
- Who put the contract out?
- l've got to go back a little now.

1403
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:25,927
Twenty-four,
maybe even twenty-five years.

1404
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:29,167
You got a bunch of tough kids, PRs.

1405
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:33,035
We used to call ourselves the Sinners then.
We were pretty tough.

1406
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:34,471
We rumbled.

1407
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:37,169
- l mean we rumbled with anybody.
- You were bad then.

1408
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:39,337
- You ever do anything, make anybody?
- No.

1409
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:40,812
Nickel-and-dime stuff.

1410
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:44,112
You protect a fruit stand, man,
a shoeshine parlor, you know?

1411
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:47,951
You run a few numbers for the coons
when they need some extra people.

1412
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:50,649
We liked to rumble, we got down.

1413
01:38:54,728 --> 01:38:57,288
We had a kid, his name was Skinny.

1414
01:38:57,865 --> 01:38:59,560
He used to deliver for the A&P.

1415
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,462
He sort of thought we were the thing.
He had a pistol.

1416
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:06,101
lf we had a bad rumble coming up
we used to take this kid along.

1417
01:39:06,173 --> 01:39:08,607
ln those days it was okay
to use a ringer or two.

1418
01:39:08,675 --> 01:39:13,112
Some of these kids were coming all the way
from Long lsland. They were a little stupid.

1419
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:15,078
<i>Then anyway, this kid, Skinny...</i>

1420
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:17,942
See, l'd never seen anyone that bad.

1421
01:39:18,252 --> 01:39:20,812
This kid would stand
in the middle of the street...

1422
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:23,186
...with the bullets flying all around him.

1423
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:24,952
But he didn't give a shit.

1424
01:39:27,027 --> 01:39:28,927
This kid would empty his rod, man.

1425
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:31,760
He wouldn't even take cover
when he'd go to reload.

1426
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:34,933
This guy was trying to show the PRs
he had more balls.

1427
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:36,469
He wasn't Puerto Rican?

1428
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:38,334
No, he was lrish, a little older.

1429
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:42,239
He couldn't hang out with his own,
because there was nobody up there for him.

1430
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:45,641
<i>Wait a minute, l'm ahead of you.
Skinny grows up...</i>

1431
01:39:46,547 --> 01:39:49,641
That's what l'm telling you.
Kevin Tharon Quinn. Skinny.

1432
01:39:50,017 --> 01:39:52,451
- You guys had something on him?
- Yeah.

1433
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:58,355
One day we're talking away to
this little bodega owner we knew, Sal Garcia.

1434
01:39:58,458 --> 01:39:59,720
Sweetest little guy.

1435
01:39:59,993 --> 01:40:02,791
We wanted to raise him,
$5 a week, it was a goof.

1436
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:05,922
Come off a rumble,
we'd beat the shit out of a gang.

1437
01:40:05,999 --> 01:40:08,058
Who was it?
The Dyckman Street Angels.

1438
01:40:08,135 --> 01:40:10,000
Skinny was with us with his piece.

1439
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:12,998
But the little guy Garcia,
he starts carrying on.

1440
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:16,509
He says, ''That's it, l'm not paying now.
Get the fuck out.''

1441
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:18,044
He picked up a bat, right?

1442
01:40:18,211 --> 01:40:20,338
Skinny popped him.

1443
01:40:20,747 --> 01:40:23,443
- Jesus H. Christ.
- Just like that, l couldn't believe it.

1444
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:25,882
Twelve years ago, Al...

1445
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:30,922
...l'm down in General Session,
but there's a big trial going on downstairs.

1446
01:40:31,024 --> 01:40:34,323
- Remember the Fuentes case?
- Yeah, one of Quinn's big wins.

1447
01:40:36,763 --> 01:40:39,323
l see him in the corridor,
you know, he was...

1448
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,660
...very different.

1449
01:40:43,503 --> 01:40:44,731
But he was the same.

1450
01:40:45,672 --> 01:40:48,800
You know what l mean?
We're still talking about good ol' Skinny.

1451
01:40:49,843 --> 01:40:51,708
So what's he got on Brennan...

1452
01:40:51,778 --> 01:40:53,973
...to make him the hit man?

1453
01:40:54,848 --> 01:40:55,837
l don't know.

1454
01:40:58,085 --> 01:41:01,248
That shouldn't be too hard to find out,
Brennan's wide open.

1455
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:06,554
Give me a Q&A on this,
there's no statute of limitations on murder.

1456
01:41:06,627 --> 01:41:07,616
l'm not a rat.

1457
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:10,689
You tell Quinn that.
He's got nothing to fear from me.

1458
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:12,129
All l want from him...

1459
01:41:12,933 --> 01:41:14,730
...he calls Brennan off.

1460
01:41:15,769 --> 01:41:18,067
Now he calls Brennan off...

1461
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:21,440
...l never heard of Skinny.

1462
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:24,773
That's an even trade, man.
Quinn goes on wherever he's going.

1463
01:41:24,845 --> 01:41:26,369
Brennan goes on being a cop.

1464
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,505
You're going to come out a hero.

1465
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,205
Me?

1466
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:34,479
l'm going to disappear.

1467
01:41:35,822 --> 01:41:39,189
l'm going to take Roger Montalvo's
signed statement in my pocket...

1468
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:40,954
...l'll get it done right here.

1469
01:41:42,929 --> 01:41:45,329
What makes you think l'll be a party to this?

1470
01:41:45,499 --> 01:41:47,899
Because l know
how guilty you feel about Nancy.

1471
01:41:48,001 --> 01:41:50,868
You know this is her chance for a life. So?

1472
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,832
You talk to Quinn, okay?
He might even be expecting you.

1473
01:41:59,513 --> 01:42:03,142
But if l don't hear from you in a week,
me and Roger are going to disappear.

1474
01:42:03,216 --> 01:42:04,740
You'll be the only one left.

1475
01:42:04,818 --> 01:42:07,480
And you're going to be sitting
on a lot of information.

1476
01:42:07,554 --> 01:42:11,081
That's not a good place to be
with Brennan back there on the loose.

1477
01:42:17,864 --> 01:42:18,660
<i>BIoomy.</i>

1478
01:42:19,132 --> 01:42:21,362
l've been waiting for your call. Tell me.

1479
01:42:21,435 --> 01:42:24,336
We leave in an hour,
the plane gets in at 3:00 a.m.

1480
01:42:24,771 --> 01:42:28,764
l've got to lay this out for you and the boss.
lt's everything l told you and worse.

1481
01:42:29,943 --> 01:42:30,739
Quinn.

1482
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:33,202
Up to his lips, Bloomy.

1483
01:42:33,447 --> 01:42:37,679
The District Attorney, his Executive Assistant,
and Administrative Assistant...

1484
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:39,578
...will meet you at 4:00 a.m.

1485
01:42:40,353 --> 01:42:42,048
They're waiting for my call now.

1486
01:42:42,622 --> 01:42:44,021
You got Roger with you?

1487
01:42:44,157 --> 01:42:45,146
<i>Not this trip.</i>

1488
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:48,784
Send your cops home then.
They're not to come here, you understand?

1489
01:42:48,929 --> 01:42:49,953
<i>I got it.</i>

1490
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:52,828
4:00 a.m. We'll wait for you,
even if your plane is late.

1491
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:03,540
Cangrejos Yacht Club.

1492
01:43:57,631 --> 01:44:00,532
lsn't Texador concerned
about his own complicity...

1493
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:02,295
...in drug dealing?

1494
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:05,360
He's concerned about
getting Brennan off his back.

1495
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:08,506
Our conversation was one-on-one,
he can always deny it.

1496
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:10,805
Do you believe him, Al, about wanting out?

1497
01:44:10,877 --> 01:44:12,174
- Yeah.
- Why?

1498
01:44:12,379 --> 01:44:13,539
He's in love.

1499
01:44:14,214 --> 01:44:15,579
Has been for some time.

1500
01:44:16,316 --> 01:44:19,046
That's a lot of love,
to give up the money he's making.

1501
01:44:19,853 --> 01:44:20,842
l believe him.

1502
01:44:23,056 --> 01:44:26,321
Right now he thinks
you're going to carry his message to Quinn.

1503
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,687
Does he have any reason to believe that?

1504
01:44:30,997 --> 01:44:34,023
- What do you mean, sir?
- Are you vulnerable to him in any way?

1505
01:44:37,137 --> 01:44:38,126
ln no way, sir.

1506
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:42,374
We must work quickly
and in complete secrecy.

1507
01:44:42,442 --> 01:44:44,637
You will function as usual, Reilly.

1508
01:44:45,078 --> 01:44:48,707
We will conduct the investigation
into the Brennan-Quinn relationship.

1509
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:51,647
Bloomenfeld, any suggestions?

1510
01:44:53,019 --> 01:44:55,647
All the cases they've made,
there must be one...

1511
01:44:55,722 --> 01:44:57,917
...that allowed Quinn to set this up.

1512
01:44:57,991 --> 01:45:00,016
Brennan's been on the edge so often.

1513
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:04,323
lf it isn't airtight,
maybe we can get enough to squeeze Quinn.

1514
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:08,065
What do l do about Texador?
l'm supposed to call him back.

1515
01:45:08,134 --> 01:45:10,159
Sit tight, he said you've got a week.

1516
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:13,729
l want to tell you, Reilly,
you've done a marvelous job.

1517
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,398
This is not an easy one.

1518
01:45:16,576 --> 01:45:17,702
Thank you, sir.

1519
01:45:30,156 --> 01:45:31,145
No!

1520
01:45:34,394 --> 01:45:35,383
No!

1521
01:46:17,203 --> 01:46:19,364
You're not going to yell, are you, Roger?

1522
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:21,765
lt's no use anyway.

1523
01:46:22,609 --> 01:46:24,474
The captain left a sinking ship.

1524
01:46:25,378 --> 01:46:29,610
l think he was disgusted with
all the corn-holing going on down here.

1525
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:34,551
Now, l'm going to take my hand away.
And you're going to be quiet.

1526
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:35,710
Right, Roger?

1527
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:44,163
You know how long
l've been looking for you, you spic fink?

1528
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:45,663
Mike, l was so scared.

1529
01:46:47,167 --> 01:46:48,156
You shut up.

1530
01:46:48,969 --> 01:46:51,164
l'll tell you when you're allowed to talk.

1531
01:46:51,805 --> 01:46:55,070
You just shake your head yes or no,
until l tell you to talk.

1532
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:56,898
Okay?

1533
01:46:58,778 --> 01:47:01,440
Now l want that fucking Texador.

1534
01:47:02,549 --> 01:47:05,040
Are you going to get him down here for me?

1535
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:07,742
Alone.

1536
01:47:09,622 --> 01:47:10,611
How?

1537
01:47:11,691 --> 01:47:13,488
lt's okay, talk.

1538
01:47:15,895 --> 01:47:18,227
l don't know Mike, but l'll do it.

1539
01:47:19,332 --> 01:47:20,321
l'll do it.

1540
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:48,484
How do l know you won't kill me
after l call him?

1541
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:49,823
You don't.

1542
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:52,664
But you know l'll kill you now if you don't.

1543
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:54,622
Let's go.

1544
01:47:58,738 --> 01:47:59,966
Where is everybody?

1545
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,108
People have to work, Roger.

1546
01:48:03,143 --> 01:48:05,634
Stop a minute.
You're making no sense here.

1547
01:48:05,712 --> 01:48:09,546
How many times do you want me to say it?
They said they were from lmmigration.

1548
01:48:09,749 --> 01:48:13,776
''Where's my papers,'' shit like that
and a lot of questions about you.

1549
01:48:13,853 --> 01:48:18,256
<i>I don't know who they were. They couId be
from 116th Street for aII I know.</i>

1550
01:48:18,391 --> 01:48:19,688
Where is Gilberto?

1551
01:48:19,759 --> 01:48:22,227
That prick? Not on this fucking float, baby.

1552
01:48:22,295 --> 01:48:24,388
<i>Where'd you get him, off the Titanic?</i>

1553
01:48:24,464 --> 01:48:26,261
That bastard walked off the boat.

1554
01:48:26,332 --> 01:48:29,301
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.
Listen to me!

1555
01:48:29,469 --> 01:48:32,927
lf you're not down here in an hour,
you're never going to see me again.

1556
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:34,506
l'm going crazy.

1557
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:36,542
l'm coming. l'm on my way now.

1558
01:48:36,609 --> 01:48:37,940
And one other thing:

1559
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:41,071
l don't want to see those
two Cubans with you, either.

1560
01:48:41,147 --> 01:48:44,708
They hate me. l'll see them coming!
l see them coming, baby...

1561
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:46,979
...l'm throwing myself in the fucking ocean!

1562
01:48:47,053 --> 01:48:49,419
- Bobby, what's happening?
- l don't know.

1563
01:48:49,556 --> 01:48:51,615
Could be nothing, could be something.

1564
01:49:15,415 --> 01:49:20,148
Come on Roger. Come on, cut that shit out.

1565
01:49:22,522 --> 01:49:24,319
Come on, cut it out, Roger.

1566
01:49:26,459 --> 01:49:27,687
Roger.

1567
01:49:30,029 --> 01:49:32,190
Roger, you did very good out there.

1568
01:49:33,133 --> 01:49:35,033
You did.

1569
01:49:35,468 --> 01:49:39,131
Listen, l've always returned favors,
haven't l, Roger?

1570
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,265
Come on, Roger, now cut it out.

1571
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:47,002
God!

1572
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:51,508
Can l have a blow, Mike?

1573
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:56,853
Sure, Roger. Help yourself.

1574
01:50:11,571 --> 01:50:13,732
Roger, can l have one too?

1575
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:17,009
No, no, not that kind.

1576
01:50:30,456 --> 01:50:32,822
That's more like it. Turn around.

1577
01:50:38,831 --> 01:50:42,392
Here, let's take this robe off.

1578
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:45,467
There you go now.

1579
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:14,960
Looking at this morning's report.
8:30 this morning, they found him.

1580
01:51:15,034 --> 01:51:19,494
Jose Malpica, Roger's girlfriend.
Been dead over 36 hours.

1581
01:51:21,274 --> 01:51:23,265
- lt was Brennan.
- How do you-

1582
01:51:23,343 --> 01:51:27,404
l tailed him. He stayed five minutes.
Came out and took off. l stayed with him.

1583
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:30,313
What was l supposed to do,
knock on the door?

1584
01:51:30,383 --> 01:51:33,250
The fox is in the chicken coop, Al.
Check this out.

1585
01:51:36,055 --> 01:51:37,920
lt's okay to touch, Frank?

1586
01:51:39,626 --> 01:51:43,687
Yeah, what the fuck. Go ahead.
A thousand people have done it already.

1587
01:52:05,885 --> 01:52:08,445
Just put me through on the phone, Sarah.
Goddamn it!

1588
01:52:08,521 --> 01:52:11,547
l want to speak to
the Police Commissioner in San Juan.

1589
01:52:12,525 --> 01:52:15,892
Of course l don't have the number,
goddamn it. Come on!

1590
01:52:21,334 --> 01:52:24,929
<i>The Presidential Suite. Sì, eI Presidente.</i>

1591
01:52:26,072 --> 01:52:29,439
Nancy, this is Al. Get out!
Get out right now!

1592
01:52:29,509 --> 01:52:30,806
<i>It's aII coming down.</i>

1593
01:52:30,877 --> 01:52:32,572
What's coming down? Where's Bobby?

1594
01:52:32,645 --> 01:52:34,340
Have you got anybody with you?

1595
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:36,780
Yes, Armand's here. But where's Bobby?

1596
01:53:44,717 --> 01:53:48,847
<i>Yes, Commissioner.
Get your men to the Marina, immediateIy!</i>

1597
01:53:48,921 --> 01:53:50,149
<i>The Nancy!</i>

1598
01:54:08,742 --> 01:54:12,143
''The wreckage reveals two,
possibly three, bodies on board.

1599
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:13,406
''One boot found...

01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:16,574

''...forwarded to the FBl, Washington.

1604
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:28,627
We should cover the airport.
Every San Juan flight.

1605
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:29,389
Why?

1606
01:54:29,462 --> 01:54:32,761
lf Brennan did this, he'll be back.
Looking for you, us.

1607
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:34,299
l'm not bringing him in.

1608
01:54:34,367 --> 01:54:38,303
Pray you get the chance.
My guess is, we'll have to kill him.

1609
01:54:38,371 --> 01:54:40,566
You're a cop. Your job is to talk first.

1610
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:43,108
My job is to get home to my wife and kids.

1611
01:54:43,176 --> 01:54:47,442
Put two men
on everything arriving from San Juan.

1612
01:54:47,514 --> 01:54:49,641
Go through Port Authority Police.

1613
01:54:49,716 --> 01:54:51,684
Valentin, he must be brought in alive.

1614
01:54:51,751 --> 01:54:54,413
l'm not bringing him in.

1615
01:54:56,589 --> 01:55:00,787
Al, when l last spoke to San Juan,
they said they thought she was all right.

1616
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,952
Thought?

1617
01:55:02,028 --> 01:55:05,020
When they got to the hotel,
she had already checked out.

1618
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:08,090
The clerk said she left with
one of those two Cuban Hebes.

1619
01:55:08,168 --> 01:55:12,036
When we were talking, you
and Bobby Tex were out on the terrace...

1620
01:55:12,505 --> 01:55:15,633
...Alfonso, Gaston,
one of those two guys...

1621
01:55:15,842 --> 01:55:18,402
...mentioned this island
they take their mother to.

1622
01:55:18,478 --> 01:55:20,708
No airport, no hotel.

1623
01:55:23,817 --> 01:55:27,548
Guyola. Maybe she went there, man.

1624
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:30,486
Thank you, Val.

1625
01:55:32,292 --> 01:55:36,092
<i>TWA FIight 210

<i>...is now boarding at Gate 16.</i>

1627
01:55:48,374 --> 01:55:51,741
<i>- NYPD.
- l'm sorry, sir, but you see...</i>

1628
01:56:07,527 --> 01:56:09,495
- We're onto something.
- What?

1629
01:56:09,562 --> 01:56:11,962
When he was a cop early on...

1630
01:56:12,031 --> 01:56:16,661
...Brennan was brought up on charges
for shooting a 16-year-old black kid.

1631
01:56:16,736 --> 01:56:19,261
The witnesses said it was a clean take-out.

1632
01:56:19,405 --> 01:56:22,374
But the only Q&A we can find
is Brennan's.

1633
01:56:22,642 --> 01:56:26,339
All the other depositions,
they're not in the files.

1634
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:28,972
lt was Quinn's first case as Homicide Chief.

1635
01:56:29,048 --> 01:56:31,949
Quinn destroyed them.
That's how he got his hooks in Brennan.

1636
01:56:32,018 --> 01:56:33,144
Not necessarily.

1637
01:56:33,219 --> 01:56:36,313
To keep his hooks in him,
they have to exist somewhere.

1638
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:41,149
- Hi, Mike.
- Hi, Jerry.

1639
01:56:41,227 --> 01:56:42,489
How you doing?

1640
01:56:45,698 --> 01:56:47,359
Any word from Valentin?

1641
01:56:47,433 --> 01:56:51,927
Nothing at Kennedy. They're heading back.
This just came in from San Juan.

1642
01:57:10,957 --> 01:57:13,983
You're not the man your father was, Reilly.

1643
01:57:15,428 --> 01:57:18,727
You're siding with
the shooflies and the rats.

1644
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:21,128
You don't love cops, Reilly.

1645
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:23,169
l loved my father, Mike.

1646
01:57:23,236 --> 01:57:26,637
Oh, Reilly.
You just loved the idea of your father.

1647
01:57:26,739 --> 01:57:29,765
Now, your father was dirty.
He was as dirty as they come.

1648
01:57:29,843 --> 01:57:33,540
Nothing big, just penny-ante stuff.
You know, free meals. A place to coop.

1649
01:57:33,613 --> 01:57:36,673
For a while, he was a bagman
for a pad in the South Bronx.

1650
01:57:36,749 --> 01:57:40,446
The normal stuff. He took home
$100, $150 a week. That's all.

1651
01:57:40,553 --> 01:57:42,953
But hell, what a cop.

1652
01:57:43,022 --> 01:57:47,015
Like me, he was the first
through the door, the window, the skylight.

1653
01:57:47,093 --> 01:57:49,584
l mean, he knew
there were animals out there!

1654
01:57:49,662 --> 01:57:53,598
He knew there was a line the niggers,
the spics, the junkies, the faggots...

1655
01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:58,296
...had to cross to get into people's throats.
He was that line. l am that line.

1656
01:57:59,305 --> 01:58:03,935
And the fucking judges and Jew lawyers,
Aldermen and guinea DAs are raking it in.

1657
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:08,241
We take a fucking hamburger
and it's goodbye badge, gun and pension.

1658
01:58:08,314 --> 01:58:13,308
All the time, it's our life that's on the line.
lt's our widows and our orphans!

1659
01:58:13,386 --> 01:58:18,187
Now you're a rogue cop, you mick bastard.
You went from our side to their side.

1660
01:58:18,258 --> 01:58:19,520
Hey, Mike!

1661
01:58:24,264 --> 01:58:26,494
l don't want to take you in, Mike.

1662
01:58:29,235 --> 01:58:30,896
You won't, Chappie.

1663
01:58:31,004 --> 01:58:35,031
Not by myself, Mike. l wouldn't know how.
l knew that in the corps.

1664
01:58:35,341 --> 01:58:39,277
But don't make me try, Mike.
Now you can't get out.

1665
01:58:39,946 --> 01:58:42,676
You'll beat me but you'll go down, Mike.

1666
01:58:43,316 --> 01:58:46,547
So, come on, give me the gun.

1667
01:58:47,053 --> 01:58:50,614
Come on, Mike, turn yourself in.
l'm your friend.

1668
01:58:53,326 --> 01:58:56,818
l always said you was
the whitest nigger l ever knew, Chappie.

1669
01:59:08,308 --> 01:59:09,297
Freeze!

1670
01:59:11,144 --> 01:59:13,112
Fuck you, honey dripper!

1671
01:59:14,047 --> 01:59:15,207
Down! Down!

1672
01:59:23,656 --> 01:59:25,283
Shit, Chappie.

1673
01:59:26,426 --> 01:59:27,484
Al?

1674
01:59:29,762 --> 01:59:32,925
Max. We got a real mess here, man.

1675
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,663
10-13. At least three down.

1676
01:59:37,737 --> 01:59:40,205
Maybe some civilians.

1677
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:42,774
Send everything.

1678
01:59:46,779 --> 01:59:50,044
Jesus Christ. Taken out by a virgin Hebe.

1679
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:05,219
Yeah?

1680
02:00:05,531 --> 02:00:09,160
<i>Is this Assistant District Attorney
AIoysius Francis ReiIIy?</i>

1681
02:00:09,235 --> 02:00:09,997
Yeah.

1682
02:00:10,069 --> 02:00:12,936
This is Kevin Quinn,
Chief of the Homicide Bureau.

1683
02:00:13,006 --> 02:00:15,907
Office of the District Attorney,
county of New York.

1684
02:00:16,676 --> 02:00:18,371
What do you want, Quinn?

1685
02:00:18,478 --> 02:00:23,245
A squad car is on the way to pick you up.
l want you in my office within the hour.

1686
02:00:23,383 --> 02:00:25,476
You still work for me. Be there.

1687
02:00:58,818 --> 02:01:01,082
Why didn't you listen to me, Francis?

1688
02:01:05,258 --> 02:01:07,021
lt wasn't cut-and-dried.

1689
02:01:07,493 --> 02:01:11,224
lt was whatever you chose to make it.
Look at what you've done.

1690
02:01:11,431 --> 02:01:16,368
Detective Chapman's fighting for his life.
Zucker's doing Q&A for shooting Brennan.

1691
02:01:16,536 --> 02:01:18,834
A legend on this force is dead.

1692
02:01:19,338 --> 02:01:21,602
lt's already on the 6:00 news.

1693
02:01:21,974 --> 02:01:25,466
''Cop turns killer,''
''Rogue cop,'' ''Nervous breakdown.''

1694
02:01:25,745 --> 02:01:28,441
A desecration of what used to be the finest.

1695
02:01:29,248 --> 02:01:32,809
They must be celebrating tonight
all over Harlem, South Bronx...

1696
02:01:33,019 --> 02:01:35,180
<i>- ...Bed-Stuy-
- Mr. Quinn...</i>

1697
02:01:35,254 --> 02:01:37,620
l'm in pain. l'm full of sedatives.

1698
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:39,317
l understand.

1699
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:42,186
Just wanted to tell you l'm resigning.

1700
02:01:42,261 --> 02:01:44,821
We're announcing my candidacy next week.

1701
02:01:44,964 --> 02:01:47,455
l'm trying to decide
whether to keep you on-board.

1702
02:01:47,533 --> 02:01:49,660
lt's a question of loyalty, you see.

1703
02:01:49,735 --> 02:01:53,193
l don't feel a deeply committed
loyalty from you, Francis.

1704
02:01:53,339 --> 02:01:56,331
Of course, in a political campaign
that's unacceptable.

1705
02:01:56,409 --> 02:01:59,037
Unless you can show me l'm wrong...

1706
02:01:59,112 --> 02:02:01,205
...that you share my values and concerns.

1707
02:02:02,348 --> 02:02:03,713
Mr. Quinn.

1708
02:02:08,187 --> 02:02:11,054
l don't think l should join your campaign,
you know.

1709
02:02:12,058 --> 02:02:16,825
l think you should reconsider
whether you announce next week.

1710
02:02:18,231 --> 02:02:22,497
Brennan's death is going to require
pretty intensive investigation.

1711
02:02:23,369 --> 02:02:24,836
Thank you, Francis.

1712
02:02:24,904 --> 02:02:28,032
''Que sera, sera

1713
02:02:28,107 --> 02:02:31,599
''Whatever will be, will be''

1714
02:02:35,882 --> 02:02:38,442
ls he crazy?
He's got to know something's up.

1715
02:02:38,751 --> 02:02:41,379
That we must be at least investigating him.

1716
02:02:42,155 --> 02:02:43,918
No, he's not crazy.

1717
02:02:44,957 --> 02:02:47,926
Brennan's the only link to him
and all the others.

1718
02:02:49,028 --> 02:02:50,017
Brennan's dead.

1719
02:02:50,129 --> 02:02:52,927
This whole thing
won't just disappear, though.

1720
02:02:53,032 --> 02:02:55,660
- Yes, it will, Al.
- Will what?

1721
02:02:57,136 --> 02:02:58,228
Disappear.

1722
02:02:59,372 --> 02:03:00,498
How can it?

1723
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:05,366
- We'll bury it.
- What?

1724
02:03:06,546 --> 02:03:09,310
lt's too big. We'll bury it.

1725
02:03:10,883 --> 02:03:11,975
You can't.

1726
02:03:13,819 --> 02:03:15,810
- Yes, we can.
- How?

1727
02:03:16,122 --> 02:03:17,419
We just do it.

1728
02:03:20,726 --> 02:03:22,626
lt's impossible.

1729
02:03:22,862 --> 02:03:24,420
<i>Chappie...</i>

1730
02:03:24,497 --> 02:03:28,661
The black in blue fighting for his life.
Okay, say he lives.

1731
02:03:28,935 --> 02:03:32,564
All he knows is that
Brennan took out two PR drug dealers.

1732
02:03:33,573 --> 02:03:36,599
You know what they say
about black cops in the ghetto?

1733
02:03:36,742 --> 02:03:38,767
''Blue first, black second.''

1734
02:03:40,146 --> 02:03:41,738
He loved Brennan...

1735
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:46,142
...he'd rather he be remembered
as a nut case than as a murderer.

1736
02:03:48,621 --> 02:03:51,886
- Valentin?
- He knows no more than Chappie.

1737
02:03:52,825 --> 02:03:56,556
A cop having a nervous breakdown
might have shot two drug dealers.

1738
02:03:56,896 --> 02:03:58,261
They might have.

1739
02:03:58,497 --> 02:03:59,555
Anyway...

1740
02:03:59,832 --> 02:04:04,269
...the orders promoting him to Detective,
First Grade, have already been cut.

1741
02:04:05,037 --> 02:04:09,770
On that salary,
a home in the suburbs is more than possible.

1742
02:04:10,710 --> 02:04:14,669
He can open up a neighborhood.
He's light-skinned, he loves his kids.

1743
02:04:14,814 --> 02:04:18,750
All those bodies.
Tony, Sierra, Jose, Bobby Tex.

1744
02:04:18,818 --> 02:04:21,480
A bunch of fags and spics
up to their ass in dope.

1745
02:04:21,554 --> 02:04:23,078
Who'll give a shit?

1746
02:04:24,924 --> 02:04:27,620
lt's just a normal Saturday night in the city.

1747
02:04:28,194 --> 02:04:30,424
Most people will feel good riddance.

1748
02:04:32,665 --> 02:04:36,066
And all the original Q&A,
all the paperwork, the investigation-

1749
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:39,593
Someday, l'll show you the records division.
You should see it.

1750
02:04:40,673 --> 02:04:44,632
They've got folders dating back to 1791.

1751
02:04:45,011 --> 02:04:49,414
But you'd have a hard time finding
Washington's farewell to his troops.

1752
02:04:50,116 --> 02:04:54,815
Anyway, paper burns at Fahrenheit 451.

1753
02:04:58,591 --> 02:05:01,617
This is a nightmare, Bloomy.

1754
02:05:02,395 --> 02:05:03,657
Yeah. l know.

1755
02:05:09,035 --> 02:05:12,903
- What about me?
- What about you?

1756
02:05:16,309 --> 02:05:17,936
l can yell, l can scream.

1757
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:22,913
<i>Yeah, you can. The ViIIage Voice.
The New York Times. The DaiIy News.</i>

1758
02:05:22,982 --> 02:05:27,578
<i>Call Jimmy Breslin.
Call Pileggi at New York Magazine.</i>

1759
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:31,121
They're all friends of mine.
l'll give you their home numbers.

1760
02:05:31,657 --> 02:05:32,624
<i>But...</i>

1761
02:05:36,228 --> 02:05:37,217
<i>But...</i>

1762
02:05:39,565 --> 02:05:41,055
Moon Mullins.

1763
02:05:42,301 --> 02:05:45,759
That's right. He's ours.

1764
02:05:46,505 --> 02:05:48,473
And you never reported him.

1765
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:51,039
Yeah, but that's easy.

1766
02:05:51,911 --> 02:05:53,538
What, there's something else?

1767
02:05:53,612 --> 02:05:56,775
You could cop a plea, maybe, with Mullins.

1768
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:59,547
<i>But there's your father...</i>

1769
02:06:01,821 --> 02:06:04,585
Posthumously decorated for heroic action.

1770
02:06:04,857 --> 02:06:08,657
Posthumously promoted
to Detective, Second Grade.

1771
02:06:08,794 --> 02:06:11,820
Both of those promotions
are in your mother's pension.

1772
02:06:16,035 --> 02:06:17,024
Bloomy.

1773
02:06:19,705 --> 02:06:22,230
- Bloomy.
- No, let it be, Al.

1774
02:06:22,675 --> 02:06:24,267
You can't afford this.

1775
02:06:25,044 --> 02:06:28,104
l can't, and God knows the department can't.

1776
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:31,645
We've got an election this year.

1777
02:06:33,519 --> 02:06:37,114
So Quinn gets away with it?
ls that why he was singing?

1778
02:06:37,223 --> 02:06:40,886
Let him run.
Nobody will vote for him, anyway.

1779
02:06:41,627 --> 02:06:45,563
He's a prick. People sense these things.

1780
02:06:47,466 --> 02:06:48,592
Hey, Bloomy.

1781
02:06:52,204 --> 02:06:54,832
Can you really bury something this big?

1782
02:06:57,977 --> 02:06:58,966
Bigger.

1783
02:07:05,050 --> 02:07:07,382
You're breaking my heart, Bloomy.

1784
02:07:10,055 --> 02:07:13,286
You know, it's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

1785
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,478
Call me.

1786
02:07:57,169 --> 02:08:01,071
<i>Bobby said there was a reason
they put me on this case.</i>

1787
02:08:01,974 --> 02:08:06,536
<i>He was right. What were they counting on?</i>

1788
02:08:08,914 --> 02:08:10,677
<i>My dumbness?</i>

1789
02:08:12,785 --> 02:08:14,685
<i>They were on the money.</i>

1790
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:20,716
<i>Maybe they were counting on my IoyaIty.
LoyaIty to what?</i>

1791
02:08:21,594 --> 02:08:25,325
<i>What made them think I was one of them?</i>

1792
02:08:29,301 --> 02:08:30,893
That day on the corner.

1793
02:08:30,970 --> 02:08:34,736
When your husband came round the corner.
Did he say anything to you about me?

1794
02:08:34,807 --> 02:08:37,332
Oh, yes. He saw.

1795
02:08:37,443 --> 02:08:40,037
He saw it on my face, too.

1796
02:08:40,779 --> 02:08:41,768
Yes.

1797
02:08:56,295 --> 02:08:59,321
<i>Maybe they were
figuring on the Iack of guts.</i>

1798
02:09:01,066 --> 02:09:02,431
<i>Were they right?</i>

1799
02:09:03,102 --> 02:09:04,330
<i>I don't know.</i>

1800
02:09:05,104 --> 02:09:06,537
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1801
02:09:12,077 --> 02:09:15,240
<i>I know I have to fight back, and I wiII.</i>

1802
02:09:16,715 --> 02:09:18,979
<i>I just don't know how to start.</i>

1803
02:09:20,452 --> 02:09:23,512
<i>Maybe I've got to start with myseIf.</i>

1804
02:09:24,089 --> 02:09:29,026
<i>Ask myseIf what caused
that Iook on my face when I met your father.</i>

1805
02:09:31,096 --> 02:09:33,428
