00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:36,767
NARRATOR: It was
nearly 100 years ago.

2
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:39,667
I was but a lone
trapper then and would

3
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:43,000
Spend my winters on
Manitou Island, where

4
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,833
Small game were plentiful.

5
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:49,033
I'd heard the legend
of the Wendigo,

6
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:55,500
But a man's ignorance of things
unseen is never questioned.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,867
Legend became life when
I came face to face

8
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:03,133
With the monstrous snow beast.

9
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,233
It was a fierce battle
that rocked the world.

10
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:10,300
But through some grace
of God, I was victorious,

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,700
And my life would never
again be the same.

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,633
The moment I
defeated the beast, I

13
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,667
Realized I must
protect the world

14
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:22,633
From this evil
monstrosity's resurrection.

15
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:27,100
Knowing the legend, I marked
this spot, this sacred ground

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,900
With the skulls of all
the previous victims

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
Of the Wendigo, creating
a spiritual shield

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,767
To protect the world.

19
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:39,033
However, if the circle
was ever broken,

20
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:44,967
The Wendigo would be reborn once
again, more powerful than ever.

21
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:51,133
And now it is here, in this
circle, that I've remained.

22
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:58,133
For, be it a blessing, be it
a curse, I am the chosen one.

23
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:00,067
I am the Guardian.

24
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:04,000
[Gun shot]

25
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:07,267
I'll drink to that.

26
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:10,400
Here's to the three-breasted
women of good old Tibitan.

27
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,967
And now, my good
old friend, let's

28
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,367
Make a toast to ourselves.

29
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:19,767
Another round, please.

30
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,733
Thank you.

31
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,633
This one's mine.

32
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,300
To my good friend, Larry.

33
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,633
Who's dad's name was Barry.

34
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,133
It's so damn scary.

35
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:32,200
His mom was so hairy.

36
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,500
But I got to thank him
for bringing me out early.

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,900
Shooting them signs.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,067
Little squirrelies and I figure
if we keep drinkin', we're

39
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,800
Going to end up...

40
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,800
Drunk!

41
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,267
[Laughing]

42
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,133
I'm itchin' to blast something.

43
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,600
I was hopin' I'd
run out of booze.

44
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,600
What?

45
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,067
Keep out?

46
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,567
Private?

47
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,233
There isn't any private
property on this island

48
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,233
While we're here.

49
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,700
Ready?

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,700
Aim.

51
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,667
Fire.

52
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:14,133
[Gun shot]

53
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,100
Woo, oo, oo.

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,067
Oh, look, a fence.

55
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:23,500
I guess we're gonna
have to turn back.

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,467
Private property?

57
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,933
[Laughing]

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,000
There's your private property.

59
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,300
Let's see if anyone's home.

60
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,067
What?

61
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,367
Something illegal's
going on here.

62
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,667
Holy cow!

63
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,100
It's murder, mass murder.

64
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,533
Look at all them skulls.

65
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,767
Where you going?

66
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,300
I'm going inside.

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,900
Man, let's just get
the hell outta here.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,367
[Door creaks]

69
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,367
You leave my land.

70
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:24,067
I'm not about to let some old
bum tell me where I can't hunt.

71
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:29,033
Respect is an attribute, my
friend, one you should learn.

72
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,367
Respect?

73
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:31,967
I think you need
to learn to respect

74
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,067
The man with the high
powered weapon in his hand.

75
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,733
Hey, man, let's
just leave him alone.

76
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,233
Leave me alone.

77
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,467
I shall ask you once
again to leave my land.

78
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,967
You've never seen one of these
babies in action, old man.

79
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,633
You think you might
want a demonstration?

80
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:52,067
You have no idea what
you may be the cause of.

81
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:55,200
Let's just get out of here, OK?

82
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,033
[Gun shot]

83
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,333
Shut up, or I'll
blow your head off.

84
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,700
Please go.

85
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,867
[Gun shot]

86
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:04,667
No!

87
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:22,067
The circle has been broken.

88
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:30,000
The wind it whispers.

89
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,000
Tell me.

90
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:37,933
The wind whispers.

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,300
Wendigo.

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,100
Wendigo.

93
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,933
Now what are we going to do?

94
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:57,633
Gotta get rid of him.

95
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:58,633
[Hoarsely gasping]

96
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,633
What do you mean?

97
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,233
[Crash]
Ah!

98
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,100
What the hell?

99
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,600
[Crashing and shattering glass]

100
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,600
Ah!

101
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,100
What's going on?

102
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,100
What the...

103
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:21,067
[Smash]

104
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:24,067

107
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:47,967
Whoa!

108

110
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:28,367

[Screaming]

112
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:47,133
The circle has been broken.

113
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:51,600
You are the chosen one.

114
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,733
You must complete the circle.

115
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,367
[Laughter]

116
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:21,867
I'm out.

117
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:22,667
You're out.

118
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,300
Pay up, you saps.

119
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,933
What do you mean, you're out?

120
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:30,700
Pete, talk to our man here
about your low interest loans.

121
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,233
What's the matter, pard?

122
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,233
You got a bad set of cards?

123
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,367
Are you outta cash?

124
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:41,600
Well, I-

125
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,433
Pete's Pawns can do you a deal.

126
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:45,667
Yeah, ride 'em, Hoss.

127
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,033
You got something to trade?

128
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,867
You got something to sell?

129
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:52,233
Or do you just need a loan?

130
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, come on down
to Pete's Pawns.

131
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,267
Our interest rates are
famously low city-wide.

132
00:10:57,367 --> 00:11:00,267
And we ain't just city wide.

133
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:05,467
Hell, county wide,
and we ain't never,

134
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,633
Never turned down a deal.

135
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,367
Now how much you need?

136
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,033
Uh, five bucks.

137
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:15,067
Five bucks.

138
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:15,867
Five.

139
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,667
Very good, son.

140
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,467
Always glad to do business
with a fine, upstanding

141
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,433

143
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,767
What did I do?

144
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,667
I didn't mean it.

145
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:43,467
I swear to God I didn't mean it.

146
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,533
I'll tell them it
was an accident.

147
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,833
That's it.

148
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,333
No, wait a minute.

149
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:53,667
I'll tell them Dave
shot the old dude.

150
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:54,867
No, no.

151
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:58,067
Dave's in enough
trouble already.

152

First things first.

Got to round everybody up
and get off the island.

That's it.

158
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,300
Get off the island.

let a dead man die.

Oh, holy smoke.

What a flight.

166
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,200
What a flight.

167
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,767
I felt like I was in a bag
and they put me in a bag...

You know, if you've ever
been to Albany, New York.

172
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:54,000
If you've ever flown in there...

Hey, where's this new guy?

like the cold, right?

00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,067
I know where I'm not wanted.

188
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,933
Oh, come on.
[interposing voices]

189
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:41,733
No, I ain't staying.

190
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,067
Come on.

191
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,133
And

192
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:46,133
Come on Leo, they
didn't mean anything.

193
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:46,933
Come on.

194
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:47,733
Leo.

195
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,633
We didn't mean anything.

196
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,933
No offense.

197
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,467
We didn't even know Tony
was bringing anybody, right?

198
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:56,267
No.

199
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,633
No.

200
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:01,733
See, this has kind of been like
our own secret little circle

201
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,667
For the last five years.

202
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:07,100
No offense meant.

203
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,500
My name's Pete.

204
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,967
Leo Phillips.

205
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,900
You can call me Leo.

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,100
Jerry.

207
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,900
Lee.

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:38,933
It

209
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:40,067
TELVISION ANNOUNCER:
This is Brick

210
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,400
Branding in downtown Tecumseh.

211
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
And at the top of our news,
there's a winter storm,

212
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,633
Which has still not let up.

213
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,067
All throughout the state, the
rampages of the storm are being

214
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:51,067
Felt. Over 100 schools have
been forced to close down

215
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:54,333
But the hardest hit is
the Upper Peninsula.

216
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,800
Not like the ones in '66.

217
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,467
Well.

218
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:06,867
What have we got here?

219
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:11,100
I need to get to the island.

220
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,667
First in the morning.

221
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:13,633
No.

222
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:16,433
I need to get to
the island tonight.

223
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,300
Lady, if we go out in
that storm tonight...

224
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,033
Is there anyone
else who can take me?

225
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,600
Lady, I'm the only pilot here.

226
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,767
If it's that important, you
can walk across the ice.

227
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:30,333
OK.

228
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:39,400
Well, I've done more stupid
things for a lot less money.

229
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,900
Let's go.

230
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,367
Finally Tony gets to my
house, about two hours late.

231
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:45,933
Now, this is when
the fight starts.

232
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,667
I'm driving out
of my neighborhood

233
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,667
When this black cat
darts across the street,

234
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:50,900
I mean right in front of us.

235
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,033
No way on God's green earth
could we have missed it.

236
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,300
Boom.

237
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,833
I mean, you could hear it
hit the bottom of the car.

238
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:57,433
And by now, I'm
wondering if I was

239
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:58,733
Ever meant to go on this trip.

240
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,367
So Tony pulls the car
over and we get out.

241
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,967
Oh, come on, man, they do not
want to hear the rest of this.

242
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,400
No, we want to hear.

243
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,833
Anyway, but anyway,
we're out of the car

244
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,333
And we're looking for this cat
everywhere, and can't find it.

245
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,867
All of a sudden, I hear
this, boom, boom, boom.

246
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,000
And I look around and there's
Tony kicking at the tire.

247
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,400
I said, what the hell
are you doing, man?

248
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,233
He said, I found it.

249
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,467
I caught it in the wheel well.

250
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,767
So by the time I get around
there, he's got it out.

251
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:23,500
And this cat's laying
there, all mangled and dead.

252
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,533
Is this a joke?

253
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:25,933
No, it's no joke.

254
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,533
I mean, look we got
out, and I didn't

255
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,367
Even want to touch the things.

256
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:32,900
Old Daniel Boone here, he has
to put it in the first year.

257
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,733
That's where we
should have left it.

258
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,500
But Mr. Humanitarian here, he
can't leave well enough alone.

259
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,400
Well, you can't just
leave somebody's dead cat,

260
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,800
I mean, mangled, lying
on their front lawn.

261
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,733
I mean, that's disgusting.

262
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,867
No, no, Your dinner
was disgusting.

263
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,200
So I picked up
this cat and we're

264
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Going to take it to the house.

265
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,200
The weird thing was when
we get to the porch,

266
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,500
The front door flies
open and this half

267
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,500
Naked woman comes running out.

268
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,667
I mean, she's screaming,
she was barefoot

269
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,667
And bawling her eyes out.

270
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,900
Yeah I mean, this was
sad, it was really sad.

271
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,767
I mean, she grabs this
bloody pile out of my hands

272
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,100
And she starts hugging.

273
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,167
And I'm going, oh, great, what
are we supposed to do now?

274
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:08,600
I mean, this cat's
more important to her

275
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,300
Than her husband.

276
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
You know, but I said, look,
I explained to her, lady,

277
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,200
We didn't mean any harm
by running over your cat.

278
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,500
And besides, I thought I'd offer
her a couple of bucks for it.

279
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,733
I didn't even think
she'd take it.

280
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,233
But she says OK.

281
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,067
So what do you
think a cat's worth?

282
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,533
$5, $10?

283
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,533
She told us it's worth $2,000.

284
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:29,500
- Right.
- What?

285
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
That's what I said.
No way.

286
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,767
I don't have $2,000.

287
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:32,667
For a cat?

288
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,433
So listen, I offer her $100.

289
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,567
Yeah, then I offer her
$100 on top of that.

290
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:38,367
$200.

291
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,700
$200 for a cat?

292
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,500
You're kidding me.

293
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Oh, but that's not all.

294
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,100
Finally, we get out of there.

295
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,867
And we're driving
away and we're driving

296
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:47,133
And this cop car
comes barrelling

297
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,633
Down the street, light
flashing, the siren's wailing.

298
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,267
And they pull into her driveway.

299
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:53,200
And I say, turn around,
let's go see what's going on.

300
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,900
So we turn around
and when get back,

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The cops are with this lady,
handcuffing her and putting her

302
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,367
In their car.

303
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,367
So I get out of the car and
the cops walk right over to me

304
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:02,967
And he goes, this yours?

305
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,333
And he hands me the $200.

306
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:05,733
I go, yes, officer.

307
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,667
I go, what's going on?

308
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:07,600
What did she do?

309
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,133
And he looks me
right in the face.

310
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:10,867
I mean dead in the face,
like I did something wrong.

311
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:14,433
And he goes, listen, son,
everyone in this state

312
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:17,333
Knows it's illegal
to sell pussy.

313
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,233
[Laughing]

314
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,033
On you.

315
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:25,433
That's real funny.

316
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:26,400
That's really bad.

317
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,067
[Laughing]

318
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,700
Does rough flying bother you?

319
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,133
I'm OK.

320
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,100
Well, I'd say this is
the worst series of storms

321
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,533
We've had in the last
decade, but nothing

322
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:46,967
Like the ones in '66.

323
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:48,933
Do you know the
island very well?

324
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,900
Lady, I grew up here.

325
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,333
I know everything
about this place.

326
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,467
Is there anything strange,
like maybe some strange landmark

327
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,867
In a weird shape or anything?

328
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,000
The only time anyone ever pays
any attention to this island

329
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,600
Is during deer season, which
happens to start tomorrow.

330
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,033
Few drunk hunters, fooling
and shooting themselves.

331
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:15,467
Ah, nothing ever happens
out of the ordinary here.

332
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,867
You can't think of anything
or even anyone strange?

333
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:25,467
There is an old guy.

334
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,667
He don't bother nobody.

335
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:30,400
And nobody don't bother him.

336
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,200
Sandy.

337
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:38,333
You are the new guardian.

338
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:41,567
And my powers have
been passed on to you.

339
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:45,767
As a guardian, it was
my death that caused

340
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,600
The release of the Wendigo.

341
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,400
And it is your strength
that will defeat it.

342
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,733
Beware the Wendigo's
sentinels, warriors

343
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,600
That will try to destroy you.

344
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,833
You must find the circle and
complete it before the sun

345
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,733
Rises on two days.

346
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,600
During this time, the
Wendigo's strength will grow.

347
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,667
And you will become weak.

348
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:17,367
If the circle is not completed,
you and many others will die.

349
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:22,833
What was that?

350
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,833
Jesus!

351
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:31,300
Something's jumping on the tail.

352
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,767
The first sentinel.

353
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:33,767
What?

354
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,767
What the hell is
jumping on my plane?

355
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:36,767
You've got to get down!

356
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:37,767
I can't even see.

357
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:41,733
How in the hell can I land?

358
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,700
It's on the plane.

359
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,700
It's tearing up the plane.

360
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,167
You've got to land.

361
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:54,167
I told you I can't see
two feet in front of me.

362
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:55,667
How in the hell can I land?

363
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,133
It's still out there.

364
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:03,633
You've got to get
this plane down.

365
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:06,100
[Screaming]

366
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,067
[Screaming]

367
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:40,433
[Snoring]

368
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:54,367
[Heavy breathing]

369
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:03,833
[Snoring]

370
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,267
Hey, get up!

371
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:13,267
That thing out there.

372
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:14,267
It's coming!

373
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,767
What the hell are
you doing, man?

374
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,233
That damn Wendigo.

375
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,233
It's out there!

376
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,167
Wait, wait.

377
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:22,433
The Hoodigo is what?

378
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,300
No, the Wendigo.

379
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,000
It's big, man, real big.

380
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,433
What the hell's
going on in here?

381
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:33,367
This guy just broke in and he's
messing up all your furniture.

382
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:35,367
You guys got to listen.

383
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,067
I know I sound like
an old '50s B movie,

384
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:39,200
But there's a gigantic
blue monster out there

385
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,267
That's called the Wendigo.

386
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,133
And it's already
killed my buddy.

387
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,467
Yeah, right.

388
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:45,267
I got the munchies.

389
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:46,433
Anybody else hungry?

390
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,733
I am.

391
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:52,533
Me too.

392
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:53,933
What do you got?

393
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:56,267
What did you call that thing?

394
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:57,700
The Wendigo.

395
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,167
Me and my buddy, Dave,
accidentally shot this old man

396
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:01,233
And everything went nuts.

397
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,567
The old guy melted
down into a skeleton.

398
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:04,533
Then it came alive.

399
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,967
It grabbed Dave,
smashed me in the face.

400
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:07,933
I got up.

401
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:08,900
I got hit.

402
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,300
The Wendigo grabbed
Dave and ripped

403
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,233
His head clean off
and put it on a pole

404
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,700
Next to all these skeletons.

405
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,667
The only reason I got
away, is that thing

406
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,633
Was still busy eating Dave.

407
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,067
It was eating him raw.

408
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:23,000
[Snoring]

409
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,367
When did all this happen?

410
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:26,600
Oh, come on, Pete.

411
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,067
The guy is nuts.

412
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,400
I want some of my
bodacious chili.

413
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,900
Well, we can't do
anything until morning.

414
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,267
But I don't understand all this
business about the Wendigo.

415
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah, it's an old
Algonquin Indian legend.

416
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:49,367
In the middle of winter, when
the winter storms have killed

417
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:53,633
All the game, and there
was no food anywhere,

418
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:56,167
You know, the Indians would
come in the middle of the night.

419
00:23:56,267 --> 00:24:00,867
And they'd get one of their
own people, and kill him.

420
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:01,933
Then they'd eat him.

421
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm hungry.

422
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,667
It's just their
word for cannibalism.

423
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,233
There's no such
thing as a Wendigo.

424
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:18,000
I mean, the Indians would say,
in the middle of the night,

425
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,700
The Wendigo ate Geronimo.

426
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,633
It was just another
excuse for their hunger.

427
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,067
Tell that to Dave.

428
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,900
How do you know all this?

429
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,833
As my great grandmother
used to say, lift your feet,

430
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,000
The shit's getting thick.

431
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,833
And the chili's good and ready.

432
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,700
No, you guys don't understand.

433
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,600
We've got to round up everyone
that's left on this island

434
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,767
And get out of here!

435
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,133
Hot chili.

436
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,533
Listen, man, why don't
you get off of this?

437
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:43,933
Do you need a place
to stay until you

438
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,300
Come off your drunk, well
fine, you can stay with us.

439
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,300
As far as that monster
stuff, nobody here

440
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,800
Believes it, especially me.

441
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,133
I wouldn't say that.

442
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:52,933
Why?

443
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,167
Is it gonna get me?

444
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,067
Ah!

445
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,567
[Screaming]

446
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:07,533
I told you it was real.

447
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,033
I told you!

448
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,533
[Screaming]

449
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,967
Look out.

450
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:24,967
Put him out!

451
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,433
Put him out!

452
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:28,933
[Screaming]

453
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,933
Help me!

454
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,900
Put him over there, on the cot.

455
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,900
Be careful with him.

456
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:42,467
Oh my god, what
are we going to do?

457
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:43,467
I don't know.

458
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:44,933
We don't have many choices.

459
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,567
The hell we don't!

460
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,767
We gotta get out of here!

461
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:48,700
How?

462
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,233
The only way on
or off this island

463
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,067
Is Duke's Charter Service.

464
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,500
And we have no way of getting
a hold of him until the morning

465
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,467
When he flies in.

466
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:59,733
I guess we're stuck
here until then.

467
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,200
[Screaming]

468
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,500
I'm going to get
rid of this stuff.

469
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,200
Not that it matters.

470
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,733
That thing is
everywhere anyways.

471
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,033
Hey, Leo, Leo.

472
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:48,833
Where you going?

473
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:49,633
Hey!

474
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,700
Come back here.

475
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,133
You can't go out there.

476
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:55,533
We can't let him go
out in those woods.

477
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:56,533
Let him go.

478
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:57,500
What?

479
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,433
I said, let him go.

480
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,767
Peter's right.

481
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:06,500
Leo is a hothead, but,
I mean, after all,

482
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
The guy did just lose a hand.

483
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,533
Storm out there
will cool him off.

484
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,333
He'll be in soon enough.

485
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:16,133
OK, but it's all your
shoulders this time now.

486
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm not going to take
the rap for this one too.

487
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,133
Listen, we don't have
time for Leo's crying.

488
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:28,900
If he wants to try and get
out of here tonight, let him.

489
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,800
Well, what's your plan?

490
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,167
Three of us will head
out in the morning

491
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,133
And meet Duke when he flies in.

492
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:35,700
The other two will stay here.

493
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,667
When you find Duke, get back
here, and we'll take Jerry out.

494
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:40,600
When I find Duke?

495
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,867
What do you mean
when I find Duke?

496
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,567
I'm not going to go out there.

497
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:45,567
Hey, don't worry.

498
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,267
I'll go along with you.

499
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,300
Oh, great.

500
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,567
That makes me feel real good.

501
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,967
Two stooges against King Kong.

502
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:55,800
I'm no stooge, pal,
I'll have you know.

503
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,600
I had an encounter
with a Big Foot once.

504
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,033
Come on.

505
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,133
No, really.

506
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:05,233
It was in a restroom
in the Smoky Mountains.

507
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:08,400
I think you're talking
about big ass, not foot.

508
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,733
Actually, his whole
body is quite large.

509
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,333
And the phrase
referring to his foot

510
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:16,033
Actually denotes a small
piece of his anatomy

511
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,367
Which selectively
refers to the...

512
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:20,167
Wait a minute,
Tony, I thought you

513
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:23,467
Didn't believe me in any of
that hokey pokey legend stuff.

514
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:24,700
Yeah, Tony.

515
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,933
I thought it was just an
old Algonquin Indian legend.

516
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:30,067
I was skeptical
myself, until I actually

517
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,267
Encountered the Big Foot.

518
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,467
Yeah.

519
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,967
I'll never forget the
relief of finally getting

520
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:40,400
To use a flush toilet and the
sheer terror of coming face

521
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,600
To face with the Sasquatch.

522
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,400
Oh, sure.

523
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,767
Big ass gotta poop too?

524
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,767
Hey, fellas, I don't think
Jerry's doing too well here.

525
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:51,133
He's breathing's real weird
like there isn't any sometimes.

526
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:53,633
[Scream from outside]

527
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:57,633
What was that?

528
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:05,633
[Door creaks open]

529
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:08,633
Be careful!

530
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:13,633
God.

531
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,600
Help me, Please.

532
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Are you OK?

533
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,600
What happened?

534
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,900
What did you see?

535
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,300
Was it big?

536
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,733
What the hell's going on?

537
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:49,067
What happened to
Jerry over here?

538
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,267
Hold it, hold it!

539
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:54,333
Are you all right?

540
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:58,567
We were sleeping my
boyfriend woke up.

541
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:02,100
He thought he heard
something rummaging outside.

He went out to check.

00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,767
It's all right.

00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:08,067
Don't worry about it.

545
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:12,100
Then there were the footsteps
in the snow coming closer

546
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,533
And closer then they stopped.

547
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,367
Why don't you go lay down
on the cot for a minute

548
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:18,833
And take a rest.

00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,633

551
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:26,567
See, I told you, it whispers.

552
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:29,100
It said, Wendigo, Wendigo.

553
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:32,933
Great.

554
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:40,067

try and get some rest.

00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:43,033

you perish in this cabin

Or out in the freezing cold.

now, but you'll

on the flesh of the others.

Leo, I don't know how
you dealt with being

592
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:54,633
Out alone last night because I
got a bad feeling about this.

593
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:56,833
Yeah, unless it's got US
grade A prime ribs stamped

On the side, and
done medium well,

You've got a bad
feeling about it.

596
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,000
Look, I just don't like
being out here, that's all.

597
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,167
I mean we don't know
where that thing is.

598
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:09,200
Yeah, well, it's my guess
that it's just as safe out here

599
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,000
As it is in that cabin.

You're right.

with you, man?

Nothing.

We just can't let that
thing get the edge on us.

these painkillers too long.

Here, hold this.

in that plane that still works.

see if we can spot Duke.

00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,167
No, unfortunately Duke wasn't
very good with passenger

Well that seems to be the story
here at Leelanau air tower.

Hey, Peter, He's dead.

737
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:18,467

What happened?

739
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:30,000
I was just watching him and
he just stopped breathing.

740
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,700
I mean, what are we going
to do with him, Pete?

I don't know.

back with some answers.

We aren't going to
bury him, are we?

I mean, I can't
bury my best friend.

745
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:48,800
He was my friend too.

746

We can't just leave him here.

747
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:52,500
He'll start to smell.

748
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:01,433
Maybe we could put him in
a box and set it outside.

749
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:03,833
Cold air will freeze him
until we get back to town.

750

Hey, no way, man.

751
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,800

best friend in some pine box.

the plane's crashed?

It's simple.

00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,233
I'm nothing but a scapegoat.

906
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:32,133
And now...

907
00:51:32,233 --> 00:51:33,767
[Crack]

908
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:35,033
Snap out of it, man.

909
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,700
What's the matter with you?

910
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,900
What are you talking about?

911
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,133
Monsters in the chili,
people catching on fire,

912
00:51:41,233 --> 00:51:43,733
Monsters in the woods.

913
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:44,800
You ought to see a doctor.

914
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,533
I am a doctor.

915
00:51:47,633 --> 00:51:48,700
Listen to me.

916
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,700
You better take my advice
and get out of here.

917
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,000
Before it's too late.

918
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:04,133

919
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:07,600
[Crack]

920
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,567
[Whistling]

921
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:12,000
[Growling]

922

[Screaming]

923
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:23,300
Please, God.

924
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,167
Let me live again.

925
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,667
[Static]

926
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:29,733
BDFD TV 3.

927
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,433
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.

928
00:52:31,533 --> 00:52:33,833
We here at BDFD
TV 3 have received

929
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,600
More information on the
situation in Manitou Island.

930
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,900
Rescue efforts
have been thwarted

931
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,967
By a mysterious blizzard,
which seems too have

932
00:52:40,067 --> 00:52:41,533
Centered over the island..

933
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:45,267
Local meteorologists cannot
explain this rare phenomena.

934
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:47,367
Our roaming reporter,
Harve Lindquist

935
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:49,700
Is at this moment in
downtown Bedford Falls,

936
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,367
And comes to us now
with this live report.

937
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:55,067
Harve, are you there?

938
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,000
BDFD TV.

939
00:52:58,833 --> 00:52:59,567
Yes, Jerry, I am.

940
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:00,500
Thank you.

941
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,600
Standing outside
of Sites's Tavern

942
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,600
In downtown Bedford
Falls, which is

943
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,400
Located on the western
shoreline of our state.

944
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,267
And standing with me is
Jake Davis, the son of Mr.

945
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:12,567
Duke Davis, the missing pilot.

946
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:15,000
Jake, still no radio
contact with your father,

947
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,500
Are you at all concerned
for his well-being.

948
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,400
Nah, does some weird things,
but probably just lost

949
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,300
His head.

950
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,700
I see.

951
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
Well, I understand your father's
a very well-liked and respected

952
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,000
Man in the community.

953
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,767
But the police still
haven't ruled out foul play.

954
00:53:28,867 --> 00:53:30,500
Is there anyone you can
think of who would have

955
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,667
Wished harm on your father?

956
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:34,433
He don't bother nobody and
nobody don't bother him.

957
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:35,233
That's right.

958
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:36,400
He's right.

959
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,200
Sir, you are?

960
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,400
Zeke Thatcher.

961
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,767
Tell me, Mr.
Thatcher, I understand

962
00:53:39,867 --> 00:53:42,033
That the Manitou Island is
visible from the shoreline

963
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:43,367
Ordinarily.

964
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,433
Have you seen anything unusual,
anything out the ordinary

965
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:46,800
On the island recently?

966
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,867
Well, the other night,
saw a bird big as a truck.

967
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:50,967
Ah, have another beer, Zeke.

968
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:52,167
Ah, come on.

969
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:54,300
No, you can't even see
the island from the shore.

970
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,100
Ma'am, ma'am, could
you step up please?

971
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,400
Ma'am, what is your name?

972
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,533
My name is Kay Dunnit.

973
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:00,500
My husband, Ray
Dunnit, he works over

974
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,200
At the fire station over there.

975
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,000
Uh, well, he was part
of the rescue team

976
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,367
That went to the island.

977
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,600
But they can't even see the
island from the shore anymore.

978
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,333
Harve, can you
get any information

979
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:11,200
On the rescue mission?

980
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,533
About this rescue mission,
I understand it was canceled

981
00:54:13,633 --> 00:54:15,100
Due to the inclement weather.

982
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,900
Is there anything you
can tell me about that?

983
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,267
Yeah, well Ray and the others,
they started to walk on the ice

984
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:21,100
Over to the island,
but the storm got

985
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,267
Really bad about halfway there.

986
00:54:23,367 --> 00:54:25,233
So they had to turn
around and come back.

987
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,633
Oh, you know, they
did tell me something

988
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:29,000
That was really strange.

989
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,967
They heard thunder over
the island in the blizzard.

990
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:33,700
Thunder in a
blizzard, a snowstorm.

991
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,767
I though that was kinda...

992
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:36,300
Thunder in a snowstorm.

993
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,633
Yeah, yeah, you know
something really weird

994
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,900
Going on over at that island.

995
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,300
Well, folks, there you have it.

996
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,867
Panic is beginning to spread in
the tiny town of Bedford Falls.

997
00:54:45,967 --> 00:54:48,033
And I guess all we can
do is pray for the safety

998
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:51,233
Of Duke Davis and the hunters
trapped on Manitou island.

999
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,533
So live outside
of Sites's Tavern,

1000
00:54:53,633 --> 00:54:57,533
I'm Harve Lindquist for
BDFD TV 3 Action News.

1001
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:58,333
Back to you, Jerry.

1002
00:55:01,067 --> 00:55:02,400
Thank you, Harve.

1003
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,333
We will continue to
keep you informed

1004
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:06,100
Of the situation
on Manitou Island

1005
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,433
As the information comes to us.

1006
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,967
Jerry Harris, BDFD TV 3.

1007
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,400
It's nearly dark.

1008
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,900
We've got to get out
and find the circle.

1009
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,967
What are you talking about?

1010
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,833
None of us are going
out there tonight.

1011
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:24,000
Not until someone comes
back with some answers.

1012
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,400
Gary and Tony aren't
even back yet.

1013
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,567
They've been gone all day.

1014
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:30,000
The longer it has, the
more powerful it gets.

1015
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,300
If you're so important, why
don't you just go by yourself?

1016
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,467
You don't need us.

1017
00:55:33,567 --> 00:55:35,233
I can't do this alone.

1018
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,067
Well, you're just going to
have to wait until morning.

1019
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,267
We're not going anywhere.

1020
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:39,567
I think Leo's right.

1021
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:40,833
We have to wait.

1022
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:46,633
The only thing you'll be
waiting for is your own death.

1023
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:47,600
That's him.

1024
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,400
Who?

1025
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,500
It's either Gary or Tony.

1026
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,933
Three shots in a row
is the distress signal.

1027
00:55:52,033 --> 00:55:53,800
You going out there?

1028
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,200
We've got to.

1029
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,500
I'm coming along.

1030
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,967
No, you're not.

1031
00:55:58,067 --> 00:55:59,800
You wait here in
case they come back.

1032
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,233
We'll be gone half an hour.

1033
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:05,000
And if we're not back,
you can write us off.

1034
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,400
Then you're on your own.

1035
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,300
Just grab what you like.

1036
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,133
When we get back, we'll
help you all right.

1037
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:12,633
Just a half an hour, man.

1038
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:16,300
I don't want to be out there in
the dark with all those things.

1039
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,200
Half an hour.

1040
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:58,933
Gary!

1041
00:56:59,033 --> 00:57:00,767
Tony!

1042
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:01,600
Shut up.

1043
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,600
You want the pigs to hear us?

1044
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,067
You gotta be quiet, man.

1045
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:21,167
The pigs are every place.

1046
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:22,767
This is definitely
not what I planned when

1047
00:57:22,867 --> 00:57:24,700
I told Tony I'd come hunting.

1048
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,633
I swear.

1049
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:29,000
You don't have to
worry about it anyway.

1050
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,067
Because out here, we're
the ones being hunted.

1051
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:48,633
[Crying]

1052
00:58:11,433 --> 00:58:13,833
Hey, Leo.

1053
00:58:13,933 --> 00:58:14,833
Over here.

1054
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,300
What's it going to do?

1055
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,100
Escape?

1056
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:39,167
Sandy!

1057
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:46,100
Sandy!

1058
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,600
Mother?

1059
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,067
He sent you.

1060
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,567
The Guardian sent you.

1061
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:54,033
Shh.

1062
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:56,033
I'm here now.

1063
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,533
That's all that matters.

1064
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:01,533
Let's go inside.

1065
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:03,733
I need to talk to you.

1066
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:06,167
I'm here to help you.

1067
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:12,767
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1068
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:15,000
Say, mister.

1069
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,833
Hey, buddy.

1070
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:17,633
You all right?

1071
00:59:25,433 --> 00:59:26,300
Hey, fella.

1072
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:31,267
Say something.

1073
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,167
[Retching]

1074
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:42,133
Oh, my god.

1075
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:45,100
They tore him in half.

1076
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,800
And they ate the
skin off his face.

1077
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:48,633
They're cannibals.

1078
00:59:48,733 --> 00:59:50,400
They ate the skin off his face.

1079
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,100
It's not Gary.

1080
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:55,933
It's not him.

1081
00:59:56,033 --> 00:59:57,400
Let's get the hell out of here.

1082
01:00:02,467 --> 01:00:03,367
Wait, wait.

1083
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:04,367
I gotta stop.

1084
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:05,500
Come on, man.

1085
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,333
We got to make it back
before she locks us out

1086
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:08,133
Here all night.

1087
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:10,067
Come on, Nick.

1088
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:12,500
You are the Chosen One.

1089
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,233
It can't be me.

1090
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:18,033
I'm not strong enough, Mother.

1091
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:23,333
But dear, you do
have much strength.

1092
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,633
No, I don't.

1093
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:28,767
Some of which
you've shown already.

1094
01:00:28,867 --> 01:00:30,967
I don't even understand it.

1095
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:33,300
How can I stop it?

1096
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,067
How can I stop it?

1097
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:36,200
Shh.

1098
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,667
It's OK.

1099
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:38,867
No.

1100
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:39,967
(MONSTER VOICE) It's OK.

1101
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:45,233
(HIGH MONSTER VOICE) It's OK.

1102
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:47,233
[Crying]

1103
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:48,233
It's OK.

1104
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,200
[Roaring]

1105
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,700
No!

1106
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,500
Mother!

1107
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:02,667
(SCREAMING)No!

1108
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:03,467
No!

1109

[Roaring]

1110
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:17,633
Love you too, daughter.

1111
01:01:17,733 --> 01:01:19,633
I'm not your daughter!

1112
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:28,100
We will defeat you.

1113
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,100
We will defeat you.

1114
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,067
[Gun shot] I'm melting!

1115
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:41,067
I'm melting.

1116
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:42,067
I'm melting.

1117
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,967
[Wolf howl]

1118
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:12,467
Listen, listen.

1119
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:15,167
The thing doesn't howl, does it?

1120
01:02:15,267 --> 01:02:16,267
I don't know.

1121
01:02:16,367 --> 01:02:20,433
The Hoodigo Wendigo gets
nothing out from me.

1122
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:21,433
Come on, Nick.

1123
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,433
Nick, come on.

1124
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:27,933
Nick, come on.

1125
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:28,933
Come on.

1126
01:02:29,033 --> 01:02:31,400
[Screaming]

1127
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:53,367
What happened out there?

1128
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:55,933
I went back to the crash.

1129
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:58,267
Tony was dead.

1130
01:02:58,367 --> 01:02:59,267
Somebody had crushed his neck.

1131
01:03:13,067 --> 01:03:14,433
Where you going?

1132
01:03:14,533 --> 01:03:16,167
I've gotta find the circle.

1133
01:03:16,267 --> 01:03:17,133
What?

1134
01:03:17,233 --> 01:03:18,733
The only way to
stop the Wendigo

1135
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:21,433
Is to close the sacred circle.

1136
01:03:21,533 --> 01:03:23,867
I know what it is
and where it is too.

1137
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,700
So you mean you're the one
those things are after.

1138
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,867
You gotta take me there.

1139
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:27,867
And we gotta go now.

1140
01:03:27,967 --> 01:03:29,367
It's all making sense.

1141
01:03:29,467 --> 01:03:30,333
You're the one.

1142
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:32,333
[Crash]

1143
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,767
Where's the circle?

1144
01:03:36,867 --> 01:03:38,733
On the other side
of the island.

1145
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:40,700
[Growling]

1146
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,700
It's a couple miles.

1147
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,667
It's a circle.

1148
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:44,467
Let's go.

1149
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,567
[Growling]

1150
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,533
Gary, Wake up.

1151
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:01,833
What is it?

1152
01:04:01,933 --> 01:04:03,967
What kind of circle?

1153
01:04:04,067 --> 01:04:05,767
It's a circle of skulls.

1154
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:07,267
But I broke it.

1155
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:26,200
[Crash]

1156
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,700
[Growling]

1157
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,167
[Gun shot]

1158
01:04:52,933 --> 01:04:53,633
Sandy!

1159
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,100
What are you doing?

1160
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:13,067
Falling.

1161
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:14,567
Gary, help me!

1162
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:22,033
[Screaming]

1163
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:44,467
Help me!

1164
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:45,967
Help!

1165
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,467
[Screaming]

1166
01:05:51,067 --> 01:05:51,967
Put me down!

1167
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,033
I can't get warm.

1168
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:11,867
You've lost control of
your body temperature.

1169
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:13,767
It's way below normal.

1170
01:06:13,867 --> 01:06:15,700
Don't exert any energy.

1171
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,167
It only makes it
harder to bring up.

1172
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:21,767
You're suffering
from hypothermia.

1173
01:06:21,867 --> 01:06:22,733
I'm cold.

1174
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:32,833
Relax

1175
01:06:32,933 --> 01:06:33,800
No.

1176
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:34,600
No.

1177
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,733
Slow your breathing.

1178
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:54,767
Shh.

1179
01:06:54,867 --> 01:06:57,367
Slow your breathing.

1180
01:06:57,467 --> 01:06:58,767
No.

1181
01:06:58,867 --> 01:07:00,033
Warm up.

1182
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:01,033
Please.

1183
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:01,833
Warm up.

1184
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:40,233

Sandy.

1188
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,267
It broke my arms.

1190
01:08:01,233 --> 01:08:05,467

1191
01:08:05,567 --> 01:08:07,900
Now look.

1192
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,367
Look into my eyes.

1193
01:08:10,467 --> 01:08:12,333
[Screaming]

1194
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:17,500

You OK?

1202
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:42,600
We've got to leave.

1203
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:52,333
Every minute we wait,
the Wendigo grows.

1204
01:09:08,633 --> 01:09:10,033
We've got to hurry.

1205
01:09:10,133 --> 01:09:11,533
We might be too late already.

1206
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:14,000
What the hell is
going on out there?

1207
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,000
Those are my friends.

1208
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,500
They're not anymore.

1209
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,500
They're just as much the
Wendigo as the Wendigo itself.

1210
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,933
It controls their bodies.

1211
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:25,167
They crave human flesh.

1212
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:27,600
They're cannibals.

1213
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,033

01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,200

01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,400
Let's go.

1217
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,367
You gotta help me.

1218
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:39,333
I tried to get away.

1219
01:09:39,433 --> 01:09:40,833
It didn't help.

1220
01:09:40,933 --> 01:09:42,300
No, not away.

1221
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,567
To the other side
of the island.

1222
01:09:44,667 --> 01:09:46,400
We've got to find
the circle of skulls.

1223
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,700
And I'm afraid we have
to do it before morning.

1224
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,700
Before morning?

1225
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,700
It's almost morning now.

1226
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,833
I can feel the
Wendigo's power growing.

1227
01:09:52,933 --> 01:09:56,800
By morning, he'll be free of the
circle, free to move and grow.

1228
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,100
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

1229
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,933
Armageddon.

1230
01:10:01,033 --> 01:10:03,533
Wendigo will start small.

1231
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:05,367
Then death will rise.

1232
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:07,633
Then demons will emerge from
the bowels of the earth.

1233
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:13,867
Don't shoot us, Peter.

1234
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:15,333
We can't help what happened.

1235
01:10:15,433 --> 01:10:18,267
We can't help what we crave.

1236
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,200
We're victims.

1237
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,133
Just like you.

1238
01:10:22,233 --> 01:10:24,100
Don't shoot me.

1239
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,067
Don't shoot.

What is it?

1249
01:11:13,533 --> 01:11:16,900
It happened.

1250
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,833
The gate has been opened.

1251
01:11:20,933 --> 01:11:23,800
The Wendigo is at full strength.

1252
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,700
I seem to be losing mine.

1253
01:11:49,367 --> 01:11:51,767
That's it.

1254
01:11:51,867 --> 01:11:53,767
That's the circle.

1255
01:11:53,867 --> 01:11:56,767
There's the break.

1256
01:11:56,867 --> 01:11:59,233
There's got to be
another source somewhere.

1257
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:01,733
I've got to find it.

1258
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,233
Where?

1259
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:04,233

01:12:59,867 --> 01:13:00,567
Don't!

1271
01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:06,033
[Explosion]

1272
01:13:40,033 --> 01:13:42,433
[Growling]

1273
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:48,600
Hey, you ugly son of a bitch!

1274
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,400
Over here!

1275
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,400
Whoa!

1276
01:14:20,933 --> 01:14:24,300
[Static crackling]

1277
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,733
[Roaring]

1278
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:53,733
She defeated you.

1279
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:54,700
No.

1280
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,200
No.

1281
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:00,700
[Screaming]

1282
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,200
OTHER WORLDLY VOICE: No,
She has defeated you.

1283
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,667
The gate to your
world is closing.

1284
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:09,667
Go with it.

1285
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:12,167
The battle is over.

1286
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:17,133
Then you will die.

1287
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,100
Sandy.

1288
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,600
You must join me.

1289
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,100
I cannot stop it.

1290
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,100
Stand up.

1291
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,067
Sandy.

1292
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,067
You have the power.

1293
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:42,067
Join me.

1294
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:45,567
We must stop the Wendigo.

1295
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:48,567
[Static crackling]

1296
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:04,000
[Explosion]

1297
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,367
Don't be afraid.

1298
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,833
Never be afraid.

1299
01:16:26,933 --> 01:16:32,167
You have defeated the evil and
you are free to go for now.

1300
01:16:32,267 --> 01:16:37,633
But remember, the Wendigo's
spirit only rests.

1301
01:16:37,733 --> 01:16:41,333
And there may come a day when
you area called upon again.

1302
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,300
[Roaring]

1303
01:16:57,367 --> 01:17:02,500
