1
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:12,571
I always believed
that love was fairly uncomplicated.

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,544
You found the perfect woman,
gorgeous but practical.

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:21,410
You married, settled down
with children, minivan, mortgage...

4
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:32,097
...and lived quietly, predictably,
happily ever after.

5
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:39,905
That was my dream
until she came into my life.

6
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,930
Her name is Charlene.
She's an art student.

7
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,057
No way.

8
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,262
She's visiting here from New York.

9
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,965
Her grandmother's setting up
some art exhibit or something...

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,167
No way. The last time you set me up...

11
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,903
Did I ask you to take her out? No.

12
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,174
I just asked you to pick her up
from the airport and...

13
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,307
...show her the sights of Salt Lake
on your way to her parent's house.

14
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,614
Then dinner, if she's hungry.

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,278
Sounds like a date to me.

16
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,847
She's here on vacation.
She just wants to see the sights.

17
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,948
So send Mom.

18
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,358
Her father seems to think
you two might hit it off.

19
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,452
Her father?

20
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,691
My new regional manager.

21
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,699
The plot thickens.

22
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,794
Look, all I want you to do
is pick her up, show her the sights...

23
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,738
...take her home. Simple. Easy.

24
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,608
Well then I'll take her to Temple Square
and buy her a milk shake.

25
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,010
You can do better than that.
It's only one night.

26
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,482
Please. As a favor to me.

27
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,113
Subsidy?

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,592
Welfare?

29
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,164
Deal.

30
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,337
Seventy bucks and the Mustang.
I was on a roll.

31
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:35,850
One lap around town, a light dinner,
home by 8:30 and I'm 50 bucks richer.

32
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,249
I was smooth, confident, in control.

33
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,362
Well, mostly.

34
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:52,363
Besides, it was one night. What could
possibly happen in one night.

35
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,248
Mark.

36
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,343
So, marry me.

37
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,184
How romantic. Too late.

38
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,192
- I want to be married, to you.
- And you know what that means?

39
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,058
Two people with matching rings,
spending time together.

40
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,629
What more could you want?

41
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,526
I'll let you know when I find it.

42
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,394
Come back to New York.
We can do this like you wanted to.

43
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,599
Why the rush now? I'm here, I might as
well see what Salt Lake has to offer.

44
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,369
C'mon Charly, quit with the games.

45
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,569
Who's playing?

46
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,840
You're a little upset.
You play games when you're upset.

47
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,950
Tell your Dad
you're getting back on the plane.

48
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,108
Dad's not coming to get me.

49
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,378
Who is?

50
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,080
I don't know. Dad arranged it. Jealous?

51
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,818
- Of what, some Mormon guy?
- How do you know he's Mormon?

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,018
You're in Utah...

53
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,755
...the state that buys more wedding
and birth announcements per capita...

54
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,399
...than any other state
in the civilized world.

55
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,527
Trust me, he's a straight-laced,
buttoned down, bore.

56
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:00,802
Hello...

57
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,533
...Charly, are you listening?

58
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:08,113
Believe me, Mark.
You have nothing to worry about.

59
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,415
That's me.

60
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,252
On the sign.

61
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,221
I'm Utah. Welcome to Sam.

62
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,729
Nice to meet you, Utah.
Sam's a beautiful place.

63
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,264
I take it you're my ride home.

64
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,996
Sorry. Yeah, Sam Roberts.
Can I help you with that?

65
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,696
No thanks, got it.

66
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,898
You work for my father?

67
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,842
- No. Actually I'm a student, like you.
- You're an art major?

68
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,379
- Computer Information Systems.
- Perfect.

69
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,075
Did my father tell you why
he wanted you to pick me up?

70
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,446
Actually, I've never met your...

71
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,521
I'm practically engaged,
but Daddy hates my choice of men...

72
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:54,525
...so he looks for fine upstanding men,
like yourself, to lure me away.

73
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,495
And you know what? It's working.

74
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,066
Coming, Utah?

75
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,334
You're engaged?

76
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,807
He's asked, but I haven't said yes.
Why, are you interested?

77
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,275
Don't you think you ought to get that?

78
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,279
Sorry, it's to remind me not to be late.

79
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,746
Okay, Utah.
Let's get this over with, shall we?

80
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,146
Look, if you don't want to go out I'm...

81
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,719
And disappoint Daddy?
Not a chance. What's the plan?

82
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,618
You decide. I've got the local historical
sites and points of interest here.

83
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,725
- Amy, Anna, Barbara, Tessa.
- Wrong list.

84
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,350
- Utah, is that your little black book?
- "This is the Place Monument"?

85
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,689
- Not much there.
- Hogel Zoo, then?

86
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,694
I'm allergic.

87
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,526
What do the little
check marks mean?

88
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,464
There's always Trolley Square?

89
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:41,972
It used to be a trolley station
and now it's a huge shopping mall.

90
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:42,836
Fascinating.

91
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,844
- Yours?
- My father's.

92
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:50,278
Do you have a rating system
or is it survival of the fittest with you?

93
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,580
There's always Kennecott Copper Mine.
The largest open strip mine in the world.

94
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,189
Hate to pass that up.

95
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,554
A fun filled evening with you
at the local strip mine.

96
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,218
Somehow, Utah,
you don't seem the type.

97
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,589
What'd you put in these things.

98
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,499
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Come on, Utah.

99
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,899
Are you crazy?

100
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,170
Slow down. I want to be able to
borrow this car again.

101
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,477
Life is for fun, Sam,
sounds like you need a life.

102
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:30,220
- Can't drive like this in Manhattan.
- Not supposed to in Utah, Charlene...

103
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,085
Charly, call me Charly.

104
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,854
I don't think this is such
a good idea, Charly.

105
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,294
Relax, Utah! If you can drive
in New York, you can drive anywhere.

106
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,662
Of course, I can't drive in
New York anymore.

107
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,268
- Does this radio work?
- Don't touch that.

108
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,335
Watch the road!

109
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,829
- Hey, did you see that?
- What?

110
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,452
Look at that, c'mon Sam.

111
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,467
It's beautiful.

112
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,474
- Tickets for the Ferris Wheel, please.
- How many?

113
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,708
We'll take whatever you've got.

114
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,749
Thank you.

115
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,654
Next please.

116
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,493
Welcome aboard.

117
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,998
- What's your name?
- Raferty, ma'am.

118
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,397
Mr. Raferty, please meet my fiancé.

119
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,836
He's just proposed
and you're the first to know.

120
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,202
Actually, we've just met.

121
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,833
- Congratulations, kids.
- Why, thank you.

122
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:03,109
Sam and I would like to ride
your Ferris wheel for a long, long time.

123
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,183
You understand?

124
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,277
I'm not that old.

125
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,811
- Good.
- Hang on.

126
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,418
- Do you do that often?
- What?

127
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,254
Lie to complete strangers.

128
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,991
No. I lie to people I know, too.
Come on, loosen up, Utah.

129
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,268
Aren't you kind of cold in that?

130
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,465
Why are you hot?

131
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,181
Why couldn't we be engaged?
Aren't I good enough for you?

132
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,782
I don't even know you!

133
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,250
Exactly my point.
Who's to say I couldn't qualify?

134
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,648
You voted for him?

135
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,153
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

136
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,953
Nothing if you like a soil grubbing,
global warming corporate puppet.

137
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,892
It's nice to know America is safe
in the hands of voters like you.

138
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,563
- Describe her to me.
- Careful. Who?

139
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,610
The future Mrs. Utah. What's she like?
No, let me guess.

140
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:12,476
A little on the stout side, but pleasant,
always pleasant.

141
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:18,022
Perpetually aproned, but never ruffled.
June Cleaver with a dayplanner.

142
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,591
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

143
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,754
Come on, Utah. You can't tell me
sitting there in your starched shirt...

144
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,424
...that you don't dream of marrying
an ultra-organized gorgeous woman...

145
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:33,562
...who just happens to love to cook
and sew and cater to your every whim.

146
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,169
I don't know what I want yet.

147
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,204
I certainly haven't found her...

148
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,336
...when I do...

149
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,851
...we'll both know it and we won't
run around being practically engaged.

150
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,015
We'll get married
and we'll stay married...

151
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:58,762
...because you don't toss love around
between the lost and found.

152
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,995
You really mean like,
till death do you part?

153
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,500
No, more like forever.

154
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,232
Why Utah, you're a romantic.

155
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,209
Who would have guessed it?

156
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,907
A man who actually believes in
happily ever after.

157
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,377
I hope you find it.

158
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,785
This one is your fault.

159
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,717
Most everything is.

160
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,831
Whose idea was it
to have him pick her up?

161
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,829
Now Claire...

162
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,457
I could have picked her up.
You could have picked her up.

163
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,866
I don't think she'd have enjoyed that
nearly as much.

164
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:43,169
You'd prefer she date the same riff raff
she's brought home since junior high?

165
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,776
Captain Non-Commitment.

166
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,934
Mark?

167
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,806
Well, he'd be a whole lot better
than some hypertensive boy scout.

168
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,973
Oh, I don't know.
I think he's kind of cute.

169
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,788
Why didn't you tell me
he was so handsome, Eddie.

170
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,322
I imagined someone more humble.

171
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,449
You three behave.

172
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,892
Sam, I want you to meet my family.

173
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,399
- This is my father and mother.
- Mr. And Mrs. Riley.

174
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,661
No need to be so formal.

175
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,170
Call them Eddie and Claire.
They love that kind of thing.

176
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,875
And this is my grandmother.

177
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,239
You can call me anything you want.

178
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,545
I had so much fun the other night
Sam's showing me more of the city.

179
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,150
He's lived here his whole life.

180
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,880
Tell them that fascinating thing
you said on our drive from the airport.

181
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,860
Did you know there's a difference in
humidity between here and New York?

182
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,522
- Really?
- Fascinating.

183
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,189
A difference in humidity?

184
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,392
Right. That's why we feel
so uncomfortable now.

185
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,764
I don't feel uncomfortable.

186
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,998
That's because we're inside.
Just wait and you'll feel uncomfortable.

187
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,506
- You mean, when I'm alone with you?
- That's not what I meant.

188
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,305
What exactly do you mean?

189
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,376
We have to go.

190
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,952
He can be so shy sometimes.
Don't wait up.

191
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,464
So, now I can say
I have seen the Mormon Vatican.

192
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,502
Temple Square?
You almost got us kicked out.

193
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,730
There wasn't a sign.

194
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,273
I don't think they anticipated someone
would go wading in the reflection pool.

195
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,610
Can I get you anything else?

196
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,145
I'd like a glass of Merlot please.

197
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,579
I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol here.
Would you care for something else.

198
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,150
We're fine, thanks.

199
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,914
You people are so much fun.

200
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,683
- Charlene...
- Charly

201
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,520
Charly, why did you ask me out?

202
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,619
Your magnetic personality.
I feel irresistibly drawn to you.

203
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,562
- Can you be serious.
- I'm trying to be.

204
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,862
You are the oddest woman
I have ever met.

205
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:56,568
You lie all the time, you've no respect
and you're always messing around.

206
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,542
- I have no idea how to take you.
- Take me where?

207
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,779
Truth? You intrigue me.

208
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,316
A grown man
who still believes in fairy-tales.

209
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,284
But I wonder...

210
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,652
...does he really believe it or has he
just never read anything else?

211
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,590
Maybe it's not a fairy-tale.

212
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:20,665
Sam, you are not like any Prince
I've ever read about...

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,098
...and I am no Princess.

214
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,673
Still, you do have a castle
and it is beautiful.

215
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,913
Who knows? Maybe while I'm here
I could learn more about you.

216
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,375
The Mormons, I mean.

217
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,320
I think I can arrange that.

218
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,054
The first principle
is the plan of our Heavenly Father...

219
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,560
Maybe a Missionary discussion wasn't
the best choice for a second date...

220
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,460
...but it went well, I thought
and I was ready for the next step.

221
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,970
I don't believe a word of it.

222
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,373
My grandmother is convinced
I'm in the clutches of a strange man...

223
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,170
...bent on making me the
newest member of your church.

224
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,079
And she thinks it's all very romantic.

225
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,813
My parents vowed never to let anyone
pick me up from the airport again.

226
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,516
What do you do with all this stuff?

227
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,114
We can it.

228
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,625
We put it in glass jars and store it.

229
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,693
Doesn't my Dad pay
your father enough?

230
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,153
You're changing the subject.
What about the Missionaries?

231
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,924
I told you, I don't believe it.

232
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,728
- What are these?
- Green beans. Have one.

233
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,200
Why don't you believe it?

234
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,801
I told you. The whole thing is ridiculous.

235
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,238
The hardest thing to understand is
why you believe it.

236
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,077
- You look like an intelligent person.
- Is that right?

237
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,477
Of course, looks can be deceiving.

238
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,846
You have raspberries.

239
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,182
- Why don't you find out for yourself?
- No, I thought that's what I'd done.

240
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,854
You have to ask.

241
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,424
These would be so good
with ice cream.

242
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,652
I mean you have to pray.

243
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,590
- To what?
- God.

244
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,023
"Hey, God, you up there?"

245
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,497
Something like that.

246
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,626
And He'll just pop right up and answer?

247
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,967
Me and all the other
five, six billion people on the planet?

248
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,132
He'll answer. Really.

249
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,346
Like hearing voices?

250
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,646
No, it's... You feel it
more than anything else and you know.

251
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,179
You're kind of cute
when you're serious.

252
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:28,055
You've got this furrow thing right there.
Very distinguished.

253
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:32,293
We could pray right now, right here.
It's secluded.

254
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,157
Why, Sam. You romantic devil you.

255
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,465
Do you want to say the prayer?

256
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,593
C'mon. Kneel down.

257
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,501
If these bushes suddenly burst into
flames and Charlton Heston appears...

258
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,669
...you're in big trouble!

259
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,045
Do you mind?
We're about to talk to God here.

260
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,551
Okay, close your eyes and I'll say it.

261
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:10,124
Sam, you're definitely crazy.

262
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,471
So, what do you think?

263
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,576
Technically, fine...

264
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,013
But?

265
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,613
But why the fruit salad?

266
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,586
What's so compelling
about a bunch of fruit?

267
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,757
My style is just different from yours.

268
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,826
It's not a matter of style.

269
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:40,796
So we see the world differently.
We may be looking for different things.

270
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:49,603
The point is, until you feel
something here you can't reveal it here.

271
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:58,276
You're right. It's your exhibit, anyway.
I'm just not ready.

272
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,113
Nonsense.
You're a marvelous painter...

273
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,745
...and I would love to have some of
your work included in the exhibit.

274
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,624
This is an exercise.

275
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:15,065
If you want to be an artist, take a risk.

276
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,067
Find something
you don't own completely...

277
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:24,574
...something you feel so deeply
you're sure you can't possibly paint it.

278
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,378
Paint that.

279
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,013
He was a cute little boy, wasn't he.

280
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,546
He's kind of cute now.

281
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,589
He'll do.

282
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:47,933
He's a good guy. I didn't know
if you'd be back after last time.

283
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,124
You saw?

284
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:54,035
No, Sam told me. You know,
sometimes he can be a little intense.

285
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:54,901
Really?

286
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,306
Yes. He once told me he didn't
think it proper for a woman my age...

287
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,436
...to be singing and dancing
in the kitchen.

288
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,939
He was five.

289
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:11,219
For all his stubborn persistence,
he has a good heart.

290
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,755
He wouldn't push so hard
if he didn't care.

291
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,490
This is all very important to him, isn't it.

292
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,029
Yes. In a way, it's who he is.

293
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,495
Jo, are you telling tales on our son?

294
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,296
Only the most embarrassing ones.

295
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,667
Good, I'll join in.

296
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:32,709
We were talking about Sam's manner
the last time Charly was here.

297
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,778
Yes. Praying in the backyard.

298
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:40,146
Classic Roberts family dating technique.
Smooth. Subtle.

299
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,219
It worked for you.

300
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,614
Behave kids.

301
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,085
We've always been somewhat
of an embarrassment to him.

302
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,683
So what have you been talking about?

303
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,765
- That should do it. Thank you.
- Thank you.

304
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,396
- Hello.
- Hi.

305
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:06,210
- Who's that?
- You're going to love this.

306
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,382
Turn me on.

307
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:19,420
Yes, I'd know those legs anywhere.
Hi.

308
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,152
Alright, Mark, what are you up to?

309
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,662
I just wanted to see
your beautiful face...

310
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,257
...and get your professional opinion.

311
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,926
These are samples from our new line.

312
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,698
I'm leaving next week on a sales trip
to push them. What do you think?

313
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,708
Mark, why do they have
our names on the front?

314
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:47,111
What a coincidence.
Which do you like better?

315
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,180
Why do you want to get married, Mark?

316
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,583
Honestly?

317
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,187
I move from two drawers into a closet,
I get my name on the mailbox...

318
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,726
...and I get controlling share
of the remote control.

319
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,927
Darling, come on I'm teasing you here.

320
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,991
You know how I feel about you.

321
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,763
How long do you plan
on feeling that way?

322
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,102
Well, according to this one...

323
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,076
...until the stars fall from the sky
and the Earth stops spinning.

324
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,943
No, seriously, Mark.

325
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,577
Do you honestly believe
two people can be so happy together...

326
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,484
...they'd want it to last forever?

327
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:30,390
Happily ever after?
It's kind of a clichéd notion, no?

328
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,087
Yeah, I think so.

329
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,996
What does that mean?
Happily ever after?

330
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,796
After what? After taxes?

331
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,630
After the divorce?

332
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:48,940
Darling, maybe it means a surprise,
"They are happy after all."

333
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,850
Where is all this coming from?
Is that desert air getting to you?

334
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,050
Don't you ever wonder
if there's something more?

335
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,919
Life is for fun.
Take the chances that it gives you...

336
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,292
...and make the best of it.
What else is there?

337
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:11,095
That's just it. I don't know.

338
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,500
Sure New York has its museums,
Broadway, two good baseball teams...

339
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,274
...but there was one thing it didn't have
and I wanted Charly to experience it.

340
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,526
Excuse me.

341
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,459
Yes, you.

342
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:49,471
Is the fishing any better over there?
We are having no luck over here.

343
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,539
Sorry!

344
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,645
Don't tell me it's a fish finder, too.

345
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,984
Time to move.

346
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:15,089
You know, you might have more luck
if you just snuck up on the little fishes.

347
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,867
You know, catch them by surprise.

348
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:24,974
It's just a tire.

349
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,010
That is no tire.

350
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,481
I got me a fish.

351
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,913
- What do I do?
- Set the hook!

352
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,912
Set it Where?

353
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,614
Call me Ishmael.

354
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,591
Look out for the rookie.

355
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:45,090
C'mon little fishy c'mon.
Come to mamma.

356
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,362
It's kind of little.

357
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,639
I suppose you know why
we've asked you all here this morning.

358
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:02,340
Because some of you have been
putting marshmallows on your hooks...

359
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:06,474
...the Utah Fish and Game Department
has asked me to speak today.

360
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:10,349
Clinical research just released
indicate that the fish in this lake...

361
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,753
...have 53 percent more cavities.

362
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,426
Do you know what this means?!

363
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,663
It means the UFGD
must now stand the expense...

364
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,926
...of sending a trout
through dental school!

365
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,070
Nice.

366
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,444
- Where are we going Sam?
- Away.

367
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:40,174
I embarrassed you, is that it?
Go ahead. Say it.

368
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,813
You embarrassed me.

369
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,660
No, Sam, this is where you stop rowing
and throw water on me.

370
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,424
It's what we call a water fight.
Can you say that for me, dear?

371
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,193
"Water fight."

372
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,169
It's one of those happy, spontaneous
things people do in this dull world.

373
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,674
You've got no sense of fun.

374
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,310
- Life is for laughing.
- I laugh.

375
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,314
No, you smile faintly.

376
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,051
No good. Too forced.
It's not spontaneous.

377
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,190
I laugh responsibly.

378
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,088
Could you define that for us, Senator?

379
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,792
After the work is done, if there's
time left over, I laugh and have fun.

380
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:30,229
Try again. Sam, there's never
any time when the work is done.

381
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,165
You have to laugh during the work.

382
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:38,468
What would happen
if this were suddenly to disappear?

383
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,443
- Come on, Charly.
- Would the world stop spinning?

384
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,173
Would your universe
careen out of space?

385
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,112
Very funny, now come on.

386
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,684
You want it? You'll have to get it.

387
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,851
You wouldn't.

388
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,427
Nice catch.

389
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,152
It's not my fault.

390
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,265
How was I supposed to know
you'd jump in the lake?

391
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,703
I tell you, I'm completely innocent.

392
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,271
You innocent? Look at this.
My whole life was in this thing.

393
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:11,307
See, that's the thing. Don't you find
that the teeniest bit twisted?

394
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,776
- May I help you, sir?
- Yes. Can this be fixed?

395
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,909
Don't suppose
you have flood insurance?

396
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,944
No, of course not.

397
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,684
Tell you what, let me just...

398
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,487
I'll go talk to my manager and
see if your warranty covers...

399
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,719
- Women.
- Pardon me?

400
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,195
Actually, only one. See if my warranty
covers Charlene Riley.

401
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,299
A woman, sir?

402
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,662
Charlene Riley, R-I-L-E-Y.

403
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,233
Sam. Sammy, this is Mommy,
do you hear me?

404
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,465
There she is now.

405
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,097
Sammy, this is Mommy.

406
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:47,541
The nice men in the store
let me talk to you on their big radio.

407
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,112
Sir, you're mother did this to you?

408
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,239
No, actually it was my Dad.
It all started with my Dad.

409
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,478
Sammy, if you can hear me,
listen carefully.

410
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,281
Mommy's sorry, Sammy.

411
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:01,085
I'll buy you a new toy,
just don't be angry anymore.

412
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,026
Remember when Mommy bought you
a big bag of popcorn last week?

413
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:10,829
Go to the popcorn machine.
Mommy has a bag of popcorn for you.

414
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:14,370
And Sammy,
Mommy loves you, dear.

415
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,535
Oh, poor little guy.

416
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,835
You have no idea.

417
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,004
Hi, Sammy.

418
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,311
What?

419
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,581
I said I was sorry.

420
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,050
Remember where we are.

421
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,148
Then you admit it wasn't my fault.

422
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,885
- Sir, your Palm.
- Keep it.

423
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,245
Is it always like this?

424
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,814
No. This is just a good day.

425
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,378
It's a very good day.

426
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,103
Hi, Charly and Mark. We're not in now,
but you can leave a message...

427
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,470
...unless it's important in which case
we prefer you keep it to yourself.

428
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:32,940
Your choice after the beep.

429
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,746
Mark, Charly. We need to talk.
Please call.

430
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,360
It's the third visit this week.

431
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,664
She's stopped drinking coffee
with me in the mornings.

432
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,366
I set up a private lesson
with the tennis pro last Sunday...

433
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,136
...and she found a reason not to go.

434
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,405
Come to find out later
she'd been to church, with him.

435
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,014
Maybe we should call Mark.

436
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,242
She doesn't seem too interested
in Mark at the moment.

437
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,615
- Does he know that?
- We can't let our imaginations run wild.

438
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,952
Soon she'll be back in New York
and forget all this nonsense.

439
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,151
- But Mark could make her forget now.
- Mark is an idiot.

440
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,855
But he's handsome, fun.
We should call him.

441
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:32,163
It wouldn't hurt to mention
she's asking about him in a casual way.

442
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,070
I am not going to encourage my only
daughter to marry some worthless...

443
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,437
Goodbye, Sister Riley.
See you in church on Sunday.

444
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,879
I'll need his number.

445
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:10,935
Mark, are you there? This is Edward.
About Charly, something's changed.

446
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,303
What do you think?

447
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,325
You haven't said much about the
Church since I tried to pray with you.

448
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,767
- Which church?
- Come on, you know.

449
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:18,338
Well I decided to be fair. We
Easterners are noted for our fairness.

450
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,007
I've heard about the Salem witch trials.

451
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:26,477
Not bad.
Stick with me and I'll make you a wit.

452
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,517
You're halfway there now.

453
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,850
I've read the Book of Mormon.

454
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,455
Nice technique.

455
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:39,822
You did?

456
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,398
You're not going to make us kneel
and pray in this boat, are you?

457
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,432
No.

458
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,806
Play along, I thought.

459
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,208
Take the lessons, go to Church,
and then leave them laughing.

460
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,912
It's all part of the Utah tour.

461
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,244
And?

462
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,481
I'm from New York.

463
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,184
The Museum of Natural History,
the Hayden Planetarium...

464
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,017
...the Metropolitan Museum of Art...

465
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,452
Do you know what I'm saying?

466
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,759
No, what are you saying?

467
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,260
I'm not like you.

468
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,826
I'm an intellectual.

469
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:20,563
So?

470
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,840
I believe it. Of all the rotten luck.

471
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,574
- You're kidding me, you do?
- Don't rub it in, Utah.

472
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,979
It's a miracle!

473
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,383
Have you gone
completely insane?

474
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,492
This is terrific!

475
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:44,695
What's wrong?

476
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:53,270
Nobody's going to understand this.
My parents will think I'm crazy.

477
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,194
Tell them to pray about it.

478
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,141
Okay, what got us into this whole mess.
I've been hoisted up on my own petard.

479
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,238
Oh, that can be painful.

480
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,280
I got hit in the petard
once playing baseball.

481
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,513
Oh, Sam.

482
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,091
What have we done to each other?

483
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:22,355
Charly, you're not doing this
because of my...

484
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,559
Personal charm and magnetism?

485
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,730
Something like that.

486
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,003
You are kinda cute...

487
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,239
...but no.

488
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,975
When I read that book...

489
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:40,775
...I feel something.

490
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,350
Want to know something else?

491
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,123
I'm praying...

492
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,856
...and someone is listening.

493
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,575
You're winning.

494
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,479
I'm cheating. But, don't tell your father.

495
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,451
It's how I subsidize my Social Security.

496
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:22,050
He's pretty worried about you,
they both are.

497
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,021
When you were a little girl...

498
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,362
...you said, "You wanted to run away
and join the circus," remember?

499
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,594
Your parents did everything.

500
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,171
They told you that midgets
were actually run-away children...

501
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:39,538
...and that they fed little girls to the lions,
but you didn't listen.

502
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,702
Do you remember what I did?

503
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,208
You took me to the circus.

504
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,044
And after you'd been there a while...

505
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:49,244
...you decided it wasn't what
you really wanted after all.

506
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,185
That's how I thought this
Mormon business would sort out.

507
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,493
But it hasn't worked out that way,
has it?

508
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,756
I may not agree
with all the Mormon ways...

509
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,457
...heaven knows if God's going to
put us through in this life...

510
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,398
...the least He could do is allow us
a few good stiff drinks along the way.

511
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,300
Just make sure you're doing things
for the right reason.

512
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,010
And if you feel it's right...

513
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,543
...then everyone else
can just go sit on a pin.

514
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,051
Thanks.

515
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,044
You're sure it's what you want?

516
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,148
It just feels right.

517
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,645
I have never felt like this.

518
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,414
I like this clean slate thing.

519
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,058
You believe it, right?

520
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,593
No.

521
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,268
I know it.

522
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,258
You have 24 messages.

523
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,505
Mark, Charly. We need to talk.
Please call.

524
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:57,307
This is Sandra. Got a question for you.
Call me at my studio.

525
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:02,012
Hi Mark, honey, this is your mother.
Haven't heard from you lately...

526
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:09,515
Mark, are you there? This is Edward.
It's about Charly. Something's changed.

527
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:15,055
Okay, maybe I wasn't completely
honest with you last time...

528
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,599
...but Mark,
Charly's seeing someone new.

529
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,533
Someone, though I never thought
I'd say it, worse than you.

530
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,798
I strongly suggest you get out here.

531
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,234
Mark, call your mother.

532
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,186
No, thanks.

533
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,565
Charly, is that you?

534
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,564
Felicia!

535
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,399
- What are you doing in Utah?
- Business.

536
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,071
But then I heard about your
grandmother's exhibit, I had to come.

537
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,211
What are you doing in Utah?

538
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,843
Well, I came out for a visit...

539
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,440
...but I'm thinking about
making it permanent.

540
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,984
Are you and Mark going to
keep your place in New York...

541
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,021
...or have you convinced him
to move out west?

542
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,522
Mark's in New York.

543
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,490
Felicia, I'd like you to meet Sam.

544
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,858
Sam, this is Felicia,
an old friend from school.

545
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,766
Hello, it's so nice to meet you, Sam.

546
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,574
I knew this lady
before she could color in the lines.

547
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,948
Well, I've got to go. It's been wonderful
to see you again, Charly.

548
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:18,749
Let's get together before I leave
you know, catch up on old times.

549
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,188
Charmed.

550
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,159
Hi, come on,
I've got something to show you.

551
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,227
You were living with someone?

552
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,831
I told you
I was practically engaged, Sam.

553
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,640
It never occurred to you
that he and I... That we?

554
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,546
Of course not. Why would it?

555
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,387
I'm not living with him now.

556
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:52,748
Does he know that?

557
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,753
Why, Sam. I think you're jealous.

558
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,724
Charly!

559
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,585
Mark? What are you doing...

560
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,230
Sam, this is my... Mark Randolph.

561
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,598
Mark, this is Sam Roberts, he's...

562
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,568
We fish together.

563
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,569
She's being modest, Sam.

564
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:17,340
Not too long ago she had me absolutely
convinced I couldn't live without her.

565
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,743
I almost had her convinced
as well.

566
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:21,776
There's always time, right?

567
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,049
Guess so.

568
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,514
So, Mark,
what brings you out this way?

569
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,588
You're the last person I thought
I'd see here tonight.

570
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,388
Obviously.

571
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,225
Mark had some pressing business
in town and needed a place to stay.

572
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,799
Naturally, we couldn't let him
stay in a hotel, dear.

573
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,059
Naturally.

574
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,066
And when he heard the exhibit
was opening tonight...

575
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,661
I insisted on coming down.

576
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,370
Frankly, Charly, I'm disappointed.

577
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,972
Usually these things are
so much more lively.

578
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:53,612
Well, Sam has introduced me
to a totally new way of looking at life.

579
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,919
That's what Ed and Claire
were telling me.

580
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,678
Well, you know Charlene,
always full of surprises.

581
00:40:58,989 --> 00:40:59,978
That's why I love her.

582
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,325
You just never
know what she's gonna do next.

583
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,822
Well, some things never change.
I can see you're busy.

584
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,796
Sam! Wait up. Don't go. Let's talk.

585
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,364
Sam! Wait up. Don't go. Let's talk.

586
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,170
- How could you do this to me?
- To you?

587
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,138
You're not who I thought you were.

588
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:24,304
Sam. I had a life before I met you, I did.

589
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,477
But it was different then
and I was different then.

590
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,416
Sam, look at me.

591
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,930
You introduced me
to a new way of life...

592
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,564
...but it's not going to mean much to me
unless you're a part of it...

593
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,710
...a permanent part.

594
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,708
Sam, I think I just told you I love you.

595
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,158
Sam, say something.

596
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,836
What do you want?

597
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,899
I don't know, not used merchandise.

598
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,974
Something on your mind, Mom?

599
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,143
Home early, aren't you?

600
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,679
Charly wasn't perfectly honest with me.

601
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,024
Turns out she has a past.

602
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,294
Most of us do.

603
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,520
You know what I mean.

604
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,058
She's not...

605
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:23,099
A virgin?

606
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,598
I just can't get it out of my head.

607
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,871
I can't stop thinking about her and...

608
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,100
She's just not who I thought I'd...

609
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,768
You'd fall in love with?

610
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,448
Seems like she's done a lot of changing
the past few weeks.

611
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,215
So have you.

612
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:44,048
- That's not the point.
- No?

613
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,954
No, I thought you'd understand.

614
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,788
Well, maybe she thought
you would, too.

615
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,592
What is this?
What about wait until you're married?

616
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,700
- Now you're saying it doesn't matter...
- It does matter...

617
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,131
...your whole life
we've taught you that...

618
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:02,171
...intimacy should be connected to
eternal commitment.

619
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,774
And you've waited to find someone
who felt the same way.

620
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,809
That's wonderful, it is, but...

621
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,411
Charly obviously doesn't believe in that.

622
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:13,142
Maybe she didn't or maybe she
understood it differently, but now...

623
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,215
No. It doesn't matter.

624
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,643
Nothing changes
the fact that she was unfaithful.

625
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:21,156
To who? To you?
Someone she just met?

626
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,885
To your principles?

627
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:27,089
Principles she didn't
understand or share until recently?

628
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,466
Does knowing about her past
change the way you feel about her?

629
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,175
Well then, she's better off
without you, isn't she.

630
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,817
I have never felt like this.

631
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,880
I like this clean slate thing.

632
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,588
You believe it, right?

633
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:18,266
"Earth's crammed with heaven and
every common bush afire with God"

634
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:24,476
"But only he who sees,
takes off his shoes"

635
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,412
I've been so blind.

636
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:35,758
Yes. Well, love's like that sometimes.

637
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:39,427
I've got to find her.

638
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,825
She won't be there.
She left right after you did...

639
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,094
...for New York.

640
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,368
Alone?

641
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,138
I know, Dad, I know, please.

642
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,340
I'll pay you back every penny,
I promise.

643
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,813
Just please do me this favor.

644
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:03,515
Thank you.

645
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,388
Can I help you?

646
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,987
I'm here to visit Charlene Riley.

647
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,660
Is she expecting you?

648
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:47,897
Um-ah.
Actually I wanted to surprise her.

649
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,328
Look sir, I'm sorry. You can't enter
unless she authorizes you to come in.

650
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,630
I'd be happy to ring her property
if you like.

651
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,331
Never mind.

652
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,598
I'm serious, Mark, drop it.

653
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,475
Come on. Be reasonable.

654
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,809
Be my guest.

655
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,924
Mark, I told you. I need some time,
now can you please just...

656
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,048
...go away.

657
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,625
What are you doing here?

658
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,425
My question exactly.

659
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:55,620
I owe you an apology.

660
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:56,856
- You sure do.
- Do you mind?

661
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,058
No, not at all.

662
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,370
Go home, Sam.

663
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,537
Go home?

664
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,334
I've come 2,000 miles
to see you.

665
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,806
Well, you've seen me.

666
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,507
I was wrong!

667
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,445
That's right. When all else fails, grovel.

668
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,784
You wrong? Impossible.

669
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,320
You were right.

670
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,383
I was jealous...

671
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,459
...thoughtless...
- Yeah.

672
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,388
Don't let me stop you.

673
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,759
I was wrong, and I'm sorry.

674
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,670
Good. Anything else?

675
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,672
No.

676
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,007
Yes.

677
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,111
I don't know.

678
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,681
Charly...

679
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,507
I've come all this way...

680
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:48,343
Why?

681
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,112
Why did you come?

682
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,954
It's a valid question.

683
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:53,678
To apologize...

684
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,792
You've done that.

685
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,588
A swing and a miss.

686
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,197
- Charly!
- Strike one!

687
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:05,694
Charly, Charly, please.

688
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,700
I love you, too.

689
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,380
Have a great trip back.

690
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,722
Keep a stiff upper lip, that's my boy.

691
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,697
Is there anything you want to tell me?

692
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,404
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

693
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,173
Mark, I told you. I need some time.

694
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,073
And apparently
a fair bit of space as well.

695
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,280
If this is about that baptism thing,
it doesn't matter.

696
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,183
It does matter. At least to me.

697
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,551
Well then, we'll work it out.
Come on, Charly.

698
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,417
You can't just kick me out without
giving me an explanation.

699
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,522
You owe me that much.

700
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:03,589
I'm not kicking you out.

701
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:09,591
Alright, maybe I am,
but it's not what you think.

702
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,763
Okay, maybe it is.

703
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,103
Please understand. I...

704
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,408
I know I am not being fair about this...

705
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,478
...but I've changed.

706
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:33,184
I don't want the same things
I wanted before.

707
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:38,188
You want him?
Is that what this is all about?

708
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,462
It's about shelling peas.

709
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,800
Kisses that mean something.
Lives that do too.

710
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,305
It's about being so sure about
one thing...

711
00:51:58,014 --> 00:51:59,982
...and everything else falls away.

712
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,313
What has fallen away?

713
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,426
Oh.

714
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,262
I see.

715
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,600
I'm sorry.

716
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,106
I'll send a car to pick up the rest.

717
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:28,433
Look, Charly, I don't know what
happened to you in Salt Lake.

718
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,372
But I'd like to.

719
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,180
Because my feelings for you
haven't changed.

720
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:36,750
I'll call later.

721
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,251
Back to school already?

722
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:47,049
Yep, back to the old grind.

723
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,406
Taxi!

724
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:18,751
Sam!

725
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,749
Charly...

726
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,119
I want you back.

727
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,821
I'm not upset with you anymore.

728
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,725
How nice for you.
We're in the middle of class, Sam.

729
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:33,963
I probably would have done the
same thing. Not with Mark, but...

730
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:36,639
Oh, sorry.

731
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,307
She's... she's...

732
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,147
Without clothing? Yes.

733
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:51,745
You were saying?

734
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,521
The main thing is I forgive you.

735
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,593
You forgive me?

736
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,493
No, of course not. I mean, yes...

737
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,130
No, that's not it at all.

738
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,091
I don't care about that anymore.

739
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,169
What's going on here?

740
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,444
Nosebleed.

741
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,215
Can we go someplace to talk?

742
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,175
Miss Riley?

743
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:22,851
- I have class.
- Later then?

744
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,153
- I can't.
- Why?

745
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,780
Miss Riley.

746
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,692
That's really none of your business.

747
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,028
Charly, wait.

748
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,893
I want to be a part of your life.

749
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,193
Maybe not this part, but...

750
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,036
Why?

751
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:46,372
Sam, you couldn't handle just one thing
from my life... my past life.

752
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:52,204
Life is too short and too hard to
not feel safe with the one you love.

753
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:58,020
You've given me something
I'll have forever.

754
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:00,179
I just can't have it with you.

755
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:01,720
Go home, Sam.

756
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,224
Mark-O.

757
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:11,701
Polo.

758
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:15,764
How did you get in?

759
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,907
I told Henry I forgot my key.

760
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,845
You said you wanted to talk.

761
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,583
There'll be plenty of
time to talk... later.

762
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,324
Remember St. Angelos?

763
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:40,827
Yah, didn't the health department
close that place down?

764
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:44,559
Horrible miscarriage of justice.
It was one late evening.

765
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:48,000
I'd come in for a dozen hot wings,
and there she was.

766
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:52,096
The most extraordinarily
gorgeous woman I'd ever seen...

767
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,377
...sitting in front of an
Angelo's Gargantuan.

768
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,741
Our eyes met. She winked.

769
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,109
I never winked.

770
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:03,615
Pardon me, Miss, this is my story.

771
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,214
She winked, invitingly.

772
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:09,958
I sat down beside her.

773
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:14,460
It was a big pizza.

774
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:16,923
Then her date arrived.

775
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,667
How inconvenient.

776
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,265
He thought they were getting it to go.

777
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,632
We decided to stay.

778
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,404
Poor fellow.
Cute, but predictable.

779
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,237
Maybe she likes predictable?

780
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:34,413
Not this girl.
She'd never paint by the numbers.

781
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,475
She might find someone special.

782
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,790
But she'd never settle.
Not for someone like him.

783
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,753
What if she changed?

784
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,329
She wouldn't. Not really.

785
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:50,491
How do you know?

786
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,561
Because I'm sitting
beside her right now...

787
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,540
...and it's as though she never left.

788
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,152
Hey, you can't be in here.

789
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:51,953
You'd better go.

790
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,829
I don't have to.

791
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,789
Yes, you do.

792
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,761
But tonight, I got the pizza...

793
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:02,735
Tonight was all about
how things used to be.

794
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,570
How they could be again.

795
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:07,910
Not for me.

796
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,746
Get away from her, you,
you New Yorker!

797
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,578
Wow, handsome and witty.

798
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,985
Sam, what are you doing?

799
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,180
You can't marry him.

800
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,322
I know.

801
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,492
You love me. You said so yourself.

802
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:24,691
Wait, you know?

803
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:25,861
Get out of here, buddy.

804
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,257
No, I won't leave.
Charly, I love you.

805
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:31,126
That particular argument doesn't
seem to be working tonight.

806
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:33,060
Is he supposed to be here?

807
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:33,928
No.

808
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:36,431
Hey! Wait!

809
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,268
All my life I've been waiting for
this woman of my dreams...

810
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,378
...and suddenly I find myself
in love with you.

811
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,002
Have you ever had the
wrong dreams?

812
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,614
- What?
- The wrong dreams.

813
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,613
I had the wrong dreams.

814
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,785
- Charly!
- Sorry about that.

815
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,358
Wow.

816
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:58,928
Where were we?

817
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:01,630
I remember.

818
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,138
Goodbye.

819
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:13,942
I am so sorry.

820
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:21,647
Don't be. We had fun
while it lasted, didn't we?

821
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,665
Luckily, the judge was
sympathetic to my plight.

822
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,963
She promised to forget the whole thing
if I left the city immediately.

823
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:45,336
Next time she suggested I send
a nice note with a bouquet of roses.

824
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,233
I had what I thought was... Well...

825
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,605
...a far better idea.

826
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,258
I'm so sorry.

827
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:16,765
You should be.

828
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:19,501
I know.

829
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,904
I've been discussing
the whole thing with God.

830
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,404
We're very close now, He and I.

831
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,709
Oh, really?

832
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,936
I said, "Father, Sam's being a jerk."

833
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,446
And?

834
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,210
He agreed with me, of course.

835
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,351
Of course.

836
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:45,287
I told him how you'd broken my heart.
He understood about that.

837
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,724
"But," I said...

838
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,067
..."I still love him."

839
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:54,870
What did He say?

840
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,806
He said I was probably
a glutton for punishment.

841
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:00,542
But I suppose I've always known that.

842
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,639
I love you.

843
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:09,451
You'd better.

844
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:13,955
Think you can put up with me?

845
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,483
Maybe just...

846
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:19,328
...forever.

847
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,485
Mama. Ma ma.

848
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:19,883
Come on, you can say it.
Ma ma.

849
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,290
Da da.

850
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:24,521
That's my little man.

851
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:29,355
Not Da da. Ma ma.
Come on, who feeds you?

852
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:33,298
Who changes all the really
nasty diapers? Mama.

853
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:34,428
Da da.

854
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,241
That's it, Sam.
You've corrupted our child.

855
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:51,987
Voíla.

856
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:04,399
What's this?

857
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:05,934
A commission.

858
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:10,261
It's going to be a painting of Christ,
but I can't get the face right.

859
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:13,274
You should give him a smile
or something-he looks depressed.

860
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,441
He's supposed to look depressed.
His friend just died.

861
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:20,111
Lazarus.
Mary and Martha's brother, Lazarus.

862
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,887
Before he raised him from the dead,
Christ wept.

863
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,619
It's not my fault.
If I had a studio...

864
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,593
I need my office, Charles.

865
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,886
Yeah, well, I'd be willing to share.

866
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:38,625
Besides, if I had a proper studio,
I'd have more kitchen space...

867
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:44,729
...to whip up culinary masterpieces the
likes of which you only glimpsed tonight.

868
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,501
You didn't like it?

869
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:48,710
It was good.

870
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:49,708
Good?

871
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:52,139
- Very creative.
- Creative?

872
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:56,382
Ouch.

873
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,246
What's wrong. You okay?

874
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,285
Yeah.

875
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:03,087
Sore muscle. Just tired, I guess.

876
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:05,293
You've been tired a lot lately.

877
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,759
Pardon me, Mr. Roberts,
but have you met your son?

878
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,865
Short little guy, crawls around a lot?

879
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,660
- Oh, is that who that is?
- That's who that is.

880
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,171
I know exactly what you need.

881
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,267
A night out on the town... or...

882
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:21,143
...at least...

883
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:24,012
...a night out on the kitchen floor.

884
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:27,104
Lovely.

885
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,184
We spare no expense.

886
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:37,857
I've got a thing for the way
You see through me

887
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:45,031
Your eyes, how they sparkle
Makes the blue sky seem gloomy

888
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:52,203
I got a thing
A spectacular thing

889
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:58,711
Yes, I've got a thing for you

890
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:02,376
You are just trying to
get out of doing the dishes.

891
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:03,719
Is it working?

892
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,723
Keep dancing and you might get lucky.

893
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,706
Today's lesson is on
home and family relations.

894
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:30,367
What are things you do with your
husbands to keep you closer together?

895
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,344
Rick and I enjoy gardening together.

896
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,256
What else?

897
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,785
Russ and I like taking walks together.

898
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:48,861
What a great way to lose
those few extra pounds.

899
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:52,901
What else?

900
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,204
Well, Sam and I like to make love.

901
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,150
Bishop.

902
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,125
Da da.

903
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:18,793
Why does he always do that?

904
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,456
Ma ma. Ma ma.

905
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,029
Dada. Dada.

906
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:30,831
Da da.

907
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,817
You can't leave me. Not now.

908
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,118
Okay.

909
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,992
O W... Out of my way.

910
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,666
I've had enough of you and
your motorcycle gang.

911
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,968
But Bob, what about the baby?

912
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,270
Probably not even mine.

913
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,664
For all I know, could be Freddy's...

914
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:09,003
...that goofy-eyed dweeb
on checkstand 7.

915
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,337
I admit at one time I did find
Freddy irresistible...

916
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,244
...but that was just a fling.

917
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:18,112
In my heart I have always loved you.

918
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,855
Liar, I don't even believe you.

919
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,359
You've broken my heart
for the last time...

920
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,251
...Beulah!

921
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:28,864
We're through.

922
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:32,265
How can you say such a thing
when I stuck with you through the...

923
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,961
...stock market crash and the
in-grown toenails and that...

924
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,866
...highly contagious
case of swine fever?

925
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,533
You laughed. You laughed.

926
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:42,744
You laughed first.

927
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,846
- It was a cough.
- You so laughed first.

928
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,179
Nasty stuff, swine fever.

929
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,879
Nice try, Bob. You lose.
Diaper duty for a week.

930
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,721
This is no sore muscle.

931
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:00,954
Of course it is.

932
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:05,400
Okay, you might be right.
Just this once.

933
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:07,395
Just stay still.

934
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:16,075
Mr. Roberts, your wife has cancer.

935
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,237
Mr. Roberts?

936
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,377
Go on, I'm listening.

937
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,151
The tumor started in the Pancreas.

938
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:30,417
That's probably why it went
undetected until now.

939
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,962
I'm afraid the cancer has spread.

940
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,926
So are we talking surgery, radiation?

941
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,267
I'm afraid surgery is out of the question.

942
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,872
We can try aggressive chemotherapy,
if you wish, but...

943
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,474
Let's do it. Let's get started.

944
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,342
I need to be perfectly
honest with you.

945
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:52,309
Chemotherapy is rarely effective
in a case like this.

946
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:56,214
Even if your wife responds
favorably to the treatment...

947
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:59,185
...the best we could hope for
is to shrink the tumor...

948
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:02,950
...slightly prolonging
what little time she has left.

949
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,223
Time she has left?

950
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:10,928
Mr. Roberts, your wife is dying.

951
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,298
I'm truly sorry.

952
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,797
It's out of our hands.
There's nothing we can do.

953
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:22,143
How are you?

954
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,347
I hope I look better than you do.

955
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,975
I hate to break this to you,
but I have severe halitosis...

956
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,387
...and a really nasty case of
terminal cancer.

957
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,729
There. I said it.

958
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,658
There are treatments.

959
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:47,459
- I've talked to the doctors.
- Doctors don't know everything.

960
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,997
People beat this thing all the time.

961
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:52,340
Hey.

962
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:59,670
I will give you a blessing and
God will do the rest. You'll see.

963
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,154
Charly...

964
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,365
...your Father in Heaven...

965
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,696
...is aware of your struggle.

966
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:23,938
He wants...

967
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,605
I want to bless you...

968
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,989
I bless you that...

969
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,222
...through your faith and obedience...

970
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,828
...and the faith and obedience
of your family...

971
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:51,393
...that you will live.

972
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,731
The treatments will work...

973
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:58,736
...and you won't die.

974
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:06,043
Heavenly Father loves you.

975
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,617
He loves me and Adam.

976
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,088
I love you.

977
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:20,525
I bless you, Charly,
I bless you to live.

978
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:30,605
What are you doing?

979
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:33,608
Thinking.

980
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,050
Have you noticed he has
a cowlick back here?

981
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:46,286
No matter what I do,
it always sticks straight up.

982
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:56,096
I wonder what it will look like
in a year when it grows out.

983
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,091
We'll just have to wait and see.

984
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:03,768
At one year, survival rates for
my type of cancer are zero, Sam.

985
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:04,870
Zero.

986
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:06,301
So we'll beat the odds.

987
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,135
Pretty stiff odds.

988
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,107
We have Heavenly Father on our side.
You heard the blessing.

989
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:16,279
And blessings come from God?

990
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,216
Yes.

991
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,054
Always?

992
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,250
What are you saying?

993
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:26,227
Sometimes when we want
something bad enough...

994
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:29,056
I did what I felt was right.
What do you want?

995
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,164
You want to give up,
is that what you're saying?

996
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:36,766
I don't want to give up. I don't want to
give up what time I have left.

997
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:42,503
I want to be here
with you and with Adam...

998
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,608
...not tethered to some I.V. pole,
dying in a hospital room.

999
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,181
I would never let that happen.

1000
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,143
If what the doctors say is true...

1001
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,254
It's not.

1002
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,692
Everything inside me tells me it is.

1003
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:02,295
The Lord will come through
for us, Charly.

1004
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,365
We just have to have faith
and give Him a chance.

1005
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,667
Barring some huge miracle...

1006
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:10,839
Exactly.

1007
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,941
You honestly believe
the treatments will work.

1008
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:15,736
Yes.

1009
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,114
All right.

1010
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:25,714
He said they'd check my progress
after the first series of treatments.

1011
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:29,879
If it's working, we'll continue.
If not...

1012
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,226
They'll work.

1013
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,063
I know it.

1014
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,230
I hope so, too.

1015
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,670
- So do you have any children?
- A little boy.

1016
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:48,105
- How old is he?
- 10 months.

1017
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,011
It's nice.

1018
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,067
Almost done.

1019
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:33,621
It's gonna be good.

1020
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:11,984
I see your rice pudding and
raise you an orange jello delight.

1021
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:14,829
Call.

1022
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:18,999
Read 'em and eat.

1023
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:20,168
You're cheating.

1024
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,436
Prove it.

1025
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:27,067
You keep losing like this, the doctors
will have to put you on a diet.

1026
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:32,706
That boy loves you.

1027
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:34,849
I know.

1028
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:37,944
I can't reach him.

1029
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:41,280
It's like I'm already dead.

1030
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,617
No, that's what he's trying to prevent,
dear, in the only way he knows how.

1031
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,022
Ignore it, and maybe it will go away.

1032
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,632
That makes no sense.

1033
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,091
It's always worked with your father.

1034
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:59,465
It's not you. Not really.

1035
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:03,369
He's frightened, and he's running.

1036
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:04,971
Can you blame him?

1037
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:09,272
If he stops, all this might catch up
with him, and then what?

1038
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:17,815
Come on. Eat up.
I've got a lot riding on the main course.

1039
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:35,800
What's all this?

1040
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:42,409
It's your studio. I decided
you could use it more than I could.

1041
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:45,347
What do you think? I think we could...

1042
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:48,182
I never told you why I first
fell in love with you, did I?

1043
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:55,290
You have a lifetime to show me.

1044
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:58,930
No, I don't.

1045
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:00,368
Knock it off.

1046
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:05,332
Who's going to use this thing
once you finish it?

1047
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:08,235
The paint's got a longer
guarantee than I do.

1048
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:12,444
You don't know that.
We've lived good lives.

1049
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,540
We've been faithful.
God will keep his promises.

1050
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:22,589
God never promised us
he'd cure my cancer.

1051
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:25,993
He promised us we could be
together forever...

1052
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,458
...even after death.

1053
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,859
Dying is still part of the deal.

1054
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,110
Sam...

1055
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:44,545
Sam...

1056
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:50,146
I am going to die.

1057
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:51,649
You don't know that.

1058
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:56,954
I knew it the night of the blessing.
So did you.

1059
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,127
Why are you giving up? Why?

1060
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:00,987
You can't give up!

1061
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:10,431
He says he's a God of miracles!

1062
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,733
Why not now?
I've done my part!

1063
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:19,010
All I want is one lousy little miracle!

1064
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:30,124
Is it too much to ask?

1065
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:50,870
It's not the end. Not really.

1066
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:53,711
You taught me that.

1067
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:58,207
Who needs more time?
We've got eternity.

1068
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:00,280
What if I was wrong?

1069
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:04,358
What if there's nothing more
after this and...

1070
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:07,159
...and it's just a lie...

1071
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,557
It doesn't feel like a lie.

1072
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,502
Neither did tomorrow, until yesterday.

1073
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:17,865
So ask.

1074
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:21,809
"Hey God, You up there?"

1075
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:27,741
Something like that.

1076
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,409
That was it.

1077
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,085
What?

1078
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:40,750
In a world full of people
afraid to believe in anything...

1079
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:45,992
...it was your wide-eyed, obstinate,
happily-ever-after faith...

1080
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:50,037
...in life, in God...

1081
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:57,879
...and in me.

1082
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:06,744
It's gotten us this far, don't you
dare back out on me now.

1083
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:12,459
I can't do this.

1084
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,631
No, but we can.

1085
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,201
With His help, we can.

1086
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:36,977
I'd always taken solace in the idea
that God was in control...

1087
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:39,983
...that he would make things right.

1088
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:41,252
Mommy...

1089
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:42,390
But now...

1090
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,650
Mommy. Can you please say it.

1091
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:51,662
Mommy, Adam, Mommy.
Can you say my name, baby?

1092
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:58,068
Adam, I'm your mommy.
Please remember me.

1093
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:07,608
But now... Now things were
so terribly wrong.

1094
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,185
Did I know Him well enough to
trust Him now?

1095
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,688
To trust Him with her?

1096
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,653
You look like you could use a drink.

1097
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,237
How's it going?

1098
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:13,742
I've prayed, I've pleaded,
I've promised...

1099
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:15,916
...but...

1100
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:18,578
The treatments?

1101
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:25,089
Christ heals the sick left and right...

1102
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:28,422
...raises people from the dead
without breaking a sweat...

1103
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,400
...but he runs up against
one tiny little tumor.

1104
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:35,602
11 centimeters.

1105
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,167
11 centimeters.

1106
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:43,774
The distance between
life and death and...

1107
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:45,846
...nothing.

1108
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:48,115
How's Charly?

1109
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:52,444
Charly? Charly's given up
just like the rest of you.

1110
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:54,121
Sam.

1111
01:24:56,858 --> 01:25:01,818
I keep thinking maybe it's me.
Maybe if I exercised more faith, or...

1112
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:06,631
...maybe it's a test.
Maybe if I had more time...

1113
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,292
Maybe not.

1114
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:09,537
No.

1115
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,803
I know God can do this. I know it.

1116
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:17,638
Sam, you've got to face the fact
that your faith may not fix this.

1117
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:20,006
Then what's it good for? What?

1118
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:24,473
Why have faith if it's only good
for bible stories and fairy tales...

1119
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:26,821
...filling sacrament meeting talks.

1120
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,924
- Then when it really counts...
- When it really counts...

1121
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:31,355
...it won't abandon you.

1122
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,153
The pain may block
everything else for awhile...

1123
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:40,825
...but slowly, slowly the stab
will dull to an ache...

1124
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:44,829
...and if you have faith
in all those answers...

1125
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,567
...you've been carrying around
for a lifetime...

1126
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:49,844
...well...

1127
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:54,844
...then the pain won't
give way to emptiness.

1128
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:57,684
And neither will you.

1129
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:00,678
Neither will you.

1130
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:23,611
Charly!

1131
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:28,616
What is this?

1132
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:29,884
Hi.

1133
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:33,380
It's a party. Come on!

1134
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:35,446
Who are all these people?

1135
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:39,048
Just a few friends. Loosen up, Utah.

1136
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:46,890
Charly used the term friend loosely to
describe everyone she'd ever met.

1137
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:49,562
There was her doctor...

1138
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:54,734
...a boy who carried her groceries
out to the car each week...

1139
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,874
...the policeman who ticketed her
for speeding...

1140
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:01,074
...a minister from another faith...

1141
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:04,242
...who had stopped by one day
to invite us to her services...

1142
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:07,483
...and our neighbors...

1143
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:11,581
...with the word neighbor defined as
anyone living on the road we lived on.

1144
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,524
As I looked at her that night...

1145
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:21,598
...I could almost believe
it would last forever.

1146
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:26,997
I wanted to etch every moment,
every movement into memory.

1147
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:31,045
But it seemed like she just
kept slipping away.

1148
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,212
And I couldn't shake the fear that
I might never see her again.

1149
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:42,289
Charly?

1150
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:50,631
Charly.

1151
01:27:57,171 --> 01:27:58,035
What's wrong?

1152
01:27:58,172 --> 01:27:59,230
I want my baby.

1153
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:01,842
- Are you okay?
- I want my baby.

1154
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,101
Come on.

1155
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:48,422
Please help me.

1156
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:55,691
Please. I'm so scared.

1157
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,193
I'm so sorry.

1158
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:25,392
Sam.

1159
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:31,131
Sam.

1160
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:39,866
Call my Mom.

1161
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:45,745
I want to go out.

1162
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:52,952
It can't wait.

1163
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:12,265
Say goodbye to Mama.

1164
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:15,806
Bye, baby.

1165
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:18,771
Say goodbye to Mama.

1166
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:20,079
Mamma...

1167
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:52,035
It's been a marvelous ride, hasn't it?

1168
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:54,274
The best.

1169
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:58,872
I don't want it to end.

1170
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:08,714
It won't.

1171
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:12,292
Glutton for punishment.

1172
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:18,628
I love you.

1173
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:21,835
You'd better.

1174
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:40,580
All this time I had hoped and
prayed for a miracle.

1175
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,917
Maybe I'd missed it.

1176
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:47,757
Maybe the real miracle
was all around me.

1177
01:32:50,131 --> 01:32:53,589
Perhaps the greatest miracle of all was
that I could let her go...

1178
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:55,668
...and never lose her.

1179
01:32:57,538 --> 01:33:02,840
Why? I don't know.
I don't think God explains why.

1180
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:07,775
Not because He isn't listening
or because he doesn't care...

1181
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:12,616
...but perhaps because the
reasons don't make sense...

1182
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,517
...not now, anyway.

1183
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:22,622
When Lazarus died, Christ didn't tell
his sisters everything would be alright.

1184
01:33:23,164 --> 01:33:24,290
It wasn't.

1185
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:28,297
Lazarus was dead,
and they were in pain.

1186
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:34,800
Christ knew Lazarus would live,
but he did not belittle his friends' grief.

1187
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:40,143
He didn't try to explain it away.

1188
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:45,285
He didn't try to dry their tears.

1189
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:50,322
He wept with them.

1190
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:57,156
He loved them.

1191
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,762
It's in that love I trust now.

1192
01:36:18,973 --> 01:36:23,273
The ride is not over yet, Utah.
I'll save your place in line.

1193
01:36:23,844 --> 01:36:24,970
I love you.

1194
01:36:44,698 --> 01:36:47,826
Mr. Raferty, I'd like you to
meet my fiancé.

1195
01:36:47,968 --> 01:36:50,937
He's just proposed and
you're the first one we've told.

1196
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:55,164
Sam and I want to ride your Ferris wheel
for a long time, understand?

1197
01:36:55,543 --> 01:36:57,670
A long, long time.

1198
