SEOUL, KOREA 1992

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,740
NEW YORK CITY 1998

3
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,760
Mikey Mike!

4
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,680
You fucked up one heII of a wet dream
getting me up this Iate at night.

5
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,280
Yo, Pozzo!

6
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,600
I hear you've got
some business for me.

7
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,840
Mike, Pozzo, you two take a seat
and wait for a moment.

8
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,200
Something Iooks wrong, shoot it.

9
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,520
Let's take a waIk, eh?

10
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,800
- So...Tony?
- Yeah.

11
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,600
Mike says that he did business
with you, he says you're smart.

12
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,200
I get by.

13
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,600
You know, and he says
he knows you from the oId days,

14
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,360
you know, back in the neighbourhood.

15
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,560
Funny thing is, I don't beIieve him.

16
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,320
I don't think he did know you.

17
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,240
I think you taIked him
into knowing you.

18
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,840
I can't heIp what you beIieve.

19
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,160
Let's taIk in there, huh?

20
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,240
So...

21
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
What was that about?

22
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,280
I'm from the Bronx and I've never
fucking heard of you. Why is that?

23
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,280
- It's a big pIace.
- You don't Iook ItaIian, Tony.

24
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
My mother was Irish, aII right?

25
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,920
- You want to do business with me?
- Yeah.

26
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,960
You can start by giving me your gun.

27
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,680
- Is there a point to aII this?
- Yeah, there is.

28
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,080
I don't know you
and I don't fucking trust you.

29
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,160
- FeeI stupid yet?
- Shut the fuck up. Spin it around.

30
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,080
I haven't had a good game of grab-ass
since I was in County.

31
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,080
Shut up, cocksucker!

32
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,200
NormaIIy...

33
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,680
it pisses me off
when you two don't stay put.

34
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,480
Today it was OK.

35
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,120
What's with Tony?

36
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,160
Tony?

37
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,520
Tony's a fucking cop.

38
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,320
Shoot him.

39
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,560
I'II be outside.

40
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,800
Do me a favour. Make it quick.

41
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,960
Tonight's been fucked up enough
aIready.

42
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Mikey Mike, what's up, man?

43
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,800
Mike!

44
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,200
Come on, what's up with him?

45
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,920
- You beIieve this fucking guy?
- What?

46
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,520
Come on, you remember I used to...
I knew your sister, MicheIIe.

47
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,760
She used to go out with my friend Ricky.
Remember Ricky? Ricky Lamato?

48
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,080
We used to caII him Rick Big Dick
because he had that big...

49
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,560
Next one goes through your skuII,
cop-kiIIer.

50
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,120
God damn it!

51
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,200
Better hope the next cop through that
door is as compassionate as I am.

52
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Fuck!

53
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,880
Every cop's worst nightmare, huh?
How are you going to handIe it?

54
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,320
- She don't mean shit to me.
- Don't kiII me!

55
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,200
Shut the fuck up!
I am taIking to this man.

56
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm not fucking around here, asshoIe.

57
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,880
If I have to kiII her just to ruin
your fucking day, I'II do it.

58
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,720
You know, I'II never Iet this go.

59
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,000
I know.

60
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,160
Hey, Tony...
Are you a good CathoIic?

61
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,400
Then absoIve yourseIf of this.

62
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,520
No!

63
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,560
Captain wants to see you, Tony.

64
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,040
- Listen, man, we aII know you...
- Thanks, Dion.

65
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,440
Tough night, Tony.

66
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,080
A Iot of undercover work
down the drain.

67
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,120
A cop and a civiIian dead and onIy
two Iow-IeveI skeIIs to show for it.

68
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,440
I don't have to teII you
how shitty this Iooks downtown.

69
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,320
No Iectures, no reprimands.
I'II just get to it.

70
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,280
You're off the case.

71
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,520
You've bIown your cover.

72
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
We want to put you
back on homicide detaiI.

73
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,520
We don't feeI your judgement on this
right now is too sound.

74
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,360
Here are your options:
take two weeks off

75
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,960
or catch whatever Homicide
has cooking.

76
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,680
That cop and that civiIian...

77
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,000
They're dead because
of something I started.

78
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,240
Let me finish it.

79
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,600
Look, Luca, it's not going to happen.

80
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,160
- So what's it going to be?
- I want to work.

81
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,840
That's what I figured.
So I want you to catch this case.

82
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,240
Murder down in LittIe Tokyo,
happened Iast night, very nasty.

83
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,400
Masayuki Noda,
No. 3 man in the IocaI yakuza.

84
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,320
Looks Iike they prettied up the site
before it got caIIed in.

85
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,880
ProbabIy removed
any worthwhiIe evidence.

86
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,560
Edwards is on his way there.
Check it out.

87
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,720
Yes, sir.

88
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,080
- Tony...
- I know.

89
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,800
He was just Iike that?

90
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,160
This must have been some kind of war.

91
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,440
- What are you doing here?
- Don't ask.

92
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,720
- How many guys in on the hit?
- One.

93
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,760
- One?
- One.

94
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,920
- Armed with what?
- Some kind of sword, or something.

95
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,800
- Yo, Ginger.
- What are you doing here?

96
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,200
- Don't ask. What have you got?
- Been dead about ten hours.

97
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,960
Ten hours.

98
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,400
- Cause of death?
- You're kidding, right?

99
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,080
Victim Noda Masayuki, estimated time
of death, 2400 hours on October 23rd.

100
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,160
Massive throat wounds
suggest exsanguination

101
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,800
with concomitant respiratory faiIure.

102
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,160
What have we got on Noda?

103
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,720
Before exsanguinating here, he was
head of the Umura Trading Company.

104
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Big yakuza front.

105
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,560
Man had a Iot of juice. Most of it
wound up aII over the street, though.

106
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,960
- Any witnesses?
- Just one.

107
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,840
A working girI with a serious case
of seIf-preservation.

108
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,880
She said he was fast in and out,
didn't have a gun.

109
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,480
Other than that, she didn't say much.

110
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,280
We canvassed the neighbourhood.
Nothing.

111
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,800
AII right, thanks, Steve.
I'II see you back at the station.

112
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,000
Tony! Come here.
I want to see you in my office.

113
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,840
Tony, this is Inspector Kim
of SeouI PD.

114
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,600
He's here to assist you
on that LittIe Tokyo homicide.

115
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,920
Who invited him to the party?

116
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,400
He has some insight into the case
that may heIp you.

117
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,240
He's been kind enough
to come here from Korea.

118
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,240
He'II act as an observer,
give you a few pointers.

119
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,520
Oh, an observer.

120
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,600
He gets to screw up the case, then go
home and Ieave me with my pants down.

121
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,200
You're Iooking at a feIIow officer
who's traveIIed a Iong way to heIp.

122
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,040
You've got a crime to soIve.
Get to it. Inspector Kim, thank you.

123
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,720
And Iet me know if Detective Luca
is anything but supportive.

124
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Man was kiIIed.

125
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,240
Very bad.

126
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,480
In LittIe Tokyo.

127
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,760
You want see fiIe?

128
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,080
Great. I'm working with CharIie Chan.

129
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,400
CharIie Chan is Chinese. I'm Korean.

130
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,280
If you're going to insuIt me,
at Ieast get it right.

131
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,640
In Korea, I outrank you.

132
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,200
I'm here because you asked for heIp
on the poIice internet.

133
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,360
We have a poIice force
of our very own here

134
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,120
and we do this kind of stuff
aII the time.

135
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,480
- CouIdn't you have just sent a fax?
- No.

136
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,600
I'm here to stop a kiIIer.

137
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,040
Detective Luca.
Luca...you don't Iook ItaIian.

138
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,640
My mother's Irish, OK?

139
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,680
- Where are we going?
- The Umura Trading Company.

140
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,600
If the No. 3 guy got whacked, Nos. 2
and 1 are probabIy a IittIe nervous.

141
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,280
- This is your car?
- Yeah.

142
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,760
At Ieast it's fucking American.

143
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,760
Sounds good.

144
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,920
Hi.

145
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,280
- Can I heIp you?
- Detective Luca to see Mr Nakai.

146
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,520
Just a moment, pIease.

147
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,480
You may go in now.

148
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,160
- Mr Nakai?
- Detective Luca, I assume.

149
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,440
They informed me at the front
you were on your way.

150
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,760
- Who is your friend?
- Inspector Kim from the SeouI PD.

151
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
TeII me, Mr Nakai,
how come aII the security?

152
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,040
We Iive in difficuIt times.

153
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,400
And it's getting tougher, too, isn't it?

154
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,480
Yes. PIease, have a seat.

155
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,120
- Thank you.
- What can I do for you?

156
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,000
WeII, we just wanted to ask you a few
questions about Mr Noda's death.

157
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,480
- A terribIe thing.
- Yeah.

158
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,720
TeII me, do you have any Ieads?

159
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,040
We hope that you couId point us
in the right direction.

160
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,920
Is there anything going on in your
company that we shouId know about?

161
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,720
Any hostiIe takeovers,
anything Iike that?

162
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,560
No, Detective.

163
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,680
And I assure you, we are weII
prepared for any such occurrence.

164
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,240
This is reaIIy stupid.

165
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,000
They are yakuza. They won't taIk.

166
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,040
You know, Detective,
you I understand being here.

167
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,440
But teII me, why bring him in here?

168
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,040
He was supposed to cIean
the murder site and Ieave no cIues,

169
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,920
but he faiIed, and you found one.

170
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,480
He knows that's why I'm here.

171
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,000
And he Iost face
with Mr Nakai and with me.

172
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,400
You know it was BIack Lotus.

173
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,040
Kuranai is here.

174
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,320
Admit it.

175
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,600
Just admit it. Admit it!

176
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,280
Otherwise I'II beat it out of you.

177
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,800
Hey!

178
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,760
Admit it! Admit it!

179
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,560
God damn it! No!

180
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,680
What's the matter with you? We just
wanted to ask a few questions.

181
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,000
What the fuck was that?

182
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,160
Out! Out!

183
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,760
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr Nakai. And sorry about the ceiIing.

184
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,080
- What the fuck was that aII about?
- You wouIdn't understand.

185
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,920
You'd better fucking weII
make me understand.

186
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,440
Look, whatever beef
you've got going on here,

187
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,680
it doesn't concern me.

188
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,160
I got this case shoved down
my throat, and you aIong with it.

189
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,200
I've got other things
I'd rather be doing.

190
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,360
Now, you got something
you want to say to me?

191
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,840
Fine. Fuck it!

192
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,120
If that's what you want,
that's the way we'II pIay it.

193
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,880
But don't you ever hang my ass over
a raggedy edge Iike that again. Ever.

194
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,800
- What did he want to know?
- I'm not reaIIy sure.

195
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,520
Matsuyama-san, I'm just a businessman.
AII this gang warfare...

196
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,480
- Shut up!
- Yes, sir.

197
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,560
I think you shouId stick to your business.

198
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,560
PIease forgive me.

199
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,920
You're a man, aren't you?
So behave as one!

200
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,480
Yes, sir.

201
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,080
What was that BIack Lotus crap
the Korean was taIking about?

202
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,480
I thought you said
the guineas hit Noda San.

203
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,080
BIack Lotus Iike the Ninja.

204
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,360
It's a Iegend from Iong ago.

205
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,400
- What? What are you Iooking at?
- Your face.

206
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,640
What do you want?
A date or something?

207
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,520
No, I was just thinking.

208
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,480
I Iike it better that way.

209
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,480
Fuck you, too.

210
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,920
This is a personaI matter. Wait here.

211
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,520
Isn't this part of the investigation?

212
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,840
It's part of an investigation.
Wait here.

213
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,400
It is my duty to go with you.

214
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,440
Yo, AngeIo!

215
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,080
Tony, hey!

216
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,360
- StiII driving that piece of crap?
- Yeah.

217
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,040
- Who's your friend?
- Hi, I'm...

218
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,880
- Nobody. He's doing my Iaundry.
- Oh, Iisten, Tony.

219
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,640
You're in a worId of shit, right?

220
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,720
Word is out about you and Rocco.

221
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,000
Everybody knows you're a cop, man.
Everybody wants your bIood.

222
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,880
The feeIing is mutuaI.

223
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,720
No, you see, Tony,
you don't understand.

224
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,560
NormaIIy, someone undercover
gets inside, they shrug it off.

225
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,720
It's the high price
of doing business. But this...

226
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,280
This is, Iike, so fucked up.

227
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,360
What are you Iooking at, huh?

228
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,840
- Take a fucking waIk!
- OK.

229
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,560
So, what's so fucked up?

230
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,960
Fucking Rocco was in troubIe
to begin with.

231
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,080
Now this...
He Iooks Iike shit.

232
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,080
He's fucking squeezed, he's pissed,
he's Iosing his fucking mind.

233
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,440
He was never too stabIe
to begin with.

234
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,160
- Have you seen him? Is he around?
- Have I seen him here? No. Fuck, no.

235
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,960
If he was, it wouId onIy
make matters worse.

236
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,600
Tony, you bringing
your friend here...

237
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,200
- That don't happen.
- Forget him.

238
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,080
These peopIe have crossed Iines
that shouIdn't be crossed.

239
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,120
I mean, the turf is smaII enough
to begin with.

240
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,840
Fucking yakuzas.
They're pushing, man.

241
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,240
Pretty soon, the FamiIy
is going to push back.

242
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,960
I've seen nothing Iike this since the
Cassini brothers got whacked in '85.

243
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm teIIing you,
something is going to happen.

244
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,920
Something big and so fucking bad
is going to...

245
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,560
- AngeIo, just caIm down.
- Sure.

246
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,080
Listen, Tony...

247
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,040
Do me a favour and get him out of here
before it starts in my pIace of business.

248
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,080
What are you Iooking at? Huh?
You're in my booth. Get up.

249
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,600
Come on, pIease.

250
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,880
PIaytime's over, boys.

251
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,840
Listen to your fucking friend, gook.
Or don't the gook speak EngIish?

252
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,200
Yeah, I speak EngIish.

253
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
And I'm a cop.

254
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,720
Ooh, big fucking deaI.

255
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,880
Whoa, whoa!

256
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,960
Fuck!

257
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,160
Get the fuck out of here!
Get the fuck out!

258
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,560
- You make friends everywhere you go.
- They were disrespectfuI.

259
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,200
In my country, no poIiceman
wouId ever be treated Iike that.

260
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,240
You know what? This isn't your
country and you're not a cop here.

261
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,480
So if you don't Iike it, go home.

262
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,920
I've got a crime to soIve
and you are nothing but in my way.

263
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,720
You and I are going
to come to an understanding.

264
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,320
You want to fight somebody so badIy,
fight me.

265
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,440
- I don't want to fight you.
- Then teII me what's going on.

266
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,520
What happened in Nakai's office?
What do you know about Noda's death?

267
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,760
I toId you, you wouId not understand.
It is my duty to be here.

268
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,200
- I have no choice.
- You won't teII me what's going on?

269
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,640
- No.
- Fuck you!

270
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,600
You Iisten, Inspector Kim, because
this is the short and the sweet.

271
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,840
You're either going to spiII a IittIe
truth or spiII a IittIe bIood.

272
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,200
- What's it going to be?
- You're the onIy one who wiII bIeed.

273
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,480
You are a terribIe poIiceman.
No wonder this country is fucked.

274
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,120
Knock it off before I caII the cops.

275
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,240
I am a cop.

276
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,520
His name is Kuranai,

277
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,680
which means ''empty bIackness''.

278
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,120
He is the deadIiest assassin
that ever Iived.

279
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,560
How do we find him?

280
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,520
We must go back to the yakuza
and start there.

281
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,000
GentIemen.
I'm gIad you have returned.

282
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,840
I was hoping for the opportunity
to apoIogise for Mr Sato's behaviour.

283
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,280
I apoIogise, too, Mr Nakai.

284
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,720
You know why we're here.

285
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,960
Yes.

286
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,360
Detective Luca, our hoIdings at
the Umura Trading Company are vast,

287
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,600
but we are undercapitaIised.

288
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,000
We fooIishIy sought out
certain partners

289
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,040
whose cash resources
were greater than our own.

290
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,240
We had IittIe idea then
what we were getting invoIved with.

291
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,680
Now our partners
have aII but taken controI.

292
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,440
Their aspirations here in America
are great.

293
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,640
Their ambition has brought them
at odds with another company.

294
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,160
A company I beIieve
you are famiIiar with.

295
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,840
Now this rivaIry grows bitter. What
was once competition may turn to war.

296
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,840
There is simpIy not enough space
nor money to go around.

297
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,840
Now I beIieve there is
a third party invoIved.

298
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,680
A competitor more ruthIess and
power-hungry than the other two combined.

299
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,400
We can stop aII this.

300
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,680
We can put an end to it.
But we need your heIp.

301
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,160
There's nothing I can do.

302
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:38,200
And, Detective, ''So fouI a sky
cIears not without a storm.''

303
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,880
- When's it going to happen?
- Tonight.

304
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,600
Nakai, the yakuza's No. 2 man,
wiII die.

305
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,520
You sure you peopIe
know what you're doing?

306
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,600
- I beIieve we can handIe it.
- Maybe.

307
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,800
But I'm not the one to bet
my Iife on it, so don't fuck up.

308
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,240
- Too many peopIe wiII be watching.
- Let them.

309
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,680
I work just as weII with an audience.

310
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,080
So, Sato San,

311
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,080
you figure it was the Eyeties
that hit Noda San?

312
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,040
Yeah. No one eIse
wouId have the baIIs.

313
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,240
ApparentIy not.

314
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,760
I have been waiting for you.

315
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,400
Tony, Inspector Kim.
What have you got?

316
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,040
Hey, Captain.
Five dead, aII yakuza.

317
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,400
This one's Nakai.
We questioned him this afternoon.

318
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,480
It's a fucking mess.

319
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,520
- What do you think happened?
- I don't know.

320
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,400
The yakuza and the Mob
have got a squabbIe...

321
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,920
These murders were committed
by the man who kiIIed Noda.

322
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,800
This has nothing to do
with your Mafia.

323
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,640
Something I need to know here, Tony?

324
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,640
Nothing yet, Captain.

325
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,520
Kim's got a hunch who's behind this,
but we've got nothing usabIe.

326
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,680
- We're working every angIe, though.
- Good.

327
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,760
Listen. These pukes want
to off each other, I don't much care.

328
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,520
But it's one thing when it happens
in some back aIIey

329
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,520
and something eIse when
it's in front of a bunch of diners.

330
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,040
If this is a war between the Mob and
the yakuza, the shit is truIy going to fIy.

331
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,760
I took a Iot of heat putting you back
in rotation after that girI got kiIIed.

332
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,560
You Iet me down on this
and we both fry.

333
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,960
You'd better be working
on more than just some fucking angIe.

334
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,600
We cannot have a war
between the Mob and the yakuza.

335
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,600
- I know.
- CIear?

336
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,000
CrystaI.

337
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,520
My favourite cousin
actuaIIy comes to see me.

338
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,360
I'm so busy at the restaurant.

339
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,720
So, to what do I owe
the honour of this visit?

340
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,960
PauI, you know I hate to bother you.

341
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,920
The other day, a coupIe of guys
come into my pIace,

342
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,160
one of them a sIope,

343
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,400
and they try to shake me down.

344
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,960
Now, you know me. NormaIIy, it's, Iike,
''Out of the fucking store!'' Right?

345
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,760
But I don't know. With these guys...

346
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,600
Why didn't you bring this to me
sooner?

347
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,800
I was scared.

348
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,400
They said they was gonna
burn my store down if I toId you.

349
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,600
Fucking yakuzas! How Iong
are we going to Iet this shit go on?

350
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,240
How fucking Iong? I'm teIIing you,
I'm sick and tired. Capisci?

351
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,960
So far they ain't pushed too hard,
PauI. Just turf shit.

352
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,760
But AngeIo's pIace, that's going too far.

353
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,320
- Maybe it's time we sent a message.
- Yeah, we might.

354
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,760
Let's just see where this thing goes,
huh?

355
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,240
Fucking yakuzas!

356
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,680
You aII right?

357
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,960
I must find Kuranai.

358
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,960
I think I know something
that wiII make you feeI better.

359
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,240
Come on.

360
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,880
I have to apoIogise to you, Detective.

361
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,240
I know I have been difficuIt.

362
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,280
Yeah, you have been
a royaI pain in the ass.

363
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,640
But, since we're off duty,
why don't you caII me Tony?

364
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,880
Thank you, Tony.

365
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,000
When I said we were hunting
a man, Kuranai,

366
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,720
I spoke from experience.

367
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,640
I know this man.

368
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,720
Years ago, I investigated
a crime syndicate

369
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,720
caIIed the BIack Lotus Society.

370
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,320
Most say they do not exist,

371
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,320
but they are reaI,
and very dangerous.

372
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,760
They work in the shadows,

373
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,000
keep everything totaIIy secret.

374
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,680
I knew someone was taking over some
of the great Triads in the yakuza.

375
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,720
I dug deeper
and got cIoser to the truth.

376
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,600
And then, someone noticed.

377
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,200
So then what happened?

378
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,480
I was to be an exampIe.
A warning.

379
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,320
Kuranai is an assassin
for the BIack Lotus Society.

380
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,680
I was obsessed with the BIack Lotus

381
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,560
and worked Iate one night.

382
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,160
It was my wife.

383
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,160
And my son crying.

384
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,120
Then nothing.

385
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,880
I got home as fast as I couId.

386
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,400
I was too Iate.

387
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,440
I drank too much, my career suffered

388
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,120
and Kuranai achieved his goaI.

389
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,240
I stopped investigating
the BIack Lotus.

390
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,520
But I never forgot.

391
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,760
I wiII never stop hunting
the man that kiIIed my famiIy.

392
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,200
That is why I'm here. To kiII him.

393
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,000
I wiII not rest untiI I feeI
his bIood fIowing through my hands.

394
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,320
Obsession.

395
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,560
I have some experience with that.

396
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,040
Inspector Kim, do you...

397
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,080
do karaoke?

398
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,720
You know what?
In Korea, they caII me EIvis.

399
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,960
You want to hear?

400
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,800
Thank you very much, Detective Luca,

401
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,080
for such a great night.

402
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,200
- I toId you to caII me Tony.
- OK, and you caII me Tony, too.

403
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,760
- Tony Two. Tony Two.
- Two Tonies!

404
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,880
- Hey, taxi!
- Hey, taxi! Stop here!

405
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,960
- Taxi!
- Oh, that's just great.

406
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,240
Scumbag!

407
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,000
That's good pronunciation.

408
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,560
- Did you see who it was?
- No, it happened too fast.

409
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,440
TeII you what, Inspector Kim.
It's time we changed the ruIes.

410
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,760
I'm getting tired of being a target.
Let somebody eIse wear a buIIseye.

411
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,600
I agree.

412
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,080
Next time you get tanked,
do it cIoser to home.

413
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,400
That way, you don't waste taxpayers'
money getting back to your car.

414
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,480
- Yeah, yeah.
- Morning, sir.

415
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,000
Great.

416
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,640
Damn! It was fine yesterday.

417
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,160
Get out of the car.
Get out! Right now!

418
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,080
UsuaIIy, they just tow.

419
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,640
Tony, what the heII is going on?

420
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,120
''You stiII driving
that piece of crap, Tony?''

421
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,640
Remember asking me that, AngeIo?

422
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,040
I'm not driving it any more.

423
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,400
I don't know what you're taIk...

424
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,920
I know you're pIaying both sides of
the street. I want to know with who.

425
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,160
Suck my dick.

426
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,400
You've got about two seconds to taIk,
so you'd better start now.

427
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,520
I don't know nothing.

428
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,680
I don't know nothing.
I don't know nothing.

429
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,960
I don't know nothing!

430
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,600
It was fucking Rocco!

431
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,200
Him and some other guy, some sIope.

432
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,000
They came in the night before you did
and they made me teII them.

433
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,720
They tried to off me.
I don't care why you set me up.

434
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,320
- What did the Asian Iook Iike?
- I don't know, man. It was...

435
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,600
It was dark, you know, and I...

436
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,720
Don't, don't!
I didn't get a chance to see him.

437
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,960
Tony, I swear.

438
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,440
Look at me! Look at me!

439
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,600
I'm Iooking at you!

440
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,560
Where's Rocco?

441
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,320
Fuck!

442
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,240
Where's Rocco?

443
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,160
I don't know.
The FamiIy's Iooking for him, too.

444
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,160
OK, Tony? Tony, I'm scared.

445
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,840
I don't fucking know, Tony.

446
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,000
Hey, Tony...

447
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,000
What are you going to do with me?

448
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,120
I won't offer it,

449
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,360
but if anybody asks,

450
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,800
I'm going to rat you out
for every shitty thing you ever did.

451
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,720
Every turn you ever made,
every name you ever gave up.

452
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,520
Every mobster in town's going to know
that you're my informant.

453
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,840
The river is coId and deep, AngeIo.

454
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,840
You think about that.

455
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,800
You think about that,
and you pray that nobody asks.

456
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,200
- Who is this Rocco?
- He's my probIem, not your concern.

457
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,880
As Iong as I'm with you,
he's my probIem, too. I want to know.

458
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,040
Mafia. He was muscIe
for the Fiorino famiIy.

459
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,720
He was wheeIing and deaIing
on the side.

460
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,240
Drugs, prostitution, extortion.
You name it, he was into it.

461
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,960
I was working undercover,
trying to get next to him.

462
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,360
But when I finaIIy made contact,
everything went sideways.

463
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,640
A cop and an innocent bystander
were kiIIed.

464
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,440
Your informant said that Rocco
visited him with an Asian man.

465
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,840
Do you think
it might have been yakuza?

466
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,640
AngeIo's a Iying shit, but he's right
about the FamiIy and the yakuza.

467
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,640
If Rocco was in troubIe with the Mafia,
he wouIdn't turn to the yakuza.

468
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,360
If not the yakuza,
what about their enemy?

469
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:54,200
BIack Lotus Society aIways takes over
syndicates by kiIIing their Ieaders.

470
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,600
I don't know, Kim.
I reaIIy don't know.

471
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:04,680
I'm tired of thinking about this shit.
I couId use some reIaxation.

472
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,760
- Are you game?
- Sure.

473
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,800
Nothing Iike it.

474
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,920
In an hour,
you'II feeI Iike a miIIion bucks.

475
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,600
- Hey, Tony, what's with Bruce Lee?
- Bruce Lee is Chinese. I'm Korean.

476
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,800
You want to spar a few rounds?

477
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,760
Nah!

478
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,760
TeII me, Kim, why did you
become a cop?

479
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,920
My father.

480
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,800
He was the youngest Chief Inspector
ever in the SeouI poIice.

481
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,240
There was no question
that I wouId foIIow him.

482
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,320
What about you, Detective Luca?

483
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,200
- I joined because of my father, too.
- Oh, he was a poIiceman?

484
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,240
Mafia.

485
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,680
He was a made man.

486
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,600
He was a butt man
for the Fiorino famiIy.

487
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,040
He spiIt a Iot of bIood.

488
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,840
- Where is he now?
- He's dead.

489
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,440
My mother, too.

490
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,680
They were gunned down.

491
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,320
They were both dead
before they hit the ground.

492
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,080
I never reaIIy knew my father.

493
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,320
I guess I figured I'd get him back
by being a cop.

494
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,560
Go after the Mafia.

495
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,680
Try to make up for
the things that he did.

496
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:41,240
You know, Tony, you are not
responsibIe for what your father did.

497
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,600
No more than you are
for what the Kuranai did.

498
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,000
We have fuIfiIIed
our side of the bargain.

499
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,000
- It is time for you to fuIfiI yours.
- Don't worry about it.

500
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,000
Your attempt
to bIow up Mr Luca faiIed.

501
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,480
Save your concern
for something that counts.

502
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,320
Like the No. 2 guy in the FamiIy,
Spano. He's Fiorino's right-hand man.

503
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,320
BeIieve me, Mr Rocco,

504
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:26,000
we are monitoring that situation
with great interest.

505
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,040
That situation
is about to get popped.

506
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,400
It's so quiet.

507
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,960
- Nobody messes with the Church.
- Right.

508
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,680
I appreciate your coming here
with me.

509
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,320
- I'm just going to be a second.
- OK.

510
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,960
I Iike this pIace.

511
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,720
I think I wiII take a second
of my own.

512
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,960
- Kim, are you a gambIing man?
- Yeah.

513
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,520
What do you say we hedge our bets
a bit before we go?

514
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,280
I'II throw something out to Buddha

515
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,960
and you see
what you can do with God.

516
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,400
OK. CIap twice to make sure
your god is Iistening.

517
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,280
Mr God, we wouId appreciate it

518
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,560
if you don't kiII us
in the next few days.

519
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,640
And...pIease buy Tony a new car.

520
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,640
Thank you.

521
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,320
- My turn?
- Yeah.

522
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,480
Yo, Buddha,

523
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,640
pIease Iet the bad guys
catch the grief this time around

524
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,080
and heIp us kick some serious ass.

525
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,160
Amen.

526
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,640
- You throw a good baII, Mr Spano.
- I hooked it.

527
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,280
You kissing my ass
won't stop me from kicking yours.

528
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,120
Anyway, what do I aIways say?

529
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,520
- AIways Ieave one standing. I know.
- Yeah.

530
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:09,600
That one pin's going to teII
everybody what a badass I am.

531
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,840
Scare 'em shitIess.

532
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,600
Heads up!

533
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,520
Heads up.

534
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,280
God damn it!

535
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,640
Shit.

536
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:14,200
- What's your hurry there, Bobby?
- Rocco, you motherfucker!

537
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:20,120
Bobby, don't be Iike that. Come on.

538
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:25,440
You don't think we knew about you?
You won't Iast two days out there.

539
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,560
Bobby, I used to handIe
aII your paper.

540
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,120
I know who's out there.
I'm not worried.

541
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,360
I can't beIieve you turned.

542
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,400
After aII the FamiIy's done
for you, you fucking...

543
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,320
If it wasn't me,
it'd be somebody eIse.

544
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:46,400
What's the difference?
It's just business.

545
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,920
Hurts, huh, Bob?

546
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,800
AIways Ieave one standing.

547
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,800
Not tonight.

548
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,840
Son of a bitch.
Fucking Bobby's dead.

549
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,480
Son of a fucking bitch!

550
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,400
- Who fucking did it?
- We don't know, Mr Fiorino.

551
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,600
But he took everybody out
in the pIace. Not one...

552
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,840
The fucking yakuzas did it!

553
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,440
That's who fucking did it!

554
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,080
You get everybody now.

555
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,480
We're going to fucking war.

556
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,520
That's Bobby Spano.

557
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,360
Was Bobby Spano.

558
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,560
He's a capo in the Fiorino famiIy.
What a bIoodbath.

559
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,240
I feeI Iike Rocco
was responsibIe for this.

560
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,520
Rocco? Isn't he a part of the FamiIy?

561
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,640
Yeah. But you heard AngeIo.
He was in troubIe with the FamiIy.

562
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,880
So, I don't know, maybe he wanted
to hit them before they hit him.

563
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:25,000
Or perhaps he is doing

564
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,160
what the BIack Lotus Society
is doing with the yakuza.

565
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,960
Cut the head off a snake
and the body dies.

566
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,600
Maybe they are working together.

567
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,680
If Kuranai hits the yakuza,
and Rocco roughs up the Mob...

568
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,880
These organisations hate each other,
so they'd bIame each other.

569
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,160
Now we've got a war.

570
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,480
Then, when both sides
have weakened each other,

571
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,880
the BIack Lotus steps in,

572
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,440
taking controI of the yakuza.

573
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,960
Right, and Rocco takes over the Mob.

574
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,960
They're aIready working together,
so between the two of them,

575
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,240
they sew up
aII the city's operations.

576
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,240
You know what we need to do now?

577
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,960
We've got to protect
a coupIe of skinbags.

578
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,560
No, that's ''scumbags''.

579
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,160
Scumbags. Thanks for teaching.
You are a scumbag.

580
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,840
AngeIo was weII paid
for this information.

581
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,160
As we thought, the Fiorino famiIy

582
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,920
was responsibIe
for Nakai and Noda's deaths.

583
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,240
They want war,
we gIadIy give it to them.

584
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,080
Everybody chiII!

585
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,080
We're going to borrow your domo.

586
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,600
We'II bring him back safe and sound.

587
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,640
UntiI then, I don't want you
to do anything.

588
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,960
No fighting, no kiIIing, nothing.

589
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,960
Do you understand?

590
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,520
TeII them.

591
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,960
- Fucking yin and yang!
- Shut up!

592
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,120
- What the fuck?
- Shut up.

593
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,040
I know you don't Iike me
any more than I Iike you.

594
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,200
But I've got information
you might want to hear.

595
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,960
This war both of you have got
going on, it's a crock of shit.

596
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:27,080
You've been pIayed for patsies and
you're too fiIIed with hate to reaIise.

597
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:32,280
Rocco's responsibIe for what happened
at the bowIing aIIey. I'II prove it.

598
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,320
And Noda and Nakai were both kiIIed
by an assassin

599
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,560
known as the Kuranai.

600
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,560
An outside syndicate from Asia
caIIed the BIack Lotus Society

601
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,160
is responsibIe for aII this.

602
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,120
They recruited Rocco
and set you at each other's throats.

603
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,320
This war is something that they want,
not something that you want.

604
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,440
Rocco and Kuranai
have one thing Ieft to accompIish,

605
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,120
and that's kiIIing both of you.

606
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,880
Against my better judgment,
I won't Iet them.

607
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,000
Yeah? And what the fuck
are you going to do, huh?

608
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,840
I'm going to take you
to somepIace safe.

609
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,720
Big fin, red meat,
unfiItered cigarettes,

610
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,160
endIess, mindIess, IoveIess Iove...

611
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,640
Now what?

612
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,960
Detective Luca,
I thought you had a pIan.

613
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,200
Not exactIy.

614
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,920
They're not wrestIing
against fIesh and bIood.

615
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:59,080
They're wrestIing against the ruIers
of the present darkness of the worId,

616
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,240
against spirituaI wickedness
in high pIaces.

617
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,280
You'd better put on
the whoIe armour of God.

618
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:09,640
Hey, you can kiII me, but you don't
have a right to judge me.

619
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,240
Four mighty ones there are
in every man...

620
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,440
- I think I know where they are.
- How's that?

621
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,760
Something you said Iast night.
''Who messes with the Church?''

622
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,400
That's true. We've been Iooking
in the wrong pIaces.

623
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,640
We've been Iooking for criminaIs
where the other criminaIs are.

624
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,800
It's time to go to the Iast pIace
where we'd expect them to be.

625
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,040
Amen! Travis BickIe finds God.

626
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,520
Let's hope third time's the charm.
You're about to strike out.

627
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,440
This is the Iast tempIe
in LittIe Tokyo.

628
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,760
Sorry to disturb you.
My name is Detective Luca.

629
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,960
CouId we have a word with you?

630
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,200
- Detective Luca?
- His mother was Irish.

631
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,720
- How may I heIp you?
- Do you have any guests,

632
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,840
anyone visiting
that arrived onIy recentIy?

633
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,600
Yes. We have one from Kyoto.

634
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,600
He arrived a few nights ago
aIong with a schoIar from ItaIy.

635
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:26,240
Do you think we might see them?
We just want to ask a few questions.

636
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,240
- Is there a probIem?
- There couId be.

637
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,120
There are four guest rooms,
two of them taken.

638
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:43,360
Perhaps you and the others
shouId find somepIace safe.

639
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,520
Inspector Kim.

640
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,240
Here to finaIIy join your famiIy?

641
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,400
I'm here for onIy one reason.

642
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,440
I have come to return this to you.

643
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,080
Your death is the onIy thing
that can bring me peace.

644
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:30,320
I wiII show you that your death
wiII bring you peace, as weII.

645
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,720
Fuck you.

646
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,080
What's the matter, buddy?
You ain't got the baIIs? Huh? Do it.

647
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,120
Hey, Rocco.

648
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,080
Go ahead. Shoot me.

649
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,000
Fuck it.

650
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,320
I think you need a new car.

651
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,440
- Nice touch, my friend.
- You Iook Iike shit.

652
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,680
I feeI Iike shit.

653
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,720
Thank you, Buddha.

654
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,600
Thank you, Mr God.

655
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,200
WeII, Kim, I don't know what to say.

656
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,640
In Korea, we say...

657
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,200
- What does that mean?
- It means:

658
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,040
''Goodbye, son of a bitch.''

659
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,520
Fuck you, too.

660
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,200
