00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,480
you know,
or even how to be, really.

180
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:32,109
Maybe she... maybe she just did
what I was afraid to do.

181
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,116
I'm having, like,
a breakthrough here.

182
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,702
-(chuckles)
-Sure you're not
a couples counselor on the side?

183
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,454
Only on weekends.

184
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,832
Oh.

185
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,693
(Colin sighs)

186
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,987
It's after 1:00. I'm starving.

187
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,740
HEIDI: There's a Chinese place
next door.

188
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,704
Well, how about you? You hungry?

189
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,747
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,335
You know, it feels really good
to talk about this stuff.

191
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,504
I don't, I don't really get
that many chances.

192
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,756
I-I'm sorry.

193
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,557
Sure. I could eat.

194
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,393
So, you know, I...
after my last tour,

195
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,521
I came home, you know,
tried to get back into things,

196
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:56,943
relationships, work, but it
just... I didn't fit, you know?

197
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,987
So I went back.
There's a lot of us over there,

198
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,281
ex-soldiers working
as contractors.

199
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,949
We know our way around.

200
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,493
You like it?

201
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,203
It's all right.

202
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,497
-Kind of lonely.
-I bet.

203
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,789
Way out there.

204
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,416
Country's beautiful.
It's not that.

205
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,836
(stammers)

206
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,838
You know, I'm surrounded
by these government people

207
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,759
and you just have to watch
everything you say.

208
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,136
The truth is the last thing
you want to tell them.

209
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,638
Why?

210
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,306
Because they'll use it
against you.

211
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,058
Oh, they act like they're
just doing their job,

212
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,435
but their job is
to find someone to blame.

213
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,940
I'm making it sound like...

214
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,610
No. I know what you mean.

215
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,321
You do?

216
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,241
Yeah.

217
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,327
Someone using you like that?

218
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,120
What?

219
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,790
You know, hassling you, trying
to get something from you?

220
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,583
No.

221
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,793
Because you were just saying...

222
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,588
(chuckles)
I was just being polite.

223
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,803
-Doing it again.
-What?

224
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,098
-Interrogation mode.
-What is that?

225
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,850
Mm, nothing.
Just my work, you know.

226
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,602
Getting information from people.

227
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,272
I just slip into it sometimes
without realizing. Sorry.

228
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,316
Well, I got nothing for you.

229
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,987
Whining about my divorce
and now I'm grilling you.

230
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,822
Jesus, man,
it's a first fucking date.

231
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,532
A first what?

232
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,328
And on that note, I think it's
time to order my first drink.

233
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,038
I should probably...

234
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,832
What? What do you mean?

235
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,625
It's... (stammers)
That's bad luck, you know.

236

What is?

237
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,338
-Folding laundry while sober.
-(chuckles)

238
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,300
-That is one thing
my mother taught me.
-Oh, really?

239
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,385
It's the only thing, really.
Look at me.

Watch your mouth, Walter.

So what? What's the point
of all this?

276
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,683
They just bring us here
to work on our problems?

That's all part
of their evil plan, huh?

278
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,563
Yes. They bring you here and you
say, "I'm crazy, I'm violent,"

279
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,024
and you show them your weakness

280
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,192

advantage of it.

What do I want?

323
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,926
Yes. You talk about

324
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,386
what you owe
the people in your life

325
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,721
or how you failed them,
like Shrier or Lesky,

326
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,267
but... what do you want?

327
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,647

a good way of deciding.

it might be so I can focus
on getting better.

331
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,113
I think that's really important.

Not... No, not dangerous,

00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,809
To what?

340
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,606
I just don't think
you should leave

341
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,149
if you're not sure you're ready.

342
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,403
Right.

343
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,825

00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,398
Okay.

355
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,125
-(door closes)
-WALTER: Heidi?

356
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,169
Walter, I just...

357
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,094
Mrs. Morisseau.

358
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,847
You got what you wanted,
didn't you?

359
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,099
Gloria.

360
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,308
I'm sorry, I just...

361
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,893
It's important to me.

362
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,688
Maybe if I explained more
about our approach...

363
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,691
I understand that,

364
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,275
dealing with the government
and the military,

365
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,777
you don't always feel like

366
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,737
your son's best interests
are a priority.

367
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,948
-They're not.
-(exhales)

368
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,783
I understand
why you feel that way,

369
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,994
but my only intention here
is to help Walter.

370
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,371
-If you could just trust me...
-Trust?

371
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,499
I shouldn't worry about what the
military is doing with my son

372
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,793
because you, Heidi Bergman,

373
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,837
feel that your intentions
are good.

374
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,257
Well, Walter chose to stay.

375
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,633
It's what he wants.

376
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:41,968
I think you should
try to respect that.

377
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,594
What he wants?

378
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,723
That hasn't mattered
since the day he enlisted.

379
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,975
Well, he's done with that.
It's different here.

380
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,394
It's no different, this place.

381
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,024
Maybe you know that, or maybe
you've convinced yourself

382
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,735
you're serving a greater good.

383
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,696
Maybe you care
about Walter's treatment.

384
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,198
Or maybe you just care
about him.

385
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,826
It doesn't matter.

386
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:10,496
If you think
that you can protect him,

387
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,708
or anyone else,
in a place like this,

388
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,752
then you're a fool.

389
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,842
(car door opens, closes)

390
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,011
(engine starts)

391
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,644
(insects trilling)

392
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,084
(laughing)

393
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,961
So we have, um, one drink...

394
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,671
-Yeah.
-...after four years

395
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,757
and he calls me the next day.

396
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,467
Unbelievable.

397
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,260
-Thank you.
-(both chuckle)

398
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,347
Uh, he said, uh...
God, what did he say?

399
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,393
He said, "Oh,
it's the weirdest coincidence"

400
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:18,314
and, uh, he's in my town

401
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:21,025
and wants to know if he could
stay at my place.

402
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,985
-No.
-But just for a couple of days.

403
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,237
-No, no.
-(laughs)

404
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,239
What did he mean?
What did you do?

405
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,366
Um, I said, uh,

406
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,369
"Anthony, I'm-I'm really sorry,

407
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,371
but my mom won't let me
have sleepovers."

408
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,289
(laughs)

409
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,999
Which is true.

410
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,709
-(phone buzzing)
-But wasn't very nice.

411
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,002
Yeah.

412
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,212
Anthony deserved it.

413
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,839
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

414
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,133
(exhales)

415
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,676
Is everything all right?

416
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,220
Yeah, it's my wife.

417
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,764
My ex, sorry, my ex-wife.

418
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,891
Wants me to sign
the divorce papers.

419
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,353
Every time we talk,
I make up another excuse.

420
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,771
(chuckles)

421
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,232
She thinks I'm still
in Afghanistan.

422
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,609
(Colin chuckles)

423
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,909
Do you ever get sick of it?

424
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,705
What?

425
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,124
Just... lying like that?

426
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,504
Well, no. I mean, uh...

427
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,006
-I...
-I mean, d...

428
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,466
Don't worry, I'm...
I'm a liar, too.

429
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,761
-You?
-Mm.

430
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,598
What... what do you lie about?

431
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:38,394
Just every day, I...

432
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,022
I go to work,
I pretend to be this...

433
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,858
this person, this waitress.

434
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,943
I serve people and I smile,

435
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,696
and then I go home,
and it's the same thing.

436
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:52,992
I pretend to be a...
a good daughter,

437
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:56,621
and sometimes
I convince myself...

438
00:24:56,662 --> 00:25:01,042
this is me, this is real.

439
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,299
I know what you mean.

440
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,385
Oh, but then I...

441
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:17,099
like, I'll be in my car,
or right when I wake up,

442
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:22,313
and it's like I just appeared
out of nowhere.

443
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:26,192
I can just see my whole life.
It's phony and fake.

444
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:30,196
And every word that I say,
every second...

445
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:39,121
I don't know, but if it's...
that is a lie,

446
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,874
then where's the other one,
the real one?

447
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:45,836
The real what?

448
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,340
Me.

449
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:52,009
The--

450
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,804
The one I won't let myself see.

451
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,851
Hmm.

452
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:07,316
But then I start to think,
what difference does it make?

453
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,985
If we lie?

454
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:12,613
If we lie or tell the truth,
or if it's real or fake

455
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,323
or just...

456
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,327
I just want to take it all
and just...

457
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,372
put it in one place
and just say...

458
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,082
Fuck this?

459
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,084
Yes. Exactly.

460
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,627
Fuck this.

461
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,138
Um...

462
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,556
That's not what you meant,
is it?

463
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,558

No, it isn't.

This is--

One of the soldiers,
Walter Cruz,

he wants to leave,
he wants to go home,

sent home right away.

Lying.
