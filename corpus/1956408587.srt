the Treville development,

356
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,679

him the big picture.

By the end of the week he'll
be begging us to buy that dump.

368

to be ruthless to get ahead.

LORETTA: Veronica and I were
just talking about the votes.

408
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:23,287
Oh, okay. So let me sum
up what we are facing here.

409
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,823
The charter of the
church allows the pastor

410
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:29,093
to make decisions without
involvement of the board,

411
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:32,730
except for relocation,
denomination, and financial

412
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,965
expenditures over $10,000.

413
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:38,135
So in order to move
forward on any matter

414
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,237
that falls within
these exceptions,

415
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,207
a vote of yes from two
out of the three boards

416
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,543
and the pastor is needed.

417
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,779
Now Loretta, I'm quite
sure you'll handle the pastor.

418
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:52,016
Of course. How do
you think we got this far?

419
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:54,585
Great, great.
Has anyone spoken to Joan?

420
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,320
We're definitely gonna
need the stewardess board

421
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:58,622
because it will
be almost impossible

422
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,291
to have the deacons on board.

423
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,093
That's what Loretta was
saying before you came over.

424
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,930
That Deacon Williams, he
is an Old Testament stiff.

425
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,966
If it was up to him, he would
live and die in that church.

426
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,035
- Mm-hmm.
- But I did speak to Joan,

427
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:14,271
and she's already planting
the seeds with the stewardess.

428
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,240

00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,208
