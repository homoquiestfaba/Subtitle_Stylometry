1
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:42,559
Hi there.

2
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:43,905
My name is, uh, Robert Melvin,

3
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,494
but, uh, people call
me Fatty Melvin.

4
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:50,533
It's been a nickname
since I was a kid.

5
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,466
I aspire to be a
motivational speaker,

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,365
like my big brother, James.

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,713
But, uh, right now I am a
corporate facilities technician

8
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:00,508
at a company run by Lisa Cohen.

9
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,860
She's really cool, though.

10
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,995
You'll see her soon, yeah.

11
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,963
If you dream it,

12
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,551
you can achieve it.

13
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,313
If you can dream it,

14
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:14,350
you can achieve it.

15
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:17,594
Anyway, well, this is my story.

16
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,182
Time to chase the
American dream.

17
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:25,567
Ha-ha-ha.

18
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:21,313
Ms. Cohen, the
ball is in your court.

19
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:23,557
All you have to do is sign.

20
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,283
This is a great deal, Lisa.

21
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:26,560
You're gonna be a millionaire.

22
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:28,838
I just feel like I'm
signing away my baby.

23
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:31,599
For a million dollars.

24
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:32,531
That didn't sound right.

25
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:33,774
No.

26
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:36,949
Ms. Cohen, we promise
to take care of you,

27
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:40,470
and your million dollar baby.

28
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:53,656
And you're gonna keep
everything here, right?

29
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,967
No outsourcing?

30
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:58,385
No, everything will
remain exactly as it is.

31
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,387
You can trust us, Ms. Cohen.

32
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:03,424
We will always make
the right choice.

33
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:06,462
Man.

34
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:07,635
What's that?

35
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,813
It's nobody, just the janitor.

36
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:14,504
Ah, good, perfect.

37
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:17,749
What is a janitor?

38
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,131
Am I saying that right?

39
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,166
Yanitor.

40
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:31,625
Must be someone who eats a lot.

41
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,627
Don't ever be a janitor.

42
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,584
- Hey, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:36,414
- Way to go, Fatty, alright.
- Hey, Bob.

44
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:37,932
How you doing?

45
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,565
Looking forward to your
brother's book signing tonight.

46
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:40,901
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:42,627
Hope to see you there, Bob.

48
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:44,007
- Alright, sounds good.
- Alright.

49
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:45,215
Hey, vote Bob.

50
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,976
Oh, yeah, yeah, uh, cool.

51
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,254
See you there, Bob.

52
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:55,191
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

53
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:57,711
Finally.

54
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:58,953
Robert?

55
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,992
Hey, you okay?

56
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,407
They're the wrong color.

57
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:05,512
I said red.

58
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:06,685
It's okay, Dad.

59
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,997
I can go get 'em.

60
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:08,825
I, but I...

61
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,102
I thought you said blue.

62
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,137
No, red.

63
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:15,176
You're gonna drive me to drink.

64
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,834
It's okay.

65
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:21,907
You okay?

66
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:22,770
Yeah.

67
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,013
It's good to see you.

68
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:25,439
Wow, this is your
fifth book launch.

69
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:26,809
When are you gonna have one?

70
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,362
I, I dunno.

71
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:30,399
I'm working on it.

72
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,608
Ah, come on, seriously,

73
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,334
- you should write a book.
- Yeah.

74
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,783
I'll be the first one to buy it.

75
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,267
Really?

76
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:38,234
Don't worry,
I'll go get the balloons.

77
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:39,062
You sure?

78
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:39,891
Yeah, yeah.

79
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:40,925
Thanks.

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,828
Whoa.

81
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,070
Who's is...

82
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:48,451
Ah, no.

83
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:50,522
Not too shabby, right?

84
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,006
This is yours?

85
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,180
No way.

86
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:54,664
This is the one.

87
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:55,710
This is the
one you've always wanted.

88
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:56,632
Yeah.

89
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,678
It's a real Lamborghini.

90
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:58,702
Yeah.

91
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:00,876
It's great.

92
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,571
Scratch this off the list.

93
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:05,813
Whoa.

94
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:06,814
Come on, get in.

95
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,091
- Really?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:14,201
Is this from all
your book sales?

97
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,582
Uh...

98
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:16,445
No, no, no.

99
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,687
This is, uh,

100
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:19,827
one of my many perks
for my new gig.

101
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:20,828
Congratulations.

102
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:22,830
This is awesome.

103
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:23,659
Yeah.

104
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:24,936
Yeah, uh,

105
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,524
I'm a spokesperson
for them, you know.

106
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:29,734
Motivational speaker, lots
of travel, high salary.

107
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:33,841
I go around all America,
speak to all businesses.

108
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,223
Can I hear the engine?

109
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:37,397
Oh yeah.

110
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,299
This is amazing.

111
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,716
This is a car you've
always dreamed of getting.

112
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:47,579
Yeah.

113
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:48,408
That's amazing.

114
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:49,547
It is, it's just...

115
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:51,065
It's just a car.

116
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,894
Yeah, but it's...

117
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,585
Oh my gosh.

118
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,620
It's great.

119
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,382
You know, the funny thing is,

120
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,351
I always thought I would
feel a little different.

121
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:02,594
Is it, like,

122
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:03,526
do you know what
the cylinders are?

123
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,494
Is it like a horsepower thing?

124
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:08,980
I mean, I really
don't know anything about it.

125
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:10,430
It's so cool.

126
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,121
I better go get
those balloons, huh?

127
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:15,400
Oh, yeah, okay, sure.

128
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,228
See ya.

129
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:17,263
Bye.

130
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:07,866
Hey, Fatty.

131
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,213
I am so sorry for your loss.

132
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:14,148
James was truly one of a kind.

133
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:16,496
In times like this,

134
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,705
when it seems like
there's no one to turn to,

135
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:22,122
you have a community of
friends behind you, Fatty.

136
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:24,089
Do not hesitate to reach out.

137
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:26,723
Fatty, I just
heard about the accident.

138
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:28,922
I'm praying for you, buddy.

139
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:31,131
There will never be
another like James.

140
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:33,961
He has truly left
behind a legacy.

141
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:37,551
Now I just got off
the phone with Frank.

142
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,070
He wants us to coax this guy,

143
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:40,461
see if we can bring
him to our side,

144
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,211
maybe make a him our
motivational speaker.

145
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:43,730
- That'd be fantastic.
- Exactly.

146
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:48,079
So we wanna make sure that he
is as comfortable as possible.

147
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:48,942
Get him a water.

148
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,253
- Okay.
- Water.

149
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,325
Hey, Robert?

150
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,672
How you feeling?

151
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:56,604
Oh,

152
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:58,779
yeah, um,

153
00:08:58,814 --> 00:08:59,884
I'm okay.

154
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:01,126
I'm fine.

155
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:03,232
Okay, well, I
know this is sudden,

156
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,923
but I have your brother's will.

157
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,133
And according to it,

158
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:10,550
he left this business to you.

159
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:12,516
What?

160
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:14,312
That can't be right?

161
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,624
There must be some mistake.

162
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:16,452
No, no, no.

163
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:17,280
No mistake.

164
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:18,212
It's all here.

165
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:20,042
I put the will in a box for you,

166
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,906
and he left this
box for you as well.

167
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,735
And I think he
also left the book

168
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,875
he might have been working on.

169
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,118
Could be worth some money.

170
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,881
Robert, you okay?

171
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,057
Oh, I...

172
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:36,368
Oh.

173
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:37,749
Can we get you anything?

174
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,579
Ah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

175
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:40,752
I'm just gonna...

176
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,340
I'm just gonna, uh,

177
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,342
use the restroom.

178
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,861
Okay, um...

179
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:47,483
I'm fine.

180
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:50,900
Is he coming back?

181
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:53,212
Yes.

182
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,713
Hi, James.

183
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,611
This is Lisa Cohen
from Personal Best.

184
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:23,165
I know Jan gave you the details,

185
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:25,719
but I just wanted to say
that we're all very excited

186
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:28,549
to have you give your
motivational speech this week.

187
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:31,069
I look forward to meeting you.

188
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:43,806
What are you doing?

189
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:46,464
You're a terrible
motivational speaker.

190
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,155
Hi, everybody.

191
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,329
My name is Fatty Melvin,

192
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:51,849
and I am a motivational speaker.

193
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,989
Who wants to be motivated?

194
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,026
Okay.

195
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:59,546
You know, your brain
is like a computer.

196
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,754
Are you married?

197
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,652
No, I'm a swinging bachelor.

198
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,414
Well, then do you
have a girlfriend?

199
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,243
No, I still haven't found
that lucky lady.

200
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:09,832
Do you think it's
because you are so fat,

201
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:12,386
or because you're so old?

202
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:24,122
I need a paper bag.

203
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,423
Fear is the biggest thing

204
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,702
keeping us from being the
person we're meant to be.

205
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,014
Fear isn't real.

206
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,778
It's an imaginary monster
lurking in the shadows.

207
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,469
And the only way to defeat it

208
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:03,506
is to expose it by
facing it head-on.

209
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:07,027
Only when we run at fear,

210
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,928
will fear run away.

211
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,140
Fear isn't real.

212
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,737
There you go.

213
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:28,566
All right?

214
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,670
Fatty?
Yeah.

215
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:30,671
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

216
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:31,534
Yeah?

217
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,398
All right, here we go.

218
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:38,921
Ladies and gentlemen,

219
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:41,993
welcome to the second annual
Plastic Ware conference.

220
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,857
Yeah, woo!

221
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:45,272
We are so excited to bring you

222
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,965
our favorite
motivational speaker,

223
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,794
Fatty Melvin.

224
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,870
Oh.

225
00:13:58,527 --> 00:13:59,527
Ugh.

226
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,918
Who wants to dream?

227
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:11,402
I do!

228
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:14,750
Who wants to dream
the American dream?

229
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:21,136
Who wants to dream the American
dream with Plastic Ware?

230
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,586
Well, now you can.

231
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:27,073
I see dreamers
who have woken up,

232
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:31,180
and I'm telling you all
it's time to dream again.

233
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:35,978
I want you to think about
all those amazing things.

234
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:38,912
A new car, a new
boat, a jet plane,

235
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,779
a make-up kit for the
ladies, a new dress,

236
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:46,126
to go to Mars, whatever.

237
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:49,958
There is no dream too
small with Plastic Ware.

238
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,754
Let theses images soak in.

239
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:03,694
You suck.

240
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,284
All right, woo!

241
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:11,738
I'm gonna do something now.

242
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:14,327
I'm gonna walk out
here into the audience,

243
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,295
'cause I really wanna
connect with you all.

244
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,125
What's your dream?

245
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,403
I wanna be a
professional hugger.

246
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:22,611
All right.

247
00:15:22,645 --> 00:15:25,165
Well, a professional
hugger is weird.

248
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,097
What about you?

249
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:27,996
To be the next Miss USA.

250
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,343
Whoa, Miss USA.

251
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:31,206
A full head of hair?

252
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,345
I want a new Ferrari.

253
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:33,311
A vacation to Italy.

254
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:34,450
Laptop.

255
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:36,004
All right, yeah!

256
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,246
A new laptop.

257
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:39,593
Uh, a used laptop.

258
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:40,870
A used laptop?

259
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:42,113
All right.

260
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:45,806
What about you, NFL
legend, Rodney Peete?

261
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,463
You validate parking?

262
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:49,672
Rodney Peete, woo, yeah!

263
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:53,711
Everyone, Rodney
Peete in the house.

264
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:55,368
Thank you.

265
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:56,403
Anyone else?

266
00:15:58,578 --> 00:15:59,578
Okay.

267
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:02,168
Oh, that's what I
wanna talk about.

268
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,202
Okay.

269
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:08,105
All those dreams can
come true right now

270
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,072
with Plastic Ware.

271
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,182
It's not a pyramid scheme,

272
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,493
but rather,

273
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:20,358
but rather a multi-level
marketing company

274
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:22,774
that offers an
exciting opportunity

275
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:26,261
to have all your heart's
desires come true

276
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:33,923
by becoming a Plastic
Ware representative.

277
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,511
All right.

278
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:37,824
With Plastic Ware,

279
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:41,103
it's time to inflate your life.

280
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,415
Who's with me?

281
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,501
Ooh.

282
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:03,884
When one door closes, another
door is always gonna open.

283
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,894
All right.

284
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:18,658
Hey, Rodney.

285
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,592
Thank you.

286
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:23,283
America.

287
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:41,060
Hey, Fatty.

288
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,061
Oh, hi, Kathy.

289
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,096
How you doing?

290
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:44,891
Oh, not bad.

291
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:46,317
Can I get you
started with some coffee?

292
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:47,559
Oh, that'd be
great, thank you.

293
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,861
All right, I'll be right back.

294
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:53,175
Oh, hey, do you want
a freshly baked do-

295
00:17:58,146 --> 00:18:00,389
- Oh, they're not bad.

296
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:44,709
This belong to you?

297
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:15,844
If you plant the
right seeds in life,

298
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:16,948
water them,

299
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:19,468
let the sun come down on them.

300
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:22,402
They will come to fruition.

301
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:23,886
Hey, Dad.

302
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:25,957
If you dream it,

303
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:27,545
you can achieve it.

304
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:32,792
Got you some barbecue, Dad.

305
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:35,864
You know, just the
way you like it.

306
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,384
If you plant the
right seeds in life,

307
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:39,523
water them,

308
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,628
let the sun come down on them.

309
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:44,010
Oh, I've been doing some, uh,

310
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:45,839
motivational talks, you know?

311
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:46,771
Uh...

312
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:47,738
If you dream it-

313
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:48,980
- It's not as good as James,

314
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:52,984
but, you know, I'm trying.

315
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:54,019
Oh,

316
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,265
remember what James used to say?

317
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,474
If you can dream it,
you can achieve it.

318
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:04,824
I guess that's what
I'm trying to do.

319
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,932
If you plant
the right seeds in life,

320
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,175
water them,

321
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,763
let the sun come down on them.

322
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:14,765
I'll start the grill.

323
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,906
They will come to fruition.

324
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,252
If you dream it,

325
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:21,737
you can achieve it.

326
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,776
Hey, babe.

327
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,985
I just wanted to call and
say I'm not gonna make it.

328
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,262
I would've called sooner,

329
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:31,851
but I'm with someone
very muy importante.

330
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:32,783
You get it.

331
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:33,853
And that's why I love us.

332
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:35,130
All right, see you later.

333
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:36,959
Oh, hey, make sure
you eat a salad.

334
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:37,994
Derek out.

335
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,896
Is your party
still gonna show up?

336
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,381
He's not coming.

337
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:46,635
Would you care
to order anything?

338
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:47,729
Mmhmm.

339
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,627
I like a large pizza.
Mmhmm.

340
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:53,286
And a large cheeseburger
with two patties well done.

341
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,668
And a baked potato with
bacon and sour cream.

342
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:57,014
And a snow cone.

343
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,294
A really big snow cone
with great flavor.

344
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:03,676
And a little bit of
vodka on the top of it,

345
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,782
and, like, a little
cherry and a little straw.

346
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:11,476
Okay.

347
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:17,552
I would also like
a barrel of wine.

348
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:22,694
Robert.

349
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,146
Dan, can we come in and
remove the centerpiece

350
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:27,424
from the table?

351
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:29,563
Dan?

352
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,290
Nevermind.

353
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,846
Robert, thank you
for coming in today.

354
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,367
I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it for you.

355
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,679
The main point is this.

356
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:46,581
Your father used the family
home as capital to, uh,

357
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:49,031
set up James' business.

358
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,620
The bank is gonna
foreclose on the house,

359
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:55,797
unless we can come up
with a viable solution.

360
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:57,626
What about writing a book?

361
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:58,903
Books sell.

362
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:00,422
Your brother had
a solid fan base.

363
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:02,769
Why not pick up
where he left off?

364
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:05,220
I'm sure you can write something

365
00:22:05,254 --> 00:22:07,429
motivational, you know?

366
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:08,464
Or just...

367
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:10,743
Dan, can we move the-

368
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:11,744
- It's o-

369
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:12,607
- No, no.

370
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:13,711
No, it's okay.

371
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:15,195
Dan?

372
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,302
You know, or something
with a little more pizzazz.

373
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,407
Pizza?

374
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:20,441
Pizzazz.

375
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,479
Pizzazz?

376
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:23,687
Yes.

377
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,139
Pizzazz.

378
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:32,073
Pizzazz.

379
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:36,043
Pizzazz.

380
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:45,846
Your story.

381
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:49,989
Your story.

382
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:09,317
Pizzazz.

383
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:15,601
Hey, Janet.

384
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:17,603
Oh, my flights in
about an hour or so.

385
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:18,673
I gotta dash.

386
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,780
They brought in
some cheap motivational speaker

387
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:24,817
to help with the transition.

388
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:25,749
I don't know who it is.

389
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:27,923
I never ask these things.

390
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:28,890
Hey, guess what?

391
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,926
Contracts have all gone through.

392
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:33,619
I say we start with
the usual layoffs,

393
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:36,173
we outsource to China,

394
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,450
India,

395
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:39,072
sell off the rest,
just like normal.

396
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:42,247
Somebody here?

397
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,014
All right, yeah, I gotta split.

398
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:52,741
I'll see you at the office.

399
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,295
What's that?

400
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,124
No, a truck.

401
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:57,366
Truck broke by.

402
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:26,637
Thank you.

403
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,297
Hi.

404
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:39,098
My...

405
00:24:39,132 --> 00:24:40,340
Hi.

406
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,860
My name is Fatty Melvin,

407
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:45,863
and I'm a motivational speaker.

408
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:48,314
So who wants to be motivated?

409
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:52,663
Yeah?

410
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:54,872
Okay.

411
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:57,565
Right.

412
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,499
Uh, can I get a volunteer?

413
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,604
Yeah.

414
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,813
Now, you see,

415
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:07,333
in life, you have to push
through the competition.

416
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,197
You have to push
through those obstacles.

417
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,647
If you want to be the best,

418
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:12,303
if you want to be at the top,

419
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:16,204
you can't let anything get
in your way, all right?

420
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:18,206
So what I want you to do...

421
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,034
What's your name?

422
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:20,001
- Nick.
- Nick.

423
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:21,209
What I want you to do, Nick,

424
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:23,245
I just want you to break
through this board.

425
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,419
I believe you.

426
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,076
I believe you can do this.

427
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,699
If you believe it, you
can achieve it, all right?

428
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:29,804
Here we go.

429
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:30,838
All right, here we go.

430
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:32,979
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

431
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:34,429
My god, are you okay?

432
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:35,913
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:36,948
Ow.

434
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:44,128
Oh, boy.

435
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:47,786
Oh, um...

436
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Yeah.

437
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:06,150
Well,

438
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:10,258
this is my story, huh?

439
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:17,127
It's not a great story.

440
00:26:19,232 --> 00:26:21,131
I'm kind of sick of it.

441
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:29,588
Don't you get sick of
the same story in life?

442
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:33,971
The same story played
over and over again

443
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:35,628
like some bad rerun.

444
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:39,943
I know I'm sick of it.

445
00:26:43,222 --> 00:26:46,294
You know, there's
the "always" story.

446
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,987
I always miss out on that job,

447
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:51,230
and I always get sick,

448
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,232
and I'm,

449
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:57,063
I'm always failing at
every single thing I do.

450
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:01,516
And then there's
the "never" story.

451
00:27:03,276 --> 00:27:05,209
I'm never gonna succeed in life.

452
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:06,314
I'm never gonna travel.

453
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:08,316
I'm never gonna make it.

454
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,973
I'm never gonna
achieve my dreams.

455
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:12,561
It's never gonna happen for me.

456
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:19,361
The worst one is the
"not enough" story.

457
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:23,814
I'm not enough.

458
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,368
I don't look good enough.

459
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:28,060
I'm not slim enough.

460
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:31,684
I don't have enough hair.

461
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,796
And clearly I'm not a good
enough motivational speaker,

462
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,832
as you can all,

463
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:43,454
as you can all see.

464
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:53,947
But what...

465
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:59,125
What if you could
change your story?

466
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:02,991
What if you could rewrite it,

467
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:04,026
change it,

468
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:05,960
change the direction?

469
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:09,446
You could just recreate
your life, almost.

470
00:28:10,585 --> 00:28:13,830
So what would you
want your story to be?

471
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:14,762
If you could rewrite it,

472
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:17,143
what would you want it to be?

473
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:20,353
I mean, anyone?

474
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:24,426
I'd go to Paris and eat
every single type of cheese.

475
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:25,911
Do it.

476
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:27,291
I'd go base jumping.

477
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:28,223
Yes, do it.

478
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:29,269
I'd go and start a band.

479
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:30,501
Yes.

480
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:32,572
I'd ask Sarah
from accounts out.

481
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:33,850
Yes, yes.

482
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:35,068
I'd go visit my dad in Canada.

483
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:36,369
Yes, do it.

484
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:38,613
I'd give away all my
money to the homeless.

485
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:39,647
Yes.

486
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:42,479
We can change our story.

487
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,894
We can do this thing.

488
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:45,275
And guess what?

489
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,517
Guess what?

490
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:49,279
We can all change
our story today.

491
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:50,452
You know why?

492
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:51,281
Why?

493
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:52,109
You know why?

494
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:53,076
Why?

495
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,078
Personal Best is closing down,

496
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:56,355
and there's nothing to stop you

497
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:59,461
so you can change
your story right now.

498
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,188
- Wait.
- Did you know?

499
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:04,259
- I didn't know that.
- What?

500
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:11,197
Absolutely, so
good to see you.

501
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:12,232
Yeah, right back.

502
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:14,891
There you are.

503
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:18,791
James Melvin, what did
you just say to my staff?

504
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:19,758
Coffee?

505
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:20,759
Coffee.

506
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:21,587
Uh, tea?

507
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:22,415
Let me...

508
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,727
Let me explain.

509
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,801
And you can't just go around

510
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:30,907
telling my staff
confidential information,

511
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:32,425
which isn't even true, mind you.

512
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,357
But I overheard.

513
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:35,118
No, Frank explained to me

514
00:29:35,152 --> 00:29:37,810
that he was referring to another
business venture of ours,

515
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:39,053
not Personal Best.

516
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:41,849
Did you hear him
say Personal Best?

517
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:43,643
- No. No, I didn't.
- Okay.

518
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:44,852
Cupcake?

519
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:48,407
Oh, at least let
me buy you a cupcake.

520
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:49,718
No, thank you.

521
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,031
Oh, uh...

522
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:55,207
Look, life can be
really tough, okay?

523
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:58,072
But it's actually about
a lot of hard work,

524
00:29:58,106 --> 00:30:00,488
not just a lot of talk, okay?

525
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,493
Life is not just
some great story

526
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:08,082
that you can just change
whenever you want to.

527
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:09,116
Why not?

528
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:11,810
I mean,

529
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:12,983
are you happy?

530
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:16,228
Are you serious?

531
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:18,954
Well...

532
00:30:21,923 --> 00:30:23,373
Am I happy?

533
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,444
I just sold my business

534
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:28,136
to a multi-billion dollar
conglomeration, okay.

535
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:29,828
I'm gonna be a millionaire.

536
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,070
Well,

537
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:33,383
it still doesn't quite
answer my question.

538
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,868
What do you want from me?

539
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:36,904
Am I happy?

540
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:37,974
No, I'm not happy.

541
00:30:38,008 --> 00:30:39,458
I just sold my business.

542
00:30:39,492 --> 00:30:42,461
I was losing so much money,
and I just feel stuck.

543
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:43,634
That's why I had to do that.

544
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:45,533
I didn't have
another choice, okay?

545
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:48,777
But I just have to
keep moving forward.

546
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:51,090
And then one day

547
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,507
I'm gonna know what I am
meant to do, all right?

548
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:55,819
But until then, I just,

549
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,374
I'm gonna keep
moving forward, okay?

550
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:02,930
But what if there
isn't one day?

551
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:04,448
What if all we have is today?

552
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:07,106
I mean, surely there must be
something deep down inside

553
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:08,936
that you've always wanted to do.

554
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,042
What is it that
you wanna do today?

555
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:13,975
Not one day, but today.

556
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:21,880
What, you just get that from
a Hallmark card or something?

557
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,263
I'm gonna use this one day.

558
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,442
Look, I gotta go.

559
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:33,892
Not one day, but right now.

560
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:38,344
Dinner.

561
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:39,898
Are you serious?

562
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:45,075
I know that, to
most people, um,

563
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:50,943
having fancy clothes
and being physically fit

564
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:53,912
and having a great
job and nice car,

565
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,777
full head of hair,

566
00:31:57,812 --> 00:31:59,848
a family that loves them,

567
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,715
I know a lot of these
things mean a lot

568
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,683
to a lot of people, but

569
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:09,617
if you give me a chance,

570
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,212
I'll show you that those
things mean very little.

571
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:22,837
I have a boyfriend.

572
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:24,356
Oh.

573
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,532
Just as friends.

574
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,086
Right, just friends.

575
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,759
So how are we looking?

576
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:52,418
I hear the Personal Best
deal went through smoothly?

577
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,145
- 1-wood.
- Yeah.

578
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,491
You still on track?

579
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:58,021
Just have to push it
through city council,

580
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:00,599
but I'm sure we'll have no
problem convincing the town

581
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:02,497
that this is the best
deal for everybody.

582
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:04,637
Well, I hope you
make this work, Frank.

583
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:06,432
I'd hate to have to
find a replacement.

584
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:12,955
7.

585
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:16,373
Who's ready to lose?

586
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:18,962
Ah, there he is.

587
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,963
Frank, have you met Derek?

588
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,206
Yeah.

589
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,656
Yeah, Derek is my,
uh, superstar realtor.

590
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:24,933
Yes, I am.

591
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:26,256
He's gonna be the
next Grant Cardone.

592
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,764
Ooh.

593
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,535
Hey, have you picked
out your new private jet?

594
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,491
I have.

595
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,320
Gulfstream 450 for me.

596
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:34,736
Ah, I remember my first G4.

597
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:38,153
I have three now.

598
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,674
Thanks, Derek,

599
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,066
for encouraging Lisa to
fall through on this deal.

600
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,883
I got your back.

601
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:44,815
I won't forget it.

602
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,128
Wow, look at that.

603
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:50,718
Thank you.

604
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Impressive.

605
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:56,689
Hey, no, just...

606
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:05,112
She's not gonna turn up.

607
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:06,561
She won't show.

608
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:08,046
Oh, she's gonna turn up.

609
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,323
What am I gonna say?

610
00:34:09,357 --> 00:34:10,576
I don't know what
to say to a woman.

611
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,051
Um, I don't have
any witty remarks

612
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:16,882
or social media commentary
or political statements.

613
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,366
I don't know what to say.

614
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,401
I know.

615
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,611
I'll take some notes.

616
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,269
I'll write down some notes.

617
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,409
That's what I'll do.

618
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:28,342
I just need to write
down some notes.

619
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:29,826
That's it.

620
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,517
Okay, okay.

621
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,072
Um...

622
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,735
You just gotta go.

623
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,530
Don't think so much.

624
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:46,912
Don't overanalyze it.

625
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:48,948
Perfection is an excuse.

626
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:52,262
Just gotta go.

627
00:34:52,297 --> 00:34:53,746
As you are.

628
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:57,405
No ducks in a row,
no stars in a line.

629
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
Just go.

630
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Go.

631
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:02,168
Go.

632
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:04,447
I just gotta go.

633
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:08,934
I just gotta go.

634
00:35:58,363 --> 00:35:59,157
Hi.

635
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,191
Hey.

636
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,194
Wow.

637
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:05,645
This is too much.

638
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:13,343
We're friends, right?

639
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:15,897
Oh, look, we already made
it to friends.

640
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,763
Because I have a boyfriend.

641
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:21,040
Yeah.

642
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:22,570
And, I mean, I was
under the impression

643
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:24,975
this was just sort of an
acquaintance type dinner.

644
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,080
Yeah, yeah, it is.

645
00:36:26,114 --> 00:36:27,357
That's all it is.

646
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:28,289
Okay.

647
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:29,324
Yeah.

648
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,568
What is this place?

649
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:34,916
Oh, this is, uh, Mayor
Bob's golf course.

650
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,573
We could have just
gone to your house.

651
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:37,885
Oh, uh,

652
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:40,025
this is, uh, much nicer.

653
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,268
Take a seat.

654
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:42,302
Thank you.

655
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:47,757
Are you writing a book?

656
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,585
Uh,

657
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,000
yeah.

658
00:36:50,035 --> 00:36:52,520
"The Fatty Melvin Way."

659
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:54,384
Yeah, it's kinda
like my nickname.

660
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:55,972
It's a really bad nickname.

661
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,112
Oh, I'm kind of used to it.

662
00:36:58,146 --> 00:36:59,286
- Okay.
- Um...

663
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:01,598
That smells amazing.

664
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:02,737
Yeah, do you like ribs?

665
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:04,463
I've never had ribs before.

666
00:37:04,498 --> 00:37:05,292
Really?

667
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:06,603
No.

668
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:07,259
You're gonna love these.

669
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,294
Oh my gosh.

670
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,124
It's a recipe

671
00:37:10,158 --> 00:37:13,610
that my dad and my brother
and I all kind of use.

672
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:14,680
Okay.

673
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:15,888
Great.

674
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,580
Excuse me, my hands.

675
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,478
There you go.

676
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,860
Oh my gosh.

677
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:24,449
Been cooking these all day.

678
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:26,105
Okay, you just-

679
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,142
- Yeah, you just pick
'em up and eat 'em.

680
00:37:28,176 --> 00:37:29,626
Oh my god.

681
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:35,045
Yeah, that's it.

682
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:38,877
This is so good.

683
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,568
This is really good.

684
00:37:40,603 --> 00:37:41,880
Thank you.

685
00:37:41,914 --> 00:37:43,916
Oh my god, dig in.

686
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:45,987
Mm, I'm super hungry,
I missed lunch.

687
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Mm.

688
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:52,096
Mm.

689
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:56,584
I think I just hurt myself.

690
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,104
I'm in pain, I think my tooth.

691
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:03,003
Am I okay?

692
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:05,386
Yeah, yeah.

693
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:06,214
Really?

694
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:07,423
Yeah, you look great.

695
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:08,941
I have, like, a shooting pain.

696
00:38:08,976 --> 00:38:10,357
You got a bit of
something, uh...

697
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:11,703
Sorry, just a...

698
00:38:11,737 --> 00:38:12,738
Yeah.

699
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:14,015
Are you sure?

700
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:14,913
Yeah, yeah, you're
fine, you're fine.

701
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:16,028
I'm gonna check my mirror.

702
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:18,226
I'm feeling-Whoa.

703
00:38:18,261 --> 00:38:19,849
Hey, let's go for a walk.

704
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:21,816
Let me show you around
Mayor Bob's golf course.

705
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:22,679
It's awesome.

706
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:24,716
- Okay.
- Yeah.

707
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:28,995
This way.

708
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:34,381
Well, this used to be
John Denver's golf course.

709
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:35,485
Oh, the singer?

710
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,005
No, John Denver, real estate.

711
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,627
My dad and I used to sing, uh,

712
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,560
"Annie's Song"
together, growing up.

713
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:43,148
Yeah.

714
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:44,988
I used to play Daddy Warbucks
in the school play.

715
00:38:45,012 --> 00:38:45,806
Oh, okay.

716
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,772
Yeah, it was weird.

717
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:48,291
Like I used to have to audition,

718
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,948
and after a while,

719
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:51,984
I used to just get the
role every year.

720
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:52,847
I don't know why.

721
00:38:52,882 --> 00:38:53,710
It's weird.

722
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:56,230
It's not that weird.

723
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:58,681
Oh.

724
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:00,096
Are those yours?

725
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,063
Well, yeah, look,
you know, um...

726
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,352
All right, let
me see what you got.

727
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:05,619
Oh, really?

728
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:06,654
Okay.
Oh, please.

729
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:09,174
I'll try.

730
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,693
Okay, um, er...

731
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:14,282
All right, this.

732
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:15,525
Okay.

733
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,976
I been practicing a lot.

734
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,804
Okay.

735
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:19,909
I'm pretty good.

736
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:20,910
I can't wait to see that.

737
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:22,221
Yeah.

738
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:23,637
So, uh, you know,

739
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:28,676
it's all in the hips
and wrists, I think.

740
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:29,711
Yep.
Yeah.

741
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:32,439
Oh.

742
00:39:32,473 --> 00:39:33,485
I'd call that a practice shot.

743
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:35,303
Yeah, sure, sure.

744
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:38,237
All right.

745
00:39:38,272 --> 00:39:39,272
So.

746
00:39:40,757 --> 00:39:41,757
Ooh.

747
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,590
All right, it's
time to hand it over.

748
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:46,798
Okay.

749
00:39:46,832 --> 00:39:47,971
Move aside, sir.

750
00:39:49,145 --> 00:39:50,249
So you know what to do?

751
00:39:50,284 --> 00:39:51,181
Yes, I do.

752
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:52,400
'Cause you just gonna, like...

753
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,253
It's like, keep
your eye on the ball

754
00:39:54,288 --> 00:39:57,567
and then swing
around like a circle.

755
00:39:57,602 --> 00:39:58,672
Like that.
Okay.

756
00:39:58,706 --> 00:39:59,569
So I gotta play golf.

757
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:00,398
Yeah.

758
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:01,537
All right.

759
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:03,031
And it's about
getting it in the hole.

760
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:05,886
Okay.

761
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,407
Oh.

762
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:15,620
Very good.

763
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:16,897
All right, come here.

764
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:17,829
Let me show you something.
Really?

765
00:40:17,863 --> 00:40:19,451
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

766
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:20,763
Okay.

767
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,733
All right.
Okay.

768
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:26,803
Relax your body.

769
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,011
Yeah.

770
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:29,875
Okay, squat your
legs, just a little bit.

771
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,463
Just a bit.

772
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:32,360
Don't be weird about it.

773
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:33,500
No, I'm not, I'm-

774
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:34,649
- Just like, relax your body.

775
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:35,916
All right.

776
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,676
Okay, all right.

777
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:38,539
You okay?

778
00:40:38,574 --> 00:40:39,782
- Yeah.
- Okay.

779
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:43,199
And then...

780
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,511
And go for it.

781
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:50,586
That was awesome.

782
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:52,898
Let's go work it.

783
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:55,038
Yeah, all right.

784
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:02,390
Uh...

785
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:04,151
Oh, ooh, there it is.

786
00:41:06,636 --> 00:41:08,673
All right.

787
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:13,781
I got it.

788
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:42,258
Look who it is.

789
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,880
Hannah.

790
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:44,778
Josh.

791
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:46,193
Fatty.

792
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:47,090
Zach.

793
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,713
Melvin.

794
00:41:48,747 --> 00:41:50,680
We should just go inside.

795
00:41:50,715 --> 00:41:52,755
You do everything your
girlfriend tells you to do?

796
00:41:52,786 --> 00:41:55,271
You'd have to be drunk
to be with her.

797
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,305
Or fat.

798
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:01,277
You just go inside.

799
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,450
I'll take care of this.

800
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:03,762
No, I can help you.

801
00:42:03,797 --> 00:42:04,591
No, no, it's okay.

802
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,523
You go inside.

803
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:06,420
They're just kids.

804
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:07,248
I'll be fine.

805
00:42:07,283 --> 00:42:08,077
Are you sure?

806
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,111
Yeah.

807
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:16,844
This ends now.

808
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:22,125
Hey, do you
think we should help him?

809
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,473
No, he needs to
prove his manhood.

810
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:26,508
Okay?

811
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:31,687
Oh my gosh.

812
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:33,378
Hey, get outta here!

813
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:36,243
Hey.

814
00:42:36,277 --> 00:42:37,451
Hey.

815
00:42:37,485 --> 00:42:39,142
Hey, are you okay?

816
00:42:39,177 --> 00:42:40,627
Thank gosh.

817
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:42,214
Did I win?

818
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:43,457
No.

819
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:45,045
Did I protect you?

820
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:46,564
Not one bit, no.

821
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:50,844
Did you have a good night?

822
00:42:58,506 --> 00:42:59,300
You okay?

823
00:42:59,335 --> 00:43:00,335
Yeah.

824
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,381
Thanks.

825
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:24,877
Hold on.

826
00:43:27,984 --> 00:43:28,984
Hey.

827
00:43:32,161 --> 00:43:35,682
I waited for you for
two hours at the Vine.

828
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,824
No, I'm with nobody you know.

829
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,724
Fine.

830
00:43:44,794 --> 00:43:45,588
I gotta go.

831
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,556
Oh, um,

832
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:52,008
take some cupcakes.

833
00:43:54,114 --> 00:43:55,046
My book.

834
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,080
Thanks.

835
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:02,501
I had sort of a good
time tonight, so

836
00:44:03,986 --> 00:44:04,986
thank you.

837
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:13,167
My tooth is missing, right?

838
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,100
Yes.

839
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,930
Cool.

840
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:45,268
Hey.

841
00:44:45,303 --> 00:44:46,235
Hey.

842
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:48,409
Ooh, what happened to you?

843
00:44:48,444 --> 00:44:49,894
It was a really long night.

844
00:44:49,928 --> 00:44:52,690
Are you missing a tooth?

845
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:54,761
Can I have some coffee?

846
00:44:55,762 --> 00:44:56,901
What's the matter?

847
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:58,188
You want me to
call you a dentist?

848
00:44:58,212 --> 00:45:00,180
No, I don't want you
to call me a dentist.

849
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:02,078
I'm freaking out.

850
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:03,321
I'm freaking out.

851
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:05,461
I feel like I just
signed my baby away.

852
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,497
Octocircle are
a great company.

853
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:09,258
I don't care.

854
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:12,399
I keep feeling like
I made the decision.

855
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:15,298
But you're gonna
do so well from this.

856
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,128
I don't care how
well I do, Derek.

857
00:45:17,162 --> 00:45:18,612
I care about my staff.

858
00:45:18,646 --> 00:45:20,131
Hey, check this out.

859
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:21,373
What do you think?

860
00:45:21,408 --> 00:45:22,961
Oh my God.

861
00:45:22,996 --> 00:45:23,790
Yeah.

862
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:25,343
Like Grant Cardone does.

863
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:27,241
You make all this
money in real estate,

864
00:45:27,276 --> 00:45:30,037
then you make even more
money selling books

865
00:45:30,072 --> 00:45:31,694
about how you made
all the money.

866
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,248
We're going straight to the
top of the mountain, babe.

867
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:36,285
Super power couple, me and you.

868
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,148
That's awesome.

869
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:38,114
I'm really, really just-

870
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:39,667
- Let me get you a robe.

871
00:45:39,702 --> 00:45:41,093
Oh my god, are you being
neurotic about dirt again?

872
00:45:41,117 --> 00:45:42,015
You have a problem.

873
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:43,050
Yeah, you're right.

874
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:44,534
But it's so nice out.

875
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:46,502
Okay, are you seriously
blocking me right now?

876
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:47,814
We could go for a walk.

877
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:48,642
I'll get you a robe.

878
00:45:48,676 --> 00:45:49,470
You're serious.

879
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:50,299
Okay, you know what?

880
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,127
Get yourself a robe.

881
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:52,335
I'm leaving.

882
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,267
Hey, I made
reservations for us

883
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:55,269
at the Vine tomorrow night.

884
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:59,480
But maybe get your
tooth fixed first.

885
00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:33,411
Everything is the process.

886
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:38,934
It's the journey from
where we've been,

887
00:46:38,968 --> 00:46:40,832
to where we want to go.

888
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:48,598
Trouble of this chaotic life,

889
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,704
that once you see the light,

890
00:46:50,738 --> 00:46:53,811
you have to step
out and say goodbye.

891
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:59,126
You have to let go to
make room for the new.

892
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:04,062
It's time to face those
fears and rewrite your story.

893
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,237
Not one day, not tomorrow,

894
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:08,514
but today.

895
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:29,329
If you can grow through these
hard times, weather the storm,

896
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:34,610
the process will
have been worth it.

897
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:15,340
I can't believe
Lisa sold the company

898
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,479
to that conglomerate.

899
00:48:17,825 --> 00:48:19,724
You know, I heard from
my cousin over Boone,

900
00:48:19,758 --> 00:48:21,598
they came in and bought up
a whole lot of businesses

901
00:48:21,622 --> 00:48:23,141
and shut them all down.

902
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,453
Why?

903
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:26,386
So they can open up a
mega mall an hour away.

904
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,594
A mega mall.

905
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:30,459
What is it?

906
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:31,287
What is it, Robert?

907
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:32,254
Uh...

908
00:48:32,288 --> 00:48:33,048
Have you heard something?

909
00:48:33,082 --> 00:48:34,428
I may have overheard

910
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:37,880
that Personal Best was
going to be outsourcing

911
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,814
and possibly closing down.

912
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:43,403
But Lisa said that was
a different company,

913
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:47,027
so, uh, I may have got
the wrong information.

914
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:48,511
Lisa.

915
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:49,961
Lisa.

916
00:48:49,996 --> 00:48:53,827
I am grateful for all of
Lisa's campaign support, okay?

917
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:55,794
And everything else
she's done for this town.

918
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:58,694
But don't you see this
deal won't affect her?

919
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,283
Oh, sure, she'll be fine in
some big mansion in the city.

920
00:49:01,317 --> 00:49:02,456
But the rest of us.

921
00:49:02,491 --> 00:49:04,044
It's a ripple effect.

922
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,321
A ripple effect.

923
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,678
That can turn us
into a rust belt.

924
00:49:06,702 --> 00:49:07,875
A rust belt.

925
00:49:09,015 --> 00:49:09,912
That company was the only thing

926
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,018
keeping this town alive, Robert.

927
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,640
It was our lifeblood.

928
00:49:13,674 --> 00:49:15,642
It was our neighborhood's
biggest employer.

929
00:49:15,676 --> 00:49:17,782
Without it, they'll
all move away.

930
00:49:17,816 --> 00:49:19,232
All move away.

931
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:20,899
And there won't be a
town they need a mayor for.

932
00:49:20,923 --> 00:49:21,923
No mayor.

933
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:25,893
I should call her.

934
00:49:27,171 --> 00:49:28,413
What is that?

935
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:31,864
It works.

936
00:49:37,112 --> 00:49:38,906
Hello, Lisa's phone.

937
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:40,632
Yeah, hi, is, uh, Lisa there?

938
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:41,737
Lisa?

939
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,014
No, she's not here right now.

940
00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:44,291
Could I take a message for her?

941
00:49:44,326 --> 00:49:45,775
Yeah, I just need to talk to her

942
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,477
about the Octocircle Mall
that's gonna be built.

943
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,020
Oh. Wow.

944
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,917
I think it could
be detrimental to the city

945
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:51,091
and to the town-
Really?

946
00:49:51,126 --> 00:49:52,817
Oh, she'll definitely
wanna know that.

947
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:53,991
People are gonna lose jobs-

948
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:55,268
- And I'll be sure to tell her.

949
00:49:55,302 --> 00:49:55,820
Oh, great. I
really appreciate it.

950
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:57,442
Bye.

951
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:58,857
Deleted.

952
00:49:58,892 --> 00:50:00,273
Moron.

953
00:50:02,206 --> 00:50:03,276
Hey.

954
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,863
Oh, you left your phone.

955
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:06,934
Anybody call?

956
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:08,246
Nope.

957
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:09,178
Okay.

958
00:50:09,213 --> 00:50:10,593
Hey, the fish looks good.

959
00:50:10,628 --> 00:50:11,422
Ugh.

960
00:50:11,456 --> 00:50:12,664
For you.

961
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:14,125
I've think I'm gonna
have the burger,

962
00:50:14,149 --> 00:50:15,391
since it's our cheat day.

963
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:16,358
Yeah.

964
00:50:16,392 --> 00:50:17,876
Protein style, of course.

965
00:50:17,911 --> 00:50:19,637
Gotta keep Des and Troy fed.

966
00:50:19,671 --> 00:50:20,465
Nope.

967
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,363
Oh, yeah.

968
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:22,364
Please.

969
00:50:22,398 --> 00:50:23,882
She sold us out.

970
00:50:24,883 --> 00:50:26,368
She sold us out.

971
00:50:26,402 --> 00:50:28,542
She's gonna call back.

972
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:31,373
We need to take matters
into our own hands.

973
00:50:31,407 --> 00:50:33,823
We need to take matters
into our own hands.

974
00:50:33,858 --> 00:50:34,824
What?

975
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:35,859
What?

976
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:37,896
Fatty should go?

977
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:39,105
You.

978
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:40,589
You should go.

979
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:42,004
Go where?

980
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:42,832
To Octocircle.

981
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:44,317
To Octocircle.

982
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,283
That's a perfect idea.

983
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:46,733
You should go to Octocircle

984
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:48,700
and you go down and you
tell those fat cats,

985
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:50,771
"This town is not for sale."

986
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:51,806
Why me?

987
00:50:53,395 --> 00:50:54,775
You can do it.

988
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:55,604
You.

989
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:56,708
You can do it.

990
00:50:56,743 --> 00:50:58,124
You're the Fatty.

991
00:51:00,988 --> 00:51:03,508
Fatty,
Fatty, Fatty, Fatty, Fatty.

992
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:04,440
No.

993
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:06,615
She's gonna call back.

994
00:51:06,649 --> 00:51:09,445
Fatty, sometimes the
phone doesn't ring.

995
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,688
But we're called anyway.

996
00:51:10,722 --> 00:51:12,724
You gotta answer
the call, Fatty.

997
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:17,626
Fatty, Fatty,
Fatty, Fatty, Fatty, Fatty.

998
00:51:19,938 --> 00:51:21,595
How was your day?

999
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,252
It was busy.

1000
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:26,945
Just been really busy with all
the stuff that I have to do

1001
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,464
to close the business,

1002
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:32,089
and I thought it was gonna be
really simple, but it's not.

1003
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:35,402
And I may have to
start laying people off

1004
00:51:35,437 --> 00:51:37,473
and I really don't
wanna do that.

1005
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:38,716
I really don't.

1006
00:51:40,856 --> 00:51:43,721
I probably should
have got protein style,

1007
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:47,242
but, hey, I can
afford the calories.

1008
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:48,553
Okay.

1009
00:51:48,588 --> 00:51:50,048
The business stuff,
it's nothing personal.

1010
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:53,282
Hey, besides, I may have scored
a massive real estate deal

1011
00:51:53,317 --> 00:51:54,387
with these guys.

1012
00:51:54,421 --> 00:51:55,733
Really?

1013
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:58,563
Yeah, it's for this
huge piece of land.

1014
00:51:58,598 --> 00:51:59,702
What's it for?

1015
00:51:59,737 --> 00:52:01,152
No, you don't.

1016
00:52:01,187 --> 00:52:02,636
I signed an ND,

1017
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:04,569
and my lips are sealed.

1018
00:52:05,536 --> 00:52:07,365
But if you can keep a secret,

1019
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,575
it's for one of those
massive mega malls.

1020
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,439
It's gonna be huge.

1021
00:52:12,474 --> 00:52:14,752
It's gonna be suit
heaven for me.

1022
00:52:14,786 --> 00:52:16,029
For me.

1023
00:52:16,063 --> 00:52:19,688
Oh, don't ever move
your body like that.

1024
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,875
Hey, did you know
about the mall?

1025
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,153
Ha!

1026
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:37,671
The what?

1027
00:52:37,706 --> 00:52:39,442
The mall that Octocircle
is planning on building.

1028
00:52:39,466 --> 00:52:40,743
Uh, no.

1029
00:52:40,778 --> 00:52:41,675
What's that got to
do with the deal?

1030
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,368
How do people get to the mall?

1031
00:52:44,402 --> 00:52:48,165
Look, Octocircle's plan to
build the mall is right here,

1032
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,857
and the exit ramp for
the 450 highway is here,

1033
00:52:50,891 --> 00:52:51,858
and we are right here.

1034
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:54,309
It goes through the town.

1035
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:55,343
Oh.

1036
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,967
What are we gonna do about it?

1037
00:52:58,002 --> 00:52:59,486
Nothing.

1038
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:01,488
There has to be some
way that we can stop this.

1039
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:03,249
Oh.

1040
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:05,320
Lisa, you can't do anything.

1041
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:06,976
I'm just a small town lawyer.

1042
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:09,876
I may have trained with a guy
who trained with Jackie Chan,

1043
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,672
and these hands might have
been registered lethal weapons

1044
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:14,743
since I was the age of three.

1045
00:53:14,777 --> 00:53:16,848
I might be able to teach a baby

1046
00:53:16,883 --> 00:53:19,541
how to do an entire martial
arts form in two seconds.

1047
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:21,508
What does that
have to do with this?

1048
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:22,751
This specifically?

1049
00:53:22,785 --> 00:53:24,891
My point is we
signed a contract

1050
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:27,790
with one of the biggest
companies in America.

1051
00:53:27,825 --> 00:53:30,897
And that contract is ironclad.

1052
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:32,761
Even if we had a case,

1053
00:53:32,795 --> 00:53:34,532
they would bury us in
so much legal paperwork,

1054
00:53:34,556 --> 00:53:36,247
we'd go on for years.

1055
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:37,662
And by that time,

1056
00:53:37,697 --> 00:53:39,940
they would've
probably built the mall by then.

1057
00:53:39,975 --> 00:53:41,218
They're too big to bring down.

1058
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,391
They're too big to sue.

1059
00:53:42,426 --> 00:53:43,634
They're too big to fail.

1060
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:44,807
I don't care.

1061
00:53:44,842 --> 00:53:46,164
There's gotta be
something that I can do.

1062
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:47,085
You can't do anything.

1063
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,640
Your hands aren't made of steel.

1064
00:53:49,674 --> 00:53:50,951
Then what?

1065
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:52,159
What do we do?

1066
00:53:53,057 --> 00:53:55,370
We can pray for a miracle.

1067
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:19,290
Hi, um,

1068
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:22,742
I would like to have a meeting
with the head of Octocircle?

1069
00:54:22,776 --> 00:54:24,433
Do you have an
appointment, sir?

1070
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:25,503
Uh, no, no.

1071
00:54:25,538 --> 00:54:26,953
No, I don't.

1072
00:54:26,987 --> 00:54:30,025
Well, I can't let you in
unless you have an appointment.

1073
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,510
Oh, uh, can I
make an appointment?

1074
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:33,442
Certainly, sir.

1075
00:54:33,477 --> 00:54:35,030
You can call the help desk.

1076
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,998
Yeah, I've been calling
them like a hundred times.

1077
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:42,417
Well, apparently we
can't help you.

1078
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:43,728
You sure?

1079
00:54:46,973 --> 00:54:47,973
Oh, uh...

1080
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:52,565
Uh, okay.

1081
00:56:19,341 --> 00:56:21,447
Is this your food?

1082
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:23,414
It's not mine.

1083
00:56:25,105 --> 00:56:27,418
I mean, it's
just sitting here.

1084
00:56:27,453 --> 00:56:28,350
All right.

1085
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,903
Don't want it to go to waste.

1086
00:56:29,938 --> 00:56:31,595
I can't have gluten.

1087
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:43,089
I beat Jordan
Spieth by two strokes

1088
00:56:43,123 --> 00:56:43,917
wearing this.

1089
00:56:43,952 --> 00:56:44,884
That's cool.

1090
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:46,403
Wait, wait, wait!

1091
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:47,932
I am so sorry, Mr. Peters,
he just slipped right by me.

1092
00:56:47,956 --> 00:56:49,129
No, no, I-

1093
00:56:49,164 --> 00:56:50,521
- You know, security
is on its way.

1094
00:56:50,545 --> 00:56:51,442
I represent the
workers of Personal Best.

1095
00:56:51,477 --> 00:56:53,686
Carol, Carol, it's fine.

1096
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,721
We'll take it from here.

1097
00:56:54,756 --> 00:56:55,756
Okay.

1098
00:56:56,654 --> 00:56:57,552
And get my clubs ready.

1099
00:56:57,586 --> 00:56:59,070
I have a tee time in 20.

1100
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:01,935
Seriously, who hired her?

1101
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,247
And you are?

1102
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:05,007
My name is Fatty Melvin

1103
00:57:05,042 --> 00:57:07,665
and I am a motivational speaker.

1104
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,149
Really?

1105
00:57:09,184 --> 00:57:11,324
What, like Tony Robbins?

1106
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:12,912
Not quite.

1107
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:15,052
I mean, I'm still
working my way up.

1108
00:57:15,086 --> 00:57:16,605
Would you like a donut?

1109
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,606
No, no, I'm fine, thanks.

1110
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:19,021
Maybe two donuts?

1111
00:57:19,056 --> 00:57:21,265
Half a dozen?

1112
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:24,199
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1113
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,822
Carol, bring our
hungry guest some donuts.

1114
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:29,560
It's just that I
wanted to talk to you

1115
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:30,768
about the fact that you're
closing down the factory

1116
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:32,587
and the fact that you're
gonna be laying off

1117
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:33,864
all these workers and-

1118
00:57:33,898 --> 00:57:35,969
- I don't understand,
Mr. Melvin.

1119
00:57:36,004 --> 00:57:37,868
It is staying in the town.

1120
00:57:37,902 --> 00:57:40,111
What wild conspiracies
have you been looking up

1121
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:41,147
on the internet?

1122
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:42,355
I, uh,

1123
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:45,047
I don't actually have
the internet web.

1124
00:57:45,082 --> 00:57:46,670
Mm.

1125
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:47,947
Get him a couple of donuts,

1126
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:49,293
er, or five.

1127
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:53,539
I don't want any.

1128
00:57:53,573 --> 00:57:54,573
Um...

1129
00:57:57,439 --> 00:58:00,925
It's just that, um,

1130
00:58:03,169 --> 00:58:04,170
I heard you.

1131
00:58:04,998 --> 00:58:06,517
What did you say?

1132
00:58:06,552 --> 00:58:08,243
In the Personal
Best restrooms,

1133
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,934
I overheard you say.

1134
00:58:11,418 --> 00:58:12,834
Whoa, this guy,

1135
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:16,700
following me into
the men's room.

1136
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:20,358
That's something.

1137
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:23,361
This dude walks into our offices

1138
00:58:23,396 --> 00:58:26,848
and says out loud he's
been listening to me

1139
00:58:26,882 --> 00:58:28,435
in a men's room.

1140
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:29,713
Wow.

1141
00:58:29,747 --> 00:58:31,587
- No, no, no, it's not-
- Can you believe that?

1142
00:58:32,336 --> 00:58:33,820
Let me tell you something,

1143
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,684
you low life piece of trash.

1144
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:37,686
You are in a room full
of lawyers right now.

1145
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:39,205
I would be very cautious

1146
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:41,794
about throwing around
wild accusations.

1147
00:58:41,828 --> 00:58:42,828
Understand?

1148
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:48,870
Well, okay then.

1149
00:58:50,388 --> 00:58:53,944
I don't know what it is you
think you heard, Mr. Melvin,

1150
00:58:53,978 --> 00:58:56,774
but you have now successfully
made me late for my golf game.

1151
00:58:56,809 --> 00:58:59,156
Carol, do I like to be
late for my golf game?

1152
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,847
No, sir.

1153
00:59:04,195 --> 00:59:05,507
Don't validate his parking.

1154
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,715
Carol, my clubs.

1155
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:07,958
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1156
00:59:07,992 --> 00:59:09,753
You promised you
wouldn't do this.

1157
00:59:09,787 --> 00:59:12,065
You, well, you, you,

1158
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,344
you promised Lisa that you
wouldn't sell off the company,

1159
00:59:15,379 --> 00:59:17,968
that you would keep all
the people working there.

1160
00:59:18,002 --> 00:59:20,695
I mean, you're
just lying to her.

1161
00:59:20,729 --> 00:59:23,283
You're lying to the whole town.

1162
00:59:25,147 --> 00:59:26,148
Stay here.

1163
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,639
What you need to
understand, Fatty,

1164
00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:37,850
is the economy works on the
basis of supply and demand.

1165
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:39,127
So what I'm saying, Fatty,

1166
00:59:39,161 --> 00:59:42,440
is advertisement
creates the demand,

1167
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:46,479
the need, the want
for something more.

1168
00:59:46,513 --> 00:59:48,792
And if you can convince
people they need something

1169
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:50,448
they didn't even
know they wanted,

1170
00:59:50,483 --> 00:59:54,763
well, that's just gravy on top.

1171
00:59:56,282 --> 01:00:00,597
At Octocircle, we create
more, we give people stuff.

1172
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:02,771
And everybody wants more stuff.

1173
01:00:02,806 --> 01:00:04,255
And, hey,

1174
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:06,741
if you can create it cheaper
somewhere else overseas,

1175
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:07,983
well, that's even better.

1176
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:10,814
We all get more, and
we all get happy.

1177
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:13,965
So you're saying we should
all be working multiple jobs

1178
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:15,370
just so we can buy more stuff?

1179
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,027
That's what's gonna
make us happy?

1180
01:00:17,061 --> 01:00:20,202
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

1181
01:00:24,344 --> 01:00:25,344
Watch out.

1182
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,388
Fatty, you're probably
one of those guys that

1183
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:37,219
think that stupid
t-shirt slogan,

1184
01:00:38,462 --> 01:00:41,430
like "Money can't
buy you happiness,"

1185
01:00:41,465 --> 01:00:43,640
is actually true, right?

1186
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:48,472
Well, Fatty, I'm pretty happy.

1187
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:52,994
Hey,
man, we're sorry about this.

1188
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:54,247
We heard what you said in there.

1189
01:00:54,271 --> 01:00:55,652
Yeah, we did, you know.

1190
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:57,619
I didn't really say anything.

1191
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,207
Can't believe that my dad

1192
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:00,933
got laid off after
30 years on a job.

1193
01:01:00,967 --> 01:01:02,451
You believe that?
Oh, that's scary.

1194
01:01:02,486 --> 01:01:03,526
So we know what it's like.

1195
01:01:03,556 --> 01:01:05,006
Yeah, we do.

1196
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,629
And, well, that's why it makes
it hard for us to do this.

1197
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,768
Oh, well, gotta go.

1198
01:01:08,803 --> 01:01:09,803
Whoa.

1199
01:01:11,288 --> 01:01:13,014
They don't want you here, man.

1200
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:16,224
Yeah, but
we respect you for trying.

1201
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:18,122
Thanks for the cookies.

1202
01:02:03,443 --> 01:02:04,443
Hi.

1203
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,653
I sent you a bunch of texts.

1204
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:07,654
I was trying to
get a hold of you.

1205
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,139
Oh, uh...

1206
01:02:09,173 --> 01:02:11,003
Is that your phone?

1207
01:02:11,037 --> 01:02:13,902
Yeah, it's a vintage.

1208
01:02:13,937 --> 01:02:16,594
That explains it.

1209
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:17,699
You wanna sit?

1210
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,804
Oh, thanks.

1211
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,707
This is my grandma.

1212
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,984
She was so pretty.

1213
01:02:27,019 --> 01:02:30,436
We used to make
cupcakes together

1214
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:34,060
and we'd pass them around
to all the neighbors.

1215
01:02:34,095 --> 01:02:35,890
It wasn't about money
or anything like that.

1216
01:02:35,924 --> 01:02:36,924
It was just,

1217
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,826
like if people were sick
or they had lost their jobs

1218
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,413
or just had a baby.

1219
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:46,383
It's just the best
feeling in the world

1220
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:48,247
to see people's faces.

1221
01:02:51,353 --> 01:02:54,184
And then my grandma died and
I had to move to a new school,

1222
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:58,533
and all the kids there just
started calling me fat.

1223
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:03,055
And it was just really bad.

1224
01:03:03,089 --> 01:03:04,573
And my dad left us,

1225
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:08,750
and he left us like in this
really bad financial state and

1226
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:14,514
my super skinny mom was
trying to find a new husband

1227
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:16,447
and so she put me on
every diet there was

1228
01:03:16,482 --> 01:03:19,623
because she said she couldn't
have a chubby daughter.

1229
01:03:19,657 --> 01:03:21,142
And I just remember
feeling determined

1230
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:24,904
to solve my family's
financial difficulties.

1231
01:03:26,388 --> 01:03:28,666
And so I lost the weight
and I started making money

1232
01:03:28,701 --> 01:03:32,256
and I built this company
from the ground up.

1233
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,500
That's how all this started.

1234
01:03:34,534 --> 01:03:35,984
And I remember just,

1235
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:38,366
like telling myself, as
I was working so hard,

1236
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,232
like, eventually one
day I would be happy.

1237
01:03:42,266 --> 01:03:46,684
And, like, no matter how
much I eat, I'm just hungry.

1238
01:03:48,134 --> 01:03:51,551
Now I have more money than I
could ever think about having,

1239
01:03:51,586 --> 01:03:56,142
and the only thing that
I feel inside is empty.

1240
01:03:56,177 --> 01:03:57,109
You know, whenever
you get those, like,

1241
01:03:57,143 --> 01:03:58,423
really bad knots in your stomach

1242
01:03:58,455 --> 01:04:01,182
and you keep telling yourself,

1243
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:02,666
I just keep pushing forward

1244
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,944
and just pushing it down
and pushing it down,

1245
01:04:04,979 --> 01:04:07,326
then it's eventually
gonna go away.

1246
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,846
But then it doesn't.

1247
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,365
I had to lay people off today.

1248
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,782
My favorite thing about my job
was giving other people jobs.

1249
01:04:15,817 --> 01:04:18,130
That's all I wanted to do.

1250
01:04:18,164 --> 01:04:20,926
And today I had to
call those same people

1251
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,548
and take their jobs away.

1252
01:04:22,582 --> 01:04:23,582
I did that.

1253
01:04:26,034 --> 01:04:28,934
I even have to lay
our janitor off.

1254
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:31,695
By the way,

1255
01:04:31,729 --> 01:04:34,180
do you know who
Robert Melvin is?

1256
01:04:34,215 --> 01:04:35,837
'Cause I was talking
to my payroll today

1257
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,496
and she said that the
motivational speaker that came in

1258
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:40,773
was Robert Melvin,

1259
01:04:40,807 --> 01:04:42,026
and I know the janitor
has the same last name.

1260
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,741
I'm just really confused.

1261
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:47,711
I'm Robert Melvin.

1262
01:04:49,368 --> 01:04:51,232
My brother is James Melvin.

1263
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:52,198
What?

1264
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:53,061
Yeah.

1265
01:04:53,096 --> 01:04:55,236
I'm your janitor.

1266
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:58,101
I've been your janitor
for five years.

1267
01:04:58,135 --> 01:04:59,654
I've been...

1268
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,183
I've been watching you for
five years and just love-

1269
01:05:01,207 --> 01:05:03,175
- You're not a
motivational speaker?

1270
01:05:03,209 --> 01:05:04,314
No, no, no, I, I-

1271
01:05:04,348 --> 01:05:05,971
- You said all those things?

1272
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:06,937
Why would you do that?

1273
01:05:06,972 --> 01:05:07,972
Well, I...

1274
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:09,940
I liked you.

1275
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:12,287
You like me?

1276
01:05:12,322 --> 01:05:14,289
I freely liked you.

1277
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:22,711
What are you doing here?

1278
01:05:22,746 --> 01:05:24,541
Mayor Bob told
me you were here.

1279
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:27,233
I wanted to invite you
to step up and join me,

1280
01:05:27,268 --> 01:05:29,235
live in the "Mountain Top Life."

1281
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:30,996
I've seen a lot
of deals go down,

1282
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:34,896
and you are not gonna get
a better deal than this.

1283
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,279
Uh, look, I'm not really
interested in any deal.

1284
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:41,730
I've been thinking about
me and you a lot lately.

1285
01:05:41,765 --> 01:05:43,387
I don't even know who you are.

1286
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:44,595
Who are you?

1287
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:47,150
Nobody wants you here.

1288
01:05:56,538 --> 01:05:59,541
Here.

1289
01:06:06,307 --> 01:06:07,549
This is embarrassing.

1290
01:06:07,584 --> 01:06:08,999
I don't care.

1291
01:06:09,034 --> 01:06:11,415
I want the world to know.

1292
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,039
Don't ever spin
like that again.

1293
01:06:14,073 --> 01:06:15,109
Lisa Cohen.

1294
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:17,835
Are you serious?

1295
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,699
About as serious as I am

1296
01:06:19,734 --> 01:06:22,288
of any of my real estate deals.

1297
01:07:57,866 --> 01:08:02,112
Our true self, the
person God created you to be,

1298
01:08:02,147 --> 01:08:04,252
has been buried
under so much rubble

1299
01:08:04,287 --> 01:08:06,668
in this chaotic life,

1300
01:08:06,703 --> 01:08:08,774
that once you see the light,

1301
01:08:08,808 --> 01:08:10,396
you have to step out

1302
01:08:10,431 --> 01:08:12,985
and say goodbye.

1303
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:17,162
You have to let go to
make room for the new.

1304
01:08:17,196 --> 01:08:22,132
It's time to face those
fears and rewrite your story.

1305
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:24,307
Not one day, not tomorrow,

1306
01:08:25,618 --> 01:08:26,618
but today.

1307
01:08:27,758 --> 01:08:29,864
You're not here, James.

1308
01:08:34,006 --> 01:08:37,251
You don't know
what this is like.

1309
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:43,084
Son of a...

1310
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,087
Oh, spasm.

1311
01:08:47,951 --> 01:08:48,745
Here, here, here.

1312
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:50,229
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1313
01:08:50,264 --> 01:08:51,472
Okay.

1314
01:08:53,474 --> 01:08:54,958
Listen,

1315
01:08:54,992 --> 01:08:56,235
we have a problem.

1316
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:57,063
I feel it.

1317
01:08:57,098 --> 01:08:58,341
No.

1318
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:00,481
There's been a leak.

1319
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:02,138
No, not that.

1320
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:04,036
They know about the mall.

1321
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:05,969
They know about the off-ramp.

1322
01:09:06,003 --> 01:09:08,247
How did this happen?

1323
01:09:08,282 --> 01:09:10,215
I don't know.

1324
01:09:10,249 --> 01:09:14,322
Well, I need you to find
someone to fix this quickly.

1325
01:09:14,357 --> 01:09:15,944
Do you think you
can find someone?

1326
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:18,671
Or am I gonna have to take
matters into my own hands?

1327
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:20,880
I, uh,

1328
01:09:20,915 --> 01:09:22,917
I have somebody in mind.

1329
01:09:28,094 --> 01:09:29,165
Okay, okay, okay.

1330
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:29,993
Breathe through it.

1331
01:09:30,027 --> 01:09:30,856
Okay.

1332
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:32,306
I'll guide you.

1333
01:09:33,203 --> 01:09:34,031
Lower.

1334
01:09:34,066 --> 01:09:35,032
Lower.

1335
01:09:35,067 --> 01:09:36,067
Yeah.

1336
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:03,992
Hey, hey.

1337
01:10:04,027 --> 01:10:04,924
Lisa?

1338
01:10:04,959 --> 01:10:06,409
I was on my way to see a client

1339
01:10:06,443 --> 01:10:08,076
and thought I'd come by
and see how you were doing.

1340
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,239
I wanna fight them.

1341
01:10:09,274 --> 01:10:10,309
I know, I know, I know.

1342
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:12,104
But you can't.

1343
01:10:12,138 --> 01:10:13,381
Legally speaking,

1344
01:10:13,416 --> 01:10:15,521
you signed a conflict
of interest agreement.

1345
01:10:15,556 --> 01:10:18,455
There's gotta be
something that we can do.

1346
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:19,490
Well,

1347
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:24,116
the council meeting, perhaps.

1348
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:24,944
Okay.

1349
01:10:24,979 --> 01:10:26,463
The only way

1350
01:10:26,498 --> 01:10:29,708
would be if you were to get
the whole town to say no.

1351
01:10:29,742 --> 01:10:31,917
But that's nearly impossible,
given the timeframe.

1352
01:10:31,951 --> 01:10:33,401
Nothing is impossible.

1353
01:10:33,436 --> 01:10:35,414
And, you know, nobody in this
town even wants them here.

1354
01:10:35,438 --> 01:10:37,371
No one in town is in town.

1355
01:10:37,405 --> 01:10:40,339
They're looking for new jobs.

1356
01:10:40,374 --> 01:10:42,790
It might be time
to give up, Lisa.

1357
01:10:42,824 --> 01:10:43,963
Is that new?

1358
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:47,311
Oh, uh,

1359
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:49,486
yeah.

1360
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:51,833
Look, they have a great
dental and health plan.

1361
01:10:51,868 --> 01:10:54,526
They're not all that bad.

1362
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,182
Look, I got kids.

1363
01:10:56,217 --> 01:10:57,149
Yeah.

1364
01:10:57,183 --> 01:10:59,289
A lot of people have kids.

1365
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:21,553
Hey, hey, Fatso Melvin.

1366
01:11:21,587 --> 01:11:22,830
- Fatty.
- Fatty.

1367
01:11:22,864 --> 01:11:25,246
Fatty Melvin, the next
Tony Robbins right here.

1368
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,524
Fatty, Fatso. Who cares?

1369
01:11:27,559 --> 01:11:29,112
We're all friends here, right?

1370
01:11:29,146 --> 01:11:30,355
Um...

1371
01:11:30,389 --> 01:11:33,323
You, me, Janet, and 10 lawyers.

1372
01:11:33,358 --> 01:11:35,808
Would you mind if we, um...

1373
01:11:35,843 --> 01:11:36,706
Come in?

1374
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,740
Oh, okay.

1375
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:44,679
Okay, ha-ha, here we are.

1376
01:11:45,956 --> 01:11:49,339
Alrighty.

1377
01:11:49,374 --> 01:11:51,997
You look like a sporty guy, huh?

1378
01:11:53,032 --> 01:11:54,862
Let me ask you a question.

1379
01:11:54,896 --> 01:11:56,726
How often would you
say you exercise?

1380
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,486
Well, about three times.

1381
01:11:58,521 --> 01:11:59,349
A week?

1382
01:11:59,384 --> 01:12:00,454
A month?

1383
01:12:00,488 --> 01:12:02,732
No, I've given you my answer.

1384
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:03,766
Great.

1385
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:06,529
Let's get him the clubs.

1386
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:10,567
Uh, yeah, I, I,

1387
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:11,948
I don't really need these.

1388
01:12:11,982 --> 01:12:15,261
Yeah, kill the clubs.

1389
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:17,678
Yeah, you're probably
not a golfing man,

1390
01:12:17,712 --> 01:12:19,611
but you seem more like a, uh...

1391
01:12:19,645 --> 01:12:20,405
Football.

1392
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:21,337
Football guy.

1393
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:22,165
That's right, yeah, football.

1394
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:23,097
You play some football?

1395
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:24,063
A little bit in high school.

1396
01:12:24,098 --> 01:12:24,892
Yeah?

1397
01:12:24,926 --> 01:12:25,720
I can tell.

1398
01:12:25,755 --> 01:12:27,032
Well, yeah, uh,

1399
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:28,596
like the coach really
wanted me on the team,

1400
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,311
but, uh, he kind of
put me on the side

1401
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,623
and so-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1402
01:12:31,657 --> 01:12:32,555
That's real interesting.

1403
01:12:32,589 --> 01:12:33,797
Let's get right to it, Fatso.

1404
01:12:33,832 --> 01:12:35,661
- Fatty.
- Fatty.

1405
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:36,696
You...

1406
01:12:37,698 --> 01:12:39,562
You care about this
town, don't you?

1407
01:12:39,596 --> 01:12:40,701
Yes, I, I, I do.

1408
01:12:40,735 --> 01:12:42,461
Yes, I respect that.

1409
01:12:42,496 --> 01:12:43,842
I can tell.

1410
01:12:43,876 --> 01:12:45,809
You have this special quality,

1411
01:12:45,844 --> 01:12:48,640
and people want to listen
to you when you speak.

1412
01:12:48,674 --> 01:12:49,917
In fact, Fatso-

1413
01:12:49,951 --> 01:12:51,263
- Fatty.
- Fatty, when you, uh,

1414
01:12:51,297 --> 01:12:53,783
you came to the
office the other day,

1415
01:12:53,817 --> 01:12:55,647
your words spoke to me.

1416
01:12:57,338 --> 01:12:58,995
Now, a lot of people
think that Octocircle

1417
01:12:59,029 --> 01:13:01,825
is this faceless
corporate Goliath

1418
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:04,034
that wants to come in and
crush everything in its path.

1419
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:05,519
That is not true.

1420
01:13:05,553 --> 01:13:06,737
In fact, that couldn't
be further from the truth

1421
01:13:06,761 --> 01:13:08,729
because we care.

1422
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:10,627
We care about...

1423
01:13:10,662 --> 01:13:12,180
- Education.
- Education.

1424
01:13:12,215 --> 01:13:14,217
We care deeply about...

1425
01:13:14,251 --> 01:13:15,805
- Environment.
- Environment.

1426
01:13:15,839 --> 01:13:16,944
And also...

1427
01:13:16,978 --> 01:13:19,187
- The troops.
- The troops.

1428
01:13:21,604 --> 01:13:23,122
We care about the crap

1429
01:13:23,157 --> 01:13:27,679
that little Americans like you
think about on a daily basis.

1430
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:29,819
Let me ask you a question.

1431
01:13:29,853 --> 01:13:31,407
How do you spell jobs?

1432
01:13:31,441 --> 01:13:32,338
Uh, J-

1433
01:13:32,373 --> 01:13:33,719
- Opportunity, that's right.

1434
01:13:33,754 --> 01:13:34,755
Opportunity.

1435
01:13:34,789 --> 01:13:36,204
You have the capacity within you

1436
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,206
to create thousands of jobs.

1437
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:39,725
I mean, the mall itself

1438
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,348
will create 10 times more
employment opportunities

1439
01:13:42,383 --> 01:13:43,522
than Personal Best

1440
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:45,490
and the entire
town currently has.

1441
01:13:45,524 --> 01:13:46,629
And listen, Fatso-

1442
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:47,871
- Fatty.

1443
01:13:47,906 --> 01:13:49,297
Fatty, it's not
just any kind of jobs,

1444
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:52,013
this is high-paying
jobs with benefits.

1445
01:13:52,048 --> 01:13:54,084
And we know that that
is important to you

1446
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:55,120
and it's important to us.

1447
01:13:55,154 --> 01:13:56,052
If it's important to this town

1448
01:13:56,086 --> 01:13:57,018
and it's important to you,

1449
01:13:57,053 --> 01:13:57,847
it's important to Octocircle.

1450
01:13:57,881 --> 01:13:58,675
Who's with me, Janet?

1451
01:13:58,710 --> 01:13:59,504
Yep.

1452
01:13:59,538 --> 01:14:00,297
Absolutely.

1453
01:14:00,332 --> 01:14:01,816
So I am here.

1454
01:14:01,851 --> 01:14:03,784
I am here, Fatso-

1455
01:14:03,818 --> 01:14:05,026
- Fatty.
- Fatty.

1456
01:14:05,061 --> 01:14:06,821
To ask for your help.

1457
01:14:11,032 --> 01:14:13,345
From one patriot to another,

1458
01:14:15,692 --> 01:14:18,074
we need your backing on this.

1459
01:14:19,282 --> 01:14:20,525
I, uh...

1460
01:14:20,559 --> 01:14:22,181
So how about it, Fatty?

1461
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:24,667
Can you help motivate this town

1462
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:26,358
to make the best choice,

1463
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:27,635
the right choice,

1464
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:28,981
the only choice?

1465
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,609
I want you to
take a look outside.

1466
01:14:41,787 --> 01:14:44,756
As a small token
of our appreciation

1467
01:14:45,895 --> 01:14:48,656
of your support of this town,

1468
01:14:48,691 --> 01:14:50,313
we would like nothing more

1469
01:14:50,347 --> 01:14:53,454
than to see you in that
bad boy right there.

1470
01:14:56,871 --> 01:14:58,424
Suits you to a tee.

1471
01:15:11,472 --> 01:15:12,266
Hi.

1472
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,681
Oh, hi.

1473
01:15:15,683 --> 01:15:17,720
I've read your book.

1474
01:15:17,754 --> 01:15:18,790
Hm.

1475
01:15:18,824 --> 01:15:21,482
It's really good, Robert.

1476
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,208
Pretty good for
a janitor, huh?

1477
01:15:23,242 --> 01:15:24,623
It's good for anybody.

1478
01:15:28,765 --> 01:15:31,216
Are you thinking about
working for Octocircle?

1479
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:35,772
I'm really sorry.

1480
01:15:36,773 --> 01:15:38,395
I know I got us into this mess,

1481
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:42,883
and it was a really big
mistake selling Personal Best.

1482
01:15:44,505 --> 01:15:46,472
It doesn't have to be like this.

1483
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:47,888
Look, they're not that bad.

1484
01:15:47,922 --> 01:15:50,442
I mean, they're creating
thousands of jobs for this town,

1485
01:15:50,476 --> 01:15:51,961
so, you know.

1486
01:15:51,995 --> 01:15:55,412
Aren't you about following
your true calling in life?

1487
01:15:55,447 --> 01:15:57,794
Isn't that what you always say?

1488
01:15:57,829 --> 01:16:01,384
You know, "Not one
day, but today"?

1489
01:16:01,418 --> 01:16:02,948
You know, if you end up
working for Octocircle,

1490
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:06,044
you're gonna be
stuck with no choice

1491
01:16:06,078 --> 01:16:09,254
under a corporation that
doesn't even care about you.

1492
01:16:10,773 --> 01:16:14,431
Well, that's what it was
like for me at Personal Best.

1493
01:16:14,466 --> 01:16:15,640
At least these guys,

1494
01:16:15,674 --> 01:16:19,126
they have medical and
dental and a 401k.

1495
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,413
And they give me
the opportunities

1496
01:16:20,437 --> 01:16:22,647
to climb that corporate ladder

1497
01:16:22,681 --> 01:16:25,995
to one day maybe even manage
my own Octocircle franchise.

1498
01:16:26,029 --> 01:16:27,237
Seriously.

1499
01:16:27,272 --> 01:16:29,377
You don't buy into
all that junk.

1500
01:16:29,412 --> 01:16:31,621
You know it's a lie.

1501
01:16:31,656 --> 01:16:33,761
It's a cold, dark,
scary world out there.

1502
01:16:33,796 --> 01:16:35,314
Isn't that what you told me?

1503
01:16:35,349 --> 01:16:37,040
I don't have all these
great opportunities.

1504
01:16:37,075 --> 01:16:38,904
I've gotta do what I can.

1505
01:16:38,939 --> 01:16:42,149
And this is a great
opportunity for me.

1506
01:16:43,081 --> 01:16:45,014
This is a really good book,

1507
01:16:45,048 --> 01:16:47,395
and you are very talented.

1508
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:49,605
And you could help
a lot of people.

1509
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:52,055
This is not how it's
supposed to end.

1510
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:54,161
We can change the story.

1511
01:16:54,195 --> 01:16:55,818
We can.

1512
01:16:55,852 --> 01:16:58,130
That's what you always said.

1513
01:17:00,339 --> 01:17:02,214
What, you talking about
the city council meeting?

1514
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:04,067
Yes, listen, if we
get enough no votes,

1515
01:17:04,102 --> 01:17:05,828
they will have to stop the plan

1516
01:17:05,862 --> 01:17:07,657
for the Octocircle
Mall proposal.

1517
01:17:07,692 --> 01:17:09,003
Well, why don't you go?

1518
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:10,764
Legally I can't go.

1519
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:12,627
Okay.

1520
01:17:13,594 --> 01:17:16,632
I'm also getting
married the same day.

1521
01:17:18,081 --> 01:17:19,565
Congratulations.

1522
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:21,740
But you can.

1523
01:17:23,569 --> 01:17:26,883
You can go and convince
them to vote no.

1524
01:17:27,919 --> 01:17:28,919
Yeah.

1525
01:17:30,093 --> 01:17:31,267
I am gonna go.

1526
01:17:32,164 --> 01:17:33,164
Really?

1527
01:17:34,822 --> 01:17:36,548
I'm gonna vote yes.

1528
01:17:45,695 --> 01:17:48,180
You should finish your book.

1529
01:17:50,355 --> 01:17:53,082
I have one more
question for you.

1530
01:17:54,324 --> 01:17:57,534
Are you really happy
with your story now?

1531
01:18:18,521 --> 01:18:20,074
Dad?

1532
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:21,627
New motor home.

1533
01:18:21,662 --> 01:18:24,009
Yeah, it's like 33
feet or something.

1534
01:18:24,044 --> 01:18:28,600
It's got satellite TV and
internet web and

1535
01:18:28,634 --> 01:18:30,153
leather seats and stuff.

1536
01:18:30,188 --> 01:18:31,430
It's pretty cool.

1537
01:18:31,465 --> 01:18:34,571
I still prefer
the old classic.

1538
01:18:34,606 --> 01:18:36,746
What are you doing here?

1539
01:18:38,058 --> 01:18:39,369
I quit drinking.

1540
01:18:39,404 --> 01:18:41,095
Oh, that's great.

1541
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,028
It's been two weeks.

1542
01:18:43,063 --> 01:18:44,547
Congratulations.

1543
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:52,589
Robert, I know I haven't
always been there for you.

1544
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,016
I got so caught up in
trying to make it work out,

1545
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,455
that I missed it.

1546
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:00,459
Life goes by so fast.

1547
01:19:00,494 --> 01:19:02,013
And before you know it,

1548
01:19:02,047 --> 01:19:05,775
you wake up one day and you
realize you never lived it.

1549
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:07,639
Your brother understood that.

1550
01:19:07,673 --> 01:19:09,745
He was never truly happy,

1551
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,231
again, after Heather left him.

1552
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:17,442
The night your brother died,

1553
01:19:17,476 --> 01:19:20,445
I saw him alone in
his brand new car,

1554
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:23,379
before you arrived.

1555
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,969
I saw him sitting there

1556
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:31,801
and he was the saddest
I've ever seen him.

1557
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:35,218
I remember getting angry at him,

1558
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:38,670
thinking to my myself,
"Why is he so sad?

1559
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:41,742
He's got everything."

1560
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,262
I just couldn't understand it.

1561
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:48,024
You didn't know how
he felt, I mean...

1562
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:49,198
I pushed him

1563
01:19:51,303 --> 01:19:52,960
to get where he was,

1564
01:19:54,203 --> 01:19:55,894
and he was miserable.

1565
01:19:58,552 --> 01:19:59,552
I'm sorry.

1566
01:20:00,278 --> 01:20:01,451
I am so sorry.

1567
01:20:03,005 --> 01:20:05,179
It's okay, Dad.

1568
01:20:05,214 --> 01:20:06,214
It's okay.

1569
01:20:08,631 --> 01:20:10,840
Robert, you can fix this.

1570
01:20:13,325 --> 01:20:17,398
You can do what your
brother always wanted to do.

1571
01:20:20,022 --> 01:20:21,609
Find happiness.

1572
01:20:46,117 --> 01:20:50,811
What is the greatest thing
we can achieve in this life?

1573
01:20:53,745 --> 01:20:56,955
Maybe you were
wondering this yourself.

1574
01:20:58,715 --> 01:20:59,715
What is it?

1575
01:21:01,546 --> 01:21:02,546
Is it love?

1576
01:21:05,377 --> 01:21:06,482
If it's love,

1577
01:21:07,759 --> 01:21:10,244
why do we fail at it so often?

1578
01:21:36,615 --> 01:21:38,031
Hey,

1579
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:39,625
you're the fat guy
from the golf course.

1580
01:21:40,585 --> 01:21:42,311
You read my book?

1581
01:21:42,345 --> 01:21:43,277
Uh, no.

1582
01:21:43,312 --> 01:21:44,347
What's your name again?

1583
01:21:44,382 --> 01:21:46,142
Uh, Fatty Melvin.

1584
01:21:46,177 --> 01:21:48,420
And you're a
motivational speaker?

1585
01:21:48,455 --> 01:21:49,697
Uh, yeah.

1586
01:21:49,732 --> 01:21:51,630
Well, good for
you, Fatty Melfy.

1587
01:21:51,665 --> 01:21:53,253
Frank asked me to speak to you

1588
01:21:53,287 --> 01:21:55,151
and make sure we're
all good for today.

1589
01:21:55,186 --> 01:21:57,050
You got your speech
all worked out?

1590
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:58,084
Uh-huh.

1591
01:21:59,086 --> 01:22:00,225
Can I see it?

1592
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:01,054
It's, uh,

1593
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:03,401
it's kind of personal.

1594
01:22:03,435 --> 01:22:05,161
Is that your speech?

1595
01:22:05,196 --> 01:22:06,507
Nope.

1596
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,864
Why don't you show
me what's in the box?

1597
01:22:07,888 --> 01:22:09,096
No.

1598
01:22:09,131 --> 01:22:11,340
Why don't you show
me what's in the box?

1599
01:22:11,374 --> 01:22:12,168
Huh?

1600
01:22:12,203 --> 01:22:13,031
No, no.

1601
01:22:13,066 --> 01:22:14,446
Oh, yeah.

1602
01:22:14,481 --> 01:22:15,378
Three years of MMA
training is gonna make you

1603
01:22:15,413 --> 01:22:16,621
show me what's in the box.

1604
01:22:16,655 --> 01:22:18,002
That's not good.

1605
01:22:18,036 --> 01:22:19,279
What happened?

1606
01:22:19,313 --> 01:22:20,566
Yeah, man, you need
to go deal with that.

1607
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:21,774
Uh-uh, I dealed
with the last one.

1608
01:22:21,798 --> 01:22:22,983
No, no, no, I
did the last one.

1609
01:22:23,007 --> 01:22:24,284
You remember...

1610
01:22:25,285 --> 01:22:26,182
I'm getting the hooks in.

1611
01:22:26,217 --> 01:22:27,494
I'm getting the hooks in.

1612
01:22:27,528 --> 01:22:28,357
You know what?

1613
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:29,220
Paper, Rock, Scissors.

1614
01:22:29,254 --> 01:22:30,048
All right?

1615
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:30,980
Come on.

1616
01:22:31,015 --> 01:22:32,295
Come on, it's the only fair way.

1617
01:22:34,673 --> 01:22:36,365
How about you go to sleep

1618
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:38,574
so I can go to my wedding.

1619
01:22:38,608 --> 01:22:39,402
Huh?

1620
01:22:39,437 --> 01:22:40,714
She doesn't...

1621
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:42,440
She doesn't know you
work for Octocircle.

1622
01:22:42,474 --> 01:22:44,166
What's that got
to do with you?

1623
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,236
Huh?

1624
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,270
Go to sleep.

1625
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:50,034
Get this fat loser outta here.

1626
01:22:50,068 --> 01:22:52,208
I'll do the speech myself.

1627
01:23:00,837 --> 01:23:01,907
Do you know who I am?

1628
01:23:01,942 --> 01:23:04,600
Let me through, you neanderthal.

1629
01:23:09,743 --> 01:23:12,504
Now, we know who
Fatty Melvin is.

1630
01:23:12,539 --> 01:23:15,231
My whole house
is Plastic Ware.

1631
01:23:18,683 --> 01:23:19,683
Welcome.

1632
01:23:33,594 --> 01:23:35,734
What is the meaning of this?

1633
01:23:35,769 --> 01:23:36,839
Oh, oh.

1634
01:23:36,873 --> 01:23:37,978
Well, what is it?

1635
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,153
Oh, yeah, uh, your majesty.

1636
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:41,154
Oh, I mean, your honor.

1637
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:42,327
Um, thank you.

1638
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:47,160
My name is, uh,
Fatty Melvin and, uh,

1639
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:52,165
I'm here to put forth the
proposition to vote

1640
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:55,409
against the Octocircle Mall.

1641
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,447
Well, you better act fast.

1642
01:23:58,481 --> 01:24:00,863
We're about to take the vote.

1643
01:24:00,897 --> 01:24:01,897
Okay.

1644
01:24:06,696 --> 01:24:09,113
I would like to read a letter

1645
01:24:09,147 --> 01:24:12,047
from my late brother,
James Melvin.

1646
01:24:19,813 --> 01:24:20,813
Okay.

1647
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:28,235
I wish someone had told me

1648
01:24:29,685 --> 01:24:33,378
that when I climbed this
mountain and reached the top

1649
01:24:33,413 --> 01:24:35,553
that I would be all alone.

1650
01:24:37,037 --> 01:24:41,110
I wish that I was told that
happiness isn't found in more.

1651
01:24:41,145 --> 01:24:45,632
Instead, I was told that
this was the prize, the goal,

1652
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,290
that I would be complete,

1653
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:50,982
here, among the money and stuff.

1654
01:24:54,917 --> 01:24:56,919
But I found out-
Isn't this your friend?

1655
01:24:56,953 --> 01:24:58,576
- That it's all vanity.
- That Fatty guy?

1656
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:00,198
Meaningless.

1657
01:25:00,233 --> 01:25:03,684
I had everything I
wanted in front of me,

1658
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:07,757
and yet I sacrificed it
all in order to get more.

1659
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:12,831
I wish I had realized
that who I am is enough,

1660
01:25:15,006 --> 01:25:16,249
and that my friends and family,

1661
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:17,733
and even the
strangers around me,

1662
01:25:17,767 --> 01:25:20,563
are worth more than
any amount of money,

1663
01:25:20,598 --> 01:25:24,533
power, or prestige
I could ever obtain.

1664
01:25:24,567 --> 01:25:26,811
I wish someone had told me

1665
01:25:26,845 --> 01:25:31,091
that the prize wasn't at the
top of the mountain after all.

1666
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,437
That it was here

1667
01:25:34,405 --> 01:25:35,475
at the bottom

1668
01:25:36,821 --> 01:25:37,821
all along,

1669
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:42,827
in that ordinary normal life

1670
01:25:42,861 --> 01:25:45,968
that I spent my whole
life running from.

1671
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:54,873
I wish that someone had told
me to choose joy in the now

1672
01:25:54,908 --> 01:25:58,808
instead of searching for
it in the what may be.

1673
01:26:01,259 --> 01:26:03,468
I wish someone had told me.

1674
01:26:08,508 --> 01:26:09,508
They didn't.

1675
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:13,651
But now I'm telling you.

1676
01:26:17,655 --> 01:26:19,312
It's time to listen.

1677
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:32,256
That's a beautiful
speech, son.

1678
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,671
Just beautiful.

1679
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:37,399
A little long, but can
we just get going now?

1680
01:26:38,296 --> 01:26:39,504
What is it that you want?

1681
01:26:39,539 --> 01:26:42,300
Do you want more
stuff, more toys?

1682
01:26:43,784 --> 01:26:46,994
He who has the most toys wins.

1683
01:26:47,029 --> 01:26:48,962
But you can't
take it with you.

1684
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:52,207
But I can leave it
to my kids, right?

1685
01:26:55,486 --> 01:26:56,970
You know, the...

1686
01:26:58,592 --> 01:27:01,837
The only thing I ever
wanted from my dad

1687
01:27:04,322 --> 01:27:05,565
was his love.

1688
01:27:05,599 --> 01:27:09,327
I just wanted him to
love me, that's it.

1689
01:27:09,362 --> 01:27:10,639
That was it.

1690
01:27:10,673 --> 01:27:12,986
I didn't need anything else.

1691
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:19,510
I just have one last thing.

1692
01:27:21,788 --> 01:27:23,030
One last thing.

1693
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:41,808
All right, I think it's
time for us to have a vote.

1694
01:28:18,879 --> 01:28:20,260
Okay, um,

1695
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:25,127
I guess it's over to you now.

1696
01:28:25,161 --> 01:28:29,787
I think it's time for us
to take a vote on the matter.

1697
01:28:29,821 --> 01:28:34,101
All those in favor of Octocircle's
mall proposal say aye.

1698
01:28:34,136 --> 01:28:35,136
Aye.

1699
01:28:36,172 --> 01:28:37,726
Those opposed?

1700
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,760
Nay.

1701
01:28:41,005 --> 01:28:42,005
Hm.

1702
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:45,285
You've got some moxie, son

1703
01:28:48,219 --> 01:28:49,289
Nay.

1704
01:28:53,742 --> 01:28:57,608
The motion for Octocircle's
proposal is denied.

1705
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:15,211
Your brother would
be very proud of you.

1706
01:29:15,246 --> 01:29:16,454
Thanks, Dad.

1707
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:18,145
Thank you, Robert.

1708
01:29:25,532 --> 01:29:27,189
Yes, Fatty did it.

1709
01:29:55,597 --> 01:29:56,597
You.

1710
01:30:01,292 --> 01:30:03,915
That's for making me
lose my security deposit

1711
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:05,434
on the wedding reception.

1712
01:30:05,469 --> 01:30:06,849
Huh.

1713
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:08,023
What?

1714
01:30:08,057 --> 01:30:09,473
She's gone.

1715
01:30:09,507 --> 01:30:11,233
New York, apparently.

1716
01:30:12,476 --> 01:30:14,236
On the flip side,

1717
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:17,273
I have a sweet new
gig at Octocircle.

1718
01:30:17,308 --> 01:30:18,308
Uh.

1719
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:21,105
What do you say?

1720
01:30:21,139 --> 01:30:23,245
It's not all bad, Fatty.

1721
01:30:24,108 --> 01:30:25,178
Nah, come on.

1722
01:30:28,388 --> 01:30:30,528
Now get off my property.

1723
01:30:42,126 --> 01:30:43,368
Hey, Fatty.

1724
01:30:43,403 --> 01:30:44,887
Hi, Kathy. How's
life?

1725
01:30:44,922 --> 01:30:46,406
Never been better.

1726
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,890
How are you doing?

1727
01:30:49,133 --> 01:30:50,133
The same.

1728
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:25,169
Our true self, the
person God created you to be,

1729
01:31:25,203 --> 01:31:29,622
has been buried under so much
rubble of this chaotic life,

1730
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:31,727
that once you see the light,

1731
01:31:31,762 --> 01:31:34,834
you have to step
out and say goodbye.

1732
01:31:36,076 --> 01:31:40,184
You have to let go to
make room for the new.

1733
01:31:40,218 --> 01:31:45,189
It's time to face those
fears and rewrite your story.

1734
01:31:46,086 --> 01:31:47,363
Not one day, not tomorrow,

1735
01:31:48,744 --> 01:31:49,744
but today.

1736
01:32:18,463 --> 01:32:19,361
Robert,

1737
01:32:19,395 --> 01:32:21,087
if you're ever over this way,

1738
01:32:21,121 --> 01:32:23,814
I could always do
some "motorvation."

1739
01:32:23,848 --> 01:32:24,848
Love, Lisa.

1740
01:32:42,487 --> 01:32:44,489
My brother, James, used to say,

1741
01:32:44,524 --> 01:32:47,389
"If you could dream it,
you can achieve it."

1742
01:32:47,423 --> 01:32:50,703
That's, uh, pretty good advice.

1743
01:32:50,737 --> 01:32:52,083
The problem is,

1744
01:32:52,118 --> 01:32:54,499
having your own dreams
is scary sometimes.

1745
01:32:54,534 --> 01:32:57,433
You might fall, you might fail,

1746
01:32:57,468 --> 01:33:00,126
and honestly, you might
never achieve them.

1747
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,541
But the truth is

1748
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:04,061
we all fall, and fail.

1749
01:33:04,095 --> 01:33:05,994
But if we never give
our dreams a chance,

1750
01:33:06,028 --> 01:33:08,548
we will never know
the joy of reaching.

1751
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,068
So dream big, then go boldly,

1752
01:33:11,102 --> 01:33:12,828
venture into the unknown,

1753
01:33:12,863 --> 01:33:15,037
honor the past that helped
make you who you are,

1754
01:33:15,072 --> 01:33:16,314
take joy in the present,

1755
01:33:16,349 --> 01:33:18,454
remember that you make a
difference here on earth

1756
01:33:18,489 --> 01:33:20,353
just by being you,

1757
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:24,391
and then get out there
and tackle the future.

1758
01:33:24,426 --> 01:33:27,015
Know that you're not alone.

1759
01:33:27,049 --> 01:33:28,188
You're awesome.

1760
01:33:28,223 --> 01:33:29,534
You got this.

1761
01:33:29,569 --> 01:33:31,157
This is your story.

1762
01:33:32,054 --> 01:33:34,263
Get out there and write it.

1763
01:33:49,037 --> 01:33:50,245
Go write your own story.
