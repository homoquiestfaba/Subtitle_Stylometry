1
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:17,418
White male,
let me rephrase that,

2
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:21,322
white male child,
seven years old, dead,

3
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,392
murdered, floating in a lake.

4
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,360
Killed by his own mother.

5
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,263
His own piece of shit mother!

6
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,499
What do ya have
to say about that?

7
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:38,106
Ya don't have to say
shit, ya know why?

8
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,642
Because we have
witnesses that know,

9
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,544
that saw what you did!

10
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,346
We have witnesses that saw what-

11
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,614
- Calm down, calm down.

12
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,750
Calm down.

13
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,253
Are you OK?

14
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:58,792
You need anything,
water, soda, anything?

15
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,229
I'll get you some water.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,636
So everything's gonna be OK.

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,272
Just need some answers.

18
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:15,243
Steven!

19
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,311
Steven, get your ass in here!

20
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,280
You can never, you can
never, you can never!

21
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,182
Calm down!

22
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:21,882
Relax, relax.

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,185
Calm down, relax.

24
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,354
You can't take her,
you can't take her.

25
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,589
Just water, it's OK.

26
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,857
You can't have her.

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,160
The lake, the lake.

28
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:34,295
The lake, what
happened at the lake?

29
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,596
Donna listen-

30
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,598
- My son, the lake took my son.

31
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,800
What happened to
your son down there.

32
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,669
It took my
son, it took my son.

33
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,313
It tried to kill her,
he tried to kill her.

34
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,306
Who's her, what
are you sayin'?

35
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,340
He tried to kill her!

36
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:47,675
I'm tired of this shit!

37
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,712
Why did you drown
your fucking son?

38
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,547
Why!

39
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,351
Why did you drown
your fuckin' son?

40
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:06,894
I tried, but he's not
dead, he's not dead no!

41
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,502
Not dead!

42
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,534
That was creepy.

43
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,704
Jillian, you can't tell
me you believe that shit.

44
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,273
Well we just watched a video,

45
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,440
it had to have happened!

46
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,008
Crazy things
happen all the time.

47
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,510
Remember that old lady that fell

48
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,346
down the stairs up the
street and she died?

49
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,581
Yeah?

50
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,015
OK, is this block haunted?

51
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,484
No.

52
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,320
Exactly, and she was
creepy as shit too!

53
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,954
That's not very nice!

54
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,991
Baby come here, your
necklace is all tangled.

55
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,563
You never take that
thing off, do you?

56
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,865
No, actually I
never take it off.

57
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,001
All right Jillian relax,
I was just tryin' to help.

58
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,037
Sorry.

59
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,074
Hey wait, you need to
go pack your stuff.

60
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,310
- OK.
- And hurry up.

61
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,311
All right, I will, come on.

62
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,554
We have to be there
by this evening!

63
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,480
OK.

64
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,293
Hey gal!

65
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,862
Hello!

66
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,066
Woo, this is gonna
be such a fun trip,

67
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,968
I'm so excited!

68
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,102
What's up!

69
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,771
Hey Jamie!

70
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,843
Oh look who it is.

71
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:46,987
Oh, what's up all star?

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,064
Just fine, have
you guys started

73
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,690
to drink without me!

74
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,594
Hey Stacey, damn,
you not gonna help?

75
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,829
You're welcome, Boo.

76
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,469
Thanks for comin' bro.

77
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,804
Oh yeah I"m so glad,
we're gonna have a blast!

78
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,006
By the way, happy
birthday playboy!

79
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,107
We're goin' in, right?

80
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,009
Thanks brother, absolutely.

81
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,044
Yo, this shit is heavy man.

82
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,080
What's she got in here?

83
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,461
We ain't even
gotta go to trails,

84
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,986
we just raid the girls' bags.

85
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,323
By the way, have
you seen Charlie?

86
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:24,968
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, he called me

87
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,594
and told me he can't
make it now, but he

88
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,028
might be showin' up later on.

89
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,139
You know Charlie's
from Jersey, right?

90
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:30,931
He is?

91
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,065
Yes!

92
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,168
Now I know why he
acts like that, right?

93
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,570
That's freakin' Charlie.

94
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:41,842
Be careful, ain't no
Converse in that bag!

95
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,078
Yo, we gonna have a
blast, you ready for this?

96
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,614
It's gonna be epic, epic.

97
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,982
Let's do it, Jersey shore baby!

98
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,084
Hey, make room for
the chubby white guy!

99
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,486
What's up!

100
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,721
Watch your tits, man!

101
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,356
It never ends.

102
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,025
Let's go!

103
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,795
Party in the back!

104
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,829
Alex, Alex!

105
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:36,564
Hey baby!

106
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,598
Say something to the

107
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,700
camera, birthday boy!

108
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,102
Oh baby, I wanna thank you for

110
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:44,972

112
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,944
- Aw, he's talking about me!
- Love you mama.

113
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,913
All right,
so how 'bout you continue

114
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,016
that with no
interruptions this time.

115
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,019
What about you, miss thang?

116
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:03,991
Well, besides fist
pumping all weekend-

117
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,160
- Woo!

118
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,663
I would like to
start by having a

119
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,932
couple shots for Alex.

120
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,801
Yeah Alex!

121
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:18,005
Mark, Mark,
take two for me, baby!

122
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,173
- I got three for you!
- I'm drivin'.

123
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,010
I would just like to make
a toast to my handsome,

124
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:27,748
sexy, quarterback
boyfriend on his birthday,

125
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,117
and everyone for coming!

126
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,053
To my bestie for
coming and bringing

127
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,788
your silly boyfriend.

128
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:35,923
That's me!

129
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,226
Man, I'm so
psyched man, so psyched.

130
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,128
And, to
Mark, for actually taking

131
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,163
time out of his busy drills.
Yeah!

132
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:43,897
I know.

133
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:44,598
And protein shakes!

134
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,199
You already know!

135
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:49,870
And last, but not least,

136
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:54,842
over there, Stacey,
for just being you!

137
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,011
Hold up, hold up, all right,

138
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,280
happy birthday to my man!

139
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:05,152
Yeah, woo!

140
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:06,820
Cheers!

141
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,155
NFL, baby!

142
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,866
Can you believe
we're finally here?

143
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,702
Only took up to
senior year to get

144
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:55,803
to the Jersey shore.

145
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,782
Yeah, but we're still
broke ass college students.

146
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,107
Not for long though, man!

147
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,675
NFL baby!

148
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,744
Yeah!

149
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,189
Man, you guys gotta
stop leavin' me out.

150
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,081
I told ya I could be
Turtle from Entourage.

151
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,216
You can't be Turtle.

152
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,984
You look like a turtle.

153
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,254
You're always
gonna be just Jamie.

154
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,092
Whatever man.

155
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,005
Hey man, ya sure we're

156
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,139
goin' the right way?

157
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,309
It says we're
five minutes away.

158
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,744
I mean look, it's Clinton Road.

159
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,498
Yeah, it said we were
going the right way.

160
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,048
I don't know.

161
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,221
Should we keep going?

162
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,266
Let's just get back in
the car, come on, let's go.

163
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,125
Let's get outta here, man.

164
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,302
Hey, you
guys wanna hear a joke?

165
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,904
Sure.

166
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:37,947
What do you
call two football players,

167
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,182
a cheerleader, her best
friend, a fat white guy,

168
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,108
and an anti-social black girl?

169
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,011
Fucking lost!

170
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,030
Oh wow man, this
place is fuckin' sick!

171
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,033
Let's go!

172
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,134
Yeah!

173
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,235
Oh shit!

174
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:13,340
Welcome to the beach house!

175
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,442
You do know that a beach house

176
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,811
requires a beach, right?

177
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,781
Thanks Stacey,
I got that memo.

178
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,216
I don't think ya
did because this is

179
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,287
just a house at the end
of a long ass spooky road.

180
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,957
Mark, you said we were
going to the beach.

181
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,491
What the hell, I left my friends

182
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,093
in the cape for this?

183
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:33,794
I could be sitting-

184
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:37,765
- Babe, shh, relax, listen.

185
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,233
I'm sure we'll find
a beach nearby, OK?

186
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,501
Yeah right.

187
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,254
Right Alex, there's
a beach nearby, right?

188
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,537
Ah!

189
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,314
Yeah, yeah, woo!

190
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,417
It's my birthday,
it's my birthday!

191
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,219
I'm gonna go downstairs
and check it out.

192
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,056
Hey Alex, Mark, you wanna come

193
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,792
over here for a second?

194
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,126
- Coming!
- All right.

195
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,460
Hurry up!

196
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,134
All right so, I have
an idea on how we can

197
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,103
pick the bedrooms.

198
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:19,306
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, I think

199
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,174
I should get first
pick of the room.

200
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,243
Oh yeah, and why do you think

201
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,544
you should get first pick?

202
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,814
One, it's my
birthday, and two,

203
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,181
I'm the fattest one here!

204
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,450
I deserve a big
bed for this body!

205
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,152
How 'bout Alex
picks 'cause it's

206
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,921
actually his birthday.

207
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,088
Yeah Jamie.

208
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,223
Yeah, she's right.

209
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,591
Bro, go 'head pick
your room man!

210
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,861
So I can do my thing.

211
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,488
I'm going in, I'm going in.

212
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,426
Football, check,
protein, I'm gonna

213
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,028
see you tomorrow, baby.

214
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,365
This is great, I deserve this.

215
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,241
What babe?

216
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,643
Don't what babe
me, you said we were

217
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,412
going to a beach house, Mark.

218
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,281
Where's the beach?

219
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,351
Can you help me find,
is it comin' out later?

220
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,053
Where's the beach?

221
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,023
Maybe I missed it.

222
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,894
'Cause all I see is
woods, like Jamie said.

223
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,129
I left my friends
in Mass for this?

224
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,031
I'm not gonna hear
the end of this, am I?

225
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,266
Uh, no 'cause
you got me out here

226
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,543
in the middle of
nowhere with the

227
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,003
children of the corn.

228
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,405
What's so funny?

229
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,142
Uh, I'm sorry, can we help you?

230
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,615
Yeah, I would just
actually like to

231
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,445
inform this lovely
couple that Alex did

232
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,646
find a lake.

233
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,515
That's what's up,
we out, let's go.

234
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,117
That's not what's up.

235
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,019
Thank you for the memo.

236
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,089
A lake is not a beach.

237
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,323
That's what I'm talking about!

238
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:22,029
Babe, please just
try to enjoy yourself.

239
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,597
OK, we're not goin'
anywhere soon, all right?

240
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,899
OK?

241
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,239
You guys have to admit,

242
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,673
this is kinda creepy.

243
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,142
Well hell yeah it is!

244
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,143
Creepy?

245
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,377
Far is more like it!

246
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,210
You guys keep forgetting
how fuckin' fat I am!

247
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,115
I might as well roll down here.

248
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,262
This is gonna be so much fun.

249
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,089
I know, I love goin'
on trips with you, girl!

250
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,223
Remember last time?

251
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,493
Hey party people!

252
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,728
What's goin' on,
check out my beach

253
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,664
resort, mother fuckers!

254
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,176
Nah, it's pretty cool,
I mean it's not a beach,

255
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,303
it's a lake, but what
do you think babe?

256
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,173
Yeah, this is no beach,
but it's still romantic.

257
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:09,542
We can just hang out,
make a fire, have some

258
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,644
drinks and play some games.

259
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,413
Make a fire, that sounds good.

260
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,149
I mean, it's not a
beach, but who needs it?

261
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,218
Mark, what do you think?

262
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,021
I think we can
make it work, man!

263
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,556
What the hell, it
has to work, right?

264
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,192
Definitely.

265
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:32,065
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah!

266
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,334
Hey you guys, I

267
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,468

268
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,204

All right, it's gotta be

00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,091

that's gonna win me no
Oscar or no shit like that.

297
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,261
That's reality.

298
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,864
So let's just play
these games and get drunk!

299
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,844
Hey baby, what are you doin'?

300
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,447
Hey everybody!

301
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,352
Guess what movie and who I am.

302
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,629
I don't know if
you know, but I'm

303
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,689
kind of a big deal.

304
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:43,923
I give up.

305
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:49,262
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Jillian, what are

00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,631

307
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,967
How's the water, Jilly?

308
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,269
Jillian!

309
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,773
How's the water, baby?

310
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,475
Jillian, get back over here.

311
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:05,812
Uh, I don't
know 'bout all this!

312
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,448
Jillian!

313
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,121
Hey Alex, what's up
with your girl, man?

314
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:15,955
Feels weird.

315
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,428
Jillian, I'm not
gonna fuckin' jump

316
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,559
in there, get over
here, seriously!

317
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,963
Come here.

318
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,865
It feels like someone's
grabbing at my legs.

319
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,800
Grabbing at your legs, what?

320
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,469
Come here, come here, Jillian!

321
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,703
Come on!

322
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,675
Come here, what
the fuck are you doing!

323
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,612
Why did you, look at
me, why you, look.

324
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,815
Why do you do shit
like that, seriously?

325
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,886
Come on, watch the rocks.

326
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,921
Come on, Jillian.

327
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,292
Damn, come on, hold my hand.

328
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,027
What the fuck!

329
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,396
What are you doing?

330
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,730
Sorry I just-

331
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:58,865
- You just what?

332
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,033
Thank you.

333
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,202
We've been drinkin' all
night, what if you drown.

334
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,573
Oh, I got it, I
got it, the movie is

335
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,341
delirious white
female and you're

336
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,942
the title character.

337
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:10,910
All right,
not right now, come on.

338
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,045
What, you
all didn't see that one?

339
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,559
Wait, wait, wait,
Alex, my necklace.

340
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,915
What?

341
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,717
It's gone, my
necklace is gone!

342
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,052
Jillian, it's just a necklace,
don't worry-

343
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,421
- No, it's my necklace!

344
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,022
We're not going
inside the lake.

345
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,856
You're not gonna go in there,

346
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,458
I'm certainly not gonna
go in there.

347
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,602
I've been drinkin' all night.

348
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:27,903
I'm not goin' in
the fuckin' lake

349
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,029
and drowning, OK?

350
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,540
Look, I'll tell you
what, when I wake up

351
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,434
in the morning time,
I'll look for it myself.

352
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,002
For now I wanna rest.

353
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,035
Promise?

354
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,706
I promise, OK, but seriously,

355
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,007
what you did was wrong.

356
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,685
Don't ever do somethin'
like that again, baby.

357
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:43,576
You worried me.

358
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,977
Yeah ya'll let's go inside,

359
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,846
it's gettin' late
out here, let's

360
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,715

here, come on.

361
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,916
Good night guys.

362
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,884
Stacey, come on, let's go.

363
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,853
I'm coming, you come on!

364
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,064
Hi!

365
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,900
Hey sexy lady.

366
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:08,934
How are you?

367
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,404
I'm good, except
for the fact that

368
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,373
everybody left me
on my birthday.

369
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,042
I didn't leave you.

370
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,478
Thank God.

371
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,687
I'm goin' for a touchdown.

372
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:38,598
Happy birthday to me,
you're so beautiful.

373
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,401
I love you.

374
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,002
I love you too.

375
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,072
Happy birthday.

376
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,813
I'm sorry, I just
don't feel like it.

377
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,651
I mean, can I go
get you something?

378
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,820
You want somethin'
to drink, anything?

379
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:07,927
I think I need to lay down
and rest for a minute.

380
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,831
Lay down and rest?

381
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,971
Oh man.

382
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,874
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:23,643
It's all right.

384
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:24,911
You promise?

385
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,154
It's not like I don't
have the whole weekend.

386
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,747
That's true.

387
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,383
And I will make it up to you.

388
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,421
Pinkie swear on that.

389
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,822
Pinkie swear.

390
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,933
Ain't got nothin' on me, baby!

391
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,968
Damn man, he
never takes a break

392
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,169
from trainin', does he?

393
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,037
I should be right
there with him!

394
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,004
What up.

395
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,038
What's up, baby.

396
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:11,791
Damn man, it's so
peaceful out here.

397
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:12,824
Mm hmm.

398
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:16,839
You gotta wake
up, man and come

399
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,303
work out with me in
the mornin', man.

400
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,901
I barely got any
sleep last night.

401
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,771
I'm shot.

402
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,911
Look at that.

403
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,018
Oh shit!

404
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:40,780
Really, really?

405
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,683
You guys will just stare
at my girlfriend like that?

406
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,918
Yeah, but you know,
we don't mean it.

407
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,286
Don't mean nothin' by it.

408
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,220
Nah, I'm just kiddin', man.

409
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,622
You want the truth?

410
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:52,792
What, no she's sexy
man, look at her.

411
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,894
Wait 'til she bends
down though, hold on.

412
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:58,898
Look at her, look at her!

413
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:03,746
Gonna be all right man,
you're gonna be all right.

414
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,871
I hope.

415
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,807
She gonna break up with you.

416
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,909
Nah man, ya know, she's sexy.

417
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,844
I know I'm a little
chubby, but you know what,

418
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,289
when we walk down
the street, we look

419
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,648
like the number 10, and that's

420
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,016
what makes it perfect.

421
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:20,596
Well, there's somethin'
seriously wrong with you.

422
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,788
I know!

423
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,000
Hey listen man,
let's go show 'em

424
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,626
how to really work out.

425
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:30,296
You stay here, it's got
nothin' to do with you.

426
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,599
Aw, I wanna be popular too!

427
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:10,276
Jilly beans, how
ya feelin' babe?

428
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,878
I'm OK.

429
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,846
What's wrong?

430
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:15,882
I just don't feel good.

431
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,884
I didn't sleep much last night.

432
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,187
So you owe me one,
you let me work out

433
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,355
all alone today!

434
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:24,390
Sorry.

435
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,459
It's OK.

436
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,670
You weren't workin'
alone, Peepin' Tom

437
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,897
number one and two were
both lookin' at you!

438
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,964
Oh hell no!

439
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:32,965
Oh yeah?

440
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,333
Where was you then?

441
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,544
You was right there with us!
She's my girlfriend!

442
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,812
- Hey, you OK?
- She knows I'm a pervert!

443
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,038
I just don't feel so good.

444
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:41,249
Hey, can I talk to you
in the room for a second?

445
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,574
Don't listen to this guy.

446
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,048
Why you lie like that, man?
Really?

447
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:47,046
Hey guys, I'm gonna
go relax for a little.

448
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,048
All right, see ya in a bit.

449
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,017
Wait a minute, you're a punk.

450
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,418
Get the fuck outta here.

451
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,690
So what's up baby,
you seem kinda tense,

452
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:02,528
by the way, is
everything all right?

453
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,400
Do you think this is weird?

454
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,109
Jillian, it's
a picture of you.

455
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:19,011
What's so weird about that?

456
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,013
Because it's not me.

457
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,615
What do you mean it's
not you, I'm confused.

458
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,952
It's clearly you.

459
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,522
I found this picture
here in the house.

460
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,060
How could that
picture be here?

461
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:37,663
Exactly, something is
weird about this place Alex.

462
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,565
Ever since I got in that lake,

463
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,400
everything's been different.

464
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,303
All I can do is think
about that video.

465
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:47,974
Babe, you're reading
way too deep into things.

466
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,310
Look, it's just a
strange coincidence.

467
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,980
I mean, people look
like each other

468
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:55,214
all the time, right?

469
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,019
Hey!

470
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,056
Hey baby.

471
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,960
Jilly, what's the matter?

472
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,011
Let's get the energy
up, yo it's my birthday!

473
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,346
How 'bout you fuckin'
party mother fuckers.

474
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,349
Get yo ass up, come on, woo!

475
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,318
Yeah buddy, open
your mouth, go ah!

476
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,753
Oh my God, this is awesome.

477
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:46,065
Happy birthday, my man, yeah!

478
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,367
How about if I pour
everybody a drink, man.

479
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,650
What, you're
not drinkin' tonight?

480
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,452
Is she not drinkin'?

481
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,821
I love you, ha ha!

482
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,731
Stacey, what the
fuck are you wearing!

483
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:22,568
You wish you could!

484
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,471
Come here, hey,
hey, come here.

485
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,124
Hey babe, come
on, what's takin'

486
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:46,758
you so long already?

487
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,467
Damn babe, what's wrong?

488
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,668
Something just touched me.

489
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:03,469
What?

490
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,436
I'm not kidding
Mark, something

491
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,572
just fucking touched me.

492
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,224
Jill.

493
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:34,986
Hey, what's up playboy?

494
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:37,889
Sup man.

495
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,758
What's good, man?

496
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,836
Early start, huh?

497
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,876
I didn't get no
sleep last night.

498
00:37:58,377 --> 00:37:59,654
So what's up
man, you ready for

499
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:00,679
this run or what.

500
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,049
Ready as I'm gonna get.

501
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,082
Come on man.

502
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,587
Let's go, what's up?

503
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,888
Where is everybody?

504
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,358
Oh, Jamie and Amber,
they're at the lake.

505
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,726
Stacey's still getting ready.

506
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,061
What's up with Jilly?

507
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,330
She's out there somewhere.

508
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,467
Find that, you
wore that out, huh?

509
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,469
You wore that out, boy?

510
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:24,670
I fuckin' wish.

511
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,772
Shit, come on man,
let's go, let's go.

512
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,375
Come on quarterback,
let's get this run on man.

513
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:41,853
Jillian!

514
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,752
I knew somethin' was
wrong with this place.

515
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,527
Are you OK?

516
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:34,920
Did you hear that?

517
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:35,953
Yeah I heard it.

518
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:51,069
Jilly, Jilly I'm home!

519
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,871
Jilly.

520
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:53,972
Hey Stace.

521
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,912
Jilly is, not in the room.

522
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,714
Jilly's not in the room.

523
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:04,291
Man, there's no sign
of Stacey anywhere.

524
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,416
Maybe she left?

525
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,885
To go where?

526
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,238
She don't know
nobody around here.

527
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,822
Let me see if I can get her.

528
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:13,992
Fuck!

529
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,226
You don't have reception?

530
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,295
No man, bro we in
the middle of nowhere.

531
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:18,339
All right, but we
got a better chance

532
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:20,141
of getting reception if
we go outside, come on.

533
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:21,633
Let's go.

534
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:30,809
Hold on, I almost got it.

535
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,911
All right wait,
wait, wait, wait.

536
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:41,152
I fuckin' lost it man, fuck!

537
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:43,354
I knew this shit
wasn't gonna work.

538
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,623
Damn.

539
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,434
There's no use gettin'
pissed right now.

540
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,094
Let's just keep lookin'.

541
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,395
I got nothin' man.

542
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:51,763
How 'bout you, Amber?

543
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:52,931
Me neither.

544
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,803
The fuck?

545
00:43:57,836 --> 00:43:59,337
Yo, how'd she make it past us?

546
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,706
Jillian.

547
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,945
Jillian, baby, baby,
where have you been?

548
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,681
I've been here.

549
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,951
Here by the lake?

550
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,186
Yep.

551
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,255
That's crazy
because we've been here too.

552
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,656
Didn't you see us?

553
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,326
Well if you saw us, why
didn't you say something?

554
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,397
Well have you seen Stacey?

555
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,836
No.

556
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:37,876
Hey man, Jill's been
actin' weird as shit lately.

557
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:40,712
Yeah Alex, something's
really wrong with her.

558
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,315
Thanks Amber, I
appreciate that.

559
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,854
Why don't you guys let
me take care of that.

560
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:52,858
Mark, Mark, let's go get Stacey.

561
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:54,259
All right man.

562
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:18,149
Hey, come on guys,
let's go find Stacey.

563
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,885
Come on, I'll drive.

564
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:21,953
You have the keys, Mark?

565
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,191
Fuck.

566
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,759
Mark, you ain't
got the fuckin' keys?

567
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,029
You think Jillian has 'em?

568
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,831
Jilly can't have 'em,
she was in the room

569
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,299
sleepin' all night.

570
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:35,901
Said she didn't feel good.

571
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:37,945
To be honest with you,
I think somethin's

572
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,337
fuckin' wrong with her, man.

573
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,448
Ya know what, maybe
they're in the truck.

574
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,912
I'm gonna go look
for 'em real quick.

575
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:21,412
Oh, damn it.

576
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:47,138
You guys can't scare me,
I'm the king of that!

577
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,308
Where are you.

578
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:58,984
What the hell's so funny, man?

579
00:46:59,017 --> 00:46:59,985
Yeah, I know you
guys were out there

580
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:01,352
tryin' to scare me.

581
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,456
Babe, really, no one
left their seat, I promise.

582
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,625
No, I saw someone
out there tryin'

583
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,927
to scare me, you know what?

584
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,005
You guys wanna come out
there, try to get back

585
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:12,269
at me, whatever, you know what,

586
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:13,331
I know it was you, Mark.

587
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:14,099
You serious?

588
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:15,300
Yeah.

589
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,034
Bro, look at me,
I promise I didn't

590
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:17,468
move from this seat, all right?

591
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,471
You know what, whatever.

592
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:21,940
Are you ready for bed Amber?

593
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:23,608
Yeah, I'm beat.

594
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:32,550
I just can't believe she
left without sayin' goodbye.

595
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,252
I could see she
didn't wanna be here.

596
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:37,522
Yeah well, oh well.

597
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,325
Fuck it.

598
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,227
Hey where you goin'?

599
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,861
I'm done man, that's it.

600
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:48,900
Thanks a lot for all
the birthday love, guys.

601
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:52,570
Guess I'll go in my bedroom and

602
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:56,241
lay in bed with my
gorgeous, beautiful,

603
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:58,676
yet depressed girlfriend.

604
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,678
Shit hey, at least
your girlfriend's

605
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,711
still here, man.

606
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,714
You'd better be grateful!

607
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:05,116
You see these?

608
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,750
These are my two new
girlfriends tonight.

609
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,696
We gonna have us a little
threesome, brother.

610
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,322
That's disgusting.

611
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:13,158
Hey, I gotta do
what I gotta do, brotha!

612
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,115
The fuck!

613
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:52,123
Oh my God, the fuck, ugh!

614
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:54,591
Oh my G-

615
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:09,267

616
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,267
Jamie!

617
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,436
Hey Jamie!

618
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:49,374
Jamie, Jamie!

619
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:54,579
Jamie?

620
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:56,647
Jamie!

621
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:58,725
What the hell are you
screamin' about man!

622
00:51:58,749 --> 00:51:59,717
Jamie man, there's somethin'

623
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,685
fuckin' wrong with him.

624
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:02,320
Is he fuckin' naked?

625
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,692
What are you guys lookin' at?

626
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:14,399
Jamie!

627
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:22,707
Jamie, Jamie!

628
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,577
Oh my God!

629
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,380
Oh my God, oh fuck!

630
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:37,622
Jamie!

631
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,626
Oh fuck.

632
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:45,696
Hey, where's his body, bro?

633
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,734
Oh my God, I thought
it was fuckin' bullshit.

634
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,338
What the hell are
you talkin' about, man?

635
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,473
The lake, the
house, the fuckin' road!

636
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,276
Alex, you're not makin'
any sense to me, man.

637
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,211
Oh fuck, fuck!

638
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,415
It's fuckin' haunted!

639
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:05,550
What?

640
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:12,399
Me and Jillian
didn't believe it

641
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:13,858
when we heard it, man.

642
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:19,397
We didn't wanna
believe it, we read

643
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,931
about that shit.

644
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,901
They said that this
whole shit, Clinton Road,

645
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,505
is fuckin' ghosts,
supernatural shit.

646
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,715
I didn't wanna believe
it, but what else

647
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,508
could it fuckin' be?

648
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:33,411
What do you mean,
what else could it be?

649
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,055
Yo, you brought us to
a fuckin' haunted house

650
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,414
and didn't tell us?

651
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:40,785
Just stay back, man.

652
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:49,327
You mother
fuckers, that's good.

653
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:51,662
Do you even hear yourself?

654
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:54,765
You're losin' it, bro.

655
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:58,803
Fucking ghosts, is
he fucking serious?

656
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:03,341
Alex, Alex, look around
man, there's just us.

657
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:08,646
Look, that mother
fucker jumped, OK?

658
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:12,317
That's what happened, he jumped.

659
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,752
He didn't fucking jump!

660
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,654
Where's his body then?

661
00:54:17,688 --> 00:54:19,357
Listen, I don't
have time for this

662
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,558
bull shit, all right?

663
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:24,695
And I don't give a fuck
about what ya'll's sayin'.

664
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,834
There's no fucking ghost,
and even if there was

665
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,602
I ain't scared of shit!

666
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:34,104
That's white people
shit, all right?

667
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,407
Colored folks don't do ghosts!

668
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:43,681
If you ask me, yeah,
Jamie jumped, all right?

669
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:45,892
And that's what
the fuck happened!

670
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,284
Now let it go.

671
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:50,521
What about Stacey, Mark, did

672
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:51,456
Stacey fucking jump?

673
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:54,892
Did she jump too,
you fucking ass hole?

674
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:57,528
Amber.

675
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,935
Alex, what's going on?

676
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:09,407
Jamie's gone, Stacey's
gone, Jilly's been

677
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,443
acting so fucking
weird and sick!

678
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,781
I need you to relax, OK?

679
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,050
I need you to calm down.

680
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:22,987
Look at me.

681
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:27,658
You can't help me
if you're not calm.

682
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:31,662
I want you to go
inside, get Jillian,

683
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:33,631
tell her to get the keys.

684
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:36,667
We're gonna get the
fuck out of here.

685
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:38,445
I've gotta go in the
woods, I'm gonna try to get

686
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:39,837
reception, I'm
gonna call for help.

687
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,039
Go, please, go.

688
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:36,627
Alex, Alex help me.

689
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:43,668
Alex, please help me.

690
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:45,035
Oh fuck.

691
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:56,847
Oh, oh shit.

692
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:35,486
Damn Jamie, what the fuck!

693
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,491
Ain't scared of
no fuckin' ghosts!

694
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:42,693
Ain't scared of no ghosts.

695
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:44,461
Fuck!

696
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:51,569
Pull it together, Mark,
you seen him jump.

697
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:53,571
You know he jumped!

698
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:54,672
Mark!

699
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:55,405
Ain't scared of no ghosts!

700
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:57,107
Mark, have you seen Jillian?

701
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,242
What?

702
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:07,151
Who gives a fuck, maybe
the ghost got her.

703
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,223
No fuck you, you wish you could!

704
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:17,828
Ain't nobody stoppin' me
from makin' to the NFL.

705
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:21,899
Not Jamie, not Stacey,
definitely no G damn ghost!

706
00:58:31,642 --> 00:58:32,777
Jilly?

707
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:42,186
Jillian?

708
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:52,723
Jillian, Jilly, please help!

709
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:12,643
Damn Jilly!

710
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:17,181
What the fuck is wrong with you!

711
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,447
You crazy bitch!

712
01:00:21,986 --> 01:00:25,923
Alex, Alex, come
get your girl, man!

713
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,803
Fuck them jeans.

714
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:29,052
Ah!

715
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:47,471
Please, don't kill
me, I don't wanna die!

716
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:53,978
Oh fuck!

717
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:55,412
Yo, what are you doin' here?

718
01:01:56,013 --> 01:02:00,217
Oh fuck Alex, bro, I'm
so happy to see you, man.

719
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,518
What are you doin' here?

720
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,187
I'm so fuckin' sorry.

721
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,922
Whoa, it's OK, it's OK.

722
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,891
Look, I'm fuckin'
scared, you happy?

723
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:08,158
I'm fuckin' scared man!

724
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:09,535
We're gonna
go back to the house.

725
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,361
No, I'm not goin'
back to that house.

726
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,999
Look, you're fuckin'
girlfriend is possessed.

727
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:17,034
We're going back to the house.

728
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:22,006
Listen to me, I think
she killed everybody, man.

729
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,978
We're goin' back to the house.

730
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:31,816
I'm gonna hotwire the
car, and then we're gonna-

731
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:33,750
- That's your fuckin' plan?

732
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,520
Did you hear what I just said?

733
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:40,390
Jillian is fucking possessed.

734
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:42,568
Alex, do you think
she's just gonna let us

735
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,463
walk over there, and
fuckin' hot wire the truck?

736
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,532
And that's it, huh?

737
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:51,568
Look around you,
Mark, look around you.

738
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,403
Look around you!

739
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,105
Do we belong here?

740
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,475
We don't we gotta
get outta here.

741
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:00,377
Fuck!

742
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,551
Man, I can't believe you
got us into this shit, man!

743
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:05,568
You can't blame me
man, it's not my fault.

744
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:09,586
I need you to trust me.

745
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,619
All right, bro?

746
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:12,422
Do you trust me, Mark?

747
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,424
Mark, what got us into college?

748
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:16,626
What?

749
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,128
What got us into college?

750
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,405
What are you
talking about, man?

751
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:22,032
The championship game,
high school, last down.

752
01:03:22,066 --> 01:03:23,567
What happened?

753
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,760
I called the play, I said
you're gonna catch it, right?

754
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:28,323
What did you say to me
when we was in the huddle?

755
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:35,012
I said no, all right?

756
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:38,382
Exactly, but when I said,
let me fuckin' call it,

757
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,660
and I tossed you
the ball and you

758
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:42,252
caught it, what happened?

759
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,654
Mark, what happened?

760
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:45,489
We won.

761
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:46,490
Exactly.

762
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:49,026
- We won the game, and what!
- OK, and what?

763
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,227
Let me call it this time.

764
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,395
We gonna win again.

765
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:53,197
We're gonna go
back to the house.

766
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:54,374
We'll get the car,
we're gonna get

767
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:57,434
as far fuckin' from
here as possible.

768
01:03:58,402 --> 01:03:59,403
All right?

769
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,406
All right, man.

770
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:08,245
Listen, I think I know
where the keys are.

771
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:22,692
I don't think I
can do this, man.

772
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,137
Trust me, I
understand how you feel

773
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:25,495
man, I was just in there.

774
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:28,098
No, you don't understand.

775
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:31,568
Jillian, I'm not leavin' her.

776
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,003
What?

777
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,206
I'm not leavin' here
without Jillian, man.

778
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,407
I love her too much.

779
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,320
All I gotta do is get her
outta this fuckin' place,

780
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:42,288
as far as fuckin' possible.
You're outta your fuckin'

781
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:43,912
mind man, you're outta
your fuckin' mind!

782
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:47,027
Look, I'm goin' in there and I'm
gettin' those keys, and I'm out.

783
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49,253
With you, or without you.

784
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,657
Alex, with you or
without you, man.

785
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:58,195
Look, I suggest, for your sake,

787
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:06,503
Come on Alex, be out here

788
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:14,471
Ah!

789
01:06:15,339 --> 01:06:17,074
Jilly baby.

790
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:19,476
I can fall.

791
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:20,577
Jilly, are you OK?

792
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,112
It's OK.

793
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:28,352
Jilly baby, I
know what happened to you.

794
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:32,022
But I can help you.

795
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,463
Baby I love you, so much.

796
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:47,037
Jilly, forget about your past.

797
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,340
Forget about anything
that happened to you.

798
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:51,608
I'm gonna help you.

799
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:58,082
His name is Alex.

800
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:02,452
I'm not leavin'
here without you.

801
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:10,394
I love you, and I
know you love me.

802
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:15,399
Alex?

803
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,236
Alex, help me.

804
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:26,176
Alex, please, help me!

805
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,252
Leave her alone you little f-

806
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:57,541
- I'm not leavin'
here without you.

807
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,612
You hear that?

808
01:08:02,846 --> 01:08:05,149
I'm not gonna leave
here without her!

809
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:06,316
Mother fucker!

810
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:23,480
So where ya headed?

811
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:59,576
Woo, we're goin'
to Clinton Road!

812
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:02,679
Yeah, woo!

813
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,582
I think they're excited.

814
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:07,116
Yeah just a little.

815
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,818
Probably not
that scary anyway.

816
01:13:09,553 --> 01:13:11,120
I don't know what
people are freaking

817
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:13,557
talking about 'cause
there's nothing there.

818
01:13:13,757 --> 01:13:15,024
Yeah.

819
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:16,536
All right, so we're
gonna go to Clinton Road

820
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,563
and prove to people that
there's nothing there.

821
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:21,898
Yeah, to all you
people out there.

822
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,200
Yeah, all of you.

823
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,635
Yeah.

824
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:26,903
There's nothing there.

825
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,638
Do you think there's

826
01:13:28,672 --> 01:13:29,639
anything there?

827
01:13:29,673 --> 01:13:30,783
There might be
somethin' there.

828
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:32,752
- Did you see Suzy last week?
- Oh my God, yeah, she-

829
01:13:32,776 --> 01:13:34,043
- She was so ugly!

830
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,479
Yeah!

831
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:36,656
She was just wearin'
all this cheetah crap.

832
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,548
And she's fat, too.

833
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:39,583
Yeah, and she has this-

834
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:42,619
- And her boobs are
really weird, they're

835
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:43,953
like all flompy.

836
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:45,221
And her butt?

837
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,656
And they sag.

838
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,635
I could see her underwear
line, it was so gross.

839
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:52,962
Oh my God, that's disgusting!

840
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:54,030
I know!

841
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:55,732
I just wanted to go up to her.

842
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,601
Do you guys know who Suzy is?

843
01:13:57,634 --> 01:13:58,735
I don't know who Suzy is.

844
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:00,436
I do, and some people are

845
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:01,404
just not made to wear leggings.

846
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:05,041
- I know.
- Yeah, right?

847
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:06,876
Just wear some jeans.

848
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:08,578
Well it's true!

849
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:10,747
And then Jack
on the other hand?

850
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,248
Oh God!

851
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,051
He needs to blow
his nose or something!

852
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:16,520
Yeah.

853
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:19,556
There's like snot
comin' outta his nose!

854
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:21,290
What the heck!

855
01:14:21,324 --> 01:14:22,726
What is wrong with you guys.

856
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:25,170
I just wanna like, walk
up to him in class and

857
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,731
grab a tissue for you, Jesus.

858
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,265
This road's really empty.

859
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,066
That's gross.

860
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:31,134
Yeah, it really is.

861
01:14:31,535 --> 01:14:34,638
Somethin' spooky's
gonna happen!

862
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:38,542
Woo, yeah!

863
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:41,210
You guys are

864
01:14:41,244 --> 01:14:42,779
stupid, it'll be fine.

865
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,247
I think we're
almost there, yeah.

866
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,083
How 'bout now.

867
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:52,589
I'm gonna make you guys
get out on Clinton Road.

868
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:53,322
No!

869
01:14:53,356 --> 01:14:54,758
Yeah.

870
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:55,825
You shouldn't be scared,

871
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:57,894
what the heck, it's just a road.

872
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,763
Yeah, who cares.

873
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:00,496
Remember, we're gonna prove to

874
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,031
everyone that it's just a myth.

875
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,600
Yeah, prove.

876
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,570
Who's gonna get
eaten, come on.

877
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:09,314
There's gonna be
a cougar, it's gonna

878
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,240
come outta nowhere
and just like rah!

879
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:13,777
Oh, all right.

880
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:16,279
She looked

881
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:17,513
really terrified.

882
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:22,185
OK, I better watch
out for this cougar.

883
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:25,221
You guys are nuts.

884
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,927
You actually get out,
it's gonna come after you.

885
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,195
That's not funny.

886
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:36,566
I think it is.

887
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:37,901
He thinks

888
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:39,068
it is, he's laughing.

889
01:15:39,803 --> 01:15:44,774
Hey, we got the
driver to laugh, woo!

890
01:15:45,008 --> 01:15:47,677
This is an accomplishment.

891
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:50,614
Is this the road?

892
01:15:52,849 --> 01:15:54,383
Are we here?

893
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:55,585
I think so.

894
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:01,157
That means it's time
for you guys to get out.

895
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,225
Is this the road?

896
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:04,493
I thinks so, is it?

897
01:16:04,527 --> 01:16:06,329
I don't know, is it the road?

898
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:08,331
I don't know, you're driving.

899
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,267
All right, let's go.

900
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,568
Get on it, guys.

901
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:14,904
Come on Gabby, we got this.

902
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:15,805
I'm gonna cut
the lights on 'em.

903
01:16:15,839 --> 01:16:17,641
All right.

904
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:18,954
Gonna scare
the crap outta 'em.

905
01:16:19,643 --> 01:16:22,178
Just wait a minute.

906
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:23,780
Oh my God, what
if a cougar really

907
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:25,214
came and ate them?

908
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:33,022
Oh, the
doors are locked, oops.

909
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,259
What's your problem!

910
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:39,328
That scared me!

911
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,931
That was the whole point!

912
01:16:41,965 --> 01:16:43,066
I think she's crying.

913
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:44,934
Oh my God, oh my God.

914
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:46,069
Guys come on,

915
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,837
what was gonna
happen, I mean really.

916
01:16:47,871 --> 01:16:49,405
At least you two
didn't go out there.

917
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,974
We'll take control, come on.

918
01:16:51,007 --> 01:16:52,942
- Yeah.
- I'm driving, I can't.

919
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:54,377
Oh well, I'll drive for you.

920
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,421
I can't do it, you two are
the only two in line, so.

921
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,347
Excuses, excuses!

922
01:16:58,381 --> 01:16:59,582
Yeah.

923
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,417
You had fun,
you're still alive.

924
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,118
That was scary,
I don't think you

925
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:03,019
guys realize that was scary.

926
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:04,387
Hey you guys see those

927
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,354
headlights behind us?

928
01:17:05,388 --> 01:17:06,089
What?

929
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,423
Just kidding, ha ha!

930
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,258
My gosh, stop!

931
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:10,894
What's your problem?

932
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:12,361
No one likes you!

933
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,032
You guys are such babies.

934
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:17,200
What if there

935
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:18,673
really were though,
that's not funny.

936
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:23,004
Are you kidding me, did
you really just say that?

937
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:24,974
Oh gosh.

938
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:26,776
Yeah I really just said that.

939
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,153
Well, don't 'cause
then we have to

940
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:29,412
smell it the whole way.

941
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:31,314
After this road I
need to get a drink.

942
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:32,882
I am thirsty!

943
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:34,483
We should go to Starbucks.

944
01:17:34,517 --> 01:17:35,318
I doubt there's

945
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:37,086
Starbucks out here.

946
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,363
Yeah, on Clinton Road, really?

947
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:39,387
I'm really hungry too.

948
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:42,291
I'll just get
right on that, right.

949
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:45,361
Starbucks is the place!

950
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:46,896
Yeah!

951
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:48,497
I'm gonna get my frappuccino

952
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:50,433
with some whipped cream.

953
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:53,436
Oh, you gotta get a
freakin' muffin on the side.

954
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:55,038
A muffin on the side.

955
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:57,974
Or a cupcake.

956
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,143
The red velvet!

957
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,412
Oh my God, they are so good!

958
01:18:03,446 --> 01:18:05,281
Yeah, oh my God.

959
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:06,382
I don't think you're

960
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:07,751
gonna find that out here.

961
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:09,385
And then I can
put some chocolate

962
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,187
syrup on top.

963
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:14,357
Eww, that sounds really gross.

964
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:17,426
All right, sing a

965
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,395
real song now, this sucks.

966
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,431
Will you guys shut up?

967
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:24,200
You guys are really loud.

968
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,510
There's headlights
behind us, guys.

969
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,370
That's weird, that's the first

970
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:28,403
people I've seen.

971
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:30,774
Oh, there gone,
maybe they turned.

972
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:32,141
Yeah, they're gone.

973
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:33,409
Oh, maybe not.

974
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:34,477
What?

975
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:36,079
Guys, that's kinda weird,

976
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:37,232
why are they flashing at us?

977
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,882
I'm scared.

978
01:18:38,915 --> 01:18:40,416
Oh my God, guys
what are they doing?

979
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:41,284
Don't worry
about it, they're just-

980
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:42,351
- They're getting closer!

981
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:51,294
Go faster!

982
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:54,297
Drive the damn car!

983
01:18:56,966 --> 01:18:58,902
Go faster!

984
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:04,407
Guys, that's just

985
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,450
someone being stupid, it's fine.

986
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,076
Don't worry about it.

987
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,178
They're getting closer!
