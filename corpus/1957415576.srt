00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:54,524
Yeah, it's a real shame.
Isn't it, Bobby?

177
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:56,825
Son, I want you
to think really hard.

178
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,295
I want you to rack
that weed-soaked brain of yours

179
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:01,864
and tell me.

180
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,569
Who do you think that man
could be?

181
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:53,382
Oh, man.

182
00:14:58,688 --> 00:14:59,790
Wow.

183
00:15:02,157 --> 00:15:03,526
I'm lost.

184
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:05,896
I know.

185
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:11,501
How did you know
when it was time to quit?

186
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:23,012
It was ecstasy to me.

187
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,818
And I knew I was...

188
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:30,920
I was doomed.

189
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:32,421
[man] <i>So I...</i>

190
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:34,590
<i>I turned around.</i>

191
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,972
[engine off]

192
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:21,203
[sheriff on radio]
<i>Hunter, you have to come in.</i>

193
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:23,939
<i>If you can hear me,
this isn't the way.</i>

194
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:26,074
<i>You have to come in.</i>

195
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,612
<i>Bring the car back.
We can talk about this.</i>

196
00:16:29,746 --> 00:16:31,981
I gotta find out
what happened to my daughter.

197
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:35,786
<i>We can help you.
Just come back in.</i>

198
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:00,843
[man] There you are.

199
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:03,446
- Hi, Burt.
- Ben, looking good as always.

200
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:05,414
- Thank you.
- Not as good as your sister.

201
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:07,083
- Maggie.
- Thank you so much.

202
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:11,286
Ben, Maggie, this is Chairman
Welmas of the Cabazon nation.

203
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:13,422
They own all of this.

204
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:15,424
Welcome to
Fantasy Springs Resort.

205
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:17,059
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Chairman.

206
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:20,296
I want you to know that your
interests are being protected.

207
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:21,663
Thank you.

208
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:24,032
And I want to introduce you
to my best friend,

209
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,268
Congressman Mike Ellis.

210
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:26,770
It's a pleasure.

211
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:28,605
- Congressman.
- Ben here.

212
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:30,673
My vice president,
my head of security.

213
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:32,842
Basically the brains
behind my whole operation.

214
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:34,577
Tell 'em what we got, Ben.

215
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:37,948
What we've got here is the
biggest aquifer in the Southwest.

216
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,016
Under all that sand,
just a giant river of water.

217
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:42,352
That's right.

218
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:45,221
This is what a billion dollars
looks like on a sunny day.

219
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:48,458
This water deal is what
we've been waiting for.

220
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:51,727
We have the tribe on board.

221
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,296
We're good to go as soon
as we get state approval.

222
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,965
Oh, you'll get
state approval.

223
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:58,401
We've taken care of that.
It's coming in days.

224
00:17:58,534 --> 00:17:59,802
A month from now,

225
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,972
we're gonna be back here
popping champagne.

226
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:16,318
Hey, what's going on?

227
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:18,287
- Nothing.
- Yeah, right.

228
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:21,057
I know when my brother is fine
and when he's not fine.

229
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,760
Plus, that vein in your forehead
is popping out.

230
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,929
- So tell me what's up.
- You always take care of me.

231
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:28,564
- You bet your bottom dollar I do.
- Yes, you do.

232
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:31,266
- I take care of it all, don't I?
- Yes, you do.

233
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:35,372
Listen, if that motherfucker is in
jail and somehow looking for Melissa,

234
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:37,272
we're gonna take care
of him too.

235
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:40,409
'Cause nobody's gonna come between
that water deal and us, okay?

236
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,646
- Right?
- Yes, ma'am.

237
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:44,947
I'll see you inside.

238
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,589
[shotgun cocks]

239
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:58,694
You are one ballsy fuck,
aren't you?

240
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:00,930
This is my home.

241
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:04,066
Yeah, I know that.
I'm here for your son.

242
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:11,307
Dad, what the fuck
is going on here?

243
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,642
Get back inside now.

244
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,677
Where the fuck
is my daughter?

245
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,078
- Who?
- Melissa. That's her bracelet.

246
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:20,648
- Bobby, get back in the house.
- We can take this guy. Fucking shoot him.

247
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:23,985
Tell me where she is right now, and I
won't drop your old man in front of you.

248
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,089
- Get back in the house now.
- What do you want me to do?

249
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:28,357
Get back in the house!

250
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:30,358
Bobby?

251
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:32,861
- I didn't...
- Bobby, shut the fuck up!

252
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:35,197
Wait. What did you say?

253
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:40,502
- What the fuck did you just say?
- I didn't want to do any...

254
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:42,105
Stop talking, Bobby.

255
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:44,173
- We were having fun.
- Who was having fun? Say it! Tell me!

256
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:46,876
- You didn't mean what?
- I didn't want to hurt her.

257
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:53,482
[speakers:
rock music playing]

258
00:19:53,616 --> 00:19:55,384
I'm good.

259
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:56,819
- Mmm.
- Ooh!

260
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:59,254
I'm okay.
[laughing]

261
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:03,158
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is that? What is it?

262
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,559
- This?
- Yeah, yeah.

263
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:07,363
- Bracelet.
- Where'd you get it?

264
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:10,832
From no one. Do you want it?

265
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:12,100
Fuck yeah.
Can I have it?

266
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,971
Yeah. It's yours
with my blessing.

267
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:16,072
I love you.

268
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:17,272
Yeah.

269
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:19,576
- [chattering, laughing]
- [music continues playing]

270
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,645
Oh!

271
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:31,154
[chattering, shouting]

272
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:38,427
She almost spilled my drink!

273
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:41,231
Where the fuck
have you been?

274
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:45,900
Jimmy, you found it
and then you broke it?

275
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:49,104
That's what you get, Jimmy!
That's what you get!

276
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:51,675
[inhaling]

277
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,309
Wow.

278
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:55,678
- What do I fucking do?
- Why would you bring that?

279
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,813
That's a lot.
[laughs]

280
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:03,585
You think that shit's crazy?
You think that shit's crazy?

281
00:21:04,353 --> 00:21:06,790
You should see what I got
in the back.

282
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:15,464
[gasping]

283
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:30,914
- I didn't want to hurt...
- Bobby!

284
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:35,251
Bobby!

285
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:50,099

Bobby?

286

[gasping]

287
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,060
Is he dead?

288
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:21,130
Oh, G...

289
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,509
He's out there!
Go get that piece of shit!

290
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,346
I want his fucking head!

291
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:11,014
[man]
I see him. I see him.

292
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:14,484
Go! Go!

293
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,286
He's on the move.

294
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,061
[men chattering]

He's moving! He's moving!

298

[shouting continues]

299
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:40,009
Fire! Fire! Fire!

300
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:53,789
He's off!
He's running! He's running!

301
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:55,258
In pursuit.

302
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:05,201
Move! Move!

303
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:10,272

[gasping, panting]

305
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:38,067
Fuck!

306
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:44,406
Fuck!

307
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:58,187
[grunting]

308
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:27,050
[chattering continues,
faint]

309
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:52,107
I don't see
the motherfucker.

310
00:25:55,144 --> 00:25:57,413
- [grunting]
- [machine gun fires]

311

[police radio chatter,

313
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:16,798
Mmm.

314
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:20,001
Steve said they were all out of bear
claws, so help yourself.

315
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:21,569
He stole my keys.

316
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:24,140
- Who?
- Jake Hunter.

317
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:25,974
He's on his way
to Nichols' place.

318
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:27,542
- I called CHP.
- [phone rings]

319
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:31,180
- County.
- <i>Bartlett, this is Stone.</i>

320
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:34,015
<i>Get your ass down to Nichols' ranch now.
We have a situation.</i>

321
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:37,386
<i>And don't tell Ms. Sheriff
where you're going. Hurry up.</i>

322
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,722
Okay, yeah,
I'll be there in five.

323
00:26:40,188 --> 00:26:41,456
I gotta go.

324
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:55,771
[sheriff]
<i>Bartlett, do you copy?</i>

325
00:26:55,904 --> 00:26:57,573
Go for Bartlett.

326
00:26:57,705 --> 00:27:01,042
Hey, looks like this guy has been
making his way across state. Over.

327
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:02,677
Fucking give me that.

328
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:05,047
This is Stone.

329
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:08,384
Officer Kim, as opposed to fucking
around and playing private detective,

330
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:09,919
why don't you go write
some parking tickets?

331
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:11,987
<i>Okay? Copy that?</i>

332
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,254
<i>This is under control.</i>

333
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:15,957
[machine gun fire
in distance]

334
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,459
They got him.

335
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:25,300
He's around here somewhere,
I know it.

336
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:27,537
He won't last long
out here.

337
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:31,773
And if you get him in your sights,
you kill him. You understand me?

338
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:36,479
- I ain't never killed anybody before.
- It's never too late to learn.

339
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:49,958
Brock. Brock.

340
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:53,963

342
00:27:58,634 --> 00:28:00,335
I didn't sign up
for this, Stone.

343
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:02,304
- Where are you going?
- To the station.

344
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:04,072
You're not
going anywhere.

345
00:28:04,206 --> 00:28:06,408
- This is out of my jurisdiction, man.
- Goddamn it, stay here!

346
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,678
- No, good luck, man.
- Don't be a pussy! Get back here!

347
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:24,793
Stone, come in.
This is Sarge One.

348
00:28:24,926 --> 00:28:27,295
<i>He's not around here.
We don't know where he's at.</i>

349
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,632
What do you have for me?

350
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:34,402
- I think we lost this motherfucker.
- <i>Meet me at the tree line.</i>

351
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:36,806
We need to send a drone up.

352
00:28:57,826 --> 00:28:59,862
[grunting]

353
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:05,067
No! Don't fucking kill me.
Don't fucking kill me.

354
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,702
Oh, God. Oh, God.

355
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:09,405
Tell me a reason not to put
one in your head right now.

356
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:12,441
Just a fucking cop. Fuck, that hurts.
Please stop that.

357
00:29:12,573 --> 00:29:15,543
- You work with Kim?
- Yes, yes. She's my partner.

358
00:29:15,676 --> 00:29:18,446
- I don't believe you.
- I'm not a dirty cop. I swear, man.

359
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:20,316
Nichols owns the town,
but he doesn't own me.

360
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:22,617
I'm just a fucking cop,
okay?

361
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:25,353
That's why I was leaving.

362
00:29:25,486 --> 00:29:27,288
Please don't kill me, man.
I got a kid.

363
00:29:27,423 --> 00:29:32,059
Okay, you go back to Kim.
You tell her I'm out here. No one else.

364
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:33,528
I-I won't say anything.

365
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:36,365
- I'll come find you.
- Okay, okay. I swear to God.

366
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:38,201
[Bartlett]
Okay.

367
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:49,611
Fuck.

368
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:52,680
Gotta get the fuck
outta here.

369
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:54,317
[grunts]

370
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,256
- [gunfire continues, faint]
- [police radio chatter, faint]

371
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:07,429
Fuck, we lost him.

372
00:30:07,561 --> 00:30:09,365
Handle this motherfucker.

373
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:12,000
Don't worry about it.

374
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:13,736
We got an eye on him.

375
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:03,886
Fuck!

376
00:31:05,954 --> 00:31:08,057
[muttering] Fuck.

377
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:10,292
[groans]

378
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,634
[exhaling sharply]

379
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:24,839
[panting rapidly]

380
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:26,608
[inhales, exhales]

381
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:35,517
Are you hurt? What happened?
What's going on?

382
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:36,752
I'm fine, okay.

383
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:39,253
Nichols' ranch. Shit went bad.

384
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:41,056
- He killed Bobby.
- Oh, my God.

385
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:44,392
He could've fucking killed me.
He let me go.

386
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:48,931
He has a message for you.
He wants you to know where he's at.

387
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:58,441
[police radio chatter]

388
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:03,545
We lost him.

389
00:32:03,678 --> 00:32:05,380
It's just too dark out there.
We can't see shit.

390
00:32:05,513 --> 00:32:08,282
- I know, I know.
- We'll have to resume the search tomorrow.

391
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:10,251
Just keep a perimeter.

392
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,921
Just two ways
out of these fields.

393
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:14,557
Okay.

394
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:21,095
[sighs]
So I was just telling her.

395
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,399
You need anything...
anything... I'm here.

396
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,135
We're family.

397
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:30,039
But I hate to say this.
This can't get out.

398
00:32:30,172 --> 00:32:31,740
- It won't.
- It can't.

399
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:33,175
I know.

400
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:36,511
I mean, I need to know from both of
you, friend to friend,

401
00:32:36,645 --> 00:32:38,580
is there anything else
you're not telling me?

402
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:41,750
- Anything I need to know?
- No, Vic.

403
00:32:42,617 --> 00:32:44,752
This is my business here.
It's on the line.

404
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:47,655
- We're days away from the state funding.
- We know that, Vic.

405
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,625
If you know that,
and you two want your piece,

406
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:53,095
you better
clean this shit up.

407
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:55,230
I mean fucking clean.

408
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:57,032
'Cause kid or no kid,

409
00:32:57,165 --> 00:32:59,768
nothing's getting in the way of
me making half a billion dollars.

410
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:02,805
Nothing and nobody.
You understand?

411
00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:05,007
You understand?

412
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:07,943
Christ.

413
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,617
I'm sorry.

414
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,186
I'm sorry about Bobby.
I'm sorry about what happened.

415
00:33:21,357 --> 00:33:22,924
Fuck.

416
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:25,527
[vehicle door opens]

417
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,146
He told you that?

418
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,013
Yeah.

419
00:33:46,147 --> 00:33:47,582
Why me?

420
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,985
I don't know.

421
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:51,819
We need to call in
the other counties.

422
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:54,790
This is huge.
This is completely insane.

423
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:57,026
Yeah, but then Nichols
will hunt us down too.

424
00:33:57,158 --> 00:34:00,428
- Yeah, so what are we gonna do?
- Keep digging.

425
00:34:00,562 --> 00:34:02,164
I'll head out there
in the morning.

426
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:10,004
Kim, what if
he's playing you?

427
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:12,775
None of this makes sense.
Why would he let you go?

428
00:34:12,908 --> 00:34:15,410
- I don't know.
- And why would he let me go?

429
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:18,379
He said he was looking
for his daughter.

430
00:34:18,513 --> 00:34:22,785
Yeah, well, I have a feeling Bobby
Nichols knows what happened to her.

431
00:34:34,562 --> 00:34:37,031
She's haunting us, Mags.

432
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:40,535
That girl
wants her revenge.

433
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:44,240
No one's gonna
do nothing, okay?

434
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:50,344
We do what we do
for family.

435
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:54,683
That man's gonna die and no
one's gonna know the difference.

436
00:34:56,118 --> 00:35:00,122
We built this business
from the ground up,

437
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:03,191
and I will protect that
at all costs.

438
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:07,229
Bobby was a fuckup
and you know it.

439
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:09,732
Look at this place,
man.

440
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,899
Do you think that he
could have handled this?

441
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,767
No. Why?

442
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:16,738
'Cause it was always
gonna be me and you.

443
00:35:28,115 --> 00:35:29,617
Come here.

444
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:09,357
[gasps, panting]

445
00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:13,295
[echoing,
indistinct voice]

446
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:16,097
Did you fail?

447
00:36:16,664 --> 00:36:18,399
Yeah, did I fail you?

448
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:21,470
No, you didn't fail me.

449
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:25,039
I don't doubt
the job I'm doing.

450
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:28,611
I doubt my ability
to do it.

451
00:36:30,979 --> 00:36:34,383
I'd prefer to be at home
with Melissa.

452
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:38,051
She misses you.

453
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:40,055
I don't have the answers
that you have.

454
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:44,225
I don't have answers.
I'm just comfortable with the question.

455
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:51,733
The home I have with my
family, I destroyed.

456
00:36:54,602 --> 00:37:00,876
There's just so many times you can
take something precious like that away

457
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,647
before it cripples you.

458
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:21,363
[groaning,
panting rapidly]

459
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:13,881
How long
you been smoking?

460
00:38:18,118 --> 00:38:20,055
None of your business.

461
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,690
I mean,
I don't remember.

462
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,860
You don't need
to take care of me.

463
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,595
I can go with Mom.

464
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:29,198
Mom's not better.

465
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,432
And you are?

466
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,368
I'm here.

467
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:36,203
Are you though?

468
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:39,675
You come back after being gone
from who-the-fuck-knows-where.

469
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:41,976
And then you're my dad
all over again?

470
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:44,413
That's not fair.

471
00:38:44,546 --> 00:38:49,617
I'm 18, I have my own life,
my own shit going on.

472
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:52,953
You know, like,
you don't want to deal with that.

473
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:54,655
- I wanna hear it.
- No, you don't.

474
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:57,225
I don't need some in-and-out dad
telling me how to live my life

475
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,227
when he can barely
live his own.

476
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,397
Are you gonna take those shades off
and actually look me in the eye?

477
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,807
You gonna tell me
what happened?

478
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,376
You know I can't.

479
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,914
Well, then guess what.
I'm not gonna tell you where I've been.

480
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:22,883
How's that?

481
00:39:23,017 --> 00:39:24,986
That's not right.
I'm your father.

482
00:39:27,923 --> 00:39:30,859
I don't need a father.
I need a dad.

483
00:39:42,903 --> 00:39:45,973
[helicopter whirring]

484
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,193
[helicopter continues whirring]

485
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:19,441
Okay, let's try it.

486
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:33,856
Stand by. We've reached the property
and dropping off the asset now.

487
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:57,578
Sir. Sir.

488
00:40:57,713 --> 00:41:00,415
Sir, I'm here to escort you to
the property. Right this way.

489
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:01,917
Follow me.

490
00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:23,036
- May I help you?
- Yes, I hope so.

491
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:25,506
- I'm looking for Ben Nichols.
- Okay, and?

492
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,178
And you are baking
something fantastic.

493
00:41:30,312 --> 00:41:33,548
- Is there something you need?
- That smells good. Can I come in?

494
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:35,582
We have a lot going on.

495
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:40,588
A really full day.
We need to take care of some things.

496
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,724
Yeah, I think I can help you
with your present situation.

497
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:46,061
Oh, really.
What situation is that?

498
00:41:46,193 --> 00:41:48,228
The man out in the field.

499
00:41:48,363 --> 00:41:50,330
I'm the only one who's gonna
be able to bring him in.

500
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:53,267
So why don't you
call your brother, Ben,

501
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:57,772
and we'll have some muffins
and a little chat.

502
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,308
Okay?

503
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:04,078
Smells <i>fantastique.</i>

504
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:37,578
[Melissa coughing]

505
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:42,084
We can get you clean.
You just gotta trust this guy.

506
00:42:42,216 --> 00:42:44,117
Trust. Right.

507
00:42:44,252 --> 00:42:46,954
Like you... Can you...
[clears throat]

508
00:42:47,088 --> 00:42:50,191
- Can you just take me home?
- You can't keep going like this.

509
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:52,694
- I just need some sleep.
- Listen, we can get you clean.

510
00:42:52,827 --> 00:42:55,162
We'll do it together. It's gonna be
hell, but we'll do it together.

511
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:56,731
- You won't be alone.
- Okay.

512
00:42:56,865 --> 00:43:00,167
- We can do this.
- Take me home, okay? Please.

513
00:43:09,443 --> 00:43:10,478
Brother.

514
00:43:11,611 --> 00:43:12,646
Hey, Jake.

515
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:16,050
[chuckling]
God Almighty.

516
00:43:16,184 --> 00:43:17,986
Hey. Hey, man.

517
00:43:18,118 --> 00:43:20,254
- Thank you for doing this.
- How are you?

518
00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:23,424
Well, what's on your mind?

519
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:26,026
- What the hell's going on?
- You remember Melissa, right?

520
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,294
[man] I see.

521
00:43:27,428 --> 00:43:28,995
- She grew up a little bit.
- Yeah, she did.

522
00:43:29,129 --> 00:43:31,365
- Hey.
- Hey.

523
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:32,966
You probably don't
remember me, do you?

524
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,702
[Melissa] Nope.

525
00:43:34,836 --> 00:43:37,238
- You were a little tiny thing last time I saw you.
- [clears throat]

526
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:40,975
She's sick now. We gotta get her
in somewhere, and I only trust you.

527
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:44,646
I can't handle it, man.
This was your world.

528
00:43:44,778 --> 00:43:47,148
Yeah, yeah, sure was.

529
00:43:48,482 --> 00:43:49,584
Um...

530
00:43:49,716 --> 00:43:52,186
Can you do this for me?
It's out of my realm.

531
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,955
There's not too many things in this life
you could ask that I wouldn't do for you.

532
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:57,658
I know.

533
00:43:57,792 --> 00:44:00,528
She needs it.
She doesn't trust me.

534
00:44:00,662 --> 00:44:03,897
- [man] Get her in somewhere? What's going on?
- I'm right here.

535
00:44:04,397 --> 00:44:05,732
Literally right here.

536
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:08,269
I know. And you trust him like me.
More than me.

537
00:44:08,401 --> 00:44:09,903
- I don't know him.
- He's been through this.

538
00:44:10,037 --> 00:44:13,273
Your dad and I been doing things
before you were even born.

539
00:44:13,406 --> 00:44:17,245
Listen to what he's telling you.
He's been clean, what, 30 years now?

540
00:44:17,778 --> 00:44:18,913
At least, yeah.

541
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:21,048
And he's helped people
get clean. I trust him.

542
00:44:21,182 --> 00:44:22,917
Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.

543
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:26,588
For what it's worth, I know where
you're at, just looking at you.

544
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:30,323
And I've been there before
myself.

545
00:44:30,457 --> 00:44:34,461
Uh, this ain't no intervention
or any of that stuff.

546
00:44:34,595 --> 00:44:37,466
'Cause I don't even believe in
that, all right?

547
00:44:37,598 --> 00:44:41,135
God bless the people that it
helped, but it didn't work for me.

548
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,472
And that ain't what I'm gonna...
that ain't what I'm thinking of doing.

549
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:47,441
Melissa, take the glasses off.
We're trying to help you.

550
00:44:49,943 --> 00:44:52,012
Well, there you are.
[laughs]

551
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:56,118
[Jake] Okay, you guys are good, right?
I'll get going.

552
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:03,324
[Melissa] <i>Whatever. He can leave.
He does it all the time.</i>

553
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:10,830
[sobbing]

554
00:45:10,964 --> 00:45:13,200
[gasps]

555
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:32,587
Well, first, my condolences.

556
00:45:33,553 --> 00:45:37,425
There's nothing worse
than a parent losing a child.

557
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:39,893
How did you even know
about that?

558
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,731
Well... [chuckles]
let's cut to the chase.

559
00:45:43,865 --> 00:45:47,535
Um, I don't think
you have any idea

560
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:50,538
who you've got
in that field out there.

561
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:52,774
Well, we can take care
of our own.

562
00:45:53,307 --> 00:45:54,575
[chuckles]

563
00:45:57,578 --> 00:46:01,048
I know your security firm
very well.

564
00:46:01,182 --> 00:46:02,750
Okay.

565
00:46:02,883 --> 00:46:07,254
I know you're aligned with
some really deep, deep pockets.

566
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:11,825
And you're in charge
of the security arrangements

567
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:15,463
for some pretty
important corporations.

568
00:46:16,564 --> 00:46:19,334
- Am I right? Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:23,805
Well... Well, your interests
are going to crumble

570
00:46:23,937 --> 00:46:29,410
if you let Jake carry this
to its inescapable conclusion.

571
00:46:34,147 --> 00:46:35,716
He's not gonna stop.

572
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:39,988
He's not gonna stop
until you're dead.

573
00:46:40,854 --> 00:46:42,923
Or he is.

574
00:46:43,057 --> 00:46:44,559
Hmm.

575
00:46:46,227 --> 00:46:47,596
He's dead.

576
00:46:54,836 --> 00:46:59,540
You know,
you and I both know...

577
00:47:00,642 --> 00:47:03,979
we don't have the security
clearances that we used to.

578
00:47:06,347 --> 00:47:11,453
But his level of employment
has not changed.

579
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:16,556
[Ben] Hmm.

580
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:19,026
You got any questions
for me?

581
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,928
Not just now,
thank you very much.

582
00:47:21,062 --> 00:47:23,764
- Appreciate the information.
- You're welcome.

583
00:47:23,897 --> 00:47:25,466
Enjoy your muffin.

584
00:47:26,968 --> 00:47:28,303
[scoffs]

585
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:30,805
[chuckles]

586
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,774
Wake the fuck up!

587
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:13,548
[grunting]

588
00:48:17,218 --> 00:48:19,386
You piece of shit.

589
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:21,788
We found you
like the rat that you are.

590
00:48:21,923 --> 00:48:24,658
Sneaking around and stabbing
guys in the back like a pussy.

591
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:26,761
Don't tickle him.
Make it hurt.

592
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:30,364
I oughta blow your fucking head
off, but it'll go too fast.

593
00:48:45,812 --> 00:48:47,448
You fucking dirty bastard.

594
00:48:47,582 --> 00:48:48,582
You fucking...

595
00:48:48,716 --> 00:48:50,251
I'm gonna kill you.

596
00:48:50,383 --> 00:48:53,120
[groans, coughs]

597
00:48:53,254 --> 00:48:56,491
- [static buzzes]
- [Stone gasping]

598
00:48:57,357 --> 00:48:59,327
Stone, you copy?

599
00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:02,563
[groaning continues]

600
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:06,367
Call them off.

601
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:09,102
That's not how we do things
around here, Deputy Director.

602
00:49:09,236 --> 00:49:11,004
Michaels. Michaels.

603
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:14,041
- Bring them in.
- Bring them in?

604
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:16,443
That guy deserves a fucking
bullet in his fucking head.

605
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:18,078
- No one's bringing him in.
- Mags.

606
00:49:18,213 --> 00:49:21,048
I'm sick of sitting around
having a civilized conversation.

607
00:49:21,182 --> 00:49:23,118
Either you kill him,
or we're killing him.

608
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,519
How is that working out
for you?

609
00:49:30,223 --> 00:49:32,059
[door closes]

610
00:49:37,198 --> 00:49:39,334
Bartlett, on my way.

611
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:41,535
I'll text you when I get there.

612
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:03,758
Slow down.

613
00:50:07,495 --> 00:50:08,930
Slow movements, Hunter.

614
00:50:10,731 --> 00:50:12,801
You gave my partner
coordinates.

615
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:15,537
Here I am. Why?

616
00:50:16,771 --> 00:50:19,207
Stop. This distance is good.

617
00:50:19,339 --> 00:50:22,276
If I wanted to kill you,
I would've done it back at the station.

618
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:23,910
So then what?

619
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:26,047
You're supposed to be
a good cop, right?

620
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,016
Yeah, I am.

621
00:50:29,149 --> 00:50:33,153
Well, these fucks know what happened
to my daughter. Help me take 'em down.

622
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:35,990
- Nichols.
- Yeah.

623
00:50:37,392 --> 00:50:39,426
So do you think they had
something to do with it?

624
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,330
His crew runs the whole town.
They're covering up some shit.

625
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:44,966
Think about it.
You know it's true.

626
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:53,006
You're hurt.
Let me help you.

627
00:50:53,573 --> 00:50:54,943
I'll live.

628
00:50:55,075 --> 00:50:56,543
Her name is Melissa.

629
00:50:56,676 --> 00:50:58,579
Check
your missing persons.

630
00:51:02,617 --> 00:51:06,187
- How will I get ahold of you?
- I'll find you.

631
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:33,180
[coughing]

632
00:51:36,684 --> 00:51:38,720
[groaning]

633
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:43,957
Hunter, let me go.

634
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:47,194
[groans]
You fucking motherfucker!

635
00:51:48,296 --> 00:51:50,064
I'll kill you!

636
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:53,701
- Bobby.
- What about Bobby?

637
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:56,169
Nichols' piece-of-shit kid.
You hang out with him.

638
00:51:56,303 --> 00:51:59,240
He's a nut.
He picks up broads, he gets 'em high.

639
00:51:59,372 --> 00:52:01,708
- That's what they want to do.
- You know these girls?

640
00:52:01,843 --> 00:52:03,544
They're junkies.
They're pieces of trash.

641
00:52:03,678 --> 00:52:08,315
You fucking motherfucker!
I'm gonna kill you if I get out of this!

642
00:52:08,448 --> 00:52:10,318
Nineteen years old, brunette.

643
00:52:11,084 --> 00:52:12,119
Melissa.

644
00:52:13,988 --> 00:52:15,321
[Jake]
<i>He said he loved her.</i>

645
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:17,258
<i>Melissa.
You fucking know who it was.</i>

646
00:52:17,392 --> 00:52:18,725
[Stone]
<i>She was a junkie.</i>

647
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:20,495
- You fucking...
- [screams]

648
00:52:20,627 --> 00:52:24,164
I didn't kill her! Nichols killed her!
I didn't do shit!

649
00:52:24,298 --> 00:52:26,167
[shouting, chattering]

650
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,336
How you doing?

651
00:52:28,468 --> 00:52:30,104
- [man shouts, indistinct]
- Hey.

652
00:52:30,236 --> 00:52:32,338
This is the fucking
Manson Family.

653
00:52:32,472 --> 00:52:35,676
[chattering continues]

654
00:52:39,278 --> 00:52:40,981
[chattering continues]

655
00:52:41,115 --> 00:52:43,984
- What's going on in here?
- Hey, how you doing?

656
00:52:57,932 --> 00:52:59,700
Where's Bobby?

657
00:53:02,403 --> 00:53:03,837
Putting on a clinic.

658
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,838
- Get everyone outta here.
- Shut the fuck up.

659
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:07,673
Get everyone outta here!

660
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:08,908
[man] All right, guys, that's it.
It's a wrap. Let's go.

661
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:11,011
- Hey, Bobby.
- Everybody out!

662
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:13,012
Get off, man.
Show some manners.

663
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,615
- [Stone] Get off!
- Fuck you!

664
00:53:15,749 --> 00:53:16,850
Get outta here.

665
00:53:16,984 --> 00:53:18,352
- You fucking...
- I don't give shit.

666
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,121
- She's in there with me.
- I don't give a shit.

667
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:23,457
- Get the fuck out.
- You heard him, Bobby. Let's go.

668
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:26,928
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Everybody out!

669
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,963
Everybody! All y'all!

670
00:53:31,031 --> 00:53:34,402
I didn't fucking do shit.
It was Nichols who killed her.

671
00:53:35,836 --> 00:53:38,004
- She's not fucking dead.
- [groaning]

672
00:53:38,138 --> 00:53:40,707
You're fucking lying,
you cocksucker.

673
00:53:40,841 --> 00:53:43,944
She's fucking dead!
And I didn't do it!

674
00:53:46,314 --> 00:53:48,816
[Stone moaning quietly]

675
00:53:50,218 --> 00:53:52,220
[gasps, coughing]

676
00:54:10,838 --> 00:54:13,807
I didn't do it.
You gotta let me go, man.

677
00:54:19,245 --> 00:54:20,847
Let me go.

678
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:27,789
[screams, groans]

679
00:54:55,548 --> 00:54:58,118
[no audible sound]

680
00:55:27,046 --> 00:55:29,015
- Mr. Greenberg.
- Great to see you.

681
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:32,086
I can keep this
as tight as you like.

682
00:55:32,218 --> 00:55:34,454
I know. What happens next?

683
00:55:35,189 --> 00:55:36,723
Not sure.

684
00:55:36,856 --> 00:55:38,492
I haven't decided yet.

685
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:42,763
But I like to leave those
kinds of things to chance.

686
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:45,365
I like chance.
Favors the prepared.

687
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,335
You know, I warned them.

688
00:55:48,468 --> 00:55:53,006
I told them nothing was gonna get
in the way of this water deal.

689
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,877
What about your guy,
this, uh... this Hunter?

690
00:55:57,010 --> 00:56:00,313
Hunter's my guy.
I'll take care of him. Don't worry.

691
00:56:00,446 --> 00:56:03,517
Nothing's gonna get
on your skirt, okay?

692
00:56:03,649 --> 00:56:05,084
All right.

693
00:56:05,218 --> 00:56:07,387
Give my regards
to the tribe.

694
00:56:07,854 --> 00:56:09,189
Thanks.

695
00:56:16,062 --> 00:56:18,564
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

696
00:56:18,698 --> 00:56:20,801
Oh. I'm Deputy Kim.

697
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:24,104
- This is the guy they sent in.
- Oh.

698
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,376
- Who are you with again?
- I used to be Jake's boss.

699
00:56:28,908 --> 00:56:30,211
Oh.

700
00:56:31,345 --> 00:56:35,082
So, uh, you got anything
you could share with me?

701
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:37,585
Nothing. I had to go
check on my daughter.

702
00:56:37,718 --> 00:56:38,919
Ah.

703
00:56:39,051 --> 00:56:40,555
Daughters are good.

704
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:48,694
I did call your cell phone,
and there was no answer.

705
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:50,229
Shit.

706
00:56:50,363 --> 00:56:52,199
I must've
left it at home.

707
00:56:52,999 --> 00:56:54,700
I hate when that happens.

708
00:56:54,834 --> 00:56:59,939
So, does Jake have a sister,
a female family member he's close to?

709
00:57:00,073 --> 00:57:05,112
Well, we do know that he's tried to
reach some members of his family,

710
00:57:05,245 --> 00:57:06,714
and we're not
quite sure who.

711
00:57:06,847 --> 00:57:11,952
And he did leave a text message
for his ex-wife. Why?

712
00:57:12,084 --> 00:57:15,121
There may be a lead
I need to follow up on.

713
00:57:15,254 --> 00:57:16,890
It could give us
some more answers.

714
00:57:17,024 --> 00:57:18,925
How many people
know about it?

715
00:57:19,059 --> 00:57:20,627
- No one.
- Great.

716
00:57:21,162 --> 00:57:23,064
Let's keep it that way.

717
00:57:25,598 --> 00:57:29,370
- Were you gonna tell me about this lead?
- [Kim] I was going to.

718
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,410
- Bill, where's Melissa?
- Oh. Hey.

719
00:57:38,245 --> 00:57:40,714
Listen, I...
I knew you were gonna show up.

720
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:43,482
I can't get her on the phone.
Her mother's not picking up.

721
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:46,953
I didn't call you because I
figured she was coming back.

722
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:49,923
What do you mean? I left her with you.
I thought you had your eyes on her.

723
00:57:50,057 --> 00:57:54,595
Yeah, you sure did leave her with me.
You left me with a big, heavy load.

724
00:57:54,727 --> 00:57:58,197
I tried to help you out,
but I ain't no fucking babysitter.

725
00:57:58,332 --> 00:58:00,801
And that's what
it was turning into.

726
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,870
You need a dose of reality.

727
00:58:03,002 --> 00:58:05,872
You're running around
being a superhero.

728
00:58:06,006 --> 00:58:08,709
Big shot. Yeah.
And you're good at it.

729
00:58:09,475 --> 00:58:12,146
But where were you
when she needed you?

730
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,984
I should have told you,
but I didn't want to make it worse, so...

731
00:58:17,117 --> 00:58:18,919
I know where she is.

732
00:58:19,053 --> 00:58:20,621
Where?

733
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:25,191
Ever hear of a place
called the Salton Sea?

734
00:58:25,325 --> 00:58:28,028
Yeah, I know it.
What the fuck is she doing out there?

735
00:58:28,162 --> 00:58:30,731
She's with some drunken asshole
named Bobby.

736
00:58:31,399 --> 00:58:33,701
Some fucking piece of shit.

737
00:58:33,834 --> 00:58:36,303
And God knows what
they're doing over there.

738
00:58:37,171 --> 00:58:38,472
I gotta go find her,
man.

739
00:58:38,604 --> 00:58:41,041
She was trying.

740
00:58:49,982 --> 00:58:53,086
[man] <i>So, how many points of
entry are there into this area?</i>

741
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,423
It's about five square miles
of connected fields.

742
00:58:56,555 --> 00:58:58,291
And exits?

743
00:58:58,425 --> 00:59:02,363
No, it's pretty contained. All farmland.
Only a couple access roads in and out.

744
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:06,933
Well, then
he's there for a reason,

745
00:59:07,066 --> 00:59:09,802
and he's not
looking to escape.

746
00:59:09,937 --> 00:59:13,640
Uh, me and Bartlett are
gonna follow up on something.

747
00:59:13,772 --> 00:59:15,075
[walkie-talkie beeps]

748
00:59:15,207 --> 00:59:18,011
This is Deputy Kim.
This is a restricted channel.

749
00:59:18,812 --> 00:59:20,414
[Jake]
<i>They're all dead.</i>

750
00:59:22,048 --> 00:59:25,385
Jake, son,
you gotta come in.

751
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:27,654
That's not gonna happen.

752
00:59:27,787 --> 00:59:29,222
What do you want?

753
00:59:30,557 --> 00:59:31,591
Answers.

754
00:59:33,193 --> 00:59:35,928
[quietly] What are you gonna
do, son?

755
00:59:36,062 --> 00:59:37,930
Wipe out the whole town?

756
00:59:38,064 --> 00:59:40,634
- <i>No, just them.</i>
- Who's them?

757
00:59:41,568 --> 00:59:43,303
Ask Sheriff Kim.

758
00:59:44,638 --> 00:59:47,473
Jake, you're hurt.

759
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:49,109
You gotta come in.

760
00:59:49,243 --> 00:59:52,279
Don't make me
call in the team.

761
00:59:52,845 --> 00:59:53,813
Don't do that.

762
00:59:53,946 --> 00:59:55,615
You do what you gotta do.

763
00:59:56,716 --> 00:59:59,785
<i>Murph, you know
who I'm here for.</i>

764
00:59:59,919 --> 01:00:01,521
<i>You're gonna wanna know.</i>

765
01:00:02,957 --> 01:00:04,525
<i>It's Melissa.</i>

766
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,675
Okay.

767
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:24,044
<i>They have Melissa.</i>

768
01:00:25,044 --> 01:00:26,414
<i>They killed her.</i>

769
01:00:27,548 --> 01:00:29,482
<i>I'm coming back
for all of them.</i>

770
01:00:30,316 --> 01:00:32,452
<i>You're gonna help me
take them down.</i>

771
01:00:36,656 --> 01:00:38,191
He's coming in.

772
01:00:39,859 --> 01:00:40,993
What?

773
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:44,097
He's bringing the fight
to us.

774
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:48,803
Gear up.

775
01:00:50,236 --> 01:00:54,508
And under no circumstances
do you shoot him.

776
01:01:09,689 --> 01:01:11,524
Amigo!

777
01:01:11,658 --> 01:01:12,892
[speaking Spanish]

778
01:01:13,026 --> 01:01:16,530
[speaking Spanish]

779
01:01:24,403 --> 01:01:26,206
[engine starts]

780
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,314
What is it?

781
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:36,350
This town is plagued
with missing girls.

782
01:01:36,482 --> 01:01:38,551
You think Jake Hunter
knows something about this?

783
01:01:38,685 --> 01:01:41,988
Yeah, I do.
I think that's why he's here.

784
01:01:42,122 --> 01:01:44,758
And I think his daughter's photo
is going up next.

785
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:53,394
[radio chatter, faint]

786
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:25,725
[police radio chatter]

787
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:30,798
[male dispatcher] <i>White van.
Suspects are considered...</i>

788
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,266
[officer] <i>Be advised,
suspect is armed.</i>

789
01:03:33,399 --> 01:03:36,369
[police radio chatter

790
01:03:36,502 --> 01:03:38,271
[female dispatcher]
<i>Copy, westbound headed...</i>

791
01:03:51,283 --> 01:03:53,921
[police radio chatter

792
01:04:22,915 --> 01:04:24,417
[whines]

793
01:04:29,823 --> 01:04:31,392
Taking the shot!

794
01:04:32,258 --> 01:04:34,193
[machine gun fire]

795
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:37,563
I told you no shooting,
goddamn it.

796
01:04:45,305 --> 01:04:48,542
[shouting, faint]

797
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:56,749
[weapon cocks]

798
01:04:59,618 --> 01:05:02,388
[shouting continues]

799
01:05:21,975 --> 01:05:25,011
[machine gun fire]

800
01:05:35,021 --> 01:05:36,522
[groans]

801
01:05:48,334 --> 01:05:49,970
We have to move. Now.

802
01:05:50,102 --> 01:05:52,238
- You two bring the car around right now.
- You got it.

803
01:05:52,372 --> 01:05:54,007
- Go!
- Okay. You drive.

804
01:05:55,374 --> 01:05:56,809
Goddamn it!

805
01:06:05,484 --> 01:06:08,722
[gunfire continues]

806
01:06:18,031 --> 01:06:19,133
[groans]

807
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:26,473
Three forward!

808
01:06:26,606 --> 01:06:28,941
Two left, three right.

809
01:06:42,354 --> 01:06:44,590
[groaning]

810
01:06:52,332 --> 01:06:56,170
[groaning, grunting]

811
01:07:01,307 --> 01:07:04,143
[men shouting]

812
01:07:31,537 --> 01:07:33,439
- Okay, so...
- Sh, shh.

813
01:07:33,573 --> 01:07:36,676
<i>We're in full pursuit.
He's heading into an abandoned church.</i>

814
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:39,646
That's it. Let's go.
Head to the church.

815
01:07:59,564 --> 01:08:01,667
[gunshot]

816
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:29,462
Where are we going?
I don't think this is a good idea.

817
01:08:29,596 --> 01:08:31,865
Stop the car.
Stop the fucking car!

818
01:08:31,998 --> 01:08:33,332
[thud]

819
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:35,102
Shit.

820
01:08:41,306 --> 01:08:44,109
[door opens, closes]

821
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:46,647
- You gonna make it?
- [coughs]

822
01:08:47,846 --> 01:08:49,749
- Take me to Nichols.
- Okay.

823
01:09:02,861 --> 01:09:05,031
How did we get here, Mags?

824
01:09:05,797 --> 01:09:07,899
We had it so perfect.

825
01:09:09,202 --> 01:09:13,106
There's no such thing as perfect.
There's just us.

826
01:09:17,276 --> 01:09:18,744
She's out here.

827
01:09:20,346 --> 01:09:21,848
I can feel her.

828
01:09:21,981 --> 01:09:25,586
No, she is not out here, okay?
Let's go back home. Come on.

829
01:09:28,988 --> 01:09:30,856
Okay, I'm headed back.

830
01:10:22,742 --> 01:10:24,311
Lose the gun.

831
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:35,354
Sit down.

832
01:10:37,923 --> 01:10:39,693
It's gonna be okay.

833
01:10:39,825 --> 01:10:41,895
No, it isn't
gonna be okay.

834
01:10:42,895 --> 01:10:44,529
What do you want?

835
01:10:44,663 --> 01:10:47,934
I want to hear it from your mouth
what happened to my daughter.

836
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:49,769
I don't know
who your daughter is.

837
01:10:49,901 --> 01:10:52,105
- [bones snap]
- [screams]

838
01:10:53,372 --> 01:10:54,908
- I'll break every one of them.
- [groans]

839
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,809
You're a dead man.

840
01:10:56,943 --> 01:10:59,078
Do you know
about Bobby and Melissa?

841
01:10:59,212 --> 01:11:01,147
Do you know about
the drugs he gave her?

842
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,251
- Do you know that he raped her?
- I had no idea.

843
01:11:04,383 --> 01:11:05,318
- [bones snap]
- [screams]

844
01:11:05,452 --> 01:11:07,921
Okay! Fuck! Stop!

845
01:11:09,588 --> 01:11:11,091
All I know...

846
01:11:12,324 --> 01:11:14,626
All I know is
she was causing problems.

847
01:11:14,761 --> 01:11:17,263
- [whimpering]
- So now you know who she is.

848
01:11:17,396 --> 01:11:22,068
I want to hear how she ended up OD'd
and raped in this shithole town.

849
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,936
Bobby told me
that it was an accident.

850
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:28,406
My son had a drug problem.
Your daughter was an addict too.

851
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:31,845
And these kids were partying
and it went too far.

852
01:11:31,977 --> 01:11:33,480
My daughter is gone.

853
01:11:33,613 --> 01:11:35,280
So is my son.

854
01:11:35,914 --> 01:11:38,551
No one
killed your daughter.

855
01:11:38,685 --> 01:11:41,020
It was drugs. She OD'd.

856
01:11:41,154 --> 01:11:42,989
That's fucking bullshit.
That's not how it happened.

857
01:11:43,122 --> 01:11:45,225
It is how it happened!

858
01:11:46,825 --> 01:11:49,361
[grunts] Yeah, go ahead.
Fucking do it.

859
01:11:49,962 --> 01:11:51,364
Go ahead. Do it.

860
01:11:52,832 --> 01:11:56,903
You will never know where her body
is, and you'll never find her.

861
01:11:57,035 --> 01:11:58,605
That's gonna hold up in court.

862
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:02,008
Deputy Bartlett requesting
immediate backup to Nichols Ranch.

863
01:12:02,141 --> 01:12:04,277
Immediate backup
to Nichols Ranch.

864
01:12:04,409 --> 01:12:07,247
[sirens wailing]

865
01:12:12,718 --> 01:12:16,055
[officer on bullhorn] <i>Come out
with your hands up, now.</i>

866
01:12:17,256 --> 01:12:20,827
You let us walk out of here.
That's the only chance you have.

867
01:12:24,596 --> 01:12:26,431
Fuck. Get the fuck up.

868
01:12:26,565 --> 01:12:29,101
Let's go. Get the fuck up.

869
01:12:31,337 --> 01:12:32,971
Okay!

870
01:12:33,105 --> 01:12:35,208
Jake, don't hurt 'em. Don't hurt 'em.
Just bring 'em out.

871
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:37,878
Come on.
Move, you motherfuckers.

872
01:12:38,543 --> 01:12:40,247
Bring 'em down.

873
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:44,450
All right, you fucker!

874
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:46,385
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

875
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:49,354
Jake, put the gun down.

876
01:12:49,488 --> 01:12:52,557
- Put the gun down.
- Put your gun down, please!

877
01:12:52,691 --> 01:12:54,025
Put the gun down!

878
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,761
- Shut the fuck up!
- [Murphy] Nichols, put it down.

879
01:12:56,895 --> 01:13:00,099
- Do you know what they did to Melissa?
- Don't get hurt. Put it down.

880
01:13:00,232 --> 01:13:02,301
Do you know what they did
to my little girl?

881
01:13:02,435 --> 01:13:04,437
Holy shit. She's still
fucking breathing, Dad.

882
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:06,639
- We gotta fucking do something.
- It's too late.

883
01:13:06,771 --> 01:13:08,473
Too late?
She's fucking alive!

884
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,508
- She's halfway dead.
- Halfway dead, my ass.

885
01:13:10,642 --> 01:13:12,877
Are you shitting me? What do you
want to do? What's the game plan?

886
01:13:13,012 --> 01:13:15,782
I want you to be quiet so I can think
for one minute. Can you do that?

887
01:13:15,914 --> 01:13:19,452
- This isn't my fucking fault.
- She's dead because of you, asshole!

888
01:13:19,586 --> 01:13:21,788
- Oh, my God.
- You sick... She's alive!

889
01:13:21,922 --> 01:13:23,823
Let me tell you right now,
you fucking asshole!

890
01:13:23,955 --> 01:13:26,626
- Look at her!
- Can you take it down?

891
01:13:26,758 --> 01:13:28,928
You killed her,
you motherfucker.

892
01:13:33,766 --> 01:13:35,134
[coughs]

893
01:13:35,267 --> 01:13:37,837
- Did you fucking see that?
- All right, take him home.

894
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:39,872
- Dad, I'm fucking sorry, okay?
- Shut up!

895
01:13:40,006 --> 01:13:41,039
Dad, I... Fucking...

896
01:13:41,173 --> 01:13:43,475
Just go home, kid.

897
01:13:49,548 --> 01:13:51,150
Goddamn kids.

898
01:14:16,641 --> 01:14:19,879
[geese honking]

899
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,717
- [Jake] <i>They fucking killed her!</i>
- [Maggie] <i>He's lying!</i>

900
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:00,820
They're covering it up,
this whole sick fucking family!

901
01:15:00,953 --> 01:15:03,522
No one killed your daughter!
She died!

902
01:15:03,655 --> 01:15:05,792
She died
with a needle in her arm, man!

903
01:15:05,925 --> 01:15:07,726
I will kill her
right in front of you!

904
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,930
- You're gonna get yourself killed!
- Go get him!

905
01:15:11,064 --> 01:15:12,464
Put the gun down.

906
01:15:12,597 --> 01:15:14,434
I will do it, Murphy.
I'll kill these motherfuckers.

907
01:15:14,566 --> 01:15:16,135
Everyone has to know
what they did.

908
01:15:16,269 --> 01:15:18,605
It's not gonna
bring her back, man.

909
01:15:24,744 --> 01:15:27,079
Arrest the Nichols.

910
01:15:27,212 --> 01:15:30,348
- Put your hands right there. Freeze!
- Go, go. Go!

911
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:31,751
- Me?
- Yes.

912
01:15:31,885 --> 01:15:33,185
On your knees now!

913
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:34,854
- You are under arrest.
- [Maggie] Why?

914
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:38,425
- You have the right to remain silent.
- [Maggie shouting]

915
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:43,163
[shouting continues,
faint]

916
01:15:51,203 --> 01:15:55,175
[no audible dialogue]

917
01:15:56,909 --> 01:15:58,577
[shouting]

918
01:15:58,711 --> 01:16:00,413
She's hurt her hand.

919
01:16:00,546 --> 01:16:03,115
She's... Her hand is broken.

920
01:16:06,151 --> 01:16:07,386
Let her walk.

921
01:16:18,329 --> 01:16:21,167
[no audible dialogue]

922
01:16:28,973 --> 01:16:30,543
Good work.

923
01:16:39,485 --> 01:16:41,921
Jesus Christ,
you're a fucking mess.

924
01:16:42,053 --> 01:16:45,056
Oh, God. You know,
help is on its way.

925
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:46,925
All right?
You're gonna be good.

926
01:16:47,059 --> 01:16:48,494
All right?

927
01:16:50,895 --> 01:16:52,197
Thank you.

928
01:16:53,298 --> 01:16:54,533
I'm sorry.

929
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:57,669
Life's not fucking fair.

930
01:16:58,971 --> 01:17:00,406
Melissa knows.

931
01:17:05,177 --> 01:17:06,812
You weren't the bad guy.

932
01:17:09,181 --> 01:17:11,684
I'll get a medic.
Stay right here.

933
01:17:28,434 --> 01:17:30,302
[man]
<i>Checking in on you.</i>

934
01:17:30,436 --> 01:17:36,276
I don't know where you ended up,
but I don't like how we last spoke, man.

935
01:17:37,075 --> 01:17:38,476
I know life ain't fair.

936
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:43,283
<i>I know what it's like
to lose my family to the job.</i>

937
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:49,289
<i>But you're a good man, and you know
that I know that you're a good father.</i>

938
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:53,793
<i>Nothing gets us ready
for that mission</i>

939
01:17:53,926 --> 01:17:55,628
<i>of being a dad, right?</i>

940
01:17:57,596 --> 01:18:00,498
<i>Melissa is a good girl.</i>

941
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:02,769
<i>She don't deserve
to be in the mess she's in.</i>

942
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:06,439
<i>But then whoever does?</i>

943
01:18:06,571 --> 01:18:08,641
<i>Look, if you find her,
just hug her.</i>

944
01:18:09,574 --> 01:18:12,444
<i>Tell her everything's
gonna be all right.</i>

945
01:18:13,245 --> 01:18:15,481
<i>She just wants her dad.</i>

946
01:18:17,082 --> 01:18:18,450
<i>You hear me?</i>

947
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,427
<i>Listen, don't let her go.</i>

948
01:18:28,561 --> 01:18:33,766
<i>This world is a fucking cruel
and unforgiving place,</i>

949
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:37,537
<i>and that's why they send men
like me and you out there</i>

950
01:18:38,303 --> 01:18:40,306
<i>into the dark places.</i>

951
01:18:41,339 --> 01:18:44,177
<i>If anyone lays a hand on her
and hurts her,</i>

952
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:48,248
<i>then make sure they get what they
deserve, every last one of them.</i>

953

[footsteps]

955
01:19:37,395 --> 01:19:39,798
She's haunting me,
isn't she?
