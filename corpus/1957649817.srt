1
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,158
(ominous music)

2
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:51,151
- Our story is about a 
man who finds a necklace.

3
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,289
But it's no ordinary necklace.

4
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,891
It's Satan's Necklace.

5
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,063
(heart beating)

6
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,012
(drowned out rock music)

7
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,621
- Nice shot, Stevie Wonder.

8
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,491
(drowned out rock music)

9
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,233
- But Barb, I love you.

10
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,835
Barb?

11
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,304
Barb?

12
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,413
- What a loser.

13
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:57,951
- Man, I really feel 
sorry for that guy.

14
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,554
Every 20 minutes he's on 
the phone with that girl.

15
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,493
If you ask me, I think 
she's stringing him along.

16
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:11,764
Ready for another one, Chuck?

17
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,433
- [Chuck] Yeah.

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,302
(drowned out rock music)

19
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,710
- There you go.

20
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:24,611
- Tom, can I get some pretzels?

21
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,178
- Sure.

22
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,417
There you go.

23
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,320
(drowned out rock music)

24
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,265
- Ah, Mr. Punctuality.

25
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,566
- I've been trying to 
call for the last hour,

26
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,768
but the line's been busy.

27
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,069
Hey, I'll take the usual, Tom.

28
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:50,637
- [Tom] You got it.

29
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:55,875
- Rough day at work, huh?

30
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,677
(chuckling)

31
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,279
- You wouldn't believe the shit 
I had to put up with today.

32
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,250
- There you go.

33
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,251
- Ah, thanks, Tom.

34
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,922
Here I am at this red light,

35
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,757
I'm on my way over here,

36
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,392
and this asshole 
decides to carjack

37
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,826
this lady in front of me

38
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,595
not knowing that I'm a cop.

39
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,162
- [Chuck] Good shit.

40
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,597
- Yeah.

41
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,632
Now, me being Dick 
Fuckin' Tracy,

42
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,302
I gotta apprehend 
this fuckin' idiot.

43
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,436
- [Chuck] Ah, one of 
Baltimore's finest.

44
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,305
- I tell you what.

45
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,773
I deal with more assholes 
than a fuckin' proctologist.

46
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
- [Chuck] Here's 
to our hero, Dan.

47
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,514
- I'll fuckin' drink to that.

48
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,383
(drowned out rock music)

49
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,993
(lighthearted piano music)

50
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,941
Can you believe after only 
being separated for two months

51
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,810
that bitch has her boyfriend 
living in my house,

52
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:04,510
fucking him in my bed,

53
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,081
and I'm still paying 
the God damn mortgage?

54
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:10,817
- Sounds like you're 
getting fucked

55
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:11,851
in more ways than one.

56
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,019
(chuckles)

57
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,886
- Speaking of getting fucked,

58
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,488
I haven't seen pussy in so long

59
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,623
the fuckin' crack of 
dawn looks good to me.

60
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,294
- Dawn, have I met her?

61
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,062
- Dawn?

62
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,330
I got your fuckin' Dawn 
right here buddy, huh?

63
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,034
- Whoa.

64
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,470
- What is it?

65
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,007
- It sounds really big.

66
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,376
(dramatic music)

67
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:46,653
Dan.

68
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,220
- Oh.

69
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,359
Oh, let me see that, yeah.

70
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,330
Yeah, that's nice.

71
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,434
You see, that's a vintage 
Yoo-hoo cap, yeah.

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,001
Let me see now.

73
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,603
- Here it comes.

74
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,438
- Oh yeah, it's 
coming to me now.

75
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,045
This was bottled 
the summer of '92.

76
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,115
What do you think this 
valuable find's worth, huh?

77
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,650
- Hey, maybe enough to 
get you a piece of ass

78
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,085
down the block. 
(chuckling)

79
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,286
- I got your fuckin' ass 
right here buddy, huh?

80
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,520
- Yeah, I got...

81
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,088
Hang on.

82
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,256
- What?

83
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,224
- That's strange.

84
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:58,791
- What?

85
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,128
- I didn't move 
my metal detector

86
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,629
and it just went off again.

87
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,398
- Huh.

88
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,267
Hey, maybe it could be 
another Yoo-hoo cap.

89
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,736
Ooh!

90
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,637
You could have a matching set.

91
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,006
(dramatic music)

92
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,657
Wow.

93
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,458
Looks like you 
finally got something.

94
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,363
What do you think it's worth?

95
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,930
Yo, Chuck.

96
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,133
Earth to Chuck!

97
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:42,835
Come in, Captain Yoo-hoo.

98
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,241
Hey, Chuck.

99
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,742
Hey, easy man.

100
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,111
(dramatic music)

101
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,548
Easy.

102
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,884
(dramatic music)

103
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,390
You all right?

104
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,296
- I just feel lightheaded.

105
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,566
- I think you've been out 
in the fuckin' sun too long.

106
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,111
- I think I had enough, 
let's call it a day.

107
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,212
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

108
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,113
Let's get the fuck outta here.

109
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,783
(dramatic music)

110
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,279
- Look what I found.

111
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,581
- God, you scared me.

112
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,583
Where'd you get it at?

113
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,652
- Me and Dan dug it out at old 
Baker's Field this morning.

114
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,587
- You mean you finally 
found something

115
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,888
other than bottle caps

116
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,823
with that old metal detector?

117
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,091
- I told you I'd find 
something sooner or later.

118
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,195
- Well, I hope you 
worked up an appetite,

119
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:16,796
'cause dinner is ready.

120
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,556
So, how's Dan?

121
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,194
- Not too bad, considering 
what he's been going through.

122
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,798
- [Woman] What do you mean?

123
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,868
- Well, Dan and Stacy split up.

124
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,136
- Are you serious?

125
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:57,703
- Yeah.

126
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,308
And now they're in the 
middle of a legal separation.

127
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,378
- [Woman] They've been 
married for over 10 years.

128
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,415
- Dan's a big boy, 
he'll get over it.

129
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,617
- And what about Stacy?

130
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,088
- What do you mean?

131
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,924
From what Dan tells me, 
she's doing just fine.

132
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,472
I wonder if this necklace 
is worth anything.

133
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,941
- I don't know.

134
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,310
But if you ask me, it 
looks like something

135
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,645
you might've got out of 
a box of Cracker Jack's.

136
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,781
(Chuck mock laughs)

137
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:42,348
- Really.

138
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,521
How's it look?

139
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,023
- [Woman] Mhm.

140
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,791
- Let me check this out.

141
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,502
Hey, this does look pretty good.

142
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,120
- Are you all right, Hun?

143
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,690

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,962
- What does a blonde and 
a computer have in common?

185
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,666
- What's that?

186
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,801
- You don't appreciate 'em 
until they go down on ya!

187
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,703
(laughing)

188
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,487
- Excuse me, man.

189
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,189
- Hey, man!

190
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,358
Look what you fuckin' did.

191
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,359
- I'll buy you another 
drink, man, I'm sorry.

192
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,660
- Not the beer.

193
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,195
Look at my God damn shirt.

194
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,067
Hey, I ain't finished 
with you yet.

195
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,074
- Don't fuck with me.

196
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,345
(catchy rock music)

197
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,287
- Hey, hey, hey.

198
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,021
You all right?

199
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,024
- What?

200
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:12,958
- Shit, for a minute I 
thought you were gonna

201
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,693
kick that motherfucker's ass.

202
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:20,166
- Man.

203
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,772
♪ Though sometimes it 
was quite strange ♪

204
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,445
(wondrous music)

205
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,251
(moaning)

206
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,949
(dramatic music)

207
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,821
(heavy breathing)

208
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,291
- What's wrong?

209
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,464
- Just a nightmare.

210
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,135
- You gonna be all right?

211
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,138
- Yeah.

212
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,987
(ominous music)

213
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,745
- You look like shit, 
didn't you get any sleep?

214
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,381
- [Chuck] Not really.

215
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,085
- You feel all right?

216
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,553
You look like you might be 
coming down with something.

217
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,158
- I feel...

218
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:26,792
So drained.

219
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,061
Damn nightmare.

220
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,299
- [Woman] Was it that bad?

221
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,000
- It was just really weird.

222
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:35,801
- [Woman] What do 
you mean weird?

223
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,639
- We were having sex, right?

224
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,941
- Wait a minute.

225
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,008
Your nightmare 
was us having sex?

226
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,145
- The sex part was fine, it was,

227
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,716
you turned into this hideous 
monster or something.

228
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:55,654
And then...

229
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,225
(woman pukes)

230
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,727
Then you puked all over my face.

231
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,599
- I think you've been watching

232
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,267
too many horror movies.

233
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:11,670
- Yeah, you're probably right.

234
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,382
- Why don't you go 
upstairs and get some rest?

235
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,783
- Maybe later.

236
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,952
I'm just gonna go downstairs

237
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,253
and play with the 
metal detector.

238
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,991
I think a wire's coming 
loose or something.

239
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,531
(dramatic piano music)

240
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,785
(Chuck yawns)

241
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,888
Fuck it then.

242
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,497
(Chuck yawns)

243
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,386
(metal detector falls)

244
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,528
(ominous music)

245
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,778
(monster yells)

246
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,713
(screaming)

247
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:45,858
Oh, fuck.

248
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:50,963
God.

249
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,967
(vacuum running)

250
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,668
- Hey.

251
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,869
You must've got a lot done.

252
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:31,570
You've been down in the basement

253
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,171
for about two hours now.

254
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,011
- Actually, I fell asleep while

255
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:39,945
I was working on 
my metal detector.

256
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,218
- Well, you did need to sleep.

257
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,957
I think I'm gonna go upstairs

258
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,525
and get a nice, hot bubble bath.

259
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,092
All right?

260
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,164
Oh, by the way, the paper came.

261
00:19:59,231 --> 00:19:59,765
It's sitting on the sofa.

262
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,482
- So, where you off to?

263
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,417
- Ah, I was supposed 
to meet a buddy of mine

264
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:18,984
for lunch today.

265
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,454
- Well, I'll talk to 
you later Dan, okay?

266
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,422
- Okay.

267
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:23,989
Take care, Fred.

268
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,026
(dramatic music)

269
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,171
Hey, how's it going, Chuck?

270
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,173
We still gettin' 
together today for lunch?

271
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,541
Ah, that's great.

272
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,043
All right.

273
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,411
I'll probably be by 
then in about an hour

274
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,079
to pick you up, okay?

275
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,748
All right, I'll see you then.

276
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,315
Buh bye.

277
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,358
- [Woman] Hey, who 
was on the phone?

278
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:33,925
- Just Dan.

279
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,065
- [Woman] Chuck?

280
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:40,666
- Yeah, Hun?

281
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,536
- [Woman] Could you come 
up here for a second?

282
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,103
- Sure.

283
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,256
What do you need, huh?

284
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,257
- Well, I just wanted to know

285
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,858
if you wanted to join me, Hun?

286
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,327
If you know what I mean.

287
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,496
- Just give me a minute.

288
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,174
(ominous music)

289
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,081
(growling)

290
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,398
- Hurry it up, Hun.

291
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,832
I'm really getting horny.

292
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,770
- So am I.

293
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,038
(ominous music)

294
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,120
(growling)

295
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,206
(knocking)

296
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:01,807
- Yo, Chuck, you ready?

297
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,281
(loud thud)

298
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,694
Yo Chuck, you up there?

299
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:27,566
Hello?

300
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,008
What the fuck?

301
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,277
(ominous music)

302
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,755
What the fuck?

303
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:24,990
- [Chuck] Going somewhere, Dan?

304
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:27,792
- Chuck?

305
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,396
- I'm afraid Chuck's 
no longer with us.

306
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,066
(ominous music)

307
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,505
(gun fires)

308
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,049
Nice shot, Dan.

309
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,387
But not good enough!

310
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,657
- Yeah?

311
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,224
Fuck you!

312
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,594
(gun fires)

313
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:12,337
Oh, shit.

314
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,840
(ominous music)

315
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:19,811
What the fuck?

316
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:24,849
(growling)

317
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,219
(heart beating)

318
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,088
- Our next story is about a man

319
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,159
who goes off the deep end

320
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:35,760
after catching his 
wife with another man.

321
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,398
It's called Sliced In Coldblood.

322
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,035
(heart beating)

323
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,950
(dramatic piano music)

324
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:10,755
- Don't tell me.

325
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,826
Another late night 
at the office?

326
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,161
- I told you I was gonna 
be late all this week.

327
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,331
- I don't remember 
you saying anything

328
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:20,899
about being late.

329
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:23,968
- Remember last 
week that I told you

330
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,371
that two girls were 
going on vacation,

331
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:27,172
and I had to cover for them.

332
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,878
- Is this gonna be 
an every night thing?

333
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:34,446
- No.

334
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:43,588
- It just doesn't 
matter to you, does it?

335
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,091
- What doesn't matter?

336
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,762
- When was the last time 
we spent any time together?

337
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,531
- Christ, John.

338
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,399
Is that what this is all about?

339
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,268
- It has been a long time.

340
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,972
- I don't believe this.

341
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,075
Here I am busting my ass 
working 12 hours a day

342
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,343
and all you can think 
about is getting fucked?

343
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,245
Well, fuck you!

344
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,878
(ominous music)

345
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,750
Can you turn the light out?

00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:54,532
Please.

369
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:14,619
- Aren't you getting 
a little tired

370
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,387
of sneaking around 
behind his back?

371
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,121
Why don't you just leave him?

372
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,191
- Now's just not the right time.

373
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,959
Look.

374
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,961
John just lost his job,

375
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,329
I don't think he could 
handle it right now.

376
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,731
It's as simple as that.

377
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,804
(ominous music)

378
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,314
- So, what's on the 
agenda for today?

379
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,352
- Well, you could fuck me,

380
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:27,024
or I could fuck you, or 
we could fuck each other.

381
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,229
- Hm, decisions, 
decisions, decisions.

382
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,931
Let's see.

383
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,033
I fucked you last night,

384
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,469
and you fucked me 
the day before,

385
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,837
so why don't we fuck each other?

386
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,740
- Sounds good to me.

387
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,115
(ominous music)

388
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,483
You have any of that wine 
left from last night?

389
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,385
- No, but I have a cold 
bottle of champagne

390
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,953
downstairs in the basement.

391
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,520
- That'll work.

392
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,560
- I'll be right back.

393
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,151
(dramatic music)

394
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,431
- Is everything okay, Bob?

395
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,700
(ominous music)

396
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:23,674
John?

397
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,179
It's not what you think.

398
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,747
We were just friends, really.

399
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,790
- Shut up, bitch!

400
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,159
(dramatic music)

401
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,001
- You fuckin' bastard!

402
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:58,876
- Doesn't shut

403
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:02,713
the fuck up!

404
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:08,419
Bitch!

405
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,484
(screaming)

406
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,255
(ominous music)

407
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,096
(dog barking)

408
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,548
(burping)

409
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,592
- Hey, Bernice!

410
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,427
I need another beer!

411
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:33,297
Bernice!

412
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,301
- Just a minute, I'm coming!

413
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,088
(ominous music)

414
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,608
(groaning)

415
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,566
- Okay, bitch.

416
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,834
One fuckin' scream and 
I'll cut your tongue

417
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,236
out of your throat,

418
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,571
and I'll think nothing about it.

419
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:56,473
- Here, take my money.

420
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,680
- I don't want 
your fuckin' money.

421
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,814
I got kinda something 
else in mind

422
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,785
if you know what I mean.

423
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,387
- Please don't hurt me.

424
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,656
(ominous music)

425
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,900
- 40.

426
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,001
Yeah, we're getting 
ready to come over.

427
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,836
Uh huh.

428
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,973
Yeah, we'll be up 
there in a little bit.

429
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,242
(ominous music)

430
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:53,257
What about?

431
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,894
Well, yeah.

432
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,696
Oh, God, I'm about 
to go, Charlie.

433
00:44:58,762 --> 00:44:59,997
I think somebody wants 
to use the phone.

434
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,265
Yeah, okay.

435
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,266
Talk to you later.

436
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,907
(ominous music)

437
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,911
Hey man, what's your 
fuckin' problem?

438
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,384
Hey, pal, what are you doing?

439
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,355
(groaning)

440
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,624
(ominous music)

441
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,491
(heart beating)

442
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,532
- That's all we have time for.

443
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,033
- Tell us another!

444
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,336
- [Kids] Please!

445
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:13,971
- Well, just one more.

446
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,878
Our last story is about a man 
obsessed with a video game.

447
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,013
It's called Level 21.

448
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,580
- She's-

449
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,414
- I'm not paying you two clowns

450
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,883
to beat off to girly 
magazines all day.

451
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,852
I take it that since you have 
all this time on your hands

452
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:02,619
that you have 
those reports done.

453
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,356
- Well, actually, 
we're kinda stuck.

454
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,659
- Stuck?

455
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,128
- We're kind of stuck 
ending the reports

456
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:15,566
with "Sincerely Yours" 
or "Respectfully Yours".

457
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,768
What do you think was more 
appropriate, Mr. Dobson?

458
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,603
- Hm.

459
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,439
Well, I think "Sincerely 
Yours" would be best.

460
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,209
Yes, that's it, 
"Sincerely Yours".

461
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,276
Oh, I'll take that.

462
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,748
(chuckling)

463
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:40,157
Is there a problem?

464
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,629
- We're just glad to have 
someone like you around

465
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,364
to help us out when we run 
into problems like this.

466
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,302
By the way, I like 
what you've done

467
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,070
with your hair 
today, Mr. Dobson.

468
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:56,640
- Why, thank you.

469
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,317
(laughing)

470
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,318
- You're too much.

471
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,239
- Hey, how's it goin'?

472
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:34,344
- Not too good.

473
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:36,947
- What, having problems?

474
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:40,617
- I'm stuck on level 20 again.

475
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:47,624
- You ready, Dad?

476
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,261
- Ready for what?

477
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:55,265
- Remember?

478
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,334
You promised you'd 
play ball with me.

479
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,869
- Oh, not today.

480
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,103
Look, I'm really busy.

481
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,511
(kid stomps off)

482
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:08,879
- You know what?

483
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,680
You could be a real 
asshole sometimes.

484
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,626
- Hey, that Raisin 
Bran looks pretty good.

485
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:23,193
Why don't you grab a box?

486
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,198
Something wrong?

487
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,700
- Yeah, something's wrong.

488
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,001
I can't believe you 
couldn't tear yourself away

489
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,569
from that damn video game

490
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,938
long enough to play 
catch with your son.

491
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,006
- Yeah, but I'm so 
close to level 21

492
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,008
I could just taste it.

493
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:39,643
- Oh, so this stupid video game

494
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,544
is more important to 
you than your son?

495
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,115
- I know, you're right.

496
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,350
I have been spending too 
much time on that game.

497
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,087
- Look, I didn't 
mean to snap at ya,

498
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,122
it's just Billy was really 
disappointed, you know?

499
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,256
I mean, you did promise him.

500
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,559
- I know, you're right.

501
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,496
I gotta give that 
game a break anyway.

502
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:00,063
- Okay.

503
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:39,169
- Shit!

504
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:41,004
- What's wrong?

505
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,708
- It's this damn game.

506
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,443
It's really starting 
to piss me off.

507
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,512
- Why?

508
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,379
- Well, I can't 
get past level 20.

509
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,482
I got past the first 19 levels

510
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,150
with no problem whatsoever.

511
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:56,486
- So?

512
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,124
- So, I usually blow through 
a game like this in 2 days.

513
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:06,730
- It's probably rigged so you 
can't even get to level 21.

514
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,899
Christ, level 21 probably 
don't even exist!

515
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,170
- No, it's there.

516
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:17,774
- How do you know?

517
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:21,545
- I can feel it.

518
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,148
- Actually, there is a level 21.

519
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,385
But I doubt you'll 
ever get there.

520
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,456
- Now what makes you so sure?

521
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:35,892
Have you ever been to 
level 21 before, Myron?

522
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,164
- Sure, I've been 
there, and beyond.

523
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:44,601
- You've really 
reached level 21?

524
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,972
(chuckling)

525
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,809
- What a weirdo.

526
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,179
He's only been here two weeks

527
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,414
and he thinks he 
knows everything.

528
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,984
- Well, what do 
you know about him?

529
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,119
- Here comes Dobson!

530
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:19,302
- Up and in.

531
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:25,609
Whoa!

532
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,176
- Sweet!

533
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,079
- What did you 
eat for breakfast?

534
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,347
- All ball.

535
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:31,281
- My finger! 
- All ball.

536
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,183
(laughing)

537
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,520
(grunting)

538
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,221
- Yeah!

539
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,123
(laughing)

540
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,297
- Jesus Christ, man.

541
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:50,800
You're playing like shit!

542
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,137
- I know.

543
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,105
I just can't get level 
21 out of my head.

544
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,342
- Not that fuckin' game again.

545
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,277
Come on man, give 
it a break, will ya?

546
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:06,449
Come on, man.

547
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,019
We can still kick 
these guys' asses.

548
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,290
- You girls ready 
to play or what?

549
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:13,857
- [Ron] Let's go.

550
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,601
- How'd it go?

551
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,369
- Well, let's just say me 
and Ron kicked some ass.

552
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,973
Dinner ready yet?

553
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,640
- [Woman] In about an hour.

554
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:31,841
- Okay.

555
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:32,576
Well, I'll be downstairs.

556
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:33,143
- [Woman] All right.

557
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,638
(wondrous music)

558
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,106
- I can't believe it!

559
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:03,707
I finally hit level 21.

560
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:07,944
What the...

561
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,813
(coughing)

562
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,355
(birds chirping)

563
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:43,880
- [Man] Hey!

564
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,615
- Who's there?

565
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:46,182
- [Man] Down here!

566
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,320
- You've got to be 
fuckin' kidding.

567
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,555
This has got to be a dream.

568
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:56,059
- This is no dream, 
this is level 21.

569
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:56,860
- [Bill] What do 
you mean level 21?

570
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,295
- The game!

571
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,296
Don't you remember?

572
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,163
The game you've been playing.

573
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,464
- [Bill] Yeah?

574
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:03,133
- Well, this is level 21.

575
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,002
- But level 21 is 
just a video game.

576
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,774
- Actually, level 1 
to 20 are video games,

577
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,111
but level 21 is 
reality as you can see.

578
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,248
- No, this has to be a dream.

579
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,520
(groaning)

580
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,655
What the hell did 
you do that for?

581
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,190
If this was a dream, you 
would not have felt that!

582
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:29,292
- You little...

583
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:32,128
- Ah, ah, ah.

584
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:34,431
Temper, temper, temper.

585
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,168
You'll never make 
it through level 21

586
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,537
with that attitude,

587
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:41,871
especially if you make 
it to that Dark Overlord.

588
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,108
Oh.

589
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:45,909
I wasn't supposed to say that.

590
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,413
- What do you mean 
Dark Overlord?

591
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:50,980
- I gotta go.

592
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,152
- Where'd he go?

593
00:55:58,621 --> 00:55:59,122
Great!

594
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,058
Now what?

595
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,098
(mysterious music)

596
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,072
(water rushing)

597
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:50,567
What the...

598
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:55,104
Oh, no.

599
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:00,109
Oh, shit.

600
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,413
- No, my friend, 
I'm on your side.

601
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,718
(dramatic music)

602
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,760
(groaning)

603
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,180
- Look out!

604
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,736
(groaning)

605
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,413
(dramatic music)

606
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,416
Boy, that was a close one.

607
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:47,250
- You'll be meeting 
much tougher battles

608
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:48,251
than that, my friend.

609
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,520
- Wait a minute.

610
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,088
I got a couple of questions 
that haven't been answered yet.

611
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,890
And don't tell me 
I'm on level 21.

612
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,425
I've heard enough of that shit

613
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,893
from that little 3 
foot, shin kicking,

614
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,227
disappearing, double 
talking little bastard.

615
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,667
(groaning)

616
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,469
What the fuck?

617
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,805
(dramatic music)

618
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,409
What the hell is it?

619
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:14,310
- I got this one.

620
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,849
(groaning)

621
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,335
(dramatic music)

622
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,124
- You son of a bitch!

623
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,026
(groaning)

624
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:41,164
- Beware...

625
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:43,733
The Dark...

626
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:46,536
Overlord.

627
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,253
- Help!

628
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,955
Somebody help me!

629
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:06,522
Help!

630
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:08,658
Help!

631
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:11,994
Please, somebody help me!

632
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:14,363
Please, help me!

633
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:17,467
Help!

634
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:21,337
Help!

635
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,106
Help me!

636
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:23,840
Somebody help!

637
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:25,942
Help!

638
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:30,980
Please, untie me quick 
before he gets back.

639
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,952
(sobbing)

640
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:38,354
Oh, thank you, thank you.

641
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,622
- Are you all right?

642
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:40,423
- I am now that you're here.

643
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:45,461
But we must hurry.

644
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:46,963
- Oh, don't worry.

645
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,697
I won't let anybody hurt you.

646
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:50,366
- We must hurry now!

647
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:53,436
- Whoa, whoa!

648
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:54,771
What's the hurry?

649
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:56,939
- He'll be back soon, 
we have to go now!

650
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:57,774
- Who will be back soon?

651
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,108
- The Dark Overlord!

652
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,843
(gasps)

653
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:02,678
It's too late.

654
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:04,914
He's already here.

655
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,284
- Where?

656
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,219
I don't see him.

657
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,120
- Don't you see him?

658
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:11,788
He's right here.

659
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,358
- No, I don't.

660
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,727
(dramatic music)

661
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:23,266
- He's right here!

662
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:26,702
- Where?

663
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,074
- Right here.

664
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:32,642
Can't you see me now?

665
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,918
Don't worry, I won't 
let anybody hurt you.

666
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,820
(cackling)

667
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:49,492
- You won't be 
laughing when I shove

668
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,159
my sword down your throat.

669
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,698
- You insipid twit!

670
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,967
Do you really think that 
you're any match for me?

671
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:58,901
The Dark Overlord?

672
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,306
(dramatic music)

673
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:03,873
- You don't scare me.

674
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:06,542
- How bout now?

675
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:10,279
- What's the matter?

676
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:10,847
Afraid to fight me with a sword?

677
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:13,649
- Me?

678
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:14,517
Afraid of the sword?

679
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:16,853
I think not.

680
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,791
(dramatic music)

681
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:37,773
Pretty impressive, 
don't you think?

682
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:52,221
Actually, there is a level 21,

683
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:53,089
but I doubt you'll 
ever get there.

684
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,259
(cackling)

685
01:04:59,328 --> 01:04:59,829
- Myron?

686
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:05,334
(dramatic music)

687
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:21,350
- Game over!

688
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:40,937
- You're right, 
the game is over.

689
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,910
(dramatic music)

690
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:11,033
I win.

691
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,775
(dramatic music)

692
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,265
This is just a dream.

693
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:12,762
- Just in time, 
dinner's almost ready.

694
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:15,431
(knocking)

695
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,133
Would you get that, Hun?

696
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:17,700
- Sure.

697
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,909
- [Myron] Surprise!

698
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:28,778
(laughing)

699
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,682
(heart beating)

700
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,889
- I hope you children 
have enjoyed the stories.

701
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,060
Until next time...

702
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,328
(heart beating)

703
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,805
(dramatic piano music)
