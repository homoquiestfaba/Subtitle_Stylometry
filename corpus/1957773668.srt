1
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:29,491
This is stupid.

2
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:30,911
No it's not, this is awesome.

3
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:31,742
No, it's stupid.

4
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:33,292
How is this scary?

5
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:52,821
Not bad.

6
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:55,781
Well that's cute, they
didn't even make it down to me.

7
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,841
But did you see them run?

8
00:03:57,842 --> 00:03:59,781
I told you this thing would work.

9
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,612
At least it squirts.

10
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:04,552
God, I need a cigarette.

11
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:12,881
Please keep your hands
inside the car at all times.

12
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:15,001
Don't stand up during the ride.

13
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:16,631
Wait for the ride to
come to a complete stop

14
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,212
before getting out.

15
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:23,171
What did I say about smoking?

16
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:25,131
It causes cancer?

17
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,661
That is not what I said.

18
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:28,611
I said no smoking when
you're on the clock,

19
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:30,721
especially in front of the kids.

20
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,171
Or in the park.

21
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,901
And what are you doing?

22
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:35,521
Smoking.

23
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:37,951
No, I'm dying slowly.

24
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:41,421
Mostly from this job, but not entirely.

25
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:42,751
I'm not gonna warn you again.

26
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:43,672
Put it out.

27
00:04:48,842 --> 00:04:51,281
We'll talk about this at
the end of your shift.

28
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:53,151
Close up's in about a half an hour.

29
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:55,121
Once these folks are
done, close the ride down

30
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:58,702
and then come to the
meeting in the lounge.

31
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:17,322
Shit.

32
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:20,762
Oh, so close.

33
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:40,722
Hey, nice throw.

34
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,012
Hey, you won a prize.

35
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:48,492
The dog.

36
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:54,212
There ya go.

37
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:00,552
Hi, Jennifer.

38
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,271
Hi, Mr. Grazier.

39
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:04,981
Looks like it's been a winner's night.

40
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:07,051
Looks that way.

41
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,441
Look, I know that
the park's closing soon

42
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:13,111
but let's not be too generous.

43
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:15,611
I just wanna see a few
extra smiles, that's all.

44
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:17,591
You know, before it all goes away?

45
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:19,921
Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right.

46
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:22,161
A little generosity never hurt anyone.

47
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,591
Hey, are you gonna come
to the meeting later?

48
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:24,422
It'll be quick.

49
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,591
Yeah, sure thing.

50
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,842
I hear this game's fixed.

51
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,791
- Boo.
- Hello.

52
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:05,301
So, are you coming out with us tonight?

53
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:06,142
Oh, I don't know.

54
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:07,072
I haven't talked to Blake.

55
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,201
Have you seen him?

56
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:09,241
Seen him?

57
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,801
He's your boyfriend.

58
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:12,411
He's not my boyfriend.

59
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,091
Well, I don't,

60
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:15,531
why did he say something?

61
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,091
Haven't you guys been on,
like, three dates already?

62
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:19,331
No, I haven't seen him.

63
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:21,371
Tony, have you seen him?

64
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,571
You know, I think he was working

65
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:26,731
the haunted house tonight but
we were over there earlier

66
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:28,741
and didn't see him, so
maybe he was up front

67
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:29,742
taking tickets?

68
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:30,832
I don't know.

69
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,301
What happened to your hand?

70
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:34,162
This guy?

71
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:35,261
It's an occupational hazard.

72
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:36,092
Mm-hm.

73
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,091
- Do you like it?
- Eww, it's so gross.

74
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:39,351
Stop.

75
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,451
Workers comp here I come.

76
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:45,031
Tony just loves showing off
his little stump, don't you?

77
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:46,171
Just for you, babe.

78
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,801
'Cause I'm the only one
that doesn't laugh at it.

79
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:51,051
I'm gonna sneak out for a smoke
before our closing meeting.

80
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:54,111
Cover for me, okay?
- Okay.

81
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,981
Do you need a hand with that?

82
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:57,312
You want a hand?

83
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:04,291
Oh, and hey, if you see Blake

84
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:06,061
can you tell him I'm looking for him?

85
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:07,392
Okay.

86
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:48,992
Blake?

87
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:01,172
Hello?

88
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:05,221
Nice try, Rhodie, nice try.

89
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:06,431
What, not scary enough?

90
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:08,281
I think I've seen that
one a few times before.

91
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:11,861
Oh admit it, you were a little scared.

92
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,282
No, not really.

93
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:15,801
It's the mask isn't it?

94
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,521
I need something better than this.

95
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:18,911
Keep on it.

96
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:23,082
Maybe somethin'
with more.

97
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,501
Are you going to the
party tonight after work?

98
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:39,071
I actually haven't been invited yet.

99
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,811
Have you seen Blake?

100
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:43,181
- Blake? Um, no.
- Yeah.

101
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:45,241
Wasn't he working
the Blue Streak tonight?

102
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:46,082
I was wondering, um--

103
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,091
Do you think you can go find him for me?

104
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:48,901
I need to go change.

105
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,461
I'm sure he'll turn up for the meeting.

106
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:51,511
Hey, and maybe you can scare him

107
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:53,161
with your mask before then.

108
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:54,132
I guess.

109
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:57,071
And I'll see if I can
get you into the party.

110
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:58,162
Okay, sure.

111
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:08,981
Occupado.

112
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:10,071
Oh!

113
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:10,902
Oh, sorry.

114
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:20,611
Thank God this is my
last night in this dump.

115
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:22,731
I'd seriously quit if it weren't.

116
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:24,681
So, are we partying tonight?

117
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:26,711
Is our manager a creepy pervert?

118
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:28,331
Where's your lover boy, Tony?

119
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:31,091
Taking a leak in the little boys room.

120
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:32,551
Roy's picking me up at 11:30.

121
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:34,831
Seriously, what is this shit made of?

122
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:36,181
Oh, and good news.

123
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,821
My parents left the keys
to the liquor cabinet out.

124
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:42,061
There's the life of the party.

125
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:44,031
How about you, Jenny girl, you comin'?

126
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,251
- Oh, no, I don't know.
It's not really my thing.

127
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:49,191
Jen, Jen, Jen, don't be so frigid.

128
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,301
You'll never get lucky with that attitude.

129
00:13:51,302 --> 00:13:53,791
So, how far have you and Blake got?

130
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,701
Far enough.

131
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,981
Really?

132
00:13:56,982 --> 00:14:00,391
Sounds like Blake's still
waiting in the batter's circle.

133
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:02,781
At least let the poor
guy get to second base.

134
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:04,681
You like him, right?

135
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:08,151
Well, yeah, I mean, he's
cute but I don't even know

136
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:09,902
if he likes me, so...

137
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:13,141
Tell you what, bring him to the party.

138
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:14,241
Have a few drinks.

139
00:14:14,242 --> 00:14:15,941
You'll have to pick up that habit, too.

140
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:18,661
Then we'll just see what happens, 'kay?

141
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:19,931
I don't know, it's just--

142
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:22,071
I mean, it's just sex.

143
00:14:22,072 --> 00:14:23,841
Gotta do it sometime.

144
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:26,331
You really don't wanna miss out.

145
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,791
Speaking of missing out.

146
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:29,712
Har, har.

147
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:31,681
One time.

148
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:33,521
More like five.

149
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,301
Tony's got a few problems.

150
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:39,361
Come on, girl, let's get this over with.

151
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:41,782
Got a little somethin' there.

152
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:51,941
Nothin' like a little peer pressure,

153
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:56,021
especially from a cum dumb
strain of future homemaker.

154
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:56,852
Smoke?

155
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:06,241
All right, let's get this started.

156
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:07,961
Where's Blake?

157
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:09,011
I don't know.

158
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:10,721
Maybe he left early.

159
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:11,981
And where's Rhodie?

160
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:14,701
Rhodie's looking for Blake.

161
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,461
Look, I don't call these meetings

162
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:18,091
to listen to myself talk.

163
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:21,521
When I call a meeting I
expect everyone to be here.

164
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,701
Let's get this show on the road.

165
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:26,111
As you all know, Fright
Land's closing down.

166
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:27,561
How could this happen?

167
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:29,081
I'm sure you've all
noticed that the attendance

168
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:30,421
has just dropped off.

169
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:32,921
There's enough funds coming
in to keep the park open.

170
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:35,071
And speaking of funds,
it's gonna take weeks

171
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:36,711
to process your final paychecks.

172
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:37,562
What?

173
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,641
Are you kidding me?

174
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:40,141
Hold on, hold on.

175
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,651
It's part of the bankruptcy filing.

176
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:43,991
All of Mr. Hyde's accounts
are frozen by the bank

177
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:45,881
until all the paperwork
has been processed.

178
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:48,301
Sorry guys, it's not my fault.

179
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:50,391
I've tried everything I
can to keep this park open

180
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,201
by any and all means.

181
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,382
I'm as saddened by it
closing as anyone here.

182
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:58,172
Hi, Henry.

183
00:15:58,173 --> 00:15:59,351
I'm gonna make my rounds and make sure

184
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:02,381
no dumb ass kid is stuck
in a ride somewhere.

185
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,421
Let's try to get outta
here sometime tonight, huh?

186
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,471
No problem, Henry.

187
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:06,302
We're almost done here.

188
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:08,251
Be just a few more minutes.

189
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:12,412
I'll be back in 20 minutes
to let you out the gate.

190
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:28,002
Blake?

191
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:36,782
Oh God.

192
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:09,311
Bit lat for games, isn't it?

193
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:11,031
I was just hoping to scare somebody.

194
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:13,511
Well, it looks like I beat you to it.

195
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,961
I catch you dickin' around out here again,

196
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:18,091
next time I'll just shoot
and not ask any questions.

197
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:18,922
Got it?

198
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:21,482
Fuckin' kids.

199
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:25,642
Hey, have you seen Blake?

200
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:28,462
All right, now you're each gonna have to

201
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:29,751
fill one of these out.

202
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:31,922
Well now, which one is it?

203
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:35,972
Okay.

204
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:44,591
All right, this is so we can guarantee

205
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,101
that you're gonna get
your W-2 forms next year.

206
00:18:46,102 --> 00:18:48,321
You're just gonna have
to fill all this out.

207
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:51,241
If you are a dependent you're
gonna have to mark that.

208
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:54,271
If no one can claim you as a
dependent put a zero there.

209
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:56,611
Hey, so are we still
getting booze for tonight?

210
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:58,431
I think so.

211
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:00,001
But who's gonna get it?

212
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:03,161
Hey, Allison, doesn't
Roy have a fake ID?

213
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:05,761
Yup, he looks like a
mental patient in the photo.

214
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:08,431
Good, so call him up and
let's get some beer here.

215
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:09,932
Are you serious?

216
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:13,051
Drink in the park?

217
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,081
What do you think, Jen?

218
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:17,082
Oh, sure, sounds good.

219
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:20,011
But what about Marty?

220
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,191
Don't worry about Marty.

221
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:22,681
He'll play along.

222
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:23,811
The accidental death form.

223
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:24,762
Be sure that you filled that out.

224
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:28,352
That's for insurance
purposes for the park.

225
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:31,381
Hm, yeah, first name,
last name, home address.

226
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:33,171
That's your home address,
not your mailing address.

227
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,011
Don't mix that up because
then you might not get

228
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:37,422
your W-2 legally.

229
00:19:38,962 --> 00:19:41,191
If you don't have that then
the IRS comes to visit.

230
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:43,192
I know what that's like.

231
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:36,181
Evening.

232
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:38,182
A pack of smokes, too.

233
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,551
Can I see some ID?

234
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:46,382
Sure.

235
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:56,482
Who is this, your dad?

236
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:00,662
Puberty's a bitch.

237
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,062
$44.50.

238
00:22:00,022 --> 00:22:00,992
No, no way.

239
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,431
The boss would have my butt.

240
00:22:02,432 --> 00:22:03,432
Come on, Marty.

241
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:04,981
You're the boss, right?

242
00:22:04,982 --> 00:22:07,871
I mean, just a little party, just us.

243
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:12,161
We'll all be right here
and you can watch us.

244
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:13,381
No!

245
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:14,391
I can't have you drinking.

246
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:15,372
I know we're closing, but--

247
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:16,481
Well, we should celebrate.

248
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:19,021
Just a few drinks among coworkers.

249
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:20,981
I mean, it's just going to be us.

250
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:23,312
Who knows what might happen?

251
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:26,191
That's just the thing, isn't it?

252
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:27,411
That's my concern.

253
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,591
I can't have one of you
idiots getting sloshed

254
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:31,592
and falling into a ride.

255
00:22:35,642 --> 00:22:36,802
Much better.

256
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:42,741
I guess it couldn't hurt.

257
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:45,031
Wait, wait, wait, wait, ground rules.

258
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,671
We keep it inside the park.

259
00:22:46,672 --> 00:22:48,331
We're gonna keep the gate closed

260
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:51,121
and I'm gonna go around and
collect everyone's keys.

261
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:52,451
Is Ray able to bring alcohol?

262
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:53,791
On its way.

263
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:56,042
I'm gonna go get done up.

264
00:22:58,392 --> 00:22:59,851
I'll come with.

265
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:00,971
Easy cowboy.

266
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:02,521
I'll just only be a few minutes.

267
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,061
Wait here.

268
00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:07,301
Oh, now I'm definitely coming.

269
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,731
Here, Rhode.

270
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:09,771
Thanks for the hand.

271
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:10,662
Okay, the joke was old

272
00:23:10,662 --> 00:23:11,642
the first time you told it.

273
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:12,722
Now, come on.

274
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:17,381
Hey, Rhodie, any luck?

275
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:18,481
None.

276
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:21,121
What's Carlee see in that guy anyways?

277
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,741
Probably captain of the football team.

278
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:27,531
Then college star, NFL
quarterback, then payday.

279
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,871
And I'm just another geek.

280
00:23:29,872 --> 00:23:31,681
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay.

281
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:33,262
He can barely read.

282
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:39,001
Hey, actually, we're gonna
all have drinks after this.

283
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,531
Maybe you can have a
drink and talk to her.

284
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:43,891
Since when do you drink?

285
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:45,431
Since tonight?

286
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:46,262
I don't know.

287
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:47,881
It seemed like as a good
a night as any to start.

288
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:48,802
You mean since you and Blake

289
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,611
finally close the night together.

290
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:53,011
I actually haven't
got to see him at all.

291
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:55,081
I wonder what's taking him so long.

292
00:23:55,082 --> 00:23:56,851
I couldn't find him
and Henry didn't know

293
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,771
where he was either.

294
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,951
He shouldn't be gone this long.

295
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:01,751
Hey, I didn't get to
go through all the rides.

296
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,371
I mean, somethin' probably broke.

297
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:05,081
This place is fallin' apart.

298
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,441
Maybe it's a good thing
they're closing it.

299
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:10,782
I mean, you don't want
anybody to get hurt.

300
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:10,092
Hello?

301
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:15,832
Bunch of ungrateful...

302
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:30,792
Hello?

303
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:34,522
Quit screwin' around.

304
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:44,451
You're jumpy.

305
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:45,771
Little scared of the dark?

306
00:25:45,772 --> 00:25:46,722
I ain't scared.

307
00:25:46,723 --> 00:25:48,841
Coulda been a psycho for all I know.

308
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:50,271
Some creep hangin' out in the bushes.

309
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:52,921
A werewolf in the bushes.

310
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:55,001
How am I supposed to get in?

311
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:56,401
Security guard has the keys.

312
00:25:56,402 --> 00:25:57,232
Climb over.

313
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:58,072
You kidding?

314
00:25:58,072 --> 00:25:58,902
Go get the keys.

315
00:25:58,903 --> 00:26:00,621
Henry's making his rounds.

316
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:02,741
Besides, we're not
supposed to be doing this.

317
00:26:02,742 --> 00:26:04,301
Just climb over.

318
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:08,472
Yeah, and pass
the booze through the fence.

319
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:26,231
And now you.

320
00:26:26,232 --> 00:26:28,131
Just like gym class.

321
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:30,091
Shut up, geek.

322
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:31,682
I failed gym class.

323
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:39,001
Hey, what's up?

324
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:40,811
Blake's car is still in the parking lot.

325
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:43,232
He must still be in the park.

326
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:46,361
We partyin' or what?

327
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:47,442
Definitely.

328
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:57,692
Hey, whose van is that?

329
00:27:19,422 --> 00:27:21,261
I still don't get what the big deal is

330
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:23,691
or are you just that
anxious to get him alone?

331
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:26,051
I don't know, it's just weird.

332
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:27,211
I haven't seen him in a few hours

333
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,821
and he wasn't even at the meeting.

334
00:27:28,822 --> 00:27:29,902
Okay, stop.

335
00:27:31,642 --> 00:27:32,472
Here.

336
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:34,791
What?

337
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:38,962
It's not much of a party
if we're all freaked, is it?

338
00:27:40,832 --> 00:27:43,412
Well?

339
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:50,622
Oh my...

340
00:27:56,572 --> 00:27:59,822
Let's party!

341
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:04,101
Feel better?

342
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:07,041
Yes!

343
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:07,872
Mmm.

344
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:29,892
Hey babe, wanna throw me my clothes?

345
00:28:34,772 --> 00:28:35,852
That's funny.

346
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:46,552
Someone here?

347
00:29:00,212 --> 00:29:01,821
Hey!

348
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:03,232
Who's down there?

349
00:29:07,822 --> 00:29:09,742
No kiddin' around, kid.

350
00:29:14,192 --> 00:29:15,692
No foolin' around.

351
00:29:18,202 --> 00:29:20,622
I really will shoot your ass.

352
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,602
You know what?

353
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:36,431
I feel like french fries.

354
00:29:36,432 --> 00:29:37,262
Really?

355
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:40,771
The booze is definitely here by now.

356
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,211
Let's just go back.

357
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:44,691
Marty showed me how to
use the deep fryer once.

358
00:29:44,692 --> 00:29:45,951
I'm pretty sure he just wanted to see me

359
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,921
bend over and pick up potatoes.

360
00:29:47,922 --> 00:29:49,342
Yeah, probably.

361
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:56,362
Hello?

362
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:03,602
The park is closed.

363
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:11,272
The hours of operation are four p.m.

364
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,192
until 10 p.m.

365
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:07,692
I'm sick of this.

366
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:36,381
This is going to be great.

367
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:38,321
Better than any party at Carlee's house.

368
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:40,521
Maybe we could try out a ride or two.

369
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:42,972
Pervert.

370
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:07,862
Who's got a light?

371
00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:20,781
Where are you going?

372
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:22,041
Gonna go check the security office

373
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,941
and see if Henry saw Blake.

374
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,121
His car's still in the parking lot.

375
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:26,872
I'll come with you.

376
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:31,681
Buddy, try not to drink
it all at once, okay?

377
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:32,971
Do I know you?

378
00:32:32,972 --> 00:32:36,141
No, but I'm the boss
and I say take it easy.

379
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:38,131
Sure thing, boss.

380
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:39,151
Take it easy.

381
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:39,982
Dick.

382
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:40,952
What's his deal?

383
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:42,321
- Creepy, right?
- Yeah.

384
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:44,211
I heard he put a peep
hole in the girls bathroom.

385
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,202
- What?
- Yeah.

386
00:32:45,203 --> 00:32:46,951
Disgusting.
- All right, car keys.

387
00:32:46,952 --> 00:32:47,782
Hand 'em over.

388
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:48,612
You, too, Rhodie.

389
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:50,782
Get over here, no arguing.

390
00:32:54,112 --> 00:32:55,931
Dude, that's my mom's car.

391
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,691
You know he's gonna drive your car.

392
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:58,592
He better not.

393
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:02,092
He's going to.

394
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:57,941
He must still be making his rounds.

395
00:33:57,942 --> 00:33:59,532
This feels weird.

396
00:34:00,402 --> 00:34:02,551
What do you mean?

397
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:04,621
No one's seen Blake.

398
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:05,861
Henry's behind schedule.

399
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:08,801
He's usually 20 minutes exactly.

400
00:34:08,802 --> 00:34:10,962
Maybe he ran into Blake.

401
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:14,021
It's a big park.

402
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,692
Come on, we'll walk.

403
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:26,801
So, what are you gonna
do when the park closes.

404
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:28,861
I'm not sure.

405
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:32,141
I mean, this was just a
high school job and stuff.

406
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:34,972
So, probably graduate high school.

407
00:34:37,182 --> 00:34:39,751
Go to college, get a career.

408
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:42,701
Those are some big plans.

409
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:45,721
I've been here for 15 years.

410
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:48,071
It's all I know anymore.

411
00:34:48,072 --> 00:34:50,081
Mr. Hyde, he's done everything

412
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:51,701
to try to keep this place open,

413
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:54,111
but the money's just not coming in.

414
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:56,931
I guess people don't care about
amusement parks these days.

415
00:34:56,932 --> 00:34:59,261
I guess different times.

416
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:00,092
I guess.

417
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:03,681
I'd give anything to keep this place open,

418
00:35:03,682 --> 00:35:06,051
even just a little while longer.

419
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:10,222
I'm guess I'm gonna have to
start thinking of a new career.

420
00:35:14,832 --> 00:35:16,851
Hey, thanks
for coming around with me.

421
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:19,091
This place gets really creepy at night.

422
00:35:19,092 --> 00:35:20,641
Not a problem, happy to help.

423
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:21,991
Can't let a young lady walk around

424
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:24,622
a dark amusement park by herself.

425
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,851
- Oh!
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

426
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:30,111
Oh, no way.

427
00:35:30,112 --> 00:35:32,641
Manager Martin is in the party?

428
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:35,661
I see you're using the women's now.

429
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:38,461
We were just talkin', Marty.

430
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:39,601
The party's in the lounge.

431
00:35:39,602 --> 00:35:41,522
Let's keep it in there.

432
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:10,481
Yeah, it's really sad about the park.

433
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,961
But you know, I'm sure
you'll find something.

434
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,451
Yeah, it's not the end of the world.

435
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:17,961
I'm sure we'll both find something.

436
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:20,471
So, Blake. Any ideas?

437
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:24,591
Well, his car is still here,
so he has to be somewhere.

438
00:36:24,592 --> 00:36:28,752
So, there's something
that I wanted to ask you.

439
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:33,952
Um, I think we should
get back to the party.

440
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:52,952
What?

441
00:36:54,022 --> 00:36:56,961
The lights in the haunted house are on.

442
00:36:56,962 --> 00:36:58,471
And?

443
00:36:58,472 --> 00:37:01,302
I coulda sworn I turned 'em off.

444
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:04,831
Where are you going?

445
00:37:04,832 --> 00:37:06,791
I'm gonna go turn the lights off.

446
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:07,672
But...

447
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:09,561
Babe, just fire it up.

448
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:11,142
I'll be right back.

449
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,782
Okay, this is the end of the park.

450
00:37:35,232 --> 00:37:36,062
I give up.

451
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:38,631
Stupid question, but
have you thought about

452
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:40,701
just calling him?

453
00:37:40,702 --> 00:37:44,031
Yes, I called him and
I got his voicemail.

454
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:47,691
Although, that would've been a lot easier.

455
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:49,841
Well, let's head back to the party.

456
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:53,422
We'll have some fun
and wait for him there.

457
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:57,552
Hey, who is that?

458
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:03,941
It's not one of my actors.

459
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:06,942
I don't recognize the outfit either.

460
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:11,461
I don't like this.

461
00:38:11,462 --> 00:38:12,632
What do we do?

462
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:14,862
We should go.

463
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:19,141
No, no, I wanna see who that is.

464
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:21,142
What are you gonna do?

465
00:38:34,432 --> 00:38:36,602
Oh, there's another one.

466
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:41,311
Who are these people?

467
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:42,142
No idea.

468
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,292
We have to tell the others.

469
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:19,162
Hey, Blake.

470
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:37,682
Tony?

471
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:48,732
Tony?

472
00:39:51,312 --> 00:39:52,652
Don't freak out.

473
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:57,322
Don't freak out.

474
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:53,292
Carlee.

475
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:55,712
Carlee.

476
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,702
Fuck!

477
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:27,852
Boo.

478
00:41:31,052 --> 00:41:32,431
Oh, hey.

479
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:33,941
Tired of the little show?

480
00:41:33,942 --> 00:41:38,102
Well, after 45 minutes
it does start to get old.

481
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:42,591
God, I can't wait to
be done with this place.

482
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:44,101
It's not that bad.

483
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,721
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

484
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:48,291
You don't have molester
Marty watching over you.

485
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:50,411
Or the female duo of
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum

486
00:41:50,412 --> 00:41:51,571
to put up with.

487
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:54,822
Just 'cause they don't like Twilight?

488
00:41:58,562 --> 00:42:01,101
You know sometimes,
when I'm here at work,

489
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:05,091
I just fantasize about being
crushed in the gears of a ride.

490
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:07,842
Neat.

491
00:42:18,782 --> 00:42:19,612
Hello?

492
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:23,922
Is someone there?

493
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:28,841
Can you help me?

494
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:31,381
This isn't fuckin' funny.

495
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,432
Get me outta here.

496
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:38,572
Who the fuck are you?

497
00:42:39,732 --> 00:42:42,652
What the fuck did you do to Carlee?

498
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,671
What are you doing?

499
00:42:47,672 --> 00:42:50,462
I'm working.

500
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,291
This had better not be a joke.

501
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:06,122
Not me.

502
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,451
What the fuck?

503
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:43,931
There's someone in the park.

504
00:43:43,932 --> 00:43:45,081
Yeah, his name is woody.

505
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:47,171
He'd appreciate if you left.

506
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:48,421
Who is it?

507
00:43:48,422 --> 00:43:49,402
There are people in the park.

508
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:50,441
They're wearing masks.

509
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:51,591
Jen, this isn't funny.

510
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:52,941
I'm being serious.

511
00:43:52,942 --> 00:43:55,501
It's that little geek
messin' around outside,

512
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:57,291
playin' his jokes.

513
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:58,222
No, no.

514
00:43:58,223 --> 00:43:59,371
There were two people.

515
00:43:59,372 --> 00:44:00,981
There were two people in masks.

516
00:44:00,982 --> 00:44:02,411
I don't like this.

517
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:04,261
Where's everybody else?

518
00:44:04,262 --> 00:44:05,262
Where's Rhodie?

519
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:06,321
See, exactly.

520
00:44:06,322 --> 00:44:07,931
It's the little asshole.

521
00:44:07,932 --> 00:44:08,872
How do we know the masked person

522
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:11,001
isn't just Rhodie and
Blake messing around?

523
00:44:11,002 --> 00:44:14,001
No, no, I don't think so.

524
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:15,791
I think we have to call the police.

525
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,551
Whoa, whoa, wait.

526
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:19,411
I bought all that booze with a fake ID

527
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:23,051
and we have a bunch of underagers here.

528
00:44:23,052 --> 00:44:25,311
I can't find my phone.

529
00:44:25,312 --> 00:44:27,851
Am I the only thinking logically here?

530
00:44:27,852 --> 00:44:30,161
Let me try the office.

531
00:44:30,162 --> 00:44:34,332
I think you're gettin'
a little jumpy about this.

532
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:39,262
The phone's dead!

533
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,682
I can't call out.

534
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:57,862
- Is that--
- Blood?

535
00:45:14,382 --> 00:45:15,461
This is weird.

536
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,141
No it's not, Allison, it's stupid.

537
00:45:17,142 --> 00:45:18,112
We have to go for help.

538
00:45:18,113 --> 00:45:19,221
Knock yourself out.

539
00:45:19,222 --> 00:45:21,061
I'm puttin' an end to this shit.

540
00:45:21,062 --> 00:45:22,071
Where are you going?

541
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:26,242
I'm gonna find the geek
and punch him in the mouth.

542
00:45:28,152 --> 00:45:29,152
Roy, wait.

543
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:31,261
This isn't a joke.

544
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,641
We have to get a hold of the police.

545
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:34,181
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

546
00:45:34,182 --> 00:45:35,591
You girls can stay here,

547
00:45:35,592 --> 00:45:38,371
get your panties knotted, freak out.

548
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:42,042
I'm gonna go find the
geek and kick his ass.

549
00:46:09,282 --> 00:46:12,862
911,
what is your emergency?

550
00:46:14,132 --> 00:46:15,082
Hello?

551
00:46:24,652 --> 00:46:26,562
Hello, is anyone there?

552
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:32,482
Hello?

553
00:46:36,372 --> 00:46:39,372
Do you need us to send a patrol car?

554
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:47,362
Stay on the line as we try
to trace your location.

555
00:47:19,992 --> 00:47:23,541
I don't think Roy's coming back.

556
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:26,271
We can't call for help,
so we have to leave.

557
00:47:26,272 --> 00:47:28,201
What about Roy?

558
00:47:28,202 --> 00:47:30,641
Allison, we have to
get to the police, okay?

559
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:32,021
These men could be dangerous.

560
00:47:32,022 --> 00:47:33,731
And you just wanna leave Roy?

561
00:47:33,732 --> 00:47:35,711
No, he'll be fine, okay.

562
00:47:35,712 --> 00:47:37,382
We should leave now.

563
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:39,762
He can catch up.

564
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:54,121
That's not a park lock.

565
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:56,571
Someone doesn't want us to get out.

566
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:57,761
Help!

567
00:47:57,762 --> 00:47:59,211
Help us!

568
00:47:59,212 --> 00:48:01,241
Maybe we can go up and over.

569
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:02,072
Maybe.

570
00:48:02,073 --> 00:48:04,072
Here, give me your foot.

571
00:48:11,782 --> 00:48:13,532
Go! Run!

572
00:48:40,082 --> 00:48:41,121
Kitchen.

573
00:48:41,122 --> 00:48:42,542
Are you hungry?

574
00:48:59,332 --> 00:49:00,162
Take this.

575
00:49:00,163 --> 00:49:01,361
What am I supposed to do with this?

576
00:49:01,362 --> 00:49:02,192
Use it.

577
00:49:39,072 --> 00:49:41,391
Jesus, Rhodie, what the fu...

578
00:49:41,392 --> 00:49:42,731
I saw you come in here.

579
00:49:42,732 --> 00:49:43,682
Oh my God.

580
00:49:43,683 --> 00:49:44,831
Oh my God.

581
00:49:44,832 --> 00:49:46,531
It's not mine, I'm okay.

582
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:47,472
It's Tony's.

583
00:49:47,473 --> 00:49:48,812
What happened?

584
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:51,212
Tony's dead.

585
00:49:52,882 --> 00:49:54,221
Where's Missi?

586
00:49:54,222 --> 00:49:55,152
I don't know.

587
00:49:55,153 --> 00:49:56,521
She ran off.

588
00:49:56,522 --> 00:49:58,522
We gotta get outta here.

589
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:09,832
What is it?

590
00:50:11,202 --> 00:50:15,372
If someone was out there the
security light would turn on.

591
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,531
Shit, it's just a freezer.

592
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,702
We can't get out this way.

593
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:32,312
Hi there.

594
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,942
Don't go just yet.

595
00:53:13,212 --> 00:53:14,982
Look at that purty mouth.

596
00:53:22,392 --> 00:53:23,691
Look at you.

597
00:53:23,692 --> 00:53:26,352
Look at you, puttin' up a fight.

598
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:35,001
Go on and fight, you purty mouth.

599
00:53:35,002 --> 00:53:36,002
That's okay.

600
00:53:40,712 --> 00:53:44,992
Fightin' just makes the blue knot tighter.

601
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:47,312
Hey, ugly.

602
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:06,672
Rhodie.

603
00:54:18,262 --> 00:54:19,762
Where's Allison?

604
00:54:39,732 --> 00:54:40,932
Allison.

605
00:54:43,172 --> 00:54:44,631
What ya doin', boy?

606
00:54:44,632 --> 00:54:45,882
Playin' cowboy?

607
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:50,722
You know what happens
to cowboys, don't ya?

608
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:53,932
They get scalped.

609
00:55:08,022 --> 00:55:10,561
I'm your cowboy.

610
00:55:10,562 --> 00:55:12,062
I'm gonna save ya.

611
00:55:12,932 --> 00:55:16,081
We're gonna ride off into the sunset.

612
00:55:16,082 --> 00:55:18,281
Wait, what's that?

613
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,881
Woo woo woo woo woo woo!

614
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:22,131
Injuns!

615
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:22,962
I'm dead.

616
00:55:26,352 --> 00:55:28,522
Looks like it's just you and me now.

617
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,201
How is it?

618
00:55:58,202 --> 00:56:00,361
There goes my Olympic sprinting career.

619
00:56:00,362 --> 00:56:03,181
Can you walk?

620
00:56:03,182 --> 00:56:05,432
No, no, I don't think so.

621
00:56:06,512 --> 00:56:11,121
Wait, there's a wheelchair
over at the first aid station.

622
00:56:11,122 --> 00:56:13,311
That's on the other side of the park.

623
00:56:13,312 --> 00:56:14,951
Maybe you can go get it.

624
00:56:14,952 --> 00:56:15,872
I'll wait here.

625
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,431
No, I'm not leaving you here, okay?

626
00:56:17,432 --> 00:56:20,352
There's a better place we can hide.

627
00:56:21,972 --> 00:56:24,302
Ogre, where you be, dummy?

628
00:56:32,152 --> 00:56:33,402
You dented can.

629
00:56:34,532 --> 00:56:37,271
I oughta leave your ass in here.

630
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:39,432
Come on, party's not over.

631
00:56:43,062 --> 00:56:44,152
Shh, quiet.

632
00:56:50,262 --> 00:56:51,202
Wait.
- What?

633
00:56:51,203 --> 00:56:53,671
What, now's our chance.

634
00:56:53,672 --> 00:56:54,821
He might be coming right back.

635
00:56:54,822 --> 00:56:55,652
We can't just--

636
00:56:55,653 --> 00:56:58,992
No, that's a risk we have to take, okay?

637
00:57:00,912 --> 00:57:01,742
Help.

638
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:03,852
It's Allison.

639
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:07,852
Wait here.

640
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,222
Are you okay?

641
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:21,892
Come on.

642
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:30,072
Marty!

643
00:57:32,112 --> 00:57:32,952
Come on.

644
00:57:50,772 --> 00:57:51,862
Marty! Marty!

645
00:57:56,242 --> 00:57:58,562
Marty, over here, Marty!

646
00:58:20,702 --> 00:58:21,702
Marty, help!

647
00:59:51,182 --> 00:59:52,012
Henry?

648
00:59:57,362 --> 00:59:58,692
No one's home.

649
01:00:03,772 --> 01:00:06,361
What the hell were you doing back there?

650
01:00:06,362 --> 01:00:07,401
I, I panicked.

651
01:00:07,402 --> 01:00:08,252
You panicked?

652
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:10,661
Allison is dead if ya haven't noticed!

653
01:00:10,662 --> 01:00:13,091
Everyone except us is
either dead or missing.

654
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:15,871
Ah!

655
01:00:15,872 --> 01:00:16,762
And you know what?

656
01:00:16,763 --> 01:00:18,811
You've been acting strange all night.

657
01:00:18,812 --> 01:00:20,101
What's going on?

658
01:00:20,102 --> 01:00:22,711
I think that you know something.

659
01:00:22,712 --> 01:00:24,771
I don't know what's happening.

660
01:00:24,772 --> 01:00:27,352
I have no idea what's going on.

661
01:00:28,852 --> 01:00:29,682
Wait, wait, wait.

662
01:00:29,683 --> 01:00:31,951
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

663
01:00:31,952 --> 01:00:33,671
There's one thing, just one thing.

664
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:36,871
This didn't occur to me
until just now, okay?

665
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:39,571
This was, like, months ago.

666
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:42,101
A couple months back I was in town

667
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:44,772
to see Mr. Hyde, the park owner.

668
01:00:55,672 --> 01:00:58,592
Ah, Marty, come on in.

669
01:01:02,552 --> 01:01:04,661
Mr. Hyde, I have last
month's numbers right here.

670
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:05,811
Ah, good.

671
01:01:05,812 --> 01:01:07,731
Right on time.

672
01:01:07,732 --> 01:01:08,732
Take a seat.

673
01:01:16,692 --> 01:01:19,532
Looks like more of the same to me.

674
01:01:23,522 --> 01:01:28,081
People just don't want to go
to the amusement park anymore.

675
01:01:28,082 --> 01:01:32,221
They have their own
massive budgets, expenses.

676
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:35,011
Everybody's cutting back.

677
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:37,361
It could just be the summer season, sir.

678
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:38,371
Maybe come fall--

679
01:01:38,372 --> 01:01:41,141
We just don't have
enough revenue coming in

680
01:01:41,142 --> 01:01:43,561
to keep Fright Land open that long, Marty.

681
01:01:43,562 --> 01:01:45,591
It's as simple as that.

682
01:01:45,592 --> 01:01:48,301
People don't want to ride roller coasters

683
01:01:48,302 --> 01:01:50,382
and brave haunted houses.

684
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:56,042
They're happy to ride the sofa
and brave the commercials.

685
01:01:57,062 --> 01:01:59,651
If only we could bring in a new ride

686
01:01:59,652 --> 01:02:01,902
or promotions or something.

687
01:02:03,902 --> 01:02:06,401
Oh, we need to go
way beyond that, Marty.

688
01:02:06,402 --> 01:02:10,152
We need something novel,
something different.

689
01:02:11,032 --> 01:02:13,701
You see, when my father
first opened Fright Land,

690
01:02:13,702 --> 01:02:16,401
he could bring people
here and there in droves

691
01:02:16,402 --> 01:02:18,521
just by opening a new ride.

692
01:02:18,522 --> 01:02:23,411
They all wanted to be here
just to see the latest thing.

693
01:02:23,412 --> 01:02:25,082
That's what we need.

694
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:27,272
Like what?

695
01:02:28,602 --> 01:02:30,271
Something that people would have to

696
01:02:30,272 --> 01:02:32,272
come here to experience.

697
01:02:33,832 --> 01:02:35,002
Something big.

698
01:02:36,602 --> 01:02:37,772
Almost like...

699
01:02:40,912 --> 01:02:42,731
Like an accident.

700
01:02:42,732 --> 01:02:46,521
I'm sorry, sir, what kind of accident?

701
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:50,941
Suppose something
sensational were to happen

702
01:02:50,942 --> 01:02:52,251
right here in the park.

703
01:02:52,252 --> 01:02:53,441
Something terrible even.

704
01:02:53,442 --> 01:02:54,981
People love bad news, don't they?

705
01:02:54,982 --> 01:02:57,331
They can't get enough
of it, they lap it up.

706
01:02:57,332 --> 01:02:59,491
Everybody would want to come here

707
01:02:59,492 --> 01:03:01,631
to be in the place where it happened.

708
01:03:01,632 --> 01:03:02,821
Think of the news coverage.

709
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:04,001
Think of the publicity!

710
01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:05,841
We could theme the rides!

711
01:03:05,842 --> 01:03:07,951
We could sell souvenirs!

712
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:10,151
It'd be the talk of the
town and we would have

713
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:14,322
an attraction here that no
other amusement park would have.

714
01:03:15,682 --> 01:03:18,321
Get your photograph
taken right here where--

715
01:03:18,322 --> 01:03:22,261
I'm sorry, sir, I'm
afraid I still don't follow.

716
01:03:22,262 --> 01:03:23,262
An accident?

717
01:03:24,562 --> 01:03:27,921
Would this be, like, a promotional event?

718
01:03:27,922 --> 01:03:29,422
Like a coupon day?

719
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:34,381
Oh no, Marty.

720
01:03:34,382 --> 01:03:36,042
Much more than that.

721
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:43,232
We would never have to
worry about profits again.

722
01:03:46,932 --> 01:03:49,521
And you didn't say anything!

723
01:03:49,522 --> 01:03:52,231
I didn't known he
meant killing all of us.

724
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:54,311
I thought he meant staging something.

725
01:03:54,312 --> 01:03:55,761
Like what?

726
01:03:55,762 --> 01:03:57,012
I don't know.

727
01:03:58,172 --> 01:03:59,332
Just not this.

728
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:02,651
It's the Manson family all over again.

729
01:04:02,652 --> 01:04:04,121
Who is out there?

730
01:04:04,122 --> 01:04:05,531
I don't know.

731
01:04:05,532 --> 01:04:07,861
He probably hired some backwoods yokels

732
01:04:07,862 --> 01:04:10,841
to come to the park to come in here and...

733
01:04:10,842 --> 01:04:11,901
For what?

734
01:04:11,902 --> 01:04:13,482
For profits? For...

735
01:04:14,912 --> 01:04:16,131
So this place can make money?

736
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:17,211
Is that what this is about?

737
01:04:17,212 --> 01:04:19,212
Keeping this place open?

738
01:04:20,722 --> 01:04:23,301
He thought people
would flock to this place

739
01:04:23,302 --> 01:04:26,472
if they knew it was famous for murder.

740
01:04:27,692 --> 01:04:31,692
Allison and Tony are
dead, don't you get that?

741
01:04:58,292 --> 01:04:59,622
Now he's coming.

742
01:05:40,192 --> 01:05:41,261
We can't stay here.

743
01:05:41,262 --> 01:05:43,172
What are we gonna do?

744
01:05:44,742 --> 01:05:47,191
Maybe we can stay here,
barricade the doors,

745
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:49,171
wait until dawn.

746
01:05:49,172 --> 01:05:50,291
We can't.

747
01:05:50,292 --> 01:05:52,551
Eventually they'll know we're in here.

748
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:55,052
I can't go anywhere on this.

749
01:05:58,852 --> 01:06:02,352
I don't know.

750
01:06:04,942 --> 01:06:06,571
Oh my God.

751
01:06:06,572 --> 01:06:08,161
Oh my God, Henry.

752
01:06:08,162 --> 01:06:09,742
Oh Jesus.

753
01:06:12,232 --> 01:06:13,241
Wait, he had a gun.

754
01:06:13,242 --> 01:06:14,821
Henry had a gun.

755
01:06:14,822 --> 01:06:17,091
Yeah, and he still has it on him.

756
01:06:17,092 --> 01:06:18,461
We need it.

757
01:06:18,462 --> 01:06:20,961
You mean go outside and get it?

758
01:06:20,962 --> 01:06:23,751
It would give us a chance, wouldn't it?

759
01:06:23,752 --> 01:06:26,121
That is a lot of park to cover.

760
01:06:26,122 --> 01:06:27,131
Any shortcuts?

761
01:06:27,132 --> 01:06:29,632
Maintenance tunnels, anything?

762
01:06:31,562 --> 01:06:32,732
Maps, layouts.

763
01:06:33,652 --> 01:06:34,671
What are you gonna do with it?

764
01:06:34,672 --> 01:06:36,121
Just shoot them?

765
01:06:36,122 --> 01:06:38,731
Whatever I have to do.

766
01:06:38,732 --> 01:06:39,812
I see them.

767
01:06:40,912 --> 01:06:42,741
They're over by the arcade.

768
01:06:42,742 --> 01:06:45,701
The roller coaster's on
the other side of the park.

769
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,702
If you're going, go now.

770
01:06:50,782 --> 01:06:52,761
What are you gonna do?

771
01:06:52,762 --> 01:06:53,951
I'll be fine.

772
01:06:53,952 --> 01:06:56,111
I'll lock up behind you.

773
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:56,952
Go.

774
01:09:12,372 --> 01:09:13,202
Hey!

775
01:09:14,122 --> 01:09:15,881
What you doin', fudge pack?

776
01:09:15,882 --> 01:09:19,632
Get down here and help
me with this last one.

777
01:10:18,212 --> 01:10:19,851
Unh, unh, unh.

778
01:10:19,852 --> 01:10:21,931
Come on, piddle pug.

779
01:10:21,932 --> 01:10:24,262
Come on, it's gonna be okay.

780
01:10:33,622 --> 01:10:36,031
Come on, it's gonna be okay.

781
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:37,601
It'll be all right, come on.

782
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:38,891
Get over here.

783
01:10:38,892 --> 01:10:39,722
Come on.

784
01:10:39,722 --> 01:10:40,552
Get your ass up here,

785
01:10:40,553 --> 01:10:42,241
you fuckin' bitch.

786
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:43,742
Come on, that way.

787
01:10:46,362 --> 01:10:49,081
Hm, you got a pretty
little ass on you, girl.

788
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:50,821
We're gonna take a little walk.

789
01:10:50,822 --> 01:10:51,911
How can you do this?

790
01:10:51,912 --> 01:10:53,651
What? Murder?

791
01:10:53,652 --> 01:10:57,822
Huntin' deer, huntin'
people, it's the same thing.

792
01:11:00,922 --> 01:11:02,842
Where is that lard ass?

793
01:11:05,412 --> 01:11:07,121
Easy girl, just you relax.

794
01:11:07,122 --> 01:11:09,481
It won't be much more than a few minutes,

795
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:12,441
then old Ogre's gonna have his turn.

796
01:11:12,442 --> 01:11:14,441
No.

797
01:11:14,442 --> 01:11:15,272
Hey!

798
01:11:20,482 --> 01:11:21,312
Go! Run!

799
01:11:24,732 --> 01:11:27,431
You fucking motherfucker.

800
01:11:27,432 --> 01:11:29,521
You better kill me, boy.

801
01:11:29,522 --> 01:11:31,042
Don't you worry about that!

802
01:11:51,882 --> 01:11:55,492
Go get her!

803
01:12:09,832 --> 01:12:10,902
Roy!

804
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:12,061
Look what you did!

805
01:15:12,062 --> 01:15:13,092
You bitch!

806
01:15:17,382 --> 01:15:18,212
You fuckin'...

807
01:15:49,152 --> 01:15:50,481
Ooh yeah!

808
01:15:50,482 --> 01:15:52,361
Yeah!

809
01:15:52,362 --> 01:15:54,952
Oh!

810
01:16:09,752 --> 01:16:10,592
You bitch!

811
01:16:12,352 --> 01:16:13,601
Come here, you bitch.

812
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:16,041
Little princess, I got somethin' for you.

813
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:18,682
Fuckin' gonna cut ya to bits.

814
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:41,582
Get down here, you little sack of meat!

815
01:16:45,042 --> 01:16:49,212
Where are you, little pig?

816
01:16:54,092 --> 01:16:57,101
Okay, girly, let's end this.

817
01:16:57,102 --> 01:16:58,102
Time to die.

818
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:15,372
Aw, fuck!

819
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:22,151
Where you goin', sweetmeat?

820
01:17:22,152 --> 01:17:24,781
Guess we'll have to do
this the old-fashioned way.

821
01:17:24,782 --> 01:17:26,452
That's okay with me.

822
01:17:51,282 --> 01:17:52,152
My eyes!

823
01:17:52,153 --> 01:17:53,732
My eyes, you bitch.

824
01:18:20,022 --> 01:18:22,281
Information is just coming
in about what the authorities

825
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:25,101
are calling the Fright Land massacre.

826
01:18:25,102 --> 01:18:27,412
Details are sketchy at this point...

827
01:18:45,202 --> 01:18:46,521
Yeah, that's all of it.

828
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:49,272
Thanks, take it easy.

829
01:18:52,872 --> 01:18:54,301
Look at that mob.

830
01:18:54,302 --> 01:18:57,601
This place is gonna make a fortune.

831
01:18:57,602 --> 01:19:00,061
How's she doin', doc?

832
01:19:00,062 --> 01:19:01,501
Ah, she'll be fine.

833
01:19:01,502 --> 01:19:05,281
Few stitches, couple of
bruises, nothin' major.

834
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:06,671
Can I go?

835
01:19:06,672 --> 01:19:08,201
Uh, yeah.

836
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:10,911
Just try to get some rest.

837
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,061
Let me grab my jacket.

838
01:19:12,062 --> 01:19:14,511
I can give you a ride home.

839
01:19:14,512 --> 01:19:15,352
Stay here.

840
01:19:15,353 --> 01:19:18,102
I just left it inside the office.
