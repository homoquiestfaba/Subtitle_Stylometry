1
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:57,012
This is a true story about friendship
that runs deeper than blood.

2
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:02,289
This is my story & that of the only 3
friends in my life who truly mattered.

3
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:07,407
Two of them were killers who
never made it past the age of thirty.

4
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:11,445
The other is a non-practicing attorney
living with the pain of his past...

5
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:14,963
...too afraid to let it go,
never confronting its horror.

6
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:20,520
I'm the only one who could speak for
them...and the children we were.

7
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:59,671
My three friends and
I were inseparable...

8
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,509
...happy and content to live in the
closed world of Hell's Kitchen.

9
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,588
The West Side streets of Manhattan
were our private playground...

10
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:10,105
...a cement kingdom where we felt we
were nothing less than absolute rulers.

11
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:14,743
Hell's Kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend of...

12
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,702
Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican,

13
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:20,180
and Eastern European laborers.
Hard men living hard lives.

14
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,854
We lived in railroad apartments
inside red brick tenements.

15
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:35,773
Few mothers worked and all had
trouble with the men they married.

16
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,368
I buried one fucking wife,
I could bury another one!

17
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:54,083
Domestic violence was a cottage
industry in Hell's Kitchen.

18
00:03:54,563 --> 00:03:56,682
Yet, there was no divorce
and few separations.

19
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:58,681
The will of the Church was forceful.

20
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:01,680
For a marriage to end,
someone usually had to die.

21
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:06,637
Yet, despite the harshness of life...

22
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,756
...Hell's Kitchen offered the kids
on its streets a safety net...

23
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:11,395
...enjoyed by few other neighborhoods.

24
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:15,473
Crimes against people of the
neighborhood were not permitted.

25
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:18,431
When they did occur, the punishment
doled out was severe...

26
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,270
...and, in some cases, final.

27
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,108
A drug dealer from uptown
moved heroin into Hell's Kitchen.

28
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:27,427
A packet killed the twelve-year old
son of a Puerto Rican numbers runner.

29
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,105
It was the last packet
the dealer ever sold.

30
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:34,783
Hell's Kitchen was a place of
innocence...ruled by corruption.

31
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,220
My friends and I spent lots of time
inside Holy Angels.

32
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,019
We each served as altar boys.

33
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,378
Everyone wanted to work
funeral masses,

34
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,257
since the funeral included a $3 fee...

35
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:48,536
...and more if you looked
sufficiently somber.

36
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,614
There was an active competition
between the four of us...

37
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:54,293
...to come up with the best
and boldest prank.

38
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:57,572
Two weeks into the new school year,

39
00:04:57,612 --> 00:04:59,531
I found the nun's clacker in
the school hallway...

40
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,290
...and I was ready for the big leagues.

41
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,168
In church, it was used to alert
the girls as to when...

42
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,407
...they should stand, sit,
kneel and genuflect...

43
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,726
...all based on the number of
times the clacker was pressed.

44
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:12,844
In my pocket, it was cause for havoc.

45
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:26,197
You will be defenders of the faith.
You will be soldiers of Christ.

46
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:28,516
And you will receive the gifts...

47
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:29,955
...of the Holy Spirit.

48
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:38,791
It's gonna be a great day and your...

49
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:42,149
...parents will be proud of you.
When you were baptized...

50
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,868
...godparents made promises for you.
And now...

51
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:46,747
-You're gonna confirm those promises.
-Let me have the clacker.

52
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:48,826
What clacker?

53
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:49,626
Now!

54
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:52,064
Let everyone rise.

55
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:56,342
Let us pray.

56
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:07,497
Nuns are such easy targets.

57
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,695
John and I spent more time in
church than the others.

58
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,653
We were the only two in the group to give
any thought of entering the priesthood.

59
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:17,452
And John and I were intrigued by
the powers the priest was given.

60
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,890
A secret world of betrayal
and deceit, where people...

61
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,529
...openly admitted dark misdeeds
and vile indiscretions.

62
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:25,088
Confession was better than any
book we could get our hands on,

63
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:27,367
or any movie we could see,
because the sins were real...

64
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:29,126
...committed by people we knew.

65
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:32,564
The temptation to be part of that
was far too great to resist.

66
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:33,724
If we get caught, they'll burn us.

67
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:36,202
What if our mothers are out there?

68
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:38,721
What if we end up hearing
their confessions?

69
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:40,360
What if we hear something worse?

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,800
Like what?

71
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:45,038
Like a murder. What if
somebody cops to a murder?

72
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:49,356
Relax. All we've got to do is sit back,
listen and remember not to laugh.

73
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:59,631
Seconds later,
our booth comes to life.

74
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,149
I...sleep with married men.

75
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:04,908
Men with families.

76
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:09,945
In the morning, I tell myself
it's the last time, but it never is.

77
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:13,664
Yes?

78
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:17,981
You see, I'm...I'm pregnant.

79
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,099
The father?

80
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,378
Take a number.

81
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:26,137
What are you going to do?

82
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:28,576
I know what you want me to do.

83
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:30,815
And I know what I should do.

84
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:34,013
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

85
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:38,051
Look, I gotta go.

86
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:41,650
Thanks for listening, fellas.
I really appreciate it.

87
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,768
I know you'll keep it to yourselves.

88
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:51,165
She knew.

89
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,004
Yeah, she knew.

90
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:54,963
Why do you think she told us all that?

91
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:58,481
I don't know. I guess
she had to tell somebody.

92
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,078
Father Robert Carrillo was
a longshoreman's son...

93
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:07,796
...who was as comfortable sitting on
a bar stool in a back alley saloon...

94
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:09,995
...as he was standing at the altar
during High Mass.

95
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:13,554
He had toyed with a life of petty
crime before finding his calling.

96
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:16,272
He was a friend...a friend who
just happened to be a priest.

97
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:17,791
You know what crap like
that does to your body?

98
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:21,230
Come on, Father, it beats smoking.
And it's cheaper, too.

99
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:25,028
Maybe.
So, what do you hear, anything?

100
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:26,827
No, nothing.

101
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,706
I hear you're interested
in becoming a priest.

102
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:29,706
Who says?

103
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:33,424
Word is you want to get the
feel of a confessional booth.

104
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,703
I don't know what you're
talking about, Father.

105
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:36,702
You don't?

106
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:39,301
Maybe I got the wrong information.

107
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
I guess you did.

108
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,818
I'll see you later tonight.

109
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:45,418
What's tonight?

110
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:48,216
I gotta drop some books
and magazines off...

111
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:50,135
...for the elderly and disabled
around the neighborhood.

112
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,415
Your mother said you'd love to help.

113
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:53,014
I bet she did.

114
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:58,931
Shakes...l don't want you
getting into any trouble.

115
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:01,010
Come on, Father, you know I never do.

116
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,129
That's all I wish for
you and your friends.

117
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:04,288
That's it?

118
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:06,047
That's it. Nothing else,
I swear, that's it.

119
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,726
You know, a priest shouldn't swear.

120
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:10,565
And kids shouldn't be listening
to other people's confessions.

121
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:11,565
I'll see you tonight.

122
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,684
All right...see you.

123
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:19,321
Michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group,

124
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:21,879
which meant that he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion.

125
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,197
But his real love was Carol Martinez,
Hell's Kitchen's half-breed.

126
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:29,156
Half Puerto Rican, half Irish,
she was raised by her father,

127
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,635
her mother having died at childbirth.

128
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:34,353
Carol stayed pretty much to herself but
was always comfortable in our company.

129
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:36,192
We could always count on Carol...

130
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:38,391
...to stand sentry on the first night
of the Ice Capades.

131
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,030
While crowds of families lined
the front of the Garden...

132
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,189
...waiting to see the skaters perform...

133
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:44,508
...we each had one eye in a hole...

134
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:47,027
...watching two dozen beautiful
and nearly naked women...

135
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,466
...get into their skaters' outfits.

136
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:53,064
This is what heaven must be about.

137
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,139
Carol, you want to take a look?

138
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,498
Like it's something I haven't seen?

139
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:08,056
You're so lucky!

140
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:13,374
She's so beautiful. My God, I could
die now and I wouldn't be sad.

141
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,133
When my friends and I were young,

142
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,132
...Hell's Kitchen was run
by a man named King Benny.

143
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:21,370
When he was young, King Benny
was a hit man for Lucky Luciano.

144
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,568
Lucky Luciano did a lot of good for
this country during World War ll.

145
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,967
But you ain't gonna read about
that in any fucking history book!

146
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:30,525
There was talk King Benny was
the shooter of "Mad Dog Coll"...

147
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:34,483
...that prick on West 23rd Street.
He ran bootleg with "Dutch" Schultz.

148
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:37,682
And he opened up a couple of clubs
with "Tough Tony" Anastasia.

149
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:41,120
I was 14 when I first heard
about him. The story goes:

150
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,159
As a kid, he wasn't much of anything.

151
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:46,477
He was always getting the shit
kicked out of him in street fights.

152
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:50,035
And then one day, and who the
fuck knows why, some Irish guy...

153
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:53,913
...about 25 years old,
he takes King Benny...

154
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:55,712
...and he flings him down
a flight of stairs.

155
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,551
King Benny breaks all
his teeth in the front.

156
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:00,150
You know what King Benny does?

157
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,748
He waits. He waits 8 years...

158
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:06,227
...to get even with that prick.

159
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:08,586
He walks into a public bath house.

160
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:09,825
The guy's soaking in the tub.

161
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:14,823
King Benny takes out his front teeth.
He lays them down on the sink.

162
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:18,621
Then he looks over at
the guy and says,

163
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,459
"When I look in the mirror,
I see your face."

164
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:25,578
Then he pulls out a gun...

165
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,736
...and he shoots the guy twice
in each leg.

166
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:33,254
Then he says to the guy:

167
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,252
"Now, when you take
a bath, you see mine."

168
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,930
No one ever fucked with
King Benny after that.

169
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:43,169
Revenge!

170
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:45,927
Revenge!

171
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:50,845
Can I talk to you for a minute?

172
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:54,243
I'd like to work for you.
Help you out, whatever you need.

173
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:57,122
You're the butcher's kid...am I right?

174
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:01,120
What kind of a job are you looking for?

175
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,759
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

176
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,718
It doesn't matter?

177
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:08,876
Everybody says this is the
place to come for jobs.

178
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,515
Who is everybody?

179
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,314
People from the neighborhood.

180
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:16,232
Let me ask you, what
the fuck do they know?

181
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:18,311
They know you got jobs.

182
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,428
Sorry I wasted your time.

183
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:27,906
Hold on a sec!

184
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,465
Come back tomorrow if you want to work.

185
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,384
-What time tomorrow?
-Any time.

186
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:34,543
You'll be here?

187
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:36,422
I'm always here.

188
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:46,177
My first job for King Benny
paid $25 a week and...

189
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,096
...ate up only 40 minutes of my time.

190
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,734
In the dark club room, one of the guys
would hand me a crumpled paper bag...

191
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:54,253
...and direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery.

192
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,692
It was a perfect way
to handle payouts.

193
00:12:57,212 --> 00:13:00,090
Come on, let's go! Right here.

194
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,729
Let's see what kind of cash
you've got in that bag.

195
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,968
You gotta be nuts! Do you
know who you're taking off?

196
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:06,167
Yeah, we know, and
we're scared shitless.

197
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,045
Give me the bag.
Give me the fucking bag!

198
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:14,323
Hey, what you do there? Answer me!
What you do there?

199
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:16,122
This time they took my money!

200
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:17,721
You took the money from the boy?

201
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:18,921
The money they took is in the bag.

202
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:19,720
Let me have the bag.

203
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,520
Fuck you!

204
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:22,719
How about now?

205
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,918
All right, take it easy.

206
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:27,756
You're not smart anymore.
This make you stupid.

207
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:28,836
Let me have the bag.

208
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:33,354
Now, go!

209
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:34,353
What about them?

210
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,153
You care?

211
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:37,911
Then go! Go! Run!

212
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,590
I need somebody with me.
What if the old guy hadn't showed?

213
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:43,189
What you need?

214
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:44,628
My friends.

215
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:47,586
Your friends? What do
you think, this is camp?

216
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,305
These kids, you can trust.
I've known them half my life!

217
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,023
Okay, get your friends.

218
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:57,661
Father Bobby knew we worked for
King Benny, and he wasn't pleased.

219
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:00,620
He wasn't worried about the
pocket money, but the next step...

220
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,299
...when they ask you to pick up a gun.

221
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,258
He didn't want that to happen to us.

222
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:06,617
You think running for King
Benny is a good idea?

223
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:07,417
It pays.

224
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:08,736
A lot of things pay.

225
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:09,695
Not like this.

226
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:14,133
Most priests liked to
preach from the pulpit.

227
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:17,611
Father Bobby liked to talk during the
bump and shove of a pick-up game.

228
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:19,171
Good shot!

229
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,729
I found an art class for you to take.

230
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,328
You know I can't afford
to take any art classes.

231
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,647
You don't have to pay anything.
The teacher's a friend of mine.

232
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:29,765
It could be nothing but
a waste of time, Father.

233
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:31,604
Maybe, or it could be the first step.

234
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:32,844
First step to what?

235
00:14:33,044 --> 00:14:34,003
Doing something with your life.

236
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:35,602
You never know, it may
help you get out of here.

237
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:36,482
You all can get out of here.

238
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,321
Guys, are we gonna talk
or play basketball?

239
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,319
Listen, I got a story
I want to tell you.

240
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,038
It ain't the one about the lepers, is it?
Cause that one gave me nightmares.

241
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:48,156
No lepers. Michelangelo.
He was born poor, just like you guys.

242
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:49,715
He was a painter, he was a sculptor.

243
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:53,234
He takes this job from the Pope.
Good money, good work.

244
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,472
Okay, Father, but why'd
the Pope call him?

245
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:58,711
Because the Pope was looking for
the best guy he could find...

246
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:00,270
...to paint the ceiling
of his church in Rome.

247
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,069
It don't sound like
that big a job, Father.

248
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:03,628
Well, for Michelangelo it was.

249
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,787
Michelangelo needed the job...

250
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,826
...because it paid more money
than he ever had in his life.

251
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:11,145
And that way, he could pay off the loan
sharks that were chasing his father down.

252
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:11,904
What's his father?

253
00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:15,582
He was like a low-level...con guy.

254
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:17,222
Conned people out of money,
goats, sheep...

255
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:18,021
Goats?

256
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:19,461
Chickens, whatever he could, you know.

257
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,260
-Chickens?
-Chickens?

258
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,579
You know what happened?

259
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,738
He painted a ceiling no
one will ever forget.

260
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:26,697
Painted it like he was touched
by the hand of God.

261
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:28,696
Did he pay off the loans?

262
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:29,935
Every single one of them.

263
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,894
How long did it take him,
painting the ceiling and all?

264
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:34,493
It took him about 9 years.

265
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:35,852
9 years?!

266
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:37,132
That's a big ceiling!

267
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:40,130
I had a Puerto Rican do my
whole apartment in two days.

268
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,210
And he had a bum leg.

269
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:43,489
You know, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you guys.

270
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:47,207
Hey, just give us a job painting,
and leave the rest to us.

271
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,446
You know what it was?
The Sistine Chapel!

272
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,405
Sixteenth Chapel?

273
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:51,325
Who painted the other fifteen?

274
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,758
Outside events meant little. In a society
changing radically by the hour...

275
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,557
...we watched the images scatter
nightly across the T.V. screens.

276
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:09,995
Young protesters spoke about how they
were going to change our lives...

277
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:13,593
...and fix the world. But while
they shouted their slogans...

278
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:16,032
...my friends and I went to
funeral services...

279
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:17,591
...for the young men
of Hell's Kitchen...

280
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,950
...who came back from Vietnam
in body bags.

281
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,588
We viewed with skepticism
the faces on television...

282
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:26,987
...those protected by money and
upper-middle-class standing.

283
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:33,024
A growing army of feminists
marched across the country...

284
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,782
...demanding equality.
Yet, our mothers still cooked...

285
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,500
...and cared for men who abused
them mentally and physically.

286
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:44,258
For me and my friends, these
developments carried no weight.

287
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,456
They might as well have occurred in
another country...in another century.

288
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:51,095
Our attention was elsewhere.

289
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:54,973
We sat with Father Bobby in a third
floor hospital ward, visiting John...

290
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:56,572
...hoping he'd recover from
a punctured lung.

291
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:59,451
A gift from one of his mother's
over-zealous boyfriends.

292
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,809
I hope you like these.
You better not tell me you don't.

293
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:09,406
Father Bobby didn't let
that situation rest.

294
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:11,045
I gave on Sunday.
I'm in a rush, okay?

295
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:11,724
John Reilly.

296
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:13,084
The little punk!

297
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:15,642
He got out of line, so I put him
back in line. No big deal.

298
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,082
You put him in the hospital.

299
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:20,600
He's alive, ain't he? Look, if he's
smart, he learned himself a lesson.

300
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,119
What are you? About 220, 230?

301
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,277
You're a big guy. How much
you think John Reilly weighs?

302
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:31,035
80, 85?
That's not even a featherweight.

303
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:34,073
If this were a fight, you'd
be way out of your division.

304
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,551
Look, it was a slap, it was nothing.

305
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,030
Well, next time you'll be meeting me.

306
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,348
And I may not be in your division, but
I do weigh more than 85 pounds.

307
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,066
And you won't need a doctor when
I'm done, you'll need a priest...

308
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:50,185
...to pray over your body.

309
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:55,542
See you in church.

310
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,379
Father Bobby would've
made a good hit man.

311
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:06,097
It's a shame we lost
him to the other side.

312
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,974
We were down 7-6 in the last inning
of a sewer-to-sewer stickball game...

313
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,533
...against Hector Maldonado...
and three of his friends.

314
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,371
Come on, Davy...take this chump out.
He got nothing!

315
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:19,291
Shut up!

316
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,610
Who's that?

317
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,889
His sister.

318
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:23,648
What happened to her?

319
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:26,847
I'm not sure, some kind of cancer
got in her legs or something.

320
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:28,126
Worry about the game, come on.

321
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:31,684
Come on, Davy, strike the scumbag out.

322
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,963
He can't touch you Davy,
he can't touch you.

323
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,162
Hey, while you don't got any
legs, you got a lot of tongue!

324
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:37,681
This is it...home run!

325
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,240
Easy, Mike.

326
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,879
What the fuck you
looking at, little dick?!

327
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:45,118
She's nothing but charm.

328
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:47,476
Come on, Davy!

329
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:48,916
You can take him,
you can take him, Mikey.

330
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,155
Yeah, I told you he wasn't shit, baby!

331
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,154
Hey, swallow your tongue,
you little gimp bitch!

332
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:55,073
You could've helped her
across the street...

333
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,272
...or you could've bought her
an ice cream.

334
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:57,471
You didn't have to throw the game.

335
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,790
Yeah, and now we're
the Salvation Army.

336
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,029
You ever wonder why there
ain't a Salvation Navy?

337
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,628
Game over, losers.
Cough up the cash. A buck each.

338
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:06,947
He's no better than you.

339
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:08,506
He was today.

340
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,105
No. You let him be.

341
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:13,503
All because Irish, here, has a thing
for little girls with no legs.

342
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:15,582
Look, stay away from this,
fat man, all right?

343
00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:18,981
You boys are soft like bread.
It's going to catch up to you.

344
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,220
And when it does, it's
going to hurt...bad.

345
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:24,778
What happens is our business,
not yours, okay?

346
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:26,257
You gotta stay tough to be tough.

347
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:28,856
Guy smells it when you're weak;
eat you like a salad.

348
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,335
Do you see that street?

349
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:33,933
That street is the dish of life,
and you boys are appetizers.

350
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:37,292
Somebody gonna come along, eat you
up and forget about you by dessert.

351
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:39,770
Take it easy, fat man.
It was just stickball.

352
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,969
Yeah, but going soft is a habit.

353
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:46,327
You have to keep yourself mean
and cut your life around it!

354
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:48,446
All right, all right, calm down.

355
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,525
It's like hanging out with fucking
Confucius over here.

356
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:52,044
Be funny, limp dick.

357
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,283
Look, this is just free advice
from me to you.

358
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:56,042
You take it or you throw it away.
It don't matter.

359
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:57,961
Thanks a lot, fat man.

360
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,279
In truth, we were all surprised
by Michael's actions.

361
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,278
But in his mind,
losing that game meant...

362
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,677
...handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair...

363
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:08,596
...was more than the right thing to do.

364
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:19,271
Come on, let's go swimming.

365
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,589
The temperature topped out
at 98 degrees...

366
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,788
...on the day our lives
were forever altered.

367
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,787
I'm frying like an egg up here.
I say, we get some buttered rolls,

368
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:29,066
a couple of cold sodas, and head
down to the docks.

369
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:31,145
Can't you feel the breeze up here?

370
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:33,144
What breeze?
We're surrounded by a wall, genius!

371
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:34,183
The devil couldn't stand this heat.

372
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:35,502
Will you guys shut up, please?

373
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:36,742
I'm trying to get my burn.

374
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,181
It's 98 degrees!

375
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:40,820
-There's some breeze up here.
-It's a hot breeze.

376
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,059
We haven't hit the hot dog
vendor in a couple of weeks.

377
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:46,297
I don't know, Mikey. That cart guy
ain't like the others.

378
00:20:46,657 --> 00:20:50,175
I mean, he gets pretty pissed, like
crazy when you try to take him off.

379
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:53,733
We can eat hot dogs...
or we can eat air...choose.

380
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:57,252
Air is probably safer, Mike.

381
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,610
Yeah, a hot dog ain't worth
bleeding over, Mikey.

382
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,729
Yeah, anyway, whose turn is it?

383
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:03,089
Yours!

384
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:06,127
-Yeah, it's yours.
-Mine? It's not my turn.

385
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:07,886
-Yes, it is!
-I went like last month.

386
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:09,006
-He went two weeks.
-You never went.

387
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,085
-Last month.
-Are you nuts? I went right after him.

388
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:11,884
I'm not going.

389
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:13,004
-Why?
-It's too hot.

390
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:15,003
If I walk down the
stairs, I'll pass out.

391
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:20,240
Mustard and onions. No soda.

392
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,799
I know you!

393
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,558
I look like a lot of people.

394
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:25,637
The scam was simple.

395
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:29,076
I was to walk up to the hot dog
vendor and order what I wanted.

396
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:32,754
The vendor would then hand me my hot
dog and watch as I ran off without paying.

397
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:35,952
This left the vendor with two
choices, neither very appealing.

398
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:39,430
He could stand his ground and swallow
his loss, or he could give chase.

399
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,669
The second forces him
to abandon the cart...

400
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,668
...where my friends could
feast in his absence.

401
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,346
I'm gonna need two napkins?

402
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,504
Pay my money, thief!

403
00:21:58,821 --> 00:21:59,740
Wow! Ketchup!

404
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,100
I took it from him and ran!

405
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:05,178
I scooted past Tommy Mug's Dry
Cleaners and Armond's Shoe Repair.

406
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:09,655
The vendor gave chase, a wooden-
handled, pronged fork in one hand.

407
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,134
You gonna give me two?

408
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:24,088
You know, these things are
heavier than they look.

409
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:27,127
Genius, it's the gas tanks
to keep the food hot.

410
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:28,566
They're heavier than shit!

411
00:22:29,326 --> 00:22:30,805
Think we can push it, the three of us?

412
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:32,764
Push it where?

413
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:35,882
A couple of blocks. It'll be
a nice surprise for the guy...

414
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:38,601
...when he comes back from chasing
Shakes, not to find his cart.

415
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:00,870
The vendor tired at 47th and 9th.

416
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,789
I was on the other side of the street.

417
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:06,707
He was beat...but not beaten.

418
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:09,665
He could go ten minutes
more, just on hate alone.

419
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:13,264
Give it up.

420
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:26,857
What's wrong, Mikey?

421
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:30,815
Shakes is taking too long.
He should've been back by now.

422
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:33,373
He'll be fine. He's Shakes.

423
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,331
You guys were supposed to take
the hot dogs, not the wagon.

424
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:40,770
-Now he tells us.
-He's coming fast, Mikey.

425
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,849
He still near?

426
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,288
I got a plan! Come on
over by the subway!

427
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:48,686
The plan was as simple and as dumb
as anything we had ever done.

428
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:51,644
We were to hold the cart on the top
edge of the stairwell,

429
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:53,883
Leaning it downward,
and wait for the vendor.

430
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,922
We were to let it go the second
he grabbed the handles.

431
00:23:56,082 --> 00:23:59,121
Then we'd leave the scene as he struggled
to ease the cart back onto the sidewalk.

432
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,759
To this day, I don't
know why we did it.

433
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,598
But, we would all pay a price.

434
00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:08,116
It only took a minute...but
in that minute...everything changed.

435
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:10,275
Guys, I can't hold it!

436
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:12,074
-Don't let go!
-I can't hold it!

437
00:24:14,313 --> 00:24:14,993
I can't hold it!

438
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:29,985
Stop! God, no! !

439
00:24:51,814 --> 00:24:52,614
Damn!

440
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:01,609
Sweet Jesus! What have you boys done?

441
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:04,568
What in the name of God
have you boys done?

442
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:05,927
I think we just killed a man.

443
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:14,203
While James Caldwell was slowly
recovering at St. Clare's Hospital...

444
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:18,601
...we were charged and remanded
into our parents' custody.

445
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,480
I'm sorry, dad.

446
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,119
'Sorry' ain't gonna do you much good.

447
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:26,277
Take it easy!
This is no time to get crazy!

448
00:25:27,476 --> 00:25:29,715
You're going to jail and you don't
even know what the fuck that means!

449
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,434
Ma! Come look, Ma!

450
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:33,833
I don't know. Bastard!

451
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:36,392
He's just a kid!
He shouldn't have to do time!

452
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:40,870
Nobody in this family should have to do
time. I done enough time for everybody!

453
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:07,536
I hear you're short an altar boy.

454
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:12,374
You still remember what to do?

455
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:16,692
Easy on the water,
heavy on the wine.

456
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,770
And ring the bells whenever
I see someone start to nod off.

457
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,609
Get ready...we got 5 minutes
till show time.

458
00:26:35,282 --> 00:26:36,522
I'm gonna miss this.

459
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,880
I'm gonna miss all of this.

460
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,117
I've been doing all I can, but so
far every door I touch is locked.

461
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:54,033
I could run...we all could run.

462
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,191
Disappear for a while.

463
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,470
Nobody's gonna come looking.

464
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:06,347
Nobody's gonna care about us...
about where we go.

465
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,303
You run now, you're gonna
run till you die.

466
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:19,820
Hiding's not gonna make it go away.
People aren't gonna forget.

467
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:23,298
You've gotta face this.

468
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:30,495
I can't, Father.

469
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:34,413
I don't want to face it.

470
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,131
I'm too scared to face it.

471
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,130
I'm scared, too.

472
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,887
Nobody's more scared than I am,
but you gotta do it.

473
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:52,564
You're gonna be okay. You're
gonna make it through there.

474
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:54,883
You understand?

475
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,919
Come on. We got an audience.

476
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:11,954
I counted three rummies and
four widows on my way in.

477
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:17,112
Plus Fat Ralphie sleeping
one off in the last row.

478
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:21,269
It's the rain. Bad weather
always brings in the crowds.

479
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:28,546
This is one of my favorites.

480
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:30,785
What is?

481
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:36,302
"Whatever you do to the least of
my brethren...you do to me."

482
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,739
Come on.

483
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:50,055
We never saw the vendor as a man...

484
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,654
...not the way we saw other
men of the neighborhood.

485
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:55,812
And we didn't care enough about
him to grant him any respect.

486
00:28:56,972 --> 00:29:00,330
We gave little notice to how hard
he worked, or that he had a wife...

487
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,128
...and two kids in Greece and hoped
to bring them to this country.

488
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:05,847
We didn't pay attention to
the long hours he worked.

489
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:09,765
We didn't see any of that.
We only saw a free lunch.

490
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:15,922
Thomas Marcano, the court hereby
sentences you to be remanded...

491
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:18,801
...for a period of no more than
18 months, no less than 1 year...

492
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,760
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

493
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,197
John Reilly, the court hereby sentences
you to be remanded for a period...

494
00:29:25,357 --> 00:29:27,996
...of no more than 18 months
or less than 1 year...

495
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:29,395
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

496
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:31,194
Lorenzo Carcaterra.

497
00:29:32,474 --> 00:29:35,152
Taking into consideration that
you arrived on the scene...

498
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:37,231
...after the theft of the
cart had already occurred...

499
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:40,270
...in consideration of that, the Court
hereby sentences you to serve...

500
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,468
...no more than 1 year, no less than
6 months at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

501
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,106
Michael Sullivan.

502
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,465
The Court hereby sentences
you to be remanded...

503
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:51,144
...for a period of no more than
18 months...

504
00:29:51,344 --> 00:29:53,503
...no less than 1 year at
the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

505
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:56,382
And I might add...
had it not been for the intervention...

506
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:59,500
...of Father Robert Carrillo who spoke
in glowing terms on your behalf...

507
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,099
...l would've sentenced you to
a much stiffer punishment.

508
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:05,377
I still have my doubts as to
your inherent goodness.

509
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:07,936
Only time will serve to prove me wrong.

510
00:30:11,294 --> 00:30:12,574
Could you do me a favor?

511
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:14,053
What do you want? Name it.

512
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:16,332
The past couple of weeks...

513
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:18,971
...my mother and father looked like
they were ready to kill each other.

514
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,890
Could you watch over them for me?

515
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:21,889
I will.

516
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:26,207
And no matter what you hear,
tell them I'm doing okay.

517
00:30:27,047 --> 00:30:28,006
You mean, you want me to lie?

518
00:30:29,845 --> 00:30:32,484
It's a good lie, Father.
You can do it.

519
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:36,602
Come on, let's go.

520
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:39,320
Be strong.

521
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,640
I will.

522
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:19,940
The Wilkinson Home for Boys
held 780 youthful offenders...

523
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,939
...housed in 5 separate units.

524
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:25,377
From the outside, the facility
resembled what those who ran it...

525
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,817
...wanted it to resemble...

526
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,575
...some kind of nice
school or university.

527
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:34,733
Michael, Tommy, John and I were
assigned to the 2nd floor of Group C.

528
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:39,610
We each had a private 12 ft room.
I'd been in my room less than an hour...

529
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,328
...when the panic set in.
It doesn't take very long...

530
00:31:43,488 --> 00:31:46,207
...to know how tough a person you are,
or how strong you can be.

531
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:51,005
I knew from my first day at Wilkinson
that I was neither tough nor strong.

532
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,678
Hello, Carcaterra.

533
00:32:05,597 --> 00:32:06,717
Toss your clothes on the floor.

534
00:32:07,796 --> 00:32:08,436
Here?

535
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:10,755
Were you expecting a dressing room?
We don't have any.

536
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:11,834
Now, lose the clothes.

537
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:13,633
In front of you?

538
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:22,989
Let's go, let's go!

539
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:35,822
What's that piece of shit
around your neck? Take it off.

540
00:32:36,502 --> 00:32:38,341
It's Mary, you know, the mother of God.

541
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:41,579
I don't give a fuck whose
mother it is. Take it off.

542
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:54,733
Everything.

543
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:57,291
You want me to stand here naked?

544
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:58,531
Now you're catching on.

545
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,929
I knew you Hell's Kitchen boys
weren't as dumb as everyone says.

546
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,485
Now, what?

547
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,163
Get dressed.

548
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,399
There were four guards
assigned to each floor...

549
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,758
...with one -- in our case, Nokes --
designated group leader.

550
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:29,075
Ferguson was the only son of a
slain New York State trooper...

551
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:31,074
...and was on the waiting list
for both the New York City...

552
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:32,354
...and Suffolk County Police Departments.

553
00:33:33,073 --> 00:33:36,672
Styler was using his job at Wilkinson's
to finance his way through law school.

554
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:39,630
Addison was a graduate of
a local high school...

555
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,749
...who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well.

556
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:46,027
It was not a group of innocent
young boys at Wilkinson.

557
00:33:46,547 --> 00:33:48,266
Most, if not all, the inmates
belonged there.

558
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:51,064
A number of them were riding out
their 2nd and 3rd convictions.

559
00:33:51,344 --> 00:33:54,703
All were violent offenders. Few seemed
sorry about what they had done.

560
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:58,061
And as for rehabilitation,
forget it.

561
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:34,603
What the fuck did you do that for?

562
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:37,321
You got close to me.

563
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:38,441
So?

564
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,600
It bothers me.

565
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,358
I don't want to be near you
or your creeped out friends!

566
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:40,690
You know your time here
hasn't taught you shit!

567
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:44,608
You're still the same fucking
bunch of clowns you were...

568
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,287
...the day you walked in here.

569
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:52,284
Okay, everybody go on back
and finish your lunches.

570
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,403
There's nothing to see.

571
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:57,161
Go on, go, sit down...
get out of here.

572
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,480
Go on.

573
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:11,714
That go for me too?

574
00:36:12,354 --> 00:36:13,633
No, it don't go for you.

575
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:18,311
You go back to your room.
You're through with your lunch. Go on.

576
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,908
You and me...we're gonna finish
this sometime real soon.

577
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:24,308
Maybe at dinner.

578
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:28,706
So...you Hell's Kitchen
boys get any lunch?

579
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:32,344
I got to smell it.

580
00:36:33,783 --> 00:36:35,542
You got to smell it...

581
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,700
That's good.

582
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:42,059
Where you going?

583
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:44,018
You said to get lunch.

584
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:47,896
You boys don't need to get back
in line to get lunch 'cause...

585
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:50,295
...there's plenty to eat right
where you're standing.

586
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:52,374
You could smell it.

587
00:36:57,891 --> 00:36:58,930
I'm not hungry.

588
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,089
Well, I don't give a fuck
if you're hungry or not.

589
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,808
You eat...because I'm
telling you to eat.

590
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:10,845
I'm still not hungry.

591
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:18,681
I'll tell you when
you're hungry or not.

592
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:19,680
Now, eat.

593
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:25,157
Excuse me? What the
fuck are you looking at?

594
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:29,395
Get the fuck down on your knees
now and finish your goddam lunch!

595
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:34,233
Come on now, eat! Don't think you
got all fucking day, here! Eat!

596
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:38,271
You've got some mashed potatoes...
come on, suck up some of that jello.

597
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:42,109
Come on now, you fucking assholes, eat!
Don't be thinking you got all day.

598
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:43,988
Hurry up. Come on, now, let's go.

599
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:49,625
None of you clowns are leaving here until
these assholes finish their goddam lunch!

600
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:52,784
You got that? Hey you....

601
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:55,782
There you go, you can't have a good
lunch without a nice piece of bread. Eat!

602
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:58,980
Come on now, that's good.

603
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,459
Show the boys how you follow my rules.

604
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,858
Rules! You understand?

605
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:07,536
Hey look, boys, see how
he follows my rules?

606
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:09,375
Your shift's over, Nokes.

607
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:13,933
I'm not ready to go yet.
I still got a few more things...

608
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:16,132
...l gotta clean up here
before I can leave.

609
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:19,210
It's my tour now.
I'll clean what needs cleaning.

610
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,129
Stay out of this one. It's got
nothing to do with you.

611
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:24,168
This one, I'm staying in.

612
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:29,765
Don't fuck with me, boy.

613
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:34,763
No, Nokes...you fuck with me.

614
00:38:36,362 --> 00:38:37,641
I'm asking you.

615
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:45,757
You're eating into my shift.

616
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:51,994
I'll get out of your way...for now.

617
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:54,673
I'll take what I can get.

618
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:58,711
You boys get off your knees.

619
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:14,023
It's a tragedy. I'll tell you.

620
00:39:15,462 --> 00:39:17,741
I don't understand you boys.

621
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:19,940
I don't think you know what
it means to have rules.

622
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,179
You gotta have rules,
and you gotta have discipline.

623
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:25,497
I don't know what it was like in your
homes and your home lives, but...

624
00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:29,135
...in my house with my father,
there were rules!

625
00:39:29,455 --> 00:39:32,374
And if you didn't follow the
rules, there was hell to pay.

626
00:39:33,093 --> 00:39:35,652
You had rules, and you had discipline.

627
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:41,529
Sometimes, it wasn't nice, but
we learned. We sure did learn.

628
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:46,167
Right around there to the right.
There you go.

629
00:39:52,404 --> 00:39:56,841
I mean, it's a simple thing, really.
You got rules, and you got discipline.

630
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,120
That's the beginning of the story,
and that's the end of the story.

631
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,236
We understand each other?

632
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,155
Turn and face the wall.

633
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,309
Now, we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room, but...

634
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:25,067
...there's no one
to interrupt us here now.

635
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:36,342
What do you want?

636
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:39,820
A blow job.

637
00:40:47,936 --> 00:40:48,895
Down on your knees.

638
00:40:52,654 --> 00:40:54,573
Face the wall.

639
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:13,523
There are no clear pictures of
the sexual abuse we endured.

640
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:16,122
I buried it as deep as
it could possibly go.

641
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:19,720
What I remember most clearly
from that chilly October night...

642
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,239
...was that it was
my fourteenth birthday...

643
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,638
...and the end of my childhood.

644
00:41:33,393 --> 00:41:36,272
Early in my stay, I'd written and
asked my father not to come.

645
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:39,310
I couldn't look at my father
and have him see on my face...

646
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,390
...all that had happened to me.

647
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:43,788
Michael had done the same with the
interested members of his family.

648
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:45,867
Tommy's mother couldn't get
it together to visit.

649
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:47,946
John's mother came up once a month.

650
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:53,783
But no one could stop Father
Bobby from visiting.

651
00:41:55,942 --> 00:41:58,820
So listen, let's try to keep
this on a happy note, okay?

652
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,939
Nokes warned us not to say
anything to Father Bobby.

653
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:05,097
If we did, reprisals would be severe.

654
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,809
You lost a few pounds.

655
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:23,048
It's not exactly home cooking.

656
00:42:24,648 --> 00:42:25,607
Sit down.

657
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:28,646
This is where I get to see
all four of you guys today.

658
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,644
I loved Father Bobby, but I
couldn't stand to look at him.

659
00:42:33,923 --> 00:42:35,162
I was afraid he'd look
right through me...

660
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:36,921
...past the fear and shame,
right through to the truth.

661
00:42:37,281 --> 00:42:40,160
Shakes, is there anything
you want to tell me?

662
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,318
Anything at all?

663
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:46,916
You shouldn't come here anymore, Father.

664
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:51,114
I appreciate it and all, but...

665
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:53,873
...l don't think it's the
right thing for you to do.

666
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,939
I stopped off at Attica today on my
way up here to see an old friend.

667
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:23,738
You have any friends not in jail?

668
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,136
Not as many as I would like.

669
00:43:28,616 --> 00:43:29,855
What's he in for?

670
00:43:31,454 --> 00:43:35,052
Triple murder. He killed three
men about fifteen years ago.

671
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:37,411
And he's a good friend?

672
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:39,130
He's my best friend.

673
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:43,008
We hung out together.

674
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:45,927
We were close...
just like you and the guys.

675
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,160
We were both sent up here.

676
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:07,236
That's right. And it wasn't easy...

677
00:44:09,035 --> 00:44:11,154
...just like it's not easy
for you and the guys.

678
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:17,031
This place killed him...
made him not care anymore.

679
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:23,868
Don't let this place do
that to you, Shakes.

680
00:44:24,947 --> 00:44:27,146
Don't let it make you think
you're tougher than you are.

681
00:44:28,106 --> 00:44:30,025
I've got to go, Father.

682
00:44:38,221 --> 00:44:39,300
I'll see you in the Kitchen.

683
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:42,539
I'm counting on you.

684
00:44:44,937 --> 00:44:46,976
Wipe the tears off your face.
Don't let them see it.

685
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:51,654
Don't let them see you crying.
Don't give them the satisfaction.

686
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:56,252
You'll be out of here
before you know it.

687
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,129
You're gonna be okay.

688
00:45:07,926 --> 00:45:09,845
I didn't want to let him go.

689
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:12,604
I never felt as close to anyone
as I felt to him at that moment.

690
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,359
A number of the inmates, as tough as
they acted during the day...

691
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,318
...would often cry themselves
to sleep at night.

692
00:45:25,437 --> 00:45:26,716
There were other cries, too.

693
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,715
These differed from those
filled with fear and loneliness.

694
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:33,833
They were lower and muffled;
the sounds of pained anguish.

695
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:37,471
Those cries can change
the course of a life.

696
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:40,949
They are cries that, once heard,
can never be erased from memory.

697
00:45:41,429 --> 00:45:44,148
On this one night, those cries
belonged to my friend, John...

698
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:46,467
...when Ralph Ferguson
paid him a visit.

699
00:46:02,698 --> 00:46:05,257
I was expecting to read 30
book reports over the weekend.

700
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:08,975
There are only 6 for me to read...
which means I'm missing how many?

701
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:13,613
This is English class.
Math is down the hall.

702
00:46:17,411 --> 00:46:20,170
I want to help you.
You may not believe that.

703
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:22,249
Or you may not care, but it's the truth.

704
00:46:29,845 --> 00:46:32,404
-You got a second?
-What, I do something wrong?

705
00:46:32,963 --> 00:46:35,282
No. You did a great
job on your book report.

706
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:40,160
You really seemed to like the book,
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

707
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,518
It's my favorite.
I like it more since I've been here.

708
00:46:44,278 --> 00:46:44,877
Why is that?

709
00:46:46,397 --> 00:46:49,875
It's like...he wouldn't let
anyone beat him, the Count.

710
00:46:50,195 --> 00:46:54,353
Took what he had to take,
beatings, insults and whatever.

711
00:46:55,352 --> 00:46:56,312
And he learned from it.

712
00:46:57,551 --> 00:47:00,629
Then when the time came for him to
do something, he made his move.

713
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:04,907
-You admire that?
-No, I respect that.

714
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:08,466
You got a copy of the book at home?

715
00:47:09,265 --> 00:47:10,864
I got the Classics Illustrated Comic.

716
00:47:11,864 --> 00:47:13,103
No, it's not the same thing.

717
00:47:13,863 --> 00:47:15,982
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm gonna miss morning roll call.

718
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:18,700
I've got something for you.

719
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,779
I thought you might like to have it.

720
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:23,658
Are you serious?

721
00:47:24,098 --> 00:47:26,537
Well, you love the book that much.
You should have a copy of your own.

722
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,495
-I can't pay you.
-It's a gift.

723
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,894
You've gotten gifts before,
haven't you?

724
00:47:32,054 --> 00:47:33,093
It's been a while.

725
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:37,451
-Well, it's my way of saying, thanks.
-For what?

726
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:41,129
That somebody listens...
even if it's just one student.

727
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:43,288
You're a good teacher, Mr. Carlson.

728
00:47:43,368 --> 00:47:45,487
Listen, we can discuss the book
on Friday in class if you...

729
00:47:45,887 --> 00:47:47,326
...think the Count can
hold their attention.

730
00:47:47,646 --> 00:47:48,765
He's got a shot.

731
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:50,804
Any particular section
I should read from?

732
00:47:51,524 --> 00:47:54,083
That's easy...the part where
he escapes from prison.

733
00:48:07,196 --> 00:48:09,915
There you go, All Star.
Here's your locker room!

734
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:21,469
It was only a game...just a touch
football game, nothing more.

735
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:23,948
But a game I wish we
had never played.

736
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:28,625
Guards against inmates.
The guards practiced four times a week.

737
00:48:29,425 --> 00:48:31,504
Our team was picked the
Monday before the game.

738
00:48:32,184 --> 00:48:33,623
We had a 2 hour practice.

739
00:48:34,503 --> 00:48:35,662
It didn't matter much.

740
00:48:36,022 --> 00:48:38,900
We weren't supposed to win.
We were just supposed to show up.

741
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,939
Who's the toughest guy here?

742
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:43,058
How do you mean, tough?

743
00:48:43,538 --> 00:48:45,137
Who can talk and have
everyone listening?

744
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,216
Rizzo. Black kid over there.

745
00:48:49,095 --> 00:48:52,454
Michael saw an opening...a chance
to bring the game to our level.

746
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:56,452
Even out the field. But he needed help.
He needed Rizzo.

747
00:48:57,251 --> 00:49:01,169
Black kid with an Italian name.
With him on our side, we had a chance.

748
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:04,927
Look, white boy, I don't know
what you play in the streets.

749
00:49:05,087 --> 00:49:07,246
I don't care. But in here,
the guards call the play...

750
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:08,965
...and the play calls for
them to win the game.

751
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:09,765
Why?

752
00:49:10,085 --> 00:49:11,044
Look man...

753
00:49:11,524 --> 00:49:12,963
...guards stay clear of me, all right?

754
00:49:13,123 --> 00:49:14,562
They stay back and let me do my time.

755
00:49:14,882 --> 00:49:16,641
If I play that game and I
put a hurt on one of them...

756
00:49:16,801 --> 00:49:18,361
...they just might change my cushion.

757
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,599
I'm not saying we gotta win.
I just don't want to take a beating.

758
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:23,038
You do every day.

759
00:49:23,718 --> 00:49:26,876
-Why is Saturday special?
-'Cause on Saturday, we can hit back.

760
00:49:29,915 --> 00:49:32,833
They don't fuck with you like they do us,
but they fuck with you another way!

761
00:49:32,993 --> 00:49:34,193
You're just an animal to them.

762
00:49:35,312 --> 00:49:37,871
-I don't give a fuck!
-Yeah, you do.

763
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:40,629
And beating them on Saturday
is not gonna change a thing.

764
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:42,588
Then why, white boy, why?

765
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:46,946
To make them feel what we feel
...just for a couple of hours.

766
00:49:49,065 --> 00:49:50,784
Now, don't try anything funny, Sambo.

767
00:49:50,984 --> 00:49:53,023
Nobody will get hurt.
You know what I'm saying?

768
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,303
I call heads.

769
00:49:57,301 --> 00:49:59,220
He called heads.
It is a head.

770
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:01,979
Let's go.

771
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:15,012
You're gonna die, mother fucker!
You're gonna fucking die!

772
00:50:25,287 --> 00:50:27,206
None of you motherfuckers can cover me!

773
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:30,724
We got ourselves a game!
I'm feeling good today.

774
00:50:31,204 --> 00:50:32,324
This shit feels good.

775
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,000
Fuck!

776
00:50:46,157 --> 00:50:48,076
Get the fuck off me!

777
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,589
Yeah, keep smiling, you little piss ant.

778
00:51:04,468 --> 00:51:07,026
For 90 minutes, we took
the game out of the prison...

779
00:51:07,626 --> 00:51:09,465
...moved it miles beyond
the locked gates...

780
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,664
...and the sloping hills of
the surrounding countryside...

781
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:14,942
...and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighborhoods we'd come from.

782
00:51:16,142 --> 00:51:18,860
For those 90 minutes,
we were once again free!

783
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:38,371
Rizzo! Rizzo!

784
00:51:49,805 --> 00:51:53,443
Rizzo...Rizzo.

785
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:58,121
Hey, Nokes.
Good game.

786
00:52:00,919 --> 00:52:04,118
For once, we had a victory.
But it didn't last.

787
00:52:04,757 --> 00:52:08,915
It couldn't last...
and all I wanted to do was die.

788
00:52:09,955 --> 00:52:13,793
I was not alone in the hole. I knew my
friends were down in the depths with me.

789
00:52:14,313 --> 00:52:18,430
Each in his own cell, each in his own
pain...suffering his own demons.

790
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,110
Rizzo was there, too.

791
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:24,627
I had lost any sense of time.

792
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:04,927
I thought you'd never wake up.

793
00:53:06,207 --> 00:53:07,486
I thought I'd never want to.

794
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:10,884
John and Tommy, they're
on the other side there.

795
00:53:12,364 --> 00:53:15,882
How are they?
They're alive.

796
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:18,560
Who isn't?

797
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:21,359
Rizzo.

798
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,077
They killed him?

799
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:31,034
They took turns beating him until
there was nothing of that kid to beat.

800
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:37,111
Rizzo was dead because of us.

801
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,390
We made him think that going
up against the guards...

802
00:53:40,469 --> 00:53:41,829
...in a meaningless football game...

803
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:45,427
...had some value...that it would
give us a reason to go on.

804
00:53:46,546 --> 00:53:48,186
Once again, we were wrong.

805
00:53:51,224 --> 00:53:52,503
Did they give you
your release date yet?

806
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:53,943
Nokes had a letter from the warden.

807
00:53:54,742 --> 00:53:56,541
Waved it in front of me,
then tore it up....

808
00:53:57,661 --> 00:53:58,460
When do you figure?

809
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,299
End of spring, early
summer or something.

810
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:04,817
I wish we were coming with you.

811
00:54:05,817 --> 00:54:08,056
It would've been nice for all
of us to walk out together.

812
00:54:09,295 --> 00:54:12,493
No use thinking about that. We're
gonna do a full year, not an hour less.

813
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:17,651
When I get out, I could get Father
Bobby to make a couple of phone calls.

814
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:19,210
Shave a month or two off.

815
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:21,929
-There's nothing to talk about!
-There's a lot to talk about.

816
00:54:22,408 --> 00:54:25,207
Maybe, if people knew what was going
on in here, they'd make a move.

817
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,366
I don't want anybody to know.

818
00:54:28,126 --> 00:54:31,684
Not Father Bobby, King Benny,
Fat Mancho...

819
00:54:31,844 --> 00:54:34,083
...not my mother. Nobody.

820
00:54:35,642 --> 00:54:37,121
I don't either.

821
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:39,360
I mean, I wouldn't know what
to say to anyone who did know.

822
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,598
I can't think of anybody
who needs to hear about it.

823
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:46,157
Either they won't believe it,
or they won't give a shit.

824
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:49,275
Yeah, I don't even think we should
talk about it once it's over.

825
00:54:51,514 --> 00:54:55,352
We got no choice but to live with it.
And talking makes living it harder.

826
00:54:56,671 --> 00:54:58,750
So, we might as well
not even talk about it.

827
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:00,989
The truth stays with us.

828
00:55:04,028 --> 00:55:05,787
I want to be able to sleep one night...

829
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:10,704
...and not have to worry who's coming
in my room, what's gonna happen to me.

830
00:55:14,303 --> 00:55:18,101
If I can get that, then I'll be happy.

831
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:23,338
Someday, John, I promise.

832
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,688
I was in my last hours as an inmate
at the Wilkinson Home for boys.

833
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:45,327
I was given four copies
of my release form.

834
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:47,886
The final reminder of my
time at Wilkinson.

835
00:55:50,245 --> 00:55:51,764
I never heard the key
turn in the lock...

836
00:55:52,324 --> 00:55:54,322
...and I never heard
the snap of the bolt.

837
00:55:55,762 --> 00:55:57,041
You should be asleep.

838
00:55:58,241 --> 00:56:02,119
I just wanted to say goodbye.
We all do.

839
00:56:04,997 --> 00:56:06,916
I told him. I told him right
to his face. I said,

840
00:56:07,076 --> 00:56:08,835
I don't care if you're paying me
overtime or not.

841
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:10,394
I'm not working those kind of hours.

842
00:56:10,594 --> 00:56:11,874
Yeah, did you put in for it?

843
00:56:12,353 --> 00:56:13,273
I put in for it!

844
00:56:13,313 --> 00:56:14,952
Because I put in for it.
They don't give it to me.

845
00:56:15,552 --> 00:56:18,630
I come in early for three days.
Do they give me overtime? No!

846
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,629
A part of all of us was
left there that night.

847
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:24,867
That night will never be
removed from my mind.

848
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:29,785
The night of June 1, 1968--
the Summer of Love.

849
00:56:31,384 --> 00:56:33,303
My last night at the
Wilkinson Home for boys.

850
00:57:18,161 --> 00:57:20,719
At 8:25 p.m. two men
walked through the doors.

851
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,637
The bartender knew their faces as most
of the neighborhood knew their names.

852
00:57:25,037 --> 00:57:27,556
They were two of the founding
members of the West Side Boys.

853
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:29,075
They were also its deadliest.

854
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:33,953
The blond-haired man had been in and out
of jail since he was a teenager.

855
00:57:34,512 --> 00:57:36,511
He robbed and killed
at will or on command.

856
00:57:37,311 --> 00:57:39,870
He was presently a suspect in
four unsolved homicides.

857
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:43,868
He was an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger.

858
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:47,026
He once shot a mechanic dead for
moving ahead of him in a movie line.

859
00:57:49,225 --> 00:57:51,144
The dark-haired man was equally deadly...

860
00:57:51,184 --> 00:57:53,383
...and had committed his
first murder at the age of 17.

861
00:57:54,223 --> 00:57:57,901
In return, he was paid $50.
He drank, and he did drugs...

862
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:01,059
...and he had a wife he never saw,
living somewhere in Queens.

863
00:58:03,658 --> 00:58:06,936
He's making a noble attempt
to really change things.

864
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:10,534
-The Republicans will take the House.
-Well, we got a lot of work to do.

865
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,254
It's gonna take more
than 4 years to get....

866
00:58:12,413 --> 00:58:13,573
They'll take it at
the mid-term elections.

867
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:16,771
He's got the charisma.
He's gonna do it.

868
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:19,530
He's our man. Reagan's
the man who's gonna do it.

869
00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:23,208
Hey, Jerry...
What are they talking about?

870
00:58:23,608 --> 00:58:25,527
They're talking about Reagan's speech.

871
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:30,804
Order those two men some
drinks and put it on my tab.

872
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:35,362
You tell them that Republicans
are not welcome in Hell's Kitchen...

873
00:58:35,522 --> 00:58:38,880
...and either a political conversion or
a change of conversation is in order.

874
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,240
Sure thing.

875
00:58:46,996 --> 00:58:49,795
The gentlemen there would like to
buy you a drink on one condition.

876
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:53,633
You know the rules:
no religion, no politics.

877
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:55,312
You get my meaning?

878
00:59:12,463 --> 00:59:14,662
Order something for me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

879
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,327
Can I help you with something, chief?

880
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:51,324
Not right now.
Enjoy the rest of your meal.

881
01:00:35,502 --> 01:00:39,540
I ordered brisket on a roll,
with fries and...

882
01:00:40,899 --> 01:00:43,538
...two baskets of soda bread.
I know how you like that shit.

883
01:00:44,617 --> 01:00:45,577
Is that okay by you?

884
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:50,814
Take a look at the guy at the table.
Take a good look.

885
01:01:02,168 --> 01:01:03,208
Motherfucker.

886
01:01:28,635 --> 01:01:30,154
That's him.

887
01:01:30,434 --> 01:01:31,794
Are you fucking kidding me?

888
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:35,872
Bingo!

889
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:01,619
This is amazing.

890
01:02:01,779 --> 01:02:04,337
Hello...it's been a long time!

891
01:02:06,017 --> 01:02:07,056
Who the fuck are you guys?

892
01:02:11,254 --> 01:02:12,773
Who the fuck asked you to sit down?

893
01:02:13,253 --> 01:02:16,211
I thought you'd be happy to see us.
I guess I was wrong.

894
01:02:17,971 --> 01:02:20,289
You know, I thought
you'd do a lot better.

895
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:23,048
You know, with all that training...
all that time you put in...

896
01:02:23,648 --> 01:02:25,607
...just to end up watching
someone else's money.

897
01:02:25,927 --> 01:02:27,166
That seems like a waste.

898
01:02:27,366 --> 01:02:29,245
I'm asking you now for the last
time, what the fuck do you want?

899
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,084
Why don't you take your time?
It'll come to you.

900
01:02:36,641 --> 01:02:38,360
I can see how he might forget us.

901
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,799
You know, we were just something for
you and your friends to play with.

902
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:43,998
It's a little harder for us to forget.

903
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:46,516
You gave us so much more to remember.

904
01:02:49,755 --> 01:02:51,074
You can't quite place us,
can you, chief?

905
01:02:51,794 --> 01:02:55,632
Let me help you out. You're looking
at John Reilly and Tommy Marcano.

906
01:03:06,626 --> 01:03:07,506
Yeah, that's right.

907
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,302
That was a long time ago.

908
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,420
So how you been?

909
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:21,819
Yeah, we ain't kids now.

910
01:03:23,058 --> 01:03:24,337
So, what do you want?

911
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:28,335
What I've always wanted
is to watch you die!

912
01:03:34,132 --> 01:03:35,132
You ordered the meat loaf.

913
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:39,570
The brisket's really good here,
only you'll never know it.

914
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:41,609
You fucked up.

915
01:03:54,842 --> 01:03:59,000
Yeah, you were scared little pricks,
both of you.

916
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:04,957
All of you...scared shitless.
But l...

917
01:04:06,796 --> 01:04:10,114
...l tried to make you tough.
I tried to make you hard.

918
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:13,633
I had you all wrong then, Nokes.
All this time I thought you just liked...

919
01:04:13,793 --> 01:04:15,232
...fucking and beating up little boys.

920
01:04:15,432 --> 01:04:17,591
You two motherfuckers
are gonna burn in hell!

921
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,430
You're gonna burn in hell.

922
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:20,509
Yeah, after you.

923
01:04:26,066 --> 01:04:27,186
Did that hurt, Nokes?

924
01:05:03,168 --> 01:05:07,246
Jerry, sorry, should've made
those brisket sandwiches to go.

925
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,599
John Reilly, how do you plead?

926
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,078
Not guilty, Your Honor.

927
01:05:22,998 --> 01:05:23,838
Thomas Marcano?

928
01:05:25,277 --> 01:05:26,396
Not guilty, Your Honor.

929
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:30,474
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano,
you are hereby held without bail.

930
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:34,912
In all the years since Wilkinson's, we
had never once spoken to each other...

931
01:05:35,072 --> 01:05:38,270
...about what happened there.
We remained caring friends...

932
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:40,349
...but the relationship
had been altered.

933
01:05:41,469 --> 01:05:45,467
We drifted together, always wondering
if that moment would arrive...

934
01:05:45,907 --> 01:05:47,586
...that would force us to
deal with the past.

935
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:03,738
One down, Shakes, one down.

936
01:06:05,657 --> 01:06:06,456
One what?

937
01:06:08,615 --> 01:06:11,814
One Sean Nokes.

938
01:06:12,933 --> 01:06:13,773
Nokes?

939
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:22,928
At the time of Nokes' shooting,

940
01:06:22,968 --> 01:06:25,807
Michael was working as an
Assistant New York District Attorney.

941
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:29,205
I got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th Street in Queens.

942
01:06:30,004 --> 01:06:30,924
Then, he hung up.

943
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,921
-So, what did they say?
-What?

944
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:38,360
John and Tommy, what'd they say?

945
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,800
It's a little cloak and
dagger, isn't it, Mike?

946
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:42,598
Nokes?
Did they talk about him?

947
01:06:44,437 --> 01:06:45,717
-John did.
-Yeah?

948
01:06:46,556 --> 01:06:47,516
What did he say?

949
01:06:48,315 --> 01:06:50,834
He said, "One down, Shakes.
One down."

950
01:06:54,232 --> 01:06:56,151
I hear they hired Danny Snyder
as the lawyer, is that right?

951
01:06:56,311 --> 01:06:58,710
It's temporary. King Benny's
gonna move in one of his lawyers.

952
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:01,509
Don't let him do that.
Snyder's perfect.

953
01:07:01,749 --> 01:07:04,027
-Perfect? The guy's a fall down drunk!
-Then he is perfect.

954
01:07:04,507 --> 01:07:05,587
Perfect for what?

955
01:07:09,465 --> 01:07:11,224
Are you covering this
story for your newspaper?

956
01:07:11,384 --> 01:07:12,343
-Me?
-Yeah.

957
01:07:12,663 --> 01:07:16,181
I'm a timetable clerk, Mikey. Ask me
what movie's playing at what time.

958
01:07:16,341 --> 01:07:17,261
I'm lucky they let me in the building.

959
01:07:22,098 --> 01:07:22,898
Get some coffee?

960
01:07:23,898 --> 01:07:24,817
Let's take a walk.

961
01:07:35,372 --> 01:07:37,131
I'm gonna prosecute John
and Tommy in an open court.

962
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:39,890
What, are you fucking nuts?

963
01:07:41,049 --> 01:07:41,689
Just hear me out.

964
01:07:42,048 --> 01:07:44,727
You should stay home tomorrow.
Call in sick and save your life, counsel.

965
01:07:44,887 --> 01:07:46,166
I'm not taking this case to win.

966
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,245
I'm taking this case to lose.

967
01:07:50,604 --> 01:07:51,404
What does that mean?

968
01:07:53,723 --> 01:07:55,242
It means it's payback time.

969
01:07:56,321 --> 01:08:00,559
Look, John and Tommy started this.
It's begun.

970
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:04,517
It's messy, it's not how I had
it planned but...here it is.

971
01:08:05,917 --> 01:08:08,475
And you and l, we can finish it.

972
01:08:09,315 --> 01:08:10,514
Finish what, Mikey?

973
01:08:12,793 --> 01:08:14,552
You read "The Count of
Monte Cristo" lately?

974
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:18,310
I don't know...ten years ago.

975
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:21,669
You see, I read a little
bit of it every night.

976
01:08:22,748 --> 01:08:26,786
I read words like 'revenge'.
Sweet, lasting revenge.

977
01:08:28,865 --> 01:08:30,344
Payback time.

978
01:08:32,103 --> 01:08:33,383
It's our time.

979
01:08:34,142 --> 01:08:35,342
What are you saying, Mike?

980
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:38,940
I'm saying it's time for
all of us to get a taste.

981
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:42,578
I'm saying it's time
to put an end to this.

982
01:08:44,657 --> 01:08:45,657
Let's walk.

983
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,774
So, I asked for the case.

984
01:08:50,854 --> 01:08:52,733
I told them I was from the same
neighborhood as the accused...

985
01:08:52,893 --> 01:08:54,812
...knew the mentality of the area,
blah, blah, blah...

986
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:55,932
They bought it.

987
01:08:56,771 --> 01:08:58,770
And the connection between
John, Tommy and Nokes?

988
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,928
What connection? All juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years.

989
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:04,447
We were never at Wilkinson's.
