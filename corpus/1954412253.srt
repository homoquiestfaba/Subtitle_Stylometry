1 
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,406 
Listen, no matter what happens, 

2 
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,008 
just stay behind me, okay? 

3 
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,282 
One thinks in the cage only to a cause 

4 
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,365 
Time time time, 

5 
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,566 
Every second, every minute, 
every hour, every day, 

6 
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,927 
The clock becomes a 
vital part of you, 

7 
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,487 
In the last 10 years of my 
Life was all about time, 

8 
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,161 
Time to reflect, time to 
to be honest with myself, 

9 
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,005 
Time to wait, 

10 
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,443 
Today opens the cage, 

11 
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,130 
Yes, today is my fucking time 

12 
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,089 
Shit, Falcon, leading to 
Hell are you doing? 

13 
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,769 
You owe me, 
- I owe you? 

14 
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,725 
What are you talking about? 
- The bet from yesterday, 

15 
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,166 
Come on, man, You are in a 
Hour out of this hole there, 

16 
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,325 
Do me a break, 
- You owe, you pay, 

17 
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,729 
I'm still fucking 18 
Years bring, man, 

18 
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,206 
Can not you a little blind eye? 

19 
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,565 
You owe, you pay, 

20 
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,922 
John Falcon, the most glaring 
Son of a bitch in the tract, 

21 
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,765 
This is crazy, Do you like so 
risking your freedom? 

22 
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,086 
Oh well, 

23 
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,245 
Here, 

24 
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,808 
What? 
- The bet was about two boxes, 

25 
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,041 
I do not think so, 

26 
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,401 
Here, Are you happy now, you wanker? 

27 
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,126 
Fucking asshole! 

28 
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,006 
Two black gloves, a 
worn jeans, a shirt, 

29 
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,971 
black boots, 

30 
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,366 
What's this? 

31 
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,123 
I know my stuff, 
- What are you doing when you get out here? 

32 
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,806 
Visit the family, 
- Ah, family is good; 

33 
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,570 
keeps you away from the rabble, 

34 
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,245 
You do not know my family, 

35 
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,001 
Hey, your wedding ring, 

36 
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,001 
Thank you, 

37 
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,967 
Where are you going? 

38 
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,001 
Home, 

39 
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,647 
If that is in the direction 
is your lucky day today, 

40 
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,166 
Just got out of prison? 
- Yes, 

41 
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,251 
Not a big talker, what? 
- Yes, 

42 
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,170 
What's with the gloves? 

43 
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,246 
Habit,

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,527 
Married? Did not she picked you up? 
- No, 

45 
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,410 
It's really cold, 

46 
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,805 
But well, my husband and I 
were being happy 20 years 

47 
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,646 
before we met, 

48 
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,251 
Want to fuck? 

49 
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,806 
Do you want that, right? 

50 
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,844

Yes, exactly, exactly, exactly! 

54 
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,571 
And, do you want my number? 
- I will not be long enough outside, 

55 
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,727 
to use them, 

56 
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,120 
Thanks for the ride, 

57 
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,007 
Darling! 

58 
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,210 
Hello, 
- You need a girl 

59 
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,805 
then we can make a foursome, 

60 
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,320 
You like girls, right? 
- Oh yeah, 

61 
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,285 
Yes, fact, Even though I 
so am in the minority, 

62 
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,802 
I like tits but rather than tails, 
I just do not have the 

63 
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,887 
right woman found it with me 
durchgeknalltem Spinner endures, 

64 
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,524 
Do not be so critical of yourself, 

65 
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,041 
Nah, he's been an asshole, 

66 
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,050 
I need nice and hot, 

67 
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,801 
Brother, you may sometimes? 
- I already go well, 

68 
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,526 
No, 

69 
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,651 
Do you have to play the scout for ever? 
- Yes, yes, 

70 
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,490 
The Scout must pee, 

71 
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,643 
Wait, wait, what are you doing? 
- I want to give it a try, 

72 
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,003 
No, no, no, the want 
not you, No, no, 

73 
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,601 
John will beat us all to a pulp,

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,128 
,,, I've got pubic lice, 
but I do not care, 

75 
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,370 
Oh shit! 

76 
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,926 
Shit, shit, asshole! 
Shit, shit, shit! 

77 
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,162 
The girl - where is she? 

78 
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,446 
Shit! 

79 
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,489 
Fuck you, man! 

80 
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,562 
Say! 
- Sam, 

81 
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,487 
Darling ,,, 

82 
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,363 
The next stage is to 
our own little 

83 
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,682 
Desert Rose, Scarlett! 

84 
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,570 
Shit, it's hot in here, 

85 
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,329 
Hey man, uh, you pills here? 

86 
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,771 
No, 

87 
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,681 
No pills, 

88 
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,121 
Maybe some coke? 
- No, 

89 
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,530 
Oh, you know what, okay, 

90 
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,280 
What's wrong with grass? 

91 
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,451 
No, 

92 
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,284 
Holy shit! 

93 
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,849 
You are Sam's brother, right? 

94 
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,762 
Shit, man, you just get out? 

95 
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,808 
Yes, 
- Me too, man, 

96 
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,367 
Hey, man, 
- What? 

97 
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,290 
You've got blood on your shirt, 

98 
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,205 
That's not my blood, 

99 
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,842 
That's what happens when you find yourself 
mess with the giants, 

100 
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,171 
That's what happens when you find yourself 
mess with the giants, 

101 
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,722 
Do not mess with the giant, Tommy, 
Do not mess with the giants! 

102 
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,486 
Do not mess with the giant, dammit!

In fact, I think it would be good,

I want to join, 

126 
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,163

This is business, your marriage quarreling 
because there is no room,

Everything was good, -Thanks,

133 
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,885 
That's impossible, 

134 
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,564 
Hey! 

135 
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,050 
I knew I would you 
again one day, 

136 
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,969 
As only they will come 
premature to dismiss you? 

137 
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,011

Where is Darling? 
- I do not know, man, 

142 
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,889 
I swear I do not know anything, 

143 
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,491 
Since that night, a lot has changed, 

144 
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,604 
Sam is now a big shot 
- Where is he?

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,169 
Look, what happened in the night, 
I had nothing to do, man, 

148 
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,410 
Donna? Please hold me, 

149 
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,326 
You've forgotten something there, Donna, 
Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna! 

150 
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,211 
I told you, stay behind me,

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,002 
Stop the damn music! 

152 
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,846 
Understand that for none? 
Listen to the music! 

153 
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,445

Dancer is in my house! 
Put their money in! 

155 
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,045 
That's what I mean all the time! 
Well, finally, man, damn it! 

156 
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,170 
Okay, Sassy sees us, 
the back door is open, 

157 
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,330 
John and I will go in here

does anything stupid, 

160 
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,086 
No one gets hurt, 

161 
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,046 
Who is doing here in my house tattoos? 
Can I get a fucking tattoo? 

162 
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,121 
Dance! 

163 
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,850 
Yes, exactly like that, 

164 
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,527 
That's all what you want, This is

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,765 
Where's the rest of it?

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,328 
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

Hey, brother, you're next,

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,362 
No, no, no, no! 
Please, please do not! 

196 
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,766 
Rocco, 

197 
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,850 
you have to go for me to "The 3 Holes", 

198 
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,203 
If you have a yellow '73 Coward 
Duster see, this is my brother, 

199 
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,850 
You have to do as a favor to me, 

200 
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,880 
And though? 

201 
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,440 
You have to kill him for me, 

202 
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,204 
Yes, it is done, 

203 
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,771 
You? 
'Yes, yes? 

204 
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,485 
We have no more candy, 

205 
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,248 
That's all? Should not I 
Rocco with? Rocco is a beast! 

206 
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,927 
He is loyal and stupid, He is too stupid to 
run away, too stupid to quit, 

207 
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,565 
He comes clear with my brother, 

208 
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,207 
What I need from you on the other hand, 
are damn candy! 

209 
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,767 
Okay, well, boss, Candies, 
- Go! 

210 
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,049 
If you trust me, then listen 
on trying to control me, 

211 
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,328 
I like to party, okay? 
I like to be on drugs, 

212 
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,400 
I like to fuck on drugs, do not do 
as if I could not handle it! 

213 
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,244 
I have slept and you 
have overreacted genuine, 

214 
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,689 
What do you want from me? 

215 
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,727 
What? 
- I want you, 

216 
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,809 
I want a life with you, 

217 
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,811 
Just promise me that 
you will try it, 

218 
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,441 
Darling? 

219 
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,206 
I'm not your darling, 

220 
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,560 
Do you have a spare room? 
- Do you have $ 35? 

221 
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,526 
Are you all right? 

222 
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,211 
I need to sleep only, 

223 
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,089 
Room 3, the door on the right, 

224 
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,410 
Tongues, Tongues, Tongues, 
you dumb bastard! 

225 
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,487 
You have to go for me to the meeting, 

226 
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,366 
And you'll help him, 

227 
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,051 
Anger? 
- My brother has just been released, 

228 
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,002 
We'll be fine, 
as long as we do ourselves smart, 

229 
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,971 
Come here, 

230 
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,324 
What do you want? 
- I want you to open the door, 

231 
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,961 
I can sew, 

232 
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,801 
What did you do? 

233 
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,524 
I was approached a school bus, 

234 
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,881 
Wedding ring? 

235 
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,646 
Yes, 

236 
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,771 
Okay, that should be enough 
And now, get up, 

237 
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,408 
Do you got another 
Try position? 

238 
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,081 
No, 
- Why not? 

239 
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,410 
I do this only with my wife, 

240 
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,846 
Also good, 

241 
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,369 
Oh, oh God ,,, 

242 
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,807 
If you stop with the fucking, 
then the seam could hold, 

243 
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,683 
Speaking of which, what do the - 
all the X on the knuckles? 

244 
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,128 
That one owes me 10 years of life, 

245 
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,727 
How do you get the back? 

246 
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,367 
You owe, 

247 
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,161 
you pay, 

248 
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,326 
Well, you know, it is said:In life 
there is always a second chance, 

249 
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,761 
It is called "tomorrow", 

250 
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,722 
Only if you can survive today, 

251 
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,170 
I have knots in their hair, 

252 
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,129 
Room Service, asshole! 

253 
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,960 
Damn it, 

254 
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,641 
He was in debt, 

255 
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,041 
He has paid, 

256 
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,446 
fact 

257 
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,404 
Sam sends a mute, 
to make a deal, 

258 
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,001 
Is this a joke? 

259 
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,322 
For me, this is so over anyway, 

260 
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,209 
And now here with my damn money, 

261 
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,848 
This is good stuff, of which you are 
Hair growing on the eggs, my friend, 

262 
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,244 
And maybe even a few on the head, 

263 
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,289 
What the hell is this now? 
You set me up! 

264 
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,885 
Son of a bitch! 

265

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,327 
Get me out of here!

268 
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,206 
Fuck it! 

269 
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,728 
Damn, you know who I am? 

270 
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,801 
No, 

271 
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,689 
On your fucking knees, 

272 
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,088 
Wait, wait, wait ,,,!

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,044 
Where's the rest? 
- Wait, wait, wait 

274 
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,687 
Where's the rest of it? 
- You want everything? Then take it yet! 

275 
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,805 
What the hell !? 
- No, no, no, wait, wait! 

276 
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,362 
Last chance, asshole,

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,129 
Wait, wait, wait ,,,!

00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,722 
I want to tell you something:You will

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,484 
You are perfect! 

280 
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,720 
Oh my God! 
- Fuck what the fuck? 

281 
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,570 
A clean team is, 
fucking psychopath! 

282 
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,682 
That was fucking murder! 

283 
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,723 
This goes on your account! 

284 
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,287 
We are now looking for ,,, We are looking for 
- Sit down and stop! 

285 
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,689 
Stop it!

286 
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,290 
Sam, what the hell is this, man? 

287 
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,806 
We need to do that, 

288 
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,725 
No, we do not have to! 
- You've seen us all, 

289 
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,126 
We need to do that, 

290 
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,083 
No, please! 
- Hey, no! No, wait, wait, no! 

291 
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,368 
Please, do not! 

292 
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,570 
What the hell !? 

293 
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,568 
Say, will you kidding me? 
Are you kidding me? 

294 
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,127 
Chill out, -The go to your account,

295 
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,721 
that is triple homicide! 
- John, we had ,,, 

296 
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,081 
This is real shit! 
- Find now the drugs! 

297 
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,805 
He is a psychopath! 

298 
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,403 
I have 10 years later 
been waiting to tell you, 

299 
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,047 
Aha, pink, 

300 
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,482 
Darling said already, that you 
a real charm bolts are, 

301 
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,367 
Where is Darling? 
- You do not want to be found, 

302 
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,966 
He is outside, 

303 
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,041 
How? 
- No idea, 

304 
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,525 
We should prepare ourselves, 

305 
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,527 
I have Rocco and Sassy sent, 

306 
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,881 
Tongues will cut it down, he is 
big, but he is not a killer, 

307 
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,923 
He never had a reason to, 

308 
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,010 
People do not change, Darling, 

309 
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,648 
Oh Sam, but they do, 

310 
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,242 
People can not 
change for the better, 

311 
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,728 
but they can for 
Change bad, 

312 
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,603 
He does not care whether he is caught, 

313 
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,326 
He does not care whether he re-
going to jail, 

314 
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,920 
He goes there solely 
just that you pay, 

315 
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,405 
I was not alone to blame, you bitch, 
- Yes, you were, 

316 
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,960 
Now I need some good news 
Was he there? Is he dead? 

317 
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,122 
He is there, He is wounded, 
but still alive, 

318 
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,403 
Are you kidding me? where is 
Tongues? Where is my order? 

319 
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,889 
Tongues is dead, Sinko 
the errand boy is dead 

320 
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,005 
and your brother is with the money 
and the drug took off, 

321 
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,400 
You said he is wounded? 

322 
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,447 
Yes, I have shot faster, 
but he is really a closet, 

323 
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,769 
Come on, go wash yourself, 

324 
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,167 
Styles! 
- Another Line? 

325 
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,566 
Got it, man, I'm at it! 

326 
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,684 
I do not need a line, but 
Killer, You have to get out on the road, 

327 
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,724 
You have to get me killer, 
depending merciless better, 

328 
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,405 
You can do it, 
- I? Up! 

329 
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,206 
I grab this, Sam, Do you want me 
kidding, man? I grab it! 

330 
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,203 
Come on ,,, do not come back without, 

331 
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,680 
Hey man, you know what to 
Hell is going on up there? 

332 
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,848 
Sam's brother was released early, 

333 
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,684 
Who the hell is Sam's brother? 
- His name is Falcon, That was before our time, 

334 
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,929 
And where is the damn problem? 
- The guy was Sam Bat, 

335 
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,646 
The must be pretty crass 
be on it, no idea, 

336 
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,329 
See you here just once, 
Husband, We have a dozen 

337 
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,131 
genuine killer on the payroll, 
- When the brother 

338 
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,123 
can rot in jail and 
Meanwhile hands around his wife 

339 
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,601 
could be paranoid, 
- Maybe, yes, 

340 
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,161 
The point is:I do not care, 
how pissed Falcon is, 

341 
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,647 
Anger does not make one bulletproof, 

342 
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,884 
Hey, boss, 

343 
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,610 
Oha! Hey, hey, wait! 

344 
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,524 
Have times better have a damn 
good reason to show up here, 

345 
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,122 
Wait a minute, hey! Hey, money, okay? Money? 

346 
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,890 
Money is always a good reason, 

347 
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,562 
Yes, I thought so, 

348 
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,321 
I want you to stop, 
Darling to give this shit, 

349 
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,282 
Then it stop, but 
John, I'm not ,,, 

350 
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,009 
I'm not the only one ,,, dealer here, 

351 
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,729 
She has her own head, John, 

352 
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,525 
As long as you're not, 

353 
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,163 
I will not be, Everything ,,, 
everything okay between us? 

354 
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,721 
Already, 

355 
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,846 
Are you crying? 

356 
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,881 
Why? 

357 
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,971 
Why? 

358 
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,120 
Why? 

359 
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,846 
Why? 

360 
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,007 
Why? Why? Why? Why? 

361 
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,407 
Am I not good to you? 

362 
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,444 
You have a nice roof over 
his head, So why tears? 

363 
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,651 
Does not matter, 
- Take! 

364 
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,484 
I do not want, 

365 
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,810 
Come out of there, You now take these pills! 

366 
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,283 
I need you back to normal, 
Girls, and fast, 

367 
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,403 
My brother will not come 
and save you, 

368 
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,002 
And I ,,, I'm starting to really, a 
Reluctance to develop against you, 

369 
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,920 
Fuck you, 

370 
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,404 
I wish I could 
be like you, brother, 

371 
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,805 
Clean, nice car, nice 
Do girls, beautiful things, 

372 
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,405 
But I do not care, 

373 
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,922 
For something you can not force yourself, 

374 
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,128 
Either it is or non-
and for me it is so, 

375 
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,288 
Such a statement is really stupid, man, 

376 
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,925 
Why? 

377 
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,771 
Because you then lonely 
'll end up, broke and 

378 
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,960 
sometime then dead, 

379 
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,930 
You think you're something better, right? 

380 
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,607 
Yes, you think you're 
better than anyone else, 

381 
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,883 
Not at all, 
- I need help, 

382 
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,206 
Darling needs help, 

383 
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,364 
Did you ever in your mind, 
that you're the one who might, 

384 
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,688 
the ass is? 

385 
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,371 
Yes, 

386 
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,690 
He's in there, man, he's in there, 

387 
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,486 
You want your money? Then go in there, 
grabs him and takes him out, 

388 
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,331 
If the fucker comes through the door, 
I blow him off the fucking head, 

389 
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,084 
And how the hell we want 
out to get him there, huh? 

390 
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,965 
Is that his? 
- Yes, that's his, 

391 
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,570 
Shit, dude, 

392 
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,765 
What's the point now? 
Has barricaded himself as ,,, 

393 
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,001 
What the hell, man ,,, 
- Like what the hell? 

394 
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,562 
I thought you were the full 
stark killer! Come on, kill him! 

395 
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,927 
I have something for you, Johnny Boy! 

396 
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,046 
Do you like this? 

397 
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,170 
If you want to get something done, must 
you fucking do it myself, what? 

398 
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,808 
Come on, motherfucker, come on out! 
Show yourself, damn it! 

399 
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,644 
Hey, how are you? 

400 
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,007 
Do not kill me, John, 
do not kill me, man! 

401 
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,680 
I was not in the night time 
here, you know, man! 

402 
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,326 
I want to live, I want to live! 

403 
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,688 
Where is Sam? 
- I do not know, man, 

404 
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,325 
I do not know, I do not know, 

405 
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,251 
I can already hear all day, 

406 
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,371 
Okay, okay, listen! There's ,,, there's a 
huge ranch up at Hill Ridge, 

407 
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,770 
You can not overlook, okay? the 
is the only house there, Please ,,, please ,,, 

408 
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,843 
You know, you're right, 
You were not there, 

409 
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,841 
Yes, man, Yes, yes, yes, 
- This is a family affair, 

410 
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,041 
If you call at Styles? 

411 
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,885 
Yes, but he's not answering, 

412 
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,687 
Then he's dead, 

413 
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,327 
Why am I me from the 
Be persuaded bitch? 

414 
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,881 
Fuck! 

415 
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,247 
Look, 

416 
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,531 
I see you, 

417 
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,087 
I love you, 

418 
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,925 
Fuck ,,, 

419 
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,325 
Round two, motherfucker, 

420 
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,889 
You are on the train, Peacock, 

421 
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,450 
Thanks for the love bite, you bitch, 

422 
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,491 
Darling? 

423 
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,323 
Darling, 
- John, 

424 
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,165 
Come over, 

425 
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,531 
Come over! 

426 
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,441 
I'm so ,,, 

427 
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,606 
I love you, I love you, 

428 
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,570 
I'll be right back, 

429 
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,531 
I love you, 

430 
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,564 
I Carry The Shredder! 

431 
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,811 
Hey, 

432 
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,166 
Why? 

433 
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,527 
We were brothers, 
- We are still brothers, John, 

434 
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,081 
What are you doing? 

435 
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,049 
The pain is more 
than the balls, John, 

436 
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,965 
Over the knife more than my 
falling damn levels, 

437 
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,962 
Takes you just to the end, 
what it started, 

438 
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,805 
What the hell are you talking about? 

439 
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,045 
Tell 'him, 

440 
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,483 
I wanted to marry you, John, 

441 
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,407 
But I wanted to fuck Sam, 

442 
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,770 
Not that! 

443 
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,648 
Listen, John, Yes, it was a time 
because we were both happy, 

444 
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,121 
You were happy, I was happy, you 
were married and I fucked her, 

445 
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,567 
It was great! But seriously, John, 

446 
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,242 
they never loved one of 
us so much like this, 

447 
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,243 
Tell him the rest, 

448 
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,568 
Triple murder! 
- Chill out! 

449 
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,848 
I will not go down! 
- Chill out! 

450 
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,131 
Fuck! 
- No, we wanted to take everything! 

451 
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,448 
You fucking psychopath! 
I've had enough now! 

452 
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,203 
Stop looking at me like that, 

453 
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,444 
What do you want from me? 

454 
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,287 
I never told you, 
I love you! 

455 
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,801 
Have you never promised that I 
will make no more party, 

456 
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,690 
So stand 'around here not so, 
like you're something better, 

457 
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:54,924 
Whoa, wait, wait, wait! You want revenge, 
I understand, I understand, yes, 

458 
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,885 
But not like this, Let's do it the way 
it's your and my daddy did before, 

459 
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,809 
Do you remember how he always us 
has beaten the crap? 

460 
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,362 
Okay, we just change the from, two Men 
go in, one comes out again, 

461 
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,682 
We fight to the death, you 
and I, brother against brother, 

462 
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,884 
Okay? You know you want it, 
You know that you feel it, 

463 
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:17,007 
We put the guns away and 
get it right, Down and ,,, 

464 
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,571 
You should have time to mention! 

465 
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:34,006 
It seems like I would be the last 10 
Run after years of remembrance, 

466 
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,171 
And I'm tired, 

467 
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:45,931 
And, who is now bankrupt, 
lonely and dead, John, huh? 

468 
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,965 
We both, Sam, 

469 
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,368 
You just do not know yet, 

470 
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,045 
I think now not more, 

471 
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,047 
Goodbye, John, 

472 
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,725 
You had debt ,,, and have paid, 

473 
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:37,166 
Have you ever wondered 
why one remains simple? 

474 
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:45,131 
All move, but one that 
one simply stops, 

475 
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,082 
Furthermore, I have recently 
Time thinking a lot,
